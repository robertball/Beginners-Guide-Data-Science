I had a ton of basil that I needed to use up.  It doesn't tolerate cold at all, so it's streching it to keep it into October in Minnesota.  I was struggling to choose a recipe, so I decided to try three different pesto recipes from this site.  In A-typical allrecipes fashion I actually stuck exactly to each recipe so that we could truly judge them fairly.  The recipes were Easy Pesto by Rebecca Jane Thompson, Pesto Sauce by Sara, and Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto by FuzzyGreenMonkey.  My favorite was Easy Pesto.  It had a nice nutty flavor because of the toasted almonds.  It's also nice if you don't have much basil on hand because it uses half as much as the other recipes.  My husband liked Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto the best, it was my close second.  The parmesan cheese and pine nuts really make that recipe.  We both agreed that by far our least favorite was Pesto Sauce.  It was very bland compared to the other two.  I would attribute that to the 1 1/2 cups of walnuts.  I would not recommend that recipe at all.  It was a fun experiment and the other two recipes will go into my permanant file.

This was incredibly good!  I arranged boneless chicken breasts in a 9x13 dish.  I coated each breast with the pesto and then layered sliced tomatos on top.  Sprinkled on shredded mozzarella and baked.  So good!

The proportion of ingredients were perfect! And its a relief to know that the more affordable walnut can be used instead of the rather expensive pine nut without casualty.  Thanks.

I have loved pesto since I was three and stole a bowl of it off the kitchen table. As long as there is a nut, basil, olive oil, garlic, parmesan cheese and a bit of lemon, it is to die for. The different nuts make whole different tastes, personally, I use walnut because they are so much cheaper. Roasting any nut first in a dry skillet makes the taste even better. I also like to subsitute argula for the basil, and asiago cheese on occasion for a different taste. Lemon basil is good, but sweet basil is the herb leaf that is typically used in pesto sauces. You can make this with less oil, too, and make it a bit better for you- but the extra oil makes it that much smoother. Thanks for the good recipe, Sara.

Very good. I didn't have walnuts; so I used pine nuts. I wanted to make it a little less fattening. In place of the 1 cup of olive oil, I used 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup olive oil.

This recipe was quite good.  I absolutely love garlic, but I found 4 raw cloves to be a bit much, and I was surprised.  Maybe next time I'll use 2-3.  I used toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts.  Expensive but worth it.  I also added fresh parmesan and the juice of 1/2 a lemon.  I'll definitely make this  again.  I was concerned about the fat and calorie content as listed on the recipe, but when I made this I came out with around 2 cups of pesto.  The recipe says 4 servings, but this pesto is extremely rich.  On a smaller-sized bowl of pasta I used like 2 spoonfuls of the sauce - not 1/2 cup - so I doubt I consumed anywhere near the fat and calorie content that was listed.

This recipe is incredible!  It's the best sauce I've ever had in my life.  I make it as often as I can.  I grow the basil in my garden so it's extra flavorful.  I've reduced the oil from 1 cup to 3/4 cup to thicken the sauce a bit, and I use only 2 cloves of garlic, not 4.  TRY THIS RECIPE!  You will love it!

Mmm...this was very good. The recipe, as written, makes 2 cups. I used 3 cloves garlic instead of 4, and found it was plenty.  A bit of lemon juice mixed in will help prevent browning, if you're freezing it.

I followed RainbowEyes and left out the nuts, and most of the olive oil, plus she didn't like it that way, I followed her changes and left out the basil too.  It didn't taste very good, and my wife will eat anything.  Next time I'll leave out all the ingredients and see if that helps

Made 2 batches. One with pine nuts and the other with walnuts. I blanched the basil leaves for about 45 seconds before processing with the other ingredients. It keeps the bright green color of the pesto, instead of the browning that occurs.

It came out wonderfully rich and tasty. I added about a cup of chopped fresh spinach and about a tablespoon of lemon juice as well. Didn't really measure the ingredients but it still came out great. Even better after a night in the refrigerator.  Great on whole-wheat tortillas with melted cheese and tomatoes and a nice cup of soup...great light lunch or dinner.

Pesto is one of my favorite foods ever since the first time I ate it as a student in Genoa.  You can sub pinenuts for the walnuts & I like to toast them first.  I thought the 4 cloves was WAY TOO overpowering.  You won't taste the nuttiness of pinenuts/walnuts and the sweet basil flavors.  Pesto needs a balance of all the different flavors. Two is sufficient.  Use fresh grated Parm, too.  The real stuff if you can find it.  You can save it in fridge with a thin layer of olive oil poured over top-stays bright green.

Made enough of this recipe to freeze individual portions in an ice cube tray. Once frozen, I put them in a freezer bag. Now I can take one pesto cube and place on a chicken breast -- just as many as I need -- before cooking.

Roasted the walnuts for about 7 minutes in a 350 degree oven to start and let cool. Needs quite a bit of salt, but taste and add as you need. Only used 2/3 cup of olive oil and freshly grated Parmesan, also added  the juice of 1/2 a small lemon. Delicious. I saved out 1/2 cup to use immediately and had enough left to freeze one ice cube tray to use later.

I got a food processor for my birthday and pesto was the first thing I made in it.  I liked this recipe because it used walnuts instead of pine nuts (they are so pricey and don't have the flavor that I remember, we used to buy pine nuts from the local indian tribe, freshly gathered and roasted, mmm).  I used Thai Basil, it's a sharper taste and since I bought it at the local Asian Grocery - less $$!  I left out the parmesan cheese, because I wanted this to last a long time in the fridge and I like to add cheese separately since I like to use pesto in balsamic bread dip and in eggplant parmigiana (wow!  this was the best eggplant parmigiana ever).  Thanks for the super recipe!

Made it last fall with the end of my garden basil and have been enjoying pesto ever since!  I made a batch in the blender, then froze in ice cube trays.  Once they were frozen solid, I transferred to freezer bags.  Whenever I make stews or tomato soup, just drop in a cube or two!  This recipe was so good I doubled the basil in my garden this year!

Sorry, but we didn't care for this recipe.  I make pesto every summer and this is the most bland, oily recipe I've ever used.  It was flavorless and I had to add tons of salt just to salvage it at all...and I'm not typically a salt user.  I also found that it blended much more quickly and smoothly than my usual recipe does, another indicator that there has way more oil (and thereby less flavor).  Thanks anyway.

It was suggested to me by a friend to substitute Spinach for the basil and to give the sauce a kick add a fresh jalapeño to the blender.  The spinach tastes great and as Mom, I feel good my kids are getting their spinach!  Great versatile recipe - it has been a family favorite in my home for years!

I can't believe I have never made pesto before but I haven't.  This is the first recipe I have tried.  Overall I thought it was really good.  I think I might need more parm but I also didn't exactly measure it so it may have been on the light side by my own fault.  I liked the walnuts but am interested in what it will taste like with traditional pine nuts instead.  I used it on baked chicken the first night (which was okay, think I would have preferred to grill it) and on small elbow macaroni the second time - which was really, really good.  It made 2 cups.  I also did squeeze a half a lemon in it to keep the basil from turning black, which worked and added just another great flavor element to it (and my Italian friends told me I needed lemon).  I would make this again but will also still try other pesto recipes.

I would add toasted pine nuts and toasted almonds and hazelnuts that have been chopped instead of walnuts.  Also you can add chopped flat leaf parsley to stretch the basil.  Roasted garlic and salt and pepper after putting in your cheese and whirling it up.  Good start.

This is the first time I ever made pesto and it was so easy. I used pine nuts instead of walnuts because that is what most pesto recipes call for.  Very garlicky but we love that!  I have three basil plants that are growing like weeds, so I made a big batch and froze it.  I put it by heaping tablespoons into well greased mini muffin cupholders and when frozen, popped out and put in a Ziploc bag for future use this winter. It will be a nice taste of summer when it's cold and snowy outside!

Easy, affordable, tasty.  I finished the basil plant growing season by making 3 batches of this recipe.  I filled ice cube trays with the sauce, froze them, and placed the frozen pesto cubes in a freezer bag for easy 1 Tablespoon servings in the future.

This was my first try with pesto and it turned out wonderfully! The recipe was super easy to follow and it was a nice quick recipe. I did put double the cheese, but other than that, the recipe is great!

Delicious and very easy. Walnuts are so good for you and full of Omega 3's. I think I will make another batch an freeze it in ice cube trays and then transfer into zip lock bags so I always have some on hand to use in a variety of dishes!

I loved finding a recipe for pesto with walnuts instead of pine nuts since pine nuts can be more expensive as well as seasonal. I made a couple of changes, I added 1 tbl of lemon juice before chopping the basil to keep the fresh green color of the basil, tripled the cheese, and cut the oil back to 3/4-1 c.

I love this pesto recipe.  I cut the amount of garlic in half to prevent it from over powering the other flavors.  I've used the pesto over pasta with sun dried tomatoes and it is excellent.  I've also put it on grilled chicken with fresh mozzarella and garden tomatoes.  Yum!!!,

Absolutely delicious! Makes a lot of sauce. I used 3 cups PACKED basil leaves and didn't change the other proportions at all and it came out perfect. Definitely toast the nuts. This is a great recipe!

This recipe is great just as it is. Before you add anything extra, give it a chance to sit overnight. The flavor deepens and becomes much more rich and less "oil" tasting.

This was really good.  I added an extra clove of garlic and not nearly as much olive oil- maybe 1/4 cup.  It does need plenty of salt and pepper for my taste, but it was yummy!

Excellent! Great simple recipe to use up fresh garden pesto.  Didn't have walnuts or pine nuts. Used Almonds. Plan to try cashews or the walnuts next time I make it.

I have a basil plant and found this receipe so I could use some of my home grown basil.  I'm not fond of walnuts so I used pine nuts instead.  The flavor was incrediable.  At first the basil was a little strong (I used to much) but after the pesto sat in the frig for a week my pasta dish turned out perfect.

Well, I plucked my basil plant pretty much clean in order to make this, but it was soooo worth it!  I decided to toast my walnuts to give them a richer flavor, which added a little more depth to the resulting sauce.  I also took a whole head of garlic, peeled off the papery skins, rubbed with olive oil, loosely wrapped in foil and cooked at 400 degrees for about an hour.  With the toasted nuts and the roasted garlic, this was amazing.  I am not sure exactly how much olive oil I added...I just slowly drizzled it in as my food processor did its thing, until it reached the consistency I was looking for.  Yummmmy!  Thanks sal, for a keeper of a recipe :)

Classic. Some people may like a touch of sweetness in their pesto; try adding 1/4 tsp of sugar.

THIS IS SO TASTY!!!!
I changed it up by not using walnuts (forgot to purchase them), adding an extra clove of garlic (it was small organic garlic...), but most importantly: adding cream cheese to thicken (about 3/4 cup, but I wasn't measuring)! 
This was BY FAR the BEST pesto I have ever had, and every bite felt like a taste of heaven!

The taste is off, I think there is too much nuts (a quarter to half a cup would probably be enough). I used only 1/2 cup of olive oil and it was plenty.

It was great. Walnuts or pinenuts, I just use what I have on hand. I am not a strict measurer, but generally I use a little less olive oil.

This was quite good and easy to make. I was very happy with it, especially considering I'd never made pesto before. The only changes I made were using 1/2 cup pine nuts and 1 cup walnuts instead of all walnuts, and using a little less oil than recommended.

If I was making this again, I'd change a few more things: first, I'd use more basil and less nuts. This pesto tasted very nutty to me compared to others I've had. Second, I would use even less oil - no more than 3/4 cup.

I liked this recipe and I liked the fact that it recommended cheaper walnuts versus more expensive pine nuts. However, it felt like the walnut flavor just totally overpowered the other flavors. I guess some things are just too good to be true.

I use pine nuts and also crush up a vitamin c tablet to keep the pesto green. Flatten it out in a plastic sealed baggie and toss in freezer. Take out, toss in pasta water to thaw, cut open and toss onto pasta. Done. I add fresh grated cheese at the time of serving and not freeze with the cheese.

This sauce was exactly what I was looking for but just a little too garlicky for me.  I only put in 3 cloves but it was still a little too much for us.  Next time I will only use 1-2 cloves but other than that, I couldn’t have been happier with the result.  I added some chicken and used pine nuts instead of walnuts. It was delicious!

Delicious!  I made this to use on the easy pizza crust recipe on this site.  There's nothing like the smell of handfuls of fresh basil!  The only thing that could have made this recipe easier for me is if I had a decent sized food processor instead of a mini thing.

This is the best Pesto ever!  I do the same exact recipe at home.  Yes, Walnuts are cheaper but I would recommend if you are going to use them instead of the trasitional pine nuts, to roast them lightly in a non stick fry pan until they releases oils and become fragrant.  I use roasted pine nuts since I do not like the skins from the walnuts in my pesto.  I also use Pecorino Romano cheese if I have it, because I love the more potent cheese flavor.  Yummo!

Really good. I "eyeballed" the amount of olive oil until I had the taste and consistancy I wanted. I will save this one and make it again. I'm using it on an Italian grilled cheese sandwich with tomato and provalone cheese paired with a zuppa tuscana soup. Perfect!

I agree with others: I decreased the olive oil to 1/2 the amount; added a bit more cheese (1/2 cup instead of 1/4); toasted and used pine nuts instead of walnuts; added about 1 T fresh lemon juice.

Help!  I have no idea what I did wrong, but I have great tasting Almond Pesto paste.  Certainly not too oily in terms of consistency.  (Maybe a little oily tasting since I ended up using well over 1 cup of evoo.)  Did I pulse it too long?  Yikes!  Any suggestions???

I have never made a pesto sauce, and tried this recipe. It was absolutely delicious! I did do two things different, which were using almonds in place of  the pine nuts, and parmesan cheese (in the can) in place of the fresh p.c.  I do plan on trying the fresh p.c. sometime, but the other worked out fine.

Turned out very well and will make again, however it was a bit greasy so next time we will scale back on the oil a bit.

My sister-in-law has made a very similar sauce for years and it is definitely the best sauce you will find for its ease of use.  I have seen a few reviews stating oil problems.  My recipe uses a blender full of basil (just loosely piled) and a 1/2 cup of oil.  Then three tbls of cheese and 4 cloves of garlic (will be garlicky).  Salt and pepper aren't required and 4 servings will be made.  We serve our's with the pine nuts on top and if you want it cheesier then you can easily put it on after.

This was okay.  I wasn't thrilled, but I'll try again.  Replaced walnuts with pine nuts.  It was way to garlicy and I doubled the basil (maybe it's supposed to be three tightly packed cups of fresh basil) and it was passable.  I'll try it again with less garlic and a lighter olive oil- I used dark and it was overpowering.

Excellent recipe! I doubled the recipe and froze it in ice trays for convenient serving sizes. Now we can reap the bounties of our herb garden throughout the year.

I've made this several times. It's so good and so easy - forgiving, too. I don't measure very carefully with this type of recipe. I had 5 cups of basil leaves this time so I added extra of everything and just added oil until it was the right consistency. Yum!!

My husband never really liked pesto sauce until I made this one.  I added 2 heaping teaspoons of freshly grated Romano cheese, but I think it was the walnuts that made the difference.  Thanks for sharing.

I believe the KEY to any delicious recipe is quality, and that includes the ingredients to this excellent recipe for Pesto.  I use freshly picked organic basil from my outdoor plant;  freshly grated imported  parmesan cheese, and  olive oil from my Father's island of Crete in Greece.  The olive oil brand is "Mythology" and its excellant.  When it comes to cooking, no substitutes, compromises, no exceptions !

I used the greens from the holly grove market, thai basil and some Asian cooking green from Mary Queen of Vietnam.  I used sunflower seeds from an airport vendor and the jared garlic.  Excellent flavor and the proportion is perfect.  I read somewhere about puting some in an ice cube tray and freezing for later use.  We'll see if that works.  It made a little over 2 cups.  You may want to half the recipe.

The recommended recipes by SYNEVA may taste good to the North American palate but they are not recipes for authentic Pesto Genovese which must include pine nuts and parmigiano reggiano.  Adding chili or cumin is a sin!!  This recipe is excellent and I do use walnuts only because pine nuts are very expensive.  If pine nuts were used in this recipe, it would be 100% authentic (assuming that the correct cheese is being used).

very good and easy to make. However, next time will put only 2 or 3 cloves of garlic since the garlic taste was a bit overpowering. Thanks for the recipe.

This is delicious.  This was the recipe I chose to use based on all the other reviews.  I had never made pesto before.  It came out fantastic.  I used in conjuction with the "penne with chicken and pesto" recipe on this site.  Sure to be a regular in our house.

Only thing I left out was the nuts, as I did not have any. I also cut down the olive oil to 3/4 cup. Was far too rich and the flavor wasn't that great at all. Even my not-at-all-picky husband didn't like it.

Two important things to remember when making this recipe.  CHECK AGE OF THE OLIVE OIL.  Mine was old and rancid, the first time I made the recipe.  Second, use a FOOD PROCESSOR only, never a blender.  The food processor will retain identifiable ingredients.

simple and delicious, even though I used almonds!  I mixed half of this with 7 oz.pkg of cooked noodles, a cupful of bacon crumbles, and 3 roma tomatoes, chopped. heated through and my hubby could barely stop eating, he said delicious at least 6 times!

This recipe came out so YUMMY.  I loved that just a little bit of the sauce was enough for a plateful of pasta.  It's so creamy and nutty tasting - the texture is kind of gritty (from the nuts) and the basil smell - WOW.  It was a little oily for my taste, so I would decrease the olive oil (that's why 4 instead of 5 stars).    It was REALLY easy - just toss all the ingredients in and blend.  I will definitely make this many more times.     Modifications: -I used about 3/4 cup of macadamia nuts instead of walnuts since I had the macadamia nuts handy -I would use less olive oil next time.  Maybe take it down to about 3/4 of a cup.   -I think it tastes better with fettuccine than with other pastas!  This is just my opinion :-)  -Goes REALLY well with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon  -I used about 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/4-1/8 tsp pepper

Excellent!  4 garlic cloves is a bit much, so you may want to start with 2 and adjust to your taste.  I also added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to prevent browning.  This freezes very well.  Great way to use up all that basil in the summer!

EXCELLENT!!! Simple and the taste was magnificent.  I made extra (minus the cheese) and froze it in ice cube trays. Store it in a freezer bag/container. Ready to go for sauces or just thaw and add cheese after. Cheese doesn't freeze well

It was okay - WAY too many walnuts - and I used half of what the recipe said.  It's a little bland for my taste, but I'm sure a little tweaking could save this recipe.

Simple, easy recipe.  Here's a TIP:  use up all your leftover basil at the end of the season to make this pesto.  Spoon (trust me, don't POUR - it makes a mess!) the mixture into ice cube trays, freeze, pop out and then store the cubed pesto in a zip lock or tupperware container in the freezer.  Use it all winter long and just take the cubes you need!  Use the pesto to make the 'Warm Goat Cheese Sandwiches' or the 'Basil Pesto Bread' from this site - both are delicious!

I've had a whole lot of basil growing in my windowsill all summer and needed to do something with it. This was so delicious my husband said it was the best pesto he'd ever had. I decreased the oil to 3/4 cup and since I didn't have any walnuts or pine nuts in the house I threw in some pecans. Served it with spaghettini and grilled chicken. It was delicious!

I feel like a culinary goddess right now!  I just finished this recipe and I think it's one of the most delicious things I've ever made.  I completely disregarded the proportions, but did use all of the ingredients.  It's wonderful!  Thank you for posting the recipe!

This was a very good base recipe. I only used 2 cloves of garlic as other reviewers suggested and thought it was sufficient. Next time I will add some fresh lemon juice.

I would have loved to give this recipe a 5 but I think the measurements may be a little off.  I agree with previous people that 1 cup of oil is WAY too much.  I used just under a 1/2 cup and it was plenty.  I love garlic on anything and everything but if you are not a garlic fan than 4 cloves may be too much.  I used 3 large cloves and it was plenty for me.  Otherwise...fantasic.  I drizzled it over roma tomatoes and fresh mozzarella...WOW WOW WOW

I cut back the oil to 3/4 c to avoid the floating slick most pestos have.  I shouldn't have.  The proportions on this recipe are just right.

I love this recipe! It's delicious. I've made it with walnuts and with pine nuts, and I prefer pine nuts. I also reduce the amount of olive oil by almost a half. It's a good basic recipe, and you can play around a little with it.

Turned out great.  Used pinenuts-never tried the walnuts before, might give it a try next time.
Didn't have fresh basil. Probably used around a fourth of a cup of dried basil.

This was a delicious and easy pesto recipe. I felt it was a bit dry though so next time I will add more olive oil. I also added some fresh lemon juice which made it even more delicious. I'll definately make this again!

I think this is very average.  I used 1c pine nuts instead of walnuts, so maybe that affected things, but I had never heard of pesto with walnuts.  I added a bunch of salt to bring out the flavor, but there wasn't much.  Could be me, but I won't make it again.

I think this recipe is great! I've made it a few times.  With pine nuts so expensive, walnuts make a great substitute & is a barely noticeable difference.

Didn't like walnuts to begin with, but they're more readily available and less expensive than pine nuts so I wanted to try it. That sharp taste from the walnuts still comes through and I don't like it. Will try again but with pine nuts. 

Update:: Ok, so it's been in my fridge for almost 3 hours and I just went to use it. That taste is gone and now tastes just like the pesto flavor I had hoped for. Switching from 3 stars to 5!

This is very good!  I love the way it came out.  The only thing that I did differently was toast the walnuts and garlic in a pan on the stove first.  I will definitely be making this again very soon.

Very good! I was looking for a pesto recipe I liked and I saw this one and thought "walnuts? I have to try it" My family licked their plates clean! My 5 year old is SUPER picky and he loved it. Now he always asks for "green noodles" Thanks!

Basil is crazy this year.  Make it and freeze it with EVOO in plastic ice cube trays.  After frozen put into a sealed plastic bag for use next 3-5 months.  Date packages.  Olive oil keeps frozen a short time.

Very good recipe! Really easy to make, tho it did take a little while in my Magic Bullet. I only made a half recipe, and used a little more oil than called for, as well as fewer walnuts (1 cup instead of 1 cup and 2 TBSP), but it turned out really well! This is the first pesto I've made, so I can't compare it to others, but I DID have to add a LOT of salt and garlic salt to make this flavorful. Perhaps using an herbed oil would have helped? I'm not sure, but with all the extra seasoning, it tasted wonderful. B+ from me!

This was quick and easy to make. I subbed walnuts for the pine nuts and a 1/2 cup of chicken broth for a 1/2 cup of the oil (less fat!). I would recommend this to anyone.

Good recipe and more authentic than many reviewers here know. pignoli are used in some recipes, BUT walnuts are also traditional with Italian Grandmas. I use much more garlic than in this recipe and more Parmesan, about double. Also good and also traditional are sunflower seeds, hulled of course. The Italian cook made do with whatever ingredients came to hand, which is why I love peasant cuisine.

I'm with many of the others.  It was way too walnutty.  Next time I'll bring the amount down by a lot (1/2c maybe) and up the parm.  I ended up with a huge batch because I continued to add basil, garlic, and parm to try to drown out the heavy walnut flavor.

5 stars because it's easy to customize!  I used unsalted sunflower seeds (I washed the salt off); used dried garlic (the flavor just gets bigger after a day) & used grated Romano Cheese.  I also used a tiny (tiny!) bit of liquid smoke since I didn't use any salt or pepper.

This is a great recipe! It whips up so fast and there's really no way to mess it up. I added extra garlic, but I'm a garlic fiend.

Its turn out to be awesome ! My friend like it very much - he's actually a food lover, so he always have his own opinion on food ( criticize ) . So by getting 'approval' from him on this one, I feel totally great ! I took advice from other reviewer so end up I use only 1/2 cup walnuts, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup olive oil :)

I have two boys ages 8 and 12 and they both love this pesto and say it is better than any they have had in restaurants. I follow this recipe exactly and put it on chicken, pasta and even make pizza with it. Thanks Sal!

technically i would give this a 2.5 stars.

-bland
-not enough garlic
-too many nuts

its not bad tasting, simply not impressive. i tried using it on pasta and also as a chicken rub.  it worked out decent for the chicken rub topped with tomatoes and provolone cheese (got the idea from a fellow rater)

This was a great recipe. Next time I will use 3/4 C olive oil instead of 1 C. I like my pesto to be a little thicker than how this recipe ended up being.

This was great. This was the first time I made pesto and had all ready purchased pine nuts so I used half pine nuts and half walnuts so the pine nuts would last longer.  It was great!  One of the best things I have ever made.  Just put it on pasta but plan to stuff a pork tender loin.

This is a great and simple recipe for pesto! It is delicious spread on French bread or served over pasta. I love pine nuts in my pesto, however, pine nuts were $5 for a 1/2 cup!!! To save money but still get that pine nut flavor, I used 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 pine nuts. It freezes well and can be used later on a cold winter night. I grow basil every summer just to put up Pesto sauce every fall.

We used pine nuts (I know, it ups the price), but the walnuts we had were stale.  Even if they hadn't, I was a bit leery about having a walnut flavor.  Anyway, this is delicious and it'll become a staple in my recipe "box".  Also, FYI the fresh basil leaves loosely pack to make the 3 cups.

I added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to maintain the bright green color.  It really didn't effect the taste much so I hope it is a good idea. After filling the container I floated a thin layer of EVOO on top. I used much less olive oil in the recipe itself.

I made this for a party last night and it was a total hit.  Put it on top of some cheese tortellini.  It was a little thick, so I added a little more olive oil.  Also, no need for salt.  It is fine without it.

This is a great pesto recipe!  It was my first attempt, so I'm pretty happy with the results.  Following other's advice, I reduced the amount of olive oil to 3/4c and was VERY glad I did - it was the perfect consistency for pizza sauce!  I also used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 4 and used 2/3c parmesan/romano/asiago blend cheese.  Lastly, I dry roasted pine nuts to use instead of walnuts.  Overall, I will definitely be making this pesto again!

Good basic pesto recipe. I replaced 1/2 of the fresh basil with fresh spinach leaves. Only way to get the hubby to really eat spinach.

Excellent! It was wonderful as a spread on veggies or crackers. I halved the oil and replaced other half with chicken broth. I also followed another review and baked skinless boneless chicken breasts coated in this pesto sauce with grated mozarella cheese on top. Yum! A New family favorite. I served with bow-tie pasta and fresh local tomatoes.  Thanks

We used 3 cloves of garlic, an additional squirt of lemon juice, and 3/4 c. of oil, but the pesto still turned out great! It made a wonderful topping to penne pasta.

In 7 years, I haven't reviewed any recipes, but this one is so quick and easy with the food processor! I was out of walnuts, so I substituted 1/4C pine nuts for walnuts and added the juice of a small lemon to keep the color bright.  I also used rehydrated garlic flakes and ended up using probably about the equivalent of 10-12 cloves.  This could be used as a very tasty veggie or chip dip!  I didn't try mixng it with fat free sour cream, but I'll bet it would be great!! Definitely a keeper!

Pesto turned out great, I followed the suggestion of other posters and toasted the walnuts (spread 1/2 c at a time on a microwave safe dish and microwaved for 1 minute, then stirred, then microwaved for 1 minute more).  Also added a pinch of nutmeg and probably doubled the garlic but the cloves I was using were small.  This is a keeper for sure!

Very good - I have an AeroGarden and had too much basil that needed using - this was perfect!  It needed a little more garlic and the pine nuts are kind of pricey - I'd suggest buying them in bulk from Costco as it was the same price and I sooo much more for the $.

This is a very easy and good recipe for homemade Pesto Sauce! I'll never buy Pesto from the store again. Since I only needed a little, I made 1/3 of the recipe. My basil plant doesn't have quite enough leaves for a whole cup, so used 1/2 cut fresh basil leaves and 1/2 cup baby spinach leaves.

This was good, but way too garlic-y, like others have mentioned.  I reduced the cloves down to 3, but next time I'd do 2 or even just one clove.  I walked around with nasty breath  for the rest of the day, but it did taste pretty good!

This was very good but a little bit on the heavy side..probably because of the one cup of olive oil. I think next time I'll make with a 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup broth.

This is very easy to make. I didn't have a food processor and I was able to get a great consistency just using a knife - though it would be much easier if you have a food processor.

Try using 1/4 cup cashews, only 1-2 cloves of garlic, and only 1/4 cup olive oil.  Parmesan reggiano cheese is the best.  To thin out, use 1/4 cup hot pasta water to add to noodles.

Great Pesto.  The walnuts give the health benefit of omega oils.  Pine nuts are not really nuts and don't have the omega oil benefit. I grow fresh basil and make this recipe then put it in ice cube trays and freeze.  I then have a supply of pesto and basil all winter long.

I think the proportions are all out of whack on this recipe... I had better luck using these:

2 cups basil
1/2 c. chopped nuts (I use almonds)
3 cloves garlic
1/4 c. parm cheese
2/3 c. olive oil
1 tbl. lemon juice (gives it some tang)

This recipe was good.  The only changes I made were reducing the garlic cloves to 2 based on some other reviews.  I love garlic but felt the 2 was plenty.  Also, I only had 1/2 cup of pine nuts and felt that was enough for my taste.

I used about a handful of walnuts and added a little kosher salt and lemon.  Absolutely great!  I only added enough oil to bring it together, so I am not sure how much (but was less than a cup).  I would recommend this recipe!  Thank you for the recipe!

My husband and I just finished a fabulous plate of pasta--followed the recipe exactly except for 3 cloves of garlic rather than 4.  Because it's just the two of us now, I froze the rest of it in ice cube trays so that I can thaw just what we need.  Truly the taste of summer!

I love this easy recipe. I used a little less of the walnuts and a tad more cheese. I also added a little oregano and parsley. It added a little bit of a twist to the recipe. Very easy to make and works well on spaghetti. However, if your recipe is too oily then add a cubed potato to the water with your spaghetti when boiling and the starch in the potatoes will help it stick better to the slippery noodles. In my opinion, pesto works the best with the potatoey option of gnocchi because it sticks better.

This was easy to make and it was very tasty.  I boiled some ravioli, and tossed them with the pesto sauce, which made for a delicious meal.  This recipe will be affected by:  The size of your garlic cloves; how tightly you pack your basil leaves when measuring them; sufficient use of salt and pepper.  Taste the sauce and adjust to your preference, but you can't go too far wrong.  We really enjoyed this recipe.  Thanks!

I didnt think this was bad, but there is an awful lot of oil in it. and WAY too much garlic. next time I will use less oil and at least a clove less garlic. other than that it was really good as a sauce for a green pizza.

This was an easy recipie to prepare. My only problem was acquiring the fresh basil. I only used about 1/2 of the oil asked for and it turned out well. It is a recipe will use more should I beable to grow my own herbs this summer.

This recipe was delicious and received rave reviews!  I halved the recipe, added a little lemon juice to preserve the color and add some brightness to the flavor, and I used a bit more cheese than called for (just because I love cheese!).  I served this pesto over spaghetti with shrimp, and I was extremely pleased with the result!

This recipe was very good. Although instead of walnuts i used pine nuts. I also added a bit more olive oil than suggested. I then added 1/8 cup mozzarella. This turned out very yummy. I froze the extra sauce in an ice cube tray.

Quick and easy, and oh so good!  I know that pesto is usually made with pine nuts, but this didn't really taste any different to me and walnuts are much cheaper.  Highly recommended!

I love this recipe.  I like to add extra cheese.  I cut back on the oil to make more of a paste, you can always add the oil in prior to use.

YUUUMMMM!  Made as recipe states, no changes or additions (a first, I think).  Used in a recipe needing pesto from this site:  Chicken Pesto Penne and also spread on baguette slices and topped with sliced fresh tomatoe and a dash of parmesan cheese.  The latter is likely to be a party staple.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I added the oil as I blended, and probably only used 2/3 cup of oil by the time I was satisfied with the consistency. I added marinaded sun dried tomatoes and used walnuts because I had no pine nuts. I forgot to add the garlic, and realized this once I was cooking with the pesto, but a quick couple shakes of garlic powder and garlic salt saved me. I browned some chicken breasts with sliced vine tomatoes and red onions, then added this pesto until heated thoroughly. It was perfect on top of penne pasta with a sprinkle of shredded parmesan on top. Delish! :-)

We just recently realized that we really love pesto. I thought we'd give this a try. I cut the recipe as I only wanted about a third of what was made here. I only used about half of the amt of oil and turned out great for serving with a simple wheat pasta and shrimp. Easy and satisfies us all.

Very tasty pesto - I used this as a mini-potato topping, but this would be great for deli sandwiches, in fresh tuna salad, or with cheese and crackers.  I used toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts and a little less garlic than the recipe called for and about 1/4 C olive oil instead of the full cup.

I only gave this 4 stars because I made some adjustments.  I just ventured my green thumb 3 weeks ago by planting some basil, cilantro, rosemary & tomatoes that I bought, already sprouted, from Home Depot.  It's done quite well..so tonight I cut some basil & cilantro from my mini garden.  IT WAS AMAZING!!! I only used 2 garlic cloves and 1/2 the amount of herbs and a quarter the amount of olive oil.  I didn't have any lemon, so I added a teaspoon of white wine vinegar to protect the fresh herb color. I also got pinenut instead of walnuts(don't know why, I just did it).  I AM SO PROUD OF MYSELF.  I had to force my 14 year old out of the kitchen.  She kept "tasting" it by the spoonful.

I was making some gourmet pizzas and thought I'd gotten everything I needed at the store.  I forgot the pesto sauce.  Frantically, I searched and found this recipe.  This was better than any bought pesto sauce I've tried.  However, I have to disagree with those who say it's too oily.  I cut back on the oil and had to end up adding the rest because the sauce was too thick to spread on the pizzas.  I did not have fresh basil, so I used about 1 1/2 tsp. of dried basil.  It was still good.  I loved this and will surely make it again.  Even the kids liked it!

Couldn't be easier & definitely cheaper using walnuts. I had some green onion I needed to use up, so I added that, as well as increasing the amount of garlic. Very tasty.

Really good! I like how this pesto uses walnuts (usually have on hand) and not pine nuts. The flavor was just right. Used as a base sauce for my pizza using Goat Cheese Arugula Pizza - No Red Sauce! and Valentino's Pizza Crust. Better than my favorite pizza places. I only needed 6 T of pesto so I decreased recipe to 2 servings.

I used less oil,more basil,  and 3/4 c fresh parmesan..and only pine nuts but I am sure walnuts work. Another tip is to freeze them in ice cube trays, then pop them and store them in ziplock or something airtight..then you can pop a cube in a homemade soup, or defrost only the portion needed.

I made this two weeks ago. I had never had pesto before and made this because of an impulse buy of pine nuts at a local farmers market and then doing an ingredient search trying to find a recipe to use them. I still didn't use it right away; I think the color just wasn't appealing. I finally cooked angel hair pasta and added this some of this pesto to it. Amazing. Loved it. I have nothing to compare this to but am making it again today. I cut back a little on the olive oil and toasted the pine nuts at the recommendation of other reviewers. Yum!

We loved it! It made a ton so I've been eating it on italian bread with mozzarella cheese toasted. SOOOO GOOD! Also good on pizza or just pasta.

I gave this 4 stars only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used pine nuts and eyeballed the oil until it reached the consistency I like.  That being said, this pesto is WONDERFUL!  I used it in the chicken pesto panini recipe from this site and it was a great, light dinner.

Such an easy and great tasting recipe!  I used 3 garlic cloves instead of 4, and substituted grated Romano cheese for the Parmesan b/c I like the taste better.

Great pesto! I used 1 c. walnuts and dry roasted them in a frying pan instead. I used 3/4 c. parmesan, 2 cloves garlic (like some other reviews said), and a little less olive oil. I like using walnuts as a cheaper option than pine nuts!

My first try at pesto and all I can say is... mmm...mmmm.  I did use pine nuts instead, only because I already had some.  Simply delectable.

Very good! My wife does not like walnuts,..so I started using cashews and almonds ( her favorites) and we really love it that way too! The best! We freeze it in freezer bags, "flattened" and it is a joy in the winter when there is no fresh basil! Also it is wonderful added to ranch dressing, and cream sauce!

I LOVE pesto, I make it all the time!  I usually use toasted pecans instead of walnuts and you really don't need that much olive oil, but basically, this is a GREAT recipe!  Make your own adjustments and enjoy.

I did reduce the garlic to two cloves and used canola oil (out of olive oil), but other than that it was very good.  My kids even liked it!

This was very good pesto, but I'm pretty sure I used less oil, I'm guessing 2/3 cup?  I'm always trying to shave off a calorie or two, and I can say I really didn't miss that extra 1/3 cup or so of oil. Only other change was to toast the walnuts just slightly before adding them.  I definitely prefer walnuts over pine nuts in pesto!  Next time I will follow others' suggestions and add a little lemon juice.

I made this over penne with sausage, but i changed it up a bit. Adding 1/2 a cup of Pecorino, 4 packed cups of basil, and barely over 1/2 a cup of oil.  I agree with others, some lemon juice would be a good addition, to keep the basil green and add a brighter flavor.  Overall, we liked it!!

I made this for my girlfriend and myself both agreed this was great as is! The garlic does come through a bit, but it is still delicious. I used slightly less oil and slightly more cheese. The foundation of the recipe is great though!

This was excellent!  We did a mixture of walnuts and pine nuts as that's what we had in the pantry, and my husband ended up adding a dash of cayenne pepper.  Delicious!  And my 15 month old, who usually barely eats, wouldn't stop eating it.  A big hit all around!

YUM!!  On my second batch I added rosemary, oregano, chives, and thyme  - and yes, still had the basil!  I left out the cheese and added a little lime juice.  Put it in ice cube trays and into the freezer.  Will pop them out into a plastic bag.  Will be great for flat bread pizzas, pasta, etc. in the winter!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I used this recipe to develop my pesto recipe using what i had on hand.  2/3 cup  grated cheese, 2/3 cup toasted nuts, 2 cups chopped basil, 3 cloves garlic, salt, pepper, enough olive oil to make the sauce nice and thick yet saucy. Thank you for posting this recipe for me to base mine off of.  I would be lost without it!

A friend brought me a bunch of basil from her garden, so I decided to try making pesto (for the first time!).  The only thing I did differently was to use a combination of pine nuts and sunflower seeds, as I didn't have any walnuts on hand.  I will use walnuts next time, because I love their flavor.  I didn't measure but kind of "eyeballed" amounts, too.  My pesto turned out GREAT!  I can't wait to follow the lead of another reviewer to spread it over chicken breasts with sliced tomatoes and mozzarella and bake.  Yum!  Thanks for the wonderful pesto recipe!

i chose this recipe for pesto only because the walnuts are so much less expensive than pine nuts, but it really lacked the pesto flavor that i was looking for.  i won't use walnuts in place of the traditional pine nuts in my future pesto dishes...

This is our favorite pesto recipe.  We tried recipes that used pine nuts and found it to be bitter.  This one is perfect.  I have basil growing in my Aerogarden, so I can easily grab 3-4 cups of fresh basil at a time.

I cut recipe in half, used pecans instead of walnuts and it came out excellent! i have made w/ pine nuts but pecans were cheaper and had them on hand. EXCELLENT. mixed some pesto with a little cream, little pasta water and little extra salt so it would be 'pourable' for ravoli from trader joe's. super yum. will make again.

By the end of summer I have more basil than I know what to do with, so I end up making this and freezing it or giving it to coworkers.  Simple, Easy, and gives my food processor a work out.

Should have stopped at 1/4 cup EVOO instead of the full cup.  Added extra clove garlic, some romano cheese in addition to parm, yummy! I use pine nuts instead of walnuts.  Excited to try with walnuts!  We tasted it without the EVOO and it was pretty good, so we will go easy on that next time.  Overall good flavor, added mushroom, artichokes, shrimp and pasta for a good healthy meal.

Great recipe. I used pine nuts since that is what I had on hand and reduced the garlic per other reviews but definitely a great base recipe to have in the recipe box!!

Cut the recipe in half but kept the garlic cloves and added a bit more cheese and slightly less oil.  Used basil fresh from my garden, served with angel hair pasta, yummeroo!!!

I agree this uses too much oil. After a great harvest out of my garden, I had a ton of basil, so I started a double recipe of this, only to find I had less oil (3/4 cup) than used in a single recipe. And even with that little amount, my husband's first reaction was "too much olive oil!" I like this one, but I'll be looking around for different recipes as I approach another harvest.

I really wanted to like this as walnuts are much cheaper than pine nuts...but the walnuts just didn't make it.  Recipies should be rated as they are written and without adjustments, or it isn't an accurate review.

Even my picky son loved it.  He asked if there were pine nuts in it.  I told him no and he smiled.  Then I told him walnuts and he asked if I was kidding.  He really liked it and so did my husband.  Will surely make this one again and again.

Very tasty pesto, I only added 3/4 cup of olive oil because it was looking really oily.  I think 1/2 cup would have been plenty.

YUMMY! I used hazelnuts instead of walnuts. I tossed it with pasta one night for dinner and it was to die for. the next night I used it to make gourmet pizza...also tasty! I even had some left over so i froze it and used it later. It froze great. The taste and aroma of this is awesome!! Easy and yet gourmet!

I made mine with almond slices instead of walnuts. It came out great! Perfect amount of garlic and add as much olive oil as desired. I wanted mine a bit runnier for a sauce for pasta so I laddled some of the left over boiling water from the pasta to help thicken it up.

The best pesto I have ever tasted if I do say so myself.  Way better than the stuff in the jars and so easy.  The whole family was impressed.  I, as suggested, eyed the oil to get the consistency I wanted.  Also, I used a ton of left-over roasted garlic instead of the fresh. I also used a combination of sweet basil and a spicy Thai basil.  And I love that it used walnuts instead of pine nuts because they are way cheaper and just as good.

I'm going to give this a 4 because I had to change it.  I only added 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup walnuts.   A cup of oil seemed like to much, I think it might be better to eye it than use exact measurements for the oil.  I also added in addition romano cheese (1/8 cup).  It turned out fabulous with my changes.

Yummy!  This is soooo good and I, too, am glad that it uses walnuts instead of pine nuts.  The only thing I will do differently next time is that I will use only three cloves of garlic rather than four, and that's only because I'm not a HUGE garlic lover.  Garlic fans will enjoy four cloves.

Good stuff! Didn't have walnuts so I used a mix of pecans and sunflower seeds. I think most any type of nut would be ok, just for a nutty flavor. Garlic was a bit strong, as another reviewer said. Three cloves is plenty.
I mixed the entire amount with a small  box of fettucine pasta and 3 sliced, seasoned, cooked chicken breasts and it was a BIT too much sauce for the amount of pasta. Pretty strong. I WILL make this again and next time only use 1/2 or 3/4 of the amount to one box of fettucine.

Yummy! This was the first time I ever made Pesto sauce, and it was so easy. I added this to freshly made mashed potatoes and it was delicious.

Ok - I found it a little sweet due to the nuts (I used pine nuts). Next time I'd use walnuts.  I had this weird bitter taste in my mouth after eating for about 5 days after I made this. I googled bitter taste after eating - and it was because of the pine nuts! I'd like to try it on white pizza - I made this for a chicken recipe - this was by far the better part of that recipe!

I Followed this recipe and suggestions from reviews.  I used 1/2 the oil and still way to much oil.  This pesto sauce tasted like Olive Oil.  My family did not like it and it was expensive to make.

This is perfecto pesto!  For years I have made a dry version of this with dried basil leaves, grated parm, finely chopped walnuts and garlic powder and I add it to orzo pasta along with some olive oil and a little salt.  This pesto recipe is a more liquid version of the same and VERY yummy.  I used it on the Cheesy pesto chicken rolls also on this site.  Served it with spaghetti (can add pesto to this) and cesar salad.  This pesto is also good on any kind of pasta and even with a few thinly sliced sun dried tomatoes.

I used pine nuts instead of walnuts because of my husbands preference. I thought pesto would be alot more difficult but it came out great. The recipe was simple and easy to follow. My husband is the "sauce" guy so it was nice to get compliments from him on how good it was. If I ever need a pesto sauce again I will turn to this recipe

The best pesto I've made and the first with walnuts.  The flavor of walnuts is better suited to pesto than pine nuts in my opinion.

SO easy!  I found it quite oily, and reduced the oil slightly.  The consistency was a bit thick for my taste so I also added a little sodium free chicken broth.  It did taste great and smelled OUT OF THIS WORLD!

I looked through many recipes, and this basic one, in my opinion, is the best. Keep it simple. I am trying to buy and eat as much local food as possible, and so this week I made it and substituted fresh local hazelnuts for walnuts or pine nuts. It is delicious!

Great recipe. Good proportions. I make this in bacthes as fast as my basil will grow and then freeze it in 8oz. ball jar plastic containers. They make enough for 8 servings i think... 1 lb of pasta.

I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the olive oil in half, and added some lemon juice.  Otherwise, it would have gotten 5 stars!

Great! Used the basil from my garden and used 1/2 c pine nuts and 1 c walnuts, making this a very cheap meal! Put in extra parmesean and about an extra c of olive oil (and it was still incredibly thick). Tossed with wheat 3 cheese tortellini and garlic wheat toast. So fast and everyone loved it!

Read other reviews & used pine nuts instead. Also used a little extra parmesan & added lemon juice & zest of one lemon. This added great flavor. Needed to add some extra oil to get it to blend in the blender & keep shaking a bit. Was worth it! The taste is great over spinach & ricotta ravioli!!

I have never made pesto before but mine didn't turn out bright green.  It wa s more of an army green.  Made it just as the recipe said except as per other reviewers I cut back on the olive oil to 2/3 cup.  I rated this a four because the flavor was very good.  I will make this again but I think I will use pine nuts next time or cut way back on the amount of walnuts.  I love this sight, it has made me into an adventurous cook and a much better cook.

This had a great, fresh taste! I served it on top of whole grain spaghetti (cooked using the enhanced spaghetti recipe from this site)  w/ a salad & garlic toast but I am also eager to try it Dawn's way on chicken. I think I'll use the leftovers on baquettes as Bonnie Z described in her review. Hubby was a little skeptical of the recipe because he likes his pasta saucy but this had so much flavor that he "mmm'ed" all through dinner. Thansk for the recipe!

Pretty darned good! I used 1 cup walnuts and a half cup pinon nuts, cuz I had them. Next time will use all walnuts. Also, I cut oil back to 3/4 cup and threw in a handful of parsley and a tsp of lemon juice to round out the taste -- will make this again, definitely. Thank you.

Straight forward pesto recipe! I've used this recipe MANY times and it always changes depending on what nuts I have in the cabinet. Today I only had about 6 walnuts(!) and had to substitute pumpkin seeds. Kinda cool and different. Delicious as a bread/bagel spread, on pasta or in my case sometimes right out of the blender with a spoon and/or finger!

This was also my first attempt at making pesto. My girls loved it and I used half basil and the other arugala. I sauteed my garlic in the olive oil for about two minutes and then added it in the processor. Due to my daughters peanut allergy, I stuck to the walnuts as she's never had pine nuts before. This was so good Sara and thanks a bunch!

This was my first stab at making a pesto sauce.  This was very easy and I used fresh ingredients for everything.  Too much garlic for me - husband loved it - I'm still debating.  I started out with 3/4 oil but found that I needed to add the other 1/4 cup.  I used pine nuts instead of walnuts and added a little more cheese.  I couldn't think of anything else to change it to satisfy my taste.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

For my first try at pesto, very good.  I cut back on oil as others suggested and used a little vegetable stock instead.  Also added a little more cheese, and not so much walnuts.  I enjoyed it, hubby was not too sure.

Extremely easy to make and pretty good, although I found it to be a bit too oily.  I think 3/4 cup of olive oil would probably work just as well.

For a bit of a zest, use pecorino romano (or a mix) of the two cheeses.

Buon appetito!

I increased nuts to 2 1/4 cups & the parmesan to 3/4 cups. I ended up adding an extra drizzle of oil to finish processing greatly increased flavor!

SO good. I toasted the walnuts in a pan for a few mins first. That made a huge difference (I made one batch w/out toasting them and there was a difference). I also used half cashews, b/c that's what I had on hand. Amazing.

Mine came out like a paste. I was looking for a pesto sauce to make pasta with.. this wasn’t it. Too thick. Also walnuts are not a cost effective alternative. If you make it go with the pine nuts. Wouldn’t make it again. Would seek a different recipe.

I've made this several times and it's a consistent family hit, even my 13yr old has made it. (He was starving lol) I use  a little less oil, 2oz of fresh basil (it comes packaged in that amount at Publix) and always use walnuts. Sauce keeps for a day or two in the fridge if you want to make a larger batch and then add to pasta at different times. Takes about 7 min in a food processor!

Insanely simple, quick and delicious. I substituted roasted almonds with a couple cashews thrown in instead of using walnuts. I didn't really measure the nuts, so I may have used more than the recommended amount, but hey, you can always add more oil if it is too thick. I'm ok with less-runny pesto. I also added a teaspoon of sugar (though I'd recommend less unless you like it pretty sweet). I'll be making this for gifts for sure. Even my husband, who isn't crazy about pesto, loved this! We'll be putting it on pizza later tonight, and I can't wait!

I gave this a 5-star after modifying the recipe based on the advice of other reviewers.  I agree with the amount of walnuts this requires is way too much!  I used a half a cup and still thought it was a bit too nutty.  I added more parmesan than this recipe calls for.  I added 3/4 cup of olive oil as some suggested, but it wasn't enough so next time I will stick to the 1 cup.  If not, the pesto sauce  is just one blob and you need that oil to toss nicely with pasta or dip a piece of bread in.  If you like more of this or that, do it. This is a good start.  I love the walnuts, but don't burn them or overcook them.

Liked the walnuts over the high priced pine nuts. I thought 11/2 cups of oil was to much so added extra cup of basil. Perfect!

Perfect in every way. For anyone with nut allergies this was just as good without. I made 2 batches 1 with/1 without walnuts. Froze the extra in ice cube trays.

I also used this to make pesto chicken. Chicken breast or thighs layed in a rectangular baking dish. Top with chopped or sliced tomatoes or cherry tomatoes and then topped with mozzarella- Bake serve with pasta or rissoto. The only thing i did different with this pesto sce is use brasil from a tube (found in grocery cold veggie section) vs. using/cutting the fresh basil plant or leaves. I don't have time to do all that. But tastes delish regardless! It also yields enough that i can save some to use another time (save in the freezer).

The 1st time I made this I did exactly as recipe. I found the olive oil to overpower the nutty, cheesy flavors I like in Pesto. I added an add'l 1/2 cup nuts (I mix walnuts & toasted pine nuts) and used 1 cup of cheese. What is fun with Pesto is u can change it up in many ways. Thanks for sharing!

I made this to use as the topping for a cauliflower crust pizza. Worked perfectly for that. With the leftovers, we made dip by mixing it with hummus and as a topping for broiled crostini. I will definitely make it again. Appreciate its flexibility.

Big taste. Unfortunately I do not own a food processor so it was tedious making it in a blender.

Pretty good - I don't have a food processor, so had to use the blender.  It would probably have a better texture with the food processor.  I think the nuts were still a bit too 'grainy' and obvious.  Taste was good, though, and I got to use up a whole bunch of basil from my deck plant.  Didn't have quite enough, so I added in a bit of spinach to round it out.  Used 3 cloves of garlic - but 2 of them were giant, so it was probably more like the equivalent of 5 cloves.  (We love garlic.)  Have plenty left over from the recipe I used it in tonight, so will freeze some and try another recipe with it in the next few days.

Look no further. This is your go-to pesto recipe. Heed my warning: Ensure that your walnuts are fresh enough. Mine had gone rancid, but again, it still was great! Adjust to 8 servings for 4 people. (I think they were trying to be more judicious for the nutrition and calorie count.)

Awesome pesto sauce! It was a little thick and on the dry side, but really good! It does turn brown if you keep it, but the taste doesn't change. If you are saving it in the fridge for later, don't heat it when you take it out!!! Pour it over warm pasta to warm it up and add some olive oil to loosen the sauce, that will do just fine! I love this recipe!

I made this just as written and it was very good.  Had some leftover grilled chicken so I cooked some linguine, added the pesto and leftover sliced grilled chicken and it made a delicious dinner.  Will freeze the leftover pesto in ice cube trays for later use.

Easy and delicious!  I used 3/4 c. Olive oil, but ended up adding the rest later.  It was too thick to toss into pasta.  I used double the amount of cheese.  Served with stuffed chicken breasts wrapped with bacon!

I thought the garlic was a bit over-powering. Would try with less garlic next time. I also added some pistachios.

This is a good walnut based pesto. If you don't want to use walnuts, don't, but don't then put the recipe down for a strong walnut taste. There are many other recipes on here that use pine nuts if walnuts are not your thing. Secondly, spinach to stretch the basil? What??? Pesto does not contain spinach. With all that said, this is a great pesto that can be tweaked to your taste (I.e: more cheese, less garlic, etc.). I followed the recipe closely only to add some extra garlic and cheese. No salt or pepper is needed. Oil amount was spot on and final product was cheesy and nutty.

Excellent recipe! My basil is out of control, so I'm constantly having to trim it back and find recipes that use a lot of basil. I normally make my pesto with pine nuts and this was my first time using walnuts. I have to say the walnuts gave the pesto a fabulous flavor, and it doesn't hurt that walnuts are way more cost-effective than pine nuts! I might just be a walnut pesto convert now. I added a couple squirts of lemon juice - YUM! I then placed the pesto into an ice cube tray to freeze, and for ease of use later. Thanks sal!

Used raw whole almonds. Cut in half and toasted for 15 min, stirring after 10 min. Added juice of 1/2 lemon. Couldn't stop eating this! So good as a dip for celery too!

Well, this really is an easy dish to make. Three people, who aren't particularly great at cooking, managed to make it. This includes my sister and I, both fourteen. It tasted good, but I believe we added a bit too much parmesan. I would recommend it to others.

I only gave this recipe a 3 because I had to adjust it.  A recipe is only as good as the quality of the ingredients.  ie.  Olive Oil needs to REALLY  be TOP QUALITY.  Personally, I use coarse Hawaiian Sea Salt in Pesto or salad dressings.  I only used two cloves of glaric and added the EVOO by sight.  I add fresh lemon or lime use to retain color.

I think it would be nice if the recipes included what brand of olive oil was used to ensure similar or like results.  However, I also realize this might not be legally possible due to copy right this and that.

This was my first time making pesto sauce, and it was so simple to make! I ended up adding more olive oil to my pesto pasta for a "smoother" texture. I will definitely make this again, very soon!

So easy. I make tons of it in the summer when the basil is growing then freeze it in ice cube trays. Once they are frozen put them in a ziplock and you have pesto for the entire year. yum :)

I had lot's of basil growing in my garden, so I made this recipe today. I left out the cheese and put some in ice cube trays to freeze. I will put them in bags later and have a supply for a while. Yum!

Yummy -- not too oily.  Maybe I would add more cheese, but, it's good as is!  I substituted some sunflower seeds for one batch, because my son is allergic to nuts, and it is still good.

This is pesto sauce is absolutely the best I've eaten and it's so easy. I made one little change in recipe -the nuts. Being allergic to walnuts and unable to go to the store, I used pecans instead. Turned out grate!

Delicious!  I had lots of basil from my garden and so tried out this recipe because I had walnuts on hand.  Made exactly as written.  I could eat it with a spoon its so yummy.  The only thing I would change next time is to only use 3 garlic cloves.

Great basic recipe to use and feel safe that you're using the right amount of each ingredient. Sunflower seeds are another good pine nut replacement, but I recommend using about a cup in that case.

I LOVED this recipe. It's the first time I ever made pesto and I didn't have a food processor so I chopped all the basil by hand and chopped the walnuts as well. Delicious! Thanks for sharing! I had friends over and they loved it too! Truly a luxury in a foreign country!

Walnuts are a cheaper alternative than pine nuts and this recipe is just as delicious. Many recipes call for pine nuts, I think the walnuts offer more flavor, pine nuts can sometimes taste like wet paper! Great recipe, we are making it tonight for the second time, great weeknight recipe, good job!

I've made this a bazillion times and can't get enough! It is so delicious.  I love that the measurements don't have to be exact.  I just throw in what I have and it comes out perfectly every time.  My friends who had never tried pesto just raved about it! This is so much better than any pesto I've had at a restaurant. Oh my! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

So very yummy. I put it on everything. I was suprised at how easy it was to make. You might want to start growing your own basil though, it gets kind of expensive buying that much at the local grocery store.

I have a nut allergy, so I used the more traditional pine nuts. I tend to like a spicy pesto, so I doubled the garlic. Turned out yummy. The key to a great pesto is not over chopping.

Very good recipe! I halved it and was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of using walnuts instead of expensive pine nuts. I wish I would have read more reviews prior though because I found the pesto rather oily and rich. I'll cut down on the oil and add some lemon juice to taste next time.

TOTALLY DELICIOUS & SIMPLE! I never had pesto before but became addicted when I tried this recipe. Even though the recipe called for walnuts, I substituted it with pine nuts. Next time, I'll try it with walnuts. Again, it was "DELICIOUS!"

This pesto is soooo yummy and soooo simple. I had to halve everything since I only had a cup and a half of basil, but I kept the parmesan cheese at the full 1/4 cup. I don't think my husband was too crazy about it, but he's not into foods that are new to him and he had never heard of pesto before. I loved it! I'll definately make it again!

I used toasted walnuts in this recipe, but followed it pretty closely.  I didn't think that it had much flavor.  I tried adding more cheese, but ended up with the olive oil separating out when I heated it up to put on the pasta.

This was easy to make and I liked that I didn't have to use pine nuts (walnuts are so much cheaper!).  Plain, I didn't think this tasted like anything special.  However, once it was combined with chicken, it was delicious!

Very good!  I spread it over cod with a little extra parmesan and baked at 350.  Tasty!  Be careful when salting--I got too much but it was still yummy!

I've made this many times, but I never measure anything, and it's always delicious. I actually prefer walnuts to pine nuts and they are much cheaper. I always use fresh grated parmesan and toast some chopped walnuts to serve on top.

This was my first time making pesto and it was fabulous.  I substituted spinach for the basil and pine nuts for the walnuts.  My husband, who was previously afraid of pesto, is totally enamored and has asked for it 3 nights in a row.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. Quick and easy. I had an overload of basil in my garden this yr so we ate a lot of pesto. I use whatever nuts I have on hand: walnuts, pecans, pine nuts... Tastes great every time.

Excellent base.  I added the juice of 1/2 lemon, two sprigs of mint and a handful of Italian parsley. It made a delicious penne pasta salad.

Okay if you don't have much basil and are desperate for some pesto, but I prefer other recipes with a 4:1 ratio of basil to nuts (e.g. 6 cups of basil to 1.5 cups of nuts - walnut or pine nut). That gives it a much brighter green color and a more basil flavor (as opposed to a more nutty flavor).
That said, I toasted the walnuts, which I think is imperative for the recipe to taste good, since it is so heavy on the nuts. It worked fine, but I would definitely double the amount of basil next time.

I added about 1 1/2 cups additional basil. I am not sure if my basil wasn't as flavorful as most, but it definitely needed more than the three cups listed. It tastes really good. I still like Pesto with pine nuts the best, though.

Yum!!! I would use less oil next time. First day was strangely tart. But, once it mellowed in the fridge for a day or two, this was delicious. Also... incredibly easy to make.

My first time to make pesto, and this recipe was a hit!  Served with baked chicken.    Agree with others that it needs  much less oil.  I didn't add any salt or pepper.  So easy and so good, I will be making this frequently!

Not a bad recipe. I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup (which turned out to be plenty), used only 1 cup of walnuts (also plenty), 3 cloves of garlic, and 2 tbsp of parmesan. Added juice from 1/2 a lemon to give it a little kick. I'm giving it a four because I originally wanted to make only half the amount called for--problem was that it tasted so oily that I had to run to the grocery store for more basil to remedy it. So I ended up making 4 servings anyway.

Great tasting sauce, but I found it to be a bit gritty because of the walnuts.  It may just be a result of my old food processor though.

Everything worked out great.  I advise against over salting (guilty over here), and look forward to making it again with a lighter hand with the shaker.  Admittedly, I used the pine nuts as I was skeptical of the walnuts.  I'll give the walnuts a go and re-review.

i don't have a food processor... yet, so i just used the blender that was available.  this was tasty.  i only made for one though because i'm usually the only one in the family who's tongue is cultured.  i'll make sure i share this with someone who loves pasta as much as i do.  by the way, i added baby scallops, and didn't add the walnuts right away.  i tasted both version, and i prefer the one without.

Tastes great! It was a little thick, so I added some lemon juice to thin it out and to preserve it better. I used pine nuts and it was yummy tossed with penne.. I will definitely make this again.

This is pretty much the way I make my pesto, but I use 1 cup of pine nuts instead of walnuts. And add an extra clove of garlic. Really good!

Awesome!!  I added about 1/2 tbsp of the pasta water to make the pesto less thick.  The taste was really great.  Thank you!!

My only problem w/ this recipe was finding such a large quantity of fresh basil.  I had to cut the recipe to a third, which worked fine.  It's DELICIOUS.  I used it for the Easy Pasta Fusili recipe.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I never made pesto before but I had all the ingredients so I thought why not give it a shot.  I scaled the recipe down to serve 2 and it was more than plenty for 2 servings.  It's delicious! and I'll definitely make it again.

Very good recipe.  I used pine nuts myself, but I am sure the walnuts would make a good substitute if you need to save several dollars.  Also, I used 2/3 cup of olive oil only, and in the future I think I will take the suggestion of substituting broth for some of the olive oil.  Thanks for sharing it!

Cutting the Olive Oil amount in half was a great move.  If you want to add something instead of salt, I tried marinated sundried tomatoes and it tasted D-VINE!

This recipe was very easy. I used it with penne pasta, chicken and sun dried tomatoes and it was delicious! Instead of using walnuts I used pine nuts.  Yummy! Definitely make it again, my husband absolutely loved it. Thanks for the easy recipe!

I found that this recipe is a little too greasy for my tastes.  It also didn't have enough of a basil flavor, and the amount of garlic was also overpowering.  It also really didn't taste like pesto-- only the aftertaste that came about five minutes later actually tasted like pesto. I was very disappointed.

This is the first pesto sauce I have tried.  I didn't have walnuts or pine nuts, so I tried almonds.  It was excellent! It was a little oily, so I may replace some of the oil with vegetable stock like another reviewer suggested.

I made this today for a pasta salad for a cookout. I used pinenuts instead of walnuts and only used 3/4 c. olive oil. It was delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Simple, just the way it should be.  I added cherry tomatoes that I had roasted in the oven with olive oil and s/p for 20 min.  Great vegetarian recipe.

This was my very first time making pesto and I'm SO glad I chose to start out with this recipe!  It was oh-so-easy and so very good; I'm definitely adding it to my All Stars recipe box.  I used toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts and we LOVED the flavor.  Hubby was very careful so as to not leave any pesto behind; I tried to ignore the finger-licking. :)

This was great! I used pecans instead of walnuts, but the result was good. I like to serve it cold with bowtie pasta. Very easy.
