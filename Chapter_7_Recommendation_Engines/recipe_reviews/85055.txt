I have been making this soup for many years, my husband is Mexican and he and our 3 children love it.  My recipe is very similar, I do add some minced garlic and I have used stew meat when the shank was not meaty enough, we like a lot of meat in this. I don't use beef broth but instead I use water and beef stock base.  Also cumin is a must in this recipe at least a teaspoon or two.  I have also frozen this with great results, it does make a lot! Be sure to add the cilantro near the end of cooking and be sure to squeeze lime juice into your individual bowl before eating with a handful of corn tortillas.

And 5 more stars! This recipe has the best directions I've seen on this site! Remember, this soup is supposed to have chunks of veggies, so don't go crazy chopping everything into little morsels! This makes ALOT of soup...maybe 8 Aztec warriors could polish this off, but, heck, it get's better every day. I used 1 beef shank and 1 lb of boneless short rib meat cut into 1/2 cubes. I love the chayote, but if you can't find it, substitute 2 med. zucchini chunked, but don't put this in until you add the cabbage or it will over cook. I used 4 chunks of frozen corn-on-the-cob defrosted for the fresh corn. My only change was to also add 1 8oz. can of tomato sauce and a packet of Goya Sazon (if you read any of my reviews, it seems to find it's way into most everything).  All you need for a complete meal is corn bread or garlic bread (yeah, excuse me for mixing ethnicities, but if it tastes good, do it!!) Thanks again for a fabulous recipe and for your attention to detailed instruction!

MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS RECIPE...BUT HE EATS IT WITH A FRESH JALAPENO DICED FINE TO ADD IN TO YOUR BOWL AT SERVING TIME AND A SQUIRT OF LIME IN THE BROTH! ALSO WE USE TOMATO SAUCE OR FRESH TOMATOES IN IT THIS DEPENDS ON THE SEASONS...WE DONT USE THE PICKLED JALAPENOS,AND WE ADD THE FRESH CILANTRO INTO THE SOUP AND THE END OF COOKING WHILE HEATING UP THE CORN TORTILLAS!BUT I NEED TO SAY THAT A SPRINKLE OF SALT AND A SQUEEZE OF LIME ON YOUR TORTILLA BEFORE YOU ROLL IT UP GIVES IT THAT ULTIMATE TASTE OF MEXICO!!!

Growing up in a large Mexican family in Texas, this was the "Sunday" soup of my childhood.  My grandmother made this every Sunday for the family.  We ate it with warm corn tortillas, sliced avacados and fresh salsa.  None of us were fond of cilantro or chayote, so they were never in our caldo pot.  Thanks for sharing the recipe...it brings back some wonderful memories!!!

The butcher recommended beef ribs which turned out amazingly moist and flavorful.  This recipe is delicious.  Will be making it again and freezing some this time.

My husband is mexican and he thought this tasted just like his mom's (big compliment)! This is a definite saver. This type of soup is really good with chicken and fish also (just change the stock that is used).

Great recipe, I live in Chicago where we have an abundance of great Mexican restaurants, and my pals all think this is the best they've ever had!

I used the beef shank bone, but also added 1lb of finely chopped beef.  When I added the stock, I also threw in two cloves of slightly crushed garlic.  

Instead of using just cold water, I added 2 additional cans of stock, 3 cups water, and two packets of tomato & cilantro Sayzon.

I'll be making this again and again!

Very delicious and authentic.  I substituted the salt for two cubes of Knorr brand beef bullion cubes.  I also added two large fresh chopped tomatoes instead of the canned ones(since my grandmother used to make it that way).  I used large chunks of beef stew meat (boneless) as well.

I'm a black woman.  My husband is Mexican and grew up in a traditional mexican (food wise) house hold. He told me about a beef soup that his grandma would make and it had squash, corn, tomatoes, etc! So I researched.  I found this recipe and made it for him as a surprise (hoping and praying that it was what he was yearning for. When he tasted this Caldo de Res, he said it brought him back to his younger days. He felt that it was just as good as his grandma used to make it. He invited his brothers and sisters over and they all loved it. This recipe is a keeper for my Mexican! Thanx ALOT!

This is similar to the caldo recipe that was handed down in my husband's family. The only difference is their recipe doesnt include tomatoes. Very good on a cold winter day. It is also easy to make in a crock pot. Just skip browning the beef and onions if you are in a hurry, throw all the ingredients together into a crock pot and let it cook on high for  8 hours.

This recipe is excellent, very authentic!  Authentic Caldo de Res is not supposed to be spicy.  I used 3 lbs. of beef shank and boiled it for about 4 hours until it fell off the bones.  Then I scooped out the bones and trimmed most of the fat.  I sauted 2 cloves of chopped garlic with the onion and added about 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.  I used small ears of frozen corn and skipped the chayote and used 3 potatoes.  Next time I think I will throw in a zucchini.  I served this with warm flour tortillas, some Mexican rice and homemade chile'.  My husband LOVED it!  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Amazing 5 start recipe BUT please note that I made a few changes of my own. First I used 2-1/2 lbs of beef stew cubed meat instead of the beef shank. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder to the meat as it browned in addition to salt and pepper and I used 1 tbsp onion powder since my husband doesn't like onions.  I also used 3 cans of beef broth and a bit of water to cover the meat and 1/8 tap cumin. 4 cups water, added 2 extra potatoes, 2 zucchini instead of chayotes and 1 extra carrot. Oh and added 1/4 tap garlic salt for taste preference. I didn't make any of the toppings because we just ate it with some spanish rice and a bit of Louisiana. All in all took about 3 hours and AMAZING! This was SO good it exceeded my expectations. Great hearty soup. I made this on a cold, rainy Sunday at about 3 and we ate ate it for the rest of the day! It was that good. Thank you for sharing!

This was delicious!  I live in a border town and get to eat authentic mexican food and this recipe is as good as I have had.  I didn't have chayotes and  Cumin is a must in mexican dishes, so I added 2 tsp. when I added the onion.  If you have spanish rice on hand, add it to your bowl when serving.  I'm so glad to have a Caldo recipe!  It's a keeper.  Thank you!!

This was wonderful!  My Hispanic friend made this for me before but I didn't get the recipe.  This was very close, though I don't think she uses tomatoes.  I couldn't find beef shank so I used about a lb of beef marrow soup bones and then another pound or so of beef stew meat.  I also added jalapeno when I put in the corn and potatoes to give it a little kick and a bit of cumin as the other reviewers suggested.  The flavor was superb, the broth to die for.  The SO raved about it though he didn't "get" the corn cob in there.  "What's that for? It's like soup but with a big chunk of corn in there."  I disagree and love the idea that while eating and slurping such deliciousness one can take a break and eat one of my all time favorite things: corn on the cob!  Fantastic, five stars all the way.

All I can say is ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE!!!  This was not only the most beautiful soup I've ever made, but by far the most tasty!  The lime and cilantro really make this soup, otherwise it just tastes like vegetable beef soup.  Cumin as well is a necessity.  Makes a lot, but so good.  Looking forward to leftovers, as I'm sure when the flavors sit overnight, will be even more delicious!

Just like my grandma used to make!  It does taste better and better every day, and saving the corn on the cob for the last is the best part !  We never put potato in ours, used squash instead. I did  add 2 tsp cumin, and used Rotel tomatoes.  Hadn't had chayotes in years, they give just a slight bit of sweet.  Serviced with fresh cilantro, lime and fresh jalapenos if you like some spice.  Thank you for this recipe, haven't had good caldo in many years and can't wait to make it again !

"Weston Price style:" use beef bone broth made separately; use tallow for frying onions; add up to four chopped roasted (and peeled) poblano peppers at the very end; garnish well with lime juice at the end.
If you strip half the corn kernels from cobs and cut the rest of the cobs into 1" wide wheels, the soup thickens up as it cools and is easier top eat for potluckers. Also, try using fresh tomatoes not canned. Excellent!

This was good, but a bit bland before adding in salt, cumin and a few other spices. The meat turned out super tender and tasty, but the broth was really disappointing. I used frozen cut corn on the cobbs and didn't like that either. Too messy. Maybe next time I'll use just regular kernals instead.

I wish I could back up the other reviews, but this came out completely bland. I used no water and all beef broth, but after adding bouillon cubes, salt, cayenne, garlic, cumin, etc., nothing could make this a yummy soup. I did cook this in a crockpot, but I still browned the meat and onions first, which should have helped boost the taste. After two days of sitting (that usually increases flavor) it was still bland. If you like strong flavors, this may not be for you. Thanks anyway.

I made this recipe exactly like it says and it was GREAT!  The only thing that I would change is add a little bit more meat and slice the cabbage up in smaller pieces.  Definately a keeper, I will make it again real soon.

This is a comforting, down home beef stew.  There's no spice or seasoning other than the beef and vegetable flavor.  Some would call it bland, but I call it comforting.  Not all Mexican dishes are loaded with spice.

This was sort of a "potpourri" soup. Some of this and some of that. Loved all the veggies. I cut the recipe in half and it still made enough for 8 so I'm putting some in freezer for later.

Wonderful on a cold winters night!  I did as suggested and cooked the meat for 2-3 hours.  Meat fell off bones!  I like it a little spicier so I used a can of Rotel instead of plain tomatoes.  Worked wonderful.  Had leftovers for almost a week!  Will def make again...probably next weekend!  :>)

I really like this soup - it is easy, I really didn't change anything except add some cumin, and I pulled the fat off the bones before I cooked them. What makes it good is the fresh ingredients added at the last. I left the corn on the cob and cut it into thirds like it said, it's like a little extra treat when you're through eating the soup. It is mild flavored - not spicy. The only thing I didn't add was the radishes, only because I forgot to buy them.

I make this in the crockpot and add 3-4 tbsp of butter to the pot.  I serve it with fresh-squeezed lime and lemon.  It is just like my favorites "mom-n-pop" Mexican restaurant here in Texas. We love it!

This recipe is very much like what I grew up -- really yummy with one necessary change:  to HAVE really tender meat (edible, actually) you have to let the meat simmer for 3 - 4 hours.  If you made this soup and enjoyed it when barely cooked meat, then you'll love it them its falling off the bone!

I made this as written and it was delicious.  In the future, because I will make this again, I will use a bag of frozen corn instead of on the cob.  I will use 1/2 the cabbage and cut it and the zucchini into smaller pieces.  I will double the cilantro added to the soup, add additional stew meat, and  2 packets sazon. Wow, I know it seems like I am changing alot but really these changes will not alter the flvor of this delicious soup.  It will make it less messy to eat and my son likes extra meat.  Thank you for sharing a great soup.

This is a great recipe because you don't need to change much. I used 1 lb of beef shanks (on the bone) and 1 lb of lean stew meat.   Since I used a pressure cooker, I adjusted the recipe to 4 cups of beef broth. Basically, I followed other pressure cooker stew recipes by dredging the meat in seasoned flower, then browning in batches. Next, I sauted the onions and garlic. After the onions were browned, I added the diced tomatoes and beef broth. Cooked it for 15 minutes after it pressured, then added the veggies and cooked for another 10 minutes.   It was thicker than most people may like it, so a few cups of water could have been added as well. I personally like thicker soups, so loved the flavor.

Mom made this for us growing up.  I've revised using short ribs and any cut of roast on sale.  Just ask the butcher to cut into stew meat.  I also add celery stalks and bay leaf.  Cumin is also necessary.  I used wedges of cabbage at the end and zucchini squash and it turns into a robust vegetable beef soup.  Don't forget the corn on the cob, I keep some in the freezer.  One more tip, we sometimes serve on top of a scoop of white rice if we don't have enough soup.  Deelicious

Make sure the potatoes are cut in small pieces so they can cook better, and next time i would put them a little earlier.

I also added the knorr suiza seasoning and some cumin.

This is a great recipe!

This soup was AMAZING!  My boyfriend rated it as "best ever," and that says a lot because we make a lot of soup in our household.  The only thing I changed was adding some extra broth because I like brothier soups.  This is one I'll make again and again!!

This soup is fantastic as is and is well-deserved of 5 stars.  I kicked it up a notch by adding half a teaspoon each of chipotle powder and cumin.  I had also made a roast the day before which I diced and used as the meat.  This will likely become a staple soup.  Thanks!

This was great. My boyfriend is from Mexico and was impressed. I made a few minor changes...I used beef necks instead of shanks, added a little pressed garlic, a teaspoon of cumin, and diceds japs. Also I made this in the crockpot!! =] I just added the corn, cabbage, and potatoes in the last 45 minutes. 5 stars! Thanks

Delicious!  I use beef chuck cut into big chunks. I also make my own salsa to spoon into the soup. Serve with hot flour tortillas.  Tastes better the next day.

Excellent recipe, but next time I think I would add a little more meat.

This is sooooooo good!  The recipe says to serve the bones in your bowl but I pulled those out and the round fat and gristle that were attached to the bone.  They just were not look appetizing and I was already throwing a new dish to my family.  I cooked pretty much as the recipes said with only the addition of some cumin (as other reviewers suggested) and a can of the HOT rotel.  That one can gave the whole soup a nice kick.  Plus, I probably added to the cooking time quit a bit just making sure my meat and then the veggies were tender.  I used all the toppings suggested, I didn't need the jalepeno though because of the rotel.  Was really surprised at how good the squeeze of lime complimented the dish.  This is an excellent dish, not typical, very surprising wonderful flavors.

It is best to have a soup base for this soup, as it gives the soup more flavor. Please note, Caldo de Res Actually translates to "beef soup."  This soup is a staple through All of latin america.

This is a wonderful recipe. I didn`t add tomatoes altogether with meat, but later (~30 min. after meat simmering). I didn`t find chayotes, so omitted them. Very good soup, will make again.

I love this soup ! It tastes like the 'Cadillo soup' from my favorite Tex Mex restaurant. So flavorful and delicious ! I topped the soup with crumbled tortilla chips, and my boys loved it ! I didn't use Chayote. Instead I substituted with zucchinis.

I made this last night and my family loved it. Excellent recipe. Probably the best soup I've ever made. I didn't use the beef bone, I used boneless flanken rib meat and cut it into 1/2 inch strips and it came out wonderfully.

My wife is from El Salvador and 2 years ago her aunt made this soup, so about 6 months later I decided I was going to make this soup for the entire family.  This recipe is now a staple in our home and I make it on a regular basis.  This truly is a very user friendly recipe and delivers a wonderful soup that is even better the next day!
Thanks,
John

This was one of my favorite soups growing up. For beef, I use beef short ribs and only use shanks if the short ribs don't have enough meat on them. It gives it a better flavor,but you do need to skim the fat off the soup after it cooks(it's also easily removed after the soup has been placed in the fridge). You need to brown the meat well for flavor before adding any liquid. This is a good Caldo de Res recipe and everyone who loves beef soup should try this at least once.

Absolutely wonderful, we loved it. It was very flavorful and healthy. I did use zucchini in place of the chayotes and used frozen corn instead of corn on the cob. I am sure it would be great either way. Great recipe thanks!

This was out of this world! I substitited zucchini for the chayotes, and added a few seasonings (garlic, cumin, and Goya adobe seasoning). I also added a couple of squirts of lime juice from concentrate to the entire pot. Otherwise, followed to the letter, and it was to die for! I thought my picky eater would turn his nose up because of all the veggies, but he ate two bowls, which is saying a lot for him. Will definitely make again! Thank you!

I was craving this soup, that my grandma used to make when I was a kid. Overall, made for an AMAZING meal that reminded me of cold sunday afternoons spent watching Sabado Gigante with my abuelita. I didn't give it five starts because I thought it was a bit bland when I followed the directions as is.  First off, I couldn't find beef shank at my local big box grocery store, so I went with a small chuck roast augmented with cut beef ribs.  Instead of plain diced tomatoes, I used Del Monte diced tomatoes with green chiles. I also added half a can of tomato sauce when I added the vegetables to give it more color and flavor.  Also, the chayote was too expensive for my taste, so I went with zucchini squash instead.

Delicious... I only had chicken broth but added some beef flavoring in with the meats and it tasted just fine.  Also added a fresh jalapeno and small chile when I put in the cabbage.  The advice many people gave to add 1/4 t cumin was spot-on as well.

I had the bone section from a rib roast and decided to try this recipe, based on the positive previous responses.  I simmered the bones/residual meat in water for 6 hours.  I then pulled the meat from the bones and fat and added just the meat back to the Dutch Oven.  I didn't add the oil nor the salt and pepper but followed the recipe for the most part after that.  I couldn't find pickled jalapenos so I used a fresh jalapeno and a fresh serrano.  I also used frozen corn.  AMAZING!!  Mine was a bit spicy I found a hot hot serrano) but so wonderful.  My hubby also said amazing!!  I saved some for my kids before adding the hot chilis and they love it as well.  This makes A LOT.  I am actually glad there are so many leftovers - THANKS for the delicious recipe.

WOW! Great soup. I made a double batch for our Cooking club dinner.  It was a Mexican theme dinner and had way over 50 people show up. I stayed as close as possible to the recipe but had to make a few changes. I used 20oz of frozen corn instead of cobs. I thought with the small sample bowls the corn on the cob would have been a little unmanageable and used zucchini instead of the chayotes. getting hungry again writing this! I then added about 6 stocks of celery, 3 very large Russet potatoes, half a dozen medium carrots and then added the cabbage. SPICES..... I didn't get too carried away but when I tasted the soup towards the end I felt it just needed something more. I went light on the salt from the beginning just so I could sneak up on it rather than finding out it was too salty. I added about 5 beef bullion cubes (I already had 6 cups of beef broth in the pot) about 2tsps. Chile powder, maybe 1tsps, of cayenne pepper, and about 2 Tbsp. black pepper. It STILL need something. I ended up putting in a tsp of paprika and THAT did it! I should have listened to the one reviewer that said this recipe would fill 8 Aztec warriors. My "doubled" recipe almost filled up my 16qt soup pot!! With over 25 dishes and pupus (Hawaiian for appetizers) there was just too much food! So I ended up bringing almost 2 gallons of soup! Good thing the soup was good and I really love leftovers. I'm sure it will freeze well. I paired this up with some wonderful honey cornbread from this site and got a l

This was a greatttt recipe!! It is perfect just the way it is. I did add 2 cloves of garlic to the pot and some cumin but that is the only thing I did different. I made spanish rice and warmed up some tortillas on the burner and my family ate this soup up!

I agree with the other reviewers who said the recipe needs garlic and cumin.  It is just a basic vegetable soup without those flavor notes.  We also added oregano to give the soup more of a Mexican flavor.    It is a delicious soup but gets four stars becase it lacks "Mexican" seasonings.

This was more flavorful than I expected.  We used stew meat (we are lazy cooks), and it worked well.

This was my first try at Caldo de Res... I was nervous making it.  Hoping it would taste as traditional as my friends family make it.  it was perfect!  i did a little tweaking to suit my family's taste and it was awesome!  thank you so much for this!!! now i don't have to wait until a friend brings it along or buy it at the local Mexican Market!  thanks a bunch

This was wonderful, but I did substitute a few things since I didn't have evrything on hand. I know I chopped my veggies into smaller pieces than the recipe called for. I used leftover roast that I had in the fridge and I used all beef broth instead of water. I really think what makes this outstanding is the fresh lime juice, cilantro and jalapeno peppers which I stirred in just b4 serving. Without these ingredients, it wouldn't be worth making. I will make this again.

I added fresh chopped garlic, a little boullion, an extra potato, an extra carrot, and two extra ears of corn. Instead of a medium/small cabbage, I used a large cabbage. This recipe was incredibly hearty and tasty, but there was less broth than I would like, so I made a second smaller pot of just beef stock, cabbage, and onion and then added it to the original soup pot.  In traditional caldo de res, you wouldnt normally use tomatoes, and while it did add some flavor,  I felt that it didnt taste as authentic.  I would also suggest chopping up one jalapeño and adding it to the soup in the last ten minutes to give it a kick. 

This recipe fed six adults for three meals! I will be making it in the future, but with the amendments described above.

I've been looking for a Caldo recipe for a while now that could mimic the dish I get at my favorite Mexican restaurant and this is it! The few changes I made were adding onion and garlic to the meat when browning, using a can of Rotel  tomatoes and two fresh Roma's, a Tbs. of cumin, chopped 2 fresh jalapenos, and 3 cups of Spanish rice when done. My wife said it was the best soup she's ever had and she's picky about her soup. Don't rush this soup. Take your time and let the flavors do their magic.

I am  Mexican and was looking for Caldo de Res the way my mom and aunts make it ( I had tried calling them but nobody answered) I was a bit skeptical to try this recipe but I'm glad I did. I saw that this recipe calls out for chayote and decided that  was enough to try. 

I would not change anything in this soup, except, maybe add chopped jalapeno when done.

I made this soup as written, except I substituted beef short ribs (couldn't find beef shank with much of any meat on the bone). Although it calls for a lot of ingredients, I thought the end result was well worth the effort. It's is a terrific soup! I reminds me a lot of Vietnamese Pho. In fact, I'd bet adding basil leaves, mung beans and sriracha sauce would be great. Kind of a Mexican Pho.

Too much work for a rather normal flavor.  Plus, nobody liked the work involved with the corn.

YUM! I used frozen ear corn- fresh in February was just too much money. The chayote was great in it!  I did add a bit of cumin to the meat while I was frying it- but that is my family's tastes.

This was fantastic.  I used boneless short ribs (wish I had trimed off some of the fat) and added the mexican spice packet as someone suggested and some Huy Fong chili garlic sauce (key to make it spicy).
I served it at a soup party (without the chili sauce)and received a number of first place votes- I am entering it next year WITH the chili sauce and I think I have a good shot at winning.
I make soup all the time and this one is really, really fantastic (and SUPER easy!)

this soup is fabulous.  i've made it several times - omitting the salt and chayotes.  love, love, love this soup.  making it in a few weeks for halloween party and i'm sure it'll be a hit as usual.  serve with sliced avacado and tortillas.

This recipe turned out delicious.  I had to use beef short rib bones and stew meat instead of the shank.  No grocery stores in my town have the shank available.  That's another story!!!  The longer the caldo sits, the more the flavors pop.  Absolutely heartwarming on a cool-rainy day.

I loved it  
i was born and raised in Mexico city, my mom used to  make it like this but spicy and red , with zuchinis and green beans,  
this is the closer i can get to that, my wife loved it and we will make it for mom when she comes to visit  
i did not change a thing because if i did then i would write my own recipe right?
Don't forget the fresh tortillas and avocados though.
Felicidades muy rico y delicioso

The key to this recipe is to do everything in stages and slow the process down.  I browned 1 pound of stew meat (I couldn't find meaty bones) and then added the onion until soft.  I added one regular can of stewed tomatoes and one 32 ounce can (4 cups) of beef broth and simmered that for 2 hours.  While that was simmering, in a separate pot, I had some small marrow bones (about 6),and simmered those in 4 cups of water  I skimmed the fat and the scum and added all that liquid to the soup pot.  Then, I added 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of garlic salt.  I also added 6 peppercorns and still added a little more garlic salt and pepper.  Then, I added 4 carrots (1 inch pieces) and 2 stalks of celery sliced about 1/2 inch and simmered that for 20 minutes.  Then, I added 4 medium-sized red potatoes cut into 8ths and 2 ears of corn cut into thirds and simmered that for 20 minutes.  Then, I added 2 zucchini cut into 1 inch slices (instead of chayotes) and a very small head of cabbage that was cored and cut into 2 inch pieces then simmered that in the soup for 20 minutes. I did not add cilantro because some people do not like it.  I took some to the nice neighbor lady who has been so kind to us and she called me back in about a half hour to tell me how good the soup was, especially the little corn on the cob that was still a little crunchy and oh so good.  Phenomenal recipe.

My husband asked me to make a soup since we were having some cold days...well I followed this recipe and it came out beyond good. My husband said I nailed it the first time ?? and that it was beyond restaurant quality ?? I ? it myself ... I'm proud of myself really, it was amazingly good ?? I added squash, celery and boneless meat...perfect! Thank you for the tips and tricks.

I love cocido (caldo de res) and have been searching for a good recipe for years! I'm African American but dated a Mexican man whose mother made this all the time and I must say this is as good as hers. I did use 3 different types of meat (1 pound each) of beef shank, short ribs and chuck. I browned the meat and once I added the onion, tomatoes and broth, I let it all simmer for 2 hours so that the meat was undeniably tender. Otherwise, every thing else was followed precisely. I will make this again and again!! Thanks for an easy to follow recipe!

I agree with CK about a better meat choice as has been our family's tradition.. Shank and oxtails may impart flavor to the broth, but neither tastes as delicious as when with meaty beef short ribs...a bit pricier, but well worth it.  The broth is richer in flavor as well. One other suggestion, add chunks of your favorite squash at  the final ten minutes.

Been a while since I made this soup so came here to have my mind refreshed. This is very close to how I make it, except I use stewed canned tomatoes and a beef bouillon cube instead of the beef broth. I also like to blend a potato in water and add it for thickness. This is a very good recipe, some don't have the step of frying up the meat which makes a huge differnce. Excellent recipe, yields a great flavor soup that the whole family can appreciate. 
Don't understand the reviews complaining about all that is involved, I guess I am just used to cooking because the steps take me about 20 mins, and once it is simmering there is plenty of time to clean up or write reviews before having to add the veggies. 
Oh I add cumin sometimes and serve it up with tortillas.

This  recipe is fantastic right off the paper.
You can eliminate some of the steps and time from the 10 minutes here 10 minutes there by just turning the stove off at the end and let it finish out the cooking process on its own as it cools and fuses the flavors together.

This soup was delicioso! (I left out the pickled jalapenos.) The meat was seriously fatty, but tasted great. Next time I will use more broth and water so that I can add more potatoes and the whole head of cabbage. I ran out of room and could only stuff >half of the cabbage down into the soup. And the cabbage was soooo good. This soup tastes FANTASTIC, next day!

I'm Guatemalan, and this is one of our dishes that i grew up eating. My mom has made it for years and I love it. I have no idea what her recipe is, because its always a pinch of this a bit of that ya know, no specific instructions. And I need exact measurements :) So i googled and found this. It came out perfectly, exactly like my moms. I added 1 packet of sazon goya and some sazonador. I'd recommended doing 5 cups of water instead of 4, and I used beef ribs. It was fabulous. You of course NEED to add fresh squeezed lime as a garnish to your own bowl to make it perfect and don't forget to have some avocados and rice! i just used steamed white rice! I like to dip it in to my bowl by the spoonful. This recipes is a keeper! :)

Pretty nice. The lime is essential for flavour, do NOT skip it. Also, I have no idea what chayotes are but I subbed zucchini and it wasn't very good, they were a little bitter, maybe it was just the particular zucchini that I used, but I think it would be fine to just skip altogether.

I love this recipe....I use 1lb beef shank and 2lbs beef oxtails (we like a lot of meat) and I add a 14oz pkg of roasted diced tomatoes with garlic and a teaspoon of minced garlic as well. I skip the jalapeño and I like To add a teaspoon of cumin. 
I top it off w more cilantro, diced onion, and lime juice at the end in each bowl and I  fry up a batch of corn cakes (fried cornbread that looks like a pancake)  instead of tortillas....Delish!!

This has been my favorite soup growing up. I do add cumin approximately 2 t and squash if you wish.  I also make some Mexican rice and add to the bowl and ladle the soup over it. Add a squeeze of lime and voila! It is delicious!

Did not include the radishes or the chayotes, but it turned out great!  I like the heavy black pepper flavor - that could be tapered back a bit if needed.

Great recipe! I’ve made this several times and tweaked it along the way.

Tweaks:
1. season beef with cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Add minced garlic when you add the onions.
2. I also use Better than Bullion beef paste for extra flavor (and salt!) add some when browning the meet and add some to the broth while cooking. It makes a WORLD of difference in the heartiness of the broth!! Beef Bullion would work too.
3. Add one yellow squash and one zucchini.

My husband is Chicago, but comes from a huge Mexican family. He love this soup ! I have also tasted him mom’s version and I like this one just the same , I just didn’t use limes and jalapeños on the side because he doesn’t like them ! Very tasty and added the veggies at different stages makes the whole dish tasty and different textures as you eat

Ate this at a restaurant.  Had to learn how to make it.  It is fabulous!  Made the broth using bones for a rich flavor and refrigerated it.  The next day added the squash and corn and served to guests.

Just made this soup today and it came out absolutely delicious!  The only thing I left out was the can of tomatoes. I felt the tomatoes would take away flavor from the meat and broth. But other than that it turned out very good! ???? My boyfriend loved it! This soup is perfect for winter season to help you stay warm.

Phenomenal Caldo. Used Better Than Bouillon Beef as stock, short ribs because my market did haven’t shank and reduced salt a tad bit. Seared then Simmered meat for 3 1/2 hours and it fell right off the bone. Family was impressed.

I make it all the time.  I find it is much easier to cut the meat off the bone after it's been cooked.  You need only add the veggies and spices you like and still get a great tasting soup!

Turned out delicious. I didn’t have beef stock, so I just used water.   Didn’t have chayote, so I omitted. Still flavor was quite authentic.

Great soup. I used shoulder instead. Keeping it cooking a little longer made the meat so tender. I also put yuca and calamari in it. For the wife. ‘‘Twas a delight. Mix it up and put items you love in it and make it your own!

First Caldo de Res of the cold season! I make this every year once or twice per year. It is a labor of love because it takes so long to prep. Especially when you are making it for 12-16 people! 

Regardless of how long it take, it’s well worth it because it tastes almost as good as my dad’s Caldo de Res! And he was a cook! A really amazing cook!

I've saved this as a Favorite go-to recipe because it's very good and similar to the way I always make caldo de res. 
I use the beef shanks along with additional stew meat and brown both first before adding the onion and 4 cloves of garlic. I season the meat with Badia Sazon Completa. After adding tomatoes and broth, I add a teaspoon, or slightly more, of cumin, coriander, Mexican oregano, and Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning along with 2 bay leaves.  When I add additional water, I put a few shakes of Knorr's powdered chicken bouillon and sometimes toward the end I add torn corn tortillas for flavor and thickening.

I absolutely loved how easy this recipe was, and how maleable. If you don't want to take time cutting onions, you could put in salsa since you're adding tomatoes and peppers anyway. Also, SUPER delish with oxtail!

I'm a complete novice, but this came out perfect, especially the corn and cabbage!

I was going for the same flavor and consistency that our local restaurant serves on weekends. Ommitted corn and cabbage, but added sliced zucchini. WOW! The overall flavor and the texture of the meat is just as delicious if not even more so as the soup from the restaurant. Very easy to make too! Yum!!!

No matter where I went, no Caldo De Res was ever as good as my grandmother’s recipe, which was passed down to my mother and unto me to serve to my kiddos.  That is, until I came across this little baby.  How am I going to break the news?  Guess I’ll just have to make it all over again, invite mom over, and let her rate it herself.  

This one is definitely a winner!

Turned out great. Do recommend keeping the potatoes in large pieces. Too small and they break down and get mushier over time.

This was so delicious, I followed step by step. The only thing I did differently to give it more flavor was used all beef broth and I didn't add any water. I also added minced garlic while heating the onions. I also squeeze lime into it when serving. DELICIOUS!!

I loved this recipe! I did add cumin and ground red pepper and more broth for my personal preference and it was amazing! It seems like a lot of prep but it really isn’t. I couldn’t find a beef shank so I used a beef chuck tender roast. I am guessing it took me just as long to cut it down into the sizes I wanted as it would have cutting the meat off the shank. As for the rest, just a lot of chopping! Also, use fresh corn on the cob. I read reviews where they said it came out mushy. Fresh is the way to go!

Muy sabroso!  I made this dish specifically for my Wife and our Nanny (both of whom are from Tampico).  They loved it! They had seconds and it is being eaten again for lunch.   It was a perfect dish for this cold front that blew in.

I  upped all of the ingredients for a bigger batch.  Glad I did.  The next day, I added 4 more cups of broth as to extend the soup.  This had no effect on the flavor and even better the second time around.

Great recipe.  I have been making caldo ever since I lived in El Paso and discovered it--I ended up having it for lunch almost every day, with tortillas, served in a little restaurant across the street from where I worked.  I used this recipe as a refresher because I had not made caldo for about a year and did not want to leave anything out.  It's very, very good!

It is not that much work, but it does sit on the stove for a long time.  I agree with others that garlic and cumin add a nice layer of flavors.  Do not forget the lime for acidity!  Not being much of a meat eater,  I liked that the soup is predominantly vegetables.   During the harvest it is easy to use all of the available vegetables from the garden.  The only thing I needed from the store was the beef, beef stock, and the lime!

Really tasty, authentic caldo.   I added green beans and mushrooms for personal taste and loved the flavor.   Makes enough to share with a friend and still have plenty for myself.   Thanks for the recipe

I thought it was a little bland even though I added cumin,  garlic and A veggie spice blend with pepper flakes. To make it more Honduran, I added yucca and malanga. Overall it was good and I will make it again.

This is a little time consuming, but is well worth the effort.  I made it on a lazy, rainy Sunday afternoon to serve at lunch the next day at my office and got so many compliments!  Definitely going to keep, print, save this recipe.  I don't ever want to lose it!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I don't eat meat (not for any reason in particular, just don't), but the photo of this soup was just so beautiful I had to try it. I used portobello mushrooms instead of beef and followed the recipe's instructions for cooking the beef, just with mushrooms. It smelled like a hamburger was cooking with the onions - very yummy. I also didn't have enough jalapeno and they were out at the store, so I used a poblano pepper instead, which seemed to balance out the spiciness from the jalapeno. I also used a "California Jewel" potato, which tasted like a mild sweet potato, which really seemed to brighten up the flavor. Definitely saving this one for the future.

I found this soup to be quite bland. I did add Sazon tomato , garlic powder, and cumin. It was better, but I would definitely follow some of the other comments rather than the actual recipe.

Thank you LKonis!!!  My Mexican husband was always asking me to make a soup "with everything in it", like his mom made.  He gave me some guidelines, like meat, potatoes and "stuff".  I knew as soon as I found your recipe, in 2010, this was it!!!   He LOVES it.  Sorry not to have reviewed before because it's always well received!   Cannot thank you enough!!! If you are trying to match a "mom's" recipe, try this one - it will work!

Love it! I've been making this caldo for the last 3 years. Big hit here. I do have to say I use beef short ribs instead of a beef shank. 

When I serve this everyone can add what they like into this soup. My husband loves lime juice and radishes, I love extra onions & jalapeños. 

Wonderful recipe.

"I made it" and it turned out to be quite good. In addition to the recipe, i added a little bit of Hoisin sauce and a couple of teaspoons of sriracha sauce to spice things up a bit. This is my personal preference as i like EVERYTHING spicy. I posted a picture of this and by looking at it, you will be able to tell that this will not only clear sinuses, it will make you come back for more!

I absolutely adore this soup...it's so delicious...it's incredible how flavorful it is....in regards to the recipe, I cheated and used stew meat beef instead...to compensate for the flavor loss (from not using the meat with bone) I added a beef bullion cube....came out awesome...thank you for the recipe!

Awesome soup!!! Very easy to make. My dad (Hispanic) told me he was in the mood for "Caldo." I didn't have a recipe that I use. I usually just throw all the ings. together and that's it. I'm glad I decided to try something different from what I usually make for him. It's one of the best soups I've ever had. I can't wait for my dad to get here to try it - he's bringing the jalapenos.

This soup is DELICIOUS, coming from an Hispanic family they tend to make a lot of sopa de res, but this one is just amazing who would've thought of adding canned tomatoes to it? Not me but I'm glad I came across this recipe. Only thing I would say is the soup doesn't have a lot of flavor so I added some beef seasoning to it so enhance the flavor and it turned out good! I was looking at other reviews I came across with a lot of them saying add garlic and cumin... Glad I did turned out very delicious this is a must try recipe that I will surely be making again!

Great recipe. I made it as written (although I did add a can of tomato sauce) and my whole family, including my 5-year-old, loved it.

Great recipe and well laid out and explained as another reviewer also wrote. I did a couple things a bit different. I didn't brown the meat first (I usually do and yes it makes a difference). I threw everything but the chayote in to the slow cooker and left it on low. :) Enjoy this is a good one!

Sooooo good!  I added some garlic cloves and smoked chipotle chili powder to it, and extra cilantro.  Also, didn't have the corn on the cob, so I just added frozen corn.  YUM.  Definitely making this again!!!!

It was my first time trying this and I must say that it was delicious. Almost as good as my mothers! Tip: as butcher for beef shank bone & add it for extra flavor.
