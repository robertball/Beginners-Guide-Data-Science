I absolutely love peanut butter and chocolate and both together, this is a must for anyone who feels the same. Save yourself some time and money and just buy crunchy peanut butter (unless you want peanuts to sprinkle on top) I thought it was too much peanuts so i didn't do that or sprinkle the cookie pieces on top and it was delicious!

This was really good...only reason I give it four stars is b/c it was nearly impossible to get out of my pie plate...and I think it may be ruined now. I used the deep dish pie plate from pampered chef so the plate itself could have been the problem Could have been my fault too. 
As for the pie itself, I used more ice cream and peanut butter than called for and didn't add the peanuts or put the cookies on top. It was perfect with Recee's peanut butter chocolate sauce and a dollop of whipped cream.

This is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my life, and I never would have thought to use cookie dough as a pie crust! It's a little tough to cut, but it's worth it.
