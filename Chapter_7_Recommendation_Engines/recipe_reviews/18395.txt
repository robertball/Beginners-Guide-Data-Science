I have tested and tried many of the tea recipies such as this one.  It can be called russian tea, friendship tea, orange tea.  I call it Christmas Tea.  
With the help of this recipe, I think I have perfected it this year (I give it as gifts every year).  
I never add the extra sugar-it makes it too sweet for me and those who request it from me.  You can always add to the instructions that they may sweeten it to their liking.  I did add a little touch of my own that made it devine this year.  I tripled the recipe and added a 9.5 oz bag EACH of red hot candies and lemonheads into the mix-after mixing the rest of the ingredients.  Then using a canning funnel, I pack the mix into 1/2 pint, pint and quart jars, depending on where they are going to.
SIMPLY DEVINE!  This will be my Christmas Tea recipe from now on!

Make sure you use instant tea without sugar.  If you use instant tea with sugar omit the 1 cup of sugar called for in the recipe.  This tea is great to warm you up on those cold winter days.

Tasty and comforting, especially when you're chilled or have a sore throat. Also nice (and inexpensive) to package in a decorative container and give as gifts.

Maybe I'm not the brightest, but for those of you who may have been confused too, instant tea=instant iced tea (I was scouring the grocery store looking for plain instant tea!).  This recipe tastes just the way my mom made it.  I left out the sugar and I found it the right level of sweetness.

Great recipe. I made this every year for   Christmas. I found it easier to mix in a gallon ziplock bag.

I HAVE MADE THIS TEA FOR YEARS AND IT IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE! I EVEN USED WHEN I WAS PREGNANT TO CURB THE MORNING SICKNESS...WHEN YOU HAVE A COLD OR COUGH OR SORE THROAT, THIS IS ALWAYS A GREAT REMEDY...TRY IT, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!! AS SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS NOTED IT IS ALSO A PERFECT AND INEXPENSIVE CHRISTMAS GIFT...AND YOU CAN USE SPLENDA IN THE PLACE OF SUGAR AND IT TASTES THE SAME. I WILL TRY ADDING THE CANDIES THIS YEAR AS I LOVE THE LEMONY AND SPICY FLAVORS OF BOTH...BUT, I MAY TRY LAYERING JUST FOR A PLEASING EFFECT WHEN GIVING AS GIFTS IN THE GLASS JARS!!! THANKS SO MUCH!!!

I have had Russian Tea before and was craving some. I looked up this recipe and made it for my boyfriend and I. I was very dissapointed and it was nasty. So, I'll be looking for a different Russian Tea recipe I guess.

For my tastes, too sweet.  When I knocked out the added 1 cup of sugar - it was grand.

The caterer at my husband's Christmas party served an incredible iced orange and cinnamon tea, but none of them could tell me exactly what was in it. I was told they made their own mix and one bartender clued me in that there was Tang in the mix. I randomly came across a Russian Tea recipe on AR that same night! I knew this had to be it, and it is! I omitted the sugar since my tea was sweetened already. Yum! I prefer it iced.

Although I don't feel the need for the additional plain sugar, this is more like the ratio I expect in russian Tea, I use a 1:1 ratio in my RT, whereas others on this site use as low as 4:1. Also a fair bit more cinnamon adds deliciocity.

For those that said it tasted nasty: what instant iced tea did you use? I’ve made it 3 tines now. The second time I made it I used Nescafé instant tea...nasty!! I use Lipton with excellent results. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Back in the last century, people inspired by the orange instant drink mix began making Russian tea. The instant mixes combined with the spices is a refreshing beverage served either hot or cold. I stumbled across the recipe several days ago and could hardly wait to make some. I used instant tea with lemon flavor and sugar free orange drink mix for my recipe. I added the spices and combined all the ingredients. It still tastes as good as I remembered. I will make some for gifts this holiday season.

I thought it was delicious. It was even better when I added a dash of ginger for when someone has an upset stomach.

Very easy to make and very tasty!  I'm not a fan of tea - my husband can't get me to drink the stuff - but I had to taste-test this one, as it used my favorite drink (TANG).  I actually liked it!  Very yummy!!!

I am using this mixture for gifts for a baby shower - it filled up 3 pint jars!
