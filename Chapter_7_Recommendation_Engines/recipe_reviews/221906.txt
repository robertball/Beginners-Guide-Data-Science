I made this cake for my daughters graduation party.  It was a big hit.  Everyone loved it.  People that didn't want cake had one taste and they were asking for seconds.  I recommend everyone must try this at least once in their lifetime you will not be disappointed.  I don't do reviews but I had to for this recipe it was that good.

I would give this a 10 star if I could. I did make a few changes.  I wanted a caramel tres leche cake so I added caramel bits, used cool whip instead of making a topping and topped with caramel sauce and more caramel bits.  It seemed to me to take longer to bake than what it said...maybe 40 mins.

How can people give such glowing reviews of your recipe and then turn around and say I made a few changes? It obviously ends up not being your recipe, but their own version of your recipe! How insulting!! I tried this recipe and found it was perfect just the way it is...no changes necessary!!

Good Cake! needed an adjustment on the frosting. 
So I did a trial run of this cake prior to making it for my family's Christmas day dessert. The first batch was ok however I did not like the cream cheese in the frosting. So on the second attempt of the cake excluded the cream cheese and added 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of pineapple juice to the heavy whipping cream. The cake was such a hit! We all ate it and went back for seconds. So good that my Grampa even likes it and he is not a dessert person. I highly recommend it just didn’t like the cream cheese...

This cake is absolutely delicious!  No need to transfer; I just poked the entire surface with a fork after the cake cooled. In a glass 9x13" pan, the liquid still fit.  I added 2 tblsp sugar to the whipped cream.

I tried two tres leches recipes.  This one was the third and by far the best.  It was delicious.  I was planning to save some for another family member but my son and husband devour it before anyone else could get their hands on it.  It is the best cake ever!

Made this to take to work.  Thought the cream cheese frosting would not taste authentic on this cake so I used the Cool Whipped Frosting from this site and it was perfect.  It got rave reviews and they are a tough crowd!  The texture of this cake is amazing--it never gets soggy like most Tres Leches cakes.  Even better the second day.

This is a great recipe for Tres Leches- the best I have tried.  It is just the right texture to soak up the milks, and it has a great flavor.  I get a lot of compliments.  I've never tried the frosting recipe- I beat 1 1/2 cups of whipping cream with 1/4 cup sugar, but the recipe for the topping does sound very good and I plan to try it soon.  This is my go-to recipe when I need to bring a dessert!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic.  Easy to make and take anywhere and it is delicious.  This will be my "go to" recipe from now on.  Strawberries are great with it but maybe next time will try another berry.

I used cool whip for the topping and  then sprinkled   with toasted coconut .....

This is my first time making this cake and I will indeed make again.  
I hoped for leftover, but the whole cake was gone in 30 minutes...   So you can safely say that this cake was a hit....

Thanks so much for sharing.....

Just what she said the amount of milk syrup in the recipe seems too much but it is incredibly delicious . My daughter said mom, why it is so yummy ? One thing that makes this recipe different from others is cream cheese in the whipped cream topping. It helps balancing the sweet taste of cake.

I made this cake everything looked wonderful while it was in the oven baking. the directions said only 30 minutes however the middle sunk in and it was very loose until it hit about the 45 minute mark it was very uneven ...sunken in the middle but covering it with whip cream really did the trick! Taste… Fabulous

Very good! I made two round layers. The milk puddled on the plate so that wasn’t a good idea. Should have left well enough alone but thought it would be prettier. My two David’s loved it too!

This is fantastic! I like it without any topping but prefer a sweetened whipped cream to a cream cheese frosting. But the cake itself — WOW!

a little too sweet for my taste, but even my picky eaters loved it, I followed all the steps except I didn't transfer the cake to the milk, I just poked the cake with a fork and poured the milk mix evenly at the top, and it came out great.

The flavor of this cake was very good, but it fell and I'm not sure why-I have baked a lot of cakes without this problem.  The final ingredients should probably be added and mixed by hand, because a mixer may have overmixed the batter.  Most other Tres Leches recipes do call for handmixing the ingredients after beating the egg whites.  I didn't use the cream cheese because I don't think this type of cake is better without it.

The cake was great.  I made it with coconut cream cheese frosting and topped with strawberries.  This was for a birthday party,  7 people all raved about it, none was left.  Next time I'll make 2.

The reason I giving this a top rating is because everyone that tried it loved it. My friend who gave me the recipe to make for a dinner party said it was perfect. Another friend said she loved it too. So if you like tres leche cake this is the one to do. It was not that much fun to make and for me I would rather have another dessert. Just not that big a fan of tres leche cake.
