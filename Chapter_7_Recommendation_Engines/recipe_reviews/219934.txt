These muffins tasted great and were a nice low-calorie treat for the morning.  The reason they got four stars is because they came out kind of tough.  I will try this recipe again and mix it even less than I did originally.  If you make this recipe make sure to only mix the dry/wet ingredients just so!

These muffins are really delicious, and a nice, low cal option for snacking and breakfast. I followed the recipe, except that I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and I used just plain, white sugar. I also used all white flour instead of half and half. I think that next time I might try replacing that tablespoon of oil for a tablespoon of applesauce - it's a common baking swap and seeing as these are apple muffins I think that the applesauce would lend nicely to the apple flavor of the muffin. I also only had vanilla yogurt on hand, so I used that - which was another reason that I chose to lessen the amount of sugar used. The chunks of apples in the muffin were a really nice treat! The recipe states that it only makes a dozen muffins, but I got a dozen and a half, so that was nice! This was a great recipe!

These muffins turned out awsome, they were so moist and fluffy. I would recommend checking on your muffins after 20 minutes cooking time though as this was all the time mine needed in the oven, any longer and they would have been over done. Also be sure to only mix your ingredients until just moistened to avoid your muffins turning out tough. Thank you so much for providing a great healthy recipe for my family :)

We were a little short on all-purpose flour and I used stone ground whole wheat flour and only 1/4 cup of sugar and this still turned out GREAT.  My husband and I both loved them, as did the kids.  Awesome recipe!

These were delicious!  I needed to find a healthy-ish breakfast treat for some people at the office, so I gave this one a shot and it was a hit!  They came out nice and moist, and the spices really make the flavour unique!  I served them with some vanilla cream cheese spread and got rave reviews.  I will definitely make them again. =)

These were very good and I would defiitely make them again!  I used 2 C of whole wheat flour instead of including the all-purpose flour and they turned out great!  Thanks for sharing.

Made these as written. Fabulous!! I might add some nuts next time for variety. Not overly sweet and yummmmmmmmmyyyyy!!! I followed directions to only mix as much as I had to to incorporate everything and they were not tough at all.

I used 2 C Whole Wheat Flour, 1 Tbs Applesauce, 1 tsp fresh ginger (finely shredded),  2/3 C Chobani Vanilla Yogurt, 2/3 C 2% Milk, and 1 Lrg Green Apple.  I folded the wet ingredients into the dry with a spatula and baked for 20 min.  My elevation is 4,500 ft in an arid environment.  These turned out wonderfully although next time I think I'll switch out the applesauce for a Tbs of pumpkin.  Would love to see how that tastes!

I will NOT make them again.  Very tough and chewy.  Flavors were so mild, I couldn't taste anything but the ginger.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I mixed the batter minimally, and took them out of the oven after 20 minutes.

I loved these SO MUCH!!! I made them with 2% milk and regular yogurt because that was all I had and that worked just fine. They were great for breakfast.

I used dry brown sugar and used a mixture of all purpose, whole wheat, and a tiny bit of flaxmeal because those are what I had on hand. My muffins tasted a bit chewy. I rather my muffins be moist and flaky instead of moist and rubbery. There could have been a bit more spice and sweetness in there as well. Very little depth of flavor and very poor texture. Edible, but not very enjoyable. I would rather make a higher calorie version and eat less of them.

These muffins were tasty, though I made several notable alterations:
1) I only had vanilla non-fat yogurt, so I reduced the sugar to 2/3c.
2) I used all-purpose flour and added 2/3c of oats to the liquid mixture - whole wheat flour would have been desirable but I didn't have any :(
3) I 2 whole apples, which amounted to approximately 1.5c.
Next time I might consider adding some baking powder.
It is true that they are a bit "gummy" as opposed to crumbly, but I don't find that to be a big turn off.

I enjoyed this very much. The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars is that I didn't care for the spices much. The rating is for a low fat recipe. Next time I will eliminate the allspice and double the cinnamon.

These muffins are fantastic! I added flax seed meal and some chopped dates.  My family ate them in a day. Highly recommend them!!
