Love this, even though I made it with less chili powder and no jalape√±o because kids/wife don't like their chili so hot. Probably would do a few less celery but other than that, as is. Really really good!

Amazingly easy and tasted great. Easy to make this recipe your own by switching things around. Next time will substitute beef for venison. This recipe has great flavor. Thanks!

JRay's Chili Haiku: "I've made this for years. Why did I not review it? JRay, it's awesome!" In sleuthing around the new & improved /snort/ websites collections, I saw that I somehow never reviewed this recipe when I 1st made it, nor any of the countless times that I've made it in the yrs. in b/t. It is a 5-star chili (spicy! thick! great as leftovers! freezes well!) as written, but when I made it this last time, I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, no bacon, & dried oregano & basil (less than the fresh called for). Left it in the slowcooker for more like 6 hrs. as well. Chili can be such a blank canvas when you start w/ meat + tomato + bean, and this one's seasoning and vegetable additions are spot-on.
