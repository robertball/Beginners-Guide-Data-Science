My mom asked me to bring desserts for Thanksgiving this year (this is the first year in several my husband and I haven't done it with his family), so I'm thinking this cake looks really wonderful. I'm just wondering if I could use rum extract instead of the rum in the cake. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! :)

Yummy! Not really pound cake, more of a Bundt cake, but still great. My only issue is that it fell apart when I unmolded it - make sure you cool it completely before removing it from the pan.

I really liked that recipe. The cake was moist and full of flavor. I had to lower the temperature of my oven b/c after the first 30 mins, the crust started to be really dark and hard. I omitted the butterscotch glaze and went with a Rum glaze instead. What can I say, I am a lushie ;)

This was my first time baking and this was fairly easy. Melting the butterscotch morsels turned out to be a mess but it worked out at the end. I couldnt really taste the rum, but the overall texture of the cake was great. I was surprised that a convenience cooker like myself was able to pull it off. I think I messed up the glaze though, it was too chunky.

I've made this for family gatherings as well as for work and it gets rave reviews.  Everybody constantly asks me to make it again.  When serving at home, I like to drizzle the plate with caramel before plating the cake.  You get a little more of the flavor and it looks great.

This is an easy cake to make for any of those baking novices out there.  The cake did not have enough of a rum flavor for me but taste is a pretty subjective thing so the rum flavor might have been more than enough for some people.  The one thing I will note on this recipe is that I'm not sure the best way to melt the butterscotch chips that go in the cake is in the microwave.  I ended up getting one big clump of butterscotch that became little chunks in the cake  batter.

I made this cake for my parents.  They absolutely loved it!  My mom said it reminded her of a dessert her own mother used to get from a local bakery and it brought back memories.  I actually used light rum instead of dark run and even added pecans to the walnuts because I ran out of walnuts.  It was delicious!!

This cake is delicious.  You can't tell the finished product is from a box cake mix!  Definitely something to brag about.

My husband claims he doesn't like cake, but he sure had no problems finishing this one off! I leave the alcohol out and it still tastes great.

Delicious!  I could taste a hint of rum in the end.  I would suggest sprinkling a little extra rum to give it an extra kick.  I am definitely making this again.

Absolutely fantastic!  I substituted Makers Mark (bourbon) for rum.  Next time I will use a little more bourbon...I like to taste the alcohol a little more, but I am a lush ;-)  Great recipie and I will be making this again soon.

Dissapointed, I just expected a more even flavor of Rum and butterscotch. Not so, we could really taste the rum! It's OK but we won't make it again.

OMG, this was GREAT and I am not a lover of butterscotch  at all.  My cake fell apart on the sides and I let it cool for 3 hours.  I did not use rum. Dispite the negatives, this cake is awsome. I'm in love and I don't love easily.  I only try cakes with 5 stars and sometimes they don't even deserve 3 stars, but this cake is to die for, although it is very fattening and pretty heavy:)

I baked this cake for something different at the Thanksgiving table. It turned out to be an excellent addition to everything else. Everyone was pleasantly surprised by the taste and my mother even asked which bakery I got it from. I would recommend this cake as dessert for almost any occasion and it goes very well with a cup of coffee.

I am not a baker! But wanted a great cake for a special birthday. This was it. Simple recipe to follow with outstanding results! I didn't change a thing, except I did not make the glaze. Very moist. The nuts add to the lovely texture. Beautiful color and aroma. Everyone loved it - even the kids who are PICKY eaters. If you are fortunate enough to have leftovers, it is even better the next day (or day after!). Terrific recipe, I plan on making a bunch of them and giving them as Christmas gifts.

I hesitated to make this cake; I'm not a big butterscotch fan. (However, I am a big rum fan!) Am I ever glad I made this cake--EVERYONE went nuts over it. Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this fabulous recipe!!!  :)

I would have givin this a 3, but my husband loved it.  I didn't like the texture, because it reminded me of bread pudding, which I don't care for.  I was moist and had a wonderful butterscotch flavor. We could not even taste the rum. The best part was the butterscotch topping.

Very moist and tasty - didn't have dark rum so I used spiced instead. Next time I will add a little less and I'll also buy an extra bag of butterscotch chips to put in the batter and make extra glaze.
