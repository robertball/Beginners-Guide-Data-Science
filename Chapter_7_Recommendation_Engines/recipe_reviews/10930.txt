Mmmmmmmmmm!!! Nice texture soft and sweet buttery cookies that will melt in your mouth. I really liked this cookies extremely easy and non-time consuming. I divided the dough into two pieces and rolled one batch in coarsely chopped pecans and the other in gourmet white sugar. They looked beautiful just be careful NOT to handle this cookies until they have completely cooled or they will crumble in your very hands. Very good recipe thanks for sharing!!! Moshi

I skipped the nuts and put the dough in the fridge overnight. I rolled the dough into about 30 balls. I rolled half of the balls in sugar that is two different shades of green (light and dark). I rolled the other half in a cinnamon-sugar blend then rolled them again in red sugar. They look really pretty and have a wonderful buttery taste. One drawback-they are slightly crumbly-but not so much that you'd be worried about carrying them to someone's house (I wouldn't mail them though).

These were good. I made several different cookies for a Christmas party and wanted to make these for my boss b/c she doesn't eat eggs. She and everyone else loved them. I made them again for Christmas day but used unsalted butter b/c thats what I had. I must say they tasted better with salted butter!

Awesome! Just like I remembered from being a little girl. The perfect balance of sweetness. Mine weren't crumbly at all...I followed the recipe exactly as written...don't change a thing!

very nice! easy and quick to make taste is just right! I left the pecans out and din't have confectioners sugar so i rolled the steaming hot butter balls in sugar mixed with cinnamon left them in there a bit so the sugar really sticks to the hot butter balls. did make the first time only half the batter. Tomorrow a whole batch goes out to my husbands work....it is that good! well done!

These are delicious. I first toasted the pecans (350 degrees for 10 minutes) then chopped them fine in my food processor. I didn't have a problem with crumbling so this may have helped.

This recipe was very easy to complete. However it only indicates to use butter. Thus my confusion. So I made two batches: in one I used margarine and the other real butter. I tend to use real butter while baking but was just not sure with this recipe. I found that the margarine tasted better and was less dry and flaky. Overall very good tasting either way

Delicious! I was looking for a recipe that was similar to a cookie I ate Salzburg last week made by an Austrian Grandmother and this came very close! Light crispy and buttery. It's impossible to eat just one! I used chopped walnuts and ground almonds since I live in a small town in Germany and pecans aren't as readily available. Everyone loved these. This recipe is officially on my Christmas cookie list to stay! Thanks for sharing!

Grandma's revenge! I needed a butter ball recipe for traditions sake. I knew my dad would want to see one on the cookie tray. Holy Comoly...these were worth it. I never even knew I liked butter balls. Hint: make the balls small. They rise:)

This is pretty much the same recipe as Robin McCraw's almond cookies this is half of her recipe. Except the nuts.. I did use half white wheat flour(was short on all-purpose) and added 1 tsp vanilla. So good and easy to make! I will make them with half AP flour and half white wheat(at least it would make them a little healthy!:)

Very good recipe. Just like a recipe that my mother has been making for Christmas for years and years. They really do melt in your mouth. I do add a couple of teaspoons of pure vanilla to the creamed butter/sugar. And I like to chop the nuts very fine so they almost become a part of the dough with little bits to chew on. Make sure that you let the cookies cool fully before tossing them in the confectioners sugar otherwise you will end up with more of a glaze on the cookie. I use a zip lock bag for the confectioners sugar and do about 3-4 cookies each time. Lastly I like to make the cookies bite size so that they are a delicious little one bite. Yummy and a classic. Everyone loves these......Thank you for sharing...

LOVED these. That perfect nutty-buttery taste....I toasted the pecans @ 350 for 10 min before chopping them as a previous reviewer had suggested. Definitely should do that...it's worth it.

Great recipe! I make them every year for christmas. I usually use finely chopped almonds insetad of pecans. I have had great results coating half of each warm ball in powered sugar then dipping the other half in melted chococate. I reccomend using powered corn sugar (bulk store) I find it doesnt melt as easily and stays more powdered. Thanks for posting this recipe.

these are an excellent basic sugar cookie and extremely easy to make. wonderful light buttery flavor and texture. i didn't use pecans but you can really do anything with this dough. i made a simple homemade frosting out of shortening sugar lemon juice and milk to put on top then sprinkled with cookie decoration and they were great.

I decided on this recipe to use up pecans I had for something else. I HATE pecans so these were to be made for a cookie exchange. Of course I still needed to sample my work after baking and holy cow - these are AWESOME!! I swear I don't like nuts but I couldn't stop eating these cookies. To me the pecans added more of a richness along with the butter than a pure nutty flavor. Next time I'm going to try making them in a longer biscotti-ish shape for eating with my morning coffee. Needless to say these stayed home with me and I made something else for the cookie exchange:)

Excellent. Only use butter. I used chopped pecans and coconut. Wait until they are COMPLETELY cooled (do not handle they will fall apart) roll in powdered sugar.

I was too lazy to dig through all my cookbooks to find the recipe I always used in the past. It has been many years since I had the time to bake buying from our local bakery instead. So found this recipe sounded like the one I used to use so made them Perfection! I think even better than the old recipe!

I added extra butter and used almonds instead of pecans.. toasted the nuts first and added cardamom for flavor. We are in India the cardamom sealed them as a hit! This recipe is rather small and we doubled it!

This was the first time I had ever made these cookies..I was impressed with the results. The only change I made was to the nuts..I was out of pecans and in a pinch used finely crushed walnuts. They worked out and tasted just as good as pecans I thought.. Everyone else must have thought so too as the cookies were gone in less than 24 hours.

These were tasty but I wouldn't say exceptional. I had the dough in the fridge overnight and baked them the next day. I didn't find them crumbly at all. I'm not sure I'd make them again. Personally its not a recipe I'd ask for if someone else had made them for me.
