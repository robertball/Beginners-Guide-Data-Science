Thank you for the recipe. The cake was very easy to make. I liked that it was light and not very sweet. I served it reheated with some apple pie ice cream (limited edition from Edy's) and vanilla ice cream. Here are some tiny changes I made:
4 eggs instead of 3, because I had one leftover, light brown sugar instead of white sugar, I added some spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and 1 tsp. vanilla. I mixed the lemon zest with the plums instead and coated them with a little bit brown sugar, which made them sweeter and look glossy at the end. I didn't know what a tube pan was, so I used my pie form. It looked pretty (rustic) and I will definetly make it again in the next days, but with asian pears. I will report on how it turned out. Hope that helped. :)
Update: I did make a cake with asian pears but I used a new recipe for a walnut pie crust (interesting recipe). Just wanted to let you know that the pears baked beautifully, in case you were curious. I was very surprised how firm they stayed. I expected them to turn out soft and soggy because of their high water content. The flavor was mild.

One of my husband's favorite food. I too added sugar on top of the cake to add sweetness (brown sugar).  I don't have to worry about refridgerating this cake, it's gone in a flash!

The cake is very good although I usually don't make recipes that reuire stiffening egg whites.  
The cake is light and sweet, not heavy.  However, the skins on my plums are sour and I need to sweeten them to make it a better tasting recipe.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on them and it helped a little.
Again, very good overall.

Very good cake!  Reminds me a lot of my Mom's Pflaumenkuchen.  I made it in a springform pan and sprinkled some cinnamon on the batter before laying the plums on their sides. Right before I put it in the oven I sprinkled with some sugar and then 5 minutes before it was done I sprinkled a little more sugar over to form a little crust over the cake. I did not separate the eggs, I just added them whole to the butter and sugar and mix them in well.  =)  
******
Update: I made it again and used only 2 eggs which made the dough less rubbery and also added in about 1/4 tsp. of salt.  Put fresh peach slices on top this time.  Really good!

This cake is so yummy and light. It's perfect for a summer evening. My husband LOVED it and he doesn't usually care for desserts. The only change I made was to include some brown sugar with the plum layer and I used an 8inch cake pan (I don't have a tube pan). But it still came out wonderfully. I will make this often.

I'm not sure why this is getting such rave reviews.  No one in my house really liked this much.  Maybe if you put in other fruits in addition to plums it would be better.  I made it just as directed, but in a bunt pan.  Guess I'm still looking for a way to use up those extra plums.

Great recipe! My husband and toddler both loved it. It'd be great with vanilla ice-cream because it isn't too sweet. I used an electric hand mixer to beat the eggs (very easy) and baked it a regular 9 in round cake pan. I also made the following changes:   -1/2 white flour, 1/2 whole wheat -added 1.5 tsp of vanilla -a couple pinches of salt -1/2 cup apple puree -half of the butter the recipe called for -soak plums in some cinnamon, manischewitz (any sweet wine would work), and cinnamon -sprinkled with a a bit of sugar at the end for sparkles sake

This cake is delicious! I used a bread pan, as I didn't have a round cake pan, and it came out lovely. It may not appear to pretty on top, but the combination of sweet, juicy plums with the cake batter was excellent! Will make again.

The cake itself was very very dry and even after coating the plums in brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of almond extract and serving it with ice cream, I feel this recipe was not something I would bother with again.  Sorry!

Perfect! Sprinkle sugar on top of plums before putting in the oven. I also made cinnamon cumbles and put them on top. Then baked for 40 min, and leave in the oven for another 15min.

This was easy to make and rustic, yet elegant looking. I used a springform pan, which worked very well. I also added maybe a tbsp of fresh lemon juice, and used some extra plum slices, layering them in the center of the cake. Served it with Sunday brunch. It is not a sweet cake, but it is definitely a treat.

Pears can be used instead of plums!  I followed the recipe as is, just using peeled and quartered pears instead  of plums.  Delicious!  A drizzle of butterscotch icecream topping and cinnamon finishes it off nicely.

I used a bunt pan for this recipe, and sugar coated the plums before baking. The lemon zest add a nice flavour.

Love the cake.  Lightly sweet and airy.  Could use any fresh fruit with this recipe.  Used an 8 in x 6 in ceramic cake pan instead of a tube pan.  Added 1 Tbsp vanilla instead of lemon zest.  Also, sprinkled sugar on the bottom of the cake pan and on top of the cake before baking.  Turned out perfectly.

I made this with Shiro plums (yellow/gold). I have a tree that is just loaded. It was absolutely wonderful! I followed the recipe exact, except I used as many plums as I could fit (about 2 1/2 cups)and sprinkled a little brown sugar and cinnamon on top. I served it warm with a little butterscotch ripple ice cream. My whole family wanted seconds...and thirds. I definitely found one way to use all these plums. 
Thanks

I have to say that I did make some changes:  used about three cups of mixed peaches and plums, which I had tossed with half a cup of brown sugar and some lemon zest; I also baked it in a pie plate, not a tube pan, and it baked for about an hour.  What I love about this cake is the cake itself is absolutely delicious!  It must be the incorporation of whipped egg whites into the batter.  And it's as good cold the next day, with vanilla ice cream, as it is when it's warm from the oven.  Will definitely make it again, and experiment with egg whites in batters for other recipes.

Just to let you know I had to change the serving size at the bottom of the screen because its only me and my boyfriend. I feel it was kind of bland and the plum skins too tart. If I would hve added more suger it would have been better. I will try it again but this time add some brown sugar and perhaps use a peach or an apple. Maybe since I didn't use the original 14 servings I didn't get a better flavor.

I puréed 2 plums and added it to the batter, so that there would a plum taste in the cake as well.

Thank you for sharing. It turned out very good. I did change some things. Will let you know next time I make it.

Just planted a plum tree a couple of years ago so now on the search for recipes.  This one is a hit with family and friends.  Like that it is not too sweet.  Will make it again.

As is this tart is tasty at 3 1/2 stars, but the crust needed something.  After making it a second time with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and cardamom and 1 teaspoon vanilla, the flavor was so much better.  The cardamom with the plum was prefect.  I also sliced the plums much thinner and laid them in a rosette around the top.

This is a very  unique cake. We really liked the fact that it isn't overly sweet and has a strong plum taste. I can see where a lot of people might not like that flavor.  I probably would not serve it for company.  I did make a few small changes.   I made it in a deep pie dish, used about 2 cups of plums, and put an oatmeal strudel on top. I also  added a little cinnamon and salt.  I served it with vanilla  ice cream and a little caramel syrup.  Those were the only changes that I made. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This cake didn't rate as anything special. Was rather plain even with the brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  40 minutes was a little too long to bake it and I have a slow oven.  I don't think I will be making this cake again.  Definitely should be served warm with ice cream or whip cream.

I thought this was a good cake recipe with just the right amount of sweetness.  I wanted a moist fruit top, so I did it like a pineapple upside down cake.  I melted 1Tbs. of butter in a cast-iron pan, sprinkled 1-1/2Tbs. brown sugar, a little lemon juice, cinnamon, and placed the plums there.  Batter on top and then I cut the baking time by 5 mins.  The only other alteration was that I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of all purpose.  It came out great!

My husband nor I cared for this cake. It was dry and not very favorable with the exception of the tart plums (mine weren't very sweet). I will not be made again - even to adjust the recipe.

Love the flavor.  I thought the sweetness was just right, but I left out a bowl of powdered sugar for those who wanted more.  Also, I have a couple of kids who I knew would balk at seeing the plums, so I pureed them and poured them on top before baking.

How about changing the name to DISAPPEARING Plum Cake?!? This always disappears the same day I bake it. Delicious.

For the amount of work (beating egg whites is pretty rare in my repertoire), it's only a decent cake. The texture is quite nice, but the flavor is somewhat lacking and the presentation isn't too attractive, either.

pretty good light cake.  Good use for all the plums i get from my mom's tree.  Sugaring the plums makes it slightly sweeter, but it really depends on the plums.
