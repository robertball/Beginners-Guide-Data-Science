This is the first thing I cooked in my new crockpot.  Taking other reviewers' advice, I browned a 3.66 lb. boneless chuck roast in a little olive oil after rubbing low sodium Montreal Steak Seasoning and 1 chopped fresh garlic clove.  I cut the roast in half before setting it in the crockpot as it was so big.  I used 2 cans of beef broth instead of water and used small red potatoes, along with 1 sliced onion and I also chopped up some baby carrots, 2 more cloves of garlic and omitted the celery.  Halfway through I ended up adding more potatoes and carrots as I didn't think I had enough veggies. I'm glad I did as the veggies I first included basically turned to mush (but goooood mush).  I also added garlic pepper and garlic salt along the way to taste as it cooked.  This cooked on low from 915am to about 630pm, but really was ready about an hour before.  My husband took a little flour with 3/4 of the juice and some more garlic pepper and made an excellent gravy.  The juice was so hot from the crock pot that we didn't need to put it into a sauce pan. just whisked it up in a bowl.

I have to say, this is the best pot roast.  The recipe is a good template that you can play around with to taste.  The only things I woud change is that I would use whole baby carrots and add in the veggies (all except the onions) about halfway through instead of straight at the beginning.  The other reviewers' comments really helped me in fixing this recipe to my own taste.  It worked out wonderfully

Don't make the mistake I did at first.  The roast I was cooking was only 2 pounds so I thought, "Half the weight means half the cooking time."  After only 4 hours of cooking in the crock pot, the roast was edible--it had a nice flavor and we could definately get our teeth through it, but it wasn't even close to the glorious "fall apart on your plate" stage.  We didn't need all of the roast to feed the four of us for dinner, so I left the rest of it in the crock for an additional 4 or 5 hours and by the time I took it out, it was a fabulously tender and tasty roast.  I'm glad I'll know for next time.

I loosely followed this recipe, and chose it because I wanted an alternative to the standard cream of mushroom soup (I don't mind it too much, but I'm not the biggest fan). I had just over two pounds of beef. To avoid having it turn out bland, I added 1 cup of beef broth instead of water, 1/4 c Worcestershire sauce, parsley, and two cloves of garlic minced. I didn't have onion soup mix, so I added around a tablespoon of onion powder, and some salt and pepper. I also cut up one large carrot, two stalks of celery, 5 small potatoes. Then, I let it all sit and marninade overnight in the slow cooker dish in the fridge. I followed the rest of the directions as written, turning on the slow cooker and letting it all cook 10 hours while I was driving to and from or at work. When I got home, it smelled wonderful (my husband had to smell it all day!) and the meat was falling off the bone. I sampled some of the veggies and almost couldn't stop eating them! I made Sky High Yorkshire Pudding with this (highly recommended). With my slight variations, I give this recipe a 5! Great base to start with and adjust to your taste.

It would be very helpful and courteous to review a recipe made EXACTLY the way it is written. It is not beneficial at all to read how you rated your own recipes using another person's name. Marie, your recipe made as written, is excellent. Thank you!

THIS IS AWESOME.  Boyfriend and I couldn't believe it!  I modified the recipe based on other people's comments.  Everyone was saying to add Montreal Steak Seasoning, which I didn't have. So I looked it up and it's basically comprised of pepper, salt, and paprica. For the rub i combined 1 Tbsp each  of kosher salt, crushed peppercorns (i crushed), and paprika. I also added about 1 tsp. of garlic powder. This I rubbed on the meat and sprayed a little olive oil over top. To the pot, i added 3 large chopped carrots, six or so small red potatoes (chopped), an onion, and half a container of small fresh mushrooms. Additionally, I added 2 bay leaves, about a tsp. of worshire sauce, and the onion soup mix along with the water. Didn't have celery.  SUPER SPICE-A-RIFIC!!!  Enjoy!

I have cooked a lot of roast in my day and this is the ONLY time it has come out perfect!  I didn't add any vegetables with it except for cutting an onion in half and setting it on top of the roast for the last 3 hours of cooking time.  I made mashed potatoes and green beans separate, just don't like my potatoes to taste like anything except potatoes.  I also whisked 2 teaspoons of cornstarch with 1/2 cup water and added to the au jus that I transfered to a sausepan.  I boiled the au jus mixture for about 5 minutes, whisking often, for a wonderful brown gravy.  I was tempted to not cook it as long as the recipe calls for, but please just let it cook and keep check on the liquid level.  Roast cooked this way just melts in your mouth!  Thanks for sharing your talent!

Used CHUCK roast-important! Quartered red potatos and put in crockpot with baby carrots. Boiled 1 cup water with 2 beef bullion cubes in microwave. Sprinkled most of the dry onion soup over vegetables(just potatos and carrots-didn't use celery and onion), then added stirred beef bullion and stirred the veggies. Browned roast seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Added roast to crockpot,sprinkled remaining dry onion soup mix on roast and spred with a little water,  and cooked for 5 hours on HIGH. Removed roast and vegetables to rest and added gravy to skillet whisking in a half cup of water with 2 TBLS flour to thicken. This was abolutely the BEST! I like the strong flavor it gives the carrots, but you may wish to steam them separately.

This was fabulous. I took a few reviewers advice and soaked the roast in red wine vinegar over night. I made a rub with pepper, salt, lemon pepper and freshly minced garlic and then browned the roast on all sides. I was using my mother-in-law's roaster and it didn't have low, med and high so I set it to about 200 degrees  for 8.5 hours. I added the onion soup mix, some onion, lots of garlic, carrots, some celery we needed to get rid of and 2 potatoes. We served it with Sky High Yorkshire Pudding (allrecipes.com) which was great! We also had garlic mashed potatoes and an easy green salad. This was an AT recipe and we'll use it again!

Great recipe, but I browned the meat on all sides after seasoning the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning prior to putting it in the slow cooker. This added great depth of flavor to the meat and the finished gravy. I omitted the potatoes from the slow cooker, and oven roasted them instead with olive oil, salt/pepper and whole garlic cloves during the last hour of cooking the roast. A crispy contrast to the luscious gravy. My family loved this meal!

Very, very good--the only thing I did different is added a couple beef bouillon cubes and more water so that I could make lots of gravy.  I even chopped up the left over roast put it back in the slow cooker and made a stew with it--it was great!  Thank you Marie!

I followed the recipe exactly and was a bit disappointed. I had high hopes starting out but the end result was rather bland. Don’t get me wrong, the meat was nice and tender, the veggies yummy (a little mushy, but a good mushy), and there was plenty of gravy. However it needed flavor, also searing the meat with salt and pepper didn’t do anything for it. What I would do next time is sear the meat with Worcestershire, olive oil, and a little butter. Then after I put the meat into the crock-pot with veggies on top of the meat. I would deglaze the pan with a mix of either Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon and beef stock. Then I would pour the liquid with pan drippings into the crock-pot. I’m not sure if I would use the onion soup mix or not, I think that would depend on the users personal preference.

Really enjoyed this, my construction working fiance & his friends practically inhaled this! I did replace the water with beer and added a little beef boullion... my bloke was overjoyed to find a new way to get beer into his system and it gave it an amazing flavor! There were no leftovers at all.

I used this as a starting point to learning how to make a great roast. The first time I followed the recipe. The 2nd time I tweaked it after reading the reviews. NOW, I have created a masterpiece. This is how I do it:Make sure you use a Chuck roast first of all. Then, brown the meat with salt, pepper, garlic/onion as desired. Then, place in slow cooker. Deglaze the pan with a little beef broth and then add it and addtional can to slow cooker (total 2 cans of beef broth). Pour 1 envelope of dry onion soup mix on top, and 1 tBLsp of Worceshire sauce on top of the meat. Cook on low for 8hrs. After 6 hrs. add quartered red potatoes and carrots to the slow cooker. When done it will be falling apart so remove from slow cooker carefully. Make gravy by using broth and flour/cornstarch/water mixture and heating to just boiling in separate saucepan stirring constantly till desired thickness is acheived. Yum!

To all the reviewers that said "It was delicious, But I modified the recipe by adding this or changing this". Once you change anything about an original recipe, you are no longer cooking the recipe but a new recipe that will taste nothing like  that  one.

For those of you that want a thicker gravy, add flour and onion (for flavor) when you are browning the meat. Browning the meat gives it a nice color and there will be no additional steps at the end for a thicker gravy. I find that beef broth gives a "tinny" taste. Using chicken broth lets the taste of the beef shine through. I use chicken broth along with a nice dry red wine. Remember that when adding wine, do not add a wine that is too fruity or has been "oaked" (usually older wines). The long cooking time will concentrate any fruit, oak or other flavors that the wine has. Also when adding vegetables, add them about halfway through the cooking time and NOT in the beginning. Delicious!

Fall apart TENDER! I've been making this recipe for many years (before this was even added).  There's no need to brown roast first! No need for the salt! THE ONION SOUP MIX HAS ENOUGH SALT IN IT ALONE! Listen- Just throw the roast in the crock, just place carrots around it, (Use the cut up potatoes for mashed, it just goes much better with the tender roast!)cover top of roast with onion soup mix and then TOP WITH CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP. You'll see it's just fantabulous!

In combination of several suggestions in the reviews, this was just the MOST DELICIOUS AND TENDER roast I have ever tasted (it was also my first time making one)! Here's what I did...   I sliced a 2½ lb boneless beef chuck pot roast into 4 large serving pieces. It didn’t have much fat so no trimming was necessary. In a deep dish, I rubbed all sides with steak seasoning, fresh ground black pepper, coarse kosher salt, and about 2+ tablespoons ready-to-use minced garlic then poured about 1+ tablespoon balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce on top turning the meat to coat. While that sat, I sliced up a yellow onion then browned the meat on all sides with the onion in extra virgin olive oil. Transferred the meat (including all the juices in the pan) to my slow cooker, added 1 cup beef broth, 1+ tablespoon minced garlic, ¼ packet of onion soup mix (leftover from making dip), fresh ground pepper, garlic salt, oregano, marjoram, thyme, and paprika. Covered and set to low for 6-8 hours. Just about 2 hours before it was done, I added whole baby carrots, chunks of celery, red onion, and mushrooms. Instead of adding potatoes, I made mashed potatoes and brown gravy from the juices.   The original recipe is a good “base”. Just be creative and use your spices!

I have prepared my pot roasts this way quite a few times now, and am finally getting around to reviewing the recipe!  Sometimes I add a teaspoon or two of Better than Bouillon beef base, a clove or two of minced garlic, or use beef broth rather than water, but the basic recipe always remains the same, and always turns out delicious.  I had planned on making this today, actually.  I bought my beef in bulk from a local farmer who raises grass-fed cows for the first time ever, and was so excited to pop my first grass-fed roast into the crock pot this morning!  I defrosted it, unwrapped it, and then realized it was actually a 7-bone chuck roast.  Not a boneless chuck roast.  I had already defrosted it, so I went ahead and browned it, then tried to stuff it in my crock pot.  No such luck.  It wasn't going to fit.  So, it sat in my refrigerator in my covered roasting pan "marinating" in the onion soup mix and water all day while I did some research on how to cook a 7-bone roast in the oven.  Just in case anyone wants to use this type of cut, or finds themselves in a similar bind, here's what I did: bake covered at 280 for 4 hours, adding the veggies at the last hour.  The result was fall-off-the-bone, slice-with-a-fork, melt in your mouth tender and absolutely delicious!  Crock pot is good, but this method produced a roast equally as good.  The next "variation" I'm going to try is to make my own onion soup mix from a recipe also here on AllRecipes.  Can't wait!

Great base recipe! I took the advice of others and browned my meat in olive oil but first I rubbed it with Montreal Steak Seasoning on all sides. I used a 1lb bag of carrots and about 5 red potatoes - skins left on, whole onion - sliced, and 2 stalks of celery. I used 2 cups of water and boiled it on stove with 2 beef boullion cubes. I added the onion soup mix to the boiling beef broth and poured mixture over meat and veggies in crock pot. I also added about 1/4C worcestershire sauce. I added some garlice pepper & garlic salt to the crock pot. Cooked on low for 9 hours and meat was falling apart! I removed the roast from the crock pot and cut it up then added corn starch mixed with cold water to the crock pot to thicken up the juices into a gravy. Everything was perfect!!

adding my 2 cents! I did alter it based on other reviews...2 pkgs of o.s.m instead of 1, instead of water I used a half cup of beef broth and a half cup cooking wine, and I also threw in a can of cream of mush. soup....I know the point is to get away from a soup mix (cream soup that is) but I thought it was the best roast that I have ever made!!! Oh one more thing...I omited the potatoes and made mashed instead!  I know that people sometimes have something to say about people rating a recipe after they have added thier own tweeks, but isint it what its kind of about?? getting ideas from others and tweeking them to suit our own taste? I d k...Just saying give this a try! It is awesome! My veggies were perfectly cooked as directed in the recipe!

Used a 3.5lb rump roast instead and it worked out amazingly!! The meat just fell apart and was full of flavour. I did modify the recipie as others suggested. Seasoned the beef with ground pepper & garlic salt. Added a can of beef broth and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce to recipe. I also added mushrooms during last 4 hours of cooking. At the end, took out all the veg and thickend the sauce with flour. Used more potatoes then what recipe called for and omitted the celery.
Best roast I ever made!! Very tastey.

This is an old standby at my house.  my mother made this many times while I was growing up, and it was one of my favorite meals.  My husband now loves this pot roast!  I don't always brown the roast first, depending on how rushed I am that morning.  The last time I made this, I peeled and sliced the potatoes the night before and stored them in a ziplock bag with water.  I placed the raw beef, seasonings, and onions in a crockpot liner sealed with a twist tie and popped it in the fridge.  The next morning, I just had to untie the crockpot liner and place it in the pot.  I drained the potatoes and opened a bag of peeled baby carrots to add to the pot.  Easy and delicious!

This is a staple in my house...we LOVE it!  I use garlic salt and pepper, and Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix.  I also use baby carrots and sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes.  I add a can of beef broth to ensure there is enough liquid to cover the meat.  Cooks on LOW for 10-12 hrs, and is just perfect!  I make "pot roast burritos" with the leftovers...hubby loves those! :)  An EASY, no-hassle, tasty pot roast!!!          *note - close all of your bedroom doors when you turn on the crock or else your rooms will smell like pot roast for days...)

I have been doing pot roast like this for years. The bonus is, make an extra roast at the same time, or use leftover roast and broth left in cooker for beef and noodles, or chop leftover beef and veggies ad back to broth, add frozen mixed veggies, chopped cabbage, and a little V8 juice and you have delicious homemade beef vegetable soup!!!!!!!!!

WOW!!!  Let me tell you, I have tried to make pot roast several times already but I gave up because the meat ended up being dry.  I used stewing beef, rump roast, and other cuts.  Now I know YOU MUST USE CHUCK ROAST...that's what makes this recipe super!  I took the advice of other reviewers and rubbed the meat with Montreal Seasoning but I did not brown it--just put it in the crockpot.  I also used a can of beef broth instead of water.  I added vegetables half way through and used red potatoes because it's not as starchy as white.  My son said the beef just melts in your mouth!  Tasty, delicious and great comfort food!  I've always wanted a good beef roast/stew recipe and now I have it!  THANK YOU, Marie, for sharing and telling us to use the right cut of beef!

I was feeling a little 50's homey and wanted to feed my family something lumberjack hearty, so pot roast was an easy decision. However, never having made it before, I wanted to try this recipe since it promised two important things: moist + juicy. I layered the bottom of the crock pot with baby carrots, halved celery stalks and quartered red potatoes. Then, I combined the onion soup mix with 1 can of beef broth and poured it over all. The 2.5 lb roast was next. I rubbed it with minced fresh garlic, pepper and salt, then gave it a quick sear in olive oil. The roast then joined the veggies in the crockpot, and the remaining olive oil + pan juices were poured over all. Our dinner cooked for 14 hours on low, which in the end, would have been better at 12 hours. Nevertheless, it was delicious! Our veggies weren't mushy at all, the savory onion taste had thoroughly absorbed into everything, and there wasn't even a need to make gravy. Next time though, I'll make the potatoes separately. I thought they took away too much of the flavor, and will add lots more carrots + celery, and just a touch of water to end up with more juice at the end. This tasted much better the second day as leftovers, but the meat hasn't lost any of its fall apartiness that my family loves. Would definitely make this again with a few tweaks.

Really loved the roast.  It was tender, juicy and cut with a fork.  However, I made a mistake.  I used both the dry onion soup mix and vegetable broth.  I should have used one or the other.  Had I added extra salt, it would have been way too salty.  Next time I make this, and I absolutely WILL make it again, I'll take care to watch the salt content.  I'd much rather add more to my plate than risk the dish being over salty.  And I did add extra carrots and potatoes.  With a 3 pound chuck roast, I added at least 6 nice size potatoes and 2 pounds of carrots.  It was a terrific meal, served with nice hot biscuits.

My 87 year old Dad prefers hot meals for supper even in the summertime.  I made this crockpot meal to avoid heating up the house.  Because it was just him and me, I only used a 2 pound chuck roast.  Next time I'm making a bigger one.  This was fabulous!  Dad raved about it and be both wished we had more leftovers.  A very easy but absolutely delicious meal!

Very tasty roast. Quick notes: 1/2 the soup mix, it can make it way too salty (add maple syrup to cut of need be), sear with steak seasoning, de-glaze with red wine and add to the slow cooker. Worcestershire works well (don't over do it though or you are back to the salty problem). Toss in a bay leaf and you are good to go. Have tried this a few times and am constantly tweaking, but follow other suggestions and add your own flair and you will be laughing all the way to the dinner table.

I tried this recipe the last time I made pot roast. I prefer a bone-in roast, as I think it is more flavorful. To the soup mix in a measuring cup I add 1/4c red wine and 3/4c water. I cut slits in the roast and insert slivers of fresh garlic, then sprinkle season salt, fresh ground black pepper, Itallian seasoning, and a light dusting of flour on one side and brown that side of the roast in a dutch oven with about 1T oil, while seasoning and flouring the top side before flipping over and browning the other side, then transfer it to the crock pot, pour the soup mixture over it and sprinkle with 1 chopped onion and 1 thinly sliced carrot and thinly sliced celery stalk. About an hour before roast is done I add baby carrots amd baby potatoes (no need to peel) from the bag and half a bag of frozen pearl onions, turn the heat from low to high and cook for an hour more or until vegetables and meat are tender, then remove meat and vegetables and arrange on a platter. The flour and juices left in the pot create a nice light gravy that can be served alongside to pour over meat and vegetables.

This was my first pot roast EVER, and it was so easy!  I've made it twice, and I've always used a roast that was less than 3 lbs.  I used beef broth instead of water and threw in tons of extra veggies.  I also took the advice of some of the other reviews and added Worcestershire sauce and used a Montreal Steak rub on the meat before browning.  I've left this roast to cook for up to 10 hours on low, and it's turned out great both times!

A very good basic slow cooker roast.  After reading reviews, I made a few changes...I inserted slivered garlic into roast; browned the roast on all sides, then removed to the slow cooker.  I browned an additional onion in the skillet, then deglazed the pan with 1 cup of red wine, instead of adding water.  I added 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, the soup mix, then poured it over the roast.  I cooked on high for 4 hours, added the veggies, then cooked another 4 on low.  My entire family loved it.  Next time, I'll brown sliced mushrooms to add to the mix!

If its cooked too long the veges will be mushy and the roast will fall apart so much it's almost like soup! Adding the veges half way through leaves a tastier pot roast that isn't mush! great flavor with the soup packet!

This was melt in your mouth delicious!  I used a 2.5 lb chuck and let it go for 9-10 hours.  It was falling apart and was perfect!  I, like other reviewers used low sodium beef broth.  I made up my own rub and used that before browning it in the pan (Kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, red pepper flakes, paprika, and garlic powder).  I made a gravy from the leavings in the crock pot and that was delicious as well (Just the juice/broth with a cornstarch/water mixture -- added some salt and pepper).  I also used Yukon Gold potatoes.  Those or red potatoes are really best for this kind of thing.  They hold together better than Russet.  I just ate some leftovers for lunch and they were just as good as last night.  Mmmmmmm!

Excellent recipe.  I added several cloves of garlic, 2 cups red wine instead of 1 cup water, spiced 3.3 lb chuck with Montreal spice before browning it, added bay leaves, used the onion mix, doubled potatoes and carrots but did not add them until half way through.  I also ran out of time so I cooked it for 5+ hours on high. Everyone loved it!

I made this roast yesterday in my new crock pot and wow it was sooo good. I browned a 3.5 lb chuck roast on the stove in a little extra virgin olive oil and salt and pepper and then slow cooked it with the rest of the ingredients for 5.5 hours on low and it fell apart. I used red skinned potatoes which I think next time I will put in an hour after everything else. Oh yeah, I substituted beef broth for the water. With the left over roast I shredded it and added Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce and my husband and I had it on hamburger buns tonight for dinner. Thanks for a great recipe Marie!

I've been using this recipe for years.  I'm a little surprised by the review that said it turned out tasteless.  You can add your own touches to suit your taste, as I have from time to time but you can't lose with this basic recipe.  It has always come out a winner.

This was my very first time making a pot roast, and it turned out great!  I rubbed the chuck roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning and garlic powder and browned it in olive oil, as others had suggested.  I cooked it on HIGH for 5 hours, adding the veggies in during the last hour (so they didn't turn to mush).  Yummyyyy!!!

Yum - what great comfort food!  I used a smaller roast (2.5 lbs) so it was actually done in 5 hours.  As the meat rested before carving, I strained the vegetables from the juice and stirred in a slurry of cornstarch on the stovetop.  After boiling a couple of minutes, I had a thick delicious gravy to pour over the meal.  I highly recommend serving dinner rolls alongside to sop up the gravy.  Definitely a do-over recipe in this house!

Very tender and flavorful.  So I would not end up with mushy veggies I put onions on bottom of cooker, added meat(after browning), soup packet, 1 cup water and 1 cup beef broth and cooked that on high for two hours and low for one hour before adding potato chunks and baby carrots and cooking on low another three hours.  Perfectly tender meat which was not falling apart and sliced nicely and the veggies were soft but not mushy.  Also makes delicious gravy.

Wonderful, simple comfort food.  I used a 3.5 lb chuck and pressed Montreal seasoning into the beef prior to browning. I added beef stock instead of water, a couple glugs of red and white wine (think french onion soup), and a can of stewed tomatoes.  I omited the potatoes, and served mashed on the side.  I made a gravy of a couple cups of the broth.  After 10 hours on low this was tender and delicious! Thank you!

This is an absolute FAVORITE pot roast recipe--with a few modifications.  The meat is always ridiculously tender, full of flavor, and tastes amazing!    

The changes we made are pretty simple--
I use 1 or 2 cans of beef broth instead of the 1c water (depending on the size of roast, 3.5lbs+ 2 cans, less than 3lbs 1can)

I season the meat with either a montreal steak seasoning or some other seasonings we have handy (garlic salt, onion powder, pepper, maybe some paprika, whatever) and then sear in either a small amount of balsamic vinegar or olive oil. 

I like lots of vegetables so we double the vegetables and add half at the beginning (mushy vegetables as a result) but the other half a few hours before the end so they are cooked but not mushy (this is why i add the extra broth since i have lots of extra veggies).

I have also used the beefy onion dry soup mix a few times but really couldn't tell much difference between normal onion soup mix--so i use whatever is on hand.

Easy, easy, easy!  And the meat was so good.  I seasoned the meat with Montreal Steak seasoning and dusted with flour (used a chuck roast).  Started it cooking in the AM with just the liquid (I added just a little more), soup mix, celery, onion and some garlic.  I added the carrots, potatoes a couple hours before it was done.  The meat fell apart and had a nice flavor to it, the veggies were cooked well not mushy and the gravy was so yummy.  Super and easy definitely a keeper!

I've tried this recipe for the first time in December and it has become one of my favorite.    Taking several advices from other Cooks who reviewed this recipe, I completely substitute water with beef broth, add the vegetables about 3/4 the way after the meat, and instead of salt and pepper to taste the meat, I use a seasoned salt.

This potroast using the slow cooker is great.  Before I brown the roast, I usually coat it with a thin layer of flour.  It helps the browning and also adds to the gravy.

What a great recipe!!  I played with it a little bit & used other reviewer's ideas. I rubbed meat tenderizer, garlic powder, course ground pepper & crushed red pepper on it before I browned it.   Used a can of beef broth, package of onion soup mix & beefy onion soup mix, worcestershire sauce, fresh mushrooms, carrots, celery & potatoe.  Kept adding a little bit of salt, pepper & crushed red pepper as it cooked.  It was fall apart-melt in your mouth tender with a little kick to it!  Everyone loved it.

Great recipe. For a beefier flavor, I used a cup of canned beef broth, instead of the water, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. This was a great dinner. I just threw it in the crockpot around 2, and since my roast was about half the size called for, it was done around 7. Thanks for the recipe : )

Awesome Marie! I had a six pound chuck roast so I adjusted the recipe for 12 servings. Used red potatoes, skin on, quartered. Everything was delicious. Had meat left over so have cut the meat into one inch cubes. Threw that into the crockpot with a mix of dry onion soup, water and cream of mushroom soup. Will throw all that on top of flat egg noodles tonight. Walla, beef stroganoff! Thanks for sharing your recipe. Cook on!

FABULOUS!! It took only 20 minutes to prep! The only things I changed were (1) browned the meat before putting it in the crock pot and (2) I used a small bag of baby carrots instead and (3) I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, & garlic powder before cooking. It cooked from 10am to 7:30pm and it was perfect. Just as good as my moms. I also made this recipe another time and instead of using the onion soup mix I used McCormick's Slow Cooker Savory Pot Roast Seasoning..came in a pouch like taco seasoning. Just mix with 1 cup water and pour over the meat & veggies. It was good too!!

I made this recipe tonight and it was the best roast we have ever had (so my husband put it):) I read the reviews before cooking it and took the advice of some of the cooks. I used beef broth instead of water I added garlic and monteral steak seasoning. My roast was only about 2 1/2 pounds but I let it cook for 11 hours and it was better than ever before. The vegtables were falling apart along with the meat. Thank you for the recipe and all the inputs too.

This was simple to prepare and very good.  My two teens LOVED it.  The gravy is more "au jus" so it can be sopped up with bread.  For leftovers, I shreaded the meat and it was even better.  Instead of just using salt and pepper when I browned the meat, I used a season all type of seasoning and the flavor was full and rich.  Definately a keeper.

This is the recipe from the Lipton soup mix box. Has been there forever! I don't like the way the veggies
are overcooked in this recipe. It is good but there are better. Good for novice cooks.

I just want to say that yes, you need to use Chuck Roast, and other than any spices you want to add, all I have ever done to have a perfect roast is to put the roast in the crockpot WITHOUT browning, and I don't add vegy's to the pot. This way, you don't need to add any liquid. I add the onion soup mix and maybe some extra onions, but that's it. Very basic. I cook it on high for four to five hours. DONE! It just falls apart...love it, love it, love it!

I've used this recipe many, many times, but have made several changes to it. I like to coat a couple of sides of the roast with Grillmates steak seasoning (very peppery and has salt), and I also splash some worcestershire sauce on it the night before and stick it in the fridge. The next morning, I sear the sides on the pan (with a little olive oil). I also use beef broth (or chicken broth, whichever I happen to have at home) instead of water. I also use small red potatoes and put them in whole. I cut all of my veggies in large chunks (onion is quartered, carrots in large chunks, etc.) For herbs/seasoning, I also add some thyme and rosemary and 4-6 cloves of minced garlic. Delicious!

Family really liked it.  Seasoned chuck roast with salt, onion powder, garlic powder, mustard and a little cayenne.  Seared in skillet on all sides. Placed in crock pot for 6 hours.  Instead of water used chicken broth and added two bay leafs.  Didn't add onion or celery because we didn't have any and we didn't miss it.  Added my potatoes two hours before it was done, carrots and fresh green beans 1.5 hours before done and then handful of mushrooms 15 min before serving.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Veggies were not mush and had great flavor. Only enough left for hubby next day and he didn't mind eating it at all.

I browned the roast 1st & then cooked the onions in the same pot before adding to the crockpot. I used beef broth instead of the water & increased it to 2 cups. Absolutely delicious!

This was really good and I knew it would be.  I did add a cup of red wine and a can of golden cream of mushroom for thicker gravy but I know it would have been fine without it.

This was sooooo good!  I did rub the roast with seasonings and a little flour before I browned on both sides.  I also used 1 cup beef broth and 1/2 cup of water.  I made a little gravy out of pan drippings and added at last minute to thicken. Will definitely be cooking this one a lot.  Thanks.

This was wonderful pot roast!  I used the Montreal Steak Seasoning and browned the meat ahead of time, and boy was that tasty!  It added so much flavor.  And I think browning the meat ahead of time seals in some of the moisture so that the roast is extra moist.  I also used a can of beef broth instead of water.  Yum!

I made this for dinner this past Sunday.  It was extremely easy and the meat was melt in your mouth moist.  I felt however that it lacked some flavour.  I think next time I will add some worcestershire sauce to it. I will definitely make this again though, thanks.

I impressed my parents with this one.  We all loved it - very moist and tender - not overcooked.  It was good for leftovers as well.  
I have a smaller, older crock pot, so I had to cut the roast (about 4 lbs.) into two chunks, then pile the veggies around it.  After the first meal, I cut up more veggies and slow-cooked them in the leftover juice so that I would have plenty to go with the rest of the roast - excellent leftovers.  Also, once you refrigerate, the next day you can skim off the congealed fat to reduce fat content. I liked the recipe as an easy and tasty way to get some nutritional veggies and fiber - carrots, onions and celery.

This was the first time I have ever made a roast in the slow cooker, and it was oh-so-easy! And, it was very good! I used baby carrots and new potatoes (quartered)and it was ready to go in just a few minutes! My four year old daughter loved it!

So tasty! Turns out perfect every time! I like using red potatoes instead of russet, and those don't get overcooked. Or sometimes I just leave the potatoes out and make mashed potatoes instead. 
Just use half a packet of the mix. One is too much! I use beef broth instead of water if I have it, I like it much more that way. Don't use broth and a whole packet- it will be way too salty!

Easy and extremely delicious! I added extra carrots and potatoes as I have a large slow cooker. My husband loved this dish.

This recipe was very easy to follow and it turned out great. I didn't have 8 hours so I put it on high for 6 hours and it was delish. I'm sure it would have been very good at 8 to 10 on the low setting. I didn't chop up the carrots or onion. I just made big huge chunks because I was afraid they would be mushy if I cut them to small they turned out amazing. I put whole red potatoes on the top of all of it and they were just wonderful as well. I will CERTAINLY do this recipe again. It's easy to make and has only a few basic ingredients which was a big plus. I don't like having to go to the grocery to buy some expensive condiment or spice that I will never use again. Thank you for a wonderful meal.

Followed the recipe with one exception.  Before browning roast, I tied it.  It cooked great and after removing cording, sliced and plattered the meat and vegs.  Served with buttered noodles for those who wanted them and also had mixed green Salad.

This was incredibly delicious. I used a 3-pound chuck roast (which was fatter than I expected) and browned it on all sides. After I put the roast in the slow cooker, I looked at the bits in the pan and decided to deglaze it with a little (maybe 3-4 Tbsp) balsamic vinegar. Next I poked 4 peeled and smashed garlic cloves in the roast and poured the thickened balsamic on it. Then I put a large sliced white onion on top and sprinkled the onion soup mix over that. Finally, I poured the water over everything and put it in the fridge. 

Around midnight, I took it out of the fridge and put it in the cooker on low. When I woke up at 7, I added 3/4 pound of baby carrots and another large white onion (sliced). After about another hour, I noticed the roast was falling apart, so I took it out and covered it with foil while everything else cooked another 2 hours. Then I drained off the liquid and let it separate (because my roast was so fatty). I skimmed off as much of the fat and put the roast, carrots, and onions back in the pot, followed by the skimmed liquid and left it on warm until it was ready to serve. 

The roast was fork tender and full of flavor. I served it with rice, carrots, and onions. I look forward to eating the leftovers. I will make this again! Thanks for sharing, Marie.

Delicious! I rubbed the roast with sea salt, cracked pepper, marjoram, thyme and paprika, then dusted with flour before browning. Also, used almost twice the amount of potatoes and carrots and added a little more water and 3 cloves of garlic. Just needed to add a little salt. Might use a vegetable stock base next time.

YUM! I used this recipe for my first pot roast ever, and it was delish!! I added the potatoes halfway through cooking, per other reviewers' advice. Also used one can of beef broth and a little garlic; otherwise, I made the recipe as is. I cooked it on high for  about six hours and it was perfect!   And one tip* I used the crockpot liner bags that you buy in the grocery store near the ziplock baggies, and it made clean up SO much easier! Didn't change the  taste or compromise the flavor a bit!   I will be making this recipe for years to come.

No need to brown the roast (I have done it both ways). I used my medium size crock pot w/ a 3# boneless Chuck Roast, rubbed it with (Red Robin Seasoning &) sprinkled w/ Salt & Pepper. Put 1/2 package of Onion Soup Mix on it, poured 1 cup hot water, added 3 lg potatoes & as many baby carrots I could still allowing 1-2" clearance from top of crock as it is IMPORTANT you don't overfill your crock pot for proper cooking. (Makers' suggest on filling it 75% full.) I cooked on HIGH for 5.5 hours then turned it down to LOW for the last 2 hours.... ~Wonderful Aroma ....TO DIE FOR!!  2ND-TIME-NOTES:  Used BEEF BROTH instead of water (about 2 cups), did not brown roast, used bag of fingerling potatoes & cooked on LOW for 10 1/2 Hours.  YUMMY!

I made this for dinner tonight and got rave reviews from my husband and step son! The roast was tender and moist. I didn't use the onion soup, but used beef bouillon dissolved in water instead. Browned in skillet w/a tad bacon grease black pepper, sea salt, onion powder  before putting in slow cooker. Used the aluminum foil balls to support the roast in cooker. I used the juice from the roast to make gravy; cooked potatoes, carrots and celery stalks at the end of the cooking time for the roast. Yummmmmmm Yummmmmmm!

Very good roast! I put more potatoes, and carrots, and also added beef broth in with the water, for added liquid! I also put in some garlic salt! I had to cook it quicker; so I did the first 5 hours on low, then 1 1/2 hours on high, just to speed things up! It was still delicious, and fell apart! Thanks for the great recipe!

Followed the recipe but did use Montreal Steak Seasoning & added 2 cloves of garlic. It was very good but seemed to be missing something to give it a little more flavor. Will use this again.  Thanks!

I didn't get to try this but my boyfriend RAVED about it.  He said it was the best meal I have made- which saddens me slightly since it was so easy to prepare.  I took a few other comment's suggestions and added some Worchestire- and also browned the meat with garlic powder, McCormick steak seasoning, salt and pepper.  Then threw everything into the crockpot and let it cook for the 8 hours.  Overall rating (from the boyfriend)= AMAZING.  Definitely a keeper.

This was excellent.First pot roast I've ever made, chose a marbley chuck roast as directed. Replaced the water with the beef broth. I also added garlic and a little extra onion soup for fear it wouldn't have enough flavor, but I didn't need all that, the original recipe would have been totally fine. I think next time i'll just make it as is with diluted beef broth. I live alone and so making big things like this, I need to be sure I can eat it. And I did! Vegetables were perfectly done and yummy as well!

This is a great recipe! With a few modifications of course. I like to braise my roast in some olive oil. I had a 3.5lb roast. I added two cups of beef broth to the mix (I love the "Better than Bouillon" brand, but I think the secret to the liquid is that I also like to add a can of beer to it. Any beer in the fridge, doesn't really matter. I personally just used a Bud Light. As per other reviewers, I added my potatoes, onion and carrots in at the half way point and saw no use cutting up the carrots as they're small enough and easily cook in the time that's left.

Will try this recipe this week! If the meat is bland, try using a knife to make holes all over the roast and stuff with a whole clove of garlic in each along with salt, pepper and any other dry seasoning you may like. trust me the garlic gives great flavor!

Very good recipe. I normally do rate recipes I have changed, but the only changes I made was to increase the amount of vegies and used beef broth instead of water. I used a 1 1/2 lb, bag of small Yukon Gold potatoes unpeeled. After the roast was done, iused the juices to make a great gravy.

So yummy!  The meat falls apart just like a perfec pot roast should.  I followed other's advice and used Montreal Steak seasoning and am glad I did.  I also subbed beef broth for the water.  There is enough juice in the pot after cooking to make gravy.  Great recipe!

Instead of the onion soup mix, I added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce to the broth and inserted 1 bay leaf into the roast, discarding the bay leaf before serving the roast. IMHO, the roast was even better- without those pesky onion bits from the soup mix in the broth.

Tasty and tender.  I seasoned with lots of Montreal Seasoning but I didn't think it was necessary to use beef broth as some suggested, so I used 3/4 c. water and 1/4 c. red wine, and I will do the same next time.  I left the peel on my small red whole potatoes and cut the carrots into largish chunks, and they were just right after cooking all day on low.  I did leave out the celery and next time will add more carrots.  Thanks!

Roast was moist and flavor was ok. Disappointed in the vegetable mush that was left over after I took the roast out. I probably won't be making again. :(

Mine turned out great.  The only reason I give four stars is because I changed it slightly.  Instead of water I used beef broth, and I added a larger variety of veggies.  I took a little of the broth when it was done and mixed in a little flour to make gravy.  The roast was fall apart perfect and the gravy was awesome.  I will make it again with those minor changes.

I've made this pot roast 2 Sundays in a row. And I will probably continue making it every Sunday. SO, SO, GOOD. I used a boneless chuck roast. Vegetables and meat done to perfection. So easy, and tasted so great. Thank you for a great recipe that I will use again and again.

I loved the flavor of this pot roast! I followed the recipe completely other than using beef broth instead of water to be able to make delicious gravy at the end. I felt that 8 hours was the perfect time for this. Others have said to wait to add the vegtables until half way through, but I don't think they would have been as good if I would have done that. I used whole baby carrots, onions cut into fourths, and largely cubed russet potatoes. I thought they were the perfect texture with having simmered the entire time. Just a very little crunch but soft enough to melt in your mouth. I'd recommend adding them at the beginning if you like your veggies soft!

I gave this 4 stars because I made some changes. First, I only used a 2 lb roast. I followed the advice of others and rubbed Montreal Steak Seasoning on it and browned it in a cast iron skillet. I also substituted 1 cup beef broth for the water. When I came home from work, the house smelled incredible!  Baked some crescent rolls and DH and were in heaven!

this was amazing! i used a 3 lbs roast, a bag of baby carrots, and cut small red potatoes in half, also added two onions that i just cut into 4 as they fall apart on their own as the roast cooks. I used all kinds a spice on the meat, montreal seasoning, garlic powder n salt, ground pepper, and i continued to season it as it cooked. it turned out just a little spicy but thats how we like it :) i also used beef broth instead of water for extra flavor. after it cooked about 6 hours i removed everything but the juice, put it in a skillet and added flour to make gravy for it! Served with salad and cresent rolls and will make again! The leftovers I threw back into crockpot with more broth (1 can) and the gravy and cooked overnight into a stew that i froze

This is pretty much the way I have always made pot roast.  Only difference is that I don't always brown it first.  But I do put salt, pepper and flour all over the roast.  This way, it makes it's own gravy and is never lumpy.  I use different seasonings - depending what I have on hand.  I have used steak seasoning, seasoned salt, garlic salt, etc.  They all work fine and are a matter of taste.   I use beef broth and beefy onion soup.  For veggies I use potatoes (for average size potatoes, I quarter them, for large potatoes I cut them into six or seven pieces), two average size onions quartered and carrots (baby or regular).  I use lots of potatoes because DH and sons love them this way.  This along with some rolls is one of our favorite dinners.  I cook on low in the crock pot for about 10 hours while I am at work.  The house smells sooooo gooooood when we come home!

Didn't need ANY liquid in my slow cooker for perfection.  Cooked nine hours and had plenty of liquid when done.  Don't add carrots or potatoes until last hour or they'll go mushy.  I like turnips done this way.

Fell off the bone if there had been a bone.  Very tender and juicy.  Used beef broth, Bay leaf, garlic cloves, Montreal Steak seasoning,  and Cream of Mushroom soup as recommended by others.  Marinated overnight in Red Wine Vinegar, Olive Oil,Garlic Salt, Pepper,liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and the kitchen sink.  Left out the potatoes and made mashed potatoes on the side. Cooked in slow cooker 7 hours on high and 1 hour on low.  Roast was 4 pounds and will feed many people.  Easy to make and will definitely be preparing this again.

This was fantastic! Based on the other reviews, dipped the meat in a flour and season mixture before browning. One thing I like about the recipe is that it is a everything but the kitchen sink as far as seasoning goes. Whatever I had, I threw in to the flour mixture. I assembled everything the night before and threw it in the fridge. I cooked on high for an hour as soon as I got up in the morning and then switched it to low and cooked from 8-6. The meat and vegetables were out of this world. The potatoes were soft but not mushy but next time, I might omit them and serve over mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again.

Exactly what you think of when you think of pot roast.  Just perfect! I lightly floured mine and then browned it - this way it made its own gravy; no need to thicken the juices.

I'm in LOVE with my crockpot!!  I don't know if it's legal or not...but we are forever joined at the hip!!
Great recipe...  I added 2 onions to the browning process.. and 2 more , cut in half, in the "pot".  I added abay leaf and a little worschester(sp??) sause .  I left out the potates and made mashed potatoes and gravy.  My secret little spice is allspice...try it!  It only takes about 1/2 a tespoon to give the roast a nice flavor and also a super flavor to your kitchen!! ? Really good !
...so easy and the roast was sooo tender.  I did 1 hour high and 5 hours low.   
  ummmmm!?   ?   ?
I would love to have a friend to chat with every day...we live waaaayy out in the boonies!  I really miss the "normal" life!  kelly  ?

THE BEST EVER!!!!!! The meat was so ridiculously tender!!! It literally melted in your mouth! I did marinate my meat overnight(in italian dressing) and I also took the advice of previous reviewers with a few other changes: dissolve 2 beef boullion cubes in the water before adding it in (you could use 1 can of beef broth for the same result), and add 3 cloves of garlic, chopped as well. I also added 1 tsp cayenne pepper to give it some kick. When it was done, I could barely keep my boyfriend out of the pot long enough to actually serve it up! Oh I can't say enough about this roast- it was THAT good! I will be reusing this recipe many many more times. Thanks sooo much Marie!

FABULOUS!!! I doctored this up a bit by adding 4 cloves of chopped garlic to the slow cooker after the meat, veggies and soup mix were in. I also used salt, pepper and season-all on the meat when I browned it in the skillet.  I have a 5 quart slow cooker and used 5 pounds of chuck roast, 6 small/medium red potatoes, a small bag of baby carrots, 3 celery stalks, about a 1/2 cup chopped onions and the garlic, . My slow cooker was FULL! I think the onion soup mix is what makes this sooooo good! I let is cook on low for 8 hours, only opened the slow cooker lid twice - and it came out FABULOUS!!! My family LOVED it and my hubby even said this is better than any he's had in a restaurant before. This is my new favorite slow cooker recipe and will be made many more times!!  :)

A fantastic basic pot roast recipie.  I marinated my (4 and a half lb.) chuck roast for 24 hours in red wine, worstershire, garlic, and italian seasoning, then patted it dry and browned it over high heat in a large saucepan for a few minutes.  I tosed the veggies, plus a couple of cloves of minced garlic, in the hot skillet just until they started to sweat.  I used a can of beef broth instead of the dry mix and poured it into the skillet to pick up the browned bits sticking to the pan.  I whisked in a tablespoon or so of tomato paste and some worstershire sauce, then layered the vegetables into the crockpot, lain the chuckroast on top of the veggies, put the lid on, and headed to work.  The scent of that roast when I walked in the door was magical!  I think next time I'll leave the celery out, because it got a little stringy, but otherwise it was a near-perfect meal.  Oh, and I served it with the mile-high yorkshire pudding I found on this site.

The best pot roast, and it keeps getting better each time I make it!  I did find it too salty so I didn't season the meat with salt before browning, and I add the vegetables about 1 hour before the meat is done.

Marie's recipe is wonderful!  [now to drive home a point about the reviews that don't follow the recipe and eventually leave less than stellar reviews]
I didn't use chuck roast because I had chicken instead.  I used my propane  BBQ grill because I don't have a slow cooker, and I used BBQ sauce because I like it more than onion soup mix.  I just loved those chicken thighs on the grill coated in BBQ sauce!!!!  Nice job Marie!!!
I don't expect this review to be posted ... more hoping to give the review team a chuckle.
I did use this recipe almost to the letter and is really WAS delicious!

I have made this recipe many times.  As many have stated it is a very good basic recipe which can be tweaked to individual taste.  I always read the reviews to get more ideas of how to make the dish.  Anyhow, I tweaked it to my taste and would like to share my variations.  I used a 5 lb roast, and 10 qt crock pot. I browned roast as described and placed in crock pot.  I omitted the Onion soup mix (just this time, because I wanted to try something new).  Add a large chopped onion, several cloves of garlic, coarsely chopped, & a generous handful fresh parsley, chopped.  Add 1.5 c. water & 1-2 beef boullion cubes and 2 bay leaves.  Shake or sprinkle over roast 2 TBSP each of the following:  Red wine vinegar, Worcestershire, soy sauce, brown sugar.  Sprinkle 1 TBSP smoked paprika, 1 tsp. each of dried oregano, garlic powder and onion powder & 1/2 tsp dried thyme.  Cover and cook on low 5 hours. Add vegetables:  Remove meat and set aside. Add 5-6 unpeeled red potatoes, chopped into large cubes, 1 lb baby carrots, 1 lb fresh Brussels sprouts & 8 oz. fresh sliced baby Bella or white mushrooms.  Toss to coat with liquid in crock pot.  Place roast on top of vegetables, cover and cook another 4 hours or more.  Serve with biscuits or sourdough bread.

I've been using this recipe for years, with onion soup, & a "Montreal smokehouse flavoring" I've seen mentioned by several reviewers, & about 3 cups water.  We like au jus style gravy.  It's just me most of the time now, but I will eat this for days!  AND, best of all, I get a large roast, & LOTS of veggies, & make hash with the leftovers.  I add fresh white onions (chopped) & mixed in, as well as old bread at the end of the grinding process, to facilitate easier cleaning!  HTH!!!

Nothing I like better than a meal that re-invents itself!

Very Good! I used beef broth as some others have recommended as well as adding 3 or 4 whole garlic cloves to the broth. Did not add my veggies until about half way through cook time and they came out perfect with very nice flavour. The beef broth I'm sure would make an excellent gravy though this time around I just used the sauce to moisten the meat and Veggies. I will make this agian. Thank you Marie for sharing this very good and easy recipe!

So easy, hard to screw up. I like my vegetables, therefore I use much more carrots and potatoes. I add in the veggies about an hour before serving, any earlier and it turns mushy. I cook the meat for 6 hours on high and it still works well.  Use red potatoes, it seems to hold up better than russet.

I have prepared this numerous times for my family in the past 3 years and it is a favorite!  The first few times I made it EXACTLY as written.  However, since then I have made 2 changes.  My family does not like cooked celery so I omit the celery.  Also instead of adding water, I add one can of Swanson's Beef Broth.    The carrots, potatoes and onion cook to perfection and the beef is oh so tender!!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  Although some people complain about reviewers modifying the recipe, I value the comments.  Without those comments, this site would be just like all the others.  Based on the other reviewers, I used 2 cups of low sodium Beef Broth and added extra baby carrots and red potatoes.  I also included the vegetables at the beginning because we like soft not crunchy vegetables.  It's really a person's personal preference that will determine when to add the vegetables.  I made a rub for the roast and placed vegetables at the bottom of the crockpot and added the meat.  I let this marinade overnight and started cooking in the morning.  It was a hit with the family and has become a keeper.    Thank you!

This was delicious.  My boyfriend and I ate almost the whole thing at one meal.  I used a one and a half pound chuck roast.  I kept all the other ingredients the same, so there was leftover sauce, which was fine with me!

Amazing! The only thing I changed was I added flour to the roast before I browned it and instead of water I used beef broth. Great dinner to impress with friends!

I'm not sure how such a highly rated recipe could be a dud, but this was horrible. The meat was tough, the vegetables undone, and it lacked any flavor other than salt. My husband told me it tasted worse than c rations. I wanted to have a simple and delicious pot roast recipe, but this wasn't it unless I made the 2,3421 changes that previous reviewers have, and I don't have time to read over hundreds of reviews to figure out how to make this recipe "passable."  Total waste of a decent roast.

This is an easy recipe and it yields a fantastic meal. I did make a few changes...first, I browned the chuck roast on both sides and then put it in the crock pot.  Next I added 3 potatoes (peeled/cubed), 3 carrots (peeled/bite size pieces), 3 stalks of celery (bite size pieces), minced garlic and 1/2 onion (small chunks).  Then, I mixed 1/2c white wine, 1c water, 1 pkg of onion soup mix, 1 pkg of McCormick's Slow Cooker Pot Roast seasoning and poured over the meat/vegs.  Put on the lid and let it simmer for 10 hours.  I did add more potatoes and carrots about 3 hrs into the cooking because there was more room in the crock pot.  Truly delicious comfort food...tender meat and vegs with the most tasty gravy!  Enjoy!

Made this last night for 4 people.  Only enough leftovers for myself the next day for lunch, plus some extra potatoes and carrots.  I used a smaller shoulder roast, somewhere between 2-3lbs, a bag of baby carrots, 5-6 small yellow potatoes and 3 smaller onions cut into quarters and 4-5 small cloves of garlic.  No celery just because I didn't have it in the house.  Like others I used the McCormicks Montreal Steak seasoning (I guess it's good) and beef broth instead of the onion soup mix.  I browned my roast in a cast-iron skillet.  I initially use 2 cups of broth instead of one and put the onions and garlic in with the roast and broth.  My roommate later added 1/4 - 1/2 of water when he added the carrots and potatoes for me while I was at work.  He added these extra things for me at the halfway mark because I was worried the carrots and potatoes would get too soft & mushy cooking for 10hrs.  They cooked for 5hrs themselves and came out perfect.  Of course the meat was awesome!  Next time though I'll use a bigger cut of meat and maybe a different cut.  Cook on low and maybe put your carrots and potatoes in at the halfway mark and it'll be hard to go wrong.  Also add some salt & anything else when you add the carrots and potatoes.

Tested this.   Potatoes need to be a minimum of one inch thick slices.  Cubing potatoes and cooking for anything longer than two or three hours makes them too soft and dried out.

Meh, don't know what happened since I followed directions exactly, but pot roast didn't taste like anything special and wasn't moist, veggies were rather firm, almost hard, and the "gravy" was just watery juice.  Leftovers the next day were even worse.  Next time, I'll try others' suggestions and add a can of cream of something soup.

OMG this was sooo good!  I did like the others and sprinkled Montreal Steak Seasoning on the roast before searing it, and used water/bouillon/sherry to deglaze the pan.  the rest I kept the same, except for adding 10 ounces of mushrooms (halved) and 20 baby red potatoes instead of regular potatoes.  Thickened the juices with cornstarch/water to make a beautiful and flavorful deep brown gravy.  Definitely will make again.

This recipe was SOOOO easy and tasty.  I did take some previous reviewers' suggestions by seasoning it with McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning first (only because I had it handy).  I tossed all the ingredients together into the crock pot dish and refrigerated it overnight, took it out and popped it in the crockpot in the morning and cooked it on low.  Delicious!

This was one of the best slow cooker pot roast recipes I have tried.  Used garlic, salt, and pepper to season the roast and also added a bay leaf which always in my opinion adds a little something to roast.  Still a great recipe

Comes out great. I took the liquid in the bottom to make a nice gravy by transferring it to the same pan I used to brown the meat and then reduced it and added a few herbs and a tablespoon of flour. I think you could add some more vegetables to it to make it even better and healthier.

Great basic potroast recipe.  I put my veggies in 2 hours before eating and they were perfect. Also, I used a rump roast instead of chuckroast and I had no problem.  Just let it cook longer and it will get wonderfully tender.

Terrific recipe - and I did follow some suggestions.  Marinated a 2 pound roast overnight with a little Red Wine Vinegar, Olive Oil, garlic salt and pepper.  When I browned it I added minced garlic towards the end so it didn't burn.  One can of Beef Broth was substituted for the water and I make a homemade dry onion soup mix (17 mg sodium compared to several hundred in the commercial packet).  I also added some small whole mushrooms.  We like carrots so I'll add more in the future.  The crockpot was set on high for 5 hours and low for an hour.  The meat fell apart and the veggies were perfect added at the halfway point.  I made gravy from cornstarch with half the sauce and we agreed it was better than the plain sauce.  And the house smelled like heaven!

I tried this recipe last night and it got rave reviews.  I followed some other users' advice and added the vegetables about half-way through the cooking, which worked perfectly as the vegetables were tender and not mushy.  Instead of chopped potatoes and carrots I used baby potatoes, peel on and whole baby carrots.  I also used 1 cup of beef broth instead of water and a packet of French Onion soup mix instead of regular onion soup mix.  In addition, the beef was coated in a liberal amount of Montreal Steak seasoning, which made it delicious, as well as a generous helping of Worcestshire sauce.  In the future, I think I'll add a 2nd cup of beef broth and possibly another packet of French Onion Soup Mix.  I like a roast with a lot of juice, especialy as I make it with Yorkshire pudding and use some of the sauce for making that.    One note, I didn't have chuck roast so I used a London Broil (which is usually a flank steak or top round roast).  Slow cooked for 11-12 hours, even it was falling of the fork tender.      This is a great recipe as I'd never made a roast on a slow cooker before.  Thanks!

I rubbed the Montreal Steak Seasoning on the outside of the meat first which gave it great flavor.  This was a wonderful meal and the leftovers taste even better!  Will definitely make this again!  Very easy to make.

This recipe makes a great base that you can customize easily to personal preference. I add some extra veggies. Next time I'm going to add maybe a couple of bay leaves and a handful of peppercorns.  As a busy single male on a tight budget, this recipe is one of my go-to options. Just made it last night. This morning i boxed up 7 individual meals for reheating at lunch and dinner. This is super easy to prepare, taking about 15 minutes to get everything in the crock pot and clean up, then another 15 this morning to portion it. And food cost was only about $13-15, for seven meals. Yay.

I have done a lot of slow cooking and I would have never thought of using a dry onion soup mix. Don't use the onion mix. It leaves a nasty Lipton soup aftertaste in the broth and I would wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Slow_cooking is great because it is usually fail proof , but not using this recipe

This recipe is amazing!  If you are thinking about trying it, you definitely should!  I took some advice of fellow cooks and put on the Montreal steak seasoning (actually a marinade packet I just happened to have), and put a bit of flour on it before browning the roast.  I did cut the roast in half to fit better in my crock pot.  Also, using beef broth was great.  My husband thought it was great (which is amazing, he is a picky eater).  He wants it every night!

This recipe is easy and quite tasty.  I made several small changes. Instead of using the called for 1c of water, I used ¾c red wine and ¼ c beef broth. I think this added a lot more flavor.  I also added  a small. can of mushrooms.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and roasted the sliced potatoes in olive oil, garlic and crushed black pepper and added (along w/ the canned mushrooms) an hour before serving.

The first time I make a new recipe I make it as written, how else can you judge it. I very rarely see a review here where the person made something the way it is written, try making it the way it was written first. Then you can get creative. I haven't made this yet but I will this weekend. Looks yummy.
I made the pot roast this weekend and found that I prefer my pressure cooker for beef. It didn't come out as tender as it does in the pressure cooker. Also it needs more spices. I'm always happy with the way my food comes out in the pressure cooker and rarely use the crock pot for this reason. Oh well. Sorry crock pot lovers.

Amazingly delicious and easy.  I grew up liking roast, but not loving it(usually it tasted dry). No more, this roast I made just burst with flavor and quite mosit.  My family loved it and it made me feel proud. No doubt I will be making this recipe many times again.

Easy for sure but tasteless.  Meat was fall off bone tender and vegetables were perfectly done. Even with the onion soup, the  remaining liquid had very little taste.

Great recipe!  I added the cup of water to the frying pan that I seared the roast in just to deglaze it.  I also added a can of mushroom soup on top of the roast.  Added a bay leaf and some fresh sprig of thyme , making  an awesome gravy. Used 1/4 flour and 1/2 cup cold water to make a slurry to thicken the gravy. Will make this again and again.

Turned out good. Lots of left overs! Used Beef Broth instead of water...next time I will use Chicken Broth. make sure to brown the meat first in a pan! meat was so tender and falling apart.

Wow, tender & great flavor! My husband has something against slow cookers, but I think this recipe will change his mind! I used only a 2-1/2 lb. roast, double the veggies & for suggested time...perfect! Thanks Marie!

Best pot roast ever. I've been making pot roast forever, but never added soup mix, usually just a little water and wine. I rubbed Montreal seasoning on the beef before browning, but think it wasn't necessary. I used the fabulous Dry Onion Soup Mix recipe from this site. My roast was about 5 pounds and wasn't done in time for dinner (6 hours low, 1 hour high), so with my timing mis-calculation, I stuck the crock in the fridge overnight, and reheated it on low today, then on warm when it was done. It didn't suffer at all, came out moist and fall-apart tender, picture perfect. I quartered red potatoes and added them the last hour of cooking. They were just right. After removing the potatoes, I strained the liquid and used a fat separator to de-fat the liquid. I was left with a perfect jus to pour over the meat and potatoes. I served it with Balsamic Glazed Carrots, also from this site, for an easy side. With a glass of Beaujolais, dinner was a hit. We'll use the leftover meat to make BBQ beef sandwiches tomorrow. Yum! As you see from my timing problems, this is a forgiving recipe. Try it! *UPDATE* Made this for the 2nd time just today, making only 2 minor changes that greatly improved an already yummy recipe. I seared the roast in a stainless steel skillet, deglazed the skillet with a splash of cabernet sauvignon, then sprinkling the soup mix over the roast in the pot. These 2 simple changes made it a company-worthy roast. My 3lb roast was done in 6 hours.

really easy and good. I followed other reviewers advice and added about 3 tablespoons of flour to the juices left in the crockpot after removing all of the meat and veggies to make a delicious gravy.

I was great.  It was very flavorful.  I put carrots and cabbage in with the meat (that's how my mom always did it.)  I was going to do potatoes too but already had some left over mashed ones.  Took some of the "juice" and made gravy.  YUMMY!

Loved it! Veggies were wonderful and not mushy even after 9 hours of cooking. Meat was tender, and held its shape. I made the gravy by pouring out the liquid into a bowl and whisking in flour. Added whatever veggies I wanted, but the mushrooms in the last half hour. No need to look for another pot roast recipe.

This turned out really well with my 2 lb pot roast.  I used a little keg steak seasoning and it was delicious. Added potatoes halfway through cooking, came out perfect.

I used Montreal Steak Seasoning, beef broth, and pearl onions. I added baby carrots and red potatoes at the 5 hour mark and cooked for five more. Thanks to another reviewer for the Sky High Yorkshire Pudding suggestion... I made those too and impressed my guests. I'll definitely make this one again. Yum!

Like many other users, I made some modifications to this recipe, but overall it was delicious!  After about 7 hours it turned out super tender, flavorful, and still moist...just like you hope for it to.  My modifications included using a herb rub (thyme, parsley, cayenne, salt/pepper, garlic powder, onion powder) on the meet before browning it, putting the vegetables in halfway through the cooking time, and using beef broth instead of the dry onion soup mix.  I also served with mashed potatoes, instead of red potatoes in the pot.  As my wife says, "this is perfect for a winter meal as it just makes you feel all warm and comforted inside."  I will make this again!

I have made many roasts in my slow cooker but I have to say this was one of the best. Besides seasoning the roast before browning with salt and pepper, I also sprinkled a little Lawry salt and garlic powder on it. We wanted mashed potatoes so I did not add them to the slow cooker. Excellent recipe, will be making my chuck roasts this way from now on. 9-21-11 Made it with the potatoes, carrots, and onions this time, delicious.

WOW!  What a fall-apart wonderful pot roast!  I read other reviews and seasoned my Boston butt roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning then added carrots and potatoes around the meat in the crock pot.  I sprinkled the onion soup mix over everything then added one can of beef broth, instead of water.  I put the crock in the refrigerator overnight and cooked for 8-10 hours on low the next day - delicious!

Husband said it tasted awesome. I used beef broth instead of water, and added the juice of two small tomatoes to richen the flavor and soften the meat further. I cooked it for 4 hours on high, until my thermometer reached "well done." The house smelled wonderful, too.

Amazing Pot Roast! I did double the dried soup mix and added 2 cups of water. I did not add the potatoes because I wanted to serve it over egg noodles. this recipe was fabulous!

This recipe is delicious and perfect. I follow it to a "t". I use a shoulder roast, which is lower in fat than other cuts and is very inexpensive. This is a less than $10 meal!

Always a favorite. Easy to tweak. Once you brown the meat and get your potatoes and carrots in there, open your pantry and just start adding stuff. Onion soup mix, worcestershire sauce, garlic, and a can of diced tomatoes is my favorite. I also throw in some fresh green beans if they're on sale.

That was super yummy! I didn't have onion soup so I subbed onion powder and a couple of beef bullion cubes. I added the veggies about 3hrs before serving, minus the potatoes since I didn't have any more space in my crackpot. With some gravy (cornstarch and au jus) it has instantly become one of our family favorites!

First thing I've cooked in a long time and first thing in my slow cooker. Turned out great. I had a 2lb joint so basically halved the recipe. I cut my joint into about 6 large pieces to make it easier to brown (with three garlic cloves) and fit in the pot but I wasn't sure whether to cube the meat or not - however whilst the food was cooking I was reading up on a cook book, they had all the meat cubed for most of their recipes so I ended up cubing mine half way through cooking! I also added another half a cup of water (1 cup total) so bring the liquid volume up a bit - gave me lots of gravy/juice at the end which was great. I also used 6 small red potatoes instead of 3, didn't peel - just scrubbed and quartered, 2 carrots and 1 parsnip. The carrots ,potatoes and parsnip went in with 4 hours to go and were pretty soft at the end (but just the way I like it). I was surprised though as a lot of the recipe books I saw said that vegetables take longer to cook than meat and to put them in first but they would have been mush if I had done that.  The quantity of food was more than I thought - I had seconds last night and have three portions left over for later in the week - two in the fridge, 1 in the freezer.  The only downside to this recipe is that it's not a set and forget (due to the vegetables) so you can't put everything in all at once and then eat when you get home.

Super easy to make! I rubbed the chuck roast down in olive oil and Ms. Dash steak seasoning and threw it into the crock pot w/o touching a frying pan. I took the advice of other comments and added baby carrots and red potatoes about halfway thru the day, (with the exception of the onion--that I added in the beginning along with freshly minced garlic), and I even threw in some diced green pepper which gave it amazing flavor. My boyfriend raved! Great for those on a budget as well.

Easy and delicious!  I've never been a fan of pot roast but I will make this one regularly.  The roast was tender and tasty.  I used quartered red potatoes from the garden and they didn't get too soft.  I doubled the amount of potatoes and carrots in the recipe and it was perfect.  The only other thing I did differently was I added two beef bullion cubes to the water.  I'm not sure if it was necessary but that's what I did.  The great thing about this recipe was that it, like most slow cooker recipes, was a no fuss supper.  I put everything in the crockpot in the morning and it was ready for dinner.  I also made gravy with some of the juices, which was a nice topping for the potatoes and beef.

This is the recipe I have been using for years. I do season the meat first and coat the roast with flour before browning and I used red wine instead of water.I usually do mine in the oven as I think it tastes better or I cook it 3-4 hours on high in the crockpot.

I used beef broth instead of water. And since I was home that day, I added the veggies 4 hours in since people said they were too soft - that I will NOT do again. They were still too crunchy at 4 hours later on low. The whole dish was actually better the next day. This recipe would be great for 10 hours on low while you're at work. Also, the largest roast I could find was just over 3 lbs., which was plenty to feed 3 with leftovers for 3.

I added in a couple cloves of garlic into my recipe, and I substituted the water for beef broth, which made for a wonderful and tender roast.  I also took the advice of another commenter and added the veggies half way through instead of at the beggining, and thank goodness I did!  The veggies came out perfectly cooked, any longer and they would have been mush!

Great recipe.  When I browned the roast in my cast iron skillet, I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of good red wine.  This really added a depth of flavor beyond beef boullion and onion.  My wife & daughter loved the potatoes in the gravy.

This is the best slow-cooker pot roast I've ever made!  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions:  rubbed the meat with Montreal Steak Seasoning before searing, subbed beef broth for the water, and added worcestershire sauce and fresh garlic to the mix...it had a nice kick to it that we all enjoyed!

This was DELICIOUS!!!!  When I read the recipe it sounded really good.  I told my husband just once I would like to top your Mothers roast!  After he ate this roast he said, "This is WAY better than my Mom's roast."  It was a hit!  Yea!  I did follow some of the other reviewers advice.  I added 2 bay leaves and more liquid.  I used 2 c. beef broth and about 1/2 c. water.  This was wonderful because I was able to make gravy.  I made a rub out of garlic salt and the McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning.  The combination of all of the ingredients gave the roast a wonderful flavor.  I cooked it for about 8 hours on low and the meat was falling apart.  Oh...so GOOD!  The only thing I would do different next time is add more veggies (potatoes & carrots)  Cant say enough-YUM!

This is total comfort food. I seasoned the meat with Montreal Steak seasoning before browning it. I followed the rest of the rest of recipe as written. After 8
hrs I removed the meat and veggies and added a little cornstarch to thicken the gravy. I added a splash of red wine which gave the gravy a rich flavor. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I had company for dinner and he said it was the 2nd best pot roast he ever had (next to his wife's).  I was very unsure about the one cup of water because it did not cover the meat so I added more but it still came out great.

I wish I could meet you & give you a hug for how good this meal was! I just got a crock pot for my bday and tried this recipe and it was killer! I coated the roast with the Montreal seasoning & browned it first as suggested by others and used beef broth instead of the water. It was absolutely fall apart delicious. Thanks for a great recipe.

I found this recipe very easy and very flavorful. I have tried several slow cooker roast beef recipes and this by far is my family's favorite.  Instead of 1 cup of water I used 2 cups of beef broth, this gives the added flavor one reviewer thought was missing.  I also used baby carrots.  After removing everything from slow cooker I poured juice in pot and thickened with brown gravy thickner for the gravy.
Delish!!

This came out very well.  I followed the recipe pretty well, except I omitted the celery and added a splash of Worcestshire sauce and some peas in the last hour of cooking.  I cooked it on low for about 7 hours, then cranked up to high for the last hour.  I also added about TB of flour to thicken up the gravy.

Very good.  I seared the meat in a skillet in a little bit of veg oil over med/high heat about 2-3 minutes a side.  I added 1 cup of beef stock instead of water and at the end I made a roux in a seperate pan using the juice from the crock pot then addind it all back into the crock.  So good.

Now this is GREAT pot roast from a slow cooker.  I used low sodium beef broth in place of the water.  I sprinkled onion and garlic powders along with black pepper on the roast.  After browning and moving roast from pan to slow cooker, I deglazed the pan with the can of beef broth and then poured the mixture over the meat.  I added shitake mushrooms and I bay leaf.  I did omit the potatoes as hubby wanted the beef served over egg noodles. Due to my work schedule the roast ended up cooking for 10 hours, I was worried that it may have been over done.  When we got home, the house smelled so good and the roast was perfect, very tender. This is REALLY REALLY good!  Thank you Marie!

OMG!  This was the best pot roast recipe ever.  I cooked it about 9 hours and it just fell apart, didn't even need a knife.  I never made anything better.  I used the beefy onion soup mix, beef boullion cube and a dash of worcestershire sauce.

I have made pot roasts this way for over 40 years. The dry onion soup mix and beef broth add great flavor, especially when the veggies absorb some of that flavor. I go lightly on the salt when browning, but use pepper and garlic powder liberally. As shown in the video, it adds a crust to the browned roast and that, in my opinion, makes the roast more tasty. Like many others, I also make gravy from the liquid. This is a no-fail recipe!

The only thing I do that's different is to eliminate the celery, which tends to make the whole thing taste a bit like beef stew, which always has celery. For me, the time to make stew is with the leftovers, all of which goes into the pot, and that's when I add the celery.

I don't rate a lot of recipes, but this was A+!  I omitted the raw onion (personal issues) and upped other veggies.  It's a perfect recipe, the veggies turn out so flavorful.  A keeper!

Chuck Meat is da bomb.   This recipe is very simple with superior results.   Thrown together on a Friday night right before bed.   Used Beef broth vs water was my only change.  I browned my seasoned meat all sides.    Added in some extra minced garlic to the crock pot since I love garlic.  Coarse cut about 1-1/2 pd carrot and red potatoes into about 3/4-1" cuts to toss in about 2 am (Mid-way thru cutting time).   Perfect veggies & meat.   With clean up and prep I would guesstimate 1 hr.   Not bad at all considering the servings u can get.

Tried it following receipe with no changes - awesome!!! 
The smell of the house alone while cooking makes you start 
Salivating- melts in your mouth good- so much for 
Trying not to eat red meat!

Great recipe!  Made two batches in two crock pots for a family dinner of 10. After the meat was in the crock pot and cooking, I prepared the vegetables and then put  them in the crock pot. Everything turned out great and wasn't over cocked.  I added extra portions of vegetables to fill up the crock pots.

It was great -- so simple and it turned out delicious!

EDIT -- After making this at least 10 times, I decided to follow the advice of the top reviewer, and prepared a gravy to go with it. This was fantastic -- I will always do this now. I added 2 cups of water rather than just one -- I am not sure there would be enough liquid for gravy if I had just added one cup.

This recipe was amazing and so very simple. I made a few adjustments to fit the ingredients I had on hand. I used beef broth instead of water, added carrots about 1/2 way through the 9 hrs the roast cooked. Right before serving I took about a cup of the juice from the crock pot and added 2 tablespoons of flour in a glass jar with a lid and shook the devil out of it. Then I added it back to the pot and it made the gravy a perfect consistency. I omitted the celery and was out of potatoes but I went and bought some during the day so I served the roast, carrots and gravy over mashed potatoes. Everything was a huge hit. My family loved it. I also served macaroni and cheese and green beans and my 7 & 5 year old boys told me it was "the best meal I ever made"

Delicious! I omitted the dry onion soup & used mccormicks pot roast seasoning instead. I used small red potatoes. Yum! After 8 hours on low it was perfect besides the fact the fat was still in tact. I kept it cooking for another 8 hours & it had fallen apart but very juicy and delicious!

It truly is easy & quite yummy. We had an unexpected event come up the day I cooked it, so I put the cooked meat in the fridge & sliced it up the next day & returned it to the crock with the vegetables & juices to warm it all up. The whole family enjoyed it that 2nd night.

When I seared the edges it filled the house with smoke, and I think it made the roast dry out actually. I cooked it on low for 8 hours which was too long.

Enjoyed it very much.  A note to ErnieG, the professional level cook.  I think your comments to reviewers were wrong. Cooking is all about tweaking; learning; experimenting. There's nothing wrong with changing a recipe; that's how new recipes are born.  Surely, you understand that concept, being a professional cook.  I'm sure your professional level cook friends would agree with me.  Life would be very boring if people did not experiment.  And professional level cooks would be out of business.

This was GREAT! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out delicious.  The only thing I might change for the next time is to buy pearl onions and baby potatoes, instead of having to chop the larger varieties.

This pot roast was delicious. I took advice from a few others and seasons my 2.5lb chuck roast with garlic powder, pepper, salt, onion powder and Montreal steak rub. Browned it on all sides in a little olive oil before placing it in the slow cooker. I added the dry onion mix and 2 cans of beef broth, and left it for 5 hrs on low. At hr 5 I added green beans and whole baby carrots and left it for another 2.5 hours. After 7.5 hrs I moved the roast and veggies to another container with a little of its own juice (the meat was falling apart). I took some of the juice from the slow cooker, mixed it w/ flour to make gravy. I served with mashed potatoes. Hubby loved it. Will make again!

We absolutely loved this!    Following helpful advice of others, I browned in garlic olive oil.    Used also plenty of garlic powder and minced fresh garlic.    Used 2 cans beef broth, onion soup mix,  baby carrots, and mushrooms.  We served with oven roasted seasoned fingerling potatoes.    Yum!!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Delicious!  I added more vegetables 'cause we're a veggie-lovin' family, but other than that we stuck with the recipe!  Oh, and I also added some ketchup with it - about three or so tablespoons.

This was amazing.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used beef broth instead of water, and put the vegetables in half way through instead of the beginning and it came out perferct!  I also didn't brown the meat due to lack of prep time in the morning, and it was still delicious.  I can only imagine if I had the time to bronw the meat first.  Thank you Maria for a great recipe!

Fantastic recipe / comfort food. Only negative reviews on this site are those saying it needs more flavor  -  so many reviewers, as did I, made a few simple additions.  Also must say the mushroom soup version also on the site sounds perfect if really crunched for time.  In this case I had time to play with it (which yes, does go against the "quick and easy" slow cooking concept...), so my additions were:
-  browned chuck in combo olive oil and butter after light flour and rub of salt, pepper and paprika, and added dash of balsamic vinegar while browning (all suggested by others...)
-  PEARL ONIONS, which take some time to prep but were FANTASTIC (cut both ends, blanch in boiling water one minute, move to bowl cold water, then pinch to peel)
-  1 cup beef stock, 1/4 cup worstershire, and a dash of red wine as suggested by others
-  baby carrots (perfect size, zero prep except maybe to halve larger ones)
-  once done, don't forget to remove fat from top layer of juices, which made fantastic gravy by whisking flour and bit of corn starch and simmering for a few minutes, and
-  As I also read somewhere, the next day leftovers reheated in a covered pot from the fridge with some gravy on top were BETTER THAN SAME DAY ! 
-  Slice and toast some french bread and your plate will be completely clean when you're done...
ENJOY !!!!!!

This is a recipe just as advertised - quick and easy.  Onion soup mix contains beef bullion, so those of you skipping the soup mix would end up with a bland roast.  Mine turned out great with water.  I used the water to bring up the bits in the pan I seared the meat in. Then poured it in with the meat.

This is an easy and customizing-friendly recipe. I give it 4 and 1/2 as written, and 5 with the addition of a seasoning rub on the roast before browning, and beef broth instead of water. Sodium count admittedly goes up quite a bit with this version. Thanks for a yummy family dinner!

i was really disappointed in this.  i left it in for a little over 8 hours, and the meat was barely cooked.  following other suggestions, i added more potatoes and carrots about halfway through--and the second set didn't cook.  the veggies i put in at the beginning had barely cooked at the end.  i'll have to keep playing with the slow cooker to find something that works!!

Great, simple recipe with a lot of flavor. I omitted the potatoes and mashed some instead. I didn't brown the roast due to time concerns, and it still came out delicious. The first roast we have ever ate every bit of. I rubbed the roast down with chopped garlic salt pepper, garlic and onion powder, then marinaded it overnight. I let it cook the full 7-8 hours and it was tender and juicy, and practically fell apart. The flavor was wonderful as well. If you haven't tried doing a roast before, I would suggest trying this recipe, thanks for sharing!

I joined Allrecipes just to rate this recipe!  The meat was so tender and savory.  I followed the others' suggestions ( Montreal Seasoning, baby carrots, beef broth) and out of my dozen (or so) pot roast attempts, this was by FAR the very best.

Wonderfully tender and moist!! We loved this roast! I made a few adjustments..i added an extra 1/4 cup of water and a cube of Beef Bouillon. I also took the advice of others and used the Montreal Steak Seasoning. I also chose to not cook any veggies with mine and served baked potatoes. I will definitely be saving this recipe.

I made this last night with a few changes.  I used beef broth instead of the water, and put in the veggies about the halfway mark.  When I added the vegetables I also added about 3/4 cup of water.  Everything came out great and cooked perfectly.  I used a 2.5 lb roast and cooked for a total of 8 hours.

This was amazing.  I did a rub with the Montreal Steak Seasoning, browned roast then added 2 cups of beef broth and just a splash of red wine vinegar.  Fantastic.

This was a GREAT and EASY recipe, especially for me as it was my first time making something in the slow cooker! I followed some of the suggestions mentioned.  I replaced the water with beef broth and omitted the celery.  I rubbed the roast down with Montreal steak seasoning and garlic, as well as putting garlic in the crock pot - my boyfriend and I are big garlic lovers! I used whole baby carrots, and I didn't add the vegetables until about 2 hours in.  I also had to add a little water after about 4 hours.  The end result was totally delicious and tender.  We will definitely be making this one again!

This was so easy to do, had great flavor but was not overpowering, and is very healthy and a great way to get your family to eat more veggies! I did add a little more water, since I was concerned about leaving it on for the day with only 1 cup of water.  I added 2-3 cups and it was perfect.  Great, easy recipe.

Really easy recipe! I didn't change a thing except for adding crushed garlic and more veggies. It wasn't AS moist as I would have liked, but we still enjoyed it. I'm still on the look for the perfect recipe!

This is a good recipe and also a good base point to start and let your creative side come out. I like to add brussel sprouts to mine, or you can quarter up some cabbage. I usually dont add any vegies other than onion and celery until about halfway through the cooking time. I dont like my vegies mushy, even though they are still good when they are a little softer. You really cant screw this recipe up, try it your family will gobble it up!

Good and easy.  I added the veggies half way through and they were still too soft.  Definitely add them in the last 2-3 hrs of cooking.

I did not give this recipe 5 stars because my roast was dry and tough, but I did not rate it any lower because it may have been the chuck roast itself that was the problem.  Per other reviewers, I used a cup of beef broth instead of water and added some Worcestershire sauce and a bay leaf.  I did not brown the roast before placing it in the slow cooker, I only added some garlic powder to the roast.  When the roast was done, I took the sauce and made a gravy with flour and water.  It was delicious!  I would also recommend placing the veggies in at the same time as the roast, as my veggies were slightly crunchy.

This turned out wonderfully for Christmas dinner! I used a slightly better quality roast than chuck roast, and I used beef broth. It cooked on low in about 6 hours. I spooned it into a serving bowl using a slotted spoon and added flour to the broth/drippings to make gravy. Fantastic!

Great recipe! I changed two things: First, I added a bottle of stout beer to the recipe. Second, instead of the dry onion soup mix, I used a garlic/onion mix from McCormick for potatoes that I had in the pantry. It was excellent! Highly recommend adding the beer! Also, I did not add in the veggies... kept it with just the roast.

This made a delicious roast and vegetables. I browned the roast in salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and used beef broth instead of water. My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.

I browned the roast with the Montreal Steak seasoning and garlic powder.  I only used celery and onions, added a can of Cream of Mushroom soup with a can of water.  I cooked it on high for 6 hours and it was delicious.  I added flour to the gravy and served it over mashed potatoes.  Delicious!

This recipe is simple and produced a nice, basic roast.  I love having an entire meal all in one crock pot.  Next time, I will make a gravy to serve along with the roast as I felt the roast needed it.  Otherwise, flavor is delicious.

This is not a good recipe. Everything in the pot ended up tasting the same after 9 hours - mushy and like salty powdered onion soup. It would probably would have been OK substituting a selection of spices and a can of broth and tomato sauce and leaving out the onion soup. Also the whole thing was extremely greasy - chuck is full of fat. A trimmed chuck eye roast works much better in a crock pot. Keep looking for a better recipe or just invent your own. Don't follow this one.

This was the first thing I ever made in a crock pot (about 4 years ago), and it is still in the rotation for weekend suppers. The only alterations I make is a smaller roast (2-3 pounds), and I usually skip the celery. The meat is tender and full of flavor, and it makes the entire house smell wonderful. It is a great recipe for a beginner in the kitchen, and it is an easy go-to recipe for company as well. Serve with some fresh-baked rolls and butter, and you have the perfect meal!

The only thing I added to this recipe was some dried parsley and coated the roast in the montreal steak seasoning and a little flour before browning. I also added the veggies mid way through cooking with about 3 hours left of cook time.

Very good, did brown meat in garlic, olive oil, basil and a bit of parmesan cheese. Use 1 cup of milk with 4 tbsp of wondra flour to spoon over whole bake potatoes.

I  add a can or two of beef broth in place of water and a package of brown gravy mix.  I also add a chopped onion, and quarter a small cabbage and lay it over top of the meat and other vegetables.  I use the leftovers to make either vegetable beef soup or stew.

This meal is AMAZING. It has become our special Sunday meal, our budget and diet splurge. I prefer to double up on the vegies and seasonings, but either way, this is easily our favorite meal. The only bad thing about it is the smell. Sitting in a house filled with this aroma can make you miserably hungry, but it's worth the wait.

FANTASTIC!  This recipe comes out so tender and moist.  It's not only great tasting but it sets your day free to do as you please.  Whenever we vacation, I pack the crock pot and several boxes of onion soup mix.  Any type meat will work.   Thank you Marie Thomas for sharing!

Absolutely delicious and incredibly easy. I've already made it 3 times in 2 months; it's cooling in my crockpot as I type. The only change I made was beef broth instead of the water, and added a splash of red wine. Meat is melt in your mouth tender, veggies are perfect after 8 1/2 hrs. on low. Next time I make it I'm going to try adding mushrooms and barley. YUM!

MY HUBBY SAYS IT'S A 9 (OUT OF 1 TO 10)...I USED A RUMP ROAST (AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE GUY IN THE MEAT DEPT) & ALSO USED A CAN OF BEEF BROTH,INSTEAD OF WATER (@ THE SUGGESTION OF MANY OTHERS)...I COOKED IT ABOUT 12 HOURS, BECAUSE THE MEAT DIDN'T SEEM TENDER ENOUGH, BUT THAT WAS OUR FAULT, AS OUR ROAST WAS A LITTLE OVER 5 LBS--I SHOULD HAVE CUT IT UP MORE THAN I DID...ALL IN ALL, IT'S A DEFINITE KEEPER & WE WILL TRY IT AGAIN SOON...THANKS FOR A YUMMY RECIPE!!

This was a great recipe! My husband and brother-in-law both loved it! I did substitute fresh mushrooms for the celery. And next time will probably add 2 packets onion soup mix and a little more water to make more juice as we love this over hot bread! Yum!

My boyfriend (who is an incredibly picky eater) and I loved this recipe.  I used garlic powder on the meat and olive oil to brown it.  I used beef broth rather than the water, used a 3 pound roast and cooked it on high for 5 hours and the meat just fell apart.  The vegetables were cooked well - the potatoes were not mushy at all and soaked up a lot of the lquid, tasted great!

Excellent!! I used red potatoes and shallots instead of onions. I bought a 1.75lb roast and that was a good fit for the crock pot I used. I think you'd have to have an industrial size pot to do a 4lb roast. Still did 8 hours and it was fantastic!

This was really good.  I used a smaller roast (2 pounds) and more veggies, but the meat was still pretty tender (cooked for 4 hours on low).  Instead of a cup of water, I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup white wine -- I think that added some good flavor.

Very easy to do. I skipped browning before I went to work, and since I hadn't any onion soup packets, I added 3 teaspoons of onion powder, 1 teaspoon of sugar, several beef bouillion cubes and left it as is. I stopped home for lunch to add the veggies and potatoes so they wouldn't be mush and the recipe was delicious. The boyfriend, who is not generally a beef fan, gobbled it up and sopped the gravy up with "Bread Machine Rolls", recipe also from this site.

From my husband, the best pot roast he ever had!!! I did use beef broth instead of water and added a cream of mushroom soup to it. We used the extra juices to make gravy with a little milk, flour, salt and pepper. It is excellent and so tender and juicey. Will definately do it again and again!

Delicious and so easy!  I had planned on a different vegetable for dinner, so I left the carrots out of the recipe and added mushrooms.  Since I did not have onion soup mix I substituted beefy onion soup mix.  Absolutely the best I've had in a long time!

Instead of salt and pepper, I used McCormick Montreal steak seasoning blend.  I didn't add celery.  I added a bit of bouillon to the water and a splash of red wine.  I took the vegetables out 2 hours early because they were getting very soft but the beef needed a bit longer.  We really loved this one!

This was SO easy to make! Since I'm a bit too busy to brown meat in the morning, I didn't do that and it turned out just as good! My husband and son both love it!

Nice recipe. Here is how I changed it. I added some leftover coffee from breakfast, a splash of soy sauce, a tch of worchestershire.  I know the coffee part sounds weird but just try it.  The gravy is awesome.  Couple cloves of garlic. I also added some beef broth.  Veggies I did in the steamer.

Wonderful recipe. Came out great first time I made it. Before browning the roast, I sprinkled it with a small amount of garlic powder, plus the ingredients as indicated. I also substituted one 14.5 ounce can of beef broth for the water. I followed the good advice of another reviewer and reserved the potatoes and carrots, adding them about half way through.

Even my mother who has cooked Roast for years said it was the best she ever had. LOVED IT. I used organic meat, and cut out the celery, put in baby portabellas and did the rub as another review suggested, making her own type of Lawrys seasoning:  (ground peppercorns, sea salt, 1 tsp garlic powder,paprika)

Other mods:1 tsp worcheschire sauce
3/4ths cup of baby bellas (baby portabellas)

We really enjoyed this. I like a bit of a tomatoe base to my pot roast so I added a big spoon full of tomatoe paste and combined it with the soup mix, water, & veggies. I took some of the advice here and browned the meat, added 2 table spoons of worcestershire sauce & a 1/4 cup of red wine & a sprig of Thyme. The sauce was AMAZING. I found that the soup mix makes it very salty! I would avoid using it next time and just spice it up myself. I will be making again and again for sure!

mmm..mmm Ok I marinated the roast the night before with inserted slivers of garlic into the roast, 1 bottle of beer, onion soup mix. The next day I tossed the marinade. I sprinkled a cracked pepper steak seasoning on the meat before browning. I mixed new batch of the same (onion soup 1 bottle of beer)for the crock pot but added 1 c. of water and 2T. ofworcestshire to the mixture. I put sliced mushrooms on the bottom of crock pot with the sliced celery. I added sliced rings of onions on top of roast before putting on the lid. Hour #9 I added the carrots and cooked for 1 more hour. No room for potatoes so I made mashed. Add some flour/water, salt/pepper mixture to the juice. Put on stove heated to thicken for gravy. Served sliced meat on a plate with a bed of muchrooms, onions and carrots underneath. Used leftover meat and gravy over noodles next day.

The entire family loved it.  I used a 5lb Beef Chuck Cross Rib Roast.  Seasoned all sides of the roast with granulated garlic, salt and pepper.  Browned all sides of roast.  Placed roast in slow cooker.  Pour onion soup mix on top of roast.  Pour can of cream of mushroom soup on top of roast. Added three  peeled and cubed large russett potatoes, five sliced celery stalks, two cups baby carrots, 1/2 yellow onion.  Replace water with double the amount of chicken broth and pour on top of roast and vegetables. Sprinkle with italian seasoning. Cook on low for 7 hours.

I cooked this yesterday and it turned out to be the best I have ever cooked!!!  I think my main problem in the past has been wrong cut of meat. This time I had beef chuck roast and it made a HUGE differnece.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was add one more cup of water and a little more veggies.  After the roast was complete I took some of the juice, put it on the stove and added some cornstarch to make a thick gravy.  FANTASTIC!!!!

I have always been cursed with dried out tasteless pot roasts--if you are one of those people you have to try this recipe! I have made this for my family 4 times now and every single time it is moist and delicious!! We all love it--and my kids are not easy to please!

very savoury...this was my first ever pot roast, using a slow cooker for the first time.  It turned out so tender and delicious, my husband raved about it, saying it was the best he'd EVER tasted.  I chose this recipe b/c there was no cream of mushroom in it.  That said, I took some reviewers advice and rubbed steak seasoning on it, and browned each side first - and just used the onion soup mix and a bottle of beer (amstel light) plus about a cup of water. I made the veggies and potatoes seperately.  mmm!

Very nice recipe that was well liked by both kiddos and adults.  I did double the soup mix and water, as we love our gravy, which I thickened prior to serving over mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again, perhaps substituting beef broth for water.  Thank you for a definite 'keeper' recipe!

Absolutely a scrumpdidillyumptous recipe... made one major addition.  Added 2 apples, wedged about 1 hour before completion.  Minor seasoning included bay leaves (3) and hungarian paprika to taste.  Liquid is so flavorful that I used a little of it to render a fine brown gravy for biscuits.

my husband loved it. I will never make a pot roast any other way. I took advise from other reviews and used montreal steak seasoning rubbed in then browned meat before putting in the slow cooker. I used beef broth insted of water it was wonderful. I also used mushrooms insted of celery. I finished it off making gravy from the juice with a little flour and water. It was fantastic. I will make it again and again.

This is very good. I seasoned w/ Montreal steak rub, doubled the liquids (used 1.5 cups of beef broth and 1/2 cup of red wine) and cooked overnight.  Also I threw in a whole bunch of mushrooms for the last 2 hours of cooking time.  I suggest defatting the liquids. I scraped off about 1/4 inch of fat off the top after putting the liquids in the fridge for the day. UPDATE: a great way to use leftovers is to cook some rice in beef stock and mix it in with the pot roast and veggies.  Let everything gel by cooking together in the pot roast liquids and add spices of your choice.

I made this for a Christmas party and it seemed too good to be this simple!  Everyone raved on how delicious and fall apart tender it was.  I use two peices of 2 lb chuck roast, seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper.  I also used a can of low sodium beef broth as well as water.  We didn't have nine hours to cook, so we put on high for 7 hours.  After I took out the roast, my mom took over the gravy duty and used the leftover juices, flour and water (I don't know how to make gravy).  This gets five stars from me because it was so easy to make but everyone thought I slaved in the kitchen.  Very yummy!

MY FAMILY LOVED IT!!!! I used a 3.5 lb CHUCK roast and I DID NOT brown it. I mixed the onion mix with the salt and pepper and rubbed the roast with it, cut the roast in half the sprinkled the left over on top. I then used cut onions, potatoes, & carrots. I put the roast in the crock pot on low at 10;30pm on Sat. and it was AMAZING at 12noon on Sunday for Lunch. My kids even asked for seconds. That NEVER happens. ENJOY :)

Incredibly tender and delicious! The only modification I made here was that I didn't brown the meat first; I just put it in the slow cooker after preparing the vegetables, but it was falling-apart tender and wonderful! Everyone who ate it loved it and I'd recommend this recipe to anyone. Perfect for chilly fall evenings!

This is delicious!!! the first time that I made a pot roast, it was a disaster...so I found this recipe, and it turned out so well! It is so easy! I season flour with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder and sear the roast on both sides before putting it in the crock pot with a can of beef broth...it is a weekly staple in our house!

Eating the leftovers now. If not for the Montreal seasoning, this would have been lacking in flavor. I use Montreal seasoning on all my beef. This pot roast is good, but I have made even better. Just not enough flavor here for some reason. It needs something to kick it up a bit. The next time I do this, I think I will add peppercini. It does not make it hot at all, just adds flavor.

I made this last night and it is one of the best tasting and easiest Pot Roast I ever made. The carrots and potatoes turned out like oven roast. My husband asked if we could have the left overs again the next night. Thank you Marie for a great recipe.

We love this, my 12 month old and 2 1/2 year old do too.  We use several small red potatoes halved and add a can of cream of mushroom.  I also like to mix the water, soup, and soup mix together and then pour over the roast, it's easier to mix.

This is a winner!  I did make the following changes after reading the reviews & will make the same changes again next time.  I seasoned the meat with Adolphs Tenderizer & garlic powder & then browned the meat in a skillet first.  I also added minced garlic to the cooker (about 2-3 cloves) and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup (will add the whole can next time).  I added a beef bouillon cube to the water & stirred in the french onion soup mix as well.  I added more carrots, onions, and celery & omitted the potatoes (I served mashed potato casserole on the side).  THIS IS FABULOUS & I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!  Thanks, Marie & other reviwers!

This recipe is great! I seared it using olive oil, pepper and garlic. I also used beef broth instead of water, and fresh mushrooms instead of celery. This is a wonderful cold-weather comfort food, and so easy, too! I made the "marbled mashed potatoes" recipe to go along with this, I highly recommend it! Yummy combo!

My family absolutely loved this recipe. I added a bay leaf to the recipe for the last thirty minutes to add extra flavor. The meat was wonderfully tender and juicy. I suggested to my husband that I may add some garlic cloves next time, but he told me not to do anything that may mess up the recipe...he loved it that much. This will become a staple in our household.

The roast was very tender and tasty. But the potatoes had an odd flavor, it seemed like the potatoes took on the flavor of the carrots. I probably will try this again but I will leave out the carrots and see if the potatoes taste better.

Excellent! I did everything the recipe said,  except I added 1-1/2 Cups of low-sodium beef broth and 1/2 cup water,  and 3/4 T of Worcestershire sauce.  I browned a 3 lb. Chuck roast seasoned with kosher salt, pepper and garlic powder. After like 7 hours I pulled the meat out and all the vegetables then the thickened the gravy using a little water, flour and gravy master. I added more red potatoes after like 5 hours, I think I used something like 11 potatoes in all. I actually forgot to add the onion I bought, it probably would of even tasted better. I will definitely do so next time. It still was the best pot roast I ever had! An excellent recipe.

Also,  after browning the Chuck in the skillet, I used a 1/2 cup of beef broth to deglaze the skillet and then poured all that great great flavor right into the slow cooker.  It's the little things that matter. Great recipe. My whole family loves it.

The way it is, this recipe is great.  It is basic, and the meat is delicious.  The carrot and celery cooked in with the meat add flavor to the liquid that will become gravy once thickened a little, and are an important part of the recipe.

Followed to the T and was disappointed. Meat was tender, but beyond bland. Lacked a considerable amount of flavor.

This was excellent.  I made it exactly as directed and it was just delicious.  It was even better the next day.  I cut everything up cubed size, heated it up and served it over egg noodles.  A great winter dish.  Thank you Marie!

Really liked this. Added minced garlic to the bottom of the slow cooker first for a little extra flavor. I also added a few more carrots.

Very easy and great results. 
I used only 2.5lbs of beef since its only my husband and myself and added tons of veggies. I also added some garlic powder to the meat. It came out perfect! Thanks for the recipe.

Tried it today with a few tweaks... Rubbed a 3.5 lbs roast with kosher salt, gd black pepper, dried thyme, rosemary and little bit of Lawry's season salt. Then, melted butter and added chopped fresh garlic in large frying pan until garlic was fragrant, and browned the roast on high heat for 4 min each side (just imagine the aroma... Yum!) Cut roast in half, transferred to heated crock pot, followed by larger chunks of chopped carrots, celery (no potatoes, served mashed potatoes on the side), and the packet of dried onion soup mix (which would experiment by leaving out next time).  

Then in the same pan for browning, added large chunks of chopped onion to sauté quickly, then deglazed with ~ 1/2C red wine, and poured it over the meat and veggies in the crock pot, added 1/2 C of water to pan (would use unsalted beef broth instead next time) to really get the last bits of the deglaze off the pan, and added to crock pot.  With only less than 6 hours till dinner, put the crock pot on high heat for about 4 hours, stirred the pot and checked for doneness/tenderness with a knife, then changed to low heat for another 1.5-2 hours. Turned out pretty well given the reduction from 9 to 6 hrs of cooking in the crock pot.  Will experiment with more tweaking on next try!

Very good! Didn't have time to brown the meat before work, so in it went. Also realized too late that I was out of potatoes, so I used extra carrots and celery, bought potatoes on my way home, made gravy from the juices and served it all over mashed potatoes. Husband approved. I've been using Chef John's pot roast recipe, but this one is just as good and less fussy. Thanks, Marie!

As my first crock pot recipe, I'm glad I picked it. When I tasted the gravey at the bottom of the pot, I realized it needed some extra spices. I added salt, pepper, oregano, basil, parsley, and garlic powder. Upon these additions, it tasted delicious. It was a good recipe, but need a bit more flavor. Easy fix.

Love this recipe!  I have made this a few times now and it always comes out great.  I get a 3 pound chuck roast, brown it on both sides and use whatever amounts of onions, potatoes and carrots are on hand.

This was so good! The only changes I made were: omit the celery, add more carrots, and I made my own onion soup mix (3/4 cup instant minced onion, 4 teaspoons onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon crushed celery salt, 1/4 teaspoon sugar). I'm making it again tomorrow :)

Even better if you make small slits in the meat before browning it and insert slivers of garlic.  If you like root vegetables add a few small turnips or parsnips.  I always add extra carrots too and sometimes leave out the onion soup mix.

This was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I followed some on the tips from others like using beef broth instead of water (although I had to use half beef and half chicken cause that's what I had =D). Other than that I followed the recipe. It was soooooooooooooo good. Super tender and made for great leftovers for lunch =).

Best pot roast I've ever had! I didn't have any Onion Soup Mix, so I found a recipe for it here. I think it was even better. Ours was done earlier than 8 hours, too, so keep an eye on the roast.

I've made this 5-6 times now, and it's always a winner.  I always try to follow the original recipe precisely the first time through (unless something seems seriously out of whack).  The vegetables do turn to mush if you add them at the beginning ... it's a delicious mush, but mush nonetheless ... so now I always wait until about halfway through. Being able to see the vegetables makes for a nicer presentation, I thinkand a nicer bite.

I also double the vegetables and use beef stock instead of water.  The addition of red wine sounds like a great idea.  I will try that next time.

Thank you, Marie, for many pleasurable meals.  :-)

I made some changes:
Used a can of beef broth rather than dry onion mix and water at the begining.   I browned the meat in garlic, paprika, salt and pepper like another reviewer mentioned.  cooked down with a sliced onion.  4 Hours on low.  Then I added 5 small red potatoes cubed, the top 1/3 of a bunch of celery, using both leaves and the stalks. I added a double handful of baby carrots to fill my crock pot. Then I opened a cream of mushroom soup can over the top of it all. I added more paprika and stirred.  High for 3 hours and then low until we ate it.  My husband, the good Midwesterner he is loved it.  I thought it was pretty good, rich sauce, but not gooey.  We just added salt and pepper to taste at the table.  Meat fell apart and was enough
to be satisfying, but there were enough veggies round out the meal.   I served it with bread and butter.   
For the future, I would serve it with even more veggies, like maybe some sauteed cabbage in the bottom of the bowl, and probablly home made bread. If i had more room in the  crock pot I would have made dumplings.

I used 2 cups beef broth, some Montreal Steak Seasonng and a little Worchestire sauce instead of plain water.  It was very moist and it was good but I think it needed a little more salt or something to give it a little more flavor.  I would add more spices next time.

Oh. MY. GOD.
    haha that about sums it up! This is a delicious and super easy weeknight dinner. Even my 1.5,  3 and 5 year olds devoured it! I took other reviewers suggestions and seasoned/seared the meat first and the results were amazing. I may just have to add this to my weekly menu list! :)

Changed nothing.  It was perfect, tender and fell apart when I took it out of the crockpot.

This was so easy and yummy!  The only change I made was to use beef broth instead of water.  I prepared everything the night before and my husband put it all the the slow cooker the next morning at 8 am...supper was ready by 6 pm.  The meat was extremely tender.

Wow! You guys are turning me into a freakin' chef! The roast turned out very tender and my husband couldn't get enough of it. I used beef broth instead of water and coarser vegetables (whole baby carrots, vidalia onions quartered, and small red potatoes halfed with skin on.) The vegetables were added half way through and turned out firm but tender. Yummy recipe!

I've made this recipe for years now and just reviewing/rating it now- You can't go wrong with this. It's simple! I followed the directions mostly *(didn't use the veggies- only 1 large vidallia onion I sliced and put under the chuck roast) browned first and then put in the crockpot for 8 hours on low. yum. house smells so good while it's cooking.

Pretty good, but with some changes.  Would have received a five star if the meat had fallen apart. Used a 2-3lb chuck roast, seared in pan before putting in slowcooker.  Started roast on high along with all veggies for 2 hours before reducing to low.  The broth was a can of beef broth, 1 can water, and half can merlot wine.  Pulled meat out after 5-6 hours cooking and sliced, returning back to slowcooker to marinate in broth.  Meet was juicy and very flavorful, much more tender than I expected. Will make again.

Very good!  I used a 2lb roast but added more carrots, onions, and potatoes after I adjusted the serving amount.  I also added the whole packet of dry onion soup mix for just 4 servings.

Will definitely try again!

PERFECT!! First time ever, and I'm a 70 yr old guy! Have cooked all my life, but never pot roast! Cooked the meat for 10 hrs, added the carrots, potatoes, and bell pepper during the last 4 hrs. Maintained a constant temp of around 175*-180*, and it was cooked in a CAST IRON 5 qt DUTCH OVEN w/lid. Put the Dutch oven on one of the oven racks, and suspended the rack over the elect. range coil, leaving about 1/2" gap. It was a bit tricky, but it's doable, using 4 small tuna cans as supports at 4 corners. Dialed the elect. burner knob to "low", and adjusted the temp/burner know with a cooking thermometer as a guide.!

This had so little flavor.  I even used beef broth instead of water based on other reviews, but that didn't help matters.  My family did not care for it at all.

I was torn between 3 and 4 stars.  I thought this was o.k. Did make exactly as directed in crockpot.  I thought it needed more flavor, but I think as versatile leftovers it is good.  We are planning on making barbequed beef sandwiches with this.

The first time I made this I added a green pepper and everything else was as described (although I always brown using Montreal steak seasoning).  It was very good.  The second time I made it as described but it was bland.  Just made it again, added 2 bay leaves, lots of garlic and a beef bouillon cube.  Very good.  I just have to remember to add the other ingredients next time.

This is the exact recipe I grew up with and it's just like MOM used to make.  The only variance I've made is that I replace the water with beef broth or beer.  Excellant! moist tender awesome!

This is a great recipe, I use whatever large cut is on sale at the butcher's. I also add: 
~1 can Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup 
~Either beef broth or Low Sodium V8 instead of the water
~1T garlic powder or 2 cloves fresh garlic depending on what I have available

This has become my husband's favorite Sunday dinner in the fall & winter months.

This was a great tasting roast. It was so tender. I used bags to make roast so they would be tender but after I have used this recipe I would not make it in a bag anymore. I only gave 4 stars because there is no way 3 potatoes is enough to feed 8 people. There was two of us eating and we had maybe 3 small potatoes cubes left. No not a big eater lol hubby is but not enough for 6 people.

Made this for mother's day and it came out perfect.  I rubbed a 3.5 lb roast with salt, paprika and cracked pepper before browning.  I added cubed potatoes and carrots plus 3 cloves of garlic, one medium sliced onion and one cup of beef stock to the crockpot and let it cook on low for 8 hours.  When it was ready I added flour directly to the crockpot to make gravy.  The leftovers were even better.

As the title says...this recipe is super easy. I just put prepped everything the night before. It also helps if you season and/or marinade your roast like 24hrs to 36hrs before you brown each side. The flavor of your seasons will have a better effect. I was able to put everything together before leaving for work. And by the time I arrived home it was ready. A nice hot meal was ready for me and my 3yr old. Again, you will not be disappointed with the recipe.

Came out very well, but would suggest adding more carrots, potatoes, and celery since the veggie to meat ratio is low in the regular recipe. Hit with the hubby!

I've never made  pot roast.  This was an easy recipe..... I did as suggested and seasoned the meat with Montreal seasoning.  I used beef stock instead of water, saute minced garlic and onion, then also added green beans.  Excluded the celery (not a fan of celery :/).  Let it on low for 10hrs - vwala!! It was wonderful!!! Thx!!!

I didn't have any onion soup mix on hand so I added one can of cream of mushroom and a 1/4 Worcestershire sauce. I also added potatoes, and replaced the water with beef broth. As someone had previously suggested I let it cook for eight hours even though my roast was only a little over 2 lbs. It was so juicy and tender!

Highly recommend.This was really good! Only things I did different was put one more celery stalk in, two beef bouillon cubes, and I cut up my roast into cubes. This made it where it was falling apart in only 6 hours. Very good recipe!

The only thing unique about this recipe is browning the meat before adding it to the crock pot. And 1 cup of water is nowhere near enough to cook the vegetables. This recipe needs a lot of tweaking to be useful.

This is our go to pot roast recipe now! I've even printed it and put it in our recipe book! So easy and delicious, and the prep time is minimal.

Few tweaks:
Use only 1/2 package of the soup mix;
Replace the water with beef broth; 
Put all of the ingredients in the crock pot, sprinkle the mix over top, then pour on the broth. 

If you want to treat yourself, omit the potatoes and make mashed potatoes to serve it with instead. AMAZING.

Wow is all I have to say. Top 5 Meals I have ever had. Used a small 3 quart slow cooker so had to scale down all the ingredients. Used a 2 lb chuck roast seared with montreal steak seasoning. Added veggies and a can of sliced mushrooms and the package of onion soup mix. Simmered 3 hrs high and 6 hours low. Although delicious and flavorful, I didn't feel I made enough potatoes, so I made some instant mashed potatoes. Then I took the liquid from the cooker added 1 and 1/2 cup water and 1/3 cup flour and made a delicious gravy. Came out amazing. I think the mashed potatoes made the saltiness of the roast more subtle.

Yep - the name of this recipe just about says it all, except that it tastes AWESOME, too :)  Followed recipe exactly but did add a couple of stalks of celery to it.  Thanks Marie, for posting this basic recipe that most think they know, but don't really know.

Really tender and a great change from my usual with mushroom soup.  I did leave out the celery as I hate it and took the advice of others and added garlic and some Worcester sauce.

I only gave this 4 stars since I did follow the advice of the other reviewers.  I used 2 packets of dry onion soup mix, substituted the water with beef broth, eliminated (personal preference) and added mushrooms.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours and the last two on high.  The family loved it.

This turned out amazing.  I read other reviews and took some advice.  I used a little over 2lbs of beef, but still cooked it the full 9hrs.  I would highly recommend this.  It was so tender it fell apart and the vegetable were still in tact and not all mushy.  I added 2 packages of onion mix and it gave it more flavor.  I also added a small amount of Worcestershire along with red pepper.  I also used 1/2 a cup of vegetable broth and 1/2 a cup of water for more flavor.  It turned out amazing and this was the first time I made this.

This recipe is quick and easy to put together. I used a can of beef broth and 1c of red wine instead of water. Don't skimp on the slow cooking by cooking on high - I've been doing that for the last year when making roast, and we really haven't been enjoying it. I decided to give it the full 8 hours on low today, and it was melt-in-your-mouth tender! I won't try to rush the cooking any more. Great recipe, thanks!

Will definitely make again.  As with any stew, I also tossed in some fresh green beans and a zucchini that I had on hand.  Lightly salted & peppered the veggies before tossing in.  Only had a 2.5 lb. chuck roast, but since my family usually eats more of the veggies than the meat, it worked out perfect. Actually tasted better the second day.  I did use a slow cooker liner which helped with the cleanup.

Deeeelicious. I just made this and am enjoying a hearty bowlful now. I made a few changes. Instead of using just water or broth I used Guiness which gave the meat a nice slightly sweet complex flavor. I didn't have the vegetable much problem others had, probably because I kept the meat on the bottom and piled the veggies on top. I did switch them around so the meat was on top about 2/3 through the cooking time so nothing dried out. The meat is perfect...falls apart with a fork and tastes incredible. The veggies still have some texture to them. I've been craving this taste for months! The best part is that I have Guiness left over to enjoy a glass with my meal.

Yummy, easy, basic recipe that leaves room for lots of variations!  I have a 4-qt slow-cooker so I went with a 3.22 pound chuck roast and cut the large fat slab off before cooking.  I went with quartered potatoes and carrots only, layering 1/2 of them on the bottom of the pot.  I then added most of the onion soup mix and a can of beef broth instead of the water.  I did brown the roast in a pan with a bit of olive oil after seasoning it with montreal's steak seasoning.   I had to cut it into a few pieces (it was big for my little pot!) and stuck them on top, sprinkling the rest of the onion mix on top of them.  I followed the cooking time, but added the other half of the veggies for the last couple hours.  That was BY FAR the best suggestion, those came out perfect!  In addition to the mushy delicious veggies on the bottom :)  This was super good and easy and I will be making it again for sure!!

I don't like beef roast but I loved this one.  I tried it because my husband is the beef eater and he loved it too.  So from a non-beef eater, this is definately worth trying.  Made no changes because I don't usually eat, nor do I cook beef so didn't know where to begin modifying it but it was great the way it was.

As some other reviewers recommended, I substituted red wine and beef brother for the water. Also, I added an extra carrot, a few extra stalks of celery and used about 6 baby red potatoes. With the extra veggies, 2 cups of both red wine and beef broth were required to cover all the ingredients in my very full slow cooker. The end result was amazing. The meat was so tender and delicious and the veggies were that perfect mushy texture. We had a ton of leftovers so I froze half and plan to eat it soon - can't wait!

Super easy recipe.  Made a few adjustments - added 1 cup of beef broth and 1 10.75 oz. can of cream of mushroom soup because there was not enough liquid.  Added mushrooms half way through the process and omited the potatoes because I served roasted red potatoes on the side.  Excellent for a snow night in!

OH WOW!!!!! This is BY FAR the best roast I've ever done and it is so much more flavorful than just using onion soup mix and cream of mushroom soup. My husband could not stop raving about this! I did add the following: Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves pieces, beef broth (2 cups), 4 garlic cloves sliced, Montreal Steak Spice low sodium, and I cooked it for 15 hours (overnight). I omitted the potatoes since I knew they would be too mushy with the longer cooking time. We didn't eat the other vegetables b/c they were obviously too mushy, but their flavoring made a fantastic gravy. I served it with mashed potatoes, garlic broccoli and salad with the homemade ranch dressing from this site. What a meal!

I made this and it was very tasty. I used another rater's suggestion and put in red potatoes and left skins on. Just washed them and cut them in half.

AMAZING! My first attempt at making pot roast and it turned out great. I did take other reviewers recommendations and use beef broth instead of water in the recipe.

Flavor was good but the potatoes turned into a big mushy pile - but I guess that's to be expected in the slow cooker. Next time I will trim the roast, the fat was hard to see with all the mashed potato on it.

This was tasty but it did't knock my socks off.  I like to make pot roast in the crockpot but it certainly is NOT my forte.  I'll continue my search for the recipe that makes me and my family go Mmm Mmm. What I liked about this recipe was the vegetables included in the recipe so there was no need to cook things separately.  I did substitute 3/4 cup of water with red wine.  I do think this addition was a nice enhancement to the flavors.

This was a HUGE hit. My only changes: I seasoned the roast with s&p plus paprika, beef broth instead of the water, I added a few cloves of chopped garlic and a few splashes of Worchteshire sauce. My bf was literally in love with it and it was so easy! I cooked 2 (2lb.) cuts for 9 hours.

I have always done my roasts this way, but with one small change.  I add the potatoes and carrots 4-5 hours into the cooking time so they don't turn into mush.  If I'm not going to be home while it cooks, we'll have it with mashed potatoes or rice and steamed veggies.  YUM!

Fabulous!!! I followed the advice from other reviewers and rubbed the chuck roast with Montreal Steak seasoning and seared it on high heat on all sides.  I have a steamer basket that fits in my crockpot so I waited an hour after I put the roast in and then peeled the potatoes and cut them up along with some carrots and then put those in the steamer basket and placed that atop the roast.  They were cooked PERFECTLY!!  My husband literally could not stop raving about how tender this roast was.  This was a HUGE compliment to me cause we've been married for 8yrs and for some reason or another I ALWAYS screw up a roast.  FINALLY one turned out!  This one is DEFINATLEY a keeper and will be going onto our menu rotation!

This was awesome! Before I started, I gave the meat a nice rub with Montreal seasoning. I exchanged the cup of water for a bottle of beer (12 oz.) and it definitely made a more robust broth, but not overpowering. Also added a beef bouillon cube, but everything else stayed the same and very easy to make! Delicious and hearthy for these cold weather months!

Very good recipe, though after reading so many people's comments, I'm interested in trying it again with variations: particularly adding garlic, paprika, Worcestershire and red wine, and substituting beef broth for the water. But even as is, it's a very good recipe, particularly good on a cool fall night. The place smelled wonderful while it was cooking.

When it comes to easy.slow cooker.pot roast this is pretty much perfection!  As far as method/steps go I do hold off a few hours before putting in the veggies.  A keeper!

I put the veggies in then the browned roast and cooked it 8 1/2 hrs on Low all night.  Oh what a wonderful aroma to wake up to.  I think I'll do it in the day time next time and all the veggies about 3 hours from end.  But it was oh so good over rice!

Awesome flavor! I actually used a Boston Butt pork roast instead of beef and it turned out wonderfully. The meat was falling apart tender, juicy, flavorful. Just like Mom used to make!

This recipe was very good. I left it in the slow cooker alot longer than I should have because I ran into things I had to do, and it was still very tender and great tasting.

This is super delicious and super easy.  I threw everything in the slow cooker this morning before we left to go shopping and came home to a wonderful aroma!  This cooked about 9 hours and the roast and carrots were perfect.  My potatoes and celery were mushy but that was my fault.   I should have cut them into bigger chunks.  We shared this tonight with my mom, brother and nieces and there were no leftovers.  I will make this again.

This came out really well. I cooked it for 9 hours. I think any longer might've been too long. You could add other veggies to this, too. It could practically feed a small army, too. We have tons of delicious leftovers!

Awesome. Followed some of the others suggestions. Substituted beef broth for water; added two cloves of garlic; added about 1/4 cup of worstcheshire; made mashed potatoes separately; added baby carrots instead about 2 hours before it was done to keep them from getting too mushy. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about this. Definitely need to make rolls for the gravy/sauce. This is a keeper. MAKE SURE you get close to a 4 lb. roast - it was a little hard to find in the store.

I found this recipe a few years ago and it has been in our meal rotation ever since! I add a little bit of garlic when browning the meat. Also, in addition to the onion soup, I add a few dashes of Worchestershire sauce and a diced clove of garlic. We love this recipe!

Nice recipe.  Rather than use all water, I used half water and half sherry.  What a great flavor.  I thickened the juices with Wondra Flour which made an excellent gravey.  A sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley completed the presentation.

Been making this for awhile now, it's incredibly good.  I coat in montreal steak seasoning before browning, deglaze pan with red wine, add all that to the crock pot along with a couple extra of sliced onions (we love onions).  I leave the potatoes out and make mashed separately.  Shred up the leftovers, add some low-sodium beef broth and frozen mixed veggies for a delicious soup!

I used just over 2lbs of round roast, but didn't half the recipe at all. I used steakhouse seasoning and browned the beef first. I added about three cloves of minced garlic, and about 3/4 cup of wine. I added some worcetershire sauce, and beef bouillon granules. I had french onion dry soup mix (Liptons) and I used the whole pouch. Also added some red pepper flakes. Very good. Tasted like stew...not much difference, really, except less gravy. Slow cooked it on low heat for about 9hrs....excellent.

The meat came out sooo soft and tasty..everyone loved it.  I put some steak rub on the roast for extra flavor. The veggies were soft but I like them that way. My roast was done after 7 hours on low.  Will definitely make this again..thanks!

This worked rather well with the additions of other readers: Before browning, I seasoned the roast (I used round steak) with flour, garlic salt, pepper, paprika. I added about 1 tbspn of Worcest. sauce, along with about 2 tbspns of minced garlic.  I used a 2.75 pound roast, and still had to cut it in half for my small crockpot. It had a little bit of a processed flavor- I think next time I'll use seasonings I have rather than the french onion soup mix. 
Just a note for everyone confused about timing for smaller roasts- if you use a small sized crockpot it WILL cook faster than 8 hours. Mine was flaking apart and delicious by a little over 6 hours, any more would have made it dry. Thanks for the post!

I love this recipe! First meal I made in my new slow cooker, I followed a few of the other reviewers suggestions, using Montreal Steak Seasoning, and also adding the vegetables later on in the cooking process. I add the potatoes and carrots when there are two hours cooking time left and the rest of the veggies, sometimes I will add corn or peas or experiment with others in the last 30 minutes to an hour of cooking.

This is a great recipe and I have made this many times. I also add mushrooms and turnips. I have a marinade recipe that I use and let the roast stand overnight. This is eating at its best

I had high expectations of this recipe as I am pretty good at judging how a recipe will turn out just from the listed ingredients, but unfortunately this recipe turned out to be a mess & caused me to ruin 4 pounds of exspensive roast!! I believe myself to be a very good cook and I can usually "correct" any mistakes in most recipes...but this one, well there was really no help for it as it had no flavor, the juices were way too watery & by the time the meat was done it had fallen all apart. Had this been cooked on a regular conventional stove and a little more seasoning it may have been alot better as it would have given the juices a better chance at thickening up & flavor time to cook into te meat. In my opinion, forget about this recipe all together & try the "awesome roast beef" recipe on this site... definitey 5 stars!

This was fantastic. Even my 5 year old thought it was great. I did tweak it a little. Took the advice of one of the reviews and added worcestershire sauce, garlic and cilantro instead of parsley. I also deglazed the pan I browned the roast in with 1/4 cup of red wine, let it boil for about 2 minutes and added the remaining liquid to the pot.

This was delish with the change of adding the steak seasoning prior to browning the meat.  I also added the potatoes and carrots mid-way throught the cook time.  Added the onions and celery in the beginning.  Very good...and I am not a fan of beef stew type dishes.  The meat was superb!

Super easy & very tasty. I added parsnips and used unpeeled Fingerling potatoes I had on hand. I didn't add salt or pepper since there was plenty in the onion soup mix. The only thing I would change is to remove the visible fat from the roast before cooking. The roast I used was only 2.5lbs, but there was a ton of fat. Easily skimmed off the top, but next time I remove it before placing it in the slow cooker.

Finally my first successful recipe in my new slow cooker.  I don't eat red meat but my hubby does and I try to make a pot roast for him once a winter.  He loved this recipe!!!  I tasted it and thought it was a bit salty so next time I plan to rub the roast with pepper and a little paprika and hold off on the salt.

Took 9 hours to get really tender, used a 3 lb. roast.  Next time I will add a bay leaf and not put my veggies in until half way through.  Now I know why my roasts in the past haven't been this tender, I wasn't cooking them long enough at 6 hours!

What a perfect fall dish.  Made as the recipe stated, except minus the celery for personal preference.  Made the house smell wonderful.  Did not brown the meat, slow cooked on low for 8 hrs and everything was perfectly done.  Did not make a gravy with the leftover juices as the meat and veggies had tremendous flavor on their own. Will make this at least once a month.

FABULOUS roast!  I put green onions in instead of a regular onion for some more color.  I cooked on high for about 3.5-4hrs.  Definately doing again!

I only give this three stars because my roast came out a bit tough.  I probably should have put it on the bottom of the slow cooker instead of a bed of vegetables.  I like my roast to be able to be pulled apart by fork and I had to cut it with a knife.  Will try again and tweak the recipe some more to make the sauce a little more gravy like.

Made this last night- good starting recipe but I tasted it while it was cooking and found it a bit bland.  So to spice it up a bit- 1/4 c wrcesteshire cause, 2 tbls garlic powder, 2 bay leaves, rubbed the chuck with paprika, and marinated it in red wine vinegar the night before and it was very tender.  I would also leave out the carrots next time as the potatoes picked up an odd flavor from them and I like my potatoes to taste like potatoes.  
Thanks for the recipe!

I made this today and it was very good. The meat was so tender and I made a gravy with the juice at the end.  I did not put potatos in the cooker, I made garlic mashed! A nice change and a hit at the table!

Perfect way to do a pot roast. I used a small, one pound plus, pot roast and froze the rest (one pound) for later. I used only beef broth instead of water, added the carrots and onion and set it to high about an hour before the eight hour time period. Delicious.

Excellent no fuss pot roast.  I too added about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup beef broth to make more gravy which I thickened at the end of cooking.

Awesome pot roast, the only thing I did was add a couple bouillon cubes, and added a few more potatoes,carrots, and another onion. Left everything else the same. This is a keeper at my house. Thanks

Came out VERY good, the smell while it was cooking was making me SO hungry!  I took the suggestion of other reviewers to use Montreal Steak Seasoning and flour to coat the roast before browning.  I'll definitely make this again.

Easy, tasty.  I've made multiple times for pot-roast loving husband.  Tastes just as fine not browning first.  At suggestion of another reviewer, I add about 1-2 Tb Montreal Steak Seasoning to give it a little extra punch.  Also used 1.5 lb roast with same proportions - no problem.  Great recipe!

1st time cooking a roast, and it turned out absolutely FAB!  My roast was only 3lbs, so and I cooked it for 7 1/2 hours and it turned out perfect.  I added as much extra veggies as I could fit in the pot and my boyfriend and I gobbled it up with some left overs perfect for our lunch tomorrow!  Oh and I added a clove of garlic too.

This turned out perfectly!  Meat was juicy and tender, and veggies were yummy!  The only thing I did differently is add more water (cuz' we like lots of veggies and gravy) but I should have added another package of soup mix.  I also cooked it on high for 4 1/2 hours.  Makes great leftovers and the kids CHOWED!  Thanks!

For ease of preparation you cannot beat this!  The only change I would suggest is to coat the potatoes in the onion soup mix and salt them before adding the beef to the crock pot; I neglected this the first time I tried the recipe and the potatoes turned out slightly discolored.  After that, however, no problem!

excellent!  As suggested, I used beef broth instead of water. I also added garlic and only half of the onion soup packet, i didn't want it to taste "packaged."  I added a bit of chardonnay(needed to get rid of the last 1/2 cup from  bottle!) and some fresh rosemary.  Served over egg noodles.  Great basic recipe to alter as you please to suit your familys taste. I am going to put the leftovers on potato buns for lunch. mmmm.....

This was absolutely delicious!  I had my father and brother-in-law over for dinner, and decided this would be a good hearty meal.  I did use beef broth as some had suggested, and doubled all the vegetables and potatoes.  Well my brother-in-law who puts ketchup on EVERYTHING, didn't even use it tonight, and I even put it out for him.  That is a compliment all in itself.  Even my picky 2 yr old loved it!  This will definitely be a staple in our home.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

I chose this recipe it because of the reviews.  Someone expressed how tender it was.  I have never (until now) made a roast that was tender.  This may be becuase of never looking at a recipe before, but you could cut it with a spoon---I did.  I used a 6.3 lb roast and cooked it 10 hours.  I don't know if it was the cooking time, the browning of all sides prior to cooking or the cut of beef, but my parents loved it!  Thanks.

This roast was delicious. I cooked in the oven, not a slow cooker. I cooked 2 1/2 hours, 325 degrees, adding vegetables for the last hour. Very good taste.

I used a packet of Simply Organic French Onion Dip and seasoned the meat with a touch of garlic salt and lots of fresh cracked garlic pepper. My whole family loved it and that's saying something as I have picky eaters!

This was a great recipe. So easy and I love the fact that you can have a roast dinner any night of the week! I added a bit of Bisto in the end to add flavour and thicken the gravy. While it was wonderful as is, I will try a few changes next time. Perhaps I'll add garlic and omit the celery. I also love the taste of rosemary on beef, so I may add some of that also.

This was an excellent recipe that our whole family enjoyed!  I accidentally used a "dry vegetable soup mix" in lieu of the onion...however it was extremely tasty.  Can't wait to try it again.  Thanks

This was a good recipe, but I took the advice of others and made some changes.  I added 1 can of beef broth in addition to the water.  It gave me just the right amount of juices for gravy.  I added 1 tsp of minced garlic and doubled the amount of carrots and celery.  My roast was 3.5 pounds and I cooked it on low for 8 hours.  I will make this again.

This was ok, I just wouldn't make it again unless these ingredients were all I had on hand. I prefer the Awesome Slow Cooker recipe on this site (it's much better).

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  My husband has had a taste for pot roast so I ventured in to the slow cooker arena.  The meat fell apart as I took it out, and the vegetables were perfect!  I thickened the gravy a bit with cornstarch mixed with water and it was great.  This will become a staple in our house.

Good and easy. I didn't have onion soup mix, so I used onion salt and some dry minced garlic. I also added beef cubes like suggested from other reviewers. I wasn't able to fit the entire roast in whole, so I cubed it. It worked out great. I will probably continue to cube it. They were still very tender, and it was easy to serve right out of the crockpot! Thank You for the recipe.

This pot roast was delicious and so tender.  I cooked it for almost 11 hours since I was waiting for my brother in law and his fiancee to arrive for dinner.  I wanted to make sure that it was hot and I figured that a little more heat could make it tenderize more.  I used some Montreal Steak seasoning to season the roast before I browned it.  Absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

Good basic recipe, I always use onion soup mix with a pot roast, or meatloaf, it gives great flavor.  BUT, you need more vegetables with this.  3 potatoes and 3 carrots are not going to give you 8 servings, especially when carrots cooked with a pot roast taste so good! Depending on size, use 5-8 potatoes, and at least a pound of baby carrots, if you can squeeze in more, then do it.

Amazing! I omitted the carrots and potatoes but otherwise followed the recipe.  I also made some Knorr Brown Gravy to go with it but it didn't even need gravy.  It was so moist and tasty on its own!  Will definitely make again!!

I don't have a slow cooker and I didn't put the onions in (too lazy) and didn't have the celery.  I used a beef broth for the water and wrapped the pot roast tightly in foil and cooked at 300 degrees for 4 hours.  The house smelt glorious and it was very good.  I'm sure with the slow cooker, onions and celery it would be even better but I made do with what I had.

This is my first successful attempt at cooking a somewhat ambitious meal. It was incredibly easy. I used the broth and I used about 10 oz instead of 8. I also only got 2.5 lbs of roast and threw in a lot of extra celery and carrots. I was nervous since a couple hours, in all of the juices had the liquid level almost above the veggie and meat level. It all came out perfect though. I added a little corn starch to the juices to thicken it a bit. I started this at 6pm and woke up at 3am to finish it. Unfortunately I wasn't all that hungry so ended up reheating it around noon.

Thought it was bland, and the meat was not juicy and fall apart. Certainly didn't have the flavor or good ole stove top pot roast. Maybe if my cut of meat had been more marbled, it would have been better. I followed the recipe exactly.

This was soooo good, my husband had thirds! I used baby carrots and red potatoes. I forgot to start this in the morning so I cooked the meat alone on high for 3 hours then added the veggies and cooked for 2 more hours. Delicious! Next time I will do the 8 to 10 hours on low. Thank you for the recipe!

Marie, my mom used to make this exact recipe but in a dutch oven on top of the stove, but used to make a gravy at the end with flour.  It was always delicious and we ate every scrap.  So, I know before making it that it is a 5 star recipe.  Thank you for sharing something that has probably been passed down through your family for years.  Bravo for a great recipe.  I'm going to buy a chuck roast today!!!

I tweaked this with 2 bay leaves and used College Inn beef broth in addition to the water. Next time I will use the beef broth instead of the water. This was finished cooking (a 2.53 lb. chuck roast) in about 5 hours on low in my crock pot. Next time definitely will use more carrots and celery. Also when I browned the meat, I liberally used salt and pepper and garlic powder. Really turned out well!!

Excellent! Used bottom boneless roast. Less fat  but was so tender you cut it with a fork. Dillion's.  Can make gravy with juice. Potatoes mushy- put in later or fix separate.

Great, easy, yummy crockpot recipe! I was looking for something hearty, quick, and a full meal and this was it ! I decided to add Brussels sprouts and a cubed sweet potato. I also took other suggestions and used beef broth instead of water. I only had 6 hours until dinner so I cooked the meat on high by itself for 1 1/2 hours, added veggis and cooked in low for the remaining 4 1/2 hours and it turned out great !

First time making pot roast and this was amazing!  My family and I loved it. I used red potatoes which held up great during the slow cooking process.

Good basic dish...just what I was looking for.  I used a two pound chuck roast; you will still need to use one cup of water if you want to make gravy (I didn't want gravy).  The liquid was very oily but that's to be expected from this cut of meat.  I cut two russets in half and placed atop the meat...they came out perfect for us:  Not soaked through with 'juices' nor falling apart.  Very tender and tastes just as you'd expect:  Meat and vegetables :-)  I used Wylers Mrs. Grass onion soup mix.  To me Lipton is too salty.

This came out so good. I put this to cook for my first day back at work. I used chopped potatoes, whole baby carrots and onion. my crockpot is a small one so I used a 2lb roast so I tried just half the seasoning packet and 1/2 cup of water but at 6 hours  it wasn't seasoned enough I added the rest and another half cup of water and put it on low for another hours. I served it over rice with a pasta salad! My husband loved it so I am putting this in my recipe box!

Ok, my 2cents...add a can (14.5 oz) of chopped tomatoes on top of the soup mix. I omitted the potatoes and the celery and put the veggies on the bottom of the crock, then the meat. I also shook some garlic powder on top of them. I serve it with egg noodles that have been tossed with butter browned bread crumbs. I can eat the whole pot myself!

This recipe does not need any changes, it was great as is!  However, the second time I made it, I had a leftover bottle of red wine and I poured in about 1/2 cup of wine and decreased the water to 1/2 cup.  It was divine!

I made this for my husband and my good neighbor for lunch yesterday and we all agreed that it was THE BEST pot roast we had ever tasted!
The meat was so juicy and tender (as opposed to dry and stringy, as my pot roasts usually are!) and the flavor was unbelievably delicious.  The only changes I made were to add beef broth instead of the water, some browned garlic and 1/2 cup of burgundy.  I also LIGHTLY floured the meat along with the salt, pepper and a smidgeon of paprika.  I cooked the dish on high for 2 hours, THEN added the carrots, potatoes and the onion and let it cook for an additional 2-1/4 hours (for a total of 4-1/4 hours).  Unfortunately, I used a 
2-1/2 lb. roast figuring that would be enough for three diners --- and it was.  But I am now sorry I didn't use the larger roast so that we could enjoy the delicious meal a second time!

This was a great recipe! Reading the tips from others was really helpful. I seasoned the meat and then seared it on all sides before marinating it in the slow cooker pot in the fridge with the veggies and some potatoes over night. I used onion powder, parsley, garlic pepper, salt, and pepper for seasoning. Also, I added a can of chicken stock, 2 cans of water, and some Worcestershire sauce for the marinade. I also threw in some minced garlic and one sliced onion. Another recipe told me I should put everything on the bottom of the slow cooker and the meat on top. I did that and cooked it on low for 10 hours. It was amazing and completely fell off the bone! The potatoes came out beautifully. I used five small Yukon golds and next time I would definitely make more and add another onion.

Best thing I've cooked in my crockpot yet!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't brown the meat first and I added beef bullion to the water. Perfect amount of meat and veggies. A little bland but a little salt took care of that. Next time I might add sone Worsteshire. This is a great recipe as is or to spice according to your tastes.  Thanks Marie!

I made the pot roast exactly the way the recipe said and I loved it! I made this for my boyfriend who said that I needed to cook for comfort foods and he loved it.  I made no additions or substitutions and couldn't have been more pleased with the result.  Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!

This was good.  I used a slightly less fatty cut of meat, though.  Also I cut six or seven little slits in the meat and stuffed a fresh garlic clove in each of them before browning.  The meat was super tender and fell apart and the my husband poured the leftover liquid all over his meal and loved it.

I used the Liption Beefy Onion soup mix and this was probably the best crock pot roast I have made. We really don't care for it out of the crock pot, but it's a great after-work alternative. I do suggest the Beefy Onion mix. I also seared with the Montreal seasoning.

I loved making this pot roast. First thing I ever made in the crock pot. Im so inspired now that I bought a crock pot recipe book! I skipped the onion and celery.  Everything turned out wonderful. Next time Im making beef gravy to go on top when served!

I have tried SO many pot roast recipes, and I am always so disappointed.  Do NOT deviate from REAL CHUCK ROAST MEAT.  This recipe was so good, I made it for my family and then doubled it the next week at a large church gathering.  NOTHING was left over.  Fantastic.

This was my first crock pot dish--amazing! Big hit with the family. I made some minor tweaks as well. I didn't have any onion soup mix so I added 1 1/2 cup of broth with some Italian spices instead of the water. I also added one clove of garlic, crushed. 8 hours was perfect. Great Recipe!

This dish was good but the potatoes were a little hard.  I had to cook longer.  Very easy to make.

Really enjoyed making this recipe. My husband and my three year old loved it!! The only addition I made was 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce. I will continue to make this over and over. I hope others try it as well.

I keep making this awesome pot roast. Brown the meat with montreal steak seasoning, use beef broth or bullion. Make sure that you use enough liquid to cover the meat, even if you have excess liquid to discard. Chill liquid overnight to skim some fat, then make the gravy any way you please. I've used red potatos or Idaho. Both are good. Thanks for the recipe and enjoy!

I have ALWAYS used this exact recipe for a venison roast.  Gets rid of the "wild game" flavor, tenederizes, and I add a spoonful of dijon mustard as well!

An absolutely wonderful and basic pot roast recipe!  My grandmother would make something like this in the oven and I could never quite get it like hers.  This is the closest I've ever came to making it just like hers.  Thank you!

I couldn't believe how good this turned out!  I left out the celery, added some red wine, doubled the soup and veggies, sliced the roast into 1/4" slices plus I cooked it on high for 3-4 hours instead of on low for 8-10 (I lack the advance planning required for cooking things on low).  I thought it needed moisture, so I ended up adding a couple of cans of beef broth.  I'm not sure how it would have turned out without all the extra broth, but it was good the way I did it.  You'll need a large slow cooker if you do it my way.

The best pot roast I have ever made.  I browned it using montreal steak seasoning and garlic powder.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and added to garlic cloves.

I did as other reviewers suggested and rubbed my chuck roast in Montreal seasoning, then I marinated it overnight in the fridge with the beef broth (instead of water) and some onions and garlic. I let it cook on low for about 10hours while I was at work.  When I got home and tasted it, it tasted fantastic. THEN I had to put the veggies in and thats where it went down south. I boiled the carrots and potatoes for a few mins before adding them to the pot so they could soak up some of the flavor...problem is I had to add more juice (ie water) to cover the potatoes, which of course watered down the seasonings.  Maybe next time I will figure out something different to do with the veggies and keep the roast.  Definitely think had I let them cook all day they would've been mushy and gross.

My family enjoyed this recipe!  It was my first pot roast so I followed the recipe but then realized there was not enough veggies for my veggie loving family.  I boiled about 2 cups of mini carrots & 2 more large potatoes and added them to the pot for about another hour to soak up the juice.  I also added a can of beef broth because we like more juice then the recipe called for.  I will be making it again with these changes!

Delicious.  I made this without browning (to save time) and it turned out quite good.  I did marinate the roast the night before with a dry rub.   My fiance loved it the pot roast with mashed potatoes.  The next night I shredded the left overs and we ate shredded beef tacos.

I made this for my grandma and aunt, but I did not try it.  I used a 2.5lb roast with 1 packet of Lipton's beefy onion soup mix, 1 cup water, 2 carrots, 5 medium new potatoes and a small onion sliced.  As suggested, I seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning  and seared in a cast iron pan with hot olive oil, then added to the crock and cooked on high for 4 hours.  They both said it was extremely tender and really good.  They ate almost all if it, just the 2 of them, for dinner. :) Thanks for the recipe!

Very good pot roast recipe. Ours was very tender. I did need to add more seasoning so we used Nature's Seasoning and then invited the neighbors over - it was all gone! Everyone raved about the flavor and tenderness.

I used a 2.5 lb. chuck roast seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I substituted approximately 1 T. onion powder for the onion soup mix, and doubled the liquid using half water and half beef broth.  I also added whole garlic cloves and half an onion cut in large pieces and placed around the roast.  Good recipe.

Basically a good recipe but the length of time was too long for my slow cooker, maybe mine is just not a very good one, fairly inexpensive, maybe there are better ones on the market.  I added several more carrots and potatoes because if this is supposed to be servings for 8, the amount of carrots and potatoes would only be a taste, not a serving.  I added my own seasonings because I do not like the additives that are put into the packaged seasoning, not healthy.  I do not like using the commercially prepared mixes with all the additives.  As a cancer patient, I try to prepare our foods as healthy as possible.

One word...DELICIOUS!  This was beyond easy!  I browned the roast on all sides and then put it in my slow cooker, added all the veggies on top with the onion soup mix and beef broth (instead of water).  I set that puppy on low and when I got home from work, aprox. 10 hours later, the whole house smelled wonderful!  All I had to do was set the table and serve!  It was a huge hit with the family.  Everyone requested that I make it again soon.  Thanks Marie for sharing!

Wow talk about one heck of an awesome meal. I used a cup of red wind and a bay leaf in addition to the existing recipe. I'm not a cook by any means, but this is simply wonderful. Let it cook the full 8-9 hours on LOW! Melt in your mouth good...

I've used this recipe for years and it has never failed me - only difference I make is I use a cup of red wine instead of water...I also add a can of cream soup such as mushroom or celery, makes it's own gravy with this.

Not to Bad! Trying out several new recipes for pot roast, mine turned out a bit dry, but overall pretty good.

I used "Dry Onion Soup Mix Substitute" from recipezaar, also I used the water to deglaze the pan and added a can of diced tomatoes and a bay leaf.  It came out very moist and everyone liked the flavor (even the picky kids)

I used a much more expensive cut of meat, rolled and tied (because it was on sale and cheaper than chuck!), small new potatoes (whole and unpeeled), a fistful of baby carrots, a whole onion and a stalk of celery in halves.  I added the onion soup mix and 1 cup of water, turned the slow cooker on to low and in 8 hours had a very delicious meal.  I cannot imagine a less time consuming, easier to prepare and serve meal.

Browned roast first, used beef broth instead of water, and after removing the roast and veggies made gravy at the end by throwing in a boullion cube and added to rue.

So good! and easy! i was only cooking for four people so i used 2 pounds of chuck roast, and got some tips from other reviews and browned it in olive oil and Montreal steak seasoning. i also added garlic and Worcestershire sauce and omitted the celery. i added the veggies halfway through so they wouldn't be too soggy like another reviewer said, and it turned out great! very tender! everyone loved it. for dessert i made mixed berry cobbler.

This was so tender and yummy!!  I never made a chuck roast before so I really didn't know what to expect, I was thinking it would be chewy.  This had such great flavor and the meat fell apart on it's own.  I didn't use the onion (didn't have any on hand) so I used dried minced onion and I used cubed red potatoes with the skin on.  We loved it!!

It was my first time making a pot roast and I think it turned out pretty good.  I followed the recipe except I added minced garlic, mushrooms, a bay leaf and worcestershire.  I also cooked it on high for about 5 hours.  Great for a cold winter day!

This recipe was wonderful.  The only thing I did differently was that I added the vegetables about 1/2 way through the cooking time.  The leftover meat made excellent taquitos

We enjoyed this roast. I used half red wine/half water instead of all water, but next time I would use half beef broth and half red wine. I would also season the roast a bit before searing. Otherwise, we enjoyed it, and the veggies!

This is similar to a recipe I've been using for quite some time. Instead of water I use about half a bottle of red wine (zin, cab, whatever cheap wine I have on hand) and add a can of Golden Mushroom soup. I also add fresh sliced mushrooms (the kind in the bag since it's easy, and the whole bag) and 2-4 cloves of minced garlic. I don't include celery, and I use red potatoes and usually baby carrots instead (easier). The side dishes I serve with it are typically a green salad with a sweet (balsamic or raspberry) vinaigrette dressing, Gorgonzola, onion, nuts (pine, walnut, whatever I have on hand) and biscuits. Excellent and VERY easy winter meal.

I used a 3 1/2 lb roast and it came out great. I browned the meat in a little olive oil and garlic.  I used one can of beef broth instead of water. I added the carrots and cooking onions about 2 hours in and added the potatoes(small yukon golds) with about 3 hours remaining. I let it cook for 10 hours. The meat was a little fatty, so I might use a sirloin roast next time. The flavor was wonderful.

We have always made pot roast but wanted something different this time. This was excellent my husband loved it. I made some crescent rolls and used the juice as dipping. I left out the celery and instead used cabbage.  My 5 year old daughter and 1 1/2 year old son loved it as well..they're plates were clean. Awesome recipe and if it wasn't for the reviews I would have passed this recipe.

This might sound silly, but I love this just as written, I also sub the water with, hhmmmm, tomato juice, maybe bloody Mary mix, have used 7 up, root beer, diet coke, they all turn out fantastic, soda help tenderize.  Thank you for posting for everyone.  I have a small electric roaster and I can start it at 9 and my staff has a fantastic lunch by 1230.  Cant  buy them pizza at this price.

Very good recipe. The meat came out tender and moist. I also added a can of beef broth instead of water and added some fresh garlic. I also rubbed the meat with some garlic and onion powder and a little bit of garlic salt. Next time I need to remember to add a bay leaf and some paprika.

I always have made my pot roasts with dry onion soup mix, but usually I would cook it in in a Dutch Oven, covered. By cooking it in the slow cooker, the meat was so incredibly tender it literally melted in my mouth.  Delicious!! And from now on I will be making my chuck roasts in the crock pot! Yum!

I have virtually no experience cooking whatsoever and prepared this as my first ever dish with our new slow cooker.  However, I still experimented by reading the numerous reviews and took the aggregate of suggestions to combine.  I used the beef broth instead and varied the amount of vegetables to suit taste.  I cooked mine on low for 10 hours and it was excellent.  I also gained the reassurance from two independent, impartial taste testers as well.  Go with confidence on this one.

I am rating this based on following the basics of the recipe and using my own ingredients that my dad always used when he made pot roast in his dutch oven.  I did not brown the roast, but I rubbed it with salt, pepper and garlic powder the night before and the next morning put it in the slow cooker on low with a chopped onion, crushed garlic cloves and bay leaves, topped with a mixture of one can of beef broth, a glass of red wine and a small can of tomato paste.  Came home at lunch and added red potatoes, baby carrots and celery.  After I got home from work I turned it on high for about an hour to make the vegetables nice and soft.  All in all it probably cooked about 11 hours.  I was able to make a nice gravy with the liquid by adding a bit of cornstarch and flour and heating up in the microwave.  With the modifications I made this came out just like dad's recipe.  Thanks.

I found this recipe to be pretty good. Although any markets around me do not carry a 4 lb. roast, I did find the largest one-2.2lbs, and continued with the full recipe. Since I used a smaller roast, I will use only half the onion soup mixture next time, also I added a chopped green bell pepper. Thanks it was delicious!

I thought the meat just didn't have that great of a taste. I thought there should have been more flavor. The broth was flavorful and the meat fell apart which is why I gave it a three.

I really love this recipe. Only thing I did differently was used beef broth instead of water and generously rubbed garlic powder with the salt and pepper on the meat when I initially browned it.

This was the best pot roast I have ever cooked, as my husband said.  I did not put celery in it and I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and some worcestershire.  I cooked it on high for 6 hours, it was sooooooo good!

OK - it's not even quite done yet as the veggies aren't quite squishy enough (I think I had the crock pot on too high) but I taste tested and wow!  I cut the recipe in half and added more veggies than called for as well as organic beef broth to cook in (I added more than called for)  Also used a ton of lee and perrins (steak sauce), a  bay leaf,  a whole vidalia onion and two cloves garlic as well as removing the xtra fat in the beginning and putting fork holes in it and doing the montreal seasoning rub as others had suggested - I'm not even going to share this time - this stuff is Awesome! :)

I really like this recipe because of its simplicity.  The roast turned out very tender, even better the next day. However, I didn't use a slow cooker.  I cooked it on the stove under low heat for approximately 3 hours.

Great recipe.  I made it with bison, and I cooked this in my big cast iron dutch oven.  First I cooked the onions, and added garlic.  Then, taking the advice of other reviewers, I browned the bison after rubbing it with Montreal Steak Seasoning.  Put the onions and garlic back in, added some halved red potatoes, a packet of onion soup mix, and 2 cans of beef consumme, and stuck it in the oven at 200 for 5 hours.  Added some baby carrots, and in for another 2 hours.  We made gravy with the broth and flour, and everything came out great.  Pulled the bone out of the bison roast with one tug!  I will definately be making this again.

This is so easy and delicious that it's ridiculous.  I don't change anything about this recipe except that I don't add potatoes.  I make mashed potatoes on the side.  This recipe literally takes under 10 minutes to make in the morning before you leave for work.

Try adding some mushrooms with the dry onion soup mix, which you mix with the beef broth and 1 cup red wine...also garlic and sliced onions with the soup mix...and good fresh ground black pepper.

Good. Not quite as awesome as I thought it would be considering the reviews. The only thing I did differently was to use beef stock rather that water.

Great taste and so easy to make. There's nothing like coming home to the smell of a tasty pot roast in the slow cooker. My only change was to use chicken broth/stock instead of water. After browning the meat, I added the liquid to the pan, and scraped up all the brown,  flavorful bits and then added it to the slow cooker with everything else. Immediatly before serving, I took allthe liquid from the slow cooker, added some water and a little flour to make a balanced gravy. Super tasty. Enjoy

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! I have a big family to feed (10 people) so I used 2 3.5lb. roasts and adjusted the cooking time by cooking on high for the last 5 hours.  I used beef broth instead of water and omitted adding the vegetables.  The roasts was fall apart perfect and the taste was to die for! I have been cooking pot roasts for years and this was by far the best roast I have ever made.  Super easy and melt in your mouth perfect! Will make again and again!  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!

The ultimate comfort food! I subbed water with 1.5 cups beef broth & omitted the celery. Slow cooked it on low for 8 hours, adding the onion and carrots after 3 hours. Didn't put the potatoes in the crock thinking they would soak up too much salt...instead, served it over a bed of fresh garlic mashed. Hubby and kids said it was absolutely perfect and there were no leftovers! Can't wait to make it again...

The first time I made this I didn't add enough liquid, so this time I used 2 cans of beef broth as per another users suggestion. I like to reserve the juices as an au jous type dip, and even my picky little 5 year old ate it. Will definetly keep in the recipe box.

Loved this recipe! I'm usually not big on pot roast, but this was so easy and a lot like my mom's. Delicious. My family loved it. I made some for my neighbor also, and she is now making it for her family as well.

I also added a couple of sprigs of fresh Thyme and a splash of red wine. I omit the water as it's unnecessary since the roast creates it's own juices which is a lot tastier.

I have never used onion soup mix as seasoning for anything....I prefer to season things myself so I can control what's in my food.  I decided to try this recipe to see if seasoning short cuts really work.  They DON'T.  This was so bad that my husband wouldn't eat more than the first few bites (and he eats pretty much anything).  If you are looking for a yummy and easy pot roast recipe, keep looking.

This is a winner.  Super tender beef and flavorful veggies make this a keeper and so easy to prepare.  I seared my roast in bacon grease for added flavor and this cooked up so yummy and moist and tender.

This is very similar to my mother's recipe except she uses a can of french onion soup. I think I like the soup mix better. I cut the celery out, and only used half an onion. Red potatoes work great for this as well as baby carrots. The only thing I would add is that my crock pot instructions say to put the vegtables in first and the meat on top.

Excellent. My Roast was only 2 lbs. I added 1 dry envelope of onion soup, no water, chopped up 3 carrots...put on low 9 hrs. It made a great aujus kind of gravy, I did not thicken it and the gravy was delicious. My hubby who does not like red meat said it was the best pot roast he ever tased, he even had seconds.

Holy Cow! This was fantastic! I did not put any veggies in with the meat. Instead I made mashed potatoes and PW's fried zucchini cakes. Wow! One of the best dinners I've ever made. I took the advice of another reviewer and added flour to the liquid while in the crock pot to make a gravy. Boyfriend could not stop raving how great the meat was. Delicious!

I used a can of cream of mushroom soup in place of part of the water in this recipe.  Really liked it and will make it again.

My hard to please family loved this roast!  And it was SO easy.  The only thing I would do differently is add more water or beef broth so that there is more juice for dipping bread!  And I might try adding more herbs next time, too.  Simply delicious!  Thanks!

I used a smaller roast and omitted the celery.  I seasoned the roast with meat tenderizer, onion and garlic salts, and pepper.  As suggested I added carrots (baby) and potatoes (red) the last few hours.  Everything was tender.  Will make a gravy to go along with the roast next time, I missed not having it.

definitely 5 star,.. definitely making again!! Only thing I did different was I added one can of beef broth and 1/2 cup of water for the liquid. Still used the onion soup mix only reduced it to half a pkg. Also used spices as other mentioned, montreal steak spice, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, paprika. All added to taste.I used avg size roast and cooked on low for 4.5 hours then on high for 2.5 hours. Could fall apart with fork placed in it! Umm umm good!

I always wanted to make a pot roast, but was too afraid I wouldn't season it correctly.  After reading several reviews, I had to give it a shot..This was the BEST pot roast I have ever had!  Thank you Marie..I'm looking forward to trying more of your recipes.

this was the best chuck roast recipe ever! The meat was so tender and juicy.  I used a six pound roast, and I was hoping to have leftovers, but my family loved it so much there was nothing left! I followed the recipe and also added 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce.  10 hours in the crockpot was perfect.  Thanks!

This recipe is delicious.  The difference is in the browning and seasoning of the roast before being put in slow cooker. Be sure to cook it on low.  Everytime I make this, there is never enough.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This recipe was the best! My children absolutely loved it, and for all four of them to agree is a miracle! I did add some garlic, beef broth, and worcesture sauce like others recommended. IT turned out very tasty and hardly any leftover..

This was fantastic!  Family loved it.  Will be part of the rotation for sure!
Used an envelope of dry beefy onion soup mix and a bag of frozen stew veggies Added an extra potato and baby carrots because that's what the kids eat.

I have made this roast twice, the first time I followed the directions exactly and it turned out good but very bland. This time I added the montreal steak seasoning when browning, used the beef stock instead of water, and a couple cloves of garlic. WAY better, so much flavor. Great basic recipe that I have had fun perfecting!

I also modified this using a paprika, garlic salt, pepper, 2 bay leaves and oregano. I added more then the recommended worchestire sauce also. It only took 7 hours and the meat was just falling apart because it was so moist. Adding beef broth instead of water also helps to keep the flavor. Although I rubbed the meat before browning it, adding spices in the last hour also keeps the roast from becoming bland. PERFECT.

Oh wow!  Loved it!  we couldn't stop picking at the veggies and the beef.  We each ate a bunch before we even sat down for the meal!!  I didn't have any celery on hand, so I skipped that step...otherwise, it was wonderful!!  No more dry roasts for me!!

Very good!  The only changes I made were to use rump roast, which I sprinkled with garlic sea salt and black pepper before searing (do NOT skip the browning step if you can help it, it adds tremendous flavor to the finished product) and I left out the potatoes, instead serving it with mashed. I was a little worried about the onion soup mix, since I never use it, but it was really not noticeable. I did add an extra onion, and probably more celery than called for. Great meal for a cold night!

I followed this recipe rather loosely.  I marinated a 3 1/2 lb. chuck roast overnight and used Emeril's steak rub, browned in olive oil and slow cooked for 9 hours.  Added onions, potatoes, carrots and garlic.  Fell apart and was delicious.  You can tailor this recipe to suit whatever tastes you have.  Great basic recipe

This was delicious!  I took others advice and used a steak rub on the meat before browning.  I didn't have onion soup mix so I used 1 tsp onion powder and 4tsp beef bouillon instead.  It was so flavorful, will definitely make it again.

This is the best recipe to follow for a bachelor.  I learned form dear old mom to sear the meat, add the broth and the vegetables, then BOIL on stove for two hours, THEN cover with a can of mushroom GRAVY (I add an extra can of Beef Gravy), and cook in Dutch oven in oven for two hours.  Cooking time cut in half and with all that juice moist meat which falls off the fork, with plenty of decicious broth/gavy.  Mmmmm...thanks Marie

Very impressive recipe! Made this last night for New Year Eve. My guests really enjoyed it very much! I prepared it with Montreal Seasoning rub, used 3/4 of the bottle, garlic salt and pepper, and crushed  3 garlic cloves. I marinated for 1 day and then dumped the meat into the slow cooker with all the other veggies and soup base, after searing it.
I've never used my slow cooker before and was not sure how long it would take. 
It stated 8 - 10hours(for 4 lbs chuck and I had 4lbs), I put it for 8.5+ hrs and it was a little over cooked, but still moist. Next time, I would set it for 7 hours and check the meat before going any further! *Definitely a keeper*

Wow.  I am not a roast fan but this turned out wonderful.  Even my kids ate it.  The gravy was fantastic too.  I did not use any veggies since I don't like the taste of them when they are cooked along with the meat.  I also used about 1/2 cup of Marsala wine and beef bouillon cubes with the water.  Thanks.  I will definately make this again!

This recipe is delicious!  I used a 3 1/2# chuck roast, a can of coke, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and a package of dry onion soup mix.  I also tossed in baby carrots, red potatoes, sliced mushrooms, and an onion.  I left out the celery and it was still great!

Like other reviewers, I used the Montreal Steak Seasoning as a rub prior to browning.  I began cooking it with the celery and onions, then with 3 hours left, I added the potatoes and carrots.  It was very good- a keeper.

MMM... this pot roast is so tender and juicy it falls apart. The flavor is wonderful. I've used all the veggies or left one out if i didn't have it on hand, they taste great too. If you don't have 8-10 hours you can shorten that by cooking on high part of the time. It's best when cooked on low for the whole time though.

I followed some of the other's advise on this one and marinated it over night in red wine vinager then rubbed it before browning with Monteray steak spices. I also used Beef Broth and Worcheshire sauce instead of water. The sauce was amazing and the vegies came out awesome but because my crock pot is not working properly my meat was a little overcooked and dry. I think with a properly functioning crock pot this would be amazing. I also made the pumpkin rolls from this website, perfect combo! :-)

This was excellent!  I followed the recipe, but I also added some baby portabella mushrooms and some baby onions in the variety of colors. I did season the meat as recommended by other reviewers before browning, It came out perfect and so flavorful.   This is now one of my favorite recipes!

this is the most delicious pot roast I've ever had! I didn't add the celery because I didn't have fresh celery, and I didn't brown it because I didn't think it was necessary. I will make this again though. Thanks!

Good. Rembember, the lower the heat and longer the cook time, the better the roast!

You know you have a recipe to keep when my 13 year old son (who thinks eating supper is an annoyance because it takes away from more important things like video games) requests seconds and says: "this is really good".

Delicious! My husband and I love this dish, it is our favorite pot roast recipe! I highly recommend using a chuck roast for fall apart tender meat. Instead of water I used a normal size can of low sodium beef broth and did skip adding an onion. It was great the next day too as hot roast beef sandwiches. I thickened the juice up a bit with wondra flour for the sandwiches.

I will definitely use this recipe again.
De-glazed the pan with onions, broth and onion soup mix after browning. Add to crock pot. Started crock at 10:00 p.m. Saturday night ready to eat by noon on Sunday after church and family loved it.

We used a rump roast, and had great success.  When you cook it that long (8-10 hours), any meat will get nice and tender!  I would recommend putting the potatoes and carrots in 1/2 way through instead... ours turned very brown, and everything on our plate was the same color!  But, they all tasted so good!

My parents came to visit me from Pennsylvania and I had this in the slow cooker when they arrived.  My mom couldn't stop raving about this dish.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of water and a bunch more carrots and potatoes, it was awesome.

I cook a lot so I was suprised when my husband claimed it was the best thing I ever cooked.  I made the recipe for 4 people so I cut the meat portion in half but kept everything else the same.  Unless you want the meat to be 2/3 of your meal I would suggest doing this.

Very tasty.  It needed at least 2 cups of water in it.  I also added beef bouillion.  Will make again but with more water.**Tried it this time with a can of beef broth.  It was fantastic. I shredded some beef, put it on buns with Mild Giardinairre Mix, and everyone loved it. Now we can have the roast for dinner and it is a totally different meal. I will add Italian Seasoning to the shredded beef next time and simmer for a bit!

Good recipe, easy preparation.  I added sliced leeks as the first layer, at the bottom, which melted up nicely, and 2 tbls red wine, garlic, minced Italian parsley, more ground pepper and paprika to spice it up.  Next time I'll use less liquid.  Thanks for sharing, Marie!

I've cooked for 40+ yrs so when you hear what I did, must be my age(under 55).Used my new crock pot on this & made some adjustments.Added 2 more carrots,1 more potato, and 1/2 stalk of celery, but also rubbed the roast with Seasoned seasalt, and Badia's steak seasoning (instead of salt & pepper)before browning. I added 2 pkts of Badia Sazon Tropical flavor pkts & used 3/4 c. white zinfandel wine(instead of water), then decided to be creative & insert one clove of garlic(sliced) into slits in the roast & add 2 fresh bay leaves. 
I planned to cook it for 10 hours since I was going out, however after 4 hours of cooking on low, I realized I left the compressed cardboard packing between the outer & inner lining of the crockpot (I'd used this crockpot once before, just put it back so it was 'cushioned'. Since it was my first crockpot with a removeable liner,I'm not used to it yet.) I quickly lifted out the liner & knocked off the 'packing', &reinserted it into the outer pot.Figured the extra hr would do it good, since I'd just insulated the first 4 hrs worth of cooking time. When I got home I added more water to cover vegs, and realized it could have been done at 8-9 hrs, but didn't get a chance to try it until the next day. Very good!! A little salty, but that was MY fault. Next time, I'll leave out the flavor packets. Husband & I thought it was VERY GOOD, though. (Good thing I don't get spazzed-out about my cooking mistakes!)

The meat was tasty, but the potatoes were kind of bland.  I put the carrots on the bottom, so they had some flavor  I used beef broth instead of water and added fresh mushrooms and garlic instead of celery.  I cooked it on high for about 4 hours.  So it was ok, but I won't make it again.

This was my first attempt at pot roast and it turned out very good!  I used a smaller piece of meat than the original recipe called for, so it was a little "onion-y" but I added some beef bouillon to the mix and it tasted great!

I've made this three times now! This makes the whole house smell wonderful, and it is super easy to make! You don't need to add water, like some people have posted, the gravy this roast makes in it's own juice is very rich and the meat is still fall apart tender! If you don't have any celery, I skipped it once and added a dash of celery salt, which was delicious, too. 
I have two little, little ones running around, so I'm always on the look out for easy, but nutritious meals, and this fits the bill!  You can use the leftover meat for sandwiches (I used mini-potato rolls with a pasta salad the next day and it was great!), and the vegetables are so yummy and tender, I even got my finicky two year old to eat the carrots! This is now a family fave!

You just can't go wrong w/ this recipe. I added one can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 a cup of water instead of 1 cup.  I also used 5-6 small red potatoes halved. I used 5 carrots and 2 stalks of celery. I did not have a problem with the veggies becoming too soft, however, if you fear the veggies becoming too soft I recommend putting them in a couple of hours after roast. A little garlic or garlic salt doesn't hurt either. I served this w/ white rice.
 You can cook this recipe as is or make it your own. Either way it is fabulous!

Very good!!! I cooked my roast for 6 hrs instead of 8-10 and still was very tender. I made juices into gravy using whole wheat flour. Was excellent! I also omitted the potatoes and carrots and it was still tasty. My family really enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my parent’s anniversary dinner.  They absolutely loved it. This was my first roast ever attempted. I took the advice of another review and added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a beef bouillon to the water. The gravy was delicious. Highly recommend this one.

I've tried 5 other recipes - trying to get to one my whole family would agree on.  This was it.  The carrots even cooked up amazing.  My son kept asking for more and that says alot!

This was very good - I had guests on New Year's Eve and needed a recipe that did not have any cream soup (due to one guest's dairy allergies).  I didn't want an Italian type pot roast - this was just good old fashioned goodness.  My guests loved it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used beef broth instead of water and mushrooms instead of celery.  This was my first attempt at making pot roast - I will make again.

The best slow cooker pot roast recipe I've had the pleasure to make and enjoy. I usually use a 3-pound roast, and I've used different cuts without problems. I usually use beef broth, and I mix the soup with the broth before adding to the slow cooker. I've added rosemary and thyme, plus a bay leaf here and there, with exellent results. Sometimes I have to add a little cornstarch and sometimes I don't. I check it maybe ½ hour before serving and see if it needs thickening. Thanks, Marie, for making life easier! :)

For my first attempt at a pot roast, this sure was easy. It only takes 15-20 minutes to prepare. I'd suggest adding slightly more vegetables and additional seasonings. Other than that, it was what I expected.

My family enjoyed this so much. It was very tasty.  I used 2 lbs chuck roast but doubled the vegetables.  I used beef broth instead of water as some reviewers suggested.   It made enough gravy and I thickened it with cornstarch.  I will make this again.

Love this because it cooks itself! I season the meat with garlic salt before browning. I also use more potatoes and carrots and also add a dry package of au jus along with the onion mix.

I made this pot roast exactly as the recipe directs, and it was wonderful. The meat was fall-apart tender, and the juice was neither salty nor bland. Only two regrets: I had to endure the delicious aroma all day without eating it, and I gave most of the food away to another family. :) I will definitely make this again the same way for _our_ family -- except will maybe add more carrots.

yummy pot roast!! left out the celery and added slived mushrooms. i used beef broth as was recommended by several others and i added a little red pepper and garlic powder halfway through. the pepper gave it a nice kick (i also added a splash of Dale's).i also added a little flour for the last hour of cooking to thicken the gravy. my husband will be enjoying the leftovers for lunch! thanks for the great recipe!

Just great! On the advice of another reviewer, I cooked it overnight and glad I did.  In the morning I only had to transfer the roast to a covered plate and separated the gravy.  We ate it that night and all the flavors had a chance to magnify.  I omitted the celery (and of course added whole garlic cloves)and kept in the potatoes, they turned out just fine.

Thanks Marie.

I thought this recipe was the best I have ever cooked before. My kids liked it and they are very picky eaters. I added a half a cup of beef bouillion and 1 can of mushroom soup to it also. the roast was very tender. I will make this recipe again thanks.

I'm sorry to say this was disappointing.  I followed the recipe except that I used beef broth instead of water.  The gravy it made was thin and flavorless and the pot roast itself lacked oomph.  Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.

Very, very good. I used beef broth instead of water, and put in more vegetables than what the recipe called for. I cooked a 2.75lb chuck roast for about 9 hours, and it was falling apart when I took it out of the slow cooker. Very filling, and comforting. Great recipe!

Awesome!  I cut the meat size in half.  Sprinkle all sides of the meat with salt and pepper beforehand.  I added more carrots than called for, and chopped the onions very fine.  Be sure and add the celery because that's what makes the sauce thick.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I made it with Lipton's "Beefy Onion" soup mix. It took the full 10 hours and the meat still wasn't quite as tender as I like it, but I guess that varies by slow cookers.

Great recipe! I used some of the tweaks that other reviewers mentioned and it made this pot roast better than any others I’ve made. I rubbed a liberal amount of Montreal Steak Seasoning into meat then seared it on hot skillet with olive oil & fresh minced garlic. My husband loves the root veggies in pot roast so we added extra carrots and celery. We also used 4 medium-sized diced Russet Potatoes. We didn’t have onion so I used dried minced onion. We put meat on bottom and veggies on top along with a cup of beef broth, one tsp fresh minced garlic, a packet of dried onion soup and the garlic/olive oil remnants from the searing pan. Cooked on low for 6:30 hours. Then switched the meat to top and veggies on bottom for another :30 minutes on low setting. The result was sooooooo good my mouth STILL waters just thinking about it! Meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor was to die for. Even my picky kids gave it a 10/10! Will definitely be adding this to our regular winter rotation.

DO NOT skip the browning step.  Being basically lazy, I skipped it the second time I made the recipe and the difference was dramatic.  Also, I cut onions, jalopeno peppers and bell peppers in medium chunks and stuffed them into deep slits made with a carving knife.  This will add a depth of flavor that means the difference between ordinary and gourmet quality.

I lovedo this because it wasn't complicated, and didn't have too many ingredients, and it turned out great. I seasoned the meat with herbs de Provence, salt, pepper, and a dash of worstishire sauce. I cooked it about 5 hours on high because of limited time , and  the meat was about 2.5 pounds  (less than the recipe called for). Tasted.great and we.loved the vegetables. Next time we will add more veggies. I used smaller red potatoes instead of the white potatoes.

I used 2 lb chuck roast and skipped the celery.  Added some extra carrots and potatoes.  Otherwise made as described and it was delicious.  Need a bigger roast next time, my family of 4 ate it all up!

I love how easy this recipe is. You can add whatever spices you like to make it your own. I like to add about 6 cloves of garlic -- not chopped -- that I sear with the meat.

This gets a 5 for ease of prep and 4.5 for flavor.  I added a lot more veggies -- 5 stalks of celery and a half a bag of baby carrots in addition to potatoes (no onion).  I added some extra seasonings before browning the beef and the cooked 8oz of mushrooms in the leftover fond with some thyme before adding them to to crockpot.  I was short on time, so I cooked on High for 6 hours.  Very good flavor. Wished I had cooked a bigger piece of beef to have more leftovers!

So many of you altered the recipe and so many of us wanted to know how it was when cooked as directed... I follow the directions and the results are as follows:
==> (1) Meat 3.6+ lbs for 9hrs: tender and very good. Just the right amount of flavor (&salt from soup mix) - Rating=5 
==> (2) Carrots & Potatoes: I cut these in big chunks since the directions did not exactly state but they were still bland and soft and I am sure if I made them smaller, they would have been worse - Rating=1
==> (3) Overall Rating=4 since the meat was most important. If there was a 3.5 choice I probably would have done that.
==> (4) Thoughts: As a simple fix, I would try to add carrots at some point later on (maybe with a few hours left?). This would work if the loss of flavor was due to the overcooking which I suspect. I would also then cut them a little smaller and hopefully there would be room in the juice since the meat would have shrunk at that point (I think). Issue here is then this is not a "set it and forget it". 
Hope this helps folks out!

Great pot roast. I mostly followed recipe. Browned beef in olive oil after rubbing with Monterey steak seasoning. Instead of water, used 1 can beef broth, 1 can chicken broth. Used small red potatoes. Added all veggies (carrots, onion, potatoes) when there was 3 hours left of cooking time on low. Total cook time on low 10 hours. I strained almost all liquid and attempted to make gravy with flour and corn start h. It thickened a bit but still pretty thin. Not sure why it wouldn't thicken. Great way to cook pot roast.

A former co-worker gave me this recipe about 5 years ago.  I have used this recipe exclusively (with the exception of one time which I regret).  The basic recipe has always been the best. I'll "prep" the entire dish at night, put it in the removable crockpot portion of my slow cooker, refrigerate overnight and turn it on the lowest time/temp when I leave for work in the morning.  I'll experiment with seasonings, cuts of meat and/or veggies. Today I am adding fresh, sliced mushrooms in a few hours.  You can't go wrong - but the original recipe has always been my favorite.  Crusty garlic bread and a bottle of red wine make it an all-time fave!

I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions. I forgot to buy the celery & I added Montreal steak seasoning.
The roast came out so tender & delicious. When I  cut the string after it was finished cooking,  the meat just fell apart. No need to use a knife. We used a serving spoon to pull the meat apart. Everyone loved it and I don't believe there will be leftovers for long!!

My family and I loved this meal; I did make some minor changes to it per the advice given in the comments, and by my own design. I bought a 3.8lb chuck roast and marinated it overnight in Bertolli Chianti red wine vinegar, and I substituted the onions with green bell peppers since onions do not sit well with my grandmother. When I seared both sides I lightly applied both ground pepper and sea salt. The meal was met with resounding success; I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe As Is, is awesome! So easy and I make it all the time. Sometimes I don't even sear the meat before tosding it in the crockpot, and it still tastes great. Only variations I do is sometimes I throw in whole baby mushrooms or omit the celery just based on what I have on hand. I also sometimes toss in some beef broth instead of water. But you can't go wrong with the basic recipe, it is very forgiving.

This is my go to basic pot roast and it's delicious. I make it mostly the same, depending on my mood and what's on hand. I haven't made a roast in months, so finally decided it was time. I follow this recipe except I don't use a whole packet of onion soup, more like a quarter. Too overpowering otherwise. I also add chopped garlic, cayenne pepper, and a bit of butter when browning the sides, and I add a bullion cube to the pan with the water after browning the meat, then add it to the crock pot, to get all that yumminess back in the crock pot. I like my veggies mushy, but the hubby prefers his firmer, so I add half at the start and the other half half way through. I like to add a sweet potato sometimes which is delicious.

The roast was very tender.  I used a rump roast and left the carrots and potatoes whole.   I put the whole carrots in the crockpot, then the browned roast and topped it of with whole potatoes and onions.   perfect!  My husband was at home and he said the aroma was making him very hungry!

Ha! my name is Marie and this is the way I do roasts. only thing I have started doing different is I use V8 juice instead of water. I think it gives extra flavor and tenderizes. I usually cook a smaller roast as I am cooking for 2, therefore it doesn't take that long to cook.

I've used this recipe as my starting point multiple times! The first time I made it, I didn't have any onion soup mix. I had Pioneer Brand brown gravy mix, though. So I let it cook for eight hours, popped in my can of sliced carrots and mixed in two packages of the brown gravy mix instead for the last hour of cooking.

It was amazing! It's my Fiancé's favorite dish. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

This was so good moist and east to make   Easy prep followed the directions set it and forget it.  I was almost scared it would come out too salty since the video added lots of salt and dry onion soup mix but it came out great.

This is the 2nd time I am making this.  The first time I used a rump roast because that's what I pulled out of my freezer.  It was very good, but I'm anxious to see how the chuck roast tastes.  I followed the basic recipe but added some of the suggested seasonings.  This time I added fresh mushrooms instead of potatoes and will be serving over garlic mashed.  This is an excellent and easy recipe.  Thank you Marie!

Used 2 cups of water instead of 1. Added minced garlic, a couple more potatoes, and a whole bunch of baby carrots. Also added some garlic seasoning. Came out perfect.

This is perfect.  The only small change I made was instead of a packet of plain onion soup, I used Lipton's beefy onion.  Super perfect and super easy.

This was the best roast I've ever made!! It was super moist and juicy. I used a mostly frozen chuck roast that'd been in the freezer for 1 year and 7 months (I'd even almost thrown it out because of the discoloration). I thawed it in the fridge over night, then put it in the slow cooker for about 5 hours on high, then low for an additional 3. It was succulent. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

This pot roast was delicious.  We made it according to the recipe, and would only change 2 things: it needs more liquid - beef broth? - and it needs salt.  Other than that, perfect!  Thanks for posting!

We loved this! It was so tender and juicy. My BF actually put this on while I was at work, and when I came home, it had the house smelling delicious! The only thing we would change is adding more potatoes and veggies....it just didn't seem to be enough because though there was a lot of meat left, there wasn't any potatoes or carrots. Otherwise, awesome recipe!

Great recipe!  This was easy and delicious!  It is necessary to add more spices to the rub before you sear.  I used white pepper, salt, garlic powder and Italian seasoning and it turned out great.

I'm a nanny, and I made this for "my" six kids. They all liked it a lot. My crock pot runs hot, so the cooking was done after about four hours on "low". I'd make this again. I didn't change the recipe at all, nor would I the next time I make it. It's a good, solid pot roast. Thank you, Marie.

Delicious and easy. I usually make my roasts in the oven, but this was good, too.  I added bay leaf, seasoned the roast before browning, and thickened the juice before serving.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I do this recipe often for pot roast, but I make a couple changes. I omit the potatoes (I prefer mashed) and add beef stock (to mostly cover the roast) and submerge a stalk of thyme and a stalk of rosemary in the broth. It's delicious!

Very easy and very tasty! The entire family loved it, even my husband who doesn't like roast's. I added a few more potatos that I just quartered and used baby carrots. I placed them in the bottom of the cooker with the roast on top then I added the onions,celery, water and onion mix on top. My slow cooker tends to cook fast so I cooked my 2lb roast on low for 6 hours and everything came out perfect! Can't wait to make this again, thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

This recipe was awesome! I prepared the roast as directed but I omitted the potatoes. While I love the vegetables mushy and full of flavor, my family doesn't. When the roast was finished, I strained the vegetables (carrot, celery, onion and garlic per some other reviews) and used the juice to make the best gravy I've ever tasted. I served the roast with steamed carrots and sky-high Yorkshire pudding from all recipes - we didn't miss the potatoes. My mother never made roast beast that tasted like this; I will make this again. Thanks, Marie!

This turned out so good my son ate potatoes for the first time EVER (other than french fries)!  Unfortunately I cannot get my re-heats of the left-overs anywhere near as tasty as the fresh out of the crockpot flavor.  I will absolutely make this again, worked out perfectly ready to eat after a long work day.

Excellent, the only thing that I would add is a pack of gravy.

I didn't have dry onion soup mix, so I used onion powder, garlic salt, thyme, oregano, & montreal seasoning. I also added some fresh button mushrooms because I had extra from a previous night dinner. I also added about 1 tsp of beef bouillon. My father (a very picky cook himself who only really eats his own cooking) enjoyed this meal!!

I made this for a group of 9 people a few nights ago and there wasn't one drop left. I rarely cook, so for something to turn out well for me... wow. I made a few changes according to taste and some of the other reviews. I left out the celery, used 6 red potatoes, omitted the celery and water. I added one can of cream of mushroom and a half can of cream of mushroom as well as one beer. It was AMAZING.  Served over rice. YUM! Thank you!

I actually got applause from my family for cooking something they liked after they ate it - which NEVER happens! This was after my son broke out in tear's when he found out we were having potatoes that weren't mashed and he loved it! :)

Recipe turned out great! Super easy. I made some minor adjustments. Used sweet potatoes which I did not peel. Skipped the celery and the salt.

This recipe was easy and tasty. I am only giving 4 stars because I only cooked 6-7 hours and it came out perfect. We used homemade chicken/beef/vegetable stock instead of water and took another user's advice to rub the pork with montreal steak spice and freshly crushed garlic. Also we doubled the vegetables.

Easy to make. I purchased a 3.83 pound roast and it came out dry. I cooked it 8.5 hours on low. I will make another one again but will make gravy using the other reviewers advice. The potato's and carrots were super tasty and soft. I also used beef broth instead of water. First time to make a pot roast and my family loved it.

Tasted wonderful!  I doubled the vegies and added more water, cooked it for 8 hours and it was very tender.  I took the juices and made gravy with it.  I would have added beef bouillon if I had it but didnt and the gravy was still very good.

We made this with a Bison roast and I used 4 cups of beef broth instead of water.  Another change I made was adding balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp per cup of broth which gave everything a wonderful flavor.

This was delicious. It smelled really salty from the onion soup packet that it called for but when it was done cooking it wasn't overly salty at all and the next day it tasted even better. I will definitely be making this again.

I used this recipe today and the roast came out great. I substituted: all natural beef broth (for water), celery salt (for celery), onion powder (for onion soup). I cooked the roast for 5 hours by itself, then threw in the carrots. I used the potatoes to make mashed potatoes on the side, and steamed some asparagus to go with it. The recipe is pretty good but be careful with the salt content if you're substituting like I did. Since I used celery salt and beef broth, I LIGHTLY seasoned with salt before browning (instead of seasoning to taste). I would definitely try other recipes from Marie Thomas.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  We are not huge meat eaters so I substituted just one pound of stew beef for the chuck roast and added some more veggies.  The onion soup mix added a very nice flavor.

mmmm very tasty.  took the advice of a couple reviewers and added some spices of my own besides just salt and pepper.. mostly just garlic. left out the celery pieces but sprinkled some celery salt on top.  put the veggies in about halfway through cooking time  and they were nearly mush by the time the roast was ready.  didnt bother me any though.  roast had a great flavor to it, was tender and juicy.  glad to finally have a pot roast recipe that doesnt use mushroom soup.

This has a simple list of ingredients and works well relying just on a packet of onion soup mix for flavor.  I needed to add more water and also added 2 T. Worcestershire sauce at that time.

This is a wonderful pot roast have made it for years.  Also try Knorr's vegtable soup mix.  Always have leftover beef and make extra gravy.  Great for hot beef sandwiches smothered with gravy the next day, just slice beef cover with gravy put in a casserole dish and reheat in oven 30-45 mins.  Delish!

Roast comes out extremely moist and fell apart.  While the flavor was nice and I'll make it again, I didn't think it was anything extraordinary.

this one's a keeper- I find so many slow cooker recipes a letdown, but my brother in law commented that it was restaurant quality, and asked for the recipe.  I omitted celery bc I didn't have it on hand, but I loved that the sides are included.  it will be on my regular rotation.

This was so good! My husband loved it!!! I felt that I used to much pepper when I did the rub prior to the browning but according to my husband he thought it was fantastic. I used the Lipton Onion Soup mix, it made th gravy fantastic! :)

This is how my family usually makes their pot roast! It was delish!! I made half the recipe...I added bay leaf pieces, rosemary,thyme, creole seasoning, and Worcestershire sauce...I rubbed the onion soup mix on the meat before searing it,then added the rest to the slow cooker.. My hubby and 2 yr old love this!

My husband said it was the best pot roast he'd ever had. I didn't even make it with all of the veggies so I can only imagine how wonderful it is with them. (My husband is an excellent cook so I take his opinion seriously!) I loved it too!

A delicious recipe! I ended up skipping the onion soup mix and adding 1/2 c. red wine and 3 beef bouillon cubes. Also added only 1/2 of water instead of a whole cup. My husband liked it so much that he ate it for breakfast!

This is really good. I used a 3 pound roast and didn't change anything else. Add the vegetables half way through or they will be too soft. Also I put two and half cups of water in instead of just the one. That way I could make a gravy to go with it when it was finshed. This didn't make as much as I thought it would so next time I'm going to add more vegetables than what it calls for.

My husband has been asking me to make a pot roast for the last 14 years of our marriage.  I just discovered the slow cooker (late learner). It was fun watching him devour the roast and veggies.  He said it was better than his mother's pot roast.  Like others before, I used beef broth instead of water and Montreal steak seasoning.  The juices were absolutely delicious soaked up in some bread, along with the rest of it. My husband insists that I should make it again.

I honestly don't feel like I can rate this fairly. It seems most people were successful with this recipe. What did I do wrong! When making roast I don't normally use a'pot' roast. So I wasn't sure what this was - I asked for help at the grocery store. I will never buy another 'pot' roast! I seasoned the roast in salt and pepper, seared it in evoo and fresh garlic. In the slow cooker I placed it on quartered onions, baby carrots and celery. I added beef broth. I cooked for about 8 hours. The roast was tough. I have had better roast cooked in my oven! I rated this 4 stars because I don't think it was the recipe, but something I did wrong that made it turn out so bad! What did I do wrong?!!

Delicious. I omitted the celery, b/c I did not have it. I would use low sodium onion soup mix next time (if they make it).

Have to admit I was skeptical, afterall this was my first time using a slow cooker. Before using itI read the reviews, and took the advise of not adding the vegetables until half the time was up. It turned out perfectly and could give restaurants a run for their money. It was delicious!!

It was a ok. I couldn't find chuck roast and ended up buying the rump roast. My sister seems to think that was the reason why my meat was so dry. I followed all the suggestions and it was still missing something.

I was looking for a Pot Roast recipe as close to my Mom's as I could and this one is basically identical to what I wanted. I modified it a bit and put some beef base, worcestershire sauce and about a 1/4 cup of red wine in the 1 cup of water that gets poured in. I also added garlic and some garlic and onion powder for more flavor. Those probably weren't neccesary but it was more to taste and to have a heart gravy. After the cooking time I made gravy out of the juices on the stovetop adding a bit of red wine again and then corn starch to thicken over heat and was excellent as well! Such an easy, tasty and economical meal for the family!! I highly recommend this one!

I used the Montreal Steak Seasoning as a rub on the beef before browning.  In the crock pot I used 2 cans of beef broth and 1 cup of water.  I cooked the beef for about 4 hours on low before putting in the potatoes and carrots.  This meal was so hearty and delicious.  The beef didn't need to be cut, it fell apart.  The crock pot made a savory gravy which was full of flavor.  This was a great meal!!!

I was only cooking for 2 so I used a 1.5 lb pot roast that looked nice and marbled with a packet of pre-cut "soup" vegetables, 3 small potatoes, 1/2 a pack of onion soup mix.  Also took suggestions of adding a bay leaf, a clove of garlic and some paprika.  Cooked on low for 10 hours, turned out great!

As recommended, I substituted the water with a can of beef broth.  I also added 1 T worchestershire sauce, 1/2 t Montreal steak seasoning, and 3 cloves crushed garlic to the liquid.  I seasoned the meat with Montreal steak seasoning before browning.  Flavor and texture of the meat was great and perfectly cooked after 9 hours on low.  However, the potatoes and carrots were still completely hard.  I had to boil them for at least 20 minutes before we could eat them.  I would recommend either partially cooking the vegetables in the microwave before adding them, or setting up the meal and cooking it on low overnight and then for the recommended 8-10 hours.

My fiance and I really enjoyed this pot roast.  I did change the recipe a bit.  I increased the amount of carrots, onions, celery, and potatoes, and only used a 2-1/2 lb roast.  I also added garlic and mushrooms.  As others suggested, I used a can of beef broth instead of water, which gave the vegetables a bit more 'oomph!'  I was able to make a nice gravy with the juices at the end,  which paired nicely with the cornbread I served with it.  I would definitely make this again, but would pour or skim off some of the grease towards the end before making the gravy.

This was the first recipe I made in our crockpot.  It smelled sooo good!  I definitely added a bunch of worcestershire sauce.  I agree with others, chuck roast is way too fatty for either my husband or my taste.  I did add about 1/3 more vegetables-good flavor, too much fat!

My husband is the meat eater in the house.  He really enjoyed the pot roast and said it was tender and tasty.    Personally, I was very discouraged by the chuck roast as it had so much fat.  Obviously, I have little knowledge of the different cuts of beef.  I knew that chuck roast was fatty but I was very surprised and a bit disgusted at the amount of fat that rose to the top after being refrigerated.  I skimmed off the fat and cut off as much as possible.  I won't make this again due to the amount of fat, not the taste or recipe as that was all good.

I thought this was pretty good but seemed to missing something, not sure what... I added 4 cloves of crushed garlic and used whole baby carrots and two celery sticks, though I will add more celery in the future. I also added a bottle of dark beer and then 1/2 cup of chicken broth because it seemed like it needed more liquid. I seasoned the roast with low-sodium montreal steak seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and dried parsley and lightly dusted with flour before browning in olive oil. I will make again and try to figure out what I'm missing.

DELICIOUS!!! This was uber easy and came out super yummy!!! I put it in the slow cooker before I went to work, and when I came home it was done!! The only thing that I did was thicken the gravy with a flour butter mix on the stove, my husband and I love gravy! I definitely recommend this to someone who loves pot roast and is too busy to cook.

I browned the roast in olive oil after seasoning all sides with onion powder, garlic salt, lots of fresh ground black pepper and a little cayenne pepper. I did not have onion soup mix so I added a little more onion powder. I then put it in the slow cooker with beef stock. I added potatoes, carrots and celery about 3 hours before it was done. I made some gravy with the stock after it was finished and it was super. Very good canvas for individualized tastes to take over!

This was absolutely excellent. I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic. Added minced garlic to the soup. (We like our garlic) I didnt have any celery, but it still came out so tasty, fall apart and goooood! Even the carrots and potatoes were done but not mush. We poured a little of soup and meat juice mixture over it. Serve with crossiants or biscuits.

I've always been terrified to cook large cuts of meat for fear of them turning out dry, but seriously, I think this recipe is fairly fool proof.  And perfect for a mom on the run.  I put everything in the pot at 8 a.m. for a low 10 hour cook took, ran off to work and dinner was done when I got home that evening around 6. I seasoned and seared my roast before putting it in the pot and substituted beer for water, oh yeah and I omitted the potatoes because I prefer mash potatoes, but everything turned out awesome!

This was my first slow-cooker recipe...I've had my crock pot since last x-mas and never used it! I was a little nervous but I brown my 4 lb chuck roast and put it in with the onion, onion soup mix, water and some garlic and a little worcestershire sauce for good measure. I set it on low and cut up all my veges...I made my boyfriend PROMISE to put the veges in later in the day so they wouldn't get mushy and he did! I came home from work and the house smelled delicious, we are literally eating dinner right now and everything tastes great. I can't wait to try something else in my crock pot.

I'm giving this 4 stars for ease [and the timing/texture of everything was perfect], but found it too bland.  I didn't have celery but can't imagine that took away much - next time I'll try using beef broth or other liquid than H2O, more onion & experiment with seasonings before browning the roast.

This was sooooo good. I didn't have the onion soup mix so I improvised on the seasonings a little, but otherwise followed the recipe as is and it turned out great. I will be making this one on a fairly regular basis since my family loved it as much as I did.

Absolutely wonderful!  Only change I made was that I added garlic - lots of garlic - oregano, and rosemary.  Came out very, well I think.

Amazing. I used a round top roast because it was what I had. I didn't have any onion soup mix so I just added fresh sliced onions in with a little chopped garlic. I followed other reviews and seasoned the roast with steak seasoning and then seared the outside of it first in a pan with some olive oil. I put carrots and potatoes on the bottom and I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup. Really great, after 9 hours on low in the crock pot the meat just fell apart when I put a fork to it. So good!

This is an excellent recipe.  I added galic and replaced the water with a can of beef broth.  I had let it soak in the fridge overnight, so I let it cook in the crock pot for 11 hours.  I can never seem to find a 4 pount roast, so I always end up using a 3-3.5 pound roast instead.  Since I am just starting to get into cooking, I make this recipe every two weeks or so and it is more delicious every time I make it!

Very good. Added the veggies 4 hours into the 10 hour cook and they came out mushy. Next time I will try addidng them at the half way mark.  Other than that, a very tasy dish!

This is so easy and delicious. I cook for 2 so I used a 2.5 pound roast and increased the carrots and celery. I also added 1/2 cup red wine and some worcestershire sauce.

This was a really great roast!  I followed the reviewers advice of using 2 cans beef broth instead of water and I did rub down the roast with olive oil and lemon pepper.  Other than that I followed the rest.  It was SOOOOO good!

I love this recipe.  I browned my roast in a skillet with 2 teasponns of vegtable oil and added montreal sesoning on it.  I placed it in the crockpot with 1& 1/2 cups of water, one packet of onion soup mix, 3 diced potatoes, and a few dashes worchershire.  I cooked it on high for 1 hour( which I will opt out next time)  and then on low for 5-6 hours.  It was very scrumptious.  I followed the advice of another user and took 2/3 cups of the juice leftover with flour and made a very tasty gravey.  I will be using this one again!  Thank you:)

Mmmmm, good! I love recipes that you can just throw everything into a pot and when you get home from dinner it's done and delicious! This one the hubby raved about, nice even, mild flavor; not too salty. Will make again!

I don't know if I did something wrong but I found this to be very boring and bland.  Maybe with some red wine and herbs it would be okay, but as is I found it lacked any real excitement.

Wonderful recipe! I always seem to have trouble with my roasts; they are not as moist as I'd like them to be. After cooking this in the slow cooker for 8 hours the meat was falling off the bone. I took other reviewer's advice and used beef broth in place of water. I also seasoned with Montreal Steak Seasoning. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this exactly like the recipe and thought it was ok. Just didn't have enough flavor for me. It was nice coming home from work though and having dinner ready. Probably wouldn't make again or would change it like other reviewers.

This recipe had wonderful flavor and was so yummy! The only thing I did different was to add a beef bouillon cube to the water before adding it to the pot. Then I made gravy from all the juice.....very good! Will make again for sure!

Great recipe, I added 2 cans of low sodium beef broth instead of water and a couple of drops of hickory smoke flavoring to give it a smoky taste. Also doubled vegetables and added them halfway through cooking as others had suggested, deliscious!

This was the first time I've used onion soup mix with a potroast and we really enjoyed it.  I added a splash or two of Worcestershire.  Next time I'll follow the advice of others and not add any more salt.  Yummy.

My whole family loved this dish. The only thing I might do next time is marinate the meat or maybe inject flavor into the middle. I used a bottom round roast (my store was out of chuck) and it only needed 6 hours to cook to perfection.

I've been making a similar recipe for years and just love it.  Instead of water, I use cream of mushroom soup and sometimes substitute beef with mushroom dry soup mix for the onion soup mix.  Yummy!!  Thanks for sharing!

Good, however this turned out more like beef stew in my opinion.  I was hoping for a roast that was a little less stoupy.

This was an excellent recipe, but we made a few adjustments. We added a little more water and added the veggies about half way through the cooking process so that they would not be overcooked. Delicious!

I had 2.66 lb. roast which I browned first and then put on top of a sliced onion. In stead of water, I used a cup of beer along with the onion mix. It will be in the crock pot for 5 hours on low. The last 2 hours on high I added carrots, celery. The carrots were fine but the celery got very mushy. I made Greek potatoes recipe on this AR site and it was a great addition rather than potatoes that would taste like pot roast.

This was good.  The roast was ultra tender, and I found that if you put the potatoes on top of the meat it keeps them from getting very mushy.  I added a lot of seasoning to the meat and browned it, but in retrospect, I would have marinated it like another user suggested.  I didn't feel the meat had that much flavor.  I used beef stock in lieu of water which helped.  I would also recommend adding about another cup of liquid and trimming off large pieces of fat prior to cooking to avoid greasiness.  I will definitely make again, but I will marinate the meat overnight next time.  Also, making the gravy from the liquid and the drippings adds a lot of flavor.

This is the exact recipe that appears on the onion soup mix box.  i thought it was "eh" but hubby and kids loved it.  I however am not partial to stringy, shredded meat, so hence my bias.

Needs more veggies! I'd do twice the potatoes and onion if you have the room! Otherwise that's about all I can say- I used baby carrots and didn't have onion mix nor beef stock so I improvised with a beef stock vegetable soup I had. Also tried marinating it in red wine over nite. The meat truly fell off the bone. Next time we'll throw in some garlic and I think I'll skip the red wine.

Yum! This was  hit with the whole family. I omitted the potatoes since we were out, ditto with the celery. Added a little more dehydrated onion. The flavor in the meat was wonderful. I took the "drippings" and made a little gravy and the result was wonderful. Very easy, very tasty and leftovers for lunch! Yay!

MMM....DELICIOUS!  This was fantastic.  The meat of course was just falling apart.  The change I made was instead of using water & a dry onion soup mix, I used a condensed can of french onion soup--it worked perfectly.  Also, I rubbed it with kosher salt (like someone had suggested) the night before and the flavor it gave was just phenomenal.  My husband is asking for it every week!

My husband and I thought this was very good. We used some of the other reviewers advice and used worcestershire sauce, garlic and one bay leaf in the water.  I used five potatoes and about a third to a fourth of a small bag of baby carrots. We used baby carrots because that is what our daughter is more likely to eat.  It turned out fantastically.

i recently bought my first slow cooker. this is the first time i made a pot roast and the only change i made to this recipe is to make my own dry onion soup mix as supposed to store bought, its just a preference since i try to avoid too much salt on my food. i really like this recipe! quick and easy, plain and simple and it taste great!its definitely a keeper.

I've made this recipe twice and love it.  The first time I made it exactly as written; the second time I substituted canned beef broth (low salt) for the water and I cut the dried onion soup mix by half -- much better. You don't need an expensive cut of beef.  This is now a regular at my home.

I loved this recipe and so did my family. However, my potatoes and carrots were not done enough after the 10 hours so I am going to make this in a dutch oven ontop of the stove next time.  But otherwise it was perfect!

Wonderful!! I did take some of the suggestions given and added more spices, beef broth instead of water, and red pepper flakes. I also inserted garlic slices into the meat itself. Family and friends loved it, and I will be making this dish again and again. Oh...I left out the veggies, and served with rice and black beans instead.

This is an excellent recipe.  I did as others advised and browned the meat with the Montreal seasoning and the beef broth instead of water.  I think this really made a BIG difference in the flavor, especially with the gravy.  I definitely would add more veggies and I also quartered mushrooms, since I'm a fan of mushrooms.  I thickened the juice with Wondra to make a gravy and my Husband raved to everyone about how delicious this was.  Even the leftovers were tasty.  This IS a keeper in our household.

Even though I used only a 2lb roast and adjusted the measurements accordingly the time stated for the cooker did not adjust but it should have been reduced by a couple of hours because our meat came out a little dry.  Otherwise quite yummy!!

This was a great recipe. I took the advice of a couple other reviews and browned the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning. I also added 1/4 cup of worchestire sauce and added beef bouillon to the pot. Thanks for such a good crock pot recipe!

Browned roast in worcestershire, onion powder, garlic powder for a few minutes before adding to crock pot. Cooked with potatoes, green beans, carrots, onions. Felt sauce needed more flavor and added 1 can tomato soup about half way through cooking time. Perfect.

Very good and easy to prepare.. A great and comforting meal for a cold winter night.. put in on before work and its ready when you get home.. Just be sure to trim the meat of any large pieces of fat.. as i think this would make the dish to fatty.. Enjoy it.

This was so easy and simple.  It was very flavorful, with each of the veggies blending while still maintaining their individual flavors. My only complaint was that this was a little heavy on the salt.  Since I didn't add any, not even before browning the meat, I guess it was all from the soup mix.  Still, it was tolerable and it didn't overpower the meat or vegetables too much.  I was almost afraid to lift the meat out of the pot, it was practically falling apart it was so tender!  I will make this again.

this turned out great
i listened to others and used the montreal steak seasoning on this the night before, and used 2 cups of beef broth instead of water
the taste was great
after i added a little four to the broth and made a nice gravy
did not put the potatoes in i made mashed yukon gold potatoes and the gravy over them was perfect.

It was excellent!  I added 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and 2 bay leafs.  I also added fresh mushrooms.  I browned the roast on all sides (also added flour, salt and pepper to it) before putting it in my slow cooker.  My roast was only 2 pounds.  If I were to make a 4 pound roast, I would probably add more liquid, as I found that the amount of liquid for this 2 pound roast was perfect.  I served this with "Quick and Easy Yorkshire Pudding".  It was perfection!  This recipe is definitly a keeper!  Thanks!

I Added 2-3 extra cups of beef broth (or just use beef bullion and boiling water) and then added a couple cloves of minced garlic.  Was fantastic best roast ever.  Is great with extra broth to put everything over some rice.

I've made pot roast many times, but none has ever been this good.  My mom suggested that I cook the roast overnight in the crockpot on "Low."  I added a touch of Worchesteshire sauce.  I added the potatoes, carrots and onions the next morning and cooked all on "High" for an additional 4 hours.  Everyone raved about it!

Delicious.  Perfect.  Easy. The ultimate roast, falls apart, tender and moist, with no effort on the part of the cook.  I cooked mine in the crock pot on high for about 7 hours and it was done perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first pot roast recipe I've ever liked- I hate those mushroom soup kinds. I made it once as written, but with beef broth, and it was good if a little sweet. Next time I made the carrots and potatoes separately and it was perfect. My husband thinks I'm a cooking goddess! Thanks!

Simple and flavorful. Using a mixture of reviewers' advice, I rubbed the meat with Montreal Steak Seasoning, added a swig of red wine, and threw in a spoonful of soy sauce. Next time, I'd go easier on the steak seasoning (too much pepper) and add garlic instead.

This was delicious!  I made it exactly as written with the exception that I used a 2.5 lbs chuck roast rather than the 4 lbs.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours and then on high for 2 hours and I think the next time, I will either cook it longer or I will cook it on high more than 2 hours.  It was tender but not fall apart tender.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tender and tasty. I didn't brown it first. I just threw every thing in the cooker and turned it on. Very simple and had great results.

This is a simply great recipe!  The one thing I did differently was that after the roast was done, I sliced it and spread out the slices in a roasting tray.  I sprinkled each slice of pot roast with fresh, crumbled bleu cheese and broiled it quickly until the bleu cheese was bubbly. It definitely helped dress it up!

Is this Marie's recipe or is it just from the slow cooker recipe book & the back of lipton onion soup mix?

Anywho this turned out great.  Take the advice from many others and season the roast with montreal steak seasoning before searing.  I quartered 6 baby reds and omitted the onion and celery.  Next time I may experiment with red wine.

I've never made a roast that my husband enjoyed (and it's been 19 years) because he prefers his beef quite rare and I don't.  This one was moist and juicy enough that he finished it off and kept going back for more. Great recipe!!

I'll be the first to admit I never liked pot roast as it was always too dry. This one I made for my husband and I loved it. I did follow some of the other reviewers advice and rubbed the meat with kosher salt, ground black pepper,paprika and garlic powder. I also added baby carrots, diced celery, onion, cubed white potatoes and quartered mushrooms. I only roasted mine for 4 hours and it definitely needed another 2 to 4 to make it fall off the bone. When the roast was done I took out 2 cups of the gravy and thickened it with some flour and I added gravy master to give it a stronger flavor. Then I put it back into the crockpot to thicken the rest of the gravy. All in all it was delicious.

Delicious!  We cooked it exactly like the recipe, but added the montreal steak seasoning to the dry rub before we browned the meat.  I will make this again definitely.  Cooked for about 3 hours on low then switched to high for another 3 hours.  Came out very tender and tasty.

A bit hit tonight. My crock pot (which had not been used in years) is fairly small so I cut the chuck roast in half.  It was so tender and delicious.  My in-laws visiting from Sweden couldn't believe I was going to cook it for 8 hours.  They were very impressed with the results.

Exceptional recipe.  I incorporated all of the comments and added about 4 whole cloves of garlic.  In addition, I used about a half container of baby portabella mushrooms.  Cooked ON HIGH for 5 hours.  Absolutely delicious result.

This was great.  My daugther 22 years old doesn't like red meat but after a long day of work she didn't want to cook for herself. She had two helpings.  I did use Montreal Steak seasoning on the meat and add 1 cup of beef broth to the pot.Made 2-3/4 pounds, cooked for 9 hours.

As suggested, I added 1 can of beef broth and more potatoes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  It was certainly a hit.  I put it together by 8:30 AM and it cooked on low until 5:00. We spent Labor Day at the Cleveland Air Show and came home to a delicious meal.  Also made Yorkshire Pudding, as reccomended by another reviewer, which was also a hit.

Absolutely delicious and tender!!! I didn't use carrots nor celery since I didn't have any on hand. The next day I took the left overs and added tomato sauce to it and made tacos. Love this recipe! Thanks!

This was my first time cooking a roast. It was a good basic recipe and everyone ate it. I think next time I will spice it up a little bit because it was a tad bland.

This recipe is amazing!  I would suggest adding a little more beef stock to make it even more perfect.  We had this for three days after I made it.  My fiance told me that I was "in the zone" when I made this for us.  We also had the leftovers with egg noodles and it was just as good the next day.  This is so easy!  I had never made a pot roast and now I'm excited about cooking.  Thanks Marie!!

Very good, my wife is normally not a big fan of meat, but she really liked this.  Next time I will add more carrots.  Like other reviewers, I used low sodium beef broth instead of water.

This was so good, even my picky FIL who says I can't cook thought it was great!  Changes I made for extra flavor: sprinkled w/Montreal Steak Seasoning before coating w/flour, tossed a couple of cloves of garlic and used beef broth w/a  half can of water.   It was so nice to come home to the smell of this roast cooking after a long day of work and winter cold!  My husband thickened it up a bit w/flour when it was done, made a great gravy.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I did follow others recommendations and used Montreal Steak seasoning when browning it and it added great flavor. The meat just fell apart. This is the first really good roast I have made. I usually have a problem over cooking it but not this time. Thanks!

This recipe was very good.  My husband really liked it too.  I added 1 pkg of beef herb-ox to the crock with the water and pretty much doubled all the veggies and everything just barely fit, but no problem at all- kept the water the same.  Like other posters, also added garlic powder.  The flavor was right on for a pot roast.

This was pretty good, but not the best pot roast I've ever had. It was missing.....something. The meat was tender and the whole thing was ridiculously easy to make, but in the end, I guess it was just "ok." I've had a lot better results with the "Slow Cooker Roast Beef" recipe from this site, so I'll probably keep that as my default pot roast recipe.

Very good.  I did it in the oven at 325 degrees for 3 hours.  Added some garlic in with the veggies.  The aroma was wonderful and the gravy (after I thickened it with cornstarch) was very flavorful.

YUM!  I didn't brown the beef before I put it in (it was 5am).  I followed the recipe but didn't add any extra water.  This was delicious!  But, I thought the meat was a little dry-because it was in the crock pot just too long.  That's actually the fault of my busy life and not the recipe!  Overall, this was yummy!  Thanks!

Really good recipe.  I threw a few garlic cloves in with the water to flavor it and used half a package of beef stew mix to season it.  Cooked it on low for 6 hours and on high for an hour and a half and it was fall-apart tender.  Also had a TON of veggies in there - skipped the celery, extra onion, red and gold potatoes and baby carrots - and they all came out nice and tender.  Yum!!!

Yummy!  For some reason, I had had bad luck w/ roasts in a crock pot, so I tried this recipe, and I have found THE recipe that I will always use now.  I prefer mashed potatoes so I did those separately, but the meat was so tender and juicy.  Perfect.  Definitely a keeper.

As suggested, I doubled the carrots but ran out of room in my crock pot so I couldn't double the potatoes! Made mashed potatoes on the side instead :)  Great recipe, first time making pot roast and it was delicious!

I also doubled the potatoes, onions and celery.  I used a bit of Kitchen Bouqet to brown the meat and I added a touch of liquid smoke to the crock pot.  This is a complete meal!

This recipe was very good.  However, I took some advice from others.  I doubled the vegetables and added peas and green beans!  Also, I added about 1/4 cup of Worcestershire Sauce.  At the end, I pulled the meat out and thickened it with some corn starch.  It made a lovely gravy.

Wow! This was a fabulous recipe. I have a big family so I added extra spuds and extra carrots, with 2 cans of beef broth. Onion soup mix. I browned the roast first. The beef was so tender and the carrots were oh so sweet. My 7 year old never eats carrots but he ate these and enjoyed them immensely! Great recipe I will definitely make it again. Thanks Marie

Two thumbs WAY UP! This recipe is wonderful, and lovely! I read other reviews about the meat turning out bland, so I decided to make sure mines was well seasoned before browning it. It practically melts in the mouth! It's delicious, tender, and just down right good! My 7-yr old son couldn't get enough of it. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I used beef broth instead of water like others suggested.  I also used an herb and vegetable soup mix instead of onion.  I will make this one again and again.

We love this recipe. I usually cut it in half. I never take the time to brown the beef. I hardly ever have celery, so that gets left out. But this dish always turns out great and leaves my house smelling yummy too!

Excellent!! Moist, tender, flavorful, and juicy, but best of all, EASY!  I used a bottom round roast instead of a chuck roast and it was delicious.  Next time I will take others' suggestions and use beef broth and worcestershire sauce while cooking to maximize the flavor.  My husband and I loved it--will definitely make regularly.

Yum!  My husband and I loved this recipe!!!  I only used 2.5lbs of meat and added lots of carrots and potatoes.  I also followed other people's suggestions and used 1 can of beef broth instead of water.  The house smelled so good all day!  The beef just fell apart and was really good with some of the juice added as gravy.  So good!

Pretty good.  A little strong on the onions.  Next time I might leave the fresh onion out.  I used low sodium beef broth instead of water and added a little garlic powder to the roast before browning.  I will make this again but play with it a little.

I used a 2 pound roast and it was so tender that it fell apart. I left out the celery and used more onions than called for. I couldn't taste much difference than other recipes of roast beef so I only gave it three stars.  The finished product was pretty good though....

Decent, in fact very good, but somewhat on the basic side .  I cooked the meat for 8 hours and that might have been too long.  I do not like overcooked meat, though based on other reviews, I expected the meat to be more on the tender side if the meat was more done than some appreciate.  The meat wasn't tough but certainly didn't "fall apart" as others reported.  The veggies were awesome and I did add corn starch to some of the juice and it made a very good gravy.  Leftovers are excellent.

I thought this recipe was good. I overcooked the roast a little - so it was more like beef stew - but it was just as tender and good.  I meant to include a can of beef broth as some others suggested, but forgot.  The next time I make it I will, as I think it will give it even more flavor.  But it was still really good even without it.  Definate keeper!

I took everywhere's suggestion and used a can of low-sodium beef broth in place of the water, and added some minced garlic. I also left out the celery and replaced the onion with dehydrated onion. The roast itself was so tender it fell apart, and everything had a wonderful flavor. Was the first roast I'd ever made, and it was a hit with the entire family. Not enough potatoes and carrots for my family, so next time will make more, but I definitely will be making this again. Oh, to thicken the sauce, I made a slurry of flour and water and added it the last half hour of cooking.

This was one of the best meals I've ever made! I used a 2.5 pound roast, and one whole can of beef broth in lieu of water. Cooked in the crock for ~ 6 hours on high--it was delish! Onions just melt in your mouth. Thanks Marie!

This is fabulous, great flavor, super easy, couldn't ask for more!  I did not add potatoes to the mix for fear they'd end up getting too soft and falling apart, so I just added the other veggies.  I made mashed potatoes when I got home, and thickened up the broth with corn starch to make more of a gravy.  Perfect winter comfort food meal.  Thanks!

We loved this!  4 lbs. of meat is a lot.  I used about 2.5 lbs.  I also added a lb. of carrots and several stalks of celery, and used beef broth instead of water.  It was great!  We will make this again and again.

My 3lb roast came out so tender and tasty!  I slow cooked it yesterday, then put everything in the fridge overnight.  The fat hardened on top and was easily lifted off.  We picked out what we wanted and nuked our plates.  A quick meal for tonight!  I don't like it when recipes say salt and pepper to taste because it leaves a lot of room for error.  We had to add a little salt at the table (which is better than having the whole dish ruined by being too salty!).

I just purchased a crock pot and this was the first recipe I tried.  The roast was absolutely fantastic, and it was so great coming home after work and having the house smell divine.  I added more veggies than was called for including some red and yellow peppers, and several of the small red potatoes which were delicious.   This recipe is a real "keeper"...so thanks, Marie, for what I know will be a family favorite.

It was just average.  Very bland.  Definatly needs more seasonings added.  The meat is very tender.  I was very glad to have a stew with out tomatos.

I used Knorr's pot roast flavoring instead of onion soup mix and cooked the living **** out of it (>10 hours).  Had so much I invited friends over, and they left nothing for me!

I did not think this tasted very good- it had a weird flavor, probably from the onion soup mix. also, all the vegetables just tasted exactly the same as the meat, which was overkill. I had a 3.5 pound roast and I cooked it on low for 10 hours, it came out way over done. I will not make this again.

The meat was very tender and delicious, but the gravy lacked something.  I thickened it with cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers, but I thought the flavor wasn't full enough.  It just tasted like onion soup.  I will definitely be making this again, but next time I will add spices to see if I can improve the sauce.  Overall a good recipe.

Fantastic!  I cooked a 2.5 lb roast on high for 8 hrs.  I used 2 cups of water and a can of broth plus some bouillon cubes.  We like lots of gravy, it was so tasty, all I had to do was thicken it with some cornstarch and water.  The meat was just falling apart!

I grew up having the advantage of one of the world's greatest cooks, my aunt.  And then, after I was married, My mother in law turned out to be almost as good.  She made a fantastic pot roast...Up till now I have not found one as good.  This one is as good as the ones she used to make for Sunday dinner.  We had company this weekend and didn't want to spend a lot of time cooking but wanted something really good. We visited with our company while dinner cooked all unattended.  Everyone enjoyed one of the greates pot roasts they had had in some time. Thanks Maria

Yum! I skip the celery, and use a bottle of beer instead of the water.  Then, when we are ready to eat I make gravy using a cup of the juices from the cockpot.  My husband loves it.

Thanks, Marie.  This is a keeper!  Added 2 additional cups of water, a bay leaf and 1 beef bouillon cube.  Ladled out the liquid at the end, reduced a bit and thickened with a little flour mixed with water.  Makes a delicious gravy!

This was a pretty good and easy pot roast recipe.  We ended up having a later dinner than normal so it cooked 12 hours, but it wasn't quite as tender as I wanted.  Not tough at all, but not falling apart either.  Might want to add a few more spices to kick it up a bit.

Are the great reviews for this actual recipe or for the different recipes everyone created. It seems like everyone created a different recipe and just posted it under this recipe. Please people create your own recipe than post it so we can review it.

Really good, and super tender. If your meat is not quite all the way tender, keep going, it will actually get more tender with more time. I subbed some onion powder, garlic powder, and some other spices for the soup mix, and it still turned out great.

Very good but definitely had to amp up the seasoning for our taste. I coated the raw meat with a flour mixture that included salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder and then seared off. I then put the meat in the crockpot and topped off with the soup mix, onion, celery,  2 cloves of crushed garlic, 1 small bag of baby carrots, 1 small bag of whole baby red potatoes, just a dash of Worcestershire sauce and 2 cups of beef stock instead of water. Once I did take out the meat I did have to add a cornstarch slurry to thicken the gravy as well as adjust the seasonings.

Did not use the soup mix because did not want the preservatives and added salt.
Seared roast all over simmered on stove top for 2 1/2 hours was fully done.

Took the advice of others and used Montreal Steak Seasoning, de-glazed the skillet with red wine & added to pot, included worchestershire sauce & increased the liquid (1 1/2 cup beef broth).  Put veggies in 4 hours after start.  Surprised that it was ready in just 6 hours (used ingredients for serving 6) even though crockpot was definitely set to 10 hours.
Result was fabulous.  Family asked for leftovers next day to finish it up.

Loved this recipe. It was very simple and the meat and just fell apart.  I followed the directions to a tee.  I did however leave the skin on the potato's and used the beef broth instead of water option.

Roast was a huge hit with family. Will definitely be using this easy recipe again. Everyone really liked the flavor and tenderness of the meat.

I definitely made some substitutions, but I NEED to record them. This came out DELICIOUS. I rubbed the chuck roast in a rub I made of smashed garlic (5 cloves), olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Marinated overnight. 
I substituted the water for beef broth. And I added Worcestershire. Added garlic powder and pepper about 2 hours in.

Delicious!! I’ve never browned my meat on both sides before placing in the crock pot ...not sure what it does but I did it . It feel apart with a spoon!!! I placed all veggies on top of the meet so they wouldn’t be mushy. We love garlic..garlic goes with all things in our home so I did add garlic and parsley and pepper  to the chuck roast feels to both sides for browning . Great recipe thanks!

I caramelized the onions,  seared the meat on all sides and  then put everything in my Crock-Pot at 10pm, and went to sleep. The next day at 4pm it was so fork tender, falling apart...my family loved it. Barely any left!

I seared my chuck roast in Monterey Steak seasoning and worcestershire sauce. Then after searing, I poured a small amount of beef broth into the searing pan and scraped all the delicious bits then poured everything over the meat already placed in the crock pot. Also, used 1 cup beef broth in place of the 1 cup H2O. This was all based on the recommendations from the comments. Thanks for being awesome people. Oh and for all those making this in a crock pot: don’t lift that freaking lid, no matter how tempting!!

Great results with whatever alteration EXCEPT for the cooking time.  I’ve made a pot roast before on high for 8 hours and it just didn’t cut it. The meat needs over 10 hours of cooking time at least (I did it on low for 11) The meat was Devine super tender everyone was raving. Even the picky daughter. Thanks so much.

This was bland and flavorless. I used beef broth instead of water, I pierced the meat with a fork on both sides, added Worcestershire sauce, and seasoned the meat before browning with Montreal steak seasoning. I added the onion soup mix to the crock pot. It still had almost no flavor. I’m glad I added the veggies halfway through instead of at the beginning. They were Very tender, but not mushy. It might have been better if I added red wine to the crock pot or maybe a marinade before-hand as another reviewer suggested. I think I’ll try another recipe next time.

This was a hit at our house.  I did make some adjustments - I brined the chuck roast for 12 hours, added 2 OSM packets, skipped the celery, added 10.5 oz can of cream of mushroom.  But super easy to make and fork tender.

Very easy and very good. I didn't have a dry onion soup mix so I added onion powder and a small amount of my favorite steak dry rub rubbed directly on the meat.  We really liked it. Next time I make it I will follow the recipe directly

This is absolutely the easiest and most delicious roast I've ever made! It melted in my mouth; i couldn't get enough. I did made one addition and small added about two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce (which i put in every beef recipe - I'm addicted).

I made Maries easy slow cooker pot roast exactly as it appears. The end result was perfect. My husband loved it. He wants me to make it again with just a few adjustments but, I'm sure they won't change the taste. He wants the onions larger so I'm going to quarter them then he wants more carrots and larger celery.  Good changes no problem.  Good job Marie.

It turned out as advertised. I sampled it after 11 hours in the crock pot and decided to let it cook longer. After 13 hours it was fall apart delicious. It was probably the easiest meal to prepare that I have come across in a magazine or online. Next time I am going to add some more carrot and celery.

Simple and works if you add other things like mushrooms.  Searing the roast is a key element of success of a slow cook.  I would cook it as long as your internal temp is 145, this helps sort out times for what ever size roast.

Everyone loved it!  Fast and easy to get going in the morning and ready in 8 hours on low for a 3.5 lb chuck roast.  My only problem was my cut of meat was too fatty.

Loved it, and it tastes so amazing. I don't have a camera that's good enough to show the details, but my written review can be helpful. My family loved it, and I loved it. We ate it all, and I had to improvise on some of the ingredients, but it still came out amazing. Following this recipe was the first time I cooked anything with a slow cooker. Thank you for sharing this

I followed the recipe exactly, but used a 2.25 lb beef. Veggies turned out perfect (I did put them in halfway during the cook period, per other reviews). Meat was tender, but very dry. I thought the searing would have prevented that.  Will probably stick with pot roast in the oven rather than crockpot.

After I seared the meat I drain the grease out of the pan instead of water are used beef broth heated up the pan again added broth to the pan scraped up all the brown bits in the pan add that back into the crockpot for added flavor for the gravy making process at the end I added four carrots and four stocks of celery +2 onions set the crockpot setting 10 hours low and let the torture begin from all the aromas

First pot roast I’ve ever made and I loved it! The only thing I would do different is add more water, I’ve always preferred my pot roasts to be more “soupy” (how it was made when I was younger). Would do again, very very good.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I found it was relatively easy to make but not as easy as another recipe a friend had given me which just had me put everything in the crockpot and turn it on.  Also it seemed the meat didn’t have enough liquid towards the end of the cooking time, so I added @1 cup more water.

It came out awesome. I did change it up some. Instead of water i used beer. Doubled the veggies and sauce. So  4 cans cream of mushroom and 2 cups of beer. And double the veggies and potatoes. I also waited 2 hours before putting in the veggies or potatoes because I like them less mushy. I have a large family that loved the veggies.

I've made this recipe as is many times, and it is always wonderful.  Yesterday I had more time to fuss with it so I did!  I mixed about 1/4 cup of flour, a shake or 2 or salt and maybe one Tbsp. of Montreal Steak Seasoning.  Coated the meat, shook off the excess and seared it on both sides (maybe 3-4 min. a side) in olive oil with a heaping tsp. of minced garlic and a handful of chopped onion. I put the meat in the crock and then deglazed the pan with a can of beef broth and 1/2 cup or so of red wine (be sure to save some for the cook later in the day!).  I stirred in the onion soup mix, poured the pan mixture over the meat in the crock and let it go on low for about 4 hours.  I then added 5 small to avg. size white potatoes and almost 1 1b. carrots cut in strips.  I pulled the meat out at 8 hours and let the veg/potatoes cook some more.  I pulled the veg/potato out and made yummy gravy in the crock.  This is always a hit as is, but all the extra stuff made it a really big hit!

I made the roast by itself. Very good and very easy as is. We prefer extra flavor so I sprinkled garlic powder over meat; added 1/4 cup worchesterchire sauce to beefy onion soup mix and water mixture, and cut up one medium yellow onion in 4 big pieces and put inside with meat. Cooked on high about 5 hours. Fall apart tender.

I seared a 4 lb roast in a blend of canola and olive oil with first flavoring the hot oil with 4 sliced cloves of garlic and 3 or 4 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce, (seared the trimmed roast as directed in the recipe). Then I made my own dry onion soup mix which cuts down on the sodium (see the recipe on this All Recipes site). I added a little bit of diced green bell pepper (1/4 pepper) for added taste, a 1/4 tsp of  crushed red pepper flakes, and a  dash of red cayenne pepper as well for added flavor. I used a dash of sea salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper on the meat before adding the vegetables. I also added low sodium beef bullion paste to the cup of hot water for flavor before adding to the crockpot. This slow cooker pot roast and vegetables are superb!

The recipe was simple to make. I browned the meat and followed the recipe as is except for the onion mix, I didn’t have any, and let it cook for a full 8+ hours. It turned out well.  My only comment, and I have seen it written on other reviews, is that the veggies get very soft so I might consider throwing them in after 2 hours or so. Also, my husband said it was good but thought it was a little bland but that is probably due to the fact that I didn’t put in the onion mix. I would make this again though.

This is my favorite pot roast recipe.  I’ve made it twice and my husband and I LOVE it!  I seasoned the roast with seasoned salt, garlic powder and lemon pepper and seared it on both sides.  I added two cloves of minced garlic and used half the water and half beef broth. Turned out great!

Made this exactly to the T a couple months ago using my new crock pot I got for the Xmas before last, except I used half cup red wine and 1/2 cup water just to give it a little extra flavor profile. I could not believe how delicious this recipe was with  such little ingredients, as far as seasoning goes. That dry onion soup packet ???? making it again tonight and the only thing I’m gonna change is adding more salt and pepper to the roast before browning. I didn’t wanna overdo it and wasn’t sure how much salt was already in the dry onion soup mix. All in all, probably the best pot roast I’ve ever had. 5 stars for sure! I gave some to my Dad and sister and they even boasted to my grandma how delicious it was, now I’m gonna have to make HER some, lol.

I did not use the soup mix. I just used a fat free salt free beef stock. Was very good.

I chose a lean roast to begin with and the meat was dry and tasteless.  So were the vegetables.  Won't make this again.

We really enjoyed this but next time I want to add more veggies (frozen mixed) and I can't believe that I didn't think to toss in a few smashed garlic cloves. And I will use broth instead of water.

Tasted great - took notes from previous comments.   Grilled on 4 sides with salt, pepper, seasoned salt and montreal steak seasoning.  Placed in slow cooker with garlic and I added more like 2 cups broth.  Added 1 chopped onion and soup mix.   Cooked for 4 hours and then added 5 potatoes and 1 whole bag baby carrots.  I added a couple of spicy peppers and cooked for 2 hours before removing the peppers.  Came out great.  Very moist and has a nice little spice to it.

Easy? yes, taste? good.  personal novice issue was using the Insta Pot Pressure Cooker and prep.  For prep, it did not specify type of potatoes so 6 was way to many.  Same for the carrots. Whole or cut or baby?   Overall though the three of us ate it for days.

This was my first attempt at making a roast with a slow cooker on my own because I was really intimidated by it. I have to say, it was SO much easier than I thought it was going to be and it turned out amazing!!!

Excellent. Used Montreal steak seasoning before browning, and beef broth instead of water. Otherwise everything else was the same.

I used blade roast, since i live in Canada and you can't buy chuck roast at the big box gorcery stores. Substitued chicken broth for the water.

Everything else followed as per recipe.

House smelled so good when i came home from work and dinner was done!

Will make it again.  Put it in for 10 hrs on low. Didn’t touch it at all.  So tender!  3.25 lb no-bone chuck roast.   Only things different were some drained stewed tomatoes on the bottom and a little Dale’s Seasoning for 1/2 hr before hand.  Oh, and two teaspoons of minced garlic.  Next time I’ll throw a couple of bay leaves in as well. Highly recommend this one!

Disappointed I bought a $20 chuck roast 3.7 lbs. The Lipton onion soup mix left a weird taste in my mouth. 12 hrs in crockpot, meat was falling apart but it wasn't flavorful or juicy in a good way. Vegetable MUSHY. but the worst part was the greasy, oily food. Ugh, Never making this again.

I added lots more carrots, celery, potatoes. I also added peas & broccoli to it. 
The only thing I didn't like was my fault, I added a bit too much pepper.

This was one of the best pot roasts I have EVER had/made, my whole family loved it. I recommend adding some mushrooms halfway through cooking, gave it some extra texture. I also browned the roast in olive oil before putting into the slow cooker and used Montreal seasoning as well

This was delish!! I rubbed the chuck roast with GrillMates Worcestershire Peppercorn seasoning before I browned it on all sides in olive oil!  Instead of water I used low sodium beef stock and sweet red wine. It was awesome!

I used Maries recipe and also added the soup mix from another recipe.  I tossed in a small bottle of Merlot wine too and whatever vegies I had in the fridge, red bell pepper, yellow onion, sliced carrots, green onions, celery, a large potato cut up.  It was similar to my beef stew recipe, but with the larger cut of meat.  I cooked it in a Breville Risotto Plus, which is a professional restaurant rice and slow cooker.   I made so many changes it could hardly be called the same recipe, but it was a good start to a great meal.

Excellent recipe.  I made it as printed with a couple of changes:  I added mushrooms and paprika and omitted potatoes. (,I made mashed potatoes instead).  The meat fell apart making a messy presentation but tasted great and was tender and juicy.  I made a lot of gravy and will use it today on the remaining beef, and make sandwiches.  I will definitely make thi again.

Very easy to make and delicious. Made it while watching the very helpful video. The only change I made was added 1 more cup water (w/ beef bullion). My husband loved it - will definitely make again.

I added a second cup of water as it was getting too dry at high cooker setting.   Meat was tender and dish was well received.  The onion soup mix has enough flavor that I think you can omit the salt when seasoning the meat before browning.  .

If you pull the meat out of the liquid, it can be a bit bland and reminds me of something my mother or grandmother made while growing up.  My husband and I both agreed it needed a lot more seasoning, so he made a fantastic marinade for the leftovers.  If you like flavorful things, I highly recommend you play around with the seasoning. Salt and pepper and onion soup mix are not enough unless you like more simple flavors.

It sure was easy as the name suggests! My household is just my husband and I so I halved the recipe and used the full cook time.  I also added a clove of garlic. It was pretty good for dinner that night but honestly, it did not heat well the next day.

Without braising, try covering roast with one can of cream of mushroom soup, then spread dry onion soup mix on it.  Instead of water use beef stock.  This can be crocked or cooked at 350 for 2-3 hours in tightly sealed foil.

With a few modifications, this recipe was amazing! I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and used 2 cans of beef broth rather than the water. I also seasoned the meat with Montreal Steak seasoning prior to browning. Once in the crock pot, I smothered all exposed roast with minced garlic. I cut the potatoes into one inch cubes, skin on, and seasoned with jalapeno salt. Add potatoes AFTER the first 4 hours of cooking, then add the rest of the veggies about 3 hours prior to end to avoid them being too mushy. I cooked this yesterday for dinner. My wife and 10 year old daughter both LOVED it. I looked over and caught my daughter drinking the liquid out of her bowl when she was finished!

This pot roast was just okay - maybe I used the wrong cut of meat, but the meat was very, very dry - the veggies were perfect and the gravy was delicious, but after my  husband and I had it, I threw away the rest.  Maybe I will try it again with a different cut of meat.

Delicious and tender. I brown the meat ahead and add garlic to the meat. I always spray the crock pot with Pam before cooking. Makes cleanup easy.

The Recipe as listed was very easy and straight forward to make and the flavor was amazing! My husband says that its even better the next day. I used the left over broth as a special treat for our dog. Put 2 tablespoons of broth into each section of an ice cube tray and freeze it. Then you can just use one cube of broth heated up to pour over their food.

This recipe led to one delicious pot roast! It was my first time using a slow cooker. Super easy recipe. I did modify it by using a beef broth for extra flavor and I used way more than one cup of water. I filled the basin to completely cover the the vegetables and most of the roast. I had a 3.5 lb roast and it barely fit in the slow cooker, and I had to use 3/4 of the veggies I cut. I didn't realize it was so small! I filled it so it didn't dry out throughout the day and everything stayed moist. It fell apart in such a good way! I left it from 6:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I seared the pot roast with only black pepper.  I seared it on high for a few minutes on each side with a tsp of high heat stable avocado oil.  I deglazed the pan with a mixture of 2 tsp grainy dijon mustard, 1 tbl of Worcestershire, 1 tsp paprika and 1/2 cup water.  I placed the roast in the slow cooker, poured the sauce on top and added 2 tbl of ranch dressing dry mix,  a cup of filtered water and 5 cloves of whole garlic. Cooked on low for 8 hrs.  Served with whole baby red potatoes, carrots and onion roasted in the oven with fresh rosemary, a little pepper and 1 tbl of olive oil.  We smashed the veggies a little before topping with the gravy from the pot.  I didn't thicken it, we are fine with an au jus type of sauce.  It was delicious, flavorful and not too salty.  Will definitely make this again!

I skipped browning the meat, and cut the added water in half.  Still wound up with a bit too much juice, but it was still good; I just needed to use a slotted spoon to get the last few bits out.  I also followed others' advice on here and added the vegetables later, around 3 hours after starting.  I used baby carrots straight from the bag, potatoes cut into quarters, a quartered onion, and celery in short sections.  I like my onions cooked to death, and they were.  Potatoes and carrots were a little soft, maybe a few fewer hours in there would have helped.

This is a nice, handy recipe!  It's been ages since I made it strictly as is; but I find its my "go to" recipe when I'm shopping.  So that I don't forget ingredients.  I have a horrible memory.

Only change I made was not browning the roast first.  Put it directly into the slow cooker.   Turned out awesome.  Will definitely make again.

Used Montreal steak seasoning before searing instead of just salt and pepper. Also switched the water for beef broth and omitted the celery. Came out so good

I added a head of cabbage the last 3 hours cut in quarters.  We like garlic and I browned that with onions and added some to meat as well

I made this with very slight changes and it is spectacular.  I  used beef broth about a cup.  Added a large bay leaf and some fresh thyme leaves - about two sprigs.  I also used the Montreal Steak Seasoning but a word of caution - it gives a peppery taste so if you don't enjoy peppery beef, use it sparingly or not at all.  Cook it 8-10 hours, the longer the better!  I don't cut my veggies too small but I did use onion, carrots, potatoes and celery.  Delicious!

This was a super easy and tasty meal. I only gave it 4 stars because the vegetables need to be added later in the cooking time to keep them from turning mushy. I ended up cooking mine for half the time listed on high setting because I was short on time. It turned out great. I put my veggies in at the half-way point and they were just the right amount of crispness.

A great recommendation as a starter for the budding slow cooker.

This was a good recipe. I used a pot roast flavoring mix instead of the onion mix and cooked the overall roast for 8 hours (6 hours on low and 2 hours on high)

Prepared this per the recipe. Very good. Drippings make a great gravy as well. I used a chuck roast from a purchased cow and feel this made a difference in flavor. I don't think I missed any flavors by not adding Montreal steak seasoning

This was sensational!! I made this hoping the boyfriend would finally agree that a good pot roast is GOOD. (he describes most as eating cardboard).  He really loved it as well as I! I didn't have any celery but did follow most of the recipe exactly as written. I used 1 can of beef broth instead of water.  Instead of cooking the potatoes with the roast I cooked them on the stove and mashed them.  Used a little corn starch with water to make a gravy with the beef broth. Delicious!

It was delicious. I started with a small bowl for dinner with intentions of returning for more. Sadly, when I returned, there was none left. My family had eaten all of it. Next time, I will set some aside for later.

I will definitely be making this again! Things thay I did differently was my roast wasn't 4lbs it was almost 3 lbs. I used a brand new crock pot so I'm not sure if that's why it didn't take as long to cook and/or because my roast was smaller it only took 6 hours for mine to be done. I used mushrooms instead of celery in mine. I only used half the package of onion soup and I added 1/2 cube of beef bouillon. I also added 2 gloves of minced garlic. Everything turned out perfectly except the only thing I would of done differently was when I opened my packed of my roast there was like half a centimeter or so of just pure thick fat underneath it and I wish I would of trimmed that off. Because after my roast was done there was sooooo many chunks of fat floating around in my crock pot and also I had to pick the meat out of all of the fat. It kind of pissed me off because I spent $30 almost for this roast and half of it was fat and you couldn't see it when you  bought it at the grocery store. I feel like I got ripped off. But besides that it was still delicious and the veggies were perfect!!! Made this for my Birthday!!

This recipe is perfect as is. The only change I made was to use beef broth in place of the water, although I'm sure it wouldn't be delicious either way. This is now my go-to roast recipe.

The consistency of the meat was okay. It ended up being very bland. I'll try some of the variations mentioned In the comments section next time. It was easy to make though.

Great basic slow-cooker pot roast recipe! I added some fresh rosemary, but there is lots of room for seasoning (just watch the salt with the onion soup).

Very good recipe, although I changed the chuck roast to a blade roast also used 3/4 cup of red wine and 3/4 cup of beef stock instead of the water for added flavor and added 4 ounces of mushrooms. I was very happy with the outcome.

As stated, this was a quick and easy recipe. The roast was really tender, moist and delicious. I cut the veggies a little too big and so they did not  quite completely cook through.

Easy recipe.  I rubbed the meat with a prime rib spice blend before browning with a little olive oil.    Then I deglazed the pan with the water and poured that in to add a little flavor.  2 lb chuck roast cooked on high for 30 minutes and low for 6 hours with all the veggies.  Very good!

Great recipe, nice and easy. I used a packet of pot roast slow cooker sauce in addition to the dry onion soup mix.  I also browned my pot roast in a mixture of oil and beef bouillon cube for added flavor and doubled the vegetables to make the pot roast a little more robust.  I also added a little salt and pepper to the crock pot.  The meat comes out very tender and the vegetables perfectly softened without being too mushy.

I used a can of french onion soup in place of package soup and water. Aroma was amazing , taste was also. Added a package of gravy to broth and heated on the stove.  Served over beef and veggies.

This was delicious!  The only thing I changed was adding a couple garlic cloves to the mix.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I made this and it was very good, however the next I make I will put the veggies on the bottom and the meat on top. Some of the vegetables were a little undercooked. Also I may add cream of mushroom soup to the gravy for flavor

My roast turned out fork tender and was not stringy. The veggies were done perfectly.  The gravy was thin, but using cooking 101 I thickened it with a little cornstarch/water mixture Hubby was impressed.  I will make this again.

I did make 2 changes - 1. used a can of beef broth instead of water. 2. added the veggies 5 hours into cooking.

This recipe is pretty standard. The method of replacing onions with onion soup mix was a method used in 60's & 70's.  Actually adding beefy onion soup mix is even tastier.  Why not just chop 1/2 an onion and add to the roast?  I would only use processed soup mix if I didn't have fresh.  

Try deglazing the pan that you seared the roast in and add a cup or two of merlot, Cabernet or any wine you like.  Be sure to add a bay leaf?  Bin Apetit!

I followed reviewers advice and used 2 cans of beef broth instead of water, seared the roast in Montreal steak seasoning before adding it to the pot with onions, broth, and soup mix. I let that cook on high for 4 hours before adding the veggies and turned it down to low for another 4 hours. I also made a gravy out of the broth and it was soooo good. This is my go to roast recipe :)

I added bisto to the water  and Montreal Steak Seasoning rubbed on to the roast. Topped it with mushrooms and let it sit while at work. There is nothing like the smell of pot roast when you open the door coming home from work :)

This recipe is Fabulous!!  I made this crockpot pot roast almost exactly as written. 

***Notes***
-I Doubled the dry onion soup mix because I love using it and have cooked with it before. 
- I replaced the water for a can of beef broth though.
-I accidentally put the potatoes/carrots on the bottom and the meat on top and it still turned out good.

***I started by browning the roast ***
- I browned the roast using olive oil and butter then I added about 1/3 cup of red wine and brought to a boil. 
-I had already cubed my potatoes and added the baby carrots to the sprayed crockpot. 
-I transferred the meat to the top of the potatoes in the crockpot. (I left the red wine sauce in the pan)
-I poured the can of beef broth to the pan on the stove and brought that sauce to a boil then I poured that sauce on top of the meat and potatoes in the crockpot.
-I cooked it for 6 hours on high.
It turned out Phenomenal!!!!!!!

I really liked this.  I used a McCormick's Pot Roast packet and also added a Liption Onion and Mushroom soup packet.  The gravy was amazing.  I cooked on low for 6 hours then cranked it up to high for the last 3 since I think my crockpot lets out too much heat from the cover.  The veggies were done just right I would say. Very tasty and the  meat was superb.  I used a 3.25 pound chuck roast as suggested.

Sorry, I had to make a change.  I did not have Onion Soup mix, so I left that and the water out and substituted a can of Cream of Mushroom soup and a little Worcestershire Sauce.  Also added parsnip with other veggies. t was yummy  and so easy.  Ready much sooner than recipe called for. Will make again!

I made as directed except I sprinkled about 1 tsp. of flour along with the salt and pepper before browning in a cast iron skillet.  I also used chicken broth instead of water, and I forgot potatoes at the grocery store.   

When I was ready to eat I strained the liquid and put it on the stove and thickened with a little cornstarch slurry.  It made a very tasty gravy for the roast, and for the noodles I served on the side.  This is very easy and pretty fool proof.  I might wind up doing this every week or two, especially on Sundays.

I've been looking for the perfect slow cooker pot roast recipe and I think I finally found ours!  The only addition I made was to brown the roast with some Montreal Steak Seasoning before adding it to the slow cooker.  A great recipe that can be tweaked a bit for your own preferences.

Soo delicious and flavorful !  This is what I did .  I seasoned a 4.5 lb boneless chuck roast with a generous amount of Montreal seasoning and seared it in olive oil first...about 3-4 min per side.  I placed it in the crockpot on top of some sliced onions.  I poured about 1 cup of beef broth into the pan I used to sear my chuck roast.  Then I added a clove of chopped garlic and a cup of red wine.  I let that simmer for a few minutes. I then added one packet of onion soup and one can of cream of mushroom.  Stirred it all together and poured it on top of my chuck roast. I cooked it on low for about 7 hrs while adding carrots and potatoes 2 hrs prior to it being done.  Whole family LOVED IT !

Could tell you all the stuff I added to it, but frankly the base recipe itself is delicious enough. I make it for potlucks all the time at work and it gets devoured. Simple but very efficient.

Of course, I made some alterations. I give it 5 starts with my suggestions. 
 I add some Montreal steak seasoning, some Worcestershire sauce, a little italian seasoning, some garlic seasoning and a little red wine vinegar to make it tender.
When you are done, make a roux with some flour and butter and use the juices from the bottom to make a gravy. The gravy is the best part. I go hard on the seasoning too. ;)

 I sear it before I put it in the crock pot. Then I deglaze the pan with some beef broth. I also use beef broth in place of the water. Makes a big difference

I do the roast alone for the first half of the cooking time then add veges for the last 3 hours or so, so they don't get too tender.
And like some of the reviews say, it is  done enough to eat half way through but you gotta let it go the full time and then it just falls apart. I also cut a good bit of the fat off mine before cooking it. I don't like the fatty bits it leaves behind.

This was my very first time making a Pot Roast and it turned out Delish! The only alternative that I made was instead of adding water I added a can of Beef Cosumme and I didn't add my carrots until the final 90 minutes of cooking the Roast! It was tender and delicious and I made homemade mashed potatoes too! My Roast cooked for 10 hours and my house smelled Wonderful!!

I appreciate that this is a good starting point but bland so I am only rating it a three star. I made changes after reading other reviews and then it turned out fab. 
I substituted the cup of water with two cups of beef stock which added flavour and gave lots of gravy. After seasoning my meat generously with salt pepper and garlic powder I coated all sides in flour ( as recommended in a different recipe) and seared all sides 4 minutes each side.  The flour thickened the gravy somewhat and but not very thick. I like fairly runny gravy so it was fine for me. I also put the carrots and potatoes in half way through the cooking and they were done well but not mushy. 
My only negative is that when cooked there was a lot of grease. Even though the roasts were well trimmed of fat chuck roasts have a lot of fat throughout so pretty unavoidable and not the fault of the recipe. I removed the carrots potatoes and meat and then skimmed off the fat. The gravy was delicious. 
To my surprise it was not too salty which I feared. My experience with slow cooker cooking is you need to season more heavily than you would with other cooking methods.
Very yummy dinner and lots of yummy leftovers. 
I used a liner and love that there is no dirty pot to clean.

I rubbed the roast with a beef seasoning and also minced garlic and put that on the roast and in the olive oil. I replaced the water with 2 cans of reduced sodium beef broth, used onion gravy packet, and a 4.1lb chuck roast. I didn't add the potatoes or celery. It turned out great! Brought it for a potluck at work and everyone loved it!

Used this mainly for instructions. Meat was done hours early, but my slow cooker does cook hot.  I rubbed with Montreal steak before browning. Used 1.5 c beef broth rather then then soup mix.  Beef was fantastic and tender.

Didn't brown the beef. Sprinkled steak seasoning on the meat instead of salt and pepper. Used beef broth instead of water.  Didn't have celery. Cooked on high for 1 hour, low for 9 hours. Perfect!

Excellent!  It was tender and very juicy. The potatoes and carrots with the onions were delectable.  I did brown the roast with coconut oil on both sides.     Thanks!

It was wonderful!  It's the first time I actually got a good pot roast using my crockpot.  It was tender, needed more salt, but I solved that problem, by just adding more before it was done.  My hubby loved it!  Which is why I cook!

My family loved this. I mostly stuck to the recipe. My big change was that I used red wine rather than water. It really added some depth of flavor. I also added the carrots and potatoes about 2-3 hours (on low) before serving rather than at the beginning. Next time I will add the potatoes a little later, because they were cooked a bit more than I like. All in all, it was scrumptious! I will totally make this again!

This is how I always make my crock pot roast, but for a French taste, I use a dry red wine instead of the water, and add mushrooms half way through the cooking time. If I want more of a German flare, I use a dark beer instead of a red wine and no mushrooms.  LOVELY. Always GREAT!

I agree with many of the other posts that this recipe needs something more. I used it as a loose guide (as I do with just about all recipes) and added beef stock, beef soup base along with French onion dry soup,  and what really made it amazing was a bell pepper (I used orange). Also, when it was time to serve, I did remove some of the liquid and mixed in cornstarch so it would stick to veggies. I have 4 children 8-13 yrs) two of which are the pickiest on the planet and EVERYONE LOVED IT!!   Overall wonderful recipe when some oomph is added!!!

I have made this several times and have discovered the following thing. If you stick to the recipe, it's delicious. If you add extra beef stock it dilutes the french onion soup flavor and the pot roast seems bland. Ideal cooking time for me was 11 hours on low for 2 pound roast. If you have a larger roast than 3 pounds, cut it in half.

I followed Simone's advice for browning the meat.  I didn't have the specific steak rub so I used the spices she outlined in her comment.  My only addition to this was to throw in canned tomatoes, including the juice.  My mother always put canned tomatoes in pot roast and I love the flavor they add.

To be honest I've  been making this for years except I add broth for the water and some Soy and Worcestershire  sauce after studding with garlic. I do sear all surfaces. It definitely isn't bland .

My husband is the meat eater, and he LOVED it!!!  I had just purchased the Phillips multi cooker and browned the meat well before the slow cooking.  It had a wonderful crust, he told me, that was divine.  (I'm vegetarian so I didn't try it. )

The meat was very tender. Used a chuck roast. Had to omit the extra salt (my grandma has hypertension). The onion soup provided more than enough salt flavor in my opinion. I added the vegetables half way through as I don't like them too mushy, all turned out very good!

Probably the best pot roast I have every made!  I followed the recipe to a tee and used burgundy wine in place of the water.  Excellant!  Made this again last night. Used Cabernet Sauvignon wine in place of the water. Didn't have any onion soup mix, so I found the recipe on here and made from scratch. Two heaping teaspoons. Fantastic! Made it again last night. Fantastic again. Salt/Pepper/browned the meat in frying pan. Than deglazed the pan with Cabernet Sauvignon and added the scrappings to the slow cooker along with another cup +/- of the wine.  At five hours on slow, added carrots, potatoes, celery and mushrooms and moved to high setting.  Two hours later, done. Can't wait for leftovers.

I love love love this! I made a profile just to comment on this recipe. I followed all the directions except I added 3/4 a bag of baby carrots and three stalks of celery. Which I'm glad I did because my 3 year old who usually hates veggies kept asking for more. The meat was perfect and kept falling apart and it had just a perfect amount of flavor to it.

I followed the instructions exactly with some tweaking. I pan seared the roast in garlic and oil. Than instead of just adding water I added beef broth and beer. Other than that I kept everything the same. This came out delicious my guest really enjoyed their meal!!!

This recipe was just okay... I will be trying it again BC it is so easy to make and its an easy way to get more veggies in a meal but I will be following other reviewers advice and cut the beef in half before putting in the slow cooker and rubbing it down with garlic and steak seasoning.  I will also be adding more veggies, but in the middle of the meal rather than at the beginning.

I have been doing this recipe for several years. I had the opportunity to make it for my very very particular Step Dad. Believe me, when he asks for the recipe, it is High Praise. Not to mention my Mum had 3 portions when she usually barely eats anything,
I stayed with the recipe. I added more onion and several cloves of garlic because I like onion and garlic.

I used 3 cups of water. It was a bit much, but am still convinced 1 cup is not enough. Perhaps 2 to 2.5 cups next time. 

I used Knorr French Onion recipe mix. 

Butter when I grilled the roast.

Super easy and a great basic recipe.  I don't try the recipe with the cream of mushroom soup since my husband cannot stand mushrooms, so I end up searching for other ideas.  This was  great just as it is, except for one teeny adjustment: no water in mine, I substituted wine! It turned out to be my own version of  Beef Bourguignon.

I made this pot roast exactly how the recipe is and it's delicious. I'm eating it now ...and I have made pot roasts and this by far is the best. The onion soup seasoning makes it. Enjoy

Made this for the first time for yesterday, dinner with our friends. We all loved it, company included and I have been told I have to make it again. I did make one change, as I didn't have any onion soup mix, I substituted beef broth for the soup mix and water. Thank you for a delicious recipe.

I added 2 cloves of garlic (not cut up but whole and peeled)

Thickened the broth after removing the roast to "rest" with a jar of Beef Gravy to give it more consistency and a bit more flavor.  Over all it was the BEST I've ever done with a crockpot potroast. My roast was boneless and was only 2 1/2 lbs...... but I cooked it  (after searing all sides) for the recommended 8 hrs.  Really helps to remove the roast to REST for 10-15 minutes after finished cooking.  Slices so much better!!!  YUM!

Season meat and braise before putting it into crockpot. Add whorchestershire sauce to water and pour over roast. Cook 8 hrs and add carrots, onions a new celery about 3-4 hr s before end. Make gravy . Very tender. Made mashed potatoes to accompany it.

Tip, don't salt your meat when making this, the dry soup mix will be enough salt for everything.

I have NEVER been able to make a pot roast  and I made this recipe last night and was  absolutely surprised that it turned out perfect!  I've always made a roast with a backup meal due to thinking it would turn out like a tough rock.. But not anymore.  I was so happy it called for onionsoup since I forgot to buy an onion and used two beef billion cubes  dissolved in a mug of hot water.  I did sprinkle a little garlic salt on each side along with the salt and pepper while I browned it. Also I used a pack and a half of the onionsoup worried it would be flavorless like every roast I've attempted. I put the carrots on bottom and potatoes on top but about two hours before it was finished, against  knowing I shouldn't open the lid I moved the potatoes under the meat. Cooked from 9:30am until 6pm on low. Delicious, flavorful and falling apart! Extremely happy!

I have made this twice. The first time, exactly as the wonderful recipe specifies and it came out amazing. 

The second time, I did not have French onion soup mix. So I added the Continental brand, Swedish Meatballs powdered recipe base, and doubled the water. It was excellent - but quite a different flavour of course. 

It has proven to me that this recipe is A1 excellent - and is very adaptable. Any powdered meal base or powdered soup works wonders. 

Thanks for a lovely recipe - its now my go-to for crockpot roast.

Went with other suggestions and rubbed Montreal mixed spices on the roast before searing. Just salt and pepper was too bland according to other reviews. Really wish I would have replaced water with something flavorful. It was ok, but I was expecting more. Think I'll stick to cream of mushroom soup instead of watet for next time.

I loved, loved, loved this recipe!!! And so did my family. I must say that I did make a few changes. I used:  3 lbs. of London Broil instead Chuck Roast which I seared with Montreal Steak seasoning instead of salt & pepper, 1 lb. of carrots, 2 lbs. of red potatoes (skin on cubed), 3 celery stocks, 1 yellow onion (chopped), a dry onion soup packet, and 1 beef bullion cube in my 1 cup of water. I put it in my crock-pot on high for 2.5 hours and then on low for 4.5. The meat just fell apart.

VERY GOOD.  Added 4 medium potatoes and more celery.
Put in the meat first then the vegetables on top.  Mix the onion soup mix with the water and pour over everything.  Next time could thicken the gravy.  Remove the roast and the vegetables.   Maybe stir in 1/4 cup  water blended with 2 tbsp all-purpose flour.  Cook on HIGH until thickened.  Serve over rice or noodles.

Based on reviews of it being bland I used a combo of this recipe and my old recipe and rubbed the roast with worsteshire sauce and yellow mustard a sprinkle of flour then browned it in some oil before throwing it in the crock pot. The mustard brings out an amazing flavor in the beef that I've used for years. Hope you enjoy

I actually followed the recipe the first time after almost not making it because so many reviewers admit that what they cooked is not this recipe.  

Following the recipe, I thought it was quite good and rate it five stars.  The meat was as tender and can be and the onion soup served to bring out the flavor of the meat rather than covering it up.  The time was perfect and both the meat and vegetables were just how we like them.

Having reviewed the actual recipe, I will add that I've since made it by adding the water, onion soup, and a cup of red wine (I use pinot noir) in the pan after it's browned.  I reduce all that a bit and then throw everything in the slow cooker.  That's a nice way to add an extra kick.  But someone just wanting a classic pot roast should be very happy with this recipe.

Making this dish was very easy and the end product was worth the wait. The meat was pull apart tender and I coupled it with mash potatoes to make it more delicious.

I make this recipe about one time per week. My boyfriend and I absolutely love it! I usually use a 2.5 pound roast and cook on low for 5 hours and turn it high for the last 2. I also add Worcestershire and soy sauce to the meat very liberally.  I use baby carrots and cut red potatoes in 4ths in order to make it an easier prep! Turns out excellent every time!

This was delicious. The meat was really tender. I accidentally cooked it  on high for 8 hrs and it was fine. I seared it with salt, pepper and onion powder. Added 2 cups of beef broth instead of 1 cup of water and a splash of red wine I had sitting around. So yummy and I am not usually a fan of anything that comes out of the crock pot.

Great recipe!  So simple and tastes great everytime!. Deleted all other pot roast recipes.   This one is a keeper.  I added more carrots and used beef broth as other reviewers recommended.

It was easy to make but definitely was  a bit bland.  I added red wine and rosemary but it still needed some oomph

This recipe produced delicious results. I cooked it for about 11 hours (I work far from home) and it wasn't dry at all. The meat fell off the bone. I didn't use as much BBQ sauce as instructed because it would have been overkill. I just brushed however much BBQ sauce I wanted.

Been making this twice a year for a couple of years now, Christmas being one.  Loved by ALL.  I use a 4 lb chuck roast, low sodium beef broth instead of water.  Season with salt, garlic powder and Lowry's seasoning.  I always make extra red potatoes in a second crock so there is a mixture of potatoes, which my college kids love, and omit celery but add fresh mushrooms. House smells lovely Christmas morning and while we enjoy a spiced cider and Monkey Bread breakfast, everyone is hovering around the roast in the crockpot.  :)  Couldn't be easier!  Served with King's Hawaiian warmed rolls--yummy!!!!  This is a much-anticipated dish in our home, and seriously, it doesn't get easier than this.  There is NOTHING wrong with the "original" at all; just not everyone is a celery fan or whatever--I think it's taking a great original recipe and tailoring it to what your family likes. To me, it's still Marie's!  Her original recipe is taped to the inside cover of my Crockpot recipe book--with my notes on the side margins.

I just made it in a new crockpot. 2# roast 3 hours and it is overcooked and tough! I've made it this way for years with no problems before! It's usually delicious! Guess I'll go back to oven baking using the same ingredients!

Great base recipe. Based on other reviews I used this recipe as a base. Mine was a 4.6lb round roast. I too used Montreal seasoning as the rub, and browned with olive oil, along with a minced shallot. After browning, I put the roast in my slow cooker. With the skillet still hot, I added 2 cans of beef broth and simmered, keeping all of that goodness and poured it over the roast in the slow cooker. To this I added the base ingredients less the potatoes. At 4 hours I added 2 hand fulls of baby carrots along with a minced clove of garlic. At 6 hours I added 1.5 lbs of baby potatoes. I loved the result!! Great flavored fall-apart beef-  the first round of veggies almost disintegrates (and is so yummy) The potatoes are perfect. Next time around I'll add a lb of baby potatoes at the beginning along with the potatoes with 2-3 hours left.

Made it exactly as written and it was what pot roast dreams are made of!    Key is to have a beautiful piece of chuck with lots of fatty marbling.  Oh my goodness, this was like butter in my mouth!  I'm usually adamantly against using condensed soups or soup packets as flavoring but I had a packet of the onion soup left at my house from a party guest who made onion dip and I'm also adamant about not wasting food so I went online looking for something to do with it besides dip and found this recipe.    I may have to break my rule and keep these dry onion soup mixes on hand just for this!

A good basic, easy pot roast recipe. Prep was very simple - it probably took me less than 15 minutes to chop up all the veggies and sear the meat quickly. Per other recommendations, I added Worcestershire sauce, a couple bay leaves, and about 5-6 garlic cloves into the sauce. Threw all veggies (minus potatoes because I didn't want them getting mushy) and meat into the slow cooker on Low for 8 hours. Was perfectly cooked and fork tender! Served with rice and baked potatoes. I did find it to be a tad salty, so next time may decrease amount of salt used.

This was amazing! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I made some modifications to it. My husband said it was better than any restaurant he's had it at (he orders it a lot so this is saying a lot!). I did take advice from other reviewers & browned the roast in olive oil with 2 cloves of garlic then I added the roast & the pan drippings to the crock pot. I also used 2 cups of beef broth instead of water. About 2 hours before it was done I threw some fresh mushrooms in it. It was absolutely delicious & my husband & kids are requesting it again this week. Thank you!

Outstanding! My guests said it was a 10 out of 10!  Also used Montreal steak seasoning and flour/olive oil and  seared it first and threw  the vegetables in with three hours remaining.  Added a splash of Worteshire (sp?)  sauce and garlic powder. Perfect!

I received a brand new crock pot as a gift! Never used one before! This was my first time using it. The only thing that I did not do was brown the pot roast  in the skillet because I did not have time to do it in the morning before I went to work.  I prepared everything the night before. It came out perfect ! My family loved it and so did I .

Excellent! My husband doesn't care for the cream of mushroom type pot roast (but I do), so I searched for a new recipe to fulfill his taste buds. And this is "the one"! I spiced up the meat before browning and set it on low until it was PERFECT 9 hours in. I added my veggies in about 1/2 way through and thickened the gravy with flour at the end. We will definitely be making this again - indefinitely substituting my regular cream of mushroom version

Was good, but not great. Would put the vegetables in a bit later into the slow cooker process - they were too mushy. Flavor was fine, but a little bland. Next time I'll use more spices when searing the chuck roast and add lots of garlic cloves. Good foundational recipe and one I'd play with a couple times before inviting friends or family to partake.

Marie THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing your recipe and I must say the only word to describe it is; "FANTASTIC"!  Made it last night and it was an absolute hit.  

Took the advise of other reviewers & used beef broth instead of water, Worcestershire sauce.  Started with only by adding carrots, half way through the cooking time, added 3 whole onions and small white potatoes.  This recipe is so versatile that any favorite spice can be added to your liking.  Had the leftover meat this morning and it was yummy! 

Thanks again!

This is my go-to pot roast recipe.  Always perfect.  Only change I make is to add a little corn starch and water mixture at the end to thicken up the gravy - its delicious with noodles then.  Also, instead of adding water, I vary and use either wine, beer, or beef broth like the video says. YUM!

Cook roast w can of beef broth, onion soup mix and onion only. Do any sides separate. Biggest church was like 2.67 pounds. Not really enough for 5 adults. Just barely. Don't use slow cooker with rubber rimmed lid.

Excellent, except a bit greasy - maybe from the beef broth?  Next time I'll stick to the recipe and use water.

This is amazing! Super easy and requires minimal prep work and involves alot of groceries that most people have in "stock" regularly. I followed the rating that was most helpful (it was by lyrica42) and it turned out so well. I also only put the veggies in half way through the cooking time so they wouldnt be complete mush. YUM

Solid recipe.  It needed more flavor, for our tastes.  I threw in some red wine toward the end and some tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  Good!

4 stars due to my variations. I season it with Montreal steak seasoning and then brown it in a little olive oil. I use 2 beef bullion cubes with water and I add a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce.

we add 2 cans of golden mushroom soup and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the water.  we also use 2 envelopes of onion soup mix.  we don't use any salt because the soups have enough salt.  the gravy is delicious.

Very easy recipe that tasted great. The kids even liked it. I increased the water by about a cup for the gravy/sauce lovers in the family. I also increased the potatoes and carrots and there was still plenty of.flavor throughout.

Have cooked this several times for various people/occassions. It's a hit every time. I double the vegetables because they reduce in size when cooked. It's not needed, but the last time I cooked this I followed other reviewer's advice and rubbed the meat with McKormick's seasoning.

We just ate this for dinner and it was darn good!  I followed the recipe exactly (leaving out the celery) and it all came out perfect!  The only thing I might do differently next time I make it is to add a few more spices to the roast before browning it.  Other than that it's a keeper :)

I can always count on this recipe turning out! Cooking meat is hard for me since I'm a vegetarian and I'm not sure how things taste. I even followed the recipe using Seiten (a vegetarian meat substitute available at Whole Foods) and it was awesome!

I made this last night for my in laws and they loved it!  I didn't use the onion soup mix, instead, I put Adobo seasoning on the beef.  You couldn't taste it but maybe you would if you put alot on.   I also made separate gravy since the amount in the crock pot was minimal.  Would make again!

Was really good turned out very tender, I added a can of beef broth though. Also played with some extra spices, added some heat and garlic as well as some cajun spices. Excellent and was really good as left overs on a toasted bun.  also reccomend adding gravy!

LOVE this pot roast.  My husband says it is the best he's ever tasted.  The only thing I did differently was to quarter the onion instead of chop it, since neither of us are fans of chopped onion.

If you enjoyed this on the day of cooking, you'll love it as a leftover when the flavors have blended.  Just be sure to include additional vegetables during the initial cooking.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used the Montreal Steak Seasoning and 1 beef bouilon cube.

I let this cook for about 10 hours. IT was so yum!! I didn't add potatoes, I mashed some instead. The only extra thing I added was lots of fresh minced garlic and some garlic powder. I food processed the celery b/c it's not my favorite taste.

Loved this version of pot roast.  Easy and so tender.   Reminds me of my Mom's pot roast.  This is just good, old-fashioned cooking!

The pot roast turned out very tender and juicy. I minced 4 cloves of garlic and rubbed it with olive oil, oyster sauce and soy sauce before I cooked it. Even after all this my husband and company thought it lacked a little flavor. Next time I will try marinading it overnight. Otherwise it was very good.

I made this today for dinner and it's absolutly delicious. I followed the recipe for the most part. I did use beef broth instead of water and I omitted the onion soup mix because my mother doesn't like onions. I also made the broth at the end into a gravy. I also made noodle because that is how we usually eat our pot roast. Thanks for the great recipe!!

It's okay, but needed more spices.  I am definitely going to add Worcestershire (the one sauce barely anyone can pronounce without talking in slow motion), and even some hot sauce next time.  I think adding salt and pepper to the slow-cooker would have helped as well.  It came out a little bland.

I make this pot roast frequently and it always comes out PERFECT!  Chuck roast cut is VERY important, it comes out very tender.  I also add sliced fresh mushrooms. This is a keeper!

I thought this was a really good recipe, especially if you are making pot roast for the first time like me. I think this is a good starting point for me so I can play around with different spices, etc. Wasn't too happy with the vegetables, but you can definitely make the pot roast without them and make another side to go with it. I also made the juice into a gravy, but really it would have been delicious as is.

Delicious! The only things I did differently was to add beef broth to the water and also I cooked it on high for 5 hours instead of on low for longer. Finally, when it was done I made the broth/water mixture with all the flavorings after being cooked into a gravy using cornstarch.

Great recipe!  I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom.  I seasoned and browned the roast before putting it in the crock pot.  I added potatoes and carrots, onions and garlic.  YUMMY!

This is the first recipe that I have prepared from Allrecipes.com and My husband "loved" this meal. The only thing that I did differently with this recipe was leave out the celery. Great recipe!!!

Took the advice of adding some paprika, beef broth and mushrooms to mix.  Didn't add celery.  Very easy. very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

My mother in law liked it as did my husband and boys.  I put in 2 pkgs. onion soup so next time I will have to get the lower sodium as it was a tad salty for me. Quick cooked it for 4 hrs.

Slow cooking always turns out so good its hard to go wrong.  Mine turned out wonderful.  I only changed a few things.  I omitted the celery, added a few cloves of garlic, fresh mushrooms and a small can of golden mushroom soup.  It had so much flavor, and was so tender.  I will definitely making this dish again.

I added 3 cloves of garlic and used the beef bullion cubes (2) like someone else suggested and this potraost was awesome!! I can't cook at all, but this was the easiest thing ever, my boyfriend even said it was really good--we've been together 7-1/2yrs and I've never heard those words!! My 2-year-old even ate it and he is so picky. I will definetly make this over and over agian! :)

It was very tasty...very soft. We also put in the vegetables at the halfway mark and added flour to the final broth to make it thicker for some rice gravy. delicious!

The meat and vegetables were super tender. We were disappointed with the blandness of the meat, though. It would better with some sort of seasoning.

Excellent!!!!!! I did make some alternations. I did not use such a large roast so mine was a little smaller. I turned it on low about half way through the cooking time. I added the carrots and onion. I also added garlic but I did not add the potatoes. I made garlic mashed with it instead. The Carrots were amazing!!! My boyfriend Loved it! He ate all of it! I also added some extra seasoning but it was the best pot roast I've ever had. Easy too!!!

I read this recipe and thought I'd give it a try since so many people seemed to like it so well.  I don't like lots of onion, so I omitted the onion soup mix, but added the water with beef boullin instead.  I added minced onion, carrots, potatoes, and celery and the au jous did come out a little bland. I added additional salt and pepper and that seemed to help. The roast, however, was wonderful.  Will definitely make again!

Followed instructions. Easy and simple. I just don't think pot roast is my thing. My husband liked it very much. In my opinion it was good and better than restaurant quality, but just nothing to get crazy about.

First, let me say I have never been able to make pot roast. It is always tough no matter what cut of meat I use. This method did bring me closest to success. I used a boneless chuck pot roast and after 10 hours, still have to cut it with a knife, not nearly the fall apart on your fork consistency I've always envied. I also skipped the onion soup mix. I used a thyme, paprika rub then used vegetable broth plus onion slices and celery, harder veggies about half way through. Very flavorable, just tough.

Pretty good & tender. I used Organic beef broth in place of the water & made my own onion soup mix to cut some of the salt. It makes a very thin broth instead of gravy. The leftovers are even better.

I left out the celery but added a can of tomatoes instead. I needed about 4 cups of water to cover the roast and the gravy was still very flavorful. To save time, I didn't peel the potatoes or carrots.

This is exactly how I do my pot roast and it comes out perfect everytime! Just be sure to use a chuck roast. This is a perfect recipe for my child who is allergic to dairy and can't have the cream of mushroom soup. I use the liquid left over to make a wonderful gravy.

This was good.  I used new potatoes as others suggested.  I used beef granules, a can of beef broth, with a little extra water because it was going to cook (unsupervised) for 10+ hours.  I put the vegetables (I omitted carrots - personal preference,an added whole button mushrooms) on top of the meat and they did not turn out mushy.  I used the extra fluid in slow cooker to make a gravy which we put over the potatoes.  Turned out nicely.

I used this recipe mainly because it didn't have a lot of artificial ingredients (canned soup etc.)  I floured and seasoned the roast and seared it, then I sauteed the onions, garlic, deglazed the pan with red wine. I added carrots to the slow cooker and only used 1/2 of the onion soup mix....I don't like anything too salty. The meat fell apart, I thickened the gravy but it was somewhat bland and I try to kick it up with worcestire, needs some more work though.

I just got done having this for dinner.  I used a 2.75 lb chuck roast and set the cooker for 8 hours on low.  By 6 hours it was definitely done, the meat was tender and falling apart.  I followed the tips to add the vegs half way through.  I floured and browned the meat first and even then the gravy was more au jus than gravy.  The recipe is quite good but needs a kick or two to give the flavor more depth, ie garlic, red wine, etc.  I'll experiment with that next time!

Tender and Delicious! This was my 2nd attempt at Pot Roast and it's a keeper! I browned the meat in olive oil/onion/garlic first. I also cut my meat up beforehand. I used a 3 pound roast. During the last hour I added a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken the gravy. (had no flour to thicken)I used 2 cups of water and added 2 boullion cubes since we love gravy. Very Very Good!

I cooked this yesterday and it smelled delicious. However, I wasn't so crazy about the taste. I don't know if it was the beef chuck I used, but there was way too much oil! My husband was the only one that ate it. I will probably not try this again unless he requests for it.

This was very good but I had to cook it an additional 8 hours after cooking it all day on low - I also thickened the gravy which was very liquidy, with some flour and broke apart the meat into smaller pieces, getting rid of a lot of the fat from the chuck roast.

This was very yummy.  First time making a pot roast in a slow cooker and it turned out pretty good.  I had a 2.67 lb roast, and I cooked it for high 1 hour, then low for 7 hours.  I will cook it less next time as it dried out a bit.  It was still delicious though!  Added some garlic and worshtershire sauce to the onion soup mix.

Have been making this recipe for years, and it's always delicious.  Easy to change it a little to suit your family... like sometimes instead of potatoes, I substitute noodles and add them during the last 30 min.  I like the idea of a previous reviewer about thickening the gravy and serving it over mashed potatoes.

Very good, very easy.  Didn't have any celery, so omitted it.  Also left out the potatoes, and instead thickened the gravy with cornstarch before serving it over mashed potatoes.  Yummy!!!

This was delicious. I did like the other reviews said and browned it in beef broth. I also used 1 cup of beef broth and 1/4 worcester sauce and the Montreal Steak Seasoning.  I cut up some slits into the roast and put in some minced garlic as well.  Thanks for the recipe.

Used a 2.5 lb pot roast so cut the ingredients in half except for the cooking time which was 9 hrs.  browned the meat with montreal steak seasoning.  added everything in the crock pot along with about 1.5 tbsp worc sauce.  salted and pepper to taste while cooking.  end result was very tasty and the meat was very soft and falling apart.  def a keeper.

This pot roast was delicious!  The only ingredient I changed was replacing beef broth for the water.  Other than that, everything else went into the slow cooker and 8 hours later for our 3 pound roast, we were enjoying a delicious dinner!  Thanks for the recipe, I will make again and again!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I seasoned the roast with Montreal steak seasoning before I seared it, and used beef broth instead of water.  I also added a package of fresh mushrooms.  I added all of my veggies at the very beginning even though some suggested to do it halfway through cooking time.  They came out perfect!  I like my veggies very soft when I'm eating them with roast.  I used a 3-lb roast and let it cook on low for almost 9 hours.  It was probably ready at 8 hours but we weren't home yet to turn off slow cooker!  I will make this again and again!!

This was pretty good, the meat was really tender  and the veggies nice but I wish it had more flavor, next time I think I will throw in a beer and leave out the water.

My roast turned out kind of dry and the potatoes were not cooked.  I cooked it all on low for 9 hours. Not sure what I did wrong.

This was good,my picky eaters wont eat "mixed" food so I didnt add the carrots and potato. I made mashed potatoes and broccoli separately. I used beef broth instead of water, dredged roast in flour before searing with 2 cloves garlic. I also used a pkt of brown gravy mix because i didnt have onion soup.

This roast was ok.  I added the veg during the last 2 hours of cooking on high so they wouldn't get soggy.  Just a little bland.

Very tasty.  I used beef broth instead of just water. I also seasoned it with salt, pepper and granulated garlic powder.  I didn't chop the celery or the onion, instead I sliced them and quartered them.

This is absolutley the best pot roast we've ever had! The only things I did different was to use more hot water (3 cups) and disolved 4 beef bouillon cubes in the water before adding to the pot. Very flavorful and with the extra water there was plenty sauce to make gravy with.

This provided a good base for making pot roast. I used all of the ingredients, but made some changes. The onion soup mix was too salty and I don't like dehydrated onions anyway, so I actually ended up spooning as much of them as I could out before adding vegetables.  Also, I happened to come home a couple hours before dinner and added the carrots, celery, and potatoes at that time. They cooked with the roast for 2 hours on HIGH and were perfect! I was afraid they would be too soft if left in all day. The roast was really good and everyone enjoyed it.

This is by far the best pot roast I have ever had.  My husband loves it and we had company over last month and they loved it too.  There were a few things I did a bit different.  I added a glass of red wine and omitted all the veggies except the onions because I wanted the flavor of them.

I am making this again this weekend and I can't wait to have it!

This was great!
I added a bit of red wine and some beef broth and seasoned the beef with Montreal seasoning.  I like lots of onions so i doubled them.
My wife had two servings!

This recipe is great as is, but you can also add button or crimini mushrooms for the last hour of cooking, if you like them. I usually added extra veggies as well, as I LOVE pot roast carrots.

Meat came out really soft and fork tender. Sauce was really tasty too. There was alot of oil from the meat that was easy to drain off the top. Other than that this was a good tasty dinner.

I only have 3.5 lb cut of pot roast meat. I cooked it with only 1 can of soup, the whole amount of onion soup and a can full of chicken broth. I brown the beef seasoned with flour and pepper, still the sauce wont thickened. Maybe i should try to mix it with cornstarch. From the look of it i know its going to be a good meal. Thank you!

I was excited to make this after all the great reviews. Maybe my husband and I just aren't pot roast people, but we thought it was just so-so. The meat was definitely tender, but the flavor didn't wow us. I've never had great success with slow cooking. The food always seems kind of tired and soggy to me. I must be doing something wrong because everyone else seems to love it.

Pot roast came out very tender. I was worried about having the potatoes in there the whole 10 hours, but they came out great with great flavor. Thank you for sharing.

Yummy!  Used a smaller roast- approx 2.5 lbs, and left out the celery (I conveniently "forgot" to buy it).  Turned out delicious.

Very good, I used the Montreal seasoning and Lipton soup mix. It ended up being quite salty, I think next time I will reduce the seasoning.

This pot roast was amazing!! I took other's suggestions and I rubbed mesquite seasoning onto 1 side and garlic powder on the other side before browning. I also added 1 cup of water in addition to the beef broth. My husband loved this so much he ate most of it that night. It was so tender you only needed a fork. Great recipe!!

Other than adding lots of garlic, we didn't change the recipe.  Thought it was very good, but the flavor was a bit bland.

This was great!  I could not find the onion mix, so I used pot roast seasoning and it was a little on the salty side, so I think I will just stick with my own seasonings next time.  Overall, it was great and was falling apart!  Perfect!

My husband and I couldn't get enough of this dish.  I was leary that the vegetables would get soggy or overdone but they came out very succulent and tasty.  This recipe is a must.  Not sure why you have to brown befor putting in the slow cooker though.

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is so YUMMY!!  So easy to make too.  I let this cook for 11 hours.  The Roast just fell apart.  Great meal to make when you know there is no time to make a good meal when you get home.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Recipe was very easy and quick to prepare.  I purchase pre sliced carrots to save a step.  Also, should have cut the potatoes into quarters.  I like them very soft.  Added sliced mushrooms and fresh chopped garlic.  We really enjoyed this!

I'm sick, and can't taste much, so I added lots of extra seasoning.  But the texture is great.

Very good and very easy!  Especially great to prep all the veggies the day before and easy to finish in the morning.  I added lots of extra carrots and potatoes and made it a one pot meal.

The 5 star rating for this recipe wasn't kidding!  SO GOOD.  My boyfriend was thrilled that I actually made something so "meat & potatoes," and we both really enjoyed it.  I used what was labelled as a chuck roast at my store, instead of what they deemed a pot roast.  That is the only change! :)

This roast had really good flavor! I was a little surprised when I checked it after cooking only 5 hours that it was well past done. The meat fell off the bone, so it was impossible to cut. Also, the potatoes and carrots had a bit of an overdone taste,though it still had good flavor overall. I guess my crock pot must cook hot! Thanks for the recipe though; I'll have to try this one again!

My husband loves potroast and I had just gotten a slow cooker.  It was great!  I was so happy to find a recipe that did not require creamed soup because I can't have gluten, a protein found in flour, which makes cooking difficult.  I will definitely use this recipe often.

We really loved this roast but I did alter a little:) I never browned it which next time I may do. I forgot the onion but with the onion soup mix it wasn't a big deal. I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup. It gives it just a little bit more YUM! Anyway all in all I love any slow cooked roast but this is good and no tomatoes (my husband doesn't like them).

Pretty good recipe. Definitely easy to make. I added beef broth and garlic, but I think I will omit the latter next time. The roast was falling apart when I took it out. Everyone had seconds!

What a great crock pot meal to find ready to serve after a day at work!  I was short on time so did not brown meat and the roast was still delicious.  I drained off some of the broth and used milk and cornstarch to make a quick gravy.

The potroast was really good! I added some mushrooms and left out the potatoes. It could have had a little more flavor. Next time I will add more salt to the meat.

UPDATE: I just made this again with adjustments and its great. I added sliced jalapenos, extra salt, mushrooms, and a teaspoon of crushed red peppers. MUCH BETTER this time!

Great!  I used beef broth on the advise of other reviewers and cooked potatoes seperately.  It was tender and yummy, I used a 2.75 lb. roast and it was plenty for us.  I strained out the veggies when it was all done and thickened the broth/juices on the stove with corn starch and a little Gravy Master to make the gravy .  Thanks!!!

This was an excellent dish! I followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted the water for a can of beef broth. Turned out delicious!

I didn't particularly care for this one.  Maybe it had something to do with the cut of meat I used, really grisly and tough.   But I wasn't crazy about the taste either.  Won't make again.

Great! My husband loves pot roast so we are forever in search of perfection.  This was very close.  I substituted beer for water and omitted the potatoes, with wonderful results. Thanks Marie.

Very easy and very tasty - I did add some garlic and used beef broth instead of water.  This one is a keeper!

I just made this recipe, and it was excellent.  I added a little garlic and a can of Cream of Mushroom soup.  But it was still VERY GOOD.
