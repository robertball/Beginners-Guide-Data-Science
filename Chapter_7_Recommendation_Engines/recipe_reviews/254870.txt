I make this all the time it's called chofan... I've never used Mexican rice nor have I ever put beans in it.. This is our version of fried rice... Also we don't use sofrito that is a Puerto Rican seasoning we use recaito (mix of cubanelle peppers, garlic, cilantro, white onions, green peppers, and sometimes I add parsley)
