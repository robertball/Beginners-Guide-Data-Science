to the first reviewer - NO! LOL ... Almond paste is a mixture of almonds and SUGAR ... Almond butter is ground almonds.
The soup should not have been that sweet.(I have not made this recipe -- but wanted to respond to the original reviewer ... looks like a good recipe, though)

This was a very rich, sweet soup. I'm not entirely sure I made it right, so I wish I could review it without rating it; I used almond paste and I'm not sure if that's the same thing as almond butter. Regardless, it came out pretty good. I don't think I'll make this again before winter, and I'll probably wait until we have guests over because this was a tad extravagant for just two people and the leftovers were just odd to me.
