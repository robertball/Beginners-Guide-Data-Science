I used Rice Krispies for this, and they turned out great!  It was so much easier than using the corn syrup version I've seen other places. I also melted 1 cup of chocolate chips for 'icing'. I would probably use 1.5 cups next time.  Very quick, easy, and delicious!

I made these with Honey Nut Cheerios.  They were good but my husband, kids, and I liked the No Bake Cereal Cookies from this site better.  When using Cheerios these were a little too gooey for our taste.  I have made this recipe with Rice Krispies and frosted with melted chocolate and butterscotch chips and they were very good.

I generously sprayed the bowl with cooking spray before I put anything in it. It made clean up a breeze. These are delicious!

A 71/2x12 inch pan gave me thicker bars, which I prefer. This recepie is great for stale, leftover boxes of unused cereal!  Unfortuantely, cleaning the bowl and utensils is a pain in the sink, but well worth it! lol

This is a good healthy snack to make to bring to work, except my husband ate most of them on the weekend.

Yummy cross between two traditional favorites.  A little more flavor than Rice Krispie bars, but peanut butter flavoring is not as overpowering as Special K bars.  Can substitute corn flake style cereal for the oat cereal.  Kids love a cup or two of m&m's tossed in for a little chocolate flavor and some added color.

I'm not crazy about the peanut butter. It sort of took away from the sweetness of the snack. I made them both with and without the peanut butter and the one's without were definitely better, but still not as good as rice crispy treats. (just proves again, you can't beat the real thing!)

Truly outstanding!  I was having chocolate cravings, and all we had was a stale bag of Coco Puffs.  I used that plus a little less peanut butter and a bag of mini marshmallows.  Heaven.  The II recipe is fine, but I found that the spatula is a lot easier to use than a spoon.  Be sure to have some milk nearby!

Used cornflakes & added honey to make them sweeter...not as good as some butterscotch/peanut butter rice krispy treats I've been looking for the recipe for, but these are pretty darn good!

I am addicted to this stuff! I always use cheerios but I'm sure just about any cereal would be great in this.  I put the butter and marshmallows in a plastic bowl in the microwave and it comes right out! No mess! The spoon is a little sticky but that's it. I have tried this with M & M's in it but I prefer it without.

Much better than Rice Krispy treats.  Good way to use up Cheerios that are getting stale because I bought too many on sale!  We mixed in M&Ms, too--yum!

These are quick and easy.  I used Lucky Charms so they were especially sweet, but the peanut butter cuts through that a bit.  Yummy!

Perfect cookie bars for a fast dessert!  You can melt a bag of milk chocolate chips and spread on top.  Great for pot-luck dinners or kids groups.
