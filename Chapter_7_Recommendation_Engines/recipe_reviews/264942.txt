This is the second time I am reviewing it b/c don't know if the other one took. However, this is an excellent recipe. Very tasty. Will make it often. Only change I made was to brown chops in frying pan then baked at 350 for about 20 minutes as my grill was out of commission.

Baking or grilling pork chops that have marinated several hours in Hidden Valley Ranch dressing was great--but the sweet/savory Peach Jalapeno Salsa greatly complimented the chops; had just a kiss of jalapeno heat, which I set to my liking. And that's the key: Blending those salsa ingredients just to your own tastes and liking.  This recipe gem is an excellent Summer pork chop dinner treat. My wife is my toughest food critic--and even she raved how good I made this!!
