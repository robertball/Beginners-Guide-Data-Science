I infuse coconut oil with medical marijuana then bake with it. This is a yummy and easy recipe for coconut oil. I can eat 2 cookies at bedtime and it helps me stay asleep

I'm a bit of a cookie snob, and the cookies were awesome!  First batch came out perfect.  I used raw sugar buy almost melting the butter/coconut and mixing in the sugar. Let it sit hot for like five mins most, then mix in yokes and vanilla.  Kinda looked like soft caramel and mixed nicely into a wet sandy dough.  I was a bit worried but it held its form while i rolled some into a raw sugar/cinnamon mix.  Like a shortcake cookie.

These are very tasty. I'm trying to find more recipes using coconut oil. My husband doesn't like the taste of coconut oil in some foods but I think it is disguised in these cookies, although i did roll them in cinnamon sugar. None the less, they are delicious, enjoying one right now .

I also used cannabis infused coconut oil and they’re delicious. Baffled as to how big your walnuts are. I ended up with 32 cookies. Actually 33 but I ate the batter for the last one.

I made 18 walnut(still in shell is what I pictured) sized balls  and after 12 minutes they  were still semi cookie dough texture in the middle. Very delicious though. I had read that they were super moist in another review,  so hoping it’s cook thru!  My family has already enjoyed more than half of them hahaha & coconut oil gives great flavor !

Super light and fluffy! Now,  I ran out of white sugar so in the end I wound up using only about 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar, which has made it a little extra sweet. Also I used salted butter rather than unsalted. Since it didn’t specify in the recipe, I assumed that was fine— And it was!

Will definitely make again. These are rich and decadent cookies. I’m usually a shortbread girl using all butter. But this half and half ratio with virgin organic unrefined coconut oil and butter is a big difference to me! Smells great and tastes yummy! So now I’m going to dip them in some shiny royal icing!

For some reason mine had a slight flavor of burnt egg. Still pretty good though and a great flavor.

We used 1/2 wheat flour and kerrygold grass fed cow butter which has way more flavor than basic butter in my opinion.  These cookies are really good!! Some sugar cookies are kind of boring.  These had extra level yumminess.  I think the coconut oil brings out more butter flavor!  It wasn't coconutty at all.  They were absolutely delicious.  I think this is my go to sugar cookie recipe now.  The dough is crumbly though so don't expect to easily roll it out for cutter cookies though we made it work for fun shapes.

Turned out nice and tender.  I rolled half in cinnamon sugar and the other half in lavender sugar.  These would be good for a tea party.
