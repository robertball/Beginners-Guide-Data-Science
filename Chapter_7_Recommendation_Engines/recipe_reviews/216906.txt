My mom started making this recipe in the early '90's. It is really good. However, save yourself some trouble and use shredded cheese.  Using real cheese bumps it up to 5 stars. Also, you won't need the extra liquid. Extra liquid keeps it from "setting up" and makes it too loose to be like stuffing/dressing.
