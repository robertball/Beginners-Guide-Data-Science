Great recipe! I needed a crab cake recipe that didn't require crackers as I didn't have any on hand, and this one worked well. For someone who has never made crab cakes before, this was quick and easy to follow. I did not have any parsley or baking powder available but they still turned out well. Thanks.

The last minute, My MIL. Wanted to do 7 fishes for Christmas Eve, so I was assigned crab cakes & clam dip ... I found this recipe and everyone raved ... My husband said they were just like the ones he had down at the Harbor.  They were so good I was asked to make them for New Year's Eve ... MIL never got one at Christmas and was thrilled ... This will be made again & again ... Only change I made was that I used a medium scoop to create, see picture, because they were an appetizer

I didn't like this recipe. I don't know if it was because of the type of crab I used but the texture was off and it was a tad too spicy to be considered a crab cake to me. And also not enough bread to hold them together. Plenty of flavor, but not a crab cake-ey like flavor.
