Delicious!  I added cherry tomatoes (since I had some on hand) and extra garlic (since we love garlic.)  This would be great at a BBQ or potluck.  Yum!

This was a perfect summer dinner on a very hot day! We served with cheesy garlic bread and was very satisfying. The dressing was amazing! The only change I made was to add a lot more bacon because I  that would not be enough for my bacon loving husband! Great recipe thanks!

Got fresh Fiddleheads yesterday from market and made this salad for lunch. It was marvellous. I wouldn't change a thing. My husband did add a bit of salt to his.
