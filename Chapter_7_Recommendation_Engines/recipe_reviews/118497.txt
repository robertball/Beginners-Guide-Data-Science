Whoaaa! This was awesomee!  I changed the recipe according to another member's review: I used 1 can of evaporated fat free milk (this cuts the calories SIGNIFICANTLY), 2/3 cup Splenda, 3/4 cup of egg whites (not egg substitute).  I also made my own pie crust with 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs and 4tbsp fat free plain yogurt.  I  only needed 1/2 of the filling (I froze the rest); This averaged about 110 calories per 1/8th of the pie!!

Made this for my diabetic dad by substituting fat free evaporated milk (instead of sweetened condensed) plus 2/3 cup of Splenda and 1/4 cup more egg substitute. It came out perfectly and I could NOT tell it wasn't regular pumpkin pie!

Awesome! My husband raved that this was the best pumpkin pie he'd ever had.  I substituted 2 eggs for the egg substitute and used a low-fat prepared graham cracker crust.  I'm sure I'll make this one again!

I love pumpkin pie - I can't have sugar and I eat a low fat diet.....so what's a girl to do!  I too substitued the milk for low fat canned milk and added splenda and I bake it with out a crust - like a custard......it is dreamy and healthy and takes even better!

Yum! I used a can of fat free unsweetened milk...2/3 cup of sugar and 4 egg whites. I also added a tbsp of corn starch to make it thicker...I also baked it without crust...I dont care for crust. I baked it at 350 and left it in the fridge for a day. It turned out awesome!

This pie came out perfectly.  This was the first pie I have ever baked and it couldn't have been easier or more delicious.

i didnt have egg substitute, so i used 4 egg whites instead. the consistency was a bit quiche-like and not as smooth as regular pumpkin pie, and a graham crust would be better than a pie shell. but overall, good for low fat!

edit: after chilling for a day, this was much better than the first day. it was better than the store pies, even!

Delicious with none of the guilt!  There's nothing like pumpkin pie after a Thanksgiving meal and this low-fat version definitely delivers on taste so much so that you'd never suspect it was a lighter version! (it even fooled my husband - LOL) I took the advice of others and lightened it up even more by using fat free evaporated milk and 2/3 cup of Splenda.  I also opted to use 1 & 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice vs. three spices. Since I didn't have any egg substitute, I used 2 eggs. I did have to bake this longer than 30 minutes at 350, more like 45 minutes.  It was perfect topped with light whipped cream!

So easy & so good. I've made it twice now & it seems like there's no way to mess it up. I made it a tiny bit different today because of the ingredients I had in the house. I used 1 can of low-fat unsweetened condensed milk, 3/4 cup eggbeaters, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp garam masala, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1 can pumpkin, and 2 packets of truvia... I put all the ingredients in the blender to combine, and then poured into a glass pie dish. I didn't even bother with a pie crust, so now it's low-carb too.

I am rating the modified version where people said to use evaporated milk, egg whites and splenda, well I used truvia  one egg, graham cracker crust and two egg whites. It turned out custardy and left an after taste with the sweetner. My husband took one bite and gave it back to me. i thinks its ok not too bad, but beware you can definitely tell its a lowfat low cal pie.

I just made this recipe both as directed and as mms09 changed. The one by mms09 with the non fat evaporated milk turned out well but overflowed the pie crust. I scooped out the overflow and put it in a shallow dish sprayed with PAM for baking and stuck it in the oven with the pies. It gave me a wonderful little mini size tart without the fat of the pie crust. Both pies look and smell delicious and I am sure my kids will agree once they get to try a piece. The original recipe took a little longer to bake but that could be because it had slightly more filling than the second pie. I can't wait to serve these pies at our family thanksgiving and snicker at all of those who cringe at my low fat low cal cooking. They will never know the difference

Very tasty.  Impossible to tell that it was low fat.  The spices were a little intense.

I have made this every year since I found it on this website. You can't tell it's low fat at all. Just need to figure out a low fat pie crust.

So simple to make and yummy scrumptious!  It's the first fall dessert I've made this year, and it really got us in the spirit.  My husband said that it may be the best pumpkin pie he had ever tasted in his life!  I didn't want to tell him that it is low-fat and only took five minutes to whip up!  I used all organic ingredients because they're healthier, higher quality, and taste better.  I also just used canned pumpkin pie mix from Whole Foods because I had it.  It's just the same as canned pumpkin with the spices already added.  I added a dash more spices, though.  I just love autumn flavors!
