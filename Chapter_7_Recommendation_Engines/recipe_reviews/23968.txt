This was good, but I felt that it was missing something. Therefore, I seasoned and sauted my shrimp in a skillet instead of boiling them. Afterwards,I did place them in the bowl of butter for 15 minutes. I used fresh garlic and mushrooms. I sauted the garlic, onions, and mushrooms togehter. I used penne pasta instead of angel hair. All and all it was good, but next time I think I'll try making homemade alfredo sauce. But I will keep this recipe. ** Also, this was very quick and easy, which is a plus.

This is an easy and great recipe.  My family loved it.  Soaking the shrimp in butter made it better.  I actually added a little bit of garlic powder to the butter, we love garlic!  Thanks!!!

I came up with a very similar recipe to this on my own and I make it at least once a month - whenever I can get shrimp on sale. I use pre-cooked frozen baby shrimp, though, which makes preparation easier. Also, try red bell pepper instead of green for a slightly different flavor. Sometimes I add chopped roma tomatoes or sundried tomatoes, or frozen peas and shredded carrots. It turns out different, but delicious, every time. And people at work always think my leftovers look better than their lunch!

The jarred Alfredo Sauce turned me off immediately.  Green bell peppers and shrimp do not go together.  And cumin??  I would omit all three, use a refrigerated Alfredo (like Butoni) and use a red bell pepper.  And FRESH GARLIC IS A MUST.

This was fantastic.  I made a very quick and easy version.  I used precooked shrimp and refrigerated linguine.  I also took frozen green pepper, red pepper and onion mix and threw it into my mini chopper.  Oh and I only used a 1/4 cup of butter and it was more than enough.

While I did make some changes, I think is a great recipe. I halved it just because I was the only one eating dinner tonight. I also cut the butter waayyy down to about 3 1/2 Tbs. and it was plenty. I really like the idea of marinating the shrimp in the butter though, I just couldn't bring myself to use that much. I also omitted the onions and green pepper, but added a half pound of mushrooms that I sauteed in a bit of olive oil first. After sauteeing the mushrooms, I added the shrimp and alfredo sauce to the pan and let that all simmer together while the pasta cooked. I also threw in some dried parsley. Finally, I'm sorry but I just could not bring myself to put cumin in this. I just didn't think it would fit my tastes. Thanks :)

i thought the recipe and dish were great, we embellished just a bit when we doubled it to handle the table-load and instead of doubling shrimp we added two lbs of bay scallops, it was very well received.  Our next alteration will include broccoli and mushrooms.  Thank u for a great dish.  It was easy and great just as presented....jeff n robin in alabama

Not bad at all.  I was hesitant to add extras, but next time I will.  Although it was full of flavor.  My hubby liked it too.

okay, so, first off: marinating your shrimp in butter? that's disgusting. you do not need the extra fat from butter to make this dish taste delicious. so i skipped that step entirely, & instead i sauteed them with 2 tbsp of butter, garlic, & a my own combination of fresh herbs from my personal garden. & instead of cumin, i used cayenne, & since we didn't have green bell pepper, i used asparagus. & i made my own alfredo. a very, very basic dish, brought together with little creativity. overall, a 2 star dish. it's nothing special until you add your own twist to it, which i did & it was yuuummy.

It is good but you can make homade sauce with butter, heavy whipping cream and a little fresh cracked pepper. I put cream cheese in mine too. I did my versionof sauce with everything else the same and it was awesome.

my VEGGIE VERSION....I made this during lent so didn't want to use the shrimp so I did some modifying. I used fresh broccoli and canned mushrooms and topped with sliced black olives to add some color. I used small shells for the pasta. It came out soooooo good and very quick and easy. thanks for the recipe, its a keeper!

Really good! I didn't have any cheese product though, so I substituted with shredded cheese and some cayenne powder, with about 1/3 cup milk. Not sure if or how that would alter the recipe, but we all gobbled it up. the quality of the shrimp, as usual, probably determines how good this turns out. I used uncooked large frozen shrimp from Trader Joes - not tough or anything when served.

I got a good deal on shrimp ( BOGO) !! and needed a good recipe. Well, I found it in this recipe! First I heated up some oil and added a stick of butter. I sauteed 1 chopped onion and 4 or 5 garlic cloves minced, till soft. My kids are not fond of peppers so I left them out and saved them for the salad. I added the sauce and brought it up to a boil. I used 2 jars of sauce and about 3 jars of water since I added the pasta uncooked and cooked it in the sauce to get flavor into the pasta W/O the whole boiling pasta  in water thing, Worked liked a charm. When the pasta was almost al dente, I added the shrimp and finished cooking till everyone in the pool was nice and happy. I grated some fresh Parmesan cheese, made a green salad and whipped up some home made garlic butter and smeared it on toasted french bread. This was one Fine Sunday meal my family ENJOYED!! Thank You Lissa

I prepared this recipe for my husband and myself.  My husband loved it.  I cut way back on the butter, sauteed the pepper and onion in olive oil.  Like others I couldn't make myself use the cumin.  I also didn't use the garlic powder, because my Alfredo was roasted garlic flavor.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so used half a can of sliced.  I will make this again in the future.  Will also make it for guests.

I've made this several times with angel hair pasta.  It is absolutely delicious.  Be sure you don't cook the pasta more than a couple of minutes if you do use angel hair.  I think you could use a heavier pasta and it would be very good.  I make this one at least twice a month.

I don't think I'd made this recipe again. I found the flavor of cumin (which makes me think of Mexican food) odd with the creamy alfredo sauce. It just didn't go. On a recipe card the dish looks great, and I did find it quite easy to make, but the flavors didn't work for me.

I made this tonight with the Quick & easy alfredo sauce.  I made this sauce first then added half pound cooked medium shrimp.  Let it stand for 15 minutes then cooked up some fettuccine pasta.  Then added the pasta to sauce with shrimp reheat about 5 minutes.  YUMMY!  I did not soak shrimp in butter I put it in the sauce I made and it was great.  My Boyfriend had 2 servings.  No veggies this time.

This was good, but not good enough to compensate for all the calories in this dish.  The amount of butter called for, in my opinion, is WAY too much.  1/2 a cup is plenty, it just all gets thrown out anyways.  What a waste.  It was also a weird dish to make, I had dishes, pots/pans everywhere, wasn't worth the effort for me.

This was much better than I anticipated as I swore I'd never buy jarred alfredo again!  Classico Four Cheese is actually REALLY good!  

I altered the recipe in the following way:
Used Linguine instead of Angel Hair
1 Stick of butter melted with juice of 1/2 lemon
Cut the shrimp into bite size pieces prior to cooking
Used 1 1/2 TBSP fresh garlic
Topped with fresh grated cheese

This was a very tasty dish and my boyfriend and I loved it! It was not as easy as it says to make though, although I started cooking it at one in the mornng, so that effect my review.  I really loved adding the bell pepper and red onion, really gave it a nice crunchy addition, as did the garlic powder...I used garlic salt instead.  Also, I added Truffle Salt to the sauce, and seal salt and cracked pepper, to give it an extra kick.  Also, I marinated the shrimp in Shrimp Seasining, for extra flavor.  I'm Italian...I'm all into the seasonings.  We used spaghetti instead of Angel Hair Pasta, but I think Angel Hair pasta is probably a better choice.  Our only complaint was that the pasta was a bit dry and there did not seem to be enough sauce?  Maybe another half a jar, would have made it extra flavorful, but that might be due to the fact that the cooked pasta sat out for a while, wating for the other ingredients and that I used spaghetti, rather than angel hair pasta.  Definitely add Truffle Salt...it's my number one favorite seasoning in any kind of sauce...expensive but sooooo worth it!

This was fantastic but I did tweek the recipe a bit. I seasoned and steamed the shrimp (sazon and adobe pinch of curry) while the pasta boiled and then sauteed them in a garlic butter sauce (minced garlic and melted butter). I poured in the pasta and then added about half a jar of the lite classico alfredo sauce. The mixture turned the sauce a nice yellow color and smelled fantastic!  My bf cleaned his plate and asked for more!

I used a 2 lb bag of frozen shrimp. Boiled in water til just cooked then strained. As a reviewer mentioned there were a lot of dishes, I managed to avoid that. After removing shrimp from pot I boiled them in, I melted about 1/4 c butter. I added shrimp to it and stirred to coat. I then placed buttered shrimp back into strainer to sit. I sauteed minced garlic and sliced mushroom in the now buttered pot. Once that was done I added the bottled 3 cheese Alfredo sauce. Heated on medium then added shrimp back to pot and continued to heat. Added chopped green onion at this point. Cooked pasta in mean time and voila! Yummy meal! I omitted cumin as well as green pepper.

I made this last night and only thing I changed is that I added 1/2 lb. of bay scallops to it. This was delicious and my husband couldn't get enough. He said it was better than Outback's shrimp pasta and he LOVES Outback.

This was pretty good but as stated by previous raters it was fairly bland. Next time we will definitly spice it up a bit perhaps with fresh garlic, basil, and using a different Alfredo sauce.

Overall its simple, easy, and not bad!

As written, this was pretty bland. I ended up adding some grated Parmesan and extra-sharp Cheddar cheese, and some fresh basil. This improved it alot. Thanks.

Very tasty and easy to make.  The only change I made was to add some diced chicken breast to the pan while cooking the peppers and onions.  Will definitely make again!

I liked this recipe, it was easy and my family loved it. Of course I tweaked mine a bit according to my family's taste. First I cooked my shrimp in bay seasoning with a touch of cayenne pepper. After the shrimp was done and I shelled them, then I set them aside. Next I sauteed onions, garlic, and red and yellow peppers in butter(about 1/4 of a stick) until soft( we like red and orange better than green peppers). I then added the Alfredo sauce ( I used Ragu's Roasted Parmesan Garlic Sauce)I seasoned with dried basil and oregano. I then added some frozen peas to make it a more rounded meal. I let all of these things simmer for about10-15 minutes. While I was making this I put my linguine on to boil. After following the directions on the package I drained it and returned it to the pot. I added my shrimp mixture to the linguine and mixed it together well. My family were literally licking their plates, they enjoyed it so much. Thanks for the basic recipe Lissa, every cook has to fine tune this to their own tastes but the basic recipe is a winner!

I made this recipe as-is except for the use of fresh garlic in place of powder.  It is excellent!  I'm a shrimp lover and had my doubts about the green pepper and cumin, but they are great in this dish.  Try it before you change it!!

Awesome recipe for the novice cook. 21 yr old college male away from home here, and a half decent home cooked meal goes quite far. Thanks for the recipe! I put garlic in my onions/peppers.. added a little bit of flavor. I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter to soak the shrimp in too.

this is a very basic recipe that anyone can do and not mess up...its pre made sauce!
I did make some changes..I added fresh mushrooms and crabmeat...
i did NOT boil the shrimp...lol WHY boil them THEN add to a sauce, it just over cooks them no matter how long  you marinate them in butter. 
Either add them in the sauce directly (to infuse flavor) or sautee them with FRESH garlic and butter.

Actually love this recipe but please don't boil the shrimp without shrimp boil....I season (tony's) and saute them after the onion, bp and garlic is sauteed.  Really liked the addition of  all but the cumin!

It was very easy and delicious! I used precooked shrimp, to save time, I saved a little pasta water and added it to the dish, since I only made half a recipe. Turned out good!!  My husband said it is a keeper!!

Was hesitant about the cumin, but tried it. Turned out great.  I did add extra garlic powder.

This was delicious. Had to sub chicken for the shrimp since the hubby doesn't like seafood and just cooked it with the peppers and onions. Tastes great but doesn't make the best leftovers. Can't wait to try it with the shrimp when the hubby isn't home.

I would make this again. I did a few adaptions like making my own Alfredo sauce. I always try to do home made, from scratch. I don't buy sauces generally.

I made a simple white sauce, add grated parmesano reggiano, a few red pepper flakes. Seasoned the shrimp with salt and pepper, sautéed in a bit of olive oil and added the sauce. NO cumin, doesn't go well at all. No green pepper either. Too strong a flavor. You could use diced, roasted red pepper if you wanted color and a bit of sweetness.

This turned out very good! I too did not boil the shrimp. I cooked the shrimp in butter and garlic.

I just finished making this for dinner tonight. my husband seemed to really enjoy it. I did use a few of the other reviewers suggestions. I did did soak the shrimp on butter and added seafood seasoning to the meted butter for extra flavor. I also sliced tomatoes to add to the mix and it was a great enhancer. I will make this again but think I will use homemade sauce instead of the jar. all together it was a wonderful dish.

I added chopped spinach because Ilike spinach. I agree that allowing the shrimp to sit in the butter added flavor. I've always ordered this dish at a restaurant because I never could make it as delicious as the chef could. 
  Now I can!

I did this recipe pretty much as directed. I used a bag of pre cooked shrimp and marinaded them in less butter maybe 3T. a t. of raw garlic and the cumin. Added to Classico alfredo sauce and linguini. My boyfriend's birthday dinner and he loved it. I didn't add peppers and onions but served brussel sprouts because he likes them best.  Very easy and a crowd pleaser. Do add the cumin, it gives a nice boost in flavor

This was very tasty, but a bit dry.  I added additional milk and that helped a bit.  I don't think 16 oz jar of Alfredo sauce is sufficient.  Next time I will double the sauce.

I did everything in this recipe except I added different seasonings. I need flavor, so I add into the buttered marinate, lemon pepper, basil and black pepper. I then added more black pepper after mixing everything together. It was delicious. This is Father's Day dinner and I'm sure he's going to love it!

I made this for a late lunch today and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it! The only addition I made was sauteing some fresh garlic with the onion and peppers. It was super easy to make and very tasty! Thank you!

This recipe was very easy to make, which is nice for those hectic days.  The peppers and onions were a little different and I'm not sure if they added much flavor. I'd make this recipe again with a few minor changes.

I used half the amount of butter, and I think I could have reduced it a little more.  It was a little too bland for my taste - next time i will add tomates and maybe sliced ripe olives and basil.
