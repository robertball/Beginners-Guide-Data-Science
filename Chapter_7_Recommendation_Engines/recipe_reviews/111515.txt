This one is a keeper, I substituted cilantro for the parsley and added avocados and red onions.  Oh my, it even got better after sitting for a while.

Wow!  This is a great recipe.  I made a few modifications to it to make it perfect for me- I used a whole can of mixed beans instead of chick peas/garbanzo beans, increased the 'dressing' by half and that included the garlic, used grape/cherry tomatoes sliced in half AND used one-half cup chopped fresh cilantro instead of the parsley.  I know the vegetarians where I work will just LOVE this recipe.  It's a winner!

I found a very similar recipe on another site and followed that one's suggestion of using 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro instead of the parsley.  I used an entire can of garbanzo beans & more garlic.   I also sauteed some chopped onion and wilted a head of spinach with a little more olive oil and tossed that with the mixture.  Very flavorful mixture - especially after a day or two in the fridge.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and made a few *tiny* alterations. I did 1/2c quinoa to 1c water (and then some), 2/3c garbanzo beans, a whole (small) tomato, 1 (HUGE) clove of garlic, 1.5 limes juiced, no olive oil (forgot), 1 tsp cumin, and half of a (small) red onion. Super tasty!! My boyfriend and I love it. The lime is great, and the red onion (per another member's suggestion) is totally necessary.

I usually review the day after I have tried a recipe....but I wanted to say how much I loved this recipe! So yummy! I used cherry tomatoes which I quartered, and only used 1/2 c. quinoa to 1c. water. I also added only 2tsp. evoo. LOVED the freshness of the lime juice, parlsey and garlic. Will most definately make again. A great dish, thanks for sharing!

Super yummy.  I customized, though - added more garlic, cayenne, onion, broccoli, fresh basil, oregano, chopped walnuts, then topped it with diced cucumber, a sprinkle of kalamata olives, and feta.  Lovely flavor.

I made this recipe tonight, and it was great! Super easy for a busy mom. 
I didn't have any quinoa on hand, so I used couscous. I also added zucchini, yellow squash, and green onions, and I sauteed chickpeas and veggies  while the couscous was cooking. I also added lime juice, cumin, and parsley to the couscous. 
My 2 year old daughter wasn't a big fan of the lime and cumin flavors, so I squeezed a bit of orange on hers and the sweetness from the orange balanced out the tangy. It was very good this way, too!

This reminds me of my favorite quinoa recipe that uses black beans.  The chickpeas were a nice change!  My family really enjoyed this recipe. It's great room temperature, cold, and works well if you need a side dish for a picnic that doesn't have mayonnaise.  A great way to introduce a new food to your friends & family!

I loved this.  It could have used some onion, but that's about all I would have changed.  My quinoa took only about 7 or 8 minutes to cook, so this came together more quickly than I expected.  Will definitely make this again.

Instead of chickpeas, I stir fried some chicken with the garlic and olive oil and a little onion.  I cooked the quinoa as per recipe, and added spices and tomatoes before serving.  It was delish!  (Would be great with chickpeas too!)

This recipe is amazing. I made it with extra garlic and lots of cilantro instead of the parsley. It was fantastic. In the end, I also threw in some avocado and I will use more tomato next time around. I definitely agree with the other ratings, it gets better as it sits in the refrigerator. Much better cold.

This is like a mouthgasm.  Seriously!  It is so flavorful and scrumcious! I had never cooked with quinoa, and I picked the right place to start!  This recipe was so easy to make, although I did make some adjustments.  I used 3 cloves of garlic, cherry tomatoes, cilantro instead of parsley, and added red onion.  Holy moly, I think I could eat the whole thing by myself!  I made it less than 30 minutes ago and have already recommended it to several friends.  If you are looking for an amazing new recipe this is it!!!

I love this recipe! The lime is a really nice touch. I did it a little differently, I sauteed the garlic with onions and olive oil and used a can of drained diced tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato, and it came out great!

This was ok but lacked flavour.  My kids who love quinoa, wouldn't eat it.  The tomatoes did not hold up well. I love all of the ingredients, but together they were uninspired and uninteresting.  Sorry, I wanted to like this a lot more than I did.

Excellent!  We made  this right before a summer party tonight. It was soooooo good and so many people loved it and gave us compliments. The cumin made the dish, if you have none, don't make the dish. The cumin makes the dish sooo good. it makes it taste so Mediterranean. All in all delicious dish. I am a 12 year old, Pescatarian, and i made this, it was so easy. The only thing was that i used cherry tomatoes and disked them instead.

Delicious!  I add the tomatoes and lime juice at the end. I've also added a little achiote (annato) for color.

Excellent!

I would add much more chick peas...

Next day I made a frittata with leftovers adding an egg, cut up "pimientos de piquillo", lots of cilantro, a bit extra of salt and pepper. 
Using a pan, add a teaspoon of olive oil marinated with chili peppers, it gave it a delicious spicy flavor.

we've been on the hunt for satisfying vegetarian options, and this is it. I added extra cumin and instead of salt, I used a vegetable soup stock cube.  I did have to cook the quinoa a little longer than the recipe recommends.

So good! I cook my quinoa in the rice cooker so that there is no work to be done!  Same water to quinoa ratio.  Then I add green onions, sub the parsley for cilantro and double the cumin!
Once its done I add sliced avocado on top!

I needed a quick lunch and had canned diced tomatoes with olive oil and garlic added.  I drained the tomatoes reserving the liquid.  Added water to the tomato liquid to equal the 1 3/4 cups and cooked the quinoa in that liquid for extra flavor.  Tossed in all other ingredients as called for. Substituted the canned tomatoes for the fresh, cilantro for the parsley, decreased  olive oil in 1/2.  It was fantasic and soooo quick!!!

really good. The taste reminds me a little of tabbouli.  I added some chopped red onion and cucumber.  I also cooked the quinoa in some chicken broth in place of the water.  Very healthy and tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

I hate to be the one to say it, but this recipe just didn't do it for me- despite all the great reviews!Quinoa is new to me, so it may be a matter of trying several recipes before I find the right one for me-Or it's possible that quinoa is just not for me! (Sorry!)

Considering I really don't care for vegetarian meals - this one had real benefits...like weight loss.  Slow eating and no seconds.  Really, it was real tasty.  When I make it again, I'll use black beans rather than chickpeas because I don't care for the texture of chickpeas.  Black beans will also add a nice color.  As another review suggested, I used cilantro rather than parsley.

I followed recipe exactly but my quinoa was mushy and I didn't like the cumin flavor.  Just awful to me.

Fantastic!  Made it according to the recipe (cook in the rice cooker just like you would with rice).  I added some sauteed onions and used cilantro instead of parsley as someone else suggested.  We all loved it!

Oh my Goddess, this was awesome! It was exactly what I was looking for in a quinoa summer salad, a little tart but not too vnegary. I did add a few things to make this more crunchy and flavorful. I doubled the olive oil/lime juice/garlic and put it in a small blender to mix/chop it together, then added chopped celery and goat cheese for a mediterranean flavor. I also replaced the parsley with cilantro because I like the flavor of cilantro better. I think I will also do a mexican version of this and add corn, black beans, and bell pepper instead of garanzo beans, celery and goat cheese. I think this can be tailored to many different combinations of beans and veggies. Absolutely delish for such a healthy dish!

Threw in some marinated artichoke & its juices/oil instead of olive oil. Added some truffle oil. Used the zest & juice of 1/2 a lemon. Threw in halved grape tomatoes & added some green onion & cilantro!

Made tonight with grilled chicken instead of the usual white rice side dish and it was delicious! I did add diced red onions (based on other reviews) and cherry tomatoes and skipped the parsley just because I didn't have any. The only lime juice I had was Rose's sweetened lime juice.  My husband & I both loved it.

I like this a ton - very fresh and light, a perfect summer salad, best cold and even better after having time to meld in the fridge.  As always, I modified to make it my own: cilantro, English cucumbers, red onion, grape tomatoes, lime zest and honey, in addition to what is listed.  To me, about a TBSP of honey was necessary to bring out that sweet/savory thing. I might try adding just a little bit of jalapeno to see if that really kicks it up, and I might try adding some avocado or grilled chicken.  Served over baby greens, this is a killer lunch or dinner side.

Fabulous!  A big hit even with the quinoa skeptics!  I used black beans since that's what I had on hand, cooked quinoa in chicken broth, and added one diced avocado and about 1/2 cup of finely chopped red onion, as others had suggested.  Had a little fresh cilantro, which was great, but the parsley would probably be just as good.  Definitely a keeper!

Very yummy!  I didn't have any lime juice, so I used lemon, but I think the lime would be my preference if I had it in the fridge.  I had two helpings and now I am quite satisfied.  Not even a little bit hungry.  Nice fresh easy recipe.

This was really good!  As directed it was a bit sour for my taste so I had to drain some of the liquid off, but otherwise it was very tasty.   I didn't have chickpeas so I used black beans instead and two roma tomatoes and some spring onion.  Served it room temperature.  Next time I'll add 2 tablespoons of lime juice and 3 tablespoons of olive oil and add more to taste after.  Still, a very good dish.  Thank you!

Nice vegetarian side dish.  The tomatoes make for a potent acid taste, but I think a little extra salt and pepper would take care of that.  If you have vegetarian friends surprise them with this dish rather than copping out with a salad for them.

Wow!  Excellent flavor!  I made the following changes:  two cloves of garlic, sauteed very briefly in the olive oil, one avacado, and one small package of pine nuts.  The recipe would have been excellent without these changes; I was just adapting to my individual tastes.

I love the versatility quinoa offers, however, this receipe really needed more flavor -  I doctored it up with 2 t. cumin and 1 t cinnamon.  The olive oil is totally unnecessary so I left it out.

This was wonderful!  I followed the directions on my quinoa box for the measurement of water (and also added 1 tsp. salt to the water).  I added 1 chopped bell pepper just because I had one that needed eating, and increased the olive oil to 1 Tbl.  I used 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper, and used 1 Tbl. chopped cilantro instead of parsley.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted bland. I can't understand why you would put olive oil in this recipe??? I added cayenne and some red onion to help improve the flavor and there again no improvement. Never will make this again.

A tasty and high protein vegetarian option or side dish.  I cooked my quinoa in organic vegetable broth because it gives the grain more flavor.  I also used a little chopped onion and cilantro in place of parsley.  This is a great base recipe that can be adjusted according to your desire or what ingredients you have on hand.  Will be using this a lot as the weather warms up.

Very quick & easy. I'd like a little less lime & maybe more ingredients such as avocadoes as another reviewer suggested and just maybe a bit more texture/crunch.

Very delicious! I ended up using brown basmati rice as I didn't have quinoa, 2 tomatos, and I used 1 tsp cumin seed as I didn't have any ground. Turned out excellent! A light, fresh taste! The rest of the ingredient measurements were the same and we had a LITTLE left over and were only feeding 3! If this was a side dish and had something else with it, then maybe it could feed 6, but as a vegan meal, unless they had very small appetites, I can't see how only this would feed 6! The only reason we had left overs was because my husband had a chicken breast with it! Still excellent!

I did not like this recipes. The tomatos got mushy and chickpeas were a odd texture with quinoa. And way to much parsley!

Great, easy recipe! Make sure you rinse your quinoa well to avoid a "soapy" taste. I used vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian also. I used some tomatoes & cucumbers out of my grandma's garden and did cilantro instead of parsley. YUM!

Not bad. I took this to a barbecue to make sure I would have something gluten-free to eat. It didn't really go over with the crowd but I didn't expect too much. This recipe is just like any other quinoa salad; not bad. I thankfully added onion and extra garlic. I think it would have been pretty bland without them given chickpeas are nearly flavorless. All that said, I still like it and will probably keep tweaking it.

This was our first experience with Quinoa - everyone liked it, though one child was more reluctant than the other.  I also added some onion and black olives. Maybe have been better without, as the lime taste was not very evident.  Tip: If you change the servings from 6 to 9 you can use your whole can of garbanzo beans.

This recipe is incredible!! The cumin gives the quinoa a wonderful flavor. I used grape tomatoes (an entire package) instead of 1 big tomato. It is EVEN better the next day after it has been refrigerated. I cut up a Babybel Light cheese on top of it and it was the perfect lunch the next day. Five stars and thanks for this keeper!

This was very good. Also the first time I have tried Quinoa. I followed the advice of others and used Cilantro instead of parsley. It really does add a nice flavour. The next time, I will make sure to add a little more liquid...this is just a personal preference. I enjoyed it very much.

wow, this was great!  This was my first time making quinoa, and it was pretty easy!  I added sauteed red and green bell peppers (diced), and had to use some home-canned tomatoes (thanks Grandma), and used the chickpea juice in the cooking water for the quinoa. 
 I mostly added this stuff because I just need to eat more veggies hehe... Great recipe!  Also, it DOES taste even better the next day!

Great recipe! The only thing I did differently is that I toasted the quinoa in the sauce pan in 1 tsp of the olive oil for 5 mins before adding the water. This decreased the cooking time to 15 mins; this gave the quinoa a nutty flavor. Next time I'll add chicken as another reviewer suggested.

I was surprised by how tasty this was. I thought, just looking at the ingredients, that there wouldn't be enough flavor, but it was great! Like others, I subbed cilantro for parsley, and used red quinoa (what I had on hand). A great vegetarian/vegan meal!

This is delicious! I sauteed onions and cooked the quinoa with chicken broth. I used garlic olive oil and cilantro instead of parsley and added an extra clove of garlic. Also used grape tomatoes and added diced cucumber. Fantastic! I can't stop eating it!

The food came out with a nice taste and could easily be a main dish or side dish to poultry. I sauted a little onion with the garlic and added the tomatoes and chickpeas just long enough to heat through (personal preference).

I made this as written, only with a little bit less olive oil. It was easy and healthy and good, so I would make it again! Next time I plan to add a diced bell pepper to up the veggie quotient and add a little more kick.

This recipe is excellent as-is.  Simple and tasty. The next day I stuffed the leftovers in a pita and it was just as good as the day before.  I think next time I'll pair it with a nice light white wine and a baked breast of chicken; Yum!

Tastes wonderful, quick & easy and my 5 yr old ate it. Made a wonderful lunch the next day by putting a little of this, some grilled tilapia, squirt of lime & a dash of hot sauce into a low carb tortilla.

Fabulous, easy, healthy recipe.  I make this a lot and usually at least double it--wonderful leftovers.  We add extra lime juice, as well as the zest from a lime or two.  Gives it some nice zing. Oh, and I also add crumbled feta.

What a super dish-- tasty and healthy!  We've eaten it as a main course or as an appetizer, with corn chips.  Hot or cold, it's a crowd pleaser!  The lime juice is key.

Great combination of spices and juice. I made substitutions because I didn't have all the right stuff, but the basics were the same and it tastes fantastic.

I think next time I would add sliced green onion and possibly use lemon instead of lime.  This recipe is good but feels like it's lacking something flavorful.

Use chicken broth, tomatoes with flavor such as jalapeno, and add green onions and cilantro. Very tasty.

A great quinoa recipe! Very flavourful. The only substitution I made was using fresh chopped cilantro instead of parsley as it goes very well with lime juice. For more flavour, you could try using vegetable stock instead of water, and for colour I used a mix of red and white quinoa. Thanks! :)

I used cilantro instead of parsley because I love love love cilantro.  I also added a bit of lime zest.  This was my first quinoa recipe, I usually eat quinoa as a rice substitute or cook it half and half with rice, so it is nice to try new things with it.

Yum!  I first sauteed a little bit of chopped onion and let that cook down a little.  Then I added the quinoa and broth (instead of water) and it took more like 45 minutes to fully cook.  Then I added a full can of chickpeas, about 1 cup of halved grape tomatoes (could have used more), and 2x the amount of dressing.  I let it sit overnight to eat...easy and tasty!

OMG I love this!!!  These were the alterations I made.  Used vegetarian bouillon (Better than Bouillon is the best and vegetarian flavor tastes better than the chicken flavor)for quinoa. I used roasted red tomatoes in herbed olive oil because I had no fresh tomatoes.  I had no lime so used fresh lemon.  I used fresh parsley and some dried cilantro.  I steamed some kale and added (great colors and nutrient rich) and I love crunch so I added slivered almonds.  It was delicious!!!!!

Used baby tomatoes and added extra of all the seasonings listed, incl Cilantro! Still a tad too bland for me so I may try to add different spices next time like Ginger. Great recipe though and very easy to make! Using it for on-the-go meals during the work week

I really liked this refreshing salad. Our 2-year-old didn't like the lime juice in it - I'll have to try something else as a substitute for it next time. I added onions for a crunch, and I liked someone's idea of adding avocados.

Made with veggie broth instead of water, added some sliced avocado--highly recommended.  Also subbed cilantro for the parsley, and probably used more like 2 tablespoons. Forgot to add the olive oil and it was still very good.  Will remake

This was DELICIOUS. It was our first try with quinoa and I will absolutely be making this again. Nice and simple, there would be a million ways to tweak the flavor if you want but wow, it's awesome the way it is.

Great summer side dish! I customized mine like most others have: It tasted a bit bland, so I added extra lime juice (it ended up being a whole lime), instead of parsley I put cilantro, added some small chopped green bell pepper, and put about a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to add some tang. Even my picky hubby who doesn't like healthy food ended up loving it! I served it cold, alongside grilled chicken.

I didn't use lime juice and I substituted parsley with cilantro. I thought it came out real good but my husband didn't like chickpeas combined with quinoa (he normally loves quinoa!!). Oh well.. still a good recipe in my mind.

Pretty good, first time ever cooking with Quinoa (first time having it too!) It was refreshing. Loved the lime and cumin. Added some salt and pepper.  The parsley made the dish look very colorful! May use this as a side dish at a summer picnic.

Very enjoyable.  I added chopped mushrooms, extra tomato and an avocado (excellent addition).  You definitely need more water than it lists, so keep an eye on the quinoa (I had to add water a few times).  I prepared it by adding the mushrooms and garlic 5 minutes or so before the quinoa would be finished, then a couple of minutes later adding the chickpeas and cumin, then adding the tomato.  Then I would cook off the water (which the tomatoes would add to the dish).  Once the extra water was cooked off I added the parsley.  Add the avocado to your individual dish rather than the pot (because avocadoes don't store very well for leftovers).  I also found the hoisin sauce perfected the dish.

Mild but good!  I doubled the recipe, using a full can of chickpeas.  I used halved cherry tomatoes and added a small red onion.  I also subbed cilantro for the parsley.  The flavor was nice, but I recommend more of the spices to make it stand out.

OH MY GOSH this was amazing!! So delicious and unexpected!! It's the first time I ever made Quinoa so I had no idea what to expect but boy am I glad I chose this recipe :)
I did sub cilantro for the parsley as some recommended and added avocado as well. It was so delicious, served it as a side dish with the Chicken Kabobs Mexicana - DH raved and raved. I also used a mix of bulgur and red quinoa b/c that's what I bought from the store. Will be making this again and again, thanks for the great recipe!

used pinto beans, cherry tomatoes, added diced onion.  just before serving added avocado and topped with cilantro (instead of parsley). Next time cut quinoa in half. Consider adding diced cucumber, peppers.

I didn't know if I'd like quinoa made without chicken broth to help the flavor, but this was excellent!!!  Very tasty and super easy to make!

I had my doubts that quinoa could be made to taste good, but this was amazing. I dont like the texture of chickpeas whole, but once mixed altogether, it was so good i didnt mind it. I used extra garlic cloves. Cooked the quinoa in chicken broth. Used a can of diced tomotoes in lime juice and cilantro ( instead of whole tomatoes) Used fresh cilantro chopped and the parsley. This was truly great!! So much flavor!!

I've made a lot if quinoa salads and this one takes the cake for flavour. I read others comments and used the following:  cherry tomatoes, 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion, cilantro in place of parsley, wilted and finally chopped spinach.  Amazing.

My new favorite dish!!!Recently became a vegan and having trouble finding variety that fits into lifestyle. Next time will follow some of the other reviewer's tips to try and change it up.  Seems very versatile and easily altered while still making a good dish!

OMG you must try this recipe! I promise you won't be disappointed. I chose this recipe because I needed to get rid of some quinoa in the pantry. I listened to previous reviews and replaced the tomato with spinach that I lightly wilted in a separate pan. I added about a 1/4 cup of diced red onion and another clove of garlic to the mix and replaced the parsley with cilantro. I also just threw in the entire can of chickpeas. HOLY COW! It was amazing to say the least. And so darn healthy. How can you say no to that?

I love the flavor! I used cilantro (I didnt have parsley), added some cayenne, and omitted the olive oil. I ate half of it as soon as I was done mixing the ingredients. Thank you so much for this yummy recipe.

Not sure what's all the rave for this recipe. While it was good and light, the outcome was not exceptional as I expected given the average rating of almost 5 stars. I followed some of the recommendations and also added onions & spinach I sautéed in olive oil and lime, plus red and yellow peppers, & avocado.  Cooked the quinoa with powdered onion, garlic,  and salt. Even added more lemon that the recommended, and yes, it was, as stated previously a nice meal, but not as tasty as to recommend to others.  Then again, wouldn't discard entirely.

Quick, tasty & healthy.  Even the people who never ate quinoa and don't like beans loved this recipe.  I couldn't taste the lime, but the combination of the dressing ingredients was fresh and yummy.  I substituted cilantro because that is what I had, and substituted chili powder for the cumin because I was out of cumin.

We liked this.  I added some chopped bell pepper and cilantro.  It would have been equally good with black beans substituted for the garbanzos.  The addition of an avocado would be wonderful as well.

I've tried this recipe with and without olive oil and it doesn't seem to be needed in the recipe. I also put cucumber in it the first time I made it and it made it really crisp and very tasty! I actually prefer this recipe cold.

This was a pretty good vegan meal. I took the suggestions of others and added red onion and used cilantro rather than parsley. I'm glad that I did. I think it would have been a little bland without the onion.

Very yummy. I didn't have a strainer with small enough holes to rise my quinoa, so I just made it according to package directions. I sauteed some chopped onion and garlic and added that in... I just love onions. I also didn't have any limes, so I used lemon and I used cilantro instead of parsley... just delicious.

Delicious!  I made it as is and decided to add kalamata olives and diced red onions, which gave it a little extra kick of flavor.

This was GREAT!  I used 2 cups of water and only simmered the quinoa for 15 minutes.  Also, instead of the olive oil, I used a few squirts of a low-calorie balsamic vinegar dressing.  I can't wait to have the leftovers!

We didn't have cumin or parsley, so I substituted cilantro and it still tasted great! I also used chicken broth instead of water for a little more flavor and added more chickpeas. Yum.

I read the comments and cooked so much quinoa that I ended up making a mediterranean version and mexican version. The med. version did lack flavor so I upped the viniagrette volume on the mex version.  Changes I made were: used quartered cherry tomatoes, choped cucumber, chopped black olives, chopped scallions, lemon zet and lemon juice (as well as lime) cooked orzo and crumbled feta cheese. For the mex. version I used rinsed black beans instead of garbanzo, no cukes but avocado, frozen corn, lemon/lime zest and juice, cilantro instead of parsley, chopped green pepper, chopped scallions, gr. red pepper and chili powder in dressing.  I would make both again with more dressing for the med. version next time.

This is an excellent quinoa recipe! I have to say that I did make a few changes though. I used chicken broth in place of the water. I added the juice of two limes. In place of the 1/2 teaspoon parsley, I used about a half cup of cilantro. For a little extra seasoning, I added some Mrs. Dash. This recipe yields very well to many adaptations. Will make again. Soon, I hope!

My family loves this dish, its easy & quick to make I use it as a main meal when we have a "Veggie Night".  I also added cooked shrimp and black beans and more garlic.

This is my first experience with quinoa.  I was surprised at how much the recipe makes.  I added cucumbers and cherry tomatoes.  It is very light a refreshing but I don't think my husband will like it.

This was good and versatile!  I used roasted red peppers and left out the cumin.  I think it would be really good with sun dried tomatoes and basil or served cold as a salad over spinach.  This is a nice change from the typical "tex-mex" Southwestern flavored quinoa recipes that only pair it with corn, black beans and cilantro.  Thanks for sharing!

This was ok - nothing special.  I've made other Quinoa and bean dish that was better as I think pinto beans are better in it as they are creamier.

I never tried this before and it was different; not something the kids went for and it was very bland.  I upped the parsley, added some cayenne, onion powder and doubled the cumin.  I also added a half of an Armenian cucumber.  Nothing seemed to help as the quinoa seemed to overpower everything and when you eat it alone it really seemed tasteless.  Weird, maybe try cooking the quinoa in broth instead of water may help.   I wanted to love it because it looked good and I love garbanzo beans but I wasn't a fan of this recipe!

Very delicious and healthy recipe for quinoa. I scaled this down and made it for my lunch. Because it was scaled down, it only took 15 minutes from start to finish, so it was perfect. I used a lot more parsley than recommended. It would be good with cilantro as well. Thanks for the recipe.

mmmmmmm!  I used veg broth instead of water, added a lot of flavor!  I used grape tomatoes sliced in half, and I also used sliced avocado on top,  fresh cilantro instead of parsley, and added seared squash and zucchini.  This was a huge hit!

This is a great, simple little recipe.  I used the juice from two limes, added three scallions, and used grape tomatoes which I added to my plate at the end, so they don't get slimy as it will take me a few days to eat this.  Another plus, I had all the ingredients on hand!

Good recipe as written, but we also like to sauté an onion with the olive oil and cumin before adding tomatoes, chick peas,  and lime juice, etc. to the cooked quinoa.   Easy and fast weeknight supper.

Yes. Make this. You’ll be glad you did. We used lemon instead of lime juice because we made it with lemon yogurt grilled chicken - perfect side dish; great as leftovers for breakfast with a sunny side up egg and yogurt!

This is one I'll definitely do again! I only combined the garbanzo beans with the quinoa in the last few minutes of cooking. I sautéed onions, garlic, green pepper, and mushrooms separately and added the seasonings to that veggie mixture before adding it onto the cooked quinoa with lime juice. On top of that, I added tomato, feta cheese, and avocado as a garnish and it was amazing!

I would give this 5 stars for being quick and easy, if that was the only thing being rated.  I made this as written except I was out of olive oil so used walnut oil which, according to the label, was good for salads; thought I had lime juice on hand but didn't so used lemon juice; and used about a tsp or so of dried parsley as I didn't have fresh.  The flavor was okay--nothing that really "wowed" me.  Also the dish needed more color.  The cooked quinoa and garbanzo beans were the same color so the only dash of color was the tomato.  Cucumber would add some color and also crunch.  So would bell peppers.  I would probably not make this recipe--as written--again.

I will make this again!  I used a 19 oz tin of chickpeas, added green onion and 1 tsp oregano. More flavourful than many quinoa recipes I've tried. Next time I will add 1 tsp cumin and try increasing dressing by 1/2 as suggested. You can really add any veggies like peppers and cucumbers.

I used fresh coriander rather than parsley as I had none on hand.
I cooked the chickpeas and tomatoes in the quinoa for a bit to have the flavors meld.
I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth not water
I used at least 3x the amount of cumin required and put in a pinch of red pepper.  I kept tasting the dish saying it was tasteless and kept adding ground cumin until it registered.
I'll make it again, very popular at my house, but 1/2 tsp cumin is not enough!

Really liked it.  I sauteed some onions and added that, also sauteed the rest of the veggies and cooked the whole thing for a bit so it felt less like a salad.  Might add some raisins next time.

Didn't have tomatoes the first time I made this, but the lime gave it a fresh flavor. Also, quinoa can be kinda bland when cooked in water, so I will sometimes cook it in vegetable broth, or do as others suggested and ramp up the spices or add more veggies.

We enjoy all of the ingredients and the end results are wonderful.  I may try it with cilantro and red onions as suggested by Linda did for a variation.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

As written this is 3 stars. Use grape tomatoes cut in half, way more parsley, green onions and feta cheese.  Then it is a 5 star one.  I make this once a week at least.

I cooked quinoa in water with chicken bullion and omitted salt. I didn't have parsley, but my mint is taking over my garden so I used it. It was yummy. Very similar to tabouli.

We had this twice in one week, it was good!  My husband couldn't stop raving it about it the first time, and he begged me to make it again when we had company on the weekend.  Because we prefer them, I used cannellini beans rather than garbanzo beans.  The lime juice adds such a nice touch--I try to use fresh.

This was delicious.  The only changes I made was to increase the number of chopped tomatoes to 2, and added 2 tbsps of diced, pickled jalapenos to give it some kick.
Next time I will subsitute cilantro for the parsley, but that's only a personal preference for cilantro.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

The tastes of this is really good. My bf and I really liked it, but my only problem with it is the quinoa to water ratio. I felt the quinoa was too mushy. I would use A LOT less water next time!

I thought this was a very nice option to make quinoa as a meal. It was very filling and the flavor was nice. I did find that the galic was a bit overwhelming- next time I will use a little less. I also thought it was way too wet- and I didn't even use all the "dressing" (I whisked the lime, oil, cumin, and garlic in a separate dish and then added it). I also only used about 3/4 of the can of chickpeas. I don't often eat vegetarian meals, especially for dinner, but this was very satisfying!

This is a great easy recipe to take to work for lunch. I didn't have any beans and added some cherry tomatoes too. Also I didn't have any Quinoa so I used brown rice, it was just as tasty. You definately need the fresh limes though, it really enhances the taste. Also much nicer to used coriander instead of Parsley.

Delicious! I added avocado and baby spinach leaves (next time I will wilt them), and more tomato. Only a squirt of olive oil and lemon instead of lime juice. This one's a winner and I must say the avocado goes extremely well with it. So yummy.

Absolutely delicious, hot or cold.  I doubled the amount of tomatoes simply because I love them, also substituted cilantro for the parsley as suggested by another reviewer and added 1/2 teaspoon of hot chili garlic sauce for a little zing.  Yummmm!

I can't get enough of quinoa and this is a fresh and fabulous recipe I'll repeat again and again. In order to maximize the garlic flavor I sauteed it in the olive oil and then mixed in the garbanzo beans to heat them through.  I omitted the cumin and substituted cilantro for the parsley. Loved it!

I was delighted by this dish! I purchased quinoa on clearance at the grocery and had heard a lot about how great it is but had never tried it. This is my first experience with it and I'm impressed. I loved the smokiness of the cumin and was able to use fresh parsley and tomatoes from the garden. I thought I had chickpeas on hand but couldn't find them so I used navy beans I had cooked from bulk and frozen. They worked great in here! I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow once it's cold and all the flavors are melded even more.

My 3 daughters and I loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes and will do so again until it is just right for us.  I made the recipe as is and then I upped the cumin a little and added some fresh chives and some celery for crunch.  Next time I think I will try cucumber in place of the celery.  Mine did not come out wet or too tangy as some have said, but was perfect.  Definitely a keeper!

I used spicy cooked packaged chickpeas and also used cilantro instead of parsley and upped the cumin.  Wow.  I really thought it was delicious!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  Great vegetarian option!  I added extra garlic, since I personally love the flavor.  I think next time I'll add more lime juice and more tomato.  One tomato wasn't enough!  I also had some extra fresh cilantro on hand.  It meshed nicely with the flavors.

I loved this recipe. We have eaten it several times.  I substitued, like others had suggested, grape tomates.  I also added more lime juice and cumin than the recipe called for.  This recipe was also great as a cold dish.

Decided to make this at the last minute and didn't have any quinoa so used Acini de Pepe instead, otherwised followed recipe. Next time may add some onion, more garlic and more cumin. Very fresh tasting salad! I can't stay away from it!

This is a great recipe!  It was a wonderful introduction to quinoa for me.  I like to add some diced onion and avacado and use cilantro instead of parsley for a nice variation.  It's a keeper.

I made this exactly as written and, while good, I found it needed more: oil & lime, tomatoes, and  parsley.  Which I added, and it was very tasty. I would definitely make again with the "extras".

Not so good, I sauteed the onions and tomatoes, I think that was a mistake.  Tasted a bit better at room temperature the next day.  I'll try again with raw onions.

This turned out really well!  I followed the other reviewers' advice and used cilantro instead of parsley, and added a bit more garlic.  The result was delicious!  I definitely plan to make it again.

LOVE the flavors! This is so light and flavored that you could totally eat the whole thing in one sitting. I added some [fake] grilled chicken (seasoned it with a bit of extra olive oil, garlic powder, and cumin), because of other reviews. Stellar. Usually I don't rate until after a repeat attempt, but this was solidly good.

I just love trying recipes for quinoa as it's such a versatile and healthy grain.  Throw chickpeas in there - what's not to love!!  We really enjoyed this, the lime juice with the cumin add great flavour, loved all of these ingredients together.  Thanks for sharing!

Great, healthy recipe.  While the quinoa was cooking, I heated a little olive oil (about 1 Tbsp) in a skillet and sauteed the garlic (1-2 cloves) and a medium chopped zucchini.  After the zucchini softened a bit, I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes (drained), a can of chickpeas (drained) and some red pepper flakes.  Once the quinoa was done I stirred it into the tomato/zucchini mixture and added the lime juice, cumin, salt & pepper, and the parsley along with about 2 tsp of fresh cilantro.

Delish! Super fresh and summery taste...added green onion and chopped carrot as well, omitted the parsley since I didn't have any on hand...  I also used red quinoa and it turned out beautifully! My husband thoroughly enjoyed the dish as well.

I wanted more vegetables in the mix, so I used this recipe as a starting point. I added 1/2 c diced sweet red pepper and 1 small diced zucchini, more parsley, a bit of curry powder, and used halved grape tomatoes. Very good. If you are watching your sodium, be sure to rinse the garbanzos so the salad won't be too salty. I think you could also cut the amount of oil.

This was good but far from amazing. It is a very light, healthy tasting meal, but it isn't exactly bursting with flavor. I just about doubled all of the spices and still felt like it was lacking something. Perhaps it would have been better if we'd had something else on the side to add variety to the meal.

The recipe was delicious!  I never thought of adding lime to these two.  It reminds me of pico de gallo with the lime, tomato and garlic.  I reduced the recipe to 3 servings.  Unfortunately the lime is a little off.  i will definitely be making this again, but tasting the food while adding the lime!  I think this as a cold/room temperature salad would be a great way to introduce people to both chickpeas and quinoa.

Excellent recipe. Only change I made was to use a full can of chickpeas (only because I misread the recipe!) which made this great as a meal salad to take to work. I also used halved grape tomatoes as they were what I had and threw the cumin and cayenne in with the quinoa as it simmered. If you like a little heat, some hot sauce added before serving is really excellent.

This didn't have a very "full" flavor.  The lime actually did more harm than good to the overall taste.
The kids liked the Organic Chickpeas I used... but I didn't care for the recipe overall.

I loved this! It was a nice light summer dinner. I used lemon juice because it's what I had, and I thought it turned out great. I added a little bit of chile powder to give it a bit of spice. It turned out great!
