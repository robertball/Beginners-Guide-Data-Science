This is soooo good.  I've never cooked plums before and never made a clafouti.  Didn't even know what it was.  But this is delicious.  I didn't have lemon zest so left it out, but I don't think it made a big difference. It was just fine without.  Next time I have a lot of extra plums, I'll make it again.  And maybe even try other fruit.  The clafouti is a kind of doughy custard, which may not sound appetizing, but don't let that put you off.  This really is good.

I made this for company and it was very easy and good. I did reduce the lemon peel as suggested. I liked that it wasn't too sweet and had a texture similar to creme caramel, which is a favourite. What made it really good was topping it with a plum sauce my husband made with our remaining fruit. He cooked pitted plums down with a bit of water and then sweetened it to taste. Served warm, it was divine. I actually made it again the next day, to see if it was that good, and it was. I am going to try this recipe using apples, brown sugar and a caramel sauce. Stay tuned.

Made this for my family to use up some fresh plums and everyone LOVED it. I followed the recipe to the letter, incl. baking time and it was a perfect dessert--neither too sweet nor too tart. A perfect balance of flavor and texture and served warm with a dollop of whipped cream---HEAVEN. Will try with other fruits also.

I make lots of this every August when my backyard plum tree is heavy with fruit. A generous slice with coffee is my perfect early-autumn breakfast. I don't usually have lemon zest around so I leave that (and the salt) out, and use only 4 tbl sugar total, and often substitute wholewheat or buckwheat or soy for half the flour, and it's always wonderful. Looking forward to trying it with herb-infused milk this year. Maybe rosemary. Thanks, Marion!

This is so good and easy to make. Served to company with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which helps balance the tartness of the plums.I mixed the batter up earlier in the day and refrigerated it. Just cut and pit the plums before you sit down to dinner and pour the batter over and pop in the oven. Dessert is warm from the oven. This is a Keeper.

Incredible! Tastes exactly like traditional French clafoutis but it's low fat! A definite keeper, thanks for posting!

I'd never made or eaten clafouti before, so I can't rate it on authenticity. It was ok -- firmer than a custard and softer than a cake.  Definitely needed more sugar in the batter.  I don't like desserts that are too sweet, but this was barely sweet, and I even used tree-ripened home grown plums.

This is my idea of a great dessert recipe.  It was dead-easy to make and the end result tasted great.  I used blueberries (about 1 cup of fresh) instead of plums and the lemon and blueberry flavour was a very good natural combination.  Next time I make this, I will reduce the amount of vanilla though as it was very strong.  Unfortunately, I overcooked it...so next time 55 minutes will be perfect I think!

Huge hit! Followed the recipe to the letter. Super easy to make. I served it with whip cream. My family had seconds and thirds. I'll make it again for sure! Next time I'll try pears or a mix of berries.

Delicious!  What a nice way to use Italian plums that are a litte past their prime.  To me, it tasted like a plum version of the traditional French Clafoutis, made with black cherries.  I was surprised to find that the plum/lemon zest/cinnamon combo really worked well.  Don't change a thing when you try this for the first time. You won't be sorry!

Easy to make and fun to say. What's not to love about clafouti? It comes in somewhere between a custard and a pie and you can make it with cherries, plums, peaches, figs...whatever is fresh. I wonder how it would work with apples or pears this fall? Let's find out!

Great recipe to use up extra plums!  This was really quick to prepare and tasted great to boot. I love that there is no oil or butter in this recipe.  I agree with the other reviewer that 1 1/2 tsp of lemon rind is a bit too much, 1 tsp is plenty .

I have made this recipe for years, though I seldom use plums (only because I don't have a plum tree yet). Plain apple or combo's such as apple and berries (raspberries, saskatoons or blackberries all work well. If using berries, place them in the dish first or at least press them down below the surface of the liquid or they tend to burn. Tonight I've tried apple and rhubarb. I increased the sugar just a tad because of the rhubarb. We eat this warm as dessert or have it cold as breakfast. I would rate it 4.5 stars only because it lacks some wow factor that you get with more elaborate desserts but it is a real workhorse of a family dessert that is pretty healthy (can also substitute half to all whole wheat flour) and delicious.

First time making one of these. Neighbor gave me some italian plums, tasted good, reminds me of bread pudding. Excellent for breakfast reheated just a bit in the microwave! Really easy to put together and cook. Looks very elegant when done. Thanks!

Tasty recipe but it needed more sugar as my plums were very tart.  This recipe is good but taste your plums raw before adjusting sugar.

this dessert was SO EASY to make. it looks beautiful, as well, so i'd definitely think of making this if i was entertaining. best part though was eating it - it was something like a cross between custard and a pancake, and was extremely light but very satisfying. the plums were perfect and almost lent a liqueur-like flavor to the dessert. loved it and will make again and again!

Added a bit of extra sugar because I was worried about our super tart plums and left out the grated lemon peel because I didn't have it. Shouldn't have added the extra suger. Next time I will make it just as the recipe says... and I will be making it another time. Everyone loved it!

Clafouti is a French dessert and can be used with other fresh fruits. My French mother-in-law always makes cherry clafouti's and they turn out amazing!

I thought this recipe was really good and SUPER easy.  The only thing I might change is to cut the plums into smaller bite pieces.  Other than that I thought this clafouti was great:)

The classic French formulation is more of a custard than a cake so I reduced the flour by half (and I've seen recipes that use as little as 3 T ;-) and got the results I desired. Served warm with cream, this is one of our favorite breakfasts!

Super simple and what a lovely dish.  I served it at room temp the day of baking.  I made it in a 9 inch pie plate and dusted it with powdered sugar.  It was a hit, everyone loved it.  It wasn't overly sweet, it was a nice balance and the tartness of the pear skin was a cleansing taste.  I didn't use as much cinnamon, just a hint in the background.  I think the Italian Prune Plum and lemon zest was a perfect pairing.

This is so good and so easy.  It looks and tastes like it came from an elegant French bakery! Adults loved it; kids not so much (because it's not super sweet and has a sophisticated texture).

I used plums I froze last fall(thawed first)and they worked just fine.  I didn't have a lemon, so I added a tsp. of ground ginger. It does puff up a lot while baking, then sinks a bit while cooling, so a deep-dish pie pan is recommended.  Easy and impressive-looking!

This is so simple , great way to use plums. Love it with the plum sauce instead of sugar. Like a little more cinnamon, but other than that its great.

I did not care for this... batter came out almost egg-ish...like the inside of a popover and it needed more sugar.  Maybe if you add more flour and sugar with less plums it would be better

Found it to be just alright. Average tasting dessert dont think I would make this again unless I found myself with a whole lot of plums to use up.

The most time-consuming part of this is pitting the plums. Besides that, this is delicious.  I used 1/3 cup spelt flour (whole grain) and 3 tbsp. total sugar. The tart plums are delicious!

I made this recipe when I had a ton of plums from a local farm (about the size of the O in an OK sign you make with your hand) and this couldn't have been an easier recipe. It's not overly sweet and would go great with ice cream. The only annoying part was de-pitting the plums, but what can you do. The custardy consistency becomes more solid after the first day, so this is best eaten soon after baked.
Edit- I wanted to add I've made this several times since I made the first one, and without fail, everyone loves this, ESPECIALLY newly out of the oven. I basically use whatever stone fruit I have in the fridge, plus occasional raspberries/blackberries/strawberries. Make some whipped cream and man, breakfast of champions.

I'd never heard of clafouti before, but decided to give this a try because I have a tree full of plums. It reminded me of bread pudding and crepes... I thought it was very tasty.  My in-laws have never eaten bread pudding, and they thought the clafouti was rather strange, but they were polite and ate it anyway. I ate some while it was hot and served it at room temp - they might have been more receptive if it was warm and with a scoop of icecream. Thanks for the recipe, Marion!

Never made this before so was impressed with how it turned out - looked just like the photo! Really tasty and the family loved it. Will try with other fruit and see how it comes out. Will definitely make again - thanks!

I made this with Pluots, instead of plums, and coconut sugar (which is low glycemic) which made it a little less sweet.  This is an easy recipe to make and the results are wonderful -- mine puffed up and browned like a professional dessert.  I also topped it with brandy laced whip cream!

I was not impressed with this recipe and neither was any of my family. It was a disappointment. The biggest problem was the flavor...it really needs something more. If you do make this I definitely suggest serving with ice cream or whipped topping. I won't make this again.

I had no powdered sugar and no lemon zest. I used 4 regular red plums (2") and a small red apple. I cut them in half and sliced in 1/4" wedges. Layered apples on bottom, then plums above. Used soy milk instead of regular milk. I was worried that it wouldn't be custardy enough, but the soy milk worked great. I whisked the ingredients in a bowl because I don't have a big enough food processor. Baked in a 9" square glass baking dish. The fruit layer floats up to the top. Very tasty, not too sweet. Baked 50 minutes and was perfect. I ate 3 pieces! :)

This was a delicious recipe! Made this recipe in a deep dish 10 inch pie plate. Served it warm with real whipped cream on top for breakfast. Added just a little extra sugar and a side of crispy bacon. Yummy!  This recipe says it serves 8 but that would be a stretch.  It is just too good to divide in to such small portions.

Didn't have cinnamon, but it was still yummy.  The texture was perfect.  A not-to-sweet light dessert that will satisfy adult palates.

I made this with regular plums (not Italian ones) and lime zest instead of lemon. It turned out great. The flavor and texture strongly reminded me of sweet pancakes with plum syrup. Maybe that's how a clafouti is supposed to taste?

I had some extra plums so I thought this would be the perfect recipe to use those! The flan/tart consistency was excellent... I just found it a bit "eggy"... maybe that is because I did not have any vanilla...even though I tried to put a tad extra lemon zest and cinnamon... Maybe next time I will let the yolks pass through a sieve, as they say that the eggy smell is found in the yolk skin... Other than that this is a keeper!

Maybe I did something wrong because I made this a day before and a served it cold. In any case, the plums were fine, but mixture around it was jelly-like and lacked flavor.

In theory, I think this is a good recipe, but I found the contrast between the sweet batter and tart plums to be too much -- it was as though I was eating two different desserts at the same time. 
Will try again with blueberries or possibly peaches.

This is a yummy way to use up plums if they are in season and cheap.  I agree that it would be even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, as the plum skins are tart.  On other reviewers' recommendations, I only used 1 tsp. lemon zest, and it was plenty.  I also used heaping tablespoons of sugar, and the sweetness was just right.  I don't know what I did, but after coming out of the oven beautiful, mine fell.  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that I only had a 9 inch pie plate, so it was quite full.  I will probably do this again next summer, but usually I prefer the standard cake or pie recipes.

This recipe is so easy and delicious.  My family loved it.  I didn’t have any lemons for lemon zest but I did have a small orange so I added orange zest instead and it was delicious.

We really liked this. Didn't make many changes, Instead of just cutting the plums in half, I cut them in fourths (or so) and covered the pan. Didn't have any lemon zest so I put a little lemon juice in it.
Update: I have since made this with rhubarb, blackberries and blueberries. So simple!

My co-worker was overrun with Italian Plums from her backyard tree, so I took some off her hands and began searching for recipes. I followed this recipe to the letter, baked for about 55 minutes, and it was perfection. It is not a very sweet dessert, which I enjoyed very much. The batter does not need any more sugar as some of the reviews have suggested. If you want something sweeter, go for a more traditional cake or crisp. The top and edges rose perfectly to a firm, golden brown while the center remained custard-like (similar consistency to flan). It was also incredibly simple and quick to put together. I would definitely make this again.

With a surplus of ripe golden plums I tried this several times within a couple of weeks (couldn't find my cookbook with my usual recipe for clafoutis).  Both times were good, but second time I used more flour and liked the firmer texture better.  I also substituted Splenda second time and it was great. I definitely recommend checking after about 35 minutes as it browns up quick near the end.  Once I even put some foil over it at the end.  I will definitely try with other ripe fruits.

Our plum tree went plumb crazy this year - what to do with all the fruit? Of the various recipes I found online, this one was THE BEST, at least to my and my husband's tastes. We really loved the custardy aspect of clafouti (I had never made it before!) and will definitely use this recipe again & again - maybe even trying it with other fruits.

Excellent version of a very easy dish.  I had no cinnamon the last time I made it, so put in a fair amount of freshly grated nutmeg and found this was even better than the cinnamon. I used whole milk also and French cake flour since I was in France at the time.  The result was a more custard-y clafouti, less stiff than usual.  I hope I will be able to duplicate that outcome now that I'm back home.

Followed the recipe exactly - looked pretty and smelled great.  Tasted ok.  I think the plums need to be really ripe and sweet for this to work.  Otherwise the Clafouti part was delicious.  Not sure if I will make this again or not.

Lovely flexible recipe - I did find that 375 was too high as mine scorched a little...have already passed this recipe on to my sister - great way to use fresh fruit! Took less than 50 min to bake.

This is a wonderful custard dessert.  Topped with a little whip cream (to help cut the tartness of plums).  The kids didn't like it but hubby and I ate the whole thing.  Yummy cold or hot!!

I took this to a potluck and only was left with a small piece.  Flavor and texture were great.  Just slightly watery but I did not use the Italian plums.

This was very easy and delicious. I don't even like plums and I had a large helping of it. I left out the lemon zest (thought I had a lime but was wrong) and used whole wheat flour. My plums weren't ripe but the calfouti was really good. My husband and I are enjoying saying "calfouti", too.

Quick, easy way to use up an abundance of ripe plums.  Used just 1tsp of lemon zest and didn't dust with powdered sugar.  Still tasted great - not too sweet.  Interesting texture.  Will definitely make again, possibly with some different fruit combinations.

Had lots of organic plums to use up. Turned out great. A bit like a Dutch Baby pancake. I substituted 4T fructose for the 6T sugar. came out nice.

This turned out well, but I don't think I'm a huge fan of plums or clafouti.  This was my first time making clafouti, and it's very eggy.  Hubby said it tasted like French toast!  Anyway, it was good, but not for my taste.

This recipe is great with extra plums. I admittedly, tried it when nectarines and other fruit in the middle and had plums around the edge and plums definitely make it the best. The top browned deeply and firmed really fast so I got confused about the timing as it says 'until firm and lightly browned.. however it wasn't properly cooked. It is also wise to properly halve the plums (I know it says this, but I didn't do this) so that the plums are sortof peek out the top almost. There was a little too much batter I think :)

I was intrigued to see how this would turn out. It's like a big fruit popover. Very similar to a Dutch baby or a German pancake. Maybe a bit cakier. I wasn't a huge fan of the lemon flavour from the lemon zest, but that's just a personal preference. This is a nice use for fresh plums and very easy to make.

I don't know what happened with this recipe, but it didn't turn out for me AT ALL!  I am training as a pastry chef and the head pastry chef left this recipe for me.  It is the only recipe to date that has been a total disaster.  The servers wouldn't serve it - they wouldn't even EAT it!!  It looked bad, had a horrible texture, and when I tasted it, it was really bland.  I honestly don't know what happened - based on the other reviews it was probably human error - but I don't plan to try this one again.

I'm so glad I gave this recipe a try; I'd never come across a baked good like this before, and wasn't sure what to expect.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was very easy to prepare.  Warm from the oven, or room temperature - it was great. Thanks for sharing a winner!  Can't wait to make it again.

I think mine wasn't done quite enough.  I gave it 50 minutes (at least) in the convection oven.  Maybe I did something wrong along the way.  It tasted great and the bottom was a really good pasty crust, but the whole thing didn't hold together too well. I used greengage plums which might be sweeter than the italian variety, so it was sweet enough without adding more sugar.   I'd never heard of clafouti (nor had my dinner guests), so it was a little scary making it the first time, but it's worth it to try it again, since we have an abundance of plums this time of year.

Excellent Clafouti.  I made mine using fresh cherries.  Yum!!!  You can substitute with just about any fruit and it will come out delicious.  The batter taste very custardy....delicious!!

I was so nervous about trying this recipe, but it was SO easy and I've never made any dessert that wasn't of mix from a box. I used about 6 California Red Plums and they were amazing. When you got to the plums and they opened the color inside was bright orange- a really pretty summer dish. The cakey part is almost spongelike and very light. I paired this with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of homemade whipped cream. After laying the halved plums, I sprinkled some brown sugar over the plums as well as reg. sugar. Also, before you put the whole thing in the over, try sprinkling some cinnamon over it. It made the top crust a little darker and so much better. The sprinkled confection sugar on top isn't necessary and neither is the lemon zest.

Easy, beautiful and delicious!  I had a couple plums sitting in my fruit bowl that didn't look so fresh anymore, so I wanted to cook 'em somehow.  I didn't know what the heck a clafouti was - but it's custardy fruity pudding.  I liked the eggy part a lot, and next time I'm going to have some more of it.  I'd scaled down the recipe to two servings, which used less than one egg, so I used one medium-small egg.  I'm also going to try more fruits!

SO simple & really yummy. We needed to use up some plums that a neighbor gave us and I made 3 "pies" like this...fantastic! I could have eaten an entire pie in 1 sitting...with or without ice cream this stuff is so good. And the fact that it only takes a few minutes to prep is great. Really does taste like bread pudding which is a big plus!

I made the recipe as it was. It came out great. It was quick to make, and I had lots of plums. The only thing I left out was the confectioners' sugar on top.  It doesn't need it, and I don't like confectioners' sugar dusted on stuff.  Will definitely make again.

This was stellar! I used regular plums (I'm assuming Italian prune style plums are smaller?) and only got 7 of them into a 10" pan, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I'd recommend a sheet pan under your pan, mine dripped all over the bottom of my oven. Worth it!

I substituted the flour for Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free 1to1 Baking Flour and it came out excellent!  Will make again when my plum tree fruits again.

Disclaimer:  I did not have any plums, but an abundance of ripe peaches, instead.  My rating is for the recipe I made.  I mostly followed the recipe, substitution of peaches for plums.  I didn't measure the peaches, covered the bottom of the dish.  Would suggest next time to butter the dish.  Used a combination of Splenda and sugar to watch the calorie content.  Used low fat milk.  Omitted the lemon, as I am not a lemon lover.  Baked per direction and time.  I thought it was a lovely, light, healthful dessert.  Thanks for the idea.

Really easy and good clafouti recipe.  I used regular black plums and cut them into 1 inch pieces.  I used a scant 1/4 cup of sugar, and added some unsweetened almond milk to make up the difference in regular milk.  Although you can clafout almost any fruit, plums are my favorite! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't follow the recipe as written.

This was as delicious and easy as everyone said. My plums were very tart so I didn't need any lemon. The sweetness was just right. Great recipe!

We have an italian plum tree and I am always looking for new ways to use plums. Love-- love this one. I especially like that it is not to sweet. The richness comes from the eggs.

This was excellent.  I try not to use too much sugar, so cut the sugar for the batter to 2 Tbsp instead of 3.  It tasted just right to me.  Also, I had some sour cream in my fridge, so added that to the milk to make up the required amount of milk.

I omitted the lemon zest and used scant 4 tablespoons sugar sprinkled over the prunes.  It was a nice sweet-sour ratio.  If I did put in the zest, I would probably only put a half a teaspoon in just to give it a fresh kick.  The top was nicely browned, though it seemed a bit runny - even after letting it cool for the five minutes before serving but it was more custard like than raw batter.  Waiting to see how it is after a thorough cool down.  Vanilla ice cream or whipped 
cream would make it even better!

Easy and excellent. Our plums from the farm are always a bit tart for this (esp. With added lemon zest) so I find we either need to cut a bit of zest, use more sugar on them, or serve with vanilla ice cream to cut the tartness.

Followed the recipe exactly and everyone enjoyed  it!  The sides raised higher then the center, but it turned out fine regardless looking a bit odd. Used ripe plums and they came out soft not runny after cooking.  Easy to make and we thought that it had the right amount of sweetness.

I trimmed back a bit on the sugar, but it was still a great dish. We didn't like how big the plums were the first time we had it so we cut them in quarters the second time and loved the results. Wow! Nature sure has a way of outdoing anything we can do in real life. Yum!

As I am not familiar with Clafouti - can't rate it against any traditional dessert.  But it was an easy dessert to make - I used plums from my stepdaughter's farm - just to help her with the overbundance.   It was a hit and I will definitely make this again.  Thank you

This recipe was super simple and super delish.  I had regular red plums which are bigger than prune plums, so I only used 10 of them.  I also used a tart pan instead of the pie pan.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I made it for unexpected company and it was a perfect desert.  Sweet but still light enough to make it a perfect summer treat.  Everyone loved the clafouti.  I will put it on my must make again list.

Stunningly different!  We had some plums that were getting a bit iffy.  And this recipe turned them into something that my kids loved.  My 14yo gave it 20 stars.  Easy to make because you only use a blender to whirl the stuff up and pour it over the fruit that you've cut up into the pan.  Yum!

I needed to use up some Italian plum preserves from last season and thought I'd give this recipe a try. I drained the syrup off the plums and skipped the step of sprinking sugar on the bottom of the pan and on the plum layer. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Though I am sure it is better with fresh plums, we still enjoyed it very well with canned prunes. This is a nice, not-too-sweet recipe; a keeper!

Very easy to make, and very yummy!!! Omitted the lemon zest (it's only for smell anyway) and didn't exactly measure the powdered sugar on the top. We have a plum tree in the backyard that has a ton of plums so this was perfect! The plums are difficult to halve and pit, but well worth the effort.

This was pretty good - I added a little extra sugar (plums are too sour for my husband's taste)...  but we decided it was better cold the next morning for breakfast than it was warm.

WONDERFUL!!! Added a bit more sugar, and it still wasn't super sweet at all.  I loved this and even my chocolate-preferring family thought it was very good!

This tasted pretty good but I wasn't aware that a clafouti was a custard like cake. I am not that fond of custard cakes so I am only giving it 3 stars. I would have preferred the plums with a regular white cake or a shortcake recipe.

Something different to do with Italian plums...and I liked that it is fat-free!  I used half as much cinnamon for my husband's sake, but he was not wild about it anyway.  However, I thought it was delish at room temp and just had a "cold" piece for my lunch, minus the powdered sugar.

I agree with SMALKA's review.  I was so looking forward to a delicious desert but sadly, was rather disappointed.  It was bland and lacked flavor.  The batter definitely needed more sugar! I don't like desserts that are too sweet, but this was barely sweet.

I had bought a mixture of plums at our local farmers market and decided to cook this recipe, to surprise my family, on Sat.  Quite delicious, the cinnamon and lemon zest are a great addition to the custard.  It was good the next evening too!!!!

I liked it. However, my family didn't eat it and I had to finish most of it myself. It was nice to start a day with the a slice of clafouti.

Tasty even with skim milk.  Used orange rind instead of lemon.  Came out a bit watery from ripe plums.  Tart like a rhubarb pie.

Absolutely fantastic! Used half vanilla extract and half almond extract, and only used 6 plums, but otherwise made exactly as specified. Served with whipped cream.

This was pretty good.  I used apricots and blueberries instead of plums, but I likes the clafouti.  It is like custard/cake and is really good for breakfast because it isn't too sweet.

Easy enough to make, and looked great.  But the taste was a bit strange -- too lemony, perhaps.
