Very light and fluffy. I made this recipe several times. I like to add jalape√±o peppers. A little bit of cheddar cheese. Thank you for sharing this awesome and very easy recipe.

Great any time of day.  I add shredded cheese on the last 30 seconds in the microwave. I also added a tsp. of hot sauce to give it a bit of a tang. I very much like the convenience of this meal.

Added the pat of butter at the beginning and cheese near the end, as reviews recommended.

Our kitchen is torn apart and we were hungry for a hot breakfast this morning.  Made these scrambled eggs & heated precooked sausages at the same time.  Had fresh fruit as side.  Excellent breakfast.  As a bonus the eggs & sausage were done at the same time.

I add a pat of butter & shredded cheese to them at the beginning. I prefer them in the microwave over stove top. They are so good and fluffy.

Perfect method to scramble eggs!  For a single serving I use a soup mug.
