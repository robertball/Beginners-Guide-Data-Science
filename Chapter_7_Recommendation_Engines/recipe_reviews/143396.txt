Great wonton - garlicky and gingery! You do not need to cook the pork as mentioned in the other review - it will cook thoroughly in the hot oil. If you follow this recipe as written, using 1T filling per wonton, you will use exactly 1/2 of the 12oz pkg of wonton wrappers. 1T is about as full as you would want a wonton to get, so you could cut the filling per wonton in half to fill all of the wrappers. I'm sure mincing tenderloin in the food processor for this is lovely, but I used purchased ground pork because I'm a cheapskate about grinding expensive cuts of meat. I followed the rest as written - very nice. Thanks!

Make sure to cook pork before hand. This recipe is good with potsticker dipping sauce which is one part soy sauce 2 parts rice vinegar.

Quite tasty.  I cook them in about 3/4" of oil in a large skillet, turning once - you don't really need that much oil to cook these.

We have quite a few neighbors who make lumpia and this was a very close recipe.  I added 1 cup carrots and 1 cup celery shredded and used canola oil instead of the peanut oil.  We dip them in a spicy sweet and sour sauce, yummy!

These were great.  Spicy enough to keep me happy but not overly so that my boyfriend wouldn't eat them (he doesn't care for super spicy foods).  I made them again a few days ago and instead of frying all of them, I steamed half of them in a bamboo steamer and made them into dumplings...they were fantastic that way too.  Thanks for sharing!

I love these fried won tons with duck sauce. Just like they make in the restaurants. While I'm at I usually make egg rolls and Asian chicken wings.
