These are fantastic. Next time I would prepare the liquids separately as the other reviewer suggested. I baked them on parchment paper. I would definitely recommend that. I found no need for the salt. I left it out and didn t miss it at all.

I cut the sugar in half and they turned out very tasty. I m not sure if it s because I cut sugar out but they were more like a muffin top not like a cookie. They were great right out of the fridge!

I needed a recipe to use up some carrots & came across this recipe. It was perfect! Used exact ingredients so subs the only difference is I mixed all dry in one bowl & all wet into another & then added all the wet to the dry. They came out great!!! Really good recipe thanks for sharing:) Kiddos loved them
