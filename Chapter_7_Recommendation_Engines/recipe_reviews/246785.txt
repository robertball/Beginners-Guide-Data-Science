Loved this soup! I subâ€™d asparagus for green beans  & used baby bellas because that is what I had in the fridge. Everyone loved it, I plan to make it again & again this winter.

We really liked this - well, everyone but me.  I'm not a huge green bean fan, so I've substituted other vegetables.  This makes a really good breakfast for school days, and my daughter loves the version with green beans.

I didn't add green beans and I substituted a few things, but it turned out great. I highly recommend this recipe to boost immunity when you feel you have a cold coming on.

I had some miso paste needed to use, so I thought I could give this a try. I liked the broth, but didn't like the green beans in it. If making it again I would add some broccoli instead of the green beans. Thanks for sharing though:)
