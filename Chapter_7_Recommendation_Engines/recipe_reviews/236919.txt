My goodness, this reminds me of Lenten suppers, afternoons when I was sick, and quiet moments with just my mom and me.  But, you absolutely, positively must have frozen baby peas added to the recipe, and if you are feeling rich, then butter your toast before adding the creamed tuna.  This is pure comfort food for me, it was something that really only my mom and I liked.  The rest of the family are it, but only because there was nothing else.  I loved it, and I still do, but my own children won't touch it.   I still make this when I'm sad or lost; my mom has been dead for 20 years, but she's at the table with me when I serve myself this dish.  Thank you for posting a happy memory for me.

Our stories sound much alike except my dad passed away and times were tough with just mom also in the 70's. She would make this, but she always added a can of peas. I liked it as a kid and then I made it for my kids, now it's just hubby and me at home and I still make it now and again. It's quick and cheap. I looked your recipe up today to see if I others added something special to make it better. When I read your recipe I though no need, but I did add half a chopped onion.

I have been amazed to see that nobody else adds chopped boiled eggs to their creamed tuna!  I usually double this recipe and add 4 chopped boiled eggs. Delicious, and an inexpensive way to add good protein and stretch and already an expensive meal  I have been amazed to see that nobody else adds chopped boiled eggs to their creamed tuna!

It's so funny but I made this just last night for dinner. I always thought I was the only person on earth that ate this growing up in the 70's. and then I just now stumbled upon the recipe on here today. I come from a huge catholic family and my mom made this probably once a week. We all loved it then as kids and most of my siblings still make this now as adults.. My mom always served this with white rice. She often made the creamed sauce from scratch but in a pinch you can substitute cream of mushroom soup which is just as tasty. I make it the same way my mom taught me with diced celery, peas, parsley and dill, I also use at least 3 cans of tuna with the water its packed in, this really boosts the flavor. This is a really forgiving recipe and you can use ingredients in any amounts that suit your own personal taste. I highly recommend this served with the white rice instead of toast.

thank you! I loved this growing up and was trying to find the recipe that uses milk and not condensed cream soups and this is it!  The only change I make is to add fresh or frozen peas.

I found this recipe and decided to make it for my hubby, as he had never had this before. How sad really, he never  experienced one of the ultimate comfort foods!  This dish transported me back 40 years! Just like my mother’s! My dear mother just turned 86 years young and guess what I’m making for the next family dinner!

I too ate this growing up and make it frequently still! The only real difference to mine is that I add celery seasoning. I'll try the peas next time!

This reminds me of growing up in the 80's or having a tuna casserole. I made a couple of modifications to the recipe. I added 1/4 of a finely chopped onion and 1/4 of a finely chopped apple to the butter and caramelized them before adding the flour.

Love this! Had this all the time growing up and was craving it this week. This is the exact recipe my mother would make, but depending on what we had laying around the house, she would sometimes throw in a handful of cheese or peas at the end. Also, super cheap to make which is always a plus

Another YES YES! vote for a well loved childhood comfort food memory. Coming home from school on a Friday afternoon...the whole house smelled like lemon pledge cause my Mom cleaned  house on Fridays, and we always had this recipe of creamed tuna on toast served with pasta and tomato sauce. What a carbolicious and lovely memory! (PS She sometimes added onions.)

I didn't have peas to add so I sauteed some celery in the butter before adding the flour. Turned out really good. Everyone had seconds.

This was a dish my mom made in the '60's when my dad was working late and it was just my sibs and mom.  Dad..ah no way! 
This is "dressed up" from our version, no peas please and would you believe we put it over saltine crackers!!!  Love it still and make it only when I'm home alone cuz no one else will touch it.  That's OK with me.  They don't know what they are missing!

Exactly as how I remembered when I was a kid. I always ate mine over mashed potatoes.

I did use two 4 oz cans of drained tuna instead of one 5 oz can;  it turned out to be the perfect amount of tuna to cream base. My mom also mentioned that she likes putting fresh grated Parmesan cheese into the cream base (before the tuna is added) for an extra layer of flavor. 

The people who can't get past the "look" of this dish  are really missing out.  Yum!

Amazing! My mom made this for me growing up in the 80s and 90s. I honestly thought she had made it up out of items in the pantry. The recipe is exactly like this, except she also adds a can of peas and serves it over mashed potatoes. It may be plain and simple, but it's my ultimate comfort food.

This isn't gourmet, but it is delicious. Like the other reviewers said, this was one of my mom's recipes that helped feed a large family on a small budget. I prefer it over a baked potato.

I remeber this as a kid! I added 4 spring onions chopped and let them sweat with the butter before adding flour. I also added a can of peas, 2 boiled eggs crumbled and 1/4 cup sharp cheddar. Topped with paprika and parsley.

I made mine over garlic mashed potatoes with one red Hatch chili pepper.  when I began, I poured about a cup of frozen peas into a strainer to defrost.  I added the peas after adding the tuna.   The liquid wasn't getting thick enough so I added about two shakes of arrowroot, prior to adding the tuna and peas.  That worked perfectly!  Would I make this again, absolutely!

I, too, ate this almost weekly as a child. I did change the recipe to improve. I sautéed diced onion in butter, added half of milk and all of flour in jar with lid and shook to combine. Added milk mixture to onion and butter, whisked to combine then added remainder of milk then whisked again. When thickened, added tuna, seasonings and frozen peas to taste. Served over hot biscuits. Cheap, easy and tasty.

We in New England call this Tuna Pea Wiggle, served over saltines.  Did not try it, but love the idea of adding a smidge of minced onion.  Do add a pinch of garlic powder if you find is bland.  This was a weekly meal when I was growing up in the 70's.  One of my favorites.

Sorry, not my thing.  I found it very bland.  Tried adding lots of pepper, some seasoning salt and even some parmesan as others suggested after tasting it.  Wasn't inedible,  but won't be making again.

My mom made this for me growing up in the 80s. Always my favorite when I was little. Even as an adult I ask her to make it for me. Guess I should learn how to make it myself but it's just not the same unless mom makes it.

Like taking a trip back in time to Mama's table in the 70's.    Oh, how I loved that dish, and it's still just as delicious! A fun, fast, easy dinner. 
(Cut the recipe in half and skip the tuna to make a side dish - or snack - of yummy cream peas.)

Great for a supper on a busy day. Sauted some onion with the melting butter; used only a cup of milk to make the sauce. Added frozen peas and carrots, served over leftover corn muffins. Would work over leftover potatoes.

I searched for this just to see if my mom's recipe would be here. Your recipe as written is exactly the same. I've never met anyone else outside of my family that makes this. I loved it as a kid and now my 18 yr old daughter makes it all the time, sometimes better than I do.

This is the same recipe that I grew up on in the 50's that my mom would make and my children grew up loving as well. Im still making it today for my Grandchildren.  The only thing we do differently is add chopped up hard boiled eggs.  Yumm try it.

Very nice comfort food; altho a bit bland for our tastes.  I finely diced some onion and sauted until soft, then added some fresh garlic and celery salt. I added this mixture to the sauce.  Served over mushroom ravioli which was a delish combo.  Brussel sprouts on the side. Will make again!

Mmm. Comfort food.  
We used to eat creamed canned peas on toast when I was young... Albacore Tuna was a treat  haha 
Made this recipe tonight over potatoes. 
Only thing I changed was I used some Old Bay Seasoning and added some sautéed carrots and celery.

Delicious! An older cousin used to make this for me as a child and it was my favorite dish. Recently I was craving it as a comfort food but although there are versions using cream of mushroom or celery soup, they don't taste the same. In fact they're not worth making. But this is dish is perfect!! The only change I made was to use frozen corn as I didn't have peas. But otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. Thank you for sharing it.

On its face, sounded like a deconstructed tuna salad, but warm for cold winter nights. To test I cut the milk down 1/2 C but kept everything else the same. I added a slice of provolone to give it the tuna melt experience. Season generously!

i love it. I balked at the idea of creamed tuna at first because I usually use chipped beef when I make a cream sauce. My fiancé suggested adding tuna instead. I like to mix it up between toast and chicken flavored rice.  Very satisfying. I always add a cup of frozen peas, although next time, I may add a can of mushrooms and some corn as well as the peas
