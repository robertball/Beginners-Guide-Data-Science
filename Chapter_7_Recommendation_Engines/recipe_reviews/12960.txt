I'm quite surprised this recipe is called "Moroccan" as the significant ingredients aren't used in Moroccan cooking (my hubster is Moroccan so I know Moroccan cooking).  With that said - I altered the recipe as follows:  I used brown (aka green) lentils as these are more traditional (and added a handful of red lentils for texture), 1 heaping tablespoon of ginger paste, 1 can of red kidney beans, 1 can northern white beans, 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can stewed tomatoes.  Do NOT use cardamom or garam masala (these are INDIAN spices not Moroccan).  I strongly recommend salt/pepper to taste, cumin, and RAS EL HANOUT.  Ras el hanout is a classic blend of Moroccan spices - similar to garam masala but different.  Ras el hanout varies from one Moroccan to another but generally it's the following spices (usually whole spices all ground together but you can use the ground versions as well):  
>>
I pressure cooked everything together for about 10 minutes and voila - delicious!  Here's a helpful cooking tip:  If cooking on the stove (or even the crockpot)- the lentils will cook faster if you do NOT add the salt or tomatoes until the end... salt and the acidity of the tomatoes prevents beans/lentils from softening which will prolong the cooking time.  ***UPDATE*** Recipe with Indian spices is good too - make sure to double the spice though.

Upon sampling this soup, my morrocan husband stated, "something is in there that doesn't belong in there."  When i rattled off the list of spices he said the Garam Marsala didn't belong, although he stated it was good. For an authentic morrocan taste, substitute "Rus Al Hanoot" for the Garam Marsala.  GM is a blend of indian spices, while Rus Al Hanoot is a blend of morrocan spices.

This soup has an excellent Indian flavor. Some friends walked into the house just after I started to boil the soup and they commented on the wonderful aroma that filled the house! I used brown lentils instead of red, I used red kidney beans instead of cannellini (which is white kidney beans), and I diced my own carrots, tomatoes, and celery. Fresh is always better than canned! I also used bagged beans instead of canned because of the higher nutritional value bagged beans have, so I had to let the soup cook longer (I made it around 8 AM and it was ready by 9 PM. I didn't have any cardamom so I used 3/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 3/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. Garam masala is a spice combo of cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper, so you don't really need more garam masala... A great taste!

This is good, and so easy.  I did it in the crockpot, and didn't sautee anything beforehand, just threw it all in (no oil).  Sadly, I forgot to buy fresh ginger so I just used dried.  I had brown lentils, so I used those instead, but am interested in trying the red.  I used 4 cups (a carton) of veggie broth and 2 cups water.  Cooked in my crockpot for about 12 hours on low, and it was perfect.  Thick and yummy.  I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of garam masala because I love it.  I only used a sprinkle of cayenne.  Served with warm mini wheat pitas from Trader Joe's.

i love lentil soup, it always makes me feel so healthy eating it.  and this one did not disappoint.  i made a couple of alterations as others did i used chicken broth instead of plain water.  i did increase the garam masala and garlic.  i stretched the soup by using one cup of red lentils and one cup of brown.  increased the broth by a few cups and added 10 oz. box of frozen spinach in the last 15 minutes.  i also sauteed some hot italian sausage for my husband, so he thinks he's getting a full meal.  but i didn't add that to the soup, just put his bowl of soup.  this is different from my usual lentil or curried lentil and i would recommend it to everyone.  thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent soup - very aromatic and flavorful.  However, a bottle of ground cardamom cost nearly $13  Since it was the first time using this spice, I was reluctant to spend that much.  Was able to purchase only the amount I needed from the bulk section of a health food store.

I really should have liked this more than I did.  The combination of garam masala and cardamon were just overwhelming to me.  I had made a big batch & ended up giving it to friends who loved it.  I would recommend using half the spice levels, then increasing if you like.

This is good with a few additions/subtractions.  I used turkey broth I had in the fridge instead of water.  I also didn't add the garam marsala, as this is not a traditional North African spice, more of an Indian spice.  I added traditional Tunisian chili powder (Harissa) and did not bother to puree, as the red lentils basically helped thicken it, and I like a 'meatier' soup.  This is a nice soup during the winter, and a new soup for me to make for my husband during the Ramadan season.

This was an excellent soup! I used whole cardamom seeds instead of the ground cardamom, which resulted in a very strong flavor and aroma.  Perfect for those who love African and Indian spices. I will definitely make this soup again.

Pretty good...nice & spicy.  It made a good meal with some rice.  I cooked it in 
a slow cooker which made it a lot easier...I didn't have to worry about stirring it 
on the stovetop.  Also, I used chicken broth and water instead of just water.

At first bite, this seemed bland. However, the spices give an excellent after taste, and that's what really matters. I did find I liked it better with a bit of salt. Next time I may try replacing at least some of the water with beef broth.

This was really good.  I cooked the onions and garlic on top of the stove before throwing everything in to my slow cooker for 2 hours on high + 8 hours on low.  I rounded all of my spoon measurements for alittle extra kick.  At the last hour I poured half into my blender and returned it to the slow cooker to cook for the remainder of the time.  When serving, I add 1-2 tbsp of raisins for a nice sweet taste.

This was yummy. I followed a suggestion to use RAS EL HANOUT. in place of GARAM MASALA. Turned out very yummy. Next time I'll cook the carrots and celery with the onion, garlic and ginger before adding the rest of the ingredients. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really delicious, but I made a few small changes. First, soak your own beans (I just used garbanzos) and use the soaking water for your soup stock! It is deliciously flavored and full of antioxidants. Next, saute the onion, garlic, ginger, AND ALL the spices. This will enhance their flavor. Also, about the spices, I didn't have garam masala, so I pretty much improvised the entire spice aspect and it was delicious. I used: 1/2 tsp curry, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cinnamon. With the liquid, I added 3 cardamom pods (cheaper than ground; bought in bulk at farmer's market; no matter what state it's in, don't skip this - it's unique!) and 2 bay leaves. I simmered mine only 45 minutes, but I let it sit longer to let the flavors meld. Also, sprinkle a little salt at the end if you don't use canned ingredients - you'll end up with a more fresh-tasting final dish! I served this over brown rice with toasted, buttered crusty baguette. Comfort food, Moroccan style!

Wow!  This was great!  My first time using cardamom and garam masala.  It reminded me
of some of the dishes at my favorite indian restaurant.  I will definitely make this again.
The house smelled wonderful.  I blended about 3/4 of the soup.  I think that next time
I will try over rice.

I made this for my DH last night and he absolutely loved it! Too spicy for me, but I tend to like blander foods.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 2 cans of low sodium beef broth and 2 cups of water instead of 6 cups of water as indicated in the recipe.

Made this recipe exactly as stated... It was fantastic. I will be making this one again. One thing I added was salt. I used 1/2 tsp and it needed a little more, so 3/4 tsp salt would work for me.

I looked up recipes for both Ras el Hanut and Garam Masala and found next to no difference what so ever. Also I looked up Moroccan Spices and found they use the same spice as in Indian cooking, hardly any difference at all. All the spices used in this dish are used in both Indian and Moroccan cuisine.

I love Moroccan food and this definitely reminded me of the lentil soup I have had in restaurants.  I did not have any beans but I added white sweet potato and it came out great.  The only problem I had was using 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I thought that was a too much.  I only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne and that was enough to give a bite to the back of my throat and bring tears to my eyes.

I threw all ingredients into a crock pot: 1 c brown lentils, 1 chopped onion, 1/2 c chopped carrot, 2 chopped potatoes, 1 can white beans, 14 oz crushed tomatoes, 1 quart chicken stock, 1 cup water, 2 t minced garlic, 1/2 t gr ginger, 2 t. garam masala, 1/2 t cayenne, 1/2 t cumin. Set to low and cooked 12 hrs. House smells like heaven. Didn't add cardomom because I didn't have any, but I sure will next time. Thank you Grace and Mae for expanding my Meatless Monday menu!

Fantastic recipe with great nutritional values.  A hit at my church Souperbowls for Caring cooking competition (OK, it didn't win but a double batch sure did disappear quick enough).  I didn't change a thing except that I didn't bother to measure the fresh veges so my pot ended up being hearty!  I don't think using red lentils added anything and since these are harder to find, any lentil will do.

This was a really nice tasting soup - especially since I'm not the biggest lentil soup fan.  Very nice flavor although a touch on the bland side. I made "harissa sauce" - a hot Moroccan condiment - from another site and added a bit to the soup.  The soup went from good to great!  I did not blend the soup at all since the lentils were already thickening the soup.  And I think 1 to 1-1/2 hours is way too long to cook the soup.  I had mine done in less than 30 minutes.

I loved this.  My husband wasn't crazy about it, but I knew it was a stretch for him with this combination of flavors before I made it.  I made the recipe as is, except I doubled the carrots, celery, and cayenne pepper.  Next time I might add even more carrots and celery.

This came out much better than I thought it would but since I used different spices, I will only rate 4 stars. Changes I made: ras el hannout instead of garam masala. No cardamon seeds. 1.5-2 times the measurements for spices. 2 extra cups water. I didnt know you have to sort of "half mesh" it, so i blended it too fine, but the taste was still great, it is quite rich though, so I think its more a main than just soup :)

Regardless of whether or not this is "authentic Moroccan", it is still a good soup. The spices make it very interesting - I've never had a soup quite like it. Also, with 16 grams each of fibre and protein, it is one of the healthier soups I've made. It freezes very well, too. I'll make this again.

I made this soup in the crockpot, which may have taken away some of the tasty olive oil sautee flavor that you get with the onion and garlic usually. I will make on the stove if I decide to make it again. In any case, I just cannot understand how anyone thought this was bland!! It was extremely spiced, maybe too much, and believe me, I LOVE heavy spices and flavors. It would have been inedible with double the spices. I think the thing that threw me off was the cardamom. Next time I will leave this out. I also made the mango cardamom bread pudding for dessert with this and I can see how the spice tastes immensely better in baked goods and sweets. I added a teaspoon of curry powder (the cardamom was oddly sweet and I wanted the soup to be a little more savory), used a diced summer squash instead of celery, used chicken broth instead of water, and only used one can of red beans. Three stars because the spicing wasn't as tasty as I thought and slightly overpowering. I know lots of people love cardamom in this, but here's my advice if you aren't familiar with cardamom: Smell the spice, and if you don't love it, don't use it. I should have listened to my instincts when I smelled it and was a little put off.

I don't know about kids loving it, but I and my partner sure did!  This definately had Moroccan flavors.  It reminded me of a favorite lentil soup I get at my favorite Moroccan restaurant, slightly different, but very close.  I did need to add a bit of salt though, it was slightly bland w/ out it, I added about a teaspoon or so.  It was nice and thick and smelled incredible.  Thank you.

We have made this many times. It freezes well and also is good as leftovers from the fridge. We usually eat it with a flatbread. I always substitute chicken broth for the water -- it lends a richer flavor.

Excellent family fair -- the 10 year old and the two year old both devoured this soup. We did not find it bland, but I did buy my spices today (cheaper and fresher to buy the amont I need from the spice store).

It was my turn to cook for the weekly "Lost" night.  My one friend is a vegetarian and the other loves healthy stuff.  I pulled this from the site the other day, found all the necessary items quite easily at my grocery store, popped them in a croc pot in the morning before work and by the time I got home the soup was ready.  I pureed some of it in my blender as the receipie states and this makes the soup extra creamy. My friends thought it was fantastic, the spices in this really add to the taste, and it's easy to make. It's a fantastic soup -especially for the winter as its pretty hearty reminding me of pumpkin or squash soup.

This soup is the BEST! We love it. Rich, spicy, tasty and hearty. I make it often in large batches and freeze it in pre-portioned zip locked bags, but it really is simple enough to whip up if its just about dinner time and you've not given dinner any thought. Excellent.

I've made this twice now, and it never fails to cure my craving for lentils. The first time I made it, I didn't puree any of it, and this time, I pureed nearly all of it. Really, it tastes the same either way. Aside from pointing out that this isn't truly a Moroccan dish, as others have pointed out, (I don't think it's rude, I think it's more of using correct terminology) it's pretty good. It is bland in it's entrance, but a little sea salt right before serving helps a little with that, and also brings out some of the other flavors. I also only used 1/4 of the cayenne, since the heat overtook a lot of the other flavors. Next time I will use chicken broth instead of water. Maybe that will make it a 5!

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers on the whole Indian vs. Moroccan thing. I personally found it to lean more towards Indian flavours with the garam masala but it was a throughly enjoyable dish and it has been - per my family - put on the favorites list. I did modify a bit. I added a very small pinch of saffron, only used 1 tsp of fresh ground cardamom, used a mix of fresh and canned tomatoes, and put 1 small potato (cut in a fine dice) in about 20 min before it was done. I did not puree any of the soup as it was thick enough for my tastes. All in all a fantastic meal... Thanks for sharing!

A little too spicy for my taste but I think lessening the cayane pepper and the garam masala it should be alittle less spicy. Also we added some garlic salt to the end soup, and it added a little extra needed flavor.

This is truly an exceptional soup. Very tasty. Unfortunately, I did not have all the canned beans when I wanted to make this, so I boiled 5 kind beans and used that with the lentils. This is definitely a keeper.

This was my first attempt at indian food (from what other reviewers are saying, it's not really Moroccan) and it was fantastic. My husband and I finished the whole pot in 2 meals. I only altered 2 things, I added some homemade chicken stock (about 1 1/2 cups), if I hadn't I think it would have been too thick to be a "soup"....and I used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of diced. When I seperated the soup to blend, I made sure to include all the big tomatoe chunks, so that they were completely pureed. My husband said he couldn't wait to eat it again the second night...and it was even better than the first night.

I made this in the slow cooker and had to make a few subs based on preference and what I had on hand - beef broth instead of water, pinto beans instead of cannellini, green & red bell peppers instead of carrots & celery (the beans & peppers may sound weird, but it tasted great!). I doubled the spices except the cardamom and cayenne. I sauted the veggies and added everything to the slow cooker except the tomatoes and set to low for about 6 hours.  I added the tomatoes and set to high for 1 hour, half with the top on, half with top off.  Excellent!

I just made this soup and it turned out great!  Even my dad,  who prefers traditional Indian food, enjoyed it.  I made some alterations to the recipe based on what I had in stock.  I used red kidney beans instead of the cannellini beans.  I doubled the amount of ginger and garlic. Used red pepper instead of cayenne. And I didn't have much garam masala left so I added some Chaaat masala (this is also a blend of indian spices & it gives a little bit of a sweet and sour taste).  Finally I increased the amount of celery and carrots and added some zucchini! This had more of an Indian flavor but I look forward to making it with the traditional Moroccon spices next time!

This is very delicious, but tasted more like chili than soup.  I agree with many of the commenters that this is more of an Indian recipe than a Moroccan one.  Still, very very tasty!

I was hesitant to add the garam masala after reading some reviews. I held it back until the last so I could taste it without. Then I added it and I thought it was great. My dh liked it too. and the cayenne added just enough heat. I'll make this again.

I agree with many of the reviews, I found it rather bland. If you want this to be truly vegetarian, do not use the chicken broth, but vegetable broth, I did this and added 2 more cups of water since I did not want a stew, but a nice soup.   I doubled the carrots and celery & I only blended 1/4 of the recipe, since I would rather have the nice pieces of carrot and celery! I did not use as much cayenne since I think this is a rather harsh spice, but I added abit more cumin & a special mixture of Moroccan and Indian spices I found at the open market in Den Haag, Netherlands... and FRESH chopped coriander just before serving.  The leftovers I found better...a tasty soup for the chilly autumn and winter nights! I will make it again...very nutritious!

We loved this soup. I didn't have all the spices so I used a curry spice which contained most of what was called for. Also I added a cup of shredded chicken breast and used 2 cans of pinto beans (what was in the pantry). I am not a fan of putting soup in the blender, but it was worth it. I also added salt as suggested and it really made a difference. Served with homemade bread. Great!

This is a wonderful soup! There is no way I can pass a vegetarian dish over on my carnivore boys, so I had to add 2 cups roasted chicken meat. I love the flavor combinations of the vegetables and spices. I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

This is possibly the best lentil soup I have ever tasted!!  I made some changes as I did not have all the ingredients.  I used nutmeg and cinnamon instead of the cardomom, and curry powder instead of garam masala.  I also used a package of onion soup mix.  This was so tasty and full of flavour!!!

I improvised with yellow split peas instead of lentils, and I added cauliflower. This soup is fantastic with a dollop of yogurt stirred in and fried pappads crumbled into each bowl. Mmmmmmmm....

I found it too heavy on the beans & not that great on taste. I may be alone but I find putting Cardamon in a recipe is like putting in a few drops of perfume - it doesn't make my taste buds water.

This recipe was EXCELLENT! I have many international friends who cook great food but don't measure and or aren't sure of spice names in English - this recipe solves that! My husband loves it and so do I! I did add salt per another reviewers suggestion (good idea) and ground ginger (not fresh) worked fine also. Could not find cannellini beans (was in a rush at the store) so I used canned navy beans - tasted great! Also, preferred a smooth texture so pureed the whole batch. THANK YOU Grace & Mae! Will make again and again - very tasty with fresh bread or pita and a salad.

Liked most ingredients, but as some other reviews commented, the Garam Masala does not belong so subtituted Moroccoan spices.  Of course the face that my husband doesn t like this spice had soe bearing on my changes.  For some reason or another I feel that lentil type soups should have North African spices.

Nice and spicy lentil soup here loaded with vegetables!  Moroccan or not Moroccan - who cares. It tastes great!  I did use chicken broth instead of water as others have suggested.

Great. My husband wants to have grid again. Also 4 kids I served it to ate it up. I left out the tomatoes bc I didn't have any. I subbed the recommended moroccan seasoning blend rather than garam masala.

this was nice and easy.  its still basically a bean/lentil soup, but the flavor was a nice change for me.  i served it with pomegranite/spinach salad with balsamic viniagrette (both from this site), and i think it would be nice served with cornbread also.

I made this last night and it was delicious. I did change some things, like adding kidney beans instead of garbonzos, curry powder instead of garam masala, and adding part water and part chicken broth. It was very easy, and everyone absolutely loved it!! thanks for the recipe, I will make it again!!

one of the best vegetarian soups, easily a main meal.  Very aromatic and just the right spice and heat.  Used 4 cups chix broth/2 cups water and was generous with the spices based on reviews.  Turned out great and will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

****Excellent!  I really liked the consistency with only half of it pureed in blender and then mixed with the other non-pureed half.  I also used brown lentils and just added a handful of red ones.

Great recipe. I made a few changes. I added some Moroccon spices I had bought in Morocco with the cumin, cinnamon, saffron. 1/2 green lentils with red lentils and ceci beans. As you can see...there's no way to ruin this recipe! My kids loved it!!!

This was really delicious.  The first soup I've made with a real Indian/Moroccan flavor. I don't know why people feel compelled to change the spices so much - if you use fresh ones, it's plenty spicy. I did double the ginger though since it's so much soup and I love ginger. I also felt like I wanted to add salt, but instead of doing that I added a TBS of lemon juice - that gave it a bit more depth with no sodium.   Anyway, I really love this recipe. You will too.

Delicious!  The only thing that I would recommend adding is a little bit of seasoning salt.  That made it a little more flavourful, in my opinion.  This is from someone who generally finds many foods really salty.  Otherwise you can leave it as is and it is delicious.

Wish you could give 1/2 stars... this is a 4 1/2 stars recipe. Very good.  I love a recipe that make me feel like I'm blowing my diet.  This is a very hearty soup/stew.  Would be 5 stars with chix/veggie broth instead of water.  However, it would add a ton of salt.  As this 'rested', it was better and better.  A good, cheap, winter staple.  p.s. the second day, i served it with rice... yum.

This is SO good...I made some changes, but everyone loves it. I used 1 large onion instead of 2, used 4 cloves of garlic, double the carrots, chicken broth instead of water, kidney beans and white kidney beans instead of cannellini beans and pretty much double or tripled the cumin. I also omitted the garam masala because I couldnt find it, still delicious!

This is delicious.  I left out the garam masala and it still turned out FANTASTIC.  Perfect for vegans, too.  The only thing that kindo f happened to mine is that a lot of the liquids evaporated out.  It became more of a stew than a soup; but still delicious.  I recommend this to anyone.  Lots of fiber and protein!

This was easy and tastes great!  I used a can of Rotel plus the cayanne and the heat was perfect!  It makes a very large pot of soup though so you may want to cut it in half if you are just feeding yourself.

I have tasted this soup but have not yet made it. I had it at a 5 Star hotel in Eastern Canada; asked the chef what spices were in the soup and he very graciously gave me the recipe. In comparing to others online, I discovered it is exactly this recipe! Looking forward to making this.

Moroccan or not, this soup was great! I had some peas (half cup) and potatoes three small) I wanted to use and through them in. I like my soups salty and spicy so I added a bit more of all the spices and a dash (or two) of salt, a few pieces of bread and butter and what a dinner! Thanks :)

I love this soup, though I don't like pureeing half of it.. I prefer it all "whole" instead. Also I prefer the texture of using green lentils better than red ones. I've made this soup 4 times and tried both half pureed and not, and with just red lentils, just green ones and a combination of both.

My boyfriend however, thinks the soup is a bit too bland, that's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.

We liked this soup.  I did change the spices to the Moroccan mix suggested in the reviews but I suspect it would be equally delicious with the garam masala.  I also used dried beans instead of canned as I prefer them.  I also added a lot more veggies and garlic as we like very thick soups.  Excellent all around.

I don't care what this soup is named...it was SOOO GOOD! Instead of trying to "fix" this recipe to make it traditional Moroccan (as other commenters have done) why don't they just post their own moroccan soup recipe?!

I made this today and just cut the spice down a bit, my husband can't eat spicy foods and it is excellent. We both enjoyed it so much. Plus good for my Ornish reversal diet, I used Pam no olive oil.

Great soup! I don't use canned beans (I cook up raw ones before hand) so definitely had to add the suggested salt. Other then that this soup is pretty much perfect for a healthy, filling and tasty meal!

We thought this soup was very good.  Ok, it needs a little salt, but what soup doesn't?  I also used a can of the fire roasted tomatoes that another reviewer mentioned.  It's actually the only canned tomatoes I use b/c I liked the smokey flavor it imparts.  I followed the recipe exactly, except added salt to taste.  Then I sauteed a bunch of kale in garlic oil and added it to the finished soup. The bright green in the soup really makes it look pretty and helps to pump it up nutritionally.

This was good.  My husband really enjoyed it(he loves spice)!  I feel like it had more of an Indian taste than Moroccan though probably because of the garam masala(traditionally an Indian spice).  The Moroccan recipes I have don't have that spice in them, and do have cinnamon.  I will experiment with this some more.  Thanks for a good beginning.  I like that this soup  does not include any boullion or broth.  I am trying avoid using those too much in my soups.

I had really high hopes for this recipe.  I didn't make it past 3 bites before I reached for my spice rack.  Something in the spices was off.  I tried more garam masala in one bowl, some cinnamon in another bowl, and some allspice in a third bowl.  Still the flavor was off.  I like the legume and veggie base of this soup, and the texture was great, but I will have to play with the spices to find something that suits me.  Thanks for giving me a good place to start.

Recipe was great.  I just tweaked by using vegetable broth to keep vegetarian and added two cans of fire roasted tomatoes instead of one diced tomatoes.  Will make this recipe all winter.

Wow. This recipe is amazing.

I followed the recipe almost exactly as called for. I used one yellow and one red onion. I was a little heavy with the spices just because I like spices. And perhaps importantly, I used 4cups veggie stock + 2 cups water, not 6 cups water.

Absolutely outstanding. I'll be making this again.

Found this to be very delicious and healthy too.  I substiuted chicken broth for half of the water. Used about a teaspoon of Harrisa spice to further up the complexity of the flavor. I also added a 10 oz package of frozen sweet potatoes which added the element of a new texture and a new color.

Really yummy, a definate keeper. I upped the cayanne a little, I like things spicy! I also doubled the amount of lentils, which caused me to have to add some water also. It seemed more like a veggie soup with lentils, I wanted more of a lentil soup with veggies. I didn't puree it per some other members advice, and it turned out great! My honey loved it, and my sis even said it was really good. My culinary skills pale in comparrison to hers, so that compliment meant a lot, coming from her! I'll make this again and again! Thanks for the great recipe :-)

This is my all time favourite soup to make.My guests LOVE it because it tastes so hearty and creamy, even though there is no dairy added.  It's super healthy,yet you feel like you are eating a super fattening soup - I LOVE IT!!!!!!!  The taste and flavour of the spices are incredible and it tastes even better the next day.  I will make this soup over and over and over again - my absolute favourite! PLUS - its super easy to make!

I made this for my friend who is taking radiation/chemo treatments for brain cancer after her surgury.  She loved it.. freezes well, as she can't eat a lot at one time.. great for that high fiber/protien meal.   She liked heavy on the cayenne.. I like light on the cayenne. Excellent!! Thank you!

Excellent taste and easy to make. I had to do some substitutions because I did not have all the spices. I used 5 cardomam pods, 1 tsp curry, 1/2 tsp tumeric, some fresh corriander, 1 tsp ginger paste, dash salt, vegetable cube (which may not really have been needed.),2 cloves of fresh garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I served this with rice and fresh pita bread heated under the broiler.

Since I like a ton of flavor, I added powdered vegetable broth to the water, and extra garlic. The result was a rich, spicy, flavorful soup, and the cardamom in it is wonderful. Make sure you add enough salt to bring out the flavor. This recipe takes on a whole new level of greatness (in my opinion) when you stir in a dollup of plain yogurt to your bowl.  It is easy to eat healthy when you're able to find recipes like this!

This is a very flavorful and filling soup!  I served this with homemade bread bowls (probably not very Moroccan, but very tasty) and my family went crazy for it.  I loved the spices and flavor and have made it 2 times so far this month...its that good!  If you like flavor and aroma of cardamom, then I recommend trying this soup.  Thanks for the recipe Grace and Mae!!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes!!!  The first few times I made this I prepared it per the recipe & then made only a few changes to suit our flavor, only after tasting it per the original recipe.  
1) Two onions are way too many onions for this dish, I only use one & it's plenty.
2) I use brown or green lentils instead of the red as the red lentils get mushy very easily. We like the crunch/firmness of the less mushy lentils.
3) I don't cook olive oil at high heat, only use it for salad dressing as it becomes toxic if cooked at high heats.  I use coconut oil instead which is meant to be used for high heat/saute cooking. 
4) We also don't care for garbanzo beans so I use a 15 OZ can of dark red kidney beans instead along with the 19 OZ can of Cannellini beans.(It appears dark red kidney beans were used in the first photo on line)
5) I don't puree half the soup, we really like the full texture of the whole lentils, veggies etc.  
The spices in this dish are PERFECT!!  With just the right amount of heat etc....my husband LOVES his meat but he is happy eating this dish at least two times per week!!!  Sometimes we have this dish with the Far East original rice pilaf and or some green beans....and sometime with eggs in the morning...This is a very fresh, healthy tasting dish.  
I make a big batch and freeze the left overs, so nice to have an easy, healthy dinner to warm up and enjoy!!

OMG. I had curry lentil soup while out to dinner.  I had to have more. I looked up this recipe and it came out way  better than the resteraunt.  I made a few alterations.  I always keep small bags of mixed cooked beans in my freezer.  I used a cup of them instead of the cannellini beans. I added more carrots and used about 2.5 Tablespoons of Spice Island Curry in place of the Indian spices. I added a pinch of ginger and clove. about 1 tsp chili power and 2 tsps cayenne. When it was cooked, I put it all in my VitaMix and blended it gently. Smooth but chuncky.  

Next time I'm going to use coconut oil in place of olive oil.

This is a favorite soup recipe of mine.  I make a few changes: 1) I use a lot more fresh minced garlic, 6+ cloves. 2) During the last 10 minutes of cooking, I add 4 - 6 c. fresh baby spinach leaves, chopped. 3) During the last few minutes of cooking I add the juice of 1 freshly squeezed lemon.  
It is delicious served with crusty bread and grated Parmesan cheese.

This recipe is awesome. The whole family liked it (including 2 young boys). I didn't use any spices besides the garam masala and added a little bit of butter to each bowl and it was AMAZING. Better than so many Indian restaurant curries. And so healthy! Love it.

With some seasoning changes I loved this soup! But it turned out fairly different from the recipe so I feel my evaluation isn't really fair. I made it into an Indian soup and added some curry and actually used black beans since that is what I had on hand. Good inspiration though!

The spices were overwhelming, yet tasteless because the recipe lacked acidity.  We added vinegar which helped a lot.

This soup is AMAZING. The spices are exotic and interesting without being overpowering. Change nothing, except maybe add a little salt. YUM!

This is a wonderful soup!   I used the green lentils, a can of kidney beans and a can of black beans for my soup, as others stated.  The rest of the recipe I kept as the recipe read.  I think I would like to pick up the Moroccan spice that individuals had mentioned to taste the difference in flavors.

Made this over the chilly weekend exactly as written but using a cooking spray instead of the oil and substituting more of the other spices since my grocery store was unexpectedly lame in the garam masala area. Worked amazingly well and I will be making this again and again. Turns out very rich and thick (thanks to the blender action) and filling when it's cold.

This soup was awesome!!! I did make a few adjustment though, I did half broth (vegetable because that's what I had open) and half water, added more garlic and 1/2tsp more garam. What amazed me was that I didn't need to add salt and I like my salt. I guess the salt from the broth, beans and tomatoes were enough. However I could see it being bland if just using water. I don't know my Moroccan spices but I do know my Indian and I definitely agree those are all Indian spices. So what should this soup be called then...

Great basic recipe.  We added 2 tbsp fish sauce, 3 tbsb soy sauce, half a caramelized onion, and we replaced half the water with broth.  We also doubled the cumin.  Topped with sour cream.  Fantastic!

Very good and spicey.  Enjoyed spices I have not used previously and used chicken broth for a little extra nutrition.  Soup did not call for salt but I found a little sprinkle in the bowl worked great.  Served it with flat bread and added a little more cumin.  Perfect!

I didn't have some of the ingredients so I just used this recipe as a base.. I didn't have carrots or celery, but I did have a couple of cups of left over tortilla soup (with no tortillas in it!) and added that to it which had a few more beans and some corn, and it turned our really well. My kids loved it!

This was a really great soup, more like a stew in terms of thickness.  I was a little worried at first because the smell of the cardamom was pretty strong, but it all cooked down into spicy lusciousness.  The only changes I made were: 1 tsp of cardamom instead of  1.5 t., 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2, subbed 2 cups of chicken broth, and added 1 t. of smoked paprika (just because I love the spiciness that paprika imparts).  It was good, thick, spicy, and filling. It made lots to have as leftovers.

De-Lish!! I used Ras El Hanout, as suggested by another reviewer, did not have ginger, so obviously had to omit that, and when serving, threw in a handful of fresh spinach and a dash of balsamic vinegar. Yumsville! I am in lentil soup heaven right now!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Slayed the in-laws with this soup.   Pureeing 1/2 the soup is a must to get the right consistency.  A staple in the soup roster from now on.

I made this with high hopes - Even though the spices aren't Moroccan; My husband and I love Indian food. We were both disappointed with this recipe. We haven't quite figured out what it's lacking; but something is definitely missing. It has potential though!

This was delicious...absolutely delicious. I had some leftover shredded chicken (from my cinnamon and lime chicken fajitas - look it up here, it's awesome!) and two days after I made this soup, I put the chicken in with as I reheated it and tore up some tortillas and put that in...and this reheated into a DELICIOUS leftover soup...so, great the day of and, in my opinion, even better as leftovers! You won't be disappointed!

This stew is excellent.  I substituted chicken broth for 4 cups of the water and used cinnamon and nutmeg instead of cardamon.  Served with Moroccan couscous.

This is fabulous, especially on a cold day. I threw everything straight into the crock pot, and five hours later we sat down to eat. Easy as can be! I love the cardamom. It seems to me that something is missing, though, or maybe just out of proportion. I plan to make this again and fool around with the spices (I'll try out the advice of the Morrocan reviewers in particular) to see if I can figure out how to round the flavor more completely.

I give this 5 stars - it is such a simple, healthy, delicious and filling meal.  The taste is 'clean' - it tastes so "natural" yet surpisingly tasty.  I didn't have garam masala and didn't miss a thing. Next time I would add a touch of salt but other than than, it was pefect. I plan on making a batch and freezing in for busy weeknights.

the very first soup that i blended! I understand why it's done now....this is a great hearty soup that is super easy.  I doubled the tomatoes and added a splash of rice wine vinegar to "lighten" the soup a bit....but it is a great, easy soup.

i followed serena's advice about the spicing, and it came out quite well. i did not end up adding the cayenne because it seemed as if the black pepper added a nice underlying heat, and i figure that diners who want more heat can add pepper sauce to taste. it does make a generous 12-cup pot, so be prepared to either feed a small army or freeze a lot!

I made this recipe with a few slight alterations/substitutions, and it turned out great...I didnt have garbanzo beans on hand, so I used Navy beans. I also did not have canellini beans, so those were just omitted. Also, instead of all water, I substituted some with chicken broth. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I found that the lentils were ready in about 45 minutes over medium-low heat, and felt that it didnt need to be blended at all. BTW- Dont spend big $$ on buying cardamom unless you plan on using it a lot. (This spice is usually already found in Garam Masala.) I will likely try this again, but with some nice Naan bread! :)

We love this tasty, healthy soup!  I reduced this already low fat soup to nearly no fat by using a small amount of water instead of oil to saute the onions, garlic and ginger.  Keep the lid on the pot and lower the temp a bit and the onions cook up just fine without oil.  Thanks for the great recipe to add to my soup collection!

This soup had great flavor, but I was the only one in my family that really liked it. Appearance-wise, it's not the prettiest. I couldn't find garam masala, so I had to fake it a little with some extra spices. The soup was great with some warm pita bread.

This is absolutely a magnificent meal!  Easy to make in the slow cooker and so tasty.  My husband must have meat at every meal, so I added in some ground turkey.  I used a recipe for Ras al Hanoot from another reviewer and bit the bullet to buy a bottle of ground cardamom - great investment because we will definately make this soup again.  I made the Na'an recipe from this website, and it went over great!  We had leftovers with rice - it's even better the next day!  I recommend this soup to everyone!

Wow...great combination of spices!  I used fresh ginger and used most of the spices used in Ras Al Hanout instead of Garam Masala -- used turmeric, nutmeg, cinnamon, paprika, cardamom..and whatever else I'm forgetting.  Used the slow cooker, cooked on low ~10 hours.  Served with cardamom/coriander bread fresh from the bread machine.  YUM!!

As is, this recipe is VERY bland.  After adding curry, whole cardimom, plus triple the spices called for, the recipe was better.  As many have said, adding flavor with broths and such really helps.  In a true Indian manner, adding some heavy whipping cream would probably help.  Didn't have any on hand, but will try next time.  Made whole wheat chapati to go with the recipe which complemented it very nicely.

This is a nice warming vegetarian soup with some substance to it. I followed some of the suggestions of Serena from a previous review (used mostly brown lentils, omitted cardamom). I used her recipe for the Ras El Hanout spice mix and substituted that for the garam masala. I didn't bother pureeing half of the soup in the blender. It was thick enough as is - more of a stew than a soup. I will make this again.

Very Flavorful, not labor intensive in spite of multiple ingredients.  I used a stick blender a few minutes before serving to make more of a smooth texture, but not completely pureed and served this over basmati rice.

Sorry to go against the high ratings by others, but for us, this did just not seem that special.  It did improve in flavor after a night in the fridge, but overall it just was not that impressive.  We probably will not make again.

I would give this 4.5 stars if possible.  With a lot of additional spices added this made for a nice soup.  I will make it again with double the spices- including salt and pepper.  As others have suggested, I will also use chicken broth or bullion cube instead of water next time.

This is a great soup. I'd give it 5 stars, but I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups vegetable broth for the liquid. I didn't have cardamom so substituted curry powder, which, with the garam masala, gave it a very Indian flavor and aroma. Makes a hearty, satisfying meal over rice, and would also be good with couscous. Best of all, it's really easy. Just chop some vegies and open some cans. Let it simmer while you take the dog for a walk, and when you get home, make some rice and dinner's ready.

This is a tasty, healthy, and easy recipe. I used kidney beans instead of white beans because I had them on hand. I loved the spiced broth.

Really enjoyed this soup, very autumn like!  I read over some reviews (per the norm) and noted several people indicating that garam masala and cardamom are not moroccan spices.  So, I took that into account and altered the spices I used to be more true to this being a Moroccan soup (cloves, allspice, cinnamon, cumin, etc. - as noted by Serena).  Used veggie broth/water combo (one carton - 4 cups and 2 cups water).  I only had red lentils on hand, so used those.  Cooked this on high in my crockpot for about 6 hours and ironically served with Naan, only because I had some on hand and thought it would be nice to 'dip'!  Anyway, was definitely really good, and found the leftovers to be even better as the flavours intensified.  I personally found the cloves/allspice as a dominant flavour in the soup, not necessarily good or bad, just my opinion.
**UPDATE** Jan 11/11 - made this again and used the 'Indian'  spices called for this time, but doubled and glad I did.  Still excellent, although I did find the cardamom to be a bit overpowering in flavour, and this spice I did not double - used maybe 2tsps instead of 3 (the doubled amount).

I used canned beans even though the amounts didn't match the stated amounts in the recipe exactly. It didn't matter. The soup has a moderate amount of heat (spice) and a hearty texture. I also added another clove of garlic and pressed the garlic instead of mincing it. Delicious. (Also, I made it for dinner, but it tasted better the next day, reheated for lunch!) EDIT: I made this again recently and think it tastes better with 2x the spices, if you like heat, and just mashed it in the pot. I also like putting chopped fresh cilantro on top. YUM.

I added a few more cups of water and replaced the garbanzo beans with kidney beans. As suggested by other users, I added more garam masala, cumin powder, and garlic than stated. Because of the extra cups of water I put, I tripled the spices. I couldn't find vegetable stock at the grocery so I used a can of Campbell's Tomato soup, I think next time I'll only use half of it (the tomato flavor was a bit overwhelming). Everyone loved the soup and it's the best Moroccan dish I've made since Harirra & my best soup dish. Thanks a bunch!

We loved this soup, though I must admit we tweaked the spices some to meet our tastes. We pureed all of the soup as well--it had a lovely texture. We served with yogurt sauce and pitas. Yummy!

This was a great soup, an instant favorite.  Great with fresh pita bread.  Masala, cardomom and cayenne made it great.  Chicken stock in place of some of the water jazzed it up, too.

I thought this was outstanding!  Probably used more carrots than what was called for, and had no cayenne so I used a healthy pinch of red pepper flakes instead.  Also had no garam masala so used the Easy Garam Masala recipe as a guide as to what spices to add.  Also tossed in a couple bay leaves.  Has nice flavor without being over-the-top spicy.  Didn't want a particularly thick soup so I skipped the pureeing part.

I can see how some people would love this soup.  However, I didn't care for the garam masala.  I love Indian, middle eastern and african food, but this just didn't taste quite right.  It had a flowery taste.  Also, very, very bland.

I just finished making this soup for the first time, and the household agrees that this is a keeper!

I did make a couple of changes (as mentioned throughout the reviews).  (1) I used 5 cups of veggie stock instead of the 6 cups of water (2) I added about ~1/2 tsp of coriander seed (3) added salt (to taste) before finishing.

I, like some of the others on this review list, never salt my food, but this is a dish that needs some salt to expose all of the other flavors.  YUMMMM!

I was a little unsure how this would turn out, but I was pleasantly surprised (especially after considering this is a totally vegan dish!).  I did make some changes, though.  I added one full cup of carrots and one full cup of celery.  I used 1 tablespoon of the garam marsala and cumin, 1.5 tablespoons of ground cardamom, and  a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I added two veggie bouillon cubes to the water and a little bit of salt     to the batches I pureed.  This ended up very thick and hearty (almost a little meaty...my boyfriend commented that it made our apartment smell like chicken curry).  Now I am not sure what Moroccan lentil soup is supposed to taste like, but this tasted a lot like Pakistani/Indian daal.  Whichever...it was still very very tasty :-)

For the people who did not end up with a great end product, I would check the quality of your spices.  If they don't have a strong smell when adding them to the soup, they aren't going to have a strong taste either.  For the people who said their cardamom was very expensice, try checking out a Pakistani/Indian grocery store.  You can find all these spices in this recipe for less than $6.

I don't think I would make this again unless I modified it. I doubled the cayenne pepper and I felt it did need more salt. It was hard to believe something with so many nice spices lacked in flavor. I would use a vegetable or chicken stock instead of water, add salt, and double the lentils. It was like spicy vegetables floating in water (even after I blended some of it).

This soup is outstanding! I put a couple of chicken breasts into the soup and let them cook there to take in the flavor. Then I took them out to cool and chopped them up and returned them to the soup. I recommend that if you want a meat soup. Excellent with or without, though.

Very good!  I add a bit more ginger and garlic to the soup for extra oomph.  I have made this dozens of times and I always love it.  It is not a very fussy soup as I've substituted bulgur wheat for the lentils and it was still great.  I can't wait for winter and the excuse to make this delicious home-made soup!

This soup has alot of taste, some zip from the Garam Masala and Cayanne Pepper, really delicious, even my 8 yr old loved it.  Next time I make it I will put more then 1 cup of lentils in, the lentils seemed to get lost in all the other beans.  Otherwise, Fantastic!

This soup was excellent!!  I used 4 cups of chicken broth + 2 cups water instead of pure water.  Added the Garam Masala much later in the cooking so it kept its spiceyness.  Also added a bit of cilanto.

Outstanding! Very complex flavors. Kicked it up a notch with a little more cayenne pepper. Easy to make. The puree process gives it a great texture. Would definitely recommend this to friends.

This soup was sooo good. I had to add about two teaspoons of salt, which really brought out the flavor. I forgot to blend half of it, but I loved it the way it was. I served it with some cornbread which made for a great dinner(and lunches for the next two days!) It's even better the next day. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty soup, but I made a few modifications. The first modification I made was to use chicken stock instead of water.  In the cooler months, I'll use a 50-50 combination of beef bone broth and water.  

The next modification was to cook the onions alone for 3 minutes, and then add the garlic and ginger for another 2 minutes.  Otherwise, you're likely to burn the latter two ingredients.  

The next modification I made was to add 1t of mineralized salt, since my chicken stock is unsalted.

I found that I needed stir the soup during the simmer phase to prevent the beans from burning on the bottom of the pot, and that the cooking time was only 75 min.

Rather than pureeing half the soup, I pureed only the beans.  After they've cooked, they don't require any water to puree.

A wonderful vegan recipe. Also it is full of anti-inflammatory foods. Made it just like the recipe.  It is delicious. The spices are aromatic and not overpowering. I love that you blend 1/2 the soup, not all of it. It is thick, but you can still see the individual ingredients. Will be making this often.

Simply delicious.  As mentionned by several reviewer, I changed the Garam Masala for Ras El Hanout (which, by the way is also known as Couscous Spice  blend).  I simply cannot wait to eat it again... Great recipe !!!!

I read the reviews before I made the soup.  I followed Serena's suggestion and used more Moroccan spices.  The rest of the recipe I made as written. I would change a few things if I make it again.  I would toast the spices with the onion and garlic to bring out the oils in the spices before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I would omit the celery and add spinach or other green at the end to just wilt.

Very flavorful soup, though it tasted more Indian than Moroccan so I agree with some of the other reviewers. However it was very delicious and feeling.  The only changes I made, was I added more spice via a couple of extra dashes of cayenne pepper and I added salt and pepper which brought the flavor out a little more for me.  Excellent dish though, and yes the Cardamom is very expensive surprisingly it was only $5.99 at Whole Foods, but $13.99 at my local grocery store (Giant). Both same size bottles.

With ONE ADDITION this is an EXCELLENT hardy vegan soup!

The problem is that there is no salt in the ingredients, so it ends up tasting bland.  Even though I heeded some advice and doubled up the seasonings it was still not enough.  It really needs some salt, so I added in 2 vegetable bouillon cubes (instructions said 1 cube per 3 cups of water) and PRESTO!!  Delicious soup.... mmmmmm.

P.S. Obviously it ends up tasting more Indian than Moroccan but that doesn't take away from the great taste of the soup!

A very flavorful soup, even omitting the garam masala and cardamom, as others suggested.  I threw in a meaty hambone and used the whole bag of lentils, upping the water to 12 c.  Count on adding water to reheat it as it is that thick.  Thanks for sharing!

Just was not to our liking.  The only thing I did different was to double the recipe to use the whole lbs of lentils.  Realistically the recipe in itself was ok, the flavor was good.  I have come to the conclusion that we are just not lentil fans.

This is a great recipe as is. The second time I made it, I put in a bit more cayenne pepper to give it more zing and I threw in a chicken breast and let it boil along with the soup for an hour. I removed the chicken breast, shredded it and tossed it back in. Excellent!!!

Really good! I took other's advice and used broth in place of water and added potatoes.  For us it was too spicy but I buy my spices fresh from the bulk bins so next time I will need to cut back on the cayenne. I also did not puree but that is definitely just a personal prference. This is a hit and I'll definitely make it again!

This soup is great, but you definately have to use broth. This soup is lacking in flavor otherwise. Used a little more garam masala and added salt.

Easy recipe that comes out with killer flavor everytime.  The only "fussy" part is the blending, but let me tell you, it is worth it.  I substitute veggie stock or chicken broth for the 6 cups of water.  More flavor that way.

A little on the bland side. I used dried white kidney beans and chickpeas (I soaked them over night and cooked them for 20 minutes). I added vegetable broth and sea salt to give it more flavour.

I will give this a try again adding broth instead of stock, it had a very watered down taste to me.  I will also omit the garam masala, a spice that I love in Indian food but it didn't seem to work for me in this soup.  I also added some tomato paste to try and give some more flavor.

I thought this soup was excellent although I agree, it has an Indian taste but I love Indian so that was a bonus.  Also, I had to double the spices as recommended by another user and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made this soup for the first time over the weekend. At first I was hesitant about a soup recipe which simply called for water rather than a stock base so I substituted 2 cups of water with vegetable broth. It was fabulous! Great Recipe. The spices had a winter/holiday flavor so I'll make it for the holidays this year.

This makes a great "cooling" side when served with other spicier dishes. I made this alongside a very spicy curry and it worked beautifully at mitigating the lingering spice.

Only thing I changed for this recipe was that I added a tbsp of liquid concentrated chicken bouillon while this was cooking. It really added a lot to the depth of flavor for this soup.

I took Serena's advice and added RAS EL HANOUT in order to make it more Moroccan, which was great especially since I've never cooked with that spice!  However, I also added the other spices, but honestly it needed more spicyness.  The flavors were good, but not spicy enough for me. I also added both green and red lentils and I used low sodium veggie broth and I added 2 bay leaves.  A couple a changes I would make next time is I would add another can of tomatoes and I would get crushed not diced.  Overall, it was an easy soup and I would try it again!

This did NOT work for us, maybe we got the spice combination wrong.  Definitely won't be making this again.

Very tasty. Used the Ras el Hanout spices as recommended by other reviewers. Turned out beautifully although very, very thick. Almost more of a lentil stew or curry. Could be watered down, but is still good as is, although I prefer to dip/spread on pita wedges this way. Made A LOT. Next time would halve beans/lentils but keep other measurements the same. (I like lots of tomato and spices and the extra broth would help keep it soupier.)

Very easy to make!  I added extra of all the spices and thought the flavor was wonderful.  My food processor didn't work so it wasn't blended but I still thought it was a tasty healthy soup.

This was great, but I did change it a little.  I used Ras al Hanout instead of garam masala and I left out the cardamom.  I also used ground ginger instead of fresh, and I left out the garbanzos and cannellinis since I didn't have them in the pantry.  I sauteed the vegetables in oil and then added the spices and sauteed for 5 more min, then added the water and lentils.  It was delicious, easy and cheap and I look forward to the leftovers tonight.

This is such a wonderful recipe.  I loved it made just as it is, however it has a lot of potential as a start for some very delicious meals.  I can't wait to try it as a base for lamb stew.

the cardamom is weird.  I inverted the amounts for garam masala and cardamom, and it was still too much, that may just be personal preference though.

I cooked this the first time with the changes suggested by Serena (great review with very helpful tips!). I actually found Ras Hanout at a specialty store and used it in place of the Garam Masala. I also left out the cardamon. It was delicious! It was savory and filling and made my apartment smell wonderful. I have made it several times since, once I did not have fresh ginger so I used ginger powder. That batch came out very bland, so you absolutely must use the fresh stuff.  My very picky vegetarian husband loves this dish and it has become a staple in our diet. Delish!

Yum! Great flavor and hearty for being all veg.  We eat it with a side of rice.  My husband is not a big fan of ginger and cooked tomatoes but he enjoyed the soup's overall flavor so much that he didn't even mention they were in the soup.  I don't have a food processor so I didn't puree the soup.  Not a problem, still a great consistency and tastey.

My husband loves this and it is easy.  We add more spices as it is pretty bland on its own. Also...I am not a vegetarian so I add cooked chicken (have also added it raw to the boiling soup and let it simmer for a few hours).

An honestly excellent recipe.  Easy and flavorful.  If you don't like your food too spicy, half the amount of cayenne pepper.  I loved it spicy but my family thought it was too much.

Oh man this one is delicious!  I'm a big lentil soup fan, and I was sick with a cold and wanted something spicy.  I tripled the spices, and it wasn't very spicy.  The curry combination smelled so sweet, and the heat was pretty mild.  Took some to work and everybody asked what I was eating, because they thought it smelled good.  I have no idea how Moroccan or Indian this one is, but as a lentil soup, its fantastic!!!

Delicious! Just like many others I changed a few things because i didn't have it. I think the ginger really adds hit of flavor that hard to point once the dish is finish. Definitely don't skip ginger. Things I changed: I used brown lentils instead of red. For spices I used paprika, chiken soup mix(consume), cumin and allspice and cur-cum. I also didn't have the white beans so I only used cheek peas. The soup is very hearty, kids friendly  since i dint put Cayenne paper. Perfect for rainy day, just like today.

Very good. My only problem with this was that I felt the cardamom was too prominent of a flavor, and I only used 3/4 of the amount called for. I added a lot more cumin, some chili powder, and more garlic to level it out. I threw everything in the slow cooker and let it cook on low for 9 hours. Very good, thank you! :)

I don't care if this is authentic Moroccan or not, it was fantastic! I substituted "garam masala" (which I could not find locally) with equal parts cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper. Also, I omitted most of the onions and added only as much as were contained in the canned diced tomatoes due to a few family members disliking onions.  I served the soup with thick pita bread and my family loved it. Very spicy, very hearty, very satisfying!

I made this in a slow cooker - it is delicious but came out much thicker than I expected.  I'd recommend making it on top of the stove to be able to monitor the consistency better.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious - but if you're looking for soup rather than stew I would skip the slow cooker.

Very good and hearty soup. My family likes soup for dinner in the Winter and this fits the bill. I sent it to my mother and she loved and place several portions in the freezer for easy lunches for friends that stop by and my father.

This was one of the easiest recipes to make and very versatile. Since the recipe did not use traditional Moroccan spices I didn't feel bad about tweaking it to use what I had on hand at the time. I didn't use carrots or the tomatoes, and I cut the cayenne down a touch. But the recipe was very easy and made quite a bit. I portioned it out and froze the extra. It's been great when I come home late or just don't feel like cooking. I've also added prociutto or chicken to it after defrosting some for dinner. This is a big hit at our house! I also used a blend of Garam Masala purchased from auntiearwenspices.com

Wow, this was good!  Did not have ground caradamon and didn't miss it.  Used veg broth instead of water.  Did not puree it.  Oh, and I added some red pepper flakes for a little more heat.  Will definitely make this again.  Served with some crusty bread.  MMMMMMM!

I was so excited to cook this, but it just didn't do it for me. I was under the impression that this would be spicy, but it was milder than mild. I ended up adding tons more garam masala than specified, in addition to more cumin and cayenne. I added a lot of salt and curry. I eventually added more beans and tomatoes. Finally, I added a half can of coconut milk. In the end, I had a great white bean curry soup. I was totally different than the original recipe though.

Yum! I didn't expect much from this soup, but it was quite tasty. Added in a bell pepper because didn't have celery on hand. Also, took the suggestion of adding the spices to the onion and garlic while they cooked up - I've never seen a recipe add the spices in with the liquids. This ensured lots of flavor in the soup. Also subbed chicken broth for water. Once pureed, this made quite a tasty stew on a cold fall night!

This recipe was fabulous... although I would have given it 5 stars with the changes made using Serena's spice review for the Moroccan spices... and I actually didn't saute anything, I just put it all in the crockpot and set it on low for about 5 hours. AWESOME!

This was just bean/lentil soup.  If you lile bean soup, you will like this. We are not that fond of it...so it was just OK for us.  We ate it, but I will not make it again.

This is really wonderful soup. I was out of celery so I used celery salt, since some of the reviewers had said the soup needed extra salt anyway. I also added a little cinnamon, per other reviewers advice. I cooked it for about 6 hours on low in my crock pot - it was delicious!

I am still looking for a lentil recipe that I will LOVE. This isn't it. It was ok, I followed advice posted and added rus al hanoot,(My husband is lebanese and I got some from his mom.) Its just not the best thing Ive had yet. Maybe I dont like lentils? I don't know... and yes, it was bland. Salt, please. I think it would be better to have added more ssalt to the cooking water instead of at the end. Actually, it makes GREAT BABY FOOD. (SANS SALT)

This was a good recipe. I used the suggestions from the reviewer: What a dish! and I really enjoyed this hearty soup. It happened to be cold outside too, what a bonus! My fiance wasn't crazy about this soup, but he isn't used to trying new things.

Kind of a let down. I really don't like lentils much, but my boyfriend does, so this was a treat for him. I increased the proportion of beans for my taste but otherwise kept to the recipe. The soup smelled awesome while cooking, but was otherwise rather bland. Salt helped. This is actually much better as leftovers, but who wants to go through all that trouble just for food that will only taste good the next day?

This soup is wonderful.  I make it often and my husband, who is usually very skeptical of vegetarian dishes, thinks it's great.  I made a few variations: I omitted the celery (I HATE celery), used some tomato paste instead of canned tomato, and replaced the water with chicken stock.  A very good meal....I even add a little dollop of sour cream on top for extra tang.

I made this for my family and it was amazing! However, it was a little too spicy for my parents, so next time I'd probably cut back a little on the cayenne, but I thought it tasted amazing! It's really filling and delicious.

Wow, this soup is very good, although I think it's more like a stew. I love the flavors, I think all it needed was a little salt. I added some pieces of a  portabella mushroom, which gave it some "meaty" texture. Oh, there was another reviewer that gave the same of a particular spice, that spice is called "Ras el Hanout" and is actually a mixture of spices that can vary from store to store. I personally really liked the Garam Masala, even if it is an Indian spice mixture. In conclusion, I will definitly make this again!

I agree with the other reviews as far as flavor ~ it was very good.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few things that it needs, one on which is salt.  I usually do not salt my food, but even with all of the spices (and kick from the cayenne!) it was missing something.  I added fresh ground sea salt & a couple of shakes of garlic powder.  Also, I would triple the amount of lentils as its really more of a vegtable soup than a lentil soup. And last but not least - pureeing is a must if you want thick soup.  It's annoying but worth it!

Absolutely delicious. I made this the night before eating, and we ended up pureeing the whole soup cuz the bf likes it that way (next time I'll set some aside for me that's only half pureed!). The flavors are delicious and satisfying. Didn't change anything else. Served with hot naan. Thanks for the recipe!

This was creamy and delicious.  We made two changes:  instead of all water, we used 4 cups vegetable broth + 2 cups water.  Also, I was out of cardamom so I used about 1/2 tsp of coriander instead.  This was a very flavorful soup.  Great on a cold day.

This soup was EASY and so complex in the layers.  I followed it exactly as written - except that I ccooked dried garbonzo beans because I think they r much more flavorful.  I will be recommending this recipe to other and it's in my main list of cold day soups!

Loved the flavor of this although I used vegetable broth instead of water and also put 2 cups of chopped spinach and 1/2 cup of chopped parsley into the pot.  I also added 1 tsp curry powder and salt and pepper to taste.  Near the end I added a 1/2 bag of vegetarian chicken and cut up 1/2 block of baked tofu.  I did not have the cannelini beans, so left them out.  Will definately make this again.

I used vegetable stock instead of the water and as I was putting it together I realized I didn't have any chickpeas. So I used 2 cans of cannelini beans. This smelt so good and was a perfect meal for a very cold day. I reheated the leftovers for lunch today and had to add some water as it does thicken up considerably. Thanks.

This recipe was perfectly spiced.  I just made a few changes.  I used 4 cups veggie broth and 2 cups water for a little extra flavor.  Also added salt and pepper to taste.  Mopped it up with warm pita bread and it made for a nice, hearty meal.

This was a lovely soup. I had fresh spices and I wonder if those who found the recipe bland were using old masala and the like.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was just bland, and it only got worse in the fridge overnight.

This is a fantastic soup and it's SO easy!  My family LOVES all the flavor.    Per previous suggestion (thx), I added 4 c. chicken broth/2 c. water.  I also add cauliflower and more carrots.  I add an add'l. 1/2 tsp. of cumin, as it's a favorite spice of mine.  I make this constantly.  It's a family favorite.  I like to serve this with Trader Joe's Curried Naan bread too!  I make it for company often and the applause is deafening!!   Will make again and again and again.  Thanks for this great recipe!

The soup went from a 3-star to a 4-star with the addition of some salt.  It was truly amazing how much difference that made in the taste.  The soup is a great blend of a lot of interesting flavors, and is good and filling.

As written this recipe is kind of bland.  I doubled the garam masala and substituted chicken broth for some of the water, it really needed of salt, so I added a couple of teaspoons of seasoned salt.  After the changes, delicious.

Everyone enjoyed this.  Gave some to my best friend and she asked for the recipie, great soup.  Didn't puree it though, at all.  Might cut down on the cayenne pepper though next time.  Used 1/2 garam masala and 1/2 rus al hanoot.  Tasty.

Maybe I'm just having a hard time switching from lentil soup with meat to the vegetarian version, but this was pretty mediocre and not even spicy. I will try making it again though cause I do love indian spices (garam masala) and I couldn't really taste them in the soup I made, so I'll try putting in more cayenne and other spices next time. Also more garlic:)

This has to be the best tasting Middle Eastern recipe I have ever tried, however because I have read that tomatoes will prevent lentils from cooking, which may account for the lengthy cooking time, I decided to shortcut the recipe. I used can lentils to step 2, added the tomatoes then simmered it just to blend flavours about 20 minutes. At the end I added a mixture of flour and water to thicken it and served it over brown basmati rice. Authentic, flavorful and quick!

terrific!  i included chopped potatoes instead of cannellini beans, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, i added cilantro and chicken broth as other reviewers suggested, and i did not puree the soup.  the result:  a thick, hearty stew...a unique blend of flavours...and delicious served with warm naans (a recipe i also found at Allrecipes.com).

Fabulous recipe....
I took this soup to work, and everyone was asking what smelled so good.

It was easy to put together -- it was waiting for it to be finished cooking that was the hard part.

I found that red kidney beans work as well as white ones (also known as cannellini beans). Cardamom can be fairly expensive, especially where we live, so I left it out. 

An excellent recipe

This was really tasty and easy to make. I omitted the cardamom (only had the pods) and added some boullion cubes as another reviewer suggested, because it needed a little something. I was a bit heavy handed with the cayenne pepper, so I added a spoonful of sour cream to the finished product. It made a nice presentation that way too.

I LOVE this recipe.  I'm a vegetarian, and I'm always looking for easy, yummy main dishes.  My husband likes it too and he's not a big lentil fan.  It's so good I have been making it all summer, even though it's much more a cool weather dish.  The only minor change I make is to add some salt before pureeing.  YUM!!!

With all the spices, I expected the flavor to be a tad stronger, but I still really liked it. When I made it a second time, I substituted the cardamom with yellow curry and it was really tasty, and I think I prefer it that way!

Yummy!  This soup is delicious.  The only thing I added was 2 teaspoons salt.  Also, the soup was done is 25 minutes.  I served it with fresh diced tomatoes and a sprinkling of chopped fresh cilantro.  This is definitely an addition to my regular recipes.  Thanks!

Very interesting flavors. Not too hard to make. The family liked it. However, I went to buy cardamom and the supermarket had it for $9.99 for a few ounces! I substituted more ginger for the cardamom.

This is very good as described and excellent -- IMHO - with the addition of:

1 tsp + cumin
1 tsp + chipotle (yeah, not Moroccan, but adds savoury depth)
Juice of one large lemon (and maybe some zest). Could also add orange zest.
3-4 bay leaves (while simmering)
Salt and pepper to taste

Tip: If you enjoy a more substantive, "toothy" texture:
use green lentils, as they tend to retain their integrity better than red, and 
don't necessarily blend half as recommended.

Btw - it's a BIG pot of soup. We made half the recipe and it was still plenty for 6, plus leftovers. With a salad, a great and easy dinner in a bowl.

This was great using just one-quarter of the suggested amount of cayenne.  It would have been WAY too hot for even me with the full amount.  Next time I will cut back on the amount of garam masala, as it tasted a bit heavy on the cinnamon flavor.  Just lowering the mount of cayenne, my teenagers even loved it.  I did throw in some chopped kale leaves the last ten minutes.  It all cooked faster than listed time, because I used split red lentils vs. whole red lentils.  Great exotic flavors.

Had no beans so I made it with mini potatoes. It was better imho with a little kosher salt. (I had used the water instead of stock)

WOW! This was excellent! I love lentils and this did not disappoint. I traveled to Morocco in my 20's and fell in love with lentils and couscous. I served this with Moroccan stuffed acorn squash, the recipe also found on this site. A half Acorn each was sufficient.

Delicious! However, I did make some changes.  I used vegetable broth instead of water. I also used half the suggested amount of cayenne pepper  and added salt to taste at the end.

I added ground turkey meat,fresh ginger,basil (no tarragon). Lovely soup.
Next time I will omit turkey meat. Good hearty soup to need to add meat.

It’s great. I doubled just the garam masala and cumin for a little extra flavour the second time I made it and this was a good adjustment.   I’ll be making this again.

This soup has a kick, and is oh so good. I simmered for just shy of an hour, and everything was plenty tender, so I would recommend not letting it simmer too long before checking it. I did not puree half of the recipe, as called for, because laziness, but really like it as-is.

Delicious and healthy. Super easy to make.

I actually omitted the cardamom (not a fan) and did a blend of cinnamon and nutmeg instead, and made my own garam masala with varying amounts of tumeric, curry powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, red pepper flakes, paprika, and cayenne. Absolutely wonderful and the wife loves it!

This was a good soup. I made a few alterations - used just 1 onion, only used garbanzo beans, (as that is all I had), increased the garlic a bit. I wasn't sure about the cinnamony taste as first, so I added just a bit of salt to my bowl of soup. I used both red and green lentils, approx. 1/2 cup of each. I would make this again, but it is not my favorite lentil soup recipe.

Great vegan option that my vegan friends and my meat-eating son and husband liked.  I followed the recipe with a few changes.  I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of garam masala.  I didn't have plain cayenne so I used chipotle.  I also added a big spoonful of miso to the water to give it more body.  I waited until the last half hour to add tomatoes and some salt, so that the lentils would soften more quickly.  I also added an extra can of beans at the end as the other ones had turned to mush and wanted to have chunky bites.  If I had Harissa paste, I would of used that (if vegan).  I served it with a spinach salad and sour dour bread.

An excellent soup that's quick and easy to make (provided you have a well-stocked spice cabinet).  I found that it cooked much quicker than the time suggested (only about 30 min) possibly because I used split red lentils rather than whole lentils.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of ras el hanout spice blend.

I didn't have all ingredients (carrot & celery) but used a mixture of dried beans and peas.  We really enjoyed this lovely soup; I did add a few swirls of Tabasco Chipotle Sauce to the pot just before serving.  Thank you.

Good base, but I found flavor to be lacking. All I could taste was cardamom (which I am a great fan of, in sweets), but that wasn't enough. Next time I'll use vegetable broth instead of water, and add more spices (including salt, but not cardamom).

This was a good, hearty dish.  I added more vegetables simply because I had some in the fridge to use up.  I didn't have ground cardamom, so I left it out.   It was still a really good meal, so next time I make it, I'll make sure I have some in.  Definitely cook this again.

Absolutely delicious, aromatic and brim full of exotic flavor. Made some recipe changes after reading what others had said: (1) substituted 2 tsps of  the  Moroccan spice blend called Ras El Hanout (McCormick Gourmet version, for what it's worth) for 1 tsp. of Garam Masala; (2) cut back the cardamom to 1 tsp; (3) used a cup and a half of carrots and a cup of celery (because why not?); (4) used 3 cups of water and 4 cups of vegetable broth instead of 6 cups water; (5) diced up some fresh cherry tomatoes and held them back until near the end; (6) after letting tomatoes cook a bit, pureed half of soup per recipe and poured it back in, then added a 10 oz package of  fresh spinach and simmered for another 5 minutes or so before serving with a white wine, a fresh and fruitful Argentinian Torrontes. The results were phenomenal. Top three all-time soups!

I added and sauteed only one big onion first, then added garlic, and then sauteed the carrots and celery for a while.  I added 2 big ch. tomatoes instead of a can of tomatoes but held off until closer to the end because I read that tomatoes will slow down the lentils from softening.  I added 1 can of drained  kidney and 1 can of drained cannelini beans, in place of called for beans.   I added 1 t. cumin, 1 t. grated fresh ginger, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. coriander, 1/4 c. cloves as my only spices.   I could probably have added more of the seasonings.  I added 4 C. broth and 2 C. water.

The fun of cooking is all about mixing and matching flavors from all over the world. The taste, ease of making and nutrition of a dish are far more important than its name.
At the end of the day, if I am able to serve my family a delicious, nutritious meal, I am a happy mama..
I have made this soup few times, as is ( except by cut down the cardamom ), or with changes (as in the picture, with added cubed lamb) and liked it either way.
Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I followed the suggestions Serena made in her comments and it turned out wonderful. I like meat, so I will add ground lamb the next time I make this. It makes a lot of soup and the seasonings Serena recommended make it authentic, aromatic and traditionally flavorful. Enjoy making this delightful soup no matter what seasonings you choose to use! Yummy ~

I had only the cannellini beans, and I had to reduce the spices slightly to accommodate a few picky eaters, but this is a wonderful soup! I didn't puree it, since I like the bits and pieces, and the red lentils  become so soft.  I used a little chicken broth instead of plain water in my first batch. This is a keeper! Thank you.

Excellent soup!  The flavors, although perhaps based on other reviews not authentically Moroccan, are delicious and this is a very forgiving soup.  Wonderful served with a dollop of greek yogurt or sour cream and warm naan bread.  I did find I added a touch more salt and heat (hot sauce/spices) at the table.  This would be excellent with an addition of lamb or beef stew meat for those who wish for a bit more protein.  But even my carnivore of a husband didn't complain - this was hearty enough to keep him full.

Delicious soup! I followed the recipe, but after tasting I added 1/2 tsp salt and increased the garam masala, cardamom and garlic by half and doubled the ginger. Will definitely make again.

This was lovely - I saw other folks reviews and instead of Indian spices I added ras al hanout. I also left out celery. Will certainly make again but was very filling.

First thing I noticed was that this recipe was seriously lacking salt. After adding a healthy dose of kosher salt, we found that the flavor was good, but something was still lacking. For a wanna-be Moroccan or even Indian dish, this is a good base, but more definition is needed. The soup is a little thin (watery) on day one, but this improved by day two. I do not use canned beans and, as usual, hydrated my garbanzos and cannellinis before adding them to the pot. Perhaps next time I will hydrate them within the six cups of water that are called for in this recipe.

Instead of water I added chicken stock. 
But, followed the Moroccan recipe and made the spice blend recommended.
Delicious, filling and healthy.

This recipe is great as is... However, I cooked the lentils beforehand with garlic mad coconut milk and it was divine.

Good recipe although my batch came out rather bland. I didn't use the cardamom or diced tomatoes but tomato paste and added chili and garlic powder. I would try using stock next time I make this for more flavor. It went absolutely well with rice and had a great texture. Needs more salt and spice for next time.

Tasty, though I prefer the flavor of harissa over these spices.
-One addition: I added salt to taste, at the end

Very good recipe. Even though the spices are Indian, they can easily be tweaked. I made a similar recipe in which I also use the Indian spices (so good!) but modified the overall recipe & simplified it into a crock pot meal. So easy, healthy, & convenient! My recipe can be found on my blog:

Pretty good.  I subbed ras el hanout in place of the garam masala.  Something was still missing.  I think next time I will use chicken broth instead of water and see if that helps.

this turned out wonderfully.  based on the reviews i did change the seasonings somewhat.  mixed up a very simplified Rus Al Hanoot using what i had on hand as listed in the reviews.  and let it simmer all day, the house smelled wonderful.  served it w/ rosemary focaccia and taboulleh.  even my Midwestern meat and potatoes husband loved it.  definite keeper

This started out a bit bland and watery but got much better in the next few days when it had a chance to thicken and the flavors had a chance to meld.  I also added a healthy amount of curry powder which seemed to bring the flavor of the dish to the level I was looking for.  Fantastic with warm naan or pita; making again this weekend!  My husband and kids don't care for this type of dish but it freezes well in small batches and makes quick, tasty lunches for one.

This was so good!  It reminded me of Indian/Nepali lentils, so I served it with rice and a dollop of plain yogurt. Hubby kept saying "no, it's good, it's good..." but I think it was more of a 3.5-4 stars for him. Since this tasted so much like what I ate growing up in Asia, I gobbled it.  I probably won't make it too often, just since the fam wasn't crazy about it, but it's definitely a yum on my charts!  I used red and green bell pepper instead of onion (hubby won't eat), celery, and carrot (didn't have either).  I also upped the spices a bit.

This was good. Tasted like a fragrant curry soup with some nice veggies. I liked the garbanzo beans, too. My family didn't love it so I'll probably reserve it for cold winter nights when I can make them something they like alongside it.

I made this soup for New Year's Day and the comments were "this is amazing!".  I didn't have garam marsala or cardamon on hand and used cinnnamon and cloves instead and I used a combo of red lentils and french lentils.  One of the best soups I have ever made - thanks Grace and Mae!

I was surprised at how almost sweet this soup was.  With all the spices I expected it to be hotter.  It was good but not great... I did as others suggested and used ras el hanout in place of garam marsala.

I've recently become a semi-vegetarian and so when I found this recipe I was really excited to try it.  I used the spice combination from an earlier review that made it more of a Moroccan soup rather than an Indian soup.  It tasted great.  I had the leftovers for lunch today and it tasted even better!  I've got two very small children, so I'm always looking for something that is easy to prepare and this definitely was.

This recipe is versatile and tasty! It's easy to improvise if you don't have all the ingredients.

I didn't have tomatoes so I used a can of tomato paste instead. I don't like celery, so I just used an extra 1/2 cup of diced carrots. I also used ground ginger instead of fresh. The soup still turned out excellent. The spices are perfectly balanced.

This soup is so healthy! 5 stars for that! I would, however, use less cardomom and maybe add more cumin or maybe some curry or asian inspired curry peanut butter. Absolutely fantastic on how healthy this soup is. It's tastey, too.

Love, love, love this soup.  Bursting with tons of flavor.  I didn't puree it and it was great.  I have added some meat a couple of times (that's what my husband likes) but I love without.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This soup is delicious.  I added some extra garbanzo beans as well as about a 1/3 bag of frozen spinach.  Next time, I would add more spinach - it tasted great.  I did not have cardamom at the time but I used the other spices listed, added some extra cumin as well as sea salt, pepper, and a little cinnamon.  This soup was a hit and delicious with some hearty wheat bread.  I almost did not puree the half of the soup but at the last minute I decided to and I am so glad I did.  It gave the soup a terrific, thick, and creamy texture.  Thanks!

Love it!  It's all in the preparation of the spices.  I used a combination of navy and chick with lentils.  Great with naan.

Yum! What a great combination of spices and ingredients! I used dried beans and fresh tomatoes (I think I estimated fairly well, though I would add more tomatoes next time). According to how much I eat, it definitely makes more than 6 servings.

Used red kidney beans instead of cannellini beans.  This soup turned out well.  We froze it and ate it on cold winter evenings.

I LOVE this recipe. It is a winter favorite for sure. I do not blend or puree, however, I like the texure and why create more dishes? I add more spice to taste as I cook.

This recipe was too hot for me.  Next time I would leave the cayenne pepper out since the other spices would still give it a good kick.  My husband, however, loved it just the way it was.

Loved this recipe.  did follow advice of others.  4 cups chicken broth with 2 cups water.  used red kidney beans instead of white.  added cilantro.  and remember to add salt for taste--makes a big difference!

I halved this recipe so I only used a can of garbanzos and not the cannellini beans.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe but did not cook it as long (I do not like my lentils to be completely mushy).  The flavor of this is very  nice and different from most lentil soups I have tried.  Very thick, filling, and yummy.

This is a very good looking soup unfortunatly I can't give any compliments on the flavor. I agree with some other reviewers and need to say that it is quite bland. I added some salt at the end to bring it up to speed, however, any 3 stars don't stay in the recipe roledex. Thanks for the recipe tho'.

Excellent recipe. This soup has texture and lots of flavor. The mixture of spices such a cardamon, garam masala, cumin, and cayene pepper was great.I like to use the freshest ingredients, so the soup reaches the optimum flavor. I added a can of navy beans. It was excellent. It tastes like home...

Very, very nice. I left out the oil and used water to saute the vegetables, and left out the garam masala because I didn't have any, and it was not only fat-free, but hearty, filling, healthy, and delicious. Will be making regularly.

I tripled this recipe for a large New Year's Day open house.  The soup simmered a long time but held up so well that we kept the leftovers and it continued to be good a few days later.  I added cauliflowerets and a little diced potato; otherwise stayed faithful to the recipe.  The vegetarians in the group really liked it, but more than a few carnivores enjoyed it too--the ginger and cardamom flavor was nice.  Some kids liked it, some didn't.

This was fabulous. I used 2 cups organic chicken broth plus 4 cups of water instead of 6 cups of plain water. I also left out the chick peas since I didn't have any and used smaller navy beans, which I think is a better choice than white kidney beans. I also left out the celery. I was a hesistant to use 1 1/2 tsp cardamom, so I used a little less. I didn't want to overpower the soup, but it was fine and probably could have gone with the whole amount. I also added 1/4 tsp curry powder and 1 1/2 tsp salt. I served it with some rice, cilantro and cayenne pepper. Excellent!

Wonderful soup!!!!  I supersized this using the button on the bottom, and served it to 85 people at a church dinner.  Everyone LOVED it.  The only things I did differently were, I used less water and diced tomatoes, and I didn't puree it, due to space/time considerations.  It was DELICIOUS!

An awesome recipe!!  Even my kids, 14 and 11 years old, liked it, and had seconds.  Next time, I will try adding some cauliflower as suggested by one member.  Had to substitute one can of white northern beans for the cannellini beans which my grocery store does not carry.  Easy to make, and delicious!!
