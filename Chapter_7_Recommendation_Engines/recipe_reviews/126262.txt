Husband loved it, I thought it was just ok.  I rated this four stars for the ingredients, but it really deserves only three for execution.  The combination of fennel, beets and apples along with the honey dijon is really, really good.  Unfortunately, because beets and fennel are both very dense, the cooking time is way underestimated.  Mine needed 15 minutes in the microwave after 45 minutes in a 450 degree oven.  The last 15 minutes in the oven would never have cut it.  I recommend either microwaving for 10-15 minutes, then roasting at 450 (not 400) for one hour, and/or slicing the beets and fennel rather thinly (don't quarter the beets) and leave the apples in quarters.  Also, I would add an extra dollop of honey dijon dressing or mustard; after the long cooking time the vinegar in the dressing, plus the added vinegar, become the dominant taste.  Finally, for ease of preparation, I placed the cut vegetables/fruit in a large ziploc bag, then coated them with the dressing and other ingredients, then turned them out into the roasting pan.

Gave it four stars because of the ingredients... after reading the other reviews, modified and it came out superb!
Sliced the beets and the fennels, cut the apples in small wedges, salt, peppered, used olive oil then I covered and baked for 45 minutes.  Uncovered and browned for 15 and tossed it with the dijon mustard dressing last.  Will add this to my company repertoire!  A beautiful looking dish, sorry I didn't take a picture.

"A winner!" was what my boyfriend said.  I made the Honey Mustard Dressing I from this site minus the mayonnaise and used that in this recipe.  I still have to get the roasting technique down, I tried cutting the beets and fennel very small but still ended up with slightly underdone beets and applesauce.  I might try adding the beets first next time, then the fennel, and finally the apples to get them all done at the same time.  Would have been a good idea to save some of the dressing for the end, will do it next time.

I do love the beets, apple and fennel combination, however, i left out the extra vinegar and boiled the beets first. To keep the apples from turning into complete mush, I used  3 granny smith and 2 gala (bigger chunks) and the fennel was thinly sliced. You can also substitute balsamic vinegar and add a little dijon mustard to that and skip the dressing.

This is delicious!  Make sure to cut the beets and fennel into smaller chunks than the apples.  I added crumbled feta cheese to mine after serving...a great layer of flavor.

although the flavors marry beautifully, the texture wasn't pleasing to me. the beets were deliciously tender, but the apples turned to mush, and were contrasted by the slightly crunchy fennel. I made this for a family get-together, and no one liked it. i gave it a two, because i think i can work on this to make it work.

I wasn't crazy about this. Used the tips from previous reviewers about cutting into smaller pieces and adding the dijon mustard dressing at the end. Found the taste to be a little strange and the beet juice colored everything else so it didn't look as nice as I'd expected. Probably won't make this again.

This a delicious dish.  The beets definitely need longer than 1 hour to soften.  I roasted the beets for 40 minutes before combining everything and tossing.  I also pre-cooked the sliced fennel for 20 minutes.  I made my own honey-dijon vinaigrette and replaced the dressing, olive oil and red cider vinegar with my dressing. I loved it.  The fennel tasted amazing and next time I will add more.

After reading others' reviews, I added the apples after the beets and fennel had roasted about 40 minutes.  I will be making this again.

Cut the beets a little smaller then quarter.    Don't panic, it really get a lot more done in the last 15 minutes.     Apple cut size depends if you want it to show up as an independent ingredient or blend into the sauce.

I am fascinated by the flavors!  I did read many other reviews first, and altered the recipe a little.  I added essentially, completely roasted beets and the apples for the last 15 minutes.  The fennel bulb needed the full hour to soften.  I also added 1/2 cup of white wine to the mustard and honey (stone ground mustard), and added half of that before roasting and half afterwards.  Yum!  Update: I also added a single clementine to each serving.  VERY GOOD!

We loved the taste, but not the texture and certainly not the clean-up.  I used the original recipe, unfortunately without reading the helpful reviews.  I agree with other reviews that the beets take much longer to cook and the apples less.  I definitely plan to cook again, but will  partially cook the beets first and oil the pan!  With a little work, this can be an excellent dish.

I substituted an onion for the fennel, because that was in the cupboard.  I cut the beets much smaller than the apples and onion.  Cooked in an aluminum foil pan at the recommended temperature and time.  It was very, very good.

This was quite good.  I cut my racquetball ball-sized beets into eighths instead of quarters.  I cut medium-sized pink lady apples into 8 pieces and sliced them crosswise so they were pretty good-sized chunks.  I ran the oven at 425 for about 35-40 minutes.  Everything came out great.   I would do it again for sure.  I probably would use less oil in my dijon dressing, but I was eyeballing a lot of that stuff.
