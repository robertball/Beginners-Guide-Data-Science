This was good, but I just felt that either it was missing something or it was too much tomato paste, as the paste seemed to dominate the other flavors. I plan to play around w/ this recipe, reducing the paste, and maybe upping the other ingredients. I allowed this to simmer a little over an hour, but it was still a tad too thin for me, so I will maybe adjust the water, as well. This is a great jumping off point, though...Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a delicious hot dog sauce.   A bit heavy on the tomato for my taste, so I will cut back a little next time.  Well worth the effort and it brought rave reviews.

Very tastey! I did use about a cup less liquid as other reviewers suggested.

It is a great recipe to start from and go from there, which I do with almost every recipe I touch.

Perfect but scale the water back to 1 2/3 cup. If you can make it the night before itâ€™s even better! Thanks for the great football party recipe!

It is hard for me to provide an accurate rating for this recipe since I made a few changes out of necessity.

I reduced the water to 2 cups for a thicker sauce. I had no relish but had sweet pickles which I chopped and most importantly I had no Worcestershire sauce so I searched for a substitute and discovered I could use steak sauce thus I used 2tbls steak sauce. I also tossed in 2tsp tabasco as that was also suggested as a substitute.

It resulted in a sauce that was slightly too sweet but the children gobbled it up. It turned out great on the salty (IMHO) Costco hot dogs.
