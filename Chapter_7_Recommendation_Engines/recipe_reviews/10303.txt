I finally manage to scoop this recipe from my aunt to compare with this recipe since a few of the reviews scared me.  The recipes are identical except an explicit statement that says: DO NOT BOIL the mix but simply heat and stir until brown sugar is completely dissolved and to let it cool for about 10 minutes before pouring slowly over the graham crackers.  This is a little time consuming but definately worth it in the end!  Mine turned out just as anuty has always made them :)
Update:  Apologies, I didnt look at the pan size, my cookie sheet is roughly 12x16 and fits 35 crackers perfectly.

I have made these several times and have actually had people kiss my feet when I served them.  For people who have had problems, this is what I do and they always turn out great.  Make sure the cookies lay flat in the pan - don't stack them.  I use 12 full graham crackers, broken in half (24 halves) and they fit the pan perfectly. Bring the ingredients to a light boil, stirring contantly.  As soon as the butter and brown sugar form a homogenous syrup, take them off the heat, add pecans (I also add some vanilla here), pour over graham crackers.  It should JUST cover the graham crackers, you may need to spread it with a spoon.  Immediately put in oven and bake on NONSTICK pan.  Let them cool until they come off in one piece, but no longer. Put on foil to cool COMPLETELY and harden before eating.

What in the WORLD did I do? LOL! I bake many cookies, and I've never had a recipe flop so miserably. I followed the recipe exactly, but first of all, it doesn't say how long to boil the ingredients. So as soon as mine came to a rolling boil, I added the pecans and poured it over the crackers.  #2 Graham crackers do not sink. lol!  Basically all the liquid ended up underneath the crackers. #3 The crackers turned to mush, and although the liquid thickened, it did not harden, so there was no way to eat these as "cookies".  There was no substance, just a layer of soggy cracker surrounded my a rich liquid.  If any of you have suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I can't imagine what went wrong, but unless I hear a great suggestion, I won't be trying this recipe again. Too bad...the ingredients sound heavenly!  Ally

This recipe is awesome and so easy.  The key is to not boil the butter and sugar too long.  As soon as it starts to boil, mix in your pecans and pour on top of graham crackers.

This is definitely a five star recipe, first for its ease, second for its taste, and third for its versatality.  I've made this several times and without any additional ingredients, its excellent, but I also enjoy how you can tailor make this one to please a special someone by adding their favorite candy crushed topping a minute or two after it has come out of the oven.  I've added miniature candy coated Kisses, M&M's, and Reeses Pieces, but our all time favorite addition was 3/4 cup Heath Milk Chocolate Toffee Bits found on the baking aisle.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  Today something happened.  I always use generic graham crackers (they are usually cheaper) but Honeymaid were on sale yesterday so I got those instead.  This recipe totally flopped with the Honeymaid.  What the heck??  The cracker soaked up the butter and the sugar was left to crystalize on top.  Taste okay but not as good as normal.  Just thought Id let you all know. :)

I followed the recipe to the letter and something went wrong some where.    I had a hard time getting them off the baking sheet, it seemed more like a candy then a cookie bar.  It sounded so... good but some where it went so... wrong for me.

This recipe was very close to one I have in which I use almonds.  I decided to use this recipe, and much to my delight I found these to not only be quick and easy but were utterly fantastic!!  I did add one thing; I melted white chocolate and dark chocolate (go for the good stuff, it really makes a difference) and drizzled both on these cookies to make them look special for my holiday cookie tray.  These went fast; several people asked me for the recipe.  YUMMY!

My husband and I made these for a big party we were having (our wedding) as favors. Everybody raved about them and requested more. Now we know what to make for Christmas presents!  These were so easy to make and took no time at all. We let the mixture just come to a boil, then poured all over our Walmart brand graham crackers. We lined the cookie sheet with tin foil. When they were done baking we removed the pan to a drying rack, and then after about 5 or 10 minutes pulled the entire cookie out of the cookie sheet (this is where the tin foil came in handy). We let this sit on the drying rack until cooled completely. Using a long straight knife, we cut in smaller pieces.   We highly recommend this, thanks so much for this recipe!

I have used a similar recipe for years (mine does not call for cream of tartar, but uses butter AND margarine with the light brown sugar).  I boil my butter/sugar mixture for about 2 minutes (stirring constantly) until it looks bubbly.  I do not put the pecans in the mixture because they get lost in the liquid and are not evenly spread over the crackers (some crackers will have a lot and others will have none).  I sprinkle them on the crackers and then carefully ladle the sugar mixture over the crackers.  The mixture will seep under the crackers, but if the crackers are floating in it, you have way too much.  I just try to make sure the pecans and the tops of the crackers are coated with the butter/sugar mixture and I often have some of the mixture left over that I use on my next pan of pecan cookies.  Then I bake them approx. 10 mins until the crackers look bubbly in the pan.  It will harden as it cools, but I use a pizza cutter to roll between each cracker while they are still warm.  Otherwise, it is difficult to cut them apart.

This is one of the easiest and best cookies. I have been making them for nearly 18 years it seems like (and I'm only 28!). Like others, I also add 1 tsp of vanilla when I add the nuts only due to preference not out of necessity. I read some of the reviewers saying that theirs turned out runny. In my experience, that only happens if the butter/brown sugar mixture isn't melted together correctly or the use of margarine instead of butter.

I'm rating this based on looks alone.  I just took my stuff out of the oven and they look PERFECT.  My mom has made these before, so I know what they taste like.  I followed this recipe - not sure what her recipe is like.  I didn't mix in pecans - simply because they're really not my favorite.  Instead, I sprinkled the top (before baking) with sliced almonds.  They look beautiful.  I also lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Both cleanup and cutting should be a cinch.  I was worried that I would have sogginess or pooling butter or other problems that people had.  I melted my butter and brown sugar on medium heat until the butter had melted (I kept stirring it during this time).  Then I turned it on high until it came to a boil.  I could tell the syrup was ready because it coated my spatula.  I think that's the best way to test it.  When it coats your silicone spoon/spatula.  Before I boiled it, the butter wouldn't even let it stick to my spatula.  So I could tell once the butter and sugar came together by the sticking.  Anyway.  It worked for me!  I'm very excited to try it!

I had this recipe given to me years ago and lost it.  The version I had called for Club crackers.  I liked the Club crackers better because it gave a sweet and salty flavor.  This recipe is a definite keeper made with either cracker...LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!

I only used 1/2 butter and I didn't have any cream of tartar, but they turned out great!  I could only fit 25 crackers on my biggest sheet, they were great!

SOOOO yummy!  My husband is more of a chocolatey kind of guy, and even HE can't stop eating these.  I did not have any cream of tartar, so I just used baking powder and it worked just fine.

How disappointing! The only thing i did differently was use ritz crackers instead of graham. I ended up with a big gooey mess :(  The flavor was good but there was no way i was getting them out of the pan. My husband used a spoon to scoop out the goo. Did i miss a step in the boiling process? This recipe has potential but i dont know how i for once screwed up. I dont think i will be making this again.

Great, great cookies with a fantastic flavor and crunchiness. And, so easy to make! I tried baking the cookies last week. Following the recipe exactly as was provided, I found the cookies too sweet and too greasy. But when I brought a batch to work, my colleagues (mostly women !!)  loved them.
Still, I wanted cookies that are less sweet and greasy. So I baked the cookies again a few days later, using 3/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I also chopped the pecans into tiny pieces and adjust baking time to 9 minutes. The result was exactly as I wanted: there was enough liquid mixture to cover all the graham crackers, good distribution of pecans, sweet enough cookies, less greasy and super crunchy.
My colleagues all agreed the second batch was better and actually just amazing!
Thank you for a great recipe. It will be a keeper!

I thought this was a great idea and the taste is good but the sauce doesn't harden... perhaps I need to cook it longer so that it will harden up but I followed the recipe and it poured fine, cooked fine but after cooling it still is soft.

I bought these at a church bake sale a couple of years ago and have been searching for this recipe.  This is it!  The first time I made these I left out the cream of tartar (another similar recipe) but they didn't set up firm enough without it.  Very addicting.

I used what I had on had which was ritz crackers instead of grahams and walnuts instead of pecans. So simple so tasty can't go wrong here.

I made these and for some reason they turned very soggy instead of crispy. I followed everything to a T and still didnt turn out. Thans for giving me another option for Christmas cookies.

Paula Deene has a recipe almost just like this one in her Just Desserts book, so I guess they taste good to somebody, but my husband and I took one bite and said we need to throw these out.

The trick to this recipe is using silicone or baking paper....I use a Silpat lining the cookie sheet.  boil the sugar/butter mixture for at least 3 minutes at a full boil.  I stir in the nuts just before I pour the butter/sugar mix over the graham crackers.  

Bake at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes and take them out and let them sit for at least an hour.  The whole mass will slide off the Silpat onto sheets of wax paper and then you can break them up.  At this point, I use melted chocolate chips with parafin melted in the chocolate to make it harden.  I drizzle the chocolate/parafin mix over the top of the crackers to make it absolutely delicious.  

Once that dries, in a couple of hours, then simply break apart and store between sheets of wax paper in a tin in the fridge.   If they last long enough to store them!!!!

This recipe is simple and delicious with a few modifications. I've been making this recipe for about 20 years except I add 1 tsp. vanilla w/ the nuts and I don't use cream of tartar. You need to bring butter and sugar to a rolling boil for approximately 2 minutes, remove from heat and add nuts and vanilla. Spread over crackers immediately and cool. They should be perfect.

As I write this review I'm eating one of these morsels of yumminess with my morning coffee.  These are so easy and sooo good. I recommend making them the night before or several hours before as they're much better after they sit for a while.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla right before I poured it over the crackers.  Definitely try these!

You said it, Debbie!  These are "simple, but out of this world!"  You have to try this recipe, as you really won't believe how delicious these cookies are and how easy they are to make.  After I poured the heated mixture over the graham crackers, I kept thinking that it would probably be a mess to clean after they are baked.  Wrong!  They popped right out of the pan with no mess or stickiness whatsoever.  I sprinkled chocolate chips on half as one of the reviewers suggested, and they were delicious, but plain was just as good.  This is a super recipe!  Thank you!!!

I tried this recipe twice on Christmas Eve & it messed up. :( I did everything the recipe said too, but my crackers ended up soggy both times & all my pecans just fell off!  It was almost as if there was way too much liquid.

Wowzers!  This recipe is highly addictive and SO GOOD!!!  I used real butter...you can't beat the flavor of the real stuff.  I quartered the recipe so I wouldn't make so many I would make myself sick!  I cooked the butter, brown sugar and cream of tarter to a full boil.  I then removed from heat and added my pecans.  I let it cool for about 5 minutes or so until it thickened up a bit then carefully spread over my graham crackers that I had lined in a parchment paper covered pan.  I allowed to cool a few minutes in the pan when I removed the cookies from the oven then I transferred them to a wire rack.  TIP:  Break apart your crackers before lining pan.  That way you can gently pull them apart after you remove them from pan to put onto cooling rack.  I used regular keebler graham crackers i this recipe.

OMG!  These are sinful!  I made these for my dad for Father's Day, and they were gone by the end of the day.  I followed the recipe exactly - it's hard to improve upon perfection.  I will definitely be making these for my coworkers at Christmas.

We love these!  I like to add a sprinkle of chocolate chips after I take them out of the oven.  A great clean up saver: use parchment paper to line the cookie sheet.  After it cools on the pan for a minute, you can then remove the whole sheet and put on the counter to finish cooling.  I then put it in the refrigerator for 5-10 minutes.

Used a 9x13 pan. Cut the sugar and butter to 3/4 cup each. Used one pack of crackers (about 10). Broke each cracker into 4 pieces. Didn't use cream of tartar. Came out great.

My amazing aunt makes a cookie like this. She calls them "goochies" and uses Club crackers instead of the graham crackers. I like the contrast of the sweet and salty and no one ever guesses that they're plain old crackers! I also do not use the cream of tartar. We usually dust them with powdered sugar which really dresses them up.

I was delighted to see this recipe on the allrecipes site.  A friend shared one like it(but without the cream of tarter)many years ago.  It is so guick and easy, and a hands-down favorite with everyone who tastes it.  You've got to try this... you'll be hooked!

I agree, that these taste wonderful. beautiful toffee flavor. However, it does not say how long to boil. I always boil candy very slowly so the sugar can disolve properly. I let it come to a gentle rolling boil and against my better judgement, took it off the stove and poured, then baked. It seems as though it is too sticky, or gooey.  Is this how it is supposed to be? almost a bit too soft. I've made the popularity cookies and they turned out perfect like toffee.(same premise but w/saltines). also, I'm trying to figure out how u would get 35 grahams in a pan that size. I would suggest cutting the grahams in half. a whole graham per serving *as shown in pics) would be too rich, IMO. great flavor though.

You may have to bring the sugar and butter to a 3 minute boil to keep it from being runny. I followed the directions to a tee, but thinking it wouldn't work, and I was right. Plus how do you get 35 graham crackers onto a 10x15 pan?

Use a cookie sheet with sides.  Also, the sugar and butter will taste burnt if cook for too high or too long so watch out.

I couldn't see the point of adding lots of butter and sugar to ready made biscuits but was curious to find out why everyone seemed to like these. My boyfriend liked them, I ate a few but can't imagine making them again. They were a tiny bit soggy and you just know that it's butter oozing out of them. I don't find the idea appetising for some reason

OH MY GOSH!  These are so good.  I put chocolate chips on the top right when they came out of the oven, let them melt and then stuck them in the fridge to cool.  I must have gained ten pounds.

These are so simple, but best of all yummy. I was searching for a recipe that kids could make. My little niece was delighted to help me with them. She's 3 and is in awe of creating things in the kitchen. Thanks Debbie. I had no idea these simple treats were out there...!

Love these!!!  Very quick and easy!  Made them one evening after work. I rarely cook in the evening after a long day and these were so simple I can see they will be a quick solution to a sweet tooth in the future.  The 20 minutes total is pretty accurate and the 10 minutes in the oven is perfect.

OMG! just finished making these for the first time and they look great. Read the reviews first and followed CMalkemus and waited till it had that homogenous syrupy look , a pale brown(like vanilla fudge) then added pecans and poured carefully over the graham crackers. Baked 10 min.and now they are cooling. I lined my baking sheet with parchment paper first to eliminate a problem later. Can hardly wait to taste these babies. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for a bake sale and it was the first thing to sell out. 
Quick hint: Only heat the mix until the brown sugar and butter have formed a unified liquid, and then let it cool slightly before pouring it over the graham crackers.

Yum! I even screwed up a bit and forgot to chop my pecans. I scrapped them off, chopped em and spread them over the crackers again. This is delicious.

May try again when I'm in a better mood.
My first mistake...used graham cracker crumbs.  2nd mistake...my pan was too large (I never have the size I need). 
Couldn't find plain graham crackers, only honey grahams.  Too sweet.

Followed the recipe had to use a little larger pan I didn't have the size called for. Cooked until it was boiling and became the color of peanut butter.
They where wounderful. My family would of eaten them all that night. I will double next time. Thanks for sharing.

It tastes delicious but am I missing something in the boiling part that made mine turn mushy? I think I could only salvage about a third of the crackers. The rest had to go down the disposal.

So easy and so little ingredients! I admit I was waiting for a more rich and powerful taste after reading all the great reviews, like maybe in Peanut Brittle, but they are good tasting and my family could not stop eating them. They really are so easy. I broke the Graham crackers in half, and it made nice sized cookies, but not 40 like recipe said (then again.. the crackers are perforated, so you can break them again, and it would be way more than 40). The boiled ingredients spreads exactly over the crackers so, when pouring spread it out as you pour (gets sticky after sets a few seconds). Also, a low lipped "cookie sheet" is fine, that is what I used. I liked this recipe for either kids to help with or a quick sweet treat for a small gathering. My 11 year old had fun helping me make these, she kept eating the cookies and even forgot she supposedly hates pecans! (hehe)

I used snack size graham crackers and they turned out perfectly. I, too, added vanilla once I added the pecans for some extra flavor.

Fantastic cookie! My family loved them. However, it is not clear how to use 35 graham crackers in a 10 by 15 inch pan. I was able to squeeze 10 graham crackers into the pan.

Outstanding!! so easy to make, and they taste incredible.  The only drawback is that i didn't have enough of the mixture to cover all the graham crackers - just the edges were left empty. Still, worth making over and over

These were very tasty and very easy.  I tried half with semi-sweet chocolate chips as other reviewers suggested, and actually I preferred them without the chocolate (which is rare for me!).  I will probably make these again.

I found this recipe to be too salty. Maybe it's because I used salted butter. Next time I will use either half salt, half sweet butter, or forego the salted butter all together.  But overall a very good recipe

Wow! These were the best and way too easy! I'm afraid I might make them once a week. I added mini chocolate chips to half of the batch right out of the oven; the kids really enjoyed that. Thanks for the great recipe!

What a waste of pralines, forget the crackers and just put the butter/sugar/tarter/pecans on wax/paper and serve.  I like the idea of the "cookie", but the honeymaid, put it over to the "too sweet" level.

I had to try these. It was a recipe too simple to pass up and with all the rave reviews I figured it would be harmless... and it was! Yay! Quick and EASY. I have to admit I was scared when they came out of the oven- they looked soo soft set n gooey. I let them cool while I ran some errands and came back to something that looked like it wouldn't come out of the pan easily, but it did and it was good. Thats the good- the bad is that I think I'll use less butter next time around(they leave greasy fingers)- so thats the worse I have to say about it- so, NOT BAD :) Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies are delicious and very easy to make!  When I remove them from the pan, I separate them and place them on waxed paper on the counter.  Then I melt and drizzle chocolate on top.

I've been searching and searching for this recipe.  I'm so happy to have found it.  These are wonderful and so easy to make.  People think I slave over these.  Best part is they remind me of my Grandma.  She used to make them and was one of her first recipes I ever made.  Thanks so much!

These were so easy, and made the perfect gift for someone who loves all things Butter Pecan.  I followed the advice to use the cheaper graham crackers.   They were so lightweight that they soaked all the caramel mixture right up.  It took them a while to cool, but they solidified almost into a toffee (like the recipe "Popularity Cookies" on AllRecipes.)   Definitely a keeper, and will make a great addition to my Holiday menus.

OMGoodness! These were amazing. Served them tonight at a dinner party and they disappeared. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and 
1) Lay the graham crackers flat in the pan, shave the edges with a sharp knife if needed. 2) Add the cream of tartar to the brown sugar and mix before adding the butter. 3) Stir the brown sugar and butter continually until it just comes to a boil. 4) Pour slowly over the crackers and spread to the edges with a spatula. 5) Let cool on the pan for about 5-10 minutes and remove to parchment paper or wax paper to continue cooling.

I did not care for this recipe and found nothing interesting or appealing in the taste or texture.  However, and it greatly pains me to admit this, my husband ADORED them :).  So even though I am not reflecting his enthusiasm in the star rating, and even though it is so hard for me to believe, I do have to admit that there can certainly be a very different judgement on the exact same product.

These were a big hit and so easy! I followed the advice of other reviewers and took it off the heat before it started boiling (as soon as the brown sugar was dissolved). Then I let it sit for about 10 minutes before I spread it on the graham crackers.

It is very good.  I was going to add pecans as the nuts but I saw "Pecan Lover's" Planters nuts (pecans, cashews and pistachios) and thought I would give that a try.  Ground them up in the blender.  Boiled the butter sugar for 3 minutes. and baked for 20 minutes. Probably 5 minutes too long but there was pooled butter on my crackers at the end of 10 minutes.  I used Honeymaid Honey grahams and got 15 (3x5)whole crackers (not broken into 4) on a low lip sheet pan.  Yummy

These cookies were great. Simple, tasty, and attractive. I cut mine into bars 1/4 the size ofthe graham cracker. I did not boil the mixture as the pther reviews recommended, and I also added vanilla. YUM

I doubled this recipe to make half with nuts and half without.  I got different results with the brown sugar and butter mixture, depending on how long I cooked it - one batch was softer and one was chewier.  I had no problem removing these from the pan.  They were cheap and easy and I thought they were pretty good so we'll be having them again!

This was a crowd pleaser.  It's very easy & doesn't involve shopping for a bunch of ingredients.   YOU MUST LET MIXTURE COOL FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE POURING MIXTURE ON GRAHAM CRACKERS.  Thank you to the reviewer that called this out.  This is important. As suggested by others, I didn't boil but let simmer for just a few minutes.  Good luck!

Light brown sugar and run makes them special.  If you use dark brown sugar, then it's a more toasty flavor.  Both work perfectly well.

Made this today! Used ~9x13 cookie sheet, which I lined with heavy duty foil and sprayed with buttery Pam then wiped off excess. Followed recipe using light brown sugar, stirring constantly, added 1tsp vanilla and turned heat down to low as soon as mixture started bubbling. Did not add pecans to syrup- spread thin layer of syrup over crackers, sprinkled pecans on, then drizzled rest of syrup over the top. Baked for 10 mins, let sit 10 mins before moving foil to cutting board to cool. Waited until firm before breaking into serving pieces.

I really liked the recipe, very simple and tasty. 
I did make two minor adjustments...used club crackers instead of graham crackers and baked at 350 degrees for 12 minutes. The lower temperature and shorter time was not long enough to harden the toffee.

I tried this recipe thinking it was be an easy to eat treat for a family gathering and my dad's favorite was pralines. No problems with grahams, but I had to make sauce 3xs.  First, I melted butter, added sugar, boiled and then added cream of tartar. It foamed up a little but got too thick and once I added pecans, I had to spoon blobs over the crackers. It obviously was not enough sauce to cover all so I made another batch of sauce and tried only bringing it to a boil all at once.  It came out thinner and easier to spread but I was worried that the sugar wasn't dissolved enough into the butter and it would have a grainy texture.  I made another half batch of sauce without nuts and poured that over a 3rd time.  Finally, after having them in the oven while I made all batches of sauce, they oozed together and I was able to take them out, cool a little, break them up and taste.  I was disappointed (maybe it is all in my head) because it just tasted like graham cracker with melted butter, sugar and pecans. I was thinking it would be similar to the toffee recipe made with saltines.  Next time I will just make praline candy.

I add a teaspoon of vanilla to the caramel mixture after I remove it from the heat.  I also use 2 cups of pecans to make sure the nuts don’t look skimpy on the bars.  My name for this cookie is “Pecan Crack” because people can’t stop eating them once they start!

Made this for a party and people loved them. The key, as one reviewer pointed out, is do NOT boil the mixture. Keep stirring it until it blends and then pour over the graham crackers. Oh and use foil over the cookie sheet to make removal easier.

I made this for my husband and family and everyone loves them! They are so delicious. I added vanilla extract 1tsp. after melting the brown sugar and butter, which knocked it out of the park!!

Superb! They are so easy to make and I had no problems whatsoever. Following the advice of others, I did not allow the mixture to come to a boil.  I also allowed the mixture to cool for 10 minutes before pouring it over the graham crackers. It's winter here, so after baking in the oven for 10 minutes, I cooled them outside until they were hard. Super easy and they turned out great!

I made it - but mine are still cooling.  Will taste in a moment or two...  It  was recently that I heard about folks making this recipe with graham crackers - I've always heard about them being made with saltines.  It's the salty and sweet that is the flavor boost!  That's why many recipes list them as Saltine Cookies.   Yep!  Yummy!

I'm not sure why this keeps happening to me, but my sugar keeps crystallizing on me once I put these in the oven. Everything is great up until the need to bake. I've even tried reducing the cooking time, with no such luck. I added about a half tablespoon of fresh lemon juice into the sugar, butter and cream of tartar mixture to avoid the crystallization during boiling on the stovetop, but it doesn't quite seem to stop it once it hits the oven. Such a shame, because the taste is quite good otherwise. As another reviewer mentioned, it *may have possibly been* my use of Honeymaid, since it seemed a coworker of mine didn't have issues with an off-brand cracker and we used the same method.

Made this as a part of an ice cream dessert. Followed recipe exactly, but let cookies completely cool the broke into small pieces.  Made a graham cracker crust in a 9 inch springform pan. Took a slightly melted 1/2 gallon of vanilla ice cream, cut it in half placed it in the springform pan and spread it evenly over the crust, sprinkled the small cookies over this.  Repeated with remaining ice cream and cookies.  Oops sorry, I also made another's batch of the sauce to pour over each half of the ice cream place back in the freezer until the ice cream was hard again. If you don't use all of the second sauce save it until you serve the "praline ice cream cake" pour warm over each piece.
