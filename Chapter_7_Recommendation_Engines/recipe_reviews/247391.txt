Easy and delicious! My husband loved this one; it reminded him of the muffuletta sandwiches we eat in NOLA! For ease, I used pre-chopped black olives, but note that they are diced really fine (like a tapenade). I also recommend using whipped cream cheese for easy spreading.

For one that does not like pimento stuffed olives I'm so glad I tried this. The combination of flavors are mouthwatering. The wife doesn't mind me getting into her pimento olive stash as long as I make these. Fortunately we always have these ingredients on hand so I will definitely make these again.

These are divine! Perfect flavors and everyone loved them. Will say this - these aren’t really “make ahead.” The pretzel gets soggy if you try to make and store in fridge. So, should be one of the last dishes put together for a get together.

Very delicious, quick snack. It gives me my muffaletta fix without having to stuff my face with a huge sandwich. I will make these again for my next get together!
