We really enjoyed this dish. I did kind of mess up though :( So I had to make some quick changes. Accidentally bought large eggs instead of jumbo so I was short on eggs. Since I only had two other eggs at home I had to improvise because my pasta wasn't really floating. So I added heavy cream. Not perfect but it worked well, so I don't think it came out the way it was supposed to, still delicious. I also used more cheese but I didn't measure it. I just shredded what I had left of my Romano wedge :) I'd definitely make this again (using the right eggs and no cream).

sorry, it wasn't really for me. it's not that there was anything wrong with it, but it was a little bland. i think a very similar dish can be made on the stove top within not even half the time.
