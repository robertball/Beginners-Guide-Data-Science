This is by far the best cheesecake I have ever made!!  I used about 3/4 of a package of Pecan Sandies with 1/4 cup melted butter for the crust, baked that for about 7 minutes then followed the recipe exactly. I set the cake pan on a double layer of foil and wrapped it around the outside, that kept all the butter and/or rhubarb juices in the foil, not all over the oven!  Then I baked it for 45 minutes at 350*,  shut the oven off and left the cheesecake in for another 15 minutes.  
The whole family loves it and we will definitely make it again and again!
Thanks for the great recipe!!

I tried three rhubarb recipes the day i made this...one cake, one pie and this cheesecake.  This cheescake was the best of the 3 I made AND I brought all three creations to work and again this cheesecake was rated the best of the three.  I had to make probably 15 copies of this recipe to give out.  It was SUPER easy to make.  I had one minor problem....when I baked the rhubarb mixture for 15 minutes as directed, the liquid created by the rhubard leaked out of my sprinform pan and into my oven and that gooey stuff turned rock hard on the bottom of my oven.  Oh well...the final result was sooooo fantastic, this little mess was well worth it and I'd do it again!!! Thanks!!!

Definately a 5-star recipe! 
The crust was perfect, neither too crisp nor too soggy, rhubarbs were soft and tasty, cream cheese was rich and creamy and the sour cream-topping added a final touch.

Fantastic.  I, too, added 1/4 c chopped pecans to the crust, used 4 c rhubarb, and made sure to put my pan on a cookie sheet (and was glad I did).  Delicious.

I made this for my dad's birthday, as his favorite desserts are made with rhubarb.  I do think it needed more rhubarb than called for.  That was also my first impression when I put it in the pan, but I didn't want to alter the recipe and possibly have it turn out wrong.  The rhubarb really cooked down to a very thin layer of rhubarb.  As a whole, it didn't have that strong rhubarb flavor I was looking for.  The sour cream on top was just fine, though I was not sure I wanted to add it, I'm glad I did.  I'd probably make this again, adding more rhubarb.

Made this for Easter and it turned out great! I added 1/4 cup chopped pecans to the crust and it added a wonderful flavor. Also used lite cream cheese and lite sour cream and both worked just fine! This is a great new way to use rhubarb.

What a great change from the everyday cheesecake.  The rhubarb gave this cake a great, unique, tangy flavour.  The crust was wonderfully different... like shortbread.  I'll definately make this again.

This cheesecake was amazing! I made it for a movie night during my weekend of rhubarb-madness. The shortbread-like crust was tasty on its own and I'll probably be putting that tasty sour cream topping on all of my cheesecakes from now on!!! I used half organic sugar and half raw sugar instead of white sugar, and I used 50/50 whole wheat flour and organic unbleached instead of regular all-purpose.

Amazing!!! Probably the best dessert I've ever eaten. I did add an extra 3 cups of rhubarb as reviewers suggested, and increased sugar to 1 1/2 c (due to increase of rhubarb). I will definately make this again and again. Make sure to use the sour cream topping-- unbelievably tasty!!

This was my first baked cheesecake, and the cheesecake part turned out wonderfully.  The crust however, was awful; it was soggy and bland.  If I make this recipe again, I will definitely use a graham cracker or digestive cookie bottom instead.

This is yummy!  I found it took a good 30 minutes more baking time than the recipe suggested.  My rhubarb is about 4 inches high in the garden, but I used it.  The stalks were so thin and nice size for the cake.  Sometimes the big fat chunks stick up and are harder to work with.  So go out and pull up some fresh fruit and get baking, it's well worth it.

I made this for mothers day! It went over very well. Very easy to make. I did not add the topping. I put a little brown sugar and cinnamon on top and made it in a 9"+ 13" pan. VERY GOOD!!

This is an incredible cheesecake.  I found that I did need to cook it longer in my oven, but otherwise did not change a thing. The crust was great!  The sour cream topping is a must!!!  When cooking I did place my springform pan on a foil covered cookie sheet, which I highly recommend because some of the rhubarb "juice" will cook out.  Thank you so much for my new favorite rhubarb recipe.

The flavor is spot on.  I added pecans to the crust and used 4 cups rhubarb as others suggested.  Here's what I had problems with.  One, the crust was partially stuck to the bottom of the springform pan.  Two, the cream cheese layer slides off the rhubarb when served.  Here's what I would do differently next time, line bottom of pan with a parchment round and do not lay the rrhubarb on bottom so flat, create pools and crannies for the filling so that most of the rhubarb is surrounded with filling.

FABULOUS recipe!!! Delicious and very simple to make.  I did add about a teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture as well as a couple pinches of freshly ground nutmeg.  Will definitely be making this one again!!

Excellent! When I told most people I had Rhubarb cheesecake for them, the reactions were "I'm not a big fan of rhubarb". This cheesecake changed their mind.  Not one naysayer in the group! Took precautions for leakage with a foil lined baking sheet, but didn't need it.  I ran the crust up the side of the springform pan a little and that seemed to contain the juices.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very good! I have a bar recipe that has similar ingredients, but calls for 5 cups chopped rhubarb and I didn't have that much rhubarb. Took this to a church supper and had no left overs and lots of complements.

Made this for a family dinner with my parents & grandmother - and they all loved it! The creaminess of the cheesecake is such a wonderful contrast to the tart rhubarb. The crust is also delicious - using butter made a difference in that regarind in my eyes.

I really liked this... I made a paste out of the base ingredients, and just spread into the pan bottom...it crisped up beautifully...a great cheesecake base!  I also used frozen chopped rhubarb..just add it frozen to the base, and cook for 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes.  Everyone loved it at my dinner, and I'll try the same recipe with raspberries as well...  Thanks for submitting this!

I wanted to make it in a 9x13 pan to take to work easier, the only thing I did differently was add another block of cream cheese and also another egg for the 1:1 ratio, I did also put a small amount of extra sugar into the cream cheese mixture. This was a fabulous cheesecake! Not overly sweet and the perfect texture. The rhubarb was a nice flavor in the cheesecake.

I made my own gluten free pastry case from this site (as DH is coeliac) and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. All the guests thought it a success all round! Thanks for sharing! Will be a "go-to" recipe from now!

Followed this recipe to the T and it was a hit with everyone.  I think I would try graham cracker crust next time, my personal favorite.  But it was very good and super beautiful!  I used fresh raspberries and blueberries on the top.

I love this cheesecake!  I can't wait for spring when rhubarb is in season.  It has the perfect blend of sweet and tart.   I think the next time I make this I will try a graham cracker crust....  I also like to sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on the crust before I put the rhubarb mixture on it.  I've found that this does best if you make it the day before and let it firm up in the fridge.   YUM!

Excellent!  Even works well with Splenda.  Be sure to follow the cheesecake hints (like beating the cream cheese while warm).

Definetly an easy and great cheesecake. I baked it in a water bath which I think made a difference in the texture and no cracks. I wouldn't change a thing about it.. Great recipe.

This was delicious. Having previously failed miserably at my one and only attempt to make a cheesecake, I was delighted to find that this had a lovely, creamy consistency and was a great idea for a fruit (I know, it's actually a vegetable) that's too often overlooked. I would highly recommend reading the tips on making cheesecake that you'll find on this site. I found them to be extremely helpful. The only thing about this that I disliked was the crust. In my opinion it was a bit too soggy and dense which I found to be a little unpleasent. I'd perhaps try making it next time with the usual digestive biscuit/graham cracker crust. But even with a soggy bottom, this was still a wonderfull cheesecake.

This is simply amazing!!! 3 things I did differently. . Added splash of vanilla to cheesecake batter... added small bag of chopped pecans to crust... baked additional 20-30 minutes. The crust is like a wonderful  pecan shortbread cookie and the rhubarb cheesecake is so soft and delicious! I will make this again and again!!

didn't care for the base, i substitued rhubarb for cherries as cannot get rhubarb anywhere, I noticed most cheesecakes call for 4 or 5 packages of cream cheese, this was only 2 packs, next time i will opt for more as not enough cheesecake mix, very thin layer. But it did taste good.

This was very yummy!  I used 1 cup crushed graham crackers and 1/4 cup chopped pecans with the sugar for the crust - everything else I did as per the recipe.  A great use for rhubarb!!

Very easy! My variation:  my husband is not crazy about sour cream, so instead of the sour cream topping, I mixed the sour cream and vanilla into the cheesecake like you would a regular cheesecake.  It turned out great!  I did have to bake it 30 minutes longer, too.

I brought one of these to my Mom's for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit - just delicious!  The only thing I did differently was to add about 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to the cheesecake batter (I always add lemon to plain cheesecake).  Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe!

I was worried about the sour cream topping and I did double the sugar and vanill for the topping. Great resipe highly recomened!  Thanks for sharing this one!!!  Carla

I made this for work and every one loved it. Several asked for the recipe.  I used one package regular cream cheese and one package light, light sour cream, increased the rhubarb to 4 c. as suggested by another reviewer and added ground pecans to the crust. This one is a keeper.  TRhanks!

This was exquisite! I added crushed pecans to the crust as someone suggested....I think you could also use Pecan Sandies cookies for the crust also...has the same sort of taste.  This was the perfect blend of tart and sweet. This one is a KEEPER!

Very delicious and super easy.  I scaled down the crust ingredients by one third because it would have been too thick.  I made it for a bunch of fishermen at the lodge where I work and they ate every last bit.  Will definitely make this one again!

I tried this recipe and liked the others it was great. I added a little twist to the crust. My family loves nuts so I added 1/4 cup finley chopped pecans. The smiles on their faces told me everyone loved it.

After reading many of the reviews prior to making.........I used 6 cups of rhubarb + another 1/2 cup sugar, added a tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the crust and 1/2 cup cup sprinkled on top.  I sprayed then floured the springform pan then pressed the crust part way up the sides after.  I placed all on a pan of water, baked an extra 15 minutes, removed to put the sour cream mix and sprinkled nuts on top then back into the turned off oven for 1/2 hour to finish.  It turned out perfect and told it is a must bake again and again!!!  Highly recommend this!!!

I love this recipe.   It is one that is requested over and over again at family gatherings and work potlucks.   Sometimes I make it in the springform pan, and sometimes I make it in a 11x7" pan.  Either way, it turns out wonderful!

Very yummy, the crust is nice and crunchy, the rhubarb could have used more sugar for it was a bit more tart that I like, but that's not the fault of the cake.  The cheesecake layer is great and love the sour cream topping.  Will certainly make this one again.

Absolutely awesome! Chopped rhubarb in food processor, which made it too watery and dripped on oven bottom, but that was my own fault.  I used store brand pecan sandies to save a buck and they were awesome!  Substituted whipped topping and cut up strawberries for topping.  Great spring dessert!

It isn't beautiful but it is absolutely delish! As suggested in previous reviews, I used Pecan Sandies for the crust (1 1/2 C. crushed Sandies, 1/2 C. Pecans sliced, 4 T. Butter) pressed in the bottom of the spring form pan and cooked at 350 for 10 min. To the rhubarb mixture, I added 3 C. Rhubarb (6 C. Total) and 1/2 t. cinnamon. In the cream cheese mixture, I added a dash of nutmeg and 1/2 t. Cinnamon. I waited for the cheesecake to cool on top before adding the sour cream topping and instead of sour cream, I used Greek yogurt and halved the sugar. I sprinkled the remaining pecans on top and chilled for two hours before serving. Absolutely wonderful. Will make again and try another variation of crust.

The crust tasted good though it stuck to the pan.  The rhubarb was crunchy.  The cheesecake layer was bland, it needs some flavor like vanilla or maybe lemon.  The recipe went into the circular file.  Really don't understand all the positive reviews.

This tasted amazing! Was looking for a different way to make rhubarb other than rhubarb crisp! I can only give it four starts though, because the crust really stuck to the pan and was difficult to serve. Other than that, it was excellent :)

absolutely fantastic, everyone I told I was going to make this was skeptical, but now they are all believers!  Thanks for such an awesome diversion from the traditional crisp and cobbler for rhubarb.

Really easy to make. A wonderful cake. Not too sweet (which I like). I put an extra cup of rhubarb in and also added about a cup of pecans to the crust. I also substituted vanilla sugar for about 2 TB. of white sugar in each step. added vanilla sugar iIt turned out wonderful. Will definitely make again.

I went to the store and they hadn't ordered any frozen Rhubarb (it's out of season so fresh wasn't an option).  In a panic I grabbed frozen blueberries and blackberries.   I used 3 cups blueberries and 1 cup blackberries.  I added 1/4 cup minced pecan to the crust.  I cooked in a water bath for 1 hour and then let it sit in the oven (cracked and turned off) for 20 minutes.  Put the sour cream topping on and tossed it in the fridge for about 12 hours.  Fortunately, I had the springform on a platter when I opened it - blueberry and blackberry juice spilled everywhere on the platter!  The crust held up though and it was AMAZING!

I thought this recipe used too much cream cheese.  If I were to try to make it again I'd try to tweak it so as to use only one package of cream cheese, not two.  My boyfriend liked it, but it gave him a stomach ache every time.

This was really good. It's a good combo of tart and sweet. I brought it to a 4th of July party and did not get to bring any home:(

This was delicious and different. My rhubarb still had a slight crunch, but I used frozen rhubarb as the fresh just vanished from the grocery store. I also used an * inc springform pan instead of 9 inch, because that's the size I had. Everyone liked it. Thanks!

Loved this recipe. I made sure to wrap my pan with foil to prevent leaking. I added 1/4 cup chopped pecans to the crust mixture. Used only 1 egg and 1 egg white. Took 55 minutes to finish baking. After cooling, I refridgerated it overnight and put the sour cream frosting on the next day. Garnished with sliced strawberries...so DELICIOUS!

First time tasting rhubarb and yayy I like it!!However, it was quite different and prolly won't make again. For some reason the crust stuck to the pan.. THe rest wasn't bad, unless of course you don't like rhubarb. I noticed way later that there's no vanilla, maybe that would have helped?? O well..Thank you =)

Mmm... what could be better than cheese cake and rhubarb. Next time make in glass pie pan instead of metal springform pan as rhubarb discolored the metal. But well worth it. Very tasty.

This was a wonderful cheesecake - the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the Rhubarb layer really should be doubled - of corse that's just My opinion :)  I Love Rhubarb.

Yum! A big hit at Mothers Day. The crust was firm and not soggy, the tart rhubarb takes the edge off the richness. The sour cream topping is almost unnecessary. Any tips on how to keep the sides from sticking when the pan sides are removed?

This was a great cheesecake recipe. I like the sour cream topping idea, it gives it a really nice finished appearance. The only thing I didn't like was that the rhubarb didn't seem to be cooked enough and it was a bit too firm and crunchy. Next time I might try to so one of three things 1)Use frozen rhubarb, 2)Cook the rhubarb slightly beforehand, or 3)Make a stewed rhubarb mixture and spread it on the crust.

Absolutely the easiest cheesecake I have ever made!  The taste was unbelievable! Like a previous review I added chopped pecans to the crust.  My husband and I had never eaten rhubarb before and based on the smell prior to cooking thought we wouldn't ever!  Even my 3 year old loved it! Thank you so much for a great recipe!

this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. I used frozen rhubarb and put more in than called for. I used pecan sandy cookies with extra chopped nuts in it because that was all I had left. It was the last out of 8 I made.

Excellent! Easy, fast, tasty, great texture. The only thing I did different than the recipe was to double the amount of rhubarb. If I made it again, I would add even more. This is a keeper and I will definitely make this again.

Turned out perfect. I lined my spring form pan with parchment paper but I don't think it was necessary. 
My only substitution was the crust. I used crushed vanilla wafers with butter. I baked just the crust first until light brown and then cooked again with the fresh rhubarb. 
I did increase cook "setting" time for the cream cheese topping to about an hour and let sit in oven (turned off) for a couple of hours.
The sour cream topping was ok but it would probably have more flavor pop with some whipped cream.
I topped with some crushed vanilla wafers and drizzled caramel sauce (just cause).
Nice addition to cream cheese recipes.

This was a disappointment. I love cheesecake and rhubarb pie. Putting the two together seemed like a good idea. Soggy crust. Neither the rhubarb nor the cheesecake were very good. Nobody would have a second piece.

Excellent cheesecake, however, I highly recommend spraying the baking pan before putting in the crust base. I used a non-stick pan and still had a hard time lifting the servings in one piece.  This is an easy to make recipe, lovely crunch crust, enjoyed by everyone.  I also recommend following the recipe as written, THEM making changes, if necessary, for the next time you make it.  Some reviewers said it needed more of this layer or more of that, so, needing to feed 10, I thought I'd increase some of the ingredients.  The end result, the cake just didn't need it.  Would have been nicer looking servings as it was originally written. My mistake and have given the recipe 5 stars.  I'll be making this again soon.

Great cheesecake recipe! I took the advice of others and substituted the Pecan Sandies crumbled cookies for the crust (no flour or added sugar to the crust). Also, I only had frozen rhubarb so if you choose to go this route, use 6-7 cups of frozen, thawed rhubarb . Make sure to drain it well because it produces a lot of fluid. I like to end up with 4 cups of thawed rhubarb. Since I am using more rhubarb than the recipe calls for, I add more sugar (3/4 cup) during the second stage when you're adding the rhubarb, sugar and flour together.

My family and friends LOVE this!  It is not as sweet as many dessserts -  the tartness of the rhubarb balances the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake. Wonderfully!   An optional, accidental version of this came late in the rhubarb season last summer when I had only 2 cups of rhubarb.  I added one cup of chopped strawberries to make 3 cups of fruit!  Delish!

I make this every spring, for work. It’s turned those non loving rhubarb people into fans. Advice, you may think it will turn out runny because after the crust and rhubarb are baked, it’s a little juicy. Don’t worry, once the cheese cake is cooked and cooled, it sets up perfectly!

Scrumptious!  I wasn’t sure about using rhubarb alone as I love it with strawberries but this was extremely good.  I would definitely make it again.  Another review thought their should be more rhubarb so I used 4 cups and added a little almond flour to the crust.

I made it and it was so easy!  Great summertime cheesecake! I substituted slices of pound cake for base and pressed it together instead of using butter, flour mixture. Cooked for same amount of time.  Wasn’t sure size of spring form pan to use so used a 10” which was fine.  A 9” would work as well and cake would be a bit thicker.  Just follow directions and you will be fine. Oh yes! Loved it.

This recipe is the reason for rhubarb!  I’m not using my rhubarb for anything else!!!!
  I’ve made this with a prepurchased graham cracker crust and as the recipe directs...  both are amazing.  On my last bake, I added more rhubarb than it calls for to finish off our crop’s produce and ended up with almost equal parts rhubarb/cheesecake and it was amazing!

I just made it for the second time, it’s so delicious!! I made no changes, except to add a dash of lemon juice to the cream cheese filling. I had trouble realeasing the cake from the spring form pan the first time, so this time I remembered to line the pan with parchment paper.

Easy to make and was a hit with my whole family. My brother said it was one of the best he has had. Made the changes as reviewed by adding an extra cup of rhubarb as well as half a cup more of sugar. Baked it for an extra 15 minutes.

I've never made a cheese cake well before and this came perfect. I do agree with most of the suggestions here, use a graham cracker base to avoid a soggy crust as rhubarb goes quite mushy and way more rhubarb than directed.  (6 cups would be good) But great recipe.

Very easy to make.  If you have never used a spring form pan before with cheesecake you need google directions.  They recommend baking with a pan of water in the oven.  Do the research.. it’s worth it.  :). .. the recipe was great and the cake taste great too.  I used a graham cracker crust.

Added extra tbsp of flour and tbsp of tapioca to the rhubard. Crust was ok but will use graham crumbs next time for more flavor in crust. Used light cream cheese because thats what i had on hand. Worked fine! Increased baking time by 8 minutes. Put springform pan on baking sheet lined with foil just in case anything leaks out but it didnt. Think the tapioca and extra flour and tapioca made it set up just right. Definitely make again! Was awesome!

We have rhubarb in our yard and cheesecake is my boyfriend's favorite dessert; made this for his birthday and he loved it.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly - but we didn't really like the crust.  Since then, I have made a graham cracker crust and then followed the rest of this recipe.  If you like rhubarb and cheesecake, this is a must-try!

This is the best cheesecake we have ever had! My Hubby is a cheesecake fanatic and he says this is the one. Only thing I did different was use vanilla bean instead of extract and I added anise to the cream cheese and sour cream topping. Making today for quilt guild potluck, definitely a keeper!

This is the most delicious recipe. It does take more than 1/2 hour in the oven and as some suggested, a bit more rhubarb is good. 
I have made this several times and I think the secret to having a robust rhubarb taste is leaving the rhubarb pieces large. Some of mine were 2 inches long and quite wide. 
Also, the sour cream frosting is delicious on this! 
Always put a cookie sheet under it or you risk a big mess! I put my cookie sheet in cold and think I should have warmed it up. I overcooked the crust one time previously and that was the very best one!

This cheesecake was easy to make and tasted great; I would make it again, but with changes.

First, if you want a tangier rhubarb flavor, use more than is called for. I used at least four cups. I would also cut back on the sugar - 1/3 or 1/4 cup. I also added a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.

Second, this cheesecake did not really firm up. I chilled it in the fridge for over 24hrs, and it was still a little scary taking it out of the springform pan. It held up, but I would prefer a firmer texture.

Third, I would skip the sour cream topping altogether. I was hesitant to add it, but other reviewers said it was a must. Again, if you're looking for a really tangy flavor, skip the topping. Next time, I will do a rhubarb puree and drizzle it over each slice as its served.

Finally, the crust was surprisingly good. I didn't think it would hold together or have much flavor, but it was a very tasty take on shortbread. Unfortunately, I lost a lot of it in in the pan, so I might line with parchment paper next time. I could see this working well with a traditional graham cracker crust or even a nut-based crust, too.

Overall, it was a good recipe, just a little sweeter and softer than I would prefer.

very good and easy to make.
I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, increased the rhubarb plus the sugar flour ratio. I added a bit more of the cream cheese and egg mixture- increased by 1/3. 
give it a try.

Great at is, especially because I'm not a huge rhubarb fan! I think that soggy bottoms are just something you have to deal with when using rhubarb. I did cook the crust for 5 mins to see if it helped. Next time I think I'll use more rhubarb (4+ cups), maybe cut back on the sugar a hair, and put a pan under to catch what boils over. Added 5-10 mins to the cook time.

I made this  for a dinner at my daughter and son-in-law's home. My daughter loves cheesecake and my son-in-law loves rhubarb. Need less to say, there were no leftovers! Easy to make as well.

I love the bottom crust!  I will be using it instead of graham cracker crust on my regular cheesecakes.  Nice balance of tart and sweet.

I make a lot of cheesecakes, and this was truly yummy and not at all difficult.  I brought it to a party that night and it received rave reviews from many people.  I made no changes to the recipe.

Loved this! I had a 10-inch springform pans so I used 5 cups of rhubarb and one-and-a-half timed the sour cream topping.  Also sprinkled crushed pecans on top and used light cream cheese and light shot cream.   Even my physical trainer liked it!

This was excellent!  Everyone loved the sour cream topping, it was perfect for the rhubarb and so refreshing.  I did make two important changes (and would probably do the same in future):  I only had one package of cream cheese, so I cut the cream cheese ingredients in half (i.e., one egg, half the sugar).  This makes the cake less dense and really allows the rhubarb flavours to come out - we all thought it was enough cheese.  Also, I was running low on sugar, so in the sour cream topping I used icing sugar instead, and just added to taste (I'm not sure how much I eventually put in).  Would definitely make this again - perfect summer recipe!

This is my new favorite rhubarb recipe. I made it is a 10 inch glass pie pan because I don't have a springform pan, and it came out perfect. I used 4 cups rhubarb, increased the sugar a bit and added 1 tsp cinnamon. I baked it for 40 minutes, turned the oven off, opened the oven door and let it sit for about 20 more minutes to firm up. It was perfect!

Made it as written and was very good. Next time I will put another cup of rhubarb in. It seemed to be best the day you make it. I made it in the morning and it was delicious by dinner time. Had leftovers the next two days and became very dry even wrapped in plastic wrap. Will definitely make this again for a bigger crowd.

This is absolutely my favourite cheesecake ever!  Maybe even my favourite dessert ever.  It got even better on day 2!  So good.  Can't wait to find some fresh rhubarb and make it again.

I made changes because I used rhubarb that I had frozen from my garden.  After thawing, it had way too much liquid, so I drained off about 1/3 cup of the water (this was from approx. 4 cups rhubarb). I baked my crust separately because I was afraid the rhubarb mixture would ruin it since it was so watery. While the crust was baking, I put my rhubarb mixture in the microwave to thicken (I increased the flour to approx. 1/4 cup, and 1 cup sugar to the 4 cups of thawed rhubarb). I microwaved for approx. 5 minutes and then spread the thickened rhubarb mixture onto the baked crust. From there, I followed the recipe and it turned out great. My husband told me to add it to the top of the list of his favorites!

The crust is rather tasteless and because of the moisture in the rhubarb it really doesn't stay crisp.  I did follow the advice to add in the chopped pecans and that helped - but on its own the crust doesn't live up to the rest of the recipe and actually ends up detracting from it. The second thing is the lack of a flavor in cheesecake layer. I again followed reviews and added vanilla which was a good choice.  Lemon or orange would also work as long as you used it in the sour cream layer as well, but it certainly needs some flavor addition.  I added an extra cup of rhubarb in the fruit layer and was glad for the extra. I did not increase the sugar and found that to be a good choice.  Put this all together and it really is a surprisingly good result.  We will probably repeat this next summer with these changes, but will definitely do something completely different for the crust to make it live up to the rest of the dessert.

I didn't have enough rhubarb, so I mixed in nectarines and raspberries and it was AMAZING!!
Plus, no one ever told me just how simple cheesecake could be!
Thank you!

Very yummy and easy to make!  I served it still warm and it was a hit but the chilled leftovers also amazing!  I did 4 cups rhubarb (and so a bit sugar/flour) and almonds in the crust.  Also baked 45 min then turned off the oven and let sit inside for additional 15.  Juices did leak so I appreciated the advice to put a juice catcher underneath.  Tin foil folded up at edges worked just fine.  Highly recommend this recipe:)

First ever cheesecake, made with 4c frozen rhubarb from last season, thawed in a colander to drain excess liquid. I used lite cream cheese and sour cream. Needed extra 30 mins in the oven to set. Fantastic! I will return to this recipies often. Will try baking the crust separately for a few minutes next time, to get it a bit more "shortbread-y."

This was my first try with a cheese cake it was delicious and easy to make. My husband and stepson loved it, making it again for Father's Day. I think this recipe will be on the top of the list for desert requests from those two.

A great way to use up that rhubarb in the garden. I think recipe could use double the rhubarb, or a rhubarb sauce served on top.  Crust tasted like shortbread.

Really like this recipe! I made it with all purpose gluten free flour because we have some intolerance in the family. Was a little worried how the flour would do, but it was good. After baking the crust with rhubarb I noticed a lot of liquid from the fresh rhubarb. I used a baster to suck out some excess liquid before adding cream cheese mixture. After the 30 minute baking time, I turned the oven off and left it for an additional 15 minutes. Cheesecake consistency was perfect! I didn't have issues with crust sticking, but I made sure to grease the pan well.

I was skeptical, but we loved it.  My fiance refused to eat it at first, saying she wouldn't like it.  She then tried one bite, and let out a litany of expletives before exclaiming how good it was.  I do think I will try the Pecan Sandies crust mentioned by another poster, but honestly, I didn't breath long enough to taste the crust.  I inhaled, and it was gone.

Yummy and not intimidating to make. It is essential to bake the crust-rhubarb layer longer (45 min.) as recommended in the AR magazine. I subbed Splenda for sugars. Will surely make again.

Very good cheesecake, I love the shortbread crust. As for my personal taste though, I'd rather have a plain cheesecake. Good alternative rhubarb recipe though.

I loved this way to use rhubarb. Everyone who tried it also loved it. The crust was perfect! Next time I'll add an extra cup of rhubarb.

I did not care for this recipe for a few reasons.  The rhubarb was crunchy in this dessert because it was not baked long enough and I didn't think there was enough sugar.  The topping really didn't do a whole for me either...could of left it off.  It wasn't the worst, but just wasn't my kind of cheesecake.  I was dissapointed because I love rhubarb.  Maybe I need to try it again with some tweeks!

Sour Cream Topping:  Added some mascarpone and 50% more vanilla, but 50% less sugar.  This combo was so good I left some to drizzel on freshly cut mango!

Very good cheesecake.  I thought there was too much butter in the crust as it came out quite greasy.  I will only use 1/4 cup next time.  Pecans would be great too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best cheesecake ever! I'm not a fan of cheesecake but I loved it. It has just enough sugar to counter the tartness of the rhubarb and was very quick and easy to prepare. I added a small dash of cinnamon and a sprinkle of orange zest to the rhubarb mix and also a sprinkle of the orange to the sour cream topping. My 9 yo gd had 2 servings and was talking about having it after school for her snack ;-)

This is definitely a 5 star recipe.  Make sure you put your pan on a cookie sheet or you will have a real mess to clean up.  Everyone raved that the rhubarb had just the right amount of sweet sour taste.  Definitely a keeper!

This really wasn't too good; I can't taste the rhubarb well. I think the sour cream topping was the worst part; and using defrosted light sour cream might've been even worse because it was very thin. I was really excited about the crust tho! (Not that it has a distinct taste.)

This was fabulous! I didn't change any of the measurements, but did use stuff like whole wheat flour, organic sugar, low-fat cream cheese, low-fat sour cream... Was definitely the hit of my movie night! Served it with a slice of strawberry on top and everyone just gobbled it up; even those that had never had rhubarb before.

This was good.  Not great, but quite good.  I loved the cheesecake rhubarb combo -- it was much tastier than expected!  That said, the cheesecake portion was the part that was mediocre.  It did get better with age, however.

I just made this one but I will not know how it is until my family tries it. I will say that I used a soy sour cream and soy cream cheese in place because of allergies.   This was my first one. It was very easy to make and looked good. I used smaller rhubarb chunks and frozen.   I will update when I hear how it turned out.

perhaps i had defective rhubarb, mine was still crunchy and runny which made the crust soggy.  And i followed it exactly, by that i mean i didn't do ANYTHING different from the original. won't bother trying to cook rhubarb ahead, wasn't that impressed with cheesecake layer flavor.

Excellent recipe!  I made this as a surprise for my husband's birthday and got rave reviews.  The rhubarb was perfect in the recipe and added just the right amount of tart to the cheesecake.  I followed the reviewers suggestions and added chopped pecans to the crust and it was delicious.  I also cooked in a water bath which kept the cheesecake from cracking or sinking.  Will definitely make again!

The flavors sound great together. But I must have done something terribly wrong. The texture was terrible. My first time making a cheesecake, and I'm afraid to do it again. We threw the whole thing away.

I also used about 1/4 cup chopped peacans in the crust which is wonderful!  I increased the rhubarb and cut back on the sugar, but I wish I would have done one or the other.  It was a little tart, but my husband loves it that way.  The sour cream layer hides any imperfections from the cheesecake cracking.  Wonderful recipe!

This recipe is decent, but I carefully followed the directions and poured the cream cheese mixture directly onto the rhubarb hot from the oven... and think I scrambled the eggs in the process! The resulting cheesecake was decent overall, but had a hint of eggy taste and texture--not something you want in a cheesecake!

I loved this recipe.   It turned out great. Lots of rave reviews from my guests.   One note of warning - because my spring form pan was metal - the rhubarb started to corrode(sp?) the side of pan even though the cake was only in the plan for about 3 hours.  Not sure what can be done to prevent this from happening.

This is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. So easy to make, too. Made exactly according to recipe, except I used 4 cups of rhubarb because we love it. Sour cream topping is a nice touch.

This tangy and light cheesecake got high accolades when I served it at Mahjong nite, even after it had been frozen for two weeks and thawed.  It didn't have the sticky layer at the bottom I was hoping for and will bake the first part a bit longer next time in anticipation of that.

I've made this twice now and both times everybody has just loved it.Once was for Christmas Day. Didn't change anything and as I've got lots of rhubarb growing will certainly be making it again.
