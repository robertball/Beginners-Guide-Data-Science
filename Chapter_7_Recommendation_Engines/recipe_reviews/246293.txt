Very quick recipe!
1.  Extra fennel is ok, too!
2.  Fennel seeds add a bit more anise flavor but are not a good substitute for an anise liqueur.
3.  Thawed frozen organic peas are a nice addition in place of the carrot. 
4.  Save plenty of fronds for garnish.

Loved it - thanks for posting this recipe! We received a fennel bulb in our CSA this week and this recipe was the perfect fate for it. It was popular with both my kids, and went really well with sourdough bread.

Pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting onion for the scallions (didn’t have  any), and adding a bit of a red jalapeño with the bell pepper. It was good, just not fantastic. I thought it was a bit lacking in taste, but hubby said he really liked it, so maybe it’s just me.

I did make a few tweaks but made it pretty much by the recipe. It is very nice. Great consistency, subtle background and finishes well with finely chopped and sauteed fennel fronds. I will definitely make it again----maybe substituting acorn squash for 1/2 the potatoes.

A very flavourful and creamy soup. I added the optional ingredients. This is a very nice way to use the outer sections of the fennel that typically get used for broth. Thank you for this unique recipe.
