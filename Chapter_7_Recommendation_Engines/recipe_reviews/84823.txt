This was delicious.  The pepper adds a nice unexpected kick to it.  I also made it with plum wine and it was fabulous then as well.  Perfect for a sweltering summer day!

This marinade was absolutely delicious!  I used a variety of summer fruits and berries, and marinated in the wine, honey, and OJ mix.  I did not use the spices, whimped out, as the fruits were so ripe and flavorful, I just didn't want to mask their beautiful true flavors.  Served in a carved watermelon.  A hit!

I used a muscat (a white dessert wine) because I am out of dry white wines & while I enjoyed the muscat, I think a dry wine would be a better component. I poured the marinade over  galia melon & cantaloupe balls & served them for dessert in a wine glass garnished w/ mint...thanks for a very nice dessert on a hot summer evening. Next time I will use the marinade on a wider variety of fruit...nectarines would be very nice.

Delicious! I made it with Honeydew and cantalope. I wasn't sure about the black pepper, but it really complemented the sweetness of the fruits and marinade. I really liked IMVINTAGE's suggestion of making this with nectarines - I think I'll try that this weekend. Thanks!
