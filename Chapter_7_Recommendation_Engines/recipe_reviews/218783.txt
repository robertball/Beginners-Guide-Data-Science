I made this exactly by the recipe and it was delicious! I didn't simmer the mixture for a full hour but it was still thick and full of flavor. I halved the recipe and there was plenty for four servings. My grocery only had puff pastry sheets not cups so I improvised with those; therefore my "cups" might have been a little larger. This would be a great recipe for company too.

I didn't use the sweet onion hot sauce or garlic. I used seafood stock instead of vegetable stock. My husband and I loved it. It was my first time making a crawfish dish and this was perfect. I will definitely be making again. Loved how simple and easy it was to make. I also only made a pound of crawfish and used all 12 pastry shells and made 12 pies instead of 6 small and one large. It was enough to fill all 12 shells.

The first step of the recipe calls for just the melted butter with the flour and vegetables and then simmering for an hour. It seemed much too thick to hold up for an hour of simmering so I added the vegetable broth before beginning the simmering. Did I do this incorrectly?

Pretty much followed the recipe. Used bacon drippings for the butter (and less of it) and added more heat. I did cook the roux for about thirty minutes before adding the vegetable mixture for another thirty minutes of cooking. The college daughter and her BF dropped in so I added some cooked shrimp to "beef" it up before baking.  Made a fantastic Cajun dinner with boiled seasoned corn and potatoes and stuffed crabs! WOW! Thank you so much for sharing!
