Man, these are super!  The red pepper gives an added sweetness and is less bitter than the green ones regularly used for stuffed pepper recipes. I didn't use the rice or the chicken broth, instead cooking the meat in some soy sauce and a smidge of olive oil. I chopped 3 scallions, 4 cloves of garlic and half a red onion as the flavor base and cooked them with the meat.  I also added about 3/4 cup of corn and only used about 3/4 of the can of tomato sauce, and had enough filling for 4 peppers instead of 2....hurray for leftovers!!  A keeper and one that I will definitely be making again.

Fabulous!!! We loved these yummy peppers and I did everything according to the recipes except I had no allspice so I just did without it and I added a bit of garlic salt too. We also put some extra white cheese and parm. cheese too. They were so pretty. I love pretty food and colorful peppers never disapoint. We will have this lots and lots.

It was great.  We have been craving stuffed peppers.  I had no all-spice so I added some minced garlic and a pinch of cumin for some zip.  We covered them with grated cheddar cheese and a spinkle of parmasean because you can never have enough cheese!

The flavor of these is very, very good. I doubled the meat - and would probably triple it next time - so you may also want to do that if your family is as carnivorous as mine. Otherwise, nicely done. I used a combo of yellow and red pepper halves, and topped mine with shredded parmesan (but used grated for the filling). Thanks!

This recipe was amazing!!!! I loved everything about it and so did my boyfriend. I decided to use chicken instead of the ground beef. I broiled the chicken for about 30 min and then shredded in into the rice/sauce mixture. I also decided to bake the access rice in the oven with the stuffed peppers. Delicious. This is recipe I will be making again very soon.

I think these are incredibly tasty. The rice/beef mixture has a great flavor - definitely not bland or boring. It blends prefectly with the taste of the red pepper too. My boyfriend ate the whole pepper, and he hates vegetables. Nice and filling as well. I couldn't imagine using white rice (what I normally cook with) as opposed to brown. This recipe just has a great flavor. And it's fairly healthy as well, which is a bonus!

These were SO GOOD! The only thing I added was a bit of chopped jalapeno, and a bunch of extra cayenne pepper because I like my food spicy! I will definitely make this again.

This was very tasty! I've always liked the inside of stuffed peppers but had a hard time actually eating the pepper itself.  The red pepper was the perfect solution!  

I was a bit nervous after tasting the seasoned meat mixture before I added the sauce.  The allspice was a little much at that point.  I was surprised to find the allspice blended in perfect in the finished product.  

Only sub was white rice for brown because that is what I had.  next time I will cut the recipe in half.  Neither my husband or I could finish more than half a pepper. Great recipe! Thanks!

This was pretty good, a different flavor than the usual stuffed pepper.  The balsamic vinegar gave it a nice tanginess.

I love red peppers more than green.  These were pretty good. I am not a fan of allspice so I probably would reduce it next time.

Fabulous dish! You hardly know you are eating brown rice. The balsamic vinegar adds a real great flavour to the sauce. I doubled the recipe and had leftovers for lunch...even better the next day! Also added about 1 cup of canned tomatoes to the sauce and feta cheese on top.

The only ateration I made was the addition of chopped garlic to the meat and onions.  Really, it wasn't needed.  I also added some pepper to the meat mixture.  Other than that, I made it as published.  It was a little more time consuming to prepare than I originally had planned, but it was worth it.  A great recipe that will become a staple in our house.

VERY tasty.  Customized this to my taste, and of course used ground turkey instead of beef; it turned out great. I HATE stuffed green bell peppers, but have a new found love for red peppers and will definitely make this again.  I could see how you could substitute couscous or another grain for the rice if you wanted to...lots of variations could work.

We loved this recipe. It was more flavorful than any other Stuffed Pepper recipe I have tried. I will make this again and again. I used Jasmine Rice which was a nice twist but everything else was as the recipe stated.
Thanks for sharing!

We really liked this. I only had green pepppers, and although the husband thought they worked fine, I thought they tasted too bitter. Would definitely recommend sticking to the sweeter red pepper.

I changed the meat to Sweet Italian Sausage, and used fresh parsely and basil, instead of dried. My 4 year old son said "Mommy, this is really so fantastic!" and scarfed it up!  This recipe was also a HUGE hit with my husband, who said it was "delicious!"  The recipe is pretty easy, and very tasty! Loved it!

This is an excellent recipe that I almost ruined. I wanted to double it as I had 4 peppers. I only had two cans of sauce and thought we needed more sauce than that so I added an 8oz. tomato paste and another 1/4 cup of broth. It was a little too thick and sort of tasted more like meat sauce than tomatoe sauce. If I had kept the ingredients as listed intead of  adding the  tomato paste it would have been perfect. It was still good and even better the next day. Just stick with the tomato sauce and it will be fantastic. Will definitely be making this again according to the original recipe. Thanks for a great recipe Brenda.

This recipe tastes delicious when made as written.  I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the chicken broth as I didn't have any.  The cayenne adds a nice kick and the allspice and balsamic vinegar give the dish a depth of flavor that most stuffed vegetable recipes lack.  My husband and I both loved it and I will be making it again soon.

Excellent! I doubled the meat, added all of the sauce, and stuffed 4 peppers with the mixture. Very very good! I might add diced squash and spinach next time!

The whole family loved these, including a 2 yr old and a 4 yr old!  The only change I made was decreasing the cayenne by half, as I wasn't sure how my kids would like it if it were too spicy.  I'll be making this again!

Unbelievably great! Followed recipe to the tee. 2 cups of rice to 3 cups of water.  Start rice first, since it takes the longest to cook.

Used red peppers (highly recommend over green)-par-cooked as described, in microwave.  Used ground pork and no broth.  No allspice and it was AWESOME!

I was a little nervous when I read this had balsamic vinegar and tomato sauce.  The former is very yummy but acidic, and the latter can be, well, a little bland.  I was afraid the taste of these two would overpower the spices.  WRONG!  This is a delicious stuffed pepper recipe.  Due to it being February, I used orange peppers instead of red.  I also did not have cayenne pepper so I used chili powder and mozzerela cheese instead of parmesan.  This recipe was AWESOME!  I made it for my host family and everyone loved it.  The man of the house even told me I should open my own restaurant!  Haha!  This is an awesome, versatile recipe with a super unique flavor.

Delicious stuffing for the peppers!  Use of the red peppers was a nice change of pace, too.  I will make again.

This earned 2 thumbs up at our house.  I don't like green peppers but these were so much sweeter. I microwaved 3 peppers for 3 minutes and that seemed to be just the right amount after they were baked - slightly firm, not mushy.  And the recipe did make plenty of filling for 3 large peppers.  I did not use the allspice but threw in a handful of frozen corn to the mix.  Used a Mexican mix shredded cheese for the melting at the end.

Good, solid recipe.  Used lentils instead of rice (diet reasons), a touch more onion than called for, added mushrooms and didn't use the chicken broth (used water instead with a touch of Italian seasonings). Something seemed missing, but not sure what.  Perhaps because the lentils needed more spice than rice?  Topped with a bit of extra cheese about 10 minutes before finished.  For our tastes, this needed more sauce, so next time I'll use more sauce and try a bit more spices and top with fresh basil before serving.

Great flavor.  I had extra rice/hamburger mixture and warmed it up the next day for lunch.  It's a nice dish on its own if you don't have any peppers on hand.

It was good, but not delicious.  I agree with the review that said the peppers are lacking some pizzaz.

Really enjoyed this and so did my husband.  It  looked really impressive with a ring of bright green broccoli around it.  I have about a third of mine left for lunch tomorrow because it is quite large.

Absolutely delicious!! I had not made stuffed peppers in a very long time and this recipe couldn't have fulfilled my craving any better!! I didnt microwave the peppers before hand because I wanted a bit of crunch at the end which was accomplished. I left out the broth and tomato paste and instead used a can of diced tomatoes. I had no Parmesan so I added a bit of Italian bread crumbs to the mix and topped with mozzarella cheese!! Sooo good! I have leftovers for lunch today and Im so excited!

The filling is absolutely delicious. I didn't have all spice, so I just omitted it.  I also didn't have chicken broth or parmesan, so i substituted with water and half a slice of American cheese (It was all the cheese i had), and this was still incredibly delicious.

This was amazing! I despise rice, so I origionally was just making this for my family. But I tried some, and loved it! This recipe might have changed my views on rice. Changes I made were omitting the cayenne pepper and allspice, instead i used italian seasoning and garlic chips. I doubled the sauce and onion. This made 4 large red peppers cut in halves, and I had leftover mixture as well. Was easy to make and will make again, thanks for the recipe!

This was SO good!  I don't usually like stuffed peppers, but it was really delicious with the sweet red peppers and the zesty filling and sauce.  I was a little wary of using so much dried herbs, but I'm so glad I did.  I'm not a big fan of ground beef, so I cut that down while using 3/4 cup each cooked brown rice and cooked pearl barley.  I also threw in half a can of corn for a little color and texture.  It was the best meal we had all week!

My husband and I thought these were terrific!  The only other stuffed peppers I had ever had always seemed a bit bland, but these had LOTS of flavor.  I added garlic powder and used ground buffalo because that's what I had and they were really very tasty.  I had a lot of extra filling and will use it this weekend to make mini poppers for a party.

Absolutely wonderful!  I made some modifications to the recipe for my tastes but these should affect the over-all taste.  First, I did not microwave my peppers before baking - I like mine a little more al dente.  Second, I didn't have any allspice so I substituted a lesser amount of cinnamon.  I also only used half the amount of meat called for and substituted soy "burger" for the other half (I swear, my husband never knows when I do this!!).  Cooking times were perfect.  I will make this again.

This recipe is a great start at these peppers, but I think needs a few notes.  The recipe as we made it makes more stuffing than 2 peppers worth...so we've started using 1 pd of ground beef and using up the 6 pepper pack available at Sam's Club.    Also, we've started microwaving the peppers a 2nd time after baking, because they are too crisp for my taste, but are always perfect the next day for leftovers...so we treat them this way straight out of the oven.    This is one of our favorite recipes (we have used basil or parsley because we didn't have it on hand, and the recipe still turns out fabulous!

This was very, very good, and the stuffing was very kid friendly. Instead of cayenne pepper, I used paperika, and instead of all spice I used season salt. Absolutly wonderful. It had a lot of items but it went very fast.

This is a good dinner. Based on some reviews I read, I leave out the chicken broth and rice and use a 12 oz. can of tomato sauce, and add minced garlic to the meat/onion mixture. I make brown rice separately and serve it with the peppers, the extra tomato sauce makes enough to serve some sauce over the rice. Delicious!

This is my third stuffed pepper recipe from this site and my least favorite; I hated the allspice. The ground beef results in more calories than the Stuffed Peppers My Way and I feel that the spices are overwhelming. I won't make this again, sorry.

I followed the recipe mostly, doubled it though, and I used ground chicken. The husband says the sauce was a little too tangy though. So I mixed in some half and half into sauce. Maybe use less vinegar next time. All in all something I would make again. already added to my recipe box.

Delicious! Added a little more cayenne and some red pepper flakes because I was looking for a spicier flavour. Subbed pizza sauce because I didn't have any tomato sauce but the flavours worked well anyway.

Great recipe!  I doubled it to serve four.  I used ground turkey and instant brown rice.  I didn't have allspice, so I left that out.  Next time, I will leave out the chicken broth.  I don't think it needed it.  The taste was delicious...three out of four of us said it was a keeper!!

Fantastic flavors! I'm new to cooking, and I couldn't believe I'd made something that tasted THIS good! Yum! Easy for a beginner, too. Note that I substituted green peppers (not red) and white rice (not brown), because that was what we had on hand. It still worked perfectly! This recipe is going into my permanent stash.

My wife and I LOVED these... however the mixture makes A LOT, so make sure you get extra peppers. We were able to fill twice as many peppers as the recipe called for, which wasn't necessarily bad, great leftovers!

I found the filling was way too much than what would actually fit into the peppers. I had so much filling leftover, that I made a rice bake the next day. And the filling was kind of bland, so I had to doctor it up quite a bit.

As a male I am new to cooking, but I love it.  This site is great. I made this recipe for 4 and it was awesome. Some of our friends do not like garlic so this recipe was perfect.  I did hold back on some of the allspice based on the other reviews.

I made this dish for my girlfriend on Valentine's Day and it turned out great.  The red peppers add some sweetness to go with the savory meat/rice/sauce filling.  This is also a great recipe to use as a base for improvisation - I mostly stuck to the script this time, but substituted ground buffalo meat for the beef.

I only made a few changes.  I did not pre cook the peppers but roasted covered one hour.  my allspice was old so I increased the amount some.  Added a touch of garlic powder as well.  I used regular  rice as that is what I had.  Very nice flavour.

These were very good and flavorful.  I made some a couple of changes though. Instead of putting the peppers in the microwave, I put them into a pot of boiling water to soften then and I used white rice instead of brown rice. Other than that I followed the recipe as is and it was a hit.

My bf and I LOVED this recipe. Instead of using plain brown rice I used Zatarain's Spanish Rice (it just comes in a box) and I'm glad I did- it added even more flavor to the dish. I didn't have cayenne pepper but I didn't even notice its abscence. My bf just added some red peppper flakes on his to give it a slight kick. I used pecorino romano cheese instead of the parmesan. Also, I used beef broth instead of chicken broth. Lastly, I added some sliced mushrooms. Since I varied the recipe just a bit, I can't give it a full 5 stars since I don't know what it would taste like if I followed the recipe 100%. But it was very delicious.

changed the recipe slightly, used 8oz of a sauce like salsa instead, chopped up 2 scotch bonnets and mixed that instead of onion (had none) and onion powder instead of all spice and salt free mix instead of basil (again, had none). had to cook the peppers in the remaining rice so they wouldn't fall. it came out amazing, a definite make again, wonderful recipe.

We really liked this recipe.  I made a few changes: omitted allspice and did not make sauce as written.  I just used tomato soup with half a can of water, seasoned it, and then mixed it with the ground beef and rice mixture.  That didn't seem 'saucey' enough, so I added another half a can and used the remaining half with 1'2 a can of water and some basil and used that as a sauce to pour over the peppers once were in the baking dish.  Very tasty!  I will definitely make this again!

Great Recipe!  I was looking for a new recipe to use for my abundant supply of red peppers from my garden. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  Although I thought my peppers were large the filling made enough to stuff 4 peppers.  I will make these again!

These were so yummy!  My boyfriend was very pleased.  I've made it a couple of times already and am never disappointed.  Even my three-year-old son likes them, well the stuffing part at least.  Last time I added corn.  Next time I'm going to add maybe mozzarella or swiss cheese.  I think I'll layer it in the pepper while I'm stuffing it.  I also added most of the sauce to the stuffing itself instead of topping with it.  Oh, yeah, one more thing...We added a dollop of sour cream at the end.  Fabulous!

I used ground turkey and doctored it with garlic salt, fresh grated nutmeg, dash of red pepper flakes,and a little black pepper.  I took the tops of the green bell pepper (store didn't have red) and diced it, then cooked it with the onions.  Other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe and topped the peppers with jack cheese because I ran out of grated parmesan.  Oh my goodness gracious, my sweetie and I gobbled them up with every bite tasting better than the first -- ADDICTING AND HEALTHY!!!!!

These are great!  I only added a little extra garlic and cayenne pepper and some basil.  The sauce is great (I accidentally put in T of vinegar instead of t and it came out fantastic!)  I did roast my own red peppers, but will be buying them already done next time.

This recipe is wonderful. I tried it exactly except with white rice (all I had) and my husband and I both enjoyed! The last time I used green peppers because they are cheaper and it is still tasty. Definitely a keeper!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  These were absolutely fantastic.  I didn’t even know that I liked stuffed peppers.  The key is to use the RED peppers.  We did substitute the ground beef for ground turkey and it turned out great.

Amazing... I made some slight variations.  I used 1/2 ground pork chorizo and 1/2 ground beef, basmati rice instead of brown, and vegetable broth instead of chicken.  I also added garlic, coriander, cumin, chives, black pepper, and jalapeños to the beef mixture.  This made enough to fill 4 peppers.

These were very flavorful - a great combination of spices.  We will be adding this to our dinner menu in the future.

I made these for dinner this evening and I have never made stuffed peppers before. My husband has a habit of comparing a lot of meals to the way his mother makes them and he loved these peppers. I added spinich and an italian blend of diced tomatos to this recipie and a Roasted Garlic and Bell Pepper spice blend too. Delicious!

I never review- too lazy. These were unbelievable! Didn't have allspice but used cinnamon and nutmeg. All of the herbs and spices make a traditional, standard recipe come to life!

These were fabulous! I doubled the recipe but only used 2 cups of brown rice instead of 3. I also added a little bit of corn. Prep time is WAY more than 25 minutes, more like an hour, in addition to the cooking time.

My husband and 12-year-old daughter rated this a 3.5.  I would rate it a 3 based on the original taste. It was very bland so I had to keep adding flavor before I stuffed the peppers. My daughter does not tolerate spicy things, but little did she know that I put in nearly a 1/2 TBS of Tabasco and more cayenne. I did put corn into the meat mixture, because it did sound like a good thing to do and tasted good.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Great dish! I never thought to add chicken broth. In fact, I even cut back on the tomato sauce so that the sauce was more like a brown gravy - it was delicious. The balsamic vinegar was probably my favorite additive. We put our peppers over organic whole wheat pasta. Thanks for the recipe.

Made these for a group dining club and they turned out ok, nothing special. Most people ate the stuffing and left the peppers. Would make this again if the stuffing was more flavorful
