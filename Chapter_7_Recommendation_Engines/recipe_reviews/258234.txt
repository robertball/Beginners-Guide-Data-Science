I am the submitter of this recipe and want to let you know that I add 16-20 packets of Truvia depending on how sweet the strawberries are. That turns out to be about 3/4 cup or a little less of regular sugar. I don't believe 2 tbs is enough sweetener.

I will be making this again! My husband actually liked it! My husband doesn't like drinking water, and his sweet tea and PowerAde have so much sugar! I love that I can control the amount of sugar in this. I made half a batch and used a heaping 1/4 c of white sugar. I will try a batch with Splenda and see how that turns out. The only thing I changed was to strain a good portion of the strawberry seeds out. Thanks for a great recipe, Yoly, especially with the summer months coming!

I scaled the recipe down to 1 serving, used frozen spinach leaves I had put in baggies in the freezer, and subbed stevia for the sugar. A nice, refreshing, healthy drink!
