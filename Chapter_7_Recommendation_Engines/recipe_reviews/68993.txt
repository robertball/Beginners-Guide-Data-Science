I used the AR recipe for biscuit mix, and added 2 tsp. sage because I used turkey sausage.  The recipe was easy to make, and tastes great!  By using 2 8" pie pans instead of a 9x13 pan, I baked these for only 30 minutes.

I just made this to give as gifts and have gotten rave reviews.  I made them in mini loaf pans and they were the perfect size.  My husband is just going on and on about how awesome this is!  I'm going back to the store to get stuff take make my third double batch!  FYI . . . on the second batch, I didn't drain the sausage because I didn't think there was very much grease, but it did prevent the bread from rising as much as my first batch, so I would definitely make sure you drain the sausage.

this bread was excellant ..with a few modifications i read a lot that "bread was good but dry" so i doubled the milk an added a few splashes of half an half also added some olives an sharp cheddar. THE BREAD WAS GREAT AN VERY MOIST! hubby took a loaf to work an it was gone! this is a def keeper!! Also pay special close attention to baking time making sure not to over cook, you wont be disappointed.

Very good!  I used 1lb. of "hot" sausage instead, cuz I couldn't find the sage.  It was a little dry, kinda crumbly, so next time I will add a little more milk.  The taste was very good, and we all enjoyed it!

Tasted just as good as I thought it would.  I even changed up some of the ingredients just so I wouldn't have to go to the store, and it came out great.  It's apparently a versatile recipe! One criticism: I will cook it somewhat shorter than recommended next time- probably 30 minutes then check.  This first batch came out a little too overdone.

This was really good. My only complaint was that it was a little too salty. Next time I'll cut back on the salt.

Really salty. I might try it again, but I would definitely cut down on any salt.

I loved this recipe!!  I added about a 1/2 cup more swiss cheese because I am a cheese lover. I made it on Xmas Eve, put it in the fridge for the next morning and just heated it up for Xmas Day breakfast.  All my 3 male roommates loved it and they all said it should be a tradition every holiday!  I noticed that the better it is, is because of the sausage.  I always get homemade sausage vs. store bought and it tastes much better with homemade sausage.  I wonder how it would taste with breakfast sausage?

Fed a crowd with this and was easy to make.  I used the pan I browned sausage in to make a momlette, And yes, the leftovers worked too!

must add 1/4 to 1/3 cup extra liquid; too dry as-is. Tastes like the Jimmy Dean sausage cheese balls, only in a pan.

I used a roll of mild breakfast sausage & added a handful of green & red peppers I needed to use up. I baked it in an 11x7 pan because I had used all of my 13x9's. It was slightly overcooked at 25 min(10 min less than the suggested baking time), so keep an eye on it! Great flavor, just a little dry, which could be because of overcooking.

I loved it after I made some changes. I always make a recipe as written the first time I try it out. This was too dry when made as written. I now make them as muffins, using less Bisquick and more milk. I canâ€™t give a measurement because I add each until it is the consistency I want. I will make this again

Per suggestions, I used 2/3 cup of milk and omitted the salt.  I added 1/2 cup cheddar (we love cheese), and accidentally left out the butter.  It was still fabulous and a hit with everyone who tried it!  This reheats well, is perfect for brunch or as an appetizer, and is much quicker and moister than making sausage balls.   There are so many easy variations that can be done with switching up the types of sausage and cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!
