Stop!  If you're looking for a flavorful dip, don't choose this one.  I took it to a family gathering and everyone said it was bland -- missing something.  I looked at the recipe again and should have known.  It has no salt, worcestire, garlic or anything really flavorful.  If you do make this one, add some spices.  I felt like I wasted a whole batch of dip.

This dip is a hit at every party. To keep it soft and easy to dip for large parties, I dont bake it, but instead mix it up and put it in a crockpot set on warm with chips on the side. This dip is better than what most restaurants serve. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is absolutely the best recipe for artichoke dip I have ever tried.  It is always a huge hit at parties, and everyone asks for the recipe!  I have found that the flavors blend better if mixed the night before and refrigerated until ready to spread into a baking dish and heated.

I used this recipe on several occasions throughout the holiday season with great success.  I incorporated some of the comments from other reviewers and used mexican shredded cheese substituted 1/2 reduced fat sour cream for 1/2 the mayo.  I  also made the recipe ahead of time,divided the recipe in half and froze it for later use.  Of course you do need to allow more time for cooking but it was great to have on hand.

This was the best spinach and artichoke dip i've ever eaten.  Its even better than the ones cooked at a local restaurant and I didn't think anyone could have a recipe better than theirs!!!!  Thanks!!!!!!!!  It lasts forever and you can freeze it and defrost it, then you can heat it up and its as good as when it was first cooked!

I made this as an appetizer for my parents they loved it!  I even added a little crabmeat to the top when I baked it.  It was fabulous.  How dare they charge so much in a restaurant when you order from their menu!

Wow! I come from a family of fabulous cooks (I'm trying to get there myself!). I made this recipe for one of our gatherings and everybody was asking for the recipe!  Since I can't stand mayonaise, I used 1/2 a cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of mayo and added another half can of artichokes.  Delicious!

By far the best Spinach & Artichoke Dip I've ever made!  I've made it over and over and it absolutely disappears at parties as everyone wolfs it down. Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  My brother even likes it and he normally can't stand anything with mayonnaise. Great to serve with tortilla chips or sliced baguette.

Excellent! I had never made a artichoke dip before, but a friend asked me to make one for a party, and it was devoured.  I took other people's tips and I went 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo, and I added a bunch of garlic.  I also used marinated, already chopped, artichoke hearts, which actually made throwing this together a breeze.  I will definietly use this one again!!

This is THE ONE Spinach Artichoke dip recipe. Be sure to thoroughly drain the spinach, wrap with paper towels then newspaper and press to extract the liquid. Excellent.

Wow was this good!  We went to a friends house for a party and she served this and then I had her e-mail me the recipe.  She did the 1/2 mayo 1/2 sourcream also.  I did change a few things myself...  I used 2 cups italian seasoned cheese (seasoned with pesto and garlic) and instead of the mont. jack cheese I used Asiago and then did the Parm. cheese on the top.  The Asiago just gives it a little extra kick. Also I put extra artichokes in and leave them a little more on the chunky side. This is a new staple in our home for a quick hot snack : )
Thanks!!!

Excellent recipe and very easy. My suggestion is to add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic and instead of Monteray cheese use pepper jack. It adds a little kick and your guests will love it. A big hit!

I made this 5 minutes before my guests arrived for a party. It came out delicious. I served half of it in a pumpernickel bread bowl and the other half with lime-flavored tortilla chips. It was a hit!

This dip is FANTASTIC!  I added a bit more cheese than the recipe called for and I also ran out of room in the oven so i made it in a crock pot! It worked great!

So so good!  I added sundried tomatoes to mine.  I found some at the grocery store that were in a jar.  They were in olive oil with some kind of seasoning.  I chopped them up and added them.  Phenomonal!  I also added a bit of garlic.  If you'd like a more creamy dip, use less cheese.

This is great dip.  I made some small changes as suggested by previous reviewers.  I only used 1/2 cup of mayo and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I also added 3-4 cloves of crushed garlic (we are garlic lovers)! It is always a hit!

I don't have a food processor so I just dumped the drained artichoke hearts in a bowl and mushed them into smaller pieces with my fingers.  I used the creamed spinach and didn't drain it so I cut down on the mayo.  An italian mix of cheeses instead of just parmesan gives it more flavor.  I also added some garlic powder and dried minced onions.  I had planned on taking this to work tomorrow for a Christmas potluck but there may not be any left!  Great recipe!

Very Good!  Made this for a party New Years Eve.  I used a 16oz bag of spinach and added about a 1/2 C more of everything else.  Rather than Monterey Jack cheese I used a mexi-blend.  I also used light mayo.  Yum Yum YUM!

This dip was great!!! Better than the resturant versions I've had.  I put in Pepper Jack instead of Monteray.  I also added green onions.  It was just wonderful.  Thank you soooo much for this recipe!!!!

Good recipe. However, it was much better when I cut back on the mayo and substitued a 4-blend pizza cheese package for just plain parmesan.

This is SO good!  I took a couple of reviewers suggestions and substituted 1/2 of the mayo with sour cream.  I used a (9oz) bag of fresh baby spinach in place of the frozen.  And I also used an Italian blend of cheeses and added 3 cloves of roasted garlic.
I also made this in my crockpot, which was perfect because the dip stayed hot the whole time.

My guests *raved* about this dish and asked for the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is DELICIOUS and so easy! I have made it many times and always get rave reviews!! My husband, who hates artichokes and spinach, finally tried it and LOVED IT! I use low fat mayo and add one clove of minced garlic! Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!

What a winner! This dip is incredible and addictive. I substituted 1 cup of the Monterey cheese w/ a cup of Pepper Jack and it gives it a wonderful kick! No need to grease the baking dish as the cheese will not stick. This one is a definite keeper. I make it for our family all of the time and will continue for years to come!!

This dip is incredible.  I refuse to eat Spinach and Artichoke dip and restaraunts anymore, because it doesn't compare.  I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it.  My boyfriends makes requests for it all the time.  If you serve this with warm sliced French Bread, it's off the hook!!!!

This dip had good reviews at my BBQ, however next time I make it I will alter it a bit.  I would add an additional can on artichoke to balance out the cheese.

i have had a lot of diferent dips and I love this one b/c i don't like spinach cooked but you really can't taste it since there is so much cheese.

My college-age son asked me to make him a spinach-artichoke dip, so I tried this one, as I'd never had or made any before. He raved over it, so I'll be making it for whenever he can come home from school. I used marinated artichoke hearts (2 jars of them), and used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream. It was great w/ tortilla chips, reheated beautifully in the microwave. Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

This dip is so easy to make, I even put it in the microwave for about 5-7 minutes instead of baking it.  Also put a little paprika on the top, great recipe!

YUM! was super leery of using just mayo so I added a 1/3 of a block of cream cheese and also a crushed garlic clove. SO good! Don't think it would have needed the cream cheese, but it's still good :-) may add some crushed red pepper flakes next time (or to the tub that went into the freezer) for a little kick.

I always keep these ingredients on hand to make this yummy dip when friends stop by.  I only use one cup cheese because I like the texture better.  I also bake longer about 30 minutes, it just didn't seem done after 15 minutes.

I changed it a bit. I added some more spices like onion and a little garlic. I also added some worcestershire sauce. I didn't have monterey jack so I used provolone cheese.

2 stars because it was easy, but this dip has no flavor at all. I don't think that anyone ate it- I ended up dumping all of it. I think that there were too many artichokes in it, not enough mayo. Maybe it would work by doubling the mayonnaise and adding a bunch of seasonings, but for me, it was really missing something.

I only gave it 4 stars as is... after a few additions, its a 5 star!  Add 1tsp worcestershire sauce, 1tsp lemon juice, and a clove of minced garlic (2 if you love it)- fresh is best.  I do more parm than monterey and mix in all cheeses- I threw in a chopped tomato too for color. FABULOUS!

I pre-made this a night before, I intended to add some seasonings but forgot.  After I baked it I tried it and decided to add a little garlic and onion seasonings.  Much better with than without.  Very yummy.

Great recipe.  To get the richest flavor, I had 8 strips of fried and crumbled bacon.  I found the cheese to be way to much.  Using  slightly less than 1 cup is what I have settled on.  I have never served this and had leftovers.  It is incredibly easy and you will get nothing but rave reviews.

This wasn't as good as some I have had but it went fast at the party I brought it to.  I used my food processor to chop the artichokes and spinach and that worked well.  I did the half sour cream/half mayo combo as well.

What a terr ific recipe!! We substituted a Mexican cheese mixture instead of the plain Monterey Jack and it didn't melt as well as the Monterey Jack probably does, but it was still delicious! We put it in a hollowed out bread round and used the bread from the round to "dip" the dip. Everyone in the family loved it!! It is extremely easy to make and very tasty. Better than the Spinach Artichoke dips you find in restaurants.

This dip is delicious and a huge hit at parties.  I substituted pepper jack cheese for the monteray jack to add a bit of spice.  I served it in a hollowed out sourdough round with warm pita bread brushed with olive oil.  Very yummy!

I love this recipe!  I've made it many times and it is so easy and well-received.  At Christmas I accidentally used pepper-jack cheese instead of monterey jack and my family LOVED it!  It gave it a nice kick and made it really stand out from other versions.

Changes:
I only had 1/2 cup of mayo so I used a package of cream cheese also.
 I used a bag of salad spinach instead of frozen. 
I also added a little salt & pepper as well as garlic salt.

Its pretty delicious. I'm going to end up eating it all by myself!

I went to my personal recipe list, looking to upload recipes to share, and came across this one from Simmig.  So much for uploading my own, but clearly the BEST version around.  I won't even eat S&A dip in restaurants anymore, because I'm always disappointed!

This is the best spinach artichoke dip recipe that I have found.  I altered it a little, using 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream and adding 2 cloves of garlic minced.  Delicious!  I made it for a party and keep getting asked for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Pretty good.  I would use a little less mayonnaise next time.  It seemed a little rich, but maybe because I used marinated artichoke hearts.  Husband didn't like at all.

Yum!  This dip was great!  Everyone at the BBQ loved it.  The spinach seemed a little overpowering of the artichokes, so next time, I will try adding 2 cans of artichoke hearts!  YUM!

I used a tad more spinach and wished I hadn't. It came out a bit dry, but only due to user error. The flavor was pretty good. I also added two minced cloves of garlic, just because. But I could imagine it without it and it would've been great anyway. Next time I might try adding a shallot. But great recipe and everyone loved it!
Will definitely keep it in a crock pot next time to keep it creamy and hot.....it got cold sitting out and became not quite as appetizing, I think, because there was still a lot left. But kept hot,
it would've been totally gone. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but needed more flavour.  I used 1/2 light sour cream and 1/2 light mayo as I thought all mayo would be too oily.  I think next time I will add some fresh garlic, sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  Bottom line is that this is a good base recipe.

Delicious! I added a sprinkle of red pepper *the kind in the shaker at pizza parlors. and about 2 T of chopped jalapenos from the jar. It was super good.....Oh, i didn't have Jack so I used Cheddar. Its was great. I served it with garlic bread. All of my friends basically licked the dish clean. :)

Quite a good recipe!! I did add some cream cheese and some various shredded cheese to add some depth.  I split the recipe in half and used one half to make as written and the other with chopped broccoli instead of spinach. It was surprisingly good! Everyone was pleasantly surprised by the twist!

Like everyone else I put my own spin on this and it turned out great. I substituted 1/2 cup low-fat mayo, 1/2 cup low-fat sour cream for the 1 cup of mayo. I also used pepper jack instead of monterey jack. And I added 3 cloves minced garlic and 1 teaspoon dried, minced onion. Great for parties! Enjoy!

This turned out deliciously. I'd like to say I followed the recipe 100%, but I just eye-balled the mayo and added a LOT of cheese, both being parmesan and monterey jack. If there ever an option to add or not to add more cheese, I'd always opt for more cheese. My boyfriend and I LOVED it, and practically finished the whole thing between the two of us as we rang in the new year at our apartment.

Our 15 year old daughter made this for guests on Christmas day.  For the 1 cup mayo, she substituted 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup cream cheese.  She added about 1/2 a package of cooked bacon, & salt, fresh pepper, garlic & onion powder.    The four stars is for easy prep, ingredients that we usually have on hand. However, her additions made this a keeper recipe.  You might consider this a starter recipe that you use can add and enhance as desired.

I have been making it for years, and have probably served it to more than 50 people over that time.  No one has ever said it was bland; in fact, most people love it and ask for the recipe.  It is simple to make and delicious.  I normally cook it at 375 degrees for at least 20 minutes until it is lightly brown and totally bubbly.  I suppose you can add some seasonings if you prefer, but this is quite delicious as is.  Also, make sure you drain the spinach thoroughly and squeeze dry.

I've just made this spinach and artichoke dip and it is definitely one of the best I've ever tasted! I also used half mayo and half sour cream and because my family love sour cream so much I added a little extra  and it is absolutely fabulous!

This is a good starting point, but it needs a little help. I omit the Monterey Jack cheese and use one block of cream cheese instead. It gives the creaminess that the dip needs. I also add 2 garlic cloves. When it comes out of the oven, I salt to my taste and then add an additional sprinkle of parmasean.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving. Everyone who taste this wants the recipe. I do my own modifications, I add two cloves of crushed garlic, s&p, and place mine in the crockpot. That way it stays warm, when you bake this it is sooooo good for the first 15 minutes, but then becomes cold, hince the reason I use the crockpot. Yummmmy :)

I was a little worried about this recipe because of another reviewer; but it was a huge hit! The other women in my family are excellent cooks so I'm always intimidated. I'm so grateful to those of you who make comments. I made the dip the day before, as suggested, and the favor was wonderful. The original recipe says that it serves six but this easily served 12 as an appetizer.

I've made this recipe a bunch of times now and it always gets rave reviews. I use marinated artichoke hearts. Much better flavor!! I sub half the mayo for sour cream, add a tsp or two of chopped garlic, and I usually use a mix of monterey and colby. I also mix in a little bit of the juice from the marinated artichoke hearts. This recipe is really easy to make and really yummy!!

This turned out great.  I made it the night before and stuck it in the fridge.  The next day I popped it in the oven for 30 minutes, and it was good to go!  It tasted better than the stuff I've gotten at restaurants.  The guests loved it, too.

This recipe is a keeper. I didn't have any artichokes,so defrosted a handful of shrimp and minced them. I also did the 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo and added garlic with a drizzle of lemon.This dip never lasts that long in my house. Even my 9 year old loves it and he would never eat spinach or shrimp.

Yummy! I used half mayo and half sour cream and a shot of white wine. I had to use Mozzarella instead of Montery Jack. Next time I'll try the MJ cheese. It took a little loger to bake, but I watched closely and it came out great. My daughter loved it. What a great way for her to eat veggies! I'll be making this again.

excellent.  This one was a big hit with my family.  I will be using it over the holidays.   I added a little cream cheese and used mozarella and not as much as the recipie called for.  I cut up a bagette and popped the small slices in the oven to use in the dip.

I really enjoy this recipe and whenever I make it I get rave reviews.  For those who think it bland, try adding one clove of garlic crushed, and a splash of lemon juice.

Wonderful.  Very easy and every bit as good as the dip we love at the Claddagh Irish Pub.  I serve with Triscuits because I think it needs the salty taste.  Bread was just a little too bland.

Good dip but next time I'd probably use a little less spinach as I thought it was a little overpowering and couldn't taste as much of the artichokes.

This was really outstanding.  DH loved it...said it was the best he has ever eaten.  Made it for guests and they wanted to take the leftover home.  SUPER easy, too.  I was shocked at the small list of ingredients.  I did add some minced garlic.

This dip tasted really good but was a little bit too thick and cheesy and didn't get quite heated through after just 15 minutes.  I would use only 1 cup of monterey jack next time.

What a great recipe!  Sooo addictive!  Made this for a bridal shower and noone could stop eating it!  However, I did change a couple of things from the original recipe.  Per suggestion of a few other comments, I used half sour cream- but instead of mayo for the other half- i chose to use Miracle Whip.  I like the flavor it adds better than mayo.

Everyone loves this.  I use pepper jack cheese for extra flavor and serve it with tortilla chips. I also use salsa as an accompaniment to this dip -- the two flavors together are great!

I admit, I had my doubts about a hot mayo dip. But it was the highlight of my dinner party. I had to recite the recipe to at least five different people. I'll make it again for sure.

Loved it! I cooked it exactly as written with no ingredient changes!  It was perfect as is!  I served it with oven-toasted pita bread sections (brushed with olive oil) and with Tostitos.  Was a hit with my husband (who usually sneers at mention artichokes & spinach) and with my parents and with me! Plan to make this one again (& again)

Made this dish twice last weekend for 2 separate parties (only planned to make it once, but it was so good and easy, I changed my menu for the second party and made it again). Everyone raved about it, and scraped the bowl clean!

The EASIEST, BEST  recipe for spinach artichoke dip ever! Look no furthur. However it doesn't call for any salt, pepper or spices. Make sure you add these!! I added salt, white and black pepper, crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning, fresh garlic(or garlic powder) and drizzled a little olive oil over the top! I used " veganese"instead of real mayo because it is what I had, but it was great and I will always use it instead. Came out amazing, will be my go to from now on!
FYI**I didn't use the exact measurements the recipe called for because I was making it in a small ramekin for two people, not a large serving. I actually just eyed the whole thing and stirred it all right in my baking dish. You don't have to be super precise with it just make sure it has almost an even distribution of veggies and cheese and mayo!(add a little more spinach then you think you should) justMake sure the veggies are coated well! And don't forget the olive oil drizzle instead of pre greasing your pan! ENJOY!

I made this recipe.  Substituted sour cream, no mayo.  Followed the recipe but added 2 cloves garlic, pinch a salt, couple twists of ground pepper and a dash of hot sauce.  FABULOUS!

This recipe is so good! I used to make another recipe for this dip, but this one is much better w a few changes. It definitely needs at least one clove of garlic, some pepper, and use 1/2 cup mayo and a little more than 1/2 cup light sour cream.

This dip was good but a little too cheesy. I will make it again though. Next time I am going to shoot for a creamier base with a bit less cheese. One thing I did differently was to add pepper jack cheese, it was pretty tasty. What I disliked the most, no fault to the cook who posted this, was the saltines of the dish itself. I have been using sea salts for so long that the salt used in most things is overpowering, so next time I will use a low sodium salt and I think that will do it. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Huge hit at Xmas eve dinner! I added an extra can of artichoke hearts and a 1/2 cup of sour cream, simply because I had them and wanted to make a little more dip. So yummy! Those were my only changes.

Instead of mayonnaise, I used sour cream. I also added salt and pepper to taste and about 1 1/2 Tbs of heavy whipping cream for a rich flavor. It came out great!

This recipe was ok however sort of bland. So I decided to add a bit more. I added 5 oz cream cheese, 1 1/2 tsp garlic, 1 tsp of black pepper and 3/4 tsp Zatarans blackened seasoning. After doing so I dont think I can eat this dip at a restaurant due to this one being the BEST I have ever had!

I wasn't overly wowed by this, like it's missing something, maybe some garlic.  I did do the 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream tip and used fiesta cheese instead of the monterrey jack.  I also use fresh spinach as I can't stand messing with the frozen kind...so maybe it's my mistake adding the changes!

very tasty dip, but so oily!!!! every five/ten minutes i was opening the oven to blot out the oil. i ended up cooking it much longer than listed (part because of the opening and closing, part because i wanted it more brown than the picture). i brought it to a gathering of friends and one person loved it so much, ate too much and was sick because it was too much oil for her system. very sad. but ultimately, extremely tasty.

I love the recipe, first I took some advice and added salt... Personally, it was too salty and the canned artichokes that I used were well salty enough.  the only thing that I did on the second batch was add some chopped garlic, dried onion, and some chedder to top it off.  I have never had leftovers with my neighbors with this base reciepe!  It's good on it's own for my taste, and it's good with alterations!  Thank you!

Sooo yummy!  I made this the night before and let it sit in the fridge...just baked it in the morning and it was good to go.  The only change I made was adding 2 cloves of minced garlic, which really added to the overall flavor.  It was a big hit and I can't wait to make it again!

I could not find Shredded Monterey Jack Cheese at my grocery store, so I bought a 10 ounce block of Cracker Barrel and shredded it-used the entire package, but it was perfect.  Even the kids loved it, served it with the Bunny Bread Recipe and will make this again.

Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Great recipe.  Used a mixture of romano and monterey jack cheese, as well as the parmesan.  And added about a cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes.  A big hit!

The taste was okay after adding s&p and sautéing garlic but I was hoping for something more creamy. This was very thick! If that's what you're looking for- try this. If you want more of a dip- try another!

In my opinion, the key to a great dip is not letting it get cold on the table!  If you have a crockpot - use it!  I made this for a party and was already using my crockpot for crab dip (mmm I'm from Maryland).  So I used a two-tier plate/pie rack, put the dip in a glass pie plate on the second tier, and put another glass pie plate with water and floating candles on the first tier.  It looked neat and kept the dip warm! :)

This recipe was excellent. The only thing I added was a little garlic salt because a few people said that it lacked flavor. The dip was gone in about 10 minutes.. I will definatly be keeping this one in the archives.

This recipe was fabulous and so easy.  I love onion, so I added about 1/4 cup of finely chopped vidalia.  It was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again.

Sometimes I sub the Monterey Jack with Mozzarella cheese.  And, I like to add a bit of garlic powder or minced garlic.  My guests can't get enough of this dip.

Delicious and very easy to make!  I made this for a church gathering and everyone loved it.  I also substituted 1/2 cup sour cream for 1/2 of the mayo and added some salt to taste.  I accidentally added extra cheese (didn't read that I was supposed to sprinkle the last bit on top), but I didn't have any complaints :).  Almost everyone wanted the recipe.  I'll definitely make this again... and again and again :).

Very good and very easy recipe.  I used marinated artichokes, added some italian seasoning, some chopped garlic and ground black pepper.  I had a shredded 4 cheese blend, which really added lots of flavor.  I may try using 1/2 cup of Mayo and adding either 4oz of whipped cream cheese or ricotta cheese for a bit of a different texture.

Everybody loved this recipe.  It makes alot so before baking put some aside in the freezer for another time.  It tasted just as good.  I did use 1/2 cup sourcream and 1/2 cup mayonnaise instead of the full cup of mayonnaise like others suggested.  thanks for the recipe!!!!

This is great! So simple, yet tastes fantastic with french bread or tortilla chips. Definitely requires a hot plate or such to keep it warm, though; when I get the chance I intend to try making it in a slow cooker so I can hold it over low heat for parties. I will post how well that works when I can.

Wow!  Was this fabulous!  At the party we pretty much stood around this bowl and ate! And I had made a double batch!  Great with a hearty crostini or with Triscuits - it's quite haevy to dip.  Next time, though, I will put it on a warming tray to keep it more melted.  (Naturally, the cheese hardens as it cools).

I have made this several times now and it is always a hit!  I do add one clove of minced garlic and use less cheese.  This is also a good recipe if you are eating less carbs.

This was good but I would add something like Alfredo sauce to make it creamier. I would also cut back on the spinach since it overpowered the overall taste.

First and foremost--you must double the recipe!  IT'S THAT GOOD!  (Your guests will be so disappointed if you run out of this one. )  I find it takes about 45 minutes to bake until a nice golden brown on top.  I am careful to cut the artichoke into very small pieces.  I have made it several times.

I made this recipe “as is “ except substituting half the mayo for sour cream. Yum! It was a big hit all around. I did freeze half of it for later use as it makes a substantial amount and we only had 6 people. I served with both pita and tortilla chips. People could not stop eating it!

Yum! I couldn’t find Colby Jack Cheese in the store I went to so I used mozzarella cheese in place of it. I also prepared it and let it sit in the fridge for two days before making it. It came out great! Thanks for such an easy delicious recipe! I know what I  am taking to my next food event or potluck!

This dip was easy & quick to make, a winner as a "go to" appetizer prior to a casual dinner or just to enjoy with a glass of wine.  I played with the cheese combination a bit, adding a little Romano Asiago blend to the Monterrey Jack that the recipe called for, Parmesan was added as per recipe.  I added some dehydrated white onion bits, ground pepper and seasoned salt.  The recipe yielded enough to split in 2, even 3 portions, freezing the remaining dip in small containers for later use.

Made this for the first time to bring to a party.  It was excellent.  I've made other artichoke dips before, but this was a new recipe for me with the addition of spinach. I followed the recipe exactly.  There were several other types of dip at the party and mine went the quickest.  Can't wait to make it again.

This was super easy to make and tasted fabulous.  I actually pre-made mine, placed in the fridge and then cooked it after guests were here.  By having it in fridge chilling I had to bake it for 25 minutes instead of 15 to make sure it was good and warm all the way thru.

Simple and yummy! I will make it next with some garlic and hot sauce to see how it comes out. But this is a great recipe as is! FYI do not over grease baking dish.

I added 2 garlic cloves chopped,I also used half cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup cream cheese, and instead of Monterey Jack cheese, I used Queso Chihuahua quesadilla cheese...I put it in the crock pot on low for 1 hour, it came out fabulous, once the cheese on top is melted, it's done.

This was good and RICH, but could have used some garlic powder, paprika, maybe even a little pepper?  No salt though as someone else mentioned, as the mayo and cheese are plenty salty.  Served this with homemade pita chips.

"This is the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had" is what everyone said at our party today. Absolutely loved it!!  The person who said they topped it with crab before baking, what a great idea. That made it extra special!!

Great recipe! My first attempt at making my favorite appetizer. I prepared it tonight for a function tomorrow. Tasted it after prep...wonderful! I did divert from the recipe a bit by simply adding two cloves of crushed garlic and some black pepper to taste. Cannot wait to serve it to my friends tomorrow!

I made this the other night and everyone loved it.  The only thing I did differently was to put about double the artichokes in it, thanks to a very large jar from Costco.  I served it with crackers, tortilla chips, and a boule of crusty bread--something for everbody.  This was so easy and it really didn't need the sour cream or cream cheese I've seen in other recipes.  I will definitely be making this again!

This dip is SO delicious. I made it when I had family in over the holidays (6 people were enjoying it) and it was a huge hit! I doubled it, which made a lot! Doubling is not needed unless you have a lot of very hungry people.

Delicious and easy to make with just 5 ingredients. I used freshly grated Parmesan and Monterey Jack cheeses; served warm with Stacy's naked pita chips and Triscuits. Will be making this again soon and my son wants to make it for a New Years Eve party he's attending in a couple of days. If you want a warm and hearty dip that guests will enjoy, I recommend this recipe.

Very good, easy and quick although I did make a couple of alterations.  I used a bag of fresh baby spinach, sautéed in butter and garlic.  Mixed with the remaining ingredients and then added a few shakes of hot pepper sauce.  Served it in a small crockpot instead of baking in oven.  Really good with garlic parmesan Italian toasts.

I made this in a crock pot and the consistency was way too thick and burnt. And the taste was bad, not just bland but tasted bad. I won't make this again.

I agree this is an amazing dip. I followed some of the tips in the comments, such as: 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup sour cream instead of 1 full cup mayo. Added salt, pepper, powdered garlic & minced garlic. One of the times I made it, I used fresh spinach which I sauteed prior to mixing with the other ingredients. Both versions were VERY well received!!  Thank you!

This was great.  I couldn't find Monterey Jack, so I used a 4-cheese Italian blend instead.  I've recently become a believer in Hellman's mayonnaise... it seems to taste less mayo-y than other mayonnaises.  I also added a fair amount of freshly ground black pepper.

My daughter and I made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer and it was a great hit. We used pepper jack cheese to add a little kick, and upped the amount of parmesan to 1 1/2 cups. Will be making this again, and often.

I make this dip frequently.  The only thing I do differently is to add about 4 cloves of garlic.  Of course, that is a personal preference because I LOVE garlic.

Addictive and delicious. Used pepper jack shreds and cut it back to 1 cup; used marinated artichoke hearts; and added 3 cloves minced garlic. just before baking, sprinkled about 2 tablespoons of parmesean shreds on top. A big hit at my party!

I've been looking for the perfect spinach and artichoke dip for awhile, and had high hopes for this one, but felt like it needed some more flavor. I had the strangest desire to add some red pepper flakes to it.

This is incredible! I used 1/2 Miracle Whip and 1/2 sour cream instead of 1 cup mayo. I also used fresh spinach, chopped instead of the frozen. We love it!

The first few bites were good, then it got to be too much for me. It was thick and heavy. I think using canned vegetables really hurt this recipe for me.

Good as is, with a bit of a mayo-y taste and overkill with the spinach (and I love spinach).  This time, I'm doubling the recipe, cutting a quarter cup of the mayo, and I added 2 tsp of garlic (2 cloves in a double recipe).  Regardless, it's still tasty!!

This recipe tastes good, but the consistency is not great. It is not creamy, so the cheese pulls and it falls off your chip/cracker.  I think I want something a bit creamier.

Good dip thats perfect for parties, tailgating, etc. My husband LOVES it for football on Sundays. It does not have all the flavor of other spinach and artichoke dips, but for the time and effort put forth in making it you can't go wrong!

I always make the same artichoke dip, so I thought I would try something new- after reading the reviews I thought this would be great. This was extremely... blah. Easy to make, but lacking in flavor.

Great recipe. I used 1/2 low fat mayo and 1/2 light sour cream. I even added a 1/2 a pack of cream cheese. We love spinache and artichoke, so I added extra. Turned out wonderful with Tostitos Scoops!!!

People love this recipe, great hit at a party. Straight forward and tasty. I serve it with tortilla chips or Italian bread. I will make it as is again, but I will also make it with some horseradish to give it a kick.

My kids didn't like this dip as much as other recipes I have made from this site.  I did only use half the amount of artichoke stated and you have to bake for longer than 15 minutes to get it heated through the middle.  My family preferred the Hot Spinach Dip recipe from this site probably because it doesn't have the artichokes.  I will try to keep "sneaking" them in!

I am now forced to bring this dish to every major function!! People absolutely love it.  I am SO not domesticated, but this dish is so easy and delish, it gave me confidence to at least TRY to cook! This recipe is even low carb dieter approved:) I gave it four stars because I feel this recipe needs tweaking. I add ALOT more cheese (I mix asagio, parm, cheddar.. what ever cheese is in the fridge) lots of rosemary and garlic, and I use light mayo (shh.. don't tell!!) I feel it is best made in a crockpot so it stays hot. When cold, it is thick and has a weird texture. Rave reviews always!!

Instead of a whole cup of mayo, I did 1/2 c mayo, 1/2 c cream cheese (softened).  Instead of marinated artichokes, I added 3/4 c frozen spinach, cooked as directed and drained.  And one heaping tbs refridgerated minced garlic.  Then the rest of the ingredients and baked as original recipe stated.  This was an appetizer at my first Thanksgiving hosted in my new home and it was raved over!!

This is a great recipe! It's got great flavor. All my family and friends love it. It's even better the second time around. Note...if you're using cheap cheeses it's probably not going to taste so great. Sometimes you just can't skimp on quality!

Even though there are already plenty of 5 star ratings, I have to add my own. I also did 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream and this came out WONDERFULLY! Best dip I've ever made! Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, but not as creamy as I would have liked. I used a combo of half mayo/half sour cream, as others suggested. I think next time I'll also add in some cream cheese. I used a 6oz. jar of marinated artichoke hearts. I added crushed garlic to the mix also. Served this New Year's Eve, along with other appetizer foods, with whole grain and yellow corn tortilla chips.

This was a GREAT dip!!!  I used pepperjack (as someone had suggested) as well as 1/2 cup of sour cream in place of 1/2 of the mayo.  Also, I only used 8 oz of cheese (b/c that's the way's it was packaged) and only half of the parm. cheese.  I can't wait for another opportunity to make this dip again!

This dip was YUMMMMMMYYY!  My boyfriend and I ate it for dinner! haha  I did have to make a few adjustments though...I added 3 cloves of minced garlic, baked for 30 min. instead of 15 min. and after the dip was done I added chopped cherry tomatoes on the top.  I served this with small toasted bread and it was delicious!!

This recipe is way too thick and cheesy like some have said, I wish I had used a lot less of the jack cheese, eliminated the parmesan altogether, maybe add a little heavy cream or half and half to thin it out. I blotted the spinach with paper towels like someone else recommended to get all the water out, maybe NOT doing that would've made it thinner and better.  I doubled this recipe and threw it all in the trash, and it wasn't cheap! Nothing at all like I've had in restaraunts, the frozen kind at the grocery store is way better!  Nobody liked it, but I think it could be ok with a LOT of changes. Also I added minced garlic for flavor which is definitely necessary.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to prepare. What a new experience- eating great artichoke spinach dip without paying a fortune for it in a restaurant. Recipe calls for a bit more jack cheese than I prefer, will cut down to about 2 cups next time.

Delicious! Everyone loved it. Perfect combination of cheeses, spinach, and artichoke. I used a little more monterey jack in mine, because we like it extra cheesy.

This was a bit of a disappointment.  After reading all the other reviews I thought I would really taste like the dip I have enjoyed in many restaurants.  Unfortunately this dip is only decent at best.  I would never serve this to company at my home.  My family did eat it- but only found it to be so-so and quite bland.  I did follow the recipe exactly.  I'm sorry but I will not be making this again.  SORRY!

Oh gosh this was GOOD!  I used marinated artichoke hearts and it was still awesome.  If you are from Canada, it is a lot like the "Chicago Dip" from Moxies.  Yum!  A keeper for sure!

Very good dip.  I couldn't find just monterey jack, so I used a combo of jack and colbey.  Still turned out good.

It was very good...next time I'll add a little garlic.  It just seemed like it was missing a little something.

I didn't particularly like this and I couldn't figure out why.  However, everyone else raved about it.  It took longer than 15 mins to cook but I then kept it hot in my fondue pot, which worked well.

This is a very popular dish at parties.  Very easy to whip up in 15 minutes, but make sure you serve immediately.

This was fabulous.  Made pita chips to dip in it.  My daughter preferred just the chips though.
