Very good, I omitted the hot sauce, as well as the cornstarch,water and butter. I cooked it very slowly and it became thick and sticky the house smelled sooooo.... good. At supper time all that could be heard was mmmmmm, lips smacking and fingers being licked (not that I approve of finger licking) but who would want to miss a drop. Now this if finger licking good!!! I had guests for supper and everyone wanted the recipe and my daughter who is a Bulls eyes lover said that this is much better I agree.

BRAVO!!!  BRAVO!!!  You ought to consider changing the name of this sauce to "The Best Dang Barbeque Sauce Ever".

We did cut the garlic in half and omitted the butter as a reviewer suggested.  We also added a tsp of onion powder and half a tsp of celery seed. Don't be afraid of the Cajun Spice.. you could add more if you want spiceier...but it was just enough for all to enjoy.

I will definitely keep this resicpe and pass it along.  I have been searching for a good barbexue sauce and this is DEFINITELY it!!!

I made the sauce though I left out the Cajun seasoning, because I have small children and it would have made it to hot for them, but it still tasted wonderful you could smell it through the whole house. Also following others advice I didn't completely omit the butter, I cut it down to a 1/4 cup and made it a thicker sauce like my husband likes....but it is plenty thick without it.  Will be making again.

The taste of this sauce is very good, but after adding the butter, it turned way too thick and did not want to stick to the chicken on the grill.  Great taste, but omit the butter you don't need it.

My wife and I really like this BBQ sauce recipe.  It's refreshing to find a recipe that isn't vinegar based, without being too sweet.  The one change that I make is to follow another's advice, and leave out the thickening agents (butter and corn starch).  By simply simmering the sauce for an extra hour or so, you get the same thickness, and save on extras that you don't need.

I absolutely LOVED this barbecue sauce!  I made a few slight changes:  I only used 2 tsp. of garlic; I didn't have any molasses, so I used light corn syrup instead; omitted the Cajun seasoning; used Tabasco Chipotle sauce instead of the hot sauce.  Yum!

This is the first time I ever made home made BBQ sauce. I found it easy to make and the finished product was SOOOOOO good. I did take the advice of another review and omitted the cajun spice. I also left out the butter and found the thickness to be just fine without it. I don't think we will ever purchase store bought BBQ again. This recipe is a keeper!

I like to have a lot of varieties of bbq sauce to make as needed. This one is very good, but I didn't need the cornstarch to thicken or the butter. Will file away to make every now and then along with our other favorite sauces.

This is a amazing BBQ sauce. I will for sure make my sauce to have on hand at all times. I put it over bone in chicken thighs in the crackpot and they turned out so good. I took them off the bone and we had them on soft rolls. I had to sub a couple things for the sauce I didn't have like soy sauce, I used extra worchesterchire and chopped garlic in the jar instead of fresh. The best ever!

Wow, this was good! I followed others advice and omitted the cornstarch, and only added 2 tbsp butter. Also, added extra brown sugar because I didn't have any molases on hand. This was wonderful. I put it on pork chops, and can't wait to try it on ribs and chicken. My new favorite. Thank you!

The Husband and I are complete garlic freaks, but we didn't like the tongue-burning, eye-watering taste of this. I simmered it for nearly an hour, and it didn't mellow at all. How large exactly is '1 bulb garlic, peeled and crushed'?? I will never ever make this again. Sorry.

This is a really good sauce, but as written it would have been too spicy for us - I reduced the hot sauce by half, and only used 1 tsp Cajun seasoning (homemade blend that was pretty spicy to begin with!), and I added about 1 tsp. liquid smoke totally by mistake (was making two recipes at once and got mixed up), but it worked so well in this! Used this for chicken, but I can't wait to try on ribs.

I've made this sauce several times and it always turns out great!  It was especially good on grilled ribs.  I prefer to use 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  My whole family loves it.  We love the spicy kick to it!

I've made this recipe twice and it just keeps getting better.  It says to use it as a sauce but I've used it on slow roasted BBQ ribs as a marinade/glaze while the ribs are roasting in the oven and it comes out even better! I left out the Cajun seasoning, red & black pepper and the hot sauce as I have a low tolerance for spicy things and this was still fantastic! People have commented that it's better than store bought and I've been asked for the recipe on both occasions.  This is now my go to recipe for BBQ sauce.

My family loved this BBQ sauce!  It is better then any store bought sauce and very thick.  I did not have Cajun seasoning, but it still turned out great.  Don't be apprehensive to do this due to the large of amount of ingredients.  It is fairly easy to do, even with 5 hungry kids in the house.  :)

This recipe was great, and so much better than store bought bbq sauce.  The only things I changed were to omit the butter and add a bit more honey, but that is personal preference.  I used it in the slow cooker with ribs and they turned out perfect!

We did tweek the recipe just slightly, but we cooked baby back ribs w/ the sauce and they were the best ribs we have ever eaten. The BBQ sauce is good, but it gets even better when it is used on the grill!

I must confess that I LOVE KC MAsterpiece Honey BBQ sauce and I was out of it and trying to make my own version.  My hubby and I agreed that this was a good bbq sauce, but NOT what we were looking for.

I made this acccording to the directions and it came out awsome! I had never used cajun seasoning before - love it. There was enough sauce for two big chickens I brined plus a bit more for the table. The sauce does have a nice little kick to it...so some people may want to go light on the hot sauce and pepper.

I agree with omitting the butter and cornstarch at the end - mine thickened all by itself likely due to the sugar and honey - it was mmmmmm good!

FANTASTIC! I used Nantucket OffShore Pueblo Rub instead of the Cajun seasoning.  It was a little spicier than I'd like, but the Pueblo rub has more of a kick than Cajun seasoning, so next time I'll just leave out the crushed red pepper.  I didn't find it to garlicky like some other reviewers - thought it was a nice mellow garlic flavor.

Very good bbq sauce.  However, next time I make it, I won't use as much ketchup.

This was the best BBQ sauce I have ever tasted.  It's worth the time to make and you can refrigerate the extra to use for the next time.  I've never had so many compliments on my ribs before.

I used this sauce in barbecue chicken nachos with homemade tortilla chips. Since I prefer mild foods, I toned down the gentle heat by adding a little less Cajun seasoning and chili powder. It was a huge hit and I would definitely make this again!

This is the best BBQ sauce I have ever had. I used smokey paprika, med chili powder(for white), and a cup of coke for the water. It was wonderful.  I cut back the hot sauce to about 1 tbsp and I stayed away from the cornstarch, butter and water because it didn't need it. I will use this as a base and go from there.  It made the best BBQ chicken. I can't wait to use it on ribs.  Thanks again for this recipe.

Perfect for my pulled chicken sandwiches, and just the right bite!  AND because I was only cooking for myself and my husband, I have enough left for a second use!  I did sweat the garlic in some olive oil first, and my pinches were maybe a bit large-ish, and I only used half the amount of butter listed.  DELICIOUS!!!

I skip the whole simmering part which turns it into a fast, simple, and very flavorful sauce! I've tried it on chicken as well as ribs, and both came out fantastic. I only cook for my hubby and I, so I cut the recipe in half and that is plenty for us. I also took the liberty of adding 2 tbsp of Jack Daniel's whiskey for an extra bite :) Thanks for sharing with us!

i thought this was great also, much better than store bought.  i used 1/2 the amount of garlic, none of the peppers or hot sauce and only 3/4 t. cajun as my family does not like spicy food.  tasted it and was needing just a trickle of liquid smoke...delicious!  also will be my go to BBQ sauce now.

Really delicious in chicken barbeque sandwiches.  Made 1/4 of this recipe with only a few substitutions out of necessity:  all brown sugar in place of the molasses, BBQ spice in place of the Cajun seasoning, and omitted the butter.

WOW this was goooood! I needed a bbq sauce for ribs for people with food sensitivities and this was amazing! I made it pretty much exactly as written but substituted the brown sugar with brown sugar substitute Splenda (one person was diabetic and I figured the honey and molasses were enough), and used margarine instead of butter (another has milk product sensitivities). What a great flavour! One person actually poured more of the sauce on his plate so he could keep dipping the ribs over and over! I'm not a rib or a bbq lover at all, but I polished off 4. I actually didn't need the second tbsp of cornstarch since mine got thick enough with the cooking... it was also easy to add more hot sauce (we like the spice) but would be easy enough to use less for people who don't like it. I thought the entire bulb of garlic was perfect! The margarine at the end wasn't entirely necessary as I liked the taste before, but I'm glad I added it anyway. Thanks for the recipe!

Double the honey,triple the molasses,tonz more garlic,3 TB. liquid smoke,2 1/2 TB. dry mustard,1TB. onion powder,triple brown sugar,1TB. paprika,3/8 C. red wine vinegar,extra pepper to taste. I did not add the hot stuf cuz we are not in training to be fire eaters. Well it taste pretty good now and I am puting it in the slow cooker with pork chops. Don't think we will be making this again.

super good, lots of zing with this recipe & i didn't have the cajun seasoning, paprika or crushed red pepper.  also, didn't find a need for the cornstarch or butter.  otherwise, great!

I modified this recipe to the following form and was very happy with the result.  -2 cups ketchup -3 bulbs garlic -1 cup water -2 Tbsp Mezzetta California hot sauce -1/4 cup raw dark blue agave nectar -2 Tbsp blackstrap molasses -2 Tbsp brown sugar -1 tsp Worcestershire sauce -1 tsp soy sauce -1 tsp salt -1/2 tsp each of the following (this makes a working cajun seasoning): 	-oregano 	-cayenne 	-garlic powder 	-paprika 	-onion powder 	-black pepper  You throw all ingredients in at once and simmer at med low heat for about an hour. The result is suitably thick as is mentioned elsewhere. -butter and cornstarch unnecessary as mentioned elsewhere. -agave nectar is a great sugar substitute. It's sweeter than sugar, but with a lower glycemic index. -I always up the garlic content from what a recipe says. -Don't need to buy Cajun seasoning if you already have a decently stocked spice cabinet. -The specific hot sauce I used is my personal favorite. Lots of flavor depth with just the right kick. It's available in the Portland, OR area @ QFC or New Seasons

Cooking this sauce, I wasn't impressed at all w/the smell or the taste. I ended up adding another tbl of brown sugar because it was sooooo spicy but there wasn't any hint of sweet. I definately wanted a honey flavor(hence searching out the honey in the title of the recipe) but you couldn't taste it even remotely, Unfortunately, the 1/4c used was all I had so I couldn't play w/that amt. I ended up adding 1/4c of grape jelly to sweeten it up a bit. Anyway, followed the rest to perfection, adding the butter(wow-did make a difference in the taste too!) & the cornstarch mix. Poured it over blsl chicken breasts & baked approx. 25 min @ 375, uncovered. They were AMAZING! The flavor was outstanding! Definately not a bbq sauce I would've ever used had it not had honey & I'm sooo glad I tried it! It was way too spicy for the little kids but my older 2, tweens, loved it as much as hubby & I did!

Oh, this is great!!!  We had it last night for dinner on chicken that we grilled.  We have some left over chicken from last night and tonight my husband wants to make BBQ chicken pizza's using the left over chicken.  He wants me to make more sauce for the pizza's too.  This is a huge compliment to the creator Christian Strub.  I am going to laminate this recipe so I never get water stains on it.   Thanks again Mr. Strub.

This sauce was delicious!  After reading the rest of the reviews, I too cut back on the garlic.  I only used 3 cloves, and that was the perfect amount.  I halved the hot sauce and creole seasoning (I'm sensitive to too much spice), and left out the butter completely.  It was absolutely delicious, although the consistency was a little difficult to work with, especially after it had been put in the refrigerator.  I might leave out the corn starch step as well.  Before I added the cornstarch, the consistency was just about right.  Over all, an amazing BBQ sauce!!

I halved the recipe.  It turned out really good.  I recommend cutting the hot sauce and Cajun spice in half if you are feeding kids with it.  Overall pretty darn good!

My husband loved this BBQ sauce.  I added a little bit more 'heat' and let it simmer longer to bring out the sweetness to the sauce.  It tastes great on grilled chicken and steak.  Cook and then add to the BBQ when cooking and the sauce caramelized to wonderful sticky sauce.

This is a great recipe for bbq.  It has an undeniable flavorful taste.  Sophisticated enough for adults with refined palattes and plenty tasty for kids who just want it to "taste good".  I haven't looked for any more bbq sauce recipes on this site since finding this one!

This recipe had too much of a tomato taste for me, I used it on chicken and was very disappointed.  I used some additional ingredients in the sauce I had left such as liquid smoke, but nothing cut down the tomato taste.

The base of the sauce has way too much ketchup. I can see using a little bit, but not as much as what it asked for. I more than doubled the amount of honey to try to make it taste better, it didn't help at all.
Not really impressed. I've wasted my ingredients.

I love cooking stuff from scratch and me and my husband wanted to try something different than just doing buffalo sauce for chicken wings. Gave this recipe a try and we couldn't get enough of it. Got such great flavor to it. If u haven't tried it, I suggest u make it.

I am always searching for a barbecue sauce I like better and this is it! I've made it several times. I omit the water.

I got the honey part and the garlic part, but they just didn't come together in the ketchup base in a way that seems balanced to us.

I made this as written, and it was a little too spicy for us. I made it again, and dropped the garlic cloves to 6 instead of the whole bulb, and omitted the red pepper and the hot sauce and dropped the Cajun seasoning to 1 tsp and it had the perfect amount of spice for us. It's a fantastically forgiving recipe and you can add more honey if you like or drop the garlic and it still comes out with an amazing flavor. It's the only sauce my husband wants now.

I actually make big batches of this and can it.  It is our family's favorite!  Also we like to add a little bit of liquid smoke to it while simmering it all day long.  Yummy!  Thanks!

I reduced the garlic and butter by half, left out the soy sauce, b/c of allergies, and used worcestershire sauce instead. I added a dollop of spicy brown mustard and 2 Tablespoons of liquid smoke. I let it simmer for an hour. Not too thick but certainly not thin. I was out of hot sauce so I used cayenne instead.  I think that I'd like it with the hot sauce even better. I didn't give it a 5 b/c the amount of garlic would have been too much as written.

This recipe is amazing!! My whole family loved it.  I used it on Chicken and Ribs.  I didn't add the butter or the hot sauce and added a little more honey and brown sugar. It is the best BBQ sauce I have ever tasted and I will never buy BBQ sauce again!!

To cut calories, I omitted the butter. I also used less water so I didn't need any cornstarch to thicken. I tweaked it with a little onion powder, but something just wasn't quite right. Then I added some liquid smoke and it was perfect! I most certainly will be making this again!

Very easy to make and the taste is great.  I don't think I got the correct "Cajun" seasoning and in the future I definitely won't add as much of what I purchased.  I ended up making BBQ Pulled Chicken with this in the crock pot and it came out great.  I'll make again.

Good Sauce, but not the best. Needs work for sure. Cooked it up by the recipe, but it just wasn't right. Added a bit more brown sugar (didn't really measure at this point, just added a bit more until it tasted better). And also a pinch or two of Rosemary. It still needs some tweaking, but it's a very very good start.

This BBQ sauce has way too much garlic.  It over powered the entire sauce.  I wonder if there is a typo.  I would use one clove of garlic not one bulb!

This recipe is awesome.  There is no way I could go back to bottled sauce after this!  It's the perfect amount of sweet, spicy and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, even though I usually adjust to suit our tastes, and I am glad I did!  I used it on BBQ pork for sandwiches from this site and every last drop was gone.  Great!

We were not at all impressed with this BBQ sauce. It sounded like it should be flavorful--it wasn't. I followed the recipe, but still, it didn't have kick or much of anything to make me want to make it again. The cornstarch also gave it a funky texture. I will not make this again.

This one is just OK. I didn't have vinegar on hand so I was looking for a sauce recipe in a pinch. Nothing to write home about, but it served my purpose. I did cut down on the pepper and hot sauce...it just seemed like it would be too much for my 4 year old to handle.

We used this with the "Simple Country Ribs" recipe from this site.  It was GREAT because I didn't feel like I was "wasting" as much because I didn't have to open 2 containers of BBQ sauce -- I just made my own!  And holy smokes it is great!  I didn't use quite as much pepper sauce as it calls for -- I used probably 1/3 and it was still pretty spicy!
It's a ton of fun to be able to make my own!

I was in a pinch when my husband and I decided to throw a BBQ at the last minute and I of course rushed to allrecipes.com to find a good BBQ recipe. I am so glad that I did! As the recipe simmered in the house, everyone kept asking what smelled so good! I made a few changes to the recipe though. I only added 1 tbsp of hot sauce since my husband doesn't like things to be too spicy and I omitted the Cajun seasoning simply because I didn't have it on hand. But it turned out great and when our beef ribs came of the grill they were coated in this sweet, sticky goodness. I got compliments all night. This is a great recipe to try. You will not be disappointed!

This was fantastic. Followed the recipe to a T..as I hate people who change the them and still review the original. I LOVED this. My husband grilled some pork loin and we basted it with this and then warmed some to serve over the sliced loin. Was insane! Made a huge batch, split it up and froze. Will be great all summer long.

If you're looking for sweet and tangy...this is it! I followed the recipe to a T and it was pretty good. I also liked that the sauce really stuck to the meat. However, there wasn't a lot of depth here...I'm not sure that I would make it again. Thanks!

This was excellent, sweet and spicy - a little too spicy for my liking but everyone else loved it. I used homemade hot sauce (jalepeno hot sauce recipe from this site) and I used my own homemade ketchup. Will definitely make again but next time I might cut the hot sauce in half, or use not so hot hot sauce.

Excellent base for delicious barbecue sauce. We adjusted it to our taste, adding onion powder, celery salt, and dijon mustard, leaving out the butter entirely, and using garlic powder for *half* the amount of crushed garlic. Perfect! My boyfriend, the BBQ lover, likes it better than the bottled stuff. :)
