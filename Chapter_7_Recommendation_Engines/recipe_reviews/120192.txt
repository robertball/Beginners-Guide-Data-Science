These carrots are the best!  I used steam in bag microwave carrots to save on time, the white wine vinegar and added some cracked black pepper.  I also used fresh chives - these were a great accompaniment to breaded pork chops.

Good - my family prefers raw carrots, but they cleaned this up, and it's really easy.

This was ok but a little too sweet and carrots are naturally sweet already so it would have been nice to mellow it out a bit.

I'm glad to be the first to review this. It was great, made exactly as stated. DH and 2 YO DD LOVED IT! Thanks for getting an orange veggie in our diet.

These are delicious! I used a 12 oz. bag of baby carrots and doubled the rest of the ingredients.

This was very simple, but a good way to dress up carrots.

This recipe is very good. I didn't use the chives, only because I didn't have any. We had these for dinner Friday night and are making them again tonight.

Delicious!  I generally don't like carrots, but I do prepared this way.  I used sliced carrots instead of baby carrots since that was what I had in the kitchen.

It was a nice way to cook carrots.  I will cook again. But hey they are just carrots :)
