We really enjoyed this pasta salad. The cocktail sauce was a nice tasty difference from the traditional oil and vinegar or mayo type dressings. The only change I made was using the whole bell peppers since we like lots of veggies. My shrimp wasn't precooked so I sauteed it in some butter, parsley with a little Old Bay and ground pepper for seasoning.

This is the first review I have ever written despite being on here for years.. just had to give a shout-out to this recipe because there was only 1 review and it really was great! Followed it exactly except I used penne b/c that's what I had on hand and no V-8 so used vegetable broth with a little tomato sauce mixed in. Next time I will double the shrimp and avocado since that was everyone's favorite part. Tastes better the next day!

Instead of the pasta, I topped a spring salad with all of the salad ingredients. Also added some radishes and cucumber.  The dressing was great (no changes) and could go on nearly any green salad.  I would also use the dressing to marinade cooked shrimp for an hour or so instead of using cocktail sauce. I also think the dressing would also be perfect on a taco salad.  Will definitely make again.

I love this! It is so refreshing and light. It's perfect if you love shrimp cocktail. I've also made a lower carb version and omitted the pasta and added more shrimp and avocado. Delicious!!!

My intention was to use things in the fridge...I used leftover shrimp from Chef John's Indoor BBQ Shrimp, whole wheat pasta spirals( very few as we are not big pasta eaters), didn't have orange, green or yellow pepper but  was making 1/2 batch anyway so utilized  the red,  had original V8, no horseradish sadly, lemon for lime juice. Added a bit of celery, shredded carrot and cucumber because I had them. Love color in food.  No major changes and the bowl was devoured.  Was very yummy. Thank you Sue K

No changes made; skipped the cilantro &  increased the peppers.
Husband loves Shrimp Cocktail ;  this salad was a big hit especially with horseradish. 
      One more thing, after having had this recipe several times, added celery.  Celery, chopped or blended is an unsung herb.  Itâ€™s like shrimp cocktail to a Bloody Mary!

I love shrimp cocktail and I love this salad.  I did make a number of changes (please don't boo and hiss.) because I was cooking for 1 person and you can't just have this many fresh ingredients on hand.  I'm sure I would love the salad as written, but I just can't have 4 kinds of peppers on hand and I can never manage to use up more than a fraction of the bunch of cilantro.  So here's what I did.  Only one change to the dressing - used mayo instead of olive oil.  For the salad ingredients I used orzo pasta, scallions, red pepper, iceberg lettuce, shrimp and fresh sugar snaps.  Cooked pasta for 6 minutes, threw in the raw shrimp, cooked 2 more minutes, threw in the sugar snaps, cooked 1 more minute.  Cut up everything fairly small and tossed with the dressing.  I believe the flavor profile of my version was the same as the submitter's (except for missing the cilantro).  the small size of the pasta and the small chop on the veggies made a lot of  surface area for the yummy dressing.  Many thanks for a great recipe.

I added a sprinkle of salt and pepper to the salad itself after it was done, and a splash more hot sauce, just to enhance the flavor. It turned out delicious, even better the next day! I'll definitely make this again.

I'm considering making up a batch of the dressing to bottle and use on a regular lettuce salad. If I do I'll let you know how it is.

Delicious cool salad!  I substituted chopped celery for the bell peppers as they give me indigestion & used cocktail sauce since I didn't have the ingredients necessary to make the dressing but it was really good.  Will try the original recipe next time around!  Thanks!

This came out great! Perfect for a hot summer evening. I messed up and threw the minced jalapenos into the salad instead of blending it with the other stuff in the food processor to make the sauce. It didn't make that much of a difference except I felt the sauce needed more horseradish, so I added another tablespoon. That may have been because I forgot to add the jalapenos to the sauce blend. Otherwise, this was super easy and the blend of flavors is perfect!
