This is so simple yet flavorful. Chourico is the same as hard chorizo which is what I used. I subbed chicken stock for the vegetable and baby kale instead of spinach. I will use sweet onion the next time I make this because I didn't care for the look of the red onion but that has no bearing on the taste. Thanks Ashley! This is a winner.

I loved this! I doubled the recipe and added extra sausage.   I could not find dried Chorico  sausage so I used Andouille.  Yum!

This was really great and hearty! This had a lovely balance of sweet and spicy. It seems very healthy too! I did make some changes though. I used chicken chorizo black beans instead of garbanzo and zuccini instead of spinach.

Very good I did not have Chorico so I used a red pepper and spinach chicken sausage and it was great.

We really liked this soup! I did use Soyrizo and "No Chicken Chicken Broth" the only changes I made were adding three cloves minced garlic and about 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves. Yummy!! Thank you

This was a very flavorful soup. I enjoyed the ingredients and the taste a texture of it completely. Not a soup person but the ingredients were things I like. It was just smokey and spicy enough for my taste. It was extremely easy to make.
