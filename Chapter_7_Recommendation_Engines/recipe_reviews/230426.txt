A huge hit! They came out perfect. The video is essential on how to make them. You do need to turn the rind inside out to remove all of the pulp and skin. Once you get the hang of this it is relatively easy. Lime rinds are pretty tough. I used 13 limes and all but 1 came out perfect. A 3oz. box of jello filled 10 halved limes (so 40 wedges). I put cupcake liners in a muffin tin and placed a lime half in each well. You can lean them against the edge to keep them level. I made them the night before and let them set up all night. To cut the halves into wedges you need to turn the lime face down so you cut through the rind first and don't destroy the jello. I used Pucker (watermelon flavored vodka). For me they were a little strong. I made these for a club party and everyone loved them. I had people following me around to try to steal seconds and thirds. They are time consuming but were the hit of the party. Without liquor they would be a great party treat for kids. I am pretty sure people will be begging me to make them again and again!!!

I used 1/2 cup watermelon schnapps and 1/2 cup vodka. The shots turned out great!

I would like to give this recipe 5 stars for creativity and cuteness - they turned out just too darn cute! BUT, let's face it, I'm not in my twenties anymore, and these were WAY too boozy for me. You could barely taste the watermelon jello in the ones with the vodka. Fortunately, I made 1/2 of them with the vodka, and half without (for the kids). I would like to try them with watermelon schnapps like another reviewer suggested. I bet that would be good.

I agree with Shelley.  these were hard to make.  wear gloves.  the video gives a lovely unrealistic view of peeling the membrane away.  Not so easy and yes do not rip the bottom of your lime cup.  I had way more jello left over to do more than 5 limes.  Oh maybe that counts for the spillage.  Also I used my hard boiled egg holder to set the limes in.  They are beautiful though.

these were a hit but very hard to make. i lost at least half of my jello from leakage. Fun thing if you can figure out how not to tear lime.

It does take some patience - but well worth it!  I made these for a July 4th party (HUGE hit!) and plan on it for my Labor Day party. Instead of sesame seeds, I used Black Hawaiian Lava Salt I had that worked great. It helped bring together all the sweet and bitter, too!

These were super cute but very time consuming. It would have been worth the time if they tasted good but the jello absorbed the flavor of the lime rind, which tasted awful and bitter; hence the 2 star rating.

This is brilliant!  Can't wait to make them for adult cookouts this summer.
