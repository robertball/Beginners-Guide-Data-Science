This was so delicious.  I made it for a potluck dinner and it was the only pan that was totally empty before the night was over.  It has been requested for Easter.  Go figure.

This is a great side dish especially along side of some honey spiraled ham for Christmas and Easter. My mom and I prefer substituting the crackers with crushed wavey potato chips. Might sound tacky but this makes a very tasty and crunchy topping which turns a nice golden brown when done.

This was really a great recipe.  I thought it could have used a little bit of milk to make it a little creamier and I added green onions.  Very yummy!

Perfect for entertaining....make in the oven and transfer to a crockpot to keep warm...no need for cracker topping but do suggest adding a bit of onion for more flavor prior to cooking.

This is easy and delicious. I usually don't substitute the first time I try the recipe, but I didn't have any Ritz crackers. I did, however, have a can of French's french fried onions left over from Thanksgiving.. Oh my heck! This was fantastic... I don't know how it would be with the Ritz but I imagine it would still be outstanding.

This is my grandma's recipe...and my aunt's recipe.  Everyone claimed this recipe as their own.  We always saute an onion in a stick of butter and mix it with the potato mixture and crumble potato chips on the top instead of Ritz.  A holiday favorite!

excellent!!! I used fresh potatoes sliced instead of shredded...It was delicious but it had to cook forever. I had to add some water to help the potatoes cook quicker.

I have been making this for years and years and the only difference is I add chopped green onions and use corn flakes for the topping instead of ritz crackers.....it is always the first thing eaten up no matter when I fix it or where I take it....yummmmmm

I followed the recipe exactly but added a little more cheese. Me and my husband thought it was really bland. I probably won't make this again.

My mom has always made a version of this recipe, and I though I would try to make. I'm vegetarian so I used mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and instead of putting crackers on top, I put on a nice thick layer of cheese. I baked it for 50 minutes and then set the oven to broil and let the cheese get all nice and brown. Sooooo good! I also added salt and pepper to the potato mixture before baking.

I meant to add bacon and onions, and kind of combine it with the Paula Deen recipe but I forgot. I was running out of time by the time I got around to these but they are good as written also.

I use about 10 potatoes (chopped), instead of the frozen hash browns.  Gives it a much better texture and I also use the mild cheddar so it doesn't cover up the flavor of the cream of chicken soup. I shake out a few chopped onions (dehydrated) and forget the butter because I spray the pan with buttered flavored cooking spray.  That with the cheese gives it enough oil so it doesn't dry out.  Yum Yum!

I've been making this for years.  For more flavor though I use O'brien potatoes in the freezer section of the grocery store.  They already have peppers and onions in them.  For a vegetarian version use cream of mushroom soup.  This is a family favorite and a popular potluck dish.

this is much better using the o'brien potatoes which have the onions & peppers in with it. Gives it more flavor. Also I always use 2 cans of soup & a whole 8 oz container of sour cream which makes it less dry. One last thing I do is use corn flake crumbs sauted in margarine instead of the ritz crackers. Wonderful!

Absolutely delicious.  I did make a couple modifications.  I always shred my own cheese instead of buying it already grated...it's just so much creamier.  Also, during the last 20 minutes of baking, add shredded pepper jack cheese  and Durkee French Fried onions (instead of the crackers) all over the top and bake until the onions are golden brown.  A delicious change to the traditional hash brown casserole.

This was really easy to prepare.  Make sure to buy the sharp cheddar cheese or it will be too bland.  Next time I will add some onion or onion powder and/or garlic powder to spice it up a bit.  Overall it was good, just needed a little more of something to make it really good.

We have these every year around the holidays. I have always used corn flakes, Crispix, or French's fried onions (my favorite) on top instead of Ritz crackers. The onions tend to stay crunchy while the others do not after sitting for a while.

It is edible, but extremely bland. There is no tang to it even with the sharp cheddar. I was very disappointed.

Simple and delicious! I used 98% fat free soup and light sour cream to cut down on the fat, and added some seasoned salt, onion powder, and ground pepper to beef up the flavor and it was so yummy. It was a hit at our Easter barbecue with kids and adults!

This is one of our favorite side dishes!  We love it with twice the Ritz cracker topping. :)
