I don't think it's right that the recipe be rated lower when some reviewers didn't actually follow the recipe...this is an alcoholic drink, if you don't drink then find another recipe but don't rate it lower just b/c of changes you made. I didn't make any changes to the recipe - I thought it was pretty good!

We had Dirty Bananas on our recent trip to the Caribbean.  I don't know exactly how they made it but I think they used fresh bananas, Kahlua, Bailey's and rum (of course!)

I decided to make a virgin version of this for both myself and my kids. It sounded just absolutely delicious. 

Instead of the coffee flavored liqueur, I instead added a teaspoon of instant decafe coffee. Also, instead of the banana liqueur, I added a whole banana and a tablespoon of brown sugar. The rest of the recipe I kept the same. While I found the chocolate and coffee slightly overbearing, my children loved it. I will most likely make this again.

This recipe was ok, but needed help to be great- add a touch more coffee liqueur, a touch less banana liqueur and 4 ice cubes blended per serving. Perfection!!!!
