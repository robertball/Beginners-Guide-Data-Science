Really good and simple to make! Tossed them in olive oil, minced garlic and chives after they were done roasting. Tasty!

I used sweet potatoes and added 3/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and found them quite flavorful.  I would add even more sesame seeds next time...made them really special.

These were good. Added an envelope of dry onion soup mix, omitted sesame seeds. Cut these a bit smaller than wedges. Went well with our barbecue ribs. Thanks.

These were delish! Hubby especially loved them. I used olive oil and a lot more sesame seeds, then I turned the oven to broil for the last few minutes to brown the seeds. Great comfort food and so easy--a definite keeper!

This recipe is excellent...do it just as it says...but put your own kind of spices on.  I made them and when the steak was cooking, put them in a glass dish and added more s & p...warmed them up again and they were really tasty...nice & fluffy on the inside, just a slight crisp on the outside.  DELISH!

My husband loved these -- but I did make some changes.  I used olive oil instead of canola and I didn't have any sesame seeds, so I used a dash of lemon juice instead.

These were just OK.  I also used olive oil, as suggested by others.  I added all of the other spices the recipe called for.  I even used more than the recipe said, and they were still bland.  It seems that all those spices should have made for more flavor.  I may try again with even more spices, but it's not a high priority.  Other potatoe recipes are better.  Try Amanda's Potatoes on this website.  They are awesome!!

Yumo. I sliced mine super thin so I only had to bake for 35 min. Reminded me of spicy potato chips. My 12 year old daughter really liked them. Thanks for the post.

I added some garlic and onion powder to these and they were fantastic! I also used a little more salt than called for and cut the potatoas into smaller pieces.

This is fantastic!! I do use olive oil and instead of chili powder, I used cayenne pepper.  The sesame seeds are essential, they make the recipe!! I've also used Sweet Potatoes too (Only 2 because they are much bigger) and very good!

I thought these were ok, but I didn't really see a point to the sesame seeds. I thought they might get toasted while on the potatoes in the oven, but they didn't. I would try these again, toasting the sesame seeds beforehand. Also, as a personal preference, I added a 1/2 tsp. lemon pepper.

My husband made this recipe as written and it turned out very well.  We had it with Ranch Burgers (from this website) and a green salad.  I'd have these potatoes again!

I made these potatoes for supper with BBQ'd pork sandwiches. I experimented with the seasonings, using pepper flakes, dill weed, sesame seed and sea salt. They were excellent!

In my opinion plain canola or olive oil alone is not a great choice. If you want potatoes to come out right, my choice would be 1 teaspoon of olive oil and one tablespoon of butter, This raises the burning temp for the butter, and gives you a crispier potato, and if you like sesame seeds, I would add more, by at least a teaspoon, they add such a great flavor.

This was okay as-is, and good with doctoring.  I had to add a ton more seasonings and even then, it was good but nothing special.  I liked the idea of the sesame seeds, but I think I'm going to keep searching for a potato wedges recipe.

These were really yummy.  I'll shorten the length of baking time in the future as they got pretty crispy on the outside.

This was good and really easy. Chopped 5 potatoes into little cubes (like breakfast potatoes) so it cooked way faster and was crispier. Put them into a gallon ziplock.  Add twice the spices.  These will stick to foil.  First, try spraying foil or maybe even spray nonstick foil and see if that does it. Otherwise, just spray a cookie sheet and put them directly onto the cookie sheet. It's more hassle having them stick to the foil and rip the foil than having to clean the cookie sheet.

My husband was shocked to find out these were baked and not fried.  He said they were some of the best potatoes ever.
