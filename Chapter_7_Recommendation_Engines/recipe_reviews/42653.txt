This was something different and good! Not as sweet as I thought it might be (which is a good thing).  My son wouldn't touch it because of the peaches.

I thought twice about this because of the peaches but I am glad I went ahead anyway.  I added a few more veggies as I was doing one of those clean the refrigerator things and blanched them for a few minutes but they still stayed firm.  I added mushrooms, snow peas and zucchini.  My husband asked if we were having company and then proceeded to polish the whole thing off.  Great recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe and I will make it again when I am tired of the same old stir-fry.  For lack of pork available, I used chicken and added a few other veggies like frozen snow peas, mushrooms and a 1/2 red bell pepper. It is sweet but not too sweet.  My hubby like the mixture but pushed the peaches to the side of his plate (he does like warmed peaches). Other than that, good...esspecially for stirfry fanatics like ourselves.

We really liked this. My brain is still not quite grasping the broccoli with the peaches, so maybe there is another vegetable that would go more smoothly (asparagus?), but the flavor of this was great - and it wasn't as jarring as you might suspect. I used frozen peaches and half a bottle of peach nectar because I prefer the frozen to canned - I also think the peach nectar might have given this a more peachy flavor than the syrup from canned peaches would have. I used a bag of stir-fry vegetables with broccoli, carrots, and snow peas, which made this recipe even easier. My only suggestion would be to add the flour in the frying process rather than waiting until the end so you don't get a raw flour taste to the sauce. I also added red pepper flakes for some heat. Nice! Thanks for the recipe!

Personally I don't like broccoli, and I didn't have lemon juice when I made it, so I substituted some things.  I went with orange and yellow peppers, along with spring onions instead of any other.  I also used orange juice instead of lemon juice.  I actually thought this was tastier than steak!  Normally I would not say this.  Thanks for the recipe!

I guess what I made is barely this recipe but I used the same merinade anad everything.  Okay I did this same recipe but with Chicken and Mushrooms instead of pork.  Also I used zuccini, carrots, and baby corn instead of the broccoli.

I basically used this recipe as inspiration to use up some pork chops and some frozen peach pieces, so I wound up altering it quite a bit. I used fresh ginger and garlic in the marinade, added some chili paste for spice, and added whatever veggies were hanging around in the fridge. This was quite good!

A very nice change from the normal sweet and sour. Not too sweet.  I added a red bell pepper as well.

Not a bad recipe. I was looking for a stir-fry to use up leftover pork roast. After reading the other reviews, I added a zucchini. I did follow the marinade as given. Since the roast was already cooked, I nibbled on a few pieces of pork as I was chopping the veggies. The taste was pleasing and I figured the finished product would be just as good. However, when I sat down to eat, I felt the lemon juice was quite over-powering. I was still tasting the lemon 4 hours later. 

I'd try this again, but I'll cut the lemon juice down to maybe just an 1/8 cup. I'll probably play with other veggies as well, maybe substituting something for the broccoli. I wonder if asparagus would hold up?

while this is a great recipe for those who love a little sweetnes to their main dishes, it was not a hit with my family.  the peaches add too much sweetness to a dish that is otherwise very good!

My picky 17-year old ate this up, including the vegetables, which is highly unusual.

I only had an hour to marinate, so I did it at room temp. I used fresh ginger and a couple of fresh peaches (with a 1/2 c of water for liquid) that needed to be used up. I also added a tablespoon of Hoisin sauce. I served this over rice cooked in the rice cooker with chicken broth and a teaspoon of Chinese 5-spice powder.

Easy and tasty, if not a little on the bland side.

I did not include broccoli but used swede (rutabaga) instead.  I also used fresh peaches;  I added a bit of water and sugar to replace the juice that would have come from the canned peaches.

I followed the recipe exactly, and neither my husband or I liked it in the least bit.  The peaches gave it a really kinky flavor and a bad aftertaste.  I was disappointed after the great reviews.....it sounded good, but just didn't fly for us.

This was pretty good.  I actually used leftover homemade teriyaki marinade to marinate the pork, so I can't comment on the marinade ingredients.  But it was a good combination with the peaches, and a nice change of pace.

Too much lemon. I did not marinade with pork. I just made the stir fry with the sauce and subbed snow peas. It was tasty, but next time I would cut the lemon juice by half.

I was VERY skeptical about the lemon. But, it turned out fantastic! With the added noodles too, and this is the first time I didn't have to add sauces to the noodles for flavor! I didn't have peaches, but replaced it with Pineapple chunks, and it still turned out fantastic.

It was ok. Tried it a second time with fresh peach slices in a brown sugar sauce and it was a bit better.  Might try it just one more time with a little tweak on the marinade because I think that is where it is falling short for me. I've always loved the fruit/meat contrasts in recipes.

Nope.  Adding peaches ruined this for us.  I didn't keep the leftovers... heck, we couldn't eat more than a couple of bites the first time around.  Very disappointed.

I love to cook stir-fry and the peaches was what made it  different. You can add almost anything additional that you would in any stir-fry (bamboo shoot, water chestnut,...ect). It was a good idea to add the peaches.

I don't normally post a review but have to on this one.  It was delicious. I made noodles boiled in chicken broth, salt,pepper,ginger and garlic powder and topped with the stir fry.  Between three of us we devowered it.

Absolutely delicious! I don't usually rate a recipe if I have changed it but all I did was leave out the lemon and I didn't have time to marinate. Not that I figured the lemon would hurt it, I just didn't have any on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was amazing....no leftovers out of a huge pan full(my nephew and his buddies made sure of it.) I took another reviewer's suggestion and served it with coconut rice and I will be making this often! Super easy too!
