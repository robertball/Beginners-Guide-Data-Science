This was really simple and quick to make.  I served it over a bed of rice and didn't add the full amounts of soy sauce and sugar.  It was still sweet.  I thought it was pretty good for how easy it is to make.  I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites, but it's definitely a keeper.

Quick, easy and tasty.  Great for a quick weeknight meal.  I used fresh green beans and I suppose canned or, even better yet, frozen would work just as well.  I will definitely make this again although I will reduce the amount of soya sauce by half.

My husband doesn't care for green beans, but he loved this dish! Fabulous one-dish meal over rice. I added some black pepper to the meat before cooking. There was too much sauce at the end, so I added 1 TBS corn starch & water to thicken it up.

My personal additions/substitutions: Ground turkey for ground beef; canned French cut green beans for whole; tamari sauce instead of soy sauce; honey for sugar. Also added carrots since I needed to get rid of them. Amounts were all used as measured (for 2 servings), though. All in all, this tasted good - I think the sweetness of the carrots mixed with the honey might have added something, and I also let the meat and veggies sear slightly in the pan to add a slightly smoky flavor. I ate it over ramen noodles with a dash of vinegar, and that tasted good - I suspect it might be equally good over rice, as others suggested.

I like to make this recipe with a can of stewed or diced tomatoes added at the last 5 minutes. Otherwise, it's a little bland. With the tomatoes, it's just like my mom used to make.

Easy, very easy and handy as a last-minute meal. My husband and 15 month old son loved it and ate tons, I had no leftovers.  I actually added a bit more soy sauce than called for, since I use Aloha soy sauce and it's less salty.  Served over japanese sticky rice, it's a good, quick meal.

I served this over rice. it was pretty good. A bit sweet even though I cut the sugar in half! My kids liked so that alone makes this one a repeater. **update** I served the leftovers stuffed in sweet peppers topped with a bit of cheese. This was WONDERFUL. I think this may become my standard pepper stuffing.

We had this as kids growing up, served over steamed rice, only my Dad used slightly thawed mixed frozen veggies (peas, carrots, green beans and corn) and a dash of white pepper. 

Wow, brings back memories...

I also grew up eating this dish.  I never liked veggies but the sweetness of this made me like it.  My son also loves it.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  It's just perfect!!

I combined many of the recommendations and then went by taste.  I thought I had green beans in the freezer but they were an oriental vegetable blend (which worked well but I think I could have used 2 bags instead of 1).  I used tomatoes, onion, garlic (fresh), then added in Emerel spices.  I made a cold bow tie pasta but you definitely need 2 hot items with this dish.  The next day I made some smashed potatoes and used this to go over it.  I also added some sezchaun sauce and that gave it a little pizzaz!  Anyway this goes great over potatoe!  The first night it fed 3 people (plus some pasta) and then there was just enough left for 2 people for leftovers the next night.  It was a good recipe to start off with and then expand on based on your preferences.

Very interesting dish.  I made it and my husband and I weren't crazy about it, but the more you eat of it, the more you like it!  I will make it again but with less sugar next time.  Update:  I was out of green beans so I made it with broccoli, 1/2 Tbs of brown sugar, half an onion, and some spicy pepper paste.  Wow! Very good.

Great, easy reicipe! I had ground beef and green beans and didn't know what to do with them. This recipe came up on my search. I love the simplicity. I do like things seasoned so I added, garlic, ginger and onion. I also substituted low sodium beef broth for the water. I also used low sodium soy sauce. Served this over Lo Mein noodles...YUMMY.

Okay, so I only did 1# frozen green beans with 1/8c sugar & soy.  I can see why kids would like it.  It's sweet, not crazy sweet; but probably enough to get them to have a few - unless they're my kids.  I guess if your kids won't eat meat either, they might this with the hamburger.  For us ... just okay.  I probably won't make it again, but ya never know.

Everybody especially my picky father in law loved this recipe.  I added finely diced onions and carrots.  I used beef broth instead of water, but next time I'll use sodium free broth because it came out a little salty for my taste.

My husband and I loved this.  I used frozen green beans, which I cooked according to the package while I browned the beef.  While I combined the two, I replaced the 1 c of water in the recipe with 2 TBL of sake.  Yum.

I would use Beef Stew Meat Add Some Italian Summer Savory, And cut down on the sugar and Soy (It adds too many calories and Salt)Also a personal pref is to use beer for the liquid as the alcohol is evaporated while cooking and adds to the flavor But that's what recipes are for  "Experimentation"

I wasn't that impressed, but still it was edible and decent when I was running low on food in my kitchen.  I would not go out of my way to make it again unless I found myself in the same position again with just a few ingredients.

I guess this is one of those dishes that you have to acquire a taste for.  I had to try it based on the other great reviews, but my husband and I both agreed this would be the last time I would make it - the flavor was very strange.  I suggest that if you never had it as a child, make it in smaller amounts to try it first.

This was awesome! My husband loved it and suggested it had a beef jerky kind of taste.  My 2 year old gobbled it down.  Defintely suggest trying it with fresh beans, they made the dish!

This was a tasty, easy meal.  I didn't have access to fresh green beans, so I used canned and didn't cook it quite as long.  I served over instant brown rice and my picky eaters lapped it all up!  Due to the one pot prep and the addition of soy sauce, my husband thought he was getting Oriental, which pleased him as well.  I will use this recipe often.

I liked this recipe. I did add some sweet yellow onions cut into straws. They added a nice flavor. I also boiled my green beans in beef broth using a bouillon cube; which added some earthiness. Thank you for this nice recipe.

Like several other reviewers, I cut the sugar a bit, added garlic, oregano and basil for seasonings, and sauteed some onion with the meat.  But I substituted lean ground turkey for the meat, and it still turns out great, just like my parents used to fix it.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I replaced the sugar with Splenda and only used 1 heaping tablespoon along with the soy sauce.  I like things a little spicy, so I added about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes when I added the soy sauce and served over brown rice.  Delicious!

Chopped fresh basil certainly improves this simple, time-saving dish.  I'll probably add some black-bean sauce next time.  I sauteed onion and garlic with only 1/2 lb. ground beef too. The kids liked it.

Yum. I used canned Italian-cut green beans (no need to cook as long) and splenda in place of sugar. Very good, I'll definitely keep this one!

Very good. Very quick!  My husband and newphew ate is up!  I served over rice, and as others suggested, added minced garlic and minced ginger.  I did put the soy sauce in with the water to steam the beans, too.

Very quick and easy.  It's not gourmet, but it did the trick.  Would make again in a pinch.

I found this recipe a bit disappointing -- not very exciting, rather bland.  I have a similar recipe using ground beef and green beans that uses garlic and ginger, soy sauce and a dash vinegar with cornstarch that I prefer.

Simple and tasty. I think it would be better with a little more seasoning but it's great for a budget. I served it over rice.

I found this edible but bland, even after adding red pepper flake and garlic powder generously. Just not my thing.

Great recipe!  Even if you like green beans to begin with!  Very reminiscent of the Japanese flavor I love!  Big hit in this household.  Will definitely make again exactly as recipe calls for.

This is a good, fairly standard okazu recipe, adapted for the American kitchen. The sugar/soy sauce ratio is a little off, but I fixed that when I made it my substituting 1 tbsp of mirin rather than using sugar. I generally use a 3:1 soy to sugar/mirin ratio for okazu. I also generally add minced garlic and ginger (about 1 tbsp each).

My teen and pre-teen both LOVED this! I followed a couple of reviewers suggestions by adding a Tbsp of minced garlic to the ground beef, around a half tsp of crushed red pepper, and a few dashes of onion powder for a bit more flavor. I also used reduced sodium soy sauce and served this over sticky (sushi) rice. We will definitely have this again. Excellent! Thanks so much for sharing.

It doesn't taste as authentic. I would use half soy sauce and half fish sauce. This will give it more depth.

This is one of the first recipes I added to my recipe box back in 2002, and I finally  made it tonight! I added half a sliced onion, half a pound sliced mushrooms, 3 sliced carrots because I needed to use them all up. I also subbed frozen green beans and 1 1/4 pounds extra lean ground turkey. Because of my additions, I made 1 1/2 times the amount of sauce. We really liked it! Yes, it is kind of sweet, but I expected it to be and was pleasantly surprised by the sauce, which I thickened with corn starch. It isn't company fare and certainly not authentic Japanese food, but still nice. My boyfriend wanted it spicier so put Sriracha hot sauce on his. I'm sure I'll make this a lot in the future because it's healthy, easy and tastes good! It's a good recipe to add pretty much whatever extra vegetables you have to.

This is fantastic and South Beach Diet friendly if you substitute Splenda (I use 1/8 c splenda blend), light soy sauce, and brown rice.

This dish satisfied me, my husband, and my toddler daughter, so I'll definitely be making it again!  I tweaked the recipe to add more flavors, though. I sauteed the ground meat with diced onion and about 1 tsp. minced garlic.  I also added a can of sliced water chestnuts near the end of cooking for extra crunch, and mixed in a few teaspons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I cut the sugar in half, like others have suggested, and it was just the right amount of sweetness.  Frozen green beans worked fine.  A very simple and satisfying dish -- if you serve with rice and fresh fruit, you've got a complete meal.

This was a bit sweet for me, but my husband took two helpings.  I used beef tenderloin rather than ground beef.  Also added sliced onion when cooking the beef for an extra vegetable.  I also put some cornstarch into the water/sugar/soy-sauce mixture so that it would thicken slightly.  Served over rice.  Will definitely make this again, as it was so easy to prepare, and could be very versatile.  Thanks, April!

Great way to use ground beef and we will make again!

This is a definite keeper!  It was super easy and even my "I don't eat meat" daughter loved it!  I used canned green beans (the no salt kind) instead of fresh and it made it much faster for the time conscience person.

WOW!!  It was so easy and good.  My DH and I couldn't figure out where we knew the taste from and then it hit me.....YOSHINOYA!!  If you have never had the pleasure of Yoshinoya Beef Bowl then you are missing it my friend.  Anyway, I used about a 1 1/2 pound of beef (browned with garlic and black pepper), doubled the soy sauce and sugar (and still not enough liquid for us) and petite frozen green beans.  DH says it needed thin sliced onions (didn't do it because my boy doesn't like them).  It was so quick, easy and yummy...this will become part of my dinner rotation!!

Mehh...didn't care for this as much as I'd hoped. It seemed lacking, so I added some minced fresh garlic, ground cumin and cinnamon and that was a bit more interesting.  I think some chopped onions would have been a nice touch as well. Served it over Jasmin rice.

This is a great recipe for college students who have a tight budget! I did everything according to the recipe, but I added carrots (I can't eat them normally, but they taste delicious here) and switched the sugar with honey, as one reviewer suggested. Delicious, especially over medium or short grain rice!

This was good.  For a healthier version I substituted ground turkey and splenda.  I added diced onion at the beginning of the recipe when I was browning the meat.  I also seasoned the meat with a little garlic and pepper.

I used frozen beans.  It was way too sweet, so I tried to compensate with soy sauce and sherry which produced inedible results. If you try this, start with half the sugar and add more if needed.

I substituted diced chicken breasts for beef. I doubled the recipe but only used half the sugar. I added sliced red pepper, garlic, green onion and thickened with corn starch. Served with basmati rice. I will definately make this again. The family loved it.

Found this dish intriguing. I added diced sweet onion to the ground beef and used frozen beans. Proceeded per recipe, adding a bit of corn starch to thicken the gravy. End result I found flavorless so added lots of black pepper, garlic powder, and some salt. Still didn't taste like much. Disappointed, I set it aside and made some rice to serve it over. Well..45 minutes later at dinner time this dish had soaked up the flavors of the gravy and was quite tasty! Also made a lot. Fed 4 adults and a child, and two of us had seconds. All in all a nice, easy, economical meal. Thanks : )

Nice!  We took a previous suggestion and added a can of diced tomatoes, and cut the sugar to two tablespoons.  Everybody liked it!

This reminds me of a dish called Ganbian doujiao in Chinese, pretty much the same thing but with ground pork (which I used instead of beef) and it's spicy and sweet.  I used extra dark soy sauce because it's all I had and the dish came out black!  It looked intimidating but good nonetheless.  Goes great with white rice.

Very good!  It's a unique dish.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  Updated:  I now serve it over rice; it makes for a more complete meal.  But I only cook the beans about 5 minutes or so then take off the lid so there's more juice left for the rice.  Then cook uncovered just a few minutes longer.  Thanks for sharing!

Really pretty good and so quick and easy.  I added 3 carrots and 1/2 a sweet onion as well as 2 extra Tbsp. sugar.  After the dish sat though, I regretted the extra sugar.  It seemed to sweeten overnight. So, I went ahead and added some rice in the morning and some extra soy sauce.  All in all, it was good though.  Kind of syrupy sweet, the sauce reminded me of when syrup from pancakes runs over on your sausage.

I've made this 4 times now and my whole family loves it!  I did change a few things...like doubling the sauce, using light soy instead of regular, and a few tsp of spicy Hunan smokehut hibachi grill sauce (House of Tsang)yummmm. Thanks for the great recipe!

We're not a fan of sweet dinner. I must make mention that cane sugar is much sweeter than beet sugar. If using cane sugar, I would adjust the sugar to 1 Tbsp.  If you get the right sugar/soy ratio it should taste like teriyaki.

I made this for my group of 12 high school boys. It was devoured. I've made it a few times before, and when scaling the recipe up, I'd recommend the following:
1.) Do not multiply the water 1:1. For 5 lbs of ground beef I used no more than 2.5 cups of water.
2.) Add a chopped onion to the ground beef, cook, drain, then add garlic & fresh ginger.
3.) Brown sugar instead of white. I only used 1/2 cup for 5 lbs ground beef.
4.) I throw the green beans in last once everything has cooked & become flavorful. Cook until tender then serve.

I needed to clear my refrigerator and needed to use about a pound of green beans. I didn't have any meat around but less than half a pound of high quality organic ground beef. I was very to find this recipe and see the reviews to get the idea for a easy stir fry.
My changes were to start with a piece of ginger (removed before serving), then I added a few cloves of minced garlic and quarter of sweet onion. After that I browned the meat, it didn't have a very high fat content and so left juices in. French cut green beans after adding them threw in some coconut aminos (trying out a soy sauce substitute for curiosity sake) and some oyster sauce.
My mom taught me to always count your ginger so you know how many to look for before plating.
Served over rice was a delicious satifiying lunch for three people.

I added can corn to make it a bit more filling and chili flakes instead of sugar.. I'm not into the sweet and salty flavor. Ate it with white rice and added franks red hot sauce to my plate for an extra kick.. I can sit and eat it all day.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  Although, I did cut down on the sugar considerably (just added little by little until it was to my taste.)  Also, added some lo mein noodles at the end as per another reviewer.  Perfect for a quick weeknight meal.  This will definitely be part of my rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added ginger, onion, and garlic to try to give this some flavor and that didn't help. My whole family ended up adding hot sauce just to make it passable. The sugar is the predominant flavor. Easy to make but not for us.

I ate green bean Okazu growing up in hawaii. This is a great basic go-to recipe. To make it fantastic and add more depth to this dish, here are the changes I made: 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce, 2 t black pepper, 1 med chopped onion, 1 T granulated garlic, 1/2 cup of cooking Sherry. Then it add a touch more soy sauce and sugar to balance out what I added. Ono grinds with sticky rice!! Ps, I insist on the cooking sherry, it brings everything together! Yum!

I've made this recipe now 5 or 6 times. We like it as a quick family meal (served over white rice). I do add onions and sliced water chestnuts when I have them. I added salt and pepper and fresh garlic, too.

I added a tiny bit of Worcestershire to the soy/sugar mix, sesame seeds, and sauteed red onion and garlic to the meat, and I boiled a couple new potatoes that I cut into tiny chunks to throw in with the whole dish.  I used green beans that steam in the microwave, so cooking time came down with that.  I am serving it over some steamed white rice.  My family and I love recipes like this!  Simple to make and very yummy!  I will use this one again!

My hubby LOVES this dish! The only thing I do different is I add a little Worcestershire sauce( to taste) when I add in the soy sauce. I serve this with mashed potatoes and even the kids eat it up!

This is a great recipe and easy to prepare. Because I am diabetic, I used 2 packets of Splenda instead of the sugar. I have also added tofu cut into cubes for a variation. Also, broccoli or asparagus can be used instead of beans.

My family loves this recipe!  And on evenings when I am really in a hurry I substitute frozen or even canned green beans for a super fast dish!  It's such a joy to find recipes all three of my children like...

this was okay.  the sauce wasn't thick enough though.  i think the other reviews offered some good ideas to add some other ingredients into the mix.  i'm thinking it may taste better as 'leftovers' - tbd.

This was delicious!
I boiled fresh green beans for 10 min before adding it to browned ground turkey. I still added the cup of water since I thought there would not be enough sauce to coat everything while in the pot. I ended up with more than enough sauce and drained more than half of it - I would save it if I could!

I love it, but it's a little too sweet and strong flavored for my husband and kids.

Good.  I forgot to add sugar, and I used ground turkey instead of beef.

The kids liked it. They told me to rate it 4 stars because it was good, but they still aren't fond of green beans

It was tasty but fairly bland - I thickened the sauce, but would have liked more of it.  It was definitely a great way to get everyone to eat a large portion of veggies!

This is a fine meal, although nothing special.  I added 1 tsp each of minced garlic, oregano and basil and it was still rather bland.  It may have been more flavorfull if I had served it by itself, but over mashed potatoes it really didn't taste like much.  I did cut back the sugar to 1 heaping Tbsp and I didn't think it had any sweetness to it at all.  It's a good way to get the veggies in though!

My husband liked this (he likes anything sweet), but I felt it was too sweet and had no other flavors to recommend it.

Very easy dish to prepare and will make again, but will leave out the sugar.  I questioned putting it in and only put in half the amount (used 2 T Splenda).  Will definitely leave out next time.  Used extra lean ground sirloin and served on brown rice.

This is one of the best recipes I have and one the of the easiest!  It works great for South Beach Diet too with sugar substitutes.

I first submitted a review for this recipe 6 years ago when we were a family of 3.  Two children and 6 years later, this is still big on our list!  We've made a few healthier adjustments as I've adjusted this recipe to work with the Trim Healthy Mama plan.  I subbed the soy sauce for Bragg's Liquid Aminos (tastes the SAME) and subbed the sugar for Stevia (not 1:1).  It came out better than I expected, the kids (and parents) gobbled it up, and no unnecessary spike to anyone's blood sugar, yay!  Our children enjoy this over brown rice, makes for a hearty meal!

I was anxious to try this recipe but I was left feeling disappointed. My boyfriend and I both thought it was bland and not very impressive,
even after I added onions and a bit of garlic. 
We didn't hate it, we just agreed that it seemed to be missing something.

I omit the sugar since it was needed and added more fresh garlic.
