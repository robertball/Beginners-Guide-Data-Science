It would have been nice if the recipe author would have included a recipe for Asian dressing because the dressing really could make or break this salad.  I had some Ken’s Steak House® Lite Asian Sesame with Ginger & Soy Dressing in the fridge which worked well.  IMO, a dressing is not an option because, otherwise, this salad would be very dry.  I ran a little short on the spinach, so I added other salad greens I had on hand.  At the dinner table, my husband asked me what we were eating, I told him the name of the recipe, and he suggested we add some chow mein noodles to the salad.  I had them in the cabinet, so we did (after the photo was taken), and that gave this a nice little crunch.  Enjoyed this as a main course dinner salad which with a cup of soup.
