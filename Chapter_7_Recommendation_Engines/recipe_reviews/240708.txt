There is simplicity and depth of flavor packed in every single bite. It felt like I was eating gourmet Chinese food from P.F. Changs. I vow to never order this as takeout EVER AGAIN! Even the kids said it tasted better than Chinese food. I pretty much followed as is and I have ZERO complaints. This will be a go to staple in my home. Off to make a second batch!

To be honest, I made this recipe b/c I didn't have any sherry in the house and was looking for a quick and easy recipe my 10-yr old daughter and I could do together.  I prepared ingredients as instructed but I did a few things differently:

1.  I removed the chicken from the wok as soon as it was cooked so that it wouldn't get dry, and then I  put it back int the wok once the broccoli had cooked for a few minutes (had turned a slightly emerald/deep green).

2.  I put in most but not all of the soy sauce mixture (into which I had also add fresh garlic/ginger and not powdered).

3.  I only added about half of the cornstarch/water mix.  I suggest adding a little at a time — if you are cooking at a med high/high heat you will be able to tell when you have enough.

These little changes really helped and allowed for moist chicken, crunchy but well cooked broccoli and a not-too goopy sauce!

I would have given this 5 stars but I made a few changes.  I used 1/3 cup of low-sodium soya sauce.  I did not use any oil for frying.  I cooked the chicken in a small amount of water,  let the water cook off and then seasoned it.  I added a touch of onion powder and cayenne pepper to the soya sauce mixture.  I also added minced garlic and ginger to the soya sauce mixture.  Once I mixed up the chicken with the sauce I added hot sauce (since I love my food spicy).  It came out great.  My boyfriend could not stop stealing pieces from the pot.  I will definitely add this to the rotation!

I'm made this for dinner and loved it! I'm not a salt person so it was a little too salty and I found it to have a bit too much sauce, so I will cut the sauce by about a 1/3, but loved it! Will be demoing this for my students tomorrow.

I found it way too goopy. Way to much sauce for the amount of chicken and broccoli the recipe called for, also to salty.

This tasted pretty good.  The only substitution I made is low-sodium soy sauce instead of regular. I also used about a quarter less soy sauce than the recipe called for.  The issue I faced is that this dish is not good for leftovers.  The next day I brought it to work and tried to heat it up in the microwave.  It was extremely gloopy and thick.  I think next time I will try to use half the amount of cornstarch to make the recipe a little thinner and more leftover-friendly.

Made this last night and it was yummy. Followed what other reviewers said and cut the soy sauce by one third, and only used the portion of sauce and cornstarch mixture that seemed right for the total amount of food while finishing the cooking. But first I cooked the chicken and onions with some minced garlic, then set aside the chicken pieces do they would not over cook, added and fried the broccoli, and added then back the chicken before adding the sauce and corn starch. And, because I love red bell pepper and had one, I added it in a 3/4 inch dice. Another variation I may try in the future--add whole cashews near the end. Would go perfectly in this.

I made this for dinner tonight. Fantastic! I usually use premade sauces and have trouble with the amount of salt, but this was so great, I used low sodium soy sauce and had no issues. I added some bean sprouts and water chestnuts, left out the onion. I love how versatile this recipe is. A keeper for sure.

I use this recipe as a base and added sliced carrots and sesame oil to this. It was a hit at my home and I would even consider trying the original recipe in the future and adding more than 3 cups of broccoli since I added three to my two chicken breast measurement and it was not enough :/ other than that I loved it!

My rating is really just for the sauce and cooking method. I used chicken, onions and broccoli but also added carrots, celery, mushrooms, snap peas and water chestnuts. Very good, simple stir fry. Will definitely make again.

I found that it was too salty. I would definitely reduce the soy sauce to 1/3 or 1/4 cup instead of the 2/3 cup.

Fast, easy and tasty.  The only change I made was to use grated fresh ginger instead of the ground ginger for more flavor.

I made mine with a 1/3 cup of both low sodium soy and oyster sauce. If you have fresh garlic and ginger root then that stir-fries great with onions and sesame oil. Broccoli stir-fry with chicken and this sauce is delicious.

SO GOOD!  I did tweek it a tad.  I didn't use a regular onion because I hate cutting onion when I don't have to.  I also added Bangkok Peanut sauce.  I did that once the soy sauce and cornstarch were mixed in.  I also added green onion and a red bell pepper.  This was also done towards the end.

If you like drinking soy sauce this one is for you. If not, pass on this recipe. Not any good at all. The first recipe from this site that was a flop. 

Honestly. No taste other than soy sauce.

We all thought this was yummy! The sauce was just the right texture and consistency, even as leftovers. It makes more than 3 servings (although I didn't measure everything exactly, like the broccoli). I am making this again soon!

I too used low sodium soy sauce & added some different veggies. since my boyfriend is allergic to onions, I started with sliced water chestnuts & baby corn, adding in snap peas & broccoli last. With the sauce, I slow simmered to get a much thicker sauce & let the batch set covered for a bit and it thickened up perfectly. Definitely making this again!

This was awesome!  I made some changes, but I'm still rating as a 5 because I believe it would be perfect without my changes.  I just added more veggies: red bell pepper, carrots. I bet mushrooms would be good! I decreased the amount of soy sauce because of a couple of complaints about it being too salty.  The technique described to thicken the sauce was perfect.  This was so easy and perfect.  Thank you, Jeri!

Made as directed, but it was quite salty.  Next time, I will use half soy sauce, half chicken broth to make it less salty.  Overall, family enjoyed it though.  :)

As written it is inedible. Way too salty. I wish the author would please re-post it with far less soy sauce, and low sodium. I was too lazy to fix the quantities and my husband and I are draining the sauce and regretting it now!

I made one change, white sugar instead of brown. Didn't have any brown. I used low sodium soy sauce. It was to salty to eat.

I cut the recipe amounts in half since I live alone. It was so salty I couldn't eat it. When if was making it,  I thought that there was much more soy sauce than I'd usually use - and I like salt. But this was a waste of time and food. I'll try it again with way less soy sauce.

I agree with so many others about the saltiness so the next time I will use low sodium as I did cut back on the amount I used. A very simple and fast recipe which can be enhanced with other veggies. Overall a great recipe, thanks for posting. I

there was way too much soy sauce which made it too salty.    A large adjustment in the amount of soy sauce is needed.  maybe water or broth.  
Even after rinsing all the sauce off the chicken and broccoli they couldn't be salvaged

This is SO good - fast, easy and inexpensive. Can be adapted to taste (thinking water chestnuts, mushrooms, matchstick carrots, or using a bag of stir fry veggies instead or in addition to the broccoli )! 
My kids already want to know when I'm making it again and we just had it tonight!  Thanks for sharing this one!

We eat a lot of stir fries and were looking for a sauce that was less salty than what we usually eat. I made this exactly as the recipe was written except I used 1/2 less soy sauce than the recipe called for. Yes, it was less salty, but it was also inedible. Everything turned into a black sodden mess as soon as I added the sauce. The flavor was horrible, almost bitter, as if the brown sugar burned immediately in the wok.

Waaaay too salty. Definitely need to use either low sodium soy sauce or just less soy sauce period.

It was very tasty. I did use low sodium soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce. Definitely would have been too salty. Also, I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil just because I had it on hand from another recipe.

I made this GF by using aminos and cornstarch instead of soy sauce and flour.  From experience I know I always need to reduce the aminos otherwise it is so salty I can’t eat it.  They are about the same as regular soy sauce.  I doubled the sauce, but used only 1/3 c. aminos and it turned out great.  I also added ginger powder to it.  Both of those changes made it perfect.

Next time I will reduce the brown sugar and add a little chicken broth to make the light soy sauce I used less salty.
Otherwise a great meal.

I followed the recipe for the most part - I left the wok/pan get really hot and drizzled a little sesame oil in the pan then sauteed the broccoli and onion, removed veggies and set them aside and did the sam for the cut up pieces of chicken. The whole family enjoyed this dish!  Since my husband likes extra sauce on his rice, I made an additional side sauce and warmed it up for him to drizzle over the rice and veggies!

My kids are somewhat picky eaters and they loved this recipe. The flavor was a little strong for my wife though. I'll probably try less sauce next time. I also added cashews which was yummy. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

Very good, simple and tasty. I think next time, I will add a little sliced celery, and maybe some sliced water chestnuts. The veggies cook down, the chicken does not.

I wanted to like this-quick and easy-but it's way too salty. Saltier than a prepared marinade, which I'll use next time.

31/2 stars.  Good, but not exceptional.  I need to add a bit more flavor and a bit more heat.  I kept out red peppers and cayenne for a diner's diet, (no "deadly nightshade" relatives.)
To give this a fair test, since it is basically good, I will tweak it a bit.  I like to use thighs for more flavor and moistness.

I made this dish for dinner a few evenings ago.  Sorry to say, my family thought the sauce was a bit too strong.  They aren't big soy sauce fans and the sauce is heavy on soy.  I tried again using just chicken broth, added garlic but did use the other spices....I did leave out the brown sugar.  This was more to my kids liking.  Adding the broccoli as this recipe calls for did leave it crunchy just the way we like it.

Holy sodium, Batman! Honestly, this is almost too salty to eat. But I can tell the flavor is under there somewhere, so I'm willing to give it another try with low sodium soy sauce. The sauce is gorgeous and the perfect consistency.

The dish was easy to make and the flavor was good, however should have listened to other reviews and gone with low sodium soy sauce and added water. It was Very salty to me. Will definitely make again with those changes.

Was the most salty meal i've ever ate in my life. I'd try using way less than 3/4 cup of soy sauce next time. Or low sodium soy sauce.

I made this recipe as directed, except I added 1/2 cup of cashews and a can of sliced water chestnuts.  It was good, but too salty and I used light soy sauce.  I also added a few rice noodles to add crunch and finish the dish. I will make it again with less soy.

Very easy to make and taste amazing. I did it exactly how the recipe said. Next, will add some sesame seed, minced garlic and carrots to it.

Kids and adults both loved it.  Steamed broccoli  separately because we like it crunchy. Might try a little less sugar next time.

Overall the recipe was good. I added two tablespoons of garlic, some mushrooms and carrots. I also used sesame oil to cook the chicken.

This is a really good recipe. I love that you make your own sauce, although I found the sauce to be really salty even with low sodium soy sauce. Still giving it 5 stars though, this is a good recipe.

4 stars only because of grated over fresh ginger. I Added hoisin sauce and sesame oil, touch and a half to my taste each. I also prefer my final sauce to be on the thicker end, so I put @ 1tspn more corn starch. The base recipe is great, do what I did or follow exactly for a litmus test, either choice its pleasant and you can always adjust.

Instead of sliced onions, I chopped them. Just a personal preference. Otherwise it was easy to make and tasted great. I used low sodium soy sauce.

This was very good.  I only used 1/4 cup of Soy sauce since I was not using low sodium soy sauce.  I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables along with a couple cups of fresh broccoli florets.  Healthy and quick.  Definitely will make again!

Made this exactly to recipe, except one substitution.  I used Tamari Sauce instead of Soy Sauce, because that's what I had on hand, and it was amazing!!  The Tamari sauce is much less salty and a little thicker.  This dish is definitely a staple in our house now!

I added a table spoon of oyster sauce and I doubled the ingredients (so double the oyster sauce if you double the ingredients) and I used half low sodium soy sauce and half soy sauce. I also used half ground ginger and fresh ginger. I also added garlic. Did the same for garlic as the ginger! If you're not doubling the ingredients you got your math cut out for you

I made this exactly as recipe and nobody liked it that much. Way too salty from the soy sauce and just tasted like soy chicken and broccoli.
Quick and easy though and will try again adding some fresh ginger and maybe a little melted marmalade or jelly to sweeten.

I made the recipe exactly as it was written, but used grapeseed oil & low sodium soy sauce. Love love the flavor! I seriously told a friend that it’s just as good as any I’ve had out lately. And I made it myself at home. I can’t wait to try it with other vegetables. Snow peas, carrots, even green beans!

We’re usually a takeout family for ethnic food but I decided to get a little adventurous and cook this delicious stir fry at home. To all the naysayers saying it’s too salty, how do you think any chef makes turns a meat into a treat?

Like my boys’ old elementary school principal once said, “it takes a village to raise a child, and a spoonful of salt to get ‘em to eat.”

I cut the soy sauce in half (only 1/3 cup) like other reviewers recommended, and it still turned out both too salty and too sweet. Like another reviewer said, this was the first highly-rated recipe from this site we've ever made that didn't turn out well. We won't be making this again.

I made this as directed but used leftover chicken from “Mediterranean marinade” from this site (won’t make again due to it tasting like only lemon juice chicken). Regardless, used a bag of frozen, thawed broccoli to go with this and I always use low sodium soy sauce. Followed the directions and did not change a thing and this was just fantastic. Huge props to the recipe poster. We couldn’t stop eating it. I have no idea how anyone has to much juice for this as reviews have stated. It stuck right to the veggies and chicken and I made another batch of just sauce so we had enough for rice. One of the very few recipes I’ve made from this site and changed nothing. Thank you so much.

This would be better if the soy sauce was less or at least a low sodium soy. It was sooo salty

Delicious, but I think the recipe calls for too much soy sauce. I cut it in half and added some ginger and garlic. Included red pepper flakes for a kick.Such a refreshing change from takeout Chinese food.

I made this for my family last night and they loved it!! I just omitted the red pepper flakes because they don’t like them. I might change the amounts of liquid in the future to make more sauce but otherwise it was a hit! Easy one pan meal for busy weeknights and even lunch the next day!

Delicious. Definitely consider watering down your soy sauce or low sodium soy sauce. 2/3 of whatever you use choose is the correct proportion. I also only needed half of the cornstarch mixture. The broccoli really absorbs the soy sauce flavor so sautéing it separately, and adding the soy sauce to the chicken first & cornstarch, and then add the sautéed broccoli at the end, you will get a better flavor so the broccoli is not overpowered by the soy sauce. I’m definitely making it again trying those adaptations. Either way it was a hit. The kids loved it but they said that mommy put way too much soy sauce.

My whole family thought this was a very excellent meal. 
I did add 4 cups of chicken broth for a sauce and served with rice. 
I also made sautéed mushrooms and garlic in  a separate pan for those who enjoy mushrooms with this dish.

It took me longer to prepare then 15 mins. It took at least 35 mins after cutting Chicken, onions and repairing other ingredients. I used low sodium soy & it was still super salty. My husband liked it.

I loved this recipe.  I did dredge the chicken in flour first having found that the chicken will remain crisper when a sauce is added if I do this. I removed it from the pan before cooking the onion and broccoli.  I then removed them and made the sauce, adding all back when the sauce was what I wanted.  I always cut back on soy sauce in recipes so I did that here as well.  I replaced it with vegetable broth and everything was perfect.  Thanks for posting

This was easy and good.  I would reduce the amount of sugar and add garlic next time.  The sauce had a great consistency and there was plenty of it if you would like to eat it with rice.

I love the chicken and broccoli at my local chinese restaurant , but sad to say, move over, because I will be making this dish myself at home from now on!
This is truly the best dish I have ever made and the most tasty. My family loved and gave the thumbs up on this!.....We are lovers of stir fry dishes, and chicken and broccoli is my favorite...NO MORE CHINESE RESTAURANTS!.....I'll use my own skills through Allrecipes!
Thanks so much once again, you guys making cooking so easy!....*****

Was pretty delicious. I think I’ll take the suggestion that another review mentioned and use low-sodium soy sauce instead next time. It was borderline too salty.

My husband and I loved this. I used low sodium soy sauce and added other veggies to dilute it. We added peppers, carrots, and zucchini in addition to the onions and broccoli. Very yummy, will make again.

It is a fantastic base for a wonderful meal! I added sesame seeds, cashews, mushrooms, and white rice. That made it an actual meal. Next time I might add other Asian type vegetables in as well.

The only change I made was to use low salt soy sauce and it was plenty salty. I  did have to add extra water as it thickened up faster than I expected. I will make it again.  I will probably add carrots to this next time, but there will be a next time.

(My son is gluten free so it uses other things in place of soy sauce, FYI.)
I made this before and it was way too salty for us.  This time I doubled the sauce, but I was using double the chicken plus I added chinese cabbage and water chestnuts just because I had them. Sauce changes: i used half of the amount of tamari (low sodium and in place of the soy sauce, I think they taste identical), the other half coconut amino (trying to use less soy).  I used 1/3 cup dry marsala wine and 1/3 cup water. I added 3 fresh garlic cloves and fresh ginger (1tsp) instead of powdered. When the sauce cooked it was too thick, so I kept adding chicken broth until it was the right consistency, and it was a full 8oz.  I had way too much sauce, but the flavor was great. It didn't feel so much harder with the extra ingredients as I use frozen fresh garlic and ginger, and water chestnuts come out of a can.  But it was really tasty and kids liked it a lot.  :) Next time I will change the amounts of everything so way less sauce, but will keep proportions the same as close as my brain can figure out anyway.  ;)

this was a fantastic recipe that tasted very similar to what you'll get at a restaurant in my opinion.  I did skip the ginger because I hate it and instead of red pepper flakes, I used two Thai peppers.  I also used 3 heaping tablespoons of garlic while cooking the chicken and onion.

Fabulous and turns out great every time.  No substitutions needed.  Just follow recipe and it is better than take-out or most Restaurants.

I like to follow the recipes the first time. I think I’ll start reading the comments first, lol. Yes, low sodium soya, and a little sriracha sauce. Yes, going into my favourites.

I made this today for lunch. I used 1/2 low sodium soy and 1/2 regular soy.  It was still too salty, but the over all flavor is what I was looking for.  I will use only low sodium soy next time, and maybe a pinch more sugar. I also added some garlic to the sauce .

I jazzed it up by adding a little fish sauce and the juice of 1/2 an orange. Used the velveting technique for the chicken before adding to the stirfry. Excellent! I wish I owned a wok though.

very good, easy and fast. I also used beef for stir frying instead of chicken and it still turned out great. I added a little extra red pepper flakes caz I like things spicy and it was not overly spicy for us.

With the changes mentioned by a lot of the other reviewers, this recipe is five stars! I reduced the amount of soy sauce to 1/4 cup (and used low sodium), reduced the amount of cornstarch and water to 1 tbsp. of each, and used about 1/2 tsp. fresh grated ginger instead of the powdered ginger. I also tried it with leftover rotisserie chicken instead of the raw chicken, I just added it later in the cooking process so it did not dry out. Made with these changes the recipe was delicious and made for great leftovers the next day. I will definitely be making this again!

Easy to make, great taste. I used Tamari reduced sodium and it was not salty.  Next time I will probably add carrots and use a little less onion.  Overall good recipe.

This is a good easy stir fry recipe. I added broccoli, snow peas, red peppers, and mushrooms to the chicken and broccoli because I like lots of veggies. The sauce was good by itself and the only thing I added was a bit of garlic. My son liked it so much he tried to drink the sauce lol.

For sure you need to cut the amount of say sauce by 1/2.  The soy sauce flavour was wayyyyy too much do not use more than 1/3 cup at the most.

This was good I followed the recipe and added a few things to my liking. The one thing I did do is I bought a bottle of  Fuji Apple Pear water and made the minute rice with it. It gave just a bit of fruity and sweet flavor which seemed to pair well with the dish.

I followed this recipe and added carrots and fresh ginger. I also used lite soy sauce instead of the regular, since many suggested it. I’m not sure where I went wrong but it was extreme salty! I had to throw it away because it was that much.

I loved this and my husband REALLY loved this, he is asking for it all of the time!  We are kind of bad about eating our vegetables so I made this with an onion, broccoli, carrots and water chestnuts for a little crunch.  I have also made this with NY strip steak and it was sooooo good.  I cut the steak nice and thin and  browned it with a little garlic as well.  This sauce is awesome on chicken and beef.  I am making it again tonight!

This was an easy dish to prepare.  I followed the recipe except I added a dash of garlic and used low sodium soy sauce.  Next time, I think I will cut back on the soy sauce and use a little more water.  Even though I used the low sodium soy sauce it seemed a little salty for our taste.  Another thing I think will add next time is either bamboo shoots or water chestnuts for a little crunch.  I will definitely make this dish again.

This dish was just so-so.   I added freshly chopped garlic to the chicken and onions while they were cooking.   Instead of just broccoli, I used some frozen stir fry mixed vegetables that I had on hand.  I also use low sodium soy sauce as other reviewers suggested.  Two tablespoons of cornstarch was way too much for the amount of liquid that was produced for this recipe, so I added some low sodium chicken broth to give the sauce better consistency.  Next time, I think I will add some garlic powder and perhaps some white pepper, rather than the red pepper flakes, to give it a bit more flavor.

The recipe dish lacked flavor and spiciness so I added minced Thai pepper and cashew nuts. That helped immensely. I also diluted corn starch paste with two more tablespoons of water. It was good - not great.

I followed the recipe except I used low sodium soy sauce and added pineapple chunks and it was delicious!  My husband loved it and I'll be making it again!

I made this dish last night and my family hated it. It was far too salty and the slurry of cornstarch lumbed-up as soon as added to the sauce. I tossed the whole pan in a colandar and rinsed it off under running water  and heated it back up . The chicken was still salty and the broccoli over-cooked at this point.

I prepared the sauce and placed the cut up chicken in it for 30 minutes.  This made the chicken very tender and flavorful.  Served it over rice.  I prefer a bit more sauce so I doubled the sauce the second time I made this and it was perfect

Excellent! Even my picky 13 year old liked it! For my liking, next time, I would triple the Veges( I added pea pods and water chestnuts as well), double the sauce ingredients, and use grated fresh ginger. I also used low sodium soy sauce

Great recipe, although I made a few changes. I used fresh ginger, instead of powder. I added some toasted sesame oil and hot chili oil. I also used tamari instead of soy. I served it on brown rice. Was delicious!

I made this tonight for Dinner.  I did not  have quite enough soy sauce so I mixed 3 tablespoons of water with 1 tablespoon of Hoisin sauce.  Served over rice and it was delicious.  My husband and Grandson loved it.

This is an easy, good recipe. I did not find it too salty at all.  I even used frozen broccoli (I let it sit out a bit while I was getting everything together).  After reading a bunch of the reviews, I threw some minced garlic in when sauteing.  I don't think I needed to as I couldn't taste any garlic in the dish.  Also, when it was in the last few minutes of cooking, I threw in a can of (drained) bean sprouts,  I will make this again and add more vegetables. You can really stretch this dish by adding the extra veggies.

My boyfriend asked for seconds! I made it with frozen chicken and it was very moist and delicious. Added black pepper, green onions, shredded carrot, a pinch more brown sugar than the recipe called for, and a little garlic powder. Put about an 1/8th of a cup less soy sauce than it asked for, and a slight less bit of garlic powder and cornstarch. Used frozen broccoli but it cooked a little faster so five minutes like the recipe stated might be too much if you use frozen too. Served over white rice and it was perfect.

A hit with everyone.  I used veggies I had on hand. Use 1 tbsp each cornstarch and water if you like a thinner sauce.

It makes a REALLY BIG difference on the soya sauce that you use. The darker the soya the saltier it will be. If you you Rooster Brand golden soya sauce it is perfect.

The directions were easy t o follow. I think it would have been really great if I hadn't over cooked the vegetables. 
Willing to cook this again.

It had very good flavor but it was pure  salt , and I like salt.  The dish can not use 3/4 cup of soy sauce. I will make it again but I will try low sodium soy sauce and will use less than 1/2 a cup and add 1/4 cup of water, it should still have plenty of flavor this way

My family loves this recipe! I added celery, water chestnuts, cashews and sesame seeds, and deleted the pepper flakes. I also changed the chicken from breasts to thighs.
It's so easy to make & easy clean up too.

This was delicious. I added peppers and onion. I would use low sodium soy sauce next time. Also agree with adding about 1/2 cup of water.

Excellent and easy.  Agree it rivals or exceeds most restaurant.  Followed the recipe exactly, except added fresh ginger and for dietary reasons substituted 1/5 cup splenda, olive oil, and served over  brown rice.  Also works well if you want to saute extra vegetables to add (carrots, celery, mushrooms, etc or touch of garlic, etc).

The saltiness was fine for me, but if sensitive might want to sub some low sodium soy for some or all.

Thanks for sharing

So easy and tastes great.  I added 1 clove of garlic and about a teaspoon of fresh ginger. I marinated the chicken in the soy mixture for about 15 minutes and then I accidentally added the sauce with the chicken (instead of stir frying the chicken on its own). It was still awesome and my annoyingly picky kids even ate it!

Tasty and quick! Used low sodium soy sauce and caramelized the onions before adding the chicken. Then added some garlic and a bit more red pepper flakes to the soy mixture. We all went for 2nds and will definitely make again.

This is a good basic recipe to learn the basic proportions, so you can adjust it to your liking. as well as what you have available. This is quick and relatively healthy if you are easy on the soy and sugar. 

The only two things I'd adjust to suit your taste is the salt and cornstarch. This called for A LOT of soy sauce so I chose to add a 1/4 cup and it was enough. I only ended up using about half of the cornstarch, as it didn't need it, and it was still appealing the next day as leftovers.

I added sautéed mushrooms and red bell pepper just to bump up the color and  flavor. To the lower sodium soy sauce, I added two tablespoons of water. It was still plenty salty. While the chicken and broccoli were cooking, I added 1/4 cup of chicken stock. Next time I would either marinate the chicken chunks in the soy sauce mixture, or take the chicken out before adding the broccoli so the chicken might not dry out. There was an adequate amount of sauce, but I might like a tad more.

I made this after reading reviews, and many writing that it was too salty.  I had two breast halves so I reduced the 2/3 cups of soy sauce to 1/2 cup but I kept the same 1/4 cup amount of brown sugar as for three halves in the recipe, and I kept the same amounts for the rest of the ingredients.  It came out great and it was a nice balance of sweet and salty.  I put it over 1/2 lb of thin spaghetti and then mixed it in and served it in a big bowl.  It's a keeper and next time I'll change the original ingredients only in the amount of brown sugar by adding an additional 1/3 cup or little less.  I think it needs the soy sauce flavor so I don't want to reduce that  or dilute it.

1st time I made it there was to much sauce over everything.   Its delicious, just a little over powering.   2nd time I only coated the chicken & onions, placing them over the plated the steamed broccoli.   Thank you for the recipe, its Very good!

We really liked this. I had to make a few changes for my husband. I used asparagus instead as my hubby hates broccoli and I used orange juice instead of the water to add a little citrusy flavor. I will definitely make again.

Super tasty --- but --- the sauce was way too thick. First, of course, do not use all of the corn starch. But, I think adding 1/2 cup of water to the sauce mix is more of the right answer!

I made this for dinner today and it was a hit. I agree that it can be a bit salty so I just added a little more sugar and water to combat that. It's yummy. Packed it for myself for lunch.

This was delicious! A quick and easy stir fry that could easily be modified for people's tastes. I added mushrooms because I had some on hand and used fresh minced ginger. I served it over noodles. Very good- I will make it again.

My husband raved about this dish at dinner, and again before bed. I loved how quick and easy this was. Perfect for a weekday dinner!
I eyeballed the quantity for most ingredients, so I can’t say I followed it exactly. I also added about 1/3 cup of cooking sherry (on a whim) because I wanted more sauce and didn’t want to add soy sauce and make it too salty.

It was too salty despite using low sodium soy sauce and a slightly less amount and too sweet despite using a bit less brown sugar. Disappointing. Won’t be making this one again.

Too salty for our taste even using low sodium soy sauce. So I cut the soy sauce in half......using 1/3 lite soy sauce mixed with 1/3 water. Then adding some dark Karo syrup as well. It was great.

Turned out delicious. Removed chicken from pan before stir frying broccoli like another reviewer suggested. Then returned chicken and added 2/3 c of soy sauce with 2/3 c of water. Not salty at all nor was it goopy. Added some oyster sauce and sunflower seed oil. Turned out perfect!!

Way too salty, and has too much soy sauce in general. It ended up being very sticky. I still ate it because I didn't want to waste it, but I would not make it again.

I made it almost exactly like the recipe except I used onion flakes because I didn't have a fresh onion. I also used coconut oil to stir fry it. I added the broccoli frozen earlier than suggested so it would cook throughly. Next time I will use 1/2 the recommended soy sauce and the rest will be water. It was a bit saltier than I like it. Honey loved it and said he would eat it again. Had it over minute rice.

Yes, it makes quite a bit of sauce. Since I'm feeding 2 teenage boys I simply double the amount of broccoli, which absorbs a lot of the sauce.
Always a favorite for my crew.

It was great even my picky husband liked it he even came back for seconds and he always has something to say. The only change I would make is next time use more ginger less sugar add garlic and I think that would make such a big difference. This time or used frozen broccoli I think next time our use fresh just for a little crunch.

My usual go to at the Chinese restaurant is chicken or shrimp and broccoli. I followed the recipe and from first bite to last it was delicious. Better than the Chinese restaurant and healthier as I know exactly what’s in it.

I made this the first time exactly like the recipe.  Came out perfect my family loved it. 
Second time I doubled all the ingredients. Instead of chicken I did beef and broccoli and add mixed frozen vegetables. Served over white rice. 
Fabulous. .

It was a big hit in my house. Everyone said it tasted better than the restaurant! I will definitely make it again. The only change I made was to double the recipe except for the soy sauce, I used half water because I don't like salty food. Then I added vermicelli rice noodles in half , the other half I served over rice.

Unfortunately, I didn’t read the reviews prior to making this. Those who said it was way too salty as writen, were right. I really wish people wouldn’t rate a recipe that they themselves have adjusted or changed. It skews the results of the ratings. I saw a high rating and chose this recipe. Again, my fault for not looking at all the reviews first and seeing that the higher ratings were on this recipe being changed.

Sauce was GROSS.  Sweet and gloppy, but also salty.  I think the proportions are all wrong in the recipe (e.g. you do not taste the ground ginger or red pepper at all.), but it wasn't good enough to play with.  SKIP.

Very salty.  I don't usually stock low sodium soy sauce but if I make this again, I certainly will buy some.  I made the mistake of using frozen broccoli and didn't have enough of it.  Otherwise, it wasn't too bad and I will try it again sometime with less salty soy and more but fresh broccoli.

Even the kids liked it.  Used less corn starch (1/2 tbsp) than the recipe calls for based on other reviews and that was a good move.  Will use low sodium soy sauce next time as it was quite salty but still good.  Will make again.

Second time making this with other reviewer's recs. Delish! I add garlic as we like garlic a lot in our house and fresh ginger. Only used 1/2 c reduced sodium soy sauce with 1/4 c brown sugar. Perfect. Will add this to our regular rotation.

I follow the recommendation for the soy sauce and it turns out great. Next time adding a bit more red pepper flakes and ginger.  I cook the chicken and onions in a bit of water. My kids loved it is a keeper for them!!!!!!

2/3 cup of full sodium soy sauce was way too much, my wife could taste nothing but salt and had me wash all the sauce off her dinner in the sink. After that she said it was ok.

I read the reviews of others saying how salty it came out so I decided to add one fourth of a cup of dark  brown sugar instead of 1/3. I just felt that was a little bit of sugar for such a large amount of soy sauce. It came out delicious will be making it again.

Very Very Good!!

I give it 4 stars bc I've read several reviews and the common denominator was too salty, so I was careful. I chose low sodium soy sauce, fresh ginger, added carrots and celery and only 1 teaspoon of cornstarch (cut down on next day goop). I believe that combo cut the salt WAY down.

The dish was fast and clean but most importantly DELISH! I served over rice.

I found this recipe very easy to make. I did make a couple of changes after reading many of the reviews  used to reduce the amount of soy sauce two 1/4 of a cup since I am on a low-salt diet. In hindsight, I should have also reduced the brown sugar because it came out a little sweet but was still very good. I also took advice from others to stir in the cornstarch slowly instead of adding all of the liquid at once. My husband and I both enjoyed this meal and served it with steamed rice. I will definitely make it again. Next time I plan to used low sodium soy sauce. It's a very easy and versatile recipe and I believe it will work with a wide variety of vegetables.

Consistency was good, but even with low sodium soy sauce, this came out too salty.

Great fun easy to make  I would cut the sugar down a bit or add more onions. It was a little too sweet at times.

For my first time making this dish it was pretty good. I didn't have enough soy sauce but used a little steak sauce, had fresh ginger instead of ground and it was Yummy!! My Hubby was impressed as I'm not much of a cooker.

This was exceptional!  I did use fresh ginger and garlic in the soy mixture as someone else had mentioned. I added the leftovers to some freshly steamed broccoli and it made a nice use of the extra sauce. This one is a definite keeper!

I used low sodium soy sauce.  Followed instructions exactly and this was so good.   However I did add a little water to sauce. Not salty either.  I will never buy stir fry sauce again.  This was the best.

Came out delicious. I substituted the brown sugar with hoisin sauce so it wouldn't be so sweet. I think it gave it more of a "oriental" taste than the brown sugar would. But delicious delicious delicious. My boyfriend ate is entire plate and my left over.

Followed directions(I added extra oil to sauce on accident, but didn't affect it too much! If anything it kept the chicken moist) Looks great! Tastes great!!!

This was a great base recipe. I would have followed it as written, however, I did not have enough broccoli on hand. I had plenty of red, yellow and orange peppers so I added some of those. I also added some matchstick carrots. The sauce is amazing as it is written. Next time I may add some water chestnuts, celery and maybe even some peanuts. Great recipe!! Thanks for sharing.

I made an account just to rate this, thats how bad it was. Absolutely inedibly salty, had to throw the whole thing away. Extremely disappointing, just stay away from this recipe if you don't want to throw food and money into the garbage.

This was very very good...tastes just like the local chinese restaurant.  Tried it also with shrimp, but did not quite have the same  result as with the chicken due to the amount of water that shrimp produces.  The broccoli became too soft and the gravy thinned out too much.  Next time I'll drain try draining the shrimp before adding the broccoli and sauce.

I will make again. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before hand. I also added about a teaspoon more of red pepper flakes to give it a little more of a kick.

This was just so delicious!  As good, if not better than restaurant quality!  I just made one minor change - I sprinkled the chicken with a very small amount of garlic powder before frying with the onions.  Highly recommend this dish! Thank you for sharing it!

Made this recipe as stated and it was really good. My only issue was it was a bit salty. Either use low sodium soy sauce (I used Braggs Liquid Aminos) . Quick and easy. Served over brown rice cooked quickly in my pressure cooker.

I really enjoy making this for my husband and I. It is really good by really really salty I made it as it says but at the end we added more brown sugar on top. It helped a lot :) so maybe 1/3 cup of brown sugar or even 1/2 cup. Hopes this helps ENJOY!! :)

Made this for dinner over some white rice and the hubby who loves Asian food loved it. The only change I made is I bought this garlic ginger stir fry paste and put that in instead of the ground ginger. And I didn't have a pan big enough so I cooked everything separate. Other than that it was good ????

Loved it! Easy and tasty!  I used 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce and added more water.  We like a lot of sauce so this works for us.  I also blanched the broccoli in a separate pot and added it at the end.  Also used 4 cloves of garlic and extra red pepper flakes because, we like it spicy. Enjoy!

Nice recipe, I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and reduced the soy sauce by half and increased the water to keep the volume of sauce. Thanks for posting

Beyond Salty. While the idea is good, maybe low sodium soy sauce is a better option.

Excellent! We use low sodium soy sauce so the salt level seemed fine. I added cashews with the broccoli. No leftovers - will definitely make this again!

I used low sodium  soy sauce , and fresh ginger and garlic .I also diluted the soy sauce mix with 2 teaspoons of water to ensure it wasn't too salty. It came out amazingly delicious.

I used half the sauce mixture, since I'm not a big soy sauce fan (mine was low sodium soy), half the onion, and extra broccoli. This was super simple to put together and tastes really good! Next time I would add some garlic when sautéing the broccoli for a little more flavor.

This is great except way too salty! I cut the soy sauce down to 1/3 cup and then put in 3 tbs of water, kept all other ingredients the same. Now it's become one of my kids' favorite meals!

Was very tasty and easy to make. The only changes we made were using low sodium soy sauce and 1/2 cup of it. We also had extra red bell pepper hanging around so we tossed that in also. The whole family liked it. Will make it again and maybe try with more mixed veggies.

Perfect recipe for someone who is gluten free and dairy free! I only used have the sauce recipe and added the same amount of garlic that I did ginger. The sauce turned out to be enough to cover veggies and chicken. Also I used an assortment of veggies that I had on hand, not just broccoli.

My first time making this recipe, but it won't be my last!  It was very easy to make, although I did use low sodium soy sauce and I added a little white cooking wine to the recipe.  It was very tasty and my husband raved about it.  This is going to be a frequent meal at our house.

Very good recipe.  Beats take-out.  I did make a few changes.  I added a teaspoon of minced garlic when sautéing the chicken and onions.  I used low sodium soy sauce since some reviewers mentioned that it was too salty.  I also added a little water to the sauce so it wouldn't be too thick.  Served it over rice.  I will definitely make this again.

Did not use that much sugar. I tripled the recipe so that would have brought the sugar to two cups. I used quinoa in place of rice for health benefits.

I made this and it's super easy. I used chicken thighs (bc that's what I had) and used broccoli, red onion and red peppers. I did the sauce part as indicated but used low sodium soy sauce....just personal prefrence. Served with rice.  I'll make this again for dinner.

Suggested modifications. Use low sodium soy sauce, reduce to ½ C., increase water to ? C. I also added a teaspoon of Sambal in place of the red pepper flake, that gave a real smooth spice, but not too hot. Other than the reduction in the salt, this was a very good/easy recipie.

This broccoli and chicken stir-fry was very impressive to me. I will make it again adjusting the sauce. There is just a little bit too much sauce for the chicken and vegetables.

I don't eat sugar so I wasn't sure how this would come out without it -- actually quite yummy! I used water instead of oil to cook the chicken in. It reduced down to barely any water, I removed the chicken poured about 1/2 cup of soy sauce in with another 1/4 cup of water.

Then I sprinkled ginger, onion powder, minced garlic, cayenne pepper and pepper flakes -- all to taste, but probably ended up about 1/2 teaspoon for everything but the cayenne and pepper flakes (just a few shakes of those). I mixed a little corn starch in, stirred, waited, then mixed a bit more and so on until it had the thickness I wanted (I left mine a bit on the watery side). 

I cut up the chicken, broccoli and onions and threw those in and mixed so they were all covered in sauce (ended up having to throw a bit more soy/water in). I covered and let simmer for about 5 minutes. 

For me this hit the spot. No need for oil or brown sugar. Loved it! And one of the best parts is that it only took about 15 minutes total. Next time I'll add snap peas and more onions (they end up having the texture of noodles).

This was a really good recipe and so easy. I added carrots to mine. Next time, I will add carrots, onions, broccoli, and chicken to the pan all at once. The onions got too cooked! Also, it was very salty even with low sodium soy sauce. I'm going to try again next time with 1/2 cup soy sauce and fill up to the 2/3 mark with water. But I will definitely make this again!!!

I made a couple of changes, but everyone loved this! I kept the real integrity of the dish poetry much the same except: 
I doubled everything for the "sauce" except the corn starch slurry, added some garlic because I'm a garlic nut, and a tablespoon of hoisin because I feel like it rounds out the flavor.  I use at least 2 pounds of chicken and a pound or more (probably go with more) of broccoli, and when I cook the chicken I toss the pieces I cut (bite sized) into a bag of corn starch and pan fry them coated.  I made noodles with it instead of rice because that's what the kids chose. 
Definitely keeping this around!

This was my best and favorite stir fry recipe..  Don't change a thing especially in regard to the sauce. The pepper flakes give it just enough of a lift that you will wonder what that spice was.  I have to double it every time (it can't fit into my wok) because the leftovers are the best for the next couple of lunches!

I agree with the post that this tasted like a dish right out of PFChangs! I only substituted one red, one orange and one green bell pepper for the broccoli (didnt have any) and turned out perfect!!!  This is my family's newest request now!  I had leftover brown rice and used it as a side for any extra sauce, it was a nice mix!

Definitely fast and easy to make. I made it a second time, but this time I added my personal flavors since I prefer spicy food and not so much soy sauce. Instead, I used 1/3 soy and 1/3 chicken broth. It was delicious, however, I think you should season the chicken prior to cooking with a little salt, pepper and cayenne. I don't like bland chicken.

I followed the recipe without looking at reviews. Big mistake!  People did not rate according to recipe, I'm thinking. 
This was very salty!!  Rinsing it wasn't the best idea but made it a bit more palatable. 
If there is a next time; I'd use low sodium soy sauce.  
I would not put broccoli in until the last 5 minutes or so.  Depending on size you cut the florets ; mine were 1 inch diameter on top.  The broccoli was cooked more than we like.

Turned out perfect, and I am a terrible cook. It was a little salty for my taste, but low sodium soy sauce is the solution. I recommend this easy recipe for a quick mid-week meal!

It was okay.  Tried it a couple of times.  2nd time without the  ginger and it was better.  A little more brown sugar also.  But it just wasn't right.  We ate it, but won't be making it again.

This recipe was great! I didn't have any brown sugar on hand so I used what I had (granulated white sugar - 3Tbs) and I added carrots.

 I would def want to maybe adjust the heat next time because some of the chicken did come out a little dry but overall, great recipe. You can taste the ginger. It's not too sweet. It'll def be hard to put your spoon down.

This is a great base recipe for stir fry sauce! I will not be buying premade sauce anymore! I used low sodium soy and only half a cup. Also only used half of the cornstarch slurry but that is a personal preference.

Like other reviewers said it is very salty. I didn't have any low sodium soy sauce so I used the regular. We like the sauce on our rice too. Usually we cook the rice, chicken and broccoli together and fix the sauce in a separate pan. I made double the recipe but think it was a little too much due to the saltiness. When we make again, I'll use low sodium soy sauce. I used freshly grated ginger instead of ginger powder. I didn't have any pepper flakes so I omitted them. I made double the slurry to thicken the sauce but only used half of it and it was the perfect thickness. I also added a couple cans of sliced mushrooms. I can think of other stir fries that I will be using this basic sauce in. So many options!!!

I liked this a lot! Mine ended up with more chicken/less broccoli than I wanted, but I also didn't measure so that could easily be my bad. I also used about 1/4 cup sherry & 1/4 cup less soy sauce since I have Kikoman and they are on the salty side. Will absolutely make this again!

After reading other reviews concerning the salty flavor, I opted to use low sodium soy sauce instead.  It was the only change made, and the meal was still salty in flavor.   If I decide to make it again, I will add a bit more brown sugar to counter the salt flavor.  Oh, and I did drizzle sesame seeds over the top as a garnish before serving on a bed of  white rice.
On a positive note, the dish was rather simple  to make and put together quickly.  The directions were easy to understand and follow.

Solid dish. Tasty and quick for a week night dinner. I used less corn starch, more veggies (frozen) and that made the salt level just right. Topped with sesame seeds. Yummy!

Word of warning : check how much salt is in your soy sauce. I used Kikoman and found that it needed a lot more sugar to balance out the extra sodium. Luckily I checked first, and it turned out wonderfully! Definitely a keeper

I actually had all these ingredients in the house! It was delicious. Plenty of sauce, maybe actually too much. I added white wine in place of 1/3 cup of the soy sauce, because I didn't want it to taste too salty. it wasn't.

This was so easy, and SO SO GOOD! I can't wait till the hubby tastes it. He is going to enjoy a nice change from the regular menu, especially since it's so delicious! Nope. Not take out. Momma made it! Thanks for the great recipe. :)

Great recipe with few simple ingredients! After reading reviews, I substituted Braggs soy sauce. I highly recommend, for those who are afraid of too salty of a flavor.

This turned out great, I did add a few things that I like in my food such as garlic and hot sauce. I didn't use as much soya sauce and added some more water. The flavours were great and I was glad to not use a pre made sauce and make my own! Will make this again!

We Loved this and have several times a week over Rice! I boil my Chicken a few hours ahead of time (Thighs) or breasts and it goes even faster when you make it! We also buy the Frozen stir fry Veggies but there never seems to be enough Broccoli in the packages so you can add more fresh veggies to your own liking! I LOVE the fact I don't have to have a Bottle of ready made stir fry sauce in the house-only LOW SODIUM SOY SAUCE & Brown sugar!! Also am using this opportunity to say I never use cook books any longer! Only AllRecipes.com and their Magazine subscription! THE BEST! Also,  Thank You, Jeri ,for sharing this one with us!

After reading reviews, I reduced the amount of low sodium soy sauce. Omitted onions and added snow pea pods and tiny carrots for crunch. Water chestnuts or bamboo shoots would be good. Sauce consistency is perfect.

yummy yummy. I love this recipe. this is the first time I made stir-fry successfully.  my family loves it. 
I added some frozen veggies cos I just love veggies. 
Also I added more spice and some lemons juice because it was too sweet for my taste.
New addition to my weekly dinner menu.

This was delicious - subbed grated ginger and added garlic and a little bit of sesame oil.  I took the advice of some reviewers who thought it was too salty, and subbed water for a third of the soy sauce.  I would prefer to use low sodium soy sauce, but didn't have any on hand.  Very easy and tasty, will definitely make again!

I added 4 cloves of mince garlic 2 tbls rice vinegar and 1 tbls of flour to the sauce. Makes the sauce a Lil authentic.  Mix the sauce casually with the chicken,  onions and broccoli.  Medium heat for 7 minutes or until brown.

This was great! I followed recipe exact except I used less soy sauce called for since other reviewers complained of it being salty. And used more brown sugar. Also I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I made this with rice. Great meal!

I used low-sodium soy sauce and the dish still came out very salty. The sauce wasn't good and it was just too much sauce. The worst part was the amount of ground ginger you had to use. I would use less ground ginger next time (1/4 tsp)  or use fresh ginger instead. I couldn't finish my meal because of the strong ginger taste.

Quick, easy, delicious. Tastes way better than takeout. Since I didn't have low sodium soy sauce like others have suggested, I added more brown sugar and a little bit of water to cut the salt.

Great flavor and easy! I used vegetables I just had in my fridge and it was still great. A little salty, so would suggest low-sodium soy sauce.

This is a good base recipe but I'm not sure if it was the kind of soy sauce I used, but it was super salty!! Good thing I didn't follow the directions and cooked the sauce in a separate pan first so I could taste it. I probably added a cup of water. I also used fresh ginger and a bit of sesame oil.. In the end, in turned out great!

I made this. I didn't have enough soy sauce only about 1/2 cup and replaced the rest with water. It was still quite salty. I also used flour instead of corn starch which seemed fine. Additionally I added 3tblspoons of maple syrup. It was yummy .

A delicious quick and easy stir fry. I added a couple of cloves of garlic and halved the recipe as I only had one large Chicken breast and it came out amazing. The sauce was the perfect consistency and was sweet and spicy. Will definitely be adding to the rotation.

I used a cauliflower/carrot/broccoli mix, and used sesame oil to stir fry. I agree with the others..I will need to use low sodium soy sauce. Saltiness is not the author's fault, just personal taste; but other than that, I chose this one over all the others, and glad I did!

Easy, tasty, and economical to make.  I love that it has all the ingredients I usually stock in the house.  I recommend adding a bell pepper to pan with the broccoli step.

Absolutely loved it!! I added more vegetables, and didn't think there would be enough sauce (we like extra for the rice) so I added another 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1 T more of brown sugar (total soy sauce was 1/2 c regular and 1/4 dark) and about an extra 1/2 - 1 cup water didn't measure just poured it in the pot.  Sooooooo good!! I make a lot of stuff from allrecipes and although most things are really good, there is rarely anything that inspires me to post a review like this one!!!

Will make this again!  Great flavor... we like a little spicy so added extra pepper flakes.  Thought I would have to make more sauce but ended up being the perfect amount (it thinned out when added to the chicken and broccoli).  Everyone loved it!  

As for the comments on saltiness, we used low sodium soy sauce.

Used Low Sodium Soy sauce, was still very salty. Added cauliflower and carrots diced. Next time I'll add more veggies to spread the sauce further.

OMG! Easiest and tastiest stir fry ever!!!! The whole family loved it. The sauce is just right. My tweaks: used frozen sweet peppers and onions. used a little less soy sauce and a wee-bit more brown sugar. But recipe is a keeper either way.

I found it easy and delicious. It is, however, a bit salty. After reading several reviews, I tried low sodium soy sauce and substituted some of the soy sauce with a little water.  I also used fresh ginger and added garlic. Very pleased with this recipe.

I thought this was so very good - I used low sodium soy sauce. I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger.  I was nervous as I don't know how to cook.  Might try the 1/2 tsp next time in addition to putting more broccoli in - I Loved it!!

My first stir fry I made. Other than it being too salty, next time I'll use reduced sodium soy sauce, it was wonderful! I'll make it again for sure!! My boyfriend thought it was perfect and he's a wonderful cook!

This is definitely a good easy recipe. The only thing I altered is adding  more veggies for color and taste- carrots, more bell peppers and mushrooms. I used basically what I had on hand. I do agree with other reviewers it is a bit salty and I like salt. Will get some reduced sodium soy sauce next time I make this. I think the amount of sauce was perfect for my extra I added into the skillet. I served over white rice. My days of ordering Chinese take out is over.

I thought the flavors were great, but it was a tad too salty. I added a bunch of red pepper, cabbage and snap peas to the mix and there was just the right amount of sauce

My husband and three year old enjoyed this as a lunch special. I think without the ginger, the recipe still turned out great. Instead of using 2/3 cups of soy sauce, I used 1/3 cup. And it worked well. Thanks for the recipe!

I read some of the reviews about it being salty so I used low sodium soy sauce and only 1/3C.  Next time I'll use the 2/3C low sodium soy sauce.  Also I added the little corns because we love them.  My family loved this!!!!

Upon advise from others, I used 1/3 cup of soy sauce and 1/3 cup of water, in addition to stated 2 tablespoons of water.  One addition of mine was a large, slice orange pepper.  Following the last step, I turned up the heat to almost boiling and cooked 5 minutes. It turned out perfect, not soupy at all. I will assuredly cook this again.

I made this stir fry and my boyfriend loved it! I added and cooked it a little differently. I added 1 chopped red pepper, 1 chopped green pepper, some raw baby carrots, and some snap peas along with the broccoli and onion already mentioned in the original recipe. I cooked the chicken first like it called for, then removed it completely from the pan. Next I cooked all my vegetables together for about 7 minutes; once the onions got brown on the edges I then poured the soy sauce mixture in and then the starch mixture in. I then took my cooked chicken (I shredded it into pieces), put it over the vegetables and mixed it all together. Finally I turned off the heat and let it cool for about 10 minutes, this allows the sauce to thicken. 

Adding all the extra veggies allowed the sauce to spread better and not be so soupy as mentioned by others. It was a tad salty, but soy sauce is naturally extremely high in sodium. I will try it with sodium free soy sauce next time. But over all a very quick and delicious dish.

I used low sodium soy sauce and didn't find this too salty at all.  this was so easy and delicious I could probably eat it three times a week and not get tired of it.  Next time I make it I am going to try it with the same amount of sauce, but add shredded carrots and chopped water chestnuts in with the broccoli as well.  would also make an excellent beef and broccoli.

This was absolutely delicious. The entire family loved it.  The only thing different I did was to use what veggies I had on hand - sliced fresh brussel sprouts, peppers, and squash. I also used lower sodium soy sauce. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Like everyone else is saying, it is a bit too salty. Now that being said, it still had great flavor. Very easy and quick to make. My children have already asked that I make this every week. Next time I'll just cut down on the soy sauce and add a bit more water.

This was probably the best stir fry I have ever made!! Super easy to make and delicious! I added zucchini, onions and garlic to mine and  used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I really like the flavor it adds to stir fry dishes! I also only used 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce and 1/3 cup beef broth to cut back on the salt. Will definitely be making this again!!

I made this using low sodium soy sauce and a little less than 2 tblsp to cut back on saltiness other people mentioned. I also added in carrots and snow peas and used left over chicken from a whole chicken. served it over basmati rice and was very yummy.

Really liked it. Even my husband ate it all. Only had reduced sodium soy sauce so it wasn't too salty. Planning on making it again soon.

Recipe was easy to make super quick and delucious!!! I read other reviews and the only tweaks I made was using fresh ginger and garlic  and less soy sauce so that it wouldn't be salty.   Its delicious just like take out but better!

Made it as described but with some minced garlic instead of the onion and low-sodium soy sauce. It was still WAY too salty for me, I will replace half the soy sauce with water next time. Otherwise a great alternative to Chinese food take-out!

I think this recipe would be very good as written, but the great thing about stir fry is being able to change ingredients based on what you have on hand.  I replaced some of the broccoli with strips of orange and yellow pepper.  I added a clove of minced garlic to the sauce, and I added some chopped cilantro after I was done cooking.  It turned out great and was very easy to make.
