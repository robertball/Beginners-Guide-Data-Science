This is a really good BBQ sauce. I didn't have chili sauce... that was fine.  I used korean bulgolgi BBQ sauce... added a bit of chipotle tobasco... overall, you can mix/match/substitute on this recipie & it's still EXCELLENT!! I WILL DEFINATELY USE THIS AGAIN!

A bit to much vinegar, but still a very good taste.

Great sauce! I opted to leave out the soy sauce. I think next time I will add it, to see how that tastes.

It seems like an awful lot of liquid; I'm leary of trying this as it makes 3 quarts and do I store it in the fridge??  The recipe says to mix in the garlic just before using, but what about the loads leftover?
