Way too much stuff for pumpkin seeds.  Not a good flavor combo in my opinion.

This review is about the cooking method not the recipe… I was wanting to make pumpkin seeds but didn’t know how to roast them and there are so many different recipes with different times and temperatures that it can be a little overwhelming! We carved several pumpkins this year so I had plenty of seeds to play with so I split them up to try some different cooking methods. I tried this one first because it didn’t require soaking or drying and it wasn’t going to take an hour. After I made these and tasted one I decided not to even waste my time trying the other cooking methods these came out perfect! Thanks for sharing your cooking method!

Taste excatly like what it should.  I made a triple batch and so since spicy seasonings can get pretty intense if there is too much i reduced the amounts by halfx3.  Came out great.  My kids love it.

Just enough spice to warm the cauldrons of your soul and keep the goblins away but not enough to scare away the ghost in you. Smoky, spicy goodness.
