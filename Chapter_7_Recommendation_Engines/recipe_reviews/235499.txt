I made this tonight and did not have egg bread so I used the french bread I had.  I also mashed the bananas and added them to the wet mix instead of slicing them as it spreads the banana flavor more evenly in my opinion.  I also made a caramel sauce to go on top with 2/3 cup caramel ice cream topping, 3 tablespoons heavy cream and 3 tablespoons brandy (you can use rum too) and cooking it for just a few minutes on the stove. It was a great bread pudding but the banana flavor was too light.  I may add another banana next time to boost it. As far as the bread pudding though it was smooth and creamy with a nice crust. I am giving 5 stars because I am not sure if maybe the french bread changed the depth of the banana flavor versus using the egg bread and this was great.  My husband almost licked the plate clean!
