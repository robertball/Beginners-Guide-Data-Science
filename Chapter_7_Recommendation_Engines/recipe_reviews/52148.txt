This is sooooo goood! - and much easier than making eggplant parmesan!!! I did not add the bread crumbs to the mixture. I added a chopped red pepper and a drained can of seasoned chopped tomatoes. I took the advice of others - and microwaved the eggplant shells for about 8 minutes, then stuffed it, poured some marinara sauce on top, baked it for about 1/2 hour, then sprinkled some mozzerella cheese on top, and put it back in the oven for a minute - until the cheese was all melted (and not hard and crusty!). SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!!!

My five-year-old told me this was the most delicious supper I made this month.  I skipped the "stuffing" part and just put this in a casserole dish.  I added hot sausage, mushrooms, lots more oregano, some Italian seasoning, lots more parsley, and oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs (wheat allergies).  I covered with spaghetti sauce and parmesan cheese.  So good!  Thank you for a great idea!

My husband and I loved this.  A few changes.  We added yellow and orange pepper and some mushrooms to the recipe and much less breadcrumbs (didn’t want it too mushy).  Also used spaghetti sauce in lieu of tomato sauce and upped the cheese with Monterey Jack and Cheddar.  Great base recipe though and we will definitely be having this again.  Very hearty.

I can't really fault the flavors here - very tasty! - but I'm not so sure about the presentation.  I think I'm with the reviewer who suggested using this method as a casserole instead; my eggplant "shells" were only edible on the bottom even though I covered it with foil.  Maybe I should have used more sauce, but next time I think I'll just chop the entire eggplant and follow the recipe from there without stuffing - less waste that way.  Still, a great idea!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I love eggplant and was looking for something easier to make than eggplant parmesan. 

I didn't think my 2-year-old would like it but he called it "pizza" and ate it up. Even DH liked he's not a big fan of eggplant.

The only thing I changed was cooking it with foil wrapped around the baking dish. This made the eggplant more tender and easier to eat.

Thanks for the tasty, easy-to-prepare recipe!

I left out the bread crumbs, made homemade tomato sauce beforehand, and added lots of mushrooms to the recipe (personal preference).

Overall, this dish was delicious, though it took more than a half hour to bake - more along the lines of 45-50 minutes.

I was happy with this recipe.  My boyfriend likes an eggplant dish so much at one of our local restaurants but said that everytime he tried to make it it turned out terrible. I have never really had it but decided to try it.  I salted the eggplant and left it for 1/2 an hour before squeezing out some liquid.  I think this helped a lot as it made it meatier rather then mushier.  I also added three small breakfast sausages in with the eggplant which added a TON of great flavour, and doubled the garlic. My boyfriend was very happy with the result and is not longer scared of eggplant recipes!

Are you supposed to eat the shell that holds all the stuffing?  Mine was too tough so we just ate the filling.  I also added some frozen okra I had left over.  Instead of plain tomato sauce I used a spicy spaghetti sauce. Overall I will probably make again whenever eggplant is on sale.

I did make a few changes: I added 1/4 cup of chopped parsley, 1/4 cup of Italian cheese mixture, some extra chopped garlic, some dried crushed chilies, and about an ounce of spicy sausage to the stuffing mixture - we like lots of flavor! Topped it with canned diced Italian tomatoes and cheddar cheese. It turned out really, really good!

I have never liked eggplant, but thought I would try it one more time.  This is fantastic ,  I loved it.  I just ate the insides and was well satified.    Great.  A must try.

Made as written and it was just OK.  The filling was a little bland -- could have used some salt.  Also, the eggplant and onion mixture needs to be cooked thoroughly in the pan.  They didn't finish in the oven the way I expected them to.  Not sure I will make again.

I loved this recipe. I found it useful to microwave the halves first to help soften them. Just putting them in the oven left them way too hard. Then I let them drain on papertowels to help get rid of moisture. Dabbing them as much as possible is also helpful. When they bake, they release a lot of water which can make the entire dish very watery and soggy, hard to get out so try to drain as much as possibe. I put Monguni's spagetti sauce (don't put a lot)on mine and fresh mozzerella. Turned out wonderful!!

This recipe is amazing! My husband and I had never cooked eggplant at home, I'm so glad we found this recipe for our first try. It was easy and delicious. We made it for the first time two weeks ago and loved it so much that we made it again last night. This time we added a little bit of chopped mushrooms. Excellent!

Very good! I did microwave the eggplant first to make it easier to scrape the centers out. I added chopped mushrooms and green pepper to the eggplant mixture. Used leftover pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce. Thanks :)

Oh my oh my, this was delicious.  I've never made eggplant before and this was so easy and better than what Ive had at restaurants.  I microwaved my eggplants for 5 minutes before cutting them open to make the scooping easier.  I sauteed 1lb of Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey with my onion and garlic until brown, and then cooked in my eggplant until it was soft.  My cousin was over for dinner and insisted on having the recipe to take with him.  This will be going on my rotation! Delicious and healthy.

It was really good! I made a couple of changes Because I didn´t have any tomato sauce I used a jar of whole tomatoes. There was enough sauce inside and the whole tomatoes gave extra flavor. It took around 50 min baking time instead of 30.

This was easy and very tasty. I added mushrooms and omitted the mozzarella cheese, just added more parmesan (soft kind so it melted) served it over some rigatoni.

We have a garden this year and my husband insisted on growing eggplant.  So today I found myself with 4 eggplants and clueless!!  This recipe was incredible!!!  I took everyone's advice and microwaved the shells for 8 minutes.  I added shredded carrots, a chili pepper, mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and garlic and omitted the bread crumbs completely. My neighbors came over for the experiment and they all loved it!!

Very yummy! I only had 1 eggplant, so I added 1/4 cup red bell pepper, 1/4 cup green bell pepper, and 1 diced tomato, which was a delicious addition! I also opened the casing to turkey sausage, browned it, and added it to the stuffing, but would not recommend adding any meat, or else it will compete with the other flavors. I didn't have tomato sauce or mozzarella cheese, so I used spaghetti sauce & cheddar cheese, which I also don't recommend. I would cut down on the Parmesan cheese a bit and make sure to use freshly grated, rather than packaged. I had to add 10 minutes to the cooking time, which probably varies depending on the oven & elevation. All the produce I used was locally grown, which made this meal extra yummy! Fairly quick and very easy!

This was wonderful!  My husband loves stuffed eggplant parmesan and I wanted to give it a try and I am so grateful for this recipe!  Always remember to check your eggplants for bruises prior to purchasing.  We enjoyed this recipe so much!

Really good!  I peeled and diced the eggplant and made into a casserole instead of stuffing, but besides that followed the recipe.  I used Spaghetti Sauce Mix from this site as the tomato sauce.  My entire family loved it and we will definitely be making again soon!

This recipe was good and a bit easier than eggplant parmesan. The preparation was simple, but I found that I had too much bread crumb/parmesan mixture next time I will make 1/2. For the tomato sauce I used one can of sauce and one can of paste to cut down on the sodium, at first I thought I had too much but when it was cooked it was just fine. I also added 2 sausages, it was very good, without the extra filling I don't think the eggplant mixture would have been enough to stuff four shells. It ended up being in the oven for 45 minutes and the shells were soft enough to eat. Served with couscous.

We enjoyed this...I added green peppers and italian seasoning and poured the sauce around the eggplants instead of over to avoid any mushiness. Mixed the parmesan in with the breadcrumbs and added the mozzarella with about 10 minutes left. I'll definitely be making again.

The receipe was amazing! I also made it for my Mom who had never had eggplant (and she didn't think she would) and she LOVED it.  Very wholesome..and if you are watching what you eat, this certainly makes you feel like you are cheating- but @ about 370 cal each, 1 of them is PLENTY to fill you up! We had one each (so we only made 2 servings) and served it with a side salad of mostly green veggies.. it was amazing.
I did not change the recipe at all.  It seemed like a ton of bread crumbs when I was adding them, but did not seem that way at all once cooked.
You can skip the Parsley though- it is just for garnish mainly and I bought a huge pakc of it (only way it's sold at my local grocery) for 1 teaspoon.  
I used fresh parmesan cheese.  We plan to make this for dinner again, and again, and again!

What an easy and delicious recipe! It tasted like something you would get a restaurant, it was fairly healthy, and filling! The only thing I will change next time is microwaving the eggplant shells beforehand to make them a little more tender.

This is such a great basic recipe that you can add anything too!  I added chopped mushrooms and red bell peppers.  I also am not a huge fan of dried oregano so I used fresh.  Very good..thanks!

This is delicious and hearty.  You don't even notice there is no meat in the dish.  I did add half a diced red pepper into the mix which made it perfect.

This is a nice change from the regular Egglant Parm.  I added sausage to mine, which made it a little heartier.

It was pretty good. My family did not love it. I tried to make the appearance to be as appetizing as possible, but it was still questionable. The taste was great though. I am questioning whether I would ever make this dish again.

Excellent, and easy!  I definitely will make this again.  Small changes I made: salted both the shell and the chopped eggplant, then squeezed out the liquid, and added fresh mushrooms.  Oh, yeah!  I had lovely brown stuff on the bottom of the pan after sauteeing the veggies, so I deglazed with a bito of white wine, then poured the yummy stuff over the stuffed eggplant before the breadcrumbs, etc.  My hubby was pleasantly surprised!

This recipe was delicious.  I added extra garlic, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  The only problem I found was that the eggplant shells were never tender enough to eat, but everyone was happy just to eat the inside mixture with garlic bread, and it was fantastic!

This is awesome! I'm on a higher protein, controlled carb nutritional plan, so I'm always looking for recipies that everyone likes but that I can enjoy too. I've modified this just slightly, by skipping the bread crumbs and adding ground beef to the mixture to be browned and stirring in cottage cheese before stuffing the eggplant shells. More protein, less carbs!

My husband is not the biggest fan of eggplant, but he tried this and LOVED it.  very good and very easy to fix on a night when you don't want to stand in the kitchen for an hour.  I added a little turkey sausage to the eggplant mixture in the skillet to increase the flavor.  Very good!  Will make again.

I can't describe the taste.  I usually really like eggplant recipes and this one didn't do it for me.  My parents said they ate it and it was OKAY but none of my children or husband could eat eat.  Sorry.

* sauteed 1/2 onion and 2 cloves garlic, then added chopped chicken and a little chopped green onion, salt and pepper
* did not use oregeno
* salted eggplant shells for 40 minutes and patted up moisture
* mixed parmesan, breadcrumbs, and dried parsley (reduced breadcrumbs to 1/4 cup)
* cooked for 50 minutes
* order of toppings is awkward... try cheese, then hummus, then breadcrumbs, then parsley.
* flavors just kind of melt together into a generic thing, so don't worry if you're missing a few things.

While I often experiment, I followed this recipe almost exactly.  My only change was to dice up three small zucchini that I needed to use and tossed them in the pan. And used some creamy parmesan pasta sauce, not  just plain tomato sauce.

The zucchini came out a bit crunchy, and the flavor was great.

Being a bit more stuffed,  I baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes.

We ( hubby & 5 boys) enjoyed this recipe but did take the suggestions of others to microwave the eggplant before scooping it out. I cut them in half first and zapped for 3 minutes.  I thought 8 to 10 minutes as suggested seemed too long. I was wrong. I zapped an additional 4 minutes and next time will go for the full 10 minutes; otherwise the eggplant is too rubbery if you want to eat the whole thing.  Used real parmesan cheese and mozzarella and also added a diced orange pepper.   I also added diced sausage for my meat eaters but I thought it was great without and don't think I'll add it at all next time.  Thanks!

I give it a five because my GF loved it.  I added a little basil, crushed red pepper and homemade Porcini Italian sausage.  Baked it for an hour.  I covered it with foil for the first 45 minutes and left it open the last 15.  I also pre-microwaved the shells and sweated the filling with salt.

I added a cup of sliced mushrooms & squash sauteed with the mixture and mixed fire roasted diced tomatoes with the tomato sauce that I drizzled on top. After it was done I put a tad of green Chile on top to give it spice and  that makes this stuff burst with flavor...great recipe!!!!!

Unbelivably Good. An oral orgasm of flavor and texture. Creating your own tomato sauces just explodes this into another realm. I used a sun dried tomato and fire roasted peppers sauce for mine, and used the Prego brand italian bread crumbs.

Tried this recipe last night and it was excellent.  Added chopped mushrooms to the eggplant.  I rubbed a little olive oil on the outside of the skins and they came out tender and moist.  I would recommend this recipe to my friends and family

So much easier, and healthier that the typical eggplant parm!  The hubby loved it too.  We didn't eat the skin, and I added extra garlic and some orange bell peppers. Other than that, I followed recipe exactly.  It also makes a great presentation!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I will make again!

This was great... I made a few subs...
Instead of mozz cheese I used shredded provolone which added some sharp, great flavor!  I also cooked longer to make the shells tender and tasting great.  I also added some ground turkey and spinach to the mix.  Awesome!!   By the way...I didn't even use the bread crumbs and it was still awesome!

This is a good recipe for eggplant, the eggplant shell was a litte rubbery.  I will have to work on that.  I also used ground turkey, peppers, and mushrooms in mine.

I found this to be pretty good, even for some family members who don't generally like eggplant. The only thing I changed was to salt the eggplant before cooking it in the pan, in order to reduce any bitter flavors and make the eggplant more tender.

This was AWESOME.
I decided to surprise my boyfriend with a fancy homemade dinner, and this was the main course.  he ate all of it and loved it, and so did I.
The directions were easy to follow, it was easy to make, and the ingredients aren't too hard to find.  Overall, it's definitely worth trying.

Really just not a wow-er. In fact, the eggplant never seemed to get done. I will stick to regular eggplant parmesan.

added egg to the mix before putting it back into the shell.  Used lots of hot marinara to stew the shells while they bake in the oven--delicious

I don't like to modify recipes the first time I make them but I made a mistake & only had sharp cheddar cheese so I used that.  I also used some bulk hot Italian sausage to give it some oomph.  The sausage wasn't a great idea because it was tough.

Overall this was a good recipe, but a bit more time consuming than I like.  It tasted really good after I picked the sausage out!  There was a bit of sausage flavor left though, which I liked.  The eggplant (and skins) were nice & soft.  I enjoyed eating the skins!

Not sure if I will make again, but will keep it in my saved recipes, just the same.

I had 2 smaller eggplants and put them in the microwave before cutting to soften.  I would suggest only 3 minutes, then check before going a full 5 minutes.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used romano cheese and cheddar cheese flavored crackers that I crushed.  Added red bell pepper, Italian seasoning and used jarred spaghetti sauce.  Delicious and easy!!!

I made this on Friday night and it came out pretty good. I only made half of it and had no problems making it.  I only used minced onions as my only alteration.  I would love to make it again.

Came out great with a few changes. I used Muenster Cheese since I was out of Mozzarella. Added a little sweet Paprika on the top for color.  Added fresh Red Peppers from the garden but they were a little difficult to grill. Took about 10 minutes. Added a layer of mushroom slices and fresh smashed cherry tomatoes from the garden. Results were fantastic. A relatively low cost healthy meal. Have enough left overs for lunch tomorrow!

I made this exactly like the recipe stated but found the eggplant "shell" too hard to eat?  Are you supposed to cook/bake this ahead of time before you put the "stuffing" in?  We couldn't eat the shell.  Next time, I will bake the shell first to get it softer and more done then add the filling, sauce and cheese and put back in the oven to finish baking.  Overall, the taste was really good.

Followed the recipe.  Just didn't taste anywhere near the scrumptious  flavor of the eggplant parm at our favorite restaurant.  I am so eager to find an easy recipe I can prepare at home.  But this is not it.  We could not eat more than a few bites, then we discarded the rest.  Seemed unusually bitter.  I am not very familiar with cooking with eggplant, so perhaps the eggplant was bitter.  I will keep searching.

I made the dish exactly as written and it was wonderful.  I loved not having to salt eggplant slices and being able to avoid frying.  It had a full, rich taste, so much that I didn’t miss having any meat or poultry.  I will definitely make this again.

I might try fresh tomatoes in place of sauce, just a personal preference.  Definitely a keeper,

This was really good. I halved the bread crumbs because it looked like way too much when there were half of a cup. I would also not put them in the “boats” again. I would make it like a casserole and peel the eggplant. Still, it was really good.

Not what I was expecting. Needs tons more cheese, more seasoning and a LOT more cooking time! I read the reviews and started baking it early. After an hour and forty minutes the eggplant was not pierceable with a fork!! I took it from the oven and microwaved it for 15 minutes, then put it back in the oven.

Hint #1 Slice the eggplant in half and cook on a lightly oiled baking sheet cut side down for 15-20 minutes to precook the eggplant and make it easier to scoop out the pulp.
Hint#2 Add some basil chopped to the mixture along with the Italian seasonings.
Hint#3  Put the tomato sauce over the mozzarella so it is gooey, not crispy.
I omitted the breadcrumbs.

It tasted great. Made one change and added some sweet peppers and a second type of cheese that I needed to use up out of the fridge. My only complaint with this recipe is I think is the temperature of the oven. You either have to cook your eggplant for a longer period of time in the pan until it is soft or raise the oven temperature. I followed the recipe exactly and after 30 minutes my eggplant was not near done and still hard. After looking at a pile of other recipes I noted that they all required the oven temperature to be 375. That seemed more reasonable.

I have been making this for a while. Adding in the hot Italian sausage meet gives it a little bit of spice. I also put in mozzarella cheese and parmesean into the mix. I did not boil the eggplant first, so gives it a little more toughness as opposed to nuking it. My neighbors love it. Everyone loves it except my wife who does not care for eggplant. Her loss. Have not tried with mushrooms, but will add that in today. I was also thinking of adding Feta cheese to the mix and maybe a little bit of spinach.

I microwaved for 3 min. as others suggested but found that it made my eggplant mushy. I think it was because mine were the globe type fresh out of my garden. Next time, I'll not do this. I cut down on the sauce but added three Roma tomatoes (chopped) to the mix. It was a little bland so when I try it again (I have more eggplants on the way) I'll add a little Italian sausage and/or more spices.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, except I used dried parsley instead of fresh b/c that's what I had on hand.  It came out delicious!  Even my husband, who usually doesn't like meatless meals, had 3 servings.  Thanks for a yummy vegetarian dish!  :)

This was good; I just haven't ever had eggplant before and used this recipe to try it out.  I drew the conclusion that I just need to get used to the taste of eggplant ;) I salted it, as suggested, for a long time (about 45 mins) but it was still pretty bitter.  I used plenty of salt but maybe I just needed to use more.  As well, I disliked the pasta sauce I used so that really contributed to my distaste.  But, honestly, I will probably make this again, but with a pasta sauce that I enjoy.

We loved this recipe!! I had never cooked eggplant before and this was a great starter recipe. The only thing my husband asked me to do is to add meat, so next time I'm going to try adding some italian sausage, but I personally think it's perfect as is.

Good but not amazing. Would prefer the breadcrumbs on top of the cheese so they go crispy. My toddler loved it though.

My son and I made this last night. It was fabulous. My husband loved it and he, like most guys, is a tough food critic. We used eggplants fresh from our garden and the taste was almost like it had sausage in it; I don't think store bought would yield the same taste and won't even consider it. We'll make this one again as soon as more are ready in the garden. Thank you for sharing this one!

I added and additonal 2 garlic gloves season with garlic powder, onion powder little cooking wine for more flavor. I used seasoned bread crumbs but I think the sauce takes most of the good flavor away.  Next time I'll take it easy on the sauce.

I loved this recipe. It was very tasty. I think it could be kid friendly as well if you serve it outside the shell. I will definatly be making this again. Very low cal as well. I served mine with an artichoke with a little garlic butter (non fat of course)

Pretty good.  I think that next time I will just make the filling as a casserole rather than put it back in the shells.

Really good! Husband loved it and asks for it often. The easy way to hollow out the eggplant was with a melon baller..MUCH easier than with a spoon or knife.
Followed recipes pretty much exact except I put bread crumbs on top. Then when done, I put some warmed marinara on top.

Too much work to hollow out and chop, I think next time I may just peel and slice!

I was really disappointed with this.  After seeing so many positive reviews, I was excited to try this.  My kids refused to eat it, I thought it was too bland, but my husband thought it was pretty good.  I won't make this again.
