Finally...a quick,easy and lovely Sponge Cake!  Carol, Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I have been looking for a good recipe that doesn't require the separation of eggs. Instinct told me this one would work, and it did beautifully.
For a plain sponge, replace the lemon exract with vanilla.

If you are looking for a nice spongy cake, this is not it.  I followed the recipe to a T and I did not care for this.  Very disappointed.

This is the first sponge cake I have cooked that has not been a packet mix. It was easy and turned out great, nice and light, moist and tasted fantastic. I sliced it in half and served it with cream and jam in the middle I will be cooking more of my own cakes in future, as it is not as difficult or time comsuming as I imagined. The only thing I did differently with this recipe was I beat the egg yolks and white separately and folded into mixture. Thankyou Carol for inspiring the home baker in me.

This turned out quite good.I only cooked it for 35 minutes and it perfect then.I can imagine what it would have been like if I kept it in for the time stated in the recipe.Also the recipe never said what size of pan to use so I used my 8" square,it was the right size.The only thing I didn't like about this is that it stuck to the pan,next time I'll grease and flour the pan.

I found the length of time in the oven way too long. I could see the cake was dried out when I pulled it out.  I think I'd try 30-35 minutes next time.

Very good recipe!!
The cake is moist and looked great (i used 4 eggs) although a bit too sweet for my taste (maybe coz i didn't use the lemon juice - i used raspberry extract instead, so there's no sourness to balance the sugar).
And i did separate the whites and the yolk like the other reviewer said and i greased the pan with butter.
It worked wonders..

I made a plain sponge using vanilla instead, tasted quite normal to me. Nice coloring though, was a bit dense, so adding another egg or beating it a little longer should help.

This is a really easy recipe to do especially for beginner's like me!! This turned out wonderfully compared to others I have tried.  I too also substituted lemon extract for vanilla, added fresh blueberries and chopped pecans.  I also wanted to cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup and it still tasted great!!  But it may not be sweet enough for others, but I thought the vanilla was enough for me.  Served it with a spoonful of vanilla yogurt and strawberries, whole fam enjoyed it too.  Thanks for sharing!!

It was easy to make and I enjoyed the flavour.  Mine was overdone at 55 minutes so next time I'll bake it for 45 minutes.  It's terrific with vanilla ice cream and the Supreme Strawberry Sauce on this site.

This cake turned out great. It was a little chewy, but that was to be expected because of the lack of butter. I am using this cake for a wedding cake, it is going to be perfect.

This turned out fantastic. I decided for this recipe because it doesn't use butter and it was so tasty and light. I topped it with meringue icing and it was superb.

We found it chewy and rather tasteless.  I followed some others advice and baked it in a 8" square pan for 30 minutes and the 30 minutes was more than enough time.  Sadly, this was a bomb of a recipe as I was lookiing for an easy and delicious sponge cake recipe but this definitely wasn't it.

I must have done something wrong with this one. It came out really dry and quite chewy. It still tasted quite good, but the texture was really disappointing.

Taste was good, texture was dense and firm and spongey- the kind of cake you could pick up with your hands easily. I wish it was more light, like the other reviews said. I didn't have lemon extract but used lemon juice, which was hardly noticeable (I also used vanilla extract). It took more than 45 minutes to cook through- at 30 minutes it was wet and jiggly all the way through the center (9" baking pan).

Substituted lemon extract and flavoring with 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, it tasted great. But it wasn’t so spongey, it’s a great normal cake though

This was a nice cake.  I'd increase the lemon next time, but overall, it had a nice consistency, was easy, and best of all, nothing came from a packet.  I'm so tired of seeing a recipe name that sounds good, only to read the recipe and find out that it is just doctored up packets, cans of soup, or frozen items.  Seriously, does no one cook from scratch anymore?   Thank you for this recipe!

I thought the flavor was excellent, but it came out a bit dry.
