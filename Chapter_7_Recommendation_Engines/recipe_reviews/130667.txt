Hi everyone, I have since modified this recipe. I follow the same directions except I now add 2-3 cups of seasoned bread stuffing, 2 stalks of chopped celery, 1/2 lb of Italian sausage, and 2 granny smith apples, skin on and chopped. And of course with dried cranberries and chopped pecans or sliced almonds toasted. Enjoy!

I love this recipe. I used red peppers instead of green, and white onion instead of red cause that's what I had on hand. I also added sliced celery. I used turkey bacon vs. regular bacon. And I made the cornbread as per instructions on the box, and I let it sit out uncovered over night. I also added a whole box of Mrs. Cuberdson's cornbread stuffing bread cubes. Obviously I had to add extra liquid so I added some of the turkey neck broth. Didn't have the poppy seeds either.  This is definitely gonna stay a family favorite Thanksgiving recipe!  Thanks.

Pretty good!  I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and several family members commented that they really liked it. I felt like it was a bit too wet and didn't clump together as much as I would like, but I don't know how to solve that problem.  The flavor was really good, though!
