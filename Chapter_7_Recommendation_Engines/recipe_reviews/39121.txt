These were to die for!  They were so easy to prepare and smelled delightful steaming from the waffle iron! For those who decided not to use the pumpkin syrup on the waffles, you were missing out on the best part of the recipe.  The taste is so scrumptious that you could use it over ice cream placed on top of the waffles as a dessert!  As a finishing touch, I used whipped cream as a topping and all I can say is, "WOW!"  This is a keeper!

Great waffles!  It's a family tradition to have pumpkin pie for breakfast on Thanksgiving...maybe this year we'll see if these work out better.  I did not try the syrup part of the recipe as we're not big on rich syryps,so my review is just for the waffles themselves.  Excellent!

These were wonderful.  The sauce would also be great on ice cream.  The recipe was a tad confusing.  It did not state to seperate the eggs putting the yolks into the batter and reserving the whites to be beaten later.  No matter, they were fantastic with and with out the nuts.

Pretty good.  I also didn't add the nuts b/c of allergies and didn't do the pumpkin syrup. However they did cook out well.  The flavour was a little weak for me, though perfect for husband who doesn't like pumpkin.  You may want to increase the pumpkin a tad or the nutmeg a bit to bring out the flavour. NOTE: I have found that by putting the waffles in the oven to keep warm, if you prop open the oven door, they will stay crisp.

The waffles were ok, but we really did not enjoy the glaze... I recommend using just maple syrup.

Wow!! Try these you won't be sorry.  They were awesome.  THe only thing I did differently was omit the nuts (allergies).  I was really skeptical of the pumpkin maple syrup thing...but it was incredible!  Almost turned into a glaze when you poured it on...Yum!!

The waffles are FANTASTIC, sure to become a family favorite, however, the syrup was a little to much.

Excellent with apple butter!  I used half whole wheat and half regular flour, doubled the pumpkin (I love pumpkin flavor), and halved the milk at first and then added some a bit at a time to get the right consistency.  They were very light and fluffy!  Took about 2 minutes longer to cook on my waffle iron than regular waffles.

YUM!  Try it, you'll like it!  

I loved this recipe!  My breakfast companion enjoyed it as well.  I forgot to add the nuts and am not sure we missed them.  Like some other readers, I subbed 1/2 whole wheat flour, just to up the fiber, make it a lil healthier, and only did half the salt.  The glaze was delicious.  The waffles are pretty tasty by themselves, but if you really like pumpkin, then you have to do the glaze too because it brings the pumpkinness to a whole new level!  :)  YUM.  Will be making these again.

The waffles themselves were tasty, I used WW flour instead of regular and brown sugar instead of granulated, however the syrup wasn't a favorite. It resembled baby food more than anything. Will make the waffles again but skip the syrup next time.

My kids tell me this is the best waffle they have ever had.  I did skip the nuts because I didn't have any in the house.  I will try the waffles with nuts either on them or in them next time.  

I love that they get some fiber in the morning.  I also used 2/3 cup whole wheat flour to make it even healthier.  All around a great breakfast choice!

Yum!  I added vanilla, and used pecans, chocolate chips, and/or walnuts on top.  It was very good!  I didn't try the syrup because of the iffy reviews.

When I started making this I thought I had pumpkin but when it came time to add it to the mix, I realized I did not.  I substituted applesauce instead and it turned out great.  My family gobbled them up.  Kind of defeats the title though.

Good waffles, but next time I might leave out the nuts. I used walnuts and they didn't seem to go with the flavor of the waffles. The sauce was really good!

These had good flavor and consistency and even my sons age 8 & 3 liked them(some waffles are too dense or not dense enough).  I used 50% more of each of the spiced.

Great Fall breakfast - quick and easy.  Didn't make the sauce, but enjoyed them just as well with plain maple syrup.

Yum!  I followed the recipe except I did not seperate the eggs.  I dont know if it makes a difference or not but the family liked it.  We also omitted the nuts.  We didnt make the sauce either but did serve them with maple syrup and whipped cream.  Another great breakfast recipe!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong - but they're very heavy ... not light at all and not crispy on the outside.   The flavor is wonderful -- so I"m wondering what I've done wrong.   I will definitely make again because I think they deserve a 2nd chance.

My husband and I and our houseguests enjoyed this recipe. The topping was better than we thought it would be - complemented the waffles very well. A couple of changes that I made: I didn't separate the egss and beat the whites, just added the whole eggs to the milk, pumpkin and melted butter and mixed well before stirring into the dry ingred; and, I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all-purpose flour. Still came out light, not heavy. Also, toasted the pecans in the microwave (~ 1-2 min) before adding them to the batter.  Will use this recipe again!

We LOVED this recipe!  We had it for dinner tonight.  I cut the pumpkin in the syrup to 1/2 cup. Delicious! And I know this sounds weird, but since we had it for dinner, we had pumpkin beer to drink and it was actually good together!  Next time I will try 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour.

Delicious!  I entirely forgot the butter and they were great.  We left out the nuts, and the syrup was yummy, too.

Great recipe - but the highlight is the pumpkin syrup recipe at the end!  While I will make the whole recipe again - I will probably make that sauce to go over other waffles too.  The pumpkin adds not only flavor - but nutritional value to the syrup and cuts calories!

Two picky thirteen year olds rated these 4 stars.  Which is unbelievable since ALMOST EVERYTHING that is somewhat healthy orthat varies from the normal kids junk food, gets a thumbs down from one of them. I can't believe I actually got a little fiber in them and they liked! I didn't use the nuts and I used Splenda instead of refined sugar. I think they needed a little more salt and sugar (usually Splenda is 1 to 1) so I will use a few TBSP more Splenda next time. Oh, i told them they were called "Pumpkin PIE Waffles".

This is my first time making these waffles.  They were absolutely delicious and made the kitchen smell heavenly, but you couldn't taste the pumpkin (hence the four stars).  Next time I make this, I will make the pumpkin sauce as well and see if it brings out the flavor of the pumpkin in the waffles.  It's a keeper recipe -- the waffles were crispy on the outside and light, fluffy and spicy on the inside.  Wonderful on a cold morning!

These were excellent, even my Picky one loved them.  I also used half whole wheat half all purpose and half splend half brown sugar.I left ou the nuts and used mini choc chips, forgot the syrup but it looks  good enough to use on plain waffles!
