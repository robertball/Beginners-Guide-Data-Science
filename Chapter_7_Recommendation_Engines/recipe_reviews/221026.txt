This was easy and delish! ...especially considering I wasn't overly precise on the measurements of the ingredients. I used fresh cauliflower instead of frozen and parmesan cheese in place of the parm-reggiano blend. My husband can't have mashed potatoes the way he used to be able to, and he told me this was a great substitute. Thanks for a wonderful recipe - this one goes in our regular rotation!

Of all the variations of “fake mashed potatoes” cauliflower recipes I’ve tried, this is one of the best.  Most are good but most aren’t quite as sturdy as you’d want your “mashed potatoes” to be.  This recipe, however, takes care of that issue by essentially drying them out with extra cooking time once combined with the other ingredients. (Though I did not cook it nearly as long as the 12 minutes the recipe directed) That step, and probably the Parmesan cheese too, made all the difference.

Wow!  As a diabetic, I've been looking for something like this.  The only thing I did different was to whip it up w/ a hand mixer.  It was nice and fluffy.  This is a versatile method for cauliflower.  You could change the cheese around or make it plain and substitute it for mashed potatoes.

I did a few things differently, but it was great! I used a fresh head of cauliflower and steamed it until very soft. While the cauliflower was steaming I sautéed three smashed garlic cloves in about 2 TBS of butter. When the cauliflower was done I added it to the skillet with the butter and garlic and smashed with a potato masher. I added about a TBS of asiago cheese and a TBS of parmesan and about 2 TSP of whole milk. Sprinkled with pepper before serving and perfection!

Easy to make! My husband and 18 yr old daughter loved them, she even thought they were mashed potatoes. I used fresh cauliflower and fresh grated parmesan cheese. Will make again!

Yummy!  My son is a wrestler and only eats low carb during the season so I'm always looking for good side dishes to replace the usual potatoes or rice.  This was perfect!  I used fresh cauliflower instead of frozen but that was the only difference.

This recipe is awesome. I used roasted garlic, half n half instead of light cream, and I halved the amount of bitter... It tasted amazing.

Absolutely delicious!! Only made one change, after adding in the cream, I did not cook it any further, it was perfect just as it was and was not runny at all. Even my son that isn't a big fan of cauliflower ate every bite of it off his plate. Will definitely be making this one again!!!

So good! Used fresh cauliflower and I didn't have garlic cloves so I subbed garlic powder and garlic salt. I also added some Tony's Sacherie's and parsley to it. I will definitely make this regularly and it'll be real easy to play around with too.

Only used 3 cloves of garlic, subbed 2 T of sour cream and 1 T of water (should have used milk) for the cream. Everyone liked this!

6.2.18  Used fresh cauliflowers and steamed the florets in the microwave for 4 minutes.  I didn’t want the cauliflower mashed like you do with potatoes, so I did leave them a little chunky.  Couldn’t really taste the parmesan or garlic too much, so if I were to make this again, I’d probably increase both.  Wouldn’t say that this is my favorite cauliflower recipe on this site, but it was good, and all was eaten.

You can put it in a blender to make it smoother and less chunky.

I thought the mashed cauliflower was a nice change of pace, and definitely great for eating low carb.  My husband wasn't too impressed with the consistency, so I think I'll try the hand mixer next time to get them creamier and fluffier.  I'm excited to mess around with this to tailor to my family's taste.  Thanks!

I have wanted to try smashed cauliflower for a long time now, and I'm so glad I finally did!  This was really good.  I used fresh cauliflower, no chives (I hate chives), and used half-and-half instead of cream (side note- sometimes the "shopping list" function doesn't work quite 100% right, LOL), but it was really really good!

My family loved this. I didn't have the french chedder. I substituted Velveeta and used parmesan cheese seasoned with Italian seasonings. Still a little runny. Need to drain a little more of the broth.
