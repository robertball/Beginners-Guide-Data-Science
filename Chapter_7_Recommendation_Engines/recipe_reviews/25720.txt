i've made this soup twice now and it's abolutely delicious.  however i'm a lover of spices, and found that the amount of pumpkin and pototoes in the original recipe are too much in relation to the amount of spices used.  therefore, 2nd time round, i only used about half the amount of potatoes, and the result was much better.  think i chucked in a few extra cloves of garlic too. ;)
**UPDATE**: i've since realised that the sweet potatoes i get here in the netherlands are *huge* in comparison to the size in other countries - an average sweet potato weighs 400 grams - that's probably why i found that there was too much potato in the recipe. ;)

YUMMY!  I made this with a Squash instead of Pumpkin since I was given a home-grown squash by a friend.  I also added coconut milk and curry spices and then garnished with coriander.  It was bloody good!  Whenever I make soup, I have to make a HUGE CAULDRON of it and I have several single friends who dislike cooking for one as much as I do!  So I have started a 'Soup-of-the-Week' Club where I dole out portions of soup to my friends and neighbours.  And they all said that this was one of the best soups I have ever made - very high praise after over a year of soup every week!  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!  Sara Ottawa, ON

I love this recipe!  I also tried roasting the spices before grinding them, and used a larger quantity of sweet potato wedges- the extras make a great snack!

I loved this recipe! I served it for thanksgiving dinner with a small slice of goat cheese at the bottom of the bowl, which added to the silky texture and perfectly complimented the spice! It was a great success!

This soup was delicious and a great variation on a family favourite.  We served as a starter for a very important dinner party and each guest was amazed at the delicate flavour the spices created.  Will defintely use again!!!!!!!!!

Thank you to Simon for this very yummy soup! The spices were perfect! Simon may have stumbled on the Colonel's secret herbs and spices.... My kitchen smelt like KFC. Very easy to make which is a good thing for busy Mums and Dads. My very fussy 12 year old loved it! Joy! I served with sour cream and oven baked rolls. I will toast the herbs next time as suggested as this does bring out flavour and intensity. Winner! Smiles from Australia(:

I thought this recipe was okay... I liked the "spice rub" idea and the flavor was great but I couldn't get the consistency to come out right.  I put it back into the food processor twice to get it creamier with no luck.  I added cream and that helped, but not nearly as healthy!  I may keep working on it, but not our favorite as it is right now.

Way to go, Simon!! This soup was awesome.!! I added a bit more cumin and a couple shakes of curry, plus some sauteed hot Italian sausage (chicken, not pork) and used canned pumpkin instead. I'm going to have some tomorrow for lunch, 3rd day in a row which is saying ALOT about the soup.

I've tried this recipe several times with a few variations. I've used coconut milk in it to make it creamier. I've also added curry. I love it, but it's not exactly the most popular when I make it. I think it's mostly people who don't like pumpkin or sweet potato that dislike it.

Had we not been eating grilled "pumpkin" (kabocha here in Japan) rind and all for years, I might have been wary of this recipe. BUT you CAN eat the rind, folks! Simon's spice blend was just so tasty. I used a smallish kabocha, eight inch diameter, and one can of sweet potatoes, drained. I had about two and a half cups of chicken stock in the freezer which had half a large carrot cooked in, so used that and added cans of broth until I got the thickness desired (using a hand held blender and puree'ing directly in the cookpot). The flavor was really good. I serve with toasted wedges of pita bread, which seems a good match, as the soup is quite thick, even having "thinned" it, so wedges can be dipped to good advantage. Even with the smallish kabocha and using only 1 tin of potatoes, I had lots and lots of soup, and now besides the quart in my freezer, there's another meal's worth in the fridge. Good return on time invested. Thanks, Simon.

I made this soup exactly as the recipe states and it is amazing. Love the taste and texture of the soup. I am still deciding if I want to add in the coconut milk as suggested by another because I love cream soups. But I love it just as it stands.

A little more spicy than I had expected. I had not used coriander before, so that was a new experience. Still, rather tasty.

Everything was great here except I added a can of coconut cream (it really added a silky richness) and some freshly chopped coriander and cashews as garnish.

OMG this recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I didn't have a pumpkin but did have most of a can of puree leftover that I wanted to use up. Also didn't have most of the whole spices but did have ground versions and it all came together in a melange of orange deliciousness. I ate almost half the pot by myself, topped with crisp bacon and blue cheese crumbles as I'd seen recommended in a similar recipe. This one is definitely a keeper and I can't wait to see how the flavors have developed when I have the rest of it for dinner tonight!

This recipe didn't go over well with my family.  My 3-year-old says it's too spicy, and wouldn't eat it.  I think it is edible, but I won't be making it again.

I doubled the amount of onions and garlic and saluted them. Added chunks of different coloured carrots and sweet potatoes to the sauté.  I used vegan bouillon and topped with creamed coconut.  I also omitted the fennel. I baked a butternut squash and then puréed it with some broth ladled from the pot after boiling the sauté.  I returned the purée to the pot with the chunked sweet potatoes and carrots.  The soup had amazing texture and flavour.  The chunks of spice seeds are a great taste treat, too.  This recipe is very flexible. Thank you for posting it!

I added some finely chopped chicken sausage since I like to have meat in a meal.  The spices were a lot hotter than I expected.  It is the perfect solution for a house full of people trying to recover from a cold.  Sinuses were all clear after eating the soup.  My kids didn't like the consistency.  Maybe next time I'll add the coconut milk to smooth it out.  I wasn't impressed at first bite but I couldn't stop eating it and kept going back for more.  Right now I'm about to pop from being so full.  The recipe makes enough for a whole week of leftovers.

I used less chicken broth - 2 pints and 1 big sweet potato. I also roasted a whole bulb of garlic and threw that in the puree. I changed the spices to cumin, oregano, salt, peppercorns, and TJ's smoke seasoning. Added 1 T of butter, would've used ghee if I had it. Omitted the onion and olive oil. Came out wonderful! Flavors are on the palate far after you are done eating:)

The blend of spices is wonderful!  All the times I've made this soup, I've never used the pumpkin.  I made it with fresh yams not its lighter colored cousin sweet potato. I used enough yams to equal the pumpkin and sweet potato. Peeled, slathered in the savory garlic spice paste, then roasted.  I froze the first batch for a camping trip and it was a hit!  I've made this several time since using my own chicken stock and Kitchen Basics Chicken and Vegetable stock for a veg/vegan version. Using homemade stock resulted in a more velvety texture probably because there was a little more fat. I've used a hand blender which is the least messy and my food processor.

I made the soup and it tasted like it was missing something. I didn't have fennel seeds but I really don't think that would make the soup. But maybe! As it wasn't very flavorful, I popped open a can of coconut milk as per reviewer suggestion and added half in. It still tasted just ok. I mean it is good. Just not tasty. Won't be making it again.
