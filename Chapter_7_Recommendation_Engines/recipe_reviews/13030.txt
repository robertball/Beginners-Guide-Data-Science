This was such a good Corn Chowder.  Everyone loved it - even the kids.  I didn't use the sherry or cayenne (only because I didn't have any).  It turned out great.  I had to share the recepie right away.

This was very good!  The only change I made was to use half Monterey jack cheese and half pepper jack.  We like spicy and this gave it more of a kick -- next time I might just use all pepper jack. To serve, I used the idea I had gotten from another site. Divided it up into oven-safe bowls and topped with puffed pastry. Cut rounds from sheets of puffed pastry slightly larger than the bowls, brush edges with beaten egg, invert rounds onto filled bowls and press edges to sides to seal. Brush tops and refrigerate an hour.  Place bowls on baking sheet and bake in 400 degree oven for 30 minutes or until golden and puffed. Makes an impressive presentation for soups and chowders!!

I used a mixture of frozen corn and frozen mixed vegetables (instead of creamed corn and canned corn) and it was wonderful.  After making the roux in the morning, I stuck the the whole thing in the crockpot and we had wonderful soup much later in the day.  Next time, I'm going to puree some of the veggies to make more 'juice' because that's what my husband missed.  I also added a splash more sherry...nice.  Added fresh bread from the bread machine and we had a lovely supper.

I doubled this recipe (made 8 servings)--
I made changes based on reviews and what I had in the house.  I omitted the sherry, and green pepper.  I added a chopped carrot to the onions when I sauted them.  As others said, it looked way, way too thick.  I used about 1.5 cups 2% milk, and 1.5 cups whole milk-- then after seeing how thick it was I probably added about 3 cups water.  For the corn I used 1 fresh corn cob (shaved off the cob, obviously), and a big bag of frozen corn.  And only one can of cream corn- that's all I had. Added a tsp. of sugar.  When I added the corn to the soup, I also added a cut up potato, and added colby shredded cheese-- but only at the last few minutes.  Sounds like a lot of changes, but it really wasn't too different from the original, and it was really good.  
And by the way- I made this all with my 3 year old helping.. he washed all the vegetables (he spent about 10 minutes on each one :).

I agree with previous posters who wrote that this recipe is a good "starting point" or base but still needed to be enhanced.  I initially found it to be bland... aka a glorified creamed corn soup. But I added various spices to the mixture:  cumin, garlic salt, basil, ground pepper, and yes, even a dash of chili (for the extra zing).  I also threw in more veggies (e.g. celery, mushrooms), as well as some shrimp.  A previous poster suggested adding sour cream before eating the soup.  I tried that it was much yummier!

Very delicious, not to mention easy to make. This stuff can serve a crowd, and freezes well for leftovers. Only change I made was omitting the red peppers as personal preference, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!

I can condfidently call this recipe "Awesome" without a hint of nerdiness. To make the recipe less-dairy and friendlier on my stomach, I used Lactaid skim milk. For the cheese, what I had on hand was light mozzerella string cheese. So I just separated two sticks into "strings" and called it good. I added a bit more cayenne pepper than was called for-- very sinus clearing! And, like many people, I added two decent sized diced potatoes to the mix. I left out the sherry and it was fine. The end result was very, very good and I will most definitely make it again.

Love, love, love this recipe.  Quick and easy to throw together and let simmer away on the stove.  I added one stalk of chopped celery, one chopped carrot to the onion and then added a diced potato and a can of mild green chilies with the cans of corn.  I also subsituted half the jack cheese for pepper jack for an extra kick.  I waited until the last few minutes of cooking to add the cheese though for fear it would burn.  Your family will love this recipe and it's perfect on a chilly day!

This is by far my absolute favorite corn chowder.  I have made it several times and even brought it to a holiday party where it was a big hit. Last time I made it, I added 1 cubed russett potato, 1 chopped carrot, and 1/2 cup frozen peas. As usual, I am kicking myself for not doubling or tripling the recipe to have enough leftovers for a few days!

I thought this was surprisingly excellent, I followed the directions almost exactly except I shortened the cooking time. for anyone on a time budget, I suggest mixing the creamed corn and milk in the pan you want your finished soup in, on mediumish heat, after 5 minutes add in your other can of corn. In the meantime (during the 5 minutes) melt  the butter in a separate small saucepan, then add the onions, give it the three minutes, add the seasonings, wine, and flour, add to what should be now a nice thick corn soup in the other pan, add the cheese and bell pepper and voila!  Very easy, delicious, and took about 20 minutes.

My family loved the recipe.  Being from Louisiana, I added Tabasco hot sauce and it was realy good.  My husband said it was the best of all the soups i have tried from this site.  I am going to try it with shrimp next time.

I changed the recipe quite a bit, but it was a good starting point.  I threw all the veggies except corn (and added a potato, some carrots, and celery) into the crockpot in the morning with a can of chicken broth.  A few hours before we were ready to eat, I made the milk mixture and stirred that in with some corn.  I let it cook too long though because it started breaking up.  Great flavor though. I  really like all the veggies.

I made this for a gathering of 13 people, and it was a huge hit!  Everybody went back for seconds.  We added more milk because it was a little thicker than we liked, and it seems like we added salt.

Made this in the slow cooker instead, but kept fairly close to the recipe. Only differences were I skipped the veggies, and shredded potatoes into the soup instead. I used heavy cream and a little bit of milk until the liquid came just slightly above the level of the corn. I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 4 hours on high, and added the cheese right before I served it. Best chowder I ever had!

This is some serious comfort food. It's a sweet corn chowder, due to the canned corns. I liked the addition of the peppers, as they gave it a nice flavor. But I'd like to try a less sweet chowder next, perhaps with frozen corn and cream or half and half. There was definitely not enough liquid here. I added the liquid from the canned whole kernel corn and also added milk until it was the consistancy that I wanted.

For 2 T of flour you definately need more than one cup of milk. I just poured it in until I felt it looked good. I used frozen corn instead of the niblets.  But by all acounts good recipe.

This recipe gets high marks for simplicity's sake (it was so easy to put together), but I didn't care for it that much. In the end, it tasted like glorified creamed corn to me. I have tried other corn chowder recipes on this site which are better.

This recipe is a great starting point. My husband and I omitted the green pepper and added yellow bell pepper along with the red bell pepper. We also added sweet italian sausage and shrimp. Since we doubled the recipe I subsituted one can of condensed milk for 1 cup of milk. We added potatoes also like others had recommended. It turns out to be a great dish!

This was soo good!  I added chopped carrots and potatoes and 2 garlic cloves, also did not drain the can of corn for a little extra liquid since the other reviewers said it was too thick.  I didn't have a lot of spice on hand so I used salt and a few hearty shakes of Cholula seasoning - Perfect!  I will make again and again!

Great starting point recipe.  I doubled it (we love leftovers) and added a hefty dash of red pepper flakes (Watkins brand...don't bother with the cheap stuff, the difference is amazing) as well as a huge sprinkle of Watkins pepper (Black Tellicherry Peppercorns, another item I now refuse to live without).  I omitted the sherry (who keeps that on hand????), upped the onion (used a whole large onion) and added two cloves minced garlic.  Don't drain the niblet corn and add two cans of water as well. Very simple yet filling and nourishing meal--serve with American Biscuits for lunch, add a green salad and you have dinner!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I had to make a few changes out of necessity, but they didn't compromise the flavor at all. I didn't have any bell peppers so I used a can of mexi-corn, instead of the canned cream corn I used frozen, I added a chicken boullion cube and about a 1/2 cup of milk (it was a bit too thick without it)..next time I may add some chicken broth, and for the cheese I used half cheddar / half mozzerella.  I think the reviewer who suggested pepperjack had the right idea.  This recipe is cheap, versatile, and idiot-proof...I highly recommend it!

This is thick and filling and hearty.  Sweet and spicy depending on how much heat you add.  I used whole milk, frozen corn instead of the whole kernal canned, and added a dash or two of: cumin, chipotle pepper seasoning, cilantro, and healthy dose of garlic.  I did have to add some skim milk to thin it out as it cooked, and then adjust the spices again, so next time I'll just add a cup and a half of milk to start with.  Used red/yellow pepper and that made it very pretty.  I also added a peeled and diced potato.  Yum!

I tripled the recipe, added about 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream (in addition to the milk), a dash of extra sherry, and an extra can of creamed corn.  Also, i waited to add the seasonings til i added the corn.  

It didn't taste good until i added the cream.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have any canned corn, so I used a small bag of the frozen stuff instead. Great flavor, and the cayanne gives it a subtle heat that everyone in our household loved.

Colorful, easy, cheap, fantastic! This does not miss the bacon (or the fat) so many corn chowders call for. I added depth to the flavor by roasting 1 red bell pepper before adding it to the soup. I left out the other pepper.  I substituted crushed red pepper for the cayenne.  I also found the soup needed an additional cup of milk to thin it out a bit and a touch more sherry.  I added additional parsley, thyme, basil and rosemary from my herb garden to round out the flavors.  This is a great recipe to play with. Will keep this on hand for cold, rainy nights.  Great with a green salad, warm bread and a white Bordeaux.

I'm the only vegetarian in my group which means I am always on the hunt for a new recipe that is non-vegetarian friendly.  My husband and our friends all loved this recipe.  I prefer corn chowder that is thicker, more along the lines of chili.  I substituted half and half for the milk and added some corn starch also.  It turned out wonderfully.  I may try just limitting the amount of milk next time instead.  Very filling and the spicy flavor was a pleasant suprise!

Great on a cold rainy night.  I added about 1 cup more milk than called for because I wanted it to be not as thick as writen.  I also added 2 cubed potatoes when I added the corn and 2 jalapeno peppers for an extra kick!

I am giving this 5 stars because of the great taste.  I used a hot fresh red pepper instead of a red bell as the grocery store didn't have one.  We used this as a DIP though with corn chips because it was so thick!  It made a great dip though and will use it as a change from nacho cheese dip, etc.  Couldn't stop eating it!

I tried this and liked it so much, I wanted to make it again, but didn't have time to do anything other than use a slow cooker.  I did not put in the butter, substituted onion powder for the onions (I don't like onions anyway, but onion powder is okay)and added frozen potatoes.  Also, both times I used 2 cans of regular corn (not cream).  At some point in the process, when the slow cooker had heated up a bit, I took some of the liquid out and stirred in some cornstarch (instead of flour - I have a wheat allergy), then poured the liquid back into the pot.  It thickened up nicely. Both times I loved this chowder.  Next time, for my husband, I'll put some sausage in.

This was a big hit amoung my friends and family. It's fairly easy to make and leaves plenty of room for experimentation. I added celery to mine and it was a great addition. I recommend this chowder highly.

This was super easy to make, I would add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and replace the salt and pepper with Old Bay seasoning....and add tabasco or cayenne pepper to taste as well during or after to taste. This doesn't' make a TON of chowder, so double everything if you have a more than two people serving and if you like it thinner add some chicken broth. I also put in red and orange mini-peppers which are sweet and sautéed them with the onions (all finely chopped, I was going to add some finely chopped celery too but I forgot! Ahck! No potatoes though (so may recipes have them)- not necessary.

This is my very favorite Chowder.  I make it often & each time I do, I add or substitute either the type of cheese or perhaps add half & half or cream instead of milk.  This Chowder is wonderful because it is so versatile.  Try adding cooked bacon or browned slices of kielbasa.  A well received offering to many of my friends & neighbors!  ENJOY!

This recipe was not good! It was burnt after 10 minutes. I really don't know what the other comments are talking about but cheese cooking for 1 hour makes it burnt. I cooked it for 10 minutes and it tasted almost horrible. We suffered through it not to waste all that food but I do NOT recommend this recipe.

this was an alright recipe, i cooked it as is.  My rating is before I modified it.  After i tasted it, i made some changes, because it was rather bland... i added some cream cheese, garlic salt instead of regular, more corn, made a roux to thicken it up a bit, onion powder - i should have done the onion originally - and more garlic powder, which should have been done in the original mix.  I also chopped up a small amount of a jalapeno, maybe 1/4 of one - i have small children who do not tolerate spicy things well... two children (5 & 1) loved it, as did husband, but the 2 yo didn’t like it – then again, he doesn’t like much these days!

Wow, simply amazing soup!  I liked it better before the cream corn was added, just a personal preference, it seemed to dilute the flavour a bit.  I used frozen corn instead of canned.

We were hosting a soup supper and we needed one vegetarian soup.   I found this and gave it a try.    It was excellent.   Even our non-vegetarian guests liked it.    I followed the recipe almost precisely.   If I were making it just for us I would probably add some bacon.    Most good chowders have bacon but, actually, this was very good without it.

Excellent. I doubled the recipe and added some chicken stock (1 cup) as it was a little too thick and some white pepper. Didn't have the green bell pepper or the sherry but it was still great without it. Added bacon and cheddar cheese to the top at serving.  If you are looking for a simple satisfying corn chowder this is it.

I've made this soup a couple of times before I left a review. I made it as is the first time, waaay to thick but tasted great.  The next time I put in the water that came with the can of corn and it was perfect. I also added a teaspoon of chicken broth powder.  That really seemed to make it just that much better.  Yummm!

YUM YUM YUM!!!  This was exactly what I was looking for in a corn chowder recipe!!  It is delicious!  Didn't have any sherry or cayenne and was fine!  I increased the recipe to 12 servings and that made a nice, full stock pot.

This is such a good recipe.  I never use the sherry or the parsley, and it turns out wonderful every time.  Great with a crusty french bread.

Following others' advice, I used all pepperjack cheese.  I found it a little thick, so I added about 12 oz. chicken  broth, which gave it a lot more liquid--delicious!

I really liked this recipe.  Super easy and quick.  I changed a few things based on some other reviews and ingredients on hand.  I sauteed the onions in bacon fat, I used red onions, I used at least least twice the sherry and I used hot sauce instead of cayenne pepper.  Also double the corn and used about three cups of milk.  Cheddar instead of Monterey Jack.  It seems like I changed a lot, but this was a great base.  I also added medium shrimp to the chowder to make it a meal and served it with french bread.

this recipe is similar to the Del Monte corn chowder recipe, I added a large potato, chopped celery instead of peppers... and some extra milk/water since the soup was really thick. Also omitted the cheese since it was already

Easy, fast and tasty. Have extra milk on hand as I needed a couple more cups by serving time. This recipe is great because you can add anything, I added bacon, diced zucchini, green onion, chicken etc.

This recipe was good but I made alot of changes to make this a full meal type chowder. First I fried a few slices of bacon with the onions. Then added a few more veggies. I added potatoe, carrot, celery. I didn't add the cheese to the chowder, I put it on the table for family to add to the top of thier chowder. Served this with a herty warm garlic,cheese,multigrain loaf and a salad of baby greens. Very tastey!

Great recipe. Cayenne pepper added just that little bit of kick. Didn't have any green or red peppers, but didn't miss it. Did add potatoes, though. You can't have chowder without potatoes. Also didn't have monterey jack cheese, used mozzerella, still good. My husband and kids loved it.

We had this for dinner with sourdough bread and it was great. I had to leave out the sherry and I added cooked, and crumbled bacon near the end. I also only simmered it 1/2 an hour and kept it on very low heat. But it was super. My husband was VERY doubtful it would be good and he loved it.

Wonderful corn chowder! I added one large red potato and am glad I did. I also just used half a red pepper since I didn't have a green pepper and I sauteed the pepper with the onion. No extra milk was necessary. Next time I will double the recipe so I can have leftovers!

I don't even like corn chowder all that much but this was delicious. I altered the recipe a little by adding italian sausage,potatoes, an extra cup of milk and omiting the can of non-creamed corn. I imagine it would be too thick without the extra milk. Adding a dollop of sour cream to your bowl of soup finishes it off nicely. Thanks

This was very tasty, however, I did add a few things to it and would adjust it a little next time. First I added some diced up sausage and one diced potato (can't have chowder without potato!!) at the beginning. I also used smaller cans of corn and still think it came out too thick. I would add 2 cups of milk next time, and maybe cut back on the corn even more.  I also didn't have red pepper so I just used a whole green bell pepper and I added a little more than a pinch of cayenne pepper because we like it spicy! I'm definately keeping this recipe!

Very tasty.  I added a couple of diced baked potatoes & substituted apple cider for wine.  I  added more milk than the recipe called for since it seemed really thick.  I also may have simmered it at too high a temp or for too long because it tried to separate on me.

This was great! I roasted the peppers before dicing them and adding to the chowder which gave it a nice added smokey flavor. I also cut carrots into small rounds, sauteed on high to give them a little color and then added them with the peppers. Its a perfect fall lunch served with tortilla chips. Thanks!

I really enoyed this soup. Generally i won't eat bell peppers in many dishes, only with meat perhaps, but they went quite well here. Most chowders have a rather bland, smooth taste but the peppers gave this soup an extra "spicy" flavor.

This is a real "keeper"!  Made it for my office staff today and had three requests for the recipe.
