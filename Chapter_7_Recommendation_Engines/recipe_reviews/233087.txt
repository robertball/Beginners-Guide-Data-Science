Who doesn't want to give someone with the name Armywife 5 stars?  But here it is, the truth.  This was a solid bar and I proudly brought some of them to a mommies group while sending some to my husbands work.  The gals and I all agreed it stands about a 3.  The consensus was to add more blueberries and some almond extract to the cream cheese mixture--then add some nuts to the crust.  Overall I wasn't wild about the flavor of the crust, not sure if it was the flour or what.  They were very easy to make and definitely have the "from scratch" vibe.  Overall a -good- recipe.

So good! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the changes were minor. The concept was perfect, just what I was looking for! Changes made: No wheat flour, just regular for crust. 1/4 cup more oats, 2 tbsp more butter for crust. Added about 1 tsp cinnamon to the crust. No lemon zest, so added 1/2 tbsp lemon juice extra. Added about 1/2 cup more blueberries. Didn't have the patience to let it set up, so the middle is a bit squishier than I would like, but it tastes AMAZING. Will make again, and again....

This recipe is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was great. Though it's more of a dessert, and I made it with the intention of having it as a granola bar in the morning. The only thing I would suggest is adding maybe 1/4 cup more oats, and when baking it at the end, baking it for about 35-40 minutes. Thanks for sharing!!

This was the Buzz Recipe Group Selection for the week of April 27, 2015. I  made using all the listed ingredients, however, I did use my own homegrown frozen blueberries. I used the dough blade in my Cuisinart food processor to make the crust. Pressed into the bottom of my lined and lightly greased pan, baked for 12 minutes and then allowed the crust to cool. Poured filling into crust and baked for exactly 30 minutes. I allowed to cool on the counter for about 10 minutes and then placed in the refrigerator for an hour. Such an easy, delicious recipe worthy of five stars!  Thank you, ~*CountryGirlGourmet*~ for sharing your recipe for Blueberry Oat Dream Bars!

We picked some fresh blueberries and I made this for July 4th.  I didn't have whole wheat flour so just used all AP flour.  My hubs really liked this but I think it may be too sweet for me.  The blueberry and cream cheese together taste delicious.

Put all the crust on the bottom mixed with 2 diced apples, baked for 20 minutes, spread cream cheese, then a layer of 2 thin-sliced apples, baked for 25 more minutes.  Perfect!

I tried these two ways, the original making the blueberry filling and the second just sprinkling the blueberries with a little bit of sugar. I couldn't tell the difference between the two. Both were delicious!

Fantastic solid recipe, I increased berries to 1 1/2 cups. I might try doubling filling in future for higher cream cheese berry to crumb crust ratio

Oh yum!  My family loved this.  Followed the recipe exactly and topped with home-made vanilla ice cream.  Oh my, it was good.  I think this would work very well with fresh peaches too.

I made this exactly to the recipe. They were acceptable but there was just something missing....cinnamon or something. I would make again but try different spices to improve the flavor.

It is really good, but a little too sweet.  I think next time I would cut down on the sugar and maybe up the fruit.  Good with raspberries too.

These were very well received.  I did use frozen wild blueberries, because I prefer the smaller berries.  To anyone who chooses to do the same, I would advise thawing and drying the berries with paper towels to remove some excess moisture.  My bars turned out fine, but the filling was softer than I would have liked.  Happy baking!

Wow, this was great! I substituted all-purpose gluten free flour and admittedly went overboard on the lemon (because I LOVE lemon) and it was delicious. Will definitely make again.

Made for Recipe Group. You need to make these, go now and do it! And I agree with some of the other reviewers, needs more berries. I probably added 1/2 cup extra. I had two 6oz pkgs so just used them both. I washed, dried, dusted with flour and then stuck them in the freezer a bit. Used all AP flour and no zest since I didn't have any lemons. Almond extract in the cheese sounds yummy to me too. Definitely need to frig to set them up unless you just want to spoon them out. But, that burst of blueberry in my mouth with the slightly tangy creamy cheese. And crunchy from the oat mixture. Mmmmmmmmmmm.

Recipe Group Selection: 25, April 2015 ~ I started to make this and realized I was out of whole wheat flour, so I made with all all-purpose white flour.  The only 9" pan I have is round, so in a round baking pan it went.  The flavor is very nice and we thought the ingredients worked well together.  I baked as directed, cooled and cut a piece.  My filling was not done.  I turned the oven back on to 350° and put the pan back in and baked for 10 more minutes.  This time when I cut them, after they had cooled, they held their shape.
