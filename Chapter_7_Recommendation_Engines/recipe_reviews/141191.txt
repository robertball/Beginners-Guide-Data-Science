To cut down on fat, I baked rather than fried this chicken, and it was still to die for! I followed all directions except when it came time to put them in the olive oil, I put them on my stoneware pan with all the marinade (which made for a nice breading) drizzled 1/4 olive oil over top, and baked at 375 for 47 minutes. I turned the chicken half way through baking.  The dipping sauce thickened up just perfectly!  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was still plenty sweet.   Thanks for a great recipe, my hubby loved it!

OH MY GOSH....THIS WAS AMAZING!!!  I'm not trying to toot my own horn or anything but this is the best sesame chicken that I've ever had (and I've had a lot).  I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1 1/2 cup olive oil and followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  I used the corn starch mix to my preferred thickness.  Served dish with broccoli and white rice.  My fiance just went off to work to brag how great a chef I am!  SO EASY!  If your batter stuck to the pan, you might want to leave chicken in fridge longer before frying and make sure your oil is hot enough.

I made this tonight for my husbands birthday. I got rave reviews from everyone, including the MIL! I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and to be honest, it could have been 1/4 or under even. It was just awesome, the flavor outstanding. I didn't dump the entire slurry of cornstarch/water, but kept adding until I was satisfied with the thickness, definitely did not use it all. I think that is just a preference type of thing. I will be making this many more times!

Baked, not fried!  Like emilyjane928, I wanted to avoid deep frying.  Slightly different approach...I coated a baking sheet with 2T olive oil, then spread the chicken (straight from fridge) onto the sheet and baked at 400 degrees for 15 min.  Then turned the chicken and poured the hot sauce over the top, returned to oven for another 10-15 min.  Great reviews from family!!!  Also...only used 1/2 c sugar...will use another tsp chili paste next time to kick up the heat.  Yum!

Even my picky teen-agers ate this and said it tasted like it came from a restaurant.  I took the suggestions and used brown sugar and rice vinegar. I used a whole can of chicken broth and mixed 1/3 C cold water and 3 T cornstarch to add to the sauce to thicken it.  I eliminated the sesame oil and sherry because we don't care for those flavors.  I served the sauce on the side. I made steamed broccoli, snow peas, and served it with Jasmine rice. Truly a restaurance quality recipe!  Thanks!

I was very impressed with this batter.  The chicken fried up with a shatteringly crisp crust and was moist inside.  Unfortunately, as soon as the sauce was poured over it, that great crispness was lost.  It made a nice presentation, but next time I'll serve the sauce on the side.  I reduced the amount of sugar in the sauce to 3/4 of a cup, and 2/3 cup would probably work too.  I only needed to use about 2/3 of the cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce.  I fried the chicken in a wok and used peanut oil instead of olive oil and I only used about 1 1/2 cups of oil instead of a quart.  All-in-all this had a very good flavor and I'll make it again

It is a great recipe for sure. However we thought it was very sweet made as written.  Even the kids agreed.  I should have read the reviews.  It turned out beautifully otherwise.  It does make a lot of sauce so no need to double it.

I had a hard time with this one. I thought that there was far too much sugar and cornstarch in the sauce and the batter was too thin. I was able to turn this into very good sesame chicken, but it didn't do it for me as written. Sorry - and thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!!I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of frying in olive oil. I used my deep fryer that has vegetable oil in it. Had this few weeks ago from a restaurant and have been wanting it again ever since. The batter didn't heavily coat the chicken at all which was different from restaurant style but still very good. Sesame flavor was perfect. Served which a variation/combination of "House Fried Rice" and "Fried Rice I" from this sight which included some sesame oil as well. Excellent. Thank you.

This is a very tasty recipe, but it is better to use another type of oil other than olive oil for frying.  Olive oil should only be used at low temperatures.  At a high heat, properties change, and what is healthy for you, actually becomes unhealthy.

I made just the sauce and used it over sauteed green beans. I used a mixture of white rice vinegar and a dark Chinese rice vinegar (which has great flavor)--I'd definitely recommend something other than the distilled stuff--all that does is make food sour without adding much in the way of taste.

I used 1/8 cup Merlot instead of dry sherry, added red food coloring for appearance and, I deep fried it in corn oil. In the future I will decrease the sesame oil to 1 tablespoon instead of 2. All in all it was really good. I will definately make it again.

This recipe turned out awesome!  Just the right amount of breading on the chicken. There was more sauce than necessary, but better to have too much than not enough. The only change to the recipe was that i cut down the amount of sugar as advised in other reviews (used 3/4 cup).  Everything was delicious and it looked like we had gotten take out.  We ate this with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli.

AMAZING! I'm only 14 but it was easy to make this for 9 people!!! (It did take a while, but it was more than worth it)  It tasted just as good as any Chinese restaurant, and my parents said they would pay me to make it again!! I've been trying to find a good sesame chicken recipe for a long time, and this is definitely as good as it gets!  Thank you SO much!!

Amazingly good – and that batter is amazing – such a light crispy/crunchiness. I will try this again substituting ½-2/3 c honey for the sugar, about 1 T chili paste, only 1 T sesame oil, regular not low sodium soy sauce, and frying in peanut oil for the asian take-out flavor the peanut oil gives. I might try a small squeeze of ketchup in the sauce. If you thicken this sauce with arrowroot (only) it will freeze well. This would be good on jasmine rice. I’ll try the battered chicken with a sweet/sour sauce and pineapple/bell peppers, or with a lemon sauce/glaze too. Thank you – especially for the batter.

Absolutely amazing! I halved the sugar and it was still pretty sweet. I've tried it as written and I've tried it adding garlic, oyster sauce, ginger and a few dashes of soy sauce to the sauce. They're both excellent, the second adding a little extra something to the sauce. Kids loved both versions and my only mistake the first time around was not doubling the recipe. I am NEVER ordering this again, only homemade! Kids said that it was better than at the restaurant. Thank you +++++ for this recipe! I'll try posting a picture next time around, it never seems to sit around long enough to take one

I used to love sesame chicken from the local chinese shop, but no longer.  This is amazing!  I made the sauce with 1/4 cup sugar, per a recommendation of another reviewer.  Also, the original poster said to adjust the amount of sugar depending on how sweet we want the sauce.  So I used less, then gradually added more, appx. another 1/4 cup, until my daughter and I liked the taste.  I served it over hot jasmine rice.  The sauce and the sesame seeds went on right before eating.  Mmmm!  The chicken even stayed crunchy that way!  I would recommend this to everyone.  It is amazing!  We love fried tofu, too, so I will try this same recipe with tofu cubes instead of chicken.

Do NOT bake these in the oven with the sauce over them ... makes for a weird consistency that way.  Need to try baking them without the sauce (which BTW is VERY tasty)

Sesame chicken (from one particular restaurant) is one of my sons' favorite foods. I have tried to make it MANY times.  This is absolutely the best and closest I have ever come to the sesame chicken he loves the most.  Thank you!!!  Will make again many, many times!

Not bad overall, but we felt that something was missing.  The batter for the chicken was very flavorful, the sauce just seemed flat.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used brown sugar and lessened the amount but ended up adding more because it needed something.  Next time I will try adding either some zing or more dark soy....

Very good recipe!  My kids (2 and 4) gobbled it up and begged for it for dinner tomorrow night!!!  I did reduce the Sesame oil by half and it was still way too much.  Next time I make this, I'll just add 1/2 TLBS of the Sesame oil and see how it goes.  Also, I fried the chicken in canola oil.  Olive oil has a very low smoke point and will breakdown and not taste very good before you finish frying your chicken.  I also added a squeeze of ketchup to the sauce not only to give it some color, but to add to the flavor.  This is a GREAT recipe and I will be definately be making it again with a few tweeks!

I have to say I rate very few recipes but this came out so bland after so much work i had to warn folks away.  Maybe if I had poured over reviews and modified something would be better but as is it is BLAND.

We LOVED this sauce.  We didn't care for the chicken, way to salty but the sauce is so great that I rated it 5 stars anyway. I make the sauce regularly for potstickers, chow mein, spring rolls, soups, etc. I only add 1/2 the sugar, cornstarch and water though.

My husband requests this meal frequently. After making way too much sauce the first time, I found that the sauce freezes really well and will easily thaw out for the next time. Now I intentionally double or triple the recipe for the sauce and only make enough chicken for two of us and have enough sauce frozen so that I can skip that step the next time it is requested.

This was great, EXCEPT 1 cup of sugar was WAAAYYY too much!! It was absurdly sweet. Half the sugar would make this perfectly and still probably even be sweet.

Awesome recipe, made it almost exactly as the recipe directs but cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup - it was still a little too sweet for me, I'll go with 1/4-1/3 cup next time. No need to deep fry the chicken either, a thin layer of oil when cooking is sufficient. Will be making this again! Adding some veggies like broccoli and green onion would help too.

Sooooooo good!   I didn't have any low-sodium or dark soy sauce so, I substituted regular soy sauce for both and it still came out wonderful.   The chicken was moist and flavorful.  Even though the chicken was crispy it did seem to get soggy rather fast...  I'm glad I served the sauce on the side instead of pouring it over all the chicken.  And speaking of the sauce... Wow this recipe made a lot.  I cooked approx. 2 lbs of chicken and made chicken fried rice to go along with the dish and still had plenty of sauce left over.  Next time I will only make half the sauce recipe.   The only other change I made to the sauce was to use 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white,  rice wine vinegar instead of distilled white and added a few drops of red food coloring to enhance the presentation.  For my palate, the 2 TBSP of sesame oil was a bit overpowering... just a personal preference but, next time I will use only 1 TBSP.   Oh yes... there will definately be a next time!

After reading the reviews I decided to add 2 teaspoons of chile paste because others stated that it was a little sweet. My husband and I loved it. The chicken alone was good, once you add the sauce its even better. I learned the hard way the first time I made a sauce that when it calls for water and cornstarch to thicken it add it to the other ingredients VERY SLOWLY mixing while you pour it in.. just a little advice for those of you that have never made sauce before!

Hubs & I thought the was good, not great. Our son however, absolutely loved it. I always try to make a recipe as written the first time, as I see that as the only fair way to rate something. That said, I did change the amount of sugar right off the bat - 1C just looked like way too much for the amount of liquid so I reduced it by half, figuring I could always add more if need be. Also, I made the slurry as written, but found that I didn't need to use it all. My sauce tightened up almost immediately with roughly 1/2 of the mixture. I followed all other sauce measurements, then tasted in order to assess flavor. Wow - was it sweet! If I ever made this again, I would cut the sugar even more, 1/3 or even 1/4C would probably be enough. I also found it a bit bland outside of the sweetness. Prior to serving, I added 2 tblsp rice vinegar & 2 additional tblsp soy which we felt perked it up nicely. The chicken itself was quite good - it fries up nicely with this batter, which is not too heavy. It came out tender and juicy with a light crisp. Overall, I'd make this again - with the changes mentioned it becomes more of a 4-star dish for us.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I baked the chicken as other reviewers recommended and had a HUGE mess in the kitchen. The chicken flavor was good baked but the cleanup was a nightmare. So the second time I fried the chicken and the recipe turned out much better. Sometimes you just have to enjoy the extra calories from frying and cut back calories somewhere else. I followed the recipe to the letter both times. I think the next time I will back down on the sugar maybe by half and switch to brown sugar from Zulka sugar (dehydrated cane juice sugar). I love the texture of the breading so much that I plan to use this recipe for breading fish (minus the soy sauce) in other recipes. The chicken breading is so light and crispy that it's ideal to use in other ways. I do plan to add this into long term meal rotation (since it's fried I can't put it in very often). Thanks for a great recipe.

Unbelievable sauce!  I used frozen popcorn chicken and oven baked until crispy.  Doubled the sauce and had way too much, so will freeze the leftovers in a Ziploc bag and thaw under warm running water when we make this next, which will be soon!

My kids said, "Mom you have to make this more often". That kind of says it all!!  The only variation is I fried the chicken in vegetable oil, not olive oil. Will make this again and again and again!!

This recipes is fantastic,I did not change a thing. It is very easy to prepare. I have to prepared the batter ahead and let the chicken soak in the batter for a little longer than 20 minutes almost an hour and it was fine. Once done this is a very impressive dish, better than you would get in a restaurant!! Great Recipe

This is my first review on allrecipes.com, I am a student who got bored with all the cup noodles and tv-dinners. I went on allrecipes.com and found this recipe, I bought all the required groceries and prepared this meal. IT WAS AMAZING!!! Made it 2 days in a row and will definitely make it again throughout the years.  5 Stars!!

This is a great recipe and does taste a lot like take out sesame chicken but I found the sesame oil to be overpowering, I used just a drop of it in my sauce instead of 2 TBS and it still was very strong.

So easy, yet tastes phenomenal.  My husband loved it and said it was better than any restaurant!  I did use a little less sugar after reading the other reviews and it was still fantastic.  I've tried many fantastic recipes on this site, but this might be the biggest hit yet!

This turned out to be one of the best tasting chicken recipes I've ever made. It was a bit labor intensive, but so worth it once you put that first piece of sweet sesame chicken in your mouth. I followed the recipe just as written, except didn't use a quart of oil, I only used about a cup and half, and probably could have used a bit less. I added in the cornstarch slurry just until it reached the thickness I desired, but that was almost the whole amount. I was leery of the amount of sugar, but it was "perfect" for us. I served with Lo Mein Noodles from this site.

"PERFECT" is the best name for this recipe.  My family loved it.  This recipe really doesn't serve 6 though...More like 4.  I will double the chicken with the same amount of sauce next time.  Served with egg rolls and spinach/mandarin orange salad.  OUTSTANDING!

I traded the regular vineager for rice vinegar as per others suggestions and I omitted the Sherry as I had none on hand and just added more water.  I ended up not using all of the cornstarch mix to thicken the sauce.  I think the level of thickness is something every cook has to determine for themselves and adjust accordingly. Those are the only changes I made and this was awesome!!! Very high quality.  I will be making this for years to come.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I think I will cut down a little bit on the sugar the next time.  A cup is a lot, we thought it was just a little sweet, but this is a good recipe.  Most of this dish can be prepped early in the day which makes getting it on the table quickly in the evening great.

Wow!  This is definitely a 5 star restaurant quality dish!  We loved every mouthful.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the sherry ( I just used the same amount of water).  I have to disagree with those that said to reduce the amount of sugar, I started out with 3/4 cup and it wasn't the taste I was looking for.  I wanted more of a sweet and sour sauce and it just lacked flavor.  With 1 cup of sugar it was very sweet but the flavor was so much better.  We then just cut down on the amount we used over the chicken pieces and rice.  It was just what I was looking for and I will enjoy this recipe for years to come!  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have sherry or sesame oil and I substituted the chili paste for 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and it still came out absolutely amazing. I also used organic cane sugar instead of white sugar and that also tasted good.  Also, I used the soy sauce packets from all the take out I had gotten and saved in the fridge.  I used a trick for thickening the sauce that my mom gave me years ago and used ice cold water  and mixed that with the corn starch (instead of just water) and that thickens it immediately (literally!), which means less time waiting for yummy goodness!  If you don't have a kitchen thermometer to see how hot the oil is, put the oil in a large skillet on med-high for 20 minutes + and you'll be good. I fried mine at 300 degrees and they came out crispy.   No need for take out when you have this recipe!!!!

Restaurant quality for sure! I followed the recipe except for the following changes: replaced sherry with sesame oil,  reduced sugar to 1/3 cup, rice instead of white vinegar, and no chile paste. I almost baked it but my husband said to fry it and I'm so glad--it really added a great flavor! Definitely will make again!

Skipped the chile paste on personal preference, and used white cooking wine in place of sherry (what I had in the house).  This was great, and traveled well to work - in separate containers for the sauce and the chicken, then mixed them once heated.

I thought that it might involve a lot of prep work but it didn't as long as you make sure you have all your ingredients in the order listed before making it.  I did have to make a change with using  peanut oil instead of olive oil.  Olive oil doesn't do well with high heat frying and the peanut oil adds just the right flavor to this delicious Asian concoction.  Thanks for sharing!

I wouldn't say this tastes like the Chinese takeout, but it is pretty good. The batter alone rates 5 stars. The sauce makes it soggy. Next time I'll put the sauce over rice, not the chicken.

All I can say is that this recipe was AWESOME!!! I also used 3/4 cup of sugar and instead of using chili paste, I used 1/2 teaspoon chili powder. Also, I'm allergic to gluten, so I used rice flour instead of all-purpose flour, and I used gluten free soy sauce. This was absolutely FABULOUS!!!

this was a very good dish. i baked it like a few reviews did because i didn't want the mess with frying the chicken pieces in the hot oil, and the clean up afterwards of it.  i did half the sugar and that was plenty sweet, also i used the whole 1/4 cut of cornstarch, but i think i would only use half of that if i make it again.  actually i do plan on making it again as my husband really liked it.  thank you Doreen for such a delicious recipe.

Not quite sure what went wrong, but the chicken came out really funny tasting. The actual sauce was great, so we just ate it over rice.  I don't think I'll attempt it again. Disappointed :(

One food I miss from the States is Chinese sesame chicken. This was the first recipe I have ever tried and wow am I impressed. I followed the video on this and only used 3/4 cup of sugar. I didn't have sherry, so left that out. The sauce was gorgeous! It was that perfect sticky consistency like you'd get from a take away. I need to find an equally as good fried rice recipe and I'll be sorted.

I served along side some prawn crackers and sweet chilli dipping sauce.

The sauce turned out pretty good. I used a little too much of the cornstarch slurry though--next time I won't use all of it. Since I didn't have dark soy sauce on hand, I used regular soy sauce and added one green onion (whole) and a handful of mushrooms to the sauce as it boiled. I then removed the mushrooms and green onion before I added the cornstarch mixture. It helped the flavor quite a bit. Also, I subbed brown sugar for white (only 1/3 cup), it helped with the coloring. I also baked mine at 375 for 40 minutes as emilyjane928 suggested. Turned out to be delicious!

First time I made this I made it exactly as directed and it was delicious!
The second time I made it with a slightly thicker batter (2 extra tbs of flour), a little less sugar, and a little more vinegar (I used rice wine vinegar). I also made twice as much sauce to make sure we had plenty for blanched broccoli and more rice the next day.
Make sure your oil is screaming hot and drop each piece in slowly to help keep it from sticking to your fry pan. I like to lower mine in piece by piece with tongs - it takes longer, but it's worth it not to have to scrub the pan later.
Overall: I'm pretty sure my boyfriend is going to require me to make this at least once a week. I'm totally ok with that. Superb.

I have made this recipe twice so far. The first time, I tried baking the chicken, but it turned out rubbery and was barely edible in my opinion. The second time, I deep fried the chicken according to the recipe, and it was delicious. I was surprised at how perfect it turned out. I did reduce the sugar in the sauce, as other reviewers suggested, and it was still sweet and tasty. This will be a recipe that I hang on to as I am sure I will make it again.

Delicious, restaurant quality sesame chicken - I put in a tad less sugar and upped the chili paste by the same minute amount.  It was perfect.  Maybe it's just my beginner status in the kitchen, but this took me FOREVER to make.  If you've never made anything like this before, be prepared for a multi-hour experience.

Note: 3/4 cup sugar, more chili paste, less cornstarch

I also baked the pork (I used pork pieces instead of chicken) instead of frying it and it was DELISH. I just spread it out on a lightly greased baking sheet and baked it at 425 for about 30 minutes, flipping it all over once in between. My only complaint is that my sauce never did turn clear. I don't know what I did wrong. It looked more like caramel frosting than sesame sauce. That was sad. But the flavor was GREAT. Excellent dish. Will make again.

4 stars only because I changed a couple things.  First, I did not have sherry, so I substituted water.  Second, I only used 1/2 cup sugar (which was PLENTY).  I will make this again using a bit more chili paste, as we like things spicy.

This was a great recipe. I did not have any sherry so I substituted it with water. I also used siracha instead of chile paste.
After cooking the chicken I threw it in a bowl and spooned the sauce over the chicken and tossed. 
Kids loved it.

This was wonderful.  My daughter fixed this last night because her youngest son is having surgery this morning and this is his favorite.  She took the suggestions of others and decreased the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup.  Other than that she followed recipe exactly.  This received thumbs up from grandson...and my DH (quite an accomplishment).  This has become a new favorite.  Thanks so much Doreen..

My family really liked this recipe. I've never tried making chicken like this before, and it was a first-time success! Even without the sauce the chicken is tasty and addicting. My husband isn't a fan of sesame oil, so the sauce was a bit too much for him. I made this a second time, but substituted the sesame oil in the sauce with a balsamic vinegar, and it made the sauce a bit more like sweet and sour, which tasted just fine.

Excellent recipe. My only advice is if you're going to deep fry the chicken in a sauce pan, set it to medium heat and fry for a minimum of two minutes. You don't want to overdo it, but under-cooking chicken is bad news bears. I also used 2/3cup sugar, and cut out the cooking sherry.

This is so good.  It really does have the flavor of sesame chicken from a Chinese restaurant.  I didn't fry the chicken, I baked it instead - so it had a different texture - but it was still tasty.

This is excellent. The sauce is very rich if you're on a low carb diet this is not for you or not very often. But it's worth trying. My son loved it. Make extra sauce you'll need it:-)

This recipe must have been sent from gods because it is absolutely phenomenal. I'm not going to lie, this produces one of my very favorite meals. Though of course I ate so much I can hardly move and probably won't need another meal for over 24 hours, I think I'm in love. The only issue, the amount of sugar was far too great, and by adding only about 1/3 a cup it was set, plus baking the chicken instead of frying it in oil was not only a bit healthier, but a lot less messy. I've attempted to cook sesame chicken before, but never with results like this! I'll be certain to make this again.... once I completely digest...

Oh my goodness this was awesome! My daughter and husband both said it was the best chicken I have ever made. Only variation was I used vegetable oil (it was cheaper and I already had it). Thank you for sharing!

This was absolutely delicious!  I could not find any chili past so I omitted that and I also only used 1 TBS of the sesame oil after reading other reviews.  This recipe does make a lot of sauce, I only used half but froze the rest for when I make this again.  Yum!

"Perfect" pretty much describes this recipe.  Sadly, I will not be making it often, as my family likes it WAY too much and I wind up having to stand there for AGES deep frying 5 lbs of 1-inch chicken cubes.  That gets old amazingly fast.  :)

HEALTHY OPTION: I made the sauce and then added the uncooked chopped chicken (no breading) to it and threw it all in the oven at 400 for about 30 minutes.  Then I added about 2 tbsp and 4 tbsp of water to the sauce to thicken it.  It was great served over rice and with fresh steamed green beans!  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't batter and fry the chicken. Instead, I just made the sauce and put it on grilled chicken breasts. Absolutely delicious!

This wasn't anything special, really. And I ended up with the majority of the sauce left. I can't imagine using that much sauce for each serving. The batter wasn't on the chicken at all, so I added 1/4 c. flour which made for a very light, very thin breading. Only my eldest thought it was great, but he'll eat about anything. I guess if you're not real picky, that this is fine. It is a lot of time and work for ordinary though.

This was pretty good. However the recipe makes way too much sauce for 1 lb of chicken. I would not use all the cornstarch mixture next time either; the sauce was too thick.  I also only used 3/4 cup sugar and 1.5 cups of peanut oil in a wok.  Also makes 6 servings?? More like 2...

I was dying for a baked version of this, so I looked at some of the reviews and thought, "OK, no problem!"  But... there was a problem!  The baking of the chicken with the frying crust was just awful.  That said, the main thing I wanted was the sesame sauce recipe, and it was great!  I used brown sugar instead of white, and it was just lovely... the right consistency, and easy to make.  I guess if I want to go healthy and bake the chicken pieces next time I'll just bake them in a regular flour-egg-flour crust and then top them with the sauce.  But the sauce is a definite keeper!!!

Outstanding!  I did not deep fry the chicken...I baked it. I also used red pepper flakes instead of chili paste. Served over white rice.  I would make this again and again.  My husband liked it too.

Oh yes. OH YES!!!! I've been craving Chinese take-out for a few weeks now, but I hate the fat/sodium content of it.. not to mention the price (at least $30 for the 3 of us!!) This is delicious. Totally hit the spot. Used 3 T. whole wheat flour and 1 T. cornstarch in the batter. Also, ended up marinating the chicken for more like an hour, although I'm not sure the soy sauce/sesame oil/sherry makes much of a difference in the batter. Next time I'll probably just use a soy sauce/water mixture instead to cut costs even more.. not that this is expensive! Fried in peanut oil. If your oil is the right temp (365-370), your food absorbs very little oil. I used Splenda in the sauce, and cut back by a couple of teaspoons. Also, I upped the vinegar a bit. I used Sriracha for the chile paste, and next time I'll probably use 1 1/2-2 t. because my guys like hot food. Served this w/brown rice (Alton Brown's baked brown rice recipe.. try it!) and the Broccoli with Garlic Butter and Cashews from this site. Wonderful!!!!!!

All I can say is WOWZERS!!!  This is one fantastic recipe... my entire family loved it! Even the husband who really hates chicken!  I changed very little about the recipe... I used just 1/2 a cup of sugar (because we are watching our sugar intake levels) and rice wine vinegar instead of distilled because that is what I had on hand!  Best Sesame Chicken Ever!!! Definately Restaurant Quality and Easy!  Will become a regular on our table! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Made this for lunch today and the whole family loved it. I did omit the chile paste since I'm cooking for children but I did add just a small smattering of crushed red pepper. It was VERY sweet which is probably why both my boys gave it such high reviews but it was an over kill of sugar for a grown up. Next time I will reduce the sugar considerably and up the vinegar. I also doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did 2 pounds of chicken was almost completely eaten between the 5 of us.

This recipe is incredible!! I have never made a chinese recipe that actually taste like the food you can get in a restaurant. I made the recipe exactly as it said and it tasted amazing. The recipe is well written and easy to follow and includes ingredients that I commonly have in my kitchen. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

It was quite good, though I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar for the sauce and it was still too sweet for me. I didn't have chili paste, used vietnamese garlic chili sauce instead.Used two or three cloves of garlic.  No sherry, didn't have any. Don't forget the sesame seeds on top. I found it a bit greasy, but that's just the way it is. It was a hit.

Spectacular recipe.  The consistency of the sauce is excellent, and the chile paste gives it a subtle kick.  If you like it spicy (as I do) you can up the chile paste a little bit, but not too much.

This recipe calls for WAY too much sugar.  I'm a male college student and didn't enjoy the amount of sugar in this - I even went out of my way to create an account it was that bad. I went out on a limb to see if it somehow was all going to work out and all I ended up with was a headache and sore stomach. Reduce the sugar to maybe 1/4 cup and take heed  of the other negative reviews. I was skeptical of the light batter used to fry the chicken however was pleasantly surprised by the finished product.

I followed the recipe exactly except I fried the chicken in vegetable oil because I won't use olive oil to fry anything. The dish turned out very good and really hit the spot for my 13 year old son and I.   I am used to Sesame Chicken being spicy but this was really tame. Next time I make it I will double the chili paste and maybe add some red pepper flakes. Overall very good.

Definitely halve the sugar!  I will even try 1/3 cup sugar next time and I'm pretty sure it will still be sweet enough.  I always increase the garlic in almost every recipe I make, so I upped that to three large cloves.  I might add a bit more chile sauce next time too, because it could use a bit more heat.  It also seemed to lack salt, but that could be because I used low-salt soy sauce.   I used chicken tenders cut into 1 inch chunks and deep fried them 3 minutes in peanut oil heated to exactly 375 degrees F.  The result was crispy golden brown on the outside and moist and tender inside.  Perfect.

Really really good! I used about 1/4 cup less sugar and actually think I could have used even less. Just the battered fried chicken was great by itself, the sauce made it special. We ate it over rice. The kids loved it too - what more could I ask for?

Absolutely amazing! All three kids and my husband loved it too! the breading is delicious and so is the sauce! I refrigerated the chicken in the breading for about 1-2 hours as I made it early so that it wouldn't take as long later. I also reduced the amount of sugar by about half as others suggested. Thanks!!

It was amazing! My husband said it tastes better than P.F. Changs! Instead of using chile paste I substituted 3 teaspoons of hot Sriracha chili sauce. Served with rice and broccoli! Highly recommend this!

I am gluten free so can't have Chinese food at a restaurant.  But this more than satisfied my craving for Chinese food.  I think it tasted better than the Chinese Restaurant Sesame Chicken.  Not as sweet.  We used GF flour (purchase online) and Soy sauce w/o wheat (can find at Food Lion).  Thanks for giving me Sesame Chicken again.

Made this for the family, and they loved it! One note: I just put 500 mL of olive oil in a saucepan for frying, and that was enough.

Tastes just like Chinese Restaurant Sesame Chicken, and it's cheaper, probably healthier, AND you can be 100% sure it's not cat! Went over very well with all family members.. I used 3 average-sized chicken breasts and it was just the right amount for 6 people. I made egg drop soup to go along with it, and of course rice :)

I loved this recipe. Since I was trying to get a lot done at the same time, I used another reviewer's method of baking the chicken. I simply used cooking spray on the cookie sheet and spread bite sized chicken out on the tray. I didn't have sesame oil for the sauce, but the sauce was still impressive. I used brown sugar - probably just less than a cup when I made a batch and a half of sauce. This was delicious and easy.

Chicken turned out great!  We loved it but wish the white vinegar taste wasn't so prominent.  All and all very satisfied! Will definitely make again but with small changes to the sause.

This is my go to recipe for sesame chicken.  Its easier than restaurant versions because it doesn't require a second step of dipping the marinating chicken in a dry batter.  I prefer less coating on my chicken and this is just perfect.  I do use only half the sugar posted and more vinegar as I like more sour in the taste.

Ignored the chicken...used the sauce.  Cut down on the corn starch as it came out very very thick.  No need for all of that.

We loved this!!  It is quite possibly the best sesame chicken I've ever had.  I am a sauce person and with 2 pounds of chicken there was just enough sauce.  There is no need to double the recipe, in fact, I think you can halve it if you are really only doing 1 pound.  I did cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup and use rice vinegar in place of white vinegar and only used 1 Tablespoon of sesame oil.  If you are not putting spicy chili paste in your sauce the sugar will be overwhelming and you may need to go even lower, it is the balance of sweet and spicy that in my opinion was so great in this recipe.  I also only needed about 1/2 the cornstarch mixture to get my sauce to the thickness I wanted.  It thickens quickly so just add a little at a time until it is what you want.  It sits very nicely on a back burner on low waiting for you.  Thank you soooo much Doreen for this recipe!

I've always loved sesame chicken at restaurants and this was even BETTER!!  The chicken was moist and melted in your mouth. I disagree with other reviews, it is NOT too sweet. It's perfect! I did double the sauce and was so glad I did. It covered the chicken and broccoli. I want to make the chicken alone and use it in a salad with a toasted sesame dressing for a light fare this summer. The batter was delish!! I do think though next time I make this I will add red pepper flakes to put a little zing into it and make even more memorable!!  Thank you Doreen P!!  This recipe will be emblazoned on my kitchen wall as a standing delight and treat!!

I thought this was a really simple, straight-forward, good-tasting dish.  I ended up making minor alterations (slightly more cornstarch and teaspoon of brown sugar for the sauce) but other than that, it was amazing.  +5

This was delicious. To cut down on fat I followed another reviewers advice and baked the chicken instead of frying. I followed all the steps except putting the chicken in oil to fry.I baked the marinated chicken at 375 for 35 minutes. I didn't have chili paste so I sprinkled some cayenne pepper instead. I also did not add sherry because I didn't have any. I doubled the sauce recipe because I love extra sauce. Their were plenty of leftovers.

This really is 'perfect."  I have made it twice now and it has come out great both times.  I omitted the chili paste the first time because I didn't have any.  The second time around I added a few drops of hot sriracha chili sauce and teaspoon of catsup.  The results were excellent.

Fantastic recipe! I took the advice of some other reviews and used brown sugar instead of white. I also omitted the sherry and sesame oil because I didn't have any. I sliced the chicken breasts also instead of cubing them. It turned out fantastic!

My entire family loved this. I scaled this down to 4 servings; substituted rice vinegar for the distilled white vinegar and used red curry paste in place of the chile paste (because that's what I had on hand). I also just fried the marinated chicken in a bit of vegetable oil, which I recommend over olive oil. We served this over white rice with a side of steamed broccoli and some scallions for garnish. Delicious!

This is so good.  The sauce this makes is fantastic.  I would recommend using this and making all kinds of sesame dishes - shrimp, pork, whatever.  Serve with jasmine rice and sugar snap peas.  So delicious!

Tasted wonderful, could pass for the same stuff I buy for $8 a plate. That said, not a quick or easy meal and very high in calories even served with plain white rice and steamed veggies. Something to save for a special day.

Loved this recipe!! My husband loved it, too, and he is very picky. I did make a few alterations. I followed the first review and halved the sugar. It turned out plenty sweet enough but I think next time I may even try using 1/4 cup sugar to make it a bit healthier. I think it would be just as good. I also chose not to deep fry it but rather baked it in the oven as the first review suggested and it turned out perfectly after 45 minutes at 375 degrees. I may try stir frying it in a wok next time to achieve some degree of crispiness. I didn't have corn starch on hand so I omitted it from the first step and used four mixed with water for the second step and it turned out just fine. I also used organic boneless skinless chicken thighs cubed in place of breast meat. All in all, a really scrumptious dinner served over white rice!

I've been looking for a sesame chicken recipe for awhile now and I finally found it!
After reading some of the reviews I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup instead of a full cup. When I make this again I will add more sugar but not the full cup. I'd say that kind of depends on personal preference more than anything!
The sauce came out a little thicker than I would like. I would recommend less cornstarch and water I think maybe 1/2 of what it says would be better.
Also, instead of deep frying the chicken I pan fried it instead and it still turned out great.
Will for sure be making this again!

My family loved this. Here are some alterations I made: 
I didn't have chicken broth so I used water.
I didn't have chile paste so I used crushed red pepper flakes (but I would use a little less next time because it was a bit spicy.)
I also did not have sesame oil, but I did have walnut oil so I used that. I think you could use any oil really. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, instead of the 1 cup of white. I figured white would make it too sweet. 

The breading was pretty much null and void so the 1st step is more for flavoring I think, but that was fine with me. Made me feel like I was eating healthier. haha! My son came back for seconds.

This is totally a 5 star recipe in the Rose household. I made it 2 times in one week. I tweaked a few things after reading the reviews, I only used 1/3 cup of sugar and that was PLENTY, I used apple cider vinegar because that was what I had & I used Texas Pete hot sauce instead of chili paste. I also let my chicken sit in the fridge in the batter for about 30-45 minutes. I also didn't have to use all of the cornstarch for thickening. The second time I made this I omitted the sesame seeds and used finely sliced scallions/fresh green onions, we used to go to a Chinese restaurant that had scallion chicken & this was really close to it. We reheat leftovers the next day & it was even better. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe :-) ......I'm gonna make it again this week, I can't believe how much this tastes like the restaurant...well probably even better!!!!!!

Wonderful sauce!!  Due to limited time, I cheated and only made the sauce and poured it over popcorn chicken.  Kids couldn't get enough! After reading the other comments, I did reduce the sugar to a little over 1/2 cup, and it was perfect!

I will definitely be making this again

This was excellent! Followed recipe to the letter. I used the how to video because of the adjustments that were made by others and it is absolutely perfect. I plated a layer of rice, oriental stir fry veggies, chicken then poured a healthy portion of sauce overall. Thanks for this one!

Three stars from my crew.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and spread the sauce among nearly 2lbs of chicken.  My sauce set a bit too much and the end result was nearing jelly in texture.  The cooking method is great so if you are looking for a sweet main dish this is it!

I am just beginning to start cooking and found this recipe to be pretty helpful. HOWEVER! I changed up the recipe a bit. Instead of battering and frying the chicken, I used frozen chicken nuggets. (The breading helps the sauce stick to the chicken) As far as the sauce goes, I recomend using 3/4 cup of sugar, otherwise it's way too sweet. I also don't normally have chile paste lying around so I substituted the chile paste with a little less than a teaspoon of Masaman Curry Paste. (It comes in a blue container, I don't remember where it's from. The label said "Bright") Make sure all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed before you add the cornstarch that's dissolved in water. Then when the sauce and chicken are both done cooking, put all the chicken in a large bowl, pour the sauce on top of them and stir gently with a wooden spoon until all the chicken is covered with sauce.
This recipe is best served over white or fried rice with a side of egg drop soup. :) I made it for my boyfriend, who's a picky eater, and he liked it a lot. It makes for a really good, relatively cheap dinner. (as compared to the price of take out)

This is a pretty good recipe though I made a few changes:
1. I used flour instead of cornstarch for the sauce. I first made it with cornstarch and it had a disgusting consistency and a weird after-taste. I usually don't like cornstarch anyway and can taste it when it's in something. Two tablespoons of all-purpose flour worked just fine - I whisked it into the boiling sauce. 
2. I added more garlic to the sauce and some fresh minced ginger. I would actually try adding even more garlic next time. Some people said the sauce was flat. I would suggest trying these things (including the flour instead of cornstarch).
3. I actually preferred the chicken when it was more brown and crispy. This required really hot fat. I don't know what temp though as don't have a thermometer or digital fryer.
4. I used less sugar than the recipe says for the sauce. Instead I used 1/2 cup of sugar and a 1/4 cup honey. Brown sugar might be even nicer than white. I'll try that next time. I also used normal soy sauce.
5. I used organic chicken. Much better than non-organic. Tastes cleaner, fresher, and less fatty.
6. Could do with some suggestions for what veg to serve this with. An asian broccoli side would be nice.

We absolutely loved this recipe. The only complaint we had was that it was too sweet. We are a very low sugar household but we wanted to try the recipe as is the first time. We will definitely be having this more often, but with less sugar.

Tried this great recipe today, just substituted 1 tbsp of orange juice & a drop of vanilla extract for sherry. I have to agree with others it was a little too sweet so next time I will cut the sugar measurement into half, for the sauce I nly used 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken the mixture otherwise it would have been too thick and after frying the chicken I also dumped it into the sauce. Anyway, good recipe with a few modifications, I will definitely make it again.

Just made this for the first time.  I didn't have any chicken, so I used a cubed pork chop.  The coating was amazing, and the sauce was truly delicious.  The name suits this one.  Great job!

This sesame chicken was very tasty, but I agree with some reviewers that the sauce is too sweet and thick. I used 3/4 of the sugar indicated in the recipe (and 50% more vinegar) and my family found it to be too sweet (and we love sesame chicken). The deep fried chicken, by itself, is outstanding. I think the sauce would benefit from a few tweaks, such as less sugar, more soy sauce and vinegar, less cornstarch.

I just didn't care for this recipe. Personal taste I guess. The sauce reminded me too much of something that would come from the freezer at the store. So I guess it was too much work to have freezer taste. My boyfriend loved it but he likes a certain brand of stir fry "schezwan", maybe by green giant? Anyway that is what i can compare it to. To keep him happy i;d much rather buy it in the frozen food department and have him make it when i'm not home

Wow was this good!! Made extra sauce but cut sugar back, was still plenty sweet. Perfect amount of spice, glad I didn'tsub out the real chili paste. To fry the chicken, I used the outdoor propane burner that came with a turkey fryer, and a cast iron skillet. Took the mess and smell outside, it was worth the work. Still would like a nice indoor fryer but that would encourage me to make more deep fried food! This is a keeper!

I'm not much of a cook myself and this recipe looked a little intimidating at first but i gave it  go.
And i can't believe how easy it was.

The chili paste, sesame oil, and sesame seeds are very hard to find in American grocery stores. 
So for chili paste i substituted chili powder and water.
For sesame oil i substituted olive oil.
and for sesame seeds i used Parmesan cheese.

And it came out excellent...Very restaurant like.

I will be making this again soon.

This really is the best sesame chicken recipe ever. I have been searching for a long time for this! I read other reviews and followed their advice on the reducing the sugar and cornstarch mix, which I would def. recommend. 

The chicken turns out perfect and the sauce is to die for...I make this at least once a week now. Thank you so much!!!

Amazing. Now, I'm not one to ever really follow a recipe, but I did with this one. (Though I was more generous with the chile paste)  I did double the sauce recipe so I could save it.  **I did end up have to douse the chicken in flour before frying it, and then when my friend fried it up, he added more flour to the frying pan.  This truly is worth the 18 tiny measurements!  I usually don't like recipes that call for so many ingredients I normally don't have on hand. It was awesome and definitely making again!  Thanks Doreen!

This is the BEST Sesame Chicken Recipe EVER!!! We added red pepper flakes to the sauce during cooking to make it spicier. The search is over. This is a new favorite in my house.

Very easy and restaurant quality recipe- loved it. I upped the vinegar and used brown rice vinegar because I was out of white- came out great. I have also served this without the breading- I marinated chicken chunks in the sherry, soy, and sesame oil and cooked in the wok with some onions- still not "health food" but a little lighter.

Really crispy! The chicken remained really moist. The only thing I left out was sherry, as I didn't have any on hand. The recipe made more sauce than necessary, and it was really sweet, although I cut back to about half a cup and changed white sugar for brown. All in all, very tasty, and we served it on a bed of jasmine rice.

I really liked this recipe.  It was fast and easy.  I did half the sugar as some other people said they did.  I half the sugar on most all recipe's and I can't taste a difference.

Absolutely loved it! Made it for Fat Tuesday and will be dreaming about it for the rest of lent!! :) didn't have sherry, used apple vinegar instead.didnt have chili paste but added a few flakes of chili pepper instead.  It wasn't spicy at all, which was good for us since we're feeding a toddler. Scaled the recipe for 10, but after feeding  just three adults and said toddler, we only have a single portion left. Made a lot of the sauce though, which I'll attempt to freeze for use with other oriental dishes. Great recipe, not too difficult and tastes authentic! Just be careful when frying!!

Wow... this is my first ever review and I must say, this chicken is the best!  I have issues with standard Chinese Restaurant foods due to MSG and other preservatives.  I am very happy to have found a way to get the same taste but know what I am putting in it!  Made a few changes which really didn't alter the taste much.  I used 3/4 cup sugar, only 1tsp of sesame oil ( I really didn't like the smell of that stuff!) I also used rice vinegar.  I added the cornstarch mixture to the sauce a little at a time, using just under the recommended amount to make it to a thickness I liked.  But again... WOWee!!! Will definitely be making again :-)  Thank you Doreen for posting! oh and BTW... this recipe only made for 2 servings in my house....lol

Wonderful! Tons of sweet flavor.  I did have a lot of extra sauce though- I am going to take the advice from a review below and make some green beans with the leftovers.  Also, I cooked the chicken in EVOO instead to make it heathier.  This was very tasty!

Great recipe! I used some red wine and rice vinegar because I didn't have sherry + a splash of siraja and it was a huge success. Kept the sugar to 1/3 cup also, which is plenty sweet for me.

This was by far the best sesame chicken recipe I have tried. Since my husband likes extra sauce for his rice I doubled the sauce recipe, but only used 1 cup of sugar rather than 2. It was still sweet, but not overbearing. I will definitely make this again!

The look and taste of this was pretty darn good, but I am a slow cooker and the sauce thickened way too much while I was cooking the chicken. I think I'll stick to ordering sesame chicken.

This was pretty good.  Next time I will definately cut the sugar in half (if not more).  I didn't have sherry, so subbed water.  I did not use all the sauce, so no need to double the sauce.  Served with stir fried veggies and fried rice, for a great meal.  Thanks for sharing, Doreen!

Amazing recipe. This was absolutely perfect. The chicken came out crispy and juicy. For the sauce I used 3/4 cup of sugar and had no garlic on hand, so I had to substitute with garlic powder. Despite that, it was still amazing. I will definitely add and use this recipe again.

This is wonderful!  I've made it twice now & it has turned out perfectly each time.  I did modify the chicken however.  Instead of deep fried battered chicken, I coated the chicken breast in 2 Tbsp cornstarch, 1 Tbsp flour before pan frying.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is such a good recipe. We LOVED it. As we were eating it my husband said "this is a good recipe". We did cut the sugar down, just because we are not sugar heavy. We used half. VERY GOOD, recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!  I added about 1/2 tsp ginger and it tasted great over a bed of white and brown rice.

Wow! This recipe is awesome! This is my first time making it and it's so easy.  The only additional step I did is before putting the chicken in the batter, I coated the pieces with 1/4 cup of flour so the batter would stick to the chicken.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  No more take-out orders!

The title is correct! Just did this recipe with a group of older 4-H members(age 14 and up) with great success.  We did about 1 1/2 # of chicken so the batter may not have been on the pieces of chicken as thick as others found but it was a great hit!  I would say that 6 servings may be smaller than the size teens eat, unless you have several other items.  Our 1 1/2 lbs. just fed 6 teens and myself, along with egg rolls and rice.

Made this the other night & it came out very good. The only thing was that the sesame oil was overpowering. I would suggest using a 1/2 tsp of it or less to still give it that taste & smell of sesame seed. Or substitute with a different kind of oil. The only change I made was I use white wine instead of dry sherry & I couldn't find any sesame seed. But it still turned out great & will definitely make it again.

When I first made the mixture to put the chicken in I was alittle worried because it didn't look very good but when I cooked it it was amazing! Better than our local chinese food place. Next time I will add some broccoli and I really liked the idea that someone had in their rating to add red food coloring. I didn't have the sherry or the chili paste so I didn't add them or anything in their place. We don't like anything spicy so I was afraid the chili paste would make it spicy. It still came out so good that I will definitely make it again!

This recipe was awesome! My boyfriend and I have been looking for a Chinese recipe that we can make ourselves instead of going out to fast food, and that doesn't require a bunch of obscure ingredients that we don't have. This was actually better than quite a few fast food places. We read other reviews and made some changes, we put a little bit less than 1/2 c of sugar, a little bit extra chili powder, as well as a little bit extra soy sauce. We omitted sesame oil because we didn't have any, and it is pretty expensive. Hopefully next time we will be able to put that in. Other than that we didn't make any changes, and loved it!

This was FABULOUS! I doubled the chicken & batter, and used 1/2 the sugar, and it was perfect. I couldn't find chili paste so I used Chili Sesame Oil and it had such a great flavor. This will be a new family favorite!

This turned out well. I lowered the sugar and made adjustments to the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and garlic. Adding as much as I liked to please my own personal taste. I also used rice vinegar instead of white  vinegar and used leftover chicken from the fridge.

This was the best sesame chicken I've ever had! Most homemade recipes just taste like soy sauce and this is NOT like that! Thank you for sharing. This is one of my hubby's favorite meals!! The chicken is so moist it melts in your mouth. Love it!   PS> On several occasions I didn't have chili paste and I substituted it for chili powder and a little cayenne and I still had great success. :0)

WOW!...my family is raving!...for sure cut down on the sugar...I doubled the recipe and used 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 2...this is just as good as any we have ever had in a restaurant...we did not have the wine, so I just used water and it worked out just fine...yummy!!!

This was AWESOME!!! We really enjoyed it and thought it was better than our local take out. I did only use half the cornstarch mixture for the sauce and still thought it was a bit thick but thats really all personal preference on how thick you want your sauce. Another perfect recipe that I know will be requested in my house again!

This was super delicious!!!!!  My husband said way better than any Chinese restaurant!!!   I halved the sesame oil in the sauce cause I seem to think it's always overpowering but in this case it wasn't.  Next time I'll do the full amount.  Great, Yummy Recipe!!!

The sauce gets 5 stars, but the chicken only gets 3.  The chicken looked pretty, but it was not crispy and the flavoring was off to me.  However, the sauce was delish! The ONLY substitution  made was using light brown sugar, as for some reason I was completely out of white sugar.  I read that some people used less sugar, but I liked it with the full cup...I guess its just what you are used to.  Also, I guess I like my sauce a little on the thick side, because the amount of cornstarch was perfect.  All in all, I will definitely make the sauce again, but probably look for a better batter recipe.

This was amazing! It was the first time I ever made chinese food completely from scratch, and it amazed my family at how good it was. Definately restaurant quality. Couldn't find sesame oil where I live so had to leave it out, but never even noticed.

I loved this recipe!!! It was so easy to make,and very enjoyable to make as well! the only thing that I would change, is that I would double the sauce for it....I like lots of sauce. I served this with brown rice. All of my family loved it. Great Recipe.

This has become a family favorite! Everyone loves it and perfers it over the resturants. I have made this several times, we perfer to cut the sugar in half and have found it is good with white or brown sugar. I don't keep sherry in the house so i omitted it from recipe.The serving for 6 doesn't feed my 5 so i double it and it is just enough.Have not used chile paste (local store doesn't carry) and when i have company i fry in fry daddy and it comes out just as good. The longer you marinate the better. Kids like me to leave some chicken without sauce, makes the best chicken nuggets. Really a great recipe.

First time trying sesame chicken at home! Great recipe THANKS! I can usually tell if the recipe is what I am looking for at first glance! No changes were made that werent already mentioned. Good batter, good sauce. Just what I wanted to get out of this dish.

I was looking for a recipe to use my leftover fried chicken from a restaurant in and this was EXCELLENT. I made the sauce as written (except I cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup). This is the best sesame chicken I've ever made and this is the recipe I will stick with from now on. The chili paste adds an authentic Asian flavor so don't skip it. Contrary to what some other commenters wrote, this sauce IS NOT hot spicy. The next time I make it, I will add either more chili paste or some red pepper flakes for more kick.

I used 1/2 cup sugar and half the corn starch. Still was way too thick! I've had sesame chicken in about 40 different restaurants up and down the east coast of the USA. None were like this. Maybe they make it like this out west. In that case, I'm sorry!

perfect!  this was better than a restaurant!  I didn't use chili paste because I didn't have it and it was perfect.  Definitely worth the work and time.  My picky children loved it, too!  We'll have to double the recipe next time.

I wanted to make a surprise dinner party for my husbands 30th birthday. I know he loves sesame chicken and I wanted a REALLY GOOD recipe. This is it!! Do not be deterred by the sharpness of the hotsauce. There was not a piece left, and everyone was raving about it.   I did read most of the reviews on here before I started, and I made the following changes: for the marinade, I omitted the sherry. For the hotsauce, I used 1/4c. white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. I didnt have chili paste so I used Chili powder. And instead of the white vinegar, I followed other reviewers suggestions and used rice vinegar. Finally, when adding the cornstarch, start with 2 TBSP (it should be enough. only add more, if necessary.)  The original recipe needs some changes, (I made mine as per suggestions by other reviewers) since it was so AMAZING,I am giving it the full 5 stars. Totally made the party!!!

made it exactly as written.  Too much cornstarch.  The sauce was too thick and looked a dirty brown color.  No appealing at all.  Flavor was OK.  Not restaurant quality at all.  If I make it again, I'd change the recipe so much it would be the same recipe.

My family loves this recipe.  I have 5 kids who devour it every time I make it.  We do cut the sugar in half for the sauce, other than that we follow the recipe exactly.  My husband says this has to be in the rotation once a week.  We serve it over the restaurant style fried rice also found on this site.  The worst part of this recipe is that I may never get to order take out again!

My boyfiend and I trippled the recipe for 8 adults. Ours came out crispy and delish. We followed the recipe exacty as written. It was wonderful! we made it w/ a fried rice recipe that we also got off allrecipes. It was a lot of work but it was well worth it. Everyone loved it and we all agreed that it was better than Sesame Chicken from a restaurant.

This is delicious! Like most everybody else, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it was close enough to say this recipe is great. I made it 2 days ago and will do some more again today. Word of good food spreads quick here in the barracks and they want more! For the record, I used a couple hot little red thai peppers instead of chili paste and I added some ginger. I also split a cup white sugar and brown sugar (still only one cup though). My Philippina counter-part doesn't allow low-sodium soy sauce in the house either... so, it was all Silver Swan. Delicious.

Rave reviews!!! I think the next time I might kick up the heat in the sauce.  I didn't think it was too sweet as some other reviewers did. I also had no sherry or chili paste. I put about a teaspoo of dried chili peppers in the sauce, maybe that's why I didn't think it was quite hot enough It truly is almost exactly like eating Chinese out. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Thss was a great recipe!  I actually made it as written with no substitutions. I don't like heavily battered, fried foods so this batter was perfect for a light, crunchy layer on the outside of the chicken.  I quardrupled the recipe for a card tournament and it held up great in a crock pot.

Thank you for such an amazing recipe.  I had been looking for a good chicken dish and this one was absolutely delish.  The only change I made was instead of the sherry I used orange juice- even my pickiest of sons came back for seconds!!

This recipe turned out great! I've never had sesame chicken before, but my boyfriend said it tasted better than our local restraunt. I don't have a deep fryer, so I fried the chicken in a skillet.

This is truly the perfect sesame chicken! Recently are family wanted to try something new with chicken i had suggested sesame chicken, of course no one knew how to make it. So I wound up finding this one. At first I was skeptical because of how the batter tasted. As I progressed through the recipe I had more and more confidence. I had my Dad (the cook in the family) try it first. He loved it he said he could not tell the difference between the restaurant quality and this recipe.  I strongly recommend this recipe for anyone who think they can't make Sesame Chicken.

I enjoyed this recipe and followed it exactly. Next time I make this, I will cut the surgar to 2/3 cup and reduce the cornstarch alittle...the sauce was too thick. I would of loved it even more if the chicken would of stayed crispy, but even before I added the sauce, the little crispness it had was gone when the sauce was added. All in all good recipe to cure the sesame chicken "fix" I was needing!

This was AWESOME! I was very pleased with the results.  I added a bit more chili paste for some more heat. My family of 6 just raved over it. It's definatly a keeper!  Thanks!

I tried this recipe except I used tofu and veggie broth for a vegetarian version.  To be quite honest I couldn't stomach it at all the first night.  I tried it again the next day and liked it so much better.  Sometimes things just taste better the next day.  Overall not too bad but I probably will look for a different recipe or just stick with my neighborhood chinese restaurant the next time I want sesame tofu.

This dish is great! It was very easy to prepare and the family loved it.  I didn't have chili paste, I substituted 1 t. each of caynenne pepper, Hungarian paprika and chili powder.  I served it with steamed broccoli and rice.  Delicious!

What a great dish! I made this for a birthday dinner and had 4 disappointed faces when they realised they had eaten it all.  I didn't have chili paste, so I used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, and it worked great.  I will be making this again, and again, and again!

Too good! I didn't have a few ingredients so I improvised (olive oil instead of sesame oil, red pepper flakes instead of chili paste and it still had rave reviews. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I love sweets so it was perfect for me, but I can see how some would need to cut back on the sugar.

Fantastic!  I cut back on the sugar a bit and used chili powder instead of paste since that is all I had.  It was perfect--the whole family loved it.  Not very healthy but GOOD!

This is so good... I followed the recipe to a T and am so glad I did... I will be making this over and over again, but next time I make it I am going to try and bake the chicken just to try and make it a little better for me!

This was excellent.  My family all raved about it.  I didn't have chili paste so I used some Sweet Chili Sauce, a 1/4 cup and a 1/4 teaspoon chili powder.  Still tasted great.  Only need a dash of sesame oil as the recipe state in the batter.  For the sauce, I will decrease the sesame oil in half next time too.  Still 5 star rating. The batter is perfect.  It coats well and evenly.  Very Tasty!  This is a recipe to keep!  Thanks!

This was really really good. I just made it tonight for dinner. I doubled the recipe since I had more folks for dinner tonight than usual. This tastes just like the Chinese restaurant down the street. My kids loved it and so did the hubby. Even my three year old loved it. The ONLY thing I will change next time is not to use quite so much sesame oil in the sauce. I might just use one instead of two tablespoons. But this was phenomenal. I made it with steamed broccoli and white rice. YUM! It was even good on top of the broccoli! DEFINETLY a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome! so easy to do and taste so close to the place we eat chinese at. The only thing I recommend is if you are going to store some in the fridge it gets really thick and chunky so use a little less cornstarch than what it calls for.

WOW!  I am eating this sesame chicken right now, and it is truly delicious.  I am so happy to have found a sesame chicken recipe that is actually BETTER than the Chinese restaurant varieties I have had in the past.  I didn't change anything about this recipe, and it is great.

I did not have chili paste but used chili powder...next time will add a bit more for more kick! Followed receipe as directed did not find sauce too sweet from the 1 cup of sugar...my kids ate it up!! Served over white rice and broccoli on the side.

This is a great recipe. The kids and I made it togeather. They love sesame chicken and loved this recipe. We reduced to sugar by 1/4 and the chili paste by 1/2. We still got the great flavors but with less spice. I was going to take a picture of it but there was none left for seconds.

This recipe is truly a high quality restaurant style meal. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 C. and I added 2 tsps. of chile paste because we like a little heat. I took the advice of other reviewers and used peanut oil- which has a high smoking temperature, and is more traditional in Chinese cooking. I served it withe steamed broccoli and white rice, which the sauce tasted great over. Although it is a little time consuming it tasted alot better than Chinese takeout. My 2 year old loved it, and so did my husband- he wanted to know if there were seconds!!This recipe is definitely going in the rotation.

This saucce was awesome. I did add some minced ginger root and red pepper flakes, just becasue of personal preference. I'll definitely make it again. The coating on the chicken didn't turn out so well, however. Most of it managed to stick to the pan and what was left was kinda greasy. I'll keep experimenting.

This recipe is great. I did add slightly more sesame oil, substituted rice vinegar for the dry sherry, and also used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar. I also added 1/4 tsp more chili paste. When served with steamed broccoli, sautéed water chestnuts and white rice it is amazing. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This recipe was AWESOME!  We all loved it. I used about 3 lbs of chicken, so I think we did a triple or quadruple on the batter recipe, and I doubled the sauce, which was more than enough.  Better than a restaurant!

This really is perfect! I made this twice in two days. The first night, my kids gobbled it up and the next day they begged me to make it again. The first time I followed recipe as is; second time I cut sugar in half (we prefer tart) and thickened a bit more. Still delicious! Both times I added a bag of frozen stirfry veggies.I have been craving Chinese takeout but didn't want to spend on cheap food. This hit the spot for yummy Chinese with fresh ingredients at home.
 Very easy and fast to make.

I made this for my family the other night and I'm making it tonight as a Christmas Eve dinner. They absolutely loved it. The only ingredient I missed was the dark soy sauce, which was substituted for the low sodium soy sauce. I, also being unorganized, added the chili paste and garlic late but it turned out fine. Awesome recipe, highly recommend making it for your family.

Love this!!! I subbed rice wine vinegar for white, and added red pepper flakes because I was out of chili paste!! Devine!!! I also added just a tad bit of miso paste and kosher salt to the sauce and it made it much more balanced instead of just a sugary syrup

I’m rating this a 5 because it is a GREAT base for sesame chicken, tastes very close to take out. However, I didn’t find it perfect as is. Just a couple issues with it, one being as is, it is far too sweet (and yes sesame chicken should be sweet but it was beyond). I reduced to 3/4 cup when I made it and honestly next time I’ll go with 1/2 c. Second was too much cornstarch. Made as is it turns the sauce into a gelatinous goo/nearly solid. I will use less next time. Other than that, it’s great and I subbed a few things and added a little ginger and the taste was amazing. A lot of flavor in the meat and the other ingredients in the sauce are well balanced. I would use this as a guide to make it again.

After reading dozens of thoughtful reviews, I took into account all significant complaints and suggestions for improvement. That said, here are the adjustments made that created my favorable first experience: 

I used just under a 1/2 cup of Turbinado sugar (considering the sauce being too SWEET the most common negative review). 

Furthermore, the 2nd most recurring statement was this recipe yields exceptionally more SAUCE than is needed, but that was not an issue for me. Although, I had 1.5 pounds of chicken, I still could've used a little more sauce because I like mixing it with sticky rice. Speaking of the chicken: I used THIGHS after learning several other recipes recommend it over breast for a superior result in taste and tenderness.

Also, the chicken marinated for almost 20 hrs which leads me to the 3rd most popular complaint - the BATTER or there lack of, so I tossed it with a cup of cornstarch in a covered plastic container for a couple minutes to coat the chicken thoroughly before "deep" frying (I used 3 cups of Peanut Oil) not once, but twice. I was aiming to achieve that extra crunch; however, my chicken came out overcooked due to my zero experience in deep frying. 

Lastly, I took into consideration the potent quality of the Sesame oil, so I only used 1/2 tablespoon for the sauce and I only put 1/4 cup of cornstarch in the water but I only needed 70% of the mixture to thicken it just right. 

In conclusion, if I hadn't overcooked the chicken and if I had prepared

This was absolutely delicious and fairly simple to make too. I took other reviewers advice and baked the chicken instead of frying it. I also cut down the sugar to 1/2 a cup . This is definitely entering my dinner rotation.

I’ve made this twice and both times were delicious. First time I left out the chili paste (just because I don’t like spices, I also cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup and it was perfectly sweet.
Second time I made this I used London broil sclied thin instead of the chicken chunks. I also substituted beef stock for chicken stock and added the juice of one orange. Delicious.
I’m sure you can substitute shrimp, pork or even vegetables for the chicken.

My kids loved it! It was the perfect combination of sweet and slightly spicy. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and will likely only do 1/2 cup next time and add some bell peppers.

Oh my goodness! Thank you so much for this recipe! Hubby and I just finished eating and are enjoying our food coma! I had a tempura batter mix, so I used that for the chicken but made minimal changes to the sauce. I used 3/4C sugar and used rice vinegar instead of white. It was FANTASTIC! I served it with white rice,  steamed Asian veggies and crab Rangoon from this site. We will Definitely make this again and again!

My chicken didn’t brown as nicely as I would have liked to to . The taste was plain so I am not sure what I did wrong but would try it again.

This recipe really is perfect! First time trying a Chinese dish and this tastes exactly like it came from a restaurant. It was pretty simple to make, too. My husband and I really enjoyed it. This is definitely one of my favorites. Will be making this again soon!

Love it!!! I used half the amount of chicken so i divided the ingredients in half. I added sliced pineapples adds a nice flavour and used chili flakes instead of chili paste and a pinch of black pepper.

This is an excellent recipe. On Saturday February 16, 2019, I used pork meat cut into 1” pieces as, I was out of chicken breasts. The result? There was nothing left! Today, 3 days later, I’m making it again only, it was requested that I use chicken wings. So, chicken wings it is!

Was really good!! I used 3/4 cup of white sugar and rice vinegar instead of vinegar. Also added more chili paste bc I like spicy .  The recipe was really good. I was impressed . Tastes like an American Chinese restaurant sesame chicken.

One of the best chicken dishes forever, I made it two times in my home to follow your guideline and get the amazing taste. Especially the sauce tossed with chicken gives a delicious flavor. My observation regarding this dish is if you want spicier you must use hot sauce and red chili. Thanks for sharing with us.

Delicious ?? I will never be able to eat this takeout ?? again! My local grocer didn’t have Chile paste so I subbed with 1tsp ground cayenne but followed recipe as is otherwise. Once you gather everything it really isn’t as detailed as ingredient list let’s on and is definitely worth the effort.

Wow that was amazing.  The chicken was greasy at all.  I used only about an inch of olive oil.  I also used only 1/2 cup of coconut palm sugar.  We added steamed broccoli and jasmine rice as well and served the chicken over that with the sauce on top.

I  made this recipe as written at first.  I loved the tastiness of the batter-fried chicken pieces.  For the sauce, which was good but a bit bland, I added about one half teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  Excellent.

Excellent, and simple.  For my taste I added about twice as much vinegar and a teaspoon of grated ginger.  It was awesome without changes.  The second time I made it I added a teaspoon of peanut butter.  Totally different sauce and excellent!

This is delicious.  I used 1/4 cup of white sugar, half of the corn starch slurry, and double the chili paste. I couldn’t be happier. As another reviewer commented, I will also be using this method to make breaded meats. Someone said this was time consuming, but I thought this was rather easy and quick.

The batter will be thin, this is OK as its just meant to put a nice thin crust around the chicken. Also DO NOT USE BREASTS, buy  some thighs and de-bone (or buy boneless) and cut into small cubes. I modified this to be Gluten Free by using a GF Soy Sauce and GF all purpose flour. Still tastes amazing!

I did modify a bit because I had 3 pounds of chk. breast. To the marinade added a bit of garlic. Fried on stove top. To the sauce added a lot more sesame oil and soy sauce, added garlic, brown sugar, and a lot more chili paste. Turned out really great. Used brown rice as a side. The thing I did`t add is salt, because bullion cube I used as substitute for broth and soy sauce both are quite salty. Next time I will salt the chicken and add some more sugar to the sauce.

This was a really good recipe.  I did make the chicken a little differently though. I pounded chicken thighs thin, then marinaded in a ginger sauce and floured them and fried them separately then added them to the dish to heat them through.  A really good meal.

I made the sauce only to fix some bland take-out chicken.  Following suggestions I cut WAY back on the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Rather than using chile paste and a clove of garlic, and being lazy, I used one teaspoon of chili garlic sauce (Huy Fong brand).  I also used rice vinegar in place of the white vinegar.  Only used about half of the cornstarch/water mix to obtain desired thickness.   Awesome - a definite keeper, and really easy.   I will have to try the chicken recipe next time.

This recipe is fantastic. I have made a few attempts from other recipes and this has the flavor you would expect from your best take out.  I can adjust it for spicy to make General's Chicken or leave it alone for perfect Sesame chicken. I make a double batch of the chicken marinated and split. half I use this sauce and half my sweet and sour (family favorite meal)as the primary frying steps are about the same in each.  Made this last night and my family raved about this. I think the sweet and sour just fell to 2nd place after 15 years  in the top spot!

it was an awesome recipe! I did make some changes to it. I used half the sugar substituted fresh squeezed orange juice for water used about 1/3 of the corn starch and also added  chili garlic sauce about 2 tablespoons from the same company that makes Sriracha. I also cooked it down a little more to make up for adding less cornstarch it made the best sesame orange spicy chicken dish my family has ever had.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved it. I don’t have a deep fryer or a candy thermometer so getting the oil the right temp was difficult even with my conduction stove, but I got the oil around 275F & just let the chicken cook a little longer. Thanks for the recipe!! Will definitely make again!

I tried to make it sugar-free so there was a slight aftertaste.  The family still loved the dish.  I served with roasted broccoli and bell peppers instead of rice.  This is a definite keeper.

This was really good. I did do a few things different. I only added 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfect.  I also added salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper to the meat marinade.  Lastly I coated the chicken in a mixture of flour and cornstarch before frying and I fried the meat chunks twice.  My hubby was extremely happy about how that turned out.

This is a sauce only review. The only things That I varied upon in this recipe was that I used rice vinegar and I halved the sugar amount (for the sugar I used dark brown sugar). I thought this had a good depth of flavors. It tasted like takeout. I still thought it was too sweet (for my taste) even though I used 1/2 the sugar. If I make it again I would use even less sugar and probably just use dark brown sugar.

I tried this tonight and it was amazing, I used brown sugar and reduced the amount to 1/2 cup, added a touch more chilli paste and used rice vinegar instead of distilled white. My husband told me it was the best chinese meal he has had in about 20 years! Thank you!

Made it last night for a group of 10 people and it went down a storm and, although I catered for about 18, the whole lot disappeared. The chicken remained moist which had been a concern of mine.  Next time, I would reduce the sugar a little - others disagreed - but it is still a very, very good recipe.

This was lovely, although I agree with a lot of others that less sugar is preferred, but that is personal preference. Also, I put too much sauce on the first time and found it a bit sickly sweet. With my second helping I used it sparingly and it was much better. Basically even just have sauce in a dipping bowl and dip chicken pieces as you eat to control the quantity would work great. Overall, would cook again. Thanks!

The whole family loved it! It was  better than what I have had in good chinese restaurants (made me realize how freshly made chinese food tastes like and that a lot of the dishes I have had previously must have uses the pre made sauces). I reduced the sugar by half and added 4 cloves of garlic. My kids wanted me to pack this for lunch the next day.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I did not put so much sugar in the sauce and it came out great. I also left everyone to add their own hot sauce because I have little ones. Great recipe, highly recommended.

You can make this gluten-free. Can't mess this up. Fantastic recipe! I also sub coconut aminos for soy sauce to reduce soy.  I agree with others - for sauce, 1/2 the sugar.  So good! I think I've made this recipe over a dozen times. My family and friends like it THAT much.

fabulous recipe! i am addicted to chinese restaurant food and can rarely duplicate it at home. this recipe comes really close; however, it needed some tweaking. i decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup, used water in place of sherry and sriracha instead of chili paste. i also upped the amount of sesame oil and sriracha in the sauce, added red pepper flakes and ginger. Yum! the tempura batter is fantastic for other foods as well- sushi, veggies...

Loved this. The chicken was juicy and the sauce was thick and tasty.  I made it as written except that I couldn't find chili paste, so I used hot sauce instead,and I used 1/2 cup of sugar, as others suggested, and the sauce was perfectly sweet. I'm not good at pan frying, so after letting the chicken sit in the refrigerator, I browned it then baked it in a stoneware dish with oil in it for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  Once the number of ingredients gets over 5-6, I get a bit flustered, but this was very easy to do.  Will certainly make it again.

Very good recipe.  I followed it completely except i used more chicken broth since I just had a little left and tossed it in.  With that I just needed a bit more corn starch to thicken.  Made great leftover and was the best with fried rice.  Wife and I rate recipes and rate them uck or put on a call back list.  This was a definite call back.

This was amazing! I've made several Asian-style chicken dishes, and this was by far my favorite. The only thing I did differently was that I used hot sauce instead of chili paste, but it still turned out amazing. Defiantly will be making again.

I will definitely make it again! It was very yummy! My only trouble was that the batter didn't stay on the chicken when I fried it. Any suggestions? Thank you!

I used sunflower oil to fry, and had to substitute a little on the soy. All we had was "full sodium" so I cut it in half and added another tablespoon of water. I also substituted marsala instead of sherry and I was NOT disappointed. Sriracha for the chili paste (doubled the amount, though...)
I felt like I was changing the whole recipe, but I was so pleased with how it turned out I signed up for an account just so I could say so. Sesame Chicken is my go-to "safe" meal when I'm trying  a new asian-inspired restaurant and I would totally pay full price for this. 
Seriously. Do yourself a favor and make this. Right now. Go.

Too much trouble for the ultimate dish.  The chicken is EXTREMELY difficult to cook-the "batter" tends to make one piece stick to another, so it is nearly impossible to turn.  The temperature of the oil, along with the coating, leaves pieces tasting a little burned.  The sauce is very bland.  I doubt adding more vinegar would ever cut through that much sugar.  I was super disappointed, because I really want to be able to make my own Chinese food.  But this recipe is going in the trash can!

Gross. I expected a sesame/garlic/soy flavor. All I could taste was sugar. And that was after I cut the sugar in half, at the suggestion of other reviews. I can't imagine what the original recipe tastes like. The gelatinous sauce did not add an appealing texture. By the way, the amount of sesame oil in the sauce is excessive. It does not mix with the rest of the components in the sauce, it just forms a layer on top. Then the recipe has you boil it, which vaporizes most of the sesame scent/flavor. This is why every other recipe you'll find has you add the sesame oil at the end, after cooking is done, and only in tiny amounts. After giving up on the sauce, I tried eating the chicken pieces alone, and they tasted only like fried chicken. The breading did not contribute any flavor. My wife likes the dish, if that's any consolation...

I did the batter & baked it like emilyjane928 suggested.  It's fine,  but not as good as fried but a whole lot easier.  I cut the sugar way back too. Everyone liked it, definitely a keeper.

This is my go-to recipe for sesame chicken, especially as the dish is difficult to find in many UK chinese restaurants.  In fact, only last week was I able to find it, and I've been here for more than 10 years.  I tend to skip the sherry as I never have it on hand, but it's still absolutely perfect as is.

This was pretty authentic. My husband and 4 year old liked it too. I ran out of corn starch so substituted with flour for thickening the sauce and it still tasted great. I followed advice, and cut the sugar in half. I'll be making this again sometime.

Made this recipe for the first time today. Followed the recipe with the ingredients I had on hand. Used hot pepper flakes in sauce for the called-for chili paste; rice wine vinegar & brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers. It turned out delicious. Even received kudos from hubby.  Will make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It's really good, but it makes a lot of sauce for one pound of chicken. I reduced the sugar to only 3/4 of a cup and it tasted perfect. My two year old ate every bite.

Because of others' recommendations I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and I used rice vinegar instead of white for less "bite".  This was great!  My daughter thought I hid the take out boxes, and hubby said it tasted like "the real thing"; They both think I cheated!  Everyone in my family loved it and we'll definitely make again.   Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Came out perfectly. I thought the sauce was a little bland so I kicked in a little extra chili paste while it was simmering. Served over rice.

This is delicious and my husband has me making it once a week. Just a few things I did differently, I cut the sugar in half on the sauce, cut the slurry in half, and doubled the chili paste-YUM!

Incredible! I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT for the following two things...

1) I used a 1/2 cup sugar. 1 cup is way too much. 
2) I used only 1/2 of the cornstarch/water solution and just let it simmer for 5 minutes or so to thicken it perfectly.

Besides that, AMAZING.

Good, a slightly different taste profile then we usually do! Used 1 3/4 sugar, next time I will bake because I always manage to burn myself on the oil.

This was terrific. I cooked the chicken in chicken broth. Next time I'd reduce the sugar and maybe add more chili paste. This was great as is, though.

The batter on the chicken was a little thin, so I will increase the corn starch next time to  thicken it and have more batter cling to the pieces.  Conversely, the sauce was fairly thick.  I added additional water, but will adjust that more precisely next time as well.  I used just half a cup of sugar for the sauce and we thought it was adequately sweet and tasty.  I saved half the sauce for another time, and we still have plenty of sauce on our portions.  Overall, we felt like this was a good starting point, and we will tweak it to suit the tastes of our family.

I need to know if the cornstarch  1/4 cup to 1/2 cup water is correct?  The sauce was so thick and gummy it was not edible.

Can someone check the ratios to see if this is correct?

Very good and so unhealthy lol. I actually didn't have sesame or sesame oil at the time but it turned out great anyways. And the chicken itself even before the sauce tastes great

I have made this several times and it is my FAVORITE to cook and eat, even better than local Asian restaurants. I have made some changes: 1/2 amount or even less sugar; 2x or more vinegar in the sauce. Hot pepper to taste (jalapeno, ref chili, even buffalo sauce!) I also add grated fresh ginger; 3x the amount of garlic. I double or even triple the sauce and save it in the fridge for later usage.

This recipe is absolutely excellent!  The whole family fell in love with it, just like the local Chinese restaurant.

I used rice wine vinegar and omitted the sherry (didn't have any).

This is definitely a 5* recipe. I've been making it since '08.  It is a bit elaborate and requires a lot of unique ingredients -  I try simpler/faster recipes and they always disappoint and I end up back with this one :-) I concur using an oil better suited to higher temp to cook these and cutting the sugar in half. It stands up to using GF flour and aminos to make it GF. Writing this review it's hard not to go make a batch - truly a five star recipe, even without modifications.

This tasted great. As the author and others have said, I could have reduced the sugar--maybe by half. I used curry paste instead of chilli paste because that's what I had. I added a bit of red pepper for some kick. I did not use all of the cornflour--maybe half. I also took the suggestion of another reviewer to bake the chicken. It was good. Next time, I will try to use a method to make the baked chicken a bit more crispy--perhaps reduce the liquid in the coating. The chicken was still excellent. I got out of control "tasting" and ate a few pieces straight from the pan without the sauce... Served over basmati rice. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe really allows you to change a few things around and still end up with a great dish.  Like so many others, I baked my chicken instead of frying it.  I used thighs for the added flavor.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the full cup of white sugar and substituted rice wine vinegar for white vinegar (although I might try the other way to cut down on the sweetness some).  I also used a little extra red chili pepper paste.  We really enjoyed it.  Play around with it.  I bet you will love it.

This recipe is awesome! I am extremely excited about it. I did have some thoughts though. I find it hard to believe many people will get 6 servings out of this. I fed 7 adults 36 servings + lo mein + pepper steak and the chicken was completely gone! I also like the sauce thicker. I think I added 3 times the amount of corn starch to it. I also cannot believe I am saying this because I LOVE sauces, but I'd say the recipe makes 6 times as much sauce as you need. I have a bunch in my freezer right now. It's still very worth trying.

We ended up substituting the sugar for Honey (it's sweeter so you can add UP TO the 1cup, but it will be very sweet). 
This thickened the sauce and made the recipe to die for. One of the best and easiest Asian chicken recipes to make at home. 

Also ended up substituting the Vinegar for a fancier variety. Made this using both Pomegranate vinegar and Peach/Ginger vinegar.

Great taste.  The toasted sesame seeds made this awesome.  My batter was a little thin, so thicken it up with more flour if needed.  Better than any Sesame Chicken I've had in the restaurants.

Personal notes: Serving sizing for chicken portion of recipe is waay too small. I set for 14 and it barely fed four (four whole breasts used). It is probably also the case that the sauce sizing is waay too large.

The only change I made was that I baked the chicken as another home cook did and I used 3/4 brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar. It was awesome! My fiance said it may be the best sesame chicken he's ever eaten and my daughter said it was the best chicken she's ever had!

This was not what I was expecting. I halved the sesame oil, and it was still too strong for me.  The sauce was way too thick even after adding extra liquid.  I will not be making this recipe again.

I searched for just the right recipe for sesame chicken and this is it.  Whenever I invite my family over for dinner and they know I am making this, they never hesitate to come over.  They even want me to make this for holidays!  My dad, who is a picky eater, didn't try it the first few times I made it.  We finally got him to try it and now, he is as eager as everyone else to eat it!

Awesome! Way better than any take out I've ever had. I subbed three table spoons of brown sugar for the cup of sugar and cut way down the amount of cornstarch to one tablespoon and it was perfect. Definitely try it!

Have made this many times, always perfect, can increase the heat with chile paste and sriracha sauce. But always turns out well.

This recipe is delicious & quick and easy to put together! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I did not have any white vinegar. I subbed rice wine vinegar, which added to the sweetness of the sauce. I made one other change- I doubled the sauce, and we still devoured every last drop! I will follow the advice of other reviewers and bake it next time to make it a bit healthier. Definitely a keeper!

My husband and I really liked this, I would have given it 5 stars but for a few things....we really like veggies, I did add some sliced red peppers, we also like heat.  Upped the chili paste too a tablespoon, I don't know if it was the addition of the red peppers that made it kinda sweet or not.  It will definitely go on the list of things to make, however I think in future I will use less sugar....

The best sesame chicken I have ever had at home.  No modifications other than I was out of sherry.

Fantastic recipe.

One note:  I doubled the recipe for 2 pounds of chicken.  The batter definitely needed to be doubled, but not the sauce.  As written, the sauce is easily enough for 2 pounds.

I doubled the order and didn't have any leftovers.  Everyone had seconds.  The only difference was cutting back on the heat.  The family doesn't care for hot spicy foods.   I got olive oil almost to smoking before Putting in the chicken and the chicken did not absorb the oil.  Also used de-boned chicken thighs instead of chicken breast.  This is a winner.

I put the cut up chicken into the crock pot. Then I made made the sauce, with the dry sherry, and poured it over the chicken. Cooked on high for about 2 hours and it was perfect. Since not all of the sauce was needed in the crock pot, I thickened it with cornstarch on the stove and served it on the side. Big hit with everyone! Cook rice and make a salad and dinner is done.

This is the best sesame chicken recipe.  Without reading any reviews I knew to use brown sugar instead of white.  It has more depth to it.  I also baked this at 400 for 20 minutes.  However, the chicken gets stuck to the pan.  Next time I will try a different method.  The sauce does not need to be cooked so early.  Mine cooked down a lot while the chicken was cooking so next time I will wait to start that process.  This recipe is really amazing though.  I didn't have sesame oil or vegetable oil.  I used olive oil in place of sesame and melted coconut oil in place of vegetable and it was still amazing.  Picky husband loved it.  One of our top 5 and going into rotation for dinners on the regular.

Made this dish numerous times and every time it's wonderful! Add some Chili Paste to make it a quick and easy General Tso or add just a little to kick up the spice. One of my favorite recipes on here!

This is phenomenal.  I made some minor changes:  I used a heaping 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of plain sugar.  I used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I didn't have chili paste, so I used some sweet chili sauce and a dash of Sriracha.  I added a little extra sesame oil.  I'm a vegetarian, so I used tofu instead of the chicken and vegetable stock instead of the chicken stock.  The extra breading  sauce for the chicken I used as a dipping sauce for steamed dumplings.  Will definitely make again!

I didn't have chicken broth so I just used water. I also used seasoned rice vinegar  and toasted sesame oil. I cut down sugar to 1/3 and added some red pepper flakes to the sauce to give it more spice. This dish turned out very good. The chicken was a bit crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.

The Sesame Chicken was great! From now on my family will be eating homemade Sesame Chicken. It could be improved by adding fresh green onion on top. We will be adding Sesame Chicken to the family favorite meals menu and recipe book. Thanks for sharing.

I only made the sauce as I don't deep fry,  I baked the chicken instead. I used bl/sl thighs that I baked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, poured off the fat/juices, poured on the sauce then baked 10 minutes, turned over and baked for another 10 minutes. I used only 2 tbsps brown sugar instead of white, Sambal for the chili paste and 2 tbsps of cornstarch. The chicken was very tasty, family really enjoyed. Next  time make 1.5 times sauce to have extra.
***sauce: 2 cups warm water, 2 pouches chicken Herbox, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/4 cup light soya sauce, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tsp each Sambal, minced ginger and minced garlic, 1/4 tsp each pepper, garlic powder and onion powder, and 1/4 cup cornstarch. Heat in microwave at 1 minute intervals, whisk each time, then pour over chicken.

I just HAVE to tell everyone. I printed this recipe in April 2012 and cannot even count how many times I have made it since then! I have doubled the recipe, and even tripled it to feed a large group. The ONLY thing I changed recently...is that I cut the chicken to the size I want ahead of time and freeze them. This has cut down the cooking time night of significantly but I do not change one single thing about this recipe!! It is PHE-NOM-INAL!

Excellent recipe!  My only gripe is that the recipe for sauce made so much.  I doubled the chicken part of the dish, kept the sauce at 1 batch and I still had about a cup of sauce leftover.  I also added 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar to the sauce to get a bit of a bite.  I will definitely make this again and make half the sauce recipe.

Delicious recipe. A little bit too sweet for my liking so on the next run I'll add less sugar and maybe throw in a chilly pepper into the sauce to make give it a little kick.

This recipe is delicious, and I would definitely recommend it to other cooks. I added a little more garlic than called for, and also substituted grenadine for sherry ( because I didn't have any laying around the house). The last thing that I would recommend would be to cook only one battered chicken piece at first to find the correct temperature, I ruined a few before finding out that my oil was to hot. And The chicken cooked better at 350 rather than 375. Overall this dish is delicious and I will make it again.

I used 3 pounds of chicken for this recipe, so I tripled the sauce. I didn't batter or fry my chicken, but just sauteed it in some olive oil. I did miss the delightful crunch I knew it would have had, but it was healthier...

I used 3/4 C light brown sugar for every 1 C granulated sugar called for, 1 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar (total), 1 Tbsp sesame seed oil (cause that's all I had left), and I used 1/2 C cornstarch for thickener rather than the 3/4 C that I would have used if I'd followed the recipe straight through. I also added the zest and juice from 1 mandarin orange. 

Came out very savory and satisfied my craving!

Help please! The end result was good but a few pieces of chicken into the dish the chicken tasted horrible. It was something in the batter that possibly mixed with the cooking oil. I used vegetable oil to cook it in and it tasted almost like the sesame oil smelled. And that was even before I put the sauce on. My 8 yr old loves the Chinese food version and thus was my attempt at a Saturday night meal. At first she said it was great! Then she said after a few pieces it wasn't so good anymore. Shes picky so i figured she was being extra...i made my plate sat down and after my second bite of chicken i was tryjng to peel the batter off. The sauce on the rice was fine but it was the batter on the chicken. I dont know what I did wrong. I lacked as much soy as needed so I used half soy n half teriaky sauce and I added ginger and left out the chili paste because I couldn't find any in the store. I used crushed red pepper flakes and a small amount of balsamic vinager for color in the sauce. I'd like to try it again because it started off good. But was it the vegetable oil I tried it in or the sesame oil brand I bought? It was the only one in the store so no other options. Or the lack of soy sauce or vinager?

yummy,  changes made to the sauce were adding 1.5 tsp of fresh minced ginger before boiling (gave it great flavor),  1/8 tsp cayenne instead of chili paste as i did not have any, 1/4 cup total sugar, decreased sesame oil to 1 teaspoon,  and 2 tbsp cornstarch to 4 tb water instead of the full amount.  fried in canola oil .  served with rice and steamed broccoli...very good! thanks

My kids loved this recipe! They said it was better than any restaurant style sesame chicken.  I cut back on the sugar and it was perfect.

I baked it for 15 minutes.  The breading was very runny so the chicken had to be scraped off the pan.  I decided to fry it even though it was pretty hard and without thinking about it, I put all of the chicken in the sauce instead.  This actually turned out to be better than if I would have fried it, because It softened the chicken.  I left it to simmer as the frying instructions called for and then  put all of it in a casserole dish and set on the stove to stay warm.  I served it on rice and everyone thought it was very good.    The chicken was soft, but still very tasty.  I had bought a pound and a half of chicken to accommodate the guests, so I  doubled the breading mixture and adjusted the sauce based on my taste.  For the sauce I used less sugar and only a teaspoon of vinegar.  I added an extra tsp. of chili paste which gave it a little more of a spicy flavor.  Next time I will add more corn starch to make the breading mixture thicker.  I may fry in peanut oil as suggested by someone else.  She had said not to use olive oil as that causes more health problems than vegetable oil when  frying.  I bought and forgot to use toasted sesame seeds, but having them already prepared saved me time.  Quite delicious and actually I preferred the softer chicken.

Listen up! :) 
My teens LOVE Chinese food, so I thought I'd give this a try, but I took a short cut... or  two. 

I had (TraderJoes) frozen battered (orange) chicken pieces in freezer, and baked according to instructions while making sauce.  ( I tossed the sauce that came in the bag. )
I halved recipe for sauce, bc of amount of chicken I had on hand. I also substituted brown sugar for white, and sweet chili paste for super spicy chili paste. I used white vinegar. Grating the garlic clove into the pan, and adding the ingredient list took 3 minutes.  I also substituted chicken stock to mix slurry of corn starch, bc it was right there on counter. :) 
    The amount of corn starch mixture was WAY  too much. 
So add slowly, about half, as it thickens you can always add more to your liking. 
I left sauce for a few minutes while getting rice ready, then tossed it with chicken in a big stainless bowl, then plopped it atop of rice.
Total time: 25 minutes.
One word: DEVOURED.  
Happy cooking

My hubby LOVES this! The kids are almost groaning when he decides on dinner ideas, since this one is at the top every time. It is very, very yummy. I've tried many recipes and this one works beautifully. I followed the directions, except I used peanut oil in my deep fryer. The "breading" does seem too thin, I though that too the first time. But it cooks up to a light, not too thick, not too thin coating in the chicken. We use this breading recipe (minus the sesame oil) for chicken nuggets. Yum!

These were pretty good. A little on the sweet side but nothing a little more chili sauce couldn't fix. It does not reheat well though.

Agree with most of the others, the sauce was amazing! I used 3/4 C sugar and added an extra tsp of chili paste only because we like it sweet & spicy.  I also used canola oil instead of olive oil since I didn't want the taste of olive oil to overpower the other flavors.  Lastly, I tried the baking method, baking it with the batter first then adding the sauce last...which I won't do again. The batter had a really good taste but it turned out gooey.  Next time, I'll either bake it without the batter or just go with the frying method as the recipe calls for as I'm sure that's the best way. :) Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 3/4 cup of sugar and the sauce was still sweet. All other ingredients were per the recipe.   The sauce really got thick ( almost pudding-like) so when I make it again I'll cut-out some of the cornstarch.  This was a most excellent dish and worth all the work. I served it over a bed of rice.  10 yums out of 10.  (:

Just as good as our local take out. Now I can make it at home with my own ingredients. Made a double batch and the leftovers were still great. A bit sweet but I was able to level it out with heat and salt.

We loved this dish! Followed almost exactly but used 1/2 cup sugar, a splash more of vinegar, and cayenne pepper because we didn't have chili paste. I will be making this again..  and again! Pares nicely with broccoli.

The batter is flavorful but I marinated it for 6 hours. I rolled the chicken in potato flour before frying so it's still crispy even after pouring the sauce. Yum!

Yes, a lot of sugar, but if you want restaurant tasting food, you got it here!  I've been making this recipe for years, but had to make it quicker, so now I use baked popcorn chicken instead of the recipe chicken, which lacks taste but puts dinner on the table in less than 1/2 hr. You can alter the sauce recipe and it still works out great.

My stepdaughter who can be pretty picky absolutely loved this dish! In addition to the marinade/batter, I dredged the chicken in a wet beer batter. It made a nice thick coating on the chicken. I also didn't add the sauce until right before serving to avoid the chicken getting soggy. Great recipe!

I don't think this is worth the effort and dishes for what you get in return.  It's okay.  Maybe I'll try to bake it next time and see.  I did only use 1/3 cup of sugar and it was still a bit much for me.  I think there is also WAY too much corn starch to thicken this.

This was fabulous!  My daughter even told me it was better than her favorite restaurant's.  This is a recipe I will use for years now.  I can't believe it's been in my recipe box since 2011 and I've just now tried it.  Shame on me.

I baked it also (375 for 40 minutes, turning once.) I added the sesame seeds at the end and broiled it for 2 minutes to toast them. I also only used 1/2 cup of sugar. Couldn't find chile paste so I used chile garlic sauce. It was ok. I added more sugar to my sauce after tasting it. Sadly, it did not pass my toddlers approval, and she LOVES sesame chicken.

I made the changes suggested by reviewers,  I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still too sweet, I'll make it again with 1/3 cup brown sugar. Also, I added julienned carrots that I mixed in with the chicken and sauce.  I skipped  the sherry and sesame oil because I had none and it still turned out great. I will add cashew nuts or broccoli next time. I served it with brown rice.

So good! I used 7oz chicken, cut the recipe in half and still had too much marinade and sauce.  I might try to cut the recipe by 1/4.  In the future I will try baking the chicken and cutting the sugar in half.  I didn't have dark soy sauce so used regular soy sauce but want to try the dark soy sauce.

This one of my entire family's favorite recipes I have made including children! My only problem (when there rarely has been leftovers) is trying to reheat because the sauce gels after refrigeration. I am guessing there is some trick that I have not learned for this dilemma.?

I did not prepare this as written; I took the suggestions of several other reviewers and cut back on the amount of sugar; I used only 1/2 cup instead of one full cup and used brown sugar instead of white.  I also didn't have any chili paste so I substituted Sriracha.  The batter recipe for frying the chicken is perfect!  There's plenty of sauce and I dipped the chicken in it instead of pouring it over the top.  This is a keeper!

Absolutely awesome! Quite simple to make, we used our deep fat fryer to fry and we only had canola oil and used Brandy in place of the sherry-tasted great! Could cut back on the corn starch as the sauce set up quite thick. I ate it again the next day, and it was still great!!

Best recipe ever! I used rice vinegar instead of white, and rice wine instead of sherry - seemed more appropriate since it's an Asian recipe. It was incredible! I did try baking it once and it was a disaster, but when I fre in coconut oil it's perfect!

Followed the directions exactly.  Yes, more sauce than necessary but easier to remove than add what you don't have.  Will definitely make this again and again!

I have prepared  this twice. The first was a test run. I used mostly what I had on hand so I made a couple of minor changes. I used vegetable oil to fry, I used half white and half brown sugar, regular soy sauce, and not being able to find anything that was labled chili paste, I tried Thai red curry paste which has a few other ingredients added to the chili including lemongrass and ginger. Other than that, I followed the recipe.
My family loved it! A couple of weeks later I made it again for a house full of teen girls. I tripled the recipe and the girls helped prepare. This time the chicken spent over an hour in the batter and it was even better. Every plate was cleaned. Served with some Jasmine rice and steamed broccoli, you can't go wrong with this one. After reading several reviews, I'm going to try making it next time with rice vinegar but this is my go-to recipe for sesame chicken!

This really is the best sesame chicken ever! I love sesame chicken and I eat it at restaurants all the time, and this one is way better. It is amazing! The chicken was tender and crispy and the sauce was delicious. I only added about half the sugar probably. So so good! My new favorite recipe for sure! Thanks for sharing :)

On the advice of other reviewers, I cut the sugar to 1/4c. of brown sugar and that was plenty. I also added a splash of Shaoxing wine and some rice vinegar. The flavor overall was good, however the chicken lost all of its crispiness once tossed with the sauce. Overall fairly tasty and a good point to start from.

Delicious! I started my rice cooking at the same time as the chicken and dinner was ready in less than thirty minutes. Serve it with stir fried veggies and the restaurant style egg drop soup from this site and you'll never need take out again!

I have to say, this "Perfect Sesame Chicken", was mouth watering. I love it. It was just the right flavor and seasoning. My family enjoyed it, and I didn't take away or add no other ingredients. I wouldn't change anything. I rate this recipe 5 stars *****. Thanks- Juanita Williams.

This is was good! I baked the chicken for 47 minutes at 375F and poured a bit of grape seed oil over the top before going in. It was moist and delicious! Next time I will not pour any oil over the top, there was no crust on my chicken and I had to blot off a lot of oil. I made the sauce as is, and it gets super thick. Next time I won't use as much cornstarch and less sugar. I will be making this again!

I just sauteed the chicken, rather than deep fried it. I used 1/4 cup of sugar, and it was fantastic! I couldn't believe how quickly it was eaten.

This is a great recipe if you are looking for a chinese food sesame chicken. Add less corn starch than the 1/4 cup then work your way up if you need more.. I did a couple tbsps of corn starch and that actually was enough. I doubled the sauce, the batter, and the chicken and it was perfect. Will be making it again. Had visitors over for dinner and it was all gone within 15 mins! should have made more!  served it with broccoli and jasmine rice.

Two things that you want to do when you make this recipe in order to avoid rubbery chicken. First, trim the fat and skin off of the chicken breast. Even a thin layer of fat can be chewy or tough. Second, and this is probably most important, let the oil reset. Check the temperature to make sure that it is hot enough before you drop in your second or third batches in. If the oil is hot, it will cook the chicken thoroughly any quicker time cleaning that your chicken will stay juicy and not dry and rubbery. Finally, as a sidenote, I use one and a half to 2 inches of oil at the bottom of a 12 inch skillet. It tends to cook everything little bit more evenly.

Oh, yum, yum, yum!!! This was great. In my opinion, the dipping sauce makes it. I, like the top reviewer of this recipe, baked mine in the marinade. 375 for about 30 minutes. I cut my chicken into chunks, which is why it didn't take 45 minutes. My husband scarfed this down! Thanks for a definite keeper!

Made as written except I pan fried instead of deep fried.  Delicious!
10/15 - Made this again.  It made WAY more sauce than needed.  Half it next time. Also, use 1-1/2 T. sesame oil and only 3/4 c. sugar

Made this tonight for dinner and it was a lot of work for the outcome.  After reading reviews, I decided to use half the sugar, and half the sesame oil.  I also used half of the cornstarch slurry.  The sauce came out good, but what disappointed me was the chicken breading.  I was expecting a thicker crispy batter.  This was very thin, and not very flavourful.  I might try this again and play around with the batter a bit.

OMG!!! This was the best Sesame Chicken I have ever had!! I was a little skeptical at first with the chicken batter. I was a little worried with the sauce as well. I tasted it after it thickened up and it was really spicy hot. But once I added the chicken and some veggies. It was PERFECT!!! My family loved it with some bell peppers, broccoli, and string beans we got at the Farmer's Market earlier that week.

Very good! Lots of work so would next time prepare chicken much earlier and let marinade. Also used canola oil better because it's better suited for high temp. This was as good if not better than anything we've had from a restaurant.

I have a corn and wheat allergy so this is what I did.... Mmmm....    I boiled a chicken and just shredded the meat to use instead of frying meat.  I used the broth from it also. I substituted equal parts tapioca starch for the corn starch, omitted the chili paste, used regular soy sauce, garlic powder instead of garlic, added the sherry it called for into the sauce.  I used only half the sugar it called for and I used "sugar in the raw."  I also added chopped green onions to it and served it over cooked, riced cauliflower.)  Yum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was amazing. Tasted better than a restaurant and I'm a terrible cook. I didn't have chili paste so I used sriracha. I also had 2 extra large chicken breasts and doubled the entire recipe. Next time I will only double the batter and use 1/2 the sugar in the sauce

This recipe is quite yummy, even my picky eaters liked it!
Here's what I did differently due to time:
I bought precooked breaded chunk chicken that heats up in the oven. While that was in the oven I made the sauce according to directions. When the chicken came out of the oven I poured them into a serving bowl then sprinkled sesame seeds over them and tossed. Then I poured the sauce over them and served with lo-mein and veggies.

This recipe was amazing! I cooked for a family of 8 and it was gobbled up! I have to say, I followed the video and lessened the amount of sugar, wasn't for me! Next time I make it, a full cup of sugar will be added :)

This was a great recipe, though I did make some changes. As others had suggested, I cut the sugar down to 3/4c, and used brown sugar instead of white. 

I also used sriacha instead of chile paste, just because I find chile paste easier to overdo and make it *way* too spicy. I also used a bottled teriyaki sauce instead of soy - only because I was out of soy sauce, but it was fantastic. Subbed rice wine vinegar for the white vinegar, and I think the dish turned out well. Husband inhaled it!

Definitely a good recipe, and one that is easily modified to suit one's tastes.

I loved this recipe will definitely make it again.  I used just the chicken breasts tho, I did not bread it, i let the breasts marinade in just the sauce for a half hour, i also used brown sugar instead of white.  I did double the sauce up too because i added broccoli, green beans, onion, and squash.  This is my new favorite sesame chicken!!

Always my go-to Chinese food recipe. I dust the chicken pieces in extra flour and cornstarch before dropping them in to fry to make the pieces extra crispy. The chicken pieces also freeze really well for future quick dinners.

Utterly amazing recipe.  I cannot find this dish since moving to Britain, and now don't have to wait until my visits to the states to enjoy it.  I subsituted the flour for gluten free flour for my daughter.  I omitted the sherry and baking soda, as I didn't have either on hand.  However, even with this, it was still fabulous.  Definitely a keeper!

This came out awesome. I didn't use a whole pound of chicken b/c I was only cooking for two and had a ton of the sauce left over. I would make less of that next time. Also while cooking it doesn't smell amazing but it comes out great. Definitely doing this one again.

Good, but sauce needs more of a savory flavor or something. Too sweet, even with reducing sugar to 1/2 cup instead of one cup. Next time I'll use just 1/4 cup & might add some ginger & extra soy sauce because it definitely needs more flavor.

Made this for dinner last night and doubled the recipe, I forgot you can change the # of people your making the recipe for, still a new user on the site. My family loved this recipe and asked that next time I make it I make more so they have left overs!! I followed the recipe exactly as is & it was great.

Excellent. The only change I made was adding a bit of rice flour since I had more than 1 lb of chicken and was concerned that I might not have enough batter to cover it all.

Made this for the 3rd time tonight.  Followed the recipe exactly except for the sherry, but that was because I did not have any on hand, but the chicken tasted delicious without it!!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Fantastic! My Family loved it. It was crispy and delicious. I fallowed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results. The sauce was very sweet but in a good way. I had kids sneaking into the kitchen to stick their fingers in the sauce bowl when I wasn't looking and I didn't have enough chicken yesterday so am cooking some for today to use up the sauce which is still fantastic the next day.

The whole family loved it. I have a couple picky eaters and they have requested that I make it again. The sauce was sweet but we like it that way. I no longer want to go out to eat asian food since I can make my family's favorite dish anytime.

The recipe is super easy to make and my family enjoyed it. Even though I didn't check my ingredients before starting it still turned out great with out the dry sherry and my minced garlic substitute. It may not have looked as pretty as the picture, but it was just as delicious.

I love this recipe! I made it for dinner one night with my family, and we ended up running out of chicken. It's nice that this website can alter the ingredients so you can raise your servings! The last time I made this, we had enough for everyone to have another helping. Great job guys! (:

This was awesome! My family loved and is wondering if Ill be able to out do it. I'll admit I had to alter it a bit due to the large family. I doubled the sauce but only added a half cup extra. This will definitely be made again. Thanks for the recipe

This was delicious! I only used about a 1/2 cup of sugar, and baked them instead of frying, turning halfway through. I also used a garlic chicken broth and didn't add extra garlic. The flavor is right on.

The sauce is absolutely delicious.  I did reduce the amount of sugar based on other reviews; I only used 3/4C.  make sure and add the cornstarch/water mixture slowly for desired consistency.  I find that if you boil and boil the sauce, the need for cornstarch reduces drastically.  So boil, boil, boil and reduce to get the perfect consistency; doing this will reduce your need to add a little bit of cornstarch/water mixture. I will be making this recipe again and again.  I had previously made the coating using a different recipe, but try this one.  The chicken comes out nice and crispy yet moist inside.  Very, very good. Thank you!!!

Was quite difficult to make and was definitely missing something that can be found in most Chinese restaurants.  My fiance and I both agreed that we would be better suited in the future just getting take-out or finding another recipe rather than spending this long to make a meal that lacks flavor.

Made this tonight. Always wanted to make this type of chicken but had no clue how to. This was it. It took some time, I didn't have the chili paste or sesame oil, I'm sure that would have made a huge difference. I also thought the sauce was too sweet, I had to put a lot more wine vinegar in it.

This recipe was excellent! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of the chicken breast and it was just soo moist!! Almost melt in your mouth delicious ;) The sauce smells a little weird by itself but with the fried chicken it was absolutely amazing!! =) I made this with Guam Fried Rice... great mix!! Will definitely be making this again!

This is delicious! I hesitated to try it but after reading all the glowing reviews, decided to give it a whirl. I took the suggestions to cut the sugar in half, and also cut the cornstarch that goes into the sauce in half. I used rice wine vinegar instead of the distilled white vinegar and only had one kind of soy sauce, which I used in both the batter and the sauce. The sauce is awesome. Next time I will add a bit more heat as we like things on the spicy side, but this one's a keeper!

A new favorite for the family.  It was very easy to do.  I couldn't find chile paste in our grocery store
so I used hot sauce instead.  Worked fine.  Family really raved about it.

I have made this many times and it is my family's favorite all-time dish.  In fact, I hosted my son's high school football team for dinner & this is what my son requested I prepare--26 boys ate 14 lbs of chicken!  I always make the full recipe of sauce and I always have some left over--it's a good thing to have in the freezer, in a pinch you can mix it with some frozen chicken nuggets for a quick meal.  I don't do anything different, the dish is perfect as is and needs no tweaking.

Absolutely Fabulous! I used cider vinegar (since I was out of white) and it still came out perfect. We have a deep fryer so we did fry them, but I'm pretty certain that it would have been substandard if we hadn't. Everyone LOVED it....it's so close to restaurant Sesame Chicken that I may never order out for it again. Totally on point! Great recipe...this one is printed out and stuck in my books as a regular recipe.

I didn't want to deep fry, so I sauted in olive oil; the smaller pieces came out better, but overall still really good. My husband approved!  Also, I substituted red pepper flakes (about 1 tsp) for the chili paste, and it came out spicy, but cut across the sweetness really well. I may try baking next time!

I cooked this for my family & not only did my parents love it, but my younger siblings (age range: 7-15) did as well! So much, in fact, that they decided we will come home after church (instead of going out) so that I can cook some Chinese food! I am so excited, as I am still a Diva-in-training in the kitchen! Thanks so much for this excellent recipe!

**I did not use dry sherry, as I did not have it and I only used one type of soy, rather than the two it called for.**

This was good.  We tried to bake it to save a few calories.  Next time we will fry it and just do more time on the treadmill.  The sauce was fantastic.

My mom and boyfriend loved this dinner! I didn't use the sherry wine since I'm not old enough to buy it yet! Either way though, it was absolutely amazing and I'll be making this dinner a lot more with this very recipe. Wonderful. :)

This was delicious. I used de-boned thighs, and cut the sugar down to a bit less than 3/4 of a cup and used brown sugar. I may add some ginger next time and a bit more chili paste. I give it a 10/10!

AMAZING!!! love this recipe and have forwarded it to my friends.  Instead of dark soy sauce i used the light soy sauce in both mixtures and i couldnt find chili paste so i did chili sauce and it was really good.  I served it with rice and broccoli.  Btw, your kitchen WILL smell like authentic chinese food. yum!

This recipe is great! I love the light crispy coating the chicken has. You can use the same "batter" w/o the sesame oil to make sweet and sour or whatever kind of stir-fry you want!

Delicious! I served this with Carrot Rice (from this site), and they complimented each other beautifully. I cut back on the sugar (use 1/2 c, heaping), used less olive oil than called for (I'm cheap!), and didn't end up adding quite all of the corn starch mixture. My husband loved it, and I will make this again.

I gave this an extra star since I didn't make it as the recipe stated & I want to be fair. :) I used beef instead of chicken, because I've been looking for a recipe for sesame beef. I left out the sherry, used beef broth instead of chicken & fried the beef in peanut oil intead of vegetable oil. The batter wasn't as crispy as I had hoped for. It looked nice, but was just too soft.  I served this with sticky rice and steamed brocolli. The family really liked it, but I was hoping for something different. Thank you for the recipe!

I don't think I've ever eaten sesame chicken before, but I really loved this!  I didn't have any chili paste, so I used chili powder instead.  I also didn't fry the chicken in a quart of olive oil.  Instead, I put only a little olive oil (maybe a few TBSP) in an electric skillet and cooked the chicken that way.  The chicken came out very tender & the sauce was delicious.  We put ours on jasmine rice & mixed some broccoli into it.  We will definitely be making this again!

This came out really well! I was surprised at how well the breading on the chicken came out. I tripled the recipe for a larger family, and cause I had a lot of chicken to use up. I had only a couple pieces of chicken left for my lunch the next day! I tripled EVERYTHING. If you do that, you do NOT need to triple the sauce. Maybe 1 1/2 times. I have a big chinese food restaurant container left in my fridge. My husband said it wasn't exactly like restaurant style but it was very good. I think the only thing I did differently was I didn't have chlli paste so I used a chili sauce. It worked fine though. Thanks!

Excellent flavor.   LOTS of Work.  Used 1/2 cup sugar instead.  Poured in slurry as needed.    Used olive oil, won't do that again.  Way too expensive.  Chicken is not crispy.  Bummer.    3.5 stars   if it would have been crunchy, then it would have been 4 stars

Wow, this is very, very good. I've tried a LOT of sesame chicken recipes, and while a couple were pretty good, this one is undoubtedly best. This has become a staple in my family's household. I make it once a month, and serve it with rice.

This was waaaaaaaay too sweet, and the sauce turned out way too thick. The sesame flavor was completely lost in the sugariness of this... I added more teriyaki sauce to try and salvage it, but I ended up throwing it out. The batter, on the other hand, was very, very good. I didn't have low-sodium soy sauce, so it was a bit salty, but it had a great flavor instead of being just a bland coating for the chicken. Was very yummy with some white rice and teriyaki sauce.

Loved the chicken part of this recipe as did my whole family.  I will tinker a bit with the sauce a bit as it didn't quite taste like I expected.  Other than that it was a great recipe!

I only made the sauce in this recipe.  It was really great.  I didn't have dark soy sauce (used lite soy sauce) or chili paste, but it was still really good.  I used this sauce as a dipping sauce for the "Sesame Chicken with Honey Sauce".  This chicken is baked instead of deep fried.  It was moist and tender.   Will keep this sauce recipe for future use.

My husband devoured this dish. I served it over white rice and with egg drop soup and chicken egg rolls. It was a fantastic meal (although time consuming)!! I did make a few changes per some other reviews sugestions. I used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar, and I used 3/4 brown sugar instead of 1 C white sugar. Also, I only used half of the cornstarch/water mixture. Nex time I will only use 1/2 brown sugar and will use 3/4 of the cornstarch mixture to make it thicker. We poured the sauce over the chicken. It was perfect and saved a lot of calories because it wasn't completely covered in sauce. We still have half of the recipe left, but we will definitely have leftover sauce once we are through eating the meat.

Everybody in my family loves this dish!!! It is one of my favorites. It is not too hard to make and only requires things that I already have on hand. I leave out the sesame (not my thing).

It was SO good! I still think the one at my chinese place is better in flavor but this is great!    THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE THE FRIDAYS SKILLET MEALS!!       1 Thing though- what kind of chili paste did you guys use? I had hard time finding this!! I think that's the biggest factor in the flavor you get!!

Wow!  This recipe is fantastic.  Other than deep frying the chicken in vegetable oil, I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out great.  The good news is that my wife and youngest daughter absolutely loved it - "best sesame chicken I've ever had" was my wife's response.  The bad news is that my three oldest daughters are away at college and are livid that I made this when they weren't home. I travel a lot for work and have tried sesame chicken at many restaurants, from cuisine style to carry out, and this is by far the best I've ever had. Thanks so much for this recipe, Doreen, it's absolutely wonderful!!!!

I added more sugar, per the recipe's suggestion, because we like our sesame chicken very sweet and gooey. It was easier than I thought, but there are a lot of dishes. It does take a while, but it is delish!

The breading on the chicken was just the right consistency, and stickiness, and the sauce was PERFECT, using the exact measurements from the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was that I let the chicken sit in the breading for several hours, rather than 15 minutes.  This wasn't intentional, and I don't know if it made any difference.  I will definitely make this again, and I will certainly make the sauce for other dishes as well.

Wonderful. I didn't have chicken broth so i subbed plain water, and I baked the chicken instead of frying. Was still spectacular; everyone loved it, even the kids. I served it over white rice with a side of stir-fried bok choy. It's a new family favorite.

Great recipe once it was adjusted just a bit as per  reviews. Less cornstarch for sauce, less sugar (1/3 Cup was fine) Fairly easy to make which means it's right up my alley! Thanks!

This was phenomenal!  As it was cooking, my family exclaimed "It smells like a real Chinese restaurant!  I think you could put them out of business with this recipe!"    The only changes I made were:  1. Like other reviews, I cut the amount of sugar in half.  It is still plenty sweet, without being overbearing.    2. We already had legs and thighs thawed, so we used them instead.    3. Because I chose to bake the chicken rather than fry it, I coated the chicken pieces in the liquid mixture, and then dredged them in the flour mixture, and sprayed them with Pam cooking spray.  (Next time I will try the method stated in the recipe.  It turned out good, but not great.)  4. I also added some Chinese 5 spice seasoning, and some ground ginger (personal preference).    This is the best sesame chicken recipe I've found, and I've tried alot of them!  This is definitely going in my normal rotation!

The only change I have made to it is to lessen the chili paste, I think it is a bit too spicy with the full amount in it. But otherwise It is perfect!

This is a great recipe and a great alternative to take-out.  My son is a HUGE fan of Sesame Chicken and he loved it.  Next time I will probably lower the sugar content a little - it was a little sweet.  I wish the batter was a little bit thicker, but I'll play with that next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Good Recipe! I've made a couple of times, using rice wine instead of sherry.  THe chile paste is a necessity to offset the sugar, and it just adds that much more flavor.

I enjoyed this recipe but not as much as my husband did.  There was WAY too much sauce so next time I would 1/2 the ingredients for the sauce.  Also, the chicken seemed to be very dark before it got done and I'd cubed into about 3/4 inch pieces.  I think the batter with the soy sauce made it look like it was burning.  The sauce was very strong and I only used about 3/4 of a tablespoon of the sesame oil (it's so overpowering IMHO).  With my tweaks I think this could be a 5 star.

This was OK. It was a bit too sweet for me, but my boys liked it. Next time I'll halve the sugar.

I tweaked this recipe a bit to suit my own taste.  As is, I give it 4 stars because it's just way too sweet for me and not quite 'authentic' enough.  It's a five with a few simple fixes.  I followed the recipe as written except that I used sesame oil for all the oil in the recipe, 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar, and instead of distilled vinegar I used rice vinegar.  This was sooooo delicious served with brown rice.  My family, even my kids, loved it!  Next time I will add in green peppers and onions like the restaurants do.

This recipe was great! I used it more for the sauce as I turned it into a tofu/vegetable stirfry, I used the same breading recipe and it turned out great. I like a little extra heat, so I added a bit of Siracha into the sauce and next time I may cut down the sugar just a tad, it was very sweet. Overall, a great recipe!

There was too much sauce for the amount of chicken, but it was good.  I added some red pepper flakes to the sauce which gave it a really good flavor.

This was delish! Only used 1/2 cup of sugar and didnt have any chili paste so  used chili oil. Tasted great and was quick and easy to make.

It's good, no question there!  Reading past reviews, I decided to cut the sugar in half, it's perfect.   What I'll change for next time? I will use less chili paste. it's too much for me.   otherwise, served it over rice, loved it, will make it again! I made it again tonight because I had extra chicken that needed using. I baked it, but think next time I'll just fry it again. still incredibly yummy! UPDATE: I baked the chicken this time as another reviewer had done. I only baked mine for about 20 minutes at 350. perfect. this is a great recipe.

This recipe was really good. We didn't have any Chile paste so we used red pepper flakes and it added color and kick. I will make this again.

Wow--My husband loved this. Better than any Chinese restaurant I have ever had. Made a couple of changes per other reviews. Cut the sugar to 1/4 c each of brown and white. Used rice wine vinigar and only used 2 T of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I used Sambel Olek as my chile paste.  I also pan fried the chicken. Served it with a kicked up house fried rice from this site.  Great results. Thanks

I pan fried the chicken in about 3T of Olive oil instead of deep frying, it was very good.  This recipe will save me from going out to buy it, very tasty stuff and a little spicy too.

This recipe is gold! Makes better-than-Chinese-restaurant-quality Sesame Chicken... I don't even miss the fortune cookies a little bit. So worth the hassle.

WOW!!!! My DH and 13 year old son LOVED this!!! They said it is better than the chinese restaurant where we usually get this. I made it according to the directions, and it was wondeful! However, you could probably go with much less sugar and next time i want to try rice wine vinegar. It makes a lot of sauce for only 1 pound of chicken, but that just leaves more to eat with the rice!!! YUM!!!

Love this recipe!  As others have suggested, I cut back on the sugar quite a bit... I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar...  Rather than chile paste, I used crushed red pepper flakes (1/2 t. because my husband doesn't like things very spicy).  As for the batter for the chicken, I didn't have any trouble getting it to stick to the chicken.  It browned and got crispy very nicely...  For my portion of the recipe, I placed the battered chicken on a Pampered Chef pizza stone...  popped it in the oven at 375 and it turned out wonderfully!

After reading the reviews I decided to reduce the sugar- my intention was by half.  However I ended up forgetting the entire ingredient.  My family all loved it- I ended up telling them I goofed but I really would not have had too.  So there you go, sugar isn't necessary. Oh and I tossed ww spagetti & stir fried veggies with the sauce & served the chicken over-top to save the batter.

I thought this was a really good recipe.  I thought it was easy to make.  I didn't see until later that it had an expert level attached to it.  The only thing was that it was not as good the next day.  But it was really yummy for dinner!

I actually made this with tofu instead of chicken and that worked really well. After reading the reviews, I halved the sugar and I thought the sweetness was perfect. The biggest problem was that my sauce ended up being way too thick. I think I'll halve the corn starch next time, but I'll definitely make it again. Thanks!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!!!  My husband and I loved it!  I did follow the other suggestions and reduced the sugar to 2/3 c.  I used my deep fryer and the only issue I had was the chicken sticking to the basket.  Hopefully I will be able to fix that problem the next time.  I will definitely make again.  Thank you!!

This was very good.  I used 3/4 cup sugar and didn't have any chili paste and didn't substitute anything in its place.  I agree with others, that there is too much sauce - I just didn't use it all.  My chicken was crispy and the flavor was very good.  I didn't give 5 stars only b/c it takes a while to prepare.

Excellent!  We found there to be way too much sauce and not quite enough chicken for our family of 4.  Next time, I would double the chicken and batter but leave the sauce the same.  Also, I didn't have Chile paste, so I used 1 tsp of chile powder and it turned out great!

Very tasty! The chicken wasn't really crispy though. I would've like to have more crunch- just a personal preference. But the taste was good! I did adjust the sugar to 1/2 c brown sugar. I couldn't find chile paste so used red pepper flakes. Definitely toast the seeds! I may add more seeds next time.
*second time making this and have decided there just was something missing from this sauce. I can't put my finger on it but it may be the type of sesame seed oil used. Hubby tried to add honey to it which helped a bit. But still was missing that little something.

I always play with my recipes, and this was no exception. I used less sugar, used white zinfandel instead of sherry and red wine vinegar. Turned out great though. Followed someone's suggestion to bake instead of fry chicken. Less mess and less fat... worked great.

If I could give 10 stars I would......This recipe was awesome.  I thought the sauce was better than most restaurants serve.  The batter for the chicken was oh so good, crispy, flavorful.  I used the full quart of oil to cook.  The chicken pieces cooked up so quickly and had great flavor all on their own, but when you top it with the sauce......OH WOW.....I doubled the recipe to 2 lbs. of chicken to feed all 7 of us, but honestly will have to triple it next time because we were all fighting for seconds. I served some red bellpepper, red onion, and asparagus sauted in a small bit of sesame oil and dash of salt, and yummy Trader Joe's brown rice...... Yes, the recipe does take some effort, but your family is worth the time to make this awesome recipe.  Thanks again for sharing this recipe.....

Well, it was time consuming and I did dirty a huge amount of dishes, but for the most part, this is a good recipe - I served it to my parents and my boyfriend, and they all loved it. Just a note though, you do not need that much oil to fry the chicken if you are using either a wok or a non-stick pan. I created quite the mess with the splatter before I figured that out. I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts, and just cut them down to bite sized pieces, I think it gave me a bit more chicken. Next time (when I'm up for it, seriously this recipe exhausted me) I will make more sauce. I had enough myself, but some people wanted more for the rice I served it with. Also of note, I used vermouth instead of sherry as that is all I had on hand; can't say I missed the sherry taste all that much.

We just used the batter portion of this recipe for our favorite Lemon Chicken recipe, and it was PERFECT!  We've been on a quest to find the perfect batter, and this is it!  I can't wait to try the whole recipe, since we love sesame chicken too!  I didn't have low sodium soy sauce, just the regular stuff, and even cutting back it was still a bit on the salty side.  The only thing I would change is to make the batter a little thicker next time so that more of it sticks to the chicken.  Overall, wonderful recipe!!

Chicken was not that flavorful and the sauce was not to our liking. The chicken was moist though.

Wow!  This was fantastic!  I used 3/4c. brown sugar instead of white, seasoned rice vinegar instead of white, and only 1.5c. oil for frying.  Served over jasmine rice with steamed broccoli.  Delicious!  My guys all love it!

This recipie was very good, though I'm not too experienced with making fried chicken and the batter made a mess of my deep fryer basket by causing the chicken to stick to it.  I also couldn't find chile paste at my grocery store so I had to ommit it, but I don't feel like the final product suffered as a result.

I have used allrecipes for at least two years and rarely write a review. This was a fabulous recipe! Follow it exactly and you will not be disappointed! This is as good (if not better) than any sesame chicken recipe I have had at a restaurant. My family and I are obsessed with sesame chicken and we could not believe this recipe. This will become a regular recipe in our household!! It is the perfect combination between sweet and spicy!

This was just what I was looking for! I love sesame chicken.  The chicken by itself was great and there was plenty of sauce.  I didn't have chile paste, so I used some red pepper flakes.  YUM!

Delicious!  I followed some reviewers' suggestions.  I cut down on the sugar.  I wish I had cut down on the cornstarch for the sauce because it was a little thicker than I would have liked.  I also served the sauce on the side to keep the chicken crispy.  Raves all around the table and no leftovers.

This was great!  Everyone loved it and asked me to make it again.  The breading turned out very well and was light and crisp (I let it set only about 10 min).  The sauce was very yummy too!  This one is a keeper.

I found this recipe to be way to sweet like other reviewers said.  I cut the sugar to a lil more than 1/2 cup but I didn't add sherry or vinegar.  I found the sauce to be very thick and served it on the side for my picky 1 and 2 yr old.  They loved the chicken but could live w/out the sauce.  I think next time I'll cut the sugar back even more and try it with vinegar and I wont add the full cornstarch and water mixture it was just too thick.  I loved the sesame taste though.

Really good sesame chicken. I used red pepper flakes instead of the chili paste, and pan fried my chicken. I also cut sugar in 1/2 after reading the reviews.

So yummy!!!  My husband couldn't stop raving about it throughout dinner.  My toddlers loved it too!  I made a few minor changes...I didn't use the sherry.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and I only used a few tablespoons of oil to cook my chicken.  Turned out perfect.

This is absolutly the best! I have tried alot of recipes from here, and never made anything this amazing! Better than our local Chinese Resteraunts! It was PERFECT! My entire family is still amazed with it! I will be making this over and over. It was very easy directions to follow, and was surprisingly quick dinner to make. I too cut the sugar down in the sauce to just 3/4 cups, as I had seen in previous reviews. thank you so much. PERFECT!

I made this recipe and reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. and used 1 tsp. chili powder in place of the chile paste {which was unavailable at our store} and it turned out perfect. My guys are picky and they complimented me on this recipe!

This recipe was excellent! I only ate Sesame chicken once before this recipe, and it was when I decided that I need to make it at home. I searched for recipes for it, and this recipe on the site resembled the sesame chicken I had had before. I must agree with some of the users though: I cut back on the amount of sugar, and added a LOT more pepper (we like hot food at my house). I also lightly seasoned my chicken before adding the batter to it (the batter, by the way, fries up the chicken so the outside is really crisp and the inside is moist and tender--it's even perfect on it's own!). Overall, it is a recipe I will DEFINITELY be making again, mark my words!

This sesame chicken lives up to its name. I'm glad I tried it. My daughter always orders sesame chicken when we order chinese and she loved this. One mistake I made was not using the whole cup of sugar called for. I followed another reviewers advice and cut back to 2/3 cup. It was not sweet enough and I think the full cup would have been perfect. Note that if you use the full amount of cornstarch for the sauce it is very thick. I think half the amount would have been enough. Also, it was not spicy at all with a tsp of chili paste to if you like it spicy I would suggest using more. I did add some steamed broccoli which tasted great with the sauce as well. I look forward to making this often.

Really great. I stir fried some broccoli and cabbage, and put down rice, then veggies, then chicken, then sauce--worked out great (had to stretch for company).  Couple adjustments I made based on what I had in the house--I used rice vinegar instead of white, and a bit less sugar, because a cup scared me a bit. WIth everything else though, I think a cup would be fine. Really great--thanks.
