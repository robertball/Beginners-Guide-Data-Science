Very nice mix of flavours.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I substituted about 1/2 tsp of ground instead.  There were no leftovers which is always a good sign.  I'm sure I'll make this again.

I cooked with bok choy for my first time using this recipe! I did not know if what I had was "baby" bok choy, but I had 2 heads so I halved the entire recipe. Also had no capers, they're a bit pricey for me to use. Regardless, this recipe tasted great! I used it for a Meatless Monday dinner and fried up some veggie egg rolls to go with. Boyfriend and I finished our plates, and I am definitely game to cook bok choy again! Did not find this too vinegary or slimy like other reviews state. I think fresh ginger really helped make this dish. If you don't cook with it a lot, it's OK. At the grocery store, just break off a piece in the size you'll need.. You don't have to buy the whole root that you see. I get a piece that is smaller than 1 inch, costs me less than 50 cents and I can make a couple dishes with it usually! :)

I have never had bok choy before but we are being more adventurous and trying new vegetables and new ways of preparing them...this was AWESOME....love the capers and vinegar tastes....i had to change my recipe due to some poor planning, i used apple cider vinegar and lime juice, also did not have fresh ginger so used powder....it took a little longer for my baby bok choy to cook as well but the wait was worth it

I will buy Bok Choy more often.  Did not change this recipe at all.  I only used one head so decreased the ingredients.  Yummy!

My family and I loved this. Asking my husband to eat new veggies doesn't always work well. This, he LOVED!!!! Already asking when we'll have it again. Thank you -thank you - thank you. It was easy, fresh, and very different. Most of the spices were on hand. I even used ground ginger instead of fresh and the taste was fantastic.

something just wasn't right in this recipe. It just didn't have that special something, and cinnamon was not it. I prefer the tabouli from the Sprouts or Henry's deli makes. this wasn't terrible, but I wont make it again

Pretty Good. I added salt and pepper because I season everything and I think it tasted better seasoned. Also, I cut back on the vinegar to a little more than half of what was called for. It was still plenty vinegary. All in all a very good recipe - loved the capers in there!

My husband and I thought this was very good but the balsamic vinegar added at the end overpowered the dish, in my opinion.  I would reduce it to 1TBS.  We also didn't add the capers since we didn't have any but I don't think it made too much of a difference.

The family thought this went Pretty well with the asian lamb chops we served. You have to like Balsalmic Vinegar to enjoy this recipe. Easy. Would suggest after separating stalks from eachother, washing leaves with stalk before cutting them up.

This was delicious!  I didn't have capers in the house, and I used only about 1T of the vinegar.  Still, there was plenty of flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe.

It might have been my cooking, but it came out a bit to bitter for my tastes. I would prefer to use soy sauce instead of balsamic vinegar.

This was my first time to make bok choy.  I don't know if I don't like bok choy or if I just don't care for it prepared this way, but I thought it was too vinegary and I didn't like the texture -- it seemed slimy.

Fan Forking Tastic!  I had never eaten bok choy or capers before, but I made this recipe without changing anything and I loved it. It was delicious, and I do not care much for vegetables. Will make again!

We  make this often using large heads of bok choy out of our garden instead of baby ones. I never have capers on hand so I don't use them. We just LOVE this recipe!! Fresh ingredients are important.

I didn't care for this recipe much. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I used only 1/2 tbl of balsamic vinegar. I thought it was way too vinegary and pungent. Normally I like things with vinegar but this was way too much. I may try this recipe again but without the vinegar.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The store did not have baby bok choy so I used regular. I also did not add the capers or lemon juice, I don't buy capers and I don't think it needed the lemon juice. Recipe needs salt and pepper to taste. I look forward to making again with baby bok choy and possibly trying the capers.

First time cooking with bok choy - very easy and tasty!  I did add some red swiss chard to liven up the color and had to use ground ginger-  but it still turned out great.

Nice way to make bok choy.  The next time however, I will omit the balsamic vinegar and capers.  I enjoy both flavors but not in this recipe.

Good, really good.  The preparation really cuts the bitterness I usually have with bok choy.  I used powdered ginger and no capers and a little hot chilis... but definitely will make again, since I live next to an asian supermarket and bok choy is always cheap

With the exception of subbing chicken broth for the water, I made this exactly as stated and it is delicious.  Earned enthusiastic "some mores" and will become a staple.

Excellent side to Chef John's Cocoa Cherry Pork recipe, also on this site.  Jasmine rice completes the meal and soaks up the juices.

Apple cider over ice is the perfect beverage to serve with the dinner.

The above menu is quick and easy and fit to come out for serving to company.

This was a nice, easy, and quick way to use up my bok choy.  I don't like capers and did not use them.  I also only used 1/4 cup of water and it still took quite a while to evaporate.  I hadn't ever used fresh ginger but this recipe inspired me to try it and it adds a nice flavor.  I also lowered the balsamic vinegar to 1 TBL and it was perfect!  The bok choy cooks down quite a bit and we didn't end up with a ton - maybe 4 servings.

This came great! Really tasty--the capers add a nice twist! The only thing I changed was to add the garlic and and ginger earlier in the recipe, rather than waiting until the end. I was afraid if I waited until the end, we would all be tasting them for days! Even with this modification, the dish came out very flavorful. I plan to use this as a regular for when we have bok choy. Great side dish!

This dish turned out great. I really loved the lemon juice, vinegar and ginger. I was afraid it was going to be bland but it is not at all!! I'll definitely make this again.

This was also my first time trying bok choy.  I added mushrooms to the recipe, and used a light Asian seasoning liquid rather than water.  It was good, but I will make again and likely cut back the vinegar a bit, as others have suggested.  And consider adding soy sauce as another reviewer suggests.
Over all, a good building recipe.

Yum! Fresh ginger really makes this pop! I always need lots of fresh ground pepper with ginger so I added a bunch. I don't think the water is entirely necessary- I would reduce it next time and leave out the capers. Overall this is a fantastic recipe!

I loved this dish, but my husband and son were only so-so on it.  It has a great flavor, but picky eaters may not enjoy the bold taste of ginger and balsamic as much.

WOW! this was great! I had enver cooked with Bok Choy (I have had it in Chinese) before, but we got some in our CSA share this week. I made this with a bit less vinegar than called for, added in some salt and pepper and served it with a mediterranean shrimp & onion dish. It was fantastic!

Not outstanding, but a nice change from wilted spinach because it was a green that had some zing.

I really did not care for this. I love anything with balsamic vinegar. Vegetable was over cooked waiting for the water to evaporate. Not what I expected.

Wonderful! I really wanted to eat this with Peanut Butter Noodles - so I swapped Soy Sauce for Balsamic Vinegar.  I also did not have baby bok choy, but in my opinion, the dish was still enoyable!
