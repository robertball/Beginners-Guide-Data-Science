Really a great recipe if you’re looking for a unique pizza. Note: Make sure you read the ingredients so you don’t use sardines instead of anchovies like one reviewer did.

This is a really good traditional sfincione recipe. It is very similar to the one my Nana from Sicily made us. She would add pieces of anchovies to the top and sprinkle the topping with oregano. My Nana would make huge batches of this and put it in her warmer for the entire family to snack on all day before our Christmas eve feast. Just smelling it cook brought me back to my childhood.

We did not care for the breadcrumb topping, but this crust was so fabulous it has become my go-to sheet pan pizza dough recipe. It make a very large pizza and is great for sharing with guests. Cooling the pizza on the wire rack ensures the crust stays crispy and shouldn't be skipped!

I made it! It was delicious. The ingredients list doesn’t say how much honey you need, but step 1 says add honey. So I just added 1tb.

This was delicious and fun to make! I made a bit less dough and mixed by hand as opposed to using an electric mixer. I made this for a party and everyone loved it.
