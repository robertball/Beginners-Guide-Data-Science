My husband gave this 5 stars, but maybe I'd give it 4.  The sauce was a little thick for my tastes, but we did love the garlic that permeated!  I didn't have fresh parsley, but that's the only deviation I made from the recipe.  I wish it had more color, and for that reason I'd add maybe some paprika or some herbs to the sauce.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I think the measurements are pretty far off. You only need 1 cup of flour total and only use 1/3-1/2 cup total in the sauce. There was way too much garlic. You should definitely cut that in half. I really wanted to like this recipe but it just wasn't a win for us.

The sauce was really delicious. I recommend to add a decent amount of pepper to it, it makes it taste a whole lot better.

Cut back the flour by 1/3rd and this is really a wonderful meal.  I seasoned the flour with msg, garlic pwr and pepper.

My son said “this is what I hope heaven smells like.” The sauce is so full of flavor, I did add 1 Tbls garlic season all, and I cut the flour in half. It was pretty thick.  A delicious garlic, butter gravy.
