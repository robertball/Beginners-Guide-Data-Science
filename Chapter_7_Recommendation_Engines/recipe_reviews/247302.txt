This is an elegant drink with subtle flavor.  Sort of an Arnold Palmer meets creamy smoothie.

I waited until a cantaloupe I had purchased was very ripe (about a week) to make this smoothie. I couldn't find fresh mint, so added a few drops of peppermint extract; brewed my own cup of green tea (left unsweetened), and substituted 1 cup frozen mango for the pineapple, as I don't care for the "stringiness" of pineapple. I found it to be mellow and smooth. I added a few drops of liquid vanilla Stevia sweetner to add a pleasant touch. Will make again, especially since the Greek yogurt adds protein!

It was okay, but sadly my husband demanded sugar be added into it. I also ended up using a whole cantaloupe and a whole can of pineapple.
