I have unsuccessfully tried to make Japanese noodles many times in the past.  When I pick my daughter up from school we usually have to go through the drive through and get her some.
I did use a different noodle (soba) and I used 1/2 soy sauce and the other 1/2 teriyaki sauce (as she likes teriyaki sauce better) used probably 1/2 the sriracha sauce  and also added some mushrooms, celery and some onion along with the broccoli, carrots and pepper.
After making these I got two thumbs up from my daughter and I had a hard time stopping eating it (I did put a heavy dose of sriracha sauce on my  serving) and will be definitely making again!
Also this is the first time I have made something without lots of reviews and after making I looked to see how many reviews there was and was shocked! I will try other things with not many reviews again for sure.

I used udon that came pre-cooked in a bag so all I had to do was drop it in the boiling water for about 4 minutes. Be aware, if you cook the udon too long, they get weird. Tasty, but squishy. I also used sirloin sliced thin for protein, cooked with sliced garlic, salt and pepper before the veggies went in.  I would definitely make it again, the husband even had seconds.

Nice lightly spicy udon noodle recipe. I'm glad it included lots of veggies. I added tofu to mine. Super quick and easy to make. I used precooked udon noodles

Good recipe. I added extra of the sauce ingredients.
