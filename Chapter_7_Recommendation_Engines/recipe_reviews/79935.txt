I'm giving it five stars because it was terrific chili but I would give it 3 for the directions.  Maybe it is just me since no one else complained.  I cut the recipe in half therefore it called for only 1 can of Stewed Tomatoes.  This needed a lot more than 1 can. I am wondering if Josh meant for us to also follow the directions of the chili seasoning and use those liquids.  In any event, I ended up using a jar of salsa too.  What we really liked was the combination of the beef and sausage.

This is just a great recipe. We all loved the layering of chili, crackers, pasta and cheese.  Sounds kind of yucky but is actually awesome.  Like reviewer "Aspiring Chef Rita" I thought it needed more liquid.  I added one more can of tomatoes (used Rotel with peppers, mild) and still wanted more, so dumped in the 1/2 container I had on hand of fresh salsa.  I also did not drain the tomatoes or beans in order to have the liquid.  Then it needed a little more spice, so I just sprinkled in some additional chili pepper.
One note...I just picked up pinto beans, per the instructions.  I ended up with light colored beans.  I didn't think this was as pretty as a result.  Go with the dark red beans for appearance.  Yummy Josh, thanks.

My wife and I made this last night. I made it with hamburger only, and used hot salsa & hot chili seasoning. We liked it a lot and will definately be having it again.

I won first place at my chili cookoff w/ this receipe.  My family loves it and so do my co-workers.  I used Rotel original diced tomatoes (2 cans) rather than stewed tomatoes - make less chunky.

This is just great comfort food, but you just CAN'T have it without Fritos! Skip the lame ol' crackers and slap some fritos on this bad boy! Here's how i do it: Pasta, chili, cheese, diced white onion, then fritos....mmmmm.....!

I'm giving this five stars just because it's a recipe that my family has made since I was little (and before I was).  GO FOUR WAYS!

This recipe has become a mainstay in our home.  It's absolutely fabulous!  Can be substituted with ground turkey and turkey (instead of pork) sausage.

Interesting recipe, Josh, that my children really liked.  My mom had her own version of 4-way chili that called for spaghetti, chili, canned tamales and grated cheese.  Now that we can buy fresh tamales, you'd think we'd use them, but it's just not the same taste or nostalgia-wise.  My only problem with your recipe was that I didn't know how many crackers to use.  A regular box measures serving size by number of crackers and grams, not ounces.  But we all did enjoy your four-way version.  Try mine some time.  I'll bet your family loves your cooking.  Thanks a lot for sharing, Josh.

Made this tonight and it smelled so good cooking! I halfed the recipe using 1 /2 lb hamberger and 1/2 lb sausage. I didn't have a green pepper but used 1/2 a red and a half of a yellow and a orange and half a red onion. I didn't bother to puree the stewed tomatoes and the can of red beans I bought was in a spicy tomato sauce so with all that I found the liquid amount was just right, I also added just a dash of cayanne pepper. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because we felt the pasta took away from it. My husband loved the chili and got a second bowl but that time he  didn't bother with the pasta at all. I usually like rice with my chili and will use it  to have with this. After I cooked it all up I covered the pot and put it in the oven to simmer at around 260 for a good 3 hours which I think really helped bring it all together. Then just had to cook the pasta right before supper.

Years ago, there was a restaurant in Fort Myers, FL that served chili this way. I loved it and was happy to recreate it in my own kitchen. Good base recipe that's fun and easy to "play" with. Even my picky kids enjoyed this new "spaghetti."

Awesome!  A nice change to "regular" chili!  I just made my chili like I normally do, and followed your "four way" steps.  

Thanks!

I made it with raw pinto beans that I soaked overnight, rather than canned beans. The recipe does not say how long to cook the chili, so I just cooked it for an hour.
