Great Pie!  It was very simple to make.  I did not have any cream in the house so I subsituted cool whip and it turned out great!!!!  It set really well and I would consider it a "light" version of a cheesecake.  I think next time I will add fruit on top and add a tsp. of vanilla into the mixture.  But it was great w/o any of the added items I just mentioned too!!!

One of the easiest cheesecake recipes I've tried! Light and not too sweet, would make it again for sure!
But if you're looking for the texture of traditional Japanese cheesecake, this isn't the one.

I have been to Japan but never had the chance to try Japanese cheesecake, however this recipe is really good.I needed to use up half of a bag of marshmallows, so this was a perfect recipe. I had a hard time with adding a raw egg yolk in to the cream cheese mixture so after the marshmallow and milk were smooth I added two spoons of the hot marshmallow/milk mix to a small bowl with the egg yolk. After mixing well I poured into back into the pot, and cooked for another minute while stirring. Then I added it to the cream cheese mix, then added a splash of vanilla extract. I really had doubts that this pie would set up, but after 3 hours it was set. I would recommend chilling for longer though for better flavor. I topped this pie with Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site, but might try added green tea powder to the batter next time for a more Japanese flair. This is a great no-bake cheesecake that is light and not too sweet, can't wait to make again!

This recipe is definitely more of a cheesecake than a cake but its SO simple to make! I followed another user's tip of replacing heavy cream with cool whip and it came out nicely. Only addition is that I let it sit (covered) in the fridge for at least 5 days; the longer it sits, the more solid the cheesecake. Great recipe!

This cake, which is really a pie, is delicious, especially a day or two later.  The longer it sits the better it tastes.  The flavors become more pronounced.  I will definitely be making this often.

WOW! This ultra fluffy cheesecake is the easiest thing to make.  It adapts really easy too. I melted some chocolate chips with the marshmallows and ended up with a really nice mousse-like pie.

It was very easy to make.  My 9 years old son had a great time helping me make it!  The texture of this cake is not a Japanese style cheesecake, but it tasted very good anyway!  I did add strawberries on top, cuz it just need it for my taste!

This is SO good! My fiance' and I couldn't stop eating it!  Nice "cheesecake" flavour, with a nice light texture.  Recipe is easy to follow.  The only thing I did different, as one person had suggested, was tempering the egg in some of the marshmallow mixture, and then adding it back to the marshmallow mixture in the pot.  Turned out really good.  Mine had set within an hour and a half.  Definately worth ALL five stars :-)

This was a good, basic airy cheesecake.  However it reminded me very much of one of those kits you can buy at the store.  I was disappointed there was not more marshmallow flavor. I love the thought of a marshamllow flavored cheesecake.  Will keep looking.

I gave this a 4 for how easy this recipe is, however, for taste I would give it a 3.  It either needed more marshmallows or some kind of topping/filling.  Thanks.

Super easy to make; light & fluffy, not too sweet. My husband adores this. It's much better without the addition of any extra toppings--no cherry topping, etc.

I'm still trying to figure out why this is called marshmallow cake.  It is just like a light version of cheescake.  If you don't like really sweet, rich desserts this will be a good one for you.  It was very good and I recommend adding a drizzle of raspberry sauce or fresh fruit.

Very good.  It is better than cheesecake.  I found it a little greasy from the heavy cream.

I was afraid to try this with the raw egg yolk, but it was so yummy and easy and affordable (homemade cheesecake can cost $20!!!).  Two thumbs up from us :D

Easy no-bake recipe with a great cheesecake taste. Light and not overly sweet. I was a bit dubious about the marshmallows but I shouldn't have doubted. Followed the recipe exactly and it came perfectly. A hit at a potluck I brought it to.  Will make often.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It had a great flavor and a nice thick consistency. I was never able to get my mixture to peak, probably because I didn't have cold metal bowl. I threw the mixture in my blendtec blender and I still couldn't get it to peak either. But the pie still turned out well regardless. I will note that the first slice was delectable, but after a couple of days it wasn't quite as good, so eat at one meal!

Light and fluffy, but bland. I drizzled ganache on top, and it needs a good thick layer of it.

Loved it!! I used whipped cream instead of heavy cream and added 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  I also added more marshmallows after seeing in the reviews it didn't really taste like them.  It was like eating a marshmallow-cheesecake hybrid, mmmmm!!!
