Chicken Fried Steak is breaded and fried in oil, like fried chicken.  One of the great tricks to a great chicken fried steak is to include a touch of sugar in order to caramelize the breading as it fries, then, when the steaks are all fried, leave some of the fried crumblies in the pan.  Remove as much oil as will not be needed for the gravy and make white gravy but only after browning the flour (use the leftover seasoned flour, complete with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and that all important sugar).  This produces a not so quite 'white', milk gravy, with a richer and more enjoyable flavor.  Don't try to bread recently defrosted meat unless it has been thoroughly dried, e.g. - with paper towels.  Mashed potatoes, skins still on, are fabulous with such a dish, and are most easily done via a crockpot, IMHO.... but it's all quite tough on the waist line, so we don't make it often any more...... *sigh*....

After reading the review of bomackin, it is clear that the name of this recipe was ill-chosen.  This system will not allow me to change it though.  Although it is a "breaded" and "fried in oil" steak, it is actually simply a browned steak cooked in gravy and certainly not "chicken" fried.  It is really tasty, however, and my family loves it with mashed potatoes!  As the creator of this recipe, I am sorry for any confusion caused by the title and hope you may give it a try anyway!!

This is a good recipe to utilize inexpensive round steak.  I will make it again because I really liked the gravy it made with the onions, but I think it is more like swiss steak, def not chickien fried steak.  Anyways,  I deglazed with dry cooking sherry after I fried the meat.  I did not have greek seasoning, which contains mint, so I just used italian seasoning.  I served with boiled okra and garlic mashed potatoes. Hubby and all 5 kids enjoyed it!

I really liked this recipe. It was so easy to put together and tasted really good. There was lots of gravy to put over mashed potatoes or pasta. I didn't have a package of chicken gravy but I had turkey. It  still tasted good. I think this is versatile enough that you could use almost any combination of cream soup, can of gravy and package of gravy mix.  I'll make sure to put chicken gravy mix on my grocery list and try it as written next time.

my kids love this recipe. i use it over and over again. just a hint dont use any seasonings. it can be salty depending on what brand of gravy and what brand of creme of chicken you use if you add salt. i dont add any extra seasonings to this and its perfect for us. also i dont use greek seasoning.

This is an  excellent recipe for tender flavorful meat.  The name is not appropriate but as the post said , she cannot find a way to change it.  We had a lot of gravy left over, so I froze it and next time I can just put the meat and gravy in the crockpot and let it go all day.  We will make this one over and over again.

I made this one tonight. I turned out very good. A little salty so next time I will use low sodium gravy and cream of chicken. I did use a presser cooker and it worked great.

It was okay, I guess. More like a Swiss steak than a chicken fried steak. Not bad, but not what you expected, either.

We found this delicious. It couldn't be simpler to make. I used a t-bone that I found in the freezer that was over a year old. Turned out perfect.
