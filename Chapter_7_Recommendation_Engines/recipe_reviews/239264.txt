I used this recipe instead of mashed potatoes at a meal. It was great. And the leftovers freeze well.  The only problem I had was it took much longer then 20 minutes to cook the rutabagas. I may not have cut it up small enough before cooking.

This was my first time trying out rutabaga.  I followed the recipe above except with clarified butter.  It was ok, but I don't think it had anything to do with recipe, rather that I just don't love rutabaga.  Bottom line, if you like rutabaga you will probably like this.  Also a good paleo/whole30 side.  I did eat it all with hubby's help but the kiddos did not like it.
