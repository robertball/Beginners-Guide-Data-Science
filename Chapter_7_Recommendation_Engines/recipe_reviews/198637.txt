We really enjoyed this.  I used curry paste instead of powder, and probably a lot more than the recipe called for.  We really enjoyed the taste.  Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good, but I was a little disappointed since, given the ingredients and my tastes in food, I was expecting it to be more like awesome. I made it exactly as written, and was a little surprised to find it not all that spicy after all. Also, it was a bit on the dry side, since almost all the liquid comes solely from the can of diced tomatoes. This was good, mind you, and I gobbled it down over three days, but I just think that it could be even better. Still, worth making again, and even tweaking a little.

I made this tonight, hoping for something different, and I had all the ingredients on hand. It was edible, but not good. I was glad when my bowl was done. All you taste is the curry, there is no smokiness from the cumin and no other flavors. Everything is over powered with the curry. There is too much onion. Most of the sauce was onion. For it to be similar to a tomato sauce, there needs to be more tomatoes. The sauce turns out to be a slightly yellow brown mush that does not look appetizing. The cooking times are inordinately long, if I had cooked that chicken for any longer, it would have been rubber. There is no way that the mush needs to be simmered either because there is no liquid to cook off and it doesn't need time for the flavors to meld--the curry hides everything.

This fusion works unlike some attempts at combining cuisines.  I like curried boot leather so I am prejudiced from the onset.  This is an easy to put together dish that can be doctored to suit your desired degree of hotness.  I love hot so I added fresh hot peppers to Madras curry powder.  Omit poultry is you're vegetarian and it's still a great recipe.  Thanks Bill!

a lovely pair of my 2 favs. pasta and curry! this is a really easy dish to put together. i doubled up on the chicken and the tomatoes using one tin of fire roasted tomatoes as that's what i had in my pantry. i omitted the tomato paste, cuz i didn't think it needed it. i read a few reviews with complaint of this being too dry. this was not the case here. there was just enough to liberally coat the fettuccini which is what i like. i don't like my noodles swimming in a pond of sauce. The curry and cumin flavours were spot on! Served with Roasted Cauliflower Steaks from this site and some warm naan. will definitely make this again :)

No wonder Italy never met India before. Curry definitely DOES NOT belong in fettuccine.

mmmmm :) I was looking for a good recipe that used curry, and this was great!  I used curry paste because that is what I had, and we used shrimp rather than chicken and adjusted the cooking time so the shrimp wasn't overcooked. Added red pepper flakes because my curry was mild. will for sure make again!!
