Awesome soup!  I used my own chicken stock, and added some shredded chicken to it.  I skipped the corn chips, too.  
Try this:  Cut the corn off 2 sweet corn cobs and add it into the soup after step 2.  You won't believe how good it is.  
What a wonderfully flavorful soup.  Thank you Holly!

I used some roasted green chiles from last year to make room for the ones I got this year. This soup was excellent and I have shared it with some of the more adventurous folks I work with

I would give it six stars if I could! I put in a little extra green chilis and extra oregano, and I used two handfuls of frozen chopped "hash-brown" potatoes. I refused to skimp on the butter - it seemed instrumental. I did add two shredded chicken breasts (and 1 more can of low-sodium broth) to make it a meal. Skipped the chips, used mozzarella cheese (lower fat, tastes like jack cheese), half-n-half instead of cream, and served with Mexican hot sauce (Tapatio). We like it spicy here in Nevada too!

After reading all the related reviews I decided to try this recipe...  I'm not quite sure why everyone is raving over this recipe - I didn't find this soup to be that great. I followed the directions and found it to be a bit bland, without any really outstanding flavour. I'm thinking that adding some Chipolte might help.

Utterly fabulous. I added chicken, so I used the chicken broth from that for the soup. I added lots of extra green chile (hot)and used evaporated milk in place of the cream. The consistency, for me, was perfect, with a nice creamy taste, but a brothier (though slightly thick and smooth texture). I took some of this to share with co-workers and everyone raved! Those that cook asked for the recipe, and those who don't cook asked me to bring it again! Thank you Holly! This recipe ROCKS!

Awesome soup!  Everyone loves it.  I didn't use all of the chilis called for so it wasn't too spicy.  I also used some corn starch to thicken it up to my liking.  For simpliciyt, I crushed corn tortilla chips and used them as topper with the cheese.  Served this soup with the Black Bean and Corn Salad II recipe from this site and it was a huge hit.  Great recipe.

I left out the corn tortillas and added sour cream instead and it tasted just like Potato Chili Soup I used to make from a neighborhood cookbook.

This was DELICIOUS on a cold winter's day! I subbed butter for the margarine, didn't add cheese, added a jalape√±o, and served chorizo on the side (which people plopped into the soup, and which I might cook into the soup next time since it was so tasty). Thanks for an EXCELLENT and easy recipe that made the house smell great!

Awesome soup. I used  about 1 1/2 cup of fresh roasted green chili instead of caned. When I was done I blended it to make a smooth  soup and garnished it with longhorn cheese , sour cream and real bacon bits.

Very delicious and very spicy!  I would recommend to partially puree this soup if you're looking for a creamy consistency.

So many people thanked me for this recipe that I have to give it 5 stars. I added jalepenos to make it spicier and it was perfect. I liked it without the cream, so I left it on the side so people who aren't used to spicy food could add some. It got rave reviews with and without the cream. I used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian.

This soup is SUPERB! The whole time I was eating it, I couldn't stop remarking about how delicious it was! I found it to be very flavorful with just the right amount of spice! Thanks for such a fantastic recipe, which has definitely been added to my favorites! Next time, I will take the suggestion of others and add some shredded chicken to the mix to make it a little more filling!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I added baked chicken that was covered with oregano and lime juice.  The taste was magnificent, I will definately make this again.  As far as kids go, unless they like green chile, it might be too spicy.  Thanks!!

My boyfriend and I love the Green Chile soup at Duartes in Pescadero but, it's 4 hours away - a long way to drive for soup! So, I've been hoping to make something like it at home. This one is close. I doubled the amount of green chilis, garlic, oregano and salt. I blended it and skipped the cheese and tortillas. Delicious!
Without at least doubling the chilis, it just tasted like potato soup to us.

Delish! I also purchased a roast chicken at the grocery store, and diced up one breast and added to this soup. Instead of the corn tortillas I just used tortilla chips. Personally I would like it a little thicker so next time may thicken it up with a little cornstarch. Wow what flavor!

Oh my, very good indeed.  I wanted the mixture a bit thicker, so I whirled 6-7 shredded white corn tortillas with a bit of water (perhaps 1/4 cup) in my Vita Mix to make a thick paste. Not only did it thicken nicely, but provided a wonderful secondary flavor.  My dinner company would not walk out the door unless a large container of this soup was placed in his eager hands.  Thank you!!!

I too added chicken that I previously cooked in my crockpot with taco seasoning. I also added just a little bit of corn and extra mild chiles.  Loved it so much

I love this recipe I have made it several times, the only base recipe change I made was to use mexican oregano. But depending on what I want I add extra things such as serrano chiles to make it spicy, chicken for a whole meal, or if I I want it thicker I add some corn starch to the cream before adding to the soup then bring it to a boil for one minute. Thanks for the great recipe!

i thought this was fantastic, and my husband loved it. only reason why i put 4 stars is because it was missing something. maybe i should have used all hot chiles, i mixed mild and hot. it was less creamy than i thought, but was still good. i ommited the cumin because i dont like it and added a dash of paprika. easy to make and a very satisfying way of not eating meat.

I recommend this recipe highly it's so good, and really not that spicy. I used a hand blender and slightly pureed it. I think this recipe is also really yummy without the cream. give it a try.

We really enjoyed this soup. I entertained over the holidays and wanted something easy to make and flavorful. I found it with this recipe. I'm not a very good cook and this turned out great. I used a previous reviewer's suggestion of pureeing one third before adding the cream. It made for a great consistency. I will make it again. Next time I'm going to add chicken and see what that does. My guests asked for the recipe. Thanks, Holly for submitting it.

I have recently relocated to the east coast from New Mexico and desperately needed a taste of home. Even my 10 year old daughter LOVED this. I will be making it again SOON, and will perhaps even add some diced chicken. Thanks for the great idea!

My husband really liked this receipe.  I thought that it was too spicy.  I added some chicken to the receipe to make it more of a meal.  My husband ate it with chips and thought it was better than the chicken soup I normally make for him. :)

Fun recipe that packs a lot of flavour and not too much heat.  I pureed about a third of it before adding the cream, for a thicker, more chowder-like soup. I also used more garlic, and added a bit of a South Western Spice mixture.

This is a wonderful, easy soup.  I made it while visiting with friends during a storm while the power went on and off.  Six of us had a bowl of the soup when it was done and everyone loved it.  Don't know if it's too spicy for kids.  In Texas, our kids are raised with spicy things.

This was fabulous. I increased the garlic and added shredded chicken and hot chilies and it was great!

I made a few substitutions to make it vegan. It was delicious. Thank you.

My family raved.  I even forgot to put the cheese in and they loved it. Once the cheese was added it was over the top! A great soup-the potatoes make it hearty-but not heavy.

This was a great recipe. I used 3 potatoes and used canned milk instead of the whipping cream. I will make again.

Another great soup recipe.  Although it is not much to look at.  I used fresh oregano and topped with fritos instead of tortillas. My kids 7 and 12, surprised me by eating it.  I also topped with 1/2 mozzerella and 1/2 chedda, because that's what I had. Yum!
