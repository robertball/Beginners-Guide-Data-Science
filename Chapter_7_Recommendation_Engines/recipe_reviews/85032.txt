Wanted to add that you can tweak the recipe to suit your own taste.  I have since started using fat free milk and artificial sweetener.  My son made me one with brown sugar and it tasted heavenly.  So please feel free to experiment with this to make it your own.  Enjoy!  I have to give this 5 stars.  The combination of flavors is so calm and relaxing.  Over the years I have made substitutions like with a sugar substitutes and it is still good.  I have been making this for 14+ years and our boys continually ask for it.  I know that it seems like a lot of sugar.  But it really does work with the combination of flavors.  When I made it it was by sheer coincidence that the boys became sleepy after drinking it.  I did not have any hot chocolate or tea bags on hand as they had been outside playing in the snow and I just made it for them.  They went to bed by themselves after having this.  I thought surely not.  But yes it does put you in a calm state of mind.  I have made it with honey when I did not have sugar on hand.  It really is good and it is so relaxing.  I hope this will be a family favorite for you as it has become one of our's.

When my honey was in the Navy he and the guys had many a sleepless night. He recently got out and is now schooling and working. Both full time. I tried this on him and it was perfect! He has been getting better sleep and even passed it on to his Navy buddies still on the ship. They don't often admit when my cooking is good, well because it usually isn't... but they loved this and continue to thank me. It's a quick fix they can make on the ship. Thanks so much for this recipe. It's wonderful. : )

Nutmeg is a wonderful addition to this drink!  However, it seemed extremely sweet for me...  two tablespoons of sugar for one cup?  Wow!  I know I'll make it again, but with less sugar.  Thanks!

This is wonderful and reminds me of sleepovers at my grandparents so many years ago. I added cinnamon to mine just because I am a cinnamon freak. With the holidays around the corner this is sure to become a family favorite in many households. Hubby suggested that a candycane/peppermint stick would be good at Christmas. Thanks Dawn.

Normally I'm not a fan of anything short of ice cold milk. However, I tried this when I was having trouble getting to sleep.It was just what I needed. It tasted great.Not a sleeping pill, but possibly the best 3 minutes miracle I have ever tried. Thank you.

My grandsons spend the night weekly & I like to make them a bedtime snack. They loved this! I served it to them in vintage teacups...they thought it was so special. I hope you don't mind me changing the name to "Honey's Warm Milk". :o)

After a crazy day of non-stop action, the birthday girl and her brother were having a hard time getting to sleep.  I made this for them and they drifed off like babies! I used Splendaâ„¢ because my son reacts wildly to sugar and they both loved it. Thank you, thank you... I'll have to remember this for Halloween!

I LOVED this recipe. 
It's great as a "pick-me-up" drink, and it goes extremely well with a box of Kraft Dinner Mac & Cheese. When I inititally tried this recipe out, I didn't have any ground nutmeg with me, so I substituted it with a pinch of brown sugar, and a little less white sugar. It came out really well, with all sorts of flavour. I would try this cold next time, too!
Great recipe, Dawn!

Tastes great! Not sure if it helps me fall asleep, but it does help me stay asleep. No tossing/turning or waking up during my sleep. First few times I added the ground nutmeg directly into the milk but I don't enjoy the floating spice. Now I cut open a tea bag, empty the contents and replace it with nutmeg, then just staple or string it back up. Same great flavor without getting the nutmeg in your teeth.

So soothing. This is wonderful ... with the nutmeg its like a warm very light eggnog. Warms you inside and makes your tummy smile. Adjust sugar to taste (1 T. was enough for me).

I've been struggling relaxing enough to actually sleep at night. I stumbled across this recipe and thought this might be a good drink to try, just to see if it would help. It's wonderful. I don't know why I've never thought of making something like  this before. And really puts me in a comfortable state of mind. I'll be sure to make this for my kids after a hard day and continue to make it for myself as well. Thank you times 100 for this recipe.

This recipe is similar to "Milky Tea" and "Hot Vanilla" which are on this website too.  But, HOT VANILLA is my 5 star FAVORITE!!!!  The recipes are similar but the health benefits of cinnamon are greater than nutmeg.  This recipe is filling and tastes great.  Check out the health benefits of milk and cinnamon at http://www.whfoods.com

Made exactly as written, except with powdered milk instead of regular. It was delicious and so relaxing! I loved it and am planning on having it again tonight. :-)

Good! This milk really helps me to relax. It even soothes heartburn! I didn't have any nutmeg so I used cinnamon instead. Thank you for sharing.

This is such a wonderful recipe. I've made it so many times since I first reviewed it last year. I was brought up with regular warm milk with a pinch of sugar, and, although that certainly did the job, this recipe takes it to a whole new level. The first time I made it, I didn't deviate from DAWNSCOTT'S recipe, and it certainly deserved 5 stars. Since then, however, I make it using brown sugar, and - if I have it - a generous splash of cream. I also keep a bag of English toffees in the cupboard specifically for this drink: the toffee flavors the milk, and gets all gooey and delicious at the bottom of the mug. I LOVE this recipe! Thanks so much!

Delicious!  The wind was blowing, the rain was pouring down and my daughter and I wanted something to drink with our freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.  This drink hit the spot and made me excited for the coming holiday season.  Thanks!

Ok this DOES taste really good, but I am rolling in the floor laughing my head off.  Of course it makes the little darlings sleepy....vanilla extract is 35% alcohol!!  I make my own vanilla extract at home, and all it is is vanilla beans and vodka.  They use pure grain alcohol for commercial vanilla.  Thanks for the laugh...and the drink!!!!

I didn't like the flecks of nutmeg floating around, and the taste was a little overpowering.  But I love the idea of adding a little sugar and a little vanilla.

I frequently have a hard time either falling asleep or staying asleep.  Since finding this recipe, if I'm having a hard time getting the sleep I need, I'll make this and within 20 minutes I'm ready to fall asleep.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for posting this recipe.  If I could give it 100 stars I would.  I do use fat free milk and and a little spoon full of sweet 'n low plus the vanilla.  The nutmeg is a nice touch, but not necessary.

I think you should probably adjust the sugar to your own liking.  Start with 2 teaspoons then add more if you need to.  I use Splenda instead of sugar.  If you add one beaten egg yolk and a jigger of whiskey or dark rum you have my mothers egg nog recipe.  That is what I found interesting. Of course that version is just for the adults.  It will really make you sleep

This was amazing! I was sick yesterday and still am feeling a little under the weather today, so i was looking for an easy warm drink that was not tea or hot cocoa. I also was in the mood for something with milk. I made this and i was tired just after drinking it! Yummm(: But i am NOT a nutmeg fan so i did not put any on. I reccomend this for anyone who does not like nutemeg. You can also subsitute the sugar for splenda to make this healthier! Thanks!

I had a hard time sleeping, and this really helped! Sometimes it can get a little rich, but I like it anyway! I don't put in that much nutmeg, I only put in a dash, and I think it's better that way. I'm so glad I found this recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I've been wanting to add something in my warm milk, but I didn't want to make hot cocoa.  This recipe is perfect!  Nighty Night! zzzzzz

At least 55 years ago, my grandmother used to make this recipe for me and my brother at bedtime.  It was as wonderful then as it is now!  I had forgotten about it until seeing your recipe and I will make it a point to pass it on to my grandchildren.  Very soothing . . busy moms will like that for themselves as well as their overly energetic kids!

Very simple and easy to make and very tasty. It was a tad to sweet for me since I no long have the taste buds of a child, but I know that I can tweak it to my own taste and experiment. I am going to try to find a finer grain of nutmeg, because the bottle of it I have did not really mix well with the milk but that was the only drawback for me. The only thing I changed was that I added cinnamon because that is one of my favorite spices.
With that said, I think this recipe is still deserving of 5 stars.
If you don't like it to be sweet, then add less sugar or none at all, but play around with it a little before giving up on it.

P.S. Drinking it out of your favorite (Doctor Who) mug makes it taste better. ;)

This was brilliant.  I used to make something similar... something called Russian Milk, or Russian Tea.  Anyways, this is the slimmed down version of that drink, and it's great.  A little sweet for my taste, but the sugar and nutmeg do a great job of hiding that weird flavor milk gets when it's warmed up.  I'll be making this on a regular basis, but will probably cut down on the sugar a bit.

Wow, that was good. I have wanted to make this for a long time, but keep forgetting. My son has been having problems sleeping, and I just remembered about this. 1st, he loved the taste. 2nd, he said that he slept sooooooo good last night, he only woke up once to put the covers back on. Thanks! And if anyone cares, I used 2% milk, and followed recipe exactly except I only warmed it for a minute and it was the perfect tempurature to just start drinking. TRY IT!

ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR!!!  If there were 10 stars, I'd give this one 11!  I tried this recipe as a way to use up some milk and I am a HUGE fan now.  I used fresh grated nutmeg.  Next time I think that I will use ~1.5 tablespoons of sugar as it was a little too sweet for me, but I tend to always think things are too sweet.

Made this last night as I was having no luck falling asleep. I didn't care for it at all (it was "OK" at best). I prefer hot cocoa or tea or just plain 'ol steamed milk without the fixins to do the trick. A good concept. Just didn't suit my taste. I like nutmeg, but mine wouldn't mix with the milk (when stirred) and, b/c of this, was difficult to drink (I felt as if I were inhaling nutmeg - which has a VERY strong / woodsy smell and a slightly scratchy texture). Perhaps cinnamon would be a better choice? Thanks anyways!

This is wonderful. Such a great way to get in all your dairy servings on cold days. I use 1% milk, and splenda. For those on Weight Watchers, doing it this way is only 2 points. We have been having such cold weather lately, and I drink this every morning with my breakfast. It's also very soothing at night time, and I love the aroma of the nutmeg. It's also very good using only 1 tablespoon of Splenda, a pinch of cinnamon, and a sugar free candy cane to stir.

Putting milk in the microwave detracts from its nutritional value, so heating in a small saucepan on med heat is a better option. This is definitely a 5 star recipe. My grandparents made a variation of this when i was young, now i can FINALLY recreate it! thank you so much for posting; i substituted cinnamon as well.. next time i will try fresh ground nutmeg.

I have rated around 42 recipes and I have to say first that this is one of the very few recipes I have rated that I would give higher than a 5 star. I used splenda instead of sugar and I also tasted this cold before heating up and it was just as yummy cold as it was hot. What a healthy way to get a sweet treat and to get calicium in your diet. It was so soothing. My children LOVED it! I am very happy that I came across this recipe. I plan on making this a lot. Thank you

Very simple and definitely has a calming effect on me.  I did add a little more vanilla than I probably should have but it doesnt matter because the taste is absolutely delicious.  Very good idea for those cold autumn and winter nights.  Thanks for the tasty recipe.

I made this with a squeeze of honey instead of 2 tbsp of sugar.The vanilla and nutmeg to taste(didn't measure). Turned out so delicious. My kids loved it! I've now done it many times, and add cinnamon to it too, sometimes omitting the nutmeg, and other times together. Thnx for sharing your recipe Dawnscott! I will surely make this again and again!

I made this the other night for my 2 year old to help relax him before bed. He usually doesn't like warm drinks, but he drank almost all of this and he fell asleep faster that usual. I tasted a little while I was making it and it was really good, I'm sure I'll be making some for myself soon. Thanks for the recipe.

Very delicious. I've tried other warm milk recipes without really finding the right flavor for me, but this hit it on the nail. I was craving something warm on this cold winter day & this hit the stop. I accidently added 2 tsp vanilla but that worked out great! Nutmeg worked great & gave such a nice flavor. Thank you so very much!

I've tried warm milk different ways and couldn't stand it.  I decided to give it one more chance with this recipe.  Glad I did!  I LOVE this!  Didn't have nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice.  Yum!  Going to be having this quite often.

This is a lovely bedtime drink. However it does NOT need any sugar//honey/sweetener at all .  Remember that milk already has sugar in it.  2% has 12g and even 1% has 11 g per one cup serving.

I'm another mommy to be. I've been craving milk like crazy, but needed something to help mellow me out and relax... this was just what I needed. My husband loved it too! Vanilla is a fantastic addition to warm, sweet milk. Didn't have nutmeg, so substituted with a tiny amount of allspice, and a decent dash of cinnamon. I love the suggestion of peppermint at Christmas time. I will definitely try adding candycanes as stir sticks when they come back in season. ;)

This is a comforting, yummy bedtime drink. Perfect for these fall nights.   When I make it again I plan to reduce the sugar to 1-1.5 Tbsps and try 1/8 tsp nutmeg.

This reminds me of having steamed milk.  I used a little less sugar than the recipe called for.  I'd consider making it again and trying a different kind of flavored extract.

Add a little cinnamon or a tiny bit of cinnamon extract and this drink makes eyelids heavy in minutes! I like to use dark brown sugar instead of white for a bit more flavor.

I would cut back slightly on the nutmeg.  It is a little bit too "nutmeggy" but even then it was still incredibly wonderful.

Mmmm...YUmm! I normally don't drink milk, unless I'm eating cereal or having a milkshake...but this is really good! Definitely a keeper, but next time I'll cut back on the sugar...was a wee bit to sweet for my tooth. Oh and it did help me sleep, I normally don't go to bed till 1am or so, but I hit the sheets a little after drinking this milk. So relaxing. Thank you!!!

This is so good! My picky husband loves this. I just wish we found this receipe in the winter. I tried it with cinnamon, next time I will try with nutmeg. I have made this a couple of times then my DH requested this last night but we ran out of the vanilla extract so I'm gonna buy the BIG bottle instead of the 2oz one I usually buy every 2 years!

I love this! I used the full amount of nutmeg the first couple of times I made it, but I didn't like the way it just seemed to form a film on top. Now I just add a pinch, and it's just perfect for me.

This is so cOzY! Perfect for a snow day or evening by the fire watching "Miracle on 34th Street"!  My father-in-law says that this an old country-folk recipe from way back. Add a tiny bit more vanilla ;) -- It will be just what you are expecting! Also tasty is you sub. cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg.

I sized up this recipe on the fly (which may have accounted for my comment to come), but I found that the nutmeg was a little much for me. Next time, I'll just use a dash or use cinnamon like some other reviewers have commented. It's so yummy and relaxing... I shouldn't have made it while I was doing homework!

Relaxing... I have been having a horrible time sleeping lately, and I heard that milk can do the trick. Unfortunately I cant stand the taste of milk, so I went looking for some alternatives. glad I found this recipe! It's delicious (and this is coming from somebody who cant even stomach chocolate milk) I did not have nutmeg so I used cinnamon sugar instead, and it taste fantastic. I'm drinking it right now as I type and I'm feeling sleepy already.

Thanks for the recipe!

This is tasty, just like Starbuck's Vanilla Creme.  I'm trying to watch my calorie intake, so I used skim milk and half the sugar.  It took care of my craving for something sweet and is calming as well.

Well, I tired it with nutmeg first and did not like it......It is just because I am not a fan of nutmeg. So I tried it with cinnamon as someone suggested and I really liked it. I give it four stars, but my 8 yr. old daughter gave it five......It also soothed her sore throat.

This is fabulous. it is 2 in the morning, and i am surfing recipes because I cant sleep! I run across this one, and reading the ratings, i had to make it. I have been sipping about 2 minutes and I already feel calm and a tad sleepy. I just might make this everyday from now on. I did not have nutmeg, so I used cinnimon. It was still yummy, and I cant wait to try it with nutmeg...off to bed!

This is a great hot drink right before bed. I didn't even have nutmeg to put in it and it was still great. I only used half of the amount of sugar that it called for, and it was sweet enough. Thanks!

When I found this recipe, I had to get right up and make it.  I made it with Splenda instead of Sugar and it was delicious.  The nutmeg is a great touch. But more than delicious, this just makes you feel good, like a warm blanket around your shoulders.

I made some changes to this recipe, although you can leave it just the way it is. I took out the nutmeg for one, because I didnâ€™t have any. I added two teaspoons of brown sugar, then microwave for the original time. Then I added half a teaspoon of cinnamon. It made it absolutely delicious. Iâ€™ll definitely do this recipe again.

I thought I had nutmeg but discovered I was out when I went to make this, so I used cinnamon instead. Cinnamon doesn't dissolve very well, but it still tastes great. I love this drink! I can't wait to try it the right way!

At our house this is called "magic milk" because we always add food coloring! I have raised 11 grandchildren and my own children on this. They love it!

Excellent drink.  I can remember my mom relaxing with warm milk every morning....and me & siblings at night.  She used honey, & an beaten egg.  Heated milk on stove (no micro in those days).  To Saula's comment re the psycho effects  of nutmeg..Wikipedia states that only occurs when the bean is grated in it's 'raw' form in LARGE quantities,  not the ground form we use in cooking.  Pays to read the article entirely.

Yum!!! I am 13 and I LOVE this. I am not a fan of plain milk, and my mom used to make this for me when I was little.  Now I just make it myself, but its SOO good. I don't use the nutmeg, however. Thanks, its so soothing and yummy!:)

Simple and wonderful. I've been using this recipe for a few years now. Instead of sugar, I usually add honey as I prefer the taste of honey in my milk. I also use skim milk and it doesn't alter the taste at all (at least for me) plus it's a bit healthier than using whole or 2%.

1/4 teaspoon nutmeg?!!! I tried that and it is way to much...Otherwise quite good, though I would use honey instead of white sugar.

This is delicious! I drink it every night before I go to sleep. I was never a fan of warm milk before I tried this. I use a little less white sugar and a couple pinches of brown sugar, as well as nutmeg. I also use real Mexican vanilla. This is by far my favorite recipe! Not only does it taste good, it smells good.

i made this for my son who didn't want to go to bed. I used 1 pk of splenda instead of the sugar and it was plenty sweet. To my suprise he drank it (he's 2 1/2 and been very picky) he did fall asleep shortly after drinking this. I wonder if it worked or a coinsidence? I'll try it again tonight.

Sweet & soothing.  I give it five stars but would actually hold off on a lot of the nutmeg (it was a little overpowering to me).

This recipe was okay! I'm not a huge fan of milk, but I thought I would give this one a try. I tried it and my thoughts were "hmmm, this is different!" I don't know I'll make it again. I do believe though that if you like milk, you'll probably like this recipe!

So easy! And an awesome flavor!  My daughter and have have been drinking this almost every night since I discovered the recipe.  It is a good way for both of us to be drinking the milk we should be.  Last night I slipped a bit of rum into my drink.  That was heavenly!

My son has been having a hard time with sleeping and his ped recommended warm milk before bed, we've been adding a little sugar free chocolate and strawberry syrup to it, but I wanted to try this one out to see what he'd think. It was a little too sweet for him and I think the nutmeg was a little "weird" for him. I used a little less nutmeg than called for and used Splenda instead of sugar and I thought it was a very nice bedtime drink, but think it didn't need as much sweetener and would stick with about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg so its not overpowering.

I'd been having a hard time adjusting my sleep schedule to suit my new class schedule at University, so my mom suggested warm milk. Needless to say, I was out like a light within half an hour of drinking this yummy find. Now I drink a cup every night as part of my before bed ritual. :)

this was delicious! however, i found it too sweet for my taste and reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/2 tbsp. also, i added 1/8tsp of cinnamon and 1/8tsp of nutmeg, but i found that i didn't like the nutmeg flavor in my milk. next time, i will drink it with just 1 tbsp of sugar and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon only. thank you for the recipe! (:

I used a little cinnamon as I didn't have any nutmeg. It was a little sweet for me, but my 9 yr old loved it! 5 stars from him & another 25 from me if he actually goes to sleep!!!

This warm milk was the best milk I have ever tasted or made!! The only thing I did was add a little bit more sugar. I made this for my family and they couldn't get enough of it. Plus it's very easy to make. I WILL definetly make this again

This is incredible! I found this recipe a few weeks ago and have been making it almost every night since.It's also really easy to make once you get the idea that you add a few spoonfuls of sugar and one of vanilla to a mug of milk and heat it.

Yum!  I was not expecting to like this myself - I made it for my 3-year-old daughter - as I'm not a big milk drinker.  But it tasted like Christmas. . .reminded me of a Chai tea latte.  I cut the sugar in half and used freshly grated nutmeg.  My new bedtime ritual. . .

Okay, I messed up and put in the nutmeg while it was heating. We must not be nutmeg people. I love the taste of it in my cake donuts, but the milk did not go over. I will give it 3 stars since we are just not nutmeg fans.

Comforting and yummy...I was a little worried because I used soy milk instead of regular but I still came out with great results. Thanks!  I think nutmeg should go on everything! ;)

I used 2% milk and it was delicious. I reduced the sugar to 2 tsp rather than 2 tbsp, and microwaved it for a shorter time. The nutmeg added a nice touch. The vanilla made it taste extra special!!! I really like this milk and it was super simple.

Made this today for myself and two kids (3&5years) and we all loved it! However, we cut back a tad on the sugar, using 2 teaspoons instead of 2 tablesoons and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Kids want more tonight!

I didn't like this, but to be fair I'm not a big fan of milk. I was hoping to develop a taste for it with this drink, but no luck. I thought it was too sweet, even with the sugar cut in half. I guess I'll stick with the classic glass of ice cold milk with a cookie to make it palatable!

My mother and my brother loved it! They though that it was soothing and comforting. However, I didn't enjoy it. The nutmeg seemed to overpower the taste. Otherwise, it would've been fantastic, but I just couldn't get over the excess of nutmeg.

Never had warm milk before, other than in hot chocolate; but, not being able to sleep tonight, I got up and made some of this.  Very nice flavor.  Next time, I'd replace the sugar with honey, and maybe decrease the sweetness some.  Thank you, Dawn; hope it kicks in soon, or I may have to add a little something more to my next cup! ;-)

This warm milk is so tasty and comforting!  Although it's very hot outside, I was looking for something sweet, and this did the trick.  I didn't read the directions too carefully, and added the nutmeg before microwaving.  Still tastes terrific!

Immediately after finding this recipe tonight, I got up and made it for my daughter and I.  I'll have to admit, I'm a bit sleepy right now!  It was delicious and so comforting!  It reminds me of when I was younger and we would drink Tom & Jerry Mix (from the grocery store) with hot milk during the winter holidays.  So delicious and this drink is just as soothing.  I only have skim milk in the house and it turned out just fine.  I used freshly grated nutmeg, which tasted amazing!  I'm sure I'll be making this often!

A comforting, fragrant drink that is so simple and delicious. I can't believe I didn't think of this combination of flavors! I'll probably be drinking less chai and hot chocolate next winter, thanks to this recipe.

I'm not sure if it's going to help me get to sleep yet but it's amazing I've never been a fan of warm milk because that's all we always did was just warm up a glass of milk, but this tastes like you liquified a cinnamon roll (I substituted the nutmeg for cinnamon as I don't have any nutmeg) and put it in a glass will definitely make this again.

Love the base recipe. I made it for my 12 year old who wanted warm milk. I lowered the sugar to around half of what was called for. Still very tasty and he loves it!

This seems so simple, but it was so much better than I expected.  I was leery of the amount of sugar but it worked perfectly.  I heated the milk in a glass measuring cup then poured in a mug when it was hot - that way no super-heated ceramic mug to deal with.  I grated nutmeg directly in to it.  The combination of flavors is fantastic.  A great bedtime drink.

I absolutely LOVED this drink!!! it was delicious in every way. I am not really a nutmeg person, so we made this with cinnamon instead. None of can have dairy either (its an allergy) so we used almond milk original instead. Lastly, we made it on the stove in large amounts. everyone enjoys it very much, thank you for this amazing recipe!!

I'm vegan so I decided to try to make this recipe but plant based! Swapped the regular milk for almond milk and the white sugar for coconut sugar. Awesome! the proportions are just right and the heat time make it's just the right temperature. Let's see if it helps me sleep since I feel sick!

I made this with half and half and really enjoyed it. I knew 2 tablespoons of sugar would be too sweet for me, so I cut the sugar down to 2 level teaspoons. It was perfect. Next time I will add a little cinnamon along with the nutmeg. I bet that will be even better.

This was, amazing. I'm not usually one to drink warm milk ever and this was delicious. I added the nutmeg, and I changed it up a little by adding some cinnamon and stirred it well after heating in the microwave, also, I didn't add a lot of sugar, only about 1 TBSP. I am lactose intolerant and this tasted very identical to egg nog without the heavy cream and I used 2% milk, it was outstanding! Highly recommended and I will definitely make it more often.

I couldn't find nutmeg, so I used the allspice spice ( not the salty seasoning). I also added almond extract with the vanilla extract, about 0.5 tsp each. This was delicious!

So good! Though, the amount of nutmeg was very overpowering, I divided the 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg by 3, for 1/16 teaspoon. Much better! It'd even be good without nutmeg at all!

A true favorite at our house. I use less than half the sugar called for though and only a sprinkle of nutmeg over the top of each serving, but this is a clear winner, thank you for sharing this gem!!!

This is delicious! The first time I made this exactly as written, and it was a little too sweet for me.  The next time, I reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon and it was perfect.  The flavor of this drink is wonderful - thanks for the recipe!

I fell in love first glance upon the recipe!  Just what I was looking for with the perfect amount of nutmeg too!    Some close friends and I enjoyed it on the weekend together and agreed it was truly sublime.  
Here is what I used;
- 1 cup of Unsweetened Almond Milk
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla extract (purchased in Mexico)
- 2 tablespoons of coconut sugar (100% pure coconut sap)
- 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg (the ideal quantity)

I really liked this.  My mom was not the type of mom to make this for us as kids, but as a mother myself now, I was looking for something that would be comforting to my toddler (because he's a ball of energy right now!)  I tried this last night exactly as specified in the directions, only on the stove to keep the nutritional value intact.  I have to say that I liked the sweetness, but will tone it down for my child.  The nutmeg was good but take my advice and don't drink it until the last drop, you'll get a mouthful of nutmeg particles in your mouth.  Overall very satisfying & yes, I felt sleepy afterwards.  Thanks for submitting.

I left out the sugar but did add just a tiny bit of honey, plus a pinch of cinnamon. And my week of insomnia ended like that! Tasted great but not overpowering. Definitely will be trying this again.

Too much of everything in this beverage. 2 TBS of white sugar was WAY too sweet for me. 1 tsp of vanilla is overpowering, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg seemed like too much. Try this: 1 tsp of brown sugar or honey, only a couple drops of vanilla, pinch of nutmeg (1/8 tsp) and pinch of cinnamon (1/8 tsp).

yes, however I left the sugar out and substituted my original silk almond milk. It made for a much lighter; texture (it is already like drinking cream to me),
kept the sweetness down (that is why I don't buy the other versions),
and the calorie/carb count down,  as I have been holding at 39 for awhile and don't need the weight gain. 
Also works well at keeping you warm during the winter when heat is kept low.
Most recipes used cinnamon but I'm allergic and can't have my chocolate anymore.

Thanks for the healthy alternative to flavor.

My grandmother always made 'vanilla milk' for me when I was growing up and I loved it. I made it for my children and now grandchildren and we all enjoy it. Its equally good cold in place of chocolate milk. I know this wouldn't be done today but my grandmother would beat an egg into the milk along with a bit of whiskey when we were feeling poorly. It always helped lol but of course that may have been the alcohol!!

Great beverage for adults and kids alike!  Thanks for this recipe!  I altered a little.  I halved the sugar, since I'm trying to reduce my family's sugar intake.  Also, I did 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.  We used skim milk and brown sugar.  It was warming and calming and heavenly on a chilly September afternoon.

Been having a hard time getting my toddler to sleep and to drink milk. I used organic homogenized milk and substituted the sugar with 1 tsp of a agave nectar. And kept everything else the same. Magic! My 10 yr old loved it too.
Thank you!

I didn't have the extract, so i mixed in half a teaspoon of vanilla corn syrup and it's magical. Very soothing and a great way to down my milk,  reminds me of a chai tea latte

I absolutely believe that drinking warm milk calms and relaxes you... we all drank warm milk as babies. It's funny that I stumbled across this recipe because I do drink just plain warm milk whenever I cannot sleep and it instantly calms me down and helps me sleep.  So I gave this a 5 star rating.. and also next time I will try to make it with the vanilla, sugar and nutmeg :-)

DELISH!!! I haven't had warm milk in many years. I just so happen to catch The Doctor Oz show this afternoon. He was proving and disproving mother's tales one of which was weather or not warm milk really helps you sleep. It was indeed true. Since, as of late, I've had trouble sleeping I decided to try it. I like milk, but the idea of drinking warm after all this time just didn't sound very tasty. So I took to Google as I often do and BINGO...just the twist I was looking for! I tried the recipe just like it says, even though I'm not a big fan of vanilla. I don't like to knock things before I try them. Gotta say, I'm still not a fan, lol! So I omitted the vanilla and switched the nutmeg for cinnamon (just a pinch). Now I'm REALLY in love. Hopefully this version of warm milk will make my dreams come true ;)

i have made this forever now, it really helped when i was pregnant and trying to get to sleep.  It has now become a tradition when me and my husband are wide awake and needing to go to bed.  

We have also done almond extract instead of vanilla, and makes for a yummy twist.

This is a delicious warm drink. I often drink a cup of warm milk before bed and I will make this when I want something different than plain milk. It's very soothing. Tastes like a coffehouse drink.

I generally make this without the nutmeg, because I find it doesn't dissolve and floats on top.

Hmm..I am sipping this drink as I write this review. I used sweet and low in place of the sugar and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Tastes wonderful! Hmmm....

Absolutely perfect.  Will probably use cinnamon instead of nutmeg for the kids.  I used sugar substitute and it was wonderful. About to doze off right now ;)

Absolutely scrumptious. Because i am not much a fan of Cow milk I used Meyenberg's Goatmilk and it was rich and creamy. definitely a keeper. will try it again in the winter.

Cut down to 1 tbsp of sugar-trying to put my nephew down he likes it, and so do I!

Very good!  I kept everything the same except I didn't measure the nutmeg & added cinnamon.  I just added 2-3 shakes/sprinkles of each.  It was a really nice warm drink that won't keep you up all night (like hot chocolate!). Thanks!  *I also tried this with lowfat milk & Splenda instead of sugar to cut the calories & fat.  It didn't change the taste.

Not too great; couldn't finish the cup.  Hot cocoa tastes much better.  I tried it with cinnamon, not nutmeg, though.

My husband and I wanted to drink something warm and sweet tonight but with no caffeine. I came accross this recipe and decided to give it a try. It was delicious and just what we needed on this cold winter's night. I'd cut the sugar to 1 tablespoon next time though, found it a bit too sweet for me, but my husband says it was perfect.

Very tasty.  I only used 1/8 tsp. of the spice and it was plenty.  The first time I used nutmeg, but the second used cinnamon.  The kids liked it better with the cinnamon.  Perfect for our snowy day.  Thanks for the recipe!

As I'm sitting here sipping this, I'm in heaven! Reminds me of my grandma. I did sub 1 tbs of honey for sugar and used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg. This is simply wonderful!

Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I love to have it in the morning.
Instead of using white sugar though I use a teaspoon or so of brown sugar in mine.

Personally, I found it too sweet. I toned down the sugar, and added a pinch of nutmeg instead. Although it was pretty good, if given the option of a sweet milk tea or this, I'd choose the sweet milk tea.

I started making this right after I read it. It was so delicious, and the nutmeg really gave it a good flavor. I made some for my parents and brothers and they just loved it! Excellent to drink before bed. Wonderful.
