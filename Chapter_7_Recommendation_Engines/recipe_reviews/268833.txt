I followed the recipe but added diced uncooked carrots and celery to the mix before putting into the loaf pan.  I would imagine sauteed, diced mushrooms would also be a good addition.  I served with Red Mashed Potatoes (whipped with only olive oil, the starchy potato water and chicken or veg broth) and a Mushroom Gravy.
