I feel that these are too sweet for a savory muffin.  I also feel that this recipe could use more flavour.  It's really bland/sweet as written. THX

The previous reviewers said this was either too sweet or too bland. So to solve these issues, I used a cornbread mix that didn't have as much sugar as this recipe calls for and added some cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper to the recipe. The muffins are fantastic with these adjustments!

These muffins turned out well.  They are a bit dense but pack a healthy punch with the spinach.  I added some dried chiles to up the spicy factor, which worked well.  I also only had marble cheese in the house; I think plain cheddar would have been better for more flavour.  I will make these again!

I made these in my miniature muffin pans and although they were good- they were not great!  I baked for 15 min. It needs to be sweeter so I will add more brown sugar- so I will try 1/3 cup next time and then add some seasonings-maybe 1 tsp of italian seasoning.  I will let you know if this helps to give it the WOW factor!

I really liked these. You can hardly taste the spinach and the jalapeno added a nice little kick. I halved the recipe and it only ended up making 5 standard muffins.

The spinach adds a nice flavor (and vitamins) and it was moist. I would definitely bake these again.
