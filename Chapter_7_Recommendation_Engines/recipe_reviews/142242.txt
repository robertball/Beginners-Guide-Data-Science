This fabulous side dish is another example of "less is more" and "the simpler the better."  No reason to change a thing here and, frankly, to do so would ruin the dish.  Subtley flavored and pretty. Wonderful flavor, and I think to omit the Parmesan cheese would leave this sorely lacking. I can't comment on how this tastes the next day as I made this scaled to 2 servings and hubby and I ate every grain. In fact, I served this with "Mushroom Stuffed Chicken Rollups" tonight, also from this site, and I'll have to make this orzo again tomorrow night as hubby requested we have this same meal again tomorrow night! Thank you, kgwen, for your delicious recipe. We were in culinary heaven tonight!

As written this recipe may be a bit bland, but the base of the recipe is quite good.  Read a few reviews and adjusted to personal taste:  (1)Doubled the tomato/basil mixture, (2) added the zest and juice of one lemon (3) added a splash of red wine vinegar (4) added kalamata olives, (5) added a bunch of fresh parsley, (6) added about a teaspoon of dried organoe,(7) and finally topped it off with some feta cheese once it throughly cooled.  Great!

This could be a 5 star recipe. I did not add any olive oil. The oil packes sund dried tomoatoes in enough. I even dumped some of this oil out. I added about a 1/3 cup red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. It always tasted better the next day. Net time I will add black olives.

Wow! This is nice. If you haven't cooked with sun dried tomatoes before, you are in for a treat! They are very different from canned and fresh tomatoes. They have a little chew to them and are a bit sweeter compared to fresh. Next time I might add a little sauteed garlic or Italian sausage (sounds yummy just thinking about it!). If you are still unsure about using sun dried tomatoes or if you aren't a tomato lover, then try them in this dish or on a homemade pizza. Trust me!

Make the pesto sauce ahead of time and add the salt, and pepper right to the food processor or blender with the sun dried tomatoes and basil.  Set this aside until you cook the pasta.  Once the pasta is drained but still hot, try adding feta cheese and oilive oil(this will give it a creamy consistency but omit the parm cheese).  Finally add then the pesto sauce.  The result will be creamy with mingling flavors: good served hot or cold.

This recipe is a family favorite.  We have made it twice since last week when I first came across it.  The first time I halved the orzo but kept the rest the same and it had perfect flavor.  The second time I made it for dinner and for a heavier meal I made it with bow-ties upping the amount of sun-dried tomatoes.  We love this!!!  This is a family favorite!  Thank you so much!!

This recipe tasted nice.  I made a few changes, including boiling the orzo in vegetable stock to give it extra flavor and adding feta instead of parmesan cheese to give it a more Greek taste.  I also added pine nuts to give it a bit of a crunch!

I have made this with parmesan and with feta, both are very good, but I think the feta wins overall in our house. When using feta, I sprinkle it on right before serving, then with leftover I add it to the orzo after it cools. I drain my sundried tomatoes (doubling the amount called for) and cut them into 1/2 inch strips, chiffonade the basil and add kalamata olives. We personally like the texture and distinct tastes better. This is a great dish as you can serve warm with dinner as a side dish, and have a great cold salad for lunch the next day.

We make this all the time as a main dish. For two of us we use 1 cup orzo, 1/3 cup pesto (which we usually have on hand and we have made it both ways and don't taste a big difference), 1/3 cup julienned sun dried tomatoes, and 3/4 cup Parmesan. We just cook the pasta and dump the rest of the ingredients in & stir! Much easier than using a food processor! You can add salt & pepper to taste. We add shrimp to make it a main dish. Very quick, easy, & TASTY!!

This is an easy tasty pasta dish. 
I honestly had to make more!!! It went fast! It was a little bland to our liking so i threw in more sundried tomato and salt and some red pepper flakes to give it a kick.

Super yummy.  We ate every last bite of it and plan on making it again very soon.  My sun-dried tomatoes were not packed in oil, and 1 tbsp of oil was just enough.

Thanks for sharing this delicious flavor combo! I make my orzo a little differently and I halved the recipe as it is just the 2 of us. I melt 2 tbsps butter in a saucepan and then add a cup of orzo and saute until lightly toasted.  Add 14.5 ozs of water and 2 teaspoons of chicken base and bring to a boil. Boil for about 15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. I then added the tomatoes, basil and Parmesan cheese. Salted and peppered to taste and left out the olive oil as it had great flavor, and I didn't feel it was needed.  Loved it!

I thought this was rather decent, I can see me changing one slight thing in this recipe. decrease the amount of basil I chop and stuff into a 1/3 cup. Thats where, I feel it was over powering for me. My family liked it, my son was a 3 star because of the tomatoes but still ate it. What I did when chopping the basil was chop and stuff, chop and stuff into the measuring cup...not next time. I'll chop and toss into the cup, when it reaches the top...I stop. Plan and simple. As much as I love basil in some things..I don't like the overwhelming flavor of it to the point I can't taste anything else. And in this case...it's exactly what I did. But the ease of the ingredients and the quickness to throw it together, is a 5 star. Live and learn. ;-)

This was delicious and very easy to make. The only change I made was to use the oil from the sun dried tomatoes instead of straight olive oil. A lovely accompaniment to Italian Rib Eye from this site. Thanks!

Made tonight...awesome.  But also used as a base.  I did not add olive oil but simply used the rest of the flavored oil in the sun dried tomato jar.  I also squeezed half a lemon on top, and added a LOT more herbs from my own garden (basil, oregano, parsley), plenty of pepper and then i also cut up some fresh baby spinach.  Salt/pepper to taste and voila!  Know it will be even better tomorrow morning for hubbie's lunch through the week :)

Very quick and easy, but bland.  I used feta along with red pepper flakes then decided to toast pecans for an added interest.  Saved the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes and used it in place of the olive oil.  RLM

This is a great "idea" recipe! Like so many others I tweaked it just a bit to fit my tastes. Instead of orzo I used pipettes. I used regular sun dried tomatoes instead of oil packed and added a little starchy pasta water to help everything blend and keep the oil down. Then I tossed in 4 or 5 pitted kalamata olives, 1/2 a small shallot, a garlic glove, 1 tbs of vegan parmesan (instead of 3/4 cup) and 1 tbs giardiniera on top of the other ingredients (minus the salt - the olives are pretty salty). Then I mixed it all with the warm pasta and topped with a bit more vegan parm. Even my ridiculously picky husband liked it. I will be making again! So simple!

I'm only giving 4 stars because I had to tweak this a bit. I've made this several times and don't even measure anything anymore. I definately use a lot more sundried tomatoes. I buy them in bulk (dried, not in oil) and use about half a pound. Once chopped, they equal about 3/4 of a cup. I use a little more basil too. The only addition I make is when I'm ready to serve, which is usually cold, I top with extra parm and toasted pine nuts. The pine nuts really make this dish.

Yum, a keeper! I used two 7.5 oz jars of sun-dried tomatoes (undrained), 4 oz of fresh basil, 2 or 3 oz of Parmesan (a better grade), a bit of salt and some goodly shakes of pepper to a whole box of orzo.  I added olive oil after I blended the pesto in the food processor, and only enough to make the consistency blendable with the orzo.  I want to try this with feta, and adding sliced olives would be great for either cheese - if my family didn't have a tendency to pick them out!

Yummm, tomato and basil. What's not to like?! This dish was so delicious! We happened to already have some sun dried tomatoes in the fridge and then ran across this recipe and thought it'd be perfect. We only made one change and that was adding some more of the sun dried tomatoes. Didn't need any salt or pepper. The cheese gave it plenty of flavor. We had this by itself for dinner and was plenty filling. Thanks for sharing! :)

I cheated. Rather than prepare Orzo, I mixed the other ingredients with brown rice. I'd do it again.

I made this over the weekend and it was a big hit with my family and our guests.  Next time I will add a bit more sun-dried tomatoes, but that is just because we love them.  It was simple and delish - both warm and cold, and I look forward to making it again.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

We found this recipe fairly bland and doctored it up with artichoke hearts, black olives and balsamic vinegar which helped but didn't make it "wow".

Whenever I used to come home from work travels my husband would have a pint of Safeway's orzo/spinach salad waiting for me in the airport. Sweet, right?   But expensive.   I'm a big orzo fan, and in an effort to cut down on our monthly food costs I decided to give this recipe a whirl. This is an A in my book, and was easily transformed into an A+ with some freshly chopped spinach and feta cheese (combined with or in lieu of Parmesan; your choice). Plus, it was only $5.00 to make enough orzo salad for my husband and I for the entire week! Score!

I made the recipe exactly as written except for the addition of feta cheese on top. I thought it was pretty good with a little more salt, unfortunantly my family did not like it.

Yummy!  I ended up using mini shells instead of orzo because my grocery store didn't have any, but this was super tasty!  My husband preferred it warm, right after it was made, but I liked it both cold and warm.  I was making it for a family get together, so I doubled the amount of pasta but tripled the other ingredients.  I made it in a blender because I don't have a food processor and it worked great!

Seriously IN LOVE with this recipe - it's so versatile and has become a weekly staple in our menu. Love it as is and works well as a "meal" with some homemade bread.

Ok, when my guys smelled it, they turned their nose up, but after tasting it they loved it. Of course, I made changes to suit their tastes and after reading other reviews. So, I added a clove of minced garlic, a very thin slice of minced red onion, and some chopped kalamatas. I combined everything beforehand to allow time for the flavors to meld. Then I cooked the orzo in veg broth, drained and mixed everything before cooking the steaks to allow some time for the flavors to coat the pasta. I will be making this one again.

Very tasty! I read the reviews and noticed some said it was a little bland, so I cut the orzo in half but left everything else the same. Turned out great - very flavorful. Tasty when warm too! I saved myself from having to wash the food processor and just chopped everything up by hand.

I am surprised that so many people loved this recipe. (It's hard to tell if people are rating the original, or their doctored up versions).  This was extremely bland.  I can imagine a lot of ways to improve it, but I can't recommend as it is written.

I just made this for our dinner. I added shrimp, feta cheese instead of Parmesan and Greek Olives. I have enough left over for my lunch tomorrow. I cut the recipe in half since there are just two of us. I would recommend this to anyone who asks :) Thank you for posting it!

WOW!!  Great recipe!  Just made for a BBQ later in the day, since I read that it is good cold, too. I boiled the orzo in veg broth and doubled the basil-tomato mixture.  I also added some toasted pine nuts for some crunch.  Even my 1 YO loved it!!!  Thanks so much!!

Now one of my favorite side dishes!  The only changes I made were to double the basil and sundried tomatoes.  I also added some bullion to the water I cooked the orzo in to give it a little more flavor.  Used some of the oil from the sundried tomato jar instead of olive oil. This is a very simple recipe but really delicious!

I loved this.  I have recipe very similar to this that I really like better as I added some feta cheese, some canned artichokes and sliced olives then stuffed large scooped out tomatoes using the scooped portion with the orzo.  If you want to get a little fancier try this sometime.

Cut the recipe in half and followed the adjusted ingredients amounts.  It has a delicate flavor when made as written.  Next time I'll follow some of the other reviewers advice and add more of the basil/tomato mixture and maybe add some feta cheese and/or red wine vinegar and kalamata olives.

A great, simple recipe.  I followed the ingredient amounts exactly but I kept the tomatoes and basil separate because I wanted to taste those flavors individually.  My only slight complaint is that there is no garlic in the recipe, but I put garlic in just about everything so I am a bit bias.  This is a delicious recipe and I'll be making it often.  Thanks :)

This was good, but a little bland. I really loved the flavours that were there, I just wish there was more of them. I will make again, but cut the amount of orzo in half next time.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I agree with some other reviewers that it was much better with a clove of garlic.  But it was just DELICIOUS!!  It was great warm and cold, but I think I like it better cold.  Thanks kgwen!!

I made sure to review after letting this sit for a day, but I have to agree with others who've stated that this recipe is somewhat bland. My food processor may not have chopped up the sun-dried tomatoes enough(?), but either way I think using a little less pasta would help, too. I will definitely be making this again, however, using the above changes.

This was good but I made a few changes. I used a lot more sundried tomatoes and I added the oil from the tomatoes. I used goat cheese instead of Parmesan. Finally I added a few splashes of red wine vinegar for some punch. I brought it to an event and it was a big hit. I'll definitely make it again.

We LOVED this. I used half the orzo, half the oil. Used 1/2 cup of feta added when orzo was hot. Used a Tuscan herb infused olive oil for the oil and garnished with pine nuts. took the advice of another reviewer and added the salt and pepper to the food processer when making the pesto.  We're looking forward to having it tomorrow as a cold salad.

Really light and refreshing.  I changed a few things.  I browned my orzo in a bit of butter in a skillet, then covered with chicken broth and simmered till broth absorbed and orzo was tender.  Added leftover grilled rosemary chicken and swapped out the basil for an italian seasoning blend.  Made it into a complete meal, which was (mostly) enjoyed by everyone.  Not the kids' favorite, but they all ate it.

I found this recipe to be really easy but the orzo to be just ok. I had to spice it up a lot. I served it hot and after following the original recipe, I added sautéed garlic, onions and spinach into the orzo. I used grated parmesan cheese to taste (which ended up being a lot) as well as salt, and very little pepper. I also used lemon juice and a pinch of brown sugar. After those altercations the dish was great. Ill defiantly make it again!

This was sooo good - I did follow the recipe pretty closely with the exception of using dried basil and not using the food processor for the dried tomatoes.
Orzo is such a neat rice/pasta side dish.
I served it warm.

Great recipe I followed this exactly, I did add 1/2 cup of mini heirloom tomatoes. This was a wonderful orzo salad, certainly something I would make again.  Perfect summer side.

A splendid, summer dish. I served it as a pasta salad.
I followed the advice of the comments below and added the black olives, dried oregano, fresh parsley and a splash of lemon juice. I added small mozzarella balls and a few rocket salad leaves for decoration. 
Thank you for the recipe!

Wonderful pasta side dish! I love sun dried tomatoes and with parmesan cheese and fresh chopped basil mixed in with the orzo pasta it is simply 5 stars in my book. I scaled down this recipe for two people thou I wished now that I hadn't because we gobbled this up and it was just tasty. I added a T of olive oil instead of 2T because I used some of the oil from the sun dried tomato jar to add some flavor to the pasta. I seasoned this with salt and black pepper and served this warm alongside, "Mushroom Stuffed Chicken Roll Ups," and "Smothered Green Beans, " all from this site. They complemented each other very well. Amazing flavors and wishing I could have some more!

Nice recipe.  I did not have fresh basil, so I used marinated artichokes which obviously didn't give the same zingy flavor so I had to add some additional dried herbs to give it a kick.  Served it cold with the Caribbean Holiday marinated shrimp recipe from this website.  Beautiful meal sitting on the back of a yacht in the Bahamas.

very nice. it's a good idea to reserve the oil and add it incrementally to your taste. (if you like this, i recommend the sun-dried tomato tapenade on this site as well.)

I made this because I had all the ingredients. I didn't think it would be anything great. I was so wrong! Yummy! I am making it again with ditalini pasta tonight for dinner. I like it cold and I'm gonna leave out the olive oil and drizzle a little of the sundried tomato oil on instead. I love it with crushed red peppers and sea salt. Gotta go I'm drooling all over the computer keys.

I thought this was a great recipe but had to add a bit extra. I sauteed some garlic and through in some fresh, chopped spinach. I didn't have fresh basil but did use the kind in the jar. I didn't bother to use a food processor for the tomatoes but I did chop them up by hand. Overall, it's a great recipe! I've made it several times.

This is an excellent side dish.  We thought it needed more salt, but otherwise a great balance for flavor.

This dish is fabulous!!  I used the suggestions to add olives and feta cheese.  Other than the two additions, I followed the recipe.  It was amazingly tasty.  It would be a nice touch to sprinkle some fresh herbs on top while the cheese is still warm and serve immediately.  This is going to be a keeper in my recipe box!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it is restaurant quality in my opinion. I took others advice and used some feta cheese instead of parm since I happened to have feta I wanted to use. I didnt measure it, just added it to taste when the pasta was hot. I also added some fresh lemon juice to the basil/tom mixture.  I will be making this again for sure!

Fantastic! I made it for a small gathering and everyone loved it. I cooked a box of orzo, doubled the sun-dried tomatoes and basil, and then added the olive oil and parm cheese to taste. A new favorite!

Definitely not bland! But too salty with that much parmesan plus the salt! It's still pretty salty with 1/2 cup parm and no salt. Tasty though.

I followed this to a "T", except that I added one clove of raw garlic to the pesto mixture and used Romano cheese,  I was AWESOME with baked stuffed chicken breasts and salad.

I used 1/2 cup of Sun Dried tomato, 1 1/4 cup of parmsean, and a clove of garlic. My roommate still thinks it's a little dry but I liked it. I think the key is to chop the basil and sun dried tomato mixture up really small so that it spreads throughout the orzo better.

This was good but needs more oil.  I did double ingredients of sundried toms and basil.  Flavor was excellent just needs more moisture.

Pretty good if you follow the recipe as stated. But it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. I'm gonna add in some of the additions other reviewers made next time I make it.

Very easy, and tasty (esp. the next day).  I served room temp. & thought it was good.  Kids did not like, which is fine because it leaves more left-overs for me the next day. :)

Excellent recipe.  I halved the recipe for less servings and once I tasted it, I immediately regretted making less.  I'll be using this recipe lots this summer.  I think this will be perfect to bring to pot luck--something a little different at the table.....

Wonderful dish, loved it!  I cut this in half since it was just hubby and I and used sun dried tomatoes not in oil since I don't usually buy them that way.  Otherwise, prepared this as called for and enjoyed every bite!  Will definitely make this one again.  Served with grilled salmon on the BBQ and green salad!

I really liked this but hubby wasn't that impressed.  I think this would have been a little more flavorful if I had added a couple cloves of garlic to the tomato/basil mixture as other reviewers have done.  Overall, this is a really light and tasty side dish that I'm sure I'll make again.

I make something almost identical to this.  In my version I add some frozen peas that have been defrosted and a bit of crushed red pepper flakes to give it a subtle heat.

This is a very easy and fantastic recipe to prepare. We didn't want to take out the big food processor so we just chopped the basil and sun-dried tomatoes together with a big sharp knife....being careful to chop it very fine. We added roasted pine nuts.

I love this recipe.  I've made it a lot, so I do a lot of tinkering with the way I make it, but the main change I recommend is increasing the sun-dried tomatoes.  It gives the recipe extra flavor.  The other changes I make are mostly for convenience so that I can do most of the work ahead of time.  Here's the way I make it: I chop two 1-oz packages of fresh basil and put them in a food processor.  I add an 8.5 oz jar of sun-dried tomato halves (marinated in oil with some spices).  I chop that in the food processor and put it in a tupperware container.  I add 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and about a tablespoon of olive oil (because of the oil in the jar of tomatoes, this would even be okay without any extra oil).  This makes around 2 cups of sauce, which I can then refrigerate for a week or so.  When I'm ready for a quick meal, I cook up some orzo and stir in some parmesan cheese and sauce.  The sauce is very flavorful, so it goes a long way.  2 cups is more than enough for a family dinner.  I've tried this recipe both cold and hot, and I definitely like it better hot.

I made this exactly as suggested. It was ok but i felt a bit bland. I would increase the basil snd tomatoes. Also i would follow a previous reviewer  and cook the orzo in chicken or vegetable broth.

Awesome side dish. I did cheat though, using  sun-dried tomato-basil pesto, garlic and added sliced baby ports. Served with Grandma's Chicken Chardon(from this site) . Top-notch meal 
Have made over and over. It is also excellent with spinach added.

So simple and so delicious. I used feta instead of parmesan and added some sliced black olives. Huge hit - was even asked for the recipe!

2 cups of uncooked orzo makes a boatload of pasta.  I'd say it's more like 12 servings rather than 8. I followed others suggestions and added more Parmesan, a cup, maybe more.  I added juice from one lemon, a few sliced  Kalamata olives and some goat cheese. We had several days of leftovers, and it held up well.

Really wonderful!  I do not have a food processor so just chopped up the basil and tomatoes well.  Also added just a dash of olive oil as the oil from the tomatoes seemed pretty much proficient.  Very tasty!

I followed the instructions and found it was a little bland for my taste, so I added an extra teaspoon of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of salt and 2 teaspoons of garlic powder. Voila, perfect!

I've made this numerous times. Occasionally I will add shrimp for a one-dish meal. Also a big hit at parties or BBQs served cold instead of pasta salad. It's delicious!!

7.27.16  My oregano is growing at warp speed, so I did add some to this recipe, but that's the only change I made.  No single ingredient jumps out at you, all blend harmoniously, nothing overwhelms.  What a simple, easy, side dish.  And I love that it can be served either warm or cold.

The beauty of this dish lies in its simplicity of flavors.  Using a quality freshly grated parmesan,  nice Italian sun dried tomatoes,  and fresh basil makes all the difference.  Those that find it bland and try unsuccessfully doctor it with red pepper, feta, or vinegar are missing the point and probably have a rather unsophisticated palate to begin with.  Follow the directions, use quality ingredients,  and enjoy!!

I've used this again and again and again!!  This always comes with us camping.  Hot, cold... whenever!  I also normally add some of the oil from the sun died tomatoes.  Definitely a staple in our house!

Delicious!! I didn't have sundried tomatoes so I chopped a fresh tomato... Still came out scrumptious. I used it as a side dish with salmon, worked perfectly. Boyfriend approved! will definitely use again.

This is very bland when first prepared and served warm.  Just not much flavor.  However, it tastes so much better served cold the next day and it kept well for longer as leftovers.

Had veggies from the garden to use up.  Sauteed chopped red onion, yellow squash, red pepper and a couple of mushrooms in sun dried tomato oil for a minute or two so they remained crunchy. Added the veggies to the orzo along with the suggested red wine vinegar and garlic powder.  Substituted the sun dried tomato oil for the plain EVOO.  This was delicious!  Thank you for a very versatile recipe!

Good basic recipe but needs to be spiced up for our liking.
I used the oil from the tomatoes and did not add any extra oil also added garlic powder, pepper flakes, and oregano.

I thought this was a very good side dish.  My kids were not overly impressed.  They picked around the sundried tomatoes, but I didn't use tomatoes packed in oil, because I wanted to use up some that I had on hand which weren't oil-packed.  That may have made the difference.  I just enjoyed the cold leftovers for lunch . . . the dish seems much saltier than it did when served warm.

This is the BOMB! Served at dinner party and everyone loved it. So easy. I had everything in my pantry and used fresh basil from my garden.

It's four star as it is by our tastes but it's five plus with a little tinkering.  Thought the salad was a bit dry as made by the recipe, although we didn't let it sit overnight which may have changed my opinion.  Added probably 1/3% more each fresh basil and oil from the sun-dried tomatoes.  Added some balsamic and lemon juice to taste, some Walla Walla onion for crunch and some fresh cherry tomatoes out of the garden just because we had them.  The orzo sucked up all that extra juice and it was dynamite.  The wife couldn't wait for it to sit and marinate.   Added some Genoa salami and Kalamata olives to my portion the next day and it was even better.  Thanks to kgwen.

This recipe is very easy and quick to make.  People request I make it for picnics and parties.  I sometimes serve it warm for dinner and then eat it cold all week for lunch.  It is delicious!!!!

Very good. We really enjoyed the sun-dried tomatoes in it and will probably add a bit more next time. Easy recipe for the nice results. Will make again. We did not care for it cold though. Thanks.

This was a nice change of pace for a side dish.  Next time I will add some extra parm or maybe even do feta instead.

This recipe is very, very good!! The only change I made was to add about 2 cloves of fresh garlic to the tomatoes and basil in the food processor and it made it absolutely amazing! I make the full eight servings and enjoy day after day as it's perfect as a dinner side dish as well as great addition to lunch at work!

This was quite good - I hesitate to give it 5 stars because it was a little on the bland side, but still tasted good.  Wish I knew how to give it that extra something it needs - maybe I will try lemon juice next time.  I used 3cups of orzo and doubled the tomatoes & basil.   Also, served it cold the next day (did try it warm and it was much better cold)

Great combination of flavours. I served it at a BBQ, and received plenty of positive reviews. The basil gives this a very fresh tast, and sundried tomato adds a nice sweetness. I'll try it with feta cheese at the next BBQ.

Excellent!!! Made this as a side dish to serve alongside feta chicken (by Debbie). The two went VERY well together. My bf enjoyed this as well (which is a HUGE plus considering that he and I NEVER agree on food). I didn't change a thing - and I wouldn't. This is perfect as is. Next time, I'd like to serve chilled (as a pasta salad). This will definitely be a regular at my house. Thanks for sharing :)

Came out great!  I only cooked one cup of orzo and it was enough for four sides.  I served with simple italian herb chicken and salad.  It also tasted good the next day.  Definitely something you can make ahead of time for picnics and what not.

This was pretty bland.  It is more flavorful the next day.  I liked the idea of a pasta salad with orzo.  It's easier to eat in a picnic setting.

Scaled down to 4 ppl, and still delicious! I used tomatoes that weren't packed in oil, so I replumped them in a mix of 2tbs white wine, 3tbs olive oil while I boiled my orzo. I then added about a tb of that plumping liquid to my processor and used 1 tsp of dried basil instead of fresh. Blended, and followed recipe to the end. SO AMAZING. What a great lunch!

Others enjoyed this, I did not, but I'm not a lover of basil in large quantities.  I prefer a hint of basil flavor. I made this as a request but will not make it again - not the recipe's fault - just my tastebuds.  I will save my orzo (which I love) for other recipes.

Great simple recipe, a suggestion to make it a little more.. exciting would be to server grilled mushrooms over it THEN sprinkle the parmesan over that :D

I kinda had higher hopes for this one...I doubled the recipe which was a mistake because it makes a ton! I just thought it needed something more...more flavor. We served it room temp as a side dish yesterday for Christmas dinner and it was hardly touched. It wasnt bad...just not great...may try again and add maybe some feta or small chunks of provolone. Thanks!

Made this without changes except I didn't add the extra oil, but the day after when it got a little dry I added some of the oil from the sundried tomato jar for extra flavor. This is delicious and everyone loved it. Great because it can stay at room temperature without fear of spoilage.

I've made this for a couple of potluck picnics, and it was a hit both times.  The second time, I addes diced black olives, which was an even bigger hit.

This is a very good side dish, not a ton of flavor but still tasty. I made a few changes, doubled the amount of sun-dried tomatoes, increased the parmesan cheese to 1 cup, doubled the amount of olive oil...to your taste, and added 1 tsp. of garlic powder and an extra 2 cloves of garlic. Good with a chicken dish!

I was unsure if 1/3 cup of sun-dried tomatoes was going to be enough, but there was plenty of flavor!  I took the advice of previous reviewers, and let it sit a day before serving.  It was very flavorful, light, and a nice change from the typical pasta salad!

I love the idea of it, but I thought it was kind of bland and boring.  I noticed another reviewer cut the amount of pasta in half -- I'll it again with this change.  I was so excited when making it because all of the flavors seemed like they would taste incredible mixed, but there way just too much pasta to even catch any flavor!  I'll try to update my review if the modifications work!

I enjoy this dish chilled.  I don't really care for parmesan cheese, so I omitted it.  Made it greek style by adding tomato basil feta cheese and chopped kalamata olives.  Served it with pork tenderloin & steamed asparagus.

This is an easy side dish that tastes great.  I added a little garlic powder, otherwise it was made just as directed.

This was a tasty, very fast recipe.  I also liked that it could be served hot or cold.

This sounds like a good recipe, but I found it bland.

Really needs the cheese to give it that something extra.  I add 2 cloves of garlic to my food processer as well.  I also made this recipes with fresh tomatoes since a guest wasnt a fan of sun dried. (I used 2 roma's and took out the seeds)  Both ways make a great side dish!

I started cooking this recipe believing that I had basil leaves.  Rooting through the fridge I realised I was oh so wrong!  I added some frozen chopped spinach instead.  Clearly the distinctive flavour of basil was lacking but not the disaster I'd expected. Note to self, check the fridge BEFORE you start cooking. I served this with baked salmon fillets.

Very easy as a side dish. I kept in the amount of olive oil since I had dried tomatoes, not packed in oil. Also, my basil went bad before I got to use it, so I used one teaspoon of dried and added I clove of chopped garlic. Everyone in my family enjoyed this along Chicken Cordon Bleu II!

Very tasty!  Hit at home & office - came home w/ no leftovers.  Some liked it hot, others cold but good both ways!  Did follow others in not adding extra olive oil, & when I needed a bit, I just used the oil from when I drained the jar of tomatoes.

This was not quite as flavorful as I was expecting, though I didn't have quite as much basil as the recipe called for.  Still yummy!

This was very good. I left out the extra oil because I felt the tomatoes in olive oil add4ed enough moisture to the dish. Only thing I will do differnt next time is make sure the basil is diced a bit smaller. A few big pieces I got were like eating a leaf :)

Tastes great and quick to make! Family loved it and it was even better after sitting a day. Thanks!
