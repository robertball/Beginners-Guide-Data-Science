This was just GREAT!   One change is that I used uncooked shells -- easier to stuff.  Then covered with tomato sauce and baked according to directions.  Came out perfect.

Great recipe - just a few small suggestions - one is to layer the bottom of your baking dish w/spaghetti sauce and layer the shells on top of that - and definitely add some shredded mozzarella to the filling. I also use fresh spinach vs. frozen. Top w/sauce and mozzarella. Delicious - plus they make wonderful leftovers and keep well frozen!

This was a real crowd pleaser and it was very simple to prepare.  The fat and calories could be reduced by using low fat cheeses, and next time I make it I'll only use half the box of shells since there wasn't enough stuffing for the entire pound.

This is a great simple recipe except for one problem, I used a box of Barilla Jumbo Shells 12oz size and there was not nearly enough filling for them, only filled 1/2 of them. So, either double the filling amount or use only half the box, I can't help but wonder how "Kimber" was able to fill a 1lb box of shells with this amount.  The remaining half cooked shells I have I will fill with a salmon (canned) filling recipe I use often, topped with Alfredo sauce.  Thanks  anyway Kimber.

Very Yummy!  The only thing I did differently was to omit the sausage. Also added a touch of parsley to the ricotta mixture. Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good!  It has lots of possibilities...next time I will try a different stuffing to switch it up, I think brocolli Rabe with black olives and sausage would be delish or sundried tomatoes with spinach and pepperoni.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very delicious and different type of stuffed shell recipe. This is perfect for my hubby as he's not a big ricotta fan.

I used a 12 oz package of shells stuffed lightly, 1 lb of regular sausage (kids don't like Italian), 15 oz of ricotta, 2 eggs, 1 c mozzarella in the filling and a whole jar of spaghetti sauce.  I left out the lemon because I wasn't sure how it would taste.  Has anyone tried it both ways to see if the lemon really makes it better?  Anyway, my kids ages 11-3 loved this and declared it was the yummiest.

Delicious recipe that I only made one change to.  I used the new Italian flavored ground turkey from Jennie O Turkey store instead of the italian sausage, which helped cut down the fat without sacrificing any flavor.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as stated, and it was great.  Thanks.

I loved it! I did make a couple of changes. I put some sauce on the bottom first and I used a 24oz jar total. I subed 6oz of sour cream instead of ricotta and doubled parm cheese. I only used a 12oz box of shells.

This was so good! I did not boil the pasta shells first, like another reviewer, because they were easier to stuff that way. I covered them with more pasta sauce and baked it a little longer since the shells were not cooked beforehand. It tasted really good and makes great leftovers.

This was WONDERFUL!  I cooked it for my boyfriend and he loved it!  I used fresh spinach, as I didn't have time to let frozen spinach thaw - it still tasted great!  I highly recommend this!

Fanstastic!  I didn't have frozen spinach, so I used canned spinach.  I also didn't have any fresh lemons, so I used reconstituted lemon juice, but it still turned out great.  My toddler loved it too!

My family loves this dish. There are a couple things to note however. I did find that there is not enough stuffing for the amount of shells. Just use half the box, or double the stuffing. Also, you really have to get all the water out of frozen spinach or the filling is soggy. I use way more than 2 cups of sauce because I like to pour sauce in the bottom of the pan as well as over the top of the shells. Last thing: This recipe is not worth the effort if you are going to use beef or turkey. The flavor change is drastic if you do not use sausage.

Loved it!!!! Great reviews!!! After the first time I made this recipe I made a double batch and cooked it all up and put them in disposable cooking pans and froze them.  It made 4 frozen dinners and we have already eaten 2 they come out just as good as freshly made.  I would recomment taking them out of the freezer the day before if not in the morning to defrost first.  Thank you for your Recipe it saves the day (well dinner anyways ;))

I probably shouldn't rate/review this recipe because I ended up not making the stuffed shells but instead used the recipe to make more of a casserole or pasta bake.  My local grocery store did not have the large shells so instead I used the small ones.  Other than that, I followed the recipe almost to the tee, except for cutting back on the spinach.  while I like it, my family does not and once I began adding it it, I realized it was going to be a lot of spinach, so you may want to take that into account.  The results were  good.  For the cost of the ingrediants I wouldn't say the recipe was GREAT; but both my husband and oldest son really liked it. I will definitely make it again.

This dish is awesome. Simple and fast to make and great flavors. I made it as posted but doubled the filling as others had suggested. The extra filling is definitely needed if you use and entire package of shells. My 2.5 year old even loved it. I will be adding this to my regular rotation.Thanks for posting this!

Turned out great & easy to make.  Served the sausage on the side instead of in the mixture.  Family loved it, even my Italian mom who makes the best ravioli in the world.

This is a really good recipe!  The whole family loved it.  My husband is notoriously picky about pasta dishes, but he really liked this one.  And it was a good way to "sneak" some spinach to my son!  I made it as written, except:  I added a thin layer of sauce to the bottom of the pan before I put the shells in, and I used about a pound of Italian turkey sausage.  I'll be making this one again.

Awesome!  I used turkey breakfast sausage and I think next time I will use a whole tub of ricotta because I didn't seem to have enough filling to fill all of the shells.  I also used shredded Monterey Jack cheese and a whole large jar of pasta sauce.  GREAT!

These would have been dry had I not used the entire jar of spaghetti sauce.  Next time I will add more ricotta than just the 1 cup because the cheese got lost in the spinach.  With these small changes, these shells offer a nice change to my usual stuffed shell recipe.  Also, there is not enough stuffing mix to fill all the shells from a 12 oz box.

This recipe is awesome!  To cut out some extra fat and calories, I omitted the sausage, and just made them vegetarian.  They were great!  I had some leftover ricotta and noodles, so I combined the ricotta, an extra egg, salt, peper, and parmasan and stuffed the remainder of the shells with the cheese mixture.  My daughter LOVED the cheese only ones!  My husband and I enjoyed the spinach filled ones, and didn't miss the sausage at all.  Delicious!

These are delicious! I made a few minor changes. I used a 12 oz box of shells and I doubled everything in the filling except the spinach and garlic, and omitted the lemon juice. Turned out great!

This was good.........but ended up with way too much spinach in ours.  Too overwhelming......but with a spinach cut back, would be very good.

This is pretty good.  The spinach and the ricotta are the key ingredients ... not cottage cheese.  I put in extra garlic (fresh), omitted the sausage and used homemade marinara sauce.  I did not use nearly as much mozzarella cheese on top, as there really is enough inside the shells.  Make sure to put sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before you put the shells in.

Delicious! Very cheesy and great :) Will definitely make again. Next time I'll cook the meat a little less so it's not too chewy after baking in the oven... But for sure I will be eating this again!

Very yummy!, although I did not use the ricotta cheese, instead used a cup of mozzarella and 1/3 cups of half and  half.  The sauce I used was 1 jar and 1/2 of Pasta Sauce by "Classico" comes in a glass jar, very good.  This one I'll be doing again for my family, no doubt.  
Thanks for sharing this!

I added the spinach last to the filling mixture so that I could eye-ball it. I'm glad that I did because 10 ounces is way too much. I think that an alfredo sauce would be good too. Good recipe and easy to make.

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe so supplemented the ricotta with some small curd cottage cheese.  Mixed a little red pepper flake and more garlic in the stuffing.  The frozen left-overs are wonderful too.  Thank you Kimber!

I added sauted onion, used a vegetarian sausage, strained cottage cheese and served the spinach on the side. This was delicious. Will definitely make it again.

I doubles the stuffing recipe and used these ingredients in the picture. There's no way I could've stuffed all those shells with what this says. I also used breakfast links and chopped it up. No spinach and I put fennel in it too taste a little more sausage like. I also used a whole bag a mozzarella on top. Very yummy and will make it again. Kids and husband loved it. I gave some left overs to neighbors and they liked it, too. Also, I put half the sauce on the bottom of the pan and put the other on top of shells

Delicious recipe! I found I had way too many shells, though, yet the box I bought was only 12 oz. Wondering if I filled the shells too full. At any rate, a delicious dish which I will definitely make again.

It's hard to get a real great cheesy filling for pasta - I used this recipe but put it in manicotti (no sausage, fresh spinach).  Then recently I wanted to make a lasagna and had to search out this recipe for the filling (no sausage/spinach this time) and it was great!  Very versatile and I'm sure one day I will put it in shells too!

This was really good.  The only thing I left out was the lemon as I didn't have any and it was still delicious.  I doubled the recipe and froze a large dish of the shells.  It freezes really well- the frozen version was just as good as the fresh batch.  Thanks for a great recipe!

In my husband's words, "That's pretty sensational."  These were so good.  I stuck to the recipe pretty well and Turned out with 19 shells, stuffed pretty full.  I added 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella to the ricotta mixture and added sauce to the bottom of the pan before putting in the shells to keep them from sticking.  I used the 2 cups of sauce the recipe called for and it was plenty.  The leftovers were almost just as good for lunch today.

I've never made Stuffed Shells before and I found this recipe to be relatively easy to follow. My husband fell in love with these. My mother in law stole a few too...that's how good they were.

This recipe was great. My hubby doesn't like spinach and he was very impressed. The kids also liked it. I added more ricotta cheese, a whole jar of spaghetti sauce, and only used half the shells. Definitely a keeper. Thanks.

Wow, great flavor!  I loved it.  Now, I do have to mention that my 11 year old daughter didn't like it - next time I'll leave the spinach out of hers!  My 13 year old son ate it but wasn't excited!  Maybe keep this recipe for appreciating adults.

Easy, cheesy and delicious!  My family went nutty for the flavor.  I'll make this again using twice the sauce (we LOVE sauce), and because I love to over-stuff shells, I'll probably double every ingredient in the stuffing mixture except spinach (I loved the amount, hubby thought it was too much).  Thanks for sharing!

I think this meal was excellent. I loved it. It was the right amount of everything. This is also my first time making stuffed shells, as a few other reviewers, and I really liked it. I was hesitant at first b/c I was afraid the shells would fall apart and not be able to hold the stuffing, but I was wrong. Everything went fine and I think it only took like like 45 minutes to make this meal..not an hour like the recipe says. Great meal idea.

My wonderful daughter-in-law from Minnesota (I'm from Georgia) made this when I visited my son and her where they live in North Georgia.  If I could rate it above 5, I would.  The only thing I did different was I did not cook all the shells.  I think I stuffed 15 shells. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Used lots more garlic than the recipe called for.  This recipe filled 2 big pans full of pasta shells!  So, now I have one pan full in the freezer to which I will add spaghetti sauce and mozzarella when we want to enjoy this very tasty dish again!

We loved this recipe - but did make some changes.  I used 1 lb of ground beef in place of the sausage.  I also diced a large onion and added that when browning the beef.  As well, because the amount of meat was increased, I nearly doubled the amount of ricotta cheese and I put the juice of nearly one whole lemon into the mixture.  I forgot to add the parmesan cheese to the beef mixture, so I just sprinkled it on top - was still very good.  The only other change I made was to add about 2/3 cup more spaghetti sauce (Hunt's Roasted Garlic and Herb).  Thanks for this wonderful recipe Kimber!

Yum!  This was a winner! Both finicky kids loved it and asked for more!  I used 1/4 egg beaters instead of egg, 5 oz f spinach instead of 10 oz, used Classico Spicy Red Pepper sauce, thought even 1 cup of mozzerella was too much. Couldn't find pasta shells so used 12 manicottis.

My family loved this, even our 3 year old asked for more -- plus it's an easy way to add spinach to a meal!  I used ground beef instead of sausage and added some cubed mozzerella, turned out very good.  I doubled the recipe and froze half.

Oh wow!!  This was wonderful!!  I couldn't find any jumbo shells, so I used manicotti instead...which turned out great.  When reading the ingredients, I couldnt' decide what the lemon juice was for...and I almost didn't put it in (I hate lemon flavored dishes)...but in the end, you can't taste the citrus.  I topped my rolls with 1 full jar of Bertolli Burgandy Wine spaghetti sauce (it's the ONLY jarred sauce I've found that's any good).  I was pleasantly surprised how WELL all the flavours melded together...even the spinach was wonderful!  Yumm!  I'm looking forward to the leftovers at lunch today!!

These were really good. I couldn't find any jumbo pasta shells in two different grocery stores, so I used manicotti pasta instead. It turned out really good, and it was probably easier to make than stuffing the shells. My husband, who spent two years in Italy, even said he would like me to make these again. 
This is the first time I used Italian sausage, and I still don't know why it has a plastic lining around it! But if anyone is wondering, you have to take the lining off to cook the sausage...

I'm a vegetarian so I omitted the sausage and doubled the spinach. I added more garlic to add some spice lost from the change. I didn’t measure out the sauce. I just poured on the whole jar (I like it saucy). It was very tasty.

I LOVE this recipe.  My friends say picky.  I prefer selective.  Anyway,  I was looking for a stuffed shell recipe and this is IT!  My son who is definately going to grow up to be a food critic could not get enough of these shells.  I used ground turkey (I seasoned like sausage) instead of italian sausage.  No one new the difference.

This recipe is so quick and easy to make, and is really tasty and filling.  I'm not a big fan of spinach but I couldn't stop popping these into my mouth! I used ground beef instead of sausage, but you can leave out the meat entirely for a vegetarian option or to use the shells as a side dish.

Easy to prepare, I used uncooked oven ready cannelloni noodles as it’s just easier. Was short on spinach so I diced up some red pepper as well. Drizzled olive oil over stuffed noodles prior to pouring sauce & cheese on top. They didn’t stick together as much as I previously tried.

I was a little worried about how it would turn out, but I followed the previous comments on adding extra sauce and covering it while it baked. I half baked the shells, to the point of them able to be stuffed. However, covering it didn’t really help the cheese melt. It’s in the oven for 20min, but I turned the oven up a tad and left it uncovered for an additional 15min. It worked, but dried out some of the shells. Although, it’s still very tasty!

Yes this is a bit time consuming. Yes It requires many "steps". BUT it is so worth it. Followed recipe exactly except used pork meatballs instead of sausage - what I had - . This is SO good. It makes an even dozen which is perfect for one dinner and one lunch for our family. Thanks for a great recipe.  We loved it.

I used a whole pound of sausage(  just to use it up) and left the other ingredients as listed.  I also put some sauce in the bottom of the pan as suggested by another reviewer. It turned out delicious and I will be making it again.

It was a smash hit and all the talk. I made it for two funerals (not the best place to be the hot topic, but...). I didn’t do the lemon juice, fore went the salt and pepper and garlic and cut it die. To

You only need a single 10oz box of shells. I used the whole container of ricotta cheese and spicy Italian sausage.
Best shells I've had.

I made this and really enjoyed it! I made it as the recipe read for the most part. I doubled the filling as recommended in previous reviews. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen and just wilted it in the residual heat from the cooked sausage. I would add extra sauce next time as I felt the top got a little dry, so some extra sauce would easily fix that.

tastes great! my only issue was that it called for 16 oz of the giant shells, I only had 12, but yet I barely had enough to fill all my shells... I thought I was going to have to make them extra full to use it all and I ended up having to scrape from earlier filled shells to make it work. this made it a little more frustating to make, but it all worked out in the end! I also substituted chicken instead of the sausage, used canned spinach, and added some Parmesan on top when I dished up. Ultimately, great recipe!

Loved  it! I used plain greek yogurt instead of ricotta because I don’t like the ‘grittiness’ of ricotta and fresh sautéed spinach instead of frozen boxed. Took about 10 minutes longer to warm through and melt the cheese.

When I made this I only cooked my shells until they were half way done. This left them firmer and much easier to stuff, didn't have one of them tear on me.  They finished up cooking in the oven.

Only made a few changes,mostly to try to have enough to fill all the shells.Increased the sausage to a whole pound, used 1/2 bag of fresh spinach that I chopped in the food processor. Added an extra 1/2 cup of ricotta and 1 cup shredded mozzarella to the filling and topped it off with a sausage flavored spaghetti sauce. I was concerned that my husband would object to the very green color of the filling , but he actually loved them. Had enough leftover to freeze for another meal.Was able to fill all but 10 of the shells (Barilla Jumbo).

I listened to other reviews, I used fresh spinach minced and wilted to remove moisture but a little more than 1/2 the amount suggested. Used homemade pasta sauce.  Cut back on amount of shells I cooked and still had some left over. I used ricotta I had left over added another egg, nutmeg, spinach and Parmesan and made some just plain cheese stuffed

Tasted great. It came out a little wet on the bottom of my pan and they did not hold together when served. Probably my sauce or shell were overcooked.

This was fantastic! I made the entire box of jumbo shells but only used about half. Not sure if it was because I overstuffed them, but any more wouldn't have fit in my pan anyway. The only changes I made to the recipe was a clove more of garlic (because we LOVE garlic) and I used an entire 15oz container of ricotta.  After measuring out 1 cup of ricotta, there was a small amount left and I didn't want to waste it. My husband and I both had leftovers for lunch and it was equally as good!  I will definitely be making this again since my husband has already requested it!

After making it tonight, I will make some changes.  Cook only half the box of shells; there isn't enough filling for an entire box. The filling is mainly spinach, so next time I'll basically double the other ingredients except garlic and oregano. I agree with another reviewer that I will pour spaghetti sauce in the bottom of the pan before adding the shells then add the rest of the jar. It needs more spaghetti sauce. I didn't add lemon juice because I didn't have any, and I don't think it needs it.

I love recipes like this, it's a change from eating meat. But this is 4 meals for me to eat. I'm the only one who eats this because my carnivorous husband and 5 boys don't like spinach in too many things.

Leave spinach out.  Season sausage with basil, oregano, and fennel.  1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper in sausage/cheese mix.  Sprinkle garlic salt, oregano, and basil over sauce.  Makes about 16 shells so don’t need entire 12 Oz box.

Delicious!  However, I will make a few changes next time.  I ended up doubling the recipe except for the spinach, and there was still too much spinach.  It was really good, but next time I will use less spinach. also would add more sauce.  The flavor of this recipe is really good.

Used 1 lb ground beef + 1/2 lb hot sausage so there would be enough meat to stuff shells.  Skipped the ricotta (don't care for) used cheddar cheese instead.  Sauce on bottom of dish before you put in the shells is a must...very good, will always add spinach into my stuffed shells from now on!

This is excellent. I doubled the filling and it was still not enough for a 12 oz. box of shells, but I bought too much ricotta and spinach so may just make a vegetarian batch as well. I find that adding half of the mozzarella into the filling mix and putting the rest on top before baking is the perfect balance.

Great recipe,easy to make. I used fresh spinach and it worked fine.The only down is that the lemon tends to overpower the recipe. I will eliminate the lemon next time I make the shells

This was great!  I used ground turkey and seasoned with italian seasoning, salt and pepper instead of the Italian sausage.  I must've overstuffed some of the shells because I ran short of stuffing.  But, it still made enough to fill my lasagna pan all the way!  I also used the whole jar of sauce.  Stuffing the shells is a little time consuming, but much easier than I thought it would be.  I added a little shredded italian chz blend to the stuffing along with the grated parm.  I may try the Italian sausage next time.  I highly recommend this recipe!

SOOOO good!  Increased amount of sauce, per recommendations -- used a whole jar of sauce (about 3 cups).  This only made 22 shells, definitely not a whole box.

These were good, but not a whole lot of taste. I followed the exact recipe & I think that next time I make these I will use either less frozen spinach or just go with fresh spinach all together. I think the frozen one just is too soggy, even drying up the liquid. I think it takes away from the flavor of the shells.

Tis recipe has bee a favorite in my house since the first time I made it.  The only thing I changed was the amount of spinach.  For us it was WAY too much, so I use only a 3rd of was is called for.  I also make extra sauce.  Other than that it is absolutely wonderful.  I always make a double batch and freeze one...very easy to pull out last minute.

I added a little heavy cream to the tomato sauce to cut the acidity - delicious!

I made this with turkey sausage and i didn't have any spinach on hand, so I added some drained diced tomatoes to the ricotta- turkey mixture.(to add a little extra something) The shells were delicious!

I love how these shells turned out.  I did substitute mushrooms for spinach though, to make it more appealing for my husband.  It was really delicious.  My husband liked it so much, he helped me stuff the shells the next time we made it!

Fab. As one other reviewer noted, this is not as ricotta-y as many other stuffed shell recipes. As others did, I used fresh spinach, more pasta sauce and fewer shells. 

For those of you with access to Whole Foods: we pan fried two of their organic spicy chicken sausages and threw those in. Divine - just the right amount of heat. 

Thanks for a GREAT recipe :)

I wanted to make something different for the family and tried this, I don't like Ricotta but went ahead with it anyway, the children loved it. To mee it was pretty good as well .  The only thing i did differently was use Sweet Italian Turkey Sausage because the family doesn't eat pork.

I made this for my son's baptism party. I made a double recipe which easily fed 16 people and had a lot left over. Everyone raved about it! I used the Jenny O Italian Turkey Sausage, and part skim cheeses. Still, yummmm...

This recipe was a big hit.  I doubled it as sausage always comes in 1 lb packages.  I used a basil italian sausage.  I used 3 eggs instead of 2, chopped the spinach really fine and also added 1 cup mozzarella cheese to the filling.  I found that I only needed one box of shells, even for double the filling - maybe I filled the shells too full.  It made 31 shells full which I divided into 4 pans.  Ate one that night, froze the other and gave 2 to my friend who just had a baby.  Will be making this again for sure.

This was fine, but I probably won't make it again. This was my first time making stuffed shells, so it was good experience, but it lacked a little something.

This was good!  I used hot italian sausage and it added a nice kick. I also made my own sauce rather than used store-bought. The only issue I had was that it was kind of soupy but then I realized that I forgot to add the egg.  I will make this again - the family loved it!

This was pretty good! It was my first attempt at making stuffed shells. I used ground beef seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, basil and red pepper flakes instead of the italian sausage. I felt there was too much spinach and not enough ricotta. However, they were very good.

This was sooo yummy. I didn't end up using the entire package of shells, but I did use more than 1 cup of ricotta cheese.(the mix looked dry). I also stuffed the shells more than I should have because I only got 19 shells. The sausage was a great addition, I would have never would have thought to use it in stuffed shells. My brother(a chef) attempted to eat around the spinach but eventually gave up and ate it all.  I will most definatly make this again .

These were delicous and easy! My daughter ate more than I've seen her eat of anything, and my husband ate TEN of the shells in one sitting, he loved them so much. The filling would be fantastic inside calzones... This recipe is now a family favourite which will be made often. Thank-you for sharing it!

This is a great recipe.  I followed the directions exactly as writen except that I took half (1 cup) of the mozzerella cheese and mixed it in with the cheese/sausage mixture to stuff inside the shells.  Very tasty!

It was good, but nothing spectacular.  I substituted the Italian Sausage for ground beef, added some basil and onion powder also.  If I do make it again, in addition to those modifications, I will cut back on the amount of spinach...it was mostly spinach and would expect CHEESEY stuffed shells to be exaclty that, but it wasn't.

I thought that this was going to turn out MUCH better than it did...I was a bit disappointed.  I suggest using a very thick sauce with it, this could have been part of my problem.  It was just missing a little "something" I thought.  For the time it took it was not all that impressive...

These were very good, but the filling was a little dry.  I will probably make these again, but try to add something to the filling to moisten it up  bit.

This is a very good recipe. Only I found it needed more sauce and I added parmesan to the top for the last ten minutes of baking.

This was excellent, and very easy.  Even my picky 4 yr old liked it.  I had to many shells to fit in the pan, so I stuffed them and then put them in the freezer.

Great recipe. My husband loved this as did my children. I just added some things to my spaghetti sauce to make it like my hubbie does ~ 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and a few other spices. They asked for it for dinner again the next day!

I didn't rate this recipe because so much depends on the kind of sauce you use. I used Ragu and I did not like it at all. Next time I will use either homemade sauce or a higher quality jarred sauce. I also used ground turkey, but found that the flavors just didn't blend well with the spinach and ricotta. Also, this recipe calls for too many shells. I ran out of filling.

I didn't care for this too much.  Admittedly, I had to use ground beef instead of sausage, so maybe that is why the flavor was lacking.  It was a bit dry.  My other recipe for stuffed shells is better.  Thanks anyway.

Turned it into a vegetarian dish by leaving out the sausage, but was still great!
