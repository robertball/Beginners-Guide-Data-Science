Wow! I'm so glad you ladies are enjoying the Dirty Girl Scout.  It's too bad we don't all live in the same place, because we could have a DGS party!  I read your reviews (thank you) and had a couple things I thought I would add. You can use white creme de menthe if you don't want it to be green.  I used Kahlua as the coffee liquor and Bailey's as the Irish Cream liquor in the original.

Very good Christmas drink.  I like it with an extra shot of the coffee liqueur in it.  We did a taste test . . . one with Kahlua, and one with Durango.  We liked the Durango coffee liqueur much better, as it has more flavor, and less of an alcohol taste.  The name was so fun that we had to try it :o)

ooh, this was great! It really suited its name, coz the drink was this awful murky green (fabulous). I was afraid the vodka would make it too alcohol-tasting but it didn't at all. It was really strong so I added in some heavy cream and sipped away at it.

This was way too strong for me!  And girl likes her liquor.  I did use a "special" version of Kahlua though.  So I will try again with the regular kind soon.  But for now...wo nelly!

This was good but way too minty for my liking.  I think I'm going to play around w/ this drink, perhaps reduced the creme de menthe, to 1/4 of an ounce (for the minty flavour) and add in 3/4 ounce of creme de cacao.

I used everything but the mint leaf, as I didn't have one. It's really not pretty to look at but it's pretty tasty.

I used the clear 'creme de menthe'... didn't want the milky green appearance to scare anyone. (lol)

This was very strong! My second glass I opted for 2 oz. of Baileys. That helped even out the flavor. Overall a good drink...Definitely fitting for the 100 year anniversary of Girl Scouts!

Didn't like the coffee liquor or the vodka, yuck. The second time I made this I left out the vodka and used white creme de cacao liquor in place of the coffee liquor, much better.
