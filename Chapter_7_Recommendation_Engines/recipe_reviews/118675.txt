While cooking the chicken it made my whole house smell good, but the recipe for 8 peices... it doesn't make enough to shake on the chicken.  So I had to make extra after I put everything away.  But it was reallyyyy good.

This is so much better than Shake n' Bake, that's for sure.  I upped the amount of bread crumbs, using 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  I used 5 thighs.  I don't see how the breading would be enough for 8 thighs, so keep that in mind.  By using 1/3 cup of bread crumbs there would have been enough for 6 thighs most likely.  I also only used 1/2 tsp. of salt instead of 1 tsp.  I ran out of paprika so I used Emeril's Essence since that has paprika in it (it has other seasonings in it as well like garlic powder).  This was so full of flavor and hubby and I truly enjoyed it. I served this with mashed potatoes, using Yukon Golds, since it has that natural butter flavor to it, along w/ green beans. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Definitely 5 stars!  It was a little too salty the first time I made it, so I omitted the salt the second time, and it turned out great.  Delicious and very easy to make.

Wow....my husband said it was delicious.  He loves spicy food.  Ours was a little more on the spicy side because we were out of curry, so we used cayenne to kick it a little.  Much better than shake n bake!

My husband is not a fan of chicken thighs.  However, he enjoyed this recipe.  It was very quick, and used common ingredients.  The spices gave the chicken thighs all the flavor they needed.  My children enjoyed it too - much better than Shake N Bake!

I cut out the bread crumbs and just coat the chicken with spice.  It taste much better than making the chicken with the bread crumbs.  I think the crumbs take away the flavor of the spice.

Excellent recipe!  I love my food spicy and this dish hit the spot!  I had extra chili powder for good measure and wow, it was spicy!  It goes well with a side-dish of ranch potatoes and steamed veggies.

Wonderfully flavorful with a hint of heat. They're nicely crispy without the greasy skin.

**UPDATE: Have made these a few times since my 1st review and maintain they are AWESOME, 5 stars plus!!  If at all possible, they are even BETTER using Chipotle Chili Powder in place of reg chili powder - YUM!  Adds a great smoky spice that WE LOVE!  Will mention as well that I normally cut down the salt too!**  Fantastic flavour, hubby and I both really enjoyed!  Used boneless, skinless thighs and panko bread crumbs (so much better than regular ones!).  Baked as directed but did not turn over part way through cooking - fabulous and easy, a keeper for sure!  Served these with some stuffed bell peppers - unfortunately not from this site, one of my many cookbooks!

I have made this recipe several times now and everyone just loves it.  It comes out crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  I haven't had to chance anything on this recipe and I would recommend it highly to anyone.  Great flavour and one of my family's favourites.  Thank you for sharing.

Easy peasy lemon squeezy.  I changed it up a bit- OF COURSE- here's what I did.
Doubled the recipe, added into the mix a little flour, subtracted cumin and curry, added 3 kinds of paprika including piment d'esplete and smoked spanish, cayenne and chili powder, garlic powder and a bit of oregano.  I soaked the thighs in a bowl of milk for 30 minutes and then dropped them one by one into the mix and tossed them around a bit before putting them in a pan that I had brushed with olive oil.  I then used the brush to dab a little olive oil on top of the pieces- I need to get a mister!  I also cooked at a slightly higher temp for slightly shorter time which helped seal in the juices.
Rave reviews at the dinner table!!

Instead of using the suggested seasonings, I used gluten-free bread crumbs, g-free Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese. It was delicious!!! My husband asked me to add it to our lists of favorite meals! (he is a very picky eater).

This recipe is really good. I make it with whatever type of chicken I have on hand and it always turns out great. I do cut back on the salt by about half but use everything else just the same.

This recipe is great for people who like chicken thighs. I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs; less cook time with these but tasteful just the same. Had to cut down on the salt.

I made this recently and it turned out very well...the bread crumb coating was better than "Shake&Bake" much to my surprise!! I baked the thighs for an hour since they were large. The chicken was moist and juicy.  I will definetly make this again!

Really good! I've made them several times but never rated this recipe for some reason. I don't use curry, instead I use ground ginger and add some garlic & onion powder to the mixture. I also spray the tops with butter flavored cooking spray after I turn them. Wonderful!

Absolutely delicious. I make the recipe as is component wise and get rave reviews every time. Only thing I do different cooking wise is dab a bit of melted butter on the chicken before coating and I bake at 350 for 1 hour...no turning the chicken. Just finished eating it and makes me want to do pork chops in the coating also. So reminds me of when my Mom did Shake N Bake...only better. Much more flavorful. Fiance' is making happy noses so it's definitely a winner. Served tonight with Garlic Chicken Rice A Roni mixed with frozen mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrots, green beans).

Every time I make I get rave reviews. However I double the seasoning and bread crumbs at least. Great cold in a salad the next day for lunch as well.

Just had this for dinner, and it was DELIOUS. I followed the advice of the other reviews and used a 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs and only a 1/2 tsp of salt, and that coated 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs perfectly. I also only cooked it for 15 mins on each side. I did not have any curry so I used cayenne in its place for some added heat. At the last 8 mins of cooking time I drizzled honey over the chicken, for a touch of sweetness with the spicy. Will definitely make this again!

Excellent!! I'm so happy I found this recipe. I had a package of chicken thighs and no fresh ingredients in my refrigerator. This recipe was a life-saver. This was the easiest and fastest YUMMY dish I have ever thrown together. The prep is really only about 2 minutes. I love that it requires only spices and bread crumbs, but tasted more complex. I used only 4 thighs, but kept the rest of the measurements the same. I also melted a few teaspoons of Smart Balance Spread on the pan for about 3 minutes in the oven while it was heating up to give it an oven-fried taste. I tossed leftover linguini in the pan drippings and heated it in the microwave for a side dish. FAST, EASY and LITE! Perfect. We love it!!

I used chicken breast instead of thighs.
Family did not like this recipe at all.  I think it may have been the chili seasoning.  We usually enjoy new foods and different taste.  I will not be making this again.

Great spice mixture. I used panko breadcrumbs and added cayenne. Baked for 30 minutes and they were perfectly cooked. Love this one.

I made these with pounded out chicken breasts. Only cooked them about 8 minutes. The seasoning had a great flavor; I did cut back on the salt a lot and was very glad I did. The crumb coating was kind of dry and that's what was disappointing to me.  We had to dip in in BBQ sauce. I would make it again but maybe drizzle the top with a little melted butter before baking.

Saying "It's great" just isn't enough praise.  The aroma alone is outstanding.  But, the aroma takes second seat to the flavor!!  

Kara De la Vega, your recipe is beyond excellent! It's a recipe 'fit for the gods'.  THANK YOU for sharing it!

This recipe made inexpensive chicken thighs taste amazing.  I reduced the amount of chili powder a tad and I doubled the recipe to coat about 12 thighs.  I also dipped the thighs in egg whites to help the crumbs stick.  The spices stick to the thighs, but the crumbs didn't without dipping in egg first.  Great flavor!

This was really good.  Had 5 leg quarters to cook and no shake and bake.  used this recipe.  didn't really measure.  eyeballed it all into a ziploc bag.  Didn't add curry but threw in some onion and garlic powder, some ground sage, and added salt free seasoning in place of salt.  Was worried abount how the skinless chicken would turn out so did a light spray with olive oil cooking spray after the coated chicken was placed on the pan.  Didn't turn the chicken either.  It was yummy.

This chicken was really, really good. I also doubled the dry ingredients and used an egg wash first. I omitted the salt because I only add salt at the table, if then. The chicken was very tender and it tastes good cold too. I will definetly make again. Oh, I also added garlic powder and lemon pepper just because I like those things. Very easy and great tasting recipe. I'll use it often. Oh, I almost forgot...I used crushed up captain wafer crackers because I had no bread crumbs. I will use those in the future also, because I liked it how it was. Thank you.

Super-simple and delicious! I used panko bread crumbs and they stayed in place nicely. Another time I might try brushing the chicken with an egg-mustard wash just to keep it moist and boost the flavor even more. Either way, this was a great dish and my whole family enjoyed it.

The coating had a really nice and different flavor, and the house smelled wonderful while it was cooking! My only problem was there wasn't enough coating to cover all of the chicken pieces- next time I will probably double it. I dipped the chicken in some buttermilk that I had left over from another recipe before I coated it, and it turned out really well. I think this would be even better with chicken breasts- so I'll definitely be trying it again. Thanks for the recipe!

What a fantastic and flavorful coating! We found it to be a bit too salty, so next time I'll half the amount of salt and try it on pork chops. Thanks again!

Very nummy, indeed.  In order to coat the 8 boneless skinless thighs, I doubled the amount of bread crumbs but left the remaining amounts the same.  As well, I did use an egg wash first.  My hubby was very impressed with the flavor.

Excellent dish and easy to make!  I used whole chicken legs and left the skin on.  It looked like it needed something else I Added a can of stewed tomatoes the last 15 minutes of cooking.

Five stars for easy and surprisingly very good - I've shared this recipe with friends, and it's a regular go-to for all of us. I use half the salt, a bit more black pepper and - here's my secret - no breadcrumbs. You really don't need them. If my husband makes it, he uses Panko breadcrumbs, and that's good too, but I prefer it with just the spices. You can also leave out the chili powder if you have folks who don't like spicy. It's SO quick and easy, and you'll be surprised how good.

This is a delicious recipe rivaling traditional Shake and Bake. Very important to remove the skin from the thighs! To make this recipe gluten free, use corn flake crumbs (Kellogg's makes them), or you could crush up the corn flakes yourself. You could also purchase gluten-free bread crumbs, but they're kind of pricey and not as flavorful.

Yum!  Made this for dinner tonight with a package of about 14 boneless, skinless thighs from Costco.  I doubled everything except the salt, and added an extra 1/4 c. bread crumbs on top of that.  There was plenty of coating.  Easy clean-up since it's all mixed in the bag.  I cut back on the total cooking time by 5 minutes since they were boneless.  Delicious and moist.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I gave this recipe 5 stars simply because it saved me so much time and as a full-time  working mom, that is very important. It was good, though a little bland. My family is big on food being well seasoned. Next time I'll just amp up the seasoning measurements. Also before I made this I placed my skinless, boneless thighs in a buttermilk brine overnight. The meat was so tender and delicious. I'll make this again for sure.

OMG!  It's easy, it's better than Shake and Bake,  it's elegant and it looks like you slaved in the kitchen.  We we out after dinner and the house still smelled so wonderful.  I cannot wait to make this again, and again, and again!  Thank you!!!!

Quick and easy to plan with your favorite sides. I switched it up and used a pampered chef Buffalo Rub in place of the Chili powder, and substitued Hungarian Hot Paprika for regular Paprika. I also used Panko Bread crumbs. Crispy, Spicy and very satisfying!

Pretty good!!!!  Maybe my cooking time was off because I 'unfold' the thighs into a longer piece.  I 'm guessing the recipe left them all cute and tidy. lol!  I did add a few shakes of cayenne and used panko (a little more than called for to cover everything).  Quite good!  and Easy!!!  Thank you for posting!

This was great! Used a little more bread crumbs than called for and drizzled with honey on the last leg of the cooking process. I will try this coating with other cuts of meat and fish. thank you all recipes!

Made this for dinner tonight, I've really taken a liking to chicken thighs lately and this was another recipe I enjoyed.  The spices weren't perfect for my taste, but I can appreciate the mixture and I know my hubby would like it, so I'll have to make it again when he is home.  Thanks!

I made this for two reasons: (1) I had chicken thighs, and (2) I wanted something ridiculously easy because I had no time. Super easy, and the best part? Hubby LOVED it. He said it was juicy, flavorful, and almost like fried chicken. He said "It's a keeper" and asked me to make it again.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this recipe...reminded me of a much better, homemade version of shake and bake.  I lined my baking pan with aluminum foil to aid the cleanup process, worked beautifully.  One could easily play with the herbs and spices in this mixture to appease any taste.  Will certainly make again - thanks for sharing :)

Terrific recipe! I used it on 7 drumsticks and it came out perfect--crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. For larger drumsticks, I poked a hole in them and left them in longer. UPDATE: I experimented with coconut flakes instead of bread crumbs. YUM!

Excellent recipe, earns it's five stars. Next time I will cut back on the salt though. Followed advice to cut back on cook time for boneless skinless thighs (15 mins and 12 mins on other side, instead of 20 and 15), and they came out perfect. 

PROS: Quick, extra-tasty, pairs excellently with almost any garden-variety side  (we had it with rice). 

CONS: A touch too salty. I also do a salt rub on my raw meats (which acts like a dry brine and affords them both longer cooking time and juicier meat with no strong increase in salt taste...just a touch more flavor...look it up on Martha Stewart), so I definitely am either going to cut back on the salt content OR use more breadcrumbs (this recipe's "crust" is a touch thin, not a bad thing, but is a strong flavor and could definitely use a slight "watering down" to the tune of maybe a half cup of crumbs instead of a quarter cup).

Top notch recipe! Allrecipes delivers yet again. Enjoy.

I just made these for the second time and what a good way to prepare very inexpensive chicken thighs! I dont think I even liked dark meat until I made these and even the picky white meat people in the family had to admit these were good. I doubled the mix so I wouldnt run out and used 1/4 panko and 1/4 Cup regular bread crumbs because that is what I had. Doubled all spices for 8 skinless thighs. So good. Thank you for a tasty, simple recipe!!

Made recipe as described.  The curry just overpowered the rest of the spices.  If I make this again, I'll maybe drop the curry to about 1/4 that is called for.

These were good.  I upped the crumbs to 1/2 cup and left all spices the same.  I left some of the skin on, so maybe that's why it took mine almost an hour to bake.

This was ssssooooo good! I would say it was the best crumb-coated chicken recipe I have used by far! 

The recipe will definitely become a regular in my rotation of recipes for dinner.  Oh, and I didn't have any cumin(ran out) so that was the only seasoning that was omitted but, it still turned out very good.  It had the right amount of spice to it...I didn't change a thing with regards to the spice I didn't have anymore of.

GREAT use of chicken thighs.  I've been looking for a good recipe for thighs since they are so much tastier than white meat.

I ended up making *way* more bread crumb mixture than needed.  (I even added Panko bread crumbs thinking it would help provide a crusty coating - not necessary.) Really like the Indian flavors of curry and paprika.

The coating is very thin so perhaps just doubling the mixture would be sufficient.  (I don't think the way it is now would cover 8 pieces.)  I was concerned about having to coat the chicken pieces with some kind of egg or milk dip first, but completely not necessary.

I, too, had boneless and skinless thighs so I decreased the time.

I served it on top of spiced (cinnamon and clove) rice.  Excellent.  This is a keeper.

Chicken was very nicely flavored, with just a little kick.  I really wasn't sure about the spices, I thought it would be real spicy, but was not.  I did not have bread crumbs, so I used corn flake crumbs.  I loved the crunch it gave it.  I only used a little salt as the corn flake crumbs already has salt in them.  Definitely will make this again.  Quick and easy supper.

AMAZING! the only thing I did different was used pita bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs and I used a half cup, but that was for only 3 thighs and I barely had enough, just something to think about when doing your own portions. THANKS for a GREAT recipe!

Instead of baking it, I just went on ahead and fried it - good ole' local fried chicken... but the bread crumbs were new. Goes GREAAATTTT with Guam's favorite sauce Fina'Denne (soy sauce. chopped onions & lemon juice or powder). Need more spice? Put some hot peppers in the sauce :D

Our family really liked this recipe.  Other than using panko bread crumbs I made this as written.  The spices were so yummy, nicely balanced (not too hot but a nice spice with great flavor) and I like the crisp of the panko crumbs.  Going forward I'll use this breading on our chicken tenders too.  Lastly both my kids (2.5 y and 11 mo) ate up the chicken and loved it!

Was a quick throw together.  Used panko crumbs, BLSL thighs and the spices as called for.  I drizzled just a bit of olive oil on them before putting in the oven.  They came out very crispy and flavorful.  Nice spice combo.  Thanks Kara!

We did not like these.  I followed the recipe exactly and was really dissappointed.  The coating was overwhelming and the skin was not crisp. The chicken was moist, however.

This was delicious!  I used the Kikkoman (panko Japanese style) breadcrumbs which I think really made the recipe.  Also cooked them on parchment paper (for easy clean up) and did not turn them over half way through - this kept them really crispy.  Turned the broiler on for the last few minutes.  Cannot wait to make them again!

As the other reviews suggested, I omitted the salt (I'm not a big fan of salty food anyway) and doubled the coating mix.  It was the perfect amount of mix for eight chicken thighs.  My husband loved it, but next time, I'll only include one teaspoon of curry instead of two.  Great dinner, thanks!

Very easy and very good!  My husband and even my little kids loved it!  It is spicy (which we like) so if you don't care for the spice cut it back and increase the bread crumbs to a cup.

I was looking for a different chicken recipe and came across this one.  Believe me it was so quick and easy to make and was done in about 45 minutes.  I did change the amount of bread crumbs to 1 cup then altered the amount of dry ingredients as well.  I had plenty of coating for ten thighs.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks

My favorite recipe for chicken that I don't need to shop for.  I've been making this recipe almost weekly since I have found it.  It is perfect as is.  I use boneless skinless chicken thighs as that is what I prefer.  Great recipe!

I LOVED this recipe.  I'm a mom of two (second one being born 8 weeks ago)& like easy to make, but flavorful meals.  This was it !!!  Even my 4 1/2 year old liked it & she doesn't like anything (let alone with a bunch of spices).  The spices didn't make it spicy like I figured - just very tasty.  Definately a keeper.  (Only thing I changed was adding just a dash of salt instead of a teaspoon).  Thanks !

This recipe was pretty good overall, the next time I make it I will make sure to use either an egg wash BEFORE I coat it with the bread crumbs.  I also used a combination of Italian bread crumbs and Panko bread crumbs.

This is full of flavor. Since previous reviews mentioned not having enough crumbs, I used 1/2 cup of plain bread crumbs. I was sure to dry each boneless thigh with a paper towel before adding them to the crumbs. Since they were boneless I cooked them only 30 minutes without turning halfway. They were fabulous, tender and tasty.

Great flavor without being too spicy. Even my 4- year-old liked it. I did double the dry mixture and came out just right for 8 boneless thighs. I also reduced the cook time to 10 min on each side. We will make again!

I swapped the curry powder for garlic powder (I am not a curry fan) and reduced the chili powder to 1/2 tsp.  Although we all love spicy, a whole tsp was a little too much for us. This chicken rocked!  My family loves it!

These were so good!! The only change I made was using fresh breadcrumbs that I made from wheat bread. The rest of the recipe I followed exact and it was enough to cover 6 thighs. Will definately be making this again.

I would have never thought to put these spices together but really they are great together and the "shake and bake" technique could not be simpler.  I did reduce the chili powder and use (milder) white pepper somewhat for my kids, but the flavor was outstanding.  

I doubled the recipe and did 7 or 8 boneless, skinless thighs with it with some mixture left over.  They have much more surface area once they are boned and skinned, but even with the bones and skin it would depend on the size of the thighs how many you can do.

This is on the menu plan for next week already!

Excellent.
There are 6 of us so I changed the recipe a little. I used 8 chicken thighs, 1/2 cup of Italian style bread crumbs, 1/4 cup of Grated Parmesan Cheese, omitted the salt, 2 t paprika, omitted the pepper because there's enough chili powder and curry powder to make it spicy, 1 t celery seed and 2 t Italian seasoning. Served over steamed veggies and rice. Husband and Kids loved the recipe! I will be making this a monthly menu. Thank you!

This is a very good recipe!  As others suggested I increase crumb mix.  I doubled it and it was enough for 7pc of large thighs.  I also rubbed a very light coating of light mayo on the thighs first to help with crumbs sticking.  I left out chilli and paprika for my 2yr old son but it still tasted great!   I'm sure the extra kick from the chilli and paprika powder will be even better..

used blsl thighs and followed suggestions of doubling crumb mixture, glad I did, would not have been enough to cover 8. only change I made was to leave out curry. was delish. whole family enjoyed it, even my 3 yr old and 5 yr old had seconds. served with sweet potato apple casserole to off set spice. will be making again.

Very quick, easy main dish and a delightful change from the norm.  Subtle curry flavor is excellent with the slightly stronger taste of the dark meat chicken ...Moist, tender and delicious!  Was definitely a hit served will fresh tomatoe and mozzerrela salad, mashed potatoes and pan gravy.  Yum!

Excellent and easy way to spice up your chicken - it came out nice and crusty and completely cooked inside. I had only 6 chicken thighs, thus have some coating mixture left - intend to save in in the fridge in a ziplock for a week or so.

This was just okay.  I followed the recipe exact, except that I marinated the chicken in buttermilk for about 4 hours before coating and cooking.  I just didn't like the blend of spices--a little too much for my taste.  My family seemed to like it, although the leftovers are being tossed today so they must not have liked it too much.

My husband and I both liked this recipe.  We both like spicy food but he said he would put less chili powder next time.  I liked it, but my baby wouldn't be able to eat it with the spice level it was at.  Either way, spicy or less spicy, we liked the flavour and will make it again.

This recipe was very good, although I am happy I read the reviews beforehand.  I had to double the recipe to make enough breading for the thighs.  (I had 12 thighs)  I only cooked them for 30 min, 15 min on each side.  I think 40 min would have been too long.  But the flavour was great!  Accompanied this recipe with Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake, also off allrecipes, and supper was a hit! Good stuff!!

Love this. It deserves a better name! I used bonelss and skinless thighs and cut the cooking time to 15 minutes per side. I also added a drizzle of honey during the last 5 minutes of cooking, as another reviewer suggested. Good idea!

I thought this was fabulous - quick to prepare, easy and it tasted so good for so little work. :)  I used four boneless thighs, cut the seasonings in half and it was perfect.  I did add a bit of garlic powder, but otherwise I did everything as noted.  I steamed some broccoli and some curry rice for the sides.  My husband and I loved this - definitely going to be added to the rotation. :)  Thanks!

Oh my goodness, this breading tasted so yummy! I LOVE the flavor! I was a bit skeptical of the mix of spices being used but it was all ingredients I had on hand so I gave it a shot anyway. Sooo good. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars was because the recipe as stated does not make enough coating for 8 thighs. I ended up having to mix up some more breading because I ran out before I could coat all the pieces. Definitely double up the ingredients for the breading before you start!

I had bought some cheap cheap cheap chicken thighs at the store. Tried this recipe cuz i didnt have time to marinate. As the thighs were boneless, I baked 15 minutes a side. I didnt have curry powder, but used garam masala instead. The mix wasnt enough for 8 thighs - really only 2, so I had to triple the ingredients for 6 thighs. Loved it. Super easy. Boyfriend is kinda anti-chicken but couldnt believe how good they were. Will definitely make it again.

Amazing!  Normally when I get asked what's for supper and reply "chicken thighs" there is usually the sounds of disgust from my kids and my husband usually replies "I'll eat them if I must".  No one really enjoys them anyway I cook them...until now.  These got a unanimous thumbs up and it was agreed I could make these again any time.  I did double the ingredients (except for the salt which I left at 1tsp) for 8 thighs.  I did find it still too salty so I'll cut the salt back even more next time.  Excellent, excellent recipe.

Tasty crumb coating.   Instead of adding the salt to the mix, I sprinkled the thighs with it before baking.  I used boneless skinless thighs and they were done in a good half hour.

I enjoyed this recipe but my boyfriend only had one piece and said it was too salty for him.  I would leave out the salt all together next time.  I had planned on doing when I first came across the recipe and read some reviews.  But then I forgot when it came time to dump all the seasonings in my ziplock and it was too late.  I tried reconciling by adding more bread crumbs and the other spices but I guess the damage was done.  Just goes to show if you're going to follow reviews you should do so before you go shopping and then again before you start cooking.

Delicious! I got compliments on this.
The mixture is a tad salty, though -- next time I'll cut it down to 3/4 to see if that does the trick.
I didn't use any paprika, so I didn't use it.
I also didn't have bread crumbs, so I used 
crushed unsalted saltine crackers.
Overall, great! Everything came out juicy and delicious!

Delicious and easy! Used thigh fillets that I got on sale, so this was super-cheap, and turned out juicy and very yummy. Husband ate twice what he normally does, and even my picky six year old twins were willing to eat it. Will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

This was easy and good.  A bit too much curry for my taste.

My family loves chicken but I am pretty sure that this is now my absolute favorite.  I used panko instead of bread crumbs.  I also tasted the mixture before putting in the salt and chicken.  I cut the salt back by 1/2 and ended up adding a few tablespoons of extra panko.  I LOVED the taste before the extra panko was added, but one of my toddlers would not have been able to tolerate that much spice.

Easy and delicious!   I removed the skin for a lower fat, healthier version.  I also forgot to add the salt and the thighs were tender, juicy and scrumptious without it!   This will be a repeat recipe for me!

Yum! Kept the skin on for his chicken, took it off for mine. Added whatever herbs and seasonings I felt like adding. Used 4 chicken thighs and cooked for the time stated. He REALLY liked it.

Very quick and easy dinner - didn't have chili powder so used red pepper seasoning instead but only 1/8 teaspoon. Very good!

This recipes is fabulous as is!  A family favorite in our house that pleases even my picky 9 year old.  In fact, I'm making it tonight but with chicken breasts instead.  Next time, I'm thinking of trying it without the bread crumbs, and using it as a dry rub on grilled chicken.  At any rate, you can't go wrong with this recipe.
Update...tried it on the chicken breasts, while it was good, the flavor was a bit strong.  Thighs seem to stand up better to the spices in the coating.  Did also try it as a rub on grilled thighs, less the bread crumbs and it was great!! Tossed the thighs in olive oil before applying the rub. My family loved it.

This is my new homemade shakenbake recipe - no more store bought! However I did make a few changes. 1/4 cup bread crumbs just wasn't enough, esp w/ all the spices. So I used 1 cup bread crumbs and kept all the spices the same, except added 1 tsp garlic powder. I removed the skin, coated them in flour, dipped them in milk, then shook them in a bag w/the crumb seasoning. 35 minutes in the oven is perfect and they were sooo good.

This is amazing!  I used the Japanese Panko bread crumbs and it was fantastic.  So crispy and the chicken was so juicy.  I may never use store bought coating mix again!

These were a big hit at my house. My husband thought they tasted a little like Indian food (from the curry), and my daughter like the crispy skin. We tried them with quinoa on the side, which didn't go over well..but that's another story. We will definitely make the chicken again!

Made this last night although I used skinless drumsticks.  Very easy and very good, although I would not really call this "spicey" (there's no heat to it) but the spices are flavorful.

This recipe was perfect as is and also lends itself well to slight modification.  Made it a second time with less curry and a bit of cayenne pepper.  Gave it a little heat but still had the same basic flavor.  To me, the mark of a great recipe is that is has ingredients that most of us already have on hand.  This was really terrific!  Gotta say though, reading some of the other reviews is interesting:  If you fry instead of bake and use different spices, then ... um, you're not making THIS recipe. You're making something else; why not post your own version?

Great super easy recipe! I had tried a bunch of breaded chicken recipes and this is my favorite so far. I like that you don't need to coat the chicken in egg or flour- you simply cover it with crumbs and spices! Our chicken thighs tasted really good.

Delicious, easy to make, and fast. My husband and kids thought it was the best chicken I'd ever made, and there was talk at the dinner table of me being the best cook they had ever met. Haha. Guess I'll be making this again soon...

Tried it last night and loved it. Easy to make and disappeared just as quick as it was to make it. Will make again. I threw some grape tomatoes along side of it in the oven and they blended quite well. Also, served it with some mango chutney. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband  thought this was  the best chicken he's ever had. I only had 5 chicken thighs. I made fresh bread crumbs from a loaf of Italian bread. On the advise of other reviewers, I upped the amount of crumbs to about half a cup. Baked for 45 minutes and did not turn the chicken over half way through. Great recipe. I will make this again for sure. Edit: I baked these again but this time placed them on a rack on the cookie sheet to drain all the fat and didn't turn them over during baking. Excellent.

I thought these were terrific. Easy and Tasty. I scrolled through to find something new to do with a package of boneless chicken thighs and found this recipe. Since they were boneless, I cut the cooking time down a bit and they turned out very delicious. I've made these twice now and both times were great!

This was a very tasty chicken coating. I did not have regular bread crumbs, so I used Panko instead. I took other reviewers suggestions and used 1/3 C. of bread crumbs and added the seasoning as directed. I did not turn them over ( I wasn't paying attention) and they were still delicious & moist. I served it with mashed potatoes and a salad. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was just okay, though the chicken was very moist.  I left the salt out and we did not miss it; also doubled the bread crumbs. My husband said he liked it, but I don't think he would be heartbroken if I don't make it again.

I was looking for something easy to do with bone-in thighs and this was it. I was very pleased with the way these came out. I will definitely make again, possibly adjusting the spice mix a little for variety. Hubby said this tasted like tandoori chicken from an Indian restaurant.

Been looking & trying to copy the "Shake & Bake" coating recipe for years. This is even better!(and cheaper)Used 1/2 Panko crumbs as I had some to use up and it was excellent. (May try all Panko next time)

QED--quick, easy and delicious!  Only made two boneless thighs, so cook time was 10 minutes with no turnover of thighs.  Breading drew raves.  Keeping in my recipe box for sure.

Sorry. I wish I could say I loved it....but,we just finished dinner and my husband (who loves spice) and I were not impressed. I have to say, the chicken was MOIST, but the taste was overwhelming. I noticed that many reviews said it was too salty and that many of you had omitted the salt. I love salt, but took to heart the reviews and cut the salt in half. (I had to 4X my recipie as I was doing lots of thighs)and it was still way too salty. I also used chipolte chili powder and cut that to half as it is STRONG. Still way too salty and over powering. I may try a "toned down" rendition, with a lot less strong flavours, but I won't be in a hurry.

This was a great way to make chicken more interesting!  I might add more heat to it, but otherwise, wonderful flavor!

I made this receipe last evening and was impressed with the blend of flavor.   However following the receipe there was not enough coating for the chicken.  I will make this again but maybe add more bread crumps and uping the spices to accomadate so that I can coat the whole chicken.  I was also thinking of dipping the chicken in egg or dressing so the coating will go on evenly.  I will also try it with chicken wings or breast.

Soooooo good!  Made a few substitutions...boneless/skinless thighs and panko (Japanese breadcumbs) for the regular breadcrumbs.  The panko stays crunchy unlike the regular breadcrumbs which can get soggy.  Will make again for sure!!

This recipe was fab! My husband loved it and it was tender and juicy but crisp and golden on the outside.  I might cut down a bit on the chili powder, but other than that, its perfect as is.

This is okay, but I added an extra 1/4C of corn meal, and only had just enough for 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I found the recipe to be salty, as well.

I will make a few changes the next time.  I'll add some garlic and onion powder, replace the salt with celery salt, or just cut back on the salt itself, and I'll replace the paprika with smoked paprika (personal taste thing).  I'll probably also omit the curry powder and just use some tumeric.

(**See additional note at the bottom) This is FANTASTIC.  We just made this tonight but we doubled the dry ingredient recipe for good measure.  My 21-year old son who puts KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce on EVERYTHING, did NOT use it for this chicken.  We nearly fell over in our dining chairs.  The daughter doesn't normally eat "thigh meat" but devoured this chicken.  What's  interesting is the bread crumb part of the "shake" did not stick to the chicken, but all the spices did.  No matter though, because whatever stuck was FANTASTIC. Even without the skins, the chicken turned out very moist and flavorful and the spice and minimal bread that coated it formed a sort of light crust on the chicken.  Our chicken thighs must have been from young chickens and weren't very big, so those of us who would have only eaten one thigh, ended up having two.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  Thanks Kara de la Vega!  **I used the same crumb coating and did this with bone-in pork chops last night.  GREAT flavor for the pork chops!  I rinsed and dried 6 chops, put them one at a time in the bag to shake the coating on them, put them in a 9x13 baking stone, baked *covered* at 375 for 35 minutes, removed the cover and flipped the chops over and baked for another 15-20 minutes uncovered.  Wonderful!

I really like chicken thighs -- but my husband doesn't (too fatty). So, I thought this recipe would be a good compromise to try. I followed the recipe as written, except for putting tin foil on the botom of the baking pan for an easier clean up. 
I was very pleased with this recipe -- great flavor, fast to make, and with the skin off -- much more lean. We both recommend this recipe -- and  will definitely use it again.

This was excellent, and I liked it even better cold.  I did increase the amount of bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and kept all other measures the same.  It worked well.

Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was great.  I started with Italian Breadcrumbs b.c. that's what I had and added the ingredients you suggested.  I just thought it needed more salt....my husband likes way more than he should...hence 4 stars.  EASIEST breadcrumb recipe for chicken I've found!

nice I increased the amount of bread crumbs or else you run short on the coating,  also I coat in advance for spices to penetrate before cooking, just use a plastic bag for coating and leave in fridge for a few hours

I followed the recipe exactly.  The spices I used were fresh, but there was not any 'spice" as far as I am concerned.  I think IF I make this again, which I sincerely doubt, I will add some garlic and onion powders to the mix.  This was one meal that the better half suggested that I delete the recipe.

For me, the cumin and curry flavors are too much and they dominate even after adding the other spices. I usually don't favor recipes where one ingredient is over-flavoring the others, and the meat.

This was a great, quick way to cook chicken thighs.  Way better than Shake N Bake.  I did not have curry powder on hand.  Instead, I added a little of Summer Savory.  I also used Panko bread crumbs.  I used boneless, skinless thighs and total cook time was about 45 min.  (turning half way through)  Everyone enjoyed.

Very good--I used panko bread crumbs (1 1/2 cups) and an additional 1/2 tsp of all the spices. Quick and easy and the kids ate it up!

My husband loved this recipe! I had about 8 hind quaters of chicken so I used 1cup of bread crumbs and used 2tsp. of each spice & 1 1/2tsp. kosher salt, I added some garlic power also, it's a must at our house. I soaked the chx in buttermilk over night and then shook it in the crumbs and baked as directed. WOW!! What a terrific coating, I used Red Curry which added a nice spice to the chili poweder.

Since I used boneless chicken thighs, I reduced the cooking time by 7 minutes. I changed the seasoning mix to onion powder, garlic powder, dried parsley, dried thyme, paprika, and salt and pepper. It was a little salty but I forgot there's salt in the bread crumbs. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Giving 5 stars because my 3 & 5 year olds are in love with it!  Normally they won't eat any chicken but ground.  I cut 3 large boneless breasts into tenders and doubled the recipe - kept all proportions the same.  Next time I will probably cut the cumin some and add more chili and curry.  I didn't find it spicy at all so maybe a little red pepper in there too.

When I read the recipe and saw all the spices I was a bit leary.  I love skinless boneless thighs and am always looking for different recipes to try with them.  I immediately doubled the bread crumbs.  The spice content was perfect for my husband and I however, the next time I make this, I will eliminate the curry.  We are not fond of the curry flavor. Even with the 1/2C of bread crumbs, it was still over powering for us.

This is the best way to do chicken thighs -- I've even done this recipe with skin-on and boned and used panko crumbs, dizzle with olive oil and then baked,  my family thought it was AWESOME.

I didn't have regular bread crumbs, so I used rice bread crumbs instead.  The chicken was nice and crispy and I really liked the blend of spices.  I'd probably reduce the salt by 1/2 next time.  Delicious!

This recipe I found as an alternative to the shake-n-bake box seasoning. The combination of savory spices in this recipe make this chicken melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I keep extra bags of seasoning on hand just in case.

I thought it was very tasty and surprisingly enough crunch to satisfy my fried chicken cravings.  My teenage son liked it too.  I took the advice of needing to make it 1 C of bread crumbs but since I only had 1/4, the next best thing I had on hand was Flax Plus cereal.  So I added 3/4 C cereal.  I also added the 1 tsp of garlic powder but just realized I forgot the curry.  I will try this again.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have paprika so I substituted a pork seasoning in its place and it was good!  I loved the taste of the curry powder in this dish.  Since I used boneless skinless thighs, I also decreased the cooking time.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Keep 'em coming!

Wonderful recipe. My wife loved it, I used a base of Italian Bread Crumb and put Chipotle Spice, instead of cumin. Turned out wonderful!   Will make again.

Fabulous!  My husband said I was becoming a great cook...he loved them.  Only thing I did different was to make my own bread crumbs in mini food processor because I didn't have any.  Otherwise, made exactly like recipe.  I also used boneless chicken thighs but the cooking time i kept the same.  Surprisingly moist.

A great, very flavorful, quick recipe!  It was a little more spicy than I prefer.  I would make this again maybe cutting back slightly on the chili powder and cumin.  Perfect for a busy weekday meal!

My husband told me to put this one on the "short list"!  I used chicken legs as well as thighs, so I doubled the ingredients as well as adding chipolte chili powder instead of regular chili powder.

We are big fans of chicken thighs on the grill, this was a great addition to our recipes.  I mixed 1/2/ crushed Wasa crackers and 1/2 crushed Ritz crackers for the breading and did like other reviewers and increased to 1 full cup.  Put everything in the bag and refrig all day. Pulled them out and put on the gril for 5  min each side and slow grill for another 20 min, they were GREAT!

Tried this because of the reviews.  Such a simple and great tasting meal.  So much better than from a box, and no more time.  I will be adding this to the regular rotation.

This was a winner at my home..I served 9 people 7 of which were children and everyone liked it.  I made a spicy version I called Mens chicken then I made a milder version called Girls chicken. The curry I have is very spicy...so instead of my spicy curry for the girls I used Tumeric and left out the chilli powder.  It was very easy to prepare.  I will make it again; it pleased even the pickiest eaters in my family...praise the Lord for this recipe!!!!

Matt does not like the spices  Fantastic. I was afraid they would be too spicy or not crunchy, but the chicken was perfect and this was super easy to make. YUM! I left the skins on and doubled the coating.

I was surprised how amazingly good this simple recipe was.  The meat was so tender and juicy!  I adjusted the spices based on what I had at home (no curry powder), but it still came out tasting great.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

I followed the advice of others & increased the  quantity of the coating to accomodate more chicken thighs.  The flavour is incredible & YES, better than the store bought chicken shaker.  This will be a staple chicken coating in our house.

These were really good and much better than a shake 'n bake! I was out of bread crumbs unfortunately but saw that another reviewer omitted them so I gave it a try without the crumbs on the boneless, skinless thighs I had thawed out. I will make this again and quite possibly without the same way since we really enjoyed them. I skipped the salt.

Hubby made these last night with boneless/skinless chicken thighs - he doubled the ingredients to coat 6 pcs of chicken. VERY GOOD, and juicy - even my picky teenager who is "sick" of chicken really liked them!  THANKS!

I thought this was "just OK" it needed something - A good Base recipe - I will play with the recipe and see if I can kick it up a bit. The meat did turn out super juicy..I just wanted more from the spices.

This is so easy and so tasty all at the same time.  I've made it several times now and it's always a hit.  Typically served with a rice dish and a green veggie.

Fabulous flavor! I dipped the chicken pieces in beaten egg after the first coating because I thought it was a bit wimpy. Double coating of flavor and extra crispy was scrumptious! I also used a broiler pan because I've had trouble baking chicken with a flat pan.

This recipe has awesome flavor and aroma. I was out of bread crumbs so I used cornmeal and fried it in the electric frying pan cause I didn't want to heat up the oven on a hot summer day. I can't wait to try it again. The coating covered 5 thighs perfectly.

Tasted like fried chicken, so hubby and daughter loved it. As for me, I thought it was OK, but I'm not a big fried chicken fan. I will probably make this again for the hubs though. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is wonderful I cooked the chicken on foil lined cookie sheet sprayed with non-stick spray. I did not feel the need to turn them over. I did substitute the curry with hot curry spice.  I served this with Basmati rice seasoned with tandoori spice and raisins. My husband and I loved it. I am going to  premix the spices to have on hand whenever I want to spice things up. To Kara who submitted it, Thank You!

Delicious flavor, and fast and easy! My husband raved about the taste. I used half Italion and half Panko breakcrumbs, and no salt. I used my new discovery, smoked paprika, which has a wonderful smell, and I also used Chipolte Pepper Flakes in place of the chili powder.  I served this with Curried Rice Pilaf (with a can of peas added) from the site and it was a hit. I think this is a company meal and it will become a regular for us! Thanks.

I just made these tonight and they are delicious! I used panko bread crumbs because I ran out of regular bread crumbs. I used olive oil instead of a non-stick cooking spray. The chicken pieces were SO moist and tender and best of all CRISPY on the outside! My hubby raved about it (he's a chicken thigh kind of guy:-D)and kept saying "oh my goodness, this is so good!" I think this easy recipe is definitely a keeper!

I too had to increase the amount of bread crumbs, I probably should have increased some of the spices to but I was afraid to. My husband wants me to add some cayenne pepper next time so I guess that's next. All in all it was very good and we had no leftovers.

The coating sticks beautifully to the boneless thighs. There is enough fat/liquid in the meat so that when it cooks out it causes the breading to not be too dry, but just right. I had (really) good cumin & used the whole tsp. It was too strong. Great idea & concept. i think i will keep the concept & tweak the spices next time and go for more of a cajun taste and less of a middle eastern/indian taste. Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe, but the serving size is off. If you need to coat eight thighs like it says, double your recipe.

We loved this recipe, but I will try dredging the chicken in flour and egg first next time.  I cut the salt in half and didn't miss it.  Also, I used boneless chicken breasts and cut the baking time by 5 minutes.  Delish!

This is the first recipe I have reviewed - this has become a family favorite.  We make this twice a month - the spice is perfect - even my daughter who doesn't like spicy loves it.  My kids call it our KFC chicken.

Very easy & simple recipe for a good dinner.  You could use the crumb coating for chicken breasts, wings or drumsticks as well.  I actually added some garlic salt and misc. spices to the breadcrumbs to give it that extra kick!

Absolutely delicious - I only had Italian bread crumbs, which included Romano cheese, on hand - this worked well with the recipe.  I tripled the recipe for 15 thighs, and sprinkled leftover crumb mixture on top of thighs.  During last 10 minutes of baking I basted the top w/ butter.  Thank you for the recipe - this is a keeper.

I made this tonight for my husband and HE LOVED IT!!! The spice mixture is wonderful together. The only change I made is I did not have any bread crumbs so I used 1/2 a package of saltines and 1/2 package of Ritz......WONDERFUL! Gave it a great flavor. I will definally make this again. This is simple, yet is nice enough to serve to a party!

This recipe made for a very good dinner.  I changed the seasonings to make it more palatable for my kids, mixing parmesan cheese, paprika, garlic powder, basil, and oregano with the breadcrumbs.  I've never cooked chicken without the skin because my husband loves the skin, but with this recipe he didn't even notice.  When I told him there was no skin, he was really suprised.  Easy to prep, easy to cook, and easy to adjust the seasonings to taste.  I'll definitely use this cooking method for chicken again.  Thanks!

This was very good!  However, I made the following changes:

I used about triple the bread crumbs (and, actually, I used matzo meal since that's what I had on hand).

I used about half the cumin (personal taste) and about half the paprika (I have smokey paprika, not the red colored blah that is so often packaged as paprika).

I cooked it for about 45 minutes and I left the skin on.  This was terrific!

Great recipe to use with the ingredients you have on hand. In my case, I didn't have prepared bread crumbs, so I made my own by toasting four slices of wheat toast then crumbling them once they'd cooled off. The recipe has a lot of room to experiment. I added some curry, a dash of garlic salt and some thyme..yum! The cooking time was a bit longer than stated, it took at least 60 minutes of baking time for the thighs to be ready. Chicken came out perfect, juicy, tender and full of flavor. I highly, highly recommend this.

This is definately better than Shake n Bake. You control the amount of salt and ingrediants. I did double the recipe since the amount in the recipe was not enough. I think next time I'm going to use italian bread crumbs. But good recipe anyway.

I needed a chicken thigh recipe that I already had the ingredients for on hand- found the perfect one with "Crumb-Coated Chicken Thighs!"  I doubled the coating recipe, as many suggested the coating wasn't enough.  I omitted the salt, since some suggested it was too salty, and I used some garlic powder instead.  I used 10 thighs, totaling 4.5 pounds, making each thigh over 6oz, a little bigger than the recipe called for.  There was more than enough coating. I took the advice of one cook and used aluminum foil in the pan to help with clean-up, great advice!  It was great!  Not too bready, not too spicy, but plenty flavorful, yum!  Will be happy to make again!

This recipe is amazing! My brother came over after I made this and was "too full to eat" until he had a bite of this chicken! Now it's a favorite recipe of ours. I also had to make more to coat all of the chicken. I don't eat wheat so I used gluten-free breadcrumbs and it came out fantastic.

I didn't have any curry because I was at a friends house, so I omitted that, but plan on trying it next time.  Everyone loved the  chicken, and I've actually used this recipe, a little bit altered, to bread pork chops (which I had never made before), and they also were well received!

This breading was really good and simple.I only made 5 thighs and I agree, definitely would need more breading for 8 thighs. The leftovers I diced up and put in 'leftover chicken ala king' also from this site and it was FABULOUS!! Nice and spicy and gave that recipe the kick it needed to go from good to great!

I made these exactly as the recipe states and they were wonderful. Only took a couple of minutes to put together and into the oven. My boyfriend, who normally ONLY eats the breast, had two pieces and said that I should make these again. The combination of spices was right on target, not too spicy but a little kick. Next time I may try cayanne instead of chili powder for an extra punch. Thanks for a quick and very tasty recipe.

A bit too spicy for us but still good. Will make again. Best recipe for chicken thighs I have tried.

Ok.  Not very spicy, but the chicken stayed juicy.
