I make this dish with hard dry cured Spanish chorizo. It is very different from Mexican chorizo and is great for this recipe.  I cut the chorizo with scissors and fry it until the oils run then I add the other ingredients except for the garlic.  The chorizo has enough spice for us.

I omitted the potatoes and onions and used 4 cups of baby carrots and 2 bunches of asparagus.  Also used smoked turkey sausage to make it healthier as well.  Family loved this.  Thank you.

This was really good. I swapped orange and yellow bell peppers for onion.  I also used turkey sausage instead of chorizo.

So easy and flavorful! I use Portuguese Linguicia instead of chorizo and it tastes amazing. Iâ€™ve been making this almost weekly and now I make extra to have leftovers.
