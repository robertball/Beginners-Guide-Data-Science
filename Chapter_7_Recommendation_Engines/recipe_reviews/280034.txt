A really good Southern Egg Salad.  Egg salad has a myriad of additions, but most come down to a good tangy taste with the incredible edible egg.   My husband said he liked mine best (I'm his second wife) because I put minced red onion in it.  Truth is, I never put red onion in Egg Salad until he said that while I was making my first batch for him,  and I immediately added it!  Our "secret ingredient" is Old Bay Seasoning.  It provides some salt and heat and then you go from there with additional salt and heat.  Thanks for the post!

This is the Best.  I'm not a big fan of Hot sauce so I skipped that part.  I did add 1/3 Cup of chopped Green Olives patted dry, And they just set it off... Boom!!!

Fantastic! We use rye bread and a little lettuce, cut into quarters and piled high on a platter for snack or appetizer. I don't care for sweet stuff, but my son-in-law introduced me to dill pickle relish. I never knew....

I mix the condiments and seasonings together in a separate bowl, then gently stir into the eggs, which I chop rather than grate.  This gives the egg salad a more consistent flavor.  I also use slightly less mayonnaise and strain the relish to prevent a runny consistency.  You can always add mayonnaise to the bread.  Also, if you like egg & cheese flavor combo, chop some Jarlsberg into the eggs before you stir in the condiments.

This sounds delicious! Can’t wait to try it! And to the person who said this wasn’t southern, I’ve lived in the south for my entire 47 years & have never seen nor heard of egg salad with grapes & pecans in it! Chicken salad, yes, egg salad, most definitely not!

I live in Memphis and this is pretty much southern egg salad.  The only difference is here they add sliced green olives.

Very good egg salad! I did what I usually do and coarsely chopped the eggs, not grate them, and added some chopped celery. I used Siracha and increased the amount. It still wasn't overly spicy, just had a subtle zing. I had this on a whole wheat wrap for lunch and enjoyed it. Walter, thanks for this different take on egg salad!

5.9.20  Love egg salad and particularly liked the sweet-spicy contrast of the relish and hot sauce in this recipe.  I did add a bit more hot sauce (used sriracha) just to suit my personal taste.  Nice lunch today, thanks for the new recipe.

Easy to make even for senior citizen. Taste good. Substitute Indian relish for hot dog relish. Still good. No sugar.

I am a Georgia girl, born and raised here, and have lived here for 69 years, so I guess I may qualify as southern. My egg salad recipe is the same one my mother used and is pretty much like this recipe using sweet pickle relish, mayo, celery seed, and salt and pepper.I don't use mustard because I don't like mustard and I do not use hot sauce because that sounds kind of Texan to me. However,  I would say that egg salad is one of those foods that people can dress up any way they want to flavor it up.  As much as I believe that, I have never heard of adding grapes or pecans to egg salad from anywhere! Maybe it's good, I dunno. Southerners DO add grapes and pecans to chicken salad sometimes, though.

Love the taste.  I didn’t have relish so I chopped up half a dill pickle and added about a Tblsp of the juice.  I can hardly wait to try it using relish.

I think this is very tasty, especially when you're in a hurry to fix lunch or a light dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I usually don't have yellow mustard, I prefer honey mustard.  I'll use that next time.

Very good! I made it mostly per recipe but didn’t have Tabasco, had to use smoked chipotle Tabasco.  Also, at the end added a few minutely diced yellow onion for some crunch . I served this on rye with smoked salmon and capers, open sandwich.  Husband commented that is was like something you’d get at a 5 star hotel.

The taste was different, but, that is why I tried the recipe. I definitely won't grate it again. After mixing everything up, it was more like paste. I will try it again, but, chop the eggs next time.

I love good egg salad.  I use my homemade sweet pickle relish, Works great.  I also think they missed an ingredient when I see a recipe like this.  Where is the minced or diced onion.  A must.  Also I prefer using Miracle Whip in place of Mayonnaise.  How ever it's done, Egg Salad Sandwich's are the best.

Using white pepper and Dill, I lean toward the astringent taste.  I love to time out the egg- cooking explained here! After the first trial and error, it gets easy.

I made this as written, with a bit of minced sweet onion  added. Delicious and much like my Kentucky and Carolina families make it. India relish is easily googled for those who don't recognize it. 
Any sweet relish can be subbed for it, including hotdog  relish or chow chow. Please don't berate the poster for for having a different food culture or wider knowledge of foodstuff than you happen to have. Look it up online and you may be pleasantly rewarded.
