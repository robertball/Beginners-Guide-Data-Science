I made this and followed the recipe exactly except I only used 5 jalapeno peppers instead of the 10. It was terrific I loved it! very tasty and the honey mustard added to the flavor.  My wife liked them but does not like spicey like I do and asked me not to use so much jalalapeno next time. So overall great recipe but a little caution regarding the Jalapeno and crushed red pepper.

I'm about to make this - overall recipe looks good - but I need clarification about something confusing:  'canned hominy' (?)
I understand 'hominy' to be cooked corn grits:  something I have never purchased, simply made from regular (not 'quick') Quaker dry grits.
Is this the same thing, and can it be substituted in your recipe?
A quick answer would REALLY be appreciated - wanted to try this soon!  Thanks

There was something just not right with the texture. I didn't include the jalapeno pepper or chili flakes.
