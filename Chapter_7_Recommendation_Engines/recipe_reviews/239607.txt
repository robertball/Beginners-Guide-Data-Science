Made half a recipe, and since I wanted big muffins, ended up with eight.  Not sure why the recipe author has both ground nutmeg and freshly-grated nutmeg (?), but I used all freshly-grated.  The other thing that puzzled me was putting fresh ginger root in a garlic press (and I have a good one) because that simply didn't work.  I ended up finely grating the ginger.  This does have a lot of ingredients, but the end result is good.  The taste mimics pumpkin bread, they're moist, not overly sweet, and I like that pop of tartness from the cranberries.  Nice recipe BITWITCH.

Didn't have fresh cranberries so I soaked dried ones in hot water. Also used 1 tsp. ground ginger instead of fresh, and 1 1/4 tsp. fresh ground nutmeg. 1 cup w/w flour, 2 cups white. Turned out very nice.  Will make again ??

I really liked this recipe!  It's nice to be able to use up a substantial amount of squash in one recipe, and the coconut oil, squash, spices, and cranberry go very well together.  I didn't have fresh nutmeg or safflower oil, so skipped the grated nutmeg and used applesauce instead of the safflower oil.  I halved the sugar and then sprinkled a bit more brown sugar over the top, which caramelized nicely.  Also, while mixing, I poured a bit of boiling water over it to help melt the coconut oil.

I think some chopped walnuts would make this a 5 star recipe, but I didn't add them this time so that my son could take it to his nut-free school in his lunchbag.

I reduced to 1/3 C Dark Brown sugar and 1/3 C granulated sugar.
Also used only 2 large eggs, 2 tsp Ground Ginger and 1tsp. Ground cloves, 1/3 cup local honey, 1/2 C applesauce and they were fab!!

Made recipe as written w/ these changes: used half whole-wheat pastry flour and half all-purpose flour, used half the white sugar called for and 1/4 c less brown sugar, omitted freshly grated nutmeg (increase ground nutmeg by same amt), substituted olive oil for safflower oil, used small wild low-bush cranberries (frozen when added to mix). The muffins came out okay, if a little greasy when served warm (I used ungreased, paper-lined muffin tins, standard and mini-muffin sizes). This seems to happen when using coconut oil in most baked goods if you don't adjust the dry ingredients. The muffins were much better the next morning after cooling uncovered on counter (seemed less greasy, as coconut fat is solid @ room temp), with nice crisp tops. The crumb is nice but the muffins are too homogenous/blah texture-wise; however, I prefer more texture in my muffins. I will make this again, adding 1 1/2- 2 c of toasted chopped walnuts or pecans and doubling the amount of cranberries. I'll probably use all olive oil (or at least sub unsweetened applesauce)to omit coconut oil to reduce the saturated fat and hopefully mitigate the greasiness when served warm. The sweetness and flavor are good, even with the reduced sugar and without the fresh grated nutmeg. Thanks for a great use of squash and cranberries!!

Not bad, had a decent crown but then again with this much sugar I feel like they are more a desert cake then a breakfast type muffin. If you put a lot of sugar in anything it usually tastes good but not so good for you.

These muffins are delicious. The tart cranberries are perfectly balanced by the lightly sweet, moist muffin of squash. Everyone loves them, and I receive endless compliments. 

I prefer lots of fruit in my muffins, so I double the number of cranberries. However, that is not necessary at all. As for the spices, typically out of conviene I use the same ground nutmeg and ground ginger. However, if you use fresh ginger and nutmeg the spice palet of the muffins is incredible.

I cut the white sugar in half, but I think next time I will cut it out entirely and just use the brown sugar. They were plenty sweet. I can't imagine how sweet they would be with all that sugar. I also used melted butter instead of veggie oil. I loved these though. Really like the taste of the coconut in there with the squash and cranberries. All the flavors complement each other.

Our CSA farm share gives us a lot of squash this time of year, so I am always looking for new ways to use it.  I used a kabocha squash (which cooks up and mashes very like Butternut), a little extra dried powdered nutmeg (since I didn't have any fresh), and chopped ginger from a jar.  I did find the batter a little dry, and added about 1/2 cup of milk to moisten it to a better consistency.  The finished muffins were very tasty and moist, so maybe the milk wasn't really necessary.

I did  make a few changes as suggested by some of the other reviewers. I couldn't find fresh cranberries seasonally so I had to use dried and I added some extra because I enjoy extra fruit in my muffins. I also used apple sauce instead of the one oil.  They were delicious. Everyone in my family ate them quickly.

Now, I don't like my muffins too sweet.. so I made some changes. I used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup all purpose, half of what the original recipe calls for both white and brown sugars, all spices the same amount but I didn't have fresh ginger so I used about 1 tsp ground ginger I had. I used about a cup and a half of fresh cranberries, and subbed the saffron oil for applesauce.
These were good and will make again, but the spices completely masked the butternut squash taste. I will probably use only half of the spices called for to get more of a savory muffin versus a dessert muffin. Thanks!

Tasty and not too sweet! Used dried instead of fresh cranberries and added a bit of pumpkin pie spice for a little extra fall flavor. Great base recipe to add your own twists.

Made these this past Friday. Amazing! Thank you for sharing your recipe! The fresh cranberries, squash and those wonderful seasonings were just perfect together.  Made 24 as stated but I did need longer baking time with my oven. Were worth the wait though. They taste so good even 2-3 days later.

These are delicious!  The recipe is perfect and even made exactly 24 muffins as promised.   Walnuts or pecans might be a good addition, but they are not necessary.  These are very sweet and I'd look at them more as a dessert than a breakfast, but some people eat doughnuts for breakfast, so to each their own.

Good muffin overall, flavorful and hearty. I made 1/2 batch (12) with 1/3 c  of each sugar.  Cut cloves by half, was still pretty prominent. Substituted applesauce for safflower oil. Used shredded squash and cooked in the microwave for about 5 min until soft. Used 3/4 c craisins soaked in hot water instead of fresh and added 3/4 c chopped pecans. About 225cal per muffin.

Pretty good!  I have tons of butternut squash and loved that I could use up a whole BNSquash with this recipe.  I think my personal preference would be to add some oats or whole wheat flour to this next time i made it to make it a little more hearty!  Thanks for sharing

Amazing muffins. Almost like pumpkin pie with a tang from the cranberries. I didn't make any changes but  I was pretty liberal with the cranberries...you can't have enough fresh cranberries.

I will be trying this very soon as butternut squash and cranberries are two of my very favorite things but I never thought of marrying them together! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.
