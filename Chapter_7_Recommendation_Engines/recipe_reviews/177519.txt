The frozen pasta and vegetable blend I chose was pasta, broccoli, carrots, sugar snap peas, and garlic sauce mix.  I used mushroom soup.  The only modifications I made were to add a little garlic, salt and pepper.  I typically like to prepare more homemade dishes, but I can't discount something as easy and flavorful as this on those nights when I'm just not in the mood to cook.  This went over really well.  I was surprised at how good it was when I took my first bite.  One note:  pasta/veggie blends typically come with some sort of sauce.  If you choose to cook your own noodles and use a regular blend of vegetables, keep in mind that you will be missing the sauce and added flavor that comes with the pasta/veggie blend.  Maybe try to compensate for that by adding extra spices.

This is a glorified Skillet Sensation.  I couldn't find the pasta/veggie blend, so I just boiled whole wheat pasta and a blend of dinner veggies, I used cream of chicken soup, too.  This just wasn't very flavorful or exciting and, while edible, we probably won't make it again.

I rated this as is, but with minor modifications, it's great! Add a large handful of crackers (Ritz works best- maybe about 10-12). If you don't use a blend (but use your own pasta and a bagged veggie), add about 1 TBS. onion (powder or dried) and salt and pepper to taste. You can use chicken, turkey or tuna.

With a few modifications this meal was a huge success with my family!  I seasoned the chicken with celery salt, pepper and a little lemon juice (I was very generous with the celery salt).  I didn't have the pasta/veggie blend so I boiled whole wheat pasta and used fresh green beans and carrots for the veggies. For the sauce I used cream of chickenâ€¦this was such a quick, easy and delicious meal. I will be making this again  :)

It was by no means bad, but it was definitely bland and tasted like it was missing something.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  It did not have much flavor and the chicken ended up dry without any flavor, even after it simmered with the other ingrediants.  I was going for a quick fix for a tasty low maintenance meal and I got everything but the tasty part!  There are just too many other simple and tasty 30 minute meals to waste anytime on this one.

VERY easy, yummy recipe. I give it 5 stars because, with a few easy alterations, you can easily give it so much flavor. Try adding parmesan cheese (and/or other cheeses), onion & garlic powder, and black pepper. YUMMY

I changed the recipe a lo. nstead of using noodles I used white long grain rice and instead of frozen vegetables I used canned vegetables (the mixed kind) and used whole chicken breasts, I bakedd it for 50 minutes on 375 degrees and it turned out wonderful. My family including my picky eater husband ate it and had seconds....

This was ok.  Very sloppy.  If I make it again I would add much more veggies to make it less like a soup.

eh, it was ok but definitely needed something. I had to add salt to get it to taste like something but otherwise it was quite bland even with salt though it wasn't great just ok.

Easy and palatable. I ate the whole thing even though it is pretty low quality. I realized, on second thought, that I should've just been using fresh vegetables and boiling pasta. It'd be much better for not much more effort.

Delicious. Quick. Easy. I seasoned the chicken with onion, garlic salt, pepper, italian seasoning, some curry powder, and a splash of lemon juice. The pasta/veggie blend I used was Birdseye Steam Fresh Lightly Sauced rotini and vegetables in a garlic butter sauce. I cooked the blend in the microwave for 4 minutes before adding to the chicken to speed up the process. I used cream of chicken soup and added some shredded cheddar cheese. I also had a serving of Kraft mac & cheese leftovers (that no one ever eats) so I added it to the mixture to use it up! I'm keeping this one on the list. It will be really easy to switch up the soup used and pasta/veggie blend to make it different each time.

it is very good but i think that if you put some pepper and salt it will be less dry and taste a little bit better.

This recipe was great! We loved it! Instead of doing a mixed pasta-veggies frozen bag, I cooked regular pasta and then mixed it in with the soup and frozen veggie pack. It turned out great! Will defiantly make it again!

Awesome!! My 10 year old son & I loved it! I did take someone else's advice and season the chicken with celery salt, pepper, and a little bit of lemon juice.  Before adding chicken to the skillet, I also heated up some minced garlic, and the dish came out perfectly!! It's all about the right seasoning, I'll definitely be making this again.

I didn't have a pasta/veggie blend, so I knew it would lack seasoning. For seasoning I used onion powder, garlic salt, pepper and chicken boullion seasoning. For the soup, I used cream of mushroom and it turned out tasty and pretty darned easy.

This was a delicious and simple meal. I had left over baked chicken breast so I cut that up instead. I used Campbell's cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I used 2 bags of frozen rice and veggies mix. It didn't come with a sauce so I added garlic, salt, and pepper for flavor. I used 1 cup of water since I doubled the rice and veggie blend. Everyone loved it and it was a huge hit with the family. We served it with corn on the cob.

I made this for dinner tonight and instead of the frozen blend I julienned carrots and zucchini.  Separately I boiled veggie noodles part of the way and then added them to my chicken mixture to finish.  For the chicken mixture I added some Greek seasoning to the chicken while browning and the cream of chicken soup.  My 2 year old LOVES it as do me and my husband.  Quick, easy, and delicious is what I need for a busy weeknight meal.

The base idea is very quick and simple but very bland the first time I made it. The second time I added fresh garlic, celery, onion powder, sea salt, and pepper. All in all a quick cheap side dish that is pretty good.
