I made this for Valentines Day and it is very good and I will make it again.  I am a little uneasy about the uncooked eggs.  I think I will work on making a custard to add to the cream cheese the next time.

I only was able to freeze it an hour and a half so it wasn't completely set up, also I put it in pie plate and didn't have room for all the filing :-( next time I will use the 9x13. Very tasty!
