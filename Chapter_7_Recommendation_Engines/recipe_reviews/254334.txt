The pie was very good! The corn bread made it taste very scrumptious.

Hubby absolutely hated it. I thought it was ok. I used Jiffy cornbread so I don't know why it was on the sweet side. My yogurt was plain Greek. However the chicken mixture was delicious.

The chicken mixture was good but not sure the cornbread got completely done. If we make it again I might try mexican cornbread and cook it longer.
