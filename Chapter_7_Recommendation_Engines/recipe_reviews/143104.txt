I would give this quite a few more stars if I could. I was intimidated by roasting the peppers but I am so happy I tried it out!!! YUMMY!!! It really does taste like the PC stuff:)

Wonderful dip! I used roasted garlic as suggested above. Also roasted a small onion. Thought it was going to be too runny but after a day in the fridge it was perfect.THANKS!!

Wow! I used roasted red peppers from a jar and the vinegar I used was balsamic as one reviewer suggested. The flavor of this dip is just amazing. The roasted red pepper flavor is enhanced by the balsamic and tomato paste and the cayenne pepper adds just the right amount of kick. My favorite veggies with this dip were blanched snow peas but I almost wanted to just eat this by itself as a soup! As a dip it was a little thin so I'd add a bit of cream cheese to the mix but that is my only suggestion for improvement. This was amazing and I will definitely be making it on a regular basis!

Although I didn't measure anything exactly this dip rocks! It tastes just like one that PC makes in Canadian grocery stores.

So so so sooooo good! I used balsamic vinegar and I may have pulsed it for too long because it was a bit runny so I threw in a lump of plain cream cheese and some parmesan. I will absolutely make this again. Great recipe!

The roasting part took the most work, but it was worth it.  The recipe wasmn't clear on whether to cool the peppers down before placing them in the plastic bag.  I was worried about melting the plastic or releasing chemicals by putting hot pepprs inside.  I cooled them down a bit first and that worked fine.  I substituted garlic powder, because I had no more fresh.  I also used 4 tablespoons of 1/2 fat mayo and left out the sour cream.  It was delicious and easy to make.

While I don't personally like sweet dressings nor roasted red peppers particularly. This dip was a beautiful and welcome addition to the veggie tray.

Very flavorful! I was out of sour cream so substituted with cream cheese but I should have softened it a bit first before putting in the food processor as the dip turned out a little lumpy. I will definitely use sour cream next time. I used a jar of roasted red peppers rather than going through the hassle of roasting my own and on the recommendation of other reviews I used balsamic vinegar. I would say the balsamic vinegar is the star 'secret' ingredient as it brings out the best of all the other flavors. Thank you for sharing Sarah!

Not terrible but not fabulous either. It was a little runny and seemed to be lacking something in the flavour department. I'll keep looking for a good cheeseless dip to serve as part of an appetizer table.

A wonderful & quick dip! I didn't roast my own peppers for lack of time so I just used bottled pre-roasted red peppers. I also used Miracle Whip Lite and Fat Free Sour Cream. I accidently left out the cayenne pepper but I will add it next time. It was a very nice kicky dip to have for crackers or veggies!

It was a very easy recipe to follow. I did make the following changes only because I didn't have mayonnaise and sour cream. The substitutes were 6% yoghurt and 1 small avocado. I added a little smoked paprika for enhancement. Lovely served with naan bread.

So I was looking for a recipe to use up some red peppers that I've had for a while. What better time to make this than Super Bowl Sunday? I don't think I would change a thing. My husband really enjoyed it.

Very good. I used store bought red peppers so they were already in vinegar. I didn't add the extra vinegar as a result. I'm so grateful now I don't have to buy it anymore!

I made this last night. It was absolutely fantastic. I will definitely make this a standard for BBQs and when I'm tasked with dip duty. It was so great! Thanks Sarah.
