I loved this salad!  I marinated the chicken in soysauce/ginger/brown sugar/garlic and oil then pan fried it - it added a lot of flavor - this is a great main dish salad for luncheons.

I thought this was a good recipe overall, but I made some tweaks and enjoyed it much more the second time. I sprinkled the chicken with a pre-made Schezuan spice mix before pan frying. I thought the dressing was too heavy with mayonnaise, so I cut the mayo to 2/3 cup and increased the sesame oil to 1 1/2 tablespoons. I added sliced celery, mushrooms and almonds and garnished the salad with sesame seeds, more almonds and crispy chow mein noodles instead of rice noodles. Mix in the dressing a little at a time, so you don't put in too much and overwhelm the taste of the veggies. Interesting recipe, a great mix of flavors and very filling.

This was a hit at the Memorial Day picnic!  To speed things up I used a bag of the coleslaw mix and grilled the chicken on my Foreman Grill.  I made the dressing a day in advance to make sure there was plenty of time for the sugar to break down the mayonaise.  Also, I found that it's much cheaper to buy sesame oil and sesame seeds at an Asian food store rather than the grocery store.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great salad.Cool and refreshing on a hot day. I added canned pineapple chunks for a moister, sweeter taste. Also to save time, I used the pre-packaged grated cabbage-carrot salad(cole slaw mix).

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added extra ginger to the dressing for more flavor and I grilled the chicken seasoned with salt and pepper on the Foreman which was perfect.  I also used 2 small heads of cabbage and 3 chicken breasts for two of us.  I too used the chow mein noodles and the crunchiness in the salad was great.  Would definitly make again.

Can make this ahead and mix just before serving. Next time I'll use low fat mayonaise since there is so much in it. My husband said it had too musch sesame oil.  Be sure to add the sesame seeds last.  Adding some crispy noodles would be good (I didn't have any).

I LOVE this salad. I like mine with sliced almonds and mandarin orange slices. I also added some chopped celery and a green pepper. It is EXCELLENT!So colorful...I did thin down the dressing, used less mayo and a bit of salad oil and vinegar. GREAT!

I agree with the previous comment about the dressing having too much mayo and I also felt there was too much cabbage. I will continue my search for a sesame salad.

We enjoyed this a lot.  I also thought the dressing was a little heavy so I thinned it down with some vinger and that gave it a nice tangy flavor.  I also added some toasted sliced almonds.

I made this as a side salad, without the chicken. Excellent! The only thing I will do next time is use a little less dressing.

YUMM-EE! I had one leftover teriyaki chicken breast and about a quarter head of cabbage and was looking for lunch - this was it. I halved everything, but didn't add any green onions (didn't have any). I added just about a teaspoon of rice vinegar to the dressing and added the dressing little by little to avoid drenching it. It was very good and next time I will add slivered almonds and mandarin orange pieces as another reviewer suggested.

I made some minor adjustments and the final product was very tasty!  I used broccoli slaw mix (because I like it!), brown sugar instead of white, added some celery, some sliced almonds, and a few shakes of rice vinegar.  I also only added enough mayo to mix the salad together.  Served on a bed of greens garnished with mandarin orange segments and crispy fried rice noodles.  YUM!

My family loves this chicken salad.  I came across the recipe several years ago looking for something different to make with leftover baked chicken.  I follow the recipe exactly, I can't imagine any changes that would make it better.  Thanks, Carole, for creating and sharing this recipe.

Halve the mayo and double all veggies. I marinated the chicken in a soy sauce, ginger root, garlic, honey, and sesame oil blend for 20 minutes prior to pan frying. Delicious!!

This is excellent, but I make a few changes. I poach the chicken in watered down garlic teriyaki sauce, use 2 t. of fresh, grated ginger instead of ground ginger, and I use a dash of rice vinegar to thin the dressing a little bit. I serve it on top of the thinly sliced cabbage instead of mixing them together, and the thinner dressing coats the cabbage but keeps it crunchy.

This is an easy quick supper.  Though I baked my chicken breast meat in the oven covered in foil, it didn't have much flavor even though I stirred it into the dressing before combining everything.  Next time I will use a roasted chicken from the store.  Rice sticks are easy to fry up without a lot of oil.  Yummy supper.
