This recipe was really good and easy to make, I followed it excactly and it came out good. The second time I made it, I did change it a bit. Instead of two cups of shortening I used 1 cup of butter and  1 cup of shortening.  It was wonderful.

This cream was just perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I used this cream to fill cream puffs. This cream is very similar to the cream inside of a cream filled donut. It is very sweet and very good!

This was exactly what I wanted for a cupcake filling. Adjusted the recipe down to a manageable 25 cupcakes portion and followed the recipe exactly. Light and fluffy and sweet enough to balance the cake. I turned half of it into a raspberry cream filling by macerating frozen raspberries and adding the juice to the filling. Bright pink in color but a wonderful raspberry flavor that balanced the lemon frosting and white cake.

Yay! Found a great cream filling recipe here. I used half butter/half shortening. Only had regular (not clear) vanilla extract on hand but this didn't change the while color of the cream at all. Piped it into cupcakes. Beware, the recipe as stated makes a ton of cream. Great recipe!

Perfect! I quartered the recipe to fill a dozen maple crumb bars. The filling is light and fluffy and delicious. I used Spectrum Organic Non-hydrogenated Vegetable Shortening, which made it less greasy and less unhealthy than standard shortening.

I loved this filling.  I made chocolate cupcakes and filled them and my daughter said she had never eaten anything so delicious in her life.  I have been trying to find a recipe like this for years. Thanks so much for sharing!

Love this recipe!  I even use it as a cake frosting, to me it's better than buttercream.  Made this to frost the black chocolate cake (on Allrecipes) and everyone thought it was wonderful.

I used this filling in cream horn cookies for my niece's wedding reception and it worked PERFECTLY!  I did add a little almond extract, because that's the flavor I was aiming for.  The best part of this filling is that it held up and the cookies didn't need to be refrigerated... which means they didn't get soggy!  LOVE THIS RECIPE!  Thanks so much for sharing it!!!!

I was really excited to see the reviews on this recipe but it is not the recipe I was hoping it would be.  I was looking for a more cream type filling, instead it is more of an icing.

I just did this recipe..I'm sure I did it wrong or something, but it still had a slight taste of the shortening...not sure why.  The consistency came out great and the sweetness was there but the taste wasn't that great.  Any thoughts from anyone?

Thank you for this amazing white cream filling recipe! Made it today and used it to fill lady locks (creme horns). The family loved them. I liked artslurry's spin on the recipe using the melted peanut butter. I'm gonna have to try it with chocolate cupcakes sometime soon.

It's super easy and very yummy. I made half the recipe, put in a bit more vanilla than it called for, used half butter/half shortening, and frosted a chocolate cake with it. Kids loved it :D

This is a great recipe for frosting a cake or for a doughnut filling. I was looking for something similar to Ding Dong or Twinkie filling. This reminds me more of what I'd find in a pastry shop. The shortening gives it a lot of body, so it holds its shape hours after you decorate with it.

This cream recipe is exactly what I've been looking for for many years!  I did halve it.  I used it for the filling in my pumpkin whoopie pies and it tasted just like the Amish one's in Shipshewana:)!  I did do something different though.  I didn't boil the sugar and water.  I nuked it in the microwave for a minute until it was clear and then put it in the freezer for a couple of minutes to cool.  You have to use CRISCO or it will taste really gross.  Eating it alone, you will have a slight shortening taste.  When eating it in the whoopie pie, you can't taste anything but pure bliss:D!  My kids LOVED it!

Loved this! I couldn't believe something so good and professional- tasting came from my little kitchen with just a few simple ingredients. I used it to frost the Black Magic Cake on this site. Turned out perfectly. So easy to make. Easy to scale up or down. Thank you so much! Will make this again and again.

I made this using all dairy casein free ingredients and it turned out amazing. Thank you for a wonderful recipe to guide me on making it dairy free completely. I will definitely be using this again with the very few tweaks that I made to it. I’m sure your family is thrilled to have such an amazing cook in the family. God Bless you and yours

I quartered this recipe (note that the recipe serves 100 as written) and used it to fill 30 better - than - Hostess chocolate cupcakes and it was perfect! like others, I used 1/4 butter and 1/4 shortening. I had some cream left over, I'd say a quarter recipe fills about three dozen cupcakes

Well, I made some changes to the recipe. I only did 3 cups of powdered sugar, and it was totally sweet enough. And I only did 1 1/2 cups of shortening. Also, I did a splash more of vanilla plus what the recipe said. And lastly, the best thing, I added about 1-1 1/2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream to it. SO DELICIOUS!! It makes it more like a filling rather than an icing- type thing. I love this recipe with the differences!!

This is the second time I've made this filling, and it is great!  The first time I followed it exactly...but I added some cinnamon, nutmeg and clove to make it spiced for some fall chocolate cupcakes.  This time, I went to pull out my shortening, only to find that I was all out (oops!)  So, I substituted softened butter, and it turned out great.  Whew!  I did a 1/2 recipe both times, and it easily filled 50 cupcakes...with a little extra left over.

This is my 'go to' recipe for filling, although I make a portion of what this recipe calls for. After trying other filling recipes, we have a winner!  Perfect for cream horns.  YUM!

It was spectacular. I quartered the recipe 2hich scaled down beautifully. I also had only olive or coconut oils on hand so I used coconut oil, and it did have a slightly coconut taste. I will be using this forever.

I halved the recipe and it was still plenty.  I followed the other recommendations and used half margarine and half Crisco.  I used regular vanilla because I did not have white vanilla and it was fine.  I have made this twice.  It is very important to follow the directions and let the sugar syrup cool before adding it to the shortening or the consistency of the cream will not be smooth.

Conversions 
(I use King Arthur's chart for each ingredient, not a 1 oz = 28g straight conversion. Even different type flours have a different weight per cup, it makes that much difference)

198 g sugar
111 g water
198 g veg oil
368 g veg shortening
4 g clear vanilla (typical 11 lb will not measure this low)
908 g confect sugar

I did the 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening recommended by many others, and liked the flavor.  It is definitely a filling type icing, think the inside of a Hostess cupcake or a cream filled  Krispy Kreme.  It is super sweet and whips up light and creamy.  
I kept it on high in the stand mixer for 10 minutes, I think this is necessary for that airy texture.  It was a little loose but good to pipe inside the cupcakes. Out of the fridge the next day, after about 10 minutes on the counter, it was a little firmer but didn't have to go back to the mixer.

I used it inside a chocolate cupcake with an unsweetened 60% chocolate ganache poured over. It needed the bitterness from the ganache to cut all of the sweet. Excellent together, all ages enjoyed.

I had some left over cream and mixed it with lemon curd (about 2 parts cream, 1 part thick curd) and used that to top a little 6" single chocolate layer cake.  Good stuff.

A half recipe yielded about 4 cups.  Makes a LOT.

this is a fantastic frosting recipe!  It taste just like that frosting you get in a cream Horn at a bakery. I followed the recipe exactly. I’ve been making frosting from scratch without a recipe for 30+ years and this is the best yet!

Like some others, I've been looking for this one for years.  I didn't even know it was called Holland Creme.  The lil hole in the wall bakery where I grew up had the best Cream Horns on the planet.  But HA, you've posted their secret filling and I can't thank you enough!!  I recently bought horn forms and made the pastry horns, filling it with this wonderful fluff.  I did use half butter and half High Ratio shortening and a splash more of vanilla.  Heavenly!

I have been trying to make Carlson's marshmallow doughnuts for a few years now and I can never get the fluffy white filling the way it should be, but this recipe did the trick. If you ever visit Annapolis, you gotta go to Carlson's for doughnuts. So good!

I was looking for a lighter, fluffier cream filling. This was too greasy for my taste.

Well, first to say that I did not have shortening on hand, so I substituted butter. It tasted alright. The consistency was great, but even with adding more and more confectioners sugar, you could STILL taste the butter. Yuk.

I have to say, the consistency was eh and although I could alter it with water, the taste of shortening was way too strong. I'll definitely sub butter if I try it again. Also, the amount made was monstrous!

I have been looking for a white cream filling for months and when I saw this I was excited.
After following the recipe to the letter I was highly disappointed, it was more like frosting, very sweet and slightly gritty from the powdered sugar.  Not soft and creamy the way a doughnut or cream horn filling should be.
If anyone has a good white cream filling please share it.

I tried it for the first time today and I did as some of the others did and used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of shortening and this has got to be the best cream ever!  Perfect balance and not too sweet!

I made 1/4 of the recipe for 12 chocolate cupcakes. I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and regular vanilla. I'm in an RV so supplies were limited. I used 1/2 filling, then converted the rest to chocolate frosting. Adding 3-4T Hershey chocolate syrup (all I had for chocolate), 1&3/4C powder sugar, and 2-3t milk. They turned out awesome, and filling is perfect.

I would give no stars. 

Terrible recipe. Followed instructions precisely. Not a novice baker. The mixture was cloyingly sweet, runny & grainy. All you taste is grainy powdered sugar. Will not make this again.

Awesome, and it does seem to be the exact, same filling used in pastry and doughnuts!  One question though, how long will the Holland Cream last in the fridge?  Can't find any info on how long this will be good for?

This tastes just like the inside of an Oreo! I did make an adjustment in that I used High Ratio Shortening instead of regular (high ratio melts at a lower temperature than regular so it doesn't leave that long-lasting greasy film in your mouth). That said, it's the only thing I changed, and I would definitely make it again. I do think it's sweet and next time I make it I might start tasting at 6c of confectioner's sugar and go up from there if necessary.

This was perfect for filling homemade donuts! I never knew what cream filling actually consists of until attempting to make it homemade and I'm rather disgusted by the ingredients hahaha. Either way it turned out perfect and I will definitely make it again. I even thought about adding some mint flavor to it to liven up the donuts.

If you like corner pieces, you will like this recipe.

Very sweet, closer to frosting than cream but creamier texture than the usual quick frosting recipes. Still a little bit of grit but coloured great and piped very well onto a birthday cake.

Switched out half the shortening for butter.

This recipe is really good, I use it in my bakery as a frosting for Red Velvet Cake Donuts and Baked Cinnamon Rolls. I'll recommend to use butter instead of any kind of oil, and mix it a little longer to get a very smooth texture; you can also add some flavor to it - Lemon, Rum.
