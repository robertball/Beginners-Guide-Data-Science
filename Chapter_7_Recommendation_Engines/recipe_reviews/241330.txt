Very good added some garlic, rosemary and herb seasoning, cooked Ital sausage in our new wave  then sliced it and added it to sauce pan with other ingredients. Also used home canned pizza sauce. Will definitely make again.

We love this dish!  My mom isn't crazy about penne (though I love it) so I make it with regular spaghetti noodles and omit the red peppers, also like to use italian sausage links, brown them, slice while still a little raw in the middle .  I saute some onions with zucchini  before adding the half-cooked sausage, add in the pizza sauce and let it simmer until the sausage is fully cooked, stir in velveeta and the noodles.  So good, I am ready for dinner tonight!

Had to substitute the Velveeta with cream cheese. It was not bad.

made this for my family. It was a definite hit. We don't like zucchini so I substituted green pepper and added a little extra red pepper. I also added Italian seasoning. I will definitely make this again!

Great family casserole. Instead of Velveeta I used cream cheese, milk, and Parmesan.  I added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes". This is our Yum Yum casserole!

Simple recipe to make for my husband, who likes cheesy casseroles. I would prefer to spice it up a bit, but he liked it as is. Was a nice way to start out using the first of this year's zucchini.

This was nice and homey and fed 5 hungry adults. I did have to make some substitutions however: I used jarred roasted peppers, fresh mushrooms and sliced yellow squash. I also used ground beef with Italian sausage spices and added some sliced pepperoni. Didn't have Parma so used mozzarella instead. Tasty and a good way to serve generous portions.

It is delicious! My wife made it before and I loved it... Didn't realize it was the same thing I had made until I had tasted it. I would add a little more sausage and Velveeta. 

The recipe is a little wrong when it calls for 3/4 cup of noodle... Should be 3/4 poundor box of pine noodles

I agree a little bland so I added red onion chopped green onion chopped garlic paste garlic powder and onion powder also used far more of pizza sauce and sausage  topped with layer of mozzarella  then parmesean 

I precooked the sausage and used same pan with a little water  for veggies then added the cooked sausage to  mix and heated through.. I used mild sausage but maybe will try hot sausage or add a little tabascco/red pepper flakes next time

This recipe turned out wonderful! The only thing I added was green onion and garlic since I had it on hand. The kids loved it too! I would definitely make this again!
