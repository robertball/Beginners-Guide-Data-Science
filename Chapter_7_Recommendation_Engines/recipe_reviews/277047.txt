Made this soup for lunch today and it was super yummy!  I left out the onion flakes (didn't have any) and added one chopped sweet onion to the cauliflower and carrots, used 2 cups of chicken broth so left out the bouillon cube and used a regular can of coconut milk.  Was a cold day here today and this not only tasted delicious but warmed us up.  Thanks for sharing.

This soup was very easy to make and delicious! I used vegetable broth instead of water and the broth cube. I also used onion powder instead of flakes . I forgot to mention that I also used spinach instead of kale.

Tasty. Was much better before I added the kale, which just crowded out the other ingredients and dulled the flavor. If you really do add an entire bunch of kale, it becomes kale soup, not lentil soup. Cauliflower was a nice choice to complement the lentils.

Hearty and tasty.  I'm making it again and adding a few more veggies, will see if I like that even better.
