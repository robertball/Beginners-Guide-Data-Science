Wonderful!  I changed the recipe a bit, though, to make it a main dish instead of a side dish.  First, I sauteed a bit of garlic in the butter before mixing the sauce.  Second, I used penne pasta instead of spaghetti.  And finally, I added a cup of broccoli florets.  Mmmm, served with garlic toast and a salad, this was wonderful.  Oh yes...instead of baking it in the oven (its just too hot for that) I cooked it on high in the microwave 5 minutes, and added a little milk when stirring the cheese in.  Simply a fantastic dish, even my husband, the devoted carnivore, loved it.

With a few modifications that suited my tastes better, this was absolutely a five star dish.  I skipped the lemon zest and without it this had just the desired fresh, delicate hint of lemon. The baking method didn’t appeal to me.  I saw that as an unnecessary step that would just take extra time.  I wanted to keep it simple and I wanted the dish to be creamy and saucy, so I simply prepared the sauce, adding some fresh minced garlic to the melted butter, then finished the sauce as directed before tossing it with the pasta (I used pappardelle, a sort of wide fettucine).  We really enjoyed this, particularly alongside “Grilled BBQ Meatloaf,” also from this site, and Brussels sprouts with bacon.

This was so good and amazingly simple to make.  The pasta has a strong lemony flavor and my family loved it.  Even my 16 month old couldn't get enough.  I am already wondering what I can add to make a full meal.  I think next time I will try adding some broccoli, mushrooms and chicken breasts.  This is one we will keep around for a long time.

WE LOVED THIS! Perfect amt of lemon taste, but then again, I ommitted the zest. I added 2 boneless, cooked chicken breasts (cubed) and 1/2c fresh broccoli. I was a tad on the dry side (I assume due to my additions) and when I make this next time, I will use 12oz pasta, same amt of chicken (or perhaps shrimp), 1cup broccoli and double the sauce. A great, easy recipe that's sure to impress! We loved the recipe Sandy T!

Very tasty even if you are not a lemon fan.  It sounded weird at first but once it was baked it was divine. Definetly a keeper.

This is so great on either a hot sunmmer day or a say when you want something light and delicious. Reminds me of a pasta dish Frank Sinatra made. And yes lemmon and cheese work well together.

This is the kind of recipe that I scour this website for.  It's original and delicious!  I will admit that I took a cue from another reviewer and substituted orange juice.  It's what I had on hand.  I also mixed the parmesan and parsley into the sauce and sprinkled only a little parmesan on top before I baked.  I'm so pleased that I'm quite anxious to try it again with the lemon juice.  I may take it slow and only add two tablespoons and give it a taste. Anyway, it's great!  Thanks!

Oh My!! This was Delicious!!  I had something similar at a gormet restaurant and this was better!  I did tweak a bit.  Skipped the butter to be healthier, used less sour cream.  I had some fat free whipping cream so I added about a cup of that but could probably get by with milk.  Grated the outside of one whole lemon, and used the juice of two whole lemons.  Added broccoli and used a whole box of Penne Pasta.  Didn't have parsley so I used fresh cilantro.  It was a great main dish and gone!

Great flavor and so simple to make. I did modify by increasing the sauce (50%), adding the parmesan cheese and parsley with the pasta and sauce before baking and adding a chopped cooked chicken breast. Great with garlic bread! Magnifique.

Yummy & easy.  I left out the zest since some said it was too lemony.  It is a little dry after you bake it, not sure how to fix that.  Definately adding some grilled chicken pieces would good.  I'll keep this one!

This recipe makes for an interesting experience; however, it just seems like something is missing. It's not something I'm likely to make a second time.

My husband liked this recipe much better than I did.  I thought it was too dry,
although I did like the flavor.  I don't think I would make it again.

I felt this was a little dry, but taste wise there was potential. Since I'd need to revise it quite a bit, i feel two stars is sufficient. Thank you for the experience.

I thought this was so yummy, but my boyfriend didn't think it was anything special (hence, my rating of 4). He thought there was too much butter. I don't. I agree that the sauce is thick (I added milk to thin it out), but the butter, lemon and sour cream go so well together!

Yumm!  We really enjoyed this dish and that's saying a lot coming from my DH! I only made a minor alteration by adding some parmesan cheese (1/4 cup) to the sour cream mixture and also on top (another 1/4 cup).  This was a really good dish which tasted "fresh".  It is worth noting however that because you're baking the pasta, you should slightly undercook it when boiling.  If the spaghetti is cooked all the way through and then baked for another 20 minutes, by then it's overcooked and mushy.

This dish was very refreshing.  I prepared it with fat free sour cream and fat free margarine and it still came out very tasty.  I served it as a side with a grilled chicken breast, steamed broccoli, and crusty bread.  I couldn't believe it, but my picky children asked for more noodles - WITH SAUCE.  I will be making this again!

Wow! I was pleasantly surprised at this recipe. It is something I would have never thought to come up with.  I do not think children would like this, way too sour, but I loved it.  It is sooo different.  My husband hasn't sampled any yet and I don't think he would like it.  It is very acidic, an acquired taste.  I only baked mine for 10 minutes since the top was getting crispy.  It was not dry at all.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon of the lemon zest and along with the full ammount of lemon juice that was plenty.  This would taste wonderful with some sugar snap peas.

This is a great recipe; however, I'd recommend using a different pasta rather than spaghetti--Perhaps a penne or a rotelle pasta instead of spaghetti.

I tasted the sauce before I poured it over the spaghetti and thought 'EW!!!' but I poured it on anyway, and completed the dish.  I tasted it again, and 'YUM!!'  The sauce is strong by itself, but the pasta seems to absorb the light, lemony flavor, leaving you with a creamy sauce.  It's fabulous!

This recipe is very easy and tasty.  It's a great base to add other vegetables or toppings.  I grate a little bit of fontinella on top and it blows my mind!

I needed something quick and easy with ingredients I had on hand. I, like others, sauted garlic in the butter . After reading some reviews, I was a bit worried it may turn out dry, so I drzzled some chicken broth on it. About 1C. I aslo stirred in frozen peas before baking. I think it would be great with all the suggested veggies, including edamame, and mushrooms. And, my picky, picky four year olt ranted and raved about this dish.

Great recipe!  Everyone liked this a lot.  The lemon flavor was excellent, and I added tomatoes and shrimp and garlic which made for a great combination.  Next time I may add chicken and broccoli like some other reviewers.

Very nice.  Easy to prepare.  We enjoyed the light taste (surprising given all the sour cream).  I would make this again.

This is now a staple dish that my family eats.  We love it!  It is also good with grilled chicken to make it a more complete meal.

It's different.  I might make it again but next time I will add some fresh parmesan before baking.

The acidity of the lemon juice and sour cream didn't work for me.  I added lots more parmesan and ground some white pepper over it, but it still wasn't great.  I wouldn't make it again without a lot of tinkering, in fact, I'd just go for an alfredo.

This was, well, strange.  I was not prepared for how sour I thought it was!  My husband and I weren't impressed, but his parents enjoyed it.  A generational thing?  I added chicken and broccoli, even a little sugar (it didn't help much).  This one isn't for everyone!

Excellent & simple. I used orange juice & zest instead and it was great. Mine was very thick & juicy & not dry at all as I held back a bit on the linguini. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent! Per others, I added some cooked/cubed chicken breasts, broccoli and mushrooms. This required me to double the sauce but the result was excellent! My boyfriend said "Do NOT lose this recipe!" - I have to agree!

I used light (not fat-free) sour cream, and replaced some of the butter with nonfat 1/2 and 1/2 - it was still very rich and yummy!

A great recipe that works for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. I did change up the recipe by sauteeing garlic in the butter and cooking it all on the stove rather than banking it. I added some spinach and used penne rather than spaghetti. My boyfriend had his with chicken and I enjoyed it as is. Lovely dish, simple to make and a hit in my house. Thanks for sharing!

This is great! Simple, quick to throw together and tasty. I've made it twice and the second time I added 3 or 4 tbps of basil pesto. It was great both ways but I highly recommend trying it with pesto. Great alternative to a tomato based sauce. Also, I had to sub the sour cream once for plain Greek yogurt, since it's what I had on hand, and it turned out the same. Delish

Great flavor, but I think next time, I'll skip the baking and just serve the pasta with the delicious sauce. Baking made it a little bit dry.

Lemon and cheese go together really well - but I don't feel that the sour cream or baking it added much. I already enjoy adding lemon juice, garlic powder, parsley and parmesan to pasta so I hoped that this would give that a fun twist.  It wasn't bad, but I'll stick to my own lemon recipe.

Fast & Easy!
I really liked this, especially since this is a very adaptable recipe. I didn't have any fresh parsley so used dried. I also stirred toasted, chopped walnuts when it came out of the oven. The sauce was tasty & creamy without being too heavy. Next time I plan on adding some veggies or meat.

This was a very easy recipe to make.  I love lemon with pasta!  I don't care to much for sour cream so next time I might half it and add more Parmesan Cheese.  I added fresh zucchini, carrots and broccoli.   I used the juice and zest of 1 large lemon.  I might add more next time. I cooked it the 15 minutes and then added the Parmesan Cheese and some breadcrumbs to the top and put it back in the oven for a few minutes.  I really enjoyed this recipe.  Thanks!

This was nothing special, it ended up coming out pretty thick and I went easy on the lemon due to  other reviews but it really should have more in it. I also added some garlic and white wine but it still wasn't extremely flavorful.

Very good! I followed direction exactly and it turned out great. I slice and breaded 1 eggplant and baked it until golden and then cut slices into smaller pieces and tossed it into the pasta and sauce and baked it all in the oven. It was a great addition and a good way to sneak in a veggie to my kids. I could see that any roasted vegetable would be a nice addition.

Very good!  Beware it is not your typical pasta and may not appeal to all.  Many complained about it being "bitter".  Really, how do you think it will taste when main ingredients are sour cream and lemon?  I liked the flavor!  It is also a "dry" pasta, but again, I didn't mind it and liked it just fine!  My changes were adding two cloves of minced garlic and about a tablespoon of pesto just because I had those ingredients and like them.

Anti-seafood boyfriend was just ga-ga over baked tilapia with this perfect accompaniement! I toned down the lemon influence second time around and as we are mostly lact.int. I used nonfat dairy and less of it so I didn't bake it.

I just made this the other night and it is awesome!  I did not bake it as directed.  Just drained the cooked pasta, added a little olive oil and the rest of the ingredients along with about 3/4 cup of the pasta water and served with the Artichoke Chicken from this site.  Don't even want to count the calories but it made a beautiful presentation and was definately a restaurant quality meal.

Very Lemony but that's how we like it. I added steamed broccoli to it after it came out of the oven. I'll use this recipe again for sure. I think next time I'll add grilled chicken like others have suggested.

I am just not sure how to feel about this recipe. It needs a little tweeking and I will probably experiment with it to get it just right as I love the basic idea. I will try adding less lemon juice or adding cream instead to cut out the bitterness. It needed something more so I put in some garlic powder. Just enough to compliment the flavor and not be the main taste. Added more butter and parmasean to try and mellow out the bitterness. I also used lowfat sour cream as I wanted less calories. Pretty good just need to find a way to take away the bitterness of the lemon.

I love lemony pasta, so I was excited to try this recipe although I typically don't like creamy sauces.  The taste was really great, but I found the sauce to be particularly thick.  If I could, I'd rate it a 5 for the taste and a 3 for the texture (hence, the 4 stars).

I made this looking for something simple yet filling as we didn't have much in the cupboard, and was pleasently surprised that I had all the ingredients!  My family loved it and my kids (even my fussy one) asked for more!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have to say that this was not what I expected.  It was more sour than I thought it would be and I even tasted the sauce before baking it.  I doubt I'll make it again, as I'm unsure what I could add to improve the flavor.  Maybe it is better served cold?

This is the first time I've used sour cream in a pasta recipe, and I did not like the results.  Everything came out the way it was supposed to, it wasn't dry or anything, I just didn't like the way the sour cream tasted with the pasta at all.  I'm sure this is just a matter of personal preference, if you like sour cream pasta dishes, this is the recipe for you.

This recipe was good. I love lemon pasta, but this was VERY lemony. I wasnt sure why it was neccesary to bake this once the sauce was mixed together, it get very dry. The flavor was very good, I might use less pasta next time.

Definitely yummy, but am I really the only person whose sour cream curdled upon impact with the lemon juice?  The net result was a lemon butter pasta with a few flecks of curdled sour cream here and there. I managed to hide the unsightly white flecks with some broccoli, black olives, and sliced grilled chicken, but next time I’ll save the calories and omit the sour cream.
