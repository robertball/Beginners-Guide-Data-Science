I don't have a rice cooker so I did mine on the stove. This came out good but I would bump up the spice measurements next time. That or I would use white rice which absorbs flavor better in my opinion.

1.25.20 ...https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/220859/cajun-meatless-red-beans-and-brown-rice/ ... Went stovetop & subbed with already cooked beans.  I halved the thyme since that seems right for me; cayenne, too.  Mild with 1/8t.  I made the equivalent amount of white rice as brown - alotta rice, too much. 'Didn't have concentrate, but I'm sure it - or ham/bacon ;D - would make this better.  Good as is!  Healthy, too, with less rice.  Thank you!
