I made this pie at the same time I tried another recipe so that I could compare the two.  The molasses made this pie too intense.  I like the creamier pumpkin pie recipes.

I haven't met a pumpkin pie I didn't like yet. This one was good, but I can't say it stands out from other pumpkin pies I've had.

Finally, I have been waiting for someone to post a pumpkin pie recipe with molasses!  You will not believe the the taste.  This takes you from a squash pie to a real pumpkin pie.  Our family has been using molasses in pumpkin pie for 3 generations now & I am always telling people to add it to their pie.  Thank you.

My BF said "This is probably the best pumpkin pie I've ever eaten!"  Thanks!  I did make a couple of minor changes: I used ginger snaps for the crust, added 1 TB pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and ginger, and used fat free evaporated milk.  It was awesome!  It was so good we ate it up in 3 days (just the 2 of us) and he begged me to make another one.  It was so simple to make I didn't mind, and for the second batch I substituded 1/2 of the sugar for no-calorie sugar (like splenda for baking) and didn't notice any difference!  This will be my go-to pumpkin pie for sure!

This is the best pumpkin pie I ever made! Thank you Marcia! The only thing I add was about 1/2 tsp. ground clove, because I like it, but I'm certain it would be great without it, too. The molasses was the big difference. It's hard to imagine that amount would make that much difference to the taste, but it added a wonderful, rich, flavor that enhanced the pumpkin flavor so well. Thanks for posting....I will not use any other recipe ever.

A pumpkin pie recipe with molasses---YES!  This is how we do it in New England.  The temperature in this recipe is too high, though.  Bake the pie at 425 for only 15 minutes or so.  Then turn the oven down to 350 to finish the baking.  To know your pie is done, give it a little shake and the very center should jiggle a little, or take its temperature---should read about 175 degrees F.  The filling will still cook a little when removed from the oven.  If you wait until the center is totally set, it has overcooked.  You will get cracks, especially along the edges of the filling.

I was worried at first because it came out of the oven really jiggly but the knife came out clean and the crust was beginning to singe.  After sitting on the counter a bit and then being transferred to the fridge to cool and finish setting it thickened to satisfaction.  I haven't tried it yet (waiting for a potluck tomorrow morning) but judging from everyone else' reactions this should be good.  Just a note though, I've been using the puree from my halloween pumpkins (un-carved, they just chilled outside) and the 15 ounce can of premade can be substituted for slightly less than 2 cups of homemade puree. This will just about top out a 9" deep dish pie plate.

I love molasses! growing up ,I always thought that my grandma betty made the best pumpkin pie. I now realize that the only reason I liked it so much was because it was homemade and tasted better than the pies that you get from the store.

This was a great pumpkin pie, a little sweet because i used a strong molasses, but it was still a hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

I've not tried this precise recipe, but it's very similar to one I've used for years.  Very good, IMHO, though not to everyone's taste.  I recommend using 2 cups of FRESH pumpkin puree.  The fresh pumpkin and molasses give the pie a a more rustic texture and robust taste.

Very good.  I used baked and pureed butternut squash.....no one ever knows that it is not pumpkin.  I actually like the flavor of swuash better than pumpkin. I like the flavor of the molasses, but cut the amount in half, as some reviewers suggested.

This is so good. I didn't even use the molasses and use half cup of the evaporated milk. I ate the whole pie in three days. It's worth the extra time on the treadmill:-)

I loved the molasses in it, but something was missing. Maybe it needed a bit more sweetness? You know how you like to grab a plain slice of cold pumkin pie for breakfast (I do) and it's so good, well, this one was good with whipped cream for after dinner dessert but didn't have that "plain & still yummy" apeal. Yes on the molasses, but needs something else.

I've made this version with molasses all my life, my family doesn't consider it "real" without it.  The only things I add are 1/4 tsp each ground cloves and mace.  Fat Free or Low Fat eval milk works just as well and no one seems to notice the difference.

This is definitely heavy on the spices.  As written, the pumpkin flavor is masked by the cinnamon, ginger and molasses.  I used a 29 oz. can of pumpkin puree, only 1 Tbls. of molasses and 3/4 cup of dark brown sugar.  I thought these changes were nearly perfect.  However, my boyfriend said "it could use more spice".  Proof you can't please everyone!

This is a great basic recipe. Nice and spicy, with a creamy texture, and fills a deep dish pie generously.  Being out of brown sugar, I used white cane sugar (a scant cup), and pure Cane Syrup since I was also out of molasses. Cane syrup, what the British call "golden syrup" has a light molasses flavor. I also added a pinch of allspice and about a teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg. My husband said it's one of the best pumpkin pies he's had. Thanks for posting the recipe! :-)

If you want a very spicy pumpkin flavor, this is the recipe for it. The texture is very creamy, the molasses gives it a rich flavor. I prefer less spicy because this was a lot of ginger. I would go lighter on the molasses if I was going to do it again. Overall, good pie.

Followed the recipe exactly. It didn't set for me and I found it a bit bland. I'm sure someone could sift through the reviews and make the appropriate changes but I was looking to find a recipe that works as written.

This is a yummy and different pumpkin pie recipe with an old-fashioned flavor--the molasses gives it a distinctly different flavor without masking the pumpkin taste.

This pie was easy to make and delicious!! The only changes were subbing almond milk for evaporated (needed non dairy) and adding a dash of both cloves and nutmeg.

I loved the rich flavour of this pie. So far my favourite pumpkin pie recipe. 
I did use cream instead of evap milk because I didn't have any on hand, and I baked it at a lower temperature. My oven would have fried it to a crisp.

This pie is wonderful! I made it yesterday, and ate it today. I put some whipped cream on top, and it was amazing! Everyone loved it! It wasn't the prettiest looking pie, but it was the best tasting pie!

My 11yr old son has been wanting to make a pumpkin pie out of 1 of our remaining Halloween pumpkins on the steps for 3 wks. So he & Dad dug the insides out of one last night and baked it. We pureed it this morn. in a blender (he loved that) and this recipe was very easy for him to read and follow. I have never had a pumpkin pie from scratch b4 or one w/Molasses. We both love Molasses and it gives the pie a more vibrant flavor. It was a BIG HIT today, Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it and I can definately say it was the best pumpkin pie I have eaten!  So much tastier than an ordinary pumpkin pie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!-at any time you have the craveing =)
