A great recipe. The coriander and cumin seed really give the swordfish a unique taste. Be sure to properly "crush" the coriander and cumin seed to bring out the flavor. The relish is very tasty and colorful. I used a food processor for all of the chopping which resulted in a very even texture for the relish. I will use this for an elegant dinner party. Very, very easy to prepare.

This was very good.  A great idea to serve this fish with guacamole b/c the combo believe it or not does taste great and is very filling.  However, as far as the "Avocado Relish" part, I'm not super enthused that McCormick took a regular guacamole recipe, asked you to use their red pepper flakes and calls it "Avocado Relish".  While I do use McCormick spices, I do not use pepper flakes for guacamole, rather I stick with the original ingredient which is jalapegno peppers.

Excellent, quick recipe.  I used ground cumin and coriander and rubbed onto only one side of the fish.  I pan seared the fish spice side down for 1-2 minutes, then finished in the oven at 350 for about 18-20 minutes.  The relish goes great on the side and looks nice.  I tried leaving out the olive oil.  I didn't miss it at all and this cuts out most of the fat in the recipe.  I liked the 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper but some people may find this too spicy.

very quick, easy and delicious.  uses ingredients that are already around the house, so no special shopping.
i added a bit of chipotle pepper (in adobo sauce) in place of pepper flakes.  makes the relish stand out a bit more.  also, squeeze some lemon juice onto the swordfish to bring out the tastes!

I would give this a 5, but I am not one to give things a perfect score, so this gets a 4.9! I substituted ground coriander for the coriander seed, coarsely crushed and cummin powder instead of cuminn seed as well. I also used dried cilantro instead of fresh. Non of the substitutions adversley effected the meal, although, I am sure I may have made an exception to my perfect rule had I gone verbatim on the recipe. All in all, this was a GREAT quick meal, perfect for dinner parties as it is very filling and all could be preped well in advance. Try it, you'll like it.

I really liked the avocado relish on its own (it would make an awesome dip), and the coriander and cumin complimented the fish well (I used tuna). However, I didn't like them together - there was just too many different flavors and textures going on. Thanks, anyway.

This is absolutely outstanding. The cumin and coriander, as well as the avocado relish are  perfect complements to swordfish. I've also tried this with mahi-mahi with equally good results. I've cooked it on both the outdoor grill and on a Foreman grill, and it came out perfectly both times. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

This was exceptional - used a hammer and plastic bag to crush herbs.  Used shark instead of swordfish (cause thats what was available)and grilled.  B/F said this would cost $30 a plate out.  Served with grilled asparagus wrapped in bacon.
