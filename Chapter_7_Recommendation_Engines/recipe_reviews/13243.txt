I thought I would try something totally different for the first time, and I picked this recipe. It was absolutely wonderful!! The flavor was fabulous and Rutabega's are not on my hate list anymore. Please give this recipe a try, you will like it!

When made with a can of tomato juice instead of the water, this is AMAZING. I've made it several times. I use a bag of coleslaw mix instead of grating cabbage. So convenient!

After reading the reviews I added extra herbs, V8 juice and some chicken soup base.  It was definitely not bland.  I thought it was delicious and healthy and plan to make it often.

Very easy and tasty recipe. It was a little bland at first, but adding salt and pepper spiced it up very nicely.

Whoever said this recipe makes 6 to 8 servings must have been joking.  It nearly filled my 5 quart dutch oven!  I also thought it was odd that this recipe didn't call for any salt or pepper.  I added some anyway, but it didn't help much.  It was still pretty bland.  I won't make this one again!

I think it may taste better as left overs. Flavor was not as bland as I had expected, but 4.5 stars is a little for a bunch of vegetables in a pot.

Oddly enough, we liked this dinner.  It didn't smell the best while cooking but it tasted good.  I did add my spices to our preference but otherwise followed the recipe.

Don't be put off by the 'interesting' combination of ingredients. It was pretty tasty, and very filling. I did add worcestershire, salt, pepper, and grill seasoning, as well as a little more ketchup and less water.  This was a great way to use up our farm share this week. Makes enough to feed about 10 though.

I was worried about flavor before reading the other reviews, and subbed beef stock for most of the water, and seasoned with black pepper and garlic salt in my bowl. I was really surprised by the flavor the ketchup gave it! I will make again, it is a solid base and the cook times are right.
