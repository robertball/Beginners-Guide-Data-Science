I am an adventerous cook and love all kinds of food, however, my wife and 6 year old daughter are only "somewhat" adventerous when it comes to what she will try and eat, and my 2 year old son wants food to be simple and common.  
My kids and wife loved these pancakes.  
They were moist and delicious.  One thing that was different from regular pancake recipes is that these were to be cooked on a medium hot griddle rather than a hot griddle.  
The one star review is really unjustified, she must have experienced some problem.  I cannot imagine serving these to someone who would not like them, unless they didn't like peanut butter.  I can imagine that these would be a popular restuarant item. Very delicious.

I'm not picky, but these were not good and not one of my four kids would eat them.

My son who only eats things with peanut butter on them, usually spreads it on the pancake and then adds syrup. Now he can just add the syrup. It was a hit because he asked for another pancake...that never happens.

My two girls love these pancakes.  We often make a double batch and freeze them for later use.  They are really yummy with mini morsels sprinkled on top.

A very nice recipe.  It takes a bit of armwork to get the peanut butter evenly spread, though.  The peanut flavour isn't too strong, but just nice.  Definitely make the honey butter, once people tried it as a topping they ignored the normal maple syrup.

These were awesome!  I used crunchy peanut butter (that is our fave)  and I even added 1/2 cup the next time my granddaughter and I made these, they are wonderful!!  We like them with a little butter, and jam.  Even good leftover as a snack!

Very easy to make and were simply wonderful. My children devoured them and they preferred them without the honey butter, so next time I'll skip that step. But I will definitely make these again.

Tasted ok but personally I like plain pankcakes with melted pb and syrup on top much better.
