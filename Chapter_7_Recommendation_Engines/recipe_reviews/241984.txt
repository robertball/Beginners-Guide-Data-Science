All I can say is....Oh, my GOODNESS!!!   this was phenomenal.   I don't even like French toast but I can't wait to make this again.  ALL 9 people loved this in my house- My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe.

I left out the corn syrup and used 1 1/4 cup of pecans because I needed to use them up. I made it for an 80th Birthday Brunch and it was fabulous! YES I would DEFINITELY make this again..and again...and again.... :) DaniellaVictoria YOU are a ROCK STAR!!

This was a big hit at my house. I decided to try the recipe as written before I made any changes. The Praline topping was buttery, crunchy and yes a little sweet but I was very satisfied. For sure this will make an appearance on my table again.

AMAZING! But there's way too much eggwash... I forgot to add the milk last time I made it and it still came out delicious! just be careful to not overlap too much or it ends up soggy.

Big hit!! This is a wonderful breakfast dish, very easy and wows our guests. We use homemade bread from our bread maker and it works just as well (we cut the slices about an inch thick). Also, I have had great success with shorter soak time, 2 hours in the fridge has gotten great results. I discovered this like most, because I failed to really read the recipe before a brunch and had to compress the prep. No syrup necessary, we serve with cut fresh strawberries and blueberries.

I was very excited to try this, however I was very disappointed. The toast never cooked all the way and was soggy and cooking time took much longer than stated and I have a brand new oven! Bummer but won't try again.

This was a crowd please for sure! Only adjustment I made was using almonds instead of pecans. Prep was easy and didn't take long. I didn't leave time for the dish to set for 8 hours, but was delicious all the same. I will definitely be making this one again!

Very easy to make.  Great recipe for a brunch.  It was a little too heavy for my liking and a bit sweet.

Lots of leftover egg wash and I think if I had poured it on top it would be too soggy. The flavor was fantastic.

This recipe was wonderful just how it was posted.  I made it for Christmas morning and it was a huge hit with everyone.  I didn’t read the directions carefully enough the first time and did not layer the cinnamon mixture with the bread mixture.  Instead, I poured the whole cinnamon mixture on top.  It actually worked out, as the sugary mixture became really sticky-yummy-gooey after cooking and I think it would’ve been very difficult to get it out of the pan. This recipe will be our new holiday morning go-to!

Very fluffy, and great for easy breakfast on a busy weekend.I used leftover generic raisin bread, which had no taste to begin with and turned it into a flavourful breakfast casserole.

Did not add the 10X sugar before serving as it was sweet enough. Very good. I made it twice and got rave reviews at both venues.

Very disappointed - I made it for Christmas breakfast.  I do not recommend overlapping the bread as the inside was still mushy.  If I had baked it longer, the outside would have been overdone.  It was a lot of work for a so-so recipe.  Clean up was difficult.  I would have been better off making regular French toast and adding a special topping.  I do not recommend.
I will go back to making my cinnamon pecan rolls next year!

This is absolutely delicious! This is just a little too much nutmeg, so I'll cut it in half next time (but just a personal preference).

Excellent and quick to make. I didn't have corn syrup and used maple syrup instead. I also omitted the refined sugar. The toasted pecans elevates this dish to a delicious start.

What a hit. The best ever, and quite easy to make. I made this recipe 4time so far and everyone enjoyed very much and most of them asked me for the recipe. Will make it again and again. I made them as written exeept cooking was extended to 49 minutes so that the tip of bread slices caramelise a little bit on the top.

I chose to make a lighter version of this breakfast casserole by using 2 % milk for liquid and half the amount of the topping.
I used French baguette because I had one and it needed to be used. Now, after soaking the bread for few minutes and then arranging in the pan, I had about a cup of the milk mixture left in the bowl ! I just don't like wasting.. I spooned about a tablespoon of it over each piece of bread. That might have been a mistake cause the casserole had a mushy, scramble egg like bottom. It still tasted good and plenty sweet for my family.

This recipe was very good! I didn't put the praline topping on because not everyone liked nuts...however I would have loved to try it because it sounds delicious and I love nuts. However, it was still very good! Definitely would make again...this time with the praline!

Let me start out by saying that this breakfast is really outstanding.  When I first tried it I thought it was really good, although my husband kept talking about how his own traditional recipe for french toast was "even better and much easier to prepare".  I was worried that he didn't like it and wouldn't want to eat all the leftovers.  Cause let me tell you, this recipe makes a lot.  I froze individual servings and would put them in the fridge the night before to thaw, then send them with him to work and would get a call later about how it was "actually really delicious".  I in fact, got a little giddy every time that I pulled out a slice for myself.  It was amazing to pop it in the microwave and add a little syrup.  It was like heaven in 20-30 seconds!  The only problem (although not really a problem) is that it made a lot of the liquid to dip the french bread in.  Like double the amount you need for a standard french bread.  Not wanting to throw it away we grabbed a loaf of white bread and dipped about 10 slices to use the rest of it up.  We liked the french bread a tad better than the plain white bread but both work great.  I am looking forward to the next time that I get to make this!

Great brunch recipe.  I used white Texas toast instead  and Splenda in place of sugar. Everyone loved it!
