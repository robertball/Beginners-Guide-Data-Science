OMG! Great twist on regular 'ol grilled ham and cheese! I love the italian spin on this classic. I used a smoked ham and a combination of Parmesan and Romano cheeses because who can really decide between the two! I added a little minced garlic to some Hellman's light mayo and my husband was in sandwich Heaven.... Great recipe!

Loved this sandwich!!!!  I did make minor changes...used french bread, my jarred roasted red peppers were in water and not oil.  My condiment of choice was the Creamy Italian Dressing II.  Also I grated italian seasoning on the outside of the bread with the parmesan cheese before grilling.  I will be making this sandwich again soon!

Try mixing basil pesto with the mayo.  It makes for a delicious combination with the the provolone and red peppers.  Awesome sandwich!

Hubby and I loved them.  I had honey turkey so I used that.  The only issue I had was the parmesan cheese, it burnt instantly.  Other than that, great recipe.  Next time I will use a pannini bread.

Thanks for a delicious sandwich idea!!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, I just didn't measure the butter, mayo or parm.  I spread a very thin layer of butter on as directed, but only put mayo on one side.  Used some yummy multi-grain sourdough.  I decided to bake these in the oven at 410 degrees for 8 minutes on one side, then I flipped and did about 3 minutes on the other.  They still tasted and looked like they had been grilled.  The parm was a very nice touch.

I spent a week trying out several grilled deli meat sandwiches and this was the overall favorite.  The great taste and ease  of preparation makes it a winner. Because I have picky kids who wouldn't touch a red pepper, let alone eat one, I blended the roasted red pepper in with the mayonaise with a handmixer. It's now a part of my lineup of recipes and I appreciate the author of this recipe.  Thanks a bunch!

Very Good! I used black angus roast beef instead of ham ....also sliced thinly and i used a very hearty grainy bread too. I added a dash of both salt & pepper on top of the roast beef. Next time i will use a touch of horsradish mixed in with the mayo to give it a bit of a kick.

Really tasty and easy.  If you heat the slices of meat in the pan and then insert them into the sandwich, it helps to melt the cheese inside.  I put the Parmesan inside instead of outside and added some red pepper flakes for zip to some of the sandwiches.

Totally delish. I've found it's less messy and less likely to burn if you mix the parmesan with the butter before spreading it on. Make sure to cook over medium heat or lower; Give the heat time to penetrate all the layers before the cheese burns.

This is a wonderful sandwich. My husband said it was the best sandwich he ever had! It was really easy to make! I like to deconstruct it and feed the pieces to my son! He loves the red pepper!

This was a pretty good sandwich recipe... I used turkey instead of ham.  I think next time I will add some spinach.

Thank you for this idea! I used all of the key ingredients, cheese, ham and red pepper. But I made it lower cal by using a toasted english muffin and no butter. I'm sure it's excellent just how the recipe is.

Hubs had a meeting the other night, so I was on my own for dinner.  I decided to use some leftover ham from Easter that I had in the freezer, and I had everything else I needed, so I selected this recipe.  I deviated just a little, by serving the mayonnaise on the side, rather than putting it in the sandwich.  I also used roasted red peppers packed in water, drained very well on paper towels.  Other than that I followed the recipe, with the exception of forgetting to add the Parmesan cheese.  I guess I was anxious to sit down and eat this sandwich!  It was very good with a nice combination of flavors.  I like the idea of adding a little basil pesto to this.  I think I’ll try that next time!

This is delicious and such a great twist on a grilled cheese sandwich. I mixed a little basil pesto in with mayo and used that for my condiment. I opted not to sprinkle the parmesan on the outside of the sandwich, but that was the only change I made. This is a great dinner option when you're pressed for time, but want something a bit fancier than plain grilled cheese. Thanks for sharing!

This sandwich is FANTASTIC!  My favorite of all time!  I think it should be made just as it's written (though my peppers were packed in water, not oil).  The flavors blend together perfectly.  Thanks for the great sandwich. We ate it with roasted red pepper soup, and I couldn't get enough.

Wow Lori; what a sandwich!!!! You guys just keep coming up with great ways of making a simple food taste totally extraordinary. Parm on the outside of the bread is ingenious. I cook Tilapia that way, so why couldn't I think of this? Thank you so, so much!!!!

This was a wonderful sandwich. I used potato bread instead, but it was still tasty. Made it as a Father's Day Lunch sandwich and my fiance enjoyed it!

This sandwich is AMAZING!  It tastes like I just made a restaurant quality dish!  It's so super easy too.  I'm in Europe so I used fresh wheat bread from the bakery and a slice of gouda cheese instead of provolone I think it was...it's SO SO good- my friend who I cook for sometimes also agreed that it was awesome and said he definitely would have kept eating more!

Very good and easy to make.  Only suggestion is to dry the red peppers a little in paper towel prior to adding them to your sandwich.

Bland. The only change I made was to use french bread instead of sourdough because I make my own bread & don't have a sourdough starter. I don't know what it was- maybe my deli counter ham was bland. Had it one night with mayo & another night with mayo topped with a little bit of horseradish- better the second time. I bet mayo mixed with horseradish would be good. I made on the George Forman grill. I won't be making this again.

Used a garlic herb bread instead of sourdough because that's what I had on hand.  Omitted mayo, butter (bread was oily enough).  Layered cheese, ham, and pepper on bread, sprinkled parm cheese on top. Toasted in the oven at 375 for approx. 6-8 minutes until the cheese and bread were toasty.  Served with fresh snap peas as a side.

This sandwich was tasty.  I took some advice and patted down the peppers.  I also used a regular roll from the bakery instead of the sourdough bread and I heated my pan to low/medium so that I would not burn the cheese.  All and all it was a success.  Next time though, I will probably use a little less pepper.

Yum, what a tasty sandwich! I didn't use the parmesan cheese, but I don't think that makes much of a difference. I was also surprised that just one was pretty darn filling, which is nice because normally I have to eat two grilled cheeses before I feel full. Normally I don't have the ingredients on hand (the roasted red peppers, the provolone, sourdough bread), so this won't become a staple in my house,  but it was nice to try something different. Thanks!

I believe this is the 5th day in a row that I have had this for lunch. I use lots of mayo on the inside, whatever bread I have on hand, and whatever cheese, though I do love munster or swiss. Do make sure you dry the peppers really well on paper towels before making this. I also love to add several fresh basil leaves or some fresh spinach leaves before grilling. I don't always use the parmesan, but I do grill it over medium low. Takes about 5 - 7 minutes per side and is a lovely golden color. YUM!! Great recipe Lori.

I'm not a big fan of sandwiches because I always find them so boring but this sandwich is far from boring, it's awesome!  The only changes I made was that I didn't use parmesan cheese and I made some chipotle mayo which I spread on the bread. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

Delicious! I had the roasted red peppers, but I couldn't open the jar! :) I did the bake in the oven method.  Helped the parm not burn. I baked 8 min on one side, then 3 on the other. 400 F oven.

I made sweet potato black pepper biscuits from allrecipes instead of using sourdough and I used Stonewall Maple Bacon aioli instead of mayo.  I wasn't a fan of the biscuits, but that is not the fault of this recipe so I'm going with five stars because otherwise it was delicious.

Really good.  My roasted red pepper jar was full of mold when I took it out of the fridge (UGH!) so we went without obviously.  But the sandwiches were great anyway and I will make these again for sure.  Other than the peppers and mixing the parmesan directly into the butter before using, I did everything else exactly as written. YUMMY!

This sandwich lends itself easily to variation. Red pepper/garlic mayo gives it a nice zing. Some people don't like or can't eat mayo, so I use a slice of pepper jack cheese instead. Since my sandwiches are cooked on a panini press, I can't put the cheese on the outside (it sticks). My favorite is bread, pepper jack cheese, ham, roasted red peppers, and a sprinkle of grated parmesan on top. Thanks for a great sandwich idea!

This was a nice simple sandwich that hubby kept saying how much he really liked it. I used a scalia bread which worked well. I melted the butted and spread it on with a brush and then sprinkled the parm cheeese on. The next time I would like to try a different spread than just mayo, maybe with some herbs mixed in. Thanks

Easy and quick to prepare. Youngest doesn't care for peppers so I left them out for him. Good for nights when oldest son has to attend school concert and we want something quick.

My husband liked this but I didn't, it was just too oily/greasy for me, also make sure you like all the flavors involved as lots of unusual flavors come together with this sandwich.  Easy to make though.

DH said this was the best sandwich I ever made!  It sure was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  Well, I did follow one reviewer's advice and patted dry the roasted red peppers, since they did come in olive oil.  Otherwise, don't mess with perfection with this recipe!!

I used rye bread, ham-off-the-bone, Swiss cheese, mayo on one side and mustard on the other. The peppers were a tasty surprise, and the parmesan cheese was crunchy and perfect. Way to go, Lori!! Thanks!!!!

Delicious sandwich. Very filling. My 28 year old brother who eats A LOT asked me to make extra because he was really hungry, but he could only eat one and a half. I don't think thats ever happened to him before! :)
