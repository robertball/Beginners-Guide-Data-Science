I hadn't had Molletes since I was a kid. Now I remember why I loved them so much. I used my own homemade refried beans and the addition of butter to the bolillo kicked it up a notch.  I loved them!  Thanks Jenny for bringing back a childhood favorite.

These were really good. I had never had them before, but I will be making them again. So easy! Yum, thanks for a great new recipe.

Oh heaven!! These were fantastic!! For the refried beans, I used my own  "hack" with canned refried beans--it's super quick and tastes like homemade refried beans from scratch. Because I add additional spices & some lime juice, I didn't add additional toppings to bhe bolillos.  So delicious, and I'm super happy with this Borden recipe. A+++++ quick lunch any day!

I give this only 2 stars because the title is misleading... ‘traditional’ molletes use Oaxaca cheese... easily found in Mexican Grocery stores (well, easy if you’re in the south!). If you can’t find Oaxaca cheese, then see if you can find the less melting cheese that’s more salty, crumbly, & in between feta & mozzarella called Cotija cheese. Cotija cheese is easier to find. Last resort to be‘traditional’ then follow the cheese in this...

This was super easy, fast, and everyone loved it.  I melted the butter and brushed it onto the bread (just to make my life easier).  I topped it with a dollop of sour cream -- SO GOOD!  It's great AS IS.

I love these! They are so easy to make, and so tasty! We make these often for a quick weeknight meal, and I usually serve them with extra fixings on the side, so everyone can add what they want to theirs (scallions, guacamole, salsa verde, etc).  Thank you for sharing your recipe Jenny! I hope that others will enjoy them as much as our family does.
