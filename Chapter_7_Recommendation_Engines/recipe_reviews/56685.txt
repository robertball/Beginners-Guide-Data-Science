This is the bomb!!!  I left out the peppers and onions and used bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix.  I also used half and half. Also, I chopped the squash and put it in the oven in the mixture without cooking it first and it was fine in 45 minutes.

The cream isn't necessary--milk works fine! I only had cherry tomatoes so I halved them and put them all across the top. It looked really pretty. This would be great to serve at Thanksgiving or Christmas.

It's nice to find something different to do with squash.  This was quite delicious and we will be making this again.  I made it  a little healthier by using crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs and evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream.  I also added steamed zucchini with the squash.

This was an interesting concocsion. I would make it again. I used butternut squash, a regular skinned/seeded tomato and yellow onion beacause this was what I had on hand. I think acorn squash would probably have made made this even better. It tasted alot better the second day when I warmed it up for lunch. The flavors seemed to have melded.

I only made this recipe to get rid of a bunch of extra summer squash my garden produced, but it was a surprise hit with everyone. We make it quite frequently now, especially for potluck dinners, and I can always rely on everyone to rave about it and ask for the recipe. I use a 50/50 mixture of Italian breadcrumbs and unflavored breadcrumbs instead of the stuffing mix. Great way to use up squash and zucchini!

This was really good!  It was much more interesting and less egg-y than I expected.
We made this using yellow squash and bread crumbs because that's what we had.  We only used about 1/2 cup bread crumbs (1/4 mixed in and 1/4 sprinkled on top).  We also used a few more spices and quite a bit more feta cheese.  YUM, I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty... savory rather than sweet.  My family love simple baked squash with butter, but get tired of the same dishes.  I did not have the stuffing mix or green onions, so I used bread crumbs and poultry seasoning with finely chopped onion.  Since I was grilling chicken, I put it in a greased cast iron skillet and set it on the grill beside the chicken.  It worked great!  My husband still prefers it baked with butter, but this recipes gives the rest of us some variety.  Will make again.

This was delicious!  I kind of had a hard time working with a raw squash... but there must be a trick I don't know about?  I will absolutely make this again!

I didn't have any stuffing mix, so I used fresh brench bread crumbs seasoned with sage and onion. It worked fine, and the dish turned out great. My husband and I love this one! Next time I might add a little more feta, just because we love the taste so much, but it was great with the amount stated.

This recipe is truly amazing!  Not only does it use up that acorn squash that you have no clue what to do with, it tastes absolutely amazing with the feta cheese and rosemary!  This is a great dish for vegetarians and it appeals to the meat eaters too.  A definite must that works throughout the year.

I followed this recipe exactly (except I used summer squash and I crushed seasoned croutons instead of stuffing).  Both my husband and I really, really enjoyed it!  If you slice the tomatoes very thinly, they become "dehydrated" on top of the casserole and their flavors intensify giving the dish a little "bite" that is *wonderful*.  We really love feta, so it was great use of the cheese (and fresh tomatoes) to amp up plain old boring summer squash.  Cooking the rosemary in the dish (and then removing) was also a great addition.  Chopping the rosemary and adding it to the dish would have been too much!  The rosemary flavor was great without being overpowering.  Wonderful side dish...fancy enough for company!!!

Only made two changes - subsituted 2% milk for the cream and used summer squash instead of acorn squash.  Hubby and I both LOVED this recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

This was so much better than we expected and my husband wants more!

I used 4 green onions and about 3/4 of a green pepper (I didn't measure it after it was chopped). I also softened the squash in the microwave for 9 minutes before I cubed it & mashed it instead of steaming it on the stove.
We were out of tomatoes, so we made it without those & it wasn't too bland.
I did omit the breadcrumbs because of the comments about it seeming dry, but next time I will try it with buttered cracker or bread crumbs.

We had this as a side dish for dinner last night and absolutely loved it.  I substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream and 1/2 tsp dried rosemary for the fresh, because that was what I had on hand.  Next time, this will be a vegetarian main dish supper for us!

I loved this recipe! The changes I made were only because I had to use what I had on hand in my kitchen, but I imagine it would be even better as written. I used pattypan squash, steamed as directed. I omitted the stuffing, as I have a gluten sensitivity, and I used shredded goat milk cheddar cheese instead of the Parmesan & feta.  I also had to use yellow onion, as I did not have the green.  At any rate, it was delicious!  Not a morsel left.  I will definitely use this again.

Awful lot of work for not much reward. The flavor wasn't outstanding. If we do it again which is doubtful, we'll use a whole acorn squash.

We very much enjoyed this recipe.  We made it exactly as directed with the exception of replacing goat cheese crumbles for feta.  It was a tasty combination and would work well for a Sunday brunch option.

Delicious!!  Used one full acorn squash, the entire green pepper, tossed in some extra green onions and probably too much cheese.  Used herbed stuffing.  I can't wait to make this as a holiday side dish!

Next time I will find a way to substitute the heavy cream :)

Felt it was missing something, but the tween liked it, so I will make it again - but add some herbs or heat or salt or something.  To me it just tasted like slightly sweet soggy bread....

I agree that this is a great variation on the old standard brown-sugar-and-cinnamon-and-butter squash recipes. I used half a red and half a green bell pepper, which made it even prettier. I used halved cherry tomatoes on the top and used more feta cheese. My boyfriend said he wished there was more squash, though, so next time I will use even more acorn squash. Thanks!

This was delicious.  I used a whole butternut squash as that's what I had on hand and doubled the recipe.  I cut it in half and baked it face side down for 1 hr at 375 so I could easily scoop out the squash without having to peel.  Instead of green onions, I used a yellow one.  And, instead of Roma tomatoes, I used grape tomatoes cut in half.  I did not use the rosemary but did add a pinch of oregano and basil to the mixture.  I used more feta cheese than it called for but am planning on using even more (3.5 oz) next time around.  I also substituted the heavy cream for nonfat milk to make it lighter.  My boyfriend, who's my toughest critic, came back for more despite not being a huge fan of butternut squash.  The 12 servings are almost gone now.  This recipe is one that I will definitely be making again.

This was AWESOME!  I didn't adjust anything, I did it exactly like the recipe called for.  I used an 8X8 dish, which seems "small" to me rather than "medium".  I got out a 7x11 at first...but I knew it would be too thin a layer.  When I make this again, I will probably use a little less of the stuffing.

I enjoyed it very much but my children and husband did not. Followed recipe through, just replaced the feta since my family is not that into it.  I have since found another squash casserole recipe on here that my family has all liked much better.

Yummy as a main dish! I substituted butternut squash, and didn't use peppercorns or green pepper ( think we might have also used yellow onions instead of green)... still tasted amazing-- as the look/consistency of a quiche. Would also would work great as a breakfast dish (We had it as leftovers the next morning.. our holiday guests loved it!) I am cooking it again tonight & will try it with the ingredients listed... I'm looking forward to it!

An absolutely delectable way to enjoy the bounty of a summer harvest.  Used 1 summer squash, 1 acorn squash.  Followed directions mostly except I used more feta on top along with goat cheese.  I also used yellow and red tomatoes and put them in rows on top.  Gorgeous. Completely gone, even gobbled up by four kids aged 7mos - 15 yrs.  I will take this to potlucks, and I will double the recipe when we have company.  Summer squash done up in ballgown - not your usual add a bit of sugar boredom.

I was fed up with sweet or "just butter" squash recipes when I found this one. Absolutely fantastic. Even my "squash hating" brother had several helpings.

I thought this was delicious.  I used skim milk instead of the cream with mine and it turned out to be really good.  I also cut the squash in half, put it into a bowl in the microwave with a little water and steamed it.  When i got it out it was so soft that i was just able to spoon the squash out of it.  I am definately making this one again.

So good. Sorry for this review because I changed it to fit what I had in the fridge.  I used two zucchini, one yellow one green sliced and cooked in water until soft. Smashed with potato smasher.  Added cream,eggs, parm cheese and crispy toasted white and dark rye bread small bread cubes, and salt/pepper.  Topped with sliced Roma tomatoes and feta, 1/2 tsp rosemary and onion salt. Cooked at 350 for 15 and on broil for 5. So delicious. Next time I will do a double recipe in a 13x9. The small Rye cubes really added to the amazing flavor.  Yummy

I liked this dish. Subbed red bell pepper, small dice, and didn't have green onions. I'll make sure to have them next time I make this. Proportions and timing were perfect.

I would make it again, I made it for 8 people as a vegetable side dish. I used  turkey boxed dressing. it will go into my recipe box for winter squash, rather than making a sweet vegetable dish.

took it to potluck with a bunch of gardeners.  everybody loved it and several asked for the recipe.  I did add garlic powder {I was out of fresh garlic] and used a mix of green and yellow onion.  I used chopped fresh rosemary leaves sprinkled across the top.

To make this low carb I used 1/2 cup crushed up pork rinds instead of bread crumbs. It makes a yummy breakfast lunch or dinner.

It's tasty. I used more tomatoes & Feta cheese. I had no green peppers so I substituted red bell peppers instead. It would be a great dish for a pot luck.

Even the kids ate it. Substituted milk for the cream, onion powder for the green onions, used Sage Stuffing mix, and 4-cheese Mexican shredded cheese instead of feta. Still tasted great - the tomato topping really sets it off.

This was so good and I will definitely make it again. It looked so pretty with the Rosemary sprig and tomatoes on top. I am looking forward to the leftovers today. My only suggestion would be to taste before adding salt. Some of the boxed stuffing mixes may contain enough salt for the entire dish although my husband thought the salt content was just fine so I guess that may be personal preference.

As much as I love interesting mixes of flavors, in the end, I just didn't care for this.  I served it at a fall dinner party as a side and friends reported that it was "ok" but not great.  My husband and I did not really want to finish the leftovers.

Not my favorite.  The sauce was not moist enough.  And the dish didn't have enough flavor (and I had added a lot of cayenne, paprika, and poultry seasoning, and pepper that the recipe didn't call for).

Only change was using goat cheese instead of feta: had a pretty good flavor.  Next time, I'll jazz up with a few spices to get a more robust flavor.

I made this for Thanksgiving, forgot to add the stuffing mix but everyone raved anyway!  Thanks for the yummy squash recipe!  I think you could use milk instead of cream to cut the fat and it would still be great.

Oh this is really good! I used crushed crutons instead of bread cumbs and it still turned out wonderful. Can't get enough!

I followed the recipe exactly & this was good, but not my favorite squash recipe.
