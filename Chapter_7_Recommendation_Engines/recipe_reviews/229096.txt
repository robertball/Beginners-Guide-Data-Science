I made this nearly as written, and according to my family, we have a "keeper."  I did not add the peas only because I didn't have them on hand, and I did substitute lower-fat cream cheese.  I subsituted 1/3 cup of the chicken broth with home made white wine because I wanted to use it up. I had chicken breasts on hand, and since we like white meat better, we would not use thighs. I think these changes were insignificant, however, to the overall flavor. This wasn't overly rich, and we liked the choices of herbs; it didn't have that "dried dressing mix" flavor of similar recipes.  There wasn't too much preparation, and it was easy. I will make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed the recipe pretty faithfully and I thought it was definitely good, but way too heavy on the herbs for me. The thyme and sage just completely overpowered any other flavor to this. I would recommend halving them or trying your own blend. And yes basically this comes out as chicken pot pie without the crust (that's what the biscuits are for) :)

The chicken dish iteself was very good.  I added a little sherry because our family likes the flavor.  But the biscuits were not something I would make again.
