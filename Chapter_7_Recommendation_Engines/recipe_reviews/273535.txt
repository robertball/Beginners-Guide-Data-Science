The only change I made was to the dressing amount. I used a heaping tablespoon of mayo (I did not use vegan mayo) and I really just eye-balled the Kraft Tuscan House Italian dressing amount until it looked like enough to coat my pasta and veggies. I mixed these two ingredients together in a separate bowl first. I think that 1 cup of each is WAY too much, in my opinion. You can always add more, if needed, but once you add it all, you can't take it away. Tasty cold salad for summer!
