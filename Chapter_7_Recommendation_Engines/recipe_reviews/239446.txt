This is an extremely easy recipe for a rich and fudgy basic brownie.  It's probably just as easy as a mix but you avoid that processed flavor.

I didn't have an appropriate skillet, so I baked in a glass pie pan.  I probably could have mixed it in the pie pan as well for a one-bowl brownie recipe.

These were easy to make!!!  They were nice and fudgy.  I cooked them in my 5in cast iron skillet for about 18 minutes.

I am no baker but this recipe is so easy that even I got rave reviews on it! The only thing I did different was leave out the vanilla extract, after reading some of the reviews where people said it gave the brownie a red velvet cake taste. The brownie came out perfect, and my wife is already asking when we are baking another. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This has to be the best recipe for brownies that I have had. I did not make any changes, and it has been eaten even quicker than other recipes I've made before. I wish this recipe was easier to find for everybody, because it's definitely a keeper!

I have some mini loaf cast iron pans.  I used these instead.  The recipe made 4 perfectly.  Because of the smaller pans, it took less time.  I checked them at 40 minutes and they were done.  Might have been able to pull them a minute or two sooner.
Delicious and really easy recipe.  Will definitely make again.

This is a perfect brownie recipe. I used a glass 8x8 pan because I don't have a skillet and I used 1 tsp of Mexican vanilla bean because that's all I had. I did the recipe exactly as it said and it was perfect!

I combined initial ingredients, then added flour, then eggs - not exactly in the order listed, but it still worked.

Flawless! The perfect mix of chewy and chocolate richness (but not over the top). Mild adjustments follow.

I measured the ingredients by weight, not volume and used bread flour instead of AP. I also added about a third teaspoon of espresso grounds (not instant, just straight up espresso coffee) and a small pinch of salt.

I cooked in a cast iron wedge shaped pan, which gives perfect edges all around. The extra batter, I cooked in a separate small pan.

I used the convection oven at 325 degrees and about 25 minutes

I used Special Dark cocoa powder. The batter was insanely chocolatey and delicious.. till I added the vanilla. Then it tasted more like red velvet to me. Next time I'll skip the vanilla. This time I'll give 'em to the kids and call them "Black Velvet Brownies". Either way, one bowl rocks.

3 29 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/239446/uncle-drews-skillet-brownies/ ... Next time, I'll try 3 eggs; this time, I went with 2.  It seemed a T of vanilla was a lot so I used a t. Added a half t salt.   Two eggs may - & do mean "may," - be too fudgy, but I don't knowww.  They're goood!  :D  I baked these in too small of a glass dish so they were a big overdone on the edges & sides, but still good, just more chewy.  These had a shiny top, but not the expected thin, papery layer.  This is in the lead for favorite brownie without special additions like cream cheese, etc.  I made these & deepdish the same time.   Deepdish looks & tastes more cakelike.
