I'm from SoCal and I love to take advantages of the fabulous local avocados we have here - so, if you post a Guacamole recipe, chances are I'm going to try it.  I thought this was right on with spice and quantity of ingredients.  The only thing missing IMHO is salt.

Absolutely fantatstic!! Made a half batch and it didn't last the evening with my family. I found it was a little better with a little less onion and a little more tomatoes and habanero. Even with the extra habanero it still wasn't too hot but had a very satisfying hint of heat and that extra something special. Can't wait to make this again!
