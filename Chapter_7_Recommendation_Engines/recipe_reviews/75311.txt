I was not happy with this salad. There was so much oil that when i took a bite, my lips were greasy! I would recommend cuting out the oil completely as it really doesnt need it at all.  If you see my picture, you can see the salad swimming in the oil.

Made this last night with bbq pork loin rack on grill. Didn't have a few ingredients: Cayenne, so used Hungarian Hot Paprika, fresh corn, so used canned, instead of vinegar & olive oil, used dressing, used canned diced tomatoes. Everyone loved it. Thanks for making my boring corn a little more exciting.

This was surprisingly good!  I was amazed that my family liked it.  I thought they wouldn't be too crazy about the heavyhandedness of the basalmic vinegar.  I think the key to making this salad work well is to use only the best farm-fresh vegetables and to mix the minced garlic, basalmic vinegar and olive oil well before mixing it with the vegetables.  I used a green pepper as I didn't have a red one.  I definitely will make this recipe again - especially when I have an excess bounty of fresh corn on the cob.

The first time I made this I had to drain the oil and vinegar from the salad.  The next time I used 2 T of each.  This time I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 cup each of the oil and vinegar.  This seems to be the perfect amount and the salad has been a big hit at gatherings.

My husband loved this dish.  I cut down on the oil and vinegar for this recipe.  I only used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and still strained it out of the salad before serving so it wouldn't be so oily.  Delicious!

This was a delicious way to use up left over corn on the cob. It could be mistaken for a relish! Next time I would ease up on the onion! I served it with grilled sausage and it was a great combo.

Nice little summer salad. Added a bit of sugar and left out the tomato. Used fresh ears of white corn.

I thought this was very good.  If you use a more expensive balsamic vinegar, the taste is so much better.  I reduced the oil slightly.  Thanks for sharing!

What a hit with my dinner guests!  I served this with crab cakes and coleslaw, and we had a perfect summer supper.  I, too, reduced the oil significantly, and added some ground sea salt, but otherwise I just followed this as written. Thank you for a new addition to my tried-and-true recipes!!

We loved it added lime and garlic salt. Pulled back on the liquid volume, so to not float in juice.

We loved this and it's so unique.  I did follow the reviews to cut back on the balsamic and oil to 2 tbs each and that was perfect for me, but that's just me. I'd give it 5 stars, but I think I'd like to add something green next time, even if it's just parsley.  But I'll be making this oftem. Thanks!

I've made this recipe a few times as is and with modifications. Agree that the quantity of dressing seems to be a bit much, but it is easy to adjust.The flavor is outstanding and the recipe is so simple and economical. I've made it with frozen corn, green pepper, even diced canned tomatoes in a pinch.  Additions have included 1 can of rinsed black beans and 1 cup of cooked quinoa. I really like the quinoa modification, makes a nice vegan main dish. Perfect for warm weather.  It has been a staple in our house in one form or another this summer. Thanks for sharing.

This type of salad is easily modified - I used four ears of corn, a pepper from the garden that was an odd color (in between green and red) half a vidalia onion, four medium tomatoes, ground black pepper and a handful of chopped fresh basil. I cut back on the olive oil and balsamic, maybe only 3 tablespoons each, if that, and completely forgot the garlic even though I intended to put in some crushed. It went over quite well with my family, even Granny who was tentative - she had two helpings.

Needs something else, probably a little salt.
