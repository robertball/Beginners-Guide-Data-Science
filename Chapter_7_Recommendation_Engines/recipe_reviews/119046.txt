OH my gosh, this is so good! Maybe the best ever. I replaced the water and vanilla with amaretto one time, raspberry liquor another (I prefer the amaretto, served with raspberries and a little bit of whipped cream on top). I also served in martini glasses, and in phyllo cups (formed in muffin tins). Each worked well. Creamy but not heavy, light but not too fluffy. Just smooth. Friends Raved!

This was good, but not incredible like I expected. I think I'm looking for a mousse with more eggs. This tasted like chocolate whipped cream. Very good, but not that "mousse" flavor.

This recipe was incredibly easy and delicious! I had to double the recipe to have enough for four, and I put it on top of dark chocolate cake topped with sweetened fresh whipping cream, and chopped almonds. I could not wipe the grin from my hubby's face!

My sister loved it. =D This is a great recipe, no raw eggs, alcohol, butter or an obscene amount of sugar. I did halve the vanilla though. And no disgusting eggy taste! Halve the amount of whipped cream, add a little gelatin, and it'll be less like chocolate whipped cream.

Amazingly tasty! This recipe is simple and healthy without adding any butter or other complicated ingredients.     However, I personally find a little sweet and shall you omit the usage of sugar if you aren't a too-sweet-tooth indiv. Also, instead of fridging it for 2hrs, put it overnight so that it would be solidified.    As an overall, this is a great recipe for real beginners to practise on!

So simple and good! My husband made it for me for a special dinner and I have been having him make for me since. If you keep it in the fridge over night I find that it becomes a little thicker and less whipped creamy.  We make them in 4 small ramekins and top with whipped cream.

Very simple and rich. My family inhaled it. It is a tad bitter - like dark chocolate and my boys would have preferred more of a milk chocolate taste. Next time I will use milk chocolate chips.

Yum!  Great anniversary dessert. The first time I have tried to make Mousse from scratch.  I doubled the recipe and it filled three normal sized wine glasses.  My husband loved it and thought it was excellent.  I also made some chocolate covered strawberries like the picture and it went well together.  This recipe was very easy to make too.

I made this exactly as written. It is good, but not great. It is definitely missing some egg yolk. It was easy to prepare, and suitable for an after dinner treat.

This was a great recipe that was easy to make; it was light and airy and had a very rich chocolate flavor; I gave it one less star as the chocolate flavor was almost too much.

Just made it! Increased the serving to 12, but only added 1 TB of vanilla, instead of the recommended 3! It hasn't been refrigerated it yet, but it is already AMAZING!!! So excited to share with family and friends at my husband's birthday party tonight. Thanks!

I kept all the ingredients the same, except for the whipping cream and vanilla. I used 1 cup of cream and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla. It was still sweet enough, and absolutely divine!! I did whip the cream till it was pretty stiff, because once you add the chocolate, it softens it up a bit, but refrigerated it all night and the consistency was perfect! I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe- easy and tastes so good! It's best to kind of over-whip the cream till it's really stiff, folding in the chocolate flattens it a bit. The nice thing about this is if you are entertaining, it's just a few minutes out of your day way before you begin cooking; then throw it in the fridge and you have a great homemade dessert ready to go.

It was delicious! I used bailey's irish cream instead of vanilla extract. I loved the taste of it! It's definitely only enough for two people.

Very easy chocolate mousse, also very delicious.  When my friend and I make this and don't want to wait for two hours for it to chill, we stick it in the freezer for about 20 minutes.  Tastes great with crepes!

Oh my goodness this was tasty.  So simple, if I had known sooner mousse could be this easy I would have been making all the time.  Next batch I will mix in mint flavouring (or mint booze) to take it up a notch.

kids like this. I used milk and not water with melting the chocolate. I have worked with chocolate a good bit and have never used water to thin it....does not mix well with the chocolate oils.

I love this recipe!  I put 1/3 cup semisweet chips instead of 1/4 which makes it a little richer.  Great recipe though:)

Quick, easy and very tasty. Made this for Valentines day to rave reviews. I doubled the recipe, used Kalhula instead of water and used only 1/2 the sugar....still was plenty sweet. When I combined the whip cream with chocolate I used the mixer to beat together to incorporate air....worked nicely. Served in parfait glasses with chocolate cookie crumbs on bottom and sprinkled on top and a drizzled Kalhula to finish off.

With changes: 5 stars!  I used 3 squares of semisweet chocolate and turned the tbsp of water into espresso.  I also beat the egg white from the egg until soft peaks, then added a small pinch of tartar.  I folded the cooled chocolate mixture into the egg white mixture, then folded that into the whipped cream mixture. Yum!

So good and easy!  Doesn't make too much though. I doubled the recipe for 4 people but should have tripled it.

I really loved this recipe! instead of water i used about 1/4 cup of milk witch made it really creamy. I par-boiled it so it wouldn't burn easily. If you think the batter i mediocre before you put it in the fridge don't worry it is much better once it is cooled down for a while. I find it is crucial not to burn the chocolate. if you don't have whipping cream whipped cream should do fine.

My husband loves chocolate and wanted a light and fluffy dessert for Thanksgiving. This recipe is so easy and yummy!  I doubled the recipe and it filled 4 martini glasses. I served it with whipped cream on top drizzled with chocolate. It looked like it came out of a restaurant. My guests thought I bought them.

Always chill the bowl and mixers for at least 20 minutes before beating whipping cream! It peaks faster and prevents whipped cream from "melting" as quickly! Great recipe!

Very good recipe! It was nice and fluffy.  I didn't try the mousse, I made it for a friends birthday. But she said it was delicious. I used it for a mousse pie, with a graham cracker crust. 

I gave it 4 stars because i replaced water with milk, and I added the vanilla to the whipping cream, and not the chocoalte mixture.

This was excellent! I absolutely loved it.  I used this as a cake filling but could easily be served as dessert alone with some cool whip and shaved chocolate.  The only thing I did wrong was I didn't beat the cream long enough and it was a little running.  It still tasted AMAZING!!!

Quick and easy to make; the results are fantastic.  Once it sets up, it's firm and smooth; not too sweet.  "The best mousse I've ever had" was one comment I got.

This was spectacular!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  Rich, decadent, not too sweet, and it is so great that there are no raw eggs.  Thank you also to other reviewers for the reminder to chill the bowl and beaters beforewhipping the cream.  I'll be making this again for sure!

I made this recipe for some out of town guests last night.  It was delicious!  I wasn't able to finish mine and my husband who doesn't usually like sweets took my bowl and finished it!  That says how delicious it is!  I changed it a bit, I used half dark chocolate chips and half semi sweet and it worked well for us.  It is a SUPER easy recipe and delicious to boot!

Super easy, outstanding recipe! Doubled the recipe to serve 4.  Only change I made was to add a little coffee extract, but not necessary.  Very rich...could see many young kids liking it even better with milk chocolate chips.

Very rich, and easy to make. It didn't quite whip up the way it should have, but that is my fault I guess. I am pregnant and cannot eat it, but I made it for my husband, and he said it needed to be fluffier, and that it was a little too rich. But he did enjoy it. Thank you for the recipe.

I am in love! This was really easy and fast. I used sugar-free semi sweet chocolate chips as well as using Splenda in the whipping cream. This mousse is my new favorite!!!

This is a great recipe, I know because I screwed it up royaly and it still turned out!  I forgot the water and used a whole egg by accident.  I will make again correctly and I'm sure it will be even yummier.

My sister had her wisdom teeth removed Friday so I found this recipe while looking for something soft to make her to eat in addition to the mashed potatoes I had made.  This was a HIT!  She loved it and asked me for the recipe so she could send her husband to the store to buy the ingredients to make it again.  I tasted it also and it was great!  So simple too!  One tip - double or triple the recipe.  1 recipe makes 2 small servings.  2 recipes makes 2 large servings.  When I make it for my family of 4, I'll probably triple the recipe to give everyone enough to have 1 serving.

YUM! My husband will not stop talking about how good this mousse is, and considering this was my first time making mousse I was quite pleased with this result! However I did alter the recipe since we are chocolate lovers...I doubled the chocolate/egg mixture to get a much richer tasting mousse.

I have had this recipe in my allrecipes box forever and use it constantly. I make some cakes and deserts that are quite complicated but this is simple and is by far my wife's favorite thing. 

The wife LOVES Dove chocolate, so I always make it with that. Sometime, half dark chocolate (w/ less sugar) layered with milk choclate, or sometimes milk chocolate only, but with a raspberry coulis at the bottom of the glass...

The recipe itself was good. The taste was too chocolatey and boring though. Next time I will add some Irish cream, or orange liquer, or some sour cherries on top.

I followed the recipe exactly - so I dont know if maybe the whipping cream was old or what. Looked pretty, tasted BAD.  If Im bored some time, I may try it again and see if it turns out better.

Delicious, though not as fluffy as I expected.  I also mistakenly use 2/3 cup whipping cream instead of 1/2, so maybe this was the problem, I'm not sure.  Overall, very good and I will probably make this again.  I also used 3 baker's chocolate squares and it gave it a perfect darker-chocolate flavor.

I used Merkins dark chocolate wafers to make this mousse and my guests raved about it!  The recipe is very simple to make and delicious!  I make it before I start cooking dinner so that it has time to chill before I serve it.

I used ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate and used this as a crepe filling.  Absolutely delicious.  Those who say it was chocolate whipped cream did something wrong.  This is a thick, rich mousse that is simple to make.

I thought for a fast mousse, this was very good. The amount was perfect to fit into small bite-size phyllo cups. I topped them with a dusting of powdered sugar and a raspberry.   Looked and tasted perfect!

OMG this was so good. I gave it a 4 because I did make a couple of adjustments.  I wanted enough to use as a filling for a mousse pie, so I increased it to 10 servings.  I only used half the # of egg yolks that called for, and instead of water, I used half amarreto and half 2% milk. Perfect.

Delicious recipe! I live in Holland where chocolate chips are hard to find and overly expensive, so I substituted them with some chopped up chocolate bar (half from a milk chocolate one & half from a dark). It was perfect! I added a few dark chocolate chunks to the top for decoration & it was very well received.

Very easy to make. Used Gran Marnier instead of water and vanilla and dark chocolate chips. The chips did not melt as creamy as I would have liked, but it actually gave the dessert an interesting texture. Cannot wait to make again. Next time will make a white chocolate and the dark and layer them.

This was a delicious recipe, but I agreed with another reviewer that it didn't have the body of what I expect from mousse.  It was more like chocolate whipped cream with some extra oomph.  It's still going into my recipe collection because it's a fabulous dessert and just a little lighter than regular mousse.

This came out pretty good.  After I made it, I kinda felt like it was just chocolate whipped cream, like another reviewer said.. but after I refrigerated it, it became a little more set and a little thicker.  I added raspberry liqueur instead of water, (and added a little more than the recipe called for) and folded in fresh raspberries.  I topped it with some chocolate shavings.

I've made this a couple times now but didn't rate the first time.  It's a very simple and yummy tasting mousse.

I doubled the recipe, but only added 1 T powdered sugar to the heavy whipping cream.  I always use powdered sugar for my strawberry shortcake whipping cream, so I thought it would go perfect here as well.

I serve with raspberries!

This was really good, although I believe I need to work on my technique.  I had a few small lumps of chocolate in my final product, which I think is because my stirring could have been better when melting down the chocolate and water.  I should really have used a whisk rather than a spoon I think.  I served this with fresh raspberries on top and it was a hit.
