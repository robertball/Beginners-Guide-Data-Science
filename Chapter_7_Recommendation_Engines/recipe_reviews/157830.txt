This basic recipe ends up too vinegary and rubbery. I took the base ingredients and tweaked the steps to make a better dish.

- Marinate Chicken in 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar and 1 T low sodium soy sauce, salt, pepper. Grill, pan fry, or bake - however you prefer your chicken. 
- Make a sweet potato mash with salt and pepper, and 1 t of brown sugar. 
- Make a balsamic reduction of 1/2 cup vinegar (or more if you want to batch). I like to add 1 T of butter and 1 t of brown sugar to my reduction. 
- Lay your cooked chicken on top of the sweet potato mash, and lightly drizzle with your reduction. Tasty!

the easiest way to make balsamic chicken is to use the first half cup as an overnight marinade, then bake the chicken (or grill it) then return pour the other half cup to serve. It is especially wonderful cold the next day and cut up into a salad. As for this recipe, baking chicken breasts at 400 covered for 40 minutes is way too much time. The breasts will stew or be rubbery, sometimes both. Easier to pan fry covered about ten minutes on each side with a medium to low flame.

My husband loved it!  Chicken was sooo tender and flavorful.  I put brown sugar and soy sauce into balsamic vinegar. I only baked chicken for 30 min and kept heat on 400.  I also used regular potatoes because I didn't have sweet potatoes and served plain broccoli as a side.  I will definitely make this again!

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and didn't cook the chicken for quite so long - maybe more like 30 min.  Also, I added a little paprika to the chicken and rosemary & thyme to the potatoes.  Really tasty and really easy!

This recipe was very quick and easy.  I sauted chopped onions and browned the seasoned chicken.  I also added pineapple apricot preserves to the balsamic vinegar, then reduced the sauce.  I omitted the sweet potatoes.  It was very yummy!

We really liked this recipe it's quick and very healthy.  As suggested by another person, I could leave the chicken in balsamic vinegar for longer. To make the sweet potatoes crispy it needs to be cooked in  a metal baking tray. I served it with  steamed vegetables.

This was an okay duo of dishes.  I used pork chops instead of chicken breasts.  If you really like balsamic vinegar, you'll like the meat.  The sweet potatoes were delicious.

I cooked the chicken covered for 12 mins and uncovered for 15, used the balsamic in the dish as the sauce, had no sweet potato so served with rice. Very simple and yummy dish, but I am guessing that really depends on the taste of the balsamic you use.

Maybe I did this wrong, but the chicken was completely tasteless. Sweet Potatoes were good. Would not make again.

The sweet potatoes were amazing!  I added brown sugar to the potatoes which gave them a nice sweet taste.  But the chicken was dry and not very flavorful.  I suggest adding some spices to the chicken.

The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sweet potatoes were amazing.  I sprinkled some salt on the chicken after it was done cooking and it added that extra kick.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was very good!  It was moist and flavorful!  I love balsamic vinegar.  I used garlic power instead of salt & pepper,  just because I prefer garlic over salt.

My husband enjoyed the chicken very much, me, as much. I should have read the comments first. Next time I am going to cut the cayenne and black pepper amounts in half. I think I will like it much better then.

This recipe sounded better than it was - kind of boring and definitely needed something else. I love balsamic vinegar, but my family thought that it was too strong. Won't be making this again.

Hm. I followed everything exactly. It was ok in my opinion, but nothing to rave about. The potatoes were very mushy, so like others I just sort of mashed them and hoped for the best! My guy loooved the flavor of the chicken though, so I'll make that again and just find a better sweet potato recipe.

I took the advice from some of the other notes and grilled the chicken but the potatoes I decided to mash after they were done baking.I used 1/2c milk(for three potatoes), 1tbsp cinnamon,1/2c brown sugar, and tsp of vanilla.I think the baked skin added a good taste and texture.It got rave reviews from the family. The chicken did need some flavor.
