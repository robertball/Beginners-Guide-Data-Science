This was amazing once I tweaked it.  My new husband and his buddies ask me to make it for our football parties every Sunday!

I use three chicken breasts, 3/4 of the bottle of wing sauce, 3-4 tbsp. butter and only about 1/4 c. of the blue cheese dressing (just enough to spread over the top).  This makes for the perfect consistency - any more sauce and it's too runny, and the leftovers (if any!) get too greasy and gross when reheated.  I always serve with Fritos Scoops and the guys LOVE it.  Reheats well too with the reduced amount of sauce.

This IS addictive!  I've been making this for years now, and man is it popular!  I used 3 poached chicken breasts, shredded in the food processor. Melted one brick of cream cheese in the microwave, and mixed 1/2 bottle of blue cheese dressing with that. Mixed about 2/3 bottle of Frank's with the shredded chicken, then mixed it all together and baked, rather than layering. No butter, I figure between the dressing and the cream cheese, it's got enough fat going on, lol. Love it, love it, love it!

Went over very well at my party.  The only change I made was using 2 cans of chicken breast, instead of cooking the real thing.  So easy - and still made for a popular dip.

I loved this!  Just FYI, I put all mine ingredients in a bowl, microwaved them till melted and the kept it warm in a small crock pot.  It didn't separate and stayed nice and warm for hours.  I served mine with baguettes but Fritos Scoops would have been good too.  I think you could use canned chicken or left over chicken from dinner or whatever.  I used my leftover Broiled Chicken from Costco and chopped it into small pieces.  VERY GOOD - reminds me of a chicken fire pasta I have.
PS No butter - there is NO NEED for it at all.

A friend of mine brought this to my Super Bowl party and it was out of this world!  She did it in an oval crockpot though. You have to use really good blue cheese dressing and franks hot sauce she says. Anything else just won't due. 
YUM YUM!

Made this last night as a single serving for myself, and it was AWESOME! I used one chicken breast, boiled and shredded, 4 oz. of cream cheese, Nancy's Wing Sauce (mild; 3/4 cup) and 1 cup of Naturally Fresh's Blue Cheese (organic and the best dressings in the world!), and I swear I had to force myself to stop eating it! Served with tortilla chips and garlic crackers.  Going to a company picnic in September and I was going to bring a dessert, but I think I found something better!  Forget the others! No complaints here!

This was delicious and a huge hit at my family get together.  I did change the recipe though.  I didn't use any butter and I mixed all the ingredients together.  It made no sense to layer it.  I used Cookie's Hot Wing Sauce and used both Ranch and Blue Cheese dressing.  I used enough of each to make the consistency just right.  I also used 4 chicken breasts instead of 2.

This recipe sounded much better than it tasted.  There was too much sauce both blue cheese and wing.  You weren't able to even get a taste of the cream cheese.  If I make it again, I would cut back on blue cheese and wing sauce.  Also would serve it with celery sticks on the side.

This dip is ADDICTIVE!  I did not add the butter and served it with "chicken in a biscuit" crackers.  

If you like hot wings, you will LOVE this !!

This dip is great! The following are the minor changes I have made: I use the precooked chicken strips (Perdue) and Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce.  First I melt the cream cheese on low & then add the blue cheese dressing (I like to use Ken's). Once melted it gets spread in the pan. I then melt the butter & add the wing sauce and the chicken strips (which have chopped up) to it. Once all  incorporated pour over the cream cheese/blue cheese and bake for about 20 minutes and then add shredded cheddar cheese and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy!

I've been making this for years...I've been collecting cookbooks for years and have seen so many different variations, but I think it tastes best when made with ranch dressing and blue cheese crumbles...it give the dip a better texture and flavor...I serve it with chicken flavor crackers and for a low-carb version...celery sticks in a mason jar.

I made this with all the exact measurements, however, I put it in a crockpot and didn't layer this. 
I thought it had entirely too much Blue Cheese dressing and Hot Sauce. I would cut down those two ingredients next time. It was ok but really blue cheesey. I think I'll try to make this next time w/ some ranch dressing instead.

Absoulely wonderful! I gave this to my neighbors as a thankyou for plowing our driveway and they loved it. Everyone loves it. The person who rated it a one must have bad taste!! I use Franks buffalo sauce and Ranch dressing instead. I've tried canned chicken, but I don't think its as good. I have made it 4 or 5 times and it has been a hit with everyone. Whoever came up with it is very talented!

I didn't find a reason to boil the chicken considering it's not a healthy snack anyways, so I just grilled it.  I also used only 3 tablespoons of butter, fat free cream cheese, and Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wings sauce.  I mixed everything but the dressing all together.  Everyone absolutely loved it, asked for the recipe, and insisted that I make it for every football game!

This was an excellent recipe, that I will make again for sure! It was a BIG hit! First I shredded the chicken and boiled it in the hot sauce (Frank's Hot sauce) for about 5 minutes or so... (I actually made the dip the following day) But when  I made it I followed one of the reviews by microwaving the all of the ingredients together (But left out the butter, not necessary!) and by putting it into a crock-pot on warm. I served with celery sticks and Frito scoops, but the celery went with it better, perfect combination.  ;0)

My favorite appetizer... always the first to go at parties.  I will sometimes do 3 chicken breasts and I boil them and then shred.  I use Franks buffalo wing sauce and only use 1/2 to 3/4 bottle and same goes with dressing use only 1/2 to 3/4 otherwise it can get a little runny.  Also alternate with either Kens Steakhouse blue cheese or ranch.

I'm a huge fan of wings, so when I saw this I was pretty much ecstatic.  Instead of layering I just mixed everything together, with only 3 tbsp butter instead of 6.  Went great with ranch (not a blue cheese fan) and corn chips, I would definitely make this again.

I took this to a party, and it disappeared in a hurry, with raves from everyone who tried it.  I don't do really hot dishes, so I turned it down a notch by adding a little bit of mild sauce.  Easy to make, something a little different, definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome dip with a few changes.  I, like other readers, left out the butter and never missed it.  I also cut back and use half of the hot sauce and blue cheese.   I also just put everything in a crock pot and mixed together.  It is always a favorite everywhere I take it.  We use colored peppers to dip in it to make it a little more healthy.  But if you are going to use chips get Fritos not just corn chips there is a big difference with this dip.

One of my Aunts makes this all the time... I love it! I used canned chicken as well, and less hot sauce (I'm a wuss). We dipped celery sticks and tortilla chips in it. Great tailgate fare!

I made this recipe last night for a dinner party. It got great comments! I did take the advice from other members by using canned chicken, using less hot sauce and alternating between ranch & bleu cheese dressing until it was the right consistency. It turned out pretty good. Be warned...it's pretty hot.

I love this recipe and make it all the time.  People always go nuts for it.  I used crumbled bleu cheese rather than bottled.  This recipe goes very well with celery stalks and Frito's Scoops.

Very good dip! I did not add the butter, like others suggested, and it was fine without it. I also used two large cans of chicken, & about half the amount of bleu cheese.

When I make this dip I add 8+ ounces of monterey jack cheese and decrease the amount of hot sauce by about half.  The cheese thickens it so you aren't left with a soupy mess.

This dip was awesome!  I made this for my Christmas Open House.  I didn't have any problems with greasiness at all but I decreased the butter by just a little.  My brother loved this.  The only change that I made was that I drizzled the dressing over the dip after I baked it.  Really great!

I made this last night for a football party and it was a huge hit. I adjusted the amounts as follows. I used 5 chicken breasts, 1 12 oz bottle of wing sauce and about 1/3 of a 16 oz bottle of hot wing sauce, 3 packs of cream cheese, and 2 jars of Marzetti's chunky blue cheese dressing (one reduced fat). I made 3 separate dishes, 1 pack of cream ceese in each then separated the other ingredients equally between the 3 dishes. I omitted the butter. This worked well. I think it would have been too saucy and too much dressing had I truly tripled the recipe. I am making this again this weekend!

I had very high expectations for this recipe but, as written, it did not work for me.  I reduced the amount of bleu cheese dressing to 12 rather than 16ozs, but it was still extremely runny when I pulled it out of the oven.  I stirred in a handful of shredded mozzarella cheese and that thickened the dip well without diminishing the buffalo or bleu cheese flavors too much.

Unfortunately, I refrigerated overnight and attempted to reheat and serve the next day.  The ingredients separated and I was left with a greasy mess.

I'm not giving up on the recipe, as it very obviously has delicious potential.  I will definitely not try making this ahead next time and will incorporate the reviews of others on my next attempt.

Took this to a Daytona 500 race and it was a hit with some huge fans of mo' better, mo' hotter foods. Some minor changes that I made to the recipe were: I made fresh blue cheese dressing instead of bottled (Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing from this site), added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, and used 1/2 Xtra Hot Franks hot sauce and 1/2 regular Franks hot sauce. Thanks for the recipe and some good eats!

I actually got this recipe from a friend also.  When she made it the dip was very thin and greasy-but still good.  So when I made it  I added chicken from a can (cause it's sooo much easier or you could tear the meat off those roasted chickens you get from the grocery store) and then I added the bleu cheese dressing and hot sauce until it was the consistency I wanted. If you do it that way the consistency is much better.  I prefer it much thicker but I think I used half a small bottle of blue cheese dressing, half a bottle of Franks buffalo wing sauce, two large cans of chicken, and a package of cream cheese.  This a very yummy recipe though....mmmmm!

Made this today for the football playoffs.  Used Frank's hot sauce.  It seemed like it was waaaay to thin.  The chicken got lost in all that sauce.  Perhaps my chicken breasts were smaller than needed.  At any rate, if I made it again, I'd cut the hot sauce and the blue cheese dressing in half.  Hubby thought it was too spicy as well, but that's not new for him!

Ok so my husband is out getting the ingredients for this recipe as we speak for a huge football party. I have been told that I am to bring this or a riot will be in effect! I have made this many times over but not exactly as the recipe states. I mix all the ingredients together, I don't do layers. Also I double and sometimes triple the chicken. It depends on how it's requested. This is by far the best dip I have ever made (other than guacamole). Thanks for the recipe!

This dip is the BOMB! I make this for family gatherings and they continue to be amazed at how delicious this dip is. Serve it with potato chips and vegetables and you almost have a meal (after feasting on this, you might not have enough room for the main dish because you won't be able to stop!)

first time I made this dip it was pretty loose, but since I've (just about) doubled the amount of chicken, this has become quite the popular dip! 
Also, I found that next day cold leftovers taste really good as a spread on a toasted everything bagel...

Typically I prefer my diet to be much healthier than this, but this is a GREAT party dish - I had a formal cocktail party last week, and it was great because all my friends love chicken wings, and everyone was happy to enjoy the taste of them without the danger of messy faces & hands staining our clothes!

Definitely follow the recommendations to cut down on the sauces though, because it makes it less greasy, and it keeps really nicely! I too used a Costco chicken for this, and applied the Franks hot sauce right to the chicken before combining with the cheesy mixture. It was so easy!

Make it easy on yourself and buy a Rotisserie.  I have made this many times to rave reviews.  I do not add the butter and I use 16 oz bottle of ranch dressing instead. I have made with blue cheese dressing and it is also very good.

I think if it had blue cheese crumbles instead of dressing, no butter, and less buffalo- it would be okay. AS IS it is waaay too rich, and not impressive. I am really disappointed.

This was super good.  I followed other people's suggestions:  I used the listed amounts of the ingredients, but just threw everything into a pan and heated it up.  When it was warm, I stuck it in a crockpot on low to serve.  After it was in the crockpot, I added extra crumbled blue cheese and just mixed it a little bit.  Deeeeeeelicious!

This dip was amazing and addictive!  I did alter the recipe as everyone suggested - omitting the butter and mixing it all together.  I then put it into a little 2qt crockpot to keep it warm throughout the night.  Nobody could stay away from it!  It was so good with Fritos Scoops.  The only problem I had was the red oil that started to show up after about an hour or so in the crockpot (on warm).  It looked very greasy and was quite a turn-off while eating it, for me at least.  And it was a bit embarressing to have a big greasy bowl of dip. I don't know what would have made it greasy - the only thing I can think is that it was the oil from the wing sauce?  Any suggestions on how to avoid this the next time I make it?  But I will be making it again!  Even with all the bright red grease that showed up in it.  It was a hit!

This was really tasty, but I am giving it four stars, as I had to alter the recipe quite a lot.   Like the other reviewers, I skipped the butter entirely due to the grease factor and used about 3/4 of the dressing in order to achieve the right consistency.  I only used about half of the hot sauce (6 oz) and it was spicy enough.  In fact, some of the older guests remarked that it was still too spicy for their tastes.  I mixed all ingredients together without layering and microwaved it due to a time crunch.  I served it with scoops and celery sticks and it was well-received.

yes, leave out the butter...ok to use more chicken too....and doesn't quite need the entire bottle of blue cheese dressing.  I like my dips thicker...but if you like it more on the soupy side, then make it just as the recipe calls for.  you won't be dissappointed!

Love this.  My husband was skeptical at first.  But it was love after that.  I did take a few suggestions.  I used 2 roasted chicken brst. shredded,4 Tbsps butter, 1/2 cup hot sauce and 1/4 of cup Maries chunky blue chez dressing.  I will omit the butter next time to greasy and takes away from the dish.  After I baked it with cream chez on the bottom first and poured mixture on top, Must use Franks Hot Sauce.

This is great!  I took a lot of help from other reviewers.  I boiled 3 chicken breasts and shred them.  I used 3/4 cup Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce.  5 Tblsp Butter, 8oz cream cheese, 1 cup monterray jack cheese and chunky blue cheese dressing as desired.  After the chicken was shredded it went back into the pot with the butter, Monterrey Jack Cheese and wing sauce for 10 minutes.  I spred the cream cheese on the bottom of the dish.  I then spred the chicken mixture and topped with desired blue cheese.  15 minutes to cook and it was FABULOUS!  It would actually be just as good without the cream cheese layer but you can't go wrong either way!

We had this dip tonight for the first time. First off, yes...it is very runny. However it is tasty! I cooked 5 chicken breasts and cut them up into very small bits, one bottle of wing sauce and one bottle of blue cheese dressing. I only used about 3 tablespoons of butter instead of the entire 6 as the recipe says...next time will not use any as I dont see why it was necessary. We dipped celery sticks and tortilla chips in it and in my husband's opninion the celery sticks were best with this dip, he said he liked the "crunchiness it added" and that they helped "neutralize the spiciness" I love very spicy anything, so I liked both. We only gave a 3 star because it was runny but good, however not a "stand out dip" as my husband would put it. I think I may make it again though and play with the ingredients more.

I loved this recipe. My boyfriend and I sat and ate almost the whole thing, and I sent some to work with him in the morning. DO NOT use bottled blue cheese, it's too thin to work like it should, make your own, it's easy. Also, used less wing sauce (Frank's Buffalo Sauce). But still, this was awesome and a good addition to the recipe box.

To answer MDMLibrarian, it sounds like you pour the dressing on top of the chicken mixture before baking.  Haven't tried this yet, but it sounds like it will be great.

I have taken this to several potlucks and it is always a big hit. I only use about 1/2 the butter and maybe 3/4 of the blue cheese dressing called for in the recipe. Serve with celery sticks and fritos scoops for dipping.

this got inhaled at our 4th of july party! I adjusted the recipe by using just enough wing sauce to thoroughly cover the chicken, I cut back on the dressing and left out the butter. I didn't want it to soupy and it was perfect!

Delicious! Took this to a SB party this past Sunday, and was 90% gone on a buffet of many other things.  I did follow others suggestions. I was doubling for a crowd that incl. kids, so I only used 2/3c Franks and 2/3c blue cheese dsg...also used lo-fat cream cheese, lo-fat blue cheese dsg, & omitted butter. Just mixed it all up and topped with shredded cheddar/colby jack cheese, since that is what I had on hand and cooked in 9x13 pan..never missed the fat and it was YUMMY!!! Served with celery sticks and scoop tortilla chips. I will definitely make this again for a crowd and next time will slightly increase the Franks sauce to kick it up. THANKS FOR SHARING!

Always a party favorite!  I use 1 block of cream chesse, 3/4-5/6 of the bottle of hot wing sauce and 4 T of butter- melt them all together, add the chicken.  Bake as directed and then top with blue cheese dressing.  Serves with celery sticks and fritos- can't go wrong!

I made this last night & it was a bit too spicy for myself & my youngest daughter. We used Red Hot Wing Sauce.. I was hoping that with the addition of the blue cheese dressing it would calm the heat down a bit, but it didn't. ~other then then it being a bit too hot for us, both of my son's enjoyed it a lot! 

I just put it all in the crock pot & then added the cheese about 15 minutes before it was done. 

*Just note if you aren't a person who enjoys heat in their food, you won't like this*

This dip was amazing!  I added cheese to the top layer before putting on the blue cheese dressing (the second time I made it) and it was even better.  Even people who did not like buffalo wings or blue cheese dressing enjoyed this - a huge hit!

I don't usually review - but this was super tasty!  All the taste of wings without the work of the bones....By the way, I didn't use any butter, I used about half of the sauce and just used the dressing on the top.  I will be making this again for the super bowl party!

I had such high hopes for this dip, but it did not go over well at all. Maybe I used the wrong hot sauce? I used a regular Louisianna hot sauce and we couldn't even eat it! It was SO hot! I do want to try it again, I just have to figure out how to tame it down.**UPDATE** It turned into a four star recipe when I tried it again using Buffalo wing sauce instead of hot sauce. (like the recipe says!) I didn't know there was a difference. Oops. I mixed everything together instead of layering it, and added the dressing until the consistency was right. I will definitely make this again...with the ingredients stated in the recipe!

I used the bottled blue cheese dressing and also mixed all the ingredients together before putting in the oven.  I drizzled some more dressing and hot sauce over the top.  Next time I am going to try real blue cheese.  I don't like chicken wings so I made this for my husband who loves them and he said to give it atleast 4 stars.

I really liked this dip, but I changed the amounts of the ingredients used.  I used (3) small chicken breasts, (2) packages of cream cheese, 1/2 of the Buffalo sauce (I used Frank's), 1/2 of the Blue Cheese dressing (I also poured in about 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing) and did not add any butter.  I was sure to remove any fat from the chicken breast and I also rinsed them to avoid getting any of the greasiness that many complained of. I did not layer the dip, instead, I used a hand mixer to mix the cream cheese and wet ingredients until smooth and then stirred in the chicken. I made this ahead of time and stored in the fridge for about 2 hours before cooking.  It turned out nice and creamy. I served with Fritos Scoops.  Lots of compliments on this one !!!

This recipe would have been good if not for the fact that it was very greasy. I left out the butter and it was still very greasy. After I baked it I put several paper towels on top to soak up the grease and it still didn't work.    As I stated, I didn't even put any butter in it.  It was just a greasy mess.  We tried it with some chips anyway and it was not good.  Thank heavens we didn't waste more than three chicken breasts to make this recipe.

This tasted fine but I think that the Buffalo Chicken Dip on this site is better & easier.  It is not necessary to layer the ingrediants.  I also like mosre blue cheese flavor.

This kind of tasted like a chicken wing, if you can get past the odd creamy orange color and weird texture. It's just not what I had in mind at all.

A++++ This will definitely be a staple at future parties.  EVERYONE raved about this.  I did double the amount of the shredded chicken, and used ranch in place of the blue cheese.  My husband is not a fan, and it turns out a lot of other people aren't either.  So, I'd recommend using ranch.  Also, I didn't use butter after reading reviews.  I used everything else to scale, and it was a good consistancy.  I did also use the crock pot to keep it hot for the whole party. I served this with celery sticks (very popular), and fritos scoops. AWESOME!!  HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!

I made a vegetarian version of this with Quorn "chicken" chunks, and it was fantastic.  Instead of bleu cheese dressing, I crumbled about 4 ounces of bleu cheese into the dip and mixed everything together.  An addictive junk food.

My husband and I love hot wings especially dipped in Blue Cheese so I thought this would be a great dip to have at our sons first birthday party.  Unfortunately, it was a greasy mess and most people didn't eat it.  It had a good taste but looked super gross.  If I ever attempted it again, I would leave out the butter completely and use less wing sauce.  Just a tip- this cost me about $10 to make!

INCREDIBLE recipe! Definitley serve hot! Didn't make many changes to this oh so simple recipe... I used 3 chicken breasts rather than two- used a little extra cream cheese in the bottom as my dish was larger than the recomended 8X8...It was a HIT! i hardly got any as the guests swarmed it at soon as it hit the table. Next time i'll make two, one with Xtra hot redhot...as i'm a spice freak! Served with corn chips

This is always a hit at parties!!! I use Texas Pete wing sauce and extra chunky blue cheese dressing to keep it from getting too runny. I also put the chicken in a food processor to get it really really thinly shredded. So good!

This recipe is delicious! For everyone saying it is too hot and omitting the butter, that's what the butter is for. Anyone who lives in Buffalo knows that chicken wing sauce is Frank's and butter. The bottled stuff isn't right. Look up a recipe for chicken wing sauce and use that in this recipe. Also knowing that, I will tell you, if you have ever had wings from a pizzeria in Buffalo, there is always yummy, buttery wing sauce in the bottom of your bowl. That's why when you use the called for amount of butter in this recipe, you get that red colored "separation". I will say use 4 breasts instead of 2 for more chicken flavor and definitely add one package of shredded cheese to this. Use the homemade wing sauce instead of the bottle and butter mixture. MIX IT ALL TOGETHER AND BAKE IT. It will be better than any other chicken wing dip out there!!! This is a good base recipe and with the tweeking, it becomes great!!!

the only thing i didnt like about this is that i thought it was super greasy! but of course it was delicious!  i couldnt eat too much or i would get sick. but it was a hit! my boyfriend asked me to make it for him to bring to lunch at work for the guys. i think next time i will try a different brand of hot sauce to see if that helps with the grease.

This is by far the best recipe I have found on this site. I make this every year for Christmas and other gatherings. I did simplify it by using canned chicken, it tastes just as good and a lot less work! I also skip the butter, I just don't think it would add anything. I make this in a tupperware bowl and then when the party is about to begin, I microwave the bowl and then put it in a mini slow cooker and serve with frito scoops. I have never made this without being asked for the recipe. It's wonderful!

Superb recipe. I did cut back to 1/4 cup of bleu cheese dressing, and I cut back the butter to 4tbsp(I'll cut it back to 2 on the next try). Served with Fritos Scoops as recommended. It was a HUGE hit for the big game. Now I am 'assigned' to bring it to all get togethers like that.

Everyone love, love, LOVED this! I shredded 3 chicken breasts, used an entire bottle of Frank's and about 1/2 bottle of bleu cheese- anymore of the bleu cheese and my husband said it was overwhelming.  I kept this in the crockpot for the Superbowl party and it was scooped up with Fritos.

A huge hit at our party!!  I did as others had suggested: omitted the butter, used Franks's red hot sauce and an excellent quality blue cheese dressing, AMAZING!!  I'll be taking this to gatherings:)

Absolutely fantastic. Would recommend for ballgames, tailgates or just a fun appetizer.

yep, very yummy indeed!  used about 3 cups of rotisserie chicken breast, light cream cheese, a little less dressing than it called for (only b/c i didn't have the full amount), 3 tbsp butter (but will omit entirely next time) and texas pete buffalo wing sauce. cooked about 10 mins longer.  very spicy but very well received! requests to make it again already.  good with tortilla chips! (scoops would be perfect!)

I made this dip one night and served with Scoops. My family loved it. I will try a different wing sauce next time. The sauce I had on hand was a bit bitter and a little too hot for my youngest, who only complained after going through about 1/2 a bag of chips with the dip.

Very good, went over well at our running club.  I did add extra chicken and cheated by using a rotisseri chicken.  Also did as other suggested and heated it up and placed it in a crock pot.  It was a nice change from the usual dips, thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I just mixed this up, and it's great.  I did modify it though--I didn't use any dressing and I didnt cook anything (other than the chicken, which I already had cooked and shredded in the freezer).  I spread the cheese in the bottom of a pie plate while the chicken defrosted.  I melted the butter in the microwave and then stirred in almost 1/2 a bottle of chicken wing sauce. When the chicken was defrosted I stirred the chicken in with the sauce and butter then poured it over the cream cheese.  Easy Easy Easy. I had no trouble with it being too thin, since I only used 1/2 the sauce and omitted the dressing.  If you want blue cheese flavor add some dry crumbled blue cheese to the chicken mix.  It would be better than the dressing.

Wow! I made this for my girlfriend's birthday, and even the guys who don't like blue cheese couldn't stop eating it!!  

The next time I make it, I will cut it in half, but otherwise, it's great!

My male friends always request this at parties and it's always the first to go. I substitue blue cheese w/ ranch and I drain out a little of the hot sauce after simmering it in the chicken and butter (it can get too liquidy for my liking).

This was strange.  It tasted okay but something just wasn't right.  The picture of it looks as if it was all mixed together but the instructions don't say to do that.  It is very liquidy too.  It seems to me that the consistency should be thicker.  It's almost soupy.  Did anyone else agree?

This recipe was just ok. It turned out very runny and quite hot. I followed the directions to a "t".. Maybe next time I will only add half the hot sauce.

This is a great idea for a summer cookout or party! Our family attended a 4th of July party and this was on the menu. I asked for the recipe and the hostess told me that several people wanted it as well. I plan on making this for a church function in August.

This has become a big hit at parties amongst our group of friends!  You can use leftover chicken or buy one pre-cooked at the grocery store to save on time.

I made this for my Superbowl party last weekend and overall it went over great -- however, if you don't like hot wings or really spicy food, this isn't for you!  Those who like spicy food really enjoyed it though!  next time I make it I will either use all mild sauce or at least half mild half medium so more people could eat it.  I thought it was excellent, though!  I did have to play with the right amount of shredded chicken to sauce in order to avoid it being runny.  i just kept adding chicken until i thought it was right -- next time i'll add a little bit more.  And i agree with another poster, I will serve with crackers and celery next time!  thanks!

This one is good... but to make it better, omit the butter and blue cheese, add shredded cheddar and ranch dressing, mix it all together, and you have a great recipe!!!

This went over like a lead balloon with my family.  The general consensus was "if you want something that tastes like Buffalo wings, make REAL Buffalo Wings!"

I'm at a loss for words. I can't believe that anyone would eat this. It was horrible! I know that chicken wings taste great with this sauce, but wow, this was gross. No one liked it. I have never given anything a one star review before, but this is awful.

This was way to runny for me.  Also it was a bit hot.  My sister liked it however so I gave it a 3.  I will not make it again.
