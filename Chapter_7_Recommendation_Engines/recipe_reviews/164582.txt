Cheesecakemama, you sure have earned your moniker! I admit, I was skeptical about the baking method as well as the large amount of sour cream for just two packages of cream cheese. But you were right - this turned out perfectly just as you said it would! This is a light and creamy cheesecake, far different from some of the more dense, heavy and kind of dry  cheesecakes. You were right on about the cheesecake not cracking too! Your recipe is perfect for any baker, novice or experienced. For my own preference, however, the crust was a little thicker than I would like, so next time it will be easy enough to cut it back to maybe one cup of crumbs to suit my tastes, but others may like it just as is. Delicious on it's own or with any variety of toppings, I served this with Supreme Strawberry Topping, recipe also from this site.  I'm so happy your wonderful recipe got published - not just for you, but for the hundreds of home bakers I know are going to be pleased with it too!

I used cinnamon grahams and chopped pecans, as cheesecakemama recommended in her own review/update of her recipe. I made no other changes. First attempt at a real-real cheesecake and honestly, I don't know why I was so worried about making one. It's really not all that difficult. I followed the directions exact. When the cheesecake was finished cooling, I spread Supreme Strawberry Topping all over the top, as my sister in law LOVES strawberry cheesecake. No idea how it tastes, but just because it was so simple and not scary to prepare, it's earned all five stars. I'll update my review once I hear from my SIL how much she loved it. NOTE: She loved it, as did my brother in law. Rock on! This one's a keeper.

I am the submitter of this recipe.  I use pecans not walnuts, but you can use any kind of nuts you like in the crust or leave them out, it just gives it more texture.  You can change up the recipe and use different things for the crust, shortbread cookies or oreos come to mind.  You can also add different flavors to the cheesecake, use my recipe as a base and have some fun!  I recently have discovered for a short cut if I add another cup of sour cream to the recipe and use the 2 of the ready made crusts.  I have a great dessert really quick for a carryin or party.  Remember it freezes well, freeze in slices for a special treat.  Enjoy!

The proportions of your ingredients is almost exactly the same as the recipe I've used for years, so I'm sure it's great, BUT yikes!  I teach food safety, and I would never recommend leaving anything with eggs or dairy products in an oven overnight or at room temperature for as many hours.  CAUTION!  Finish cooking, and refrigerate after it cools.  Otherwise, you'll be playing kitchen roulette!

I had a hard time deciding on a rating for this cheesecake ... I give 3 stars for "average" recipes that I might or might not try again.  This cheesecake could be spectacular - for someone who likes very light, airy cheesecake.  My husband and I prefer a denser, NY-type cake.  I knew this wasn't going to be incredibly dense by the ratio of cream cheese and sour cream, but I guess I didn't expect it to be SO very light.  It was very easy to throw together and neither of us is complaining about having to eat the rest of it, but I won't make it again.  So 4 stars for what it is: a light, airy, fluffy, tangy *slightly* reminiscent of a pudding dessert, but 3 stars for what it was in comparison to what we consider a cheesecake.

I'd never made a cheesecake before in my life but finally got nerve enough to try one. I reviewed many but settled on this one because it seemed simple and straightforward. While it was relatively simple, the flavor was anything but. This cheesecake was fantastic and certainly a crowd-pleaser. I'll be making this again and again.

This was simply the BEST and easiest cheesecake I have ever made!!  I always make NY style, and thought that was the end all to be all UNTIL I was recommended this one!!  To die for! Didn't change a thing, except that I baked it for 45 mins. and then shut the oven off and let it sit overnight! Made some strawberries and glaze to top it off with whipped cream, and VOILA!!! Perfection!  Thanks Cheesecakemama! You truly live up to your name!

I am not a fan of cheesecake, but my mother loves it.  I made this for her as a surprise welcome home dessert when she was sent to Ohio recently for a training seminar for work.  After she got done raving about how wonderful the texture and flavor of this cheesecake are, she convinced me to take a small taste.  I immediately went into the kitchen and cut a big piece for myself afterwards!  Excellent recipe that I will absolutely make again and again!

Cheesecakemama gave me this recipe on the Recipe Exchange more than a year ago, and I have made it many times with excellent results. This is now my no-fail, turn-to method for perfect cheesecake - and if a bungling baker like me can do it, anyone can. Thank you! xo

This is an excellent and easy cheesecake.  I'd never made cheesecake before and CCMama gave me this recipe and detailed instructions.  I actually followed the instructions (for once!). Came out perfectly!  Bf is the cheesecake fan, so I made it for him, but I also liked it.  It didn't crack and came out very nicely.  Thank you for the recipe!

Cheesecakemama had to help me with this recipe. Only when I started, I didn't read the final instructions about shutting off the oven and letting it cool off prior to refrigerating it and keeping in the frig for 8 hours because I was cooking dinner in the process......TY Cheesecakemama for your help. IT was FANTASTIC...mine was slightly soft and creamy...and soo over the top delish. Here's my adjustments. But really I stayed true to the recipe 100%, my springform pan was bigger then a 9 inch, It was a 12-in. I doubled ONLY the crust, added both optional ingredients...and the crust was soo good even with the pecans and cinnamon. And just by clear accident, not thinking as I reached for the Xylo Sweet(a natural Xylitol Sweetner) and not regular sugar, I used Xylo Sweet through out the whole thing...hmm YUM, I worked out beautifully. And I used fat-free cream cheese. And believe it or not, I didn't realize until I got to the sour cream, I didn't have any..that's not my norm. So I replaced it with plain Greek Yogurt. OMGosh!! My cheesecake was very sinfully---sin free. ;-) I also realized I over whipped my batter in the process and it cracked very little, like 2-3 inches across the top and didn't go down but 1/2 and inch. I covered it with a Greek Yogurt topping made with Ideal Brown Sugar Replacer and Ideal Confectioner's Sugar replacer...and it was to DIE FOR!! Thank you it was awesome!

Hi CCMama!! I am a little confused. I don't know if my cheesecake is done. It is slightly stiff but creamy and soft. Also it didn't really bake up at all. My crust although good it is wet. Does this mean it may not be done? I followed the instructions but it did sit out in room tempature right after the oven for about an hour then I put it back in the oven on like 200 for abt 20 mins because I didn't think it was done.  Once at room temp again I put it in the fridge.  I will try it again but can I just bake it for the hour then let it go to room temp and put it in the fridge? Btw it is very tasty I topped with whip cream and strawberries. Just don't want anyone to get sick...

This cheesecake was better than 5 stars because it was delicious and easy. I made it at 10 o'clock at night on New Year's Eve, and I left it in the oven overnight to cool. In the morning I popped it in the fridge and it was perfect for New Year's dessert. Great job Cheesecake Mama, thanks.

Such a great recipe!  I added an extra 1/2 a pack of cream cheese just because I had to use it up.  Even with that slight change it turned out GREAT!!!  So easy, baked up beautifully!  I debated a topping but it was too pretty to cover up!  Everyone that tried it commented on how beautiful it was and said that it tasted amazing!  They told me to "keep that recipe!".  People went back for 2nds and 3rds!  :) Great straight forward recipe!  Thank you Cheesecakemama!!!!!!!!!

I'm shocked. I actually made a cheesecake that did not crack or turn too brown, etc., etc. All I did was follow the directions and it is wonderful. No water bath or babying in any way. Thank you so much for this recipe.  **I want to add to this review. I made it lower carb by using 3/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup sugar, and I just used a very small sprinkling of cracker crumbs for the crust. I have also added 1/4 cup of cocoa to the batter at the same time as the sugar, and it makes a fantastic chocolate cheesecake! I love this recipe.

Absolutely perfect cheesecake! This is simple, elegant and delicious. I've never made an easier cheesecake. I followed the recipe exactly and I loved the thickness of the crust. Not to thick, not to thin, perfect :o) I didn't have any pecans, but since that was optional I wasn't worried about leaving them out. I forgot to put the cinnamon in the crust so I added it to the filling and everyone loved it! Most people coldn't quite figure out what it was that made the filling unique. I was a little nervous about the cooking method but excited to turn the oven on for only 30 minutes in the heat of summer for this recipe! After leaving it in the oven for six hours to cool down it was perfectly cooked without a single crack! I can't say enough about how much I like this recipe. In my opinion, it's so much tastier than the heavy, dense NY style cheesecake. It was a hit with the birthday girl too! :o)

Wow, Cheesecakemama.....this recipe is WONDERFUL!!  I followed your directions exactly and froze the cheesecake as soon as it came to room temperature.  The next week I unfroze it overnight in the fridge for our Christmas party...it was the first thing to go and people offered to buy the ingredients for me to make it again!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!

YUM, YUM, YUM! I am a cheesecake FANATIC, and this recipe did not disappoint! This was the easiest and one of the most delicious  cheesecakes I have ever made or eaten. Mine did crack slightly, but the taste and texture more than made up for it. This is my new go to cheesecake recipe from now on! Thank You Cheesecakemama! :)

This is so delicious! And not difficult. My hubby's favorite recipe now, but he ruins it with topping!  LOL  Great plain or with topping of your choice.  I have made this often for many occasions, and has become my "go to" recipe for cheesecake. Can be changed up many ways. Thanks AR for getting this published!

I love this recipe!!! It is so simple and easy. I have it memorized. I am vegan so I used vegan cream cheese and sour cream. I also like to put strawberry sauce in the batter.  An easy way to bring the cream cheese and sour cream to room temperature is to let them sit in hot water. This recipe is definitely a keeps thank so much!!

I've made many cheesecakes over the years - this was the easiest one ever, and tasted as good if not better than all the other more complicated cakes.  I added salted caramel sauce and toasted pecans to the top of this, but you could embellish it any way - the cake itself is great!  I will using this recipe from now on.

UPDATE: EVERYONE WHO HAS HAD A PIECE OF THIS WANTS THE RECIPE (IT'S THAT GOOD!). :) OMIGOSH! This is absolutely FANTASTIC!!! I don't consider myself a exceptional baker, but I pulled this off like a pro! I've had BAD luck with cheesecakes in the past. Either they cracked, browned terribly or sunk in the middle. Not only is this cheesecake picture perfect, it has a silky texture and tastes DIVINE! If you follow CKM's directions TO THE LETTER, you'll be pleasantly surprised. AT MINIMUM, allow your cheesecake to rest for 6 hours (and NO peeking!). Also, BE SURE to bring your eggs, sour cream and cream cheese to ROOM temperature BEFORE you begin baking (ESPECIALLY your cream cheese)! Cold or even semi-cold cream cheese will NOT beat to a smooth consistency, leaving you with a lumpy textured cheesecake (yuck!). NOTE: It's natural to OVERBEAT lumpy batter (and it WILL be lumpy if you start with cold cream cheese!), but doing so will cause your cheesecake to crack. If your batter is lumpy, simply give it a quick whirl in a blender or fp - but not for too long or you'll end up with soup! I had to do this and my cheesecake turned out just fine. :) Cheesecakemama, I THOROUGHLY enjoyed your recipe and can't WAIT to try some of your suggestions to make this my OWN! HEISLORD5's supreme strawberry topping was the perfect crowning touch (it was BEAUTIFUL!!!). Thanks again, CKM. There IS a reason you are the cheesecake queen and for that, I am completely indebted to you. :-)

I thought this was good. My guests thought is was great. My dad had two slices and he doesn't usually like cheesecake. It didn't come out perfect though. It cracked on me big time and I did follow the recipe word for word. I had not planned on topping it with anything but had to so I ended up topping it with strawberries. It looked beautiful and ended up devoured by all so it turned out well. Thanks CCMama.

I was very nervous when it came time to shut the oven off after 30 minutes, but every one here reassured me it would be fine and they were right as usual. All I can say is this cheesecake is FABULOUS!

FABULOUS! My first attempt at a "real" cheesecake, too, and I am so impressed! I had compliments flying at me left and right. So creamy and surprisingly simple. I added one extra T butter to the crust to ensure it binded, no pecans/walnuts (just b/c I made it at 2am - too tired to add that step!) - followed tat2's advice on the strawberry topping and it was simply to die for, and I'm not a cheesecake lover! Thank you!!

Surprisingly really really good!  This is a very simple and fluffy cheesecake.  I used a ready-made crust and home-made cherry topping.  For a twist, I spread melted chocolate on the crust before adding the cheesecake batter and everyone loved it!

First attempt at a cheesecake and I'd say it was a success. So easy and delicious! I left it in the fridge for a little under 24 hours and I'd say it could have sat a little longer because the cheesecake fell apart a little when I cut into it. Paired it with the Supreme Strawberry Topping on this site as others suggested and it was a perfect pair. I will definitely make this again.

I made this cheesecake yesterday and it was absolutely amazing. People that don't usually eat sweets of any kind decided to "cheat" during Lent to try it lol. Absolutely amazing. To save time I used two pie crusts to put the filling into, and with the amount filling it was perfect. The sizes of the pieces are significantly smaller but perfect sized for parties. Will definitely be making this again.

this came out really good.  i sprinkled some chopped pecans on the bottom of the pre-made shell prior to filling.  i don't know if this had anything to do with it, but the bottom crust was hard to come out. if i do ever make again, i'll skip the nuts.  thanks cheesecakemama!

I have made this cheesecake twice now and am going to make it again this week for Christmas!  The only thing I do different is to just make a plain graham cracker crust. I think it is the easiest and best tasting cheesecake recipe I have ever found.  Tastes just like restaurant cheesecakes that cost about $30.00 for a whole one!  We like it drizzled with chocolate & caramel syrup.  This time I am going to puree thawed frozen strawberries to pour on top - can't wait to try it that way.  This one is a must try!!

I had a recipe similar to this 20 years ago and I lost it. Been looking for it ever since. Made it for my son this Thanksgiving, I followed the recipe exactly except I left it in the oven overnight. I never opened the door. I came out PERFECT, just like my old recipe used to. No cracking, nice a rich and was such a hit, I should've made two. Now I have to make another one.

[5/13/12] Very good.  Followed recipe as is.  Used 1 bag of graham crackers (8 sheets), needed a little more butter.  Added walnut pieces.  Softer than usual NY cheesecake, but good flavor.

This was disappointing, but perhaps that's because I used Israeli cream cheese which is more liquidy than American. Whatever the case, the crust was good, but the texture wasn't nearly as smooth as I had hoped. I also found that I needed to bake it longer.

Cheesecakemama, you've definitely lived up to your name! This cheesecake is lighter than the traditional ones I've had but even tastier. I do prefer a smooth as opposed to crumbly cheesecake, since it tends to be less dense. I followed Cheesecakemama's review about using two ready-made crusts since I didn't have a spring-form pan at the time. I did add an extra bit of sour cream and an additional egg because I thought it would need it; it didn't because it rose quite a bit... Seems our packages of sour cream and cream cheese are slightly bigger than yours... I didn't take this into account and they did indeed crack, deeply... Oh, I layered the cake as follows: crust, melted semi-sweet chocolate with cream and melted caramels with cream to hide the cracks. Caramel did slide about the cake; I think I will bake it on next time or find a way to make it stay in place.  I will definitely make this again as possibilities are endless! Thank you.

I seem to have a knack for making dreadful (not to say, deadly) errors when it comes to cheesecake-- but this recipe is foolproof, easy to remember, and most of all, DELICIOUS! Absolutely delicious. Everyone raved about it. I made an account here just to comment on this recipe, it's that good. Love it!

I assumed it good because mine turned a little under-cooked. It made it and baked exactly as directed in the recipe. I don't know where went wrong. But the outer parts of the cake were delicious. I will definitely try it again and hope it goes well next time.

Thanks CCM for a great cheesecake recipe!!!  I made this for my inlaws and they devoured it.  My father inlaw asked my mother inlaw why her cheesecake didn't come out like this.  It was a great texture and good flavor.  I froze a few slices that were left over to have on another night and I wound up eating it frozen because I couldn't wait!

Yes, the title says it all!! I was also questioning the baking, but figured I'd give it a try anyways. And to my amazement it came out perfect! This was so creamy and delicious! I although thought it had too much crust and next time I'll cut back and try crushed Oreos rather than pecans. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a delicious, yet easy desert.

All I can say is WOW!!! Ihave never made a real cheesecake before this one and it was awesome!!  I followed the direstions exactly and it was perfect.  My guests were equally impressed!!  I did put pecans in my crust with the cinnamon. Yummy!!  I can't say enough good things about this. It was delicious, easy, and I will definitly make again!!

The title is spot on, Perfect Cheesecake this is! It was perfectly creamy and the flavor is out of this world good. The only thing I did differently was that I added a squirt of lemon juice but it didn't really make a difference. Try this recipe, you will be glad you did!

Thank you for publishing this great no fail recipe. I've been making cheesecakes for years, and this one is the first that didn't crack on the top. My Hubby LOVED it! This will replace my old recipe!

Absolutely outstanding! I followed the recipe exactly with one exception: I omitted the nuts from the crust. Just didn't think they would bring anything to the party.
I won't say we are cheesecake snobs but the vast majority of cheesecakes out there are not worth the calories IMHO.
This one most definitely is.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this accordingly and it came out GREAT! I’m saving this as it’s the easiest cheesecake I’ve ever come across, and it was perfect. I actually added instant coffee to it and it was wonderful. Took it to a potluck and came back without any left overs.

Every recipe calls for baking at 350, Mine always cracked. I bake at 325 and no more cracks. This is a first suggestion I've come across about over mixing causing the cracks.  One last hint turn the bottom of your springform pan so the lip is down. This makes it easier to serve.  I love the recipe additives, I try as many as I can.  Try lemon extract  instead of vanilla (GOOD).  One warning, a friend added a strawberry glaze to the whole cake. I discarded it the following morning (spoiled). Use topping for each slice as you serve it.  As far as the baking method I feel low and slow is the way to go.  When done I remove after twenty minutes from the oven and allow it to cool to room temp.

I really liked this recipe! I've been making a cheesecake for years, but it only served 4-6 and was as much work, so I tweaked  this version. 
First, I made the crust with 1/3 c sugar, 1 1/2 c crumbs, and 4 TBs melted butter. All else was close, but I added 1TB of fresh lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture- that is a must! The second time I made this cake it cracked, and that is b'cause I forgot to soften the cream cheeses and the batter was lumpy, so I beat it too much! 
Thank you for a GREAT recipe!

I made this cheesecake for the first time ever... and I am so happy as well as proud of myself.   I did it exactly as the directions called for (no variations, additions or omissions).  And yes, I will be making it again!

Almost forgot, I did not make the crust, I did use Keebler Graham Cracker crust.

Love love this recipe. First cheesecake I have ever made and my guests devoured  it. I followed all the tips including 5 hour cool down in oven. Worth all the effort. 

I might add a bit of sugar to graham cracker crust or a better brand of graham crackers as I used generic brand and it could have used a bit more flavor .

This was perfect as the recipe is. Further, if one wanted to use this recipe as a jumping off point to add extras, that would be fine too. I just want to stress that this cheesecake is one of the best I have ever had full stop.

Delicious! This was the first cheesecake I made and it turned out wonderfully. It's texture is absolutely perfect!  I would recommend a little less sugar, maybe 3/4 cup, since it was a little sweet for my taste. Just a tip: It browns very nicely during the 6 hours in the oven. I was afraid that mine was undercooked because it wasn't golden after the half hour in the oven, but I needn't have worried because it looked amazing the next morning. This is a super recipe

It was really good! You might want to add more butter to the crust though.

No fuss & Delicious! Made exactly as is with no changes. Some possibly helpful tips : the 1.5 cup graham crackers was 1 “sleeve” of Graham’s (3 in a box) I’ve forgot to precook the crust, I’ve left out the nuts, I’ve only had a half tub of sour cream BUT regardless it still always comes out amazing! Thanks

Flavor was good, but the middle was gooey.  I rebaked the remaining half for 20 mins before we finished it.  I also used vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers for the crust which was delicious!

I didn't make any changes other than using a teeny bit more cream cheese because I had some and I used about a third to a half cup of walnuts/pecans because I didn't have enough graham cracker crumbs and I just blitzed those in a food processor. My whole family loved it.

Giving this 5 stars because it was tasty and easy to make.  I followed the cheesecake part exactly.  I did the crust different so I could make it gluten free.  I used 11/2 cups hard gf sugar cookies, then the cinnamon and butter (I don't like nuts).  Next time, I will use less butter in the crust.  It seemed too wet and melted all over the bottom of my oven.

My crust was rock hard, the cheesecake cracked, and the overall texture was off-gritty, almost.  .  I followed the recipe to a T, and have a brand new oven, so I'm not sure what went wrong. I regret making this recipe for someone's Birthday dinner without testing it out first.

The best easiest cheesecake ever!!!  It is so creamy and delicious and not as dense as some cheesecakes can be.  Took it o a Christmas party and everybody raved about it and wanted my recipe.  Make sure that you read the blurb at the beginning of the recipe where it tells you to leave it in the oven for 6 hours or even overnight after turning the oven off because it doesn't say that in the instructions in the recipe.

Upon cleaning out the frig, I came across 16 oz. Sour Cream & 2 pkgs. of Cream Cheese. So I searched Sour Cream Cheesecake & found this delicious recipe. We had cheesecake for breakfast! This is my new go-to recipe for cheesecake....The 2 things I changed was 1/2 of the beans from 1 vanilla bean, oh and drizzled 4 T. melted butter over the crust before baking.

I absolutely adore this recipe. It is light, fluffy, and not too sweet, which is to my liking. This is a great recipe for any baker, whether you are a novice in the kitchen, or masterful. I have made this recipe at least a dozen times, and I experimented with the crust, both thickness and content, and found it perfect just the way it is in this recipe. This of course is a personal preference, so don't be obligated to my opinion. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking to try something new, or not so new. Try it sometime, you won't regret it.

I baked it a little longer because i was worried and it cracked (probably because I over whipped). Covered the cracks with drizzles of chocolate and caramel. I topped that with pecans. Everyone loved it. My dad who does not really like cheesecakes because they are so heave said he loved this one because it was very light. My son's 18th birthday was hit!

This cheesecake sounds great. Its still cooling in the oven. The batter tasted really good. I hope it comes out well tomorrow. I will update. I would note the following: cream up the cream cheese real good prior to adding egg, whip up the sour cream prior to adding. Mine did not mix absolutely smooth, and I didn't want to continue mixing because I didn't want to overmix. Also, I noticed in several reviews people said it needed more time. I would agree... until I did some research and read the authors own review. It says to "turn off oven." Allowing to cool to room temperature. What's missing is most people are used to taking something out of the oven to cool. I would suggest adding in a comment that says leave it in the turned OFF oven overnight or 6 hours. Thanks!

This was a very easy cheesecake to make. I loved it however I was upset that my cheesecake cracked. I know if you over mix it will, but I thought that I wasn't. I would recommend that you make a side topping to go alone with it. It gives it that extra flavor. I also would not recommend leaving it in the oven because that is when my cake cracked. But overall it was a great cake!

My new cheesecake recipe! The only changes I made was I used filberts (hazelnuts) instead of walnuts and I used a food processor to make them super fine. I also added a tad bit more sugar (like a heavy pinch) and a small splash of vanilla to the crumbs for the crust. Another tip.... Make sure everything is room temperature before mixing and I beat the Creamcheese until it's smooth before I added the egg. If your cream cheese is room temperature and soft but you beat it with cold eggs you'll get clumps. Love this recipe! Thanks ;)

It's delicious.  I had to cook it a bit longer because the center was still wet at 30 min.  I doubled the recipe and made two, so that may be why.  It's not heavy, and I like that.

This is a very easy and not to mention delicious cheesecake. I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of cutting back the graham cracker crumbs to one cup. That's just a personal preference, as I don't like a thick crust on cheesecake. This is the first cheesecake I've made that did not crack. The secret is not to overmix. You don't need to put a pan of hot water in the oven or anything else, just follow the recipe, and you'll have a beautiful cheesecake, with no cracks.

It was so difficult to turn the oven off at only 30 minutes!   It was even harder to not peek!   I had to trust the other reviewers on this and turn the oven off and not peek, and I was at war with my curious nature.    Trusting in something not yet seen  or experienced  =  FAITH      : )   

When I put the cheesecake in the oven, on a lower shelf I placed a 9x13 pan of water filled with hot water.  The air was dry here today and I didn't want to risk it cracking.  It turned out absolutely beautiful.  Not a crack one, a beautiful vanilla color, rather than the darker brown color I get from other recipes.  It looks very professional.

I haven't tasted it yet, I am reviewing on faith that it is delicious, but giving it 5 stars on ease and appearance.  It it doesn't taste like a five star cheesecake, I'll update this review.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Really easy and tasty.  It isn't may all time favorite but great for when there isn't a lot of time for prep.

Followed the recipe and cooked it for 30 minutes, then left it in the oven overnight per one of the reviews.  It just didn't look cooked enough in the morning.After stressing over the appearance, I opted to chill it and hope it firmed up well.  You'd think spending the entire day in the fridge would help...it didn't.  When we sliced into it, it was too soft and didn't retain shape, more like pudding.  The flavor was great just not the "look."

Very good recipe!  Nice, light cheesecake that goes great with fresh fruit.  In order to make sure that it didn't crack in the oven I put a pie plate full of water on the rack underneath it.  Came out perfect for father's day!

This recipe was fabulous!  I will be using it for all my future cheesecakes!  I followed the recipe exactly and left it in the oven overnight (baked in the evening).  It was wonderfully received.  We served with chocolate syrup, caramel syrup and a fresh strawberries/blueberries mix.  Thank you, Thank you, Cheesecakemama!!
