Loved the flavors in this recipe. I used whole grain pasta and added some bell peppers. Will be making this again.

I used cod instead of salmon as my little one is not a salmon fan. I eyeballed the feta and dill and probably used more of both than the recipe called for. My family enjoyed this and I will make it again.
