YUM!!!! I halved the recipe (except fot the onion) and baked it in an 8x8 baking dish. This came out PERFECT! I didn't have the saffron, so I omitted that. I can't believe the flavor that came out of just those few ingredients...sooo good! I will def be making this delicious rice again! Thanks for sharing. :)

You know, I was making such a small amount of this recipe for Hubs and me that I immediately decided the oven method wasn’t practical for me and decided to just use the traditional stovetop method instead.  But I must say, after reading through the recipe thoroughly I wasn’t impressed, and wondered, truly, what the real advantage was of preparing the rice this way rather than the stovetop method regardless of the number of servings.  This recipe’s method requires more steps and more pans.  The stovetop method is a “one stop shop.”  Also, I’m not sure I like the ratio of rice to liquid either - in my mind, it should always be one part rice to (at least) two parts cooking liquid, be it water or stock.  I like the addition of saffron and onion, but neither is anything special.  And the cayenne isn’t necessary at all.  Frankly, the bottom line is that this is a basic, simple rice with an unnecessarily complicated way of cooking it.  In addition to simply cooking it on the stove top I made it a little more colorful and festive by adding a medley of colorful finely chopped bell peppers, fresh minced garlic and a good handful of frozen peas. Prepared as directed, this requires unnecessary steps that don’t benefit the final result.

I followed the recipe exactly (except omitted the saffron) and had no problems whatsoever. No more Rice-A-Roni for us! I am eager to experiment with other flavor profiles. I find it very annoying that the review tagged as the "Most Helpful Critical Review" didn't even bother to make the recipe as written. But used the stove-top method. I for one, welcome a good rice recipe that will free up stove space. It widens my options for dinner. Thank you Chef John!

I loved loved the texture of this rice. It was so easy to make too. I sprayed the pan with some PAM and none of it stuck. When I saw the amount of salt and the cayenne, I was a little worried. It was a tad too salty for me and there was a kickback from the cayenne. I made it a second time and cut the salt back to 1 tsp. and the cayenne by half. That time I got the cayenne amount right, but still working on the salt amount. I will have to keep working on the right salt amount. Though, thanks Chef John for teaching me a new method to cook rice.

I am giving it 5 stars even though I made a couple changes  and will make more changes the next time I prepare this.  I am giving it 5 stars because I LOVE the technique and the flavor is amazing!  My twin toddlers gobbled it down and my husband couldn't stop smiling as he complimented my cooking over and over and over.

First, I read a review complaining about the amount of pots used.  You can use the same pot for both stovetop steps.  Not complicated.

Second, changes I made.  I added broken up vermicelli to create a box-rice effect.  It was an amazing addition.  I sautéed that with the onions.  I used bouillon in lieu of stock as that was what I had on hand.  Accordingly, I cut down on the salt, which I would have also done since I was using salted butter.

Third, what I would change next time.  1) use 3.5 cups of stock.  The ratio I know is always 2 parts liquid for 1 part rice.  While the rice was amazing, it was a teeny bit crunchy.  I think 4 cups of rice would mean soggy rice so I don't feel the normal ratio is warranted.  Sealing with foil really keeps the steam in and I think that helps.  Still, a little more liquid would have made a difference. 2) only use 1/8 tsp of cayenne.  The kick from the cayenne was a little much for what I was after with this dish.  With that said, it's not overwhelming as is.  Just family preference there. 

This is an amazing, surprisingly simple, and most definitely a go-to dish for us going forward!

This was really easy to make and it came out great.  I normally shy away from cooking rice because it always comes out either sticky or undercooked.  This recipe was fantastic.  I used a whole small onion instead of half because I love onions.  I used water instead of the chicken stock and added chicken bouillon because I ran out of chicken stock.  I left out the salt because the bouillon is already salty.  I also added about a tablespoon of garlic to the last two minutes of simmering the liquid.  The rice came out wonderful.  Perfectly cooked, fluffy and yummy.

Hands down the go to side for a dinner group when you need rice and don't want to have to cook as guests arrive.  Made recipe and a half (3 cups rice) as directed sofetning the onions in the pan and then added the seasonings and broth to that before stirring into jasmine rice (all I had on hand). Didn't really get any kick from the cayenne.  Turned out perfect, but will maybe add garlic or seasoned salt next time with some other herbs for extra flavor. Seems very versatile, could probably even add a little tomato sauce and cumin for a spanish rice.

This is really tasty. I skipped the saffron and omitted the salt. Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly. Next time I may cut back on the cayenne just a smidge. It took everything I had not to up the broth. 3 cups of liquid for 2 cups of rice goes against everything I know. I stuck with the 3 cups expecting to have to add more and cook longer. I was pleasantly surprised to see that 3 cups was enough. Rice was fluffy and in individual grains.

Yay! Finally, my rice turned out!! I'm always going to prepare it this way. I used brown rice and it takes a bit longer than 35 minutes -- I cooked mine for 45 minutes and it was still a little hard. An hour probably would have been best. Foolproof recipe!

I tried this recipe tonight. I loved it! I cooked mine in a rice cooker instead of in the oven. I just put the onions in there after the oil was hot. I used one part rice to 2 parts broth and it was exceptional. I didn't have saffron so I used tumeric and added peas. What a nice side dish.

This turned out PERFECT, my husband keeps asking me to do it again. I halved the recipe (because it's just two of us and 2 cups of rice is a lot), but I kept the amount of onions the same. Excellent flavour and perfect consistency.

Hey Chef John, I tried this recipe and we loved it. My husband is French and you can imagine he is not easy to please when it comes to food, but every time I tried one of your recipes he liked it a lot. I guess your taste in food and ingredients correspond to ours. Keep on the greate work, teaching neohpites like myself seem like professional cooks.

By the way I told hubby yesterday that I love you so much I am willing to leave him for you, he's kinda OK with it ???!

Awesome! Has become a favorite in our home. Just served it to the kids and grandkids, and everyone raved. My grandson even asked for seconds. You can add just about anything to this. I throw in pieces of broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and celery and it's fantastic. I deviate a little from the directions in that I add the rice to the butter/oil mixture while it's still in the saucepan, then scrape that into the casserole dish. I then boil the broth mixture and any vegetables I'm adding in that same pan, and pour that into the rice mix. Turns out great every time. Thanks Chef John!

Great way to cook basic rice pilaf. Perfect ratio between the rice and liquid. I used Asian short grain rice (Japanese brand) because that's what I always have on hand. I usually cook my rice (not pilaf or seasoned in any way) in a rice cooker and pilaf on stove top (which can be tricky sometimes even when using long grain). I tried this oven method using my Asian rice and followed the recipe. Surprisingly they came out excellent! I omitted the saffron, just a very tiny pinch of cayenne and kosher salt, and tiny bit of freshly ground black pepper. Because DH and I are vegetarian, I used all water and about 1/8 tsp of vegetable bouillon (Better Than Bouillon in a glass jar). Will definitely make again!

Delicious and easy way to make rice! I have also used beef stock and thought it was very good. Try to resist the urge to peek under the foil after you take it out of the oven. Just trust that it will be good and don't let that steam escape! Just a note that my daughter thought it was a bit too spicy, although my husband and I thought it was just right. I personally love the very slight kick of the cayenne, but if you have kids, you may want to cut down on the cayenne just a TAD.

This was awesome, exactly as written.  At first I thought I should have added more broth because it looked dry, but it turned out to have excellent texture and the rice was perfectly al dente.  We enjoyed the leftovers for several days.

This turned out really yummy,loved the saffron in it. I needed to cook this a little longer and added a little more stock. I think my foil was not quite up to par. I will be making this again and again.

I tried this more for method rather than flavor and it scores a big ole 5 in both areas. No saffron in the house so omitted that and omitted the salt.  Will add a little salt next time.  It was perfect after the 10 minute standing time.  Next time I think I'll add a little garlic and jus a small squeeze of lemon juice.  You have to try this.

This is an excellent recipe that makes perfectly cooked rice.  I used half the amount of cayenne, therefore I wished I had increased the amount of chopped onion, but it was still very good.

I followed the recipe exactly--got ready to eat, finally unwrapped the foil, and....crunchy rice in broth. It was not at all cooked. The flavor was good when I gave it a taste test, but we couldn't eat it--I couldn't even chew the rice..  I'm willing to consider that my oven is starting to die, but I had just made a cake in it the night before without problems. Next time, I will use half the cayenne. This is the first Chef John recipe that has failed me--I will check my oven temp and try again, and come back for a (hopefully) better rating, because it has potential. I was just disappointed after stopping to buy rice, stock, etc. and then wouldn't cook. I will keep trying, and return another day.

I'm really loving you, Chef John! Followed exactly. Was perfect, massively tasty! To the idiot who gave this 3 stars, you should try the recipe properly before rejecting it. I used basmati rice, cause that's what I had. It usually uses more water, but I did not deviate and it's perfect.

I am so impressed with how this turned out. It was perfect! I left off the saffron. I also used low sodium chicken broth. After taking it out of the oven, I also ended up leaving it sit for about 30 minutes instead of just 10 (because we weren't ready to eat yet). When I took off the foil, the rice was still hot and it fluffed just like it did in the video. I saw several people at dinner going back for seconds of this rice.

Great way to make rice for a crowd!  I doubled the recipe, added 5 minutes to the cooking time and another five to the out-of-oven steaming and it was perfect.  Reviewers who doubt the ratio of rice to liquid must be thinking of the typical stovetop preparation, which is a different method (-with some of that liquid evaporating during cooking as steam escapes the pot.). Also, melted butter/oil make up some of the "liquid" in pilaf.  In short, trust the recipe - it delivers!

I loved this recipe.  I followed it pretty faithfully (except I used vegetable instead of chicken stock) and it turned out very well--tasty and an excellent texture.  The oven really makes a difference.  I'm looking forward to trying this with dill rice and olive rice.

Doubled this recipe for company, and it turned out great. I just used a deep 9 x 13 casserole dish. Always risky trying something new for guests, but everyone really liked it. I used basmati rice and beef broth instead of chicken, it was all I had. I also reduced the salt by at least 1/3. The cayenne added a nice zip, but not too spicy. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely be making this again.

A basic rice pilaf that tastes great as is, but can be used as a base for your own creation!  

The whole family ate the lot. As we usually have one child per meal who simply refuses to eat at least ONE side, the fact that there were no leftovers is irrefutable proof that this is a five star recipe! 

Baking was also a nice change of pace for rice. It made it easier to leave it alone while it steamed! Lol

Perfect!  The first time I made it i followed the directions exactly except for cutting it in half as it was just for hubby and me.   Made it again tonight with Jasmine rice.  I thought it was even better because of the fragrance.  After making the World's Best Lasagna I'm trying all of your recipes.  Thanks, this is now my go to for rice.

This was really good! So simple! I didn't have saffron so I used Tony Cachere's Herb mix in the same measurements and omitted the salt and cayenne (it's in the herb mix). Turned out GREAT!! Next time I may try curry :)

To the reviewer "Ali".....Did you use brown rice? Brown rice takes longer to cook. Did you cover the dish? This is VERY IMPORTANT! Perhaps you were peeking? The foil "lid" too loose?

Chef John hits another homerun with this recipe!! One word to describe it:DELICIOUS Read the recipe, watched the video and did exactly as directed (except for the Saffron; I was able to find Saffron at our local grocery but not willing to pay that price for it. Over $11 for a few pinches, no thanks) Anyway, this recipe was so easy! The hardest part was not peeking at it after taking it out of the oven. As bad as I wanted to, I didnt peek becuase I didnt want to take any chances of failing it. When the long 10 min was over, I took off the foil and  waah laa! Flakey, tasty and hard to believe I made that! Went delicious with Margarita marinated Swai fish fillets. I even did a presentation test popping it out of a round container to plate it which worked like a charm! It was cooked all of the way, not clumpy at all and perfect amount of moisture to hold the molded shape. P.S. I also sprayed the baking pan with a no-stick cooking spray before putting the rice in it. Rice didnt stick to the backing pan at all.

I followed this to the "T" (with the exception of the Saffron) and it would not cook. I had to put it the oven AGAIN for another 30 minutes, let it sit and it finally cooked. not as fluffy as his, still a bit sticky and did NOT taste like rice pilaf at all. ACK!

This recipe has the exact same ingredients as the pilaf i make on the stovetop, minus the saffron.   I wanted to see if there was a difference being baked vs steamed...  and there absolutely is!   This is by far more flavorful and the only way i'll do it now.  Thanks to the submitter!!

Delish and perfect every time! I made with saffron for the first time tonight, but we didn't notice a flavor difference. Considering the price of saffron, I say skip it.  Some people seem to have problems with the rice not being fully cooked and/or excess liquid. My suggestions; make sure your oven temperature is right and it's covered tightly with foil, and NO PEEKING during cooking or the 10 minute rest period.

So easy to make! I used homemade vegetable stock versus chicken stock which didn't have any salt added. I also didn't have the saffron. Although it takes a while to cook, it is a truly simple and easy recipe to make. This rice is great with a crockpot chicken.

I generously gave this three stars simply for the fact that I think it has potential.  I followed the recipe to a T (did not have the optional saffron so I skipped that).  First, it was crunchy--can't stand undercooked rice and its not fun trying to fix that!  Second, it was far too salty.  If/when I try this one more time, I will definitely cut back on the salt and cook it for a longer time.

The PERFECT way to cook rice. I LOVED this dish, as did my guests. It was so easy and fool proof. I doubled the recipe as I was having quite a few guests, and it didn't take any more time (although could have used 2-3 minutes more in the oven maybe). I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

BEST. RICE . EVER! All the steps in making this are absolutely worth it. I have a family of four and EVERYONE (kids included) wanted seconds! I'm so glad I didn't decide to scale back the recipe because they also requested the leftovers the very next day! I chopped the onions very small because my kids are the kind that will pick them out, but no one even knew they were in the rice! They just "melted"! I only put a dash of cayenne, because of my littles, and it was just perfect. It gave it an extra "something". I don't usually buy saffron, but I'm sure that would only kick it up another notch - as if that's possible?! Definitely a dish you can make for company and the rice/water ratio was perfect. Just seal your foil around the dish well and NO PEEKING until after it rests for the entire 10 minutes. You will find steamy, fluffy, individual grains of rice that you just need to fluff with a fork and serve.

I have been making rice this way for years and highly recommend it.  The nice thing about this recipe (in addition to its excellent taste) is that it is very forgiving.  It can stand for as long as 20-30 minutes out of the oven and still be warm if you keep it covered.  In addition, you also free up a burner on your stove.  Once you try this method, you may never go back to the old way.  Enjoy!

Coming from a culture that loves its pilaf, I might add that the recipe can also be applied to make a pea-pilaf, by adding peas to the fried onion, and letting them fry for about 2-3 minutes, depending on how much you want to cut the sweetness of peas. We usually don't use saffron. Variations can also be made by frying the onions with diced carrot or sliced almonds, etc.
For an even more aromatic dish, you can add whole spices like cinnamon, black peppercorns, cloves and cumin seeds with the onion.

Definitely a keeper.  I doubled the recipe and used a little less than the two to one ratio for water to rice.  I also kept it in the oven for 10 minutes longer.  Make sure to let it rest for 10 minutes outside the oven with the foil on very tight.  It was perfect.  I think the extra time helped the rice cook completely,  as some reviewers said theirs was a little al dente.

Just what I was looking for.  My mom used to make something similar but I never knew it was called rice pilaf!  I only sprinkled a bit of salt and cayenne pepper and it was fine.  May add a bit more next time but didn't want to overdo it on the first try.  Will be a regular part of our rice rotation.

I love rice as a side dish, but I don't have a rice cooker and I always struggle with cooking rice so that the texture is just right. I don't want to use instant because it's just not the same. Anyways, I think this is my favorite way to prepare rice now. It is so delicious. I followed the recipe(except for the cayenne. I'm not a fan and neither are my boys), and like everyone else I don't have saffron and I could not find saffron anywhere. So I did a little bit of Internet searching and it seems that saffron is extremely expensive and it's probably not common for most average ordinary folks (like me) to use it. So I looked up a substitute and found a tip from a pro chef. The closest substitute to saffron is 1/4 tsp turmeric and 1/2 tsp paprika. So that is what I did. I think it made the rice taste outstanding. I also agree that it's not a big deal to have to use a pan for the onions and broth. I just wiped out the pan from the onions for heating the broth. I added a smidge more broth and the rice came out absolutely perfect. Try it, it's worth the extra effort.

This was a very tasty side dish.  Since saffron is pretty pricey, not too many cooks always have it on hand.  Try using 'turmeric' instead of saffron.  It works well in recipes which call for saffron.

I have probably made this recipe about two dozen times since I found it. I love it because the recipe is really versatile, so if I don't have an ingredient, such as Olive oil,  I can just substitute with something else and every time it comes out delicious.

I have made this twice now and both times it has been perfect.  I don't cook rice often but normally I will put twice as much liquid as the amount of rice (I had no uncooked or crunchy rice).  I did put 4 cups liquid in for the 2 cups rice. I don't buy saffron due to the price but tumeric is a common substitute which I used.  This rice is so loaded with flavor that to me it's almost addictive.  I make this using only 2 pots; one to boil the broth and spices in and a large iron skillet that I brown the onion in and also cook the complete recipe in the oven - it works great. It's so easy to make that I can't imagine so many having trouble with it however, the cooking method is designed for the recipe and should be followed. I won't be looking for another recipe; this one is a keeper for me. Thank you so much.

If you are skeptical about this method for cooking rice, just give it a try. It turns out really nice. Each grain is totally separate, not mushy at all. 1/4 tsp of cayenne is a little spicy for me but I'm weak when it comes to spice. Turns out good when I cut the butter and oil in half too. When I'm in ah hurry I just heat up the broth and skip the simmer. Still turns out great.

Oh my gosh I have NEVER had this recipe turn out bad.  I have to eat gluten free and love this recipe so much.  Just added a little spicy chicken broth and the dish was even more amazing.  Also cook this in my largest cast iron skillet and holy cow sooooooooo good!

This is great!  I added broken vermicelli when browning the rice, chopped onion and garlic.  
A great alternative to potatoes for a side dish.

After many years of cooking from this site, this is my first review even though I've made some tasty dishes that are keepers.  Chef John, my son could not stop raving about this rice, saying it is the BEST RICE I've ever made!!  And I'm from Louisiana and make A LOT of rice!  I took the idea from your video and molded the rice in a ramekin.  A few green onions on top.  I'll be making rice this way from now on.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the saffron which I didn't have.  Just threw a dash of Everglades seasoning in there along with the cayenne.  Great flavor.  Thanks a million!

Another perfect Chef John recipe! Thank you!

For those who say that it doesn't cook. It's VERY important to cover it with aluminum foil AND to leave it uncovered while it rests for 10 minutes after cooking, that way the steam cooks the rice.

It was REALLY plain. I cooked it in my rice cooker hoping for it to come out nice and fluffy, I think the recipe called for too much chicken stock, and it was ust plain. Needed for seasoning.

I enjoyed making and cooking this sophisticated rice pilaf. I made it the same way and with the same ingredients Chef John showed. I did mould it by spooning rice into ramekin cups, press  gently, but firmly; turn over unto a plate. Garnished with sliced green onions. Makes a great presentation. Served it with Chef John's Prosciutto-Wrapped Cherry-Stuffed Chicken Breasts and haricot green beans. Thank you Chef John.

My fiance and I adored this! I made it alongside one of my favorite entrees: Blackened Salmon. The pilaf was a nice side. The light, buttery flavor, with just a small kick from the cayenne and saffron, balanced the meal out perfectly! I think I might have eaten more of the pilaf than the salmon! I just could not get enough. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of the butter. I used only 1-1.5 tablespoons and used Smart Butter rather than real butter. The saffron was definitely worth the extra money spent at the grocery store! It added a lot to the taste. I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

I tried this rice tonight and it was a huge hit!!   I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I added small bits of carrots just because I like carrots in rice.  The cayenne pepper was subtle, but there - it gave it just a touch of heat and i basically like saffron in anything.  I cannot wait to make this again.  It may just be the best recipe I have ever made from  AllRecipes !!!!

Finally I have made rice that was cooked to perfection! Not sure why cooking rice usually gives me problems.. either undercooked or overcooked and mushy.  I even have a rice cooker that will burn it on the bottom. This time it came out perfect.  Husband raved over this.

I always have a hard time with rice - it always overcooks, undercooks and gets mushy. This recipe really is foolproof. Rice came out perfect. I omitted the saffron and used about 1/3 of a sweet onion and 2 shallots and used 1 tsp of salt. Everyone loved it! I think it would also be good with a clove of garlic. Works well with beef broth as well.

This turned out great; I loved the texture! Followed the recipe (omitted the optional saffron) and added a bit of dried parsley flakes and yellow food coloring to the simmering broth for visual appeal.

Followed the recipe almost exactly ( used only evoo as suggested by one review,  added a chicken bouillon cube and 2 cups water and vegetable broth to get the full 3 cups),aside from those changes everything was exact. There might be  misuse with the rice that I used, but it took forever to cook. It became mushy by the time I decided to move it to  pan and cook it with more veggie broth. I wasn't too much a fan of the flavor, but my mom thought it was delicious. I don't think I'd make it again, even with with proper rice though.

Amazing flavor! Like several other reviewers, I did not use the saffron since I didn't have it "in stock" and was making a dinner from ingredients I had on hand. I used Lundberg Organic Long-Grain White Rice (Amer Test Kitchen favorite). This recipe is easy to prepare. I put it in an oval baking dish and baked it in my Breville Toaster Oven and it came out perfect. No sticky rice. I did toast some slivered almonds and pine-nuts and put them in before baking. I should have put them in after because they were too soft. Lesson learned. Either way, with or without the nuts, the rice flavor is fantastic. I'll be making it again. Oh yes...the entire meal was from Allrecipes. I served this along with "Juicy Roasted Chicken" and "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" (a staple in my repertoire). Everything complemented each other very nicely and the timing of it all coming together at the same time worked well (not my strong-suit). I got the chicken in...prepped the dry ingredients for the cornbread, assembled and got the rice baking then assembled and baked the cornbread. YUMM-O!  I love this site!!! EDIT 12/11/16 - I continue to make this recipe, especially whenever we have family and are making chicken or pork. My young nephews scarfed it up this summer and everyone who has ever had it seems to really like it. It has a great flavor.

Loved this recipe!  I followed it exactly how it was written, except didn't have Saffron.  It was delish!  I've been looking for a good, simple pilaf recipe, and now it's safe in my recipe box.  Will use this again and again, I am sure.

I needed this for a base recipe... trying to replicate the rice pilaf we had as a side at Holiday Acres Resort in Rhinelander wisconsin. I use to be a waitress there and I would mow down on this with fresh squeezed lemon when i'd get hungry.... So to make this more like holiday acres from the recipe i remember , I added chopped celery along with the onions to the butter and olive oil. I added Thyme to the broth while boiling it... I use threw two whole sprigs in there. It was nice to use them from Thanksgiving... and they still look pretty good... just a little dried up. I'm using a slow cooker because I need the oven for the fish I'm going to make tonight. So far its smelling pretty good. I am having a hard time rating this because of the changes i've made... I couldn't find any other rice pilaf with celery added to it. I Guess i can't post this "review" without rating it.. I use my reviews for references when i come back to make the recipe again...

This recipe was an easy and great way to make rice! I absolutely loved the flavor. I used more rice than I was supposed to so it didn't come out completely done, I just had to just the time a bit to make it just right! Thanks for posting this recipe!! YUM!!

This was absolutely the best rice I've ever had!! It turned out perfectly, with slightly crunchy bits around the outer edges, which I loved. I used homemade chicken stock, and used 3.5 cups. I also slightly browned the rice after the onions were cooked, but don't think it was necessary, I just did it because years ago I had a recipe that said to do that. Very easy, cook in oven along with something else at same temp, easy dinner! Will be making this often.

I followed Christina's recommendation when halving the recipe, i.e. kept the amount of onions the same. I didn't have any chicken broth so just used water and hoped for the best. I was pleasantly surprised and can only imagine how much more flavor the broth would add. I did add a quarter of a red pepper with the onions and about a 1/4 cup frozen peas for color. I only used a pinch of cayenne pepper.

This is delicious! I had been looking for a recipe to make rice a little more special and this is it! I did things slightly differently--I stirred the rice right into the butter onion mixture and sautéed it for a while, then I added the liquid and cooked it right on the stove for 20 minutes like you normally would with rice. It turned out perfectly.

This is a very good recipe to have on hand at all times. It is quick and easy and the recipe can be changed according to what you have in your pantry. I did not have chicken stock but I did have some chicken bouillon cubes that I made into chicken broth to pour over the rice. I also added some veggies from my fridge and changed the spices and it turned out very well. Thumbs up from me!

This was fantastic! I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, except I had to omit saffron because I didn't have any. The texture came out perfect, and the flavor was subtle with the perfect amount of kick from the cayenne. My kids thought it was a tad spicy, but not me! This recipe is a keeper.

I made a couple changes. I had to use beef bouillon because I was out of chicken stock. I also added some red bell pepper (equal to amount of onion). It was a huge it with adults and children at dinner!

This isn't rice pilaf. What makes "pilaf" pilaf is that the rice is sautéed first.

I love this recipe, have made it many, many times. It never fails us!  Like other readers,  I too find it bothersome  that "The most helpful critical  review" didn't even bother making the recipe . They changed it entirely and then complained about it.  I feel that if you change the recipe entirely, you really shouldn't be reviewing it at all since you didn't actually make it. That said, this recipe is pretty versatile. We make it as directed and then add diced carrots, mushrooms, celery, bell peppers, etc. depending on the mood.  It's a great dish. the rice comes out perfectly cooked, each grain is perfectly al dente and separate from each other. No more soggy, stuck together rice.  love love love!

I made this rice pilaf and it was delicious but I had to cook over an hour.  I followed recipe and even went back to double check.  I even used super thick tin foil made for grilling.  Did not peek. When I opened there were puddles of chicken broth and the rice was hard.  What could I be doing wrong?

Excellent flavor!! It could easily be 5 full stars for me, however, 35 minutes wasnt enough time to fully cook the rice in my oven. It was still crunchy. I will be making it again because the recipe has so much wonderful flavor (I made it with the saffron), I will just be cooking it for 45-50 minutes and double checking the done-ness of the rice. I did notice that there was plenty of liquid to keep cooking the rice, but didn't realize that it was not done until I took a bite of it at the dinner table. Too late to fix it because everything else I had been cooking was done. I had it all perfectly timed, but my DH liked the flavor complexity so much he wants me to make it again, soon.  :-)

I didn't bake this - I put it in a deep pan on the stovetop and covered it, then cooked on low until the liquid had all absorbed into the rice. Not a problem. I used 3 or 4 scallions rather than 1/2 of a regular onion, and I sprinkled parsley over the whole thing when it was done. Tasted great!

Made this tonight with baked salmon filets and it was excellent! Hubby and I are not overly fond of rice but eat it as a healthy alternative. But we both really liked it cooked this way so I'll be keeping this recipe as a regular repeater.  Didn't have saffron but otherwise didn't change a thing and it made a perfect rice side dish. Update: I forked out for saffron and it does make a bit of difference in taste and appearance.  But it costs $14 for a small package of it so I don't think it's really worth the price.

I did exactly what was called for and the rice was greasy and not cooked all the way through. I do not recommend making this.

CAUTION:  If you ever boil anything with cayenne pepper in it, PUT A LID ON IT, unless you want to spend the rest of your time in the kitchen coughing and sputtering.

Delicious!! I omitted the saffron & cut the salt to 1 teaspoon. Otherwise I made as is & everyone loved it. We like to add scrambled eggs & soy sauce to the leftovers the next day for our version of fried rice. I sometimes throw a handful of frozen peas into the stock mixture as well. I absolutely love this recipe. Thanks Chef John!

Well, I’m torn on this one.  I was anxious to try Chef John’s oven method for making perfect rice, but I wasn’t totally thrilled with my result.  I made half of this recipe in an 8x8 baking dish, which worked out well.  And the timing was spot on.  But my end result wasn’t quite as fluffy as the rice I make stove top.  I also thought this recipe was just a little greasy and I’d cut back on the oil and butter the next time.

This always turns out beautiful and delicious. It's so good my boyfriend not only asked me to make it again, he asked me to show him how to make it so he could make it whenever he wanted. I skip the saffron because it's pricey and I never have any, but this rice is still very flavorful without. Love it, love it, love it. We make it all the time.

This is an AWESOME RECIPE!!!  I doubled the recipe and used (Knorr) chicken boullion  granules and water instead of the broth.  I only needed half the salt.  Did not add saffron, and cooked it 45 minutes, plus the 10 minutes rest, covered.  I topped the rice with a mushroom, vegetable sauce.  I only had the "dollar store foil", so I doubled it....and everyone wanted seconds and thirds!  I will definitely make this again!!!

Excellent dish. At the suggestion of other viewers, I cut out the salt.  I used Knorr chicken stock and it was delicious.  My husband and children also loved it (which is rare for the children)!

I was impressed with the flavor of this rice.  Following the advice of a few people reviewing this recipe I also adjusted the amount of salt (and omitted the cayenne pepper since I don't like spiciness). This dish will become part of our menu.  Kids LOVED it and boy are they picky.

Wonderful. I don't like onion, so I use a couple of cloves of minced garlic instead, then sprinkle a teaspoon or so (I don't measure) of onion powder in too. I make this rice a couple of times a week, usually. It's foolproof.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I made this to accompany a baked cod dish and they were perfect together. I omitted the saffron, added a little more onion, reduced the salt & cayenne by half and increased the broth to 3.5 cups. Baked it in a 9x13 glass casserole dish and it came out amazingly! I look forward to having this again!

Best rice ever!  I actually browned the onions (cause I was looking at another recipe) and it enhanced the flavour and the presentation.  Husband is a rice fanactic and loved it!  Served it with broiled scallops and left over beef stroganoff.  Followed recipe to a TEE

This turns out perfectly every time I make it and I like that I don't need to sit at the stove watching it.  I've made it mostly as written except I didn't have cayenne on hand so I used a little Aleppo pepper instead.  I also use jasmine rice as that is all I keep on hand for white rice and I really would recommend that or a basmati.   I also recommend a good quality bone broth or stock as it really makes a difference in flavor.  The rice has great flavor while also being mild enough that it could pair with almost anything well.

Doubled & cooked in slow cooker. Sautéed onion in skillet, then added to slow cooker. Browned rice in butter then added to slow cooker. Used low sodium box of chicken broth + can of chicken broth. Added 1 package Sazon con Goya and heated to boiling in microwave. Poured into slow cooker and added a sheet of foil under lid to keep more steam inside. Cooked on low 1.5 hours and I didn’t burn it like I normally do! Light & fluffy, but needed more salt. So easy and a real keeper!

I’ve made this many times and it always comes out perfect! The rice is fluffy and flavorful. I add turmeric instead of saffron, which gives the rice a beautiful yellow color. I also throw in a handful of frozen peas and carrots or mixed veggies for more color.

I change ingredients all the time depending on what I am making... but the original is the best. Most often, I just make plain rice. Now that I live at 3000 ft, I have lost my ability to cook rice correctly;) Cheers Chef John! I just realized that I’ve been following your recipes for years now. Thank you!

It was foolproof and turned out amazing.  The green onions on top added a nice touch. I used Basmati Rice instead of long grain rice and it was fluffy and moist.  Next time I am going to mix it up and add chopped mushrooms.

This recipes was very basic and very good! I love how it baked in the oven. I followed the directions exactly but added only 1 tsp. of salt because there was salt in my chicken stock. Each grain was separate (not that it matters to me), and the texture was perfect. Next time I might add some slivered almonds and a little parsley at the end.

I skipped the saffron simply because I didn't have any. My family and I loved this recipe! Lots of flavour! I will definitely make this again.

Yes, indeed, this is the best rice! I've made it 4 times. DO add the saffron! I use about 1/2 tsp. That's what makes this dish sing! It's so cool to bake the rice and not have to worry about it sticking to the bottom of the pan.

Used basmati rice which may not have cooked as well as a regular rice, leaving it a bit chewier.  After letting it sit for 10 minutes, I fluffed it and let it sit for another 30min.  Texture didn’t really change, however, my husband and I loved it! The flavour Is delicious... so glad we get to have leftovers!

I made this rice as a side dish to baked fish for a birthday dinner.  It turned out perfect!  Everyone loved it!  My husband said it was the best rice he has ever had!  Followed recipe exactly minus the saffron.   This recipe is a good base to be creative with.  After it is done any sautéed or steamed vegetables could be added for an unlimited variety of  flavor combinations.  A good way to use up small amounts of left over veggies.  I am going to have fun being creative with this recipe.  Thanks Chef John!

I'm sorry, I have used this recipe countless times and never shared any praise.

This is a staple in our household.

A staple.

It's so easy, so tasty, and pairs well with nearly anything.

Sub beef stock for chicken?

BOOM, a hearty, dirty rice.

This is an amazing recipe and I am forever in your debt for sharing it.

One of the best, most flavorful simple rice recipes I've made.  I already wrote it down and put it in my recipe book.  Unfortunately I didn't have saffron but it was amazing without it. I will purchase some and use it next time for sure.

Full disclosure: While I did use the exact ingredients the recipe called for (opted not to use the saffron), I wasn't really keen on using multiple pieces of cookware just to make rice. I skipped the oven in favor of using one pot on the stove. I cooked the onion as directed, added the stock and seasonings to the same pot, brought it to a boil, added the rice and then covered and reduced to simmer until done. The rice tasted so good, perfectly fluffy, and flavorful! I have no idea how the oven would have changed things, but was happy with the final result.

I didn't have saffron, so I used turmeric. It was awesome.  I was afraid it wasn't enough liquid, but it came out great.

First of all, my 18-year-old son loves rice-a-roni rice pilaf and he said this was better! I did this on the stove in one pan. I used the saffron. It was a gift and I was happy to finally use it! I used beef stock because I was out of chicken broth. I also browned the rice slightly before adding the broth and saffron. It was very tasty. I used seasoning salt instead of salt, as I usually do with everything! Thanks for the recipe. I'll be making it again and again.

I made it in the rice cooker and used an extra cup of water (4 cups liquid total). I cooked everything but the rice and liquid in a pan first, then added it to the cooker once it was cooked, which saved time. It was quick and delicious!

this comes out great. I have made it several times and you can do all sorts of things with it. Make your on stock, use leftover drippings and other goodies. I tossed in some garlic cloves and diced carrots a few times.

Substituted saffron for sage and thyme and cayenne for paprika. Would make again.  Worked out well. Light fluffy and not sticky at all.

I did not make any changes to this recipe but it did not cook as stated.   I had to put the dish in the microwave for 20 minutes longer to cook the rice and absorb the liquid.   Don't know what went wrong but followed the recipe exactly.  Probably will not make this again.

I do cut this recipe in half since I usually am cooking for two; however, I feel this baking method is still warranted! Flavorful and fluffy rice every time.

This recipe is a crowd pleaser every time!  However, I do have to turn the heat down for my crowd by skimping on the cayenne pepper a bit.  Great flavor, great side dish, great for pot lucks.  Thanks again, Chef John!

wonderful! I have trouble following recipes and this was no exception. I omitted the salt, and halved the stock and rice quantities. Because I had veggies in the fridge to use up, I diced zucchini, yellow pepper and mushrooms, added them to the onion, butter/oil mix just as it finished browning to just slightly soften and coat them. I then simmered no-salt chicken stock with chilli powder and cumin in the same pot I had used to saute the onions then poured it over the jasmine rice and veggies in a 7" wide square baking dish, covered with foil and followed the baking directions. The rice came out fluffy and tasted amazing! A perfect side dish to my roasted chicken thighs. Thanks for showing how to bake rice to perfection.

I cook a lot of meals for our local homeless community, so making 3 huge steamers of rice (that's like nine 9x13's!)  used to mean rice was in my hair, my ears, all over my kitchen by the time I made enough for 100 peeps ! This recipe has been A game changer and SO versatile. I make it "plain",  I've made it 'spanish' adding tomatoes, chilies and balancing the liquids; add brocolli and chopped chicken (top with cheese while it rests),   still plan to try adding some  Red beans and some sausage for a meal version!  THANK YOU for this one. OH and VERY IMPORTANT is to seal the pan- the steam cooks the rice ! I actually use heavyt duty plastic wrap as a first layer sealed THEN heavy duty foil (or the foil lids that come with disposable pans @ Sams) over that sealed tight. I know it sounds scary to put plastic wrap in the oven, but keep it under 350 degrees and it works - I PROMISE!

Ok...so the rating came from my 7 yr old, who loves rice in almost any form. 

I followed the recipe, although I was a little concerned about the liquid to rice ratio. I didn't have peppers, but I had broccoli, which I added. No saffron, but I added tumeric to it instead. Everyone loved it! I was informed by the child to "please put carrots in next time!" So, that will be our change. I can see this being a "go to" recipe when we want something different. Thank you!

Well if we could screw up rice we did!  We did the recipe as written except we used long grain brown rice.  When we unwrapped it for the dinner, it was still floating in broth.  We were very disappointed but I think that it was totally related to the fact that is was brown rice and also maybe not the best quality rice.  We had to put it in a pot and bring it to a boil and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.  Still crunchy but edible.  Anyways, flavour was good and I will try again with better quality rice and long grain white rice.

I made this dish to go with bbq’d pork ribs and carrots. I had my mom over and her, my husband and I loved it! Mom asked me for the recipe. Very easy and I didn’t have the saffron the first time I made it but the second night I made another batch because I had so many ribs leftover and this time I added the saffron. Both ways were delicious!  If I had to choose,  I would add the saffron because it added a bit more flavour and a nice bit of colour to the dish. Thanks for providing me with an easy and quick side dish!

Fantastic! I made it exactly to the recipe, and it ended up being the star of the meal.  I didn't even care about the meat on my plate - this rice was delicious, and FOOL proof!  I used basmati rice and every grain was separate and fluffy.  I'll be making this 2-3x a month, for sure!

Wow! This recipe and technique is simple yet perfect. I never thought to cook rice in the oven, but this is the best rice I ever made. My son and I both couldn't get enough. I omit the cayenne because my baby doesn't like spicy food, but I don't think the rice needed it anyways.

I make this exactly as the recipe states and it is our family favorite! This is perfect to make with berbecued meats, I can put it in the oven while I am grilling and the rice can sit for a few minutes without any harm.

The rice did not have enough liquid and part of it came out crunchy. It had interesting flavor but not interesting enough to try it again. I would recommend the stove top for anyone trying it.

I made this recipe by the directions and it came out underdone and salty. I tried cooking it another 30 minutes and it still wasn't done. Besides the salt, it did taste good but next time I'll save on time and dishes and just use one pot.

So delicious. Didn’t have saffron. I’m sure it would elevate it even more but truly it’s rice perfection. Still don’t understand people that totally change the recipe and then review it poorly. I ignore those.

Made this again.  This time with white rice.  I made in my rice cooker.  I cooked the onion first in the butter/oil, and then mixed with rice.  Pour broth and spices over rice in the rice cooker.  Came out nicely cooked.  Could punch this up a bit with the addition of some parmesan.  Very good to serve with chicken dishes.
So... I found out you cannot make this with brown basmati rice.  It never gets soft.  I had it in the oven for over an hour, eventually had to toss it.  The odd thing ... although the rice was  crunchy it was delicious!  Will try again with white rice and re-review.  Just wanted to warn others to stay away from brown rice for this recipe.

Its a family favorite here, I followed the recipe, I only did a little of the cayenne pepper cause I'm cooking for kids who don't likeI also added peas and carrots for colour and instead of saffron I used a dash if paprika, it makes a good portion for my family giving me left overs for lunch for my husband and myself the next day, its a winner for us!

Wonderful and tasty.  Followed recipe.  You need to let it rest for that 10 minutes and it comes out perfect.It seems to finish cooking in that 10 minutes of resting. Have made it 2 times and will be making it again.

I loved this baked recipe. Glad I read other reviews because I too felt the proportion of rice to liquid wasn't what I was used to! It almost killed me to keep it as is! Glad I did because the texture of the cooked rice was perfect. I wasn't keen on the flavor hence my 4 stars. I will definitely make again with different flavorings.
The key is to tightly wrap the foil and to let it stand for 10 mins without undoing the foil. Again I found this hard!! I was so curious!! Again, glad I left it because it was worked and it was great. I looked beautiful too. The cayenne is strong and the saffron is subtle. May as well use turmeric as the saffron gave a beautiful golden color however the flavor was lost. Turmeric gives color without the expense of saffron!

This came our perfect! My "go to" white rice is Rice Select Arborio Italian style rice in the plastic "jar". It improves all recipes, but takes a lot of time and attention. This recipe has pretty much the same ingredients as the standard Arborio recipe, but needs less attention.

I am the worst at making rice, so I was eager to try this recipe.  The flavor was overall very good, but next time I will cut back on the salt and add a little more liquid.  It was a bit to salty and the rice a tad crunchy for my taste.

I cut this back to 4 portions but otherwise I made it exactly as written, including the saffron. This cooking method produced a beautifully fluffy rice and the timing was bang on.  However, we both found that it lacked flavour. I will use this cooking method again but I will definitely add herbs.

I made this dish! But like Christina said below, I didn't see the need to use the oven and do all the extra steps and use all the different pans for a small amount of food. I think it would have made sense to cook in the oven for a very large party. So, I decided to cook the rice on the stove, using all the same ingredients except I used paprika instead of cayenne pepper and brown rice instead of white rice (I didn't have white rice at home) I also added frozen peas and carrots for color and veggies. I must say it came out perfectly and tasted really really good. My family ate it all, not knowing it was brown rice!

I halved the recipe and it came out perfect.!! (I didn't have the saffron.) Can I use the same ratio of stock  to rice if I use Basmatic rice instead of long grain (ie. 2 cups rice to 3 cups 
stock). I can't seem to make Basmatic on the stovetop.
I've given up trying to make perfect Indian style Basmati on the stovetop, but Basmatic pilaf in the oven sounds great!

Could not be easier. 
Very tasty. I don't keep saffron in the house & am out of cayenne, but I don't think the end product suffered at all. It made quite a bit for three of us, but the leftovers didn't go to waste. Will definitely make again.

After reading the reviews, I upped the stock to 3.5 cups, decreased the salt to 1 tsp and the cayenne pepper to 1/8th of a tsp. I couldn't find any saffron so I didn't use it. I decided to use bacon grease instead of olive oil and thought I might as well toss in the cooked bacon as well. I simmered the chicken stock and salt/pepper in the same pan I used to cook the onions.  Came out fabulous. Will definitely make it again. Husband loved it too!

Perfect!  Prep did not take long, and the result was perfect.  My only deviation from the recipe was not adding the saffron.  None of my family are big rice eaters, but this was a hit, and we will most definitely make it again!

I made this for my social studies class and they LOVED it. Mine was slightly soggy though. My problem was that i used bagged rice and boiled that first and then baked it with every thing on it.

This  recipe is a keeper!  I reduced the cayenne by half, hesitated briefly with the 3 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of rice then proceeded as written.  The finished product is not colourful but the flavour and texture of the cooked rice  made it a big hit.  I was surprised how good it was!!  I also really appreciate the oven cooking method - so easy for entertaining especially if you already have the oven in use.

Best rice I've ever cooked! I have been looking for a good recipe for cooking rice so it is not so sticky. With lots of rice eaters in my family, I've tried many recipes and methods. This is now my go-to recipe for rice. I omit the onions, saffron, and pepper for a plain and simple dish to deliciously accompany any entree.

This is the best way to make rice....ever!  I even gave away my rice maker!!  So good to make for company, and heats up well. I didn't have saffron, so used Turmeric and a little paprika. Sure had a lot of compliments over dinner.

This is a very good rice pilaf. I followed the recipe and needed more liquid. Tasted great, the rice was nice and fluffy which I don't usually get on the stove top. Will make this again.

this was my first time making rice that wasn't plain white with soy sauce or butter and I have to say I was impressed. both my boyfriend and i went back for seconds, twice. I used more cayenne pepper, but we like things spicy, so I add spice to everything anyways. I also didn't have chicken bullion to make enough chicken, and we were making ribs for dinner, so I did a chicken / beef mixture for the broth. Will definitely be making another batch tomorrow for the bbq we are having.

I have used this recipe multiple times since I found I over a year ago.  If you follow the directions and not try to tweak, it is fantastic.  Some critics have complained that there are too many pots and pans involved.  I used one small casserole dish as the recipe calls for  and one medium saute skillet which was rinsed and clean within one minute after use.    This recipe turns out perfect every time.  I'm not sure why naples34102 dogged it so much since she never bothered to make it before totally berating it?  I found that response annoying and pompous as well.  Thanks for the great recipes Chef John.  As a side note, I have noticed several comments about cutting the recipe size in have due to there only being two people in the home.  This rice freezes perfectly in a freezer safe zip loc bag and when ready to use the left over just thaw for a bit until it separates loosely and transfer to a microwave safe bowl, cover with a damp kitchen towel and cook for 1-1/2 mins  and voila it's just as good the second time around.

Needs at least 10 more minutes cook time. After the 45 minute cook time much of the rice was still hard. Have to give it a star cause it seems like a good idea, but instructions are wrong.

I didn't have saffron, so I had to leave it out. I didn't cook it in the oven, because it's too hot outside right now, so I cooked it on the stove top. It was really great and simple. Went very well with our fish filets. Will keep for my rice side from now on.  Thanks Chef John!

Recently, I've been on an 80% gluten free diet. I've always been more of a pasta fan, but this rice recipe makes me love rice now! I can eat this food without the bloat and there is just the right amount of butter. I love the chicken stock taste! I even added some baby spinach for more color and it cooked beautifully with the ample chicken stock. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!

I am so pleased with the results of using this oven method for making rice pilaf!  I am going to have a get together with several guests and was trying to minimize the amount of attention that things in the kitchen required.  I am not someone who spends a lot of time in the kitchen and when I am cooking, I usually have to give it my full attention or bad things happen!  So, the idea of mixing something up with minimal preparation and letting the oven do the rest really appealed to me.   I did make an adjustment that some may think changes the dish a lot, but I was trying to decide between this recipe and a stove top recipe that incorporated orzo into the pilaf, as well.  I love orzo and since the recipes were very similar with the exceptions of one being on the stove and one being in the oven, and of course one having a rice and orzo mixture with this one having just rice, I decided to substitute 1 cup of the rice in this recipe with one cup of orzo.  I browned the orzo with the onion on the stove, then mixed that with the regular rice and stock, and popped it in the oven.  I held my breath while waiting for the dish to rest after taking it out of the oven since I had no idea how well orzo pasta would work in place of the rice.  It turned out perfect!  I was very pleased with the texture.  Next time, I may cut back a bit on the cayenne because I am a total wimp when it comes to heat, but I don't think most "normal" people would have any problem with the little kick it gives t

. To save dirtying another pan, I cook the onion in the Olive oil and butter in the casserole dish while the oven heats.. I give it an initial boost of 1 minute in the microwave. Works great.Tonight I am serving it with slow cooker Havana style pork tenderloin from this site, as I have done several times before.

5.5.16  Nothing not to like about this recipe, and its 5-star rating after so many reviews  is well deserved.  I didn't have any saffron and did cut back on the cayenne a bit, but was pleased with the way this turned out.

I have made this rice a few times and it's my daughter's fav. I do not have chicken stock so I boil 3.5 cup of water in a saucepan. Once it boils, I add cayenne pepper and 2 cubes of chicken bouillon and a pinch of tumeric powder. I didnt add the salt. I also use 1 whole onion instead of 1/2. Then I cook it as per the instructions. After the 10-min resting period, I sprinkle chopped cilantro and mix into the rice thoroughly. The flavor of the herbs goes really well. This rice has become one of fav recipes.

Used an entire onion and added a little garlic powder as per other review.  The texture and flavour were great.  Have saved this as good for company.

It tasted really good, though I sometimes made it very hard by accident. I didn't use saffron. I made it about ten or more times before I got tired of eating it over and over again!

This recipe seemed too simple to be this savory. I make this in my cast iron skillet that has a lid. I sauté the onion in the olive oil and butter, but I also add slivered or sliced almonds. Then I add the rice and sauté it until it starts to turn golden brown. Then the chicken stock, and when it comes to a boil, I put the lid on the skillet and put it on the oven for 30-35 minutes. Not only is this rice excellent, but the leftovers are great for making fried rice. And it's versatile. You can add anything to it.

I love this rice and have made it a regular side in our house! I use 4 tablespoons butter because I thought the oil gave it an oily mouthfeel the first time I made it but the flavor both ways is fantastic.  For those considering leaving out the cayenne I say don't, my 5 year and 1 year old gobble this up and ask for seconds, it's not spicy and it adds nice flavor. Thank you for this recipe!

I have never cooked before, and I decided to make dinner that included this dish. Not only is this the only thing that turned out well in my meal (oops... haha), but it tasted amazing regardless. I halved the recipe and decided to not add the cayenne pepper, and I also forgot to keep the pan covered for 10 mins after I took it out of the oven (oops again), and this tasted great. Even for someone who has never cooked before, this dish is not too difficult and will blow everybody away. Someone commented to me that this is the best rice dish they have ever had! I completely recommend making this dish!

I liked the flavor.  I cut back the salt a bit and didn't miss it .  No saffron. It did come out a bit crunchy though, so I would add more liquid next time.  A little boring to look at.  Might try with wild rice or add some peas and carrots for color.

A great recipe.  My daughter loved it.  I reviewed other comments and adjusted the recipe as follows:
- I used unsalted butter;
- I used 1/4 teaspoon of salt
- 1 used 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
- I added a teaspoon of salted butter just before serving.
Delicious.  :-)

Always comes out great. Nice and simple, but flavorful rice. Using the oven probably does make it a bit more complex, but it is also easier and frees up room on the stove for other items you're cooking.

I didn't have Cayanne pepper or saffron but otherwise I used all the same ingredients. Instead of doing on the stove I combined it all in my rice cooker and it was so easy and so good!

A really easy way to do rice.  I also didn't have saffron so used a tsp. of  turmeric.  Also didn 't have peas, so used corn.  This could easily be adapted to your flavor preferences- curry,  various veggies, etc.   Delicious.

Yummy!  made it as written and it was great. Didn't have the saffron so didn't use it. Perfectly cooked rice. Fantastic consistency.  Will make again and play with the ingredients.  Thanks Chef John.

This was a great recipe, it was the first time I had made rice in the oven and it turned out perfect.  You can see the potential to easily vary the recipe.  I halved the recipe like others since I was cooking for two.  I did use the saffron and added a little turmeric and carrots.

I love this!! I used paprika (1/2 tsp) and chili powder (1 and 1 half tsp) just because I didnt have saffron or cayenne and thought it was amazing!
i also used Valencia (paella rice) due to realizing mid way I didn't have long grain, and it turned out delish anyway!

I made this for my main dish by adding some chicken I cooked up and baked it all together! It turned out amazing! I omitted the salt, saffron, and onions. It was salty enough from the chicken broth added. I cooked 3 chicken breasts and seasoned them with cayenne pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Having seasoned the chicken with cayenne pepper I didn't add too much to the rice mixture. Love this recipe, even as a side dish! So good and I love how the rice doesn't stick together!!??

SUPER SIMPLE.  Super easy.  I loved being able to pop it into the oven and walk away for 35 minutes.  I didn't add saffron as I didn't have any, but the cayenne pepper was delish.  Not too spicy, but just perfect.   Great recipe that I will use again and again as an easy side dish!  Thanks!!  No more Riceroni  (sp?) for us.

No changes made on this one and my wife and I enjoyed the rice. We have had not much luck with rice cookers and a hit and miss on the stove top. This was spot on. I think I will turn up the heat (spice)a little next time. (no saffron) Could have made half as much but used it in Chicken fried rice a couple of days later  and enjoyed it again.

I used home made chicken broth so I upped the salt by 1/2 tsp as I don't put  salt in my broth, also added about 1 tbl chopped fresh parsley. Why haven't I made this before now?! I will never make rice pilaf any other way again- so easy and so flavorful- my only regret is not knowing about this sooner...

First time I have been able to make Rice like this! Easy recipe, but I had to leave it in the oven for about an hour, something I had actually left time for, so it was ready when the wife got home from work. Usually Minute Rice is her thing, but she enjoyed it as well, and will now come in very handy. I think next time though, I will not use as much Cayenne as I did, as I used a heaping 1/4 teaspoon lol!

Very GOOD recipe!!!!!!!! I will be making this recipe again! Although it is a tad spicy and will reduce the amount of pepper (mainly because of my little ones). Personally I loved it as is!

I make this recipe often for me and my hubby.  We usually play around with spices to match what we are having with it.  I add green peas to make it colorful and leftovers makes an easy fried rice.

I was worried about how the rice would cook in the oven, if it would be mushy.  It was the perfect texture!  Very yummy recipe that I make often now.

I halved the recipe, added more veggies (carrots, peppers) ;  didn't heat the stock mixture but just stirred it all together in a casserole dish and baked it .  Easy and delicious.

Yummy in my tummy was what the kids were chanting!!! I made the recipe exactly as written except for the saffron (I just do not have that spice at the moment. I also used brown rice and only a pinch of cayenne pepper. Definitely a must make again.

We love this dish. It lends itself to variations based on what you have on the pantry. We did add a while onion and about the same amount of chopped bell peppers. Any color is fine. We also added one chicken breast thawed and cut into bite sized pieces. We just put it on top of the rice before we added the stock to the baking dish. It's now an easy one dish meal and one of our favorites!

Sooo good! I add diced chicken into the baking pan and 1/2 tsp. turmeric. Don't omit the saffron (unless you don't have it), it makes such a difference.

This is fantastic, I'll never eat rice any other way again! Chef John you have provided me and my family with so many delightful recipes. Thank you again! Ok here's my tweaks to the recipe: I used regular black pepper, only 1 teaspoon of salt rather than the 1 1/2 suggested. Also I switch back and fourth depending on what I have on hand as far a the chicken stock goes so I sometimes sub with bullion cubes or powder and I don't use the cookie sheet, the rice comes out with less liquid that way.

We are a gluten free family. So glad to find a pilaf recipe without the traditional orzo pasta incorporated. There were definite raves and seconds at dinner. I heard my daughter sneaking down to the kitchen later that night to consume the remaining leftovers before her siblings could. Will definitely make this in a larger quantity and freeze for a second use.

This made this recipe to go with grilled steak kabobs and shrimp kabobs.  I added 1/2 a red pepper diced, one carrot shredded and a handful of baby peas.  The rice was perfect.  It turned out absolutely perfect.

Made this with brown rice in a rice cooker and it turned out really well. I used half the salt, and added a handful of minced parsley, toasted almonds, and some lemon to the cooked rice. Next time I'll omit the cayenne ... It just didn't fit the flavor I was going for. Overall, a delicious and east side dish.

Good overall except too much cayenne (7 out of 8 people thought so).  Will make again but with less cayenne, then a 4 star.

I’ve made this recipe three times now. Each time it turns out very well, but not perfect for us. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe and video stated. It was perfectly cooked and fluffy, but too much cayenne for my husband. I thought it was ok but not spectacular. The second time I cut the cayenne in half, but that time it seemed very bland to me. No one had seconds. Therefore, for method I give it five stars, but need to tweak the flavor. The third time I made these changes. I browned the rice in butter and evoo. I skipped the saffron. Added 2 stalks of celery (chopped finely), 1 sm carrot (grated), and 4 small mini sweet peppers (chopped finely) to the onion sauté. I was a little worried about the extra oil from browning the rice but it didn’t seem too greasy. For seasoning, I used 1/8 tsp cayenne and 1 ½ teaspoon ranch dressing mix instead of salt. This time a hit! Everyone had seconds but added extra salt. Next time I will double the amount of ranch dressing mix. The rice was al dente (not crunchy). We prefer our rice softer. I forgot to heat the broth. Maybe if it was hot when added to the rice the rice would have turned out softer. I don’t know if browning the rice made it harder or if using cold broth made the difference. I'll just have to try again. Poor me :) I love this recipe--it is sooo worth playing with to make it perfect for us. I have learned so much from Chef John, and this rice cooking method is the most valuable.

Great recipe! I used Turmeric as a substitute for the saffron and it came out wonderful. I will cut the salt to one tsp next time just for a slightly less salty taste. Thank you for sharing this recipe. So easy and the taste was amazing.

I don't usually review recipes BUT this one turned out so perfectly that I had to.  This rice was delicious and was not sticky.  I did take one reviewer's advice and used 3 and 1/2 cups of chicken broth (rather than chicken stock) instead of 3. Also did not have the saffron and didn't add any cayenne pepper. I used a little black pepper.  Absolutely perfect rice pilaf.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Came out great. Whole family liked it. (family of picky eaters and texture issues). Used an organic Wildtree veggie bullion + 3 cups of water instead of chicken stock.

This is good.  I also like to take 1 part regular rice and 1 part wild rice and follow the same recipe and it turns out really good too!

I will never make rice on the stove top ever again!  This was amazing and the rice turned out perfect. It wasn't sticky at all. Full of flavor and made for a nice presentation. Can't wait to try making brown rice this way.

I hate cooking long grain rice, but this was magical. I read a review that says all of these steps were unnecessary. Well, she said so herself, she didn't try it. How can she rate it fairly then?  To me, it was a lot less stress. I did change up the recipe due to what I had on hand. I used a bag of frozen onions and bell peppers, then I added some peas and carrots. I didn't have the saffron, but I did use the cayenne and used kosher salt. It was fabulous and a huge hit with the family!  Sometimes taking a little more time and effort yields far better results.

I have made this a couple of times for my family and they love it. It a tasty and easy recipe. I like the fact that I can put this together and put it in the oven and forget it. And freezing the leftovers is even better. Thanks Chef John!!

My oven cooked it perfectly, I did cut the recipe in half, 1 cup rice, 1 3/4 cup stock, 1/16 cayenne (don't like overly hot food)  everything else the same. Came out perfect, not greasy, not burnt, and not dry. Next time will add green onions on top or mix a veggie in to make it more interesting. But understand this is a basic rice recipe-do what you want with it.

This recipe was alright. I didn't have any saffron, but next time I would add a few things for flavour like green peppers and other seasonings. I found the rice/liquid ratio to be way off and used only 1.5 cups of rice with 3 cups of chicken stock, it still turned out too dry.

Only changes we made were to use low sodium chicken stock. We used a cast iron pot with it's own lid and it comes out wonderful. We have used this recipe several times now and love it. It's so simple!

This was a solid hit with my shishkabob dinner.  I doubled the recipe as I had a party of eight, and it was complimented by everyone here, even my son's picky-eater girlfriend.  I did cut up some fresh spring onions as a topping, but that was the only variation I put on the recipe.  

My wife has told me that this only tested out at about 3 points per serving on Weight Watchers, so I will definitely be doing this one again.

Love this rice!  Made this rice for a family BBQ and there was none left.  What a hit.  Followed the recipe exactly, so yummy.  I think I would call this yellow rice instead of rice pilaf but who cares, it was delicious!

This was fabulous and easy! Big hit at my dinner party. My husband avoids rice at all costs but liked this dish! I did not add the saffron because of the cost but I know it would be a great addition. I have always made rice on the stove top and it was always with a hit or miss result. This is a keeper! I followed recipe as is and it was perfect.

I have made this recipe over and over again. My kids love it. I used a whole onion just so the other half didn't go to waste and found that was perfect so I say half an onion is not enough. I used 2 knorr chicken stock cubes and added them to 4 cups of water. I used basmati rice and i found that 3 cups of water was not nearly enough so I made it 4. I also didn't put the salt in since there is already a lot of salt in the cubes and i used salted butter as well. Definitely spend the money on the saffron, it makes a huge difference. With all these changes it turned out great!!

Very easy and very tasty.  I used brown rice because that's what I had and vegetable stock to keep it vegetarian, but that was the only change.  It got complements and every bite was gone at the end of the meal.  Definitely a keeper.

No more sticky or hard rice!  Delicious; the kids love it.
I find the rice a little "greasy" so will try halving the oil and butter next time.
A nice basic recipe that's easy to change-up.

Awesome! I've made this rice in France without the saffron and cayenne (didn't have any!) and then at home with all the ingredients and both are fantastic. Friends in France made me make it several times until we were sick of it! Great flavours and texture and pretty much foolproof. Highly recommended.

Yum!!  This will be one of my new go to sides.  Beautiful and delicious!  I am accustomed to the ease of a rice cooker, so I was wary of how long this might actually take (overcooking or undercooking).  I followed Chef John's recipe exactly--35 minutes without removing foil.  Voila! I did not have any saffron, but I bet it's even better with it.  Thanks, Chef John!

Liked very much. I hate sticky, gummy rice (my husband loves it -- blech), so this one was for me. I tossed in a can of green chiles to flavor it up a bit, but honestly the flavor seemed to have cooked right out of the chiles.  Next time I'll put them in when the rice is done. I'll definitely make it again, especially if we're having company.

This rice is very good and easy. Instead of mixing the broth and the rice together in the baking dish I heated the broth in a separate pan and once it boiled poured it in the sauce pan with the rice. I then poured all into the baking dish. Baked exactly as written. Perfect.

My husband said it was the best rice I ever made!  I halved the recipe and perhaps next time would use a bit less margarine.
Thanks for a great rice dish! I can't wait to make it again!

This makes perfect rice every time. It also works well as an all-in-one-pot meal. I diced some chicken breasts and browned them with the butter and olive oil and onions. Before baking, I added pre-blanched vegetables, some frozen peas, and parsley. My husband complimented me on the dinner.

This was great. I used basmati rice and omitted the salt (figured I could add it later if it needed it- which it didn't) and the saffron just because I didn't have it. I ALWAYS screw up rice and thought this would be no different. My fiance couldn't stop raving about it and ended up eating so much of it that he couldn't finish his chicken :)  This would also be good with more veggies in it. Maybe next time I will add peas or bell peppers...

Made tonight according to directions, except I added a little bit of chopped up carrot (because I like carrots in my rice pilaf).  I cooked the carrot pieces with the onion.  I was really excited, because I have been disappointed by bland rice pilaf before.  This was good, but it didn't blow me away.  The rice was a perfect texture and the amount of cooking liquid seems to be perfect.  However, it seemed to be still lacking something.  I used homemade chicken stock, which I have found to be less salty, so perhaps I need more salt or seasonings.  I've only ever made rice on the stove before; this was convenient because I was already using the oven for the meat.  I will only make this again if I need the convenience of not having something on the stove.

This rice is amazing! I followed the recipe without the addition of saffron because I didn't have any. I can only imagine the saffron would make it even better. Anyway, definitely give it a shot. It is so worth it!

I have been using this recipe for about a year and it comes out perfect every time!  I use smoked basmati rice simply because I love the smell and flavor of this particular rice.  I make a batch and sometimes I will add leftover chicken pieces prior to baking.  Sometimes, using the leftover rice, I will get out my wok, add whatever I have on hand and make chicken fried rice.  It works every time and I haven't been disappointed yet. Thanks, Jon!

Turned out perfect.  I stuck it in the oven with Wolf's Bourbon Chicken for a easy weeknight meal.  The only change I made was to omit the salt.  I knew my chicken would be salty and didn't want to go overboard.

I can never cook long grain rice without it sticking at the bottom of the pot, even if I'm very careful not to put the heat too high. This recipe makes very delicious rice, that's cooked to perfection. Very easy, very tasty, with a touch of pizazz! Made it a few times, and will certainly keep on doing it!

My family loved this recipe! They could not get enough and all went back for seconds. I am pretty sure they would have licked the dish clean if they could. This recipe was so easy with very rewarding results.
