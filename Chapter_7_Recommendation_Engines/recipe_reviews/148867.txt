This is a WONDERFUL base recipe, and so versatile. I make it (for myself, for lunch) at least once a week. I bake it "crustless" in a pyrex pie plate (which I "grease" with Olive Oil) because I don't particularly care for "prepared" pie crusts. I like it with Blue Cheese Dressing, but Ranch works nicely, too. I LOVE the Tuna/Spinach/Bacon mix, but (pre-cooked) boneless chicken breast (instead of tuna) works well, too. I LOVE Swiss chees, but sometimes I use Provolone, Velveeta or Pepperjack. Sometimes I include chopped onions, scallions, fresh mushrooms and/or bell peppers. One "pie" lasts me 2 or 3 days. Sometimes I make toast, sometimes I have Saltine or Ritz Crackers with it. Regardless, it's ALWAYS good.

The quiche was ok.  I believe it would have had a better flavor without the blue cheese.

I really liked this recipe; great new application for tuna. I did use fresh spinach as opposed to frozen because it is what I had on hand, but I don't think that changed the integrity of the recipe. I do agree with another reviewer that there was not enough egg to make it have the true mouth feel of a quiche. So next time I will add two more eggs and skip the cornstarch. Thanks Ms. Kitti for posting this recipe!

This was okay...but I never could quite adjust to the taste of the blue cheese with the tuna...also it didn't seem very quiche-like with only two eggs...

Newbie at AllRecipes so I took a pic after I cut it thinking it wouldn't post.  WRONG!  Great recipe... start.  I sauteed mushrooms, garlic, onions with the spinach and bacon!  I was afraid to add the tuna and dressing at that point so I basically have a spinach, bacon and swiss cheese quiche.  I also added a small mixture of mixed cheddar cheeses at the bottom.  Like others, I reduced the milk.  I browned the pie crust for 10 minutes only because my hubby likes it that way.  I really like it and I look forward to trying this again over the holidays!  I rate it a 4 but I'm sure an upgrade is coming soon!
