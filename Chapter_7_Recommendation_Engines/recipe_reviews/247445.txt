I did double the vinaigrette, but otherwise no changes.  It was awesome!  I will definitely make this again!

This is a very eye appealing salad that has  a fresh garden taste. the recipe called for vinegar but didn't specify which type. I thought white vinegar would be too strong so I used red wine vinegar and it was perfect. I didn't have an outdoor grill so I buttered the corn and placed it on a foil lined baking sheet under the broiler in my oven. Worked just as well. I omitted the basil, because I don't like it.  I have made a similar recipe before and my daughter didn't like it , but  she gave this one a big thumbs up. I will definitely save and make this again.
