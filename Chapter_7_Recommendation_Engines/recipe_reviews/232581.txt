This recipe was delicious. I put the chicken and all the other ingredients besides the egg in the blender and it speeded up the prep time by quite a bit. These are the only wontons my husband will eat because they are very lean.  The only thing I would add next time is some cracked pepper.  Other then that it is already a new favorite in our house.

I really like this. Chicken is sometimes bland but this was excellent. My only problem was that the filling didn't bind quite how I wabted it to. I also put more fillings in the wrapper than suggested. I steamed half and fried the other half. I prefer steamed wontons but both were good.

I used these wontons in a simple chicken broth with scallions soup. Perfect for a sick kid .

These wontons are excellent!! We tried them fried and boiled in soup and BOTH were excellent! These are much better than the frozen wontons you can buy and are so delicious.  My husband and 7 yr old son wouldn't stop talking about them. This recipe will definitely be in my regular meal rotation to use in my wonton soup.  The recipe is so versatile, you could really add veggies such as carrots or mushrooms and it would be even better.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

I added 1/2 carrot that I julienned into the stock before I added the wontons and it was a nice addition.

Too much sesame oil, it was disgusting if you are going to make it us 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and the tablespoon it calls for, would not try this recipe again.

If you're making your own wrappers DO NOT BOIL I used my recipe for the wrappers and upon boiling them they fell apart and left a gooey mess in the bottom of my pot.

I used cooked chicken because it was handy. The Wontons turned out great and even impressed my very skeptical millennials. This will be a 'go to' recipe.
