This recipe has become a staple at our house, only I use skim milk instead of the water and whole grain instant brown rice.  I also cut up the chicken into cubes and brown slightly before adding to the baking dish.  The mexican blend shredded cheese works great even if you don't like the chili powder in it.  One other helpful hint is to mix the soup and milk together and add the rice, then pour over chicken in casserole dish.

Great, easy recipe.  I use chicken broth instead of water for added flavor.  Plus, I don't usually keep onion powder on hand, so I use a seasoning blend like Emeril's or Montreal seasoning.  Whatever I'm in the mood for.  My family loves this one.

I made this using Cream of Chicken with Herbs so it took care of seasoning the chicken (which I think is a critical part of this recipe that many overlook based on comments).  I used chicken broth instead of water and I cut the chicken into large chunks and mixed it into the soup mixture rather than laying whole breasts out on top. I did not add salt and don’t think anyone needs to given the amount of salt in the condensed soup.  I greased the bottom of the pan a bit with some butter then threw in the fresh green beans and mushrooms (my choice for this dish). Then I poured the soup mixture in. Prior to cooking, I topped it with a sprinkling of garlic powder, a little bit of shredded cheddar, parmesan and bacon bits. Cooked for the 45 min. and everything was nicely cooked. YUM!!

This recipe was easy, but the rice was not done in 45 minutes - I had to put it back in for another 20 minutes.  I'd advise cooking for an hour covered. I added extra seasoning - onion & garlic powders, pepper, paprika - and it was still a bit bland.  Also, not so great reheated for leftovers - rice and chicken dried out.

My husband actually made this, and he does not like to cook.  It turned out GREAT.  We added fresh broccoli and canned corn for the veggies.  Instead of the cream of chicken soup, we put in broccoli cheese soup.  He also added two cubes of chicken boullion to the water.  It was sooo tasty!

This is a very tasty dish that takes only a few minutes to throw together and pop in the oven.  It's perfect when you come home from a long day and don't feel like slaving away in the kitchen, but still want a homemade meal.

I was all out of onion powder, so I substituted garlic powder instead which added a nice flavor.  I also used long-grain brown rice instead of white to make it even healthier.

I'll definitely be making this recipe again and again.

Growing up we ate a lot of "poor man" meals, and this was a weekly staple at our home.  My mother's recipe was very similar to this, and as I remember, it was quite bland as well (made better only by cheese salt and pepper)....  I've since updated and revised her recipe just a tad.  This makes for the most incredible tasting casserole and is even easier this way...  I used chicken thighs, only because I prefer dark meat.  Rather than using cream of chicken, I use cream of mushroom soup.  Instead of white rice, I use a package of Knorr Chicken Rice side.  Garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion powder on the chicken, and there is NO issue with it being bland!  The chicken rice side has so much flavoring that combined with the chicken and soup, it makes this absolutely awesome.......

Ok, so it's not gourmet and I resorted to this because I was simply NOT going to stand over a hot stove tonight.  But it's full of veggies and lean protein, clean up is minimal, and all I had to do was pull it out of the oven and plop it on the table.  This will not go down in the hall of fame for great meals I've prepared but it did its duty.  I used chicken broth instead of water, threw in a big dollop of sour cream, and topped with bread crumbs instead of cheese.  So the family was not pouring on the compliments but I have to admit that our table has probably not seen the last of this easy weeknight meal.

We all liked this.  I made the "italian" version because some reviews said the original recipe lacked flavour. I used homemade chicken stock in place of the water and the local grocery store was out of plain cream of chicken soup so we used cream of chicken and white wine. We did not find it bland at all. Will make this again but will part boil the rice first.  This time the rice didn't cook fully, even after an hour of cooking and me adding extra liquid during cooking.  Also I will cube the chicken breast and mix it in with the rice & soup to cook.

Based on the reviews of this recipe I thought it would be very good, however it was pretty bland! I had to MAKE my boyfriend take the leftovers to work the next day, which is unusual for him! haha.  Maybe it needs more cream of chicken soup?  It needs SOMETHING!  It WAS easy though!!

****MMM!! is what I heard over & over again with this recipe. I did saute' my cubed chicken breasts with a little seasoning and olive oil before adding it to the soup mixture, and used chicken broth instead of water. Also, took another reviewers' advice and used instant rice....had no problems with rice being undercooked. After baking for 30 minutes I topped it with the cheese and some crushed french-fried onions, and baked another 10 min. I let it stand about 15 minutes and it was perfect. Excellent recipe, I will make this often! Thanks! :)

This was a tasty casserole for a weeknight supper when there isn't a lot of time for fussy cooking.I browned the chicken breasts slightly before adding to the casserole and spiced them with roasted red pepper and garlic. I also added seasoned salt, a little garlic powder and some tarragon to the soup mixture. I used fresh broccoli florets for the vegetable. My 4 year old grandson is VERY difficult to feed and he ate it, so that is good for a star or two.

We Loved this recipe. Will use it again. Of course I read reviews before making any dish. Previous cooks leave the best ideas. Hence, I replaced water with chicken broth, used fresh zucchini & kernel corn instead of frozen veggies.  Also, I pounded the chicken to tenderize before seasoning and laying on top of rice mixture. Only 2 pieces of chicken fit in the baking dish, but each piece was thoroughly cooked and delicious. Added 20 minutes to cooking time and let sit for an additional 15 minutes before serving letting all the liquid absorb into the rice kernels. WOW, delightfully good.

My family loves this. I have made some alterations though. 2 cups water or chicken broth instead of the 1 1/3 cups of water. Dice the chicken. For the veggies, I use two bags of frozen California mix veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, carrots), I add 1 tsp garlic, 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp salt. I mix everything together in a 13X9 cake pan. I dont cover when baking. Last 5 minutes top with shredded cheese and 1 can French's French Fried Onions.  This recipe works well substituting the Cream of Chicken Soup with Cream of Mushroom Soup as well.

I find it easier to always cook the rice first on it's own and if you enjoy more flavor, cook the rice in chicken broth. Then mix the already cooked rice with all the other ingredients. So i won't find the recipe bland, i cut up pieces of velveeta cheese so its melts within the rice while cooking (this will help prevent it from tasting dry sometimes) and then i'll also add more chicken broth or a little more cream of chicken to satisfy my taste. Instead of cooking it for only 45 minutes also, i like to keep the heat low and cook it for a couple of overs and slowly over the hours i will sprinkle grated cheese on top. it's delicious in the end and leftovers are always good!

My family loved this with the changes I made.  I used instant rice, 1% milk in place of water, I used mexican mix cheese, frozen chopped brocoli, some garlic, rosemary and basil in addition to the onion powder...all this made for a delicious and fragrant meal.

Okay so 4 stars as written, but if you use this as a jump-off recipe, 5 and beyond. Our family liked it just fine before I started to Frankenstein it, but now it's one of our favorites. I use chicken broth instead of water (1 regular-sized Campbell's can is perfect, or add boullion cubes) and I add Italian seasoning plus half a teaspoon Garlic powder. I never measure the cheese; in our family, too much is never enough. Also, I chop the chicken into bite-sized chunks and stir it in, instead of laying the breasts out on top. Sometimes, I can even get the kid to eat it. ;)

This was so good! But it needs a few minor adjustments. First (and this is a must), instead of water I used chicken broth. I think with all that water it would've been pretty bland. I also added salt and pepper to taste and I sprinkled paprika on the chicken. I also used minute rice and it cooked perfectly. I thought it was pretty darn tasty and it's soooo easy. I highly recommend it!

This recipe is not bad as written, but after making it the first time I did make changes the next time for a little more flavorful dish.  I subbed a tsp. of dried minced onion for the powder, and added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/8+ tsp. black pepper.  Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and brown well first in a little olive oil and 1 tsp. chicken bullion before mixing into all of the remaining ingredients except the cheese.  I like to use cream of celery in this rather than the cream of chicken, and I chose a package of thawed California blend veggies (carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower).  Put this mixture into sprayed casserole dish and top with the shredded cheese. Cover with foil to bake.  Remove the foil the last 10 minutes of baking if desired.  It sometimes takes a little longer to bake than what is specified.  I am always asked for this recipe when I take it somewhere, and there are never any leftovers!  Still nice and easy :)

YUM! This was my first dish as a young mom, new cook haha and it turned out flawless! Tips that really helped from the previous reviews was using the MINUTE rice to avoid rice still being hard after cook time......CHICKEN BROTH instead of water.......and a BUNCH of CHEESE on top! Easy easy I love it!

I've done this several times in several ways. Doing it the way the recipe describes makes undercooked, incredibly bland, chewy, depressing food. However, if you cook the rice in advance, and cook the chicken in advance (preferably cubed small and mixed in with the rice and vegetables) it turns out much more flavorful. Sure it adds a few extra steps so it no longer is a quick after-work meal, but if you have the time to pack that extra TLC and flavor in, DO IT. I also cook the rice with some chicken stock and I use broccoli cheddar soup cans instead of  the suggestion.

I do not know how this recipe got so popular.  It is very bland even with adding some extra seasoning. I will say that it IS easy and maybe that is the appeal? I wont be making this again.

I am seriously on 2nd hour of cooking this. :( The rice is still crunchy. I'm wondering if it's because of my altitude? If anyone masters a high-altitude version of this, let me know. I can tell it's going to taste great...when it's finally done cooking at midnight. :(

I make this quite a bit. I work nights, so it's super easy to mix together and throw in the oven while I'm getting ready. I do make a few changes though. I marinate the chicken in italian dressing, cut the chicken into cubes and throw in the extra marinade for extra flavor. I also use chicken stock instead of water, real onions instead of onion powder, and brown rice instead of white. It's not gourmet, but it definitely serves its purpose and is pretty tasty.

my  3 kids all like it and so do i and my husband for an easy, prepare early, pop in the oven meal. But the cooking time is WAY longer. Maybe 1 1/2 hours. And i have a gas oven and cut the chicken in smaller pieces.

This is a classic but always soo good! I love using the chicken broth instead of just water because it gives it so much more flavor! It's a regular on our dinner table!

HOW TO MAKE IT A 5 STAR: Rice is NOT cooked after the 45 minutes. Either use minute rice OR cook the rice before mixing together. ADD more spices, it was bland. Other than those changes, it was very easy to make.

This was an easy meal to throw together with what I already had in my kitchen.  I added some minced garlic and Frank's hot sauce since I knew my husband and I would need a little more flavor and "kick".  I did have to cook it an extra 15 minutes - the rice was still uncooked at 45.

I used the large can of cream of mushroom soup and beef stock instead of water. I also added about a cup of Parmesan cheese to the mixture and lots of garlic and onion powder, oregano and basil. I cut my chicken into bite size pieces. Had to cook it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe calls for because my rice wasn't done after 45 minutes. I then added the shredded cheese and mixed it in and it was delicious. I was really surprised how good it was.

I made this last night and my daughters absolutely loved it.  I used chicken broth instead of water, cooked the rice prior to as well as I browned the chicken in olive oil, seasoned the chicken.  The dish was not bland at all.  Very easy to make. I will definitely make this again!!

I'm a seasoned home cook & often make dinners from scratch. But my pantry always has Campbells soup in case.  This recipe works!  I buttered my baking dish, which allowed rice to brown on bottom & edges & added more flavor. I pounded out my chicken & cut into quarters & lightly salted & peppered it. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water & fresh veggies cut in bite size pieces. I baked covered 55 minutes & uncovered with cheese 10 more minutes.  Delicious!!

Precooked chicken cut in pieces with lemon pepper seasoning. Precooked jasmine rice for 8 minutes. Cream of mushroom soup with artichoke hearts and black olives mixed with chicken broth and milk.  Mixed chicken and soup mixture over rice. Baked covered for 1 hour.  Added cheese and baked uncovered for 5 minutes.  YUM !!

I followed the instructions exactly,  the rice came out uncooked and the was under cooked. Nothing about this seemed to go right. I feel like the rice may have need to be cooked ahead of time along with the chicken, then all mixed together and cooked for a shorter time.

This is my absolute favorite recipe of all time! It is delicious and does not break the bank by any means. I always partially cook the rice first and use chicken stock instead of water. My family loves when I make this flavorful dinner item.

This is a great starting recipe. I followed the recipe to a T the first time and it was too bland. I just made it again and changed a few things. I doubled the onion powder, cubed the chicken, added 1tsp of blackened seasoning (zantarans), a dash of garlic salt and I added chopped bacon to half of it for my husband. I didnt care for the bacon but he loved it. It is definitely going into our rotation :)

This recipe tasted OK.  I used the Campbell's Creamy Chicken soup.  Instead of water I used milk.  Instead of white rice I used brown rice.  Also I cut 3 large chicken breasts in small cubes.  I chose garlic salt with parsley over the onion powder because I did not have onion powder on hand.  I added 2 heaping cups of frozen broccoli.  I also seasoned with salt and pepper.  I mixed everything together.  The cook time took me 1 hour and 8 minutes, I checked the casserole after 45 min and the rice was still not cooked all the way through.  I gave it 1 hour, check it again, and decided to give it a few extra minutes.  After 8 minutes I decided it was done because it started to get dry, I mixed it well right after it came out to make sure the rice cooked itself all the way through.  It came out bland.  I didn't add the cheese because I'd only be adding calories to an already bland dish, so I wanted to keep it healthy.  I was looking for something simple, it wasn't as simple as it seemed.  Would I make this again?  Probably not, but one thing I do like about it is I altered the recipe so it fit into my 'eating right' life style plan.

It's hard for me to review this recipe as i really just used it as a starting point, the recipe as written, is quite bland and nothing special, with a few tweaks it becomes wonderful! I cubed and sauteed the chicken first with some diced onion, also sauteed the vegetables briefly, i used worcestershire, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper and bouillion powder to add flavour. I also cooked the rice in chicken broth prior to baking. I assembled the casserole, added 2 cans of mushroom soup rather than chicken and just a bit of milk for the liquid and i baked it for 30 minutes, it was delicious!

Bigger chicken pieces were somewhat bland and rice was slightly crunchy. Next time I'll season smaller chicken pieces a little more before adding and cook an additional 10 minutes. Overall a decent recipe though.

This is a good weeknight meal because it is quick prep and the ingredients are typically on hand.  The recipe should specify the size of the chicken breasts because even halving those I purchased, the cook time was much longer than the recipe indicated.  Perhaps it is because I used frozen vegetables?  I think it took about 90 minutes to get the chicken to 160 degrees.

I used greek seasoning and crushed red pepper as well as LOTS of garlic (minced garlic in the rice mixture and garlic powder on top of the chicken). I topped it with not only cheddar cheese, but parmesan, asagio, and romano cheese as well, and it came out GREAT!

First off, for the high altitude people, I live at 7000 feet, and it turned out fine. But I did not use normal rice, which could be the reason. I cooked as is, but used pee's as a veggie (just from a can) and for the rice I used a box of instant wild grain rice. The wild grain rice comes with a seasoning packet, which I just tossed in with everything else. I also used chicken broth instead of water. Tasted great! I will cook again for sure!

This one is very good. Just a tip to keep the cooking time down: get the chicken breast tenders at the grocery store instead of breasts. Not only are they better at providing a correct portion, but they will take less time to cook through. We made this first with the breasts and they were so think, we had to keep putting it back in the oven.

Delicious! My husband and I devoured this recipe! Chicken was moist, but the rice was our favorite part. Here were my revisions - first, I really love chicken/cheese/broccoli, so I used cream of broccoli instead. I used partially cooked jasmine rice and added some shredded cheddar to the rice/soup mix. Because of this I added less water, only about 1 cup. Added some breadcrumbs to top the chicken and cooked at 425 to get it done a little quicker (short on time). Can't wait to make again!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome. Instead of onion powder I used epicures 3onion dip mix and before placing the chicken on the soup mixture, I browned it and seasoned with epicure Roasted Red Garlic Sansel. I used peas, carrots and corn for veggies and instead of long grain rice I used brown instant rice. 

I would make this again. Easy weekday meal you can have ready when kids get home from school. :)

Great and very easy recipe!  I skip all of the spices and just add my own homemade spice blend.  And I don't just lay the chicken breasts on top (lazy!), I cut them up into small pieces and mix it all in.  It's delicious!

This recipe is amazing!! I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it and it was good but then I got creative and played around with the ingredients and my families favorite way is when I used a pie dish and used pie crust in the bottom then the chicken and veggie mixture (I used fresh garlic, fresh parm and Italian seasoning for the chicken and found it's a lot more creamy if I don't use the low fat condensed cream of chicken soup and added the cheese on top) then I toped with another pie crust and it made a wonderful chicken pot pie and super easy and fast compared to other pot pie recipes the total prep time was about 20 minutes! I also decided to cheat one day when I was low on time before my sons soccer game and used pillsbury pie crusts instead of making my own like normal and my husband couldn't tell a difference! I'd love to know if anyone tries it this way and what they think!! happy cooking ??

After 45min the chicken was barely cooked and the rice was hard as could be. I had to raise the oven temp and cook it for another 30minutes to get it cooked all the way and then it was still not great. The rice was not good at all, there were pieces still hard, some soft and some that were complete mush. I might try again with some instant rice and cook the chicken but that defeats the purpose of a one dish casserole.

Very simple and my family loved it.  I cook for a chef so flavor is key.  I can do simple things well.  This recipe does this.  I used chicken broth vs. water and I doubled the recipe.  I used broccoli instead of mixed veggies.  I added the cheese and more broth 1/2 way through to prevent it from drying up. A nice added touch was Durkee French onions in the last few minutes.  My entire family said "thumbs up"

This was delicious! HoweverI did not stick with the recipe exactly, after reading a lot of the reviews I made the following changes then added a few of my own,and I must say that it turned out fabulous! Here are the changes I made: I seasoned my chicken with salt,pepper, garlic powder, paprika, & Mrs.Dash salt free Southwest Chipotle seasoning. I cut up the chicken in cubes and browned in a little olive oil just until the outside was no longer pink. I boiled my rice for about 10 mins before adding to the rest of the recipe ingredients.I used chicken broth instead of water, added the chicken broth and the cream of chicken, mixed then poured on top of the rice. Then topped with the browned chicken cubes, covered tightly with aluminum foil and baked for 35 mins. After it was done I sprinkled a lot of 4 cheese Mexican shredded cheese and some crumbled Maple Turkey Bacon,the bacon was leftovers from breakfast so I thought why not? After all bacon makes everything tastes more yummy!!! It was SO delicious!!

This is a great core chicken casserole recipe. i like to use brocolli flowerettes, add kosher salt, fresh ground pepper and fresh garlic. Use good chicken stock and a little white wine. Keep it tightly covered with foil until the rice is thoroughly cooked. Remove the foil, sprinkle the top with Italian bread crumbs and pop it back in, increase your temp and toast the bread crumbs a bit. My friends and family go crazy for this dish. :)

The recipe was very good, but my family said they would prefer to cube the chicken and mix in and not place on top. I topped the chicken with bread crumbs initially and then topped with cheese 10 minutes before removing from oven.  I will cube the chicken next time to ensure consistent doneness on chicken.

We love this recipe, make it at least once a month. It's usually my go to meal since I always have the ingredients on hand 
I use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup instead of one and add a little more rice than called for... I also cut the chicken into smaller strips instead of the huge pieces.  I also just started dipping the chicken in egg and than in Italian breadcrumbs before putting it in the mixture... it's awesome ! :-)

I changed a few things such as using leftover chicken and pre cooked whole grain brown rice. I also kept the veggies as a side dish instead of mixing them in, as this makes the meal more appealing to my young son. I added a little cheddar cheese and allowed it to melt before serving. I thought there was plenty of flavor with using the onion powder and water with the soup. Turned out well and I will use this recipe again....

I made a curry version of this and it was a hit!. I added a teaspoon of regular curry powder to the Mexican version (chili powder/cheese). If you love curry recipes, this was delicious. If you really love curry, add 2 teaspoons, as I will next time.

This recipe was  good, but did lack flavour. I used chicken broth as another reviewer also did, and a little bit of Italian spice on chicken. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. I also had to cook it for over an hour to get rice cooked, but an hour was too long for the chicken (dried out). It was  good as I stated earlier, but could have been alot better with a little more spice/flavouring.

This was a quick & easy supper for the kids on a weeknight. I made a few changes: For veggies I used diced fresh celery, small cans of corn & carrots. I followed other reviewer suggestions & substituted chicken broth for water & stirred in black pepper & ground sage. For the topping I used a generous amount of french onion topping around the edges & covered the chicken with cheese. It was so easy & not light on flavor at all! Will definitely make again.

Here's what I did to make this dish pretty good:

Cube the chicken and mix all of the ingredients (except for the cheese) together. The chicken cooks better this way. I also used chicken broth instead of water, I think it helped give it more flavor. Don't forget to season the chicken before you mix it with everything else! I also used Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup. This is definitely going to be made a lot at my house!

As is, this recipe is maybe a 3 star. It tends to come out under cooked. Some modifications I use are: tenderloin strips instead of a full breast. Lots of pepper garlic and other seasonings on top of chicken. Also I use 1 1/2 cups rice, 2 cups water, half a can of cream of cheddar soup, a splash of milk and shredded cheese in the rice mixture.  I cook covered for 30 minutes then uncover and cook till done usually another half hour. With a little imagination this recipe is a good base and very easy to throw together.

This recipie can be very bland, but I made the following allowances and it was perfect.....I sauteed celery and mixed veggies with a little of the cream of mushroom mixture. Once that was done I added it to the casserole  dish with the other ingredients....Add two chicken bullion cubes, season salt, pepper, garlic powder and lemon peper seasoning....Stir.....Take chicken and cut slices down the middle...that will thin the breast and give you another breast....season the breast well.....dip in a bowl of milk and season with italian bread crumbs...put a small amount of oil in a nonstick skillet and brown the breast on both sides....places on top the casserole mixure bake and add cheese....YUMMY with crescent rolls.

So this was a great recipe with a few modifications. Instead of using plane white rice I used the Knorr chicken flavored rice and 2 cups of water. I cut the chicken into chunks seasoned and seared them before putting them in the casserole. Put the chicken on the bottom of the pan. Poured soup mixture over it and then put shredded cheese. Very very good. Do not add more salt, the soup and Knorr mix is plenty salty.

This dish is amazing. It's so easy and all the picky eaters love it. For veggies I used frozen peas, carrots, and corn. I love that I don't have to cook the chicken! I agree that it can be bland. Quick tip: my mom always says to at least double the spices because the recipe is made so it won't offend anyone.

This dish was amazing and so easy to make...coming from someone with very little cooking experience.  I took prior advise to cut up the chicken into cubes and used chicken broth in place of water.  Also used fresh broccoli for the veggies and broccoli cheese soup.  I'm not sure if everyone puts the chicken straight in the dish, but I found it easier to cook the chicken just a bit so it was easy to cut up.  I don't think I would've been able to finish eating this with a whole piece of chicken, so cutting it up was perfect!  Next time I'll have to try this with the cream of chicken soup and different veggies.  Definitely will be making this again!

I gave this three star, I messed up when I made it, so my review is of my revised results. I had read the recipe and planned on making it, but my computer wouldn't access the net the day I was going to make it.  I ended up using instant rice and preparing it ahead of everything else because I couldn't remember what this recipe said.  I then improvised by cutting the chicken into chunks and sauteing separately.  I used a can of cream of chicken, stirred that into the rice and maybe added a quarter cup of water.  I stirred in the chicken and some shredded cheddar.  I also dumped in some still frozen broccoli.  I baked it covered for about 20 minutes and it came out fantastically. Very flavorful, not dry and not soupy.

I've made this several times, and never had a problem with the rice being under-done. I cut my my chicken into chunks beforehand, stir in the cheese and bake for around 50 minutes. Make sure to cover it. Very easy and yummy.

Ok so I have made this several times but on this particular occasion, I didn't have the cream of chicken soup instead I had on hand the cream of broccoli soup. I also cooked it for 55 mins instead of the 45 due to uncooked rice in the 45 min directions. It turned out better in my opinion with the cream of broccoli soup

This is 5 stars with the changes I made. Many of the previous reviews said that long grain rice was not completely cooked at the end of cooking time, so I boiled the rice on the stove for 1/2 of the recommended cooking time on the rice bag. I added the rice and the cooking water to the casserole. I did not add additional water to the mixture. I also cut up my chicken and mixed it into the rice mixture and added 2 tbsp ranch dressing and a handful of cheese to the mixture. It was awesome!!

This is an excellent easy recipe! It's one of the only ways I can get my picky hubby to eat his veggies! I love that I can use any kind of veggies I have on hand. The only reason this gets 4 stars is that after making this recipe many times I've found it's important to use instant rice! It comes out perfectly cooked when using the instant rice, but I always end up with hard/undercooked rice when I use regular. This is one of those recipes I keep coming back to when I don't know what to make for dinner since I usually have everything on hand.

It's been many years since I have used a soup recipe, but I was in need of something very quick and easy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.  By using homemade chicken stock in place of the water and adding my own seasonings (sage, thyme and tarragon) it was really quite good and the sauce tasted home made, not canned.  I forgot the cheese but it wasn't needed at all.

I saw this recipe in a Campbell's ad. I made it precisely to the instructions. It came out  bland. Even my husband complained (he's not a picky eater). There are way too many fabulous easy chicken and rice casserole recipes out there to make this one a keeper.

Wanted to give this 3.5 stars but couldn't so I gave it a 4.  This is a good, versatile recipe.  I substituted the white rice for healthier brown rice and added some frozen peas and carrots.  My chicken came out a little dry.  I think next time I'll add chicken broth instead of water to give it more flavor.

I made this with Italian Seasoning, garlic salt, pepper, and chicken seasoning. I would probably use 2 cans of cream of chicken next time. I did not use cheese and it was still delicious! Canned carrots and green beans were used as vegetables.

My favourite comfort dish. I make it with pork chops and cream of mushroom soup too, minus the cheese. I occasionally put the chicken or pork and other ingredients minus the rice in a slow cooker for the afternoon then add Minute Rice when I get home.

very yummy recipe. I cut chicken into cubes like other reviewers recommended I thought that was a great choice. I also added a scoop of "better than bouillon." it's like I Chicken bouillon Cube but better lol and I cooked it for an hour and 20 minutes, put the cheese on and put back in the oven for another 5 minutes so make sure cheese is melted. I tried uploading my picture but I'm having issues.

Great base for a meal. I doubled the recipe, and it wouldn't have been enough for our family of 3 of I hadn't. I also used chicken thighs (boneless, skinless) that a cut in half. I just prefer dark meat. And for the 2nd can of soup I used cheddar cheese soup rather than a 2nd can of cream of chicken. I added 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp pepper, and kept the onion powder the same. I did not use veggies in it. Next time I'll use minute rice instead of uncooked because it took an extra 20 minutes and another whole cup of water to get the rice cooked all the way. I also sprinkled paprika on the top before baking and used chihuahua cheese instead of cheddar (taste preference).

Super simple, super inexpensive, filling and very good if you have picky little ones. Now, its bland, but I like comfort, cheesy stuff. so, if you need something you can throw into oven in under 5 minutes and have it come out yummy later - this is a standard.

Used frozen peas and carrots as well as jasmine rice. Instead of water, used chicken stock and stirred in garlic powder with chives. Coated chicken with garlic powder, Italian herbs, and paprika, covered and baked. 3/4 through cooking time, checked rice, needed more time so I took the chicken off the top, set aside and stirred well. Cooked rice with the top on for another 15 minutes, then replaced chicken on top of rice and used provolone cheese slices to finish for another 15 minutes covered.

My guys absolutely love this dish every time I make it. It's definitely becoming a favorite in our household. 
The only thing I changed was that I added an extra can of cream of chicken soup.

As many other reviewers did, I chopped the chicken breasts (1 1/2 lb.) into large chunks, seasoned with garlic salt, pepper, and herbes de Provence. I let the meat mixture “mingle’” while I chopped half a red pepper and 3/4 cup celery. I steamed the celery for about 5 minutes. Next, browned the chicken adding in the red pepper chunks for the last 4 minutes.  In a bowl, mixed the white basmati rice with 1 C chicken broth, 1/2 C sour cream, and the soup.  Next, combined everything and poured into a casserole sprayed with vegetable oil. Covered with foil and baked in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes. Uncovered and topped with 1/3 C shaved parmigiana.  Next time, I would add an additional 1/2 C broth. It was a little drier than I would like although the rice was cooked.

I used long grain rice instead of brown rice,  otherwise I made no changes. I checked it after 45 minutes and the rice wasn't done. I added about 10 more minutes. Uncovered and added the cheese.  The rice by then was mushy. The flavor was good. I will definitely try it again with brown rice.

I followed the receipt and used whole chicken breast. They took longer than 45 minutes to cook and that made the rice mushy. I would cut the chicken up like others suggested.

So yummy and so quick to put together!! My husband loved it!! Very Feel good comfort dinner!! I mixed the ingredients all up in a bowl first to get everything soaked thoroughly.  I used chicken broth instead of water and I did lightly season the chicken. I also added some pats of butter on the bottom of the baking dish and on top of the chicken. I baked it for an hour and the chicken was moist and wonderfully flavored!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with all of us!!

My family really liked it. I listened to a lot of the reviews that said to use chicken broth instead of water and baked for 1 hour instead of 45 minutes. I also added about a cup of Campbell's cheddar soup and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. We will definitely have this again.

I made this.  I followed the directions to the T except I added more seasoning. When it was done was disappointed the rice was not fully cooked and even after a little extra seasoning I found it to be a bit bland. All in all I think it's a great quick meal except I know to use instant rice and more seasoning next time around.

If I could rate 0 I would.  Baked for almost 90 minutes at 375 and the rice was still not cooked.

Ideal dish to make if you've had a hectic day and need something good, and quick. Instead of long grain rice, I use converted. Also, I use 1 cup of chick stock and 1/3 cup of water instead of the 1 1/3 water. Finally, I add garlic powder along with the onion powder. Add 10 to 15 minutes to the cooking time, and you've got a food dinner without a lot of fuss.

The recipe is really bland once it’s done and it takes FOREVER. By the time the rice and chicken were cooked it was two hours. Tips would be to 1. Pre-season chicken. 2. Use thin chicken breast or  chicken tenderloin. 3. Use cooked rice instead of uncooked rice.

Prior to making this, I read through the other reviews. I used chicken broth, added a bit of organic chicken bouillon, and tossed in a bit of Italian seasoning. I also cubed the chicken breast instead of laying it on top in one piece. We used regular rice, but cooked it in the instant pot on the rice "less" setting, then put all ingredients in the oven, to ensure the rice cooked fully.

My advice would be to precook the veggies just slightly, as they don't cook all the way within 45 minutes. Ours were very hard still, way past "al-dente even". 

We will definitely make this again!

Great recipe!  I did use a package of Broccoli & cheese rice - the side dish - and a bag of the instant white rice...both uncooked.  Cooked for one hour and it was super yummy!  I only had cream of celery soup and that seemed to work fine.  Used Montreal Chicken seasoning on top of the chicken and it turned out great!  A quick I-don't-wanna-cook go to!

This was easy to make and quite flavorful. I didn't have 4 breasts so I cut 2 into chunks and saute them in some olive oil, salt & pepper before adding to the casserole. It was still plenty of chicken for the dish. Everybody LOVED it!! Definitely will be making it again.

Add more cheese seasonings and sautéed onions..Can be blah without..Lightly brown chicken and cook rice slightly before combining..Sprinkle w paprika to make pretty..Creole seasoning and onion salt makes even better..Salad on side and some type of bread..Otherwise will make again.

My mother has made this for as long as  can remember and it's now become a staple for a quick weeknight meal! Pro tip: cut the chicken breasts into stew-size pieces.  I generally use a scant 1 1/3  cup of water as I'd rather have the rice firm as opposed to mushy.  I also prefer to use more than the recommended amount of veggies, shredded SHARP cheddar and added salt to bring out the taste of the cheese!  My cook time is usually 50 minutes @ 375 on the dot.

This is a recipe that I enjoy and will make when I do not want to do a lot of prep. I do not add the cheese, though. Pretty good dish that fills a few people up. Great to bring for potlucks.

Simple, filling, and it tastes good. I use chicken broth instead of water, an extra can of cream of chicken soup, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and some garlic for flavor. I also chunk the chicken instead of putting breasts on top. I cook for an hour and a half not 45 minutes because my rice is never done in 45 minutes. With my little changes it's a family favorite.

It's a rather quick and easy dish when I want a comfort meal. The reason I rate this so high is that as the only  female in a house full of men, they always ask for more and most of ingredients are already on hand.  Pop can be picky, but this dish has him going back for seconds and thirds. Throw  some biscuits in the oven to bake,  meal and bread can be completed in one swoop.

This is so easy and has become a favorite in our home. Sometines we use cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.  We are also cheese loves so we use a little more cheese. I also put soup soup on the chicken. It is one of the most requested quick dishes in my family.

My grandmother used to make this for us all the time. I had to refresh my memory (I'm a great grandma myself now) to be sure I remembered it.  I left off the cheese (because grandma didn't use it) but will try it with the cheese next time. Yes I will continue to cook this for my family.

My granddaughter raved about how good it tastes.  Just heard from my daughter & she says, "very good mom!"  We will definitely have again!  I did change up the chicken bcoz I was already cooking chicken breasts in the crock pot when I found this recipe so combined the juices from that with the water & I also shredded my chicken breasts & added to the casserole.  Oh & I added half a stick of butter!

I will definitely be making this again!!!!  I had to improvise - doubled the recipe and only had one can of mushroom soup.  So, I emptied the can of mushroom soup and substituted the other can with Tostitos Con Queso Dip.  (Keeping my fingers crossed!)  I also took someone elses suggestion on this site and covered the dish with foil - and baked for 1 hr. 20 minutes.  OH MY GOSH!  This was fantastic!!!!!!!!   We loved it!

Winner, winner, of the newly loved chicken dish in the house. Young and old just gobbled it up. I like the ideas to try different cheeses and spices to give it a slightly new taste.
Keep coming up with these wonderful dishes for people like me that are re-learning  my way around the kitchen.

Made many times and loved it but to feed family I double the rice, use 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of chicken.  I use 4 cups water and/or chicken broth.  Yes, that's for 1 1/2 cups long grain white rice.  I add 1/4 tsp garlic powder, salt pepper and 1/4 tsp paprika.   I've had the most success cooking rice in 9 x 13 dish covered tightly with foil and cooking at 400 for at least 1 hour. I check at 45 minutes and may need to stir and add more broth/water.  I bake seasoned chicken breasts  on sheet pan for last 20-30 minutes.

There needs to be some significant amendment to this recipe. The chicken came out severely undercooked and the rice not done at this temp and length.

This was fast and easy, I used fresh broccoli and it was amazing. To kick it up a notch I topped it with 2 table spoons of zero calorie ranch, turkey bacon and 1/2 a cup of mozzarella.

Sorry didn't care for this. I guess you need to add chicken broth or milk to the mix in order to give more flavor. It took way longer than 45 minutes and it was a let down.

The rice was not cooked in time allotted. Had to leave it in for another 45 min. I used frozen which was ok but I think Fresh vegetables would have been much better.

Tweaks include seasoning chicken with Worcestershire and Creole Seasoning, Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken and because I made it with 8pcs of chicken breast, I doubled the rice.  It disappeared just as fast as expected.

I love this recipe once changes are made but following it verbatim is honestly just a little bit bland the changes I have made have made this dish only wonderful but unforgettable instead of water is that I substituted chicken broth and before I put the chicken in the oven I like to fry both sides a little bit and sprinkle Tony's on each side then once I finish frying it on both sides I put it on top and then put it in the oven and follow the rest as the recipe as it instructs this makes it a completely different dish and something your family will always ask for

I had to cook this chicken about 30 min. longer, I think the size of the chicken required longer cooking time, next time, I will chop the chicken up.  My husband had seconds, so I know he liked it...  I seasoned with Lemon Chicken seasoning, and took the foil off the last 15 min. of cooking... Easy dish, and I had everything on hand.  I will make this again!

I used a can of mushroom soup, instant white rice, and chicken broth. I cubed and browned the chicken with Montreal steak seasoning. At the end I added cheese and crushed up Texas toast croutons to the top. It was absolutely delicious and my kids loved it!

So I did Mushroom Soup, and added broccoli, and when it said to add spices I added salt and pepper for taste as well as chili pepper and a bit of parsley onion flakes and garlic powder. The cooking time was too short so I would go with others saying it needs longer. I was also thinking of adding Wild rice instead of white rice and doing chicken broth instead of the water. Other then that, this was such a simple recipe that can be modified for any taste and well worth keeping!

This was great! I used chicken broth instead of water. I think next time I will chop up the chicken and brown before hand. The chicken took a little bit longer to be be done than what the directions said.

Made it almost exact, added extra spices to my tastes.  I agree with other reviewers, the rice didn't finish cooking in 45 mins at 375, it took 1-1/2 hours at 375. Very quick prep, I liked that. Will make again.

I made this twice, the first time I went exactly by the instructions and it was a little bland and I forgot to cover it, like the directions say, so the rice wasnt fully cooked. 
The second time I just added garlic in to the mixture and instead of using cream of chicken I used cream of mushroom. It made all the difference. I remembered to cover it with tin foil and the rice came out perfect. I still gave it five stars because its a good recipe . . just needed a little extra flavoring. Also, I used lemon pepper for the chicken and replaced the water with milk.

I've been making this for about 10 years now, I usually decrease the water to 1 cup &  increase the rice (instant white) to 1 cup (1:1 ratio) and add 1/4 tsp garlic & 1/4 tsp onion.  I season my chicken breasts with salt & pepper before adding the cheese & push them down into the mixture.  350 for 1 hour.  If you use any other rice but instant white, such as brown, it will not cook correctly.  Tip: use the edge of your pointer finger to create a seal for the foil around the inside of the  pan. This is important in order to properly cook the rice.  I don't really make this to often anymore (burned out on it)  but when I do, this is one of the fastest & easiest meals to make with one dish only.  Good for when mommy is tired & daddy's camping on the couch.

Made this for the first time. It is incredibly bland. Needs, at a minimum, salt and poultry seasoning. Maybe some garlic powder? Seasoned salt? Just desperately needs seasoning. 

Love that it's so easy and requires only one pan. 

Definitely let it sit, so it sets up. I found it watery.

I used quick cooking/instant rice, so it was cooked through. 
Might be better with chicken browned first, to give the chicken more flavor. 

Will make some tweaks and try again!

I replaced the water with chicken broth, cut up my chicken into cubes and seasoned it with seasoned salt and pepper.. then I topped it with garlic powder, cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and parmesan.
It was OK, nothing special, but not a bad meal. Gave some to the neighbors and they said they liked it.

I actually got this recipe from my mother which from the looks of her recipe she makes frequently. Extremely easy and quick!! Perfect for busy nights. I used long grain brown rice and 98% fat free soup. Very good. Going to make this again using the Italian version.

I've made it with the chicken and then family loved the rice so much we make it without the chicken and use it as a side dish!  I added a little garlic powder. And after the rice was ready, added grated longhorn cheese and incorporated it and then sprinkled on top.  (I did cover it with foil while it was cooking.)  40 minutes depending on your oven.  Family loves it!  My 20 yr old daughter says she could eat the rice dish for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

This is an awesome recipe. My family loves it. I always use cream of celery instead of chicken. However, tonight I added half a packet of ranch seasoning to the soup mixture and it was out of this world good! Everyone cleaned thier plate and my teen son went back for thirds!

My mom introduced this recipe to me years ago.  I enjoyed it then and now, I make this for my family all the time.  I always add twice the amount of onion powder that the recipe calls for.   I also cut the chicken up into cubes and season it real well with Old Bay seasoning.  This gives the dish a lot of flavor.  At the end when I add the cheese to it, I put it back into the oven to let the cheese melt then I serve it.  My family loves it.  I hope this helps.

I substituted the rice for potato in one casserole and made the second with rice and the one with potato turned out better than the rice. The second casserole (with the rice) I had to add more water to and put back in the oven.

I gave it a 5 star rating for the simple fact that it's just plain easy to make! I've made this so many times for (my picky "grown up now" son) all through his growing up years. When he visits this is what I make. Just add chicken broth, a few of your favorite seasonings and cheese of your choice and you got a meal quick!

This is a great, easy dinner to whip up and enjoy. I did take advice of other reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water. I was cut for time so I cut my chicken breasts into cubes and mixed everything together and made on the stove vice baking in the oven. It turned out great and my oldest son actually had several helpings! When I make this again, I will make sure to have the time to bake and see how well that turns out but all in all a great recipe. Thanks for posting!

WINNER! WINNER! CHICKEN DINNER!

I have a toddler who has ruled out meats and an 8 year old who doesn't want vegetables...not a leftover to be found! First dinner they have both finished in two weeks! Family approved and easy? Don't mind if I do!

Wish I could give it 4.5 stars!  First.. I doubled the recipe and used a 13 x 9 baking dish -  baked for about an hour - uncovered.  I didn't add the veggies as I already had a salad made. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs as I think they are move flavorful.  I sprayed my baking dish with Pam.  I tossed some extra seasonings into the rice soup mixture, and gently stirred under the thighs (in the rice)at about 40 minutes. Turned off the oven near 55 min, sprinkled on some cheese and gave it about 3 min resting in the oven.  I'm glad I added some spice blends to the dish (a good sprinkle of Penzey's Adobe spice, and a good sprinkle of a homemade blend from Arco, Idaho called John's Steak and Seasoning Spice).  It just kick started the rice mixture to deeeeeeeeelish levels!  My hubby was humming while he ate his dinner... lol

I gave this review 4 stars because the chicken was a bit too dry the 2 times I tried it but I will add this recipe to the rotation.  The rice and veggies are good enough to figure out the chicken! I tried it two ways: 1) cream of chicken soup, chicken broth instead of water, frozen peas and carrots = delicious! 2) cream of broccoli cheese soup, broth, and fresh broccoli (and I don't like broccoli cheddar generally) = DELICIOUS!  But I will put extra broccoli next time.   The biggest reason this recipe is so good is because it's so versatile.  Cream of something soup, a veggie to match, rice and chicken. It's like a hundred different dinners in one recipe!

I have mixed feeling on this recipe.  I enjoyed that it was easy to prepare using simple ingredients.  Also that it is an "all in one" meal since it included the vegetables right in it.  What I didn't like was that neither the chicken or the rice was done after 45 minutes.  I had to bake it for an additional 20 minutes.  I flattened my chicken so it wasn't super thick either.  I added extra seasoning; ground black pepper, garlic salt, and paprika to the chicken before baking.  The taste of the chicken was just ok to me.  The taste of the rice was good.  My husband and one of my kids really liked it though.  So I might keep this recipe on hand knowing it's going to need more cook time than 45 minutes, and try to season up the chicken a little more next time.

Definitely just an easy option when you don't want to "cook." I almost always have frozen chicken, veggies and rice so this works at my house. Seems you could ramp up the veggies & reduce the sodium easy enough. I'll keep it as a quick & easy prep option.

So good! I used frozen broccoli and garnished it with a bit of papricka to add color. I cubed the chicken also, so it sat in the mixture and got the flavor cooked right into it. The whole family ate it, even the kids. They actually asked for more.

Easy to make. Instead of water I used chicken broth and cubed the chicken and mixed it all together. I also used chicken flavor rice. It was not bland at all. Will use fresh veggies next time

I've made this several times. It's easy and tasty, and you can sneak in veggies with the rice.

I use this as the base for my favorite recipe, where the main changes are that I cook the rice separately in a rice cooker, and add in a head of broccoli chopped into small pieces spread throughout the dish.

I've made this recipe for a couple years now and we both love it. I use low-fat cream of chicken soup and leave out the frozen veggies (neither of us eats them anyway). I top the chicken breasts with half a can of diced tomatoes and a couple crushed pieces of seasoned stuffing before baking. With just 5 minutes left in the baking time, I top with a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, then broil for the remaining time.

Ok, so this is my first time rating a recipe (although I've been on the site for years)! This recipe was really good with some tweaks. Here's what I did different: I used chicken STOCK instead of water, dried garlic, basil and oregano instead of onion powder and chicken sausage (with jalapeños/cheddar) instead of breasts and everything else the same. I cut my sausage on a bias and mixed everything up in a separate bowl and poured it in my casserole dish. (For the veggies I used mushrooms and broccoli and even cut up some jalapeños). Served with some crusty bread and it was a hit!

Rice was a little undercooked and chicken was a little overcooked. Might try using thawed veggies instead so it doesn't take so long to heat up rice mixture or a little more water?

This recipe is fast and easy but the first time I made it it came out watery, bland and it didn't make very much. To make it savory and delicious I used 2 cans of creamy chicken soup, 2 1/2 cans of water, 2 cups rice and 2 cups veggies. Instead of using onion powder I used onion soup mix.

We did like it, but there were a few issues. The biggest thing - it came out too soupy. 

I will make it again; however, I will change the following: 
I will use 1/2 the water. 
I will use saffron flavored rice and not plain. 

All in all - A solid recipe.

I made this and gave 4 stars because I changed the recipe up. I used chicken breast tenders and cubed them, then mixed in 1/2 can creamy chicken noodle soup and 1 can broccoli cheese. I then added chicken broth instead of water and 1 1/2 bags frozen mixed veggies. For the rice, I got a bag of the steamable brown rice in the freezer section and followed the package instructions to microwave for 4 minutes. That way I knew the rice would be done. I seasoned with garlic salt, paprika, basil, and some red pepper flakes. I poured it all into a casserole dish and topped with shredded Fiesta cheese (all I had on hand). Baked for 50 min and it was very good and satisfying.

One of my all time favorite recipes!!! I prefer to cube the chicken and cook it all together like a casserole.  I also use brown rice and it is just as yummy!!!

My mother always makes it exactly as written and I love it.  I changed a few things because of what I had in my pantry and now I will always make it my way.  I used Campbell's cream of celery soup, shredded carrots instead of frozen veggies and I added salt and pepper to the mix. I heated the water and added a large chicken bouillon cube to dissolve.  I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash original and a small amount of salt and pepper.

I did not care for this recipe. Based on the reviews I thought it would be really good. The chicken was dry. The rice was mushy. We couldn't eat it. I chopped up the rest of the chicken and made chicken salad. Dry, bland, boring.

I really enjoy this meal. The only tweaks I make are using instant rice to cut the cooking time down and keep the chicken juicy, sprinkling italian dressing powder on top of the chicken to add some zing to it and I also use a bit more cheese so the rice gets nice and cheesy!

All in all, it's a winner in my home. When I'm running low on energy and motivation to cook, I throw this together with a quick salad and call it a night, knowing my family is getting a well rounded meal!

This is a good base recipe, but definitely needs some modifications to be better, otherwise its rather bland. I use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can chicken broth for the liquid, and a full cup of rice. I also cut the chicken into chunks for easier dishing. I use garlic, onion, and other various herbs for seasoning to my taste. I also find that you need to cook this for longer than the recipe says. Mine spends closer to an hour in the oven. With my changes, my family would rate this 5 stars. But since Im rating this recipe, not my own I give it a 3.

I made this last night but changed it up like some of the reviews said to do. I seasoned and browned the chicken first. I cooked the veges and brown rice as well. Then threw it together into the baking dish using chicken broth instead of water. I also added a can of cream of celery for more flavor. For the veges I used broccoli,peas and cauliflower. I used onion and garlic powder as well for a seasoning. Even with all this the recipe was still bland. It was like eating plain oatmeal. I wont be making this again.

I give this 5 stars based on a few changes. First, I deboned 4 chicken thighs, cut up the meat, and mixed it into the rice/soup mixture. Second, instead of white rice I used a blend of brown and whole grain rice, which I think added a lot of flavor that white rice would not. Finally, I do not like frozen vegetables or onion powder, so I instead chopped half a yellow onion, 1 bell pepper, and 2 stalks of celery. It took way longer than 45 minutes to cook, possibly because of the rice I used. I cooked it covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 45 and it was perfect. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!

I make this at least once a month.  Once it's done I shred the chicken and mix it in and then melt more cheese on top.  My kids love it.  Easy way to get them to eat their veggies!

An ideal "home cooked meal" recipe, added some seasoning to the soup mixture for some extra flavor and replaced water with 1% milk for a creamier taste.  My husband loved it and when he took the leftovers to work for lunch he said all the guys gravitated towards the microwave when he was heating it up.  A couple have asked for the recipe for their wives to make.  Definitely a guy pleasing meal.

Just finished making this for dinner tonight, although I tweaked the original recipe a bit. Like others suggested I used chicken stock instead of the water and was lazy and used half of a rotisserie chicken I had in the fridge. I just shredded the chicken finely and mixed it all with the rice and veggies. I also added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/3 tsp of salt for taste. I also added the 1/2 cup of shredded Cheddar and mixed it in with the rice and then topped it off with some more cheese. It was wonderful. Not bland at all and a dish I will definitely make again on busy weekday nights.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. I cubed and browned the chicken before mixing it with the rice and vegetables. I added a few extra spices but nothing extravagant. It seemed very watery and it never thickened up. It also calls for the cheese to be put on top, but the flavor from the casserole didn't really mix with the cheese in my opinion. I don't think I'll be making this one again, but it was fun to try.

This recipe is simple and tasty - like the other reviewers commented.  I made it substituting chicken broth and minute rice and when it was done, it seemed very bland.  I added chicken flavoring and sharp cheese to add some flavor.  I definitely will make this again - but I will brown the chicken w/ spices and maybe a small amt of chopped onion. If I feel wild, I may saute the veggies a bit w/ spices as well.

I used cream of broccoli soup and added a square of beef boullion. I didn't have any chicken on hand so my boyfriend was complaining about having no meat for dinner. He ended up loving it anyway and it was very easy to prepare.

Easy, fast to prepare, decently healthy.  I added 1/2 can fiesta cheese soup by Campbell's to the rice mix.  I added paprika to the chicken & topped it w/mozzarella.

It tasted okay but was very watery despite me precooking (for a couple of minutes) the mushrooms, cauliflower and broccoli in microwave prior to adding  and draining them.

This was a really good casserole.  It makes a great base to add to/play with.  It wasn't spectacular, but a perfect dinner for a Thursday night when you're running low on both time and groceries.  As long as you have a few staples, you can have a great dinner. I definitely plan to make it again, but I also plan to play with it a bit to mix things up some.  I think you can add anything to this and still have it taste good. Oh, and I also had to bake for quite a while.  I baked covered for 50 minutes then topped with cheese then continued baking uncovered for 15 more.

I had boneless turkey breasts already, so I used that in place of the chicken and I used frozen veggies and instead of cream of chicken I used mushroom.  Those are the only changes I made, and it turned out good, but my turkey really dried out. I even tried to keep it in the liquid before the rice soaked it all up.  Next time I will try something else for the meat, otherwise, good recipe.  Would be good vegetarian too.

Boyfriend said that it tasted fine... but the cooking time was off.  It took alot longer to cook. Also, used a package of frozen veggies in cheese sauce which I think added to the flavor.  This dish was very easy and the ingredients are always on hand.

Used this classic recipe tonight for dinner. I was out of mushroom soup, so I used chicken stock and a little bit of tomato paste. Came out way better than usual. Also topped with mozzerella cheese. The chicken stayed very moist, although I cooked it for about an hour. Great!

Being the mother of 3 small children under 6, working, and going to college full-time, I barely have time to put something in the microwave.  I made this dish last night for dinner, and it was wonderful!  My husband doesn't care for rice, but with the cream of chicken, it definately "did it" for him!  Could use a little more seasoning(a tad bland) but all around an excellent, quick, and easy dish! Thanks so much

I love this recipe because it is so easy. However, to make it have flavor I did add a few things. In the rice/water/veggie/soup mixture I added a pinch of paprika, salt and tarragon and I finely chopped up a small jalapeno and green pepper. I didn't use frozen vegetables - I used fresh broccoli. Also, on the chicken I sprinkled some seasoning salt, pepper and worsteshire...all of this gave it more flavor and the jalapeno added a small kick. Will definitely use this again when I don't have time to cook a fancy dinner.

Wow. This is pretty good to be this easy. Add a little Worcestershire, hot sauce and a tablespoon of mayo and it is out of this world.

This recipe was awesome.  There were no leftovers!! I did add a little salt and pepper (to taste) to the soup mixture.  This meal is added to the regularly cooked meals.

Bland is not even close to how it tasted.  Two stars only because DH & DS covered it with hot sauce and ate their plate full.  And it was easy to throw together.

I used chicken broth in place of water, wild rice in place of regular, and fresh veggies.  Also, I used the Perdue Perfect Portions Italian Seasoning Chicken.  It was VERY good.  I just finished off the leftovers for dinner tonight!

I guess we are in the minority right now but after reading the reivews, I expected a lot more. Pros-fast and easy and the chicken was moist. Cons-it was very bland and dull and too watery. I am puzzled as to how others are having so many extra veggies. I used 1 cup of frozen mixed vegtables and one cup of fresh brocolli and did not find it to be too much at all. I would not make this again. There are too many other casserole recipes that are much tastier.

Ok, if rated on how simple this recipe is to make, it would be a 5+, very, very easy, and you can concentrate on other things while it bakes. Now for The chicken, it was extremly moist, and you could cut it with your fork. However, I was the only one who ate the rice and veggies, and we had a ton left over. It was ok, just not great, and even though the kids tried it, they wanted nothing to do with it. So because of this, I don't think I will make again, which is too bad, becasue it was sooooo simple to make.
