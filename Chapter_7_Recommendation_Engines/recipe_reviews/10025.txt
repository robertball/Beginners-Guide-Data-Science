Sooo delicious!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  They turned out perfectly!  I also substituted the almond extract with vanilla extract since I didn't have any almond extract on hand.  I baked the cookies for exactly 10 minutes and pulled them out of the oven when just some of the edges were golden brown.  I will definitely make these again.  Update:  I made this recipe again with all butter, no shortening.  The cookies spread quite a bit and weren't nearly as good as when I made them with 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.

So good! I read most of the reviews and was really confused as to what to expect. Half of them said the cookies came out really cakey and puffy, and the other half said they were too flat. I don't like either extremes and really wanted a cookie that was right in the middle. I got it! I followed the recipe in the basics (was going to use less flour as some of the reviews stated, but when I was adding it, they looked like they needed all 2 1/2 cups), except did 1 tsp vanilla instead of half almond, and added more macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips. Used real salted butter, and it wasn't extremely softened, which I think helped. Dropped by tablespoons instead of teaspoons because teaspoons always seem too small. Baked for 9 minutes and they came out just undercooked in the middle, which is exactly how I like them. They were perfect. Hope this helps!

The BEST. Better than any cookie I have made yet. Made the recipe as is. Which I suggest as butter adds alot to the richness of the cookie. No problem with spreading. Do not soften butter too much. I also returned my dough to the fridge to firm it up a bit after mixing.I also did not add any almond extract. Almond is a very strong flavor and macadamia nuts are expensive. I did not want to overpower their delicate flavor.A++++

These came out great, I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out just like the photo. Crispy crust and chewy insides.

If your having issues with the cookies I'd recommend you check your technique, you must be doing something wrong.

I'd recommend doing it all by hand, electric mixers can cause things to go wrong very quickly because the generate heat and can over mix your batter.

If your cookies are running flat, it means your butter is melting before you bake. First check and be sure your using real butter, the only ingredients in it should be milk/cream, anything else and it's not butter! Your butter is ready for creaming when it's cool to the touch and when you press your finger against it, it should dent a little. Also when you pick it up it should have no trouble holding it's shape. When your creaming try not to place your hand by the bottom of the bowl, the heat from your hand can melt the butter to much. Also chilling your cookies just before baking can help it keeps it shape, but don't chill for to long, maybe a few mins. Baking soda goes to work immediately, so if you wait to long your cookies won't rise.

If it's coming out cakey it's probably the shortening or too much baking soda (measure carefully!!!!) Hard/dense cookies are do to over mixing, to get that crisp and chewy texture you want to FOLD your dry ingredients in GENTLY a little at a time.  Stirring or being aggressive will beat the gluten to much and change the texture of the cookie.

I've made these cookies four times now and they are always a tremendous hit.  The last time I modified the recipe based on some of the reviews here.  I replaced half the butter with butter flavored shortening and did 3/4 tsp vanilla and only 1/4 tsp almond extract.  It made the almond flavor much more subtle and not so overpowering.  The substitution of shortening for part of the butter helps the cookies maintain their shape and gives them a great texture.

I made these cookies on a lazy Sunday afternoon, they mix up quick and easy. I read other reviews talking about the cookie "spreading" so I did 2 things to prevent this. First, I made sure to allow the butter to soften on its own at room temperature, and substituted 1/2 of the butter with butter Crisco. I also only used 1/2 of the almaond extract that is called for. The results were absolutely fabulous!!! They had very nice form, and baked up perfectly on my stoneware cookie sheet. My husband labeled it "a keeper" and took some to work to "share" although I think he was selfish and kept most for himself.  I will be making these again!!

I made these Saturday and had 2 requests for the recipe in my inbox on Monday morning.

My switches: 
- 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup shortening
- 1 tsp vanilla, no almond
- 3/4 bag of white choc chips
- parchment lined sheets
- big messy drops of cookies

Bravo!

Some of the best cookies ever!  I made them into bars, and way undercooked them so they would be soft, and a little chewy.  I've been searching for this recipe for years - Got it!!!

I made this recipe without the almond extract (doubled the vanilla) and they were delicious. I found these cookies to be quite sweet with the amount of sugar called for and wouldn't add any more.

These cookies came out great but what alot of recipes dont tell you is HOW to mix them properly.
First off is stick with real butter.Any real bakeries do not use shortening. The reason why all of your cookies turn out flat is that you are over beating or beating too fast mainly the butter. If air is introduced into the mixture it will spread out on the sheet. So while  mixing keep the speed at no more then med. to avoid airation but stop when everything is just blended. Another trick is after you scoop out the cookies on the sheet pop it in the fridge for 15 to 20 mins and this will also help them retain the picture perfect cookie look. To get a perfect bottom on the cookie with no burning use "Air Bake" sheets and they will cook evenly with NO burning at all.

So good!  If you want to make a powerful impression, take these cookies to a party.  I put the full amount of almond extract in and it was not overpowering at all.  I cut down on the flour a little bit, using 2 cups of all-purpose and 1/4 of whole-wheat pastry flour.  Taking these cookies to a dinner party tonight...if they last that long!

Fantastic!  I also added 1/2c Coconut. -So good!  Please understand that flour reacts different depending on what brand it is et. Also if it is a rainy day, dry  sunny  day etc. (flour absorbs moisture from the air so can react differently on different days too.    I always bake 1 "test cookie"   * If it spreads too much, I add 2 T additional flour and mix it in before baking.   * Too dry and doesn't spread/stays in a lump? add 2T more butter or shortening. then bake.    -Hope this helps

These are my favorite cookies but I never found a good recipe to try.  Thank you for posting it!  I just made a batch to add to my holiday cookie collection and I plan to make another later today.

I too cut the almond extract to 1/4 tsp. and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening as in a review I read for this recipe.  The cookies did not spread and taste delicious!

For Best Results:
All ingredients should be a room temp.  Including Eggs. Do not exceed medium speed when creaming butter or adding the eggs. It will be mixed enough in about 2-3 mins. Scrape bowl 2-3 times.  Add flour mixture on slow speed and just till incorporated. Fold in nuts and chocolate by hand.  Refrigerate batter about ten mins.  Use an air-bake sheet lined with parchment paper.  Use a small ice cream scoop to place cookies 2 inches apart.  Bake @ 350 until edges start to brown.  This can take 12 mins.  let cool on pan for 2 mins then move to rack to cool completely.

I was disappointed by these cookies!  They turned out the right texture but they were tasteless.  I was irritated that I wasted 7$ on the nuts for this not to go as planned.  I like the recipe on the white chocolate chip bag much better. Maybe if you were to double the chocolate chips...

Very good.  I did omit the almond flavoring because I do not like the taste of almond flavoring so for the reviewers who said "do not leave it out" that would certainly depend on knowing your own taste.  If I was making the cookies for someone that I knew liked almond flavoring then I would add it.  This is when you first read a recipe and see a lot of or not so much spicy flavorings, adjust to your preference rather make the recipe and than criticize.  For those who thought their cookies were too puffy, you might try cutting back the baking soda, 1 teaspoon is a little more than you would normally find in relation to the amount of flour.  Also, if you melt the butter just until it starts to brown, add the brown sugar, wisk and let it sit for 2 or 3 minutes to dissolve the sugar, you will get a different consistency than if you cream the butter and sugar, however this is not to everyone's liking.  Try it and if you do not like it, go back to the original way.  For those who complain about the cost of the macadamia nuts, this is what trying new recipes is all about and at least on this site you have the benefit of the comments of others who have made the recipe whether you agree or not.

My husband's most favorite cookie! This recipe was, according to him, the BEST white chocolate macadamia nut cookie he has ever put in his mouth. I didn't change a thing, only added ½ teaspoon of baking powder into the mixture to yield a bit fluffier of a cookie. The result? Perfectly chewy, delicious cookies and slightly puffy. My ideal! I'll be using this recipe from now on until the end of time for my husband! Thank you!

Used half-butter, half-shortening instead of all butter.  Doubled the nuts and the chocolate chips.  Also made much larger cookies than recipe calls for - I used my 2-tablespoon scoop instead of teaspoons!  Baked about 14 minutes at 350 degrees and got gorgeously tanned and delicious cookies that still have a bit of chew in the middle with crunchy edges.

Do not alter this recipe. It's perfect as is. I bake every recipe as listed the first time and I'm glad I didn't take the advice of some of the other reviewers. The cookies didn't spread too thin, they had a great consistency, and they are definitely a new favorite. Be careful not to melt your butter (if you warm it up in the microwave). The key is to barely soften it. If you didn't like this recipe, you didn't do something right.

The flavor of these cookies was nice.  What I was looking for, but they were WAY TOO THICK.  So cake like.  I wanted flater, chewier cookies.  I will keep looking.  In the photo of these cookies, they look normal, but mine were very thick.

These are very good cookies. I also used half butter(for flavor) and half shortening(for texture), while upping the vanilla extract to 3/4t and lowering the almond extract to 1/4t as other reviewers mentioned. I thought a few more nuts and chips would be good. I noticed that a few have mentioned  an overpowering saltiness to these cookies, leading me to wonder what type of butter was used. I was trained to use only unsalted butter in all recipes, so that I am always in control of the saltiness of the end product. I make my cookies bigger than these, so of course end up with a smaller yield. Thanks for the recipe!

These are not that good... I mean, they're okay, but the end result is really not worth the time, money and effort that goes into this recipe. They're rather "cakey" and I was hoping for a flatter, softer cookie.

My brother's fiancé asked me to bake his and hers favorite cookies for their wedding.  Her favorite was white chocolate macadamia nut, which I had never made before.  After reading through different recipes on this site I chose this recipe and the "White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies IV" recipe to try.  This cookie beat the other recipe in multiple taste tests.  Ultimately, the fiancé choose this one and all but one person liked this one better.  I changed very little on this recipe.  The 1/2 shortening helped the cookies maintain shape and added a nice texture.  The 1/2 brown sugar helped the cookies not be as sweet and the almond extract gave it that little bit of something extra.  Definitely give this recipe a try.

I refrigerated the dough before baking (one night make the cookie doughs, bake another night) and rolled into walnut-sized balls. They spread a little, but stayed small and neat, and were DELICIOUS!!!! My man said they were the best cookies he'd ever tasted. Two thumbs wayyyy up - thanks!

These are delicious.  They practically melt in your mouth.
I read some reviews before making them and decided to do half butter, half shortening.  I also noticed that the almond extract IS a little strong but not in a bad way.  I love it but if you think you might now maybe use a little more vanilla and less almond extract.

Very disappointed in this recipe, I feel like I have wasted a batch of chocolate and macadamias.  The almond extract overpowers the taste of the whole cookie and the texture of the cookie is unappealing.

I followed the directions exactly and these came out cakey and puffy for me. I think I'll switch back to my other recipe.

I don't know how people can rate a recipe 5 stars when they have to make changes to the recipe. IF you make changes you are no longer following the original recipe and should not rate the original based on your results after changes. These turned out very puffy and cake like... I think 2 eggs is to much for the recipe and would reduce it down to 1 egg. I was looking for a flat chewy cookie and that is not what I got. The picture is very misleading.. the picture is what I was looking for the actual product was not... will try a different recipe next time.

I made a few alterations due to lack of ingredients.  I used good quality dark choc chunks, only vanilla and like some other reviewers did half butter and half shortening.  The only other change was I made them WAY bigger and then flattened them with damp fingers.  I love them and am planning on hiding them before my husband gets home!!

I made these for Christmas and I decreased the flour to total 2 1/4 cups and increased the vanilla to total 2 tsp. These were so buttery, full of flavor and decadent straight from the oven. Excellent late night munchie food as well. Thanks for a great recipe.

I am really dissapointed with how this recipe came out.  I had high hopes for this one.  The cookies did not flatten out one bit :( The taste is okay, noting special.  I'm not sure if it's because I mixed the dough too much, maybe it is.

I made sure that everything was measured extremely accurately, but the cookies didn't spread at all. Infact they held their exact shape. I always use real butter and I am not sure if that makes a difference or not but next time I will add less flour and I will add more white chocolate as other reviews have recommended. I used salted macadamia nuts and the over all flavor of the cookie was very good.

The best cookies ever! I do not like doughy cookies- AT ALL! These were slightly more cake-like, but not doughy. So, so, so good! I have to say, so many people have said, "use half butter half shortening" no way! Use all butter- but don't melt it all the way. Just until it is soft, and make sure to get salted butter! Then make the dough. And I personally love flat cookies, so I baked these right away. But if you wanted a thicker cookie you could put them in the freezer or fridge for a few minutes or hours. Also, these can freeze in a plastic container for about 2 weeks, so they are great cookies to make ahead of time! Oh, and the dough or the actual cookies can freeze. One more thing, shortening is not good for you one bit, and I am not saying that butter is, I am just saying- Butter Is Better! Anyhow, thanks for posting  this Mary, your awesome! p.s. I liked them better with plain vanilla, not almond extract. And I used honey and xylitol in place of the sugar and brown sugar! Good Luck with these scrumptious cookies!

Not sure what happened to mine.  They taste good, but look nothing like this pic. They have a consistency of bread almost, kinda of fluffy, not sugary enough.  I measured everything correctly too...hmmm

I am giving these cookies five stars because other people liked them and because I didn't follow the recipe exactly (I don't think it's fair to knock off a star). I cut the butter in half and used 1/2 a cup of shortening, but I think I would have been happier with the cookies if I had followed the directions and used all butter. Also, my store only had salted macadamia nuts, so I didn't put in any salt. Don't get me wrong, these cookies weren't bad at all, but I think my expectations were too high. Next time, I will use all butter.

These cookies are amazing! Everyone wants the recipe but, do you want to know how to make them amazing? I change the butter to a 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup of shortening. Plus the vanilla extract changed from 1/2 teaspoom to 3/4 teaspoon and cut the almond extract down from 1/2 teaspoon to 1/4 teaspoon. SUPER COOKIES!

I followed the recipe exactly, except for using 1 tsp. of vanilla extract instead of 1/2 tsp. each of vanilla and almond since I didn't have almond on hand. They turned out wonderfully! For me, they definitely turned out on the puffier end (I did mix the heck out of the batter with an electric mixer), but I just flattened the dough a little before baking. They are a keeper and I'll be making them again.

Excellent cookie! I took others' advice and used butter crisco for half of the butter and used only 1/4 tsp almond extract. My first batch I accidentally overcooked and they were still great. The second batch was absolutely perfect. Definitely a keeper!

These cookies are my husband's favorites!  I did make some changes to thos recipe though.  I reduced the flour to 2 cups and used 3/4 teaspoon vanilla ,and I reduced the almond extract to 1/4 teaspoon because it is an overpowering extract.  These are great cookies, however, I do not like macadamia nuts so next time I make these I will do a seperate batch with just the white chocolate.  Thanks for submitting this one!

I made it with 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine and I used the almond extract.  They are delicious cookies.  I know when my husband says "darned good" that he really likes them.  A big hit and I want to thank you for a great recipe.

I made this recipe just as written and the cookies really are quite good. As usual, teaspoonsful of batter makes small cookies and a whole bunch of them. I used well rounded-to-heaping teaspoonsful and ended up with 94 cookies. And if you wait for the cookies to be golden brown on top, they will be charcoal on the bottom. I took them out of the oven as the edges showed the first sign of browning, and they were just right. Thanks for this recipe, Mary!

I subbed in 1/2 cup of shortening per some other reviews, and they turned out nice and soft.  The teaspoon-sized servings made for adorable bite-sized cookies that went fast...all 4 dozen of them!

These could not have come out any better - they taste professional, and are very addictive.  I made sure to use butter that was not too soft so there were no problems with spreading, and I upped the vanilla a little as we like vanilla.  My husband finally had to leave the room to keep himself from eating too many.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. After reading other reviews I was concerned that they might flatten...but I had no problem with this at all. The key is to not have your butter to soft when mixing...and to use real butter.  I followed the recipe to the T...and my cookies turned out great. Thanks

This would be a wonderful cookie just the way it is, but I'll rate one star lower since I made a few alterations because I'm a baker and I know what I like. The ratio of cookie, white chocolate and nuts is perfect. I didn't use almond extract because I didn't have any & I usually don't like it. I just doubled the vanilla. I like chewy cookies that aren't cakey. To achieve the consistency I like, I used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour. I also substituted 1 egg yolk + 2 Tbs of milk for one of the eggs. These are tricks I learned from Alton Brown to make my cookies chewy. It's also very important to cream the butter and sugars for at least 2 minutes until the mixture lightens in color. Then add the wet ingredients. These tricks work for me every time. The half butter/ half butter flavored shortening thing works too, but I like the taste with real butter much better. I also chilled the dough for 24 hours... making the dough one night and baking the next night. I took these cookies to work and my co-workers devoured them. They were a huge hit.

I decided to follow the recommendation from other reviewers to replace 1/2 cup butter with shortening. The consistency was perfect but they ended up a bit bland. I think I made a mistake by using plain vegetable shortening instead of butter flavored and maybe should have packed my brown sugar more? Decent but not a keeper in my book.

As other suggested I used half butter half shortening.  Next time I will use all butter and they turned out more cake like and I like the flatter kind of this cookie ( like Subways... yum!).  I used half the almond ext which was perfect- any more and it would have been too overpowering.  Next time I will cut the mac nuts down a bit and use extra white choc chips.

I made these omitting the almond extract, using the full 1 tsp. of real vanilla extract. I also used real butter softened and baked for 8 min. with one additional min. left on the cookie sheet to firm up. They were soft, buttery, and delicious. No problem with the cookies spreading at all. A keeper!

I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and used 1 tsp vanilla and no almond extract.  I also used 1 1/2 cups REAL white chocolate (very important).  I also replaced 1/4 cup of butter with Crisco. Cookies are soft, did not spread.  These are delish.

Mixed this up then refrigerated it overnight since other reviewers had expressed concerns about it spreading too thin.  In my opinion, it still was too thin. They were very difficult to get off the air bake cookie sheet.  I am making these again and will cut back on the butter to see if that helps.  My son LOVED these even thin as they were.  UPDATE:  Used  3/4 cup butter and left everything else the same.  Baked exactly 10 minutes............PERFECT!

Very good cookie.  I made two white chocolate macadamia nut cookie recipes from this site tonight and this one is my favorite of the two.  I made the recipe exactly as is (excepted for i half the recipe). The cookies were neither two flat or to tall.  They were just right.  After reading the other reviews, I do agree that you should either sub vanilla extract for the almond extract or 1/2 the amount of almond extract.  I will make that modification the next time I make these.  However my husband loves almond extract, so I expect that the cookies I made tonight will be gone in no time.

I made these with whole wheat flour instead and they came out beautiful. These should be illegal in three countries cause they're so good. Try this recipe, you won't regret it!!

I have made this recipe several times, and it turns out wonderful. My boyfriend says he rates it a 9, on a 1-10 scale. However, i find the dough is hard to work with, and i prefer adding all the ingrediants together, before mixing at all. It works better that way for me, and that is what i will be doing from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

These are absolutely wonderful!!!!  Macadamia nuts are expensive and hard to come by in Canada - and of course, they're my favorite kind of nut.  This is my recipe for SURE!  They are not too sweet and are soft and chewy.  9 minutes in my oven was plenty of time to cook them perfectly and I didn't have any trouble with them spreading.  Thank you!!!

The key to these delicous cookies is to use butter straight from the fridge.  DO NOT SOFTEN THE BUTTER.  Cook just until the edges are brown and leave on the cookie sheet 1 to 2 minutes before transferring to parchment to cool.  This is an excellent recipe as written, and will be used by my family for years to come!

My husband loved this cookie! I made them by the tablespoon so it gave me roughly about 40 good size cookies.I also used the half butter and half shortening because we like soft cookies. They were gone it three days! Will be making again..and again.

My family raved over these cookies!  I made the recipe exactly as stated and had none of the problems other reviewers have had.  Thanks for a great recipe!
UPDATE:  At my boyfriends request, I used coconut extract for a unique twist.  No vanilla or almond just 1 teaspoon of coconut extract.  He raved about these cookies afterwards and hoards them like I was never going to make them for him again.

After reading the reviews, I also used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  Instead of the macadamia nuts, I used half cashews and 1/2 pecans only because they were on hand.  Delicious!!

Better than any white chocolate macadamia nut cookies you can find in the stores.  Love the even ratio of chips to nuts. A little too much almond extract for me (no one else thought so though) but overall, excellent.

The recipe was very simple. I did not add the almond extract. I really don't care for it, and it is very over powering. I used the two sticks of butter and found that the cookies flattened, I used about two Tbs. of the batter on one cookie to make sure there was as much of a chewy center as I can get. Next time I will try with the shortening.   Overall a very simple and tasty cookie is the end product!

Made them on a humid day and the first batch turned out dry, so I added 1 cup of brown sugar.  Also put in a cup of orange flavored dried cranberries.  They're soft and chewy and decadently delicious!

These cookies taste good. I used celebaut chocolate which bakes up perfectly. I think this recipe could have used a bit more chocolate. I also used tablespoon fulls and flattened them a bit as I found they came out a bit cakey and puffy. I am not sure what makes a cakey cookie as opposed to a chewier cookie..but I think I would have preferred a bit of a chewier cookie. Also I think a dark brown sugar would have given a richer flavour.   All in all, a good tasting cookie though, and I did omit the almond extract as it's not to my liking and just doubled the amount of vanilla.

Turned out the flatest cookie I have ever made and I am a baker. They did have great flavor but I would never serve them to guests. This cookie is just the same as chocolate chip. so just use your fav recipe, sub the chocolate chips for white chocolate and ad macadamia nuts.

This is the third time I've made them!! They disappear very quickly each time. This is my Dad's favorite cookie! I however took someone's advice to reduce the flour to 2cups. I live in FL & my cookies never spread unless I reduce the flour. I also keep the almond extract as is in my recipe & it doesn't seem to overpower the other flavors. I also add craisins [dried cranberries] for color and flavor interest. Even sceptic dissenters of this addition can't help themselves and these cookies don't last 3 days anywhere I've made them! They disappear =)

These were light, delicate and quite delicious.  But I knocked off one star because they were slightly drier than I would have wanted.  But if you like the light and delicate type of cookie, I'd recommend it to you.

These were the best cookies...ever. I went looking for a recipe, saw the review, and had to write one myself. i like the note about if your nuts are salted, leave out some of the salt. They taste AMAZING!

Yummy.  I just finished baking these cookies and wow.  They came out great.  I didn't have any almond extract so I used just about two teaspoons of vanilla instead and they turned out great.  I also only baked these cookies for 81/2 to 9 minutes for a slightly more chewy cookie.  Wonderful.  Thank you for the great recipe, a must try.

I'm not a big dessert fan, so I made these for my hubby. He absolutely loved them! My only changes...I added 1/4 tsp of almond extract instead of the 1/2 tsp. I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening. I wanted flat and thin cookies, rather than tall and thick, so I had to press down the raw dough to make it a little flat before putting in the oven. They don't naturally flatten out, have to give it some help. Thanks for the great recipe!

These cookies were an absolute breeze to whip up! Excellent flavor with the almond and vanilla extract. I read other reviews before making them but decided to follow the recipe exactly and see what happened. What happened was the best cookies ever. Not too fluffy but not flat what so ever. I pride my self on baking good cookies - these were by far the best I have ever made. And my husband and kids (who don't like nuts) agree!

These are awesome!  I used 1/2c. butter flavor crisco and 1/2c. margarine, without the extract.  They were so thick and chewy, not flat at all!  Thanks--SM

Oh My GOSH!! These cookies were incredible. I've been looking for a good cookie recipe and I found it. Here's what I did: I didn't drop and bake. I made a cookie roll on parchment paper and parked it in the frig for about an hour. Then I sliced and baked. I undercooked them just a bit, but they were perfect - still soft in the middle. I've used this base for other cookies too - choc. chip, oats, butterscotch. They all turn out great.!!!

This is a great, easy little recipes for one of my favorite kinds of cookies. I thought they tasted best leaving out the almond extract entirely, and letting the nuttiness come from the macadamia nuts, but that might just be me.

The best part? - I have a temperamental oven, and these cookies are still good when slightly overdone. Yay!

The cookie was too doughy. I made it exactly as the recipe states, but this cookie was not good. With all the great reviews, I was hoping it would taste like a Subway or Otis Spunkmeyer cookie.

I made these just as written - they are fantastic!  I baked for 11 minutes on an air bake pan, and they stayed chewy and moist.  I have also made them with an extra 1/2 cup of nuts and they are still great!

The best macadamia nut cookie I've ever made OR even tasted! Yummy! I turned down the oven slighly and cookied just a little longer. It made them soft and chewy. ^^ I used only 1/4 cup of macadamian nuts. My family's not much into nuts.

These delicious cookies were a hit with all my friends and family! I definately recommend this recipe. I used butter flavor Crisco instead of real butter and didn't have any almond extract. I doubled the vanilla extract and the cookies still came out great.
Enjoy!

These cookies weren't bad, but I felt like the flavor of the dough was too much for the delicate flavors of the macadamia nuts and white chocolate.  I much prefer the recipe for White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies IV on this site.  (The dough is sweeter, less dense, and complements the other flavors well.)  Thanks for the recipe, though!

Great recipe!  Nice and tasty!  I used 1/2 of butter flavored Crisco in place of the butter to make them nice and soft.  I also used 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond flavoring.

These cookies were absolutely fabulous!!!  With the few slight changes, my family couldn't keep their hands away from the cookie jar!!  Instead of using 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 a tsp of almond extract I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp of almond extract.  I also added 1/4 cup extra flour but this amount varies depending on the consistancy of the dough.  My family isn't huge fans of white chocolate so I use the white vanilla chips instead which are sinful.  Although the recipe was quite varried from the original...they made delectable treats.

This was a yummy cookie recipe. There are a few changes I made to this recipe. I changed the flour to 2 cups and added 3/4 cups oatmeal--blended to a fine powder (in blender). 1 tsp almond extract--for a nutty flavor. 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder. These cookies are irrestible...especially dipped in milk!

These cookies are amazing, I've made them several times. Will never have to buy at the bakery ever again. To prevent cookies from spreading out thin, refrigerate the cookie dough for about an hour, just perfect.

These are very good cookies! I did use half shortening and half butter, but that's because I always do in cookies; other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I have a brand new oven and I found that these cookies needed to bake for 11 minutes to be done.  I made these for my niece, who is away at college and I know she's going to love them!

This is an awesome recipe! The first time I used white chips and the second time I used chopped white chocolate - both turned out wonderful. I almost always substitute butter flavored Crisco for butter in my cookie recipes to make them softer but I didn't even do that. Will make again and again!

These were delicious!  I used 3/4 cups organic butter and 1/4 cup shortening, and I used 1 tsp vanilla extract and no almond.  These didn't spread, but they weren't cakey at all. They were sweet, delicious, thick, and moist.  I baked them for exactly 10 minutes.  The office devoured them!

I have just taken 2nd pan from the oven.  My husband had to have 4 cookies while they were still very hot.  I mixed recipe and baked 16-minutes with only one suggestion from other reviews.  I chilled dough about 45-minutes before baking.  This is a winner for my favorites.  Thanks for posting.

I followed this recipe and the results were thin, flat cookies.  Since I love the white chocolate and macadamia nut combination, I think I'll just use my go to chocolate chip cookie base, subbing the white chocolate and adding the nuts.

I found these cookies really average. They weren't bad or anything but they did not blow me away. I don't think I'll make them again. My family agreed that they were a bit underwhelming. The reviews made me really excited and they just weren't what I was expecting.

I did what lots of others did and swapped out half the butter for shortening, which made a HUGE difference. Doing that, the cookies spread less, which made them smaller. So making this a 3rd time, I was using the ingredients to make only 24 but I knew they cookies were spread less so to make them normal size, I made the drops bigger resulting in only 10 cookies. But those 10 were perfect. This is my go-to cookie receipe now. :)

I just made half a batch of these cookies and they were great.  They taste just like Otis Spunkmeyer.  I didn't have any almond extract so I omitted that, but otherwise I left the recipe the same.  My hubby loves them.

I've tried several recipes from allrecipes.com but it was THIS recipe that prompted me to write a review.  These are the best cookies I have ever tasted, I can't believe I baked them! I substituted coconut oil for half the butter. The cookies are a lighter texture and in color, and that much more heart healthy.  You can sub 1:1. They're perfect - right in between cakey and doughy.  Thanks for sharing!

I used white chocolate chips. It would have been better to add some more chocolate chips or use chunks of white chocolate. Very yummy.

I made this recipe tonight and it came out pretty good. I used over a cup of white chocolate, but it still needed more! They were but dry though. Maybe a bit less flour or more butter. The flavor was great! I will definitely be making these again.

I rarely bake, and when I do, the results are pretty varied, but this recipe is foolproof. I followed it to the letter, except that I substituted an additional half teaspoon of vanilla extract for the half teaspoon of almond extract (as a matter of personal taste), and they came out picture perfect. I will certainly use it again.

My husband was begging me to make these cookies for him and although I have the Mrs. Field's cookie book I decided to try my trusty Allrecipes instead. There were 2 recipes that scored high in the reviews. This one and the IV version. I chose this one however, I wish I tried the other one first. All the reviewers here mentioned the cookie being cakey. They weren't joking. I followed this recipe exactly as shown and was not very happy with the results. The cookie really lacked flavor and was extremely cakey and mealy. Almost like there was too much flour in it? This recipe did score high though so this must be a common type of cookie elsewhere but I've never had anything like this on the West Coast. I say, try it for yourself. You may like it a lot more than my family did. (Sorry Mary)

Really good. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I just left out the almond extract and did a full tsp of vanilla. Cookies were perfect consistency, texture, flavor. Will make again.

Great recipe! I decided to make these for our cookie swap at work, and I am so glad I did. I used a bag of white chocolate chips and a jar of roasted macadamia nuts, chopped up. I followed the directions and they came out great!

I love these cookies my husband who doesn't like nuts loved them. The only change I made was use all vanilla instead of almond extract, and I also mixed the nuts and chocolate in the dough before I added the flour and I used all the flour the recipe called for and used real unsalted butter. The most plump soft little cookies with tons of nuts and chocolate. This is a winner recipe!

So yummy!  I threw the dough in the freezer for 30 mins to make it easier to work with. I have also tried substituting the white choc chips with toffee and the macadamia nuts with walnuts...also very tasty!  My family loved them.

Pretty good recipe on its own! The cookies came out a little puffier than I would have liked, but the taste was great even in the parts of the cookie that didn't have nuts or choc chips. I didn't add the almond extract because I didn't have any on hand, but I think they still came out really well and look gorgeous. I would say that you might want to refrigerate the dough for a few mins before dropping onto cookie sheet though; my first batch spread BAD and a few melted into each other. I stuck the dough in the fridge while I waited to do the next batch and it worked out a lot better.

These are AMAZING! I made two bins full and went to bed early.. by morning one of the bins was gone! I'm gessing my family liked them! I subed walnuts for macadamia nuts as a cheaper alternative, and they turned out tasting just as good. Maybe I was lucky, but mine didn't turn out cakey or flat, they were perfect :) I used half margarine and half butter and only threw them in the microwave for about 30 seconds before mixing with the sugar so that could have made a difference. In any case, I Highly recommend this!

These cookies turned out perfect. I followed the directions as is & I loved the almond extract. I only wish that the macadamia nuts were a little bit crunchier - they seemed to soften after being cooked. I put the bowl of dough in the refrigerator inbetween cooking batches because the dough was a little soft.

I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and substituted the almond extract with vanilla extract. I took them out when the edges were slightly golden brown. The cookies came out perfectly and tasted delicious! This is a really easy to follow recipe.

This is the best cookie recipe in the world. Definitely.  I used gluten free flour and rice bran oil spread (like margarineish stuff) and definitely overmixed and kept the dough in the fridge overnight.. BUT THEY STILL TURNED OUT AMAZING! They are quite a cakey cookie and crispy around the edges, they puff up and spread quite a bit. I had them in teaspoonfulls and the cookies ended up the size of .. um, around the circumference of a mandarin and the height of 1/8th pinkie finger

I did the 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening thing and also used vanilla extract instead of almond. They were amazing, I just wish macadamia nuts weren't so expensive. Also, I would recommend leaving out the salt if the nuts you buy are pre-salted.

Not really sure what happened here. I make cookies a few times a week for the family and this is the first time I've failed. I followed the recipe except didn't have any almond extract so I used vanilla, like others. They turned out flat and way too cakey. I was really disappointed. Think I'll stick to my original recipe. Thanks though!

Awesome recipe.  Turned out as I hoped.  I went by the recommendation of using 1/2 butter flavor crisco otherwise I followed the recipe (well, I put in a few more chips because there was a little more than a cup in the bag.)

I followed the recipe exactly as given.  The cookies turned out moist and chewy with a great flavor.  I baked the first pan for 10 minutes, subsequent pans were baked for 12 minutes.  This yielded sturdier cookies that were still moist, chewy and flavorful.  The only thing that kept me from giving this recipe 5 stars is that they cookies were a little flatter (once cooled) than I was looking for.  The cookies turned out excellent.  I will be making this recipe again, but may experiment with the chips, adding nuts, etc.

Unlike some of the other postings I needed to use all of my flour, but remember the age of your baking soda and altitude will also affect your cookies fluffiness.  I enjoy a strong flavored cookie, so I doubled the amount of the vanilla as well as tossing in coconut for some extra sweetness.  For those of you looking for the Mrs. Fields cookie you need to keep looking, this recipe is a perfect homemade cookie for the realistically minded people.   Im looking forward to recreating this recipe again, however I will continue to tweak it to my liking … Im thinking lime juice for a tropical flair.  

Cheers,

~N~

I only have this to say: my boyfriend who is in the navy and to whom I send cookies every other week or so declared these cookies "the best cookies I have ever had".  And he loves all my cookies.  He said they were incredible and that everybody thought so.

I did not change a thing. Thanks for this amazing recipe. :)

Great recipe!!  I made this recipe the first time three weeks ago.  I had to make another batch this week since my family can't seem to stop eating them!  The only thing I changed is used vanilla instead of almond flavoring.  My husband suggested I add more white chocolate the next time I bake these - which I plan on doing.

I just made these. I didn't have almond flavoring, so I used maple, and they turned out very tasty. They didn't look like the picture though; not soft cookies that melt out flat. They are little hill-type cookies. Very good.

Wow, these are great! But like most people, once I find a recipe, I always try and improve it. Coming from my nutrition background, I substituted 1 cup of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour (I'm always looking for ways to sneak in more whole grains!). I also used half butter, half crisco and these turned our great!

These cookies were gone sooo fast!! I made them at ten o' c lock last night when my parents were asleep and only my brother and cousin were up. Well, every time I put the cookies out to cool, they would snatch them right off. And when there was only one left, they would make so much noise trying to get it, I was sure my parents would come out to yell at us!! They were fantastic and easy..and just great!! Right before these, I had made cookies using cake mix, which they thought was gross. When I made these, they said [[with cookies in hand]] "relax, you made something good". They could of ate them all right then. THANK YOU!! I will have to make these again.

These are my favorite type of cookie and I've been searching for a recipe to make them just the way I like them.

I followed the recipe exactly using large eggs and a pretty exact measuring spoon. I also chopped the macadamia nuts myself and used toll house white chocolate chips.

When I balled the cookies, they didn't really change shape in the oven, so if you're looking for flat cookies, smush the balls down. Also watch the edges of the cookies, as soon as they start to golden, remove from the oven.

I would use store chopped macadamia nuts next time as the macadamia is a little over powering, but that could be because of my own chopping skills, or lack thereof. 

These came very very close to being my dream cookies and they have gone over very well so far.

Made cookies with walnuts instead of macadamia nuts because the grocery store was out.  But still turned out amazing! Were soft, thick and fluffy, but not TOO soft, thick and fluffy.  Used 1 tsp. of vanilla instead of 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract.  AMAZING   will make again

I liked the flavor of the cookies but they were very dry and not sweet enough.  I only made half the batch and saved the rest to see what i can add to make them a little better. I think i will add some more butter or marg. and more sugar to the rest of the batch.

Everyone loves this cookie. Added 1/2 cup Heath Almond Toffee Bits to recipe and that gave it an extra special burst of flavor.  Also cut almond  extract to 1/2 because of bits.  Absolutely Delicious cookie.

These were a hit for a potluck.  Based on other comments, I also did 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter to prevent the spreading.  I used a 3.5 oz jar of nuts and 1 6 oz bar of white choc. and added about 1/4 cup of white choc. chips to make up 1 cup.

This was a delicious cookie!  The only thing I will change next time I make them is, the almond extract was too strong for me, so I will leave it out.  The white chocolate and macadamia nuts make this a somewhat expensive cookie to make, but YUMMY!

I made this recipe for a cookie exchange party.  It was a huge hit.  I would suggest keeping an eye on them before the ten minute suggested cooking time.  I like them soft so I didn't cook them quite as long.  They are so delicious.

I really don't understand all the drama over a simple cookie. I made the recipe "as is" using only vanilla extract because I didn't have almond extract. These cookies were awesome! Chill out people.

Mine came out perfect! I followed this recipe (except for the almond extract) and I did what some of the comments said as far as using room temp butter and returning the dough to the fridge (but not for too long) before baking. I also added a little extra flour since I live in high altitude and they came out the perfect shape/size/texture, not flat. Very nice recipe.

Delicious cookies. I made them with all butter, but made sure the butter wasn’t overly soft per one writer’s suggestion, so I had no spreading issue. Also used all vanilla instead of the almond extract. In the future i would not chop the white chips; I don’t think the cookies look as good without leaving them whole. I used a cookie scoop (approx 1/8 cup) and got 3.5 dozen.

I took the advice of others by creaming the sugars, butter, and eggs with the mixer, but mixed flour in by hand as well as the nuts and chocolate. I flavored with both almond and vanilla. The almond wasn’t overpowering.

I too used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening as some of the reviews said and they came out perfectly. I may have accidently put one tablespoon of vanilla rather than 1 teaspoon (oops!) but they still came out great!

No need to look further - this recipe is it!  I did follow others suggestions to use 1/2 cup Crisco & 1/2 cup butter, and I didn't soften my butter too much.  The consistency of these cookies was perfect.  I agree with other reviewers that this recipe makes the best wcc/mn cookie I've ever had.

This is the first time I made these cookies,  I made them for my daughter who is gluten free using Bob's Red Mill gluten free 1 to 1 baking flour.  After reading the other reviews, decided to use some suggestions. I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup crisco butter flavor shortening. also decreased almond extract to 1/4 teaspoon and increased vanilla to 3/4 teaspoon.  Because  I love white chocolate, I increased the chips to 1 and 1/3 cups.  They turned out fantastic. just enough nutty flavor, they didn't spread out a great deal and my whole family loved them.  will definitely be making them again.

11/16 Too much spreading out,  but I didn't have any shortening.  I would try this again. 5/17 update: soften the butter, not melt, it helps with spreading.  15 minutes for the first 2 batches on the stones. Then 12ish minutes for the following ones.

Just came out of my oven and they're perfect! I was out of extracts so left them plain, but I like them just the way thet are....not overly sweet. I did add a cup or so of dried cranberries. Will definitely be adding these to my favorites.

I followed this to a T and changed nothing and they came out beautiful.  Moist in the middle golden brown bottoms.  They never went flat or spread out like everyone said.  I used Kerry Gold butter which I use in everything I bake and do not omit the almond.  It adds a beautiful taste to the cookie and is not over powering at all.  Keep in mind that when you start to alter recipes, that will change the out come of the cookie.   I made this cookie in different batches.  Once with the recipe as stated and once with all the changes (less flour  half shortening and what ever else) and the outcome was not nearly as good .  So my advice ..Just leave it alone.

Delicious cookies when you use half shortening and half butter! I tried making them both ways. First I made them according to the recipe with all butter and they were only ok. Then I made them again with half shortening/half butter and they were delicious! They were not only delicious right from the oven but were delicious the next day too.

Absolutely horrible! The almond extract over powered the whole entire cookie and the cookies came out extremely cakey. Threw out all the cookies after they were done baking because they just tasted so sweet from the extract.

These cookies are on spot and turn out perfect! You can get between 36 - 40+ cookies depending on the size of the cookie .

The way as to make the cookies not flat is to not melt the butter.
I leave the butter outside for maybe an hour or two to let it soften up, if I don't have time I just mash the sugar and butter by hand until it's fully incorporated .

These cookies turn out perfect , thick , soft , and with great flavor . I urge to not skip on the almond extract as it really does enhance the taste.

Just follow the recipe as instructed , no shortcuts . :)

Delicious cookies! I made recipe with 1 tsp of vanilla and omitted the almond extract.  That  was the only change i made. Cookies came out of oven puffy but deflated some as they cooled. They are soft and perfectly cooked. My family loves them.

I have NEVER ever baked a single cookie before this one. I followed the recipe exactly as is, as I do most recipes the first time I make it. Only thing I changed was that I did not put in any almond flavor becuase I forgot to. Came out great, except I thought it was too sweet for my taste, so next time I made them, I cut out the white sugar completely. The cookies came out great this time. My wife was so surprised since I have never baked anything in my life.

I had never made white chocolate macadamia nut cookies before, but wanted to make the for my boyfriend after finding out they were his favorite. Honestly, I'm not always a fan of baking, so I tend to follow recipes to the T. I followed this recipe almost exactly. The one exception was I decided to buy white chocolate morsels instead of chopping the white chocolate. They were a hit with my boyfriend who loved them warm out of the oven, but also the next day. I froze the extra cookie dough to bake them a couple at a time so I don't overindulge. I'll be interested to see how they turn out the next time.

Excellent recipe. I used all butter, and I found I actually had to flatten the cookies a bit, so no problems with spreading. I cooked them for 10 minutes and they stayed soft. I could've likely cooked them for one more minute to get the edges crispier. I used all vanilla as I agree that almond would've overwhelmed the flavor. VERY good, soft flavorful cookies.

I cut this recipe in half and added my own take on it. I didn't have the nuts so I just left those out but I added a dash of pumpkin spice, a dash of cinnamon, and some fresh grated coconut. They turned out amazing!! Very delicious. My entire family loved it. I also did not add any vanilla extract and cut down on the sugar.

My sweetie loves Pepperidge Farm Tahoe's so I decided to make him some and decided on this recipe.  I following the recipe to the "t" and was disappointed.  This cookie lacked flavor and sweetness.  Thank goodness we reduced the recipe to only 12.  If you have another choice, pass on this one.

This has to be my favorite, absolute favorite cookie.

This recipe was perfect, no changes made to the recipe.  Just perfect.

Be careful, sinfully addicting.

I just got tired of paying ridiculous prices for these cookies.  They are so much better made at home.

Always great recipes on All Recipes.

I use this site about 90 percent of the time for anything I'm looking for.

Delicious cookie recipe. I did not use the almond extract but substituted it with Vanilla Emulsion, 1 teaspoon total, which many pastry chefs prefer over pure vanilla extract. I also only use Lindt white chocolate and coarsely chop it. I hate white chocolate chips and most of them have an aftertaste that they impart to the recipe and my family and I think it tastes artificial. Thank you so much for this gem of a recipe.

My son and I made these over the weekend and they were gone in a flash!  I too went with others suggestions and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening as well as vanilla instead of almond extract.  I didn't have white chocolate bars on hand so we used white chocolate chips and they were perfect.  Thanks, Mary!

I followed the recipe using all butter, as I had no shortening on hand. While I'm glad it worked well for others, my cookies were cake-like and bland. I won't try this recipe again, even to experiment with shortening -- it was that disappointing.

Made these today because these are my son's favorite type of cookie... I do not like white chocolate but OMG... I will fight him for these..... I will have to double the batch next time and freeze the dough balls for easy baking ... followed the recipe except used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored Crisco... this is a keeper.

This recipe was really good, it is an actual winner. It is easy to make and I can say I followed most of the suggestions especially replacing the almond extract for a full teaspoon of vanilla. I even reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4 of a cup and honestly, the sweetness was just perfect. I also used half butter and half shortening and definitely recommend to bake them for 9 minutes. They ended up a tiny bit chewy and a tiny bit crunchy. Definitely will make it again and again hehe my husband's coworkers LOVED them!



EDIT: I recently made this cookies again in hotter weather. They were fabulous as usual;however, consider to watch more carefully the baking time and the temperature. You may need less time and lower a bit the heat. Hotter weather may cause spreading. My suggestion is to refrigerate the dough as you wait for each batch to bake. Furthermore, to avoid spreading in hotter weather mix the butter and shortening a bit colder than usual. If you leave both to set to room temperature by the time you finish mixing the dough the oils might start separating as too much of the cold will be lost by then.

Absolutely loved it!!! I did however follow other viewers suggestions and did 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening. I also did all vanilla extract instead of the almond flavor...just personal preference. Result...perfection in flavor, chewiness, and crispness!!

These are the best white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookies I have ever had! Doing what other reviewers suggested, I used 1/2 c butter flavored shortening and 1/2 cup salted butter. I also used 1 tsp vanilla extract and no almond extract. They were amazing! My fiance does not like macadamia nuts, so I made a second batch with milk chocolate and white chocolate chips, but no nuts... they were very good as well. Make these, you wont be disappointed!

Made these today just as the Recipe directed. Only thing I did different was added a 12oz. bag of white chips and unsalted butter. Very good cookies. They didn't spread out too much and baked up nicely. I will use this recipe again with choc chips and walnuts.

I made these cookies without changing any ingredients, with the exception of substituting the almond extract with vanilla (as per the advice of other reviews).  I found them rather bland.  Disappointing considering how expensive the macadamias are.  May try them again using the almond extract.  As per other review's comments, these cookies did not go flat, and I used a larger cookie scoop.

This recipe is one of my absolute favorites; they literally melt in your mouth! So many people who usually don't really eat cookies have come up to me and raved about these! 

I usually halve the recipe, use about only 3/4 cup of sugar, and replace the eggs with a banana (I don't eat eggs). If the batter comes out a little dry, I usually add a bit of soymilk.

They came out like cake balls.  I even used a scale to measure to make sure everything was correct in measurements and they were puffy balls.  They need more sugar and also shorting.  I am making adjustments and trying again because my husband loves these kind of cookies from subway.

Great tasting, I used Ghiradelli white chocolate chips...everybody loved these, wouldn't change a thing. I always make my dough one day and the cookies another day, seems they taste better and the dough is cold and they won't go flat.

The only change I made to the original recipe is to use half butter half regular shortening.  And I cooked them for about 8 min each batch.  These are just amazing cookies!  Soooo much better than store brand.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Made this recipe using half shortening and half butter, and they were delicious. Also, I used this as a base for a totally different kind of cookie. For this one, I used just butter. Instead of white chocolate, I used butterscotch chips; and instead of macadamia nuts, I used crushed potato chips and doubled it to 2 cups. I also added a 1/3 cup caramel sauce. Amazing!

I didn't change a thing with this recipe and they turned out perfect!!! : ) I put them in a ziplock bag and hours later me and husband went to go get a cookie and much to our surprise they were softer and chewier then when initially done!! They rose nicely and have stayed that way! This recipe is a keeper!! : )

I used whole wheat flour the first time I made this recipe and then white flour the second..I prefer the whole wheat flour SOO much more. The wheat flour gives it a heartier texture and flavor. I also added extra nuts and cut down the chips. Very good recipe!

These turned out great. The only change I made was using 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening. I didn't think the almond extract was too strong at all. They turned out not too puffy and not too flat. I mixed by hand and not by mixer. I chilled the dough for about 20 min before rolling by hand and they came out picture perfect. My batch made 40 cookies. Will definately make these again!

Excellent.  I did 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  I used my small cookie scoop and got 70 cookies.  I also divided the dough in 1/2 and did one 1/2 as written and 1/2 with the white chocolate, walnuts, and dried cranberries.  Both were fantastic.  Baked it on parchment for 8 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I bake a lot of cookies and my boyfriend was craving this kind, so I found this recipe. He hasn't had a chance to try them, but I have and my brother said they are the best cookie I have ever made. They were so good! I didn't have almond extract, so I just substituted the vanilla and it was perfect!

Sub Par at best. The foundation of this cookie appeared promising, however, upon taste test... Bland!! Grr.. macadamia nuts are indeed not the cheapest of nuts, and should not be squandered in this bland interpretation of a cookie. I did infact consider the fact that perhaps I had missed what would appear to be a key ingredient...I did not.

These cookies are AMAZING! They turned out perfectly. The only modification I made was omitting the almond extract (since I didn't have any) and increasing the vanilla extract to 1 tsp to make up for it. I will definitely be making these again soon!

I dont know what i did wrong. They came out too greasy and spread out so much that they almost looked paper thin. Maybe i measured the flour wrong?

Very good taste. However, a little too dense. Maybe too much flour? Would have liked that better if they had a more chewy, cookie like texture.

These were too cake-y for us.  I mean they were good, but not fantastic...sort of like toll-house.  I probably won't make them again.

Not sure why anyone would alter the recipe. They were not flat or cakey but just perfect. I made it exactly how the recipe called. They came out so good and perfect and this is coming from a cookie snob. Right after putting them on the cookie sheet I put a few extra white chocolate chips on top of each cookie so it gave it a pretty presentation when done.

What a great cookie.  I brought home a couple of cans on macadamia nuts from Hawaii, and studied a lot of recipes to make just the right white chocolate macadamia nut cookie.   I love it!   I used my baking stone for baking.   Now I just need another trip to buy some more nuts!   My husband says they sell them at the grocery store, but a trip would be better.  This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious!! I used 1/2 cup of Parkay Margarine and 1/2 cup of Crisco Shortning. I also baked them on my Pampered Chef Stone. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is a very tasty cookie ~

Excellent cookie recipe.  The first time I made it, I loved it, so the second time I made it, I tried it with just semi-sweet chocolate morsels.  It was wonderful.  Better than any of the recipes on the back of the bags.  Not too oily or crispy.  Just soft enough.  So yummy!

These came out beautifully.  I doubled the recipe and used half butter, half shortening.  While subtle, I think the almond extract gives this recipe a little something unique and is very tasty.

Recipe is easy to make. Takes longer than 10 minutes in my oven, closer to 12. Not a very sweet cookie. I would add more sugar next time.

Tasty cookie and followed the recipe exactly.  The only reasons I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because the cookie was a little more cake like than I prefer and they were not as rich as I thought they would.  Next time I will try some of the recommended alterations other reviewers wrote.

This recipe was fabulous.  I followed others advice and used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  I also substituted crannies for macadamia nuts.  I cooked for 10 minutes and they were perfect!

Great recipe! I usually read all reviews before starting, but I did not have time, so I followed the original recipe with my little adjustments for health reasons: I used 2 bar of 'Smart Balance' instead of butter and less sugar.  I did not have enough vanila, so I used 1/4 each of vanila and maple flavoring.  It went so good, and we did not have any problem at all!  It was delicious!

AWSOME!  I didn't have any almond extract, so I substituted vanilla.  I also took the suggestion of reviews I read and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortning.  Additionally, I put the remaining batter in the refrigerator while there were cookies in the oven to keep it firm since my kitchen isn't air conditioned.  The results were fabulous!  My 9 year old son told me they were the best cookies he ever ate, and believe me he has had lots!  I have a new favorite cookie!

This recipe is perfect as written. I have made it many times, but this last time I decided to take other reviewers' recommendation to substitute 1/2 the butter with shortening. This is a mistake-it throws off the flavor and texture. Will stick with original recipe from now on.

I just made these cookies today, and they were AMAZING! I used half butter and half butter-flavored Crisco, which I think made a difference. The kicker, though, was the almond extract. USE IT, IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE! I also used a combination of salted and unsalted macadamia nuts. Thank you so much for this recipe, I highly recommend it!

These were the best macadamia nut cookies I have had! The almond extract really made a difference.  I only cooked them for 8 minutes instead of 10 because I like my cookies a little softer and more underdone.  My whole family enjoyed these cookies

My sister loves white choc./macadamia cookies and she thought these were fantastic!  I halved the recipe, so it made around 30.  I also toasted the nuts in a dry pan over med-high heat, shaking constantly and this gave them 'something' extra!

Cookies were a little too cakey and crumbly for my liking.  Second time I made them, I cut the flour by 1/4 c. and they were better.  Delicous flavor.  My kids gobbled them up!

Great recipe!  I made them for my family and everyone loved them.  I followed the recipe and had no problems with them spreading too much.  Only thing I changed was I used a 12oz package of white chocolate chips and 1 1/2 cups of chopped macadamia nuts.  I would definitely make these again!

Made these the other day and they didn't last long.  Everyone raved and couldn't stop eating them.  I might cut the almond extract to 1/4 tsp next time. My daughter who doesn't like almond said that it went well with the recipe and didn't mind the taste at all.  All in all a very moist, tasty, not too sweet cookie.

Very good flavor! The combination of the vanilla and almond extracts was key to the flavor of the cookie I was trying to replicate. These came out a bit too "cakey" for me which is why I gave the recipe a "4".It could have been me as I haven't made cookies in quite some time! Family loved 'em!

Great tasting recipe! It has a nice flavor. I changed it as well, I started with the 1/2 cup shorting and 1/2 butter change. My first batch turned out SO spread out and gross looking. So I added another half cup of flour and another tablespoon of baking soda to the rest of the batter, mixed it up, and let it chill for another half hour.. turned out much better! They actually look like cookies now.

These cookies were great! I made them just as the recipe called for with one minor change, I used whole macadamia nuts instead of chopped (they were halved), I personally like the bigger pieces of this wonderful nut. This recipe was a keeper regardless!

One of my fave recipes.  Im always doubling this thing and the cookies are gone within 2-3 days.  I love a sweet cookie so what I do sometimes is eliminate 1/2 cup flour.  And maybe a "dollop" more almond flavoring.  Be mindful to keep watch of the oven. They will burn quickly.

Yummy! I will definitly be making these again!  I used all vanilla extract instead of part almond, added more white chocolate chips than called for and used larger pieces of macadamia nuts.  I also made larger cookies.. heaping tablespoon size and they were very soft & chewy.. just the way my boyfriend and I like them.  Thank you.

I tried this recipe with just margarine, or half shortening and margarine and it turned out fine both times! I also went a little light on the nuts and a little heavier on the chocolate, but that's just personal preference.

These cookies were a big hit at my house. They were absolutely delicious.  Once me and my company started eating them, we couldn't stop.  I'm afraid to make them again too soon in fear of eating too many.

I'm not a "sweets" person but these were delish! I did not have any almond extract, so I just compensated w/ more vanilla. Used white choc chips instead of chunks/chopping. Great recipe for those, like me, who want something "different" but tend to be culinary-challenged. The only negative thing I would say about this is that my cookies spread and were on the buttery side--- I'm not genius enough yet to know how to fix the problem. And, personally, I like more nuts!!! Hope it helps. But really, they are great "as is."

This is a very good cookie.  I like the balance of the almond and vanilla. The almond seems a bit overwhelming in the batter, but baked is perfect, imo. It is very sweet, but not overly sweet for a cookie. For a moist cookie: pull it from the oven when it looks slightly wet in the center (just barely under done) and wait one minute before removing it from the cookie sheet.

These were delicious!  I slightly underbaked them and achieved that delicious crispy outside and soft center...perfect!  In addition to the white choc chips and macadamias, I also added cherry flavored dried cranberries; greatly enhanced by the almond extract! I followed advice of other reviewers and cut back the amt of almond extract to 1/4 tsp and used 3/4 tsp of vanilla and it was the perfect touch, the addition of grated orange zest would complement these cookies very well!

I think theese cookies are absolutlely yummy....I used half butter and half butter flavor crisco.  I also added a 1/2 cup more nuts and 1 cup more white chocolate and if you want a chewey cookie add in one 3.4oz package vanilla instant pudding... I always add in pudding to my cookies... and you can vary the flavors...you can use white chocolate pudding, coconut pudding... very decadent.  Also always roatate the cookie sheet in the oven 1/2 way through it makes the batch more evenly baked...  good luck!

UPDATE: I was unable to send these to my friend  (I got sick), but am glad I didn't. These taste best warm, right out of the oven. They were OK after sitting for a few days, but not nearly as good as they were fresh. Pretty good cookie. I usually don't care for white chocolate or macadami nuts, but needed to make a variety of cookies to send to a friend for Christmas. I know that white chocolate macadamia nut cookies are a favorite of most people (you can't go wrong with them...) and that they'd ship well, so I decided to give these a try. I tried one and thought it was good (but again, not something that I'd make for myself). I followed Mary's directions to a T except for using a 3 T Pampered Chef scoop for each cookie. Because of this, I had to bake my half batch for about 14 1/2 minutes. I will be mailing these this coming week. I am hoping for a soft, slightly crispy cookie. We'll see.... Thanks for sharing!

These were quite tasty and only positive comments all around. However, they were a little too cakey for me. Maybe if I'd only used 1 egg plus 1 yolk and 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter. Anyway, I'll try another recipe and come back to modify if I don't get better results.

I made these for a Christmas cookie exchange in which 25 ladies participated. I added about 3/4 cup dried cranberries and 2 tsp orange zest for a Christmas taste and look.  They won best cookie at the exchange!  They were delicious, people at church the next day were requesting cookies- not just the recipe!  Thank you for the recipe.  I think the almond extract adds a little bit extra depth to the taste as well- nice addition.

This is the best cookie recipe ever.  Follow it exactly and you'll be amazed at how simple and perfect they are.  I've sub'd milk or dark chips and walnuts, still awesome.

This cookie is very good.  Like other reviewers, I cut the almond extract in half and added more vanilla extract.  I may add a little more sugar next time.  Will definitely make this cookie again.

These cookies are amazing! I followed others' advice and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening, baked for 10 minutes at 350 and they turned out perfect! I won over all of my boyfriend's friends with these cookies. :)

These were pretty good! I'm a little unsure about the almond extract. I'm going to try this recipe again with just vanilla extract and also pre-salted macadamia nuts like another reviewer tried to see if it gives them something extra. I love white chocolate macadamia nut cookies and am still searching for that "perfect" recipe.

Cookies spread a little more than I liked.  I like my cookies a little chewy though.  I also added the zest of two limes to make the cookie have a little "pop" of flavor.

These turned out wonderfully!  The only changes I made were the following: 1 tsp vanilla extract (omitted almond extract altogether), 1/2 c. chopped macadamia nuts, 1/2 c. white chocolate chips.  There were plenty of both nuts and chocolate in every cookie.  This is a very sweet cookie - my daughter said the dough tasted a lot like sugar cookies.  I thought they tasted exactly how I expected them too!  Thank you!

I thought the almond extact was to strong. And I also thought there were to many nuts, next time I will use only vanilla and 1/2 cup of nuts. Other than that it was pretty good.

I will have to agree with others when they say that this cookie is a bit dry and a little too cakey. The cookie tastes fine, but I was also looking for more of a chewier, flatter cookie, rather than one that was cakey and puffy. Great tasting cooking, just not quite the recipe I'm looking for.

A pretty good cookie and my family liked it but it isn't the recipe I'm looking for.  It was a bit dry/cakey.  Also, you should definitely add more white chocolate (I threw in about 1/2 cup more).  Instead of the almond extract, I would probably just do more vanilla.  And I threw in a small handful of sweetened coconut flakes which add a nice little something extra to the flavor.  Overall, it was decent flavor but I'm looking for a moister/chewier cookie.

This recipe is pretty much the same one on the bag of white chocolate chips. Pretty good cookies, I think white chocolate chunks work better, and more nuts.

Since macadamia nuts are really expensive in where I live, I used cashews instead. They turned out nicely and I just love the white chocolate taste. My first batch didn't expand so I used my hands to push down and shape the cookies on my second batch. I already finished eating my first batch all by myself as I'm writing this review. Every1 should try this recipe!

These are delicious!  I followed the recipe as is (well, okay, I added a bit extra white chocolate ;) ); although, like others have said, they took a couple minutes longer (+ 2.5 minutes).. 
And for once the number of cookies I got equals the yield!

My cookies didn't turn out as the picture shows.  Not excactly what I was looking for but they are still ok.  They are just like chocolate chip cookies only a different color chip. I omitted the almond extract and added more vanilla also.  I am looking for a recipie that turns out as close to the pillsbury white chocolate chip macadamia cookie dough you buy in the store.

Delicious!  The almond is a little strong when they are first out of the oven, but seems to fade into the background after they cool.

This recipe is just incredible.  I increased the flour to 3 cups but as a habbit I always increase flour in cookie recipes since I do not like flat cookies.  I baked them exactly 10 minutes and they were perfect.  This is definately added to my recipe box.

Wonderful recipe.  I had a hard time deciding which recipe to choose from this site for this type of cookie and I'm glad I chose this one!  The cookies are very buttery (use real butter!) and turn out the nicest golden brown (although mine took about 12 min for each tray).  The flavor is great - just what I was hoping for as I was test-piloting the recipe to give to a friend for her "bring a recipe bridal shower" (these are her favorite cookies, but she's never made them from scratch).  I did use 1 t of vanilla and no almond extract but that is the only change I made.  Next time I will chop my nuts so they are more coarse (each nut into about 3-4 pieces).  I used the white chocolate melting disks each cut into quarters and they worked and look fine.  Nice work Mary!

December 03 - Made these again for Christmas and they were a big hit.  I used the almond flavoring this time and they were still good but it does change the taste - almost like 2 different cookies.  These will be a regular on my list!

I just read a review that said they halved the recipe and the cookies turned out bland. I halved this recipe and made it yesterday and mine turned out great! The almond extract is a little strong, so I might use less, if any, next time, but they're still to die for!

I halved this recipie and it turned out oddly bland.  They were definitely edible, but tasteless...I threw them out and looked for another recipie.

Several times a year, I order Mac Nut Cookies from Hawaii which my whole Family loves so I was very hesitant on how these would taste. To make a long story short, these cookies were absolutely delicious. It was hard to stop eating them. I could not beleive how delicious these cookies were. They came too close to tasting like the real thing!!!! P.S. I did make one change to the recipe, I deleted the almond extract and doubled up on the vanilla extract...

These cookies were SO GOOD I completely blew my diet with them!!!  I cut the butter in half, like someone had suggested, because I have never had any luck with cookies because they always spread too much, and I cooked them on a pizza stone..Oh, M'god..they were like, GOURMET!! After the first batch I realized I should make them bigger and spread them a bit myself, and they were beautiful.. I think the kids even got up in the middle of the nite to sneak some because there were more missing this morning.. ;)

These cookies were supposed to be for my daughter's school, but they were sooooo good that I couldn't stop eating them straight from the oven!  I used 1/3 c. of butter-flavored Crisco in a stick plus 2/3 c. butter, and the cookies kept a nice shape.  I also used the Pampered Chef small cookie scoop, which made 5 dozen.  10 minutes was perfect for the cooking time, and the almond extract added a great flavor!  All in all, a delicious and easy recipe!

Yummy!  I took the liberty of sustituting white chocolate chips and was out of macadamia nuts, so I used orange flavored craisins.  Also added 1/2 c. cocoanut flakes. Turned out great!

I baked two batches of these and sent them to work with my husband.  He said he took some for himself when he dropped them off in the company kitchen.  When he returned half an hour later, they were all gone.  Must have been good!

I've always been a fan of white chocolate macadamia nut cookies, but have never been able to make great ones.  These were the best.  The almond oil gives the cookie a lot of flavor.  This will be one of my standards.

WOW! These are by far the best white chocolate macadamia nut cookies I've ever had - I'm not even typically a fan of white chocolate, but had one at a friend's house the other day and got a craving to make some of my own!!! Very moist and chewy, yum!

I did straight vanilla extract instead of vanilla-almond.
They were delicious,  next time i make them I'll definitely add at least an extra half cup of nuts. 
For anyone that has their cookies go to puddles,  just chill it for 20 minutes before baking after you measure it out (I just made dough balls before baking because the "drop by spoonful" has never been consistent to my liking) into a container.

These do get nice crisp edges from the butter and didn’t spread too much for me, but they are so AIRY! Not cakey, but just like biting into air. I imagine this contributes to people thinking they are flavorless. I might try to add a half cup more flour next time and see how they come out. I used Irish butter, and I think this made the flavor better than cheaper butter might.

Recipe is great as is! Next time I will probably let the dough chill before rolling to avoid spreading. Also recommend adding a handful off coconut flakes for that extra little razzle dazzle

Everyone loved these cookies. They are super buttery and chewy inside. They have plenty of flavor and the dash of almond and vanilla really give it even more yumminess. Truly love this recipe. I’m making these cookies again!

Always a hit! I exclude the almond extract only because it's an ingredient I don't have in my pantry. I also use vegan butter and you can't even tell the difference, trust me!! You can also use Bob's Red Mill all purpose flour to make them gluten free and they are still just as delicious . Lastly I add coconut flakes and extra macadamia nuts to give them more crunch. I don't measure the white chocolate chips, but I'm very generous!

Made it without the almond extract because I didn't have any (just doubled the vanilla), but these were delicious!  I will buy almond extract soon and try again to see which way I prefer.

Really good a lot of people like it. I used dark brown sugar instead of light. I also used a whole bag of white chocolate chips and chopped about 12-15 whole macadamia nuts. When mixing the brown sugar and the butter, I used a spoon to beat and when I added the first egg, I also mixed with the spoon. Everything else was mixed with the blender.

My cookies came out pretty cakey in the center but crispy on the outside. Cookies didn't flatten out well and looked more like a biscuit. I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract since I omitted almond extract (mother in law is allergic). Next time I would reduce the flour amount to 2 cups flour instead of the recommended 2 and 1/2 cups. Also I would use less baking soda, about 1/2 teaspoon rather than 1 teaspoon. I also used cheaper chopped walnuts instead of macadamias, flavor came out perfect!

I did increase the baking time to 11 minutes.

The way I made them turned out fluffy and cake like. I screamed the sugar and butter together by first mashing with a fork then a spatula until creamed that way less air is incorporated, hand whisked in eggs, stirred in extracts taking the almond down to 1/4tsp. I sifted dry ingredients together and slowly added the dry to the wet mixing with a spatula. gently mixed in nuts and chips and chilled in the fridge for 20 min. baked for 15 min they didnt flatten.

I made it almost exactly as written, except for forgetting the almond extract and using white chocolate chips rather than chopping a bar. I also used a cookie scoop rather than rolling the dough into balls.

I did chill the dough, but with my refrigerator at 38ºF, an hour was a bit long. I left it out for the remainder of the time...there was no abnormal spreading, perhaps the heat of folks' hands has something to do with it.

This is an excellent recipe! My son loved them. My husband, who thinks white chocolate is an abomination, found them tasty as well. Easy to make, quick to bake, what's not to like?

(I'll try to remember the almond extract the next time around and update my review.)

They are good but not off the charts. They were a little too fluffy for me. I did sub statute 1/2 a cup of applesauce for 1/2 the butter called for. The recipe made a lot though and I liked that. My husband said they weren't too sweet which he likes. He actually loved them and since I made them at his request that was a good thing!

Hello to All! First time baking cookies from “scratch”...  Followed the recipe for the most part with exception for a couple minor adjustments: I went with a full (1) tsp of each of the extracts, almond and vanilla, instead of the 1/2tsp that was called for, also doubled up on the white chocolate chips (Ghirardelli... Bay Area native and because well, what else IS there? lol ;-P) and macadamia nuts. Not sure what happened, but the cookies came out a bit too thick, if that makes sense. Will attach photos and maybe someone can suggest where I may have gone wrong or if this is normal?As for flavor, The general consensus in my household seems to be about a 3/5... A little disappointed but hey, for it being my first time in sure they’ll get better. 
Happy snacking!

It wasn’t clear how to do the nuts, but since macadamia nuts are soft, it was better to cut/slice them rather that chop them in a processor.  The flavor was so good...

I've been using this recipe for years now, and it is only fair that I review it. at first I was making them with half crisco and half butter, but I eventually found it to be unnecessary. I also often make these with cashews, because (1) they're way cheaper (2) they're bought more often which lessens the odds of getting rancid ones and (3) they're easier to find. trust me, you do not wind up with normal-looking, rancid-tasting macs. anyway, I get tons of compliments on these every time I make them. this is a definite keeper.

In my oven I need to bake cookies for 12 minutes instead of the 10 prescribed. They are certainly hubby approved. I loved the addition of almond extract. I was lucky to have a little in the pantry.

These came out amazing! Crispy on the edges soft and chewy on the inside. I used half unsalted butter, half margarine (because that’s what I had on hand). Instead of almond extract I just did a whole teaspoon of vanilla. I also chilled the dough for a bit before baking which prevents spreading. Oh and I scooped a tablespoon for each, a teaspoon would have been to small. These were perfect!

$10  for the nuts. 
$6 for the  chips
$5 for the butter
These were truly the worst cookies I've ever made. No flavor, flat as a pancake, turn to mush when eaten. 
if these were better than the ones served at the restaurant, I don't know why you felt compelled to devise a recipe for them.
As a professional cook  for 45 years, I can honestly tell anyone who's thinking of trying it, "Don't. ".

I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. Also 1 cup white sugar only as I didn’t want it to be too sweet as there is white chocolate in it already. I had to bake it for about 20 minutes though, but overall delicious!

Leave it up to Allrecipes! This recipe is AMAZING. I don't know if I've ever followed a recipe to a T. This one, I did. Why did I think parchment paper was the only way to bake? While staying at my mom's, she insisted I bake on the raw cookie sheet. I took your "ungreased" instruction and it worked out perfectly. I also really appreciated your tip on cooling the dough completely. It made for perfectly moist and chewy cookies. Thank you!

Super yummy! I would bake a little longer than 10 minutes. Mine were still too doughy at 10. I did 14. I used parchment paper and my dough was pretty stiff.

I did not make any changes, but when adding the almond extract a little more than 1/2 teaspoon spilled in.  This was BY FAR the best cookies i have ever made.  Be sure to add real white chocolate, coarsely chopped.  I believe it made all the difference!  Will make again soon!

I made this recipe today with my 7 year old son. It is very simple and very good! However, I personally would use less almond extract next time. But some people might like that strong flavor in these cookies. It's preference I guess. Over all great cookie!

I made them for a friend who asked me to make her Christmas cookies.  They were a hit.  I did use a full tsp of vanilla and for the salt I used kosher salt.  They are really good.

I found this recipe when my co-worker needed some comfort cookies (these are her favorite  kind). She was very pleased with them, but now Iuse this as a base for my chocolate chip cookies! I scratch the almond extract and double the vanilla, and it gives me wonderfully fluffy cookies. The flavors really marry after chilling for a day or two, I discovered recently. Thanks for a hit recipe!

I added a little bit more flour after reading the reviews, use white chocolate chips instead and added dried coconut flakes to give it a slight twist. The recipe turned out great! Thanks so much

I followed the advise of somebody of the other reviews and used half a cup of butter and half a cup of shortening; I also only used 1/4 tsp of almond extract and the rest vanilla. They turned out fantastic! They taste just like the Subway cookies (which I really love).

Based on other comments, I split the butter & used 1/2 shortening.  I also used white chocolate chips.  The cookies were very good.  Next time I will try all butter and see how different they taste.

Make sure not to make them to big. Mine came out raw in the middle because they were too big. Otherwise these are amazing cookies and the recipe was easy to follow.

I made these cookies today and followed the recipe but I used all butter, omitted the almond flavoring, used only 1/2 cup each white and brown sugars.  I used 2 cups white chips and found it was just too much.  Will use less next time.  The cookies turned out just right at 9 minutes in my stove.  Hubby thought they were just perfect and I thought so also.

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange at work and they were by far the best received if I do say so myself! I did have butter flavoured shortening and half butter and they turned out amazing!!! One thing  I was concerned about was the fact that the only macadamia nuts I could find weee salted and no recipe i found specified which one!  Happy to report that salted nuts with unsalted butter is key!!!!

I make this recipe all the time. Today I tweaked it to make White Chocolate Apple Spice Cookies. AMAZING! Just omit the nuts and add chopped apples. Omit almond extract. Add 3 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice to dry ingredients. I’m eating these now and they may be my new fave cookie!!!

I went with 1/2 cup of coarsely chopped macadamia nuts and let them firm in fridge (easier to work with) for 10 minutes. Also, cooked them a few extra minutes to get them golden on bottom.

I followed the recipe exactly. Combined the ingredients and it felt like play dough. Cooked it and they never settled, was extremely tasteless and biscuit like texture.

Macadamia nuts are not cheap. Dont waste your money on this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. Made sure not to soften the butter too much and they didn't spread too much. First batch needed an extra minute with 30 cookies on the tray. I make these every year as part of my Christmas cookie baking! You can put red and green sugar or sprinkles on anything and make it Christmasy, right?

Very good! I just used butter just like the recipe calls for.  I’ve learned over the years to put my dough in the fridge for awhile after mixing it. It makes the cookies more firm and they don’t spread. Thanks for sharing!!

Too much trouble.  Cookies did not spread well at all.  Ended up little nuggets.   Taste was good.  Amendment to the rating.  Cooked some i had frozen - cooked them only 11 minutes and they were good.  One caution.  You have to mash the cookies down late in the baking process or they will NOT spread out.

Perfection!!!  This has always been one of my favorite cookies so I was happy to find this recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly just doubled the vanilla because I didn't have almond extract in the house.  Sooooooo Yummy!!!

So delicious! I made larger sized cookies that were rolled into balls about 1 1/4 inch. Cooked for 12 mins at 350. Used butter only, and chilled batter slightly before cooking.

Did half short half butter used 8 oz container roasted macadamia - which was more than 1 cup. Added 1/4 tsp cream of tarter to get a nice bakery cracked top to them. 
Excellent!

I made this recipe using 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. They are good but I was thinking if you use Butter Crisco instead of regular Crisco maybe they would be better. Next time I’m going to make that combination. Anyone use that combination yet?

Then cookies tasted fantastic. I used half shortening like what was recommended in the other reviews and vanilla baking chips. They didn’t spread as much as I like so I pressed them down a little more halfway thru baking. I will definitely make this recipe again but I will try all butter.

I thought these came out with the perfect cookie texture for me.  A bit of crispness on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle.  I loved the almond extract in these.

i agree with some of the other reviews, way too cakey for me. i like the consistency of great american cookie company's cookies, chewy and thin. these do not spread enough. some mentioned substituting shortening but i don't like to eat that so the hunt continues

Good, but the almond extract did overwhelm the macadamia nuts and white chocolate.  Will reduce to 1/4 tsp. next time of just omit and use 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  Followed recipe but increased nuts and white chocolate to 1-1/2 cups each (12 oz.).  Mixed all by hand and used 2 Tbs. size scoop to drop dough onto parchment lined cookie sheet.  Baked 11 minutes, cooled for 2 minutes, then removed to cooling rack to finish cooling.  Made 3-1/2 dozen.  Will make again with noted changes.  Good, easy recipe; nice texture.  Refrigerated cookie dough a few minutes in between each batch.

Absolutely loved them!!! I did use half butter and half shortening,  1tsp of vanilla and I cut the white sugar to 1/4cup.
Baking time varies. This is my favorite cookie.  I love baking but cookies would always come out flat or to greasy, so adding the shortening helps and my cookies come out great now.
I will be making again and adding coconut next time.
Thanks for an awesome recipe.

If I could give this cookie a ten I would.  A dear friend who lived in the UK gave me this recipe many years ago and I have been making it ever since.  At Christmas time I also add 3/4 cup of chopped dried cherries, there is something about the tart/sweet/nuttiness that is irresistible.   
Hint: Cookies don't spread out too much if you use the non-stick silpat.

We have our own macadamia tree and I’m akways looking for good recipes. I made this exactly as written and they were really good.   They were perfectly soft and chewy with plenty of flavor and crunch from the nuts.  Everyone in my family loved them.  I’m saving this one as a go to recipe. I did refrigerate the dough before cooking.

Gotta say I thought the reviewer who said they were bland was exaggerating, but it's true. I made it exactly according to the recipe because I couldn't find my old favorite recipe. The positive - these hold their shape really well - they don't spread and get thin and greasy like some other recipes. But they did have an odd airy, baking soda, scone kind of flavor. Like my old recipe, I did chill the batter to help them hold their shape but these were missing something of the intensity of flavor I was looking for.

First time ever making white chocolate macadamia cookies and I was SO pleased at the outcome. I wanted to make these because they're my O2 delivery guy's favorite. He's such a sweetheart and I wanted to show him I appreciated him. I was a bit worried at the varying reviews about the use of the almond extract. When I make a recipe for the first time I always follow it exactly, and make and tweaks  afterwards. But since I was giving these away I was really worried. In all honesty, the only thing I would change at all is I'll add more white chocolate the next time I make them. Other than that the receipt is perfect as is. Thanks so much for sharing!

I thought these turned out perfectly 
Did not alter the recipe at all
For those who were disappointed I don’t know why you must have done something wrong! 
My daughter requested these and said they were delicious!

These are delicious!!!  I made mine exactly like the recipe being it was the first time.  Next time, I will substitute 1/2 Cup of Crisco for 1/2 Cup butter in hopes they won't spread out so far.  They are soooo tasty!

I followed the instructions  exactly including the ingredients.  the dough wasn't firm, enough to make cookies out of it. Instead  made it like a cake, let cool 20 min. Cut it into thin triangle slices. And it's  great. I cooked it for 25min. I got a  from a reviewer to refrig the dough before getting ready to bake. Next time.

I used a tsp of vanilla extract, my husband does not like almond flavor as much.  I also used 1 cup of Ghiradelli white chocolate chips.   The cookies did not have much flavor, a little too blah, and seemed too cakey.   I baked them for 10-11 minutes .  Not sure what I did wrong if anything.  I may try version 2 of this recipe next.

I didn't make any changes and it was perfect. i didn't have any of the problems with the cookies flattening out . They were crisp chewy.  I did notice the ones on the bottom shelf of my convection oven were not as flat as the top shelf. They must cook a little faster so they don't spread out but the difference was minimal. Delicious . I will make these again.

We did not have almond extract, so I doubled up on the vanilla and these turned out great! I used a TSP measuring spoon to make small balls, and cooked them at 350 for 9 minutes in a 4 by 5 grid to make 20 cookies at a time. We ended up with 55 cookies!

These are the best! I added 1/4th cup extra nuts and chilled the dough for 10 minutes before baking. These came out perfect! Love this recipe and will definitely make again. Husband Loved them too.

These are super yummy. I made them exactly as the recipe called for and they turned out great. The very slight hint of almond flavor is awesome. It is summer here and our home is warm, so I CHILLED THE DOUGH IN THE FRIDGE for about 15-20 minutes before baking so the cookies wouldn't go flat in the oven. They held their shape perfectly.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These are great! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening, 1 tsp vanilla and left out the almond extract. Chilled in refrigerator for probably 15 minutes. perfectly thick and not cakey.  I used parchment paper, and I did cook for 10-11 minutes. It does take some time to chop up the nuts. (Make sure to check expiration date on the nuts!) Well worth it.

This recipe is incredibly delicious - here are the changes I made.
I read several reviews prior to this, and I think the people who gave it one star melted the butter instead of softened it. It says softened -  not melted! So I put the butter on the counter for about a half-hour before I started making the cookies... and they had a great consistency. I also did half butter, half shortening, as recommended. And I substituted vanilla for almond extract (since I didn't have any handy), and I thought the flavor was lovely.
One last thing - I personally did not add any salt. The salted butter and the flavor that came with the Macadamias was enough for me.
Hope this helps! This makes an amazing cookie!!

Let the record show these are DELIGHTFULLY PERFECT. I followed the recipe to a T with a splash of whole milk. I used a stone baking tray and a window-wiper ice cream scoop to measure the dollops. I did not spread them down at all. They turned out perfect, a little flat, but they look wonderful. The sugar amount is PERFECT. If you are looking for a cookie that doesn't make you feel like you just gained a new cavity these are for you. I personally hate sugary sweet.

My 19-year old daughter had never had this type of cookie because she has peanut allergies and most nuts and some white chocolates are processed or packaged on the same equipment as peanuts. I special ordered organic macadamia nuts and white chocolate chunks that were made/processed in a peanut-free facility. I followed the recipe, except for the almond flavor (used 1/2 butter and 1/2 rum) and baked for 11 minutes. They turned out perfect and she LOVED them!

YUMMY!! I've tried various recipes, but I think this one will be my "go to" from here on out. This is the first recipe that I've used both vanilla & almond extract - love it!! Adds another level of flavor & it complements the macadamia nuts very well. I did find my cookies needed 11 minutes in the oven, other than that, followed recipe to a t.

I made these exactly as written, and they were FABULOUS!  They were the perfect combination of slightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I did not feel the almond extract was overpowering as other reviewers have stated.  Everyone loved these, and I just wish macadamia nuts weren't so expensive!  Thank you!!!!!!!

I made it as is. I don't like white chocolate, so I didn't eat any, but my wife and kids said that they were good.

I made the cookies.  The only thing wrong with them was the almond taste was too strong.  It dominated the flavor of the cookie and the nuts.  Next time, I eliminate the almond or at least cut the amount in half.

I use this site all the time but have never done a review. But these cookies were very important because I was making them for a person I take care of who's terminally I'll, and loves Macadamia But cookies which I've never made. I always have good results from recipes on here, combined with the reviews so of course I looked here first. These turned out perfectly!! I did listen to a few reviews that used half butter/half butter flavored Crisco, and I also did not use any almond extract, only 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Baked at 345 because my oven runs hot, for 10 mins, and they're perfectly golden brown on the bottom and a tiny bit "undercooked" in the center so they're nice and soft. Yum!! My husband got to try one, and came in the kitchen looking for more! He was very disappointed that they are all for someone else, so I had to promise I'd make more! Try them, you'll love them! Thanks for this great recipe!

delicious! I added a bit more vanilla because I am not a huge fan of almond extract flavor.  Once they are cooked the almond flavor subsides. I used a full bag of white chocolate chips, which  I felt was the right amount.

These are fantastic. No changes were made and we're soft and chewy inside golden and crunchy outside. Definitely saving this one for our family's favorites.  Thank you sharing this one with us.

Oh num, I love the reviews as the previous baker's errors are my perfection. Followed others reviews and used half butter and half shortening. No spreading - they turned out perfect. My hubby could not stop eating them.

Love this recipe! I ended up using pecans instead of macadamias then added some dried cranberries too. Instead of cooking them for the full time, I took off two minutes to keep them fluffy and soft. Coworkers and roommates loved them! I'm definitely going to make them again, especially now for the holidays!

Made recipe as is, and they're delicious! The first batch came out a little underdone in the middle, but I have a habit of making my dough drops too big, and my oven is also not the most reliable thing... baking a second batch now with smaller balls. Great recipe! Will use again!

Made exactly according to recipe with zero changes. 
I found they were not done enough after 10 minutes and had to put them back in for a total of 12 minutes. 
They were just a tad flat, but absolutely delicious... And this is not a favorite cookie type of mine! 
Also, I think the almond extract really added something good! 
Will make again.

I made these to the recipe and they turned out amazing. I used unsalted butter (real butter) and was sure not to over soften. I did use an electric mixer, but on the lowest setting. I also added just a splash of milk, as I'm cooking at a very high elevation (7800 feet) and baked for 13 mins. I don't think you'd need the milk at sea level and 10 mins would probably be perfect.

These turned out very cakey despite using room temperature butter and avoided over beating the batter.  I took a risk and wished I hadn't made these.  Yes I read a handful of the reviews and followed others recommendations.

My husband's favorite cookie that I FINALLY made for him!  This was the first recipe I clicked on and it was a success.  Followed all except for the almond extract--doubled the vanilla.  I agree with other bakers who stress not over mixing and using real butter--in my experience, this is key!  Thanks Mary for giving me a great recipe!

These are a huge hit in my house! I do not use the almond extract, only 1 tsp of vanilla and I don't measure the chips or nuts I just use the entire bag. Why save only a few ounces of the chocolate chips?? These cookies are delicious and taste amazing!

Yum, yum, yum!  I made these today, following the recipe as written with the exception of using Nestle's Premier White Chocolate Chips rather than cutting a chunk of white chocolate.  Since my oven runs hot, baked for 9 minutes, and they were perfect.  This recipe is delicious.  My husband loves them.  Very easy to make, too.

These cookies are AMAZING! The best white chocolate macadamia nut recipe I have found! I did make a couple modifications. I think that Almond extract can really over power a cookie, so I only added 1/4 tsp and then 1 tsp Vanilla Extract. Another thing I did was to chill the dough each time I was waiting for the pan of cookies to come out. I live in a very humid area and had no issue with them spreading or anything. Will definitely keep this recipe as one of my go-to's! Thank you so much for sharing :)

Despite the other reviews that recommended skipping the almond extract, I went with it, adding 1/2 tsp. I doubled the vanilla and added a tablespoon of Amaretto. I reduced the brown sugar to 2/3 cup and added roughly 2/3 cup less flour. Baked on parchment paper, they turned out excellently. They weren't cakey at all.

There is something off about this recipe, do not use it. Cookies don't spread correctly. Very disappointed.

This was an easy recipe to make. I made huge cookies and the cook time was much longer- maybe 18-20 minutes. You just have to keep an eye on them, adding a couple more minutes to the cook time in between checking. They are most delicious!! This recipe is going in my lifetime recipe book for sure.

Followed the recipe and ended with more of a cake taste than a cookie.

These cookies are amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Although these are great, next time I will probably cut the salt in half because my butter was salted and I could only find salted macadamia nuts.  The almond flavoring is dominant so if you don't want that, I could cut the almond extract down to 1/4 tsp.

Wonderful recipe! I added 1.5 cups of macadamia nuts so the cookies had enough goodness in every bite! Like other reviewers, I also used half shortening and butter. The cookies kept its shape and did not spread too much.

I did not care for the way these cookies turned out. They were pretty cakey and were not very sweet. Too many nuts and not enough white chocolate. It just didn't turn out right for me.

Used half butter and half shortening, 1/2 cup less flour, half teaspoon more vanilla and 1 extra cup white chocolate chips and they turned out AMAZING!!! Will definitely make again. They remind me of the ones they have at Subways.

Easy recipe to follow and the cookies tasted great.  I will make this again but next time I will use 2 cups of white chocolate, I felt like it could use more in each bite but that's just my preference.

I followed the instructions and have to say these were by far the best cookies I've ever made. They were a hit with everyone who had one. Even my mother in law approved, so I couldn't have been happier. Baking more tonight :)

Theses did not brown at all, so we took them out at the shortest cooking time in subsequent batches.  If you like chewy cookies, this is your best bet.  Great taste and texture.

These were delicious  I like  cookies soft so I took them out about 30 sec early and it made a difference .  But that is a personal choice the harder ones are just as good. I also made them a little big, trying to be like Pepperidge farms cookies

have made these twice already, with the following small changes:

- swapped cup4cup flour for the regular flour to make them gluten free.
- dropped rounded teaspoons onto the parchment, which made mini cookies.
- before baking, sprinkled each cookie with a pinch of maldon sea salt.

they've turned out perfectly both times! will definitely be making again.

These came out sooooo good! I have been looking for a recipe for them since i had some at my dads that were bought from school. So decided to look up.. and this recipe looked the best. . Oh man are they delicious! I have even doubled the almond extract and its soo good! My daughter said the batter without the nuts n white chips would make an AWSOME sugar cookie.

Excellent cookie, solid recipe. I used dark brown sugar (instead of light) cause that's all I had on hand, no problem. The cookies were a little too soft on the inside for my personal taste after 10 min of baking (although the edges did brown nicely). Next batch I might lower the temperature a little and add another 2-3 min to total baking time.

I made them as the instructions said, but they were a little lacking. I've made them since then, with a full bag of white chocolate chips and 10 oz. of macadamia nuts.  I omitted the almond extract, since that seemed to be too overpowering.  It's an excellent base for this kind of cookie - it just needs a little more chocolate and nutty goodness!

Delish! Made these last night and my bf loved them. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used half cup butter and half cup shortening. I made thicker teaspoonful while dropping them onto the cookie sheet and popped them in the oven for 11 minutes. They came out perfect.

I will definitely make these delicious cookies again, but I am going to add about 1/2 a cup more white chocolate chips. 

I made these cookies again a second time.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips, and followed other reviewers advice by using half shortening and half butter.  I also added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.  They turned out fantastic, no really, I know that word is thrown around a lot but they were truly the best cookie I've made (so far :-)  I had planned on packaging them up to give to neighbors in the spirt of the holidays.  When I got up the next morning ONE cookie was left!!  My hubby and sons devoured them.   Luckily they left one for me :-)  I will be making these over and over !  (I'll hide a few in the future) :-)

Just made these cookies and they turned out delicious. I took the advice and used 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening, cookies have great texture, soft and chewy. Only upgrade would be to add a bit more white chocolate and nuts.

Since this was my first attempt with this kind of cookie, I didn't want to ruin a full 48 batch. Instead, I halved the servings. Also, because I didn't have any almond extract, I substituted roughly 1/4 cup of almond meal instead of the full amount of all purpose flour. It worked as well as I could have hoped. :-) I will definitely make these again!

They were the best tasting, didn't add almond extract, just 2 tsp vanilla.  Only thing was that they were completely flat which didn't look that nice. Will make again and add more flour to make them fluffier.

I used all lite brown sugar instead of granulated and it was amazing. Guests at my sisters wedding all wanted the recipe plus I addad toasted coconut on top as a garnish and tossed the macadamia nuts in cinniman sugar prior to cooking.

I followed the recipe except used 1 tsp vanilla- no almond. Mix at low speed so you don't overwork the butter. It took 14 minutes to achieve some browning in my oven. I let them rest on the sheet for 5 minutes more then took them off. Turned out perfect

Veryy lovely,  not a nut fan so exchanged the nuts for fudge also the almond taste is also not to my liking so will be adding double vanilla extract. I had the spreading issue but after looking at other reviews will follow advice!

Made these for a church event, they were fabulous! I had to add 3 minutes to baking time, I'm sure due to my oven temp. The cookies were perfect, crispy on outside and chewy on the inside. Very satisfied!

I made these for the office as a coworker was there for his last day and these are his favorite. I followed the recipe up until it wanted teaspoons for the cookies. These ended up coming out as mini cookies. I started to use tablespoons and they came out a little more normal sized. Overall they came out pretty tasty.

My family loved these cookies! Only changes I did was use half cup shortening and half cup butter rather than 1 cup butter. Plus 1ts vanilla extract rather than using 1/2ts of almond extract. (Listened to prior reviews)

The flavor and density of this cookie is perfect!! First time I've ever made these, and I'm glad I tried this recipe. I also tried this recipe to make regular chocolate chip cookies without the nuts and almond extract (added more vanilla), it's soo delicious!!

Soooooooooooo yummy! My only suggestion would be to cut the almond extract in half, as it was still too strong in the opinion of both my husband and I.

Turned out perfectly delicious and the texture was great!  I added a little more white chocolate and nuts so there was flavor in each bite.  My oven required one extra minute of baking time.

After a thorough review of the recipe and studying many of your comments. I made These Macadamia Nut White Chocolate cookies. They turned out really great. Here are the changes I made:
1.	I used ½ cup of Butter and ½ cup of Buttered Flavored Crisco
2.	I substituted the vanilla with a Teaspoon of Nielsen- Massey Pure Vanilla Bean Paste. 
3.	I grated and added one teaspoon of Lemon peel.
4.	I followed the balance of the Recipe
5.	I then weighed each one on a gram scale to be an exact .65 of an ounce.
6.	I then flattened each one with the bottom of a small glass that was first lightly pressed into some white sugar.
7.	I “tucked “the edges in order to get uniformity.
8.	THE BIGGEST CHANGE WAS baking them on a Sil Pat Pan Liner which was placed on a cookie sheet @ 350 degrees for 12 minutes rotating the pan in the oven at 6 minutes.
9.	This made 58 cookies and they were fantastic. This will be the Cookie I make from now on for family and friends.

I made this recipe as is, and it came out perfectly. I didn't let the butter come to room temperature, I only let it soften a bit. Then after I mixed the dough, I let it chill for a little while. They didn't spread out too thin. Will definitely make these again!

This is a wonderful recipe. I only changed the amount of the macadamia nuts (adding the whole bag which was slightly more than the cup that was called for) and I added the whole bag of white chocolate chips too. My husband loved these and I think the almond flavor really adds a lot!

Good. I couldn't taste the almond extract.  I think it would be fine to use all vanilla extract.  The cookie spread.  I used half shortening and half butter.  I also chilled the dough in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.  Cookies took 16 minutes instead of 10.

This recipe is delicious!! I made the recipe as is but i made it into a cookie bar with a tiny layer of Graham cracker on the bottom. Baked it for about 13 minutes because of the crust and it was amazing. A must try for everyone!!

Great cookies! I made a heart shaped cookie cake with these, cooked at about 300F for 20-30mins- the left over dough I made into cookies that baked at the same temp for about 13 minutes and came out beautiful. My first time making macadamia cookies. In general I'm used to recipes that call for 1tsp vanilla paired with 1/2 tsp almond, so I used half the almond this recipe calls for and followed other reviews and used 1/2 butter flavored shortening with 1/2 butter. Turned out great, but I found them to be a little too sweet with the sweetened white chocolate, which is probably good because it keeps you from eating too many! But next time I think I'll cut it down to 1/4 cup sugar. Definitely want to mix this more by hand, don't use the mixer too much.

Mine turned out really yummy!!  Could not stop eating them.  I used a little less almond extract because i read some reviews that said the almond flavour was a little strong.  I put extra vanilla to make up for the almond.  They cooked very quickly.  Keep an eye on them and check them after 7 or 8 minutes.  None of mine took 10 minutes.  I am not sure how some people had tasteless cookies??  With the sugar, white chocolate and both the vanilla and almond extract...seems pretty much impossible.  I think next time I will use less sugar and I am sure they will still be awesome.

Not convinced...
Did the recipe pretty close from the instructions (I just didn't pack the brown sugar as I try another recipe last week with about the same quantities that ended up too sweet) and I ended up with a bunch of under cooked looking (with the bottom of the cookie slightly too brown (and i do have a thermometer in my oven)) cake like cookies...
I wonder what I did wrong.... did i over mixed ? or something else ?

I made exactly as the recipe states....just used white chocolate chips. The butter made them soft & chewy, the almond extract added the perfect touch.  My granddaughter's request....her favorite cookie!!    This is a GREAT recipe

As others noted, the texture of these is not right.  I don't think I over mixed; just think the ratio of ingredients is off.  Will look for a different recipe. Flavor was decent though.

I made these for my brother, who has yet to try them, because they are his favorite. I used 1/2c. Crisco and 1/2c. butter. I also used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. almond extract. I only had 1/2 c. of macadamia nuts so I used a bit more white chocolate chips. They baked perfectly at 10 1/2 minutes. They are fluffy and just perfect. I am not a fan of the taste of macadamia nut cookies or white chocolate chips, but these were pretty good!

I just made these. Actually, they are in the oven as I type this.  I do want to say, the dough taste great. The only changes I made were these, I used a full teaspoon of vanilla extract/flavoring, as suggested by others, I used pasteurized egg whites instead of whole eggs, I omitted the white granulated sugar and only used the brown sugar(no,I did not increase the amount of brown sugar)and I omitted the salt, as I used 1 cup of salted butter.  The cookies are currently puffing up beautifully and I suspect they will flatten once removed from the oven. I also used my Kitchenaid to mix the dough. Did it on low. Creamed the butter with the baking soda and sugar first, then added the wet ingredients, then the flour. Ok, these taste really good. Will definitely make these again. They are buttery and rich. For the butter, I used real butter. Brand: Challenge. Almost forgot, I did not have any problems with the butter, cookies, spreading.

I took the other reviewers' advice and used half shortening.  Since my nuts and butter were unsalted, I needed slightly more salt.  Also, I made the cookies larger than the recipe called for.  Delicious!!

These cookies were fabulous.  I did 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening like the other reviewers suggested.  I also did not have any macadamia nuts so I used walnuts.  They were a big hit...This one is a keeper.

Good, not great. First, I find them much too sweet for my own personal taste. I also should have listened to the reviewer that suggested leaving out the almond extract. It tastes good, but it also turns the cookies into an almond & white chocolate cookie & the macadamias get a little lost. That said, I will try this recipe again without the almond and about half the sugar.

Meh..followed recipe exactly, but cookies are a little bland. Maybe this type of cookie is supposed to have a mild flavor, but I think next time I'll stick to a regular chocolate type cookie.

I subbed 1 stick salted butter and 1/2 cup Crisco Butter flavored shortening and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. I hate cakey cookies so I was nervous when I saw them puffed up in the oven but as they were cooling they flattened. Lacked a little bit of sweetness. I might have to keep trying different recipes until I can get a perfect flavor.

After reading most of the reviews and getting thoroughly confused, I made it just as written because it sounded right.  Bingo! It was exactly right.  I am old school and use a wooden spoon and a glass bowl so maybe that's the difference.  I did add two minutes to the cooking time because I use parchment paper, and they were gone in no time.  My family loved them.  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely the BEST recipe I have found for these cookies.  Using another reviewers recommendation, I did not use my mixer and added the dry ingredients by folding them in.  What a wonderful secret to share!

I've made this cookie 3 times now and it always turns out great.  Last time I added a little extra van and almond and it was too much on the almond so definitely stick with 1/2 tsp.  Other than that I think this recipe is good to go!  Thank you!

This is a 10 star receipt!! The only thing different I did was I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and I added 1 cup of flaked coconut. I chilled the dough in the fridge for about 30 min. then formed into 1 inch balls, and lightly patted down with my finger-tips. Lightly floured hands works best for shaping 1 inch dough balls.
MY boyfriend ate 10 of the 1st dozen that came out the oven. I know the guys at his coffee club will love them just as much as we did. 0(*@*)0

Amazing cookies. So delicious! I changed brown sugar to 1 cup, used 1 tsp vanilla and no almond extract. Also baked at 360 for 9-10 mins and came out golden. Perfect! I do agree that butter should not be too soft. Can't go wrong with these cookies.

These were absolutely beautiful. Much better than any shop bought cookies. I'm going to use this as a base recipe and experiment with other flavours, although the white chocolate and macadamia tasted delicious!!

Very good, but too much almond extract! Like at least one other reviewer said, the almond seems to overpower the other flavors. Next time, I'll try this recipe with half the almond extract, and more white chocolate chips and macadamias (I think the recipe could use at least a 1/4 cup extra of the white choc and the nuts).

This is my boyfriend's favorite type of cookie so I was browsing for a recipe to surprise him one day. I am glad I picked this one! I've made these for him a few times now and have made just a few changes...I use a whole bag of white choc chips instead of the chopped choc, increase the vanilla to a full tsp and omit the almond, and one time I added a handful of dried cranberry/blueberry mix and that was a nice change. I also don't let the butter get too soft otherwise my cookies get really flat - I let it sit on the counter for only 20-30 mins or so.

Really dissatisfied. Cookies turned out dry and cake like. Maybe add another half cup butter?

I made a gluten free version by substituting the flour for GF flour and adding some xanthan gum. I also substituted the macadamia nut for brazil nuts. A great crunch.

I thought these cookies were delicious when baked following the recipe.  I decided to try a batch of cookies using peanut butter chips and peanuts in them (some were rolled in corn flake crumbs before baking) and they were great, too!  Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe and I have no idea what happened  I followed all of the directions and even did it with my friend and used the check boxes to make sure we added all the ingrediance and within 5 min there was smoke coming out of my oven and the cookies turned to mush. I am a very experianced baker and this has never happened to me.

My daughter asked for these cookies for her birthday.  I hesitantly agreed since macadamias are pricey.  But anything for my baby.  We doubled up on the batch and froze part of the dough.  For a few consecutive nights I made my husband, son and daughter 3 cookies each.  They devoured them.  On her actual birthday, the teenage girls left no crumbs!  They were a hit.

Everyone loved these cookies! I used half shortening per other comments. I also added dried blueberry flavor craisins to half the dough to try, and that was wonderful. Added a nice chewy element and enhanced the almond flavoring.

Wonderful cookies! I followed the other suggestions of using 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, as well as using only vanilla and lining my baking sheets with parchment paper. They came out incredible! Perfect texture and flavor. I will be making these again. :)

Very good cookies, though I did not have enough vanilla and had to sub almond extract. I actually divided the cookies and added peach marmalade to half for friend's birthday. You didn't get a peach flavor, it actually made the cookies really chewy and enhanced the flavors that were already present. The half made according to the recipe was crispier.

I used the 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening that was recommended and these came out perfect.  They are a new favorite at our house and every bit as good as what we get at the bakery.

I followed the recipe as stated except I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp, as I didn't have any almond extract.  I had no problems with them being too thin or spreading out on the cookie sheet.  I'm not the best one to rate these cookies, as they are not favorite in general.  I made them for the BF...hoping they'll be a hit with him!

These turned out really yummy! I cant give 5 stars because I wasnt able to taste the nut that well. 

Next time make these I will add 1/4 cup more nuts.  Other than that they were great!  I also used vanilla instead of almond.

These are wonderful as is! I love the almond flavor. BUT we're trying to cut out dairy and eggs......so I did a vegan version. This vegan version are the best cookies to come out of my oven! I simply replaced the butter with Earth Balance and the eggs with Eneg G egg replacer powder. Guess this works with any cookie!! I will make these again and again!

Excellent recipe.  My cookies turned out full and fluffy.  I may try to press them flat a little before putting into the oven next time to see if I prefer them a little crispier, but the flavor was great.

These are okay. Not the best Macadamia Nut Cookies I've had, but I'd make them again and they are tasty. The family likes them.

These are cakey cookies when done with softened butter, but they are still beautiful to look at and to eat!

I skipped the almond extract and they're still perfect!

My co-workers rated this cookie 5+ stars and demanded that I write a review.  
I made this recipe as directed with one minor adjustment of cutting the almond extract in half to 1/4 of a tsp. 
On another note, I do make my own brown sugar (1Tbl of molasses to 1C of white sugar) and have been told this has added a depth to all my cookies.
Thank you Allrecipes for another winning recipe.

So delicious!  I made these cookies today for the first time.  I followed some advice from other people and used half a cup of butter and the other half with butter flavoured Crisco.  I also went with 1/4 tsp. almond flavouring and 3/4 tsp. of vanilla.  The cookies held their shape well, not much spreading at all, and the middles were so fluffy....the way we like them.  I find when using just butter, the cookies spread and become thin and crunchy.  We don't like crunchy cookies.....either fluffy or chewy.  This recipe is a keeper and I will make them again in the future.  Hubby loved them.  Thank you for sharing, Mary!

These are great the way they are. I added extra vanilla and omitted the almond, but its good with the almond too. I also like to add a little bit of flaxseed and use organic sugar.

Will try this recipe one more time. I've never made cookies from scratch before so I don't know if I didn't "cream" the butter sugar mix enough...but I think it could be better. Hubby enjoyed the cookies with no hesitation though.

I am generally not a fan of non-chocolate cookies.  So when a friend asked for Macadamia Nut cookies, I was at a loss!  I am so glad I found this recipe!  I substituted half the butter with butter flavored Crisco like another rater had suggested and they turned out absolutely perfect.  Soft, buttery, and delicious.  I will definitely make these again!

These were fantastic!  The only change I made was to use 3/4tsp of vanilla and 1/4tsp of almond extract.  I dropped them by tablespoons instead of teaspoons.  Everyone loved them.  They were soooo good!

My husband has declared that these are the best cookies I've ever made, and I'm pretty good in the cookie department. I followed the advice of others and did 1/2 cup butter but forgot about the Crisco...so I'm sure they'll be ever more amazing next time.  Sooo Tasty!!

I've made this recipe several times now and decided to rate it. I love these cookies! I don't use almond extract because I never seem to have it. With my oven the cook time is more like 8 minutes. I like mine a little flat and chewy so when they are almost finished baking, I lift the cookie sheet and drop it a couple times.

Chewy and delicious!  I can see how some people think these cookies turn out too puffy, but the puffiness goes away once the cookies have cooled.  The only change I made to the recipe was that I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening.  I'm sure I will be making these cookies for years to come.

I followed some of the others advice and did 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco...also I had to bake mine at 325, they were burning on bottom.  But at 325 they were perfect in 10 mins.  Great recipe!

This recipe was great. I used the exact ingredient amounts (a little less nuts bc I didnt have anymore) and it turned out great. I did have puffy cookies which I have had problems with in the past (baked on a cookie sheet). My solution...bake them on a stone instead of a baking sheet (it dispurses the heat more evenly).

This was a great cookie!  My cookies came out soft and chewy and were still chewy the next day.  I give it 4 stars because of all the changes I made based on everyone's comments - I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c shortening, added 1/2 tea baking powder, doubled the white chocolate chips and doubled the macadamia nuts.  I baked it for 8 minutes which was perfect.  Next time I will add a little more salt because I think the cookie was perfect except it needed a dash more salt.  With all the changes this cookie was absolutely perfect.

these are great - they won my office holiday cookie contest!  try using brazil nuts if you don't have any macadamia nuts (or want to go with a cheaper version) - the flavor is not the same, but is very tasty and different!  and honestly, i have never found a good use for brazil nuts until now!

I followed the recipe exactly.  10 min. was perfect!  They are light and buttery, and chewy...  Next time I will try a bit less of the almond and the 1/2 shortning...  but mine didnt spread and look just like the one's in the picture!

I don't know what happened. I'm an intermediate baker and when I saw the reviews that these cookies were flat I was excited because that's what I like. However, i followed the directions exactly and mine came out like little hockey pucks! The taste was great but not very eye appealing. Maybe my butter needed to a little more soft/ slightly runny. Oh well...I'll keep searching.

Just made a batch of cookies and it tastes amazing. 10 minutes will make it slightly crunchy on the sides and soft in the middle. I managed to make it entirely crunchy as well. The texture is very light and melts in your mouth.  I think it uses too much butter though. I cut it from 225g to 200g butter instead and it still feels like I could have used less. Used choc chip instead of chunky chocolate.  Would have loved to know what this tasted like with almond extract but it tasted just fine with vanilla only.

White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cookies are my favourite and this was my first time actually making them myself (I usually buy them). This recipe is AWESOME!!! I used half butter and half shortening as others have suggested. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.   The cookie dough also freezes very well.

AMAZING! This is my new favorite cookies recipe. I think what made it extra yummy was that I accidentally upped the amount of almond extract.

I love this recipe. I prepare exactly as listed except I never use the almond extract because I don't have it on hand. The cookies come out perfectly. My only advice is to double the recipe because once your friends and family found out you made them they go very quickly!

YUMMY!  One of my all-time favorites, and this recipe gave me exactly the taste I was looking for.  My family always craves this cookie, and the bit of almond extract gave it that extra zing it needed.  I will be making them again!

These cookies were amazing! I took the advice of others and use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. I also used all vanilla extract because i didnt have almond. Probably the best cookies i've ever made from scratch. I wish they were more cookie like. They weren't flat cookies, more cake-like. But that was perfectly fine with me. Delicious either way. I will definitely keep this recipe for future use.

I didn't have issues with these being flat. I used all butter and they were still wonderful. Didn't have the almond stuff though so I just left it out.

I just pulled my last pan out of the oven and could not be more pleased!!! I have always liked this kind of cookie but was afraid to try and bake them.  I am glad that it was this recipe I tried first.  Always nice to get it right the first time and these cookies are great.

These white chocolate macadamia nut cookies are so delicious. They're better than any I've bought at any bakery!  I followed the recipe with the exception of the almond extract. I didn't have that nor a cookie sheet. I used 2 9x9s and made cookie "bars".  They were a big hit. My family loved them. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Just tried this recipe and it turned out perfect...just like you'd buy in a bakery!  I used the tip to cut the butter into 1/2c butter/ 1/2 cup shortening and only used vanilla because it's all I had.  They are fabulous, nice and chewy, spread just a little bit to make a nice shape.  Will definitely make again!

Ugh. My boss loves macadamia nut cookies and I always make him some for Christmas. I should have stuck with the recipe I usually make (the one on the site w/o the brown sugar) but I felt like trying this one. I used half shortening, the butter wasn't too cold. But even after popping the dough in the fridge for awhile every batch of these flattened to a runny mess. Not sure what went wrong!

OH my, yum! These had the perfect, crisp edges, soft and buttery insides. Loved the pure taste of butter, white chocolate and mac nuts. I am making a bunch of this dough for gifts this year. It is easy to make, with simple ingredients, but gourmet tasting.

This is the first time I’ve made these cookies and they were delicious and easy to make!!  I used ½ shortening and ½ butter like other people recommended, and my cookies were perfect.  They were nicely formed and didn’t get flat at all.  I did use an extra ¼ cup of both macadamia nuts and white chocolate (a total of 1¼ c of each).  I only used approximately ¼ tsp of the almond extract – I didn’t like the flavor, nor did the other people eating the cookies – so in the future I’ll be using vanilla extract only, which will make these cookies 5-star in my book.

I'm so glad I picked this recipe for my first time baking these cookies. They came out perfectly amazing! I too tweeked it a little, 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortning and used only vanilla but i used about 3 tablespoons ( i really like vanilla) i also added about a cup more macadamias and chopped them fine and about a half cup more white chocolate. I also gave them a little pat down after the first tray didnt fall but about a 1/4 inch from the scoop size.  I cant wait to share these cookies with everyone i know.

This recipe was yummy, yummy, yummy.  I followed the recipe ingredients to the letter.  The almond extract adds a little something special.  I'm glad I had some on hand to use.  Only changes I made was to refrigerate the dough and I used tablespoon sized cookies.  They were wonderfully crisp around the edges and soft in the center.  Delicious.

These cookies are to die for.  I tried the half butter/half crisco version too.  Also, cooked on parchment paper and they came out perfecto.  Can't wait until the boy gets them in the mail to hear the reviews!

Awesome!   I did make two changes... 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening, plus I added 1 t. of vanilla and omitted the almond.   Plus, I chilled the dough 2 hours before baking.

This cookie was just ok... I think 10 minutes was too long to bake as they burned on the bottom......

Substitutions: I only had dark brown sugar(not light)...doubled vanilla as I did not have almond extract...and used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour. I also used chips as I did not have a chunk of chocolate......Baked on parchment paper. Maybe my new oven runs hot?...........I tried a second batch and watched it closely about 8.5 minutes. They were much better asnd did not burn. Still not a 5 star in my opinion. Probably all the substitutions.

These cookies were complemented OUTSIDE of my presence on two occasions. I wouldn't change anything about the recipes. However, unless you keep the cookies small, I would estimate about 3 dozen cookies rather than 4.

Definitely a bit too dry.  I'd probably add 1/2 cup less of flour next time :-)  Possibly, more almond extract too.

These weren't bad, but they weren't the cookies I was hoping for. Mine came out crisp and I wanted them soft and chewy, and they spread a bit too much for me. I got a little over 60 cookies with this recipe.

Made these for hubby who loves both white chocolate and macadamia nuts....these were good.  The cookies did flatten a bit when in the oven.  That was the only complaint.  Will make again.  Thanks for the post.

This just isn't "it" as far as a killer White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cookie. I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with a very flat cookie with a couple of bumps from the nuts. I will make these again and play with the recipe a bit to find a thicker cookie. Thanks for the base recipe.

I have never made white choc. macadamia nut cookies before, however ate them quite frequently at cafes. I followed the recipe exactly and they seem to have worked out just as told. I am used to the flat ones but these were yummy too.

This recipe is what I have been searching for for years!  These are my favorite cookies and I have never been able to make them myself to my satisfaction.  I used all butter flavored Crisco and they were SO good.  The almond adds a great flavor.

These were just ok for us. A little too dry and cake-like. I also didn't find them sweet enough, but some people might like that. I prefer the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies IV recipe (also on this site).

Thought they were very good and everyone loved them. I think  imay have added too much almond extract, but nonethless I like almonds so it worked out fine.

These cookies were delicious, but the texture was too cake-like. So I added a little more butter and brown sugar. I also added chuncked white chocolate, rather than chips - made for good suprise bits throughout.

These were very good. I think they could be a little sweeter. But that didn't stop me and everyone else from eating them up. I wish I had one now!! YUM....

Excellent recipe! I was actually looking for a white chocolate blueberry cookie and came across this one. I did sub macadamian nuts with blueberries and used 1/2 cup lard and 1/2 cup butter and didn't have almond extract so used 1t vanilla. They were so moist and delicious. Someone even commented that they looked professional enough to sell! Thanks!

I think I must have done something wrong because these ended up being more like a cake then the thin cookie I'm used to.

These were very good.  I don't like nuts, so I left out the macadamias and added an additional 1/2 cup of white chocolate.  I used chocolate chips instead of chunks, which still turned out nicely.  I also followed the advice of others and used half butter and half butter flavored crisco shortening, and left out the almond extract, again because I don't like nuts.

I made these cookies for a cookout and they were a huge hit! Very good. I even liked them and I'm not usually a fan of sweets.

I couldn't believe the reaction I got when everyone tasted these cookies! Everyone thought that I bought them from a cookie store! (I won't mention which store, but people thought I had broke the secret to a certain Mrs.' recipe!)
