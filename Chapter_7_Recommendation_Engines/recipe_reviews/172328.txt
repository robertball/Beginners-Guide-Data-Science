I am the submitter of this recipe.  The last time I made it, I used panko bread crumbs and regular seasoned bread crumbs.  It comes out crispier this way when baked.  My eggplants were also small, so I used 1 TBS breading inside and 1 TBS served on the side.  Also make sure your eggplant slices are cooked all the way through b/c the last 5 minutes just heats to serve, it doesn't cook it much more.

This recipe is fabulous! Takes time but is way worth it.  Everyone raved about it and not a morsel was left.  I will be cooking this recipe again, now I finally have a good eggplant recipe.

alot of work. saying 80 minutes total is not realistic. more like 3-4 hours. it is very good, but be prepared, even with my husbands help, unless you have more than 2 hands, it will take you longer!
