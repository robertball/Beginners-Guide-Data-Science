I normally don't like artificial banana flavoring, but these were delicious!!! Instead of shortening I used 1/3 c butter and 1/3 c oil...and then I used only 2 c flour. I decreased the baking time to 7 mins and they turned out perfectly moist and incredibly yummy!!!

Nice soft cookie with lots of banana flavor. I rolled them into a log and sliced to bake. I might try a little drizzle or frosting on them next time.

I used cheesecake flavored pudding because I didn't know what else to do with it. They turned out pretty good.

You know, this recipe wasn't bad.  It definitely has a fake banana taste...but I think with a different flavored pudding it would be fantastic!  The cookie itself is nummy...great texture.  I would try white chocolate, french vanilla or coconut cream pudding. Also, I used 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup shortening and frosted per other reviewers with Sugar Cookie Icing.  I will definitely be experimenting with other flavors...oohhh maybe a butterscotch pudding! mmm!

I made these this morning exactly as the recipe specified.

These were....different. Kind of like eating banana bread in cookie form. I think the Sugar Cookie Frosting I used made it a little better. 

Refrigerating this dough is not crucial
for making these cookies. This dough was plenty firm enough and I think the refrigeration made them a little more difficult to work with. Make sure you keep an eye on them and not to burn them and you'll have to flatten them with your hand, they don't spread.

I'd make these again, only using a different flavor of pudding mix. I bet
chocolate would be good. I'd like to work with this recipe and see if I can't make it a little less dry. Not sticking it in the fridge would help and possibly
adding half a mashed banana.

A wonderful cookie! I doubled this recipe. Except I only used only 4 cups of flour (not 5) and rolled the balls in chopped walnuts. They were actually better the day after I made them. Moist and delicious with a hint of banana flavoring. I've already had 5 requests for the recipe.

these were really great!  my entire family (including two picky boys) loved them.  in fact, as soon as my 12yo took a bite he said, "you need to make these more often!"  definitely use a stand mixer when making these cookies, and 2 1/4 C. flour is enough.  they tasted just like a lighter version of banana pudding.  and they were so yummy warm just out of the oven!  i can't wait to experiment with other flavors!

wonderful~ I followed recipe using 1/3c.butter and 1/3 c.shortening, (only because I didnt have enough shortening).Im gonna cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.. they rolled out nice and I had no problem cutting them with cookie cutters , baked up beautiful without any spreading like many sugar cookies tend to do.I frosted them too~DELISH. This is a keeper recipe! Even my daughter who tends to be very critical of frosted sugar cookies LUVS EM. Thanks for the great recipe :)

I was really excited to bake this cookie because I've been looking for a twist on the normally quite bland sugar cookie. I used vanilla pudding instead of banana for a more traditionally flavored cookie. I also used a bit less flour, as other people have stated. The cookies turned out fine, but I was expecting something more. Icing them with "Sugar Cookie Icing" really added flavor and appeal to the cookies, however. Good recipe, although I'm not sure I'd try them again. Thanks though!

We already have a great banana sugar cookie recipe, but I was dying to try this recipe, so I used pistachio pudding and added a few finely chopped pistachio nuts.  They were great.  Thanks, Tina.

I had high hopes for these cookies. I love banana and the idea just sounded really neat. But... I ended up really disliking the cookies. My grandma was the only one that really liked them, and even then I wonder WHY she liked them. After adding about 1 1/2 or 1 3/4 cup of flour, I liked the consistency of the dough, but it said to add 2 cups of flour and then the extra 1/2 if needed. So I added up to 2 cups of flour, and then it seemed like my dough became too crumbly and the cookies too floury. I hated the fake banana taste of the banana pudding, though the cookies might have been better with another flavour, or if you like the fake banana taste. People said they tasted like sugar cookies, but if this is what sugar cookies taste like, maybe I just really don't like them. I would never make these again.

This recipie works great with any flavor of pudding.  I've even used pistachio pudding when I was out of everything else.  It only changes the color slightly-hardly even noticable.

The recipe worked out as indicated.  (I used 2 1/4 cups of flour.)  If you like banana pudding, you won't be disappointed.

Delicious!  I made these last night with VANILLA pudding.  They were wonderful!  5 Stars for being able to follow the recipe exactly using 2 1/4 cups flour and for finally finding a sugar cookie that doesn't end up tasting like flour.  Iced with "Sugar Cookie Icing" from allrecipe.com to dry hard and beautiful.
