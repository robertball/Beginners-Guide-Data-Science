I questioned the fact that there is no salt in this recipe and made it according to directions anyway. It is a terrific bread and the addition of salt would make it even better. I found an identical recipe that calls for 1 1/2 tsp salt.

I changed this recipe slightly to work with what we had on hand.  I used 1 cup freshly chopped flax seed. (The body just passes out whole flax seed and you lose the nurtitional value unless you chop or grind it)  I will try it with the sunflower seeds added in the future, but was out of them at this time. I used butter rather than margarine and used all freshly ground Hard White Prarie Gold Wheat.  I cracked the Prarie Gold for the cracked wheat. I was boiling potatoes to mash so I poured the water off of them for the hot water in the recipe.
The bread turned out great.  My entire family loved it. We even made sandwiches out of it. It was suprisingly light for a bread that had seeds in it.  One daughter said it made great toast.
My Husband is a very picky eater and requested I send some in his lunch today.  This is a bread I will bake again and again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is very good, hearty without being overly heavy.  I agree with another reviewer that it could use a little salt, and it does make 2 HUGE loaves.  My starter is a very sweet and liquidy one -- I find that it works best if I feed 2 cups of it with a cup of flour and let sit overnight, then proceed from there.  I also found that it needs a much longer rise time.  I don't know how you get sourdough bread without any additional yeast to rise this quickly.  I give the first rise overnight, the second rise does not need quite as long.

Absolutely wonderful!  I left our the sunflower seeds, didn't have any, and used butter instead of margarine, never use the stuff.  Tastes wonderful, great texture.  Rate this on 5 stars for sure!!!

I am new to bread making, so maybe I am doing something wrong, but this bread just doesn't turn out right.  I have made it twice, and I must have had to potent of a starter, because in the first rise, after the hour and a half it had tripled.... same for the second rise.  Then when I put it in the pans, it hardly rose at all, and the bit that it did rise, it fell flat after putting th egg wash on and while baking.
Today I made it again, this time with a more aged starter.  It rose about right for the first two rises, and rose good for the pan rise, (although it took two hours instead of the one called for) but again fell after I put the egg wash on (I was very gentle) and baking.  It didn't fall as much this time though.  The bread tastes too "sour" and doesn't have good "bread" texture.  (I am sure that  is from falling.)  
I might try making this again, but with half the starter called for, and then just let it rise once before putting it in the pans.  I am afraid to waste my time again though. *sigh*
(BTW:  Last week I made a basic sourdough bread recipe with the same sourdoug starter, and it worked out perfect, so I don't think it is my starter.)
**The bread did rise (with no extra yeast) and so many other people like it, that I give it four stars.  Maybe I am doing something wrong, and maybe other people like bread that "sour".

I am relatively new to sourdough (3 months or so).  I made this bread with my own "homegrown" sourdough made from white flour and pineapple juice.  It worked! - it just took time and patience.  I've been baking some sort of sourdough bread weekly since then.  I love a heavy bread that is full of whole grains and this is one of those.  At first I made the bread as written but have tried variations (added oatmeal, used only molasses vs. half honey etc.).  My sourdough works best when well fed - I usually keep it in the refrigerator during the week and take it our Thursday night or Friday morning for Saturday baking.  My base (the amount kept for later baking) is a small amount (1/4 cup or so) to allow for multiple feedings of flour and water just before baking spaced about 6 to 8 hours apart.  Well fed starter makes the difference for me as to whether my bread will rise without using commercial yeast.  Before putting back into the refrigerator I feed the small amount reserved from baking (1/4 cup) with an equal amount of flour and a very small amount of water to make a very thick batter - this helps the starter to keep in the cold until taken back out a day or so before baking.

Excellent!  It does need a touch of salt- I think I will take another reviewer's advice and make a biga of starter/some flour the day before making the final dough, then adding some salt.

I cut this recipie in half and I still got 2 9x5 loaves.  This was Delicious!!!  Great Sandwhich bread and I'm sure as my starter matures, the bread will taste even better.

5 stars, This was the first sourdough bread that turned out for me. I made it like the recipe says except added 4 t. salt and used all honey instead of the molasses and it turned out great. I have made it a second time now and I love it. The taste is wonderful.

Wow, it took me two days but well worth it! It's probably my own starter but I had to give it lots of time to rise, plus we live on the northcoast so I had to set it by the wood stove to get it to rise.  I used toasted, salted pumpkin seeds instead of raw sunflower seeds and it added the missing salt. My family ate it all week and left the store bought bread alone.  The next weeks batch, I experimented adding an extra tablespoon of honey, an extra 1/2 tablespoon of molasses, 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, and a cup of chopped dried fruit; a mixture of raisins, dried cherries, cranberries and dates to total 2 cups of fruit and nuts.  Rather then using loaf pans I put the dough in grapefruit sized balls for the final rise and ended up with 5 beautiful 'breakfast fruit and nut'  round loaves that go into the toaster perfectly. Can't wait for the next combination to this great base recipe.

Delicious loaf but with some flavor component elusively missing. After making a few loaves it dawned on me: it needs salt. It's also not as "sour" as some sourdoughs I make.

I halve the recipe and bake one very large free form loaf on a baking stone. I give the loaf one long slash and skip the egg wash. I spray the loaf with water several times during baking to encourage a bit of a crisp crust, but this is not a loaf that gets very crisp. I haven't used the flax seeds since that's not an ingredient I use much. I also use butter instead of margarine. I also do the whole recipe start to finish in one bowl in the Kitchen Aid and knead for 5-6 minutes on medium-low speed.

My husband adores this bread so am looking forward to his reaction to our next loaf with a little salt in it. This is definitely one of the staple breads in our house now. It doesn't get much easier to make than this.

I have wanted to make cracked wheat sourdough for ages but i thought it would be complicated, but to my surprise it was so easy and such a good taste. I had no problem with the rise as i added some vitamin c powder, and no yeast, i dont think you should use yeast if your sourdough is active and mine is very active. I did add some salt about a teaspoon,other than that i followed the recipe will make it again most definitely

I can't rate this recipe with a good conscience because I have to think it was my fault it was very dense and not at all fluffy as some said it was. The dough was so stiff after I added the first 2 c. flour that I couldn't add but one more cup instead of the 3 called for. Rising was very slow and never made it above the pan rim.  I have left my email address if anyone has any help for me on what I might have done wrong or could have done.  Please see my profile for the address. Thanks.

This was one of the best breads I have made.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  It turned out moist and chewy with a light crisp crust.  I added pumpkin seeds on top.  Everyone loved it.  Sliced thin it was great for sandwiches.

Every bread recipe needs salt. I added my normal 3/4 tsp salt/loaf. Without salt the bread will rise way to fast and have a dead flavor.

The ingredients work great, although I took a different approach as a test and it worked.  I used a favorite sourdough recipe from Sourdough.com which starts with 4 cups of unbleached flour, 2 cups water and one cup of starter letting it proof overnight.  Then added in all the goodies and used whole  wheat flour to get my dough to the consistency I wanted and let if proof two hours before baking.  Also used barley malt instead of molasses. I made two batches, with this and left the other loaf using only unbleached flour, so the same overnight proofing on both and only the finishing was different.  I like the nutty, seedy whole wheat kind and my wife likes the white.  Works out well.

This bread was really good! I do miss the salt and will ad a little next time I make it. also will grind the flax seed. Everything else was fine. It takes a little longer to rise than regular yeast bread but it's worth it! I have not made bread with just sourdough before but it worked out great!

My family loved this bread.  As other reviewers suggested, I added 1 tsp. yeast and 1 tsp salt.  We love the fact that it has so many healthy grains in it.  It is great toasted too.  Next time I will let it bake a little longer as the center was a little "doughy"

Add salt to the recipe!
Excellent flavor, needs salt!  I followed the recipe and the first bite, I said, I forgot the salt.  After re-reading the recipe, I saw salt was missing.  I would add 1-2 tsp. the next time. The flavor of this bread is absolutely WONDERFUL!!

I really liked this recipe, but I found that there was no yeast listed in the ingredients. I don't know if this was a typo or not, but the dough would not rise without adding yeast. I added yeast on my second attempt and everything went just as planned. Bread tastes great!!

This is a fabulous recipe!  It turned out light and delicious.  The dough rose so much I had trouble punching it down.  Next, I am going to try it using freshly ground flour from wheat berries.  I love this bread!

I used this recipe as a jumping board because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I am an experienced bread maker so wasn't afraid to change things a little, and it turned out excellent.  I only had two cups of sourdough so I used 2 tsp of yeast, too.  I didn't have cracked wheat handy, so I used the same amount of amaranth.  Instead of whole wheat, I used spelt flour.  I just prefer spelt.  I didn't use the egg wash and my bread turned out with a wonderful crust. I didn't spray with water either.  I didn't have sunflower seeds or flax seed so they were omitted, too.  I cooked it till it was 180 degrees. This is a new favorite for our family. It made two, two pound loaves of bread.

This is delicious bread. I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars, because like other reviewers, I think both salt and yeast are needed. I added 1/2 teaspoon and used salted butter, and I added 1 teaspoon yeast. The crust was a little too chewy for sandwiches but toasted was excellent.

This is very good bread.  I did a little trouble getting it to rise.  I think the next time I will use some yeast also.  I did increase the amount of salt per others suggestions.  Also I used all honey because I didn't have any molasses on hand.  This made great sandwiches too.  I will diffently be making this often.

The recipe wasn't clear to retain about 1/2 of the flour to knead, so it gets really gooey.  I used salted pumpkin seeds too, and maple syrup instead of honey.  Love the flavor!

This is a really great bread except that I also feel that it needs salt and yeast.  I agree with the other reviewer who would add 1-1/2 teaspoons salt and I would also start out adding yeast as well.  My dough had done nothing after 2 1/2 hours on a warm day, so I sprinkled 2 envelopes of yeast over the dough and worked it in.  This is 1-1/2 tablespoons if you are using bulk yeast.  Other than that, it was very tasty and I loved the hearty texture of it.  Will definitely make again.

This is one of our my favourite sourdough bread recipes.  I do add 1 1/2 tsp salt.  It turns out wonderful everytime.  I do usually make sure my sourdough has been fed and is good and active but the loaves are light and rise beautifully with wonderful flavour.

I have made several different sourdough breads, but this is hands down my favorite.  I made it according to the recipe with wheat and bread flours. It has a wonderful nutty, chewy texture and a light sweetness.  I prefer a heavier bread, so if you like fluffy breads, you may not care for it.   I also like that the recipes uses a lot of starter as I always am trying to use up starter. 

I did not have any molasses in the house so used the dark karo syrup that I had in the pantry.  It didn't give the same rich flavor so will pick up some black strap for the flavor and the health benefits.   

We had this with a lovely soup for supper and I feel very well fed.

10/19/19 - an update on my earlier review
I have made this bread numerous times now, probably 8 or more time.  Still love the bread!  I have found that the bread takes longer to rise than is written in the recipe and it takes some coaxing, too.  I will often put my dough (in a large bowl covered with plastic wrap and a damp dish towel) in a warm oven.  I say the total rising time from first rise until baked is five hours versus the 3 hours in the recipe.

The recipe doesn't have any salt - much needed. I would add at least 2 tsps. For the two loaves.

I really liked this bread and so did my husband, but my kids didn't care for it.  I used a sourdough starter recipe from this website and I also added salt.  In order to make just one loaf, I cut the recipe in half.  I think the recipe turned out great - great texture, great flavor.
