I loved this sauce.  Mistake was that I made it to go with ribs.  It is more a sauce for bullued pork or chopped beef.  Very tasty though.  Simple ingredients.  I'll make some pulled pork next week to do it right.

Great sauce! I experimented with it, added brown sugar, bbq sauce, smoke marinade. Lots of vinegar is the key.

I made this sauce to use with Sarge's EZ pulled pork bbq also from allrecipes and it was delicious.  The sauce is very runny so you have to eat your pork sandwich fast.  It has a nice spicy flavor to it.

If you like this style of sauce, this is a great recipe. It is easier than the tomato sauce and mustard sauces I usually make.

This is the best.  We also make Carolina slaw and use this sauce in it instead of mayo.  Just like Tommy's BBQ in Thomasville, NC.

I used this sauce and mopped it all over a beef brisket I barbequed. It kept the meat moist and spicy.

This is a lot like my favorite sauce from Fresh Air BBQ in Georgia. I ended up adding a good bit more (maybe 6 tbsp) ketchup, and about a tablespoon of brown sugar. I thought I'd omit the water, but it actually needs it - it's too strong without it.

I made this to use on the Slow Cooker Carolina BBQ dish. It was a perfect fit. I introduced it to friends on a boating outing and everyone wanted the recipe and said it was AMAZING

A little spicy for children; I decreased the cayenne pepper.
