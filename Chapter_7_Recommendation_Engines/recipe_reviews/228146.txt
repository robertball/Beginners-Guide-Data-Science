I'm sorry to say, this was not a sweet cheese ball. I followed exactly to a T and it looked like a muted pimento cheese spread.  I let set up in the frig for 12 hours from start to finish. You could not shape with hands, so because it still had that chunky look to it, I put it in my Ninja Processor to make it smooth. That thicken some but not enough to shape. And even on the plate trying to make a pumpkin...was difficult because it was slowly spreading south. The over all flavor, was really weird. I could taste the spices but there wasn't anything that screamed sweet savory...it was just a savory weird flavor. It probably would have held up better if the recipe stated 8 oz of cream cheese and not 1/2 the package. I served with Savory Triscuit Crackers, but after each person took one bite, no one wanted anymore. It's like hummus(and I love hummus)....guess you must really have to like the flavors and texture to like the recipe. I'm sorry to say, I won't be making again.

This recipe is always a hit! I've taken it to several gatherings and everyone raves about how yummy it is! I like to use a Colby Monterey Jack mix, and it works the best with finely shredded cheese. I like to pair it with apple slices, pretzels, celery and crackers. Yum!
