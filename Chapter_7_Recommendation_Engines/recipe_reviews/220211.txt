I was looking for another Faceless recipe. Well it took me over an hour to find this, it sure was worth the Wait!. I had bone in thighs and only let them marinade for 1 hours. Not sure why it seems everyone wants to throw away perfectly good marinade, when all you have to do is boil it first or use it on the meat prior to cooking. I rolled the chicken in the crumb mixture and poured the herbed oil over the chicken BEFORE I baked it! The oil helped the crumbs stick to the chicken and gave it a Super crispy crust! This chicken was moist and Very flavorful! I didn't have any basil so I used a little bit of dried tarragon. My DD and her friend sat down for dinner before they went out to a party and the friend loved the chicken! Hard to impress a teenage girl, seems I pulled it off:) Thank you rkbamom will make this again!

I made this as written with about 1 hour to marinate, because it was a last minute decision about what to cook. It turned out great!! Don't be afraid to be liberal with the spices. One bite in my husband insisted I add it to the rotation.

This recipe was a flop for me and my family. The taste of the chicken was probably 3 stars for me - I didn't struggle to get through it, but at the same time it was nothing to write home about. The thing that knocked it down to the next star was the texture left on my teeth after eating this.

This needs more reviews! :) Like the submitter, I didn't measure the spices, just used a generous amount - used dried basil because that's what I had, and used garlic powder because I have a love/hate relationship with minced garlic: I love it; it hates me. :) Made it simpler by pounding the breasts in a freezer Ziploc, then added the spices in the bag, poured the oil in, and mixed it well. Marinaded all day, flipping the bag a few times. Used 6 breasts so increased the topping, which I didn't need to do - I think the original amount would have covered 6 generously. Baked on a baking sheet covered with aluminum foil at 400 because I did not get them pounded as thin as directed, and ended up baking for about 40 minutes instead of 30 for the same reason. The chicken was amazingly moist; the topping was crispy; and the household says PLEASE put it in rotation!

I have made this twice now but used tilapia and my family absolutely loved it.  I didn't use fresh herbs but dry and it worked great.  I didn't have rosemary but it didn't matter and I also only marinated about 20 minutes and still wonderful. Highly recommend.

Made this tonight, I used regular pretzels and only marinated for about 30 minutes due to lack of planning. Also I had didn't have much EVO left so I mixed it with some butter for the garlic (that worked well I felt). This was pretty yummy, but didn't have the WOW factor that would have made me give 5 stars. I'll try to do it again and follow the recipe more closely to see if that changes my opinion. But my kids all ate it, so I'd definitely make it again.
