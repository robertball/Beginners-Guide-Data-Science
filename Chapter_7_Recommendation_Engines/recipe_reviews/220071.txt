Everybody in my family loved it. The cream cheese and the chopped sage is really what brings everything together at the end.

This was a great recipe!  I made a couple of changes.  First, I could not find dried cannelini beans in my grocery store, so I bought canned.  This cut out a step, and cut out some time.  Secondly, I added some white wine while it simmered, and thirdly, I completely left out the marscapone cheese, as I felt it tasted wonderful without it.

I love anything with beans.  And tomatoes.  And sausage.  This recipe has all of the above.  Hearty, delicious comfort food.  Sweet beans mixed with juicy tomatoes, savory spices, and delicious Johnsonville sausage.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Fantastic! I used real spicy Italian sausage and couldn't stop eating until this was finito! I added extra chili powder to spice it up. My husband loved it too. Thanks!

Great comfort food. Easy, too. I subbed kale for the celery and added a bunch more carrot.

This was delicious!  Be sure to have a loaf of really good bread to sop up the juices.  Fantastic!

I came to AllRecipes looking to duplicate a dish I had in Italy, one of those memorably simple meals that satisfy every comfort food bone in your body.  This is as close as I've found.  The only real change is the beans.  The beans I had in Italy were huge and meaty.  I have no idea what they were, but I used dried Scarlett Runner beans, which gave me the type of bean I was looking for.  Other than that, I made this recipe to a tee.  (Well... I also threw in a couple of generous handfuls of arugula I had laying around at the end, but that's just me.  Gotta have my greens!)  Thank you so much for posting it, Johnsonville!  Took me right back to that little trattoria in Treviso!

This was really really good. I did change a couple things but not anything drastic. I did use canned beans simply because I needed this to go faster. I cut bratwursts (thats what I had on hand) into thirds and fried then added to the bean mixture. I also served this over shell noodles just to make it a nice one dish meal.

Very good!  We loved the combination of sausage with the beans.  I used canned cannellini beans since I always have them in the pantry and couldn't find dried.  Next time, I'll add some more herbs for flavor (more sage & thyme), but this is a keeper.  Thanks!

Husband pleaser!  It's quick to make with canned beans, and works as a great base for extra spices like oregano.  Grilled sausage is a must!  We'll definitely make it again.

Great! I used canned Cannelini beans and kept everything else the same. Turned out great! The sausage cooks easily and the flavor perks up the beans! Mascarpone cheese adds a nice touch. Will definitely make again and again.

I was a little worried that the dish would be too soupy, so I cooked it hard for longer than indicated, but the addition of the cheese seemed to thicken it up, and it turned out very well.
