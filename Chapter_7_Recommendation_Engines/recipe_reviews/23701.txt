These were very tasty.  The only thing I will try different next time is to cut smaller sections of the pastry...they turned out a little doughy this time...but the filling was wonderful!

I read that people were saying that this was missing something - so I added in about 1/4 teaspoon curry poweder and voila  - AMAZING!

These were gobbled up quickly at my Halloween party.  I used homemade puff pastry.  I think a person could really experiment with the filling -- go with all mushrooms, use chicken or shrimp, etc.  I will be making these again.  Thanks, Cliff!

I also decreased the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon and it still had a bite to it.  I decreased the amount of mushrooms by a tad and added one can of small, broken shirmp.  I added about 1 tablespoon parmesan.  I had a difficult time keeping the corners together while baking.  Perhaps a little water would have helped.  Overall, I found them to be missing something.  they were a little bland.  Next time I think I'll add some garlic salt, crumbled bacon, and / or grated cheddar cheese; or even substitute the crab for shredded cooked chicken.  They definitely have potential.

These were yummy! I used the mini puff pastry shells, added a little shrimp, parmesean and ricotta.  It was really good.

I thought these puffs were very tasty.  The only thing I would add next time is a touch of garlic salt.  I had a hard time keeping the corners of the puff pastry together but will definitely try  again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were pretty good. They needed a little something extra, though, for flavor. I dripped some Tabasco on them and that did the trick. Maybe next time, I'll use mayo and a little blue cheese instead of cream cheese.

I tried a vegetarian version of this recipe using 1.5 cups chopped cabbage as a substitute for the crab and omitted the cream cheese. I doubled the recipe and so had no time to fold up the puffs as described here. I went with a 2.5" by 5" puff pastry rectangle that I folded in half over the filling and sealed the edges with a fork. I used a touch more garlic and some salt. The puffs bake pretty quick. Since the filling is already cooked, only the pastry needs to bake. The puffs disappeared pretty quickly at my super bowl party :-)

I loved this recipe! I made it for our Super Bowl party and it was a big hit.  I would recommend adding less cayenne, however.  It was a bit spicy for me, and the kids were asking for water after one bite.  I also added about 1/4 cup of parmesan, which made this even tastier.

We tried this recipe with some high expectations,as I love crab, however, I didn't care for this recipe.  I added parmasean cheese, and cut back to 1/4 tsp cayenne. They looked very pretty, but I found the taste to be very "crabby" (I used good bagged and refrigerated crab meat).

Made these for a Superbowl party.  I added extra garlic, garlic powder and salt & pepper.  Everyone thought they were good, but everyone also thought they were missing something. Maybe some fresh parsley and extra cayenne, as they were not spicy at all.

made these as written, were very good. will definitely make again.
The one thing that gets me about reading reviews is when people say oh I cut back on blah, blah blah... (in this case Cayenne) or other seasonings and then complain they're were bland... if you change the recipe to what you think you like, then don't give it a bad review because of how it turned out. the recipe itself is great and as others have noted, the filling options are endless.

The filling gets 5 stars but the puff pasty sheets need to be thinned down or they get too over powering.

These were great, made them for a bridal shower and they went fast - I didn't like the look of the wrapped result so I cut my pastry into squares but inserted them into appetizer sized muffin tins and filled them, leaving them open at top in tart fashion.  Maybe I'm challenged insofar as the wrapping goes but liked the look of the open tartlets better.  Will definitely make them again.

Too much cayenne, and cream cheese overpowers taste of crabmeat.

I just cook this food with my girlfriend last night. We both absolutely loved it. She likes spicy foods, so I added  afljalapeno. I'm brushed  it with margin on top to make it nice and crispy. Delicous!!! Thanks for the help making a great appetizer.
