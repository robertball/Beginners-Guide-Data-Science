Wonderful flavor.  When I made it, I had to add breadcrumbs to absorb extra moisture, otherwise made per recipe.
Instead of the cheese topping,  tomatoes,  and bun, I put the patty on a bed of chopped kale salad with avocado and topped it with a spicy hummus, in keeping with the Mediterranean flavors.

Ok, I didn't do the cheese sauce because I was craving Tzatziki 
sauce and feta cheese. I used Chef John's recipe for the tzatziki sauce. 

I'm not a big fan of restaurant lamb burgers because they always come out so dry, with an overpowering dried lamb flavor. 

I used about half of the onion/eggplant mix to season and moisten a twelve ounce package of lamb. My patties did fall apart a little, so next time I'll form the patties and refrigerate for an hour. 

These were so moist and delicious, that I will never again order a lamb burger in a restaurant.

This recipe requires a bit of step by step action but trust my taste buds... Well worth the effort! Melt in your mouth burst of flavors makes this one of the best burgers I have ever encountered. *next time i will just do them in sub buns so it won't be a big deal that they do fall apart when cooking.

I made this in lieu of moussaka since I had some eggplant from my garden that needed to be used up and wanted to try something new.  I served them for a large dinner party and everyone raved about these burgers!  They were absolutely divine!!  Thanks for the recipe.  I believe that this will take the place of my traditional moussaka recipe.

The only thing I changed was to omit the cinnamon, as I don't like it in Moussaka. The tomatoes with the vinegar and mint are what make it 5 stars, with just the burger and béchamel its 4 stars. BTW, this makes way more béchamel than necessary. I'll halve it in the future.

loved the recipe- thank you for the inspired variation on a much higher calorie dish.  

no grill,  so cooked in oven.  made my white sauce with butter instead of olive oil and fresh parmesan. 

the simple tomatoes in rice vinegar with mint were delightful!

Really Good! I was hungry for Lamb and I love Moussaka so this fit the bill perfectly. I made  to the T according to recipe and served with Chef John's Tzatziki from this site. Wonderful!

This is a delicious burger! I have made it several times. It is delicious using beef, too. I have not changed any of the meat seasonings. I like it just the way it is. Sometimes I will substitute Goat or Feta or Kefalotyri cheese for the Parmesan cheese in the Bechamel Sauce. I like to serve it in homemade Pita Bread. Thank you Chef John.

I'm making this tonight. I'm scared. lot of things going on. Hopefully I can edit this afterwards to let you guys know how it went.

Okay, it went well. Everyone enjoyed them. I'm going to scale them back a little next time tho. Too many flavors going on to appreciate.
