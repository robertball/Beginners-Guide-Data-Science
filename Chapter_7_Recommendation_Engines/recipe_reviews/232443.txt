This was very good Guac! My husband said it was the best he has ever had. 

Here are the adjustments I made to the recipe however: 

Only 1 10 oz basket of cherry tomatoes (this was plenty)
1/2 teaspoon of cayenne (I usually do a 3 spice level on a 1-5 scale and this was perfect)
add 2 Tbs fresh cilantro

Next time I'll do: 1/2 of a (SMALL) onion or 1/3 of a large
I may also only juice 1 1/2 lime as I like a thicker guac

Flavor was awesome!
