With these delectable little bites you’ll light the fuse of sweetness on first bite causing an explosion of spiciness in the end. These have been added to my recipe box TNT folder. Caroline, you were definitely thinking outside the bag with these. Since my store only sells 9.75 ounce bags of Flaming Hot Cheetos that’s what I used. Rather than trying to figure out the ratio of Cheetos to Vanilla Almond Bark Coating with the 9.75oz bag, I used the entire 20oz package of vanilla coating. This mixture spread perfectly in a 13x9 jelly roll pan, lined with parchment paper, to be cooled before cutting. As my Grandchildren would say, “They are the bomb”.

Made these for my kids for Valentine's Day. My daughter got hers last night and was incredulous at the mix - and LOVED them (= 2/14/12, brought these to work and everyone loves them! Btw, they start out very mild - the white chocolate mutes the heat . . . but they have a definite kick at the end! 2/20/12 One more edit (= I made these last night and I used 2 bags Ghiardelli white chocolate chips (10 oz? 12 oz?) with ~3T butter flavored Crisco, melted in the microwave, stirring after every 30 seconds, and an 11 oz bag of BAKED Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Worked great!

Sorry, thought these were terrible. My family would not eat them- I ended up throwing them out.

Awesome! I never would've thought to do this, but it just works! I broke up the Cheetos(R) so I could spoon them into candy papers to make clusters...worked perfectly! Believe it or not, the little guy already ate 3...they ARE addicting, lol! Thanks, Caroline for this different/fun/delicious candy recipe...will def be making it again and again! :)

What a wonderful snack! The almond bark gives the creamy, sweet and the Cheetos give the crunch and heat. What more can you ask for?! Husband was skeptical, but he did manage to eat almost half the batch before I could stop him and make him share. Thanks for a tasty recipe.

Be careful, these little treats are addicting!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Caroline.  
I kept the pieces intact and individual instead of cutting into squares. Just fished them out of the bowl and dropped them onto waxed paper to harden.

Such a unique idea! I never would have thought of this. These really are yummy! I saw these mentioned on The Buzz and knew I had to make them for my hubby, who loves Flamin Hot Cheetos. Thanks, Caroline! :)

This was very good! I had to use 'Andy Capp's Hot Fries' because the store didn't have the hot Cheetos. I coated them individually in the white chocolate and sprinkled them with cayenne pepper to make them as hot as the Cheetos. These are so addicting! I can't stop eating them! I will be trying it again when I find the hot Cheetos!

Love these! I used the 9.75oz Cheetos and 20oz. Almond bark. Once spread into the pan & cooled, I tried to cut them into squares - well, for my batch, I'd say "square" was a rather loose translation, LOL. No matter. They are without a doubt the most fun thing to make & share that I've yet to discover. Brought them to work and everyone is intrigued to try them (expecting something strawberry), then we all giggle as we continue shoving them into our mouths. Thanks for a fantastic surprise, Caroline!

I finally found Flamin' Hot Cheetos at Walmart.  Small bags about 3 oz each.  I made half a recipe using 8oz Wilton's white candy melts and 6 oz Cheetos. Wonder why they are pink?  The Cheetos color has lots of red in it and it colors the white candy when you mix them.  The firecrackers are more like bark than bars; if you want Bars then use more candy melts. .  Once set, I broke the Firecrackers up kind of like brittle.  I really like them and could probably eat them all.  DH tried one and was not happy; no problem with the color after all he lives in a pink house . . . Maybe he would have liked them if I told him what they were before he taste tested them.  Anyhow, thanks Caroline for sending me on a month long Cheetos quest and for sharing this unusual recipe. :)

My daughter loved these. I didn't try them because I'm not a fan of hot Cheetos. But DD gives them 5 stars! I did kind of mess up the recipe. My bag of Cheetos was 9.75 oz and the vanilla bark was 12 oz. So I couldn't get them to stick together enough to cut. Didn't affect the flavor, but I really need to start looking at sizes when I'm shopping!

Who says that Flamin' Hot Cheetos(R) don't pair well with white chocolate?! Certainly not me. Because man are these good. And what a pretty color of pink that the Cheetos(R) give the almond bark.  Addictively sweet and spicy, the sweetness hits 1st and then POW! You get nailed with an explosive ending. Will make again because my kiddos totally like them. These are simple, quick and down right a crazy combination that will be a "repeat offender" in my house! TY

I would have never thought of this, but after seeing the post of this recipe, I knew I had to try it.
I can not get over how good this is. I made some for a work  potluck, it was the star of the show. This is one of those recipes that you just have to share. Thank you so much for sharing.

So sorry - nothing personal, but no one who tried this liked it :(. I took on a trip with our neighbor friends, and it was not well-received at all. Too odd of a combination, or perhaps with bark/candy coating was overpoweringly sweet. I'm sure it's just personal preference and some have more adventurous tastebuds than others!

My bark came in a 16 oz pkg and my Cheetos in a 9 3/4 oz package so that's what I used (minus the ones I ate). This is SERIOUSLY addictive stuff. I can't wait to hear what DH's coworkers have to say! I can totally see using this almond bark on the Flamin Hot Munchies mix to make a sort of Chex mix kind of thing, too. I am so sad that anyone, anywhere, threw a batch of this out: I wish they'd thrown it at me! Thanks for sharing, Caroline!

I tried really hard to like this candy as I liked the idea of hot & spicy and the coolness of the white chocolate.  I took this candy to 3 different places and it wasn't well received at any of them.  Many, many  people tried it, but the reaction was pretty much the same - 'it's different, but one piece is enough'.  I really liked the ease of making it and how pretty it presents.  I'm not sorry I tried it and I thank you Caroline for sharing your unique recipe.  I'm glad so many other people enjoyed it!

Wow!!!  We call these crazy good.  Such an explosion of flavors.  First the subtle sweet taste of the white chocolate. Then bam, what hit me. The intense taste of the Flamin' Hot Cheetos.  They are addicting and we love them.  Thank you for sharing this recipe Caroline.
