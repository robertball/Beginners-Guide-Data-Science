Just tasted olives.  They are still bitter.  I'll wait another week and maybe a better rating.  Mary

This is a good recipe to get your olives cured for future uses. If you make these thinking they are the kind of olive to serve, as is, you may be disappointed. I followed these instructions exactly as written, putting some olives in glass jars and some in wide-mouth, clay pots with lids. Clay wins for texture, but the glass lets you see better if mold is forming. Give these a shake or a good stir every other day or so to aid in the curing process and to avoid mold. Once the two weeks have passed, these are ready to use in your favourite dish. They cook up in spaghetti sauce or even pop them in the oven for a bit, then eat once cooled. I drain the brine, add EVOO, parsley, garlic, hot peppers (fresh or dried, both work), and some pickled onions and let sit for about 24 hours before consuming. I've been making my own olives for almost 20 years but we boil them twice in fresh water instead of soaking overnight and to tell you the truth, both ways work. These make great gifts. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
