Added a little more hot pepper flakes to suit our taste, but we enjoyed this side dish.  Took the picture and then realized I'd forgotten to add the green onions...added them post-photo, and they were a good addition!

Yey!!! Been feasting on this ALL weekend. A few changes: add celery for extra crunch and cilantro. Served with a dab of crema once and with a dab of greek yogurth another time. BOTH work perfectly because They tame the acidity of the vinager. Thanks a mill√≥n !!!!

Definitely make again. I added some roasted pecan pieces and celery seed along with mustard seed. About a 1/4 teaspoon of the two  spices.  I cut back on the sugar less than a 1/4 cup. I taste it as I go. The apples definitely give it some sour goodness. Some pear might be good as well. 
It definitely will be better the next day as the vinegar breaks it down.  Serving this with some chicken on the grille.  I am trying to eat healthier as I age. So this has some great good health sense to it.  Enjoy!

This has become my favorite salad; always a crowd-pleaser at pot-lucks and such. I never happen to have green onions on hand when I make it; I've used regular onions, or skipped them altogether. Someday I will try it with green onions. I also usually use less sugar than called for, for personal taste reasons, also use less hot pepper flakes.

I like this a lot but I believe next time I will do as other reviewers suggested and decrease the sugar and oils.

i'm not a sweet salad dressing fan but i chose this recipe bc i wanted to use up two small granny smiths that were on their way out.. i cut the recipe in half.. used both apples which i shredded.. also added a shredded carrot.. subbed one packet of splenda for the sugar.. left out the veg oil.. doubled the mustard (spicy brown).. threw in a tbsp of nonfat plain yogurt, some sea salt and celery seed, a clove of garlic, and a little more red pepper flakes.. i didn't cook this on the stove top.. just threw it into my ninja to blend.. this is exactly what i had in mind.. ty for the recipe/inspiration

we enjoyed this fresh tasting accompaniment to roast chicken.  I skipped the vegetable oil and just used the olive oil and so everything was lightly coated with the dressing but not soggy or overdressed.  I used honey as the sweetener.  I will definitely make over and over.

This was just the right combination of sweet and tangy.  I did not have green onions but used a small amount of leek.  My husband, who generally does not like cabbage slaw loved It, even still the following day.  It was much better and healthier than the type made with mayo.  We ate it over several days, and it did not get soggy (I did not salt it as suggested in the Cook's Notes).

this is a great little side dish. the red pepper flakes give it a give kick and the apples the sweet kick to even it out. I will definitely be saving this dish. thank you for sharing!
