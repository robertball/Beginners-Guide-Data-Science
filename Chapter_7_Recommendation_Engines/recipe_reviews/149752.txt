This recipe has a lot of extra ingredients, some of which made the salad too bitter (ie. cabbage).  My husband is Lebanese and I have never had Fattoush with this many ingredients. It's also missing a few key ingredients from other recipes (ie. sumac, salt, etc.) Keep it simpler - much tastier in the "Authentic" version!  I would stick with the Authentic Lebanese Fattoush on this website.

Would be excellent if you omit the following: the cabbage, the red pepper, the carrots, the corn, the parsley.

This was excellent! I actually toasted the pita rounds and cut them into fours. we piled the fattoush on top and used the pitas as scoops. It was wonderful! Some Fattoush is more 'simple' in its ingredients, but I feel this one was very good and each ingredient complimented another in its own way. I recommend giving it a try!

Healthy, fresh, delicious! I did not use the mint leaves or corn. I served the salad in the outside of the cabbage (very bowl shaped!)

I started with a store-bought salad mix and added many of the remaining ingredients that I had on hand, like canned corn and dried garlic and parsley.
