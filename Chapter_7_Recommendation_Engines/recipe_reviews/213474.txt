My family loved this recipe. Only changes I made include the following: instead of a green bell pepper I used a yellow bell pepper, also my son put his in a flour tortilla wrap - then everyone else did the same. It was great either way. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was quite good, but we thought it could use a little more flavour. I made as written other than using my own taco seasoning (way less sodium that way). Next time I will add an onion with the peppers and add some taco seasoning to that as well. I would also let it simmer for more than 5 minutes to let the flavours blend more.

Very tasty!!  I did add some cooked rice at the end and a little corn.  Great with tortillas or by itself.

Excellent and super easy.  I just sauted everything together and it was done in just a few minutes.  Served in whole wheat tortillas.  thank you for sharing.

Simple to make.  Instead of using regular salsa, I used Mango salso; it turned out to be great.  Additionally, I cut down on the sodium content by using taco seasoning mix that was 40% less sodium.

I was looking for a recipe to use some bell peppers in and came across this. It was very easy and was a big hit with the family. It was a little dry so I added more salsa and let it simmer down. Also, didn't quite have enough chicken so I added some steamed corn. Served this with some steamed rice, refried beans and tortillas. I'm sure the family will have me make this one again.

I made exactly as listed; used my own taco seasoning mix and homemade salsa. This was a huge hit in my house, even my 2 year old loved it. Very little leftover. This is definitely going on weekly rotation.

This was a great recipe!  I ended up using it for Mexican Egg Roll stuffing... yummy!  I cut the salsa amount down a bit so it wouldn't be too runny.  I used some of the extra cooked chicken as part of my lunch the next day.  Very good!

What a great, fairly simple dish. I was out of rice, so I served it over linguini pasta and it was fantastic.

This was great - live in Ohio but from Oklahoma so miss my tex-mex!  I used red/yellow/orange sweet peppers instead of bells and I added a little sweet onion.  I also added yellow corn and a little extra salsa to cover the addition of the corn.  I am gluten free so served on rice - son loved on a tortilla with cheese and sour cream - will definitely make again!

This was wonderful! So easy to make! I used ground beef, and left out the beans as I didn't have any. We ate it with nachos to make it more fun for my kids. Will do this again, likely with chicken.

Easy and fast flavorful dinner. I added a chopped onion to the peppers, using all green ones. Then added a little frozen corn and sliced tomatoes. Simmered for about 10 min. Served with potato wedges and a green salad.

We didn't have any green peppers, but we did have some broccoli we needed to use, so we steamed that for a bit and threw it in. Not very Tex-Mex, but it was just fine. 

Our college boys are coming home this weekend - so we're thinking about a double batch and trying it again. My wife and I both really liked it.

Simple and delicious! I used a chicken taco seasoning packet, and a jarred habanero salsa.  It is great in a tortilla, but I liked it better over rice with a squeeze of fresh lime juice.

We loved this but I did make some changes. I added onion, garlic and chili powder to the pepper mixture and used at least a cup of salsa. We ate it with chips, sour cream and avocado. Pickled jalape√±os were also good on it.

This was a great quick to make dish! I added some corn to make it a bit more Mexican. I couldn't  figure out what it was lacking, but my boyfriend said it needed a but of crunch. Next up

Very easy to make, ingredients that I generally have on hand.  The salsa I used had cilantro which gave it a little flavor boost.  MY husband ate his in taco shells and I had mine rolled up in a tortilla.  Makes quite a bit, a might even say 6 servings as written, not 4!

This was very easy to make.  I used left over chicken and served it over brown rice with guacamole.  Very good.  Will make this again.

Followed this recipe to the letter. It was extremely simple and quick to make. We both enjoyed it, but my partner thought that it could have used more flavor--it smells more exciting than it tastes.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I added onions. I also added about 1/4 cup water when simmering at the end to make it more saucy.
