Very good, although I omitted the olives and served cold. The dressing was very light and delicious- however it seemed to need more or a binding agent to the pasta. Next time I will add more parmesian cheese, which would hopefully do the trick. Definately going to use this recipe again!

I would give this more stars if I could. UNBELIEVABLY good. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except added another can of black olives, which was perfect and I did use a little more salt and parmesan cheese that recipe called for.   sooo delicious!!!

Really good. I served this cold since I made it a day ahead, but it was still very tasty. I love the fresh basil dressing!

The combination of ingredients was fantastic.  However, there wasnt enough dressing to really coat the pasta and provide flavor.  I would double the dressing part and add more basil next time.

I changed the recipie serving to 30 people using the converter -- it was fabulous!  A little less oil and little more vinegar made this dish - delish!!!   Big party pleaser.  Will definately make again - quick and easy.

I used tri-color gluten free noodles and it was amazing!!!!  I used mozzarella the first time and feta the second time.  Both were really good.

I like this recipe--light and colorful.  
Just made it for the first time, only changes being that I read reviewers here, and doubled (tripled?) parmesan.  Also, I added some bacon chunks.

For the purple color, why not add 1/2 red onion?  Sliced cherry tomatoes in lieu of the diced medium tomato would add a fun texture.  Also, I think diced ham, or salami would have been great here, in lieu of the bacon that I added.

Nice open recipe, seems like there's a lot you can do to add your favorite ingredients in, too.

enjoy!

I loved this recipe and so did my guests.  Everyone had seconds.  I think FRESH basil is a key ingredient.   I forgot to buy white wine vinegar so I substituted apple cider vinegar.  It was delicious.  Next time I'll try the white wine vinegar as a comparison.

Just made this - delicious. Made a few alterations though: Feta cheese instead of mozzarella for a bigger taste Added some chicken, sauteed in olive oil, with some dried oregano sprinkled on Added some red pepper flakes Didn't even end up using the olives b/c was so good without, but am sure the olives add a nice touch, and imagine capers would as well. Actually, this would be great with salmon and capers instead of chicken and olives...may try that next.

This pasta salad is incredibly good, largely thanks to the dressing.  I did make a few of changes to make it vegan, which included using Parmela for the parmesan, and kidney beans (for protein) rather than the cheese.  I also added cooked portabella mushrooms and replaced about a fourth of the oil with water.  I will most definitely make this again.  It's heavenly!

Great recipe! The dressing was delicious. I tossed in some shredded peperoni and cucumber and this went beautifully with my crispy baked chicken.

My favorite kind of recipe--delicious and easy! I used dried sweet basil instead of fresh, apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vin, and laid on the parmesan pretty thick. Will be making again!

I made the recipe as described, except I added some chicken. It came out pretty good, but seems to be a bit lacking in flavor. If I make it again (and I'm not sure that I will), I may add salami or pepperoni next time.

I made the recipe according to the directions with a minor adjustment of less olives, about half, and less mozzarella (4 oz.).  It was still excellent and my nephew who normally says he doesn't like pasta salad actually had seconds.

I loved this. But I made lots of changes. I omitted: the olive oil, vinegar, basil, Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese. Then I substituted the olive oil for Italian salad dressing and added about a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar (to remove the sourness), and also added a grated carrot and some chopped celery.

I changed mozzerella cheese to asiago to add more flavour, and added some red wine vinegar as well. Used dried basil as I did not have fresh. Used cherry tomatoes instead of chopping up a larger one, makes the salad less juicy. I left out the olives, as my husband is not fond of them. Added some green onions too.

I have to give this 4 stars because I was unable to follow recipe exactly as written.  I used Kalamata olives and feta instead of mozzarella.  The dressing is great!  My Husband and I really enjoyed it, but my 6 year old... not so much.  I don't know how the mozzarella would taste, but since we liked it with the feta I will make this again, my way.

We enjoyed this salad, and the fresh basil and Parmesan dressing was terrific. I noticed my box of pasta has now shrunk to 12 ounces, but really this was just the right amount of dressing for that amount of pasta. I didn't have mozzarella cheese, but this was great without it.

Excellent recipe and the fresh basil dressing really differentiates it from regular pasta salad with Italian dressing. Some reviewers have said not to skimp on the dressing but we had the opposite issue - pools of dressing in the bottom of the bowl. My body did not react well *cough* to that amount of oil, so we'll probably cut it in half next time. Otherwise, really great salad.

I used a bottled Greek Olive dressing (Aldi) and added a little oil, cider vinegar and sugar. This turned out great! So easy. I used a 12-oz bag of bow-tie pasta, and it served a lot more than 8 people.  Throw in some pepperoni or salami and it would be a main-dish salad.

This was delicious! I used the juice of 2 lemons instead of using white wine vinegar (not a fan of white wine vinegar).  I also used mini bow tie pasta since that was all I had. This was light and refreshing. Definitely going to make this again soon!

Definitely a 5 star recipe! As usual, it takes way more time than the recipe states when slicing and chopping. But, I followed the recipe as written except that I threw in a handful of Parmesan cheese, 'cause that's the way we like it!! Fresh Basil is the ticket...wouldn't even try it with dried Basil. I was also tempted to add some minced garlic...I'll try that next time. The husband thought it was awesome...and we have plenty of leftovers for tonight's dinner too, so we'll see how the cold/leftover turns out. Perfect recipe for hot summer days...and plenty for a potluck dish!

This is delicious! It didn't seem to have enough dressing though so I will probably double the dressing next time.
