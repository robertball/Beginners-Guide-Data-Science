i'm from flanders, and i've got to say: this tastes pretty authentic.

i still made a couple of changes though:
- i add the carrots at the same time as the onions
- i've added 2 cloves

for the beer i use "westmalle dubbel", a red-brown trappist beer, 7% alcohol.

i also don't add as much sugar, the beer is quite sweet and makes it redundant

I was skeptical about the bread with mustard, but I followed the recipe anyway. This turned out well. The brown sugar gave it a nice sweet taste. I will consider adding potatoes to it next time.

I e-mailed this recipe to my son who lives in Belgium, and he fixed it for us when we visited him there recently.
It was delicious.  I didn't think I would like that much onion it the stew, but it was flavorful.

I had high hopes for this stew.  I visited Belgium once and had the best stew I've ever had and hoped this recipe would come close.  Not one person in my large family liked it.  The one good thing was that the stew beef cooked up VERY tender, which is why we gave it a 2 instead of a 1.

I took this to a party and it received rave reviews! I was a little worried about how much onion was in the recipe, but it added wonderful flavor! I didn't have any bread, so I chopped up a potato and added that. Will definitely make again!

We really liked this recipe.  I added a potato and a rutabaga since we had lots of extra root vegetables. I didn't have the white wine vinegar so used red wine vinegar.  I'm sure we will make this again!

Hands down the best beef stew I've ever had!  I made this for company and had no leftovers. I added two small potatoes I had on hand, but it would have been fine without.

Aside from making this in my instant pot I followed the directions exactly. This was insanely delicious! For the beer I used Abita Turbo dog. To make this in the instant pot I simply coated the meat with the flour, salt and pepper. I then put the butter in the pot and pressed sauté and sautéed the meat for about five minutes then added the onion and sautéed it. I added the remaining ingredients EXCEPT the carrots and brown sugar and pressure cooked this on high for 30 minutes. I did a quick release and placed the carrots in the pot and pressure cooked for five more minutes on high. I allowed it to natural release for 20 minutes. I then tasted it and added some brown sugar to an individual dish. This was amazing!!!!

We loved this!  I followed the recipe to the end, but I did  add some small new potatoes.  I have been making beef stew for over 40 years, but  my husband and I agreed this was the best!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I've made this numerous times and love it. A wonderful balance flavors with the extra tender meat, silky onions and tangy and sweet (depending on your taste) base. I always add more brown sugar, extra mustard and use apple cider vinegar. Fantastic with added potatoes (and veg) or served over them or noodles. My tip: I found it easier to brown the meat first and then only add the flour after caramelizing the onions to create a roué.

Two spoons of brown sugar took it past a little-sweet.  I think it would have been fine without.  It was not unbearably sweet.  I followed the recipe with the exception at the end.  I added chopped celery, quartered potatoes, can of stew tomatoes, frozen corn, and pearl onions halved.  I did not use the amount of onion this recipe called for knowing I would add the pearl onions.  Came out wonderful.

I am from Belgium, and this is not the way we make it. We don't use carrots or flour, neither do we add water. To make the sauce thicken, we only use whole wheat bread with mustard on it, and the only liquid we use is beer. The only veggies in there should be onions (and thyme and bay leaves). However, I'm sure this non-traditional version would taste well too, but try to make the real Belgian stew some time to taste the difference! Our famous chef Jeroen Meus has a receipe online. Not sure if you can find it in English but Google Translate would work.

I have made it for years. My wife called it Carbonnade de Flamand. I use  regular beer rather than a dark one. I also add a dash of nutmeg.

We loved this and added it to our recipe box! I followed everything except didn't have fresh Thyme, tasted fine with dried Thyme. Wanted something without potatoes and this fit the bill!
