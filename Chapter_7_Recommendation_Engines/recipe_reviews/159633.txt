We didn't really like this recipe as is.I really liked the idea of poppy seeds with broccoli, which was why I picked it.  However, I couldn't really taste the poppy seeds and bf wnated to know if I had used thousand island in the sauce somehow.  I hadn't, but once he'd said that it did make sense.  The sauce also made the broccoli cold, which I didn't like. I really like the idea, but I don't like the sour cream added to it, so I might try it again without the sour cream, butter and onions to see if it would work more like a dressing.   Thanks, though, for the recipe and the idea.

I printed this recipe two and a half years ago before any reviews were written, and I wish I had checked the reviews as I usually do before making something for the first time.  The ingredient list sounds good, but the end result was not what I was expecting.  This makes a cold, thick sour cream mixture that goes over steamed broccoli.  I was expecting a warm, SAUCE (not thick sour cream).  I would not recommend this recipe.

It was okay, not the best.  There was too much sour cream and paprika.  If I try this again, I won't use so much.

Like many others this sounded great and didn't turn out that way.  I used less sour cream and cut the thickness with 1/4 cup fat free italian dressing which helped.
