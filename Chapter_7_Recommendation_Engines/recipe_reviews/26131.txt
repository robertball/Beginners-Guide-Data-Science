I have made these cookies a few times.  The first time I made them with the fresh cranberries and it was a lot of work and the cookie did not have the sweetness I was hoping for.  The second time I made these cookies I substituted orange flavored Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries) for the fresh cranberries.  After I did that I got rave reviews on the cookies.  They are now my mother-in-lawâ€™s favorite cookie. After the cranberry change I would give this cookie recipe 5 stars.

Excellent cookies, full of flavor and original! I changed a few things though: I wanted a stronger orange taste, so I doubled the orange juice (and adjusted the amount of flour accordingly) and quadrupled the orange zest. I used fresh cranberries that I half-mashed, but used a bit less than a cup. I also added extra nutmeg and some clove. I baked the cookies a bit longer (about 10-12 minutes) and they came out chewy but not limp. Thank you for this recipe!

I will not make these cookies again.  I use fresh cranberries and they did not taste good and the glaze was not good.  I did follow the recipe to the tee.

These cookies are a wonderful addition at Christmas.  I was working on my Christmas gift baking and had extra cranberries, found this recipe.  I was a little worried after reading the reviews but loved all the ingredients. Only a few very minor changes I made...I added a 1/2 teaspoon cloves and 1 cup of nuts.  I used the food processor to cut up the fresh cranberries.   Then I chilled the dough about a half hour before baking.  I think this cookie also turns out much better when you make the cookies small.  You could place the batter in a greased jelly roll pan and bake 20-25 minutes and they would come out very good.  It is a nice healthy great tasting contrast to the many rich candies and baked goods we get this time of year.

Cookies were soft and yummy! Variations i made : added a half a cup of wheat bran, used dried sweetened cranberries, an extra 1/4 cup of oatmeal, a dash of salt and 3/4 of a teaspoon baking powder. Cookies weren't very sweet, could probably use a little more sugar, but were very delicious. Made an orange frosting with 2 tbsp. orange juice, 1 cup of powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp. give or take of orange zest. This frosting gave them the sweetness I was looking for. Thanks for the awesome recipe. And i did cook them about a minute longer

I changed nothing & followed the recipe exactly.  Flat & flavorless.  It's horrible to waste food with the costs rising the way they are, but we wont eat this.  Luckily we have many free-ranging chickens who got to have the entire batch!  I would give this 0 stars if I could.

The recipe above did not turn out well. The cookies came out flat and not much flavor. So I made a few adjustments. I added an extra 1 1/4 cup of flour, extra 1 cup of oats and 1/4 teaspoon salt along with 1 cup chopped walnuts. Additionally, do not chop the cranberries; just add them whole. My family liked them much better.

These cookies were delicious!!!  I added a bit more cranberries and they came out amazing.  I made the full batch (baked them for 11 minutes...probably should have done 15 minutes) but they still tasted delicious.  My husband and I aren't too big on super sweet cookies so these were perfet, i took them to my husbands Fire Station while he was on shift at around 8pm, at 6am there were only 3 left, they just couldn't stop eating them!!!

I made these to use up extra fresh cranberries after Thanksgiving. They were just okay. The orange flavor didn't really come through, though I used the zest from a whole orange. I would not make these cookies again.

This recipe definately hits the spot! I absolutely love the taste of these little nuggets. They're great treats for parties and everyone I have made them for just loves them. The cranberry and the orange taste great together.

I didn't care for the way these cookies came out. They were limp, and flat. Too moist to stay in a cookie jar or gift tin. Taste was fair. Sorry

I was looking for something to make with leftover fresh cranberries, and these were fantastic.  The orange zest adds so much zing.  My modifications -- eliminated the white sugar because the applesauce and orange juice add natural sugar.  (My applesauce was no added sugar too.)  I also added about a cup of dark chocolate chips, just because dark chocolate and orange or cranberry -- can't go wrong.  I will make again.

I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup so they wouldn't be overly sweet. Also added a teaspoon of salt. They turned out delicious, thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are really good!  I might add a little more orange zest next time to bump up the citrus taste a bit.  I did use dried "craisins" because I had them. They worked well. but that would be the only change I would make.  Great alternative to the traditional oat meal raisin cookie!  My two toddlers like them too!
