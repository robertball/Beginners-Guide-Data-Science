I love most things pumpkin, so I was intrigued by this recipe.  The first time I made it with pure pumpkin - don't make that mistake, it was horrible.  The recipe should have emphasized to buy the pumpkin pie mix.  I add 2T of fat free half and half and sprinkle cinnamon on top of the whipped cream, and it is quite nice!  You could add cinnamon sticks if you are entertaining.

Great Pumpkin-tini. I used heavy whipping cream and maple extract because that's what I had. Other than that I followed the recipe.  I like being able to drink my 'pumpkin pie'!
