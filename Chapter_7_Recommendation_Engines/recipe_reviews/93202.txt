I used plain canned pumpkin  I had leftover from turkey day.  I didn't have heavy cream so I just added sour cream at the end.  Also since I like thing a little spicy I just added a dash of red pepper flakes.   It was quite good.  I would make it again

This may be an excellent recipe.  It looks very good.  But I will never make it because I do not know what a medium onion looks like or what a medium sugar pumpkin looks like.  Recipes may refer to medium, but should then state a quantity of the item.  One person's medium may be another's small or large - who knows?

On its own, a bit bland, but one heck of a base for a hearty winter soup: I added butter, curry powder, sesame and wasabi oil to the saute; put the herbs in at the bottom of the slow cooker, with cinnampon sticks at the sides and bay leaves layered in; kicked up the bay a bit, and set it for 12 hours on low. When done, used a bit of the broth to saute some nice langoustines (any subtle-flavored fish would have done), added langs to bottom of serving bowl, poured soup over, drizzled with heavy cream. A smash hit at our house.

I had to use dried herbs, I live up north so fresh herbs are hard to get.  I served this to people at work, they loved it!

I like it because it's simple.  I made pumpkin soup every year at Halloween and the kids loved it before going Trick/Treat.  If you follow any recipe for carrot or squash soup it's very similar.  I like to add celery and POTATOES to make it thicker.  More spices like pumpkin pie mix and curry, chili powder and whatever herbs I like.  sometimes I leave the soup chunky with big pieces of pumpkin.  I use lots of onions and butter.

I found the soup a little bland, maybe if I spice it up with some ginger and cayenne pepper... or add some brown sugar and nutmeg... it is a good base, but it needs something else. In any case, thank you for sharing.

The Recipe started a little bland, but after I added a little V8 Juice it balanced well with some pasta. Was well liked by non soup eaters, will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe for this soup and thought it was delicious.  Wonderful on a cold, fall day!  Really nice flavour with the fresh herbs!  I would definitely make this recipe again.

This soup was pretty good except, I found that the cinnamon ruined the entire flavor of the pumpkin and other spices. Im leaving the cinnamon out. It'll be awesome instead of pretty good next time.

Smelled absolutely delicious! But, it did not taste like it smelled. I was disappointed in it.

Did not like this recipe very much.  I may have added too much of the herbs/spices, I didn't measure too carefully.  But nevertheless, I found this soup too sweet and ended up discarding most of it.  Not my cup of tea I guess.

Great! I made it on the stove top, added garbanzo beans, and spicy Indian paprika for that extra kick.

I thought is was a delicious soup. We used the inside of our Halloween pumpkin to make it. Easy!

Since it's March and I wasn't able to get a pumpkin this time of year, I used canned pumpkin.  I don't recommend it.  Kinda bland.  Looking forward to trying again in the fall.

I am not a gourmet, so I don't know what a "medium-size sugar pumpkin" is, but I did have  Cinderella pumpkin (as labeled at the pumpkin patch).  I used it instead and it worked just fine.  I did tweak this recipe a bit by eliminating the sage (I just don't care for the taste) and added nutmeg and curry (about a teaspoon of each, but more or less to your taste) instead.  The soup didn't have a strong flavor, so I think next time, I am going to reduce the amount of chicken stock to bring out stronger pumpkin flavor and increase the onion just a bit.  In all, once I finished "seasoning to taste", it was a nice creamy soup.  Slow cooker process made it really easy.

This is a good soup base but I wasn't impressed with the seasoning.

It was perfect for a starter for our Thanksgiving dinner after a few changes. I used vegetable broth instead and added a teaspoon of mild curry powder to give it more kick. I will definitely repeat this one.

Definitely want to give this a try! I am lactose intolerant, and was curious if anyone has tried it with coconut milk instead of the heavy cream
