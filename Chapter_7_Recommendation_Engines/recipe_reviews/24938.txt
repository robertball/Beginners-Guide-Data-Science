My second batch turned out perfectly!  Had a few problems with the first one...I didn't get much juice from the thawed raspberries and I was afraid to add too much water so it ended up more like a raspberry spread.  I'm going to use it for something though.  The actual sauce was amazing!  Make sure to boil it for at least a minute to make sure the cornstarch dissolves.  YUMMY on cheesecake!

Quick & easy & delicious.  A good basic recipe to keep around.
Don't boil the sauce too long or it will get really thick, which 
subsequently makes the straining process very sloooowwww....

This sauce was easy and delicious!  I used Chambord for the raspberry flavored liquer and didn't strain it and it still came out great.  I poured it over Chantal's New York Cheesecake and I impressed the in-laws with this and everyone at work loved it!

I made this to go with a New York Cheesecake and it was very good, but the consistency becomes thick and a little gelatinous after cooling in the fridge.

Made this recipe to serve over brownies,  very yummy!!  I cut the brownies, and on each plate drizzled the raspberry sauce over then topped off with a dollop of whip cream (VERY YUMMY).  This dessert was easy (boxed Brownie mix) but the sauce made it special!!! Everyone loved it.   You Rock Betty!!

This sauce is amazing! I used Chambord Liqueur Royale and the flavor it gave the raspberries was absolutely wonderful!

I highly recommend this recipe!!!!

Absolutely delicious! I had some frozen raspberries from a wonderful farmer's market, and I was looking for the perfect sauce recipe to use them in. This is it - the sauce was amazing on a dark chocolate cake. Next time I make a chocolate dessert, I'm using this sauce again!
