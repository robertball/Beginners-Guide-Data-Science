Yummm!  I have made this several times, but instead of canned filling I use a Sauteed Apple recipe from this site.  That adds some work, but is so worth it.  Top with some whipped cream- perfect combo of sweet and savory.  Definately not a recipe to make all the time, but worth it for a special occasion.

Ok, I try to only review recipes that I have followed exactly but I wanted to let you know that I used whole grain pancake mix and it was horrible!!!  That said I could tell that using regular pancake mix we would have loved this!  I just wanted to warn you!  LOL

If I could give these 10 stars I definately would. I chopped up sausage links and added them to the batter. They came out great. I won't bother with the apple topping next time, although it is good, because these waffles are great on their own. My kids loved them too. I have to make these again soon because we ran out of them and still wanted more. Perfect with butter, real maple syrup and a dollop of whipped cream! Yummy!

I give this 5 stars, because I liked it alot.  But neither of my kids liked it.  I made it exactly as stated, but left of the apple topping.  It was great with syrup.  My waffle iron, must of been on hi heat because it cooked very quickly and almost burned.  The batter was very thick.

Another Christmas breakfast success!  I could not find maple flavored bulk sausage at my grocery and didn't want to use brown and serve, so I added two TBSP real maple syrup to the batter--worked just fine.  Also I think a little less than half cup would work fine--maybe it was my waffle iron but it kept overflowing the iron.  Finally, I made Emeril Lagasse's Apple Compote (canned filling...yuck).  It was a smashing success!

Sausage in waffles, what a great idea!  Very Delicious!  My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it.  I chose not to use the apple topping only because I'm not fond of apples on food. Thank you :)

Great recipe for a low-sugar breakfast meal.  I topped the waffles with fresh apples and whipped cream (from the can, which is also low sugar) and sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Yum!  I also tried it with thawed frozen strawberries for something different.
