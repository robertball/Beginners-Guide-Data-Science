Delicious recipe!!! The herbs make the tomatoes very tasty and the juice realized by them is divine. So easy to make and the best thing I got to use the herbs from my garden. Lining  the pan with Reynolds foil made my night, no cleaning!!! I'm making this recipe again, definitely!!!

Great and easy way to use summer tomatoes and herbs.  It couldn't be easier to clean up when lining your baking pan with Reynold Wrap foil.  It is wonderful on a homemade pizza or thrown into pasta!  The roasted sage leaves add great flavor.
I highly recommend trying it!

Super simple & delicious summer side.  Loved the herb mix.  I just saut√©ed on the stove.  I used a mix of colors & served poured over grilled sliced flank steak.  Such a pretty presentation.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I used dried herbs and otherwise followed the recipe - such a delicious recipe! You can use these tomatoes in so many ways. Next time I want to toss them with some cooked angel hair and a sprinkling of Parmesan, or spread them on some crostini's with some fresh mozzarella... OH MY!!

I don't think that this side dish could be any easier OR faster to make!   First of all, who Doesn't  LOVE fresh, roasted tomatoes?  Their sweetness ALONE is enough to please ANYONE, picky or not!  Add to that fresh herbs and a little EVOO and you've got yourself a little bit of HEAVEN!
THEN, to make this dish EVEN better...AS IF THAT'S possible, Roast them on a sheet of Reynold's Wrap  Foil!  That  makes clean up so easy!
THIS is a WIN/WIN!
