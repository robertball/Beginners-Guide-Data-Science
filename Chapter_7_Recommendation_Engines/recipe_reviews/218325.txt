This is one of our favorite recipes now.   I have made it as is and it turned out great. I have also modified it other times to reduce the sodium in it and this also has turned out very good. I have used chili powder and red pepper instead of the taco seasoning. I also have eliminated the  chicken bouillon granules.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Very, very good! I used a fresh winter squash in place of canned pumpkin and about 5 chipotles because it didn't taste very hot when blended, but after it was cooked it was HOT! I also used 3 Swanson Flavor boost chicken broth packets in place of bouillon because I am sensitive to MSG. I will definitely make this again.

This was so good. I added some fresh spinach to the filling and left out the boullion. The only change I'd make next time would be the beans.  The filling was very soft and I'd prefer a bit of texture, so I'll use a can of whole black beans and smash up half of them, leaving some of them whole

I really tweaked this recipe because it was the night before grocery shopping and I made do with what I had. That being said, this was the perfect recipe to sub in what I did have and I'd love to actually try the real thing lol. I used cubed up chicken instead of turkey. I only had a small can of pumpkin and like 5 tortillas. Black beans instead of refried. I decided to make this into a casserole instead. I shredded the tortillas on the bottom, added the meat mixture, then a layer of the tomato mixture, then a layer of cheese. I did it all again, except I used the last of a bag of black bean tortilla chips in place of tortillas.
It came out sooooo delicious.
I learned recently from a cookbook to take my can of chipotle peppers and blend it all up really well. Then save it in a container in the fridge. You can take it out a Tbs or tsp at a time. I used a Tbs and it was nice and smoky with a little heat. Use more for more heat.
Can't wait to try this as enchiladas

These were delicious! Wouldn't change a thing although I used chicken in place of turkey as I find turkey very dry.
Served with Corny Mexican Salad also from this site.

The sauce was good.  At least twice as much pumpkin as need.  Most of the cheese should have been wrapped up in the enchilada and not on top as it browned too much.  I'll make the sauce again but not the filling.

I made this recipe pretty much as described except that I subbed soy crumbles for the turkey and used black bean in place of refried (read another review regarding the texture). I added a LOT more chipotle, as like things extra spicy. It turned out absolutely delicious. My boyfriend said he liked this even more than my regular enchilada recipe, so this one will definitely be in the new rotation!!! Definite must try for pumpkin lovers. Very healthy as well.

I used what I had on hand. I used less pumpkin, and corn tortillas.  Also used adobo and enchilada sauce on top.  Side salad and sour cream.  Everyone loved it.  Good change after Thanks Giving.

I only had a 15 ounce can of pumpkin and regular flour tortillas. Other than that, I followed the recipe. These were fantastic!  DH said to put these on the rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a really delicious, easy recipe. I had some leftover pumpkin in my freezer from Fall and a frozen turkey too so I cleaned out the freezer and made these. I used corn tortillas and green onions instead of yellow onions (my daughter has a food sensitivities) and everybody raved about these. We ate them for two days and they were fantastic both times. We did top them with avocado and sour cream. So good. THANKS for sharing this!

It was pretty good, but I won't be making it again. I was a bit skeptical of pumpkin in this recipe, but it was actually quite nice! I wanted to make this before Thanksgiving, so I used a rotisserie chicken instead of a turkey. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this could use some texture. Some frozen corn, chopped peppers, etc. would have been good for this recipe.

Smooth and creamy with the pumpkin. I used refried blake beans.  Really easy to make ahead of time.  Loved it!  Next time I will top it with black olives.

We loved it; in fact so much so I made it for mid day meal and finished the leftovers in the evening.  The only change was that I didn't have the pepper in adobo sauce.  To substitute, I used a can of Ro-Tel and used a little less tomato sauce.  The filling was superb; wouldn't change a thing there.

This Was Amazing, It's Like Fall In An Enchilada!!
i Did Add A Little Ginger, nutmeg, and i barely sprinkled some cinnamon in the pumpkin mix. the turkey was left over from thanksgiving but it was an oven ready turkey breast that was already flavored. it just turned out AWESOME. I didn't make the sauce they wanted me to, i just used a can of enchilada sauce. i added cheese to the inside of each of them and on top i added a little sharp white cheddar. this recipe is totally going in my cook book to make again :)

I really want to like this idea, but after making it several times with different variations I give up.  We found it enjoyable but not really special.
