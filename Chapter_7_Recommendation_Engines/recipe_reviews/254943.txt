Delicious way to use cantaloupe.  I was a bit short of the amount needed so I added 2 peaches. I didn't find the cayenne too spicy at all.  I couldn't find my ice cream maker, so I froze the mixture in a pan, then put it through the blender & froze it again in lidded container.  Really nice smooth, creamy texture & beautiful colour. Thanks for the recipe, Chef John!  I'll be making this again.

Don't miss this one, it's a winner. Cantaloupe is kind of 'meaty', for a fruit, maybe that's why it goes so well with cayenne. I used a bit more than 1/2 of the cayenne it called for, and it's still got a kick, so beware... unless you are a spice monster, maybe start with than 1/4 tsp. Oh, and I made with allulose and splenda for those who are low-carbing, it works fine.

The addition of cayenne peaked my interest and I had to try this sorbet.  I followed the recipe exactly (even got out my scale to weigh the cantaloupe).  It was a good consistency but hubby and I both thought it was way too spicy, and we like spicy foods. I will make it again but use only a pinch of cayenne, maybe 1/8 tsp max. I think the addition of the vodka is very important to keep the sorbet soft and not too icy.  Overall another great recipe from Chef John just a little too much heat.
