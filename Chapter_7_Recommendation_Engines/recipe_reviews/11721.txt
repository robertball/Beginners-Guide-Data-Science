I have made this recipe quite a few times since discovering it in November.  I am giving it 5 stars because my husband loves it and requests it at least once a month (and I have to double the quantity).  Only modifications I made were as follows: Use half miracle whip and half mayo, use ceasar dressing instead (tried it with italian, ceasar has more"zing"), and finally I doubled the tuna. You can add more pasta, just depends on your taste!

I had high hopes for this salad because of the marinating process. But in the end it wasn't too much different than any other macaroni salad. The second time I made it I used 1/2c non-fat plain yogurt and 1/2c reduced fat mayo and added 3T of a bottled Caesar dressing I had (in place of marinating in Italian oil dressing) I also added an extra can of tuna. With the modifications, this was pretty yummy. Thanks Maridele.

Good as is, also good with a few alterations for a healthier version- used one box wheat pasta, added low fat ceaser dressing, miracle whip and sour lean.  No need to marinate overnight.  I also use two 6 ounce cans of tuna and stir in frozen peas!  I know this is practically a different recipe, but if you're like me and want to 'health up' recipes sometimes, this works beautifully! This is also really creamy :)  YUM.

This was EXCELLENT!  The pasta just BURST with flavor due to marinating it over night.  I didn't have celery, but added tomatoes instead.  I'll bet it'd be good with black olives too!

My husband and son loved this. I did this on the fly, without marinating and it came out great. He's a big fan of macoroni salad and he loved the lighter dressing! I added 2 cans tuna, green olives, sweet Vidalia onions (from Georgia) and Miracle Whip type salad dressing, because I didn't have any Mayo. You can play with the recipe and it still comes out great!

This is alright as written, but I preferred the additions that other reviewers made. I tried to feel less guilty about eating pasta by using whole wheat pasta. I used 3/4 cup of low-fat sour cream and 3/4 cup mayo. I don't like Italian dressing much, so I used ranch instead. Another reviewer suggested adding 1tsp dill. DO IT! It really gives the pasta a great flavor! I've tried this with tuna or with crab, and they were great.

I made this recipe with the following changes:  I used 1/2 cup Miracle Whip, 1/2 Canola Mayo in place of the mayonnaise and I did not marinade overnight as I never plan ahead.  I added all the ingredients from the sour cream down in a large bowl, mixed well and then added the macaroni.  Over the top of the macaroni I added the Italian dressing and mixed it all together.  My picky teenage daughters loved it (and they hate tuna) and my husband like the zing the Italian dressing gave it. I thought it was great as well!

I made this for my family reunion and everyone loved it!  It had a wonderful flavor from the italian dressing that was a huge hit!!!  I didn't have any leftovers and several people went home with the recipe!  I'll make this again and again!!

Although it's not summer, I had to try this. It sounded so good for lunch!! It was as good as it sounded. I used low fat rasberry vinegarette  as the marinade,low fat mayo, and sour cream. I also didnt have celery so added green peppers and eggs instead. YUM! The only modification I might make next time is 3/4 c. mayo and an extra can of tuna.

Very tasty- and easy, too.  I used one and a half boxes of macaroni and kept all of the other measurements the same, except for about 1/2 cup of italian dressing and 2 cans of tuna. I marinated the pasta for a few hours and then put it all together the night before I was to serve it. Then right before serving, I added a few tbsp. of mayo to moisten it up. It was a hit!

I didn't have any Italian dressing, so used about 1/2 ranch dressing instead. I also had some extra green pepper, so chopped up about 1/3 cup of that, and also threw in a teaspoon of dried drill. Really good & easy to make, plus all the ingredients are things I usually have on hand. It's even better the 2nd day.

Delicious!  I made it with fat-free Italian salad dressing, light, (low-fat) Miracle Whip, and low-fat sour cream.  It is still scrumptious!!

I didn't marinate this w/ the dressing. Instead I wisked all the wet ingredients together and poured it on the pasta, stirred and refridgerated for 3 hours.  I did add shredded carrot to it.  Good.  THX

I made this in the morning to eat for dinner, so marinating time was not overnight, but it was still delicious.  I used a red onion and a 12 oz. can of tuna instead of 6 oz.  Hubby likes tuna, alot.  We enjoyed this.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! Great base for alterations as well. 
Used Miracle whip Light =  mayo
Fat Free Sour Cream
Creamy Balsamic Dressing = Italian Style
w/o celery
added handfuls of Shredded cheese
Double reciepe
Wish I had some frozen peas...

Going to use for lunches this week.  

Easy to make, if you are willing to marinate (though other reviews indicate it is not necessary)

Strong, vibrant flavor  (I may of been heavy handed with my spices...)

I really like this recipe, but in order to make it healthier I like to substitute fat free plain yogurt for the mayo. It works well because this salad already has a bite to it from the dressing. Also, I have done this with both Italian and Caesar dressings with great results!

This is a super recipe, I only made 2 modifications.  I mix this up with low-fat mayo and 0% chobanni plain yogurt, I add in 1.5 cups of frozen peas.  I also throw in 2 cans of tuna like another reviewer suggested.  I didn't have italian dressing, so I made some from this recipe:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/italian-dressing-mix/detail.aspx

Overall the salad is awesome.  Its the best tuna macaroni salad I've ever had.  Everyone that eats it comments on how great it is.

Very good salad. The marinading process really helps it to stay creamy instead of it soaking up all the mayo.

This was really great, however I did listen to some that said it was a bit too wet.  Even the photos of it made me wonder.  So, I made the wet mixture of most ingredients in a separate bowl and added it little by little.  I did not marinate beyond an hour because of time constraint, but the italian flavor was great (I used Good Seasons).  Instead of celery I used red pepper and no onion because I didn't have any.  I added two tbsp of relish which added a really nice flavor and only one can of tuna.  But I think I used less than half of the mixture and it was way less soupy than it would have been and it was greatly to our liking.  We will definitely make this one again!

FISH?!?!? NO WAY?!?!?This was the response I got from my 4 kids who hate fish. They each had 3-4 helpings, even after I told them they were eating fish. I personally like the flavor the Italian dressing gives. Go for the low fat for the dressing,sour cream and mayo. It tastes the same

Really, really good! My first time making this. I made this for a cook out I threw and everyone loved it! This will be my only tuna macaroni salad recipe I ever make and am looking forward to making this again this weekend. I did follow another users suggestion and used 2 cans tuna and I also used ceaser dressing instead of italian. Thanks!

I made this tonight and my husband didn't really like it.  I thought it was ok tasting but the italian dressing was a little overpowering to me.  However, if that's what you like...then this is the recipe for you.

i think adding the sour cream was a little too much. I substituted the celery for peas... just because that's how I've always had macaroni salad. other than that.. I think this was very good and will definitely make it again!

This was a hit with my family... The marinade really gives the pasta flavor. The only thing I did different was add a few hardboiled eggs and use Miracle whip for the mayo, only because thats all I had on hand... I might just use it again because it came out so well... Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this recipe for the 4th of July.  I used one pound of pasta and drenched the pasta in 8oz. of bottled Italian dressing for 5 hours.  After adding all the ingedients, I found it alittle too "saucey" so I added a tomato and an extra can of tuna. I received more compliments on this dish and it made me very happy!

This was good. I think I will omit the sour cream next time, made it a little tangy. However, I will agree with other reviewers that is is very versitile will try some new veggies next time.

This is great.  I can take it to work all week and the salad quality never changes.  I use light sour cream, as well as 2 cans of tuna which I think it needs because it's a sizeable salad. Otherwise, I make as directed.  Definitely make this a day ahead to allow the flavors to meld.  I've never had a problem with the salad being too wet or dry.

Skipped the marinade... and it was equally as delicious. I used a 1:1 ratio for the sour cream and mayo. Yum! Easy and delicious!

I can't really say how this recipe tastes since i didn't follow it exactly.  I used half a box of tri color pasta, 1 can of tuna, some frozen peas, mayo, lite Cesar dressing, salt and pepper. I didn't marinate it since i was short on time. This came out great though!   I ate the whole thing for breakfast and lunch. Yummm

This recipe is seriously awesome. I gave it 5 stars, even though I made some revisions, because I can tell this is clearly a great base recipe, perfect for making your own additions/subtractions of ingredients. I whipped this up for lunch because my mom was coming over and I had not planned anything, so I didn't marinate it. I used less than half the mayo it called for, and probably a little more sour cream than 1/2 c. I didn't have celery, but I did throw in a banana pepper -- seriously adds an AWESOME kick, for those of us who like that kind of flavor. 
SO glad I made this!! It took less than half an hour to throw together, and it is seriously DELICIOUS!! Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum!  I changed the recipe quite a bit but it still turned out great... I like how you can play with whatever ingredients you have on hand.  Instead of onions and celery, I used cooked peas (from frozen) and fresh chopped red pepper.  I also used 2 cans of tuna.  I thought 1 cup mayo seemed like too much and I don't like it that creamy so I used half that and a little more sour cream (lite) and caeser dressing (lite) and few drizzles of olive oil... then squeezed a bit of lemon juice on it and crushed 2 teaspoons of capers... really gave it a nice zing.  I used onion powder instead of onions.  The chopped red peppers in there gave it a nice sweet crunch and the caesar, lemon juice and capers gave it a nice tangy flavor... an addictive combination of flavors!

Really good. Used ingredients I had in the house and some hints from reviews I read. Followed directions but needed to change ingredients a little. Used 1/2 mayo. and 1/2 Miracle Whip, chopped red onion, celery salt in place of celery stalks, added a little Lawry seasoning salt and left out the sour cream because I had none in the house. Will be making this again.

Very good as a main dish or a side dish.  We have found that the longer it sits, the better it tastes.  Make it the day before for maximum flavor.  Thank you for sharing!  For added taste and crunch, add some thinly sliced, chopped radishes.

Great twist on an otherwise boring salad - marinating the mac in Italian dressing really amped up the flavor. I too added chopped green olives and a 2nd can of tuna. Thanks for the great recipe.

I loved this recipe! Based on the other reviews I also added another can of tuna and I used low fat ranch dressing instead of the Italian. I think it works with whatever dressing you want. I also used a little more dressing and less mayo.

I followed the recipe without any additions, deletions or substitutions and although my son quite enjoyed it (he'll eat anything!) I feel I have made better macaroni salad in the past.  Glad I tested it before making a larger quantity for an upcoming family barbeque.  Back to the drawing board.

I am a pasta salad lover; my wife not so much. I have tried many versions of a traditional macaroni salad, but this was my favorite. Not a huge fan of tuna in my salad, but I kept it in and added peas, but left out the onion. I also included some fresh quartered grape tomatoes from the garden and a little dill weed.  The key ingredient was the Italian dressing. That is what made the entire difference. The veggie ingredients used could probably vary by each cook, but the Italian dressing is what made the difference. Saving this recipe to use for myself again.

I modified it by adding 6 boiled eggs diced up. Then I replaced the mayo and sour cream and Italian dressing marinade with ; One packet of dry Italian dressing mix with one large egg,  one whole lemon pureed,  and one half cup of my favorite ultra lite oil- - - blended with 1/2 cup sour cream added in at the end. Then I folded in 1 (ONE) CUP OF HALF COOKED WHOLE WHEAT NOODLES , the celery. onion, garlic, salmon , salt, cayenne, black pepper, and paprika and chilled (8 hours minimum) ,, that is good 'tuna' salad.

This was fabulous! The bf devoured this in no time. I used a bit more celery, salad dressing, and dried onion flakes instead of a fresh one. Also, I just made the pasta, drained, and mixed it into the rest of the ingredients (didn't feel like waiting). This will be added to my regular rotation, thanks!

This was pretty good.  I made extra noodles and had most of the ingredients on hand so I made this and served in over lettuce.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to make it unless I had extra noodles again.

This is a great basic recipe!  I did not use sour cream because I had run out, but I just used mayo- reduced fat Hellman's that tasted great.  I also used low fat Italian dressing which seasoned it perfectly so that I, who usually think everything needs extra salt and pepper, did not have to add any salt or pepper at all.  I increased the tuna to 2 cans and added chopped black olives.

Very good recipe.  I always read reviews before I make a new recipe.  I used caesar salad dressing instead of italian.  And I also did 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup miracle whip.  Also, I did not marinate the macaroni in the dressing overnite.  I just mixed it all together at once and chilled it overnite.  This recipe is a keeper for me and will definitely replace my old one.

I loved this Salad. Although I confess I did not add the tuna...I added my vegetarian chicken instead. Had great flavor though!

I just made this recipie and it came out great oven though I skipped the marinade and just mixed and served! I did use Ceaser instead of Italian, used rotini tri-color and omitted the celery because that is what I had on-hand. Otherwise great kick to the usual tuna salad

AWESOME!!  I used Caesar Italian Dressing and added to the mix: 1/4-cup chopped bread and butter pickles, 1/4-tsp ground mustard, and 1/4-tsp fresh dill weed.  I also used a small onion, which made just enough... I think more would have been overkill.

This recipe brings back memories of dinner on the porch with fresh veggies and cold iced tea and homemade bread.  My mother always made this in the warm months.  It was a true sign that summer had arrived when this appeared for dinner.  I love it!

This was okay but did not have the flavor that I thought it would have. Using the sour cream gave it a different flavor for sure and I should have used Miracle Whip as the pasta did not have that touch of sweetness that I am used to.

We loved this salad!  I left out the sour cream due to dairy allergies and added a second can of tuna.  I was trying to eat fewer carbs but really blew it by making this -- I could not stop eating it!

I read many of the reviews and took some of the advice when I made this. I used Caesar dressing instead of Italian, and instead of one cup of mayo I used 1/2 cup each mayo and Miracle Whip (the one made with olive oil). Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and we LOVED it! I make macaroni salad frequently, and my biggest complaint is that it get kind of "dry" over time and I always have to thin it. I did not have that problem with this recipe. It stayed nicely creamy. The dressing gave it a nice zing. I can absolutely see substituting different dressings - ranch, creamy peppercorn, creamy Italian - and it being equally delicious. I have made this a few times now, both with tuna and without. I even diced up a leftover chicken breast and threw it in and it was good! I have added shredded carrots, and chopped bell peppers of different colors - looks pretty and tastes great. Love this recipe.

I like this recipe although mine wasn't exactly the same. I used Russian dressing instead of italian and used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Also added some small cubed pepper jack cheese pieces and dill. Unfortunately I didn't have any celery on hand but will definitely use it next time. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is rich and creamy and easy to make. My wife thought there was too many noodles. Will make again with 2 cups of noodles. 

Made this a second time using 2 cups of noodles and double the Italian dressing and it came out even better.

Yummo! My family loved this macaroni salad recipe. I did accidentally open up a small can of chicken and added it, then after realizing this I added a can of tuna.  This recipe rocked! Thanks for posting! We will be making this delish dish again

Made it just as written, although doubled the recipe because I was pretty sure it was going to be good...and it sure was! And it's the kind of recipe that you can add/remove ingredients to suit your tastes. I added a little dill to give it a hint of that pickly flavor and next time I might add some red bell pepper for color.

An oldie, but a goodie!  When I was growing up, I remember someone always bringing a huge Tupperware bowl of cold Macaroni & Tuna to every backyard picnic.  To this day, I make sure that it's served at all of our summer cookouts.  It's a tradition w/us. The recipe may be old, but it's still delicious....so go for it!

My late mother used to make this all the time.  But she added so much more to this recipe.  Drain a can of kidney beans, corn, and peas and add to this.  Flavor it with shredded blends of white cheese.  Serve chilled.

I made this for a Memorial Day picnic.  At first I was a bit skeptical after reviewing the ingredients, but it was amazing.  The crowd loved it and asked for the recipe - the only thing I added a little of was carrots and made hard boiled eggs and laid them on top.  Other than that, it was wonderful!

This is good but it's too salty for me so i decided to reduce the portion of salt to 1/2 a teaspoon. And I also decided to add some carrot slices and purple cabbage slices to make it more colorful.

Loved it but I added a few ingredients and quantities. 
Macaroni - 4lbs
Italian Dressing -  24 oz
Sour cream 4 oz
Mayo -  8 oz
Onion -  1 chopped
Celery -  6oz chopped
Garlic cloves - x2 minced
Salt - 2 TBSP
White pepper -  2 TBSP
Tuna, drained -  850grams
Green peas - 1lb
Total weight = 9.625lbs

But I work in a camp so we have to make more than I would at home. Loved it. Will defiantly make again.

I love love love this recipe! Although I didnt put in the sour cream.. I added half miracle whip and half mayo. But I didnt marinate the noodles overnight with the italian dressing, I just mixed all the dressings together and it tastes great! Perfect and easy to make.

This was quite good.  I did make just a couple of changes.  I added peas (frozen, thawed at room temperature), an extra can of tuna and a dash of crushed red pepper flakes.  I liked the way the salad stayed moist.  Most macaroni salads I make seem to dry out the next day.  This one did not and tasted even better the next day or two.  Really enjoyed this, and I will definitely make it again!

Made this yesterday. Started marinating at noon, then assembled at 6pm. I've made a lot of tuna pasta salads in my day, with the usual all-mayo base, but I have to say I wish I would have found this earlier. I like the addition of sour cream and Italian dressing. It took my regular, boring tuna salad to an all new level. I used shell-shaped pasta and added a little mustard because that's how we like it. Delicious. I will make it this way from now on:)

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used homemade italian dressing instead of store-bought.  My mayonnaise was Hellman's Light.  Next time I make it, I will likely add more celery, but as written this is delicious!  Hubby and I both loved it.

Great recipe! Makes a great lunch or dinner on a hot summer day. The only changes I made was that I cut back on the onion a little and added some shredded carrots. Maybe next time I'll add some peas.

This was good, but needed additions. I doubled the amount of tuna, added in chunks of sharp cheddar, and a bit of ranch dressing. Otherwise, it would've been too dry.

This is very good.  I added 2 hard boiled eggs, 1 cup of frozen pears (thawed & drained), 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and a little dill flavoring.  Delicious...my husband ate almost the dish.

I really enjoyed this.  It's quite tasty!  Of course it is a basic recipe and you can do all sorts of modifications.  Myself, I had no good celery in the fridge, so I used about 1/4 tsp. of celery salt.  I also added a small jar of pimentos.  I used two cans of tuna and added just a little more of the sour cream and mayo (about a tablespoon of each) to get the consistency I like.  I used fresh coarsely ground pepper and seasalt (modified since I used the celery salt) and it tasted great!  Oh, I only marinated for 4 hrs.  It was sufficient to marinate into the pasta.

Excellent dish!  But I noticed that something was missing from the overall taste, so I added 3 tablespoons of sugar to my mixture to make it sweeter.  Perfect addition!

Nice salad. Due to my family's preferences, I used pickles instead of celery and onion powder instead of chopped onion. I let it sit overnight, and it became rather dry so I added pickle juice to moisten it. I think next time I'll add tomatoes as well; something was missing.

I don't usually rate a recipe if I made any changes, but in the case, I think the changes I did made it better.  I used 2 tbsp minced onion (didn't have fresh one on hand) and added peas & cajan seasoning. Oh, and I used rotini b/c I didn't have macaroni on hand either. Not big changes but definitely for the better. This a simple, yummy go-to tuna salad.

Ok, so I don't like when people reviews recipes that they have changed a ton. But I think that the changes I made kept all of the flavors and just cut down on the calorie count. I made 2 cups of noodles because it was just for me, and then marinated them in light Italian dressing overnight. Then I used about 1/4 c mayo, 1/2 c light miracle whip and about 1/3 c light sour cream. I didn't have any celery so I used about 1/2 t of celery salt. Awesome! I couldn't wait for lunchtime...had it two days in a row and can't wait to make again. Thanks for sharing!

Yum...I made it pretty much according to the recipe.  I used House Tuscan Italian dressing, as that is what I had on hand, and also used green peppers in place of the celery, as it added nice color and flavor.  Great recipe!

This was good but nothing really different. It's very similar to another pasta salad I make.  The only change was using fat-free Miracle Whip, as I always do, because I don't like real mayo. I'm on the side of those saying the Italian marinade did nothing for it. After marinating, I could taste none of that dressing - I'm sure it would be just as good without it.
UPDATE 12/2/12:  Just decided to up this to a 5 star.  It has grown on me more and I find myself maing it quite a bit.

Good.  I omitted the tuna and added egg and served it as a side dish.  Then to the leftovers I added chicken that I marinated in italian dressing to have for lunches that week.  I recommend that you refridgerate the salad overnight, it gives time for all the flavors to meld.

Great recipe.  The italian dressing added the right amount of zing.  I used red onion for color.  It was great as is, but I added black olives and fresh spring onions (just for my personal taste).  I served this on a bed of lettuce. Everyone loved it.

This was an ok pretty much run of the mill Mac Salad.  Closing your eyes and guessing would put the same ingredients in.  I used Miracle Whip and a bit of Tastie Dressing to give it the zing it would have been lacking had I not known what I was doing.

This was okay. Nothing special. I couldn't really taste the flavor of the dressing and it ended up being a little dry after it chilled anyway.

Excellent as it is- talk about great comfort food!  Amazingly easy to make and wonderful in it's simplicity.  My husband likes things that are flavored more heavily so I made my second batch with twice the Italian dressing marinade, zesty style, and left it overnight.  You can also add spices as desired but I found the extra marinade solved his issue.  Personally, I love it just as is.  Thanks for a great recipe!

yes. It was good but the zesty Italian dressing that I used permeated the salad and was  quite strong and was less tasty for me. Next time I will choose a different one, maybe a bit sweeter

I enjoy this recipe, made it a few times. I substituted veganaise for mayo and used light sour cream. Also added celery seed, cumin, lemon juice and a little cayenne pepper. Came out great!

Made it verbatim, but did add homemade bacon bits. Otherwise, great recipe. I don't want to give the illusion that this is healthy in anyway and don't feel the need to replace any of the items to fool myself into thinking so. No matter how you make it, pasta is not really a "healthy" choice, but , it is delicious! Spoil yourself once and a while and take a break from all the health kick ideas.

I've never found a tuna/mac salad I would make a 2nd time, until now. This was delicious and I will make it again this week. I read many reviews and added the most frequent ingredients suggested.....dill, chopped egg,  red peppers (for colour) and thawed frozen peas. I reduced the mayo but increased the seasonings. I had small shell pasta and kept it separate after cooking and only stirred the Italian dressing  into it, to stop it from sticking together. I mixed everything else together in a bowl and added a splash of hot sauce, for zing. Wow, it was sooo good and even better the next day. This one's a keeper! Thank you for sharing the recipe and to all the helpful suggestions.

Added sweet peas and chopped, very ripe tomato. Bow Tie pasta also makes it look a little cooler.

This recipe turned out really good and I didn’t let the noodles marinate in the Italian dressing for 2 to 3 hours or overnight.  It was a fast and convenient recipe that I will use again at some point. Thanks for sharing.

I would have never thought to marinate in Italian dressing and I don't particularly like it, but I tried it anyway. Pow! It is perfect. Never thought to add sour cream or garlic powder either, but again very good. I doubled the recipe. I added half a cup or so of frozen peas as well. I also used white pepper instead of black pepper. I used 1 t of seasoning salt instead of salt. I added 1/8 t of celery seed and dried marjoram. Thanks for the recipe! Everyone loved it!

I modified so my 11 year old would eat it.  Used good seasons Italian dressing with red wine vinegar. Used one shallot instead of onion, microwaved for 30 seconds to cut the sharpness.  Omitted the celery, added grape tomatoes cut in half.  2 cans of tuna.  It was excellent.  My husband said i can make it anytime.

Super easy! I added black olives and used salmon instead of tuna. I also used brown rice pasta and replaced the sour cream with yogurt for a more healthy heart recipe.

I’ve been making this for a few years now. This has got to be the best Tuna Macaroni Salad I’ve ever ate. It has such a great flavor. My mom told me years ago to only use tuna in oil and that’s what I do. I use an organic tuna packed in organic olive oil. I’m absolutely positive if I used tuna in water the flavor wouldn’t be nearly as good. I make this dish several times a year. I’m very happy I found it and I thank the person who submitted it.

Be aware that 3 cups is a LOT of macaroni.  That may not be a problem, because this is a delicious dish, and everyone will want a big serving.  I did make a couple of changes.  First, I used two cans of tuna, because one didn't seem like enough protein for such a large quantity of macaroni.  The other thing I did was add a diced red pepper, which added crunch and color.   I'll gladly make this again.  It's an excellent meal for hot summer days, and would be great for picnics too.

I did not care for this--I was surprised.  Sounded good, but was very bland to me. Used shell pasta, as that was what I had. Was hoping flavor would develop overnight, but that didn't happen. Will keep looking.

Excellent recipe.  I just decreased the mayo and sour cream, didn't have celery and used green peas.  Spices and consistency were perfect.

Nothing spectacular.  As good as others I have made in the past.  Did like the idea of adding Italian dressing to the mayo/sour cream dressing.  Added a little zip to the flavor.

Picky 6 and 8 year olds ate it so a big hit in my book!   They don't like onion but I grated part of one and used a little onion salt and they didn't notice.   Made it again today for out of town visitors and added capers that give it a more salty flavor I love.  Did not care for substitution of salmon or addition of carrots.  Next time I'll try frozen peas.  A great recipe to experiment with!

Made it per recipe but used 2 cans of tuna. I felt too much macaroni for only 5 Oz. Tuna. We enjoyed the flavor. Will be making again.

I used lower fat versions of sour cream...adding LF Greek Yogurt as well. Also "Lite" mayo and other dressings (used some lower fat Ranch as well. I need to cook the vegetables till they are softer...so I boiled celery and carrots in seasoned broth and added green peas for color. Not to mention sauteing red onion and garlic for a similarly required softer chew of the onion than adding it raw. It's just me. I did add some other seasonings and additional ground pepper...

This was pretty delicious and easy to make. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, other than to make only half the recipe, but kept the tuna quantity the same.

I'm  giving it 5 stars, but it's with my alterations. I only used 3/4 C of mayo and no sour cream. Added grape tomatoes, cucumber and 2 cans of tuna.

I did not like this recipe at all. I made it  following the recipe. The tuna made the dish have a grainy mouthfeel, which I found disagreeable. There was so much of this recipe, i think the football team couldn't have finished it all. Finally, it stunk up the refrigerator, making me nauseous. I threw the entire thing down the insinkerator.

Very Good. Followed the recipe but used 2 cans of tuna and it was magic. Good blend of flavors. Got tired of  tuna sandwiches and this is the answer. Will make again. More raw onion always, could eat a raw onion like an apple.

I made this macaroni salad for myself to begin with, I loved it.  It was flavorful and I loved the slight crunch provided by the celery in it.  I also made it and took it to a potluck dinner and it disappeared quickly.  I was also approached for the recipe from a few ladies.  It's a winner.  Easy to make and tasty.

Very tasty but I halved salt and pepper.  Go ahead and half onion as well.  It's way too much burning raw onion.  Couldn't really taste the italian dressing.

I am rating this per the exact recipe. It had good flavor but not enough extras and was way, way too saucy with too much dressing. However, it is very easy to make modifications and make this a 5 star dish. You can add extra tuna, peas, spinach, cut back on the amount of dressing, whatever, but as it is written, I wanted to wash off dressing from about 1/3 of the salad.

The pasta I used was not right.  After cooking and putting
 on the dressing it stuck together.
However it was wonderful and I can't wait to make it again.

I made this salad as written and it was good. I have been making tuna macaroni salad for years. I use just half mayo and half sour cream for my dressing with salt and pepper.I also add chopped hard boiled eggs and sprinkle paprika on top.

Nice start! I increase Italian dressing, decrease mayo and double tuna. Add sweet relish, dashes of garlic, turmeric, and curry powder. Fresh dill a must. 
If you are brave enough add any or all of these: lemon juice, red wine vinegar, white vinegar. Increase slowly and do it to your taste. Don't be scared though!

The only change I made was to double the tuna and add frozen peas. Outstanding. I believe the overnight marinade really adds to the flavor and I wouldn't skip this part.

It would be easy to ruin this recipe with too many or too strong of onions.  Use a small white onion, if you can.

We loved this recipe!  Only changes made were I used Ditalini instead of Macaroni, used less red onion (family not fans) and add one more can of tuna (one can was not enough for family of 4!).  I will definitely make this again and add some red bell pepper for crunch and color!

I only marinated the pasta for about 3 hours, added 10 oz of tuna (I had packets in the pantry, no cans), a little heavy on the seasonings and it's fantastic. I might add chopped eggs and olives next time. And there will be a next time.

Followed the original recipe with the exception of adding an extra can of tuna and I also added black olives. Marinated the pasta in Italian dressing overnight. I was a little concerned that this would be too wet, but I took a chance and made it just as OP wrote it, not too wet at all. Very tasty and a great base to experiment with.

I made a few changes as well, I added some celery seed, some dill and I used 1/2 cup Hellman's and a 1/2 cup of Miracle Whip, with the sour cream. I also added green olives, I thought it was delicious. Even better the next day as the flavors all married together.

Very easy to make and it sure kept the kitchen cool on a very hot day.  I added an extra can of tuna to increase the protein content and just a little bit of hot peppers to give it a bit of a  kick.  My family enjoyed it and I will make this again.

This made a tasty salad. I adjusted seasoning to my tastes, used two cans of tuna and added carrot.  By accident I used too much Italian dressing so I may not use it at all next time just to see how that changes the flavor. As with most recipes on this site, I like finding a good base and making it my own. I was able to do that with this recipe and will definitely make it again.

This was just okay for me. Adding fresh dill would have been a good addition. I probably won't make this again. I used low-fat sour cream and low-fat mayo to make it just a bit lighter in fat calories.

We really liked this salad. However, I couldn't help but make a few tweaks: I used cooked shrimp instead of tuna, added some lemon zest, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I used the robust Italian dressing that you mix up yourself; it worked well.

I used a 12 oz. can of tuna in water. I added half a can of water chestnuts for more crunch and another stalk of celery as well. I also added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to add some tang. I surprised myself. I wasn't sure I'd like the cold version of Tuna casserole but I did.

This tuna salad is fabulous.  I used bowtie pasta and Caesar dressing only because I had them on hand and didn't want to go to the store.   Added 2 cans o f tuna - we love tuna.  It s easy to make and seemed much lighter than ordinary tuna salad.  Was great the 2nd day too.

I made this exactly as the recipe said, except I used green onions because I already had them on hand.  We all LOVED it, including my husband, so that says volumes about it.  I think the Italian salad dressing makes it special.  Will be making this again!

I doubled this recipe. I substituted with light sour cream,light mayonnaise & light zesty Italian. It tasted good when first made, but it was amazing after sitting in the refrigerator over night. Definitely let it sit over night for the best flavor.

This turned out good.  I was following the recipe as I had all the ingredients, but my sour cream was bad so substituted yogurt.  It was vanilla yogurt.  Sour cream would have better better, as the yogurt  added another favor.  But after 2 days it was better.  I also added black olives.

OMG I made this version of the tuna pasta salad, and I followed it to the Tee.  I would NOT change a thing.  It was the best tuna pasta salad I ever tasted.  I did not want to bring it to the cookout, I wanted to continue eating it all by myself.  My family LOVED it.  I will not stray from making this ever again.  THIS IS A KEEPER  ladies, and gentlemen..

Oh my goodness, this is the best macaroni salad I've ever made!  It's so creamy and no ingredient overpowers another.  I was afraid that a whole chopped onion would be too much but it's perfect!  Other than adding one tablespoon of dill pickle relish, I went exactly by the recipe and certainly not disappointed.  Will absolutely make again.

I made this recipe with a few minor changes - used fat free Greek yogurt since I didn't have sour cream on hand, 3 packets of tuna, 1 chopped yellow bell pepper and a little extra Italian dressing since there wasn't much left in the bottle.  It turned out to be the most delicious macaroni salad that I have ever eaten and so easy to make.  I have made macaroni salads before that were very bland after sitting in the fridge but this macaroni has stayed creamy and flavorful for several days.   I think that allowing the macaroni to soak up the Italian dressing makes a huge difference. I will definitely be making this again and again.

This tuna macaroni salad brings me back to my childhood. The flavors are a great marriage. Marinating the pasta gives flavor to the pasta which  adds a lot to the overall success. I added more tuna but that is all I really changed. My family and I loved this and will be making it again.

Thank you so much for the easy gardening day rescue dinner.I made as written except I used one garlic clove crushed into the mayo part as I do not use the salt.I did cook the mac and mix early in the morning to marinate.My hubby is a fussy eater and not fond of Tuna,he asked for seconds and rated the dinner a five star.Served up on Simpson leaf garden lettuce surrounded by cutTomatoes and tiny slices of Avocado.Thanks again.Mimi

This is a great summer dish. We ate it with an heirloom tomato and it was wonderful.  I did make this with some alternative ingredients according  to reviews but this is a very good basic recipe you can make your own. I only had wide egg noodles and cooked the whole package, which worked fine. I added 2 cans of tuna, green pepper and frozen baby peas (which helps to chill it!). I had Miracle Whip and Brianna's Asiago Ceasar dressing. I only wish I thought to by some Asiago or Parmesan cheese to top it or mix in. I also used fresh baby dill. My husband added crushed potato chips and loved it. We will make again.

Did not have time to marinate the cooked noodles 24 hours - did about 6 hours. Had added a chicken bouillon cube to the water when boiling the noodles, so used no additional salt.  Used Zesty Italian dressing. Did not have sour cream so used Greek yogurt - a 7 oz. container and added Miracle Whip lite to make the 1 1/2 cups. No celery on hand either. Added quite a bit of dried dill - some to the noodles while marinating and more to the "sauce."  Mixed the sauce ingredients and added 2 cans of tuna, mixing well before adding to the noodles.  Yummy, and should have enough to last several days.  Thanks for sharing

I enjoyed making this recipe with an added twist.  In addition to macaroni, I also added cheese filled tortellini, and it was a big hit.,  Everyone loved it, and I have to assume that the marin ating process had a lot to do with it.

Great easy Summer dinner or side dish.  My family liked it and said it would be a great lunch idea for school/work.  I doubled the tuna since I had a 12 oz can,  used a whole box of macaroni (14.5 oz), doubled the sour cream and seasonings, used Italian dressing.  Turned out very nice.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make it again.

I made this recipe but took the advice of adding dill to the dressing.  I used shrimp instead of tuna, added the juice of half a small lemon (added freshness and more zing), and fresh corn for some sweetness. It turned out beautifully!

Yes will do again and experiment wth mild curry powder instead of or as well as garlic powder. Also i used red onion - generally better with a cold salad dish and added a small tin of drained sweet corn, yum with tuna/mayonnaise

I thought it was pretty good.  I added the Italian dressing when the macaroni was warm which seemed to help it absorb better.  I used a low salt adobo seasoning along with minced garlic to taste.  I think I may try it with crab or lobster meat next time.

I grew up eating this and has been a staple in my life. I never used the garlic, onions or Italian dressing. Just miracle whip, tuna, celery, boiled eggs, salt and pepper. .. my adult kids and friends love it.

I make this type Tuna salad often and opt for using olive oil and wine vinegar instead of mayo etc.  I also add red and green chopped fresh peppers  and thin sliced or chopped sweet onion. Lower in fat!

I had hopes when I made this, just didn't like it.  I thought the dressing was too heavy for the salad and yet it didn't really have much flavor.  Won't make again.

I love this recipe. I had never marinated the noodles before in dressing, i like the taste. And I love Tuna so I always use at least 6 cans and add 2-3 boiled eggs. Delicious

Adding  the drained hot macaroni to the Italian dressing helps the flavor to be better absorbed!
So easy to make: I bumped up the amount of tuna to 10 oz to offset the predominant mayo taste and it was great!

VERY VERY GOOD!! I wanted to try a different version as I was getting bored with the tuna Mac salad that I have always made. This one sounded the best.. And it was!!! My WHOLE family loved it! The only things different I did was that I only marinated the noodles in Italian dressing for about 20 minutes because I didn't plan ahead, I used a box of macaroni and only needed about 3/4 cup of mayo. I also added an extra can of tuna!  Will be making this over and over again definitely a keeper!

I loved this with a few changes, instead of the Italian dressing I boiled the noodles in vinegar and water. I also used ranch dressing instead of mayo... came out great!!!

I had two four oz cans of tuna on hand and used both. After tasting the recipe I decided to add another stalk of celery, as well as some chopped bell pepper. I served this as a deconstructed salad. The tuna salad on a romain leaf accompanied by carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, a hard boiled egg wedges, radishes and pickle slices. Everyone raved.

I just made this and it's in the fridge chilling now. But even in its semi warm state it tastes delicious! 
I made it as stated except just used mayo as I didn't have any sour cream. Can't wait until dinner in a few hours !
Thank you for the recipe!

Very simple recipe.  Salad dressing gives it a boost of flavor.  I have experimented with different salad dressings and recipe worked well with all of them.  This is a good side dish that I make often and always get compliments

This was outstanding!  I didn't change a thing and went exactly by the recipe.  My company loved it.  Very easy and quick to make.  Marinating the pasta made it so much better tasting.  I will be making this many times.

This has way too much mayo, which affected the flavor and rating.  I only used 1/2 cup, and it was still too much.  However, other than the too much mayo taste, it was not too bad. We love canned tuna, so I did use 2 cans not 1. If you like a lot of mayo, then this is for you.  If you want a moderate mayo taste, then you will want to adjust it. I'm going to look for alternatives to mayo or just reduce it further, maybe to a 1/3 of a cup.  My daughter did like it.  However, my husband's stomach did not, though I think it was because of the excess mayo.  My daughter commented that it tasted and smelled like a tuna melt which is a big compliment.  We love tuna melts here. :)

I didn't have time to marinate the macaroni but I let it sit for 10 minutes or so before mixing in the other stuff.  I used two 7 oz cans of tuna.  I used Lite Mayo.  Otherwise I made it exactly as per the recipe and it was really a hit.  I will make it with some of the suggestions another time.  Thanks!

It was a good recipe, but a little too much onion for me, and way too salty- I think you could probably cut the salt in half and it would still be good, and cut the onion back to a tablespoon or two, minced.

No changes.  Did marinade the pasta.  Mixed the remainder and chilled 45 min. - 1 hr.  Husband didn't like the sour taste and thought not enough tuna. Myself and daughter thought too much onion.

This was yummy. I made it for a kid-friendly get together. I omitted the sour cream & stuck to 1 can of tuna (after reading other reviews). It was plenty of tuna for our tastes.

I started with this recipe and made a few changes as did others. I used green pepper instead of celery. Halfed the mayo and replaced with half miracle whip plus a couple more tablespoons. I perfer Kraft Zesty Italian and added just a few squirts more. Albacore tuna packed in water keeps down the fishy taste but this salad is really good without the tuna.

Mmm... it was yummy, my boyfriend loved it! He requested me to do this one more often! Although I altered a bit the recipe: I added 2 cans of tuna, 1/4 of the onion, and less mayo (like 1/2 cup) Thanks!!

I've never made macaroni salad this way before, but I made it just as written and it was wonderful.

Very fast and easy to make...I skipped the marainating and just mixed some of the Italian dressing in with the rest of the salad.  Added bacon bits also.

Very good flavor, and easily made. Makes an excellent lunch entree or dinner/potluck side dish. I used Seasoned Salt instead of regular Table Salt.

This was pretty much like any tuna salad I have made. The italian dressing did not do much to it. I left out the onions and garlic powder and added paprika and hard boiled eggs.

I was a little disappointed with the dressing in this recipe.  I used real mayo, and wonder if Miracle Whip woulda' been better, i.e. it mighta have added a little more zing.  Also, I'm not a tuna eater, so I used chicken breast instead of tuna.  I also added peas to the recipe.

Took this to a potluck and got many compliments!  Used ham instead of tuna and it still turned out great.
