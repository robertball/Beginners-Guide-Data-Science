I really love pumpernickel bread and this one is delightful. I followed the recipe but made it in the kitchen aid and baked it in the oven. It turned out moist and delicious! I am so happy to have found this recipe thank you. I will make it many more times....

Mixed and kneeded in the Kitchen Aide with a dough hook for 10 minutes.  Texture came out great.  Not a large second rise in the bread pan, but the finished texture was right for a heavier bread and the taste was great.  I am going to try adding gluten next time to see if the rise is better.

This is a bread recipe that I have wanted for a long time. Now I have found it.  This is just like what  the Outback Steak House serves.  I changed the loaf size though. I divided the dough into 4 small loaves and they turned out perfect.
I took these to work and my co-workers couldn't believe how good it was.
This is a definate keeper.  Thanks Rodney!!!!

Out of the few rye/dark bread recipes listed on this site, this came out the best. I did bake in the bread machine. The loaf was smaller than most - more like a 1lb loaf but shape and texture was good. Taste is very good.

Finally!  A pumpernickel bread that isn't as dense as a rock!  I got a nice-sized loaf that was fragrant and light- textured--can't wait 'til tomorrow to have a turkey pastrami sandwich made on this wonderful bread.  I adjusted it for high altitued:  decrease liquid by 2 T., decrease sugars by 1/2 tsp., decrease yeast by 1/2 tsp., and increase salt by 1/4 tsp.  When I first started using a bread machine, my loaves would always rise up beautifully and then fall during the baking process.  When I started adjusting for high altitude (we live at 7000 ft.), the problem was solved!  I baked this bread from start to finish in the bread machine; I also added 3 T. gluten.

I don't have a breadmaker but it was still very easy, and rose perfectly, this after I let it sleep in the fridge overnight.

Mmm, very good.  I visited America this summer and fell in love with pumpernickel bagels, then cried when I came back to Scotland and the best I could get was German Rye bread.  This recipe stopped my tears, it is better than the bagels.  It has a strong flavour, plenty of caraway seeds, and works well even if you do just bake it in the breadmaker.  The bread also keeps well in the fridge for ages.

Haven't had any kids try it, so, cannot rate that, but, I make this bread for my mother because she loves pumpernickel.  She says it's the best bread she has ever had.  It is worth the extra ingredients and time it takes to make this bread, because she says it's so great.

The only thing I added was 3T of Gluten.  The bread tuned out very nice, rose well, great color, my husband didn't think the flavor was quite right.  I might cut down on the cocoa powder next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

After trying the popular rye bread recipe yesterday and failing miserably, I decided to try something with more flavor.  My first loaf of this turned out DELISH! I read through all of the reviews before beginning and basically took everyone's advice.  Here are the changes I made: *I brewed 2 shots of espresso then diluted it with water to get my 1.25 cups of warm water.  I then dissolved a generous 1.5 Tbls molasses in it. Checked the temp, added the yeast and whisked. (subbed all this for the instant coffee and plain ol' water) *I only had Ghirardelli sweetened cocoa, so I used 2Tbls of it instead of the dry milk powder & unsweetened cocoa powder.  *I also added about 1/4 tsp each of grated nutmeg & ground clove.  *In addition to using 1/4 c. bread flour, I added 3 Tbls wheat gluten. I don't have a bread machine, so I did it all by hand.  The first rise looked ok, but the second rise wasn't as obvious.  I also flubbed and forgot to add the veggie oil until I was halfway through with kneading, but I added it as soon as I realized and it seemed to be fairly forgiving. Dusted the pan with cornmeal, scored an X in the top, & sprinkled the loaf with brown sugar. It baked for 40 full minutes, but probably would be perfect with 45. Not impressed with the size, but the texture and flavor are excellent!

Although the bread was not what I expected, it was nonetheless very good. I was expecting it to be slightly sweeter, therefore next time i will add about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I could also not find caraway seeds in my grocery store so i used a combination of poppy seeds and sesame seeds, which my family and I really liked. I mixed it in my kitchenaid and it still turned out perfectly. First, I added all the dry ingredients together. Then I dissovled the molasses in the warm water and then sprinkled the yeast on top until it foamed. I then added the oil and then added the wet to the dry in my kitchenaid with the mixing paddle. When it came together, i switched the the bread hook. I found that 10 minutes is necessary for the kneading time with the hook. Basically i just waited until the dough was not sticky. I then divided the dough into two rounds and let it rest for ten minutes. Then I pinched and tucked the dough into logs and placed them in oiled 7x9 pans that were sprinkled with cornmeal. I also brushed the top of the bread with milk and sprinkled more cornmeal on top. Next time I will also sprinkle some sugar on top, because the crust tastes somewhat bland. I let them sit in a warm place with a damp cloth over it for about 45 minutes until they had doubled. The second rise was great as well. I then baked them in a 375 oven for 30 minutes. Basically this bread would be great for sandwiches or toast. I was looking for more of a dinner roll type, b

I'am an executive chef and what I did was add 1tsp honey , another 1/2 teaspoon of yeast, tripled the amount of caraway. Used brewed coffee (strong) 1/2 cup in place of the water. made the dough to the right consistancy adding white flour as I went along. Kneaded for 5min in a kitchen aid. Let it rise 2 hours or to when the top flattens out . punched down diviided into 3 loaves. let rise again about 30min . baked at 450 for 20 min and then 350 until the center was 185 degrees. cooled on a wire rack. It was great. cant wait to try it with some homemade cured salmon .

Great recipe.  I made the folowing changes.

I used one full packet of yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons), Increased to 2 tablespoons molasses, added 1 tablespoon brown sugar, subtracted two tablespoons bread flour, added 2 tablespoons gluten flour, mixed for 15 minutes with bread hook, let rise 30 minutes under damp towel, second rise in 9x5 loaf pan for 1 hour, baked at 350 for 30 minutes and covered with foil for 10 more minutes.  Great rise, and wonderful flavor.  Loaf turned out beautiful and tasted the same.

Loved it, loved it! This is a really great bread recipe.  Easy to prepare using your bread machine, smells wonderful while in the oven, and tastes great.   This bread makes a great grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Thanks so much for sharing, Rodney.  This one is definitely a keeper!

I made this exactly as recipe stated, except I did it all the way in the bread maker, on 1.5lb loaf and light crust setting.  I was perfect, and the kids love it too!  Thank you so so much, just what I wanted:)

Delicious bread.  A very mild tasting pumpernickel.  The only thing I did different was to make it in the bread machine and put it on the dough setting.  When it finished, I shaped it in a round and baked it.  I used it to put a dip in the center after taking pieces of bread out and served it with the bread, crackers and veggies.  Everyone loved it!

Ok...I am pretty sure I did something wrong with this recipe. I made a few substitutions, which might have caused the bad results. The result was eatable, but nowhere as soft and fluffy as the one in the picture.
I had no whole wheat or bread flour at home. So I increased all purpose flour by 1/4 c and rye by 1/2 c.
The amount of water seemed way too much. The dough turned out more like a think batter. It rose very well, but the surface was riddled with holes. 
The final product was very dense. The top was flat with a very thick and hard crust.Very unappealing appearance. 
The taste was OK, I can still eat it, just cant relish it. The taste was also slightly bitter.

Although I had to make a few alterations, this bread still came out great and just like I remember it as a kid. I left out the milk powder, since I did not have any and since I only had all purpose flour and rye flour, I used 2 c all purpose flour and 1 1/4 c rye flour and it was great. Next time I will add more caraway seeds, since I love this taste.

UNBELIEVABLY good! I didn't have caraway at hand, but even without it bread was so flavorful, wonderful texture and crispy crust. Next time I'll follow the recipe completely and bake bread in the oven rather than in the bread machine, I think it would rise better.

This was the best pumpernickel bread I  ever ate. The batter was so dense, I was afraid it would not be good, but it turned out to be one of the best things I ever made. Will throw away all my other rye bread recipes and turn to this one again and again.

Great Pumpernickel bread!  Converted to sourdough and used sourdough starter, 210 grams and cut back 100 grams of water and all purpose four.  Worked out great!

Beat tasting rye bread I have made!

I changed this recipe a little.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour, I used bread flour and then used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour instead of 1/2 cup.  I had to add a little extra water, it is winter, so that may be why and I proofed it in the oven on the proof setting.  It absolutely is the best Rye Bread I ever made.  It rose perfectly and has a great texture.

I love this recipe... it has a lot of ingredients to assemble, but is worth it! I make it like several other reviewers, baking it on a greased baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal, with a deep X cut in the top... more of a rustic loaf. It is wonderful warm with butter!

I followed the recipe but kneaded in my KitchenAid Mixer and baked it in the oven at 325F for about 45 minutes.  It turned out really nice.  I think I'll be adding more sugar next time though; I like seet breads.

I left out the milk powder and added a heaping T of gluten and 1/2-3/4 c wheat bran. Instead of water I just used warm coffee from breakfast. The dough rose fine and produced a really soft bread. It's very strong flavored, so add some sugar or cut back on the rye or molasses if you don't want a really bold taste.

This was so good.  It tasted like the bread was from a bakery.  I did mess up and confused the ap & the bread flour amounts but it was stil great.  I'll keep making it that way

this recipe for pumpernickel is great.Similar to taste of Publix pumpernickel . Only changes I made was to add 1 cup of raisins and eliminate caraway seeds.Another time I'll get the caraway.I didn't have bread flour so added some vital gluten to regular flour.  5 ****** for Rodney

I baked this in my bread machine on the whole wheat setting and it came out great. However I like the regular caraway rye bread recipes I've tried on this site better.

This pumperknickel has great flavor and a great dark color. It rose well in the bread pan, but it didn't rise as high as I thought it would while baking. The taste makes up for that though. Next time I'll add more caraway seeds, but that's just because I really like them.

Great recipe! So happy it raised nicely! Will make again. Serving it with Hungarian mushroom soup also found on AR. I used my KA mixer, kneaded about 7 minutes. Let rise a good 90 minutes. Shaped and second rise came faster. I use instant gold yeast.

Great recipe. I used 2 tsp. of yeast rather than 1 1/2 tsp. I slightly increased the caraway seeds and added 1 T. of brown sugar to make the recipe suit my taste. The bread had a great flavor and great texture. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made it aaa'artisan" style.  I added 3T. gluten, also.  It didn't rise upward, mostly out! I can see why this needs to bake in a pan! I did get a loaf aprox. 2 1/2 inches tall, tho' It is nice and light, although I thought there was too much cocoa. The flavor was very strong. Other than that, good recipe!

My husband said this was good but I am not a fan.  It did not make a nice sized loaf, only about 3 inches tall.  If I make it again I'll use an 8 X 4 pan and try to make it rise a little more.  I even added 3 t. wheat gluten as suggested by one reviewer.  I'll give it a 4 just because hubby liked it.

I love this recipe!! Perfect... the ONLY THING that I would change though is the amount of caraway seed... I found that there was too much and I would probably only put maybe half a tablespoon of it into the mix. Other than that, I loved it!

Loved this recipe.  Just out of personal taste, I think I will opt to add a little bit more salt and a tbsp of sugar next time (I like mine a little sweeter), but no changes other than that.  I mixed in the KitchenAid for about 10 minutes, formed into a ball, and allowed it to rise as a bread bowl.  Baked at 350 for approx 40 minutes, and served with Mississippi Six dip.  Big hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this bread today, using my KitchenAid Mixer.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I kneaded it in the mixer for about 10 min, because the recipe was for using a bread machine.  It turned out wonderful.  I love the nice soft texture of it.  I used all organic ingredients in this recipe, and I just have to say, it will be one of my breads that I bake very often.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I did the receipe exactly as written but it came out hard and dense.  I personally liked it, but my family found it hard to chew.  Would love to have suggestions on how I could have made it softer and more edible.

I started this recipe in a bread machine then I formed into 4 smaller loaves, let rise and baked, taking off a little time to compensate for the smaller loaves.  It turned out perfect!  Reminded of my grandmother from Denmark, all I needed was pickled herring and an onion slice. I rather have my pumpernickel with just butter anyway.

Used an egg wash and added quick oats to the top. Baked at 375 degrees for 35 minutes and also put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven to make the steam which is important to a proper loaf of bread.  YUMMY!

I added 1 Tablespoon of honey to sweeten but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I used a Bosch Mixer, I wonder if I over kneaded it?  All in all this loaf is very tasty, albeit dense and heavy.  Should be noted that this is my first attempt at seriously real bread...I have made a ton of white bread and as crazy as I ever got was adding a tablespoon of molasses  and a cup of whole wheat flour or maybe a cup of nine grain cereal but certainly never both!  I doubled the recipe the dough was rather dry and when I went to form loaves it didn't relax and forgive me, it was quite firm.  The first rise was decent... the second filled the loaf pan but didn't rise above and beyond the edge of the pan...maybe I was expecting too much.  I think this recipe is a keeper, I will work at being a better bread maker. I need to respect whole grains a little more than I probably did.  Let it be known though, I wouldn't be ashamed to share this loaf with company, my first attempt was a worthy one.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Perfect pumpernickel bread. But I made the following changes;
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1  cup whole wheat flour
2 tsp instant coffee powder
3 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tbsp caraway seed
And I think this is the best bread yet
2 tsp active dry yeast

I made the pumpernickel bread exactly like the recipe and it did not rise at all. It is edible but very dense.

I make it by hand.   My secret to success with whole grain breads is to soak the whole grains.   Make an overnight sponge of  rye flour, water, small amount of yeast and molasses.

Mix the other ingredients and put in separate bowl, except yeast, leave that in the packet, I also cut back the salt a little bit. 

In the morning I get up and put the sponge in the mixing bowl with the rest of the yeast and a cup of warm water and let it set for a couple of minutes. then add the  rest of the ingredients and knead.  whole grains are sticky and I learned from the King Arthur site that you can just let them set for a few minutes before kneading.    I let rise for an hour and half, shape into the baking pans and let rise for over an hour.   I bake in small baking pans in my  toaster oven and 30 minutes usually enough.

Excellent firm, chewy , flavorful bread . We made this into eight rolls topped with a little minced onion for sandwiches . Since we do not have instant coffee , we substituted a cup and a quarter of fresh strong coffee for the water . The sandwiches were a hit and will make this recipe again .

Made it in my bread machine. Medium loaf, light crust--turned out perfect. Yummy.  First time I've used molasses that they worked properly with the yeast. Will use this one regularly.

This bread was great and very flavorful.   I do have one concern.  It is reviewers that try to evaluate and review, hardly following any of the  instructions or ingredients, doing their own thing and then giving a terrible rating.  What's right about that.  Is this hardly fair.

I will definitely make this again. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. However, I don't have a bread machine, so I kneaded it by hand. It is so moist and delicious. My husband LOVES it!

This must be a foolproof recipe because I made a lot of mistakes and it still came out good. I misread the recipe and added too much water, had no vital wheat gluten, and tried it in my food processor. I ended up kneading by hand, adding dark rye and AP flour as needed. It turned out fine. Very nice toasted, topped with tomato and avocado slices.

absolutely loved how the bread turned out.  made dough in bread machine and baked round loaf in oven.  Awesome recipe.  Loved it.  Will be my go-to pumpernickel/dark bread recipe.  only tweaks:  a little onion powder and cider vinegar--decreased cocoa to 1 tbsp and added a little extra caraway seed.

I used extra cocoa since we don't have coffee and I skipped the milk powder and threw a dash of milk into the kitchenaid. We didn't have bread flour so I used the all-purpose. The texture and everything was good but my husband and I were very confused about a weird strong taste that we have not had in rye breads before. Possibly the caraway? Anyway we can eat it and enjoy it just fine but we will probably have that "what's in this?" face for a while on our first bites.

My only tweak was instead of using water plus instant coffee I just used brewed coffee in place of the water. A couple other pumpernickel recipes I tried were too heavy on the molasses.

"RYElly" not a rye/pumpernickel bread. Don't get me wrong - homemade fresh bread right out of the oven is soooo yummy and such a treat it's hard to see the negative. However, after going through the motions of making this bread - measuring, tempering, rising and resting and rising and baking - then slicing a nice hunk off a fresh loaf with a pat of butter - I fully expected to taste rye/pumperknickel...and I didn't. It was good, but not flavorful. My husband said it best, "something is missing." I responded with, "YA, the rye/pumpernickel taste! Hello" Anyhoo - I won't be making this recipe again - I'll be on the look out for a higher rated rye/pumpernickel.

This is a great loaf of bread.  Especially good as TV snacks with thin slices of gravlax.  I have this one saved on my personal reciope list.  I used half the salt, omitted the coffee (did not have any), and used two squares of unsweetened chocolate in place of the cocoa.  I melted the chocolate in a microve first.

I was very pleased with the final results - I opted to make this all by hand and bake in the oven as opposed to the bread machine.  Nice dense loaf with great texture.  It doesn't make a very big loaf, but the size is good enough for smaller sandwiches.  Tastes great toasted.  Next time, I'll add additional salt.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I've made this three times already. I love it and it makes great sandwiches! I do add 2 tbsp wheat gluten and it makes the bread extra light... this last time I also used 1 1/4 C coffee instead of water and instant coffee grounds. Then I added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and ground cloves for an added kick. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipe with good ingredients. The only problem I had with it was it just didn't rise enough. I let it sit for even longer than it said to, but it still didn't rise as much as I'd liked.

If you like a dense heavy bread then you'll like this.I wasn't pleased with this at all,I guess I was expecting something else.When I made this I had a heck of a time waiting for it to rise,it just wouldn't rise for the second time at all.I definately won't be making this again,I'm still trying to forget the strong taste of this.
