After reading other reviews I knew this recipe was in need of flavor so I used Mrs. Dash's Southwest Chipotle seasoning on my chicken.  I also added onion and cilantro to the beans, tomatoes, and corn.  Since this recipe has southwest flavor going on I put it on flour tortillas and sprinkled a little mexican cheese on top.  It was delicious!! My husband loved it and there were still left overs for the next day.  I know this recipe will be made frequently at our house.  Yum.

Definitely a little bland-could use some fresh cilantro and green chiles to spice it up.

A good quick and simple meal. I used a 7 oz. box of small shell pasta. I used triple the amount of pepper sauce & worchestshire added about 2 tsp. of catalina salad dressing and a sprinkle of garlic salt. Also used diced tomato with bell pepper. I think spanish style stewed tomatoes would give it more flavor. I served it with avocado.

Very quick and tastey recipe!  I took the advice of one of the reviewers and added green peppers to the ingredients.  First, I sauteed garlic and onion, added diced green pepper, and then proceeded on with the rest of the recipe as written above.  In addition to the stewed tomatoes, I also added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste to thicken the sauce mixture.

This is a good recipe with alterations. People are right when they say it's a little tasteless. But that's easily fixed. First of all, I used very sweet corn. I also added a bit of cumin and served it (without pasta) in tortillas with fresh salsa.

I made this with half the amount of noodles and twice the amount of corn (who doesn't love sweet corn from the summer).  It kind of came out as a chili.  When I tried it again with the correct amount of noodles, they took over the meal and took out some of the rich flavor.  Definitely try it with less noodles.

I really liked this recipe - it uses just a minor amount of meat and tastes like a gulosh without the potatoes. I carmalized some scallions and then cooked the chicken which added a nice flavor. Also - topping with a little cheddar cheese added to the flavor. I also mix in some italian dressing which gives a  nice flavor and makes for a really tasty cold pasta salad. My husband has high cholesterol and finding a recipe that will fill him up without being heavy on animal products and carbs is not easy. He LOVED this and even ate the leftovers!!!

We enjoyed this recipe but I added fresh cilantro and squeezed some lime in also. Those two additions made a big difference in flavor.

I've made this several times over the last few years, and it is a good, easy one-dish meal. It does make a LOT, I'd say at least 8 servings. I agree that it is need of some seasoning, so more than a dash of Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce, plus lots of salt an pepper. I recommend seasoning your chicken as you cook it on the grill or skillet with whatever sounds good to you. I made it once with plain boiled chicken, and it was not very good. I used an 8 oz can of corn in place of fresh corn most of the time. Adding cheese on top is definitely a plus. Overall, good recipe with nice components that make an easy, complete meal.

Just made this for dinner and it turned out pretty well, I did add a couple things. Used chili powder and cumin for more flavor, and also a small can of tomato sauce because I wanted it to have a more saucy consistency when I put it over the pasta. I did put some cheese on top as well. I think it will re-heat well and I got my 1 1/2 year old daughter to eat some too - she likes pasta so I try to find recipes where I can sneak some meat or veggies in with her pasta - it worked!

Ok. Not amazing, not horrible either. I'd definitively put less noodles next time and add an onion and some garlic to it, if there is a next time.

Good south western recipe! Chicken marinated in tomato juice + veggie mixture + salt & pepper turned out tender and good tasting. Used medium sized shells instead of jumbo. We both enjoyed, and would make again.

I did not have any chicken on hand when I made this, so it went without.  I used a can of tomatoes with jalapeños for an extra kick.  In addition to the listed ingredients, I added 1/2 cup of chopped red onion.  I also added a few more shakes of Texas Pete than just 1 dash.  I wasn't sure how this would taste with pasta, but I was pleasantly surprised!

As is, I have to give 3 stars because it was just too plain.  I added 1 c. sour cream and chili powder.  I left out the chicken by mistake and we didn't even need it.  My boys are requesting this again.

Made this tonight and have mixed feelings.  Everything but the pasta seems to work.  I'd probably try it with brown rice next time.  As others have mentioned, DEFINITELY season the chicken before cooking.  The broth and corn/beans were great.

Everyone who ate it liked it.  The only changes:  whole wheat pasta, stewed Mexican tomatoes instead of the plain diced...this also allowed us to omit the hot sauce, we season the chicken before grilling it.  Pretty simple and quick.

I found this on ingredient search after a long day.  I used thin fettucini; added garlic to black beans plus a can of rotelle, then leftover chicken.  Seemed a bit thin for sauce, so I had a cheese dip (soft cheddar) from Sams, added two spoonfulls to the pasta, then topped with bean mix.  Husband loved it.

Blah! This dish had no flavor! I used the leftovers (there was a lot leftover) the next day as a quesadilla filling. Even with sour cream and salsa, still pretty blah.

Quick and easy!  I added 1 cup chopped red onion and a little garlic powder.  I used angel hair pasta because that's what I had "on hand" and will definitely go with the sea shell pasta next time.  My hubby LOVED this and even had "seconds"!

Doubled the amount of Worchesthire sauce and the hot sauce. Seasoned the chicken when cooking and then added garlic salt and pepper to it.  Loved it and so did the whole family!

This meal is very quick and easy to make... It was good, but it could use a little more taste, but over all my family and I thought it was good for a quick dinner. :D

It's a decent, healthy recipe, but I found it a little bland. I steamed the chicken, and forgot to season it, which didn't help, but I still think this needs something to kick it up a bit.

This was actually to my surprise really good! i was a little apprehensive because of all the mixed reviews, but i tried it and my family loves it! I was looking for something different and healthy because im pregnant, i have a 2 year old (and if it isn't chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese he wont eat it) and my hubby is a US Marine so he tries to stay fit. My son could not stop eating it! he had two helpings! I changed it a little as i didn't use diced tomatoes (i didn't have any) i used regular tomato sauce and a little bit of chicken broth to water it down without losing flavor. I also used twice the amount of corn. The key is, YOU HAVE TO SEASON THE CHICKEN. if you don't season your food, its going to be bland no matter what it is! i just used a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. it came out great you should definately try this recipe!

This was a nice light and healthy dinner! wouldn't change much but I did use bow tie pasta instead of the shells and found that adding some fresh chopped cilantro really kicked up the flavor a bit.

I didn't really care for this recipe. I read all the reviews before making it and took the advice to spice it up a bit with some chilies and garlic. I didn't really like it over the pasta but we put the leftovers in tortillas, topped with a little cheese, sour cream and salsa and then it was really good.

It was very tasty, but I think it would have worked better with a smaller type of pasta such as angel-hair or linguini.  Thats what I'd use again next time I make it.  I also substituted 1 15 oz can of corn since I didn't have any fresh.  It worked well.

Sauteed the chicken with montreal spice, added onion and garlic to the bean mixture, added extra hot sauce and red pepper flakes, next time I will tone that down.  Served in flour tortillas the first night and then over rice the second, good both ways.

This was good! I also added a few things -- chopped green onions, garlic, some julienned yellow and red peppers, about 5 shakes of both hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Used frozen corn but fresh tomatoes and beans. Added about a cup of tomato juice. I let everything cook a little longer than listed because the juice made it a little soupy and I wanted it to cook down and blend a little. I expect it will be better tomorrow!

This is a great "base" recipe idea.  I've changed it up quite a bit, so I can't really say too much for the original recipe.  

I add bacon and chopped lettuce.  To some store-bought lite Ranch dressing, I add cumin and cilantro.  The whole thing is tossed together.  If being served cold, I'll also add cucumber and celery.  Served with tortilla chips, this has become one of our favorites!

Really enjoyed this dish.  I rubbed the chicken with fajita seasoning about an hour before cooking.  Then I cut it into cubes and browned in a skillet in olive oil.  Very yummy!  Will certainly make this again!

I should have listened to the other reviews and skipped this meal. Not much flavor and the texures were just odd.  We served it as a salad and used salsa as the dressing.  That made it just okay.  We will not make this again.

Not a great recipe.  Read the other reviews and added ingredients accordingly.  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil with four cloves of garlic and cumin, added two fresh chopped tomatoes in addition to what the recipe called for.  Used an extra 1/2 cup of corn.  There was too much pasta to fit the rest of the recipe, which is partially why it's so bland.  I also added a cup of fresh cilantro and lots more than just a dash of hot sauce.  This has obviously been prepared for young children.  We liked the flavors, but it was too blah.  A good start to creating your own meal.  But not a very good recipe.

Make it better by adding Knorr's Parma Rosa sauce and scallions or jalapenos.  ALso, chop fresh tomatoes rather than using canned.  My teenagers devour this.

This was really easy and good. No leftovers. I have made it before and wrapped it in tortillas too. Yummy.
