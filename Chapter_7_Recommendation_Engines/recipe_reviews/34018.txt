I made these for our tailgate Oct. 1 to have in the parking lot line. The only thing I changed was to reduce baking time to 10 min. I used my own recipe for Pumpkin Cream Cheese Icing to top them while a little warm. They were so wonderful! A person we feel obligated to take to games insisted she'd bring store-bought donuts so no one would have to eat mine if they weren't any good. Not one person, including herself, even opened the store-bought box! I also didn't have the problem as others that they didn't last long. I made 4 dozen, some to take and some to keep. The ones I kept at home were still moist up to the day they were finished off 6 days after baking. (The icing may have made that difference though.) My husband has aked for these every couple of days now! The only thing to remember is that these are cake doughnuts and are going to be a little heavy. However, sifting the flour does help if they turn out too heavy. Thanks for posting-these are a new breakfast staple in our house!

Phenominal! Away goes the so-so recipe that came with my doughnut pan. I get the cringes when I go to a well know shop where you can watch the doughnut floating along in an enormous tank of oil! This makes me feel a little better about such a sweet treat. I made a few modificatons as follows: Substitued maple syrup for honey, also I added a package of instant pistachio pudding in an attempt to make the one Dunkin Doughnuts used to make. It worked! And the pudding makes the batter a bit thicker. However they do rise a bit more so don't add quite as much batter to the pan. I am going to try chocolate pudding next, but the plain batter is good too!

These were great. They are so yummy. I just plopped them into 13x9 pans and baked them. They may not be like doughnuts but they are a wonderful treat, and really easy to make. Don't worry if you don't have buttermilk, I just added 1 TBSP of white vinegar to 1 CUP of milk and let it sit a while, mixed it well, and added one cup to the mixture to the wet ingredients. I also used syrup because I had no honey, and they came out perfect. I am serving mine with icing on them. You must try this!

These were excellent!  I doubled the recipe as some reviews I read said it would not make very many- that was not necessary!! It made 10 Dozen Donuts!  I have 4 pans, so it was really easy to make so many.  A suggestion- another thing people were saying the Donut Pans were hard to fill- and I agree- they were.  If you have a Spritz Cookie maker- that is the perfect tool to fill your Donut Pans with no mess and the perfect amount of batter!  In fact, if you don't have one- I would reccommend it, otherwise, the pans really are messy to fill. Fill them a little less than half!  My first batch looked like muffins, they rise quite a bit! I topped the Donuts with a Chocolate Icing- 1/4 cup milk, 1-2 tsp Vanilla and 2 cups confectionary sugar. Heat the items together and  keep warm and just drizzle over the donuts either in a circle on the top or a stripe pattern! If you add sprinkles- you have to do it right after you ice each donut before the icing hardens- that was a little bit of a pain in the neck- but if you have someone to help sprinkle them, that would make it easier!! The chocolate icing was very complementary to the Donuts!  They were the hit of the party!!

While these were good the name is deceptive.  These should be called muffins not doughnuts.  The batter was a muffin batter.  The final result was a muffin. I tried several shapes: animal shapes using animal for cookie sheet (filled about 3/4 full these were just as thick on the top side as they were on the pan side [double the depth of the mold]), mini muffins (these baked up the same as any other muffin recipe), and rounds on a regular cookie pan (these spread out an ended up like big flat muffins). I think this would work well as a muffin snack cake (just poured into a greased pan and baked at about 375 degrees until the top springs back when touched.  The first pan I put in got too dark on the pan side after about 10 min. at 400 d.  I reduced the temp. to 375 d. for the rest of the batter.  From the recipe as it was I got 12 animal shapes, 24 mini muffins, and 6-8 4.5 inch flat muffin rounds.  My kids gobbled these up (they love muffins).

These are nothing like doughnuts, but we liked them just the same. We didn't even try to make them look like doughnuts. Just plopped them on a cookie sheet like cookies. We topped them with a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon. The next time we make them, I'd like to try using a mixture of whole wheat flour & white flour.

I brought these to work yesterday and they're already gone and I got excellent comments.  They're not over-sweet, the sweetness is just right.  I can see why people had problems with the batter if not using a doughnut pan but I had one so it was no problem for me.  I got almost 36 doughnuts but maybe my pan just had smaller wells.

These weren't very good. They're bland and light, but I guess if you're looking for something like that they would be okay. I would say they are coffee dunking doughnuts b/c that's all I would use them for. They don't have much flavor to eat by themselves.

Pretty good, tasted pretty much like actual fried donuts, they just took a while to make.

I tried these in my new donut pan and took a couple of the suggestions -- maple syrup instead of honey and use a cookie press to put them in the pan.  I also substituted yogurt for the butter to make them lower fat.  I don't know what they taste like with butter but they were light and fluffy with the yogurt.  I might add a little vanilla extract another time as the yogurt was plain.  Yummy nonetheless!

These are sooo yummy! I don't have a donut pan so I improvised with a mini muffin pan and made "donut holes!" They aren't too sweet which makes them the perfect thing for children and adults! I'm on a calorie counting diet thing.... i used egg substitue and splenda and made my own buttermilk with a tablespoon of lemon juice and non-fat milk... they turned out delicious! My family loved them!

The taste was great, however NOT the doughnut I was looking for.  It was a very loose, muffin-like batter that couldn't be shaped.  The taste was great, just not what I expected.

We used this in the Bella Cucina Donut Maker that my daughter received for her birthday and they came out perfectly (cooked for 80-90 seconds).  The recipes in the instruction booklet did not work at all so we were really glad to find this great recipe.  Yummy too!

These don't look or taste anything like donuts.  Don't believe all the great reviews.  I followed the directions but the batter was way too runny to be made into anything like donuts.   There was way too much spice.  Maybe a quick bread or muffin recipe, but not donuts.

Very good and easy recipe to follow.

I added 2 teaspoons of cardamom and another tablespoon of honey to my recipe. I also included the sugar in the wet mixture instead of the dry mixture when baking.

These go fantastic with a maple icing.

Switched out general purpose flour for gluten-free all purpose flour - equal exchange; 1 c. white sugar was switched out with Splenda - equal exchange and added two very ripe bananas to the mix.  Also just a pinch of salt to push the flavor. We LOVE them. Moist, keep great, and are perfectly great for our diet restrictions. Wow!

If you like 'cakey' cookies or muffin tops, you may like this recipe. They were not very doughnut like. Although... The people in my house liked them, and they were easy to make.

This was a good recipe, my whole family loved it! I added a cap full of vanilla and it was great. 12 minutes at 400 degrees is too much time though. Try 375 for 10 minutes. Add a little more sugar though, it is a little bland.

I agree with other reviews that these don't have the consistency of typical doughnuts. They more closely resemble muffins or cake in texture. That doesn't change the fact that they are scrumptious, though! Next time, I'm just going to bake them in a cake pan and forgo presenting them as doughnuts. This recipe will make a delicious spiced cake, with a little extra nutmeg and cloves.

This was quick, easy, and delicious!  No standing over a dangerous frying pan of oil, just pop in the oven and chow down when the timer goes off!  My 9-yr old talked me into making a chocolate frosting (powdered sugar, chocolate powder, milk) as his favorite at the donut shop is chocolate frosted.  He came back for more without the frosting!

These are really glorified muffin's shaped like doughnuts, well that is if you can actually shape them. Mine were too runny to shape and ended up becoming basically muffin tops. They were decent but not what the recipe describes. Try your luck, obviously others have succeeded but as for me I'm moving along.

I thought they were exellent.  I made one change however, instead of using buttermilk, I decided to use regular (the only kind in the house).  They still tasted wonderful but turned out more like a soft cookie instead of a doughnut not to mention they are lower in fat.  With this is turns out as a lowfat sweet treat.  I give this an A+ rating!

My 12 yo DD and her book club friends made these today.  They were a hit!  Light, fluffy, and so yummy right out of the oven.  I made the following changes:  subbed lemon juice with plain rice milk for the buttermilk and Earth Balance for the butter.  Also, they frosted them in a dark chocolate frosting.  We will certainly make these again.

I'm so excited I can make homemade donuts for my boys! My plan was to add variously pie fillings to the batter but I decided to stick to the original recipe exactly the first time around and then experiment from there....they turned out perfect! Not too liquidy to shape like some reviewers said. After baking them I shook them up in a bag with sugar, powdered sugar, and cinnamon then drizzled half with honey and half with maple syrup. Letting them cool and I'll have these over the next week to serve for breakfast!

I made these last night and they were fabulous! I made half of the recipe and made 13 doughnuts. You definitely need to only fill the doughnut wells half-way. They were wonderful just out of the oven but I glazed them and sprinkled the tops with a cinnamon-sugar mixture. My family thought they were "delightful"!

These were great!  They reminded me a spiced cake, almost a carrot cake like taste minus the carrots.  I've made them several times, and the last time I topped it off with a cream cheese icing.  I've brought them to several different events, and have been asked for the recipe each time.  They were delicious!  I also made them gluten free for my son and uncle and followed the recipe just substituting our favorite gluten free baking mix for the flour, and they turned out great too, which is no easy task when trying to transform something into GF!

Came out very good. Made 16 of them. No doughnut pan, thought, just a cookie sheet, so I knew they were going to come out a little flat and not doughnut like. They baked for 9-10 minutes. I did not use ground cloves - I put in  1 tsp. of allspice instead. Spice in the doughnut was perfect. Not too sugary. I recommend it. ESPESCIALLY if you actually have a doughnut pan to make these ;)

I just tried this Baked Doughnut recipe by Sal; it's better than the recipe that came with the doughnut pan! I used canola oil spray, and the product turned out the moment I tipped the pan. The doughnuts are plump and golden and firm. Yum! Spiced doughnuts for breakfast! bts

I tweaked with this a bit to make it them vegan and I subbed honey & maple syrup for the sugar. They tasted great. I just baked them a bit longer and voila!! Thanks for the healthier version!

Batter is too thin unless you're using doughnut forms instead of cookie sheets. Oven temperature is too high - I backed it off to 350° and also reduced the baking time by about four or five minutes. Texture is good and flavor is good - I also added a vanilla glaze.

These were really good.  Not at all like a fried doughnut, but still tasty!  Wish I had a donut baking pan, because mine were odd shaped and pooled together.  Once I had started this recipe, I realized I was missing an egg, so I used half of a banana (mashed) that was mixed with 1/2 a tsp of baking powder (thanks to AR's subs list).  This enhanced the flavor of the doughnuts too!  For a chocolate glaze, I used another reviewers advice and heated/mixed 1/4 cup milk, 1-2 tsp Vanilla, 3T of cocoa powder, & 2 cups confectionary sugar. Then, I drizzled over the doughnuts.  The chocolatey sweetness of the glaze complimented the spiced doughnut well, since the doughnut is not too sweet.

Don't know what I did wrong. I formed the doughnuts by dropping batter in a donut shape onto a greased cookie sheet. THey flattened out and formed a shallow cake with 12 lumps. The taste was wonderful and we enjoyed the warm "cake" with apple cider. I Will definitely try again. Maybe I'll buy a donut pan.

These turned out very well for me. I used vanilla soymilk instead of buttermilk, vegan butter (actually Smart Balance Light), and egg substitute. I also used a muffin tin because I don't have a donut pan. I halved the recipes and filled all 12 tins to make small muffin like donuts. The spices were great in the donuts. I also added a glaze made of vanilla, powdered sugar, and soymilk, which made them even more donut like. I brought them into work today and they were all gone within a couple of hours. Thanks for the recipe.

I made only 2 changes here. I used no nutmeg because I don't like it, and I substituted Splenda Brown Sugar (same amt as the sugar in the recipe) to make it more diabetic friendly. Wonderful results!

Dense? These guys? Not mine! The only thing I did different was use vegetable oil in place of melted butter. Didn't even sift the flour like someone stated. I have a mini muffin tin so they came out just perfect!

I just made a bunch for a fundraiser.  I used mini-doughnut pans, so I had to shorten the baking time down to 5 minutes.  They turned out very cute.  They were not too sweet, which I like, and I iced with pink icing and multi-colored sprinkles.  That added just enough sweetness for potential customers.

These were good, they tasted like a pumpkin spice doughnut. I wanted to make doughnuts but I didn't want to fry them. I don't have a doughnut pan so I used a cookie sheet and they spread out like and became these giant cake like cookie. Maybe with a doughnut pan they won't spread out as much. Next time I will omit the spices so it will be a plain cake doughnut with vanilla glaze. Also I scaled down to 4 servings and it still made 7 giant cakes

These are definitely more like muffins, also called for way too much nutmeg. Wouldn't be too bad as a coffee side, but not too great other than that.

I REALLY did not like these.  I tried to make the recipe verbatim first and the dough was so sticky I couldn't shape it at all.  After that, I added more flour (I don't know how much cos I just kept adding until it was stiffer) and shaped into rings.  When they baked they rose a LOT!  I wound up with "chicken butts" and I had made pretty good sized holes in the middle of the doughnuts.  They were also quite heavy and, due to the rising, quite large.  I didn't like these at all.

I found that this recipe didn't have enough flour to make the dough maliable enough to make doughnut shapes from. I had to add more flour, and they became too heavy. The taste, however is terrific, and adding a maple glaze helps.

Nothing like donuts, I understand they are baked. but ive had better baked donuts that actually taste like donuts. These look good when I dipped them in melted chocolate and drizzled with carmel, but they were hard after an hour. I even shared the recipie with a friend who made them with no topping, and they were hard after one hour.

These are very tasty.  Only problem was that my doughnut pans cooked the bottoms faster than the tops - I flipped the doughnuts over after 5 minutes to get them evenly brown.  We did think they were best the first day.  None made it past the second day.  We frosted some and sprinkled powdered sugar on the rest.  Good both ways.

I really don't know why the complaints about them not tasting like 'donuts' and how they taste more like a muffin. I'm making the assumption that they were expecting a yeast donut taste. Well...these are CAKE donuts...you know...like the frosted sugar cake ones that you can buy. If you'll notice, there is NO YEAST! That being the case, I don't know why anyone would expect them to taste like a yeast donut.

Good except for:::
Doesn't hold "doughnut" shape well AT ALL. I spooned out the batter (which I had to add 1 c. more flour into...) and it still spread over the span of the 3 mins it took me to spoon out all the batter - which was a lot, not a bad thing - and me putting into the oven. I subbed maple syrup vs honey as someone else suggested. Cut nutmeg in half , next time I won't use any, didn't have cloves either. Topped with a pinch of cinnamon & sugar along with cream cheese frosting. YUM!! I like this recipe especially because they're baked over fried

Tried this recipe and the batter was way too runny to shape into anything.  I baked only two on a baking sheet and they were flat, so I decided to put the rest of the batter in a glass square baking dish and bake as a single layer cake.  The texture and taste is that of a spice cake.  I'll try to make them again, only this time I'll use a muffin pan.  Not what I expected because the batter doesn't allow you to shape them into a donut shape.

These were interesting--they seemed more like a spice quick-bread than a donut, but my four and seven-year-old loved them. I think the frosting helped. I used half wheat flour to ease my guilt of feeding donuts to the kids for breakfast! I don't have a donut pan and found after making the first batch as cake-like cookies on a cookie sheet that they actually baked nicely as muffins in a tin!

Wouldn't call these doughnuts by any means, granted I didn't have or use a doughnut pan, they still came out too heavy and dense to be a true doughnut.  Still yummy and could be a nice addition to berries and whipped cream or frozen yogurt.

I'm searching for the right recipe to use for my Bella Cucina electric mini doughnut maker - this is the best I've found so far (the one with flaxseed also isn't bad). These cake doughnuts aren't very sweet, so they can take glazes or cinnamon sugar toppings. They taste healthier than they really are, though.

If you don't have a donut pan to make these with then you will need one. These are great donuts when they are made correctly (with the pan) and eaten fresh from the oven. I think the previous comments about the rubbery texture were probabaly because they do get flat the longer you let them sit so, this is not a recipe to make now for an event later in the day. 
Otherwise, I thought the flavor of the donut itself was just right and a little sprinkle of powdered sugar on top is all they really needed.

I made these in a doughnut pan and used a quart sized baggy ( sprayed inside with Pam ) with the corner cut to put the batter into the pan.  This recipe is very easy to make even for teens learning to cook.

they tasted like spiced muffins...not donuts. i baked them for less time  and a lower temp. (10 minutes versus 12 minutes at 375 degrees) then the recipe called for and they were still to dry. i coated some with cinnamon/sugar, some with powdered sugar and some with glaze. the cinnamon/sugar in my opinion were the best tasting..but still muffins not donuts none the less.

Good, but a little too much spice for my taste. Very thick and heavy like cake doughnuts. I think they could use just a little more moisture. This is an easy to work with, versatile recipe. Adding cocoa powder and/or chocolate chips is good, and making different glazes (chocolate, maple, maybe blueberry, strawberry, or cherry) makes it more exciting.

I made these based on the instructions that said a cookie sheet would work (I don't have a donut pan) and the first few reviews, which were all positive. I wish I had read more reviews because I too found these (a) not at all donuts; (b) nearly flavorless. They smell wonderful but they taste bland and are not very sweet. Because the batter was so thin, I ended up making muffins -- makes about 16 of them. My kids at them after I added some Cinnamon Bun Icing from this site.

I was disappointed with these.  The only change I made was to add 1 T of white vinegar to regular milk in place of the buttermilk.  Although the taste of the nutmeg came through pretty strong, I still found these to be bland.  After taking them out of the oven, I topped half with cinnamon and sugar and half with a chocolate glaze.  Overall, they were just ok-- nothing special.  Maybe the buttermilk makes all the difference?

This turned out exactly like spice cake. I won't rate it badly because I still enjoyed the cake (I had made a maple icing from a maple cookie recipe here to make maple bars). But this was too much like dessert to be a breakfast item for my taste! Still delish.

When I first started making these doughnuts i had the thought in my mind that they were going to be rather flavorless, but i was wrong.  I do admit that they seem more like muffins than doughnuts but they have a good  mixture of spices.  And at the time i didn't have buttermilk so i used 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and then added enough milk to make one cup.  that substitute worked out just fine.

As other reviewers said, these are muffins not doughnuts.  I ended up using the batter in muffin tins and topped with a cinnamon streusel.  3 stars for the muffins, 0 for the doughnuts.

Pretty good. Loved the spices and texture was okay, needed more moisture. That was my fault though, of course. Didn't have a doughnut pan so i just made muffins which were tasty. Overall, good recipe.

My granddaughters were over for a sleepover so we made these for Opa for breakfast. I did bake them at 375 for 12 mins an that worked perfectly. The only thing I changed was we are not big nutmeg fans so I cut that down to 1/4 tsp. Worked very well for us.

My kids loved these! I used sour milk instead of buttermilk and pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg (didn't have any) I also iced them using powdered sugar, half n half, and a drop of almond extract. Super easy and delicious.

Excellent. Used apple pie spice blend, and butter instead of shortening.  Finished with a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar.  Turned out perfect first time.  Recipe made a dozen.

They are more like muffin tops than doughnuts. Still tasty and fun to put frosting and sprinkles on.

Donuts came out great. They are a little heavy. Still working on adjusting recipe and cut bake time according to my donut pans. All in all was a really good recipe.

Subbed All Spice for clove, worked great. 

I don't have a "doughnut pan" but tried to make these on a baking sheet... more like a scone with a divot, but still tasty!

I don't know if it was just the flour I used, Better Batter Gluten Free, or if it was the actual recipe, but my doughnuts did not turn out the way I wanted them to.  The flavor was fine, but the consistency of the dough was dense and sticky.

I dropped these on a cookie sheet and made jumbo cookie/muffins. They are definitely not the traditional donut - I wouldn't name them donut - more of a cookie or muffin. I subbed Greek yogurt instead of buttermilk, so I also had to lower the temp and alter the cook time. The spice flavor is delicious. It is especially good with a fruit compote - I make pear, and hubby cuts his open and puts the pear on so it soaks up all the juices.

This is a good spice doughnut like others said it is muffin like I subbed yogurt for the milk so my batter was thick but still muffin consistency. They are a good fall doughnut that work well with maple frosting. My kids didn't like them because they aren't a plain flavor but for grown ups is make them again. I had no problems with them and they baked perfectly in 10 min. I  got 3 dozen from the recipe.

This recipe was a really good experience for me because I haven't made any donuts before! I gave it four stars because it was nice and fluffy with a golden brown color just like the recipe said it would be. I would have given it five, if it wasn't for the burnt bottom. I put them in for twelve minutes and they had a burnt bottom. Ten minutes works great! I also didn't have much of a flavor except for nutmeg. It would have been great if there would have been something to make it taste not so much like a nutmeg doughnut. Overall, I think this was a great recipe! Thank you so much!

I'm not sure if I did it wrong cause my dough was cakey- and didn't form holes properly; but it was delicious.

Made non-fried donuts before so tried this recipe.  NOT a donut, not even remotely close. This is a spiced muffin.

Very mild flavor, but the texture was decent, i.e., not too heavy.  Overall, nothing to rave about.  Will have to find another recipe for our donut maker.

I think this is really more like a spice cake, but it tastes okay but it is a little bit bland.

Made two batches of these. First one according to the recipe and when I tasted it, I realized I didn't like nutmeg so I tried eliminating the taste by adding some chocolate chips into the second batch - got finished first!

These are a very heavy doughnut. I have a doughnut pan that I used and ended up making about 30, but the dough was not easy to work with. The kids liked them.
