Very good and flavorful marinade.  Easy and simple to make.  But be careful when grilling...there's no fat in this so the meat can dry out quickly and the yogurt tends to burn easily.  But take it slow and this one works great.  A new stand-by.

Very good! The flavor was great and really present throughout the meat. I did let it marinate for a few hours. I will use this recipe again, thank you. :)

Really good. I baked it instead of grilled (30 minutes at 350 F). I also added some garlic powder. Wonderful over Herb-Butter Pasta!

Excellent recipe...easy to make and family loved it!  I did not have any yogurt at home so I made it with mayo instead.  DELICIOUS!

I love this recipe.  Very flavorful and healthy. I use a heavy hand with the ingredients for 3 large (skinless, boneless) chicken breasts and broil for about 5 minutes per side.  I only flatten the chicken a bit with my hands.  Fresh cilantro is a must.  I marinate all afternoon.

Awesome recipe! I used mayo inplace of yogurt, I also used ground ancho pepper and crushed red pepper inplace of the chipotle and it was wonderful...the whole family raved over this!

We loved this. I left out the cilantro (not a fan) and used cayenne instead of the pepper. I marinated for about two hours then cooked on the grill. Super!

Snaps for Dannon! I really like this recipe. I actually marinated it for a day and a half because we went out to eat the night I was suppose to grill it. It was so juicy and flavorful through the whole piece of chicken. I would so make this again, I liked all the ingredients and the final product, Thanks.

As written, this recipe says to let stand for an hour. I think it needs much more time in the marinade because after only an hour our chicken didn't really taste like I had done much of anything to it. Also, I had a hard time keeping chicken from burning on my Foreman grill, so this is something I think really needs to be done low and slow. I know I will not make this recipe again as written; I will have to make some adjustments if I do. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I actually did use ground Chipotle Pepper... so maybe subbing that and a longer marinade is why they liked theirs more.

Wasn't too bad. I used sour cream instead of yogurt. Added tsp of Adobo seasoning, and I baked it as suggested at 350 for 30 minutes.

Extemely moist and flavorful chicken. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I substituted crushed red pepper.

Super moist, and really quick/easy to throw together!  I used all chipotle chili powder instead of the chili powder and the ground chipotle pepper (we love the smoky heat of chipotle chili powder).  I switched the cilantro and used parsley as we are not fans at all of cilantro.  I also baked instead of grilling due to a cold and snowy night!  Had mine marinading for several hours, although I am sure it would have been just as great for just the hour!  Very yummy, look forward to trying it on the BBQ!

My family loved this recipe, my husband kept talking about it the next day and how he wanted to make sure we had it on to our vacation menu.  I marinated the chicken pretty much all day, because we left the house in the morning in our RV and BBQ it on the grill that night, at our camp site.  I was in a hurry and couldn't find the chili either, but it worked out good because my 7 year old would have said it was too hot (spicy)!

This recipe kept the chicken moist and was very flavorful.  We've made it a few times and used whatever spices were in the cabinet.  It is always a hit, even with the kids!

My husband and I rarely eat meat, so it's great to have such a delicious recipe for when we do!  I did tweak the recipe a bit to infuse the most flavor possible and make sure each piece was completely submerged in the marinade.  I too skipped the chipotle, and used 16oz of yogurt, added 3 cloves of minced garlic, the juice of two whole limes, some kosher salt, tripled the cilantro, and doubled everything else.  I also marinated in a big ziploc bag for about 7 hours and cooked it on the top rack of the grill (so as not to burn the yogurt), with plenty of no-stick spray. It was so flavorful - I will definitely make this again.

Gave this 4 stars because I didn't have cilantro!!! Otherwise, would've given this a 5! I used Greek yogurt because that's what I had...so tender and juicy. Loved the flavors! Def a chicken recipe keeper...kids loved it too :)
