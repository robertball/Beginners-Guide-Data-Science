Great as a main dish or as a dessert.  FYI, 3.5 lbs is about 10 standard peaches.  This recipe is kind to over-ripe or bruised ones, too.  I used 2 1/2 C skim milk, adding this gradually to the food processor as I processed the peaches and ginger.  This made the process easier, fluffed up the mixture, and added the right amount of liquid with far less calories than heavy cream.   I also used 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh ginger.  A little cinnamon on top might also taste good.

I left out the rum because I didn't have any on hand.  It was great without it; really unusual and refreshing.  I used fresh ginger, which is great for digestion.  To remove the peach skins, immerse in boiling water for a few seconds and then in ice water for a few more; the skins come right off.  My guest and I loved it for the simplicity, healthful ingredients, and unique flavor.

I first tasted peach soup on a Holland America Cruise and the chef kindly gave me the recipe.  Unfortunately it made enough for 60 people and I have had some trouble breaking it down.  This recipe is similar except the HA recipe uses white wine, which is a little lighter I think.

I used fresh ginger but it still just tasted like peaches pureed with cream.  I doubt I will be making this again but if I do i will add more ginger and maybe some other things.  I prefer peaches with whipped cream on top.

This was a strange recipe but I tried it because I love ginger and peaches.  I almost wanted to freeze it because it seemed more like a dessert than a soup, but it wasn't sweet enough to do that.  It tasted OK.  If I made it again I would use fresh ginger.  Blanching the peaches worked very well for getting the skins off.
