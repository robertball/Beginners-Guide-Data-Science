VERY FAST!  VERY EASY!  The first time I made it with canned peaches and I agree - omit most of the sugar.  I added the cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg too.  It was wonderful!  The second time I used fresh peaches and it needed the sugar.  I keep the little 9 ounce cake mixes in the pantry just for this recipe but I have doubled it and used a whole cake mix (in a much larger pot) and it turned out great!  I have used several different fruits, altering the spices to match the fruit (apple pie spice with apples, etc.) and they have all turned out very well.  I made it once with chocolate cake and strawberries and served it with whipped cream on top - YUMMY!  This is an awesome and very versatile recipe!  I made it today for some unexpected guests, a single mother with three kids, and she was impressed with how fast and easy it was.  When she tasted it she made me give her the copy of the recipe I had printed out on the spot and took it with her!

I admit, I was a little skeptical to try this recipe after reading the one "bad" review on the first page.  I decided to give it a shot anyways, and boy am I glad I did!  I only used about 1/2 cup of cake mix (which turned out to be perfect), I omitted the sugar (I used canned peaches), and I melted the butter before drizzling it over the top.  The result was anything BUT dry...(which is what I was most worried about per the bad review).  We ate it with homemade whipped cream and some vanilla ice cream...perfect!

Great recipe when the peaches are ripe and the weather's hot so you don't want to use the oven!  Beware!  9 oz. of cake mix is 1/2 the standard box usually sold.  I almost made the mistake of adding the whole box.  I used fresh peaches, added 1/2 cup fresh orange juice and sprinkled it with only 2 Tbs. sugar.  Next I'll add some blueberries.  Can't wait to try it with apples when they're ripe this fall!  Very yummy!

An excellent idea that worked out perfect for cooking on a camp stove while camping.  I agree with another member, if using canned peaches in heavy syrup omit the sugar as there is plenty in the cake mix to go around and balance the flavor.  Also, I halved the amount of cinnamon called for and added about a 1/4 Tsp. of nutmeg and found that to be enough flavoring without overpowering the taste of the peaches.  One more note, the famous cornbread people (you know the one in the small blue box) makes a cake mix also that comes in the right size so that you don't have to worry about halving a standard-sized box of cake mix.  Overall, the family loved this recipe!   It is definitely going into our permanent cooking file.  Thank you for sharing this easy recipe with us.

So easy, my 14 year old son made this.  Fantastic, fast and no baking!  If you use peaches in heavy syrup, omit the sugar unless you have a big sweet tooth.  The cinnamon seems a little much, but could be he did not "sprinkle" but dumped in only a few places.  Overall great recipe!

Delicious, super economical recipe.  Doesn't taste exactly like a cobbler, but it's yummy anyway.  I've made if w/3 different fruits--peaches, cherries & apples--& all were hits w/my family.  I made it exactly like the recipe calls for the first time & it was a little too sweet for us.  The next time I left out the sugar & cut WAY back on the cake mix that I put on top.  Used about 1/8 of the box, instead of 1/2.  Also, I melted the butter before drizzling over the cake mix & it seemed to work out better.  When I made it the next 2 times, I used canned cherry & apple pie fillings, & again omitted the extra sugar.  I time it so that the dessert is cooking on the stovetop while we're eating supper & when we're done, we have a freshly made, deliciously warm dessert ready for us.  Great recipe!

I enjoyed testing this recipe for an upcoming camping trip but felt a few changes were in order.  I chose peaches in heavy syrup and cut the slices in half.  I also used vanilla cake mix over yellow because something about vanilla ice cream with cobbler that I love.  Peach, cinnamon, and vanilla.  Since we won't be able have ice cream I thought this was the way to do it.  I wasn't disappointed.  I also used butter over margarine because I don't like the flavor of margarine.  I used 1.5 times the recipe for my large cast iron skillet (buttered well to prevent sticking) and made this recipe on my coleman stove.  My universal lid didn't fit very tightly but this still came out well.  I kept it on a med-high flame (my stove is old and finicky) for about 20 minutes, peeking after the first 10.  The consistency of the peaches was nice, some were even slightly caramelized toward the center of the skillet.  The topping was moist but did have some characteristing "crumbs" that made the dish look rather attractive for its simplicity.  Very, very sweet, but when you're camping you can afford the rich recipe.  Only 4 stars because, frankly, if I was spending a summer night at home I'd make fresh peach cobbler the old fashioned way.  That said I've done a lot of camp cooking and this is the best dessert I've had to date.  I can't wait to serve this to our group!

In spite of all the wonderful reviews for this recipe I must say it sucks! I have done it twice and both times came out dry and milly, I tried with different cake mixes and different canned fruit and still something uneatable came out, I was soooo looking forward to taste it since the smell is pretty good but it didnÂ´t came out right.

I was intrigued by the idea of "stove top  peach cobbler". I'm currently living on the coast of Sicily, and I don't think it's been below 90 yet this entire Summer, so any recipe that made a yummy "cobbler" without me having to turn on my oven was worth a try. I used blueberry pie filling with lemon cake mix. It's cooking now, that's why I've only given it one star...will update in a bit.  Update: This is a REALLY good, versatile, quick recipe! I left out the sugar since the pie filling was already sweet enough. I really like how the lemon cake mix sets off the sweetness of the blueberries, but I will definitely try other combinations too:D

I used a 15 oz can of peaches and less than half of a cake mix box. I did not add any sugar based on the reviews here, but did sprinkle some cinnamon and nutmeg. It came out pretty good. I think it worked out better that I only had the small can of peaches. Had I used the huge can or two small cans, I think I would've needed more cake mix. Also, I put the margarine evenly around the top, not in the middle as suggested.

It is sweet (without adding the sugar), but all of the sweetness basically comes from the cake mix. So, if you're not using a lot of cake mix or you want the cobbler to come out a little sweeter, add a tiny bit of sugar or serve with ice-cream.

I made this while camping.  It was pretty good for a quick "on the camp stove" recipe, but it was way too sweet.  Next time I will omit the sugar (doesn't need it with the peach syrup and the cake mix.)  Also, next time I might add a 15 oz can of peaches to the 29 oz can so there is more fruit.

We really liked it. Really.  I used brown sugar instead of white, because I like the hint of caramel with peaches (and apples too, but if I was using cherries I'd go with white).  It turned out splendidly.  Even my kid who doesn't think it's dessert unless it's chocolate thought it was delicious.  I am working on a way to make it for a cycling group of about forty-five under camping conditions, and I'll let you know how that turns out if I have any success.  To those who said it's too dry, check the size of your cake mix.  You need to use a single-layer size, not a double-layer. In my part of the country, Jiffy is about the only brand available in that size.

I love this recipe!! I originally planned to try it on a camping trip, but when the trip was canceled due to bad weather, I made it at home instead. Super easy and delicious! Tonight I tried it with strawberries instead (I used a combo of fresh strawberries and strawberry syrup) and once again, it was perfect! I didn't use a lot of sugar, just sprinkled a little on top of the fruit, and I halved both the fruit and cake mix each time. I will be making this over and over again!

NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS REGULAR OLD PEACH COBLER BAKED IN THE OVEN..  FOR CAMPING - MAYBE - MAKE THE CAKE ACC TO RECIPE ON BOX - PUT THE PEACHES AND THE JUICE IN AN 8 X 10 OR 12  DROP BY GOLLUPS THE CAKE MIS OVER THE PEACHES - SPRINKLE TITCH OF SUGAR CIN. AND NUTMED.. BAKE 350..UNTIL THE CAKE PART IS DONE!!  THIS IS COMFORT FOOD AT IT'S BEST - SERVED WITH ICE CREAM OR WHIP CREAM... GOOOOOD!!

This is a great versital recipe! Perfect for camping. I used canned apple pie filling, no sugar since already sweetened but did add apple pie spice. And I used about 1/3 of a regular sized box of french vanilla cake mix. I used the 4 T of butter, sliced them thin and spread out on top of cake mix. I didn't have any dry spots. And my flame went out and I didn't realize so I took the top off a few times and had to relight the fire and it still came out great! I do think it would be better with peaches or even blackberries, I didn't care for the flavor of the particular brand of pie filling I bought. I really don't see how this recipe could be bad, since I totally screwed it up and it still came out great!

BIG HIT!  So quick and easy. I used fresh peaches chopped. The scent of cinnamon wafting in the air, mouths watered in anticipation. Scooped into dessert dishes, topped with one scoop of real vanilla bean ice cream, a dollop of real whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top....rave reviews by guests. Note:Couldn't locate a 9oz box of yellow cake mix, so halved full box...will be using the other half real soon. Bon appetite!

We went camping for my birthday and took this recipe along because I thought it looked easy for my sons to make.  It was a chilly night and the warm cobbler was perfect.  Even my VERY picky 9 yr. old asked for seconds.  It's a great camper recipe.

Made it with canned cherry pie filling; skipped the sugar (figuring the pie filling already had plenty compared to canned peaches).   It was YUMMY.

I did this cobbler while camping, over a campfire.. And it was amazing! I did not measure out the 1/4 cup sugar perfectly, so it turned out real sweet, but it was such a good campfire treat!

I prepared this recipe over a campfire in April 2008, and it was a HUGE hit!  It is soooo easy!  And I believe the charm of cooking it over an open flame adds to the flavor enhancement!

OH MY GOSH!   This was an AWESOME recipe!!  Even my son who had no desire for peach cobbler thought it 'rocked'!!And I have a glass lid for my pan, so I could watch it cook.  Will try it with different fruit some time!

This is the best use for store-bought cake mix that I have ever seen! My husband loves it, the youth I work with love it, and it is a great luxury food on a cold camp-out (if you are bringing canned food along anyway.) I do sometimes have trouble with patches of dry cake mix left at the end of cooking, but I just mix them back into the rest of the goo and enjoy. Awesome with cream!

I made this because I didn't want to heat up the kitchen by turning on the oven. I used 6 fresh peaches and 1/2 cup water instead of the canned peaches. Not bad!

Yummy, fast, and easy!  Was a hit with my dbf and my dd.  I used pineapples in juice (and omitted the cinnamon) instead of canned peaches. I would probably reduce the sugar a TINY bit next time...maybe omit it all together if I used fruit in syrup, because it was really sweet.  I also used coconut cake mix since I didn't have yellow and it was still super yummy.  We served ours topped with a little milk to cut down on the sweetness and make it creamier. :-)  **ALSO make sure you only use 9 OZ of cake mix... which is about 1/2 of a normal size box!!!  Also you may want to use a wider saucepan, otherwise if you use a deeper pan, the cake mix on the top will probably stay dry.***

What a flop.  The cake never turned into dumplings.  Would not even attempt a second try.

No, it was too dry and crumbly. The cake mix didn't absolve the juices.

I have made it several times and it turned out perfectly every time. I did not add any sugar to canned peaches but I added blueberries. Very tasty.

This is my recipe from a LONG time ago! Thank you for the reviews. I suppose I should have been a little more explicit when I typed the recipe out. Use peaches in LIGHT syrup or natural juices or it will be TOO sweet! And I used Jiffy yellow cake mix. I'm not sure if it makes a difference or not, but I have Townscraft pots and pans. Those of you who are familiar will know that they work similar to a pressure cooker. Anyway, I think it's pretty darn good especially for the beginner! Thanks everyone!

Make sure you use good peaches.  I used Target brand peaches, which were kind of bitter, and it ruined the recipe.  After switching to Dole or Libby's (I forget which) in heavy syrup, the recipe was great (although as with many other commenters, I left out the additional sugar).  

The other thing I would point out is that my local grocery store had a 10 oz. bag of instant cobbler mix that might work even better than cake mix.  I bought some for my next camping trip, but I haven't tried it yet so can't comment on it.  Just thought I'd throw that out there.

I was very skeptical of this recipe. It just seemed too easy and quick for peach cobbler. Not the case. This is an amazing throw down dessert that I will continue making for years to come. Thank y'all and enjoy.

I liked this recipe. It was more like peach cake than dumpling but still good. I didn't use as much sugar after reading other reviews. I kinda sprinkled it on. LOL. Still yummy.

Easy and yummy! Remember to use half the box of cake mix. Recipe calls for 9 ounces. Most are 15. Did not use sugar. If you use fruit in heavy syrup you donât need extra sugar. Used cinnamon. I like reading the reviews because they usually help. Iâll be making this again! Get the ice cream!!!!

Didn't have access to an oven, so I thought I'd give this a try. I followed the advice to leave out the sugar and use a half cup of cake mix. I also chopped up the butter and put little pieces all around. It was perfect!

If you use canned peaches, listen to everyone else and leave the sugar out. Used only 1/2 the package of the cake mix and melted the butter before putting it on top. Added the cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg. Cooked exactly as said in recipe. Amazing! And so simple!! Thank you!!

Easy as a Dump Cake in the Dutch Oven with easier clean-up.  Nothing to change in this recipe.  But since it's only my husband and I, the measured amounts were cut in half.  It was a wonderful dessert on the mountain in the camper.  And I got to make it again at the end of our trip!

It was tasty but very mushy. I thought it woould be better cold, but it was hard.
