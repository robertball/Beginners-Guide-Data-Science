This is a very good recipe, my dogs like it very much.  I leave out the sugar to make it okay for diabetic dogs and they love it.  The dough is very sticky and I grease my hands a lot.  I roll the dough into balls and smash flat with palm of my hand for thin crispy cookies.  I dry cookies in oven overnight then heat oven in morning and turn off and dry again for long-lasting, crunchy cookies.  Great for gift to dog lovers.

I have a lab with horrible food allergies.  I decided to give this recipe a try.  I cut out the yeast and sugar, as I was not sure how they would affect him.  I also could not find the different kinds of flours so I used a gluten free flour as a substitute for both.  It is too soon to tell if he will have an allergic reaction to these, but he as well as my parent's dogs loved these treats.

This is a great recipe, thank you!  My dog is highly allergic to corn and it is hard to find cookies without corn in them.  With corn being such a common allergy for dogs, you would think it was easier to find food and treats made without it!  Thank you for the recipe.  My dog loves them.

Very excited to find this recipe! I have a pit mix with food allergies. He absolutely loves these and they agree with him. I also haven't heard any complaints from any of his friends either! The drool speaks for itself. Thanks for sharing!

One tip is I do definitely need to lightly grease up my palms with olive oil when rolling & hand pressing the balls.

I've been desperate to find a dog biscuit that won't aggravate my dog's skin allergies.  When I was at the store tonight I bought most of these ingredients, planning on creating a recipe.  Thank you for saving me that work!!!  UPDATE August 2014:  I've modified this recipe to remove the cheese, yeast, sugar, eggs and chicken broth (still had problems with allergies with those items).  I substituted about 2 cups of roasted sweet potatoes and increased the flax to 1 cup and brown rice flour to 2 cups.  If I add too much sweet potato, I just increase the flour and oats.  The dogs go nuts and camp out by the stove all night while the cookies are drying.  We live in east TX now, and I can can still store these for about 2 weeks in a ziploc bag with a little sachet of rice.  Good stuff!!

This was a big hit with my dog, and he's a picky eater! I will say that I used whole wheat flour as a substitute for the brown rice flour and the oat flour (I just didn't have those on hand). I also followed previous reviewers by baking for 30 mins and leaving them in the oven overnight to dry out. I am happy to have found a healthy alternative to store-bought treats, and help repel fleas at the same time.

These were really easy to make, and my dogs loved them! I did everything as written only I halved the recipe, used whole wheat flour instead of rice flour, and used peanut butter instead of sugar. Thanks!

This is a GREAT recipe! My dog has allergies and was getting a bad skin reaction to wheat. So this recipe was perfect for her, and she loves it! I would only change a few things. I left the sugar out and put two tablespoons of peanut butter instead; it worked, and my dog loves it. Here are another couple tips: Firstly, this dough won't work if you want to use cookie-cutters. If you do, you will need a LOT more flour. Not IN the dough, but ON it. I got it to work by putting a lot of flour on some wax paper and my hands, then getting a clump of dough and rubbing flour on both sides then pressing the dough flat between my hands, then pressing it flat on the table, making sure to cover sticky areas with flour and making sure to get it thin enough. Secondly, I would change the baking time to 30-35 minutes. Otherwise, it's a wonderful recipe! :)

My dog loves these--I've made them twice now, cutting the recipe in half because it makes a lot. 

Actually, if it weren't for the brewer's yeast, I'd like them too! They are quite tasty--but the yeast leaves a bitter aftertaste. It doesn't seem to bother the dog though. :)

Thank  you for this great recipe.  Sasha and Kayley get super excited when they see these treats.  We've also tried them with water instead of chicken broth and  molasses instead of sugar.  We made a batch with peanut butter instead of cheese.  All variations of this recipe so far have been a hit. We like to bake them in the evening and leave them in the oven overnight to harden.  Thanks again for the recipe and for introducing us to baking with oat and rice flours.

this is my 'go to' recipe.  i've made adjustments using flaxseed meal, brown rice flour, some raw oats, and some cooked.  my dogs recognize what i'm baking each time and start begging.  i roll the dough into balls and press with an oiled glass bottom.  there is no waste and they are a great size.  many thanks!

One dog loves these - the other not so much. So just not sure what to rate here. Look good, don't taste that bad (I tried one), and smell okay. Added a sprinkle of garlic on top of each - my dogs love garlic.
