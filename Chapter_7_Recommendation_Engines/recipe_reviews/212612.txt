Mmmm Good!  I've made this several times wsith a Texmati brand royal rice blend instead of potatoes and it is always delicious.  The rice adds a nice crunch.  Perfect meal (with a slight twist) for a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy.  The mustard add a great little punch of flavor.  One of my dad's favorites.

The pork chops turned out great and everyone thought I slaved over the gravy.  I've made this several times now and it always turns out really good.
