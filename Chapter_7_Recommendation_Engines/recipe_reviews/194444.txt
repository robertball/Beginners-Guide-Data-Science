Yum!!  This was excellent.  I used red onion thinly sliced and used the whole red romaine lettuce leaves on the plates and piled the salad on top of it for serving. Directions are a bit confusing on that anyways.  In the ingredient section it says to leave the leaves whole then in the directions says to toss the salad with the greens.  I don't think you would want the leaves whole if you are gonna toss them with the rest of the ingredients. I did not use frisee or watercress because I did not want to run to the store just for those 2 items.

This is tasty and easy to make in a pinch! A friend of mine also makes something similar with just the avocado, tomato, olive oil, cucumbers, and feta cheese.

This is absolutely delicious.  I served this alongside the Beer Lime Grilled Chicken and Mexican Rice.  It was the perfect compliment.  It was very refreshing.  When all of the salad was gone, people were still using the leftover liquid in the bottom on top of the chicken since it tasted so great!  The only thing I did differently was not use any of the greens that it called for.
