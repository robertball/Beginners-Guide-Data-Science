So easy and the office loved it. Everyone commented on the touch of almond flavoring, so be sure to include it. I will definitely make this again.

Easiest fudge I ever made!  Set up so fast that I didn't have time to decide on adding anything to it, so guess I will go make another batch! I am thinking of adding some Craisins.
