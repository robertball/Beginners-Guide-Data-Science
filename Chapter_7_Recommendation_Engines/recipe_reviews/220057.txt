This is like homemade Chef Boyardee! I found it a bit plain - if you saw the video, definitely spice it up as Chef John suggests. Even following his recommendations, it was still bland. I would also add a generous amount of frozen peas at the end of the cooking time, to help offse the blandness. The meat turned out great. Don't worry about the sauce being too watery - the pasta will suck it all in, and it will actually turn out a bit dry. I'll use less pasta next time.

This was really yummy! Super important to note that the actual recipe from Chef John's website calls for *prepared tomato sauce*, as in, the jar stuff...not plain tomato sauce from the can!

This was a very good recipe. Very tasty. The only time consuming part was cutting up the brisket into cubes. I will be making this one again.

I tried it in a slow cooker with the brisket whole.  It seems a bit watery at first.  I'm hoping it will thicken up.

Super yummy and really easy to make. It yielded a bit more sauce than I needed but I like extra sauce when I reheat pasta dishes. Great for a group. Makes a large amount.

Made this exactly as the recipe was written. It was okay, but definitely not worth the $14 the brisket cost.

Loved it!!  Savory and delicious!  Use a good tomato sauce and braise the meat real well so it carmelizes!
I used a crock pot or he slow cooking and that worked well !

I thought this was fabulous!! Good for a cool day when you can be home most of the afternoon as it is a little time consuming. Made the house smell good. I did appreciate the video and did add a little spice as suggested. I would make it again!

Reminds me of something my mother used to make while we were growing up! I love this dish and usually make it on a Saturday or Sunday when I can cook it for a long period of time!
