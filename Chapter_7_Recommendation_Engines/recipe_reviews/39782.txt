These turned out great. They were very easy to make, but next time i would only add about a tablespoon on chocolate morsels, beacause two is way too chocolatley in my opinion

I had hardly anything in the house to make a dessert for company last night. I did have the ingredients for this recipe though. I wanted to make the filling creamier so I combined 3 oz of cream cheese with 2 tablespoons of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla and put a spoonful of the mixture in with the milk chocolate chips. It turned out to be a very easy, very tasty dessert. I do not think 350 degrees is the right temperature to cook these at though... after 15 minutes at 350, the pastry had puffed hardly at all. I turned the oven up to 375 at that point and it did puff some, but I think I would have had a flakier result if the oven had been 375 from the beginning.

These are really easy to make and really wonderful if you are a chocolate lover (which we are).  People think you spent a lot of time to make them when you really didn't.

My high school aged son had to make pain au chocolat for his french class.  He announced this to me at 4:00 on a Sunday evening - the pastries were due the next morning.  Anyone who knows croissants knows that would have been a stretch.

These were excellent, and fairly easy to prepare.  My son did all the work, and the recipe was easy enough that he was able to create these beautifully.  They were the hit of the classroom - teacher and students alike were duly impressed.

A fun "must try" recipe.

This recipe is very easy and very rich. I might even suggest cutting the pastry into smaller squares because this dessert is a trifle decadent.

This recipe is quick, cheap, and good! I made it with chocolate the first time, and then I tried butterscotch. Mmm! Both were great.

I made this for a baby shower tea party and it was a hit - and insanely easy!  I made my version even simpler - I only used Hershey candy bar squares in the middle.  I also made smaller servings by cutting each pastry sheet into 12 pieces.  On the outside after brushing with egg I sprinkled sugar on top.

My brother especially enjoyed this recipe.  MUCH faster than all the folding etc. of making croissant dough from scratch!  Very good!

This is a great recipe!  Easy to make and so delicious.  Next time I will probably follow other reviews and cut back on the chocolate a bit to reduce the richness.

This was super easy and delicious!!!  I added coconut to some of them to add a different flavor.  They all turned out great and my family loved them.

Very easy recipe to make.  Looks and tastes great too.  However, it is very rich...I want to try making smaller squares next time.
