This is a very good easy and quick dinner to make. I didn't have baby corn so I just added a handful of frozen corn and it was just fine. My family thought this was a good dinner.

This made a great weeknight dinner. I left out the green onion and used 2 carrots. I didn't have any of the canned baby corn so I just used some canned whole kernel corn which worked out just fine. Loved the combo of veggies will make this again. Thanks.

It was a yummy healthy way to top off some whole wheat pasta. I didn't have red pepper so I added some celery instead. I also spiced it up a bit more. My 4 year old gave it a thumbs up!

I followed the recipe loosely so as to use up vegetables I had on hand and this dish is perfect for that! I used some mixed color peppers onions fresh mushrooms a handful of frozen green peas and skipped the garlic powder and dried parsley. Take some good pasta add vegetables of choice give it a sprinkle of grated Parmesan and it's always a winner in my book.

SO good! Even my picky husband woofed this down (and that's saying a lot!).:) Although nearly perfect as is I did make a few substitutions. I halved everything omitted the green bell pepper and mushrooms altogether and used almost an entire 15 oz. can of baby corn in their place (all I could find - my grocer only sells pickled baby corn in smaller jars). My choice of pasta was ditalini. A garnish of shaved Parmesan hit the spot. All I can say is WOW! I am so happy to have stumbled upon your recipe. Thanks ANGCHICK!:-)

My mother isn't a big veggie eater so I expected her to hate this but to my surprise she loved it. I made a few tweaks to it though. I thought that I had garlic powder but I didn't so I substituted the salt and garlic pepper for garlic salt which worked out fine. I also added a lot of garlic pepper sauce which added spice which the dish was missing beforehand. Another thing I added was broccoli it was interesting to me that was missing from this dish because it was great! If I make it again I will be sure to add more carrots!

Healthy, quick to make , and delicious. The 1/2 Cup of olive oil was just the right amount of  "sauce" to use with our 12 oz. box of gluten free penne pasta. I used fresh garlic and fresh vegetables I had on hand.  My husband said he really liked the broccoli in the pasta.

1/2 cup of oil is just way too much for my family. I started with just 2T and ended up adding about 1/2T more to make sure all the veggies cooked correctly. Otherwise a very nice easy flavorful dish. Added some leftover roast chicken and made it a meal.

Made this for supper. Flavor is good. Will not ever use spaghetti again too messy. For tomorrow's supper will cut pasta into pieces add chicken broth and make soup.

Great basic recipe that is easily customized. I used a fabulous brown rice elbow macaroni and used veggies that I had on hand from our crop share - yellow squash (peeled) eggplant (peeled) bell peppers leeks spinach and tomatoes sauteed in garlic. Mixed into the pasta and added parmesan cheese. My son had seconds and my husband made a point to tell me how good it was. No leftovers! Will double the pasta next time.

My husband and I can't stand baby corn but other than that and the shape of the pasta (no biggie) it was freaking delicious!!! Also added red pepper flakes. Not much of a difference from the original recipe. DELICIOUS!!!! Make it all the time for a ridiculously picky husband who adores it.
