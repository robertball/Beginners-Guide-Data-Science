This was one of the best oatmeal raisen cookies I have ever made.  My entire family loved them, especially my grandson.  They were already asking for me to make more before they finished what was in the cookie jar!

I cut this in half. Probably not the best recipe to cut in half because the dough was really loose. I ended up adding almost another whole cup of oatmeal and another 1/2 cup of flour. As is, this is a nice basic oatmeal cookie. The Kahlua adds a nice flavor. I think that the walnuts and white chocolate chips should be a must for this cookie instead of being optional. That would have really taken your average oatmeal-raisin cookie and made it extraordinary. NOTE: If you are baking this at 350*, 11 minutes is about right for a soft cookie. This makes more of a cake-y cookie, not necessarily chewy. Half a batch made 31 medium sized cookies.

Even though this recipe if a little time consuming, it's well worth the effort.  I made a batch for our Eagle's Auxillary bake sale and everyone that tasted them said they were the best cookie they had ever eaten.  Dolly from Indiana

Doesn't taste nearly as much like coffee as I would have guessed/hoped but still a QUALITY recipe.  I halved it (as such) but also lightened it up a bit.  I substituted light margarine for the shortening but would have also liked to have tried applesauce instead.  I used non-stick non-fat cookin spray instead of greasing the pans (which worked like a charm).  I switched half the brown sugar for an equal amount of Splenda cooking  sweetener. Also since I was halving the recipe and 3 eggs doesn't "halve" neatly, I just used a whole carton of egg substitute (which is the equivalent of 2 eggs).  With all those changes the cookies came out very flavorful and cake-like.  I do prefer chewey cookies but that's the price you pay for excluding the shortening. I included the walnuts but not the white chocolate. Making these changes yields a very tasty light cookie.  I did cook half on an air bake pan and half on a regular pan and the air bake ones turned out a little less than my liking but otherwise still tasty.

A little more trouble than conventional oatmeal cookies, but definately worth it.  Lots of stuff to be added by kids...they love that!

This recipe was wonderful!  I was looking
for an oatmeal cookie recipe that was different
and this was it.  You must remember to add the
raisins as they are forgotten in the 
directions. :)  I would not hesitate to 
use this excellent recipe again.  Great!

These cookies were great. I had a problem with them sticking to my cookie sheet but that was probably my fault. All the flavors worked very well together.

Didn't have coffee liqueur so just made up 1/2 cup of strong coffee and soaked the raisins in that.  Just had a handful of chocolate chips and added them too - moving, so getting rid of stuff in the pantry!   For some reason, I don't like "puffy" cookies, prefer them flat, so flattened the mounded teaspoons with a wet fork.  Halved the sugar (as I always do in recipes) as well.  Very nice, not overly sweet and will make again.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  Cookies were good, but couldn't detect the liqueur...  Cookies were very cake like, not chewy.   Recipe is good, but not stellar.  If I were to make it again, I'd substitute coffee (or liqueur) for some of the milk, and reduce the leavening agents (soda/powder) slightly.  Overall = Good.

Top notch recipe. I made these cookies following the recipe.  I let the raisins soak overnight after microwaving with kaylua. The Kahlua gives a very nice, but subtle flavor to the finished cookies. Recipe yielded 3 1/2 dozen cookies for me.  Will be making them many more times!
Stick to the baking times shown in the recipe and remember to let cookies cool on the baking sheets for a full five minutes before you transfer them to cooling racks. You will wind up with a winner!
