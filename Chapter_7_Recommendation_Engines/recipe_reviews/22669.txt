OH so yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I made my own crust rather than the bread idea. I used two small red onions; didn't use the olives. The combination of flavors was wonderful! Such a recipe to cherish - thanks oodles for sharing it with us!

I used spicy pork sausage, black olives, 1/4 of one onion sliced in half circles.  Added seeded chunks of Super red chile and yellow bell pepper from the garden--baked for 15 minutes on Valentino's crust (kneeded for 7-8 minutes).  Mouth-watering pizza.

I used pizza sauce for more flavor.  Also good on homemade or store bought crusts.

Really yummy-husband and I loved it!  I only used 1 onion (it was a huge one!), and I hollowed out the bread halves just a little so they wouldn't overflow with toppings.  Awesome!

The topping was a little bit sloppy, but it tasted really good. I omitted the olives because I don't like them, and I used a Vienna loaf sliced in half for the base. It really couldn't be easier. Great recipe, Eleanor! Thanks!

this was okay but next time i will add a few more toppings of my own and maybe personalize the pizzas by using the smaller hoagie type bun so the smaller children can hold it easier.

Great pizza!  First time making "pizza bread" and we really enjoyed it!  I served it with lemony ceasar salad from this site.  Perfect!

Quick, simple, yummy pizza.  I had 4 French bread rolls that I was wanted to use up.  I cut each one in 1/3's and used that rather than a loaf of French bread.  My family doesn't eat olives, so in place of those I used diced green peppers.  I followed all the other instructions as written.  This was a very quick meal to prepare as I had browned sausage in the freezer.  I think the key is to not skip the step of toasting the bread under the broiler before adding the toppings.  I paired this with 'Coleslaw with Grapes and Spinach' from AR and we had a meal that everyone enjoyed.

Added chopped fresh mushrooms to onion and garlic, otherwise made as written. It was great!
