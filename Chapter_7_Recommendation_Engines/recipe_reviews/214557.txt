This cookie was alright, I was wanting a little more of a raspberry flavor so next time I may add just a little more of the raspberry extract.  They came out a little gummy in texture and I am not sure if the milk has anything to do with it.  I split the dough and put semi sweet chocolate chips in one half and the other half I used white chocolate chips. I liked both equally.

Amazing! I made them with vanilla extract instead of raspberry extract since i didn't have any and they still turned out great. Some of the best cookies i have ever had!

This was a great cookie to try out. I work in a upscale restaurant and we once served a chocolate raspberry chocolate chip cookie and I never got to try it. This one was nice.

I will be trying this recipe! I am in a cookie mode and this sounds like a great alteration of the chip cookie.

Very nice light taste!  I didn't have extract so I blended up a small package of raspberries I had and added about a quarter of a package of cream cheese!  Wow!! The flavor is awesome!!!!

I made these cookies with white chocolate chips.  The raspberry taste was not that strong, and it was pretty artificial  Overall, though, they were decent cookies.

I made these for my german club and they devoured them. They are so delicious and addicting! The only thing I changed though was I didn't add the almond extract.
