Mmmm!!! This was great! I followed the suggestion of turning up the oven to 350 degrees, and I took it out after 50 minutes. It still looked very wet, and I was worried that it wouldn't be done, but it was perfect after it sat a few minutes. I also increased the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon - personal preference.

I think I found the trick to the sauce. Instead of just heating it until it was blended, I tried to get the sugar to dissolve so it would be clear. It never was clear, but it was a little bubbly. Then when I added the rum (didn't have whiskey), the sauce bubbled a lot. I think it burned off the alcohol, so it had a great rum flavor instead of too alcohol-y. It also got thicker as it cooled. Make sure you use great liquor - I used Appleton Estate V/X rum (highly recommended by reviewers of another recipe) that I bought especially for making a rum sauce. It was WONDERFUL! Half the sauce recipe unless you want to use it for something else. Also, since you add the rum at the end, start with half and add more if you like it.

Great Recipe! I did scale back the serving to half which made a 9x13 pan. I also cut back on the whiskey (way to much whiskey)and I added more cinnamon and nutmeg. I also added chopped pecans to my rum sauce. Next time I will add some drained, crushed pineapple to the bread.It does take longer than an hour to cook though. Thanks for the wonderful recipe and making me look like a pro chef! I will definitely make this again!
ps. I forgot to add that cooking this in a hot bath (a pan with hot water) will cook faster and more even. You will not be left with the gooey parts in spots.

Wonderful Recipe!! I was looking for a recipe similar to a bread pudding that I had at a fancy place in Monroe, LA. My husband and I both thought that this recipe was actually better. 

The sauce is wonderful! I did use rum rather than whiskey, though. I also cut the sauce recipe in half and it was more than enough. I poured the entire batch of sauce over the bread pudding when it first came out of the oven to let it soak into the pudding.

I used a loaf of white bread and left the crust on. I used a 9 x 11" glass pan and it did rise to about an inch above the top, but settled upon cooling to be almost level with the top of the pan. 

The only change that I made was that I increased the cooking temperature to 350 and I cooked it for 60 minutes. It came out very moist and was a wonderful texture. I'll be cooking this one next time I want to show off for a family gathering. Thanks for a great recipe!!

All Gone!  ;-)  A Winner!
I've had my eye on this recipe for awhile now and decided to make this last minute when I found out my Mother-in-Law made pumpkin pie for Christmas dessert. I had no intention to compete with her dessert, just that Hubby hates pumpkin pie.

*NOTE:> Made a half recipe in a loaf pan.*
I thought the recipe was a bit wet; I used very dry French bread and raised the oven temp like the others to 325 for at least 60 minutes. Threw in a half  of a Gala apple and some raisins; also added a little All Spice. The bread pudding fluffed up nice and not dry at all. Next time I make this, I'm going to try half & half and cut the liquid a little.

The sauce was lovely and smooth. Totally  FAB!
For the sauce, I used "1792" bourbon instead of whiskey.  When I finally tried it (at my Mother-in-Laws), I thought it needed more liquor and couldn't understand the other reviewers fuss about the sauce being kinda strong.  When I got home, I discovered I accidentally grabbed the 1/3 cup, instead of  the 1/2 cup measure. I'm going to make sure I use more next time, but a 1/3 cup was tasty and subtle for those who want a lighter flavor.

In the end, it was all gone; even my Mother-in-Law opted for my dessert over hers.  I was then delegated to make next years Christmas bread pudding and asked to think about making extra sauce offering a couple different flavors... some that come to mind.
Malibu Coconut Rum, Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum, Brandy and maybe Chambord? but cut the sugar.

I usually try a recipe first before making changes and trying to 'improve' on what I have yet to try in the first place. On this one I followed it to a tee. It came out excellent. Very rich - and yes, the whiskey was a bit strong, but the bite of it countered the sweetness of the bread pudding. I think it worked. There was a lot - was able to feed my husband and I, my brother, my parents, and still have enough left over for 2nds and 3rds. My only suggestion would be to 1/2 it.

This recipe is marvelous!  I used torn French Bread and oh, what a difference! Wonderful flavor! I added Allspice and doubled the Golden raisins.  Be careful, though, if you use rum instead of whiskey in the sauce. One-half cup of rum is way too much! Rum was all I had on hand

This is a very good bread pudding and I made it exactly as written.  I used bread I made using the Fabulous French Loaves recipe.  The texture was just right--moist but not runny, and a little crisp on the top and sides.  I loved the sauce and I think the sharpness of the whiskey provides a nice contrast to the sweetness of the bread pudding.  The sauce takes it from being a good bread pudding to being an excellent one.  Only thing of note was that I had to bake it for an hour before it was set.

Great recipe!  Eating it right now!  We followed the directions exactly but cooked for 1hr 20 minutes. Probably could have stood another 15 minutes.  We used 1/2 cup Southern Comfort in the sauce.  Outstanding!  Thanks for posting.

I get rave reviews with this recipe! The last 2 times I made this, I used a whole wheat cranberry walnut bread that I let get stale.  I added a medium peeled and finely diced apple and a some extra dried cranberries.  I put the bread in my large oval crock pot and pour the custard mixture over top a good 1/2 hour before baking. gently fold a few times to ensure the custard mixture coats ALL of the bread cubes! then add the cranberries and apple and cook on high for and hour, then down to low for 3-4 hours.  With the denser bread, it did take closer to 4, but i started early and left it on keep warm when it finished.  Used spiced rum for the sauce.  Love using my slow cooker for dessert so it's warm and ready after dinner and keeps my oven freed up!  In addition....just in case it isn't crazy rich enough, I found a great way to use the leftovers. I sliced the pudding with a sharp knife while it was cold and dipped in egg wash and made french toast the next morning for breakfast with the leftover syrup. It was ridiculously delicious and kept us full forever!!

I don't really care for most of the bread puddings out there. I only made this recipe because my father in-law loves bread pudding and he is notoriously hard to please. That being said....oh my gosh! I followed one reviewer's advice and heated the sugar mixture until the sugar dissolved and was near boiling (you must have a steel pot for this or a double boiler and stir constantly or it'll burn). I then took it off the heat and added the rum (he prefers rum) a bit at a time. At 3/8ths of a cup, the mixture turned a velvety caramel color. I stopped there and tasted it, and it BLEW MY SOCKS OFF!!! I can't say much for the bread pudding, but this sauce alone was enough to give it 5 stars.

Scaled this down to 8 servings, soaked the golden raisins in Jack Daniels over night before making, used dark corn syrup for the sauce (along with the aforementioned Jack Daniels. Omigosh....I won't change a thing....

This recipe is SINFUL! Just rereading the recipe made me crave some. I made this for our dessert on Christmas Day and we were all so full we hardly ate any of it. The sinful part is the fact that I personally ate the left overs myself within 4 days. I even had some for breakfast one day! I swore I would never make it again because of my lack of willpower, but for the same reason I know I will! A definite keeper in my recipe box.

I have been looking for this recipe for AGES! Thank you! This is one of my all time favorite recipes! So, to make it the way I prefer it, I added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans with the raisins. I also added another half stick of butter to the sauce, and cooked it for about five minutes after I added the bourbon to kill some of the alcohol burn. Amazing!

Something I really liked about this recipe is that you place the cubed bread directly into the final baking container before pouring the liquids on top.  This means I can cube up just enough bread to fill the container (in my case a 1.5 qt Pyrex.)
Now about the sauce...I eschew flowery language and I never resort to hyperbole so I'll just say that the whiskey sauce was the most  amazing, splendiferous, super-fantastic thing I have ever tasted in my entire life!

Oh my freaking lord, this is FANTASTIC! I did make some changes though: I didn't use raisins (don't like them) but used 3 peeled, sliced apples instead. Because of the extra moisture from them, I adjusted my liquids a little. I used 2 cups of whipping cream, and only about 1.5 cup of milk. I also used Apple Pie Spice instead of just cinnamon. For the sauce, I cut way back on the sugars! I think I used about 1/2 cup white sugar, and about 1/3 cup corn syrup. Any more would have been way too sweet I think. all in all, FANTASTIC recipe, and I will make it again and again!

This is the best dessert I have ever had! I had company over and everyone LOVED it. The next morning we made pancakes and used the whiskey sauce as syrup...yummmy!!! (But like the others I used less whiskey in the sauce about 1/4 a cup)

I didn't make the bread pudding portion of this recipe as I already had a bread pudding.  I only made the sauce as I was specifically looking for a whiskey sauce to use up what I had on hand.  I halved the recipe for the sauce but didn't take the recommendations to reduce the whiskey by half again.  I absolutely should have.  This sauce smelled like the worst drunk and tasted about as bad.  There was WAY TOO MUCH whiskey for the rest of the ingredients.  If making a full batch of the sauce, definitely reduce the whiskey by half.  The texture was OK.

I thought that the bread pudding itself was outstanding.  The taste was amazing. I then made the huge mistake of taking another reviewers advice and poured all the sauce over the pudding.  Uggh!  I almost gagged from how sickenly sweet it was.  It could have been because I took the advice of another reviewer who recommended burning the whiskey off instead of mixing it in like the recipe called for.  Big mistake.  There was no  whiskey flavor and all that was left was sugar.  I may use heavy cream next time instead of corn syrup.  I don't get the sugar and corn syrup mix, seems like that mixture would just be too sweet.  Anyway, the bread pudding itself is awesome, but the sauce needs some help.

This is an incredible recipe! The first few times I made it, I thought it was a bit heavy on the whiskey. Now I wouldn't make it any other way. I do use a little more bread than the recipe calls for, I usually use Texas Toast and use enough to soak up most of the liquid. It just makes it a little more dense. I always have gotten rave reviews on this either way.

This bread pudding was just about the best I have ever eaten. The whole 9 x 13 dish was gone in minutes! I did cook the whiskey off for about a half hour on low heat with the sugar/butter and corn syrup. This recipe is surely a keeper!

Awesome recipe! I have made this numerous times for my family and even get requests for it at work. I add a little lemon juice (1/4 cup) to the sauce after cooking off the alcohol. I have made the sauce both with whiskey and rum, depending what is on hand and either works out well. Thanks

Fantastic! Only adjustment I made was serving number, since it's just my husband and I. I recommend using Forty Creek whiskey, because it's got a nice vanilla tone to it. That's what we used and it's wonderful. :)

I have found some some really good recipes on this site...but this one, hands down, is my Favorite. I decided to make bread pudding for Thanksgiving instead of the usual pies. We moved from New Orleans and miss the great food there, bread pudding is one of their staples, so I have had my share of great bread pudding. And this just may be better than any I have had.  I made it the night before and put it in the fridge overnight so it would be cold (the only way I like it). Also, I was running low on cinnamon, I had about 3/4 a tbsp, so I added about 3/4 tsp nutmeg also. We made the sauce, which was perfect, right before dessert so it would be hot. The recipe didn't specify what type of corn syrup, so I used dark.  That's how I recommend bread pudding...cold with warm sauce.  Thanks So much for sharing, this recipe made Thanksgiving complete. I will make this Every single Thanksgiving, for ever probably! From now on, if we have a turkey, we have this bread pudding.

This was the first bread pudding I've every made. I've always been a bread pudding lover though! I made a double batch for the home and the office. Everyone loved it... so much so, that it was completely eaten!  The changes I'd make for the next time are: - Cut the bread the night before so it can be made "stale". I used french bread [as suggested by others] - Increase the whiskey. I found the sauce a bit sweet, but nothing that drizzling some whiskey over it before serving didn't fix! Perhaps adding the whiskey when the sauce was cooler would increase the 'alcohol' edge to reduce the sweetness. Of course, there's always cutting back the sugar... not.

Best bread pudding recipe ever, and the whiskey sauce was devine! We love it. I also suggest using a malibu run in place of the whiskey for a differant tropical twist. Very good. Five stars from my family!

This was GREAT! Very easy and extremely delicious!  I did make a few small changes - I used just a sprinkle of regular raisins instead of golden ones, I sprinkled a dash of allspice over the top before putting it in the oven, and I used Captain Morgan spiced rum instead of whiskey in the sauce. It was great with the rum!  I also needed to cook it for much longer than instructed.

I will be making this again!

The whiskey sauce was excellent and I DID take others advice and cut the whiskey amount a bit. Not sure by how much exactly but the whole amount called for would have been too much. For the bread pudding itself....weeeeelllll....it certainly needs to be cooked longer. I cooked it at least another 15 min and it was a bit slimy and STILL not ready. Other than that...good recipe as long as a few alterations are made.

This was delicious! My kids don't like raisins, so I peeled three apples and finely diced them and tossed them with the bread. For bread, I used leftover hamburger and hot dog buns. Milk is super expensive where I live, so I used powdered milk instead. It did have to cook longer than the recipe stated and I used eight eggs instead of six. I thought the whiskey sauce was great. I saved the rest for ice cream. Yummy!

this was an excellent recipe even though I couldn't follow it exactly.  I needed to use up some stale hamburger buns for the bread and I had no cream.  I used all whole milk instead and dotted the top with a little butter.  the proportion of eggs, dairy, and bread was perfect, moist but not soggy.  yummy.  and i used spiced rum instead of whiskey.  definitely a keeper.

This recipe was awesome with one exception.  When I make it next I will use less whiskey.  I found the whiskey overwhelming based on the recipe's measurement. It just about floored me, and I like cooking with alcohol. Way overboard.

Delicious! Used a raisin challah which was a perfect compliment. This took approx 1hr and 30 mins at 300. At the last minute, I realized I did not have whiskey so I used Creme Anglaise from this site.

i used canned peaches and 3 apples.  I cooked the apples a little on the stove before I added them to make sure they would be done.  As other cooks suggested, I only made 1/2 of the sauce and it was plenty.  My family loved the sauce so much - they were dipping their ham in it!  It's a new favorite and I'll be making it again.

This is a very wonderful dish. It came out of the oven looking dry, but once I added the whisky sauce it came alive!! I served it warm. All my guest raved over the creamyness of it. This would be a great dish to serve at any occassion or just a night at home with a cup of coffee.

This turned out delicious!  As others I increased the cooking temp to 325 and the time to 1 hr and 15 minutes.  I added to the recipe a 1/2 cup of nuts (walnuts this time, will try pecans another time) and a 1/4 cup of rum to the custard mix so the bread would have the rum taste baked in as well as pouring the rum sauce over the pudding. I chose rum as it is sweeter in taste and goes well with the pudding. I also served it with a bit of whipped cream to top it off.

I've been making a version of this recipe for years. This recipe is good all-be-it a little too sweet I thought. The best bread pudding is made with stale homemade bread if you prefer a less gooey pudding. Baking it in a water bath is a must! It's also good cold. Hubby ate it the next day cold with maple walnut ice cream and milk on top.

I used Hawaiian rolls (all the bread I had on hand); I copied another reviewer and used amaretto instead of whiskey and it was really very good; I do, however, only give 4 stars because the 1 1/2 cups sugar in the pudding is too too much.  Next time, I'll cut back to a heaping cup.  The sauce is sweet enough on its own that it would compensate for the 'lost' sugar.

My family couldn't get enough of this at Thanksgiving!  I used a 16 oz loaf of french bread and instead of whiskey I used Rum and it was the best bread pudding I have ever had.  I did have to bake it longer than stated but that wasn't a big deal to me.  I will be making this again for Christmas.

What just puts this recipe over the top is the whiskey sauce that you put on top.  I could just have a cup of that!  Easy recipe.  I make it with all my old french bread.

Yummy! I halved the recipe and made some minor adjustment since I didn't have raisins and white sugar available. I used blueberry jam and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it came out perfect! Not too sweet, just right. Also, I used French bread which helped to soak up the custard mixture nicely. The crusts helped give the bread pudding a nice crunchy texture. I didn't make the whiskey sauce but for garnish, I just sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. Yum! Thanks for sharing the recipe! I plan to experiment with it more by adding pineapple, apples and blueberries next time!

We all love bread pudding. This was the first time I tried it with whiskey sauce. I cut way back on the whiskey because we had small children with us and it was really good. But, I WILL try it full strength next time!

Deeelicious!  I have nothing to compare this to, as I, in my sheltered state, have never even tried bread pudding!  But, this was one of the better desserts I have ever made.  I neglected to make the sauce though...as it seemed "wet" enough without it and I assumed that was more to add moisture (also wasn't sure how much sweeter I could take this!).  Anyway, I'll make this again and up both the temp and time as well as follow thru with the rest of the recipe and make the sauce.  Thanks!!!

This was really good. Halved the recipe and used about 5 slices of loaf bread and regular raisins. Based on reviews, I added a couple pinches of allspice and used 3/4 of the Jack Daniel's. One could taste the whiskey, but it wasn't overpowering.  There was way too much sauce for me.  Only make 1/2, or less!  I will definitely make this again.

Oh, wow! Tonight was my turn to bring dessert, and everyone in our group just loved this. I reduced the sugar in the bread pudding to 1 cup, and it was still sweet. I prepared it in one 9" x 13" casserole. By increasing the oven temp to 325 degrees and baking time to 55-60 minutes, the pudding was done to perfection. (No comment on the sauce, since I used my own recipe.) Fabulous, easy, satisfying dessert!

OMG.  This was so good.  It's big.  It rose while cooking & lifted the lid off in the oven.  So good.  Mmmm.  Could have made half for family of 5.  Also, took about 2 hours to bake for me.  It's very moist- just like a bread pudding souffle.  Thank you!

Delicious hot or cold and the whiskey sauce was a perfect compliment to the pudding.  It comes out custardy and reminds me of rice pudding.

I added some chopped pecans on top, separated the recipe in 2-9x13 pans (shouldn't have, came out too thin) and halved the whiskey as suggested by many but couldn't taste it at all! (and I'm not used to alcoholic beverages). I think this makes too much sauce...turned out soupy. Good flavor, very subtle though. I think it needs more spices.

Best bread pudding ever.  Use Peppridge farms Cinnamon Raisin bread and you can cut out adding the raising.  Definitely a "comfort" food.

I made this a couple of yrs ago for a company pot luck, and wouldn't you know the ladies who were on the diet program changed thier meals for a scoop of this! I recently made this for my b/f and he went ga ga for it. Differences I put in were nutmeg, brown sugar, added some apples, peaches, and golden raisins. Depending on the bread you use will make a difference as well. Ive tried French and Chicago Italiian bread, but fresh is best! The whiskey sauce was the best didn't cut anything. Thanks for this fabuolus recipe!

Taste just like one I had at a restaraunt.  I'm a college student with a small kitchen, but this was easy to make.  The whiskey is a little strong (I used Jack Daniels) so probably should reduce the amount for kids or use another sauce.  Also, I used Texas-sized ButterKrust bread (with crust) which worked great.

Make the base for the sauce in before you add the whiskey at the end divide your sauce into two saucepans add 1/4 cup lemon juice to one and 1/4 cup whiskey to the other or even your favorite liqueur this way you offer variety for your guests

I followed the recipe aside from substituting rum for the whiskey.  It came out cripsy on top and soggy on the bottome, which evened out when you ate it but might be off-putting for some.  The sauce recipe makes a lot -- too much for the bread, I think.  It's good, but very sweet.

I only used the "whiskey sauce" part of this recipe on a bread pudding recipe I created. 

But I want to give the sauce a 5 because it was really easy and tasted great (even though it can hardly claim to  be healthy in any way ;-) 

I used Crown Royal.

The sauce is also good on slices of apple, and I am going to slather some on some fresh coconut to make coconut candy. My friend is going to put some that I gave her over ice cream. (it makes a LOT of sauce).

Great easy sauce, thanks!

This has quickly become one of my staples for desserts.  Everyone that tries it loves it.  The sauce is to die for.  Half the sauce recipe is plenty though...even enough to take home and eat drizzled over vanilla ice cream.

I give this 5 stars because of the amazing flavor and texture.  It bakes up beautifully and tastes great.  I did make a few changes: I baked at 350 for one hour, upped the cin. and added nutmeg to the mixture. 

The only thing I did not like about the way it turned out after baking was the spaces between the bread cubes.  In between the bread it looked like scrambled eggs.  Before baked there was a lot of mixture left, even after allowing the bread to absorb the mixture, but this was my first time making pudding so I left it there.  I think next time I would add the bread to the mixture, all it to fully saturate, pull the bread from the mixture to the pans and discard the remaining mixture. 

The sauce was great too, I only had spiced rum and used that.  Turned out perfect.

This pudding recipe is almost identical to my own so I stuck with it, however the sauce recipe was new to me...its a keeper! I will make it with whiskey next time but did not have any, instead used butterscotch schnapps. The sauce is very easy to make but like one other reviewer I let it bubble before removing it from the heat, then added the liquor. Can't wait to try it with the whiskey. Thanks for a great recipe!

THis is a good recipe,  but I reduce sugar to 1 C. and sometimes use a multi-grain bread. Also corn syrup is so bad for us, so I melt butter with some maple syrup and brandy to taste. Buon Appetito !

This is the best Bread Pudding! I have been making it for several years & is always a favorite. I do add more cinnamon & bake this for about 1-1/2 hrs... until the center puffs (you'll see what I mean when you bake it). For the sauce, I add 1/2 the whiskey...just want the flavor. It's great the 1st time, but even better re-heated as leftovers! Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

Good. I think it needs more cinnamon.  I made ahead and let it soak.  Removed from fridge and placed in oven while preheating.  i Baked it for almost 1:45.  The last 15 minutes i covered because it was starting to brown too much.

This is the best bread pudding I've ever tasted!! Left the recipe the same but upped the cinnamon to almost 2 T. Upped the temp to 350 and baked for an hour. Actually split the sauce into two bowls and made one with whiskey and one with Amaretto. They were fantastic!!  The Amaretto was extremely sweet but still had a good flavor.  Will certainly make this over and over!

was simple and delicious - I used up dinner rolls from Thanksgiving dinner, reduced serving size to 6 and used Amaretto instead of whiskey.  Make sure the sugar is dissolved in sauce before adding liquor

This was the first bread pudding I've made and it turned out GREAT! I followed the pudding recipe but used some dinner rolls we had left over and I baked it at 350 for 45 minutes as recommended in some reviews.  For the sauce, I used a little less of everything because I didn't want as much sauce (we're only two people) and used Amaretto instead of whiskey because I had it on hand (also recommended by other reviews).  It is a great treat, I'm going to bring it to a casual get togehter tonight, and I'm sure it will be a hit!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe, but used a french bread loaf, and cooked it at 325 for 55 minutes. I halved the recipe and use a loaf pan, which turned out great. I was concerned about the whiskey smell/flavor, but once it was soaked into the bread pudding, it tasted perfect. My one little nit is that it was a little bit runny, but the flavor made it a winner!

An excellent base..remember bread pudding was to use old bread, exta eggs,milk & cream, fruit, and the brandy to tempt the hubby! Very the cooking time and temp to compliment moisture milk/egg ratio..I like to remember to do mine in a water bath..but then sometimes I really like the crust..Think of this as a "light" fruitcake..Mine changes all the time..BTW the sauce is excellent on a cake..In Spain they have a whiskey cake..great, they pour the sause on the cake, and let it sit..watch so it's not too mushy. Frankly any favorit cake works..no frosting, dust w/powdered sugar.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I had to cook it way longer than 45 minutes and it was still gooey. And the sauce was way too strong. The part that I did eat was tasty so I gave 3 stars. Also I didn't know what a "medium" baking dish meant. I used a 9x13 and it was full. I always thought 9x13 was large.

Very good - everyone at the dinner party I made this for LOVED it.  I did, however, need to cut the whiskey in the whiskey sauce down.  I am not a "light weight" when it comes to having a drink but the whiskey was a little too over powering.  I think it would be best to ad a little at a time until you find the best flavor for you.

Sinfully good!  Used Wild Turkey Honey whiskey (cheap and has a nice sweet taste) and topped with rum raisin ice cream.  The sauce made quite a lot.  I will cut in half next time.  As suggested I used good bakery bread and baked in water bath.  Came out perfect.  Leftovers made for sumptuous 'french toast' breakfast (without the whiskey sauce).  Crowd pleaser and will definitely make again.  Thank you!

Great! If I would do anything differently, I would reduce the amount of sugar in the sauce...it was a little too sweet in my opinion. Aside from that, perfect! (I did use a water bath for baking in a 13 x 9 pan, at 350F for 45 minutes.

Wow!  This is really good.  I a made it as is.  I agree with other reviewers that it is too much sauce.  I also had to bake it longer. (not sure how much longer, I just kept checking it)  I made it for guests and my aunt kept raving about it!  I think it is superior to any bread pudding I have ever had at a restaurant.  This will be used again!

I have to say, the bread pudding was very good, but I found the sauce way too overpowering. I followed the recipe exactly, it actually burned my throat when I tasted it, I felt like I had just taken a shot. I might have to give it another try, but for me this was not a success.

Excellent.  I made this using Fabulous French Loaves from this site.  I used regular raisins since I didn't have golden raisins.  Like some of the others, I also had to bake it for a little longer than recipe stated.  I thought that it was just a bit on the sweet side for me but still great.

I've tried several bread pudding recipes with whiskey sauce and this is the best so far!!   I cut the recipe in half because it was me, my husband and 2 little kids and the recipe still was good.  I didn't have any cream on hand, so I used a can of sweetened condensed milk instead and it tasted wonderful!  The only thing I would change is less butter in the whiskey sauce.

Big hit!  Even with my sister who is the pickiest eater ever.  I baked at 325 for 1 hour.  Next time I will use 1/3 cup whiskey vs. 1/2 cup.  I thought it was a little overpowering.  I used a loaf of french bread.

My family loved this recipe. I was trying to match a restaurant's bread pudding that they love so much; and they said I came extremely close. My niece said mine was even better than the restaurant's pudding.
I made this one night and tried it shortly after taking it out of the oven. The whiskey sauce tasted very strong. The next day I ate some and could not taste the whiskey at all. I think it is better if you let the bread pudding set overnight so the sauce has time to soak into the bread. Just warm it in the microwave when you are ready to enjoy this succulent treat.

Mmmmmmmm....Delicious and Easy! I didn't have heavy cream, but 1 can evaporated milk seemed to work just as well.  I also added 2 chopped (peeled) apples on top.  The whiskey sauce is literally the crowning glory!  (Didn't find the amount of whiskey overpowering at all.) Thank you!!

This recipe is absolutely the best!  I served it for St. Patrick's Day and everyone raved about it.  I did cut the whiskey amount by 1/2 and we served it warm with vanilla ice cream on the side.  Can't wait to make it again!

Oh WOW. This was soooo good. I made it for a New Year's Eve party and it was gone in no time. I used Pepperidge Farms' sweet buttermilk bread (a 1.5 lb loaf), and other than adding a little nutmeg and decreasing the alcohol just a little, I didn't change anything about the recipe. I have to say it's the very best bread pudding recipe I've ever tried.

This had a really good flavor but I think that it may have needed to be cooked a litter longer.
May have been the ovens fault.  Certinally not mine!! LOL

This was my first time making bread pudding. My Mom always made it when I was a child of course, without the whiskey!  I have been baking all my life but I never tried to make bread pudding; it was very good and I plan to make it again and again. Thanks

Wonderful just as it is.  I gave the recipe 5 stars as is.  I made this twice last week.  The second recipe I increased the cinnamon to 1 tbsp. and added 1/8 tsp. of Allspice.  I also covered the raisins with Bourbon and brought to a gentle boil.  I then turned off the heat and covered the raisins until ready to use (I did drain the raisins before adding them to the recipe).  After mixing the recipe, I poured it in the pan, covered, and refrigerated it for about six hours prior to baking.  I baked the bread pudding at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.  I do not like my bread pudding dried out.  I used only 1/2 Cup of Bourbon for the sauce.

Delicious! I used Italian bread, half and half instead of heavy cream and five eggs. Kept all other ingredients as listed in the recipe and didn't add anything else. (Left out the raisins since I'm not a fan.) Baked at 300 degrees for 55 minutes, no water bath. The texture was perfect! It was moist and not too sweet. I had to forego the sauce tonight since I didn't have any alcohol, but I will try making it with amaretto tomorrow. Wonderful recipe, and I will make this again in the future.

I've altered this a bit using Cranberry Walnut Bread. A family favorite along with warm whiskey sauce. I used a 2lb loaf and it was fine to use with the same recipe used for 1lb bread.

I substituted croissants instead of using bread.  I used 5 standard-sized croissants.  

I found the baking time to be way off!  Ended-up baking at 300 degrees 50 additional minutes!

Overall, the pudding and sauce was scrumptious!  Would definitely make again!

I thought this dish was fair.  I added roasted walnuts (which I highly recommend to provide texture to the finished product) - Otherwise, it's just kind of mushy in your mouth.  The pudding set okay (at 325 degrees), and the whiskey sauce was good, but it just didn't sweep me away like it did so many other raters.  For this many calories, I'm gonna choose something truly decadent and satisfying, which (for me), was not this dessert.

I used this recipe to use up stale cinnamon rolls a couple of days after Christmas.  I omitted the cinnamon and cut the sugar by one third in the pudding.  I kept the sauce the same.  I wanted to drink the sauce!  Everyone loved it!

I've  made this twice now, but I found a different whiskey sauce, because I didn't have corn syrup in my pantry.  The second time I used brioche bread, just because I saw it in the store. It made a lighter bread pudding, but it fell like a bad soufflé!  
    I did set my oven to 350 degrees for 50 minutes, as another suggested. My guests LOVED it.

Made this for my father who is a huge bread pudding fan! While I like bread pudding this was my first time at trying a bread pudding recipe (mainly the amt. of carbs in it lol) but for my dad I made this the other night and wow, it was fantastic. Now I did substitute the whiskey for rum since it's what I had on hand and it was great. I did scale down the sugar a little since seeing the sauce recipe knew it was already going to be a rich dessert but everything was still super delicious I did send the rest home with my dad, since I knew if it would've stayed at my house I would've eaten all of it. Thanks so much for the recipe, great job!!!

It was good, my skinny teenager ate half the pan in one evening.  My only issue was the time and temp listed.  I baked it at 325, based on others reviews for 60 minutes.  I like it on the dry side and it was still too wet.  Next time I'll bake it about 10-15 minutes longer or at 350.

Everone loves when I make this recipe!! I make mine using left over Irish soda bread from St. Patrick''s Day. I fill a 9x13 full of broken pieces of the bread and the whipped mixture is a perfect amount for the bread to soak in. I scatter raisins throughout before adding the whipped mixture.  Definitely use whiskey for the sauce. Yum!! I also changed the oven setting to 350 degrees.

I cut the recipe in half and added pecans, otherwise didn't change a thing with ingredients. Followed the other suggestions of baking at 350 for 60 minutes. It still looked too wet, so I covered it loosely with foil and let it sit in a 250 deg oven until we were ready for dessert (approx 30 min). I definitely did not think the sauce had an overwhelming whiskey flavor. Will be making this again!

Excellent recipe!! I used Italian bread and dried cranberries instead of raisins. And I cooked at 325 for 90 minutes, covering with foil for last 30 minutes to prevent burning. It turned out custardy and delicious! I used top-quality Four Roses Bourbon and the sauce was to die for. Not too alcoholic at all. Will definitely make again! It disappeared at Easter brunch.

YUM!!!  This is really good and I enjoyed it.  I made this for 6 servings (half the recipe) and it filled a 9x13 glass dish.  I used 1 full loaf of Italian bread about 2-3 days old from bake date.  Since I did not have enough raisins, I added 1 finely chopped red apple and some chopped pecans (enough to sprinkle evenly).  This gave it a nice subtle crunch so it was not all mush.  I used Tullamore Whiskey for the sauce, and otherwise followed the recipe.  Before baking, the bread was soaked thoroughly and evenly, but there was not much leftover liquid.  I baked as per recipe to 300 for 45-60 minutes and until browned a little bit.  The bread pudding was moist and spongy, with no excess liquid or dryness.  I do recommend adding some nuts or apples for extra flavor/texture.

This is a super yummy recipe! I used a third of the sugar and half the milk, and regular raisins, as we don't like ours as sweet as the original recipe. The whisky sauce is delicious, but the recipe makes enough for about 3 or 4 puddings. We also used French bread, and packed it tightly into a 9x9 inch pan. I

So so so good, and loved by many. ;) Personal preference modifications - double cinnamon, up temp to 350, bake for an hour and twenty. After making the sauce once I realized that it was an insane amount so now I make a third of what's called for.  Also, I always serve with vanilla bean ice cream, which takes it to a WHOLE other level. My friends also call it "naughty French toast." Whatever they call it, it gets inhaled.

Used 9X13 pan. Used spiced rum (instead of whiskey). Delicious.

I made this exactly as instructed, and it's great! I doubled the cinnamon because we love cinnamon in this house. Even my husband (not the biggest bread pudding fan) really liked it and ate a second helping.  You can back off on the whiskey if you like, but I recommend making it according to the recipe because the whiskey adds a lot of flavor.  Five stars!

This bread pudding is very much like the one I've been making for years and it's pretty tasty. I did make a couple of changes  the second time I made it  --  I cut back the sugar to one cup and converted the milk/cream additions to fat free half and half. (I promise you won't miss the extra sugar or the cream.) And, because I love golden raisins, I doubled (okay, maybe I tripled) the amount to go in.  The only thing that I'm not crazy about is the sauce. It's a sauce technique I'm not familiar with and it turned out way too sweet and grainy for me.  So I'll stick with what I know when it comes to that finishing touch.

I used leftover cinnamon rolls for my bread, and the egg/milk mixture separated during baking, so I remixed it and baked again, but it did take a long baking to get it past the wet stage.  The sauce was tricky.  It was not thickening for me at all, so I added some caramel & the rest of the container of cream to it.  After all that doing, it was delicious!

Worth the effort. Absolutely wonderful traditional Irish Bread Pudding. I used Jameson's whiskey for the sauce. Perfect holiday treat.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving.  The sauce is delish.  I used another reviewer's recommendation to use Appleton Estate rum and I used only 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  It was perfect.  I also did not have golden raisins so I used dark raisins which was yummy.  I usually do not write reviews but my husband told me that I have to tell everyone how he loves this recipe!

We loved! loved! loved! the bread pudding! I cut the sugar down and used agave instead. the sauce was amazing! only changes I made was adding brown sugar and pecan's and less sugar to the sauce,about a Half cup brown sugar and quarter cup white sugar.. it still was so very good almost too sweet . The pudding stands on its own ! The sauce takes it over the top! GREAT GREAT receipt!! we will make this again for sure!  I will try a vegan version by using tofu instead of eggs and almond milk!I Also added nutmeg. Thank you for a new family favorite!!

The first time I tried this recipe I used up all of my leftover hamburger and hot dog buns that had taken root in my freezer.  I had to adjust the recipe a little..adding more milk and cinnamon for the amount of bread I used.  I also exchanged the sugar to Splenda and it was great, not to mention the response from the men in our crowd about whiskey sauce!  It was a big it!  This recipe will have a front row seat in my desert file.  Thank you so much for sharing it!

Being from Louisiana I am always on the hunt for good bread pudding.  I have made this recipe numerous times over the past couple of years and it gets gobbled up every time.  My uncle tries bread pudding everywhere he travels and swears this one beats all the others.  I use butter croissants from Costco for the bread and I add diced peaches (with most of the heavy syrup drained off).  My wife is not a fan of raisins and the peaches are a perfect substitute.  I raise the temperature as others have suggested.  For the sauce I didn't change a thing.  One of the aspects of good New Orleans bread pudding that I enjoy is the whiskey "bite" in the sauce when the alcohol is not cooked off.  Yum!

The bread pudding was the best!! Used 1 cup sugar in sauce.  Will try less next time.  Used 1/3 cup Gentleman Jack whiskey (VERY smooth, but expensive).  Served at party where some commented on the whiskey taste, but all thought it good (due to the smoothness and less "bite").  Thanks LADYEM!!

I made a 1/2 recipe in an 8 inch square pan and used a homemade cinnamon swirl bread. I added a bit of nutmeg along with the cinnamon.It was very good. The sauce has a wonderful consistency. I baked it at 350 and took it out when it still looked just a bit wet.

I make this often -- fave bread pudding.  I use day-old cinnamon bread.  I wanted a non-alcoholic version, so I substitute a boiled custard sauce instead of the whiskey sauce.  Makes it even richer, and not too sweet.

Very good!  I used Bacardi light rum instead of Whiskey though.  Love rum for it's sweetness.  Not a Whiskey fan.  Turned out deliciously!  I used French Baguettes for the bread and it was GREAT!

Pretty good. Not the best I've had, but worth making. I prefer more of a buttery taste to the pudding itself, so I might try to toss some butter with the bread and cut down on some of the liquids next time I make this. I did think it was just a bit too sweet with the sauce (very good and easy), so adding less sugar is one thing I would definitely change.

Great dish! I did a 1/2 batch soaked the raisins in boiling water to soften first and substituted soy milk for milk and cream for I am lactose intolerant. It is a great dairy free treat! Also, we have made it with whiskey, brandy and dark rum and all are great, but we like our loose delights.

Turned out great! I brought this to a Marti Gras party and it was a hit.  Only change was to use only half the suggested amount of alcohol. I also switched to using Southern Comfort instead of Whiskey as well. Made a full 13x9. I may have over cooked it, but I like the top of my bread pudding slightly crispy. I baked it an additional 20 minutes (total of 65 mins). It definitely wasn't done at 45 minutes. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was the most delicious bread pudding I've ever eaten. I made some changes because of what I had on hand and the size of pan I used. After reading the other reviews I cut the milk back to four cups total. I had a cup of coconut milk leftover over from another recipe so I used that in place of one of the cups and counted the cup of light cream I used for another cup of the milk. I cut the syrup recipe in half and drizzled it over the top of the whole dish after it came out of the oven. I still had some leftover but it tasted great drizzled on top of our oatmeal this morning.

Yummy. I cut down on the whiskey just as a preference of mine. Added it to taste.  I used stale french bread and the tops of Sara Lee hamburger buns. Tasty

I made this yesterday for Christmas day dessert and it was AMAZING! Several people said it was the best they ever had. I prepped it in the morning, poured the egg mixture over it and popped it in the fridge. When we were eating dinner, I baked it. SO EASY! I made the whiskey sauce as is, and drizzled some over the pudding. It makes a ton of sauce, and we found a little drizzled over the entire thing was more than enough. Can't wait to make it again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for an authentic crawfish boil for 50 people and the hosts (who are New Orleans transplants) LOVED it as well as everyone else! I also added a tad of allspice to the mixture and increased the temp to 350 and approximately 1 hour of baking time to allow it to set. It was slighltly firm on the outside and moist on the inside. Perfect! We did have a lot of whiskey sauce left over.(a little goes a long way!)Will definitely keep this recipe.

Exceptionall! I made this hoping to duplicate a local restaurant's whiskey bread pudding, and am very satisfied.  I used pear brandy instead of whiskey and was amazing, also used 10oz croissants and 6oz french bread which made for a very nice crispy crust on top and fluffyness underneath. As others suggested, I raised the cooking temp to 325 for 50 minutes and was perfect.   

One problem I had was way way too much sauce, I only used 1cup sugar and 1cup corn syrup but still had about a cup of extra sauce.  Could cut back even further with sugar as sauce was plenty sweet.

So yummy!  This was my first attempt at bread pudding and I'm quite proud of myself.  I used blackberry jam instead of raisins because i had none on hand and fat free half and half instead of cream.  turned out great.  I also concocted my own healthier sauce, but the basic recipe is really easy and delicious.

I add about 1/2 more of the 'custard' to the bread.  It makes it less dry.

Wonderful recipe!

This recipe is FABULOUS!!  The only change I made was to cut back on the Whiskey a little but that is a personal preference.  It was easy, fast, and delicious hot or cold!  A sure keeper recipe!  Thanks.

Really good. My husband is from Ireland and is really picky about bread pudding- he loved it. I took it to a Mardi Gras potluck with the sauce in a mini crockpot to keep it warm - everyone raved on the sauce and poured it over many of the other desserts! Only change I made was to soak the raisins in the whiskey overnight and then use the leftover whiskey in the sauce.

This bread pudding was a BIG HIT with my kids and grandkids.  People who thought they didn't like bread pudding, love it now!  There was one problem and I believe it should have read 350 degrees, not 300.  It wasn't getting done, so I turned up the oven and then it was fine.  It is DELICIOUS served with whipped cream on top!

I made this bread pudding for the staff development day at school. Everyone loved it. A few people even asked me to bring some more later in the year when we need a pick-me-up. I used less whiskey than called for and just added a little bit at a time until it had the flavor I was looking for. Wonderful!

LOVED this recipe. I had to cook it longer than the 45 mins. Raised the cooking level to 350 degrees and cooked for an additional 25 mins. So either the cooking time needs to be longer or the temp higher. You'll need to adjust accordingly. I also reduced the amt. of whiskey. It even tasted better the next day.

You could easily half this recipe unless you're serving a lot of people.  I doubled the raisins and mixed them throughout the pudding.  Also had to cook it a lot longer than the recipe said (almost double the time).  Sauce is great though!

Perfect!  This recipe turns out beautifully and is not hard to make.  It's absolutely delicious.  I suggest using half the amount of whiskey.
