Terrific and Easy! Reminds me of mom's recipe except she used 1 tblsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt instead of baking soda.  Gives it cake consistency. I also made an adjustment to the topping.  On the topping I used 1/2 white granulated sugar and 1/2 cup powdered sugar for the sugar called for. Also note: use unsalted stick butter and unsweetened coconut. Bring your mixture to rapid boil for at least 1 minute. Stir in vanilla after you remove from heat. This will make the topping set up beautifully. Great recipe, will use again. Thanks for the memories :-)

If you love a coconut topping and very moist and tender cake with fruit inside, this one's for you. It was excellent! It tastes best still slightly warm or at room temperature.
We will definitely make this one again and again.

This recipe was not a success at all. I made it twice for 15 to 20 people. Most of my guests did not like it but one or two of them just loved it - I guess it's a cake that you either hate or love but not a general crowd pleaser. Since I prefer recipes that are liked by a wider range of guests I will not bake this again.

This was so good. I've never had fruit cocktail cake before but it was excellent. It was also very easy to make. I will be making this many more times.

I made this because my mom used to make this when I was little.  The cake was as I remember it, but a bit chewy.  The topping was nothing to write home about.  Honestly, it doesn't need the topping, it's perfect on its own!

We ate this warm and it was fantastic! I added cinnamon and nutmeg like one of the other reviewers. Also. It didn't sound like evaporated milk was right for the topping. I used sweetened condensed milk.

I had my *1 star* review already mentally prepared as I pulled the cake from the oven.  It didn't look right - it didn't feel right - and it certainly didn't smell right.  I turned around to begin making the frosting (note, I didn't use all the milk called for and I also substituted about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar for the granulated).  By the time the frosting was done, my scathing review was done and then some (my cake began to sink and looked TERRIBLE).  I furiously began to spoon the topping on, muttering to myself about the wasted ingredients, angrily grabbed a small bowl and spooned the gloppy stuff in ... took a bite ... and then another ... and before I knew it my bowl was licked clean.  This cake is hideous looking - all lumpy and dumpy - but the taste is divine.  Seriously.  I can't believe something so ugly could taste so good.  Have no idea what it'll taste like in a few hours - but for right now?  Heaven.  I should note I used home-canned fruit cocktail which gave mine a distinct browning color - in retrospect that probably contributed to it's ugliness.

This was a delicious cake! I had to make it in an 8x8 pan since it was all I had so had to bake it about 10 mins longer. I also had more topping than needed, but too much is better than not enough. I too decided to use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup powdered sugar in the glaze. Boiled it a couple of minutes (stirring) and it set up fine. Think the next time I will add a little cinnamon and vanilla to the cake batter, but was very tasty!

This was perfect, exactly what I was looking for.  I have one quibble; the recipe doesn't state when to add the vanilla.  Since it was listed with the topping, I put it in after the topping boiled.  I also put a tsp of vanilla in the batter, just because I like it, and it didn't seem to hurt.

Wow, this is a great recipe!  Very easy to make and turned out perfect! I would cut down the amount of sugar by nearly half though next time, as it really didn't need so much, esp with the icing. I used baking powder only, no soda and it rose nicely. I used a wooden spoon to poke the cake before I poured the icing over, then it filled the holes and made the cake super moist (as if it wasn't moist enough in the first place).  I will make this again!

My mom used to make a cake similar to this. I don't have her recipe, but this tastes very similar to what I remember. I added 1/2 tsp. salt to the dry ingredients and sprinkled about 1/4 cup chopped pecans on top after pouring on the topping. It was done in 25 minutes. Very good, moist cake. The texture is more like bread pudding than cake. My family liked it.

I did not add the coconut because my family doesn't like it. The cake is very moist and good but not as good on the second day. It gets a spongy texture.

Good cake but I did make some alterations, I added a1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves, when I made the topping I left out the coconut and cooked it the same amount of time as the cake which made it thicker 
Ike Carmel it really makes the cake. My husband and grandkids devoured it.

The cake was great but the topping was not.  It never came together because there was too much milk.  Had to add more sugar to get it to thicken up and then it was too sugary/grainy.  I had not made this cake for several years but after I got the icing started, I remembered that I used only a small can of emilk.  Will make this cake again with the correct topping.
