This recipe is AWSOME!  I have made this a lot and my family loves it!  I double the recipe except for the onion.  It always tastes better as leftovers, and you can freeze too!

Made this for the family and it was awful. Thank heavens it was just leftover ham. Very watery and tasteless.

i'm in the process of cooking this in my crock pot right now. i didn't use ham because i don't like it to much but i did use kielbasa in place. other than that i followed everything exactly, added S&P. it looks like it will turn out yummy. i can't wait to eat it!

I was lazy and substituted cream of broccoli soup instead of the actual broccoli. DELICIOUS! It was a big big hit.

As written, it is pretty bland, like others have said. I left out the ham, since I didn't have any. I added some garlic powder and ground black pepper, but it was still missing something to give it that "oomph." I probably won't be making this again, but it was nice to try something different, thanks Rebeckah.

We enjoyed the simplicity of this soup.  A few reviews said that it was a little bland so I added more ham, garlic and black pepper. This is not meant to be complex in flavor, it's a comfort food.  Loved it!

Tasty, but not much flavor.  I added Cajun spice and pepper for a bit of flavor.
