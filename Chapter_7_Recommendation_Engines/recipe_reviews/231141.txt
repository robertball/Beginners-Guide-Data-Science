I thought this recipe turned out very well.  I DID read all the reviews and take that into consideration...some of the things I may have altered were...I used 1 med. size onion, not 1/2 cup, I added  zucchini to the skillet after cooking corn/onion/jalapeño, I think that, in addition to the thin slices, made them so much more yummy.  I also added a couple TBSP butter to the skillet, people said the dish lacked flavor, I didn't wanna risk it ;) I also added salt, pepper, dash of cayenne pepper, garlic powder & some celery seeds.  These made for a VERY flavorful and yummy dish! I don't measure stuff...sorry :( but keep in mind, when seasoning a dish make sure to add enough to season ALL of the dish, not just the veggies on top! stir it all in really well and you'll have a delicious side dish that you WILL want to make again.  I didn't use the "Touch of Philly" cheese as I couldn't find it, turned out fine. Enjoy!

I too used frozen corn, and without having the special Kraft cheese on hand, I subbed 2/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese and 1 ounce Philly cheese (in small dabs on top.) I especially liked that cream cheese flavor punch!

FABULOUS!!  I made this pretty much the way it was written but did cook the zucchini with the corn.  Didn't have cheddar cheese so used Italian blend and it was great.  My husband just raved about it and now it will be our staple when we have zuchin I coming out of our ears.

This was good. I used frozen corn. I recommend putting the zucchini in with the corn though, unless you like really crunchy zucchini. I agree it was a bit bland also. I put a little garlic powder, salt & pepper in it. I'd give it 4 stars because I put my zucchini in with the corn & I still had to cook it longer than stated. But this is going on rotation for being simple to cook up & is yummy comfort food. 5 stars.

This was easy and very tasty. Will make it again.  Used frozen corn.  Prepared entire dish in cast iron skillet.

So easy to make! Substituted jalapeños w diced green chilies (a little milder for a 2 year old), I also included & topped w Progressive Garlic & Herb bread crumbs. Added a little extra flavor.

This was delicious! A great way to use zucchini and sweet corn! The only changes I made were salting the zucchini and letting it rest for awhile to remove some of the moisture, then rinse it off.  I also only had sharp cheddar and cream cheese, and I added some garlic powder, lots of S&P and I added buttered italian bread crumbs on top. I will make this again and again.

Simple, easy, but not super interesting flavor wise even with a few extra jalapenos.

This was a delicious recipe! I used fresh corn off the cob from the farmer's market and zucchini from my garden. I too added salt and pepper to spice it up.

Didn't seem to have much flavor. I added salt, pepper, and sage, and it still seemed fairly bland. Ok to eat once, but I probably won't make it again without making some adjustments to the recipe.

I loved this recipe. I subbed the milk and flour with heavy whipping cream and added some cream cheese! Amazing!

I used fresh corn, followed the recipe as it was written but felt it was bland. Made again and added some cream cheese, salt and pepper, paprika, butter and 2 cloves of fresh clover. It brought the flavor up several levels and my family really enjoyed it!!

A little bland but a good base. Next time I'll add bell pepper, black beans, and reduce the corn.

Without even reading reviews first, I could tell some things needed to be changed. 5 cups of corn to 1/3 cup of milk seems way off to me. Also there is no seasoning in the recipe? I used one cup frozen corn and one cup black beans. I didn't have any chili peppers so I added chipotle chili powder which gave it a nice smoky flavor. Also added a good amount of salt and two stalks of green garlic. I used one cup homemade cashew milk (much creamier than regular milk) and 1 1/3 cup Daiya shredded cheddar. If I was going to make it again, I'd spice it up the same way, and probably salt the zucchini slices first to get some of the water out, which will soften them up.

This was delicious.  We did alter it a tad bit because of the ingredients on hand.  We used 3 small zucchini and 3 cups of corn.  We should have doubled the flour milk mixture.  This is my new favorite squash recipe.

Excellent! However, I needed to add more milk, as the amount in the recipe made the mixture too dry.

We enjoyed this easy side dish. I used frozen corn that I defrosted in a sieve. I changed the method so that I added the zucchini first then the corn as I wanted my zucchini cooked a little longer. I used 3 small zucchinis green, yellow and grey. I had to add more milk, probably 1/2 cup all together. I also added seasonings, black pepper, Creole spice salt free, garlic and Greek seasoning. I seeded half the jalapeno as I didn't know hot spicy it would be, it was fine. Will definitely make again.

I did mine a little differently. I browned the veggies a little, and added the zucchini to the veggie mix to let it steam a few minutes, before adding the sauce.  It turned out nicely.  This is a good side dish, I plan to prepare again.

I loved it! I did not have the correct ingredients so I used a tablespoon on cream cheese and regular cheddar cheese and I did not add any other liquids,. I sprinkled a few french fried onions on top during the broiling process...

It was good - but I should have read the other reviews first!  Zucchini needed to be cooked along with the corn - needed more flavor and more of the sauce.  I will serve this again and adjust these things.
