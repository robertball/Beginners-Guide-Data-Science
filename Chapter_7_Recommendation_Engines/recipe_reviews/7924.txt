A lady I know told me that since I was an accomplished baker I should make a "Brownstone" cake so I found this recipe and made it.The cake batter was dry when I finished it according to the recipe so I added sour cream which improved that and I think that the cake part tastes ok but the icing tastes like sugar water and even though I made it exactly as directed and used a candy thermometer it is still runny and not very appealing.It was a very difficult and time consuming recipe(with insane amounts of sugar) which makes it no fun at all.I did not like it!

If you are from the South you know this is not a traditional Brownstone Front. BUTTER only no shortening. Melted unsweetened chocolate not cocoa. The eggs are separated the whites beaten until stiff and folded in at the end. True Brownstone Front icing has evaporated milk 2 sticks of butter and 2 cups of sugar cooked to soft ball stage cooled to room temperature and then beaten to spreading consistency. It is a pain from start to finish but worth the trouble once you get it right. It takes a lot of practice and more than one failure.

Ok as for the negative reviews.......if you can't use a cndy themometer stick to using canned frosting. It isn't always the recipe at fault.

This special cake recipe was always made for birthdays in our family by my grandmother (who was taught to make it by her mother in law)and it is delicious. It isn't a low calorie cake but it is meant as a treat not a weekly dessert. Grandma always made it in a 9x13 pan. She kept it covered and it was very moist. It has a very distinct flavor and smells so good!
