Tasty, but it needs something else.  I doubled the amount of kalamata olives and the tomatoes were still overpowering.  I think it works best cooled in the fridge; I tried it both hot and cold and liked the latter better.

We really enjoyed this dish but hubby thought that it would have been so much better with sauteed onions added.  I loved it as a different kind of side.  Thank you so much for posting your recipe.

Different and delicious as written!  My tomatoes didn't really wrinkle, they just started splitting open after a while.  I do recommend chopping the olives to better distribute them.  Easy to double.

This is so simple and so good! I am not a huge olive fan and they are great in this! I have a ton of cherry tomatoes in my garden and never know what to do with them. I also added some diced up eggplant because I had some! Delicious.

I chopped yellow bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms and then sauted them. When this was about half cooked I added the tomatoes and balsamic vinegar. I followed the recipe from that point and served mixed in spaghetti pasta. Very tasty.

This recipe is simple but delicious.  Sometimes less is more. Great way to use the tomato bounty from the garden!
