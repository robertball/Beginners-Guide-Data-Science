Didn't know what to give my 4-year old for preschool lunch so made a tray of this with my leftover farfel, light sour cream, mexican cheese, and lactose free 2% milk.  I was shocked when she said she ate it (it does NOT look that appetizing).  I haven't tried it, but if my picky 4-year old ate it, it must be ok.  A friend of mine tried it and said 'it resembled mac and cheese'.  Still can't tell if that's a compliment :)

It was very delicious!!! I added extra 12 ounces of cheese because my family is a cheese addict! I would, however, add some mushrooms or some other vegetable to give a mixture of tastes and textures. Definitely would make again!!!
