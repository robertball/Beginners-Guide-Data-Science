Great recipe for using those leftover candy canes!  They are like lace cookies as they really spread out--would suggest 6 per cookie sheet at a time.  If you chill the dough for about 30 minutes you can roll them into 1 inch (or smaller) balls, then you can just press them into the crushed candy canes.  Had to use frozen almond bark in place of white chocolate.  Melted it in microwave and mixed it in before chilling the dough.  Cookies turned out great.  This is a "keeper" recipe.

I made these for my 4 year old daughter's cookie exchange at daycare.  They were AWESOME!!!!  I used baking powder instead of baking soda & I used Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix.

So I made it w/ a few changes, I did half butter half butter flavored crisco because since everyone said they flattened out so bad. Well, they still flattened out ridiculously, I had a tough time getting them off the pan. My best batch was put in the fridge before baking, then baked on parchment paper and immediately after removing from the oven, I took the parchment paper off the hot pan to finish cooling on a rack. I didn't taste much hot cocoa either. My thought is that there is just too much sugar in this recipe, though the cookies were oddly addicting while still warm. I will not make this recipe again.

Made these once and they spread out so much, 1 dozen cookies covered my entire cookie sheet. Cut them apart with a pizza cutter and dropped some marshmallows in them. Thought they would taste better than they looked. Well, partly. Although the cookie itself had a good flavor, they were so sticky and chewie I had to chisel them off my teeth. Since they had a good flavor, I thought I might try them again. Didn't soften the butter in the microwave and used a new box of baking soda. Nope, it didn't help. Sitting here looking at the second batch of hot chocolate crispy wafers. Good idea, horrible recipe. You'll do better to make a cup of hot cocoa, put some marshmallows in it, and stir it up with a candy cane.

They spread out way to thin and were inseparable from the pan.  I was using homemade butter, which I suspect was the problem.

We tried making these today for a change of pace and they'll make a perfect addition to our Christmas baking! The cookies turned out very chewy, which my family loves. Since none of us really like mint we used raspberry flavoured candy canes instead, and they turned out really well.
