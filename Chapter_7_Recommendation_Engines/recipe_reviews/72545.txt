I'm sorry to say that this didn't turn out really well.  There were WAY too many noodles, and it was just too gelatinous and globby.  I added more spices and even soy sauce to try and salvage it, but I ended up throwing out the whole bowl.

I have no idea what the other reviewer did wrong. This was a fabulous salad. The only change I made was to swap out the zucchini with cucumber and the tofu with real shrimp. I'm just not partial to tofu and zucchini. I also used green onion, instead of standard onions and scrambled the eggs. This lovely dish fed the whole family, even the kids were coming back for more!

This was not good - I wouldn't recommend maaking this.

I believe the instructions regarding cellophane noodles (glass noodles, mung-bean noodles) need to be more explicit in this recipe for "Spicy Asian Cellophane Noodle Salad." There are different types of cellophane noodles which need to be prepared differently (bean-thread type vs. ribbon-pasta type). I soak my bean-thread type cellophane noodles in hot tap water for 30 minutes, drain well, and cut the threads into 2" strands before proceeding to make the salad (no cooking). Chef Jamie Oliver also does not cook bean-thread type cellophane noodles in his "Fresh Asian Noodle Salad." Perhaps any issues reviewers are having with this recipe are related to the type of bean-thread type cellophane noodles used. Thank you SUMMER530 for sharing your recipe.

What a hit! My whole family loved this. The lime adds such a nice tanginess to everything. I added some bok choy. I used japchae glass noodles and, because of allergies, I had to use fermented black bean paste instead of fish sauce. Thank you for the recipe.
