This is a great recipe for Fresh Salsa! I cut way back on the onion and garlic, doubled the lime juice, and threw in half of a chopped cucumber. This is heavenly on bean tacos! I like to supplement the spiciness with bottled hot taco sauce.

This is the quintissential salsa recipe.  The cool tomatoes contrast nicely against the spicy jalapenos and pungent onion, and the lime juice and salt round out the flavors nicely.  Let it sit overnight to really let the flavor develop.

I went to a party last week and a friend of mine brought a dip similar to this one, and after trying it I had to make it. I came here and found this recipe. It has been a week and I've made this dip twice! I must admit that they weren't the same recipe, this one is actually better! The garlic and jalapenos give it quite the kick, and my family is in love with Cilantro, so this is the perfect recipe!

Good, basic salsa recipe. Actually, more like pico de gallo than salsa, but you could always put in food processor. We like this recipe just the way it is - it is chunky and full of flavor. I'm not sure about the exact measurements because I usually just "eyeball" amounts, but the ingredients compliment each other well.

This salsa lacked something - I served when guests came over and everyone agreed it just wasn't very good.  I ended up throwing it away.

This salsa is mostly onion, and very strongly so.  The cilantro is very strong, too.  It would be better if these two ingredients were reduced by about half, and maybe more tomatoes used.

I didn't realize how simple it is to make salsa!  I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of the tomatillo because I didn't have one).  It is so good! Even before I gave the ingredients a chance to marry.  I'll never buy jar salsa again!

This is the recipe I was searching for! It turned out great. I ended up using the entire pepper as I thought the heat needed to be turned up.

Great!  A couple very minor tweaks that I made...I put 2 tomatoes into the food processor and diced the other 2, to have a salsa-like consistency.  Included with the tomatoes in the processor, I added the jalapeno.  I reduced the onion to half and reduced the cilantro a little - you can always add more later if you prefer more.  I increased the lime juice to 1 whole lime (2 TBSP??).  Added one can of diced green chilies.  I didn't measure the salt (wish I did), but it takes quite a bit to get the right profile.  It is one of the best salsa's that I have ever had anywhere.  The only thing that would make it better is if I had garden-fresh tomatoes:(

To those of you who felt something was missing...add just a little cider vinager. It added just enough"something" to balance out the flavors.  Very good. will make again

I'd say that this is really pico de gallo.  But, we really like it with taco chips... low-cal & tasty snack!

Ingredient wise this pretty much matches a recipe I have been using for a while and it always works as long as I TASTE it while in the process. I've noted a few complaints and I think tasting it while in process is the key. Some tomatoes are sweeter and some are more sour, some jalapenos have more heat than others, and some onions vary is sweetness and strength. You have to taste and make adjustments because of these variances. You can also make it with canned tomatoes for more of a Mexican restaurant consistency.

I don't like the tomato skins in my salsa, so I cut them in half and then grate them on a cheese grater, yes, down to the skin and use this mixture as a base, it is also thinner. I also doubled the lime juice and used a fresh roasted Habanero pepper seeded and deveined.  Was good!

This is an excellent salsa recipe.  If you put it in the food processor, chop the onion by hand to avoid having it taste too onion-y from all of the juices.  Also, one jalepeno is just not enough.  It was less than mild.  Last time I made it I used 3!  Also, leaving it to sit in the fridge overnight really does let the flavors settle.  The jalepeno gets milder from the tomatoes.  I think that is why I needed so many to taste the kick!

this is definitely your basic fresh pico de gallo recipe.  Saying that, I loved it!  I added an extra jalapeño to give it even more heat, and I used my food processor to get a smooth/chunky texture.  
I do think this makes more than just 4 servings though....I have tons leftover (not that I'm complaining!)

I love this salsa recipe, and I have tried many being from the Southwest. I usually add an extra jalepeno because we like ours hot, and I use the McCormick sea salt and garlic grinder for extra flavor. Always a hit!

This recipe calls for way too much onion. We added 2 extra tomatoes, more lime juice, black beans and corn and it still had an aftertaste of pungent onions. If I make this recipe again we'll cut the onion in half.

I love the flavor so, I love the recipe with the tomatillo.  I skipped the salt only because I forgot to add and used a blender cause I like mine a bit more fluid versus chunky.  But HELP!  What am I doing wrong?  Why doesn't the salsa color come out as bright red?  My batch came out a muddy color.

It seemed like it was missing some depth in flavor. I tried adding some more spices like oregano and garlic powder but I felt like it needed something else. Not sure what.

This is a good basic salsa recipe.  I did, however, cut WAY down on the onion as other reviewers suggested (as written, it overpowered the taste of the tomatoes and cilantro flavor and didn't even taste like "salsa").  I only used 3 tablespoons of very finely diced sweet onion.  I also substituted a 1/2 can of diced green chiles as I didn't have any fresh on hand.  This is a quick salsa to make and can be easily modified to individual taste.  Thanks Cecilia!

This was fun for my kids to prepare in the food processor.  Just a few pulses and we had delicious homemade salsa.  This taste so much better than the store bought brands.

Very good salsa. We don't care for garlic all that much, so I cut that back a bit. I have also found that you can chop up some of the green tomatoes and add it gives the salsa brighter taste to it, and it also gives it nice salsa with a bit of different texture. Very good the way it is. Also added more jalapeno to make it have a little more heat

Agree with the majority of reviews that onion is WAY overpowering.  I ended up adding about 6 more tomatoes just to balance it out!  It's definitely missing something...salt maybe, but overall OK.

I think this salsa was pretty good overall.  I blended everything in a food processor to give it a finer texture (I'm not into big chunks of tomato and onion!).  It wasn't really spicy at all and the tomato flavor was a little overpowering, but all minor adjustments.

I really enjoyed this salsa.  And even though I had to make it with dried cilantro, it still came out great!  I look forward to making it again with fresh cilantro.

For more punch add one envelope of Lawrys Taco Seasoning Mix and lower the amount of cilantro.  It is a very powerful seasoning and a little goes a long way.

Great recipe for quick, simple salsa. I found it tasted WAY better 2 days after making it. I also found you need to add quite a bit of salt to bring out the flavor. 1/2 a jalapeno will make it very mild, even my 2 year old could eat it. In a covered stainless bowl in the fridge it kept for a week and tasted great.

This was not the best, I will keep looking for a salsa recipe.  I ended up cooking the salsa till it became thick, added corn and black beans and hot sauce.  Maybe my hot pepper wasn't ripe enough because before I altered the recipe the salsa really had no spice at all.

I took it to a mexican dinner and it was hit.  I cut the amount of onion to about half and the garlic to only two cloves.  I didn't have any jalapeno peppers so I made a mild with no peppers and a extra hot with habaneros.  I used the food processor after adding everything but the peppers I took half of the salsa out for the mild and added some habaneros, processed it and I had my extra hot salsa.

This was a great recipe. My husband says "I think you are on to something here!"  I make it frequently now for a light lunch or snack for guests.  Very easy! (sometimes I even leave out the cilantro but use yellow pepper for extra flavor.)

Very tasty! I used a can of hot, chopped jalapeno since it was all I had. It was a bit too hot so I cut it with some sour cream. FANTASTIC!!  Still spicy, great flavor! Love the fresh taste! So simple to make. Even my kids loved it. Has plenty of room for experimenting if wanted but not necessary. Good post!

Great salsa! I added one serrano pepper to the mix and the salsa had a very slight bite to it. I may add another on the next round. I also used green onions instead of the regular onion.

Delicious! I love chunky salsa so this recipe was perfect! Farm bought tomatoes gave it a fresh, homemade taste. Cut back on the jalepenos if you want it more on the mild side.

This is so great. I followed the recipe exactly (which is rare for me!) and ended up with a super tasty pico de gallo (I'm not sure that I would really call it salsa, but that's no problem as far a I'm concerned). I used a whole small jalapeno and I didn't think it was too spicy. I'm usually a mild to medium salsa lover and this had just a bit of kick but not too much at all. One thing to mention: my husband and I can definitely hold our own when it comes to eating, and we had *a ton* of this left over. It was no problem for us, I put the leftovers in with a can of storebought pasta sauce and it was a delicious way to take the jarred sauce up a notch! Great recipe - I'll be making this again soon.

Delicious and easy recipe.  I used half an onion (as others recommended in the reviews), and my husband didn't think it was spicy enough.  I did chop all the ingredients by hand, which was time-consuming, but worth it in the end.  It kept it from getting too soupy.  Will make again with more heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was really craving salsa so I thought I'd try this since it looked pretty easy and delicious. I agree with others it was more pico de gallo than salsa. I cut way back on the cilantro but it still was too strong for my personal preference. I added an extra jalapeno but I still thought it was too mild. I enjoyed this but will make some changes next time. Thanks for sharing

This was actually more of a pico de gallo.  It tasted very fresh, but was missing that "kick."  All in all, however, a fresh, yummy dip!

This is more like pico de gallo to me, not really a salsa, but it was still very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up using the entire jalapeno. It's really good with lime flavored tortilla chips.

This is a bit more like pico de gallo rather than the traditional saucier salsa, but it's a good starting point. For us, it was not spicy enough (but then I'm a habanero girl myself), so we will definitely add more peppers next time. But, if you like a milder flavor, this will be perfect for you.

I love this recipe! Nothing added to the ingredient list (mine too is more like pico de gallo). I am always disappointed with the lack of flavor of most salsas. This recipe has all the flavor! I would say it takes a little longer to prepare than 10 min, but it is soooo worth it. Thanks Cecilia!

This is pretty much the way I have made salsa for years. I never really measure anything, but everything looks about what I do except maybe I add more cilantro. I do add about 1 t. of cumin for some pep. I also seed my jalapenos, spray them with Pam, and then broil them until the skin turns black before using them- it gives them a smoky flavor. I vary the amount of jalapeno depending on the crowd. To make this super easy, I do everything in my food processor. I start with the items that I want more finely diced: start with jalapenos and garlic, pulse it til small, then add everything else but tomatoes. I pulse again until well chopped and blended. I add tomatoes last and only pulse til they are roughly chopped.

Everyone likes a different heat in their salsa.  It all goes with a person's personal preference.  Myself, I thought it was way too bland and should be called more of a Pico.  For this size I tripled the Jalapenos, added a couple milder red cherry peppers, about a teaspoon of cumin, and half a teaspoon or so of chili powder.

This is a good recipe for a base or for those with mild taste buds.

I added an extra jalapeno (and all the seeds), two extra tomatillas, two serrano peppers, cumin, chili powder and a can of tomato paste. I omitted the lime juice and reduced the cilantro. I pulsed everything in a food processor and then strained off the excess liquid.

Updated 7/24/17: Made this again today - very flexible with however much of each ingredient you have on hand.  Added tomato paste (1-6 T. as you like) so the juices don't get wasted. 
 I only had 1 jalapeño, so I added a teaspoon of my favorite hot sauce - Isabel Street Heat Chipotle.   A big hit!  www.isabelstreetheat.com

It's hard to determine what is a large tomato or onion, and is the cilantro packed or loose?  I ended up with an overwhelming cilantro flavor for the 4 cups of chopped tomatoes that I used.  The flavor was good, just too much.  I have to tweek this quite a bit to get it right.

This salsa is healthy, very low calorie, easily adjusted to personal tastes, ready quickly, and tastes great.

I've made mine without onions because of a food allergy as well as varied the garlic and salt. Tomatillo and jalepeño are musts for authentic taste. Yellow or blue corn chips complement well.

Very easy to make. For that more resturant look I used a food processor with a little chicken broth. Also I used "chile de monte" or chile piquien instead of jalapeno. This is a small round chile found in most mexican food markets. It grows wild here. Also very easy to grow. Spicey but very smooth. it is small so I ground before I added seeds and all.

Thought this turned out excellently! i added a tiny sprinkle of cumin in as well, and seemed to give the salsa an extra little kick. im letting it sit in the refrigerator a bit before serving, hopefully the flavors will meld and it will get even better! thanks for the recipe!

Very good starter recipe. I made it, ate it then gave the rest away so I could make more & customize it to my liking better. I recommend doing the same. For me, too much onion, not enough garlic. I didnt use the tomatillo (honestly cuz Im not sure what it is!) But it was wonderful because everything was done with fresh garden produce. Making it again tonight.

Fantastic! My husband and I cannot eat cilantro so threw in some fresh sweet basil instead. I served it on Sunday when my son and his fiance were over and everyone agreed it was much better than any store bought they'd ever had!

A solid salsa recipe that can be tweaked depending on how spicy you want it. I cooked mine for about 10 minutes just to soften the onions, before I sealed them in a jar. Tastes even better after sitting in the jar for a few days.

I made the mistake of judging by the picture.  The salsa ingredients are spot on with the exception of needing tomato sauce.  Once tomato sauce was added .org a bit of extra lime juice.... perfection.   Great starter recipe for salsa then the cook can cater to specific taste.  Just like the description says.  Great!!!

So delicious that II could drink this! I did not have a tomatillo, so left this out. Because of digestive issues, I used minced dried onions instead of fresh onions. Must try with tomatillo next time.

This was easy to make, but just kind of bland. Most native Texans would agree this needs more flavor, and even with all of the jalapeño added it isn’t spicy.

I will never buy salsa again. Delicious!  We added extra lime as we do to everything. My husband suggested we try adding green chili’s, a bell pepper or other peppers for fun to change it up once in a while. This is perfect, though. I will make bigger batches to freeze at some point too. Thank you!

I prefer a hotter salsa, so added 3 jalepenos, and some jalapeno powder. I also lightly blistered the veggies and added a little wine vinegar to the mix before putting into the food processor. Nice base, but required a few modifications for our specific tastes.

My first time doing salsa. It tasted really good, but I may of added too much onion, it was very oniony. Also threw the ingredients into the food processor, the flavour was there but the presentation wasn’t.

This is a very nice, easy to make, fresh salsa.  I read the reviews after I actually made it and saw the recommendations to cut down on the amount of onion.  I agree.  I will probably use a small onion or half a large onion next time.  Didn’t have a tomatillo either so made it without and it was fine.

Loved it.  I used Santa Fe Grande peppers instead of Jalapeno's. I gave a jar to someone who is a good friend of mine and neighbor, they liked it so much they offered to pay me if I made them a few jars more.

First time making slasa.   I used pretty much what I had on hand.  I used some cilantro and a jalapeno from my garden and the rest I had on hand except for the lime and tomatillo.  I used 3 medium sized tomatoes.  I blended two of them and chopped the other.  I blended the tomatillo and garlic together and squeezed half a lime into the bowl.  I also added 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar.  3/4 of a large onion.  Not as much cilantro as I would like.  1 whole jalapeno, but it was on the small side.  Just the right amount of heat for me!   Love this!

Very good salsa.  I put in half a jalapeño.  We love mild salsa and this is one of the best.

I love this simple Salsa.  The only change I made and it's strictly a personal taste is, I peeled the tomatoes and squeezed them in to pieces.  Learned this from my daughters Guatemalan housekeeper and did not use a tomatillo.  I also seed the jalapeño. I like my salsa mild.

This Salsa is without any doubt one of my favorites especially with garden fresh ripe tomatoes & Jalapenos.  We do leave out the Bell Pepper....

Thanks for sharing it with me!!

Very tasty... too mild for my family - doubled the jalapeno and threw in a serrano and a dash of siracha, and it was perfect.  Used the little kitchenaid mini-food processor, just pulsed a few times to get a good consistency.   (Note - the jalapenos and the serrano were home grown and seemed very mild anyway, my changes did not make it super spicy, just enough heat. :)  )  Added probably a bit more garlic than it called for and used a sweet vidalia onion, to offset the extra heat I threw in.  It came out super tasty!  Do not skip the lime either.

I make this recipe ALL the time just as it is.  I do put it in the food processor at varying degrees of puree. Makes it easier to scoop up on a chip. Just remember the salsa will only be as flavorful as your vegetables. The fresher the better.

Added 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 1 packet of stevia and I substituted cilantro for curled parsley. I was out of cilantro and it is a great substitution. This was delicious with the additional ingredients!

Flavorful. It is waiting in the fridge for tonight (New Years Eve) and hoping that the flavors meld together after the rest. It was a lot of chopping as I made a double batch!

I had to come back here and find this so I could rave.  I made several batches of this salsa at once and hot bath canned it.  I took out the salt and replaced it with a tablespoon of vinegar for each recipe since I have found that the vinegar tames the peppers some and I don't like it when my food hurts.  I canned this in pints and half pints and I've been doling it out here and there to friends.  Last night I realized that I'm going to the Farmer's Market next week and last year's canning has to be consumed.  Imagine my delight when I found four half pints of my favorite salsa, tucked away behind the potatoes, spaghetti sauce and carrots from last year.  These four are mine, and I couldn't be happier.  Generosity is all well and good, but this salsa should stay home, too.  This year, I'll do two big batches.  One to gift and one for me!  Excellent recipe!

This was delicious!  I took the advice of the author and only added 1/2 of the jalapeño and it was plenty spicy for my northerner tongue!  I used Ohio homegrown tomatoes which added a sweetness.  I also followed other reviewers recommendations by not adding as much onion (used a little more than 1/2 cup chopped) or garlic (used 2 cloves).  I pureed in a blender 1/2 of the mixture to give it more of a restaurant-salsa consistency but it was very liquidy and a little frothy so next time I might not do that.  I had to put away the chips to stop from eating the whole recipe! ;)

This is a delicious and fast treat for an appetizer, a party or anytime. It only took about fifteen minutes to make and the flavor is really excellent. I had 8-9 garden tomatoes left after giving some to family and friends and IDK what to do with them. I didn't have enough to make sauce but my wife suggested we try to make some salsa. I thought that was a great idea; plus it was my birthday the next day and we were having some family home for dinner and cake. So we made the salsa and everyone really loved it. 

I did everything just like the recipe said and it came out perfectly. I have to admit that it sort of bugs me when ppl give a recipe one star and then go on to explain that they didn't have half of the ingredients and they substituted the other half. So we did it exactly as it was written and we all thought it was great. Much much better than jar salsa. Even better than take-out salsa from the fresh section of Whole Foods. IDK how long it keeps in the fridge because we ate it all! It was a great use of our homegrown Jersey tomatoes and a new favorite for my family.

Delicious! I'm allergic to onion, so I don't really get to enjoy jarred or restaurant salsa. I've always known it was "easy" to make but I'm not much of a cook, so I hadn't gotten around to giving it a try, until this past week I discovered that the last onion-free salsa had been reformulated and was now out of bounds for me.
For this recipe, I simply left out the onion and kind of eyeballed everything else, then pulsed it a couple of times in the blender. Both my husband and I loved it, and I can only imagine it will be even better tomorrow once it's melded more.

This was too bland for our taste, so after sampling the recipe as written, I added a second jalapeño. It's better now, but I would probably start with two peppers and adjust upward. My son never needed a recipe to make this; I have to refer to recipes to be sure I haven't left out anything. LOL

This is a really good, easy to make recipe.  I made a few modifications based on the other reviews.  I used 1/2 of a vidalia onion (diced that in a mini food chopper/processor), added 1/2 tsp cumin, instead of only using large tomatoes, we cut up a variety of tomatoes (by hand, not a food processor as we wanted chunky) - cherry/grape tomatoes, roma and a beefsteak so that there was a variety of flavors - total of 3 cups.  We threw in 2 jalapenos (used the mini food chopper/processor).  At 1st it was on the spicy side so threw in a little bit of sugar to cut the heat.  RAVE reviews from the party we went to.  THANK YOU for posting!!

The first time I made this I put everything in a food processor, big mistake! The onion juices overpowered everything else. I had to through it out.   Second time I didn't and it was delicious.  Just to be safe I only used half an onion.  I also doubled the lime juice.  Will make again.

It was an amazing appetizer, especially with homemade chips! We did not have jalapeño's so we used seasoning

I am not a chef or very good cook, but my husband raved about this, and I LOVED it too. So fresh and delicious! I am making it tonight for the second time in less than a week (but doubling it!). I did add the whole jalapeno.

Great as is...or good base to change it up!  I added about 1.5 cups chopped mango (frozen, slightly defrosted).  I made it all in a food processor.  Turned out so good with the mango!

We followed the recipe but it ended up tasting bad. It tasted too sour for me and a little too much like just raw tomato. Not sure what I did wrong.

Great fresh salsa!  I omitted the garlic, used about 1/2 white onion and added cumin powder to taste (probably about 1/2 teaspoon).  I also used canned jalapeno, because that was all I had.  Thanks!

I was looking for something to do with some tomatoes and jalapenos from our garden. This recipe hit the spot. I'm pretty sure I doubled the tomato and after reading other reviews, I'm glad I did, to keep the onion flavor down. I mixed it in the blender and hubby loved it.
