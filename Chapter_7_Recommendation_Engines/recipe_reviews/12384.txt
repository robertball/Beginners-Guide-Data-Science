DELICIOUS!!!!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! I used this recipe as a base and then altered it to my taste: I used all frozen fruit(strawberries, raspberries, & blackberies) and let them thaw for 30 min before using. I increased the sugar to 2/3 cup and the cornstarch to 1/4 cup. I added 2-3 tbs of lemon juice for tartness as well plus a little sprinkled cinnamon too. When placing the crust in the pan I suggest flouring the pan first to prevent sticking and also dusting a bit of the sugar/cornstarch mix in the pie crust before you add the fruit so the bottom crust doesnt get soggy. I cut a lattice top with the 2nd crust and brushed it with an egg wash (1 egg mixed with 1/4 cup cold water) right before baking. Baked for 20 min, then covered edges with foil to prevent burning, and baked until golden brown (30-40 min) THE BEST PIE EVER!!! There were NO leftovers! and by baking the whole thing in a disposable pie pan on top of a foil lined cookie sheet there were also no dishes!!!!

I used strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries.  The only other change was to use 1/4 cup corn starch instead of 3 tbs.  I love the pie, but it is too runny and the consistency of the filling made the bottom crust too soggy.  I just made a Strawberry-Rhubarb pie that is very similar, but called for a portion of the sugar-flour mixture to be layered onto the bottom crust before adding the fruit, and I would definitely follow that advice for this pie as well.  Other than that, it tastes delicious!

This recipe was a major success! I used 3/4 cup sugar/cinnamon mix instead. As recommended, I put another tbsp cornstarch in the mix and also some cornstarch/sugar on the pie crust bottom before putting in the mix. For the berries: 1 1/2 cups strawberries, 1 1/2 cup blueberries, 1 cup raspberries, 1 cup blackberries. The top crust I coated with egg wash and then sprinkled with some sugar/cinnamon mix. Rave reviews, and devoured!

Heck, 5 stars...I left this overnight to thicken in a cool place, which I think was key, because it wasn't runny AT ALL!  Runiness is my main problem with homemade pies vs. store-bought ones (though of course homemade TASTES better).  I used frozen raspberries and strawberries and just let them thaw and drain (fresh blueberries).  Baked for the "fresh" fruit amount of time, however it needed a bit more than 30 minutes w/o foil to brown.  Also - put a toothpick in the centre of your pie so that the foil doesn't bake into the crust.  Mine nearly did!

A bag of frozen mixed berries also does the trick. Try adding a tablespoon or two of lemon juice for a little but of tartness. Sprinkling the crust with cinnamon sugar is also good.

This is such a great pie recipe; I've made it often since I first rated it in 2001.  Both my husband and I just love it (he says it is the best pie he has ever had!).  The first time I made this, I just used strawberries, blueberries and raspberries, but I now make it with a mixture of fresh strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, as well as blackberries--this makes it even yummier!!  I also use 1/4 cup cornstarch.

This pie brings back wonderful memories of those found in old-fashioned, diner-type, family owned restaurants. The kind you drooled over sitting on the counter under the glass cover. This is just wonderful, toe-curling, comfort food goodness. I love the simple flavors of just the sweetened fruit - no cinnamon, no butter, no lemon, etc. And perfect as written - no extra cornstarch is necessary if baked until bubbly and not cut until cooled! I also liked that it was not overly sweet. I paired this with "Grandma's Secret Pie Crust," which was obviously prophetic in how this turned out, because if you didn't find this pie in that old fashioned diner, you'd find it in your grandma's kitchen.  Great combination of berries, and just the right proportions of each. We just loved it, simple as that.

EASY! I decided that I was going to try to bake once a week and since I've not ever made a pie before, I started with this simple recipe....I used 2 cups frozen blackberries and 2 cups frozen raspberries. I let them thaw out to refridgerator temperature and then used 1/2 sugar and 1/4 cornstarch. I baked it for a little over an hour until it got golden, I let it sit overnight and today I cut it and PERFECT amount of cornstarch, the piece popped out like perfection! THANKS!

It tasted good, but didn't hold toghether at all.  I called it cobbler, and it was eaten.  I used frozen fruits, but didn't drain them, maybe I should have.

Absolutely wonderful pie! I, too, used the frozen bag of mixed berries from Sam's Club. I plan on making this again and trying it as a cobbler. Great warm with vanilla ice cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon.

Delicious!  I used 5 cups of the 3 berry mix from Costco.  I also upped the cornstarch to 1/4 cup and sugar to 2/3 cup.  Nice consistency - everyone loved it!

Outstanding recipe.  I read reviews before making and increased cornstarch and added lemon juice.

Some reviewers indicated the bottom crust was soggy. To prevent this problem, I baked and cooled the bottom crust.  Then, added filling and top crust.  Did not change the cooking time or temperature.

I used the Three Berry Mix (frozen) from Sam's.  Increased the amount of berries by one cup.

If you are looking a treat...this pie will make you smile.  Topped with whipped cream.

Perfect blend of sweet and tart! I used the recommended berries - fresh, along with my own crust. I increased the corn starch to 1/4 cup and added a bit of the corn starch/sugar mix to the bottom crust before filling as recommended by other reviews. I also baked for 20 minutes on the lowest rack setting for 20 minutes at 400 degrees and then lowered the temp to 375 degrees and moved the pie up to the middle rack for another 20-30 minutes. It browned perfectly without the use of any foil.

I have made this three times using the 'best ever pie crust' from this site. With the crust, I substituted butter for the shortening. The first time I made this pie I used cornstarch and although still good, I found the taste a bit strange. I used a mixture of fresh berries. The second and third times I used 3 tablespoons of flour instead of the cornstarch and the pies were a great success. The second time I made this I used 3 and 1/2 cups blueberries and 1 cup raspberries and the third time I made it I used raspberries only. The pies were finished in one night with rave reviews.

This is a great recipe. Lots of room for modification, and plenty of consistency if you just want to follow the recipe and have a great, basic triple berry pie. I used a butter-based crust recipe instead of this shortening one and I used blackberries in addition to the other berries. A couple of tips I found useful are to brush the bottom of the pie crust (before adding the filling) with an egg white to create a barrier between the filling and crust, throw your pie pan and crust into the fridge while you prepare the filling, add a 1/4 teaspoon (or more if you like more present flavors) of nutmeg, grenadine extract, and of cinnamon, let the filling stand in the fridge for longer than 15 minutes and discard any of the fruit liquid at the bottom of the bowl before scooping into pie crust (or heat the fruits slightly and remove extra liquid so the pie isn't soggy), keep the amount of cornstarch the same unless you use a lot more fruit - cornstarch isn't tasty and even though being calorically economic doesn't make sense with this pie, cornstarch adds useless calories. Instead, to eliminate the chances of sogginess, I did a lattice top and halfway through baking, I poured out some of the "extra" liquid. That liquid makes delicious ice cream topping if you want to keep some, though. I also squeezed in lemon and some lemon zest. You won't taste either (unless you overdo it), but it will bring out the freshness of your berries. The pie was amazing and was gone in one sitting.

I LOVE this recipe! Raspberries are so expensive I alter the amounts. I also use a deep dish pie plate, so I increase the amounts of berries and sugar/cornstarch. I use: 2 1/2 cups fresh strawberries, 1 cup fresh raspberries and 3 1/4 cup fresh blueberries. I also increase sugar to 3/4 cup and cornstarch to 4 1/2 tbsp. No problem with runniness, as long as it has  several hours to set. I have made this recipe many times, it always tastes great!

The key to this recipe is 4 1/2 cups of "berries" total;  I used a pint of blueberries and the rest strawberries to reach that 4 1/2 cup mark.  I also dusted the bottom of my crust (right before adding the filling) with additional cornstarch to avoid having too wet of a bottom and it worked out very nicely.  I made a lattice on the top (it's very easy..search YouTube) since I felt guilty using packaged dough and I brushed on some buttermilk (or egg, I forget) and sprinkled sugar on top.  It took a little longer than stated to get a nice browned lattice the way I did it but it was a great pie.

Great recipe!  I only had a frozen crust in the house, and some frozen mixed berries. About 6 cups, so I used them and made the recipe as directed, but added just an extra tspn of cornstarch and a less than a quarter cup more sugar because of the extra berries.  I used the frozen crust and fruit recipe but added a "crisp" type crust Using:
3/4 cup flour
1/2 brown sugar
1/2 cup quick cook oats
1/2 cup cold butter 
and spread the crumbley mixture over top.  It was excellent.  I am not sure if the extra berries, or weight of the crisp caused the pie to overflow, but it did so make sure you put a try below it (you may want to line the tray with foil too) to save the tray and less mess.  Everyone at the family Christmas dinner loved it

Awesome does not describe this pie it was gone in just a few days by just 2 adults. I used fresh blackberries, strawberries, blueberries and frozen rasberries. I added 1/4 cup cornstarch and also added a mixture of cornstarch and sugar to the bottom. This pie set well and quick with the extra starch. Recommend to anyone that loves berries.

This pie is fantastic! I followed reviewer's notes and sprinkled cornstarch in pie crust before filling and the pie was nice and firm, no soggy crust. I used fresh fruit and willdefinitely make this pie again!

Delicious pie - I substituted blackberries from our garden for the raspberries and it was yummy. I've made it both with sugar as called for in the recipe and with Splenda substituted for the sugar and it's great both ways. With Splenda it's perfect for the dieters and the diabetics in our family. Everyone loves it and no one even knows it has Splenda in it! Serve it with a scoop of low-fat vanilla ice cream on top for an extra special treat.

This is my fall back pie and is always a big hit. I use frozen berries, then add a little orange flavoring, cinnamon, ginger and cloves.

This was awesome!  My family was all over this...  I'm about to dig in for seconds right now :-).

I added the 1/4 cup of cornstarch and squeezed half of a fresh lime in the berries for a little extra punch.

I used fresh berries, strawberries, blueberries & raspberries,& the exact amount of sugar the recipe called for, which was perfect. I don't like my fruit pie's too sweet. But I did up the cornstarch to 1/4 cup & it was still way too runny and juicy. Also you could taste the cornstarch. I will try it again. I would really like to find a pie that sets right. I've perfected cakes so now I'm moving on to pie's. I'll keep trying!!!

I made this today for Father's Day and no one could wait the extra day to try it.  It was the best berry pie I've ever made and I've tried several recipes!  At the suggestion of others I sprinkled some of the sugar/cornstarch mixture on the bottom crust before filling.  This was a GREAT tip, the crust was perfect.  I used 1 c. sugar and 1/4 c. cornstarch and 1 1/2 each cups of four berries: strawberry, raspberry, blackberry and blueberry.  I also added 2T of tapioca to the filling before baking to help thicken the filling (I was overly concerned about a runny filling).  The filling was perfect even after only cooling a few hours.  We dotted the pie with a T. of butter cut into small dice.   Finally we sprinkled the crust with cinnamon sugar before baking.  This is a keeper.  I won't be trying other recipes anymore because this is the best berry pie!

Excellent! I used about 5 cups of berries, 1/4 cup cornstarch and I sprinkled the bottom crust with some flour before putting the fruit in. No runny filling for me! Instead of doing two crusts, I topped this with the topping from "Apple Crumble Pie." It was summery and sweet and delicious!

Super easy pie to make.  I put a crumble topping on instead of another pie crust.  (Brown sugar, butter, flour)

Tasty pie.  I increased the cornstarch and sugar as other reviews suggested and I'm glad I did.  Into I might even try 1/3 c cornstarch next time and 3/4 c sugar.  All in all it was a nice change from my normal blueberry pie, verne though that remains our favorite.

Flavor was very good but even with using the 1/4 cup of corn starch recommended by others, this came out very soupy for me. Was still good over icecream, but I might try tapioca pearls to thicken another time...

I increased the cornstarch to 1/4 cup and then mixed some additional cornstarch and sugar and put on the bottom crust before adding the filling. I also sprayed and floured the 9" round. Egg washed and sugared the top crust... it was delicious. It set after 3 hours... not runny at all. I probably could have cut it sooner :)

delicious.  I did boiled the filling for a while.  Just long enough to thicken it a little bit.  I took it to a family gathering and they said they will get together every year as long as I bring the pie with me!!

Fantastic recipe!  I used frozen fruit.  Half was thawed in the fridge and drained of all liquid.  The other half had only had a chance to thaw to nearly room temp and was drained of liquid.  I put cornstarch on the bottom crust and in with the fruit.  I used closer to 1/3c cornstarch since some of the fruit was still a little frozen.  I cooked it for 25 minutes then an additional 30, cooled it on a rack then in the fridge over night.  It turned out great and even my husband, who doesn't like dessert, ate some.

If I could have given this recipe ten stars, I would have...it was sooo AWESOME!!!  We went berry picking and I used all fresh berries...a mix of blueberries, loganberries, marionberries, and raspberries.  I also, as another person had suggested, used 1/4 CUP CORN STARCH and it turned out perfect.  I made a second pie for a neighbor, who said it was the best pie they've ever had...I have to agree (and so easy too)!

This was my very first berry pie, and I have to admit..... I was nervous!! I made it for my Boyfriend for Valentines day ( its his favorite pie ) and an extra for the rest of my family. They absolutely LOVED it!! They were both gone over 2 days!! (which by the way, SO much better the second day...so if you can resist, keep some leftovers)  lol
It was super easy and fun to make, but totally go with the extra sprinkle of corn starch on the bottom and top.... you wont regret it!! Good Luck and Happy Baking!

This pie turned out very soupy.  I used frozen berried so that might be the problem.  I did add extra cornstarch to make up for the fact I used frozen berries and it didn't make a difference.

This is actually a very good pie. I used fresh strawberries and blueberries and frozen raspberries. It came out great, but I put too much corn starch and it was a little bit TOO solid. Definitely stick to 1/4 cup corn starch and 2/3 cup sugar. Its so yummy.

Terrific pie!  I used 5 cups of a frozen berry mix and needed 1/4 cup of corn starch to coat all the berries. It was GREAT! Perfectly set and just the right amount of tart/sweetness. Try it, you'll love it!!

This was the first pie I've ever made, and it turned out great!  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving!  After reading the other reviews, I decided to use 1/4 cup of corn starch.  That turned out to be perfect; the pie set up beautifully.  The amount of sugar was perfect, and the pie was not too sweet and not too tart.  I used the mixed berry mix from Costco (blueberries, raspberries, and marionberries), and I let the berries thaw for about an hour in the refrigerator before making the pie.  I'm going to use this recipe again soon and I highly recommend it!

DELICIOUS!  As others have mentioned, I upped it to 1/4 cup cornstarch and also used Splenda in place of sugar.  Used fresh strawberries and frozen 3 berry blend (raspberries, blackberries, blueberries) and store-bought crust... it was to die for, especially with vanilla ice cream on the side!!  YUM-O!  A keeper for sure!

I made this pie with the "Best Ever Pie Crust" recipe on this site.  It came out wonderfully. I used blackberries instead of raspberries as that is what I had on hand. I also used 1/4 c. cornstarch and some cinnamon.  Thank you!

Awesome!!  My family loves this recipe.  I make this pie all the time.  I use a variation of fruits, always frozen.  The only change is I added 1/4 up of constartch as suggested by other reviews.

I mixed fresh strawberries with frozen blueberries and frozen raspberries and let them sit for 1/2 hour with the sugar and cornstarch.  After the 1/2 hour, they were all the same consistency.  I baked it for 35 minutes and then the additional 25 and this was perfect.  Serve with cool whip.

I made this thanksgiving (2013) but doubled the filling recipe and added black berries. Also going over the top of the crust with an egg and milk wash with sugar and apple pie spice. This was a hit. I will be making it again soon.

I used a frozen bag of mixed berries (thawed and drained) and 2 cups of fresh blueberries.  I also used a frozen pie crust which I thawed out and used the 2nd crust to cut the lattice strips for the top of the pie.  I mixed the fruit with 1/4 cup cornstarch and 2/3 cups of sugar and squeezed half a lemon with the fruit mixture. I let it sit for 15 minutes while  I dusted the bottom portion of the pie crust with cornstarch and sugar to keep the crust from getting soggy. I then placed foil around the edges of the pie and followed the baking instructions.  The pie was very good and I served with fat free cool whip.

Made this pie for Father's Day. I followed other reviews suggestions of 1/4 cup corn starch and to dust the pie shell with flour as the pie was kinda runny. I put in 6 cups of berries (2 cups of each berry) and the pie turned out nicely - not runny. I felt the raspberries had the most flavor of the other berries and I couldn't taste the strawberries at all. It was mentioned to use lemon juice and/or nutmeg which I would do next time. I think I would also switch out the strawberries for another berry. The raspberries made the pie. My dad thought the pie was sour but I thought 1/2 cup of sugar was just right althought others used 3/4 cup of sugar. I didn't make the crust but used store bought. I would make the pie again.

Very good, simple recipe. I also used the additional tablespoon of cornstarch. It was perfect...no soggy crust.

This pie was great! I've never made a berry pie before and found it extremely straight-forward and easy to use. I used a couple of suggestions from the comments, using 1/4 cup of cornstarch and putting a thin layer of sugar and cornstarch on the bottom to keep it from getting soggy. I used all frozen berries and it turned out fantastic. We put the pies in the fridge shortly after they came out of the oven and they aren't runny in the slightest. This is definitely going to be my go-to recipe for berry pie!

This was delicious. I used all strawberries and 1/4 cup corn starch as others had suggested. I sprinkles 1 tablespoon over the crust before I put the strawberry mixture into the crust. It was very good.

This recipe was pretty good.  Not my favorite pie for sure (that would be fresh blueberry) but when made with fresh fruit it was nice and light and disappeared quickly.

I used 1/4 cup cornstarch and 2/3 cup sugar - I didn't have time for it to cool too much (about 30 minutes), so it was pretty runny, but still delicious!  Definitely serve w/ vanilla ice cream!

Loved it! Blueberries were really expensive, so I subsituted blackberries (they were really cheap!) and adjusted the strawberries and raspberries.  Definitely want to try it with blueberries sometime though!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I didn't have quite the same amounts of berries as in the recipe (just more strawberries than raspberries) but I figured as long as I had about 5 cups of berries, it would be fine. My husband, my son, and my son's friend said it was "the best pie they'd ever eaten!"  I put a little whipped cream on top.  Thanks for posting this recipe - it's a keeper!

I use Allrecipes all the time and this is the first time I have taken the time to write a review.  This pie was so easy and delicious! I also changed the cornstarch to 1/4 cup.  Coated the bottom with a lite layer of the sugar and cornstarch mixture.  My pie was not runny and cut perfect slices!  Made this for my mother-in-laws bday.  Everyone loved it!  Not too sweet. I used fresh strawberries and blackberries, and frozen blueberries and rasperberries (to expensive fresh).  Very quick, easy to make and amazing taste!

I can't even tell you the wonderful compliments I received when I made this for a family gathering. I did increase the cornstarch to 1/3 cup and spread some in the bottom of the pie crust before adding the rest to the fruit.  I used strawberries, blueberries and raspberries, put it in a store bought pie crust and put on a brown sugar, cinnamon butter crumble on top. It was not soupy and i have to say I impressed myself, lol!

I used 1/4 cup of cornstarch and 5 cups of mixed berries (1 cup of strawberries, and the remaining four cups a mixture of blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries). Tangy, sweet, and delicious. It also tastes great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This is the 2nd time I've made this receipe.  I also used 1/4 C. cornstarch, and a package of the triple berry mix from the "Club" store.  It turns out perfect.  First time I used a 9" pie pan and I thought it was a little thin, this time I used and 8" to make it thicker. Still yummy & not runny!

I made this pie in a hurry, just to try it out and get a taste of fruit. My husband said it was the BEST pie he'd had in a long, long time...it's a hit! I made it with only the frozen/thawed strawberries and raspberries I had on hand, and it came out awesome. Next time I'll use the blueberries too.

i followed the recommendations of others and used 1/4 cup cornstarch and my pie still came out a little runny.  maybe it works better with frozen berries that aren't quite as juicy.  will try it again with a bit more cornstarch and sugar.

Apparently I like my pies sweeter than most. I didn't like it much at all - much to tart. I think I'll try it again, but next time will use at least another cup of sugar. Also, it didn't stay together at all; it was incredibly sloppy. Not too impressed, but will try it again because it's so easy.

I am making this recipe again for Easter. I used frozen mixed berries of strawberries, blueberries, rasperries & black berries. I took the advice of 1/2cup sugar & 1/4 cup cornstarch...
seems to hold together better. Very good recipe-my husband loves it!!

The taste was great and I used a spritz of lemon juice because I love it with berries. However, I did use frozen berries and the increased cooking time (perfect), but with the extra time it was way too much cornstarch. I'm going to try again with less.

After reading the reviews, I baked my first mixed fruit pie.  I decided to follow the advice of many contributors. I increased the sugar to 2/3 cup, the cornstarch to 1/4 cup, dusted the glass pie dish with flour prior to placing the crust. also brushed the top crust with milk and sprinkled with sugar prior to baking.  To avoid burning my pie crusts, (besides covering the edges with foil for half the baking time), I now bake all my pies at 350 degrees, and and at least 10 min. Baking time.

I made this pie for the Fourth of July and everyone loved it!  I made a few changes: instead of using all Crisco, I used 1/3 cup Crisco and 1/3 cup butter.  For the berries I added strawberries, red raspberries, blueberries and blackberries.  Yum!

Made this several times with fresh fruit.  Not sure why sometimes there is a ton of liqiud and others not.  Wondering if it has to do with the berries being in season and having more juice in them.  I would increase the corn starch if you think you have extra juicy berries.

I made this recipe for my husband on valentines day. We both loved it! This was my first time making a homemade crust, and so the crust wasn't very pretty. I had a hard time getting the edges even, they were pretty jagged. Once cooked though, the pie itself tastes delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and used all fresh berries. I saw some others added lemon juice for tartness, but mine was plenty tart with the fresh berries! I let it sit overnight before cutting and it was perfect. Not runny at all. I would probably add some sugar to the top crust next time to add a little sweetness to the crust. This was fabulous and I'll definitely make this again!

This was good. Needed more sugar, my berries were very tart. And vanilla ice cream on the top--wonderful!

Yum, yum yum! This is the best pie I've made yet. My only alterations were up the blueberries to 2 1/2 cups and decrease the raspberries to 1 cup. Also just 1/4 cup of sugar and a little sprinkle of fresh  lemon juice.

A great recipe! I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe because we don't eat Shortening; I also increased the corn starch to 1/4C at some others recommendation. I will definitely make again!

Runny, anyone? I followed the recipe of the filling as I had a made crust already. The only thing I did was that I used FROZEN berries as apposed to fresh ones. I baked it a bit over time just to see if it thicken and to brown the crust a bit and I added in a bit more cornstarch. Still when I pulled it out of the oven it was liquid. Yummy though, but more cobbler than pie in my case.

This is my first time making a pie from scratch, and I am really happy with the result.  Followed the recipe as written but used butter flavored shortening for the crust.  I had a handful of berries to use up, so I scaled this recipe back to a mini pie.  We loved the crust, and the filling was a nice sweet tart combination.

Decent starting point for a recipe.  Like others, I added more cornstarch and also just plain flour to the filling to thicken it up.  I used 2 quarts of strawberries, 1 pint of blackberries, and one cup of frozen blueberries (thawed).  I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I also added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the filling.  I did not have any problem with the pie coming out runny.  Very tasty served slightly warmed.  I will make again adding raspberries.

Yummy!  Both my hubbie and my 3 year old said it was the best pie they had ever tasted....  maybe partially because it was the first one I had ever baked for them?   Either way, it was delicious and as easy as 1-2-3 - my daughter did most of the work!

I made this a while back and used frozen berries, and modified the sugar and cornstarch per the other reviewers. I recall it tasting excellent, but it was runny. Next time I am going to try the flour on the crust and let it sit overnight (I am sure I was tempted to dive in and try it as soon as it cooled and didn't wait!). I'm also going to add lemon juice for a little tartness.
I had an awesome mixed berry pie from a bakery and it had raw sugar sprinkled on the crust, which was a nice addition. I did that with this pie and it tasted great!

Came out delicious! I used a 12 ounce bag of frozen mixed berries and a 12 ounce bag of frozen cherries. I let the berries thaw for about 45 minutes first and added an extra half tablespoon of cornstarch because frozen berries tend to be jucier. I made it for Father's Day and it got rave reviews!

This was simple and easy!  I used blackberries, blueberries and strawberries.  I didn't use as much sugar as suggested, 1/4 C.  Also squeezed in half a lemon.  I upped the cornstarch to 1/4 C.  Turned out great!!!! Thanks!

I did not taste this, but my husband said it was awesome. I used frozen fruit, and twice as much corn starch as the recipe said. I made it the night before, so it had plenty of time to sit and firm up.

This is the first berry pie I've made and it was delicious! I read the other reviews and decided to use 3/4 cups of sugar and 5 Tbls. of cornstarch. I also used the frozen mixed berries from Sam's. It turned out great and cut very cleanly after cooling. The only drawback was that I used frozen pie crust, which was delicious, but the pie pan was too small for this recipe. I didn't use all of the recipe and it still spilled onto the crust badly. Looks bad but tastes great. Covered it with vanilla ice cream and kissed it goodbye! I will make this again and again.

Super easy recipe and so easy to customize.  I used fresh berries and added more cornstarch as others indicated.  I would add even more of the mixture to the bottom of the pie the next time so the bottom isn't so soggy.  That was the only draw back but how fast every one scarfed it down I didn't hear any complaints.  It was only the 2nd time to make a pie and I will be making it again and again this summer as different berries ripen.  I did put a pizza pan underneath my pie pan and I am glad I did.  I put a little more berries in than called for so it had some run off but was easily cleaned up from the pie pan.  I am going to try a deep dish pan next time and load it up and adjust sugar/starch mixture.  It is too good not to make as much as you can.

The pie was delicious. I increased the cornstarch just a bit -- but I may not have needed to. It was not runny at all after sitting for about two hours. I added a bit of lemon zest which always brings out the flavor in berries. I also added a pinch of fresh cardamom. My family loved this pie.

Absolutely delicious! Instead of a three berry pie, I made a two berry pie with fresh raspberries and marionberries. Added an additional half a cup of sugar, but other than that no other changes. Let it set for a few hours after baking and it was not runny at all. Definitely will use this recipe again.

I used frozen berries. I found a bag of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries all mixed. I got 2 bags of those and it was absolutly dreamy! I made it for my husband because he loves fruit pies. I normally don't care for them, but this one was super! Already made it 3 times lol. Can't wait to make again!

Yum!  I made this pie when my parents and sister came over for a visit, and they were all amazed that this was made with frozen berries.  I used two bags, one a mixed package containing blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries, and the other all raspberries.  Great pie!

Wonderful recipe, thank you! I was excited to find the recipe that called for the exact berries I had in the freezer! I used 1/4 cup cornstarch as others suggested. I didn't drain, I just went with the longer cooking time.

This pie was a big hit at my recent cookout.  I used all fresh fruit and organic cane sugar. I did increase the corn starch to 1/4 cup because I added 2 cups of blackberries to the recipe and I knew  there would more juice because of it.  It was just a little runny, I had no problem plating this pie. The combination of sweet and tart berries  scoop of vanilla low fat ice cream MADE it. A beautiful presentation, easy to make and everyone loved it.  thank you.

Wow!!! This is the first berry type pie I have ever attempted.  And, how good is it?  AMAZINGLY good.  And, better yet?  Amazingly easy!  I used all fresh strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries.  Added a bit more sugar (just under 3/4 cup) and a fourth tbs (1/4 cup) of cornstarch.  Did the lil' sugar/cornstarch on the bottom crust trick - works beauty!  (Also, for aesthetics, brushed the crust and fluted edges with one beaten egg)  Will definitely make this again!!

Just your basic quick pie.  I should have doubled the corn starch and sugar because my fresh berries were much juicier than I planned on them being.  The pie was a bit too runny.

Berrilicious! You must up the cornstarch to ¼ C. I used a deep dish pie crust and 1 bag each of raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries along with a pint of big fresh strawberries. Poo, next time I'll use all fresh berries as I didn’t like the frozen berries taste. Very good and easy to whip up type of pie. Be sure to line your cookie sheet with foil or you'll be soaking a berry juiced gunk pan for days. Serve with fresh whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Will make again!

I thought this recipe was great! I used rasberries, blackberries and blueberries, all frozen. I also spread some of the cornstarch mixture on the bottom crust before adding the berries. This was my first fruit pie that I've made and I couldn't be happier with the results or the ease of the recipe. thanks!

Excellent. Bon Appetit! This is the best berry pie recipe that I have ever found. We loved the texture and the sweetness was perfect. We too followed the advice of some and used 1/4 cup of cornstarch. We liked it so much that we made another pie the next day!

This pie was very good. All of my in-laws commented on how much they enjoyed it. I used 1/4 cup starch as others had suggested, which set it up nicely. The berries I used were frozen and even though I let them sit for 30 minutes, they didn't soften at all and as a result, there was a lot of loose powder (sugar & starch). However, everything blended well. Personally, I like my pies a bit sweeter and thinner, so I will probably increase the sugar and decrease the starch the next time.

I would like to start by saying I am pie challenged.  I have never made a baked pie that turned out edible.  DH's favorite food is pie!  This is a problem!

This pie turned out FANTASTIC!!  I didn't have raspberries so I substituted cherries.  I used all frozen fruits (what I had) and thawed completely.  Baked according to fresh directions.  I also took the suggestion of otehr reviewers and used 1/4 C cornstarch.  Beyond that, I increased the sugar a small bit (MAYBE 1/4C) and because I had them in the cupboard, threw in some dried cherries (striaght from the package).  

DH ate 3 pieces the first day!  And even BIL who doesn't like pie, complimented me on how good it was.  Excellent adn easy recipe!!

I really loved this recipe. I just bought 2 bags of frozen mixed berries from wal-mart. I think it came with blackberries in it as well. They worked great, afte thawing. I found i didn't have to cooke it quite as long as the recipe said for frozebn fruit. Very gooey and delicious!

This is a good pie.  I made it with blackberry, blueberry, and strawberry and I was pleasantly suprised with how it turned out.  The cornstarch made it a little bit too syrupy, although I am sure you could remedy that in your own kitchen. Very good when made with fresh, organic fruit and served with a lemon sorbet!!

Very good, with fresh or frozen fruit.  I found I had to leave the foil on for an additional five minutes to keep from overbrowning.

This has awesome flavor.  I used fresh strawberries and raspberries but frozen drained blueberries.  I added more fruit because I like a fuller pie.  However, I don't know if it was because I added more fruit but it was quite watery.  I'll add more cornstarch next time.  The only other change I made was adding a splash of vanilla to the berries.

This was my first attempt at pie making. The crust was perfect, got burnt a little bit in the edges. I tried to do a lattice top. As some others suggested, I added a little bit more of corn starch & sprinkled some of the sugar & corn starch mix on the bottom before putting the berries mixture. Will definitely try this again with other fruits

I used all frozen fruit and some of the adjustments from the previous reviews. I put the foil on for the first 20 and then took it off for the last 35.  I put some of the cornstarch/sugar on the bottom to protect against the seeping of berries. I did add more water than was called for (amost double). It was good, but it needs a few hours to set or its runny. I would have it cool for 3 hours or so. Even at about 1.5 hours, it was pretty good mixed berry pie.

I'm on a mission to use up what I have, so I used a store-bought box of pie crust and a frozen 1 lb bag of mixed fruit. After the fruit was defrosted, there seemed to be a lot of juice, so I drained it. It didn't look like much, so I also added about a cup of defrosted blueberries. Following some suggestions, I sprinkled cornstarch and sugar on the bottom of the crust. Into the fruit mixture I added about 2/3 cup of sugar, about 1/4 cup of cornstarch, and a few shakes of cinnamon. After attaching the top crust, I made various slits around and cut out a 1-inch circle in the middle (you could actually see the insides bubbling in there when I took it out of the oven!). I just sprinkled the top with white sugar and a little cinnamon. Baked at 350 for 20 min, then covered the crust edges with foil and baked just over an hour. Some reviewers mentioned it was runny, so I cooled it, covered with foil and placed into the refrig (planning to have tomorrow), but couldn't wait and had it after ~3 hrs. Sliced beautifully with no runnyness, good sweetness and perfect tartness. It was great with vanilla ice cream! Nice comfort food during the beginnings of a blizzard! Thanks Jenn!

My mom said this is the BEST pie she's ever had. My husband and I LOVE it as well. I have made this pie twice in one week. It's delicious. The tartness depends on how tart the fruit you use it. I changed a few things as recommended by others. I did 1/4 C. Cornstarch and 2/3 sugar. I tend to have to bake it longer than recommended. The crust is perfect. This pie is delicious.

I used fresh raspberries & blackberries plus frozen blueberries (thawed & drained) and added 1 tsp cinnamon & 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the filling. I made this an open-faced pie with no top shell, baked it at 350F for 45 minutes, and then set it in the fridge for two hours before serving and it thickened up no problem!

Made this with pre-made crust and strawberries and raspberries only (just because that's what I had on hand).  I loved it, but even though I love tart and sour things, I have to say this was sour even by my standards.  Maybe the blueberries make the difference, but I will add more sugar next time :)

I made this using frozen mix of blueberry raspberry strawberry and blackbeery and used 3/4c sugar 1/2c cornstarch used most of it in the berry mix and the remaining in the bottom of the crust to keep from getting soggy (although I used my own crust recipe) I added some butter before putting on the top crust and it turned out great topped with vanilla ice cream

I did use a different pie crust recipe (Pie Crust IV), and upped the cornstarch to 1/4 cup as suggested by others. This came out so good! I used 24-oz of frozen mixed berries and it was so delicious. I've never used frozen fruit before and loved how easy this pie was to throw together. It got great reviews from the guys who enjoyed it after dinner tonight and went beautifully, still warm from the oven, with some vanilla ice cream. Definitely will use this one again!!

This review is only based on the pie filling and cooking times/temp.  This is the first berry pie that I have ever made.  It was AMAZING and it was so simplistic!  I loved the fact that there was only 1/2 of sugar to 4.5 cups of berries.  The consistency was perfect, the cooking time was great.  I had rave reviews in my home!  My husband said it's the best berry pie he has ever tasted.  I went easy this time(because it was 100 degrees in our house), and used a pre-made pie crust and did latice work with the second pre-made pie crust, but next time, I will have to give this pie crust recipe a try as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Substituted 4.5 cups of frozen mixed berries, and 1/4 cup cornstarch. The set was perfect, but could have used more sugar...very tart!  Overall a simple and nearly fail proof recipe!

This pie is amazing! I used fresh blueberries, blackberries, strawberries and frozen cherries that I thawed and drained well. I added extra cornstarch to the fruit mix and also a bit of cornstarch and sugar to the bottom of the crust before I filled it. I love this recipe and will make it often.

This pie filling recipe was excellent and easy to make.  It wasn't runny.  I made 2 batches, refrigerated one whole pie overnight and it came out terrific and even better. I will make this again.  I cheated with the crust and used the roll-out Pillsbury pie crust, 1 was for a crust and a half crust for lattice top.

I don't personally eat pie, but I like to make it and this one is great. I've made it 3 times and once I had to use blackberries instead of raspberries and according to the people who ate it, it was great.

Good recipe. Definitely use more cornstarch though--I used a 1/4 cup plus sprinkled a sugar/cornstarch mixture on the bottom and it was still a bit soupy. I think I'll add some vanilla and cinnamon next time as well. All in all though, a wonderful summer pie!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  The berries were particularly juicy, so the filling was a bit too liquidy.  I just added a bit more cornstarch, and it turned out perfectly!  Will DEFINITELY be making this one again.

Spectacular!  I used frozen strawberries, frozen blackberries and 2/3 cup dried cherries.  The extra juice was absorbed by the cherries.  I used 1/4 cup cornstarch and would add 2-3 tablespoons more.  Mixed with sugar and put 1/2 the mixture on the bottom of the pie, really helped to keep it dry.Also added 1-2 T lemon juice.  Just used a refrigerated crust with egg and water on the outside.  This will be a MAKE AGAIN.  Even my husband asked what happened to the rest of the pie.  We ate it, fast!

OMG delicious! I increased the cornstarch and sugar as others mentioned and added 1 tbp lemon juice and topped it with an egg wash and some cinnamon sugar very good, I cooked just as directions called using fresh fruit I used blackberries instead of strwberried because thats what I had on hand it was a perfect, used a roll out dough too and made it a fancy pattern on top, not bad for a non baker!

I used blackberries, blueberries, strawberries and raspberries.  It was phenom...going to make it again today!  I will add some more cornstarch though, because it was a bit runny. I also brushed egg wash on the top.

I used a little more cornstarch on the filling, as advised, and it didn't turn out runny at all.  My sister proclaimed it to be "the best pie she has ever tasted."  That's pretty high praise!  I used the frozen mixed vegetables and the recipe for "simple flaky pie crust" to top it off.  I was very pleased with how it turned out.

Great pie! I would give five stars, but it needed more sugar than the recipe calls for. I used more like 3/4 of a c and used flour instead of cornstarch. I used blackberries in place of the strawberries as well. Delicious!

Mmm, delicious!!  I made this pie with the "Oil Pie Crust" (another recipe on Allrecipes.com), and it tasted great!  I think a crust that isn't too flaky would work better with fruit pies.  Anyways, I used this recipe with frozen strawberries and blueberries, and fresh blackberries and raspberries.  I did made minor changes though, such as following the reviewers' suggestions of using 2/3 c white sugar and 1/4 c cornstarch.  The pie came out a little too sweet for me, but that's just my own taste preference.  The filling was also a little runny, still, so next time I will increase the cornstarch even more, and probably use the original amount of sugar.

Good for how simple it is. I just used a bag of frozen berries and mixed a few fresh strawberries I had with it. I bought frozen pie crusts but couldn't find the double pie crust, so I cut the second pie crust into strips and made a grid for the top. It looked great and no one knew the difference!    Serve with some yummy vanilla bean ice cream.

This recipe is delicious. You can change the berries to any type you like. I added extra strawberries and less blueberries for this pie. I also added marionberries and an additional Tbls. of cornstarch. I brushed the top with beaten egg and it came out perfectly! After letting it set for about an hour and a half it wasn't runny at all. The recipe is delicious, the pie is already gone!

Delicious, easy pie to make.  I used a combination of fresh and frozen berries. Remember that frozen berries add a bit more liquid, so add a little more flour to thicken it up!

So simple and FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe exactly as written and the pie turned out perfect. I was amazed at how it held together when I cut and served the slices. It was a huge hit. I will definitely make again. The next time I may use a sugar substitute just to cut back on calories.

Instead of making one big pie, I made 30 mini pies using a mini-muffin pan and they came out cute and delicious!  I used a mixture of frozen berries and used tapioca instead of cornstarch (which I always use for fruit pies and highly suggest).  Maybe it was just me, but my pies needed more sugar, so I will add more next time.

Good.  I used too few berries for fear of run-over and overdid the cornstarch since most of my berry pies end up runny so it had kind of a weird textured bottom but otherwise it was good.

Very tasty, but the filling had too much liquid, even with 1/4c cornstarch.  I used frozen berries, which I thawed for 20-30 minutes before baking, but maybe I should have let it thaw longer?  I wound up baking it for 70 minutes.

An easy fool proof recipe that tastes amazing. I've always been intimidated by fruit pies, but this was sooo simple and delicious. I increased cornstarch to 1/4 cup, and used all frozen raspberries, strawberries and blackberries. I even used frozen crusts, but you would never guess. My husband, an artist, used the leftover pie crust pieces to make the flower pattern on top, then I brushed it with egg white so it was shiny. Really great recipe. Loved it!

This pie was great! I took it to a potluck and it was a big hit. One person even said it was the best pie they had ever had. I added blackberries, increased the cornstarch to 1/4 cup and used store-bought crust. Will be making this again!

Fantastic recipe - I will be making this one again for sure! I went with the other's suggestions and added the 1/4 cup of cornstarch and after 90 mins of cooling it was absolutely PERFECT. The pieces popped out perfectly and the pie tasted just as good. Thanks for a great recipe!

We used fresh raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries and it was delicious! We subbed 4 tbl flour for the cornstarch and the filling was not runny at all. Taking the advice of putting a layer of the sugar/flour mixture on the bottom of the pie was brilliant - the bottom crust was flaky and not soggy. We used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe on allrecipes.com, doubled for strips on top. Best pie we've made!

I made this recipe last Christmas for my family and they loved it!  I used Splenda instead of sugar to make it diabetic friendly for my grandparents and it tasted just like I used sugar. I also substituted flour for the cornstarch because I was out of cornstarch and that worked just fine. Will be making again for family gatherings.

This pie was so easy.  I read the directions, and it still seemed too easy as I made it.  Turned out simply delicious.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Ok, the berries were good, but needed about another half cup of sugar.  I used the 1/4 cup of cornstarch and I might as well have not used anything.  It was way too watery.  I even let it sit for about 7 hours before cutting.

This pie is perfect in every way !  I used fresh fruit and frozen pie crusts and it wasn't runny at all.  The pie looks and tastes fabulous.  Serve with real whipped cream, it's a hit every time.  Extremely easy to prepare, too !

this is a wonderful, easy dessert. I used two bags of frozen mixed berries, and added a bit of honey to the fruit to cut down on the tartness and it was perfect! Look foward to making again.

Excellent!  Thanks for the recipe!  I read the reviews before making this pie.  I did use two bags of frozen mixed berries (just shy of six cups) and ready-made crust.  I followed the recipe amounts for the cornstarch and sugar.  The pie was a bit tart, but not too.  The consistency was perfect:  not runny; not stiff.  I served the pie with softened vanilla ice cream. This recipe is very fast and easy to make (tho not inexpensive) and looks/tastes like you spent the day in the kitchen.

Good Pie!  I used all frozen fruit and substituted the cornstarch with 3 TBSP of minute Tapioca.  A little too tart for my taste but the frozen fruit may have been the culprit.  I will try again with fresh fruit.

I pretty much followed the recipe, with the exception of adding about 6 cups of fresh & frozen fruit.  I did add blackberries to the strawberries, raspberries & blueberries.  It was WONDERFUL!!  My husband loved it.
Have made it twice in one week!!!

So good and so simple!  I had bought strawberries and blueberries while they were on sale so this was a terrific way to use them both.  I think since I just used more strawberries in place of the raspberries, the filling wasn't as tart as others have noted but I didn't have to add more sugar.  My boyfriend said this was the best berry pie I've made and I've made a bunch so I'll be making this one again!

I used 4 1/2 cups of frozen mixed berries. I made a graham cracker crust because this was a joint project with my toddler.  Instead of the top crust, I topped it with the custard recipe from Berry Custard Pie, also on AllRecipes.  I halved the sugar because I like a tart berry pie.  The fruit set up beautifully.

EXCELLENT!!  Who woulda thought something SO simple could be SO good.  I'm not a baker by any means....I used a frozen fruit combination (raspberry, blackberry & blueberry) and (as suggested by other reviewers) added 1/4 cup starch. Sooo good. This will be made again.  I topped with whipped cream also.
Yummyyyyyyy.

Definitely add the corn starch and extra sugar.  For those who found it too tart: this isn't really a pie (especially if it doesn't come out thick)- should have been labeled a cobbler.  Just throw some vanilla ice cream on top and it's fantastic!

Wonderful!  I used a mixture of fresh and frozen berrys.  It was great!  Can't wait to get more fresh berry and make this again.  My husband said that this was the BEST pie her ever had.  i used a mixture of sugar and SPLENDA to cut out some of the calories.

Excellent!  I used mixed frozen berries - next time I will up the cornstarch, I don't think I'll drain them.  Perfect amount of sugar if you don't like your pie too sweet.

I used blackberries because that is what I had on hand and the pie turned out delicious, although the strawberries are not real noticable over the taste of the blueberries and blackberries.  A hit at our 4th of July picnic.

Love this!! I used all 4 types of berries- totaling 4 1/2 cups. It was runny still warm, but the next day was "firmed up." I'm also thrilled by the pie crust recipe I found on this site- Pie Crust III. It uses canola oil, so it's not so unhealthy! Believe it or not, it was tasty & flaky,too!

Definitely 5 stars PLUS ... delicious combo of flavors and so easy to prepare.  1 pint blueberries, 1 pint strawberries, capped & sliced, 1 16-oz. bag quick-frozen raspberries AND 1 /4 cup cornstarch + the sugar and you've got a winner!

I made a different crust to go with the berries. delicious the way it is! I used frozen berries and probably put a little more of each berry. then followed the cook time for frozen berries and it was great! I was surprised that when I cut it the filling didn't leak out from the rest of the pie.

Just great. Definitely take the advice of other reviewers when it comes to using frozen berries. I did 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar out of necessity and added in 3 TBS of lemon juice. Perfect for how we like it: kind of tart and slightly sweet, so the berry flavor comes through and adding ice cream isn’t over powering sweet.

Easy recipe. I made my own dough, and followed some of the advice of other bakers. 

2/3 cup of sugar
1/4 cup of corn starch
1 tbsp of lemon juice
1 tsp of lemon zest
1 tsp of cinnamon

added blackberries as well to the recipe

save a bit of the sugar/cornstarch mix for the bottom of the pie dough

My first time making a baked berry pie it turned out amazing the crust was perfect and the filling not too sweet!!! The pie was gone within an hour! Made it again and will continue to use. I did add a tbsp of brown sugar and a cap of raspberry syrup and a tbsp extra of cornstarch also a tbsp extra of water for dough for my second pie.

Perfect pie! Use fresh fruit if at all possible. I took the advice of the top rated commenter to spread a bit of cornstarch and sugar on the bottom to prevent a soggy crust. I do that with all my pies. I also used her egg wash suggestion and sprinkled a little sugar on top of it. Delicious and perfect for the 4th of July!

Butter instead of shortening in crust, made it crumbly and couldn't roll it out properly but was able to press it into the pie dish. For the top, I crumbled the second half of the dough on top and pressed firmly over the frozen berries. Added a egg white wash over it and sprinkled large sugar granules on top. Was amazing!

It was simple, and delicious. I used closer to a quarter cup of corn starch, and added lemon zest to the berry mixture. Also, I used a quarter of the half cup of sugar to macerate the berries, and then drained them before adding the rest of the sugar and the cornstarch. The filling was PERFECT. It held its shape when sliced, and the juices didn't overtake the crust. will be making it again. And i just used the berries that i had on hand, which happened to be blueberries, blackberries, strawberries and cherries. it was great.

This one is a keeper!  I used 5 cups of fresh berries, used 1/4 c. cornstarch, and baked it one day ahead of the gathering I took it to.  The filling is not runny at all.  Great berry dessert for summer fresh berries!

Delicious perfection on my first try! Our birthday guest’s favorite so I made two pies for a party.  For each pie, I used 5 cups of frozen mixed berries, thawed them in a bowl of warm water, drained well, then followed ingredients/instructions exactly. Did put a sprinkling of flour/cornstarch on the bottom crust  at the suggestion of others. Filling will look runny and liquid-y but don’t panic. Baked as instructed and they came out beautifully! I did bake them off about 5 hours before serving, so they had a chance to cool completely. Perfect filling that held together, not runny at all! Note: all pies, if served warm, will be somewhat runny. If you allow the pie to cool completely, the filling will gel and hold together. It’s just down to personal preference.  Tasted delicious, not too sweet. SO many compliments! 10/10, will definitely make again! Thank you!

This was such a hit over Christmas, that I was really glad I made two.   I am a diabetic so I used Truvia baking blend instead of sugar.  I think these first two pies could have cooked a little longer.  I am making it for a dinner party tomorrow night, so that will be something I change .  This could be the substitution of ingredients that changes the cooking time.  Delicious!  Everyone wanted another piece!

I follow the directions for the sugar, cornstarch and the 5 1/2-6 cups of fruit. My pie turns out every time. I vary my fruit-some apples, blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, rhubarb. As long as I have several fruits that equal about 6 cups, I have a great pie.

Really good. Everyone liked it. It was not so syrupy sweet like some berry pies. I used a thin 10" pie plate -- would have been better with a taller/deeper  9" one but I only have the 10" -- worked out OK.

LOVE this pie! It is my go-to recipe for summer berry pies. You can play with the berry combinations as long as you keep the total amount of fruit about the same. I typically use my own all-butter crust recipe for it. I have also made it with a crumble topping instead of a double crust and have used the filling on its own with a quick crumble topping as a cobbler. Love love love! I also prefer using minute tapioca as my thickening agent in fruit pies instead of cornstarch, this berry pie is no exception.

This pie is a great dessert! I recommend adding a little butter to the crust after the pie has finished baking. Make  sure you're using the right sized pie plate, or you won't have enough dough. I would recommend this pie to anyone!

Simple, easy pie recipe! For whatever reason, pies have always seemed scary and difficult to me. I really wanted to make a fresh berry pie while visiting family in northern California (with all its many road side fruit stands), so I searched for a recipe that was as basic as you could get. And to make it even easier, I opted for a freezer deep dish pie crust for the bottom and a refrigerated roll-out crust to make a lattice top. Good heavens, it was easy and soooo delicious. I have made two and they are incredible. The hardest part is waiting until it's completely cooled (very important). It sets up nicely: not too runny & not like gelatin. I may be a pie maker after all! (One day, when I've gotten over myself, I will attempt the crust from scratch!)

Make sure your pie filling is bubbling hot. I mean bubbling! I have made this recipe numerous times with different frozen berries and I just realized that  the way to make sure the filling isn't watery, regardless what the crust looks like, is to make sure the filling is bubbling hot! I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch, 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice, grated lemon zest from that lemon and a heaping 1/2 cup of sugar. I used as many berries as I could to make a mountain in that pie crust. I also prebaked my pie crust for 7 minutes and I covered the pie crust edges with foil for the first 50 minutes of baking ( I used frozen berries). I also egg washed the crust and sprinkled it with cinnamon and sugar. No pictures because we scarfed the whole pie down with vanilla bean ice cream so fast...a keeper of a recipe!

My family loved this recipe! I used the refrigerated pie crust from the store and made the rest as is. I had to add more strawberries to fill the pie as it didn't fill high enough as it was. I sprinkled the additional strawberries with a little sugar and toss them in. It was wonderful! You could use what ever ratio of berries you'd like but the strawberries are definitely what make it sweeter. Add more raspberries if you prefer a bit more tartness.

Thank you for the suggestion to put a little of the cornstarch and sugar in the bottom of the pie before the fruit. Crust turned out perfect! The pie was a big hit! I used fresh strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. I did increase cornstarch to 1/4 cup and 2/3 cup sugar. The filling was firm not runny and not too sweet. Delicious!

Turned out great! I didn't make the crust according to the recipe - tried out a gluten free crust made of walnuts & dates - that was lovely too!

I used premade crust and just used the recipe for the filling. The filling I chose to use was frozen strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. I found that the filling had a great tartness to it and wasn't overly sweet at all. If you prefer sweet berry filling, I suggest using more sugar. Otherwise, I thought this pie was perfect all by itself, although vanilla ice cream could be added for that sweet factor.

The recipe gives instructions for using frozen berries which, at this time of year, I did. I made the pie the day before also as suggested. It turned well. Will make it again.

Yum! Simple, fast, and perfect. Since the berries were so sweet, I did not need to use sugar. (I used maple syrup) I used raspberry, blueberry's, black berry's, and strawberry's. For a healthier pie, I used oat flour and whole wheat flower instead of all purpose, and worked well. I would have taken a picture, but the family ate it before I could! It made my thanksgiving.

Perfect  I thawed my berries in fridge before using them. I used  my own crust.And as another suggested, I increased the corn starch to 1/4 cup and added a bit of the corn starch/sugar mix to the bottom crust before filling as recommended by other reviews. I also baked for 20 minutes on the lowest rack setting for 20 minutes at 400 degrees and then lowered the temp to 375 degrees and moved the pie up to the middle rack for another 20-30 minutes. It browned perfectly without the use of any foil.

I have made this several times and every time it was delicious!! I use a store-bought refrigerated crust, which makes this recipe so fast and easy! I've done it with both fresh and frozen fruit, but if using frozen I give the fruit time to thaw and drain. So quick and good!

I used strawberries, blackberries and aronia berries. Pie was wonderful. I have lots of blackberries frozen so definitely will be making this again and trying some new fruit combinations.
I did use 4 tbs of cornstarch as others suggested and it was perfectly thickened. I also used frozen fruit which I just placed in a bowl and put on defrost before proceeding. I used a little more sugar, 3/4 cup  and liked the result better the second time I made it. I think the kind of fruit used will dictate how much sugar is appropriate as some fruits are more tart than others. I substituted aronia berries for blueberries which adds some tartness. Also, I have used citric acid (1/2tsp) to add tartness. I keep tweaking the recipe but love the results. Have made this pie many times and it keeps getting better.

This was good. I used strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and I had a couple of peaches that I threw in as they needed to get used up. I had doubled the fruit as I had enough dough for 2 pies. I too added more cornstarch (1/4 cup per pie). Without, it would've been pretty soupy. Finally, I added a bit of cinnamon just as a personal preference.

I used strawberries, blueberries and raspberries for this pie.  The pie turned out perfect and was so good.  Everyone enjoyed it very much.  After reading  many of the reviews, I used 3/4C sugar and 1/4C cornstarch which worked very well.  I put 1/4C of the sugar/cornstarch mixture on the bottom pie crust before adding the rest of the  berry/sugar/cornstarch mixture.  Wonderful pie and will make again.  I used Ruth's Grandma's pie crust which was a 5 star winner.

I've made this wonderful pie several times and it is always a hit; it's particularly good with vanilla ice cream.  Guests nearly always ask for a second slice.    Each time I make it, I use whatever assortment of fresh berries I have on hand.  The filling has never come out runny for me, but I drain the berries well after washing them and I've never used frozen berries (which tend to have a more watery consistency).  By using refrigerated crust that only needs to be unrolled and placed in the pie pan, this is one of the quickest pies to make.

I make a lot of berry pies in season.  I looked at this recipe to see the proportion of  the different berries and read a few reviews.
When I saw that some get a soggy bottom crust I immediately checked the temperature of the oven in this recipe.  The 375F temperature is the culprit.  Berry pies need a hot oven of 425F and less time.  I cook mine for 20 minutes with the foil and 15 minutes without for a total of 35 minutes and the crust is never soggy, no need to sprinkle anything on the crust before adding the fruit. 
I also use flour instead of cornstarch.  It is important to let the mixed fruit/sugar/flour sit for 10 to 15 minutes before adding it to the pie pan (particularly for rhubarb or you may end up with lumps). The amount of juice in fruit varies considerably and it's not always possible to get a fully gelled interior; a bit of liquid is not a failure.  In general, the earlier in the season of the fruit, the juicier that fruit will be and the amount of flour I add varies accordingly.

This was really good.   My husband loved it.   I did not have raspberries and substituted blackberries.   Also added a little lemon juice, and upped the corn starch to 1/4 cup.    I'll make it again!

I did not use the pie crust recipe.  I substituted turbinado cane sugar for the white sugar, using a little less.  My family has already requested another pie the next time we get together, so definitely repeating!

I made this today for Easter. It was a huge hit! I did need to add extra fruit in order to fill out my pie crust, but the tart raspberries against the sweet blueberries and strawberries were a great combination.

I'll be honest, most recently I made this with blackberries in place of raspberries, but I have no doubt that the raspberries would have been amazing. I also used a different crust recipe, but again, the filling was so delicious that I can't imagine that making much difference!

First of all this pie is delicious and I heard the same thing from my coworkers! I did happen to read the reviews and thought it was a good idea to add another Tbs. of cornstarch to the mix. I did leave off the foil in my convection oven and I'd have to say it turned out perfect. I was happy I modified the recipe slightly and did not go overboard with it. This pie is so easy and quick to make, I just love it!

I made this with frozen raspberries, blackberries and blueberries and baked it as directed for frozen berries.  I also used the tip about putting a little flour in the bottom of the pie plate and a little of the sugar/cornstarch mixture in the bottom of the crust before adding the berries.  I was using a 10-inch pie plate, so I used 1.5 lbs. of berries, 2/3 c. of sugar and 1/4 c. of cornstarch.  Turned out great, not runny, not too sweet.  I'll make it again.

I used another crust recipe, but for the filling, I followed the recipe to the T - no changes whatsoever, except for the cooking time, and it was delicious! I read in some of the reviews that it was runny for some, by mine turned out without any runs.

Used a glass pie dish. I had to cook it way longer than the recipe called for, to get my crust a nice golden brown. Let it cool at room temperature (overnight on a windowsill) for 24 hours, before cutting into it.

Pretty good pie. It was runny, and like others said, putting it in the fridge overnight helped that a little. Still yummy though!

Delicious! Increased the sugar and cornstarch as suggested, and used blueberries, BlackBerries, and strawberries. It was a hit at Easter dinner.

Amazing! I made three of these pies as part of a wedding pie display (instead of wedding cake). I used ready-made sweet shortcrust pastry and also frozen berries, replacing the strawberries with boysenberries. I thawed the fruit first and strained the juice before adding to the cornstarch and sugar. Also added another tablespoon of cornstarch and a good squeeze of lemon juice to the berries. After adding berry mix to pastry shell (berries very broken down at this point) I added some individual frozen raspberries and boysenberries so there would be some berries that retained their form. This pie was best left to cool for at least four hours, preferably overnight, which gives filling time to set. The pies received rave reviews and I have had many requests for the recipe.

I have made this recipe many times. It is always a smash hit. I do not do a traditional top crust, but rather a crumb topping....which is made with 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of butter. These are creamed together with a pastry blender and sprinkled on the pie. I bake it for about 50 minutes uncovered at 400°.

Absolutely perfect pie filling!!!

*note -- I did not use the crust recipe -- I used rolled crusts due to time constraints.

Followed the recipe for the total amount of fruit, but used a different mixture of berries based on what I had, also including 2 small peaches.

The ratios of fruit, sugar, and cornstarch were right on.  Not the least bit liquidy like others complained: be sure to bake it until it's bubbling fully, and that you cool completely before cutting.  

Making a lattice top crust shows the berries beautifully !

I've made other types of berry pies, but never with Strawberries.  While the pie tasted good, I was disappointed in how soggy the bottom crust was.  I did add additional corn starch and sugar to the bottom of the crust before filling with the fruit but it didn't help.  I also chilled the fruit to no avail ( I used fresh fruit--could that be a problem?).  I don't feel the instructions really did a good job of addressing this issue.  If I do make this again,  I will par-bake the bottom crust so that it can hopefully withstand the liquid from the berries.  I also think the recipe missed opportunities to improve the appearance & taste of the pie by recommending an egg wash and super on top.  All in all, a recipe that could use some help.

I made it with frozen strawberries and blueberries, and even though I increased the cornstarch to 1/4 cup it still came out very watery. The filling was also too sweet, maybe it would work with raspberries and blackberries, but the blueberries were too much. The crust was great though (made with butter instead of shortening because that's what I had). I brushed the top with butter and sugar and it came out nice, tender and crisp. I wish I had pre-baked the bottom shell before putting in the fruit, though, because it came out kind of doughy.

This pie was sooo good. I used all fresh fruit, and added blackberries. I let it cool for 2-3 hours before slicing and it was still way too runny. Put it in fridge over night, and it was a little better the next day, but still runny. Will make again with 1/4c cornstarch as others suggested. I also used the "Grandma's Secret Pie Crust" recipe, which was perfect.

Good, Basic Pie recipe. I followed it exactly the first time I made it. It was good-  a simple pie. The next time, I added more sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, lemon juice etc to the fruit mixture to liven it up a bit. I also used already made pie crust to save time.

I dusted the bottom crust with extra flour before adding the fruit . This helped absorb some of the liquid. Turned out beautifully nice flavour.

I have made this more then once using thawed and fresh berries.  Both times it was watery after baking!!!!  I have upped the cornstarch to 4-5 TB with fresh and used 7TB with the thawed.  When I made it the first time I thought chilling it would help thicken it.  After it chilled it was still watery so I just froze it and then to serve BOTH pies I would only thaw long enough to cut and then serve in a bowl with ice cream the family liked it that way but this just is a watery pie.  I know others have comment on that and others say it's perfect.  I will keep looking! :(

I used all fresh strawberry and blackberry, increased cornstarch to 1/4 cup as recommended, added 1 TBSP of lemon juice and added some cinnamon and sugar on top of my pie (after glazing with egg). It was great, we loved it! (I did however used a very good pie crust recipe and not bought one)  Very recommended as a fresh berry pie!

Love this recipe because it is so simple. Always a very big hit. I use fresh fruit and the last time I used 1/4 Splenda instead of sugar. I agree that adding a bit more cornstarch helps the filling set up better.

I didn't have ultra high expectations for this recipe, I just wanted to use up some berries. I was surprised how great it turned out! Gels up perfectly (we hate runny pie) and I used a pate brisee (is that spelled right?) crust. Great recipe!

Delicious!  I used fresh strawberries and blueberries and thawed out some blackberries.  Like the other posters I too upped the cornstarch and it did take longer than 30 minutes to get a nice brown on the crust.  It was an amazing pie though!!  Nothing but rave reviews from everyone who ate it!

Wow, this was incredible!!  This was my first experience at pie making.  I couldn't be more pleased.  It was so easy, with no unusual ingredients to buy that I may never use again.  I used only raspberries (fresh picked from my own bushes).  I took the suggestion of others and increased the cornstarch to 1/4 cup and added an additional tablespoon or so of sugar.  I also let it cool on a rack for approximately 5 hours before cutting/serving.  It was absolutely perfect!! Not too sweet and not runny at all.  The only problem I have now is that I will need to start going back to the gym on a regular basis again as I have a feeling I will be baking pies often.  :-D  Thanks, Jenn for such an amazing great recipe!

I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site to make this into a tart instead of a pie.  I blind baked the crust for 15 mins, added the extra sugar/cornstarch on the bottom and it turned out great. I let it sit overnight so the consistency was perfect. Not too sweet and got rave reviews from my family.

Just made this pie, easy recipe. I used the 3 tbs. corn starch but will try the 1/4 cup next time as it was a bit runnier than I like. Give it a try with other fruit as well. thanks for the recipe!

Love this pie! Used the extra corn starch and mix on the bottom, egg wash on top with cinnamon sugar, and let sit overnight. Perfect! Had a little extra pie crust and fruit so we made a small mini turnover size pie on the side for a "I can't wait until tomorrow" treat!

This is a super easy and excellent berry pie recipe. Very comparable to Marie Callender's. But the filliing was too runny. Next time will put more cornstarch. Also filling was not enough, will need to add more. Otherwise, VERY GOOD recipe!

Fabulous!!!! A new family favorite.  We froze the remainder of the pie dough we prepared Thanksgiving week so the whole pie was so easy.  We plan to make it again for New Years Eve.

The folks at our weekly neighborhood potluck loved this pie, and I appreciated how easy it was to make. I served it a la mode with Purely Decadent coconut milk ice cream vanilla bean flavor, and you could hear the oohs and ahhs as people took their first bite.

This was my first try at a pie, and it turned out pretty good. I'll try it again with a few adjustments. For a crust I made the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this website. I used mostly frozen mixed berries rather than fresh, therefore I followed the directions for frozen. I used a deep dish pie pan instead of a 9-inch. Next time I use the deep dish pan I will either double the filling or make 50% more. I think the berry filling could use some more sugar, so next time I will add more.

Followed exact. Used all fresh fruit. VERY VERY runny even after sitting for eight hours before cutting.  Still tasted good though.  Mostly can just taste the raspberries  which is good because I'm not a huge blueberry fan.

This is Amazing pie. I added some blackberries and 1 apple to help "fill" the pie. I halved the sugar and added 3 packs of splenda. You DO NOT have to ADD more CORNSTARCH if using FRESH BERRIES. My husband and I are health nuts and this is the perfect dessert for us!! I added a bit of powder sugar to our slices.

I made this (first try) for my parents this weekend and my mom (who is a wizard in the kitchen) said it was "amazing!" I used fresh strawberries and blackberries as well as frozen blueberries and raspberries. I was worried my bottom crust would be soggy so I used 1/4 c corn starch, as others suggested, and it was perfect! It set nicely too. I let it cool completely (before they arrived) then reheated in the oven about 8 min. and served with vanilla ice cream. WONDERFUL!

This pie is soooo good! I used blackberries instead of blue berries and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. I took the advice of the others and used 1/4 cups of cornstarch. I may use a little more next time because it was still a bit runny, but we still ate it all!

Yummy pie but very runny.  I even used some extra cornstarch and let it sit for 3 hours after coming out of the oven before slicing it.  Doesn't matter tho, still delicious!

This pie is excellent - I only rated it 4 stars though because I had to change some of the amounts of the ingrediants.   Like others I upped the cornstarch to 1/4 cup and I added an extra 1/4 cup sugar to cut down on the tartness of the early spring harvest berries.   I also added a splash of orange juice.   This pie set really well and was a hit at home and at work.

The Pie was very tasty!!!!!!! But it had one problem it is too watery!! It said to add cornstarch and sugar together! well next time i make this i am going to mix the cornstarch with water than add the cornstarch mixture to the sugar mix and than add the  cornstarch glaze to the berry's maybe that will sock up the berry juice.

This is the best pie. I hate super sweet pie and I can eat this pie for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Which is a little scary really. I used 2 bags of frozen berries adding up to roughly 5 lbs, and accidentally forgot to buy white sugar so I used brown. I did take the advice to add a total of 1/4 c of corn starch. Absolutely amazing. Even better the next day.

My pie TASTED good, but looked awful! I blame that ALL on my inabilities in pie baking, I've never rolled out crust before. I was aiming to use frozen berries but they ended up thawing a bit before I bake the pie so it was a little runny. I let it sit in the fridge overnight and it was still a little run, but I blame that on my partially thawed fruit! I AM going to try this one again, now that I know more about what to do!!

Phenomenally good and very easy to make. I did double the cornstarch based on others' reviews, and had no trouble with watery consistency. I love to make pies, and this recipe has become my new favorite. Took it to some friends' house for dessert, and even the husband who "doesn't really like pie" gobbled it up and took seconds.

Great pie!  I like to use strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries sometimes, but the pie is great with either berry combination.

I was forced to make this pie just from strawberries 'cause blueberries/raspberries were extrrRRRRiiiimely expensive at the store (for about 7 dollars per 1/2c!!) but still came out very good. I guess next time i will reduce the amount of cornstarch 'cause this morning the strawberry filling was too dense and stiff!! Anyways, i'm looking forward the summer season when you can find prices to suit every pocket!!!! I added an extra tablespoon of sugar and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. As usual, i made the french pastry pie crust from this site, it never fails!!!! Thanx for this great recipe!!

Yummy combo of berries.  I wasn't sure about the strawberries, because I've never had a baked strawberry pie before (only the fresh kind) but they turned out yummy.  I just wish this recipe called for a little more fruit- maybe more blueberries and raspberries, because I would have liked more.  I cut back on the sugar a little and kept the cornstarch the same.  Perfect tartness.  Very easy to make too, the hardest part was rolling out my pie crust!

Everyone thought this was great! We have blackberries in our backyard so I used them instead of the raspberies. Not to juicy, just right. I have tried many berry recipes and this is the best! It's a keeper!

The taste is good, but the consistency is very runny, even after using 1/4 c starch. I will increase the starch next time. This was a snap to put together!

Absolutely Delicious!!! Every one in my family loved this pie. I used fresh strawberries and blueberries, but used canned raspberries. The raspberries were in syrup so I drained them. I think that the juice in the raspberries from the syrup really added to the taste! A great recipe and one I will be using again!

I tried the 1/4 cup of both sugar and cornstarch and it was too tart for me, so next time I think I'll try 1/4 cup of cornstarch and 1/3 cup of sugar. Other than that it was great!

Delicious! I made this wonderful and EASY pie for my son's birthday and everyone loved it. I used 1/4 cup of cornstarch and fresh berries...raspberries, blueberries and strawberries. It was expensive being off season for berries...but worth it! I will definitely make this again!

Simple and enjoyable. I'm not much of a baker or a big fan of sweets, but finding myself with more frozen berries (a mix of raspberries, blueberries and blackberries) than I knew what to do with and company on the way I threw this together. It was a hit. The only changes I made was to add a little cinnamon & ginger and an extra bit of berries & cornstarch. Served with frozen vanilla yoghurt (or ice cream) you get a nice balance of flavour & texture.

Perfection!  There is nothing better than summer fresh fruit that's perfectly ripe for a recipe.  This pie at 1/2 cup sugar is just the right level of sweetness.  Relatively low in calories and fat, this pie is a delicious way to enjoy a treat without packing in the calories.  I shared the pie I made using this recipe with family and we all agreed -- 5 stars!

This was very easy and very good.  The filling set up so nicely with the cornstarch.  We loved that the taste of the fruit came through without that sugary taste a lot of pies have.  Will definately make this again.

This pie is great!  You can also use Blueberries, Raspberries, and Blackberries...it is so good.  Add a little tangyness to it and add some fresh berries (without the sugar and corn starch to the top of the other berries.

My husband requested a berry pie for his birthday, but I was a little leary since I'm not a big pie maker.  However, this looked easy enough so I thought I would give it a try.  I used a mixture of blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries as well.  It came out perfect, and everyone loved it!  I will definitely make it again.
