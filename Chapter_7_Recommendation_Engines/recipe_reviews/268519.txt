I loooove this recipe! I  upped the chili flakes for my family's spicy palate but made no other changes. First batch is gone, so I bought more cukes for round 2. Delish!

I couldn’t find brown mustard seed, so I just doubled the yellow mustard seed. Also tweaked the red pepper up by double. And I will never need to buy pickles again. These are better than anything you’d find in the supermarket and cheaper to make than you’d find them in a specialty store. And they couldn’t get a lot simpler to make either!
