Made recipe as written (minus the optional whiskey but with vanilla extract instead), it looked beautiful when poured into ramekins but after chilling it has turned into something not pudding like. It was very firm/thick. I did like the flavor of cinnamon with the chocolate. The consistency turned us off though. A bit of butter at the end may help that issue.

This is a great recipe, perfect as is. I added orange essence instead of cinnamon and a tsp of sherry instead of whiskey.

very easy, and I added 1/4tsp of Chili powder and a dash of Cayenne for a Mexican style twist. Could have added a bit more of each... :)

I made this pudding and put it in a graham cracker crust.  It was magic...
