I made this for my husband's company cookout that they're having today. It was so easy to make (a little time consuming to chop up the cookies and slice the strawberries, but not really that bad) and it turned out just like the picture.  I substituted French Vanilla pudding for the vanilla pudding.  It was yummy!  I'm making one for a party we're having at home this weekend and my kids are so excited. Very festive for the 4th!
