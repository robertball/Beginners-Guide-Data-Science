Cajun Rainbow Carrot Fries Haiku: "Color me surprised. Carrots blah, but these? They're great. Fun & flavorful." Rather than measuring out all of the spices indicated by the recipe, I took the cook's suggestion in the description and used a Creole seasoning blend (from an AR recipe that I keep well-stocked in hinged glass jars from the craft store, fill with spice blends, and give as gifts.) This was a big time-saver for what turned out to be a side-dish success, and even moreso because my picky toddler clamored for all of the purple "fwiez."

These are really tasty. I made them in my airfryer. They do get soft after a while, but they are delicious nonetheless. Thank you for the recipe.
