This recipe was sooooo good!!!  The flavors from the Green Chilies and the Pepperoni go so well together~  I tried serving with Ritz Crackers and Tortilla Chips and found that the Tortilla chips were the best.  The only thing I did different was instead of baking, I put it in the crock pot.  Just stir it every so often, and it is perfect!!

What a hit!!  To avoid the greasyness of the pepperoni, I microwaved them on a paper towel for 1 minute and then added them to the mixture. Bye, bye grease.

I was looking for something quick to take to a football party and this was perfect.  I just put all of the ingredients into a crockpot and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it.

Very good dip! The guests at my party devoured it. The next week my husband suggested using the same combination of ingredients to make a pasta sauce. I warmed and melted the ingredients in a frying pan. It was wonderful over noodles. LOVED IT!

this is a favorite in my house! the only thing i do differently is I use the mini pepperoni's beacause they are easier to scoop and i heat them in a pan on the stove and then put them on papertowels to catch all the grease before I make the dip. that way there isn't a puddle of grease at the bottom of the dip.

This is a great recipe, easy to make. I cut it in half but used about 8 oz of sour cream. Cut pepperoni in smaller pieces, and added some parmesan cheese. I also made it on the stove. Let it cook for about 15 mins. I didn't need it till the next day. It's an easier way then turning on the stove in the hot weather. It was a big hit, has a little bit of kick to it.

Great dip as written.  Everyone at a recent potluck looked at it pretty funny, but was a hit!  Even the kids liked it.  Only changes were before baking, placed a layer of whole pepperoni on top to give a better hint as to type of dish.

I brought this to work for a potluck and everyone loved it.  People were actually bragging that they had the recipe!  It was a little spicey for me but I would definitely make it again for mass consumption!

Turned out pretty tasty, I admit. Although I think next time I will halve the ingredients this made a LOT of dip.

I made this using the reduced fat (not fat free) versions of the cream cheese and sour cream. I also used turkey pepperoni. I thought it was good, but just a little too meaty for my taste. Next time, I'd probably use about 3/4 of the pepperoni called for.   I'm taking it to work tomorrow and will be interested to see how it goes over.

I made a half recipe of this using plain low fat Greek yogurt (2%) instead of sour cream, reduced fat cream cheese and about 5 oz. of turkey pepperoni, and it was divine. It seemed like an unusual combination and I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it was very yummy and had a tangy but not overpowering spiciness. I think it would have been too greasy for me if I had followed the original recipe, as my version turned out sort of crumbly rather than gooey, which is how I prefer cream cheese based dips.

I am addicted to this dip.  I made it exactly as written and it was perfect (maybe a little greasy, but what can you so about that?) Served it at a Halloween party and the guests loved it as well!

I cut the recipe in half since I was making it as a snack just for myself. This was so good, the moderate amount of refridgerated leftover dip was gone by the next day. Don't eat this cold though (I took a swipe at the dip with a finger one night but hey, I live alone so why not?!). It is considerably better hot. I made mine in a mini-crockpot and heated up the rest later in the microwave. Both methods of cooking (or reheating) rendered a consistently good dip. I especially liked it with a hot, crusty loaf of French bread. But then, I especially love a good French roll with almost anything. Cheers!

We loved it!  We heated the pepperoni in the microwave first to get rid of the grease.  We cut up bread pieces and everyone agreed that was the best because it complements the flavor.  I used gluten free sweet potato cracker from Costco and they were good too.

Excellent dip!  Needs to be kept warm.  Baking is just about heating it up so I recommend a just putting it in a slow cooker.  That's what I ended up doing after I took it out of oven.  I really liked this but everyone else loved it!

This was fantastic!  I used 3/4 of the recommended amount of pepperoni and it was perfect...a huge hit at two recent get-togethers.  Please give this a try, you'll be glad you did!

Always a hit whenever I take it to a party! My family LOVES it. I have made this many times. This last time I did put the pepperoni on a paper towel in the micro for a min as per Stephanie's suggestion and it did help cut the greasiness!

This recipe was okay but not amazing.  Still keeping the recipe in case I feel a little sassy and want to jazz it up a bit the next time.  I think it's a good base with potential, but it just didn't knock my socks off.  Yet.
