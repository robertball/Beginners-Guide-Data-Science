I've never eaten kugel before, so I have no comparison to make.  I like the fact that it can be made in the microwave (not heating up the kitchen), and we did like it, although it was a little dry.  That well could be just a matter of adjusting the time, as I know microwave temperatures can vary.  Next time I will check the kugel at 5 minutes during the final cook cycle, rather than setting it for 7 minutes.

11.9.18  This seemed like it should be covered - at least with a paper towel - while baking.  I checked geniuskitchen.com - that's what came up with a "Microwave Apple Kugel" search - & same exact recipe & not covered.  Huh.  Well, I didn't cover, but felt I should stir after or during.  'Never had kugel before.  'Kinda odd.  'May be one of those things that you "grow up on" to love.  'Wasn't bad at all, just different.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
