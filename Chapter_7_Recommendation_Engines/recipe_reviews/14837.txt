My son and a friend wanted to have Guacamole for a snack, and I had never made it. I read the reviews of others for this recipe, and the version I prepared won rave reviews from the guys. I used fresh lime juice instead of lemon, decreased the olive oil to 1 tsp and added 1 clove minced garlic, 1 tbsp chopped cilantro and 1/4 cup chopped tomato to the rest of the ingredients. It sat for less than 5 minutes as it got eaten too fast! My son says it's the best Guacamole he has ever tasted.

This is a good base recipe, but for really good guac, you have to add some fresh cilantro.  I would also omit the olive oil, and add a little cumin and a tomato.  Or even roasted tomatillos if you have the time.  I'd also use lime juice instead of lemon.

You can't have guacamole without cilantro.  I would leave out the oil, add some fresh chopped cilantro and chopped tomato.

This recipe was only O.K....I had to use 3 avocados instead of two because once I added the oilve oil, it was  very oily!  I will use less oil next time!  I also added some salsa to hide the oil taste.  However, once I chilled it for a couple of hours, it was much better.  Everyone enjoyed it at my dinner party.  I will make it again but definately use a little less oil.

Kids are in school and I'm alone for the first time in two months with the computer all to myself! I personally love guacamole almost any way it's prepared. This is a good basic recipe which I often make when it's used as one of the layers with my mexican dip, without the oil. When serving alone, I like to add some roasted red peppers, onion and garlic powders and a little cayenne for a bit of a kick. Such a refreshing dip!

This didn't impress me too much.  I may have had smaller avocados then the write used, becuase mine came out way too lemony and oily.  I have found an even simpler and tastier recipe from the CA Avocado Commission that I use regularly now.

I have made this recipe 3 times in the last week, and plan to make it again today.  It's that good. 

I once forgot to add the Olive Oil, and wondered why it was so thick.  If you don't normally like Olive Oil, then don't add it.  The Lemon and salt reminds of drinking Margaritas!

It lives up to it's name.  I would suggest, though, not using so much lemon.  Overall a great recipe.

An excellent tip to keep your Guacamole from turning brown without having to add lemon or lime juice. Do not discard the seed, when you have finished seasoning your Guacamole simply put the seed back in the bowl with the Guacamole, it keeps it from browning.

Way too lemony!!!!!  After doubling the avocados, to try and kill the intense burning lemon flavor, it is still very strange tasting.  4 avocados later, I am stuck with a huge bowl of guac that is one of the worst I have ever tasted.  Too bad; I was looking forward to it!

Thank you Kathy and all the others who have reviewed this recipe before me. As suggested by members, I added some cilantro, garlic , red onion, jalapenos and around 1/2 tsp olive oil...This guacamole rocks! I actually polished off quite a bit of it while making and before even refrigerating.. Very good.

I made this - not very impressed. Don't know why everyone rated it so high.  I did find out though when buying avocodo's to be ones that are very soft. No place did I see this in the notes. I had a hard time getting them mushed. But not many ate it and I followed the recipe to the exact. Will not make again.

This is amazing stuff. On par w/dos caminos, rosa mexicano, etc.... love it. Sometimes I'll throw in onion powder or whatever. Best served cold! When I make it for BBQs, people attack it... I've learned to make double! serve w/chips!

The recipe is a great basic recipe.I added a pinch of salt just to add a bit more flavor to it I also used  onion flakes. rather then chopped onion. One could add additional Items to the base to make it more for ones liking.I also put it in the refrigerator for a few hours to let all settle.

Great recipe but you must add garlic.  Garlic will make the dip PERFECT.  You can add minced garlic or garlic salt whichever you have on hand.

I will go back to using lime juice instead of lemon.  Missing the garlic, tomato, and cilantro. Good, but not the best in my book.

I added a little more lemon juice and used kosher salt because it had a strong olive oil taste at first. It was absolutely delicious and super easy to make!

I love the basic recipe, but the oil is not needed, as rich as avocados are already. Also , add a chopped tomato for perfection!

I always get compliments on this guac :) I usually add the suggested amount of ingredients, but always end up adding more to my taste. I use salsa instead of tomatoes. It makes it easier then chopping onions and tomatoes and other veggies. You just scoop some spoonfuls of salsa instead and it gives it a better flavor anyway.

Taste like lemon and nothing else. We really had to doctor this up with garlic and some homemade salsa.
Still toooooo much lemon.

If you like your guacamole bland, then this it the recipe for you.  It was very good but lacked 'zip'.  I will omit the oil next time.

Good basic recipe! With the price of avacadoes being what it is, I like to add a little sour cream to stretch it. I also add crushed garlic and cilantro for flavor.

I leave out the oil, sometimes use lime instead of lemon and usually add diced jalapenos for a little extra kick!

Sorry to give this 1 star but this recipe just didn't suit my taste buds and I thought I would like it cause it reminds me of the method we use here in Trinidad to make "choka" from lots of different veggies (and some veggies which are classed as fruits.) I even added in some chopped up habanero pepper to make it more like choka. But I think I will stick to eating my avocados plain cause all I felt I tasted were lemon and onions and none of that wonderful sweet avocado taste :(.

I have used this recipe for years.  I find it amusing at how many people rate this recipe after they make several changes.  My family loves this recipe just as it is.  It has a delicious pure avacado taste.  Sure you can add other things to it, but please try it as is because it tastes wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great base for guacamole! I used fresh lemon and lime juice, decreased the olive oil to 1 tsp, added 1 clove minced garlic, 2 tbsp chopped cilantro and 1/4 cup chopped tomato.I used it for fajitas and it was delish!!

After reading the reviews I altered this recipe a bit.  First, I used 4 avocados, guac. goes so fast.  I used a half of a larger lime's juice... I added half a diced  tomato.  I used fresh cilantro (from a clear plastic box found near the veggies at the market). And I used some garlic paste (like 1 tsp).  Oh, I did not use any oil either.
I am serving this with hint of lime chips. I had 2... o.k. like 5 chips already and they were super delish!

I think that this is a great base.  I made it today and I tweaked it a little to suit my pregnant palette.  I prefer things spicier and saltier, this was a little bland for me.  I am going to submit my own version of this I think, I am thinking fresh jalapeno (1/2-1 depending)and cilantro!  Thanks Kathy!

Terrible! Omit the olive, substitute lime for the lemon, add 1 T sour cream and 1 T pico de gallo.  In other words, use a competely different recipe.

As many others have noted, great base recipe but I sure don't see how this can serve 16!  Not in my family anyway!  I used 4 avocados but the same amount of everything else.  It was not greasy at all due to double the avocados.  Like others, I added a clove of garlic, a chopped tomato and cilantro.  It was very good after that. Use more avocados!

I was given a beautiful homegrown avocado & decided to make some impromptu guacamole, but had few ingredients.  I left out the oil & mixed in some freshly made pico de gallo...omg.  I had no idea such few ingredients were needed to make primo guac!  I'll make it this way from now on.  Thanks for sharing this!

Very good!  but I added to it with fresh chopped jalapeños, red bell peppers, roma tomatoes, corn, and a bit of chopped iceberg lettuce.  And I substituted lime for lemon!  of course!
it has become one of my staples and i make it by habit!  rave reviews from everyone I know, including my eighty year old english grandmother who doesn't like anything but meat n' potatoes!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I normally make guacamole to taste and without a recipe, but decided to try one to see if there was a difference. I garnished with tomatoes and onions and ate it with baked tortilla chips. I realized after I started eating it that I forgot the olive oil! I had never heard of putting olive oil in it anyway. I thought it was a tad lemony, but maybe it will stay a bright green color this time in the fridge. I did use probably a little less lemon, than what was suggested, and I also chopped the onion quite small. The main thing that surprised me about the recipe was the 16 servings, I was lucky to get 3 small servings. I will make this again, when I don't have all the ingredients of my typical guacamole, leaving out the olive oil as I did this time.

No tomato, no sweet onion (crucial) and no dash of hot sauce.  Other than that it was workable.

Yum! I liked this recipe's simple taste.  Whipped up a batch to add to a 7-layer dip, so I didn't get to try it plain except after the flavors had really melded.  But it was yummy even when it was just made.

Love the overall basis of this recipe, but I don't ever use olive oil; the avocados are fatty enough. I substitute lime juice for lemon, usually about 2 tablespoons instead of juicing a fruit.  I also add about a tablespoon of cilantro to give it a nice flavor.

Not 'best guac' but maybe 'base guac'.  This used to be my usual guac recipe, but when I just pulled it out to make it and gave it a look over I wondered why I ever even used it.  Only 2 avocado for 16 servings? No cilantro? Lemon instead of lime? I must have really tweaked it because remember using lime, garlic, cilantro and more avocado in my guac and it came out good with those additions, but as written just doesn't cut it.  Sorry but I put the printed recipe in the recycle and came online to find and print a new one.

Too much oil, in fact, I make it without. Use Hass avacados for better flavor. I also add a pinch freshly chopped cilantro and a dash of onion salt. Tastes GREAT with Tostidos lime tortilla chips.

I wasn't too sure how this was going to turn out. I didn't have any limes so I squeezed a fresh lemon into the mix. I added just a couple of tablespoons of sour cream to this and it was divine! It is good both ways with and without Sourcream!

This was my first time making guac and this recipe was easy and delicious!!  It went up against another guac, with salsa and beans in it, and this guac blew it out of the water!  Everyone loved mine and told me how much better it was.  Sometimes simpler is better!

This is AWESOME with the following changes:  use only 1 Tbsp. of olive oil. use sea salt instead of table salt but do not change the amount, use the juice from 1/4 of a lime instead of the lemon juice & use chopped red onion instead of white or yellow.

This guac is really easy, but I don't  see the need for olive oil.  I a,m sure there are other reviews that state this, but you need other key ingredients to amke good guac.  I appreciate this recipe in that it started me on my search for a good recipe.  I took this recipe and omitted the oil and lemon juice, added 2 seeded and chopped jalepenos, one small deseeded and diced tomato, 2 tbs lime juice, and 1/2 teaspoon cumin.  You have to refridgerate for at least an hour. I liked the result.  Thx for a good base recipe

Way too simple to be called Best Guacamole. It tasted a bit bland and seemed like there was something missing. Leaving out cilantro & tomato is like a disgrace to Mexican food.

well, to be honest, I found this recipe very bland.  That is not to say it isn't good for most people......I tend to crave flavor and heat with most things that I eat.  I added about a cup of hot salsa to it, more garlic.....and something that I just found in a gormet store....Peach Ginger Habanero Hot Sauce!!!!!  Now this was a cosmic combination....why cosmic?  Because you see stars!!!!   I added about 3 or 4 tablespoons of the PGHHS to the other stuff that I listed and this recipe was out of sight!!

Simple and delicious. My first try at guacamole and it came out great.  One comment though is to make sure you have ripe avacados in time.  The supermarket's avacados were not ripe.

This was the best guacamole ever.  I added 1 1/2 TBS fresh cilantro, ½ TBS fresh chervil, ½ of a small tomato, ½ tsp garlic powder and used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  I also omitted the olive oil.

I used lime instead of lemon, omitted olive oil, pressed a clove of garlic for the guac, and added some tomato on top. It was really good and easy! My company really enjoyed it.

Basic recipe, but 5 star if you add half of a diced jalapeno, fresh mashed garlic, more real lemon juice, and a few re hydrated sun dried tomatoes. Make sure you season with salt and pepper to taste and don't liquefy the avocados. They should have a few small chunks.When selecting the avocado, it should be turning black and already very soft.

Ok, so this was FANTASTIC with the following additions, as recommended by another user:  chopped cilantro, scallions, a SPLASH of olive oil, 1 cap-full of white vinegar, a splash of pace salsa, and 1 tbsp. sour cream for creaminess.  Also, I only used the juice of 1/2 of a lime and I omitted the onions altogether.  *HINT* Leave the avocado seeds in the guac until serving time, this keeps it from turning brown!

Delish! I had never made guacamole before, so I stuck with the recipe. Next time I plan to add a few of the ingredients other reviewers suggested. Will definitely make again!**Made this again today..I followed other reviewers suggestions by adding lime juice, garlic & tomatoes. This put it over the top! I ate it all by myself!! I need to make another trip to the store-lol! I will definitely make this again & again**

This was pretty good.  Based on other reviews, I added cilantro and a tomato, and 2 cloves of garlic.  I think the add-ins made it. I would eliminate the salt next time, as it seemed really salty since the chips we used were already salted.  Also, based on someone else's recommendation, I put the avocado seed in the bowl and the guacamole did not brown the entire 1st day as it normally would.

This is the best Guacamole recipe I have had. It was so quick and easy to make. I brought it to a party, and it went quick!!! Even the pickiest eaters loved it and asked me to make more, once it was gone! I also added fresh chopped tomato (I removed the seeds), and I also added a dash of fresh ground black pepper. Next time I make it for a gathering I will double the recipe!

This is a good starter recipe, but it could be a real winner with the addition of just a couple of ingredients.  Adding in chopped cilantro and tomatoes would really liven it up.  Also, maybe a little hot sauce or finely diced jalepeno would be great.

Way too much olive oil. The taste of the oil overpowers the avacado. Next time I will taste it before adding ANY olive oil because I really don't think it's necessary.

Tasty and super-simple!  After dropping a bag of ripe avocados down the stairs, I had to make something out of them fast... miraculously, this recipe called only for ingredients I already have in my minimalist kitchen.  My boyfriend loved this guacamole, and couldn't believe it was homemade (and accidental)!

I did not like this recipe.  Aside from making sure the avocados are ripe, they should be chilled prior to making the recipe.  I like to make a salsa of diced jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and cilantro with salt and garlic powder and some water.  I add some of the salsa to the avocados and then add salt to taste.  This by far makes the best guacamole.  That is how my parents and grandparents served it in their restaurants for almost 50 years.

As my friend was making this, I read the ingredients and thought it would not be good.  I was right.  Avocados are oily naturally, they do not need additional oil added.  Try dicing one avocado, and pureeing the other and then add them together.  Garlic, lime, salt, and cilantro are perfect additions to this wonderful fruit.

It sounds like a good base.  I will be adding in tomato and garlic. However, I am here mainly to say, no cilantro does not have to be added to make a good guac or salsa or whatever. There is a chemical in cilantro that causes it to taste exactly like soap to some people, so to me it would be exactly like shaving in a bar of Ivory.

I like this recipe for Guacamole. I like it because the taste of the avocado is not overpowered by other ingredients. I like to grate the onion in and do so to taste and also add the lemon juice to taste. I used a full lemon's worth of juice. I'm thinking it would be great with lime too.

I totally agree that this needs cilantro. I added a tomato, but didn't have cilantro on hand and I really missed it!  I also skipped the olive oil.

I used lime juice rather than lemon, only used 1 tsp of olive oil, added 1/4 cup chopped tomatoes, and added 1 clove of minced garlic along with the onion.

I've made this twice now and it is fabulous! It is kind of plan so I did add some cumin to give it a little spice, hence the four stars. I doubled it the second time to use up a bunch of avacados and served it at Easter and it was a hit! Definitely my go to recipe and will make a lot for sure!

Awesome recipe!, so simple and tasty! I usually double it and add extra onion since i love onions and a lot of ground pepper! You can easily add more lemon juice/olive oil to your liking! :)

Made some modifications, but it was delicious!  Lime juice instead of lemon...added some cilantro...used less than 1 tsp of oil.  DELICIOUS.  Everone raved...it was almost gone before the "technically" started.

I do use lime juice and I use about half package splenda or l tsp. sugar.  This just brings out flavor to its fullest without making it sweet.  I also use a bit of green onion sometimes.  So many ways to make it.

I really liked this, very basic. Never put oil in my guacamole before, so I gave it a shot. Not bad. I will try this again, maybe with garlic added. But was worth totally making.

Fabulous!  I've never made guacamole before even though it's one of my favorite things to eat and I have high standards for my guac.  This was so easy, fast and most of all, delicious.  Like others I added some minced cilantro and some diced tomatos for added color.  Letting it sit for an hour or 2 in the fringe will ensure it doesn't taste lemony so be sure you make it a little ahead of time.  Sooo good!

This recipe is excellent.  I had never really cared for Guacamole, until I took two sailing excursions in Mexico.  The cook on board made his Guacamole quite similar, except he used coarse salt and garlic to taste.  He said cilantro was optional and did not use it for the sail since not everyone cares for the flavour. I used the two avocados, but added the other ingredients to taste.  Ole ... a winner!

This recipe is missing alot. You absolutely have to have cilantro and lime. Not lemon. Lime. I also added tomato,jalepeno and salt and pepper and left the oil out. I like mine chunky, so instead of mashing it with a fork, I just cut the avocado into a small dice.

avos already have a nice natural oil so DO NOT add, it will take away from the flavor. Fresh cilantro, garlic and salt is all you need. I like it with fresh vine toms for color and red onion for some crunch. That is what is nice about all recipes, make it your own.

I have made this recipe for years.  My only difference is I omit the Olive Oil and put in a tablespoon of hot salsa.  I also use more onions than this recipe.  I get requests for it all the time.  The lemon juice helps keep the guacamole from turing too brown.

Excellent base recipe. Other reviewers have made great suggestions, adding garlic, cilantro, chopped tomatoes and the like. I personally made the recipe as is, omitting the olive oil and adding 2 tblspns of salsa. Just mashed everything together with a fork for a quick snack, delicious!

Guacamole is traditionally made with lime not lemon and would have cumin and cayenne. Avacados are rich and don't need any extra oil. 
This recipe is ok, but doesn't need any oil because avacados are oily. Also use lime, it'll taste closer to the real thing.

Just wonderful! I made a couple of additions/substitutions for personal preference. For 8 servings: 1 T of lime juice to replace the lemon, 1/4 t onion powder for chopped onion, added 1 1/2 cloves of garlic, 1 T of cilantro & a bit of cumin. Too Yummy - Thanks!

This is a solid quac recipe, but I agree with other reviewers: use only 1/2 the oil called for.  I also think you should use less salt.  Solid, tasty, easy recipe, but make the suggested changes.

This could do without the olive oil. Also some cilantro, garlic, tomatos, and shalots makes it better. It is too plain with the ingredients listed above.

Definitely the best guacamole I've ever made. If you don't plan on using it all right away, place saran wrap directly on the guacamole to  keep it a beautiful green colour, and then cover the container you are refrigerating it in.

Very good, and very easy!  Do leve it in the fridge for at least an hour before tasting, though--at first, it does taste too salty & too lemony.  After resting a bit, the flavors meld and it becomes delicious!

Delicious, but it doesn't need the olive oil.

Tried this today and it was wonderful!  I went with the advice of others and left out the oil.  I also added some salsa.  It turned out great!  We ate it with chips and in our Black Bean Soft Tacos (from this site) instead of just avocado.  YUM!

VERY easy , i like that it does not have to many ingredients and that you taste the avacado. I added some chopped tomato, it gave it a fresh taste. Definetly a great recipes for partys.

This was the first time we've made guacamole at home, we have purchased several at the grocery store but all were very poor tasting, none even came close to the real deal. This recipe is great, it not only tastes like what you get at the better mexican resturants, it dosen't turn black. We have some left over and after 3 days, it's still nice and green and smells like it was just made. Thank's Kathy Shaw!

Wish I had read the reviews first. Found it a little bland and the lemon overpowered it. Next time I'll use lime and add garlic.

To make good Authentic Guacamole in this quantity, you'll need a lime, Not a lemon, quartered, a teaspoon of minced garlic and I like to add enough good salsa to make the Guac. a reddish- brown color. Leave Out the olive oil, the avacado itself has enough oil in it.  Mix everything together and squeeze the lime over it and mix well. Add salt to taste and get ready to make a fool of yourself! This version is GOOD!

I used this as a base recipe.  I added 1 grated jalapeno pepper to add some heat, 1 seeded chopped roma tomato for texture, and a sprinkle of cumin and garlic powder for flavor.  Let it sit an hour as suggested.  Delicious.

My 2nd time making guacamole.  The 1st was making a horrible California guacamole. This one is excellent.  Instead of using regular salt, I used Adobe Seasoning Salt with Cumin - yum.  Couldn't take a pic because it was eaten too fast.  Thanks

Add finely shredded iceburg lettuce to extend the receipe (as you use oatmeal/bread crumbs in meatloaf) to suit your taste, some diced tomatoes, and a tsp of ground cumin.

This guacamole is really good.  I know a lot of people think it it needs the traditional ingredients, but it is still good.  I would give this recipe 5 stars, but I think 2 tablespoons is to much.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good. I added cayenne pepper and diced roma tomatoes,  it gave it an extra kick.

I love guacamole, so I decided to make it for the first time using this recipe. I didn't think it was that good;there wasn't much flavor to it. Maybe I  did something wrong??

This was my 2nd time using this recipe.  I've had compliments both times.  This time around I didn't have any lemons or lemon juice, so I subbed it with 2 tbsp vinegar.

Great starter recipe! I used lime instead of lemon and added 1/2 tsp minced garlic and a handful of chopped cilantro.  It turned out great.  My hubby, who doesn't even like Guacamole, ate almost all of it!

I didn't make this completely by the book, making the changes suggested by those who made this before.  I used lime instead of lemon, used only a tsp of olive oil, also adding some cumin and a clove of garlic to the mix.  Next time I will use cilantro and tomatoes along with the listed adjustments (didn't have those 2 things on hand this time).

My husband and I were searching for a homemade guacamole recipe. I did not put salt, instead, just garlic salt to taste, and instead of onions, since our friends did not eat onions, I used onion powder, and 100% real lemon juice to taste. Honestly, I have not tasted guacamole that tasted this good in a very long time!!! I was very impressed with the simlicity of it all, and completly amazed with the taste. Oh, I also added diced tomatoes..  :)

I followed the advice from the comments, added cilantro and lime, removed olive oil and this came out pretty well. However, I found an even better recipe (quite similar but better) posted by Bob Cody titled "Guacamole" - would recommend you try that one as well.  That said, this is also a good one with the changes suggested by the users. Thanks for sharing.

The writer is correct about the most important thing being a really ripe avocado. Learning how to pick them out of the pile at the market by the gentle squeeze test. Ripe ones are the tiniest bit soft. Those that are rock hard may take days to ripen. Those that are already soft will be rotten before you can use them.

Having never really tried guacamole before I really enjoyed this on celery and rice crips!  But I think my avocado wasn't ripe enough because it wasn't easy to mash.  But... practice will make perfect!  :)

Very good! True to the ingredients, although a bit bland. I like red onion.  Use light flavor olive oil if you don't want to taste it in your guacamole.

This recipe tastes just like the guacamole served by a favorite Mexican recipe in town.  I've always loved their guacamole, and could never figure out what they did differently from the recipes I've tried here at home.  This recipe is it!!  I made this exactly as written, and it is outstanding!!  Thanks so much, now I can have my "favorite" guacamole here at home!!

This is by far the easiest guacamole recipe that I have tried!  My husband always likes a little bit of spice, so I add 1/4 c. of salsa, and chop half a fresh jalapeno.  I also find it best to use very ripe avocados, otherwise my wrist gets sore when trying to mash them.

Sorry, but not a big fan.  Omit the olive oil (or oil of any kind for that matter) and use lime instead of lemon.  Also add cilantro and cumin. Leave one of the avocado seeds in the bowl also, it keeps from turning brown so soon.

This is great!  Don't listen to those naysayers who want to add cilantro, cilantro is gross.  The only thing I might do is add some garlic.

Decent base recipe but why the olive oil? Seemed unecessary and only added fat and calories. Also sort of bland. If I served it the way it was written to my Hispanic friends they would laugh at me! To make it true guacamole I added finely diced jalapenos, onions, garlics, tomatos and cilantro. After an hour in the fridge it was perfect!

Great EASY recipe!  Based on other reviewers, I omitted the olive oil, added minced garlic, chopped tomatoes & chopped fresh cilantro.  I also used lime juice instead of lemon juice and used Kosher salt instead of regular salt.  Huge hit - can't wait to make it again for more people!

I thought it was a little bland, so I added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp of cilantro.

I am giving this 5 stars because my son and his girlfriend inhaled it!  They thought it was the best they have ever had.  I really liked it as well, but preferred to add a little garlic, a little salsa and a heaping teaspoon of mayonaisse (the southern in me).

This recipe really is quite good--with a few additions, it's amazing. Like other reviewers mentioned, the oil is unnecessary so I omitted it. Cilantro and a bit of minced garlic make this guacamole delicious. I ended up using lemon juice as the recipe stated instead of lime juice as many reviewers recommended (I was out of lime jucie) and it's great. Very tasty.

I don't really know much about guacamole, this one seemed okay but i had to had a lot more onion i used 3/4 of a lime instead of a lemon, and added a bit more salt, it tasted much better after these changes, overall a pretty good guacamole recipe.

Wow!  I've been a fan of guacamole for years, but I've never tried to make it before.  WOW!  This recipe is so good and so simple!  I omitted the oil and used green onions for the onion.  I also added a squeeze or two of lime juice in addition to the lemon juice.  IT'S GREAT! This guacamole tastes just like what you'd get at a tex mex restaurant!

I thought this recipe was adequate but certainly not good.  Definately too much olive oil.  I'll stick with a recipe that uses sour cream instead.

This was a hit at our friend's party.  We made a few changes by adding a little more lemon juice and less oil than the recipe called for.  We also chopped all the ingredients to make the dip a little more chunky.  We paired with this with some cheesy torilla chips and everyone loved it!

I was so happy I found this recipe.  I'm not too fond of using lime and never thought to use lemon.  I didn't add too much olive oil.  I did add some chopped tomato.  I'm a guacamole lover now!

I omitted the olive oil and added chopped tomatoes, some chopped jalepenos for spice, and a tiny bit of garlic. This recipe is really flexible, just mash up the avocadoes and add whatever you like.

This "Best Guacamole" was in fact the best guacamole I have ever made. It reminds me of the expression "less is more." Not too fancy but big on taste. Thank you PHLOX for sharing your recipe.

This would have been too bland for my family's taste. And I've never had to add oil to any of my guac recipes. Garlic, cilantro, finely chopped jalapenos and diced tomatoes are wonderful add-ins to any guac recipe. Also, I prefer limes to lemons. If you don't like cilantro or jalapenos, this would be a good recipe.

First of all, I like guacamole a little chunky, it looks far more attractive and the avocado is taster when it's not pureed, as the photo shows.. It needed fresh garlic, zero olive oil, chopped pickled (or fresh) jalapenos to taste, fresh ground pepper, a teaspoon of salt, red onion chopped and a quarter cup of coarsely chopped fresh cilantro and LIME juice, not lemon, also lotsa people add a chopped tomato, which is lovely but you can't save the guac in the fridge for long with tomato in it......I guess if you've never had good guacamole, you'd think that recipe was ...meh...but seriously....Another tip to keep the guacamole for turning color (if you have any left over) is to pack it into a glass container with a tight fitting lid but before putting the lid on it, place a piece of saran wrap directly on top of of the guacamole and press it into it lightly so no air will come in contact with it. Then put the lid on.

Good basic recipe.  This recipe can be cut in half (1 Avocado) and it's enough for one family dinner.  Add two cloves crushed garlic, the same amount of tomato as onion plus fresh cilantro leaves.  Keep the seed in the container with any leftover guac and it will slow down the process of it turning brown.

I thought this was a great start to the quacamole, but it needed a little kick! I added a bit more onion, 1 clove of garlic, and some chooped cilanto and tomatoes. I also switched out the the lemon for a lime. But I really enjoyed the oil! It gave the guacamole a rich flavor.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (except I doubled everything) and took it to a pot luck. I actually heard someone else trying to take credit for making it "from their own recipe!" I just had to laugh. Perfect for all occasions, and really good on hamburgers!

All due respect, but this was simply not good. It tasted like guacamole lemonade and needed a lot of love before I would serve it.

This is basic. You don;t need the olive oil and you really need chopped cilantro and lime juice instead of lemon. Also, garlic is so important in guac. We also add chopped tomatoes if we have on hand. We cover the top with a thin layer of mayo to prevent  browning.

This is a great simple recipe. I agree with some of the other reviewers, next time I would have the olive oil or leave it out all together. I will also add tomatoes the next time.

Grabbed this recipe because it seemed easy, but really can't see making guacamole again with olive oil. I also would make it lime juice and cilantro and a little minced tomato. Guess I'm a traditionalist when it comes to guacamole.

This was a bit too oily and didn't have much of a flavor to it. I am going to add a bit of cumin and garlic powder next time and increase the lemon juice a bit. Overall good, basic recipe.

This was so easy and it tastes great! It makes a lot of Guacamole for one person so I think next time I will split the recipe in half.  I put the Guacamole on a homemade hamburger and it was just delicious!

Loved it!  Loved the saltiness of it.  While making it I realized I didn't have olive oil so used 1 TBL mayo instead.  Even the 3 kids loved it.  They didn't notice the finely chopped red onion at all.

I have never been a fan of Guacamole but after finding this recipe I have to say that we LOVE IT!!  I do add fresh cilantro but it's good even without it.  It is a great basic recipe for any Mexican dish.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

Why give something 5 stars when so many people make changes?  I have to give it 4 stars as written because I think 2 Tbsp of olive oil was too much.  I made a 2nd time with only 1 Tbsp and it was better, but with all the oil in avocados to start with I'm not sure you need it at all.  I also added tomatoes, but I guess that's a personal taste.  I also think I'll try lime juice next time like many people suggested.

I felt it needed a little more salt and lime juice worked better than lemon taste-wise.  On a recommendation I also tried it again with about 2 tablespoons of ripe tomato, which made it even better.

I tried this because it looks so healthy especially once I read you could omit the olive oil.  I made it without the olive oil.  I added a dash of garlic and not quite as much salt.  I think I should have added more of both.  I also added half a tomatoe.  It was very good.  My children really liked it.  I will make this again often.

Yum. I did change this recipe up. I excluded the olive oil on the advice of some of the reviewers. I only used one large avacado, as that is all I had on hand (although at this point I wish I had two!). I added a couple of cloves of garlic, minced. I will be omitting the onion next time, or maybe mincing it really well. Or maybe substituting onion powder. And I added about a fourth of a cup of finely chopped cilantro. The cilantro really adds to the guac, but make sure it is as finely chopped as possible.

This is the best guacamole I ever ate, but I did change it up some: I minced garlic, onion, fresh cilantro, half a tomato, and a seeded jalapeno and mixed it in. I thought lime juice would work better than lemon, but I didn't have a lime--good thing, too, the lemon was just right.

Not everybody on the planet is a fan of cilantro OR garlic so this recipe is most welcome.  I use it as a layer in my 7 layer dip, made a double batch for the Super Bowl and not a trace was left. Thank you for sharing a simply delicious recipe!

To prevent the avocadoes from browning, peel them and put them into some water with ice in it. Let them sit in there while you chop your cilantro, tomatoes and onions and whatever else you add. Drain off the water and then mash them. This keeps them nice and green for a long time. If you have leftovers try storing in an airtight container and at the most there is a thin dark green layer which you can scrape off if it bothers you. I don't remember where I learned this but I know it works.

Delicious!!!! I don't know if it's going to make it to the Sunday Superbowl tomorrow! ;-) I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of cilantro flakes for extra flavor, other then that I wouldn't and didn't change a thing.

This recipe is a good basic start for guacamole. The olive oil isn't really necessary, I don't think? I added cilantro, I think that's a pretty important part of guacamole, as well as red peppers, tomatoes, ground black pepper, and a bit more onion than it called for.

why do people give 4 or 5 stars and then list all the things they changed? To me guac is soooo much better with cilantro and lime. tomato is nice and hot peppers like serrano are good as well. lets start the annonymous flaming people, this is the internet!

Fabulous and so easy to make!  To make the "mashing" even easier, I used an electric hand mixer on the avocado and then stirred in the other ingredients.  I used less oil as avocados are already so rich in good fats, that nutritionally (and consistency-wise), the dip didn't need it.  If you love avocados, also check out the Avocado dessert on allrecipes.

Great recipe for when you have ripe avocados, but no garlic, tomatoes or cilantro on hand.  It takes minutes to make and the flavor is actually pretty good.  I left out the olive oil and added garlic powder.  I put it in the fridge for only 15 minutes and it was still tasty.

Great basic recipe.  I followed others suggestions to use lime juice instead of lemon.  And to kick it up a bit, i stirred in a couple of tablespoons of Pico de Gallo  (recipe on this website).

I whipped this up really quickly one evening and really liked. I too used 1TBSP of Olive Oil, 1/2 TBSP of Lemon Juice, 1TBSP of sour cream and I added have of a plum tomato. Probably not the best Guacamole I've ever had, but it was pretty tasty!

I modified it a bit.  Put a diced tomato in and lots of cilantro and lime instead of lemon.  Cumin definitely flavors it up a little bit more but only a little is needed.  Garlic too, but i put garlic in everything.

I made this today, it's an easy very good recipe.  Like others I left out the oil.   I added chopped chives, garlic and a spring onion.  It's so easy, I will make this often.

Very good, I have made this a various amounts of times including for guests. Its quick and easy and gives a nice accompaniment to any Mexican dish. Adjustments I made were that I used lime instead of lemon, added a clove of garlic, and some cilantro.

This was wonderful!!! I  read some of the other reviews and decided to try some of their ideas like adding Cilantro and omitting the oil. I also used less lemon juice because I'm not a big lemon fan. The recipe turned out great!

I usually hate gucamole, but i figured i would give it another try, homeade. This recipe has changed my whole perspective on what you can do with an avocado. I followed the recipe as Barb A. did below me. I didn't use the cilantro or tomato due to the fact that i didn't have them. This guacamole dip, when served with homeade tortilla chips, was doomed to survive any longer then 15 minutes.

I think this is a great guacamole recipe. I don't like my food hot with pepper, so it fit me to a T.  I didn't add as much olive oil and I added 6 chopped grape tomatoes (because I had them) and lime juice because I had that. This makes a great base that can be changed to anyone's taste or one can make it like it is and enjoy that too. So as for me, I think it's a great guacamole and I will take it to any party where I have to take a dip. Thanks Kathy!

I was really nervous about making guacamole.  I have always wanted to make it, but have never had the nerve. I had just heard too many horror stories of guacamole gone bad.  This was easy and straightforward.  I didn't have any fresh lemon on hand, so I used lime, it tasted great.  Wonderful recipe!!

I added chopped cherry tomatoes to this and served at a party-- the guacamole was gone so fast!  Best I've had yet.  Lovely recipe, and so simple.

This guacamole is awesome.  The only thing I changed was less oil.  All it really needs is about a 1/2 Tablespoon.  It's yummy!!!!

This is basically the same way I make guacamole, except I grate the onion, add garlic powder, add about 1 T. picante sauce and omit olive oil. Always rave reviews!

I thought this was all right. I would probably leave out the olive oil next time. I also added cayenne pepper, garlic powder and substituted green onions for regular ones.

I enjoyed this recipe a lot. I added a bit more lemon juice and omitted the oil. As suggested in one of the other reviews I tried it with tostitos hint of lime chips, mmmmmmmmm!

I love Gucamole and this was by far the best i've had. So easy to make and delicious. Much better than the onces you get ready made at the store or even at good mexican restaurants I've been. Thank you for this receipe. I don't really like olive oil so I cut that out of this receipe.

This is a really good, simple recipe.  It makes the perfect appetizer amount for two people.  Be sure to chop the onions into small pieces....and red onions make a pretty color contrast.

my husband and myself usually don't like guacamole that others prepare. And I've never made it myself, I always felt overwhelmed.  With this recipe I  made it myself and it was unbelieveably quick and easy.  Plus it tasted great.  My husband thinks it need just a little kick,-- I'll have to experiment-- but other than that he loves it too.  I like it the way it is.  It's also nice (for us anyway) to leave some avacado chunks in it.

Very quick and easy to prepare. Perfect for last minute condiment. More simple guac than I am used to but still very tasty and worked well with my tacos and fajitas. Will most assuredly use again.

This was my first attempt at guacamole, and using avocado as an ingredient in my own cooking. I'm not what I was expecting but this was uninspiring. Not bad, just not interesting. As other reviewers remarked, perhaps garlic and cilantro would help. I ended up using it as a layer in a 7 layer dip instead of solo, and there it certainly contributed to the flavors.

I grate the onion so it is a pulp and add a tablespoon 
Sambal Oelek and and bit of pepper and juice of a full lemon. Also no oil. 
Excellent with a slight kick. Try it. You won't be dissapointed

For a little spice, use a medium or hot salsa instead of just onion.  You can make your own salsa like I do, or use a good store bought one.

If you like it super plain it's good. I prefer a bit more flavor. Omit the olive oil, add one minced garlic clove, chopped tomatoes, cilantro (sometimes I substitute the last three items with part of a can of Rotel Mexican style lime and cilantro diced tomatoes), finely chopped onion and for a little zip add a pinch of your choice of hot ground pepper (cayenne, chili powder or chipotle chili pepper). The flavors blend together nicely.

Great and super easy. I eliminated the olive oil because mine was a little soupy even before adding it. Maybe my lemon was too juicy.

I had very ripe avocados, lemons and an onion, but had no cilantro or tomatoes at the house.  Was so happy to find this recipe!  It was perfect, and will be my go-to recipe to use up soft avocados.  Thanks!

It tastes great right after making this yummy dip, but cold is even better.  I did substitute the onion for dried minced onion since I am not a fan of raw onions. Definitely will be making this more often as I cant find a decent one in stores that taste as good.

I leave out the onions, but this is still a masterpiece every time. I prefer less rip avocado and use a fork to keep it chunky. When I don't have fresh limes, a tablespoon of bottled lemon juice does the trick, tho fresh limes or lemons are better. Absolutely perfect amounts of salt, oil, and citrus. Thank you for sharing!

This is a good base guacamole recipe.  I usually add 1 tsp minced garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper for added punch. Everyone in the family loves it.

This is a really good base recipe. I decided to take it up a few notches with a finely diced medium sized red bell pepper, a couple of finely diced Roma tomatoes, a garlic clove chopped finely with some Kosher salt smashed into it.

THEN I started using Cool Ranch Doritos in place of regular corn tortilla chips. IDEA...I put a handful in a bag and crushed them up to a fine powder and used that as a salt substitue. And lemme tell ya....WOW! 

So, Cool Ranch Doritos as a salt substitute. 

Bam...perfect guac.

Could definitely use a kick. Try adding finely chopped jalapeno to taste. Chopped sweet tomato balanced it out as well.

Basic Guacamole.  Need Cilantro,  finely chopped onions,  diced Jalapeño or even better Fresno Chiles, burn off the outside, remove seeds and ribs.  Lemon juice but don't over do it. 2 or 3 dashes of Worcestershire, finely chopped tomatoes.  Salsa can be added if you want to spice it up.

There was a split amongst the raters: some preferred the smooth, creamy texture of this version while others rated it second best to the more chunky, tomato-ey version.

My avocados must have been small because 2tbs and 1/2 lemon would have been WAY too much liquid. I used probably 1/4 lemon and 1tbs oil.  My 7 yr old even loved it.

It was my first homemade Guacamole, and it was far better than most Guacamoles that I had in restaurants.
I changed the recipe just a bit to my taste. less onions and more lemon juice and a cilantro.

As written it is a good sandwich spread.  I found it flat tasting for a dip for chips or crudites.  Add chopped tomato , lime and some hot chilies and you can make it as spicy as you like or not. Yummy with any Mexican dishes as a topping.  Enjoy!!!!

Simple and yummy! It was gone in no time. Used a half lime cause that's all I had. Also only used 1 tsp of olive oil. Added chopped onions, tomatoes and 1 clove of garlic. Super yummy!

I tried this recipe - it turned out ok.  I have to have freshly chopped cilantro in mine.  I also like tomatoes , onions and garlic in there as well.

I end up making pico de gallo and mixing a few teaspoons in with the mashed avacado.  (I make mine with minced garlic)

This was super-easy to make and the bowls were cleaned out almost immediately at our party!  The only suggestion I heard was many would have preferred more of a garlic taste, otherwise it would have been "perfect".  Ask people if they are garlic aficionados and adjust accordingly- we will definitely be making this again!

This was much better than I expected based on the ingredients. It's not a traditional guacamole, but it has a really nice, bright flavor from the lemons and olive oil. It definitely benefits from sitting for an hour. I tasted it right after I made it and the salt and olive oil were really pronounced. It all blends and mellows after the hour wait. Because this guacamole doesn't have any strong flavors like cumin or cilantro, it's really good as a sandwich spread in place of mayo.

Really liked the recipe! However, I followed the advice of Barb A. and I think this is what made it superb! Everyone in my family liked it and the entire bowl was gone within the hour... will definitely have to double the recipe next time! :) I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.

This is the basic recipe for starters but by far not all what guacamole can or should be. Cilantro, garlic, chopped green onion, tomato, and of course, chopped fresh hot pepper to taste.

Pretty sure this recipe has changed. I have had it saved for years and used to think it was delicious. I'm am 99% positive that this same recipe used to include minced garlic, garlic powder, and onion powder. Recently I noticed that the recipe is different and I've been trying to remember the ratios of everything but I can never get it quite right. I'd love for it to be switched back because that recipe was much better than the one currently here.

Too blandWhere are the tomatoes, cilantro, jalapenos, etc. ? Great for people that like things that have very little flavor or spice, but definately not the best Guac!

I added more onions (I love onions) 2 more tablespoons than the recipe.  I like using this when making nachos or using it as a spread for my spicy chicken sandwich.

This was fabulous! I made it to serve with dinner of taco salad.  My husband and son ate all of it for dinner. Big hit! I added a tsp. minced garlic and one small tomato diced.  Can't wait to make again! Thanks for the great recipe!

With a few minor revisions this is a five star. I like my guacamole to tast like avocado, not like tomatoes and onion so the amounts of those are perfect. I would leave out the oil though and you NEED garlic! Other than that I love the simplicity of the recipe.

Love it. Made only a few changes. I  added some fresh chopped cilantro, instead of salt I used 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, and I  left out the olive oil. Was very good. Used it on top of a taco salad.

I would like to know the purpose of olive oil in this Recipe. I like the addition of finely chopped olives. Avocado is a wonderfully versatile vegetable.            cheers from angie!!!

This was very good, however I felt like it was lacking in "something" I am definitly going to try again and see if I like it more. Could just have been the avacado's I used.

I'm giving this five stars, because it would have been great, had I not messed up the recipe!  I didn't read carefully, and only had one avocado, but I didn't adjust the measurements of the other ingredients.  It came out REALLY salty and with a lot of onion!  I ate as much as I could anyway, because it tasted good...just salty!    Next time, I'll use 2 avocados and it will be perfect!

I make Guacamole dip all the time.  This is the base of the recipe I use.  I also like to add cilantro and garlic powder.  I also like to add red onion instead of yellow.  It gives it a sweeter taste that my friends and family love.

Great!!! There seemed to be a little too much lemon and I didn't use the entirety of what the recipe called for. I also only used about 1/2 the amount of oil. It was an instant hit!

I rated this a 5 star but have to add the comment that I made the additions and changes suggested by Barb A (so with those changes I give it a 5 star).  I also made it in a molcajete in which I was really able to grind up the garlic, onion, and cilantro.  Then I added everything else except the tomato and blended well.  I then gently added in the tomato, which gave it a great color.  I will make this again and again.

Good recipe. I like more garlic, so I added more than called for. I also cut up some roma tomatoes and used a little sea salt, good stuff!

It is so simple and good. There are exactly enough ingredients for it to be balanced. Nothing is overwhelming. It "was the best guacamole" they'd ever tasted according to my company. I'll be keeping this recipe for sure!

Made this today for a BBQ.  With the changes mentioned below - it was a total 5 plus.  A bit bland before cilantro, tomato, jalapeno, cumin and garlic. I am not sure if the olive oil helps it stay green and not blacken?  It was left out for 2 hours and it was still pretty! I will make again!

Was good, but it definitely needed some cilantro and tomato. After I added that, this recipe was at least a 4.5, but without it, it was a little bit boring for guac.

it's pretty good.  When you first make it you might feel that it doesnt' taste anything so make sure you do let it sit for at least an hour to get the flavor out.  It was great for parties!

Absolutely tasty and simple to make.  I, too, reduced the amount of salt and added some finely minced garlic.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a bit bland (perhaps the avocados were big).  I added a bit more lemon juice and salt and it tasted better.  My husband asked for tomatoes in it, so I added some diced tomatoes as well.  Will make again perhaps with minced garlic.

There is so much left out of this recipe that is needed for good guacomole.  I always add a few fresh minced garlic cloves, tomatoes, lime jc., cilantro.  I usually make mine and let it set in the fridge overnight so the flavors can mesh.

I also reduced the oil and really loved this recipe.  I doubled the recipe because I have a large family and I mixed everything in a food processor.  It came out lovely and smooth.  I will definitely be making this one regularly.

This is a good basic recipe. As with ALL recipes you have to suit to taste. Those of you who thought it did not make enough did you buy the Haas avocados as suggested in the recipe as they have a stronger taste and are much larger.

I cannot imagine how the writer expects two avocados to make enough guacamole for sixteen people, no matter what the additional ingredients are!  I used two avocados to serve two and that just filled two small ramekins, enough to use with just a few chips each.  I used lime instead of lemon, added cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and just a small amount (maybe half teaspoon) of olive oil and this guacamole still wasn't flavorful enough. I suppose it's a good basic recipe but there's so much playing around with this one needed that I might as well look some more for the "best" guacamole recipe.

I used the lemon juice as the recipe said, however, did add a bit of garlic, cumin and salsa that others mentioned adding. (I was out of cilantro, but will add that, as others suggested, next time I make it.)  While I'm not a fan of guacamole, my husband loved it :)  I'm sure he'll be asking for this one again!

Wonderful guacamole!  I only gave it 4 stars because I made a couple of changes from necessity.  I used the juice of one lime, and added a bit of garlic and cumin.  I did not add olive oil at all as I have none at the moment; I didn't see the point of adding it anyway, since the consistency was perfect without it.  This was delicious -- thanks for sharing this recipe.

this was so good and easy to make. i though it had maybe a tad too much lemon and salt, but my boyfriend disagreed with me and thought it was perfect.

This is a great guacamole recipe! I take it to lunches at work and everyone loves it. I use a little less oil than it calls for, because it tends to get a little greasy if you use the full amount. It's great though! And really easy.

Very good.  I did add a few more things just to add my own personal touch, however it is a great base.  Thank you for sharing.

I really like how light this is.  It has a great "avacado and not much else taste."  It is a tad lemony.  I would suggest using the juice of a quarter of a lemon.  I also only used half the oil.

Excellent!  I really enjoyed this recipe, and I am not a huge fan of guacomole!

I found this recipe to be boring.  I've made better and won't be using this recipe again.

Well, only one of my ten guests liked this, or did they really----so I took it back into the kitchen, added another avocado, a chopped tomato, seeded, some mayonnaise, sour cream, and garlic salt.  After the additions they ate it all.

Simplicity at its finest.  My only hangup is that it needs a little heat, like a chopped jalepeno or birdseye pepper.
