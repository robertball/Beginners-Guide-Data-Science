I have used this recipe consistantly for a few months with pasta salad.  It makes just the right amount for a 1 pound pasta salad.

A bit on the tangy side - I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and 2 packets of sun crystals vs. sugar.  To change it up I added a bit of dijon mustard.  Overall a nice dressing to serve over mixed greens.

A simple recipe. i usually just do oil and vinegar but the touch of garlic and sugar was a great addition.  My husband and son loved it.  My son even asked for another salad as a before bed snack.

Followed recipe exactly and it was fantastic! It had just the right amount of kick without being too vinegary OR oily. I put it on some cold spiral pasta that I had cooked the previous day and added some deli meat and cheese and it made the perfect cold pasta salad! Also used it on a green salad and it was just right for that. Thanks for the great and simple recipe. I definitely will use it again and again!

This recipe is the perfect blend of vinegar, sugar and garlic. No one ingredient overpowers the other. It is a mild, flavorful union of ingredients.
Thanks for sharing.

I also added the dijon mustard, for the oil I did use 1/3 cup but made up evenly of extra virgin and extra light olive oil. This dressing was PERFECT for my gorgonzola and candied pecan salad!   All of the reviewers that said the dressing was too tangy or had too much vinegar. . .I really think they used too much on their salads because this dressing is perfect once the dijon mustard is added.  TIP: I used a handheld mixer in a glass and this dressing never seperated on me.

I can't cook. At all. 
I made this with my one year old. It turned out great, and my one and four year old boys both actually ate some salad with dinner. Thank you for the amazing recipe!!

Put together a nice spinach salad for lunch today with ingredients I had in the fridge and served this dressing on top of it.  This is a nice garlicky vinaigrette which won't make you pucker because of the somewhat mild white wine vinegar.  Enjoyed, and will make this again.  Thanks for sharing another great fresh dressing recipe on AR.

I thought this was too sour tasting at first, so I added some Dijon mustard, honey, and a little extra sugar. I thought it tasted better after the additions were added.

This is the best one I have tried yet! Garlicy and I love the addition of the sugar! This went together really easy right into the jar I was using. Thanks for the recipe! I used Champagne Vinegar.

It went very well with a blueberry walnut salad. I used the same proportions as the original recipe but used half olive oil and half vegetable oil instead of just vegetable oil.

This is easy and quick.  I added mustard powder to emulsify and help flavor.  A little too acidic.  Perhaps using a stronger-tasting oil would help, such as olive oil.  But it's a great dressing to whip up in a hurry, with ingredients you're likely to have on hand.

Easy, easy, easy.  And really yummy!  I used the other person's suggestion for the pear & gorgonzola salad on this site and I think I have a new favorite salad.  I served it at a party with lasagna and everyone enjoyed it.

I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Tastes great, though it separated and solidified on me when I tried to refridgerate & save.

Loved it! Only difference is I substituted honey for the sugar and added a squirt of dijon mustard as other readers suggested.  It is a little tangy but full of flavor! I will make it again.

Used a high grade of champagne vinegar....prepare to pucker.   Equal parts of any kind of vinegar and oil is way too much.

I have made this twice as a dressing for pasta salad.  It's simple and works well with the pasta/veggie combo. It's similar to a recipe I use for spinach salad and will try this next time!

Great basic recipe. After reading the reviews, I added about 1 tsp Dijon and a dash of hot sauce. I grated 1 clove of garlic and minced the other as I love garlic and that makes the taste pop. Instead of sugar, I added honey. It was great...I will use it on my lentil salad again.

I made this recipe using red wine vinaigrette instead of white.  Other than that I follow the recipe.  Even my two year old loves it.

Very good simple recipe.  I just used one clove of garlic and once mixed together I let it set in the fridge for 20 minutes before using.  Great on a green salad with toasted almonds.

I, too, thought that this had no flavor.  It tasted like pure oil and quickly separated.  Then, like magic, I added a teaspoon of Dijon mustard and presto!  It was delicious!

I loved the fact that I had everything for this recipe in my cabinets.Even though it was good it tasted rather dull, even after I let it sit a few hours. I added some dill and some whole garlic cloves in addition to the minced garlic and put it back in the fridge for a few hours. Then it had zing! Great tossed on a spinach/tomato/cucumber/corn salad with crispy bacon sprinkled on the top! Yum!

Outstanding. This has the perfect proportions! Salty, sweet, garlicky...excellent. I was on the phone with my mother while trying it and she insisted on getting the recipe too. Now it's her favorite vinigiarette dressing. The flavor is incredible.

I thought sugar would not be good, but I found out different.  It balances out the acid in the white wine vinegar.  I absolutely love this salad dressing.  It is awesome!  I love it over a pickling cucumber, red Onion and chopped tomato salad.  I drink the left over dressing.  Thank you so much.  I love your magazine also.  It is all about All Recipes!  Thank you again!

Very tangy but I like it like that way.

I used olive oil instead of veg oil, 1 clove of minced garlic instead of two and added 1 tsp Dijon mustard.  After mixing this together it was super tangy so added a small squirt of honey and that toned it down a bit.  Very easy and tasty, will make again.

I wanted to make pasta salad without the usual mayo dressing. I came across this recipe and did it exactly how it was written. It is yummy! I will be making this again soon. My kids even had seconds because they liked this dressing so much.  Which they don't normally do when I add mayo. So, thank you for putting this on here.

Very bland. I used grape seed oil instead of vegetable oil, a little extra vinegar, a touch of Dijon mustard, and a bit of lemon juice. It was okay after that but I won't be using this recipe again.

Good basic recipe. Very good flavor. Used a little more of the garlic. At first taste, it seemed ok. As it sat while other parts of the meal were being prepared, the flavors had time to blend and it was even better.

This was the first dressing I've ever made from scratch, I think.
I tried it because I had a "Chicken and Wild Rice" salad (from a cookbook) that called for "vinaigrette".
The Woman I Love really liked this dressing in that dish.
I had a little dressing left over, which I had with a simpler green salad two days later. Then, it seemed to me to be a little too sweet and a little light on the garlic for my tastes.
I guess we'll give this recipe a 4-out-of-5-stars rating - it was pretty good. I just may make it again one of these days.
