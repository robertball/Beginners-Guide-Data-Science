Super simple and straight forward with  classic flavors and without all of the frills. Excellent! I did cook mine longer on each side to get a deep golden brown but other than that I made as written.  This is a great recipe for Swai!

This was indeed simple and delicious.  I zested about half of a fresh lemon and then juiced the whole thing -- came out with less than 1/4 cup but it was plenty for the amount of butter and flour in the pan. Did not change the recipe otherwise. Use good European butter if you have it as the quality of the butter and the freshness of the lemon shines through.  Excellent and classic French.

Loved this recipe.  I did make one change, based on some of the comments.  I used meyer lemons to cut down the acidity.

This was easy and delicious.
 I will make it again but will use 1/8 cup of lemon juice instead of 1/4 cup.  Everything else was perfect!

I followed the directions with no deviations and the fish came out fantastic. Very rich, buttery flavor and it was tender. I would definitely make this again.

Very good and very easy to make.  My picky 9 year old even liked it.  We used sole, which cooked perfectly..  The lemon was actually a little overpowering.  Next time I'll tone it down a bit, but will definitely make it again!
