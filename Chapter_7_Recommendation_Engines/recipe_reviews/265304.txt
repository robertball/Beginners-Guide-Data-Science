Easy and good. I did add a little cheese and diced yellow onions. Cayenne pepper was a nice/needed ingredient.

Excellent, healthy and takes just minutes to make! The lemon really gives it a fresh flavor, and I like the cayenne here. I scaled it down to just one egg. This would be good at any time of the day. Thanks Barbara, I'll surely make this again!

I am new to eating avocados as I'm trying to eat healthier. Very good! I'm pleasantly surprised. I think next time I will add more cayenne pepper to up the spice. Thank you! Will definitely make this again.

REALLY GOOD  I  have tried other versions of this lunch.
This was really nice. Light and fresh. Easy when made as directed. No oven in summer for toast, add tomato slices.
Loved the slight lemon and cayenne flavour.
