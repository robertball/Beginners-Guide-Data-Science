I made this recipe with small variations to ingredients. I used a packaged spicy mesquite marinade which I mixed according to directions but refrigerated overnight. I also substituted sweet baby rays barbecue sauce instead of chipotle. The results were delicious. I will make again. Thanks for a great recipe.

These grilled up nicely and the flavor was great. I will make these again and stuff more jalapeno inside.
