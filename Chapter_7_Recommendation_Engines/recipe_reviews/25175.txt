Great by itself or with baba ganoush and pita. This one will definately need about a day in the fridge with occasional stirring to reach full flavor.

This was so good, with a smoky, nutty flavor. I wasn't sure about it at first, but the longer it sat, the more flavorful it became. I prefer a milder onion flavor, so I used scallions, and I used unrefined coconut oil instead of butter. I don't eat peanuts, so instead of peanut powder, I used almond powder and finely ground cashews, which are fairly sweet, so I omitted the sugar. Next time, I'll add just a bit more cumin seed to enhance the smoky flavor. This was perfect with Indian Dahl with Spinach, also from this site.

I fried the onion in a small amount to oil so my DH could eat this. leaving out the chile pepper for his portion.  I should have left my portion without the pepper also, as it was very strong!  Next time I might use a bell pepper instead of the hot variety!  This went nicely as the filling with some beans in a burrito!

This is a delicious salad and one that I will make again. I do disagree with the reviews that say to let it sit for a day. This is what I did and it turned sort of a sick grey. When I made the salad it was crisp and absolultly beautiful. I would say that maybe 2-3 hours in the fridge would bring out the flavors without wrecking the gorgious fresh color of the salad. I also added bell peppers along with the chilis because I wanted more color and less spice. All in all this was a very good recipe. I rate it five stars for the recipe and 3 stars for the reviews. ;)

such a yummy lil snack. I literally faked the whole thing because I was lacking a few ingredients, but some pickled jalapenos for chiles, peanut butter for powder, and sun dried tomatoes instead of diced, but not as many, still good.

I wasn't sure if my family would like this or not, but my guys LOVED it and so did I, and my mother. We used a green bell pepper and then a spicy pepper from our garden (so half/half). It is super yummy! I let it sit all night and the color turned me off slightly the next day, BUT the flavor is awesome!!!! It was fun to use a recipe that we had almost all the ingredients in our garden AND have it taste so delicious!
