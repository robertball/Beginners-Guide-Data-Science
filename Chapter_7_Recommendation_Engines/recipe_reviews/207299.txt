Very good.  Bf wasn't impressed with the ice cream I used (which wasn't ice cream at all--it was frozen yogurt) but otherwise he seemed to like it.  I didn't think it had enough ice cream, so I added a couple more scoops (and probably 8,000 more calories!) to bring it closer to the root beer floats I remember as a kid.  Obviously, this is a bit more of an adult version.  thanks for the recipe!
