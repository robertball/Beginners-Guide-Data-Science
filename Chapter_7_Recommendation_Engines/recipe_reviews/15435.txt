I used chicken stock instead of water and added a touch of cream at the end. It was wonderful! I also spread a tiny bit of blue cheese on some buttered bread then toasted the bread and served the toast on the side. Five stars

Something missing here. Soup tasted OK but was quite watery. Needs cream or milk somewhere along the line.

This soup is surprisingly good and it was outstanding made with chicken broth instead of water. Like another reviewer said use only about half the amount of water / broth called for. Also use butter instead of margarine. Overall this is a keeper recipe Thanks!

I used chicken stock instead of water (about half of what the original recipe called for) white cheddar instead of stilton and added 4 small potatoes with the celery. It was delicious!

Pretty good but lacks thickness so I added cooked rice to finished soup; very tasty if you like blue cheese!

I used butter and 21/2 cups of chicken stock and just a pinch of white pepper for a little zip.

Tasty recipe. I did make changes. I used half the butter called for and chicken stock as recommended by other reviewers. No watercress so used parsley. For us it was creamy enough - my husband loved it.
