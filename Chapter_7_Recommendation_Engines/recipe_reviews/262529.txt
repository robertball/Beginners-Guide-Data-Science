Started out as written using Greek yogurt. After tasting it I ended up doubling the yogurt which helped. I didn't care for this at all but hubs absolutely loved it and complimented it several times so take that for what it is worth. He even made a bold statement by saying he preferred this over ranch any day. Maybe I just don't like tahini? I'm rating this a 4 because of his reaction. You be the judge...
