I have to say the topping on this is somewhat chewy. I would omit the evaporated milk and use some butter in its place. The apple mixture underneath is delish!

This was pretty good. The flavor of the apples was nice and the applesauce added a very nice boost of flavor. I wasn't a big fan of the topping. Wasn't really very crisp. Wasn't bad just wasn't what I think of when I think apple crisp. I would definitely use butter in place of the evaporated milk if  I was going to make it again.

I really hoped we was going to love this recipe....But well it was Ok nothing really special. I did not understand the milk in the topping. It made a soft mixture that made it hard to spread over the apples. It had good flavor but could have used a little more cinnamon. I do have plans on trying this again with less milk.

I made this this afternoon for desert tonight.   While it tasted ok, I found it to be too sweet.  I made it as written, but added some butter to the topping before spreading it on the apples.   I will make this again but I think I will try cutting the sugar in half, or at the least, by a third.   I also think that the addition of nuts and/or raisins might be a nice addition in the future.

I had high hopes for this recipe but it just did not come out right.  I am not sure what went wrong.  I had never made a crisp topping that had evaporated milk and powdered milk in it.  It was very moist as I was adding it to the top but after baking it had a hard and chewy texture.  Adding the applesauce to the bottom layer really brought out the apple flavor but it also made it a little runny. In the future I would cut back on the applesauce and use a traditional topping that used butter instead of milk.
