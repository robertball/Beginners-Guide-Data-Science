I was looking for a good beef and noodle recipe.  I chose this one because I had all of the ingredients.  This was delicious!  A really different take on beef and noodles.  Kinda like BBQ beef and noodles.  This would be good on top of mashed potatoes too. I will definitely make this again.  I saved it to my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

I have another preferred Beef paprika recipe I use, but this was equally as delicious. I wouldn't call this a casserole though.
I chose to make this in my instant pot for an even faster dinner. It was as simple as saut√©eing the garlic and onion in oil, adding the beef, and then mixing the remaining ingredients together and pouring the sauce over the beef. I cooked this on high pressure for 20 minutes.
 The only thing I would change is instead of using the dry mustard, use Dijon mustard.

This recipe was a big hit at my house.  I did make a few changes though.  My husband can't eat spicy food so I cut way down on the paprika and only used a teaspoon.  I also used minced dried onions instead of fresh because I didn't have an onion on hand.  I served this over mashed potatoes and  I think you could also try it over rice and that would be great too.

Seems like too much ketchup. Tasted more like BBQ beef than paprika. Not at all spicy.

I think we would use a tomato sauce instead of Ketchup.
