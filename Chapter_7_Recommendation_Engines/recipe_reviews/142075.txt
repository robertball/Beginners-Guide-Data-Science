Boring recipe. I used a whole 10oz package of fresh mushrooms, upped the marsala to 1 cup, and added about 1/2 cup chopped onion. Even then it wasn't so great. Did seem really salty but that might have been because I used cooking wine rather than regular wine so there was salt added in the wine. I'm up for trying anything once, but I don't think I'll put this one on my menu again.

I found this to be rather bland.  I served it with white rice; perhaps that didn't help.

I didn't read the reviews on this one - I just really like chicken marsala, so I made the recipe. And it was tasty. I did add more salt, to taste.

NO one in the family liked this. Guess I'll stay with chicken marsala from now on.

After reading the reviews, I was scared to try it. But it wasn't that bad, though not great, either. I'd use this as a base recipe and work from it, if I had the time.

Added onion and didn't add flour or water. Also I reduced each by a 1/4 cup on the wine and sherry. I liked the taste of the Marsala and overall it was good.

This was pretty good. Not over-the-top flavorful but good just the same. You can definately taste the Marsala & Sherry. I did add a red onion, and black pepper to add flavor because of the reviews. And an extra teaspoon of minced garlic. The only issue I had was that I used ground deer venison; if you're familiar with deer venison, you know there is no grease when browning the ground meat. So I had to add a little water before adding the flour because it was starting to stick to the bottom of the pan. I still added the 1/2 cup water when the recipe called for it. However, it was still very thick. I think I will try to thin it a bit next time. And, like I said, you can definately taste the wines, so if you're not a 'cooked wine' person, you may want to cut them back some. We served it over Angel Hair Pasta. We liked it and will most likely make it again.

I used more mushrooms and some sweet onion. I also added pink salt and peppercorns to it. I used more water to make the sauce thinner and used gluten free mix for the flour. Then I made thick zoodles to top it off. Yum!

I think it would have been better if I hadnâ€™t scraped the bottom of the pan as it gave it a kinda burnt taste . Other than that it was good.

Added some garlic powder in addition to the fresh garlic. Tasted very alcoholic like it didn't cook off I would use less sherry and Marsala next time - we made it with spaghetti
