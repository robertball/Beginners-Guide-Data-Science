I really enjoyed this recipe but made some minor changes to it.  I used a medium to large jar of marshmallow cream (instead of melting down marshmallows, that to me gives the aftertaster referenced in another review b/c they cook to fast and burn)  I also added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon and served it with assorted graham cracker sticks.  It was a big hit!

I did not care for this recipe. Tasteless with an aftertaste.  It was easy but not sweet.

This was very good! Next time, I will reduce the amount of peanut butter to 1 TBSP and add pumpkin pie spice to the mix. Personal preference! Otherwise, delicious!
