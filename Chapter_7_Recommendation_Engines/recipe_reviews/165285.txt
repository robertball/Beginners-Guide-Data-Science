I cooked the green beans a little longer (about 5 minutes) in the sauce to really soak up the Thai flavor.  It's great side dish to serve over steamed rice and to go with grill fish or chicken.

I didn't have a bird's eye chili or lemon grass, so I used this recipe as an inspiration, and it turned out really well.  I am sure it would be great made as is too.  I subbed lime juice for the lemon grass and I subbed homemade hot sauce for the chile.  I didn't bother with the blender step, and I used organic green beans that I had frozen over the summer and since I had blanched them then, I skipped that step in the recipe and just put the frozen beans in the sauce after it had simmered down.  The beans turned out a little more done than I would have liked, but they were still really good.  I'm sure it would be even better made with fresh beans, but this is a nice and flexible recipe.

I was low on fish sauce so this only got maybe half of what is asked for.  I pureed the sauce,  used slightly more than half a cup of coconut milk, and tasted.  One seeded pepper didn't do much for me.  I kept adding peppers, seeds and all, ended up with 10 peppers. Dd said do 8 next time.

Turned out really great. The wife loved it. I think next time I'll serve it on rice. Also, I topped it with some crushed peanuts.

A nice easy side veggie dish with a bit of flavor.  I couldn't find a fresh bird's eye chile, so I chopped up a couple dried chile peppers.  Still very tasty, but I'd probably put more in next time since I like more spice.

This was ok but I really didn't care for the taste.
