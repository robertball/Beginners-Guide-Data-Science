Delicious but... lots of steps. Start the water first. Use more gouda in the puree. Season the puree heavily. Roast the cauliflower longer and/or at a higher temp for browning.

This recipe was hard to follow so I made quite a few changes, but overall it was very tasty and a great idea.  My family enjoyed it.
