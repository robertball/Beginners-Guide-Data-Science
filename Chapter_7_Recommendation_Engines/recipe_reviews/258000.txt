Fabulous!!!!  Thank you for the recipe. 
I was not able to marinate for 4 hours ,  only 2 1/2 maybe 3 hours. Cooked at 400 for 15 minutes, covered with foil and upped the temp to 425 for 30 minutes, uncovered  for an additional 15 minutes . The ribs were tender and tasty. I look forward to making them again , marinating for longer  and baking pe the r eclipse. A definite keeper.
