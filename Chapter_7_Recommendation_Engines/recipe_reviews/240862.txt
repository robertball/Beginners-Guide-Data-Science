A great eggless French Toast recipe. The nutritional yeast adds a distinct, but pleasant taste. I made a batch without it and it was fine both ways. However, if you leave it out you will need to compensate with some more flour as it will be runnier. I used gluten free rice flour and gluten free bread. In each of my batches I used almond milk. I was able to use 8 pieces of sandwich bread with the original recipe. Quite delicious, thank you HeatherMonroe for the recipe.

I used regular almond milk instead of soy, and was a little more heavy-handed with my spices & vanilla (I added nutmeg as well). The french toast crisped up nicely & was delicious!

The only changes I made to this recipe were subtracting the nutritional yeast (I added a little extra flour to compensate) and substituting brown sugar for raw sugar. For me, it just wasn't sweet or flavorful enough. If I ever decide to make this again I will definitely add some spices and probably more sugar as well. :)

I was very curious about this recipe. I did not have the yeast but in reading the other comments I replaced the flour and yeast with tapioca flour starch. I used coconut sugar instead of raw sugar.  I also add the spice Cardamon to bring an added zing.  The second time I tried this I halted the recipe as I had to much batter the first time. I worked perfectly for three slices.   Definetly a Saturday morning treat.

I must try again. Mine looked like epic fail. But I like the concept. The bread stuck like crazy to the pan.
