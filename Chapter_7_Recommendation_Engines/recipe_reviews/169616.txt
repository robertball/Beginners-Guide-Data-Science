Very tasty thanks for this one. My in-laws are from Vietnam so I have stiff competition when it comes to stir fries, but this recipe, won the family over and I plan to cook it again.  I added a bell pepper and about 2 TBSP sugar to the sauce but otherwise changed nothing. Next time I will make more sauce because it was very good, and would be great over extra rice. Tips* to make the wok extra hot, and not to make the food soggy I stir fry all my stir fry dishes one part at a time.  For example first fry up the peas, take them out and set aside, then do the mushrooms, continue until everything is complete, and then once everything is hot and crispy toss it in the wok or skillet with the sauce of your choice. I learned this from an Asian cooking show that was teaching how to make the best stir fry if you do not have a restaurant quality wok with a burning flame in your home. Since using this technique my food has improved greatly in this style of cooking. I hope it will work for you also.

This was excellent! The only reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 is that is was SUPER spicy. Me and hubby really like the spice but it was almost too much for us which leads me to believe it would be WAY too hot for most people. Scale back on the heat and you have yourself a fabulous meal.

WOW!  If you are a garlic lover, a seafood lover, and like an asian inspired dish with some heat, STOP, you have found the perfect recipe!  This was really delicious, I prepared exactly as written and just added some more veg, some shredded carrot and red pepper strips.  Served over jasmine rice spiked with carrot and fine diced red peppers.  Hubby raved over this.  Thanks for a very delicious recipe, will keep this one in the rotation for sure.

I used this recipe as a basis and then adjusted to my own taste.  Here are my variations:

Added 1 small sweet yellow onion
Doubled sauce recipe(vinegar, chicken broth, sherry and fish sauce)
Doubled corn starch/water
Added 1 tsp sugar
used and entire head of garlic(about 15 cloves)

I prepped the ingredients first, then made the sauce.  I halved the jumbo shrimp(Costco fresh shrimp are awesome) and soaked them in the sauce while I was cooking the veggies.  I then added the shrimp and continued cooking for about a minute then added the sauce and finally the corn startch slurry.  

I served this over Jasmine Rice and it was incredible.  Better than any Chinese restaraunt I've ever had it at.

Kudos on this great recipe.

I love this - I was truly crazy about it!! My DH liked it, and my step son did not (And i left out the red peppers in hopes that he'd like it - so next time I'll make it with the red pepper flakes too :) I used 1tbsp canola and 1tbsp sesame oil, yum! I didn't have fish sauce, so I used clam juice. Other than that I followed the recipe, well less garlic but will use a bit more next time too. Yum -thanks for a great recipe!

This is very tasty shrimp stir-fry recipe. I cut back on the garlic though, by only using 2 garlic cloves. 10 garlic cloves is way too much garlic for me! I served it over hot  steamed rice, as suggested.

This was exceptionally good. I was surprised at the flavor. No soy sauce which is great. I had a little too much red pepper in it so will cut back the next time. A little too much heat for me. If you are using fish sauce, I don't think salt is needed, especially if you also use chicken stock or broth that is salted. I thought mine was quite salty. I also doubled the sauce.

This was WAY too salty and spicy. If I make this again I will leave out the salt, black pepper, and red pepper. Why call it shrimp with garlic if you can't taste either one?

Fixed as written and it was delish.....I think my garlic cloves were too small and I think I would add even more garlic. The red pepper flakes added the perfect amount of zip. Very, very good

I am not adverse to spicy at all, especially if it is flavorful.  I halved the crushed red peppers and black pepper though, anticipating that it called for too much.  Even halved, all this tasted like was fire.  You could not taste the shrimp.  This is the first recipe I have ever given one star to, and I use this site practically daily.

Made exactly as instructed, it resulted in a truly awful fail. Having made many, many stir fries I looked forward to this so much I entered it in my recipe file before even trying it. That was a mistake that's since been remedied. Too much fish sauce, too much salt, too much red pepper, and WAY too much garlic (the latter by at least a factor of three). There were probably shrimp in there somewhere, but if you searched for them by taste you wouldn't have a clew they were present. Once served, we couldn't eat it and ended up having leftover pork roast instead.

Delicious.  Since I was cooking for young people I cut the red pepper flakes in half.  Still plenty spicy for us.

Very good!  And easy!  I pretty much followed directions exact, except since I had bean sprouts I threw them in.  I also used shiitake mushrooms in place of the white button mushrooms.  I made egg rolls to go with and this was quite a tasty "lupper" (lunch and supper combined).  Hubby said next time he'd prefer a little less "heat", so I'll knock it down to 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes for him.

Very quick and easy meal to make.  I used about half of the garlic that is called for in the recipe & it was still plenty for my family. Would have given it 5 stars if not for that.

The real secret is not overcooking the shrimp.  In addition, I always use peanut oil when cooking Asian dishes.  The oil will not smoke at higher temperatures (that's why it is used on submarines), thus taking less time to fry and keeps vegetables el dente.  Also omitted the black pepper, used extra pepper flakes and went a bit heavier on the fresh ginger.

This was very good.  I had used my mushrooms for another recipe and so had to go without.  It would be even better with them.  I used dried ginger.  Next time  I would reduce the red pepper flakes a little.  We served over Chow Mein noodles.  Would make again and make sure I had the mushrooms on hand.

I doubled up the sauce and we really enjoyed it.    The lower elementary kids like the sauce fine.  My husband and I eat spicy food so this wasn't spicy enough for us; we added garlic chili paste to "doctor" it up.

This was super salty. Besides the abundance of salt, the flavor was really great. No salt next time and it should be better.
