The burgers were moist and had a nice flavor but next time I will probably only use half the amount of liquid smoke.  It seemed a little over powering but maybe it's because I have not used it in very many recipes.  Thanks...it was a nice change from the regular grilled burgers.

The recipe is simple and made my burgers turn out juicy and delicious.  I would an egg to make to burgers stick better, but overall it was fantastic.

The best hamburgers ever!  Sometimes I add 1/2 tsp of Montreal Steak seasoning to add some zip.  But I got rave reviews from family on this one.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were soooo good.  I only used a 1/2 tablespoon of liquid smoke, and I'm glad I did because I think it would've been overpowering otherwise.  I also used 1 clove fresh garlic instead of powder.

Definitely lives up to it's name! These are some of the best burgers we've tried on this site to date. We loved the smoky, BBQ taste the liquid smoke gave these. I used the whole tablespoon and it wasn't overpowering. If you don't like liquid smoke this isn't your burger. There's no need to rub with oil or seasoned salt.  We used 85/15 burger meat. UPDATE: We've had so many requests for this recipe that we've even had to scale these up to 48 for our own July 4th party and bring these to other people's BBQ's instead of the regularly requested pasta or potato salad!!!

These burgers were very easy, and VERY tasty! Didn't have garlic powder, so I used onion powder.  Also, I mixed in the oil and seasoned salt with the meat rather than coating the outside of the patty. I topped mine with a slice of provolone cheese before taking off the grill.  YUMMY!

I had 4lbs of burger, and found this recipe appealing as well as "Juiciest Hamburgers Ever" by Jane.  I doubled this one and combined it with the other recipe which called for 2 lbs of hamburger.  Excellent combo.

Great recipe for hamburgers.  I grilled these on an indoor grill.  It gave it a very smoky/bbq-ish flavor.  Nice juicy burger. I will make these again next burger night.

Really tasty, and a great alternative to regular burgers! I made a few minor changes. 1) Cut the liquid smoke in half. 2) Add 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning: McCormicks Hamburger seasoning or Montreal Steak. 3) Add 1 egg white (optional, but it makes the meat stick together much better). Oh, and the olive oil is totally unnecessary. With these changes, the burgers were excellent! Smoky with a bit of zesty spice. They got rave reviews from everyone!

Added about 1 tble BBQ sauce. Used only 1/2 tble of liquid smoke and only a 1/2 tea garlic powder. Also, I take the burgers out of the refrigerator about a half hour before grilling.

This recipe was delicious! Used for the 4th of July BBQ, and everyone loved the burgers! I had someone who had 3 burgers and we ended up running out, so my dad went to the store to get more beef. Here are some pointers I'd add:  1. I used Ground Chuck Beef, always have for making burger patties. Want to look for 80-85% on the label to see how lean the meat is. 2. I didn't have the liquid smoke flavoring on hand and didn't use it. The burgers still came out tasting great! 3. When mixing the ingredients with the beef, I really got my hands into the beef so that there were no air bubbles. Knead the mixture well. This helps keep the patties from falling apart when grilling. None of my burgers fell apart and were grilled to perfection!

I added a tbsp of horseradish sauce and 1 tbsp of Frank's original hot sauce to the recipe.  The combination of the flavors were surprisingly flavorful and delicious.  My family loved it.  It had just enough zing for my taste not the regular boring burger.

These were excellent.  Using the suggestions, I also halved the liquid smoke and used fresh garlic instead of powder.  I also put smoked gouda on top and they were absolutely delicious.   I used ground bison sirloin.   Looking forward to warm weather so I can try these over charcoal.

Wonderful burgers.  Quadrupled recipe for BBQ of all guys - only had a couple left - really enjoyed them.  Did not feel it was to smoky at all w/ the liquid smoke, following others suggestions to have a slightly smaller amt per pound.  Next time, will probably keep the measurement as called for because we really like the smoky flavor.

Easy and quick way to add a little something extra to our grilled burgers. The garlic flavor was complimentary and I couldn't even tell it had liquid smoke in it once we charcoal grilled these. Although this was a good burger, it wasn't all that memorable or outstanding. I'll probably fix these again.

We've been looking for a recipe to add some additional flavor to traditional hamburgers. I didn't have liquid smoke and maybe that was the downfall, but while these added some good flavor it wasn't quite enough. Will try again with the liquid smoke.

Very good burgers. 1/2 the liquid smoke is the way to go as suggested by another review. I will play with this some more to get it to my personal liking. I brushed a liberal amount of olive oil on the burgers, and will do that on every burger I will cook for the rest of my life.

This was a good and easy recipe.I like it simple, no long list of spices and it had a great taste.I had to replace the worcestershire sauce with soy sauce(I had none),but they still came out tasting great.I tried not to flip the burgers to many times so they wouldn't fall apart it worked fine.I have also learned that if I indent the middle, leave alittle pool of sort, it keeps the burgers from getting to thick while they cook.Will make these again.

We thought these were a nice change from plain hamburger patties...I followed the advice of others and cut the amount of liquid smoke in half but next time will use the full amount we like that smokey flavor.

I have to start by saying that I am not a big fan of burgers in general and this came out pretty impressive!  I didnt have the liquid smoke flavoring, will have to look for it at the store next time.  I used 50/50 beef/pork meat, took one of the advises and added 2 eggs (I doubled the serving), I also fried up some onions into it and instead of garlic powder I put in fresh garlic.  They really were juicy and my family LOVED them!  :)

These are the best burgers I've ever had!!! I also added fresh garlic and an egg as suggested by other reviews. I went a step further and topped them with colby jack cheese and a slice of grilled pineapple. The pineapple pairs so well with the smokey flavor of the liquid smoke. My kids loved them as well, we'll never eat another burger.

My family loved these burgers.    Following the suggestions here, I only used 1/2 tablespoon of Liquid Smoke per pound.  This imparted a good but not over-powering smoky taste.  Next time I will make four burgers per pound as we found these a bit too large.

I used regular ground beef (not lean) and substituted the oil with 1 egg per 1.5 pounds of meat. Instead of using liquid smoke, I used a cajun "cowboy" spice - about 3/4 tsp per 1.5 pounds of meat. I used my George Foreman to cook them. They turned out great!

I give this recipe 5 stars on one condition - reduce liquid smoke to 1/4 teaspoon.  I cannot fathom 1T.  I don't like recipes with lots of chopped veggies and eggs and bread - I think the burgers end up tasting like meatloaf instead of burgers.  This recipe gave the burgers a real meaty, smoky taste.  I used 90% (or was it 93%???) lean beef and they tasted better than lean burgers usually taste.

I don't like this recipe.  The burgers were tender and juicy but the flavor is too strong.  I used this recipe because I had liquid smoke on hand.  I have a brick fire pit that uses charcoal.  The cooking process alone imparts a wonderful flavor to the burgers, no need for the liquid smoke.

These were excellent! Mixed the ground beef before work, let it sit in the fridge all day to "meld" and then grilled them for dinner.  YUM.

The meat mixture smelled incredibly good, and it filled the kitchen with a wondrous aroma.  But the burgers tasted little different than the ones I just season with salt and pepper.  They were very moist, though, and that part was good.

Just needed a quick dash of liquid smoke that's all. I like bacon on our burgers so I fry that first then fry the patties in the bacon fat so I omitted the olive oil in the recipe. Best burgers ever! I like how they don't need eggs or breadcrumbs in the mix....just be sure to use good quality lean ground beef.

Absolutely great!  I only made a couple of changes.  I left out the seasoned salt and used kosher salt and ground black pepper.  I also added some onion powder.  Make these a lot now.  I recommend this recipe to others quite often.

I don't eat red meat, however, my gang, plus a couple of friends loved these burgers. I love how "liquid smoke" enchances the flavor of certain dishes and this really did the trick (according to my group. I used my indoor, top of stove grill pan for these. Thanks "BIGGUY" for a great burger!!

I made these burgers for my family.  I didn't have any liquid smoke, so from the reviews of others, I substituted barbecue sauce and also added an egg.

They were very delicious.  I'm going to have to get some liquid smoke (I've never used it or purchased it before) and try them that way.  

My husband does not like the leaner ground beef (he prefers 85% lean), but our grocery store had the 93% on sale, so by adding the olive oil, he didn't mind one bit.

These were pretty good. For a long time I've been dumb about how to season ground beef for hamburgers, so I can always use new ideas. I made these exactly as written, using 85% lean ground beef. This was also the first time I'd ever bought Morton's "Season-All" seasoned salt (I see a lot of recipes that call for seasoned salt, so it was about time). I've used my countertop grill a fair amount, and was pleasantly surprised to find that these burgers grilled better (quicker and more well-done) than most things I've grilled; perhaps the brushing-with-olive-oil step helped with that? I have more of the ingredients, so I'm going to make another batch tonight.

C'est bien. They were good, family loved them. Nice and juicy; just omitted the liquid smoke but didn't seem to miss out on it. Never going to use frozen patties again-these were so easy and delicious.

The receipt was simple and the result was outstanding! The mix of ingredients was well balanced, but I did take the suggestion of reducing the liquid smoke down to a half a tablespoon. My son - a picky eater – gone back for seconds! Hooray for the recipe! Outstanding!!!

So, so delicious! A little too smoky, but it didn't ruin it. I just tasted smoke for hours! Juicy, good texture. Perfect! Needed a tad more salt.

Very good, little heavy on the liquid smoke though. We decided to modify and make Juicy Lucy's using this main recipe. Very tasty!

In my opinion (and my husband's!), these burgers are better than those at Applebee's or Chili's.  I took the advice of several other reviews and only added 1/2 tablespoon of liquid smoke flavoring.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of steak rub seasoning (I used my uncle's personal recipe for that) and they tasted great!  I usually like lots of condiments on my burgers...But these are good enough to eat plain!!!

Definitely a juicy, tasty burger.  I took others suggestions and halved the liquid smoke (might not next time just to see), and next time I will add an egg yolk for easier handling, but overall this was a winner.

the juiciest burgers i've ever made. i left out the liquid smoke and eyeballed the amount of garlic and onion powder. we like that flavor. it was DELICIOUS! I'll definitely keep this recipe for summer grilling.

good recipe. my husband chose it for one of our weekend grill outs. i was skeptical about the liquid smoke (never  used it before) so i used a little less than the recipe calls for. i also added grated onion for moisture. the burgers turned out yummy. next time i will add grill seasoning for extra flavor.

These were good - I wouldn't call them great but they did have a good flavor - next time I will up the amount of worcestershire and maybe throw in some crushed red pepper.

We loved it. We stopped getting the frozen patties because hubby liked your recipe and wanted to make our own hamburger patties from now on. Used the leftover patties for Spanish rice recipe.

These are so good. I always make mine with garlic salt/powder, Worcestershire sauce and hamburger grill seasonings. I leave out the liquid smoke because we do not like the flavor of it. It tasted so good when I add the oil and season salt. Taste just like the local drive thru. Made my Memorial Day menu fabulous! Thanks for sharing.

Good flavor but with the absence of egg or some type of binder mine did not seem to solid and together. I also added a tsp of garlic powder too. Overall not bad.

The name says it all "Delicious". Had a large group of family and friends over for a BBQ, they all raved about the burgers. I made the patties a little thinner and placed cheese in the middle and coveres with another patty and crimped the patties together.

Awesome!  I grilled these burgers on my George Foreman and they tasted like they were grilled on a charcoal grill outdoors.  I followed the recipe but reduced the Liquid Smoke to about 1/4 teaspoon.  That was plenty!

Really good flavor!  I doubled the recipe(light on the garlic) & added a jar of cooked bacon pieces & some coarse black pepper.  Served on toasted buns with melted colby cheese.  Also good to top with BBQ sauce and  sweet onion.  Thank you for sharing your recipe for a great burger!

I'm giving this 4 stars because everyone at my cookout raved about them, but I didn't even get to try one!  I omitted the liquid smoke, as I wasn't sure if everyone would like it.  Will try it with the smoke next time when I'm cooking for just me. :)

I followed the revisions, using half the liquid smoke and adding steak seasoning. I grill them low and slow so they stay juicy. We had them last night and my family thought they were incredible! Thanks for this great recipe!

These were very juicy and tasted pretty good.  The smoke flavor was strong and I used a teaspoon.  I think I would go 1/2t next time.  The garlic was also a big flavor and I love garlic, but I would cut that down a bit also.  Overall a good burger.  Thanks for sharing.

I added about half the amount of liquid smoke and would further decrease it next time as the flavor was a little too prominent.  However, we really enjoyed these burgers with a topping of feta cheese.

I tried this recipe on a charcoal fired grill. The burgers were tender, but not especially flavorful. I added an egg as suggested by one reviewer, but it made the patties almost too soft for the grill.

These are delish!  I omitt the liquid smoke since I don't really care for that taste, but they are still great without it.  I make them year round.  Last night I made a batch on my George Foreman.  Great recipe!

Delicious savory burgers. I changed up the recipe just a bit by adding Paprika, minced garlic, and basting with BBQ sauce right before taking it off the grill. Added some cheddar cheese on top and made a couple sides of spinach and green beans. It was delicious, I found 5 min on each side gets them very well done, so I flipped them a little quicker to get a nice pink center. Would definitely make again.

Great recipe!  We omitted the liquid smoke, as we cooked on a charcoal grill.  Grill time was a little longer for us and we used a lid until last 2 minutes.  Juicy, tender, flavorful!  A real keeper!

I was looking for a way to add some extra taste to our grilled burgers. I liked this recipe because the ingredients were simple and always on hand. I will definitely use this recipe again.

The burgers were delicious. We used the exact recipe except halving the Liquid Smoke.  I'm glad we did or it might have been too smokey. Thanks for sharing.

Used extra lean ground beef, and was dry.  The liquid smoke was a bit pungent.

These burgers were a big hit!  I do not care for the smokey/barbecue flavor, so I didn't use the smokey sauce.  However, I did add 1 egg to help hold the meat together which was relatively successful.  I had also added a small amount of ketchup and mustard, but I think I will leave those out next time.  My husband will definitely want these tasty burgers again.

Like others suggested, I only used half of the Liquid Smoke; added about 1/2 tsp onion powder and a splash of low-sodium soy sauce. Also sprinkled them with garlic pepper and fried them indoors. No bun necessary! Great hamburger steak!!!

Very good and simple recipe.
I made just a minor change and used McCormick Hamburger seasoning in place of the seasoned salt and cut back the garlic powder to a 1/2 tsp.
These burgers were very flavorful and enjoyed by all at my BBQ.

These burgers are the best! I have made them so many times I can't even count. I follow recipe as is except I add in a teaspoon of onion powder. They are packed with flavor and always turn out super moist. Always has been my favorite burgers and probably always will be.

Pretty good.  I read all 168 reviews before I made the burgers. It scared me into using only a teaspoon of liquid smoke. But I also used only a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.  Has anyone ever read the ingredients of Worcestershire sauce?   Liquid smoke gets all the bad rap, according to these reviews, but it's probably the Worcestershire that makes it taste bad to some tastes.  Not hamburger friendly.

I found the burger very juicy but that the liquid smoke was very strong even though i used less then recommended. I added some steak spices, onion flakes and garlic powder.

Yummy!  We had these for a bbq a few weekends ago and thanks to this recipe, my husband is now the grill master. :)  I added two eggs for three pounds of hamburger (I used 93/7 beef) and they turned out super juicy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted a change and this recipe may be  a new favorite.  I used less liquid smoke- about 3/4 t., and I thought the flavors were great!  My husband thought these were the best. I will definitely make them again.

I used 1/2 Tablespoon of liquid smoke, as the other reviews suggested.  And I just mixed all of the ingredients together at one time.  I would say to only cook them for 4 minutes per side.  Also, try to make the patties more flat.  Mine were a bit too rounded which made them too small for the bun.  But the flavor...  definitely a keeper!  Because we are trying to eat less, I made 4 patties instead of 3.  Now I have 2 burgers in the freezer for next time.

Very good! I didn't use the liquid smoke or the olive oil.  Instead, I used the worchestershire sauce, some fresh black pepper, a garlic-salt blend, and some Montreal Steak seasoning - came out great!

I love this recipe. My meat lover husband couldn't stop raving over this dish.  I added bacon bits to the meat as well, which added a nice touch to every bite.  We didn't think the liquid smoke was too much. I think I added a bit more than the recipe said.  Overall, I will be sure to make this recipe again!

i didnt change a thing. first off they are way to strong. the taste really wasnt that great. maybe if i did change the amounts of liq smoke it might have came out better but i dont believe in messing this someones reciepes the first time i make it to see how it taste the way they make it.
again
if made they way it states-- taste is way to strong
changed.-- maybe it would be good. 
some ppl at the bbq tryed these and no one who did like them.

These burgers are awesome! No modifications are necessary. I doubled the recipe and grilled them for a small family get together. Everyone loved them!

These were the BEST burgers, especially with quality meat (no shrinkage).  Mystery solved for great burgers, thanks so much!

This was really good.  I cut down on the smoke as mentioned and added seasoned salt.  It was yummy.  I will keep this as my burger recipe.

I love these burgers and make them often!  Sometimes I add a touch of diced onion to give them a little extra zip -- but really the recipe is great as is.

This is my new go to burger recipe.  If your not a fan of liquid smoke than definitely cut back on that.  I used soy sauce the first time instead of Worcestershire because I didn't have any and they were still great.  Thanks

Used 1 t. liquid smoke as suggested by other users, still too much.  May have worked if pan fried, the grill gave too much flavor. They were juicy. Won't make again.

Very tasty and full of flavor!  I didn't have liquid smoke, but the burgers were still tasty without it.  I also just mixed the olive oil and the seasoned salt in with the rest of the ingredients.  Delicious!

So few ingredients surely made such a wonderfully tasty and juicy burger. I will make these often. Inside, or out. They were so simple. Thanks.

Yum!  I really liked this.  It had a good flavor to it, not just the same old boring hamburger.  My kids liked it too.  Thanks!
