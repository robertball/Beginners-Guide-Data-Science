Great and easy to make, and good for you. What more could you ask for! I don't like my salads sweet so I only added a scant teaspoon of sugar. I can't seem to grate onions so I chopped real small. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have coriander so used dill instead, which I did like. I thought the black pepper added a bizarre spicy bite I didn't like.  I will make again, leaving out the pepper and trying with the suggested coriander.

The cumin is a nice surprise to the dressing. I also added 2 stalks of diced celery for extra crunch.  I'll be making this again!

I really liked this recipe- simple and great for some leftover cucumber I had! I do think it needs to sit overnight for optimum flavor though. Otherwise the onions are a little strong.

Used the spiralizer on the cukes instead of slicing them.  Nice change from mayo-based slaw, and I liked how low this was in calories, carbs, and fat.  Also, the coriander added a nice flavor to this quick slaw.

Quick, easy and delicious.  I was worried when I saw only apple cider vinegar and no oil to dilute the tang, but the sugar helps to balance the acidity.  The coriander is a pleasant surprise. My family couldn't stop picking at it even after finishing dinner. My favorite cucumber salad so far.

This recipe was pretty good. However, if you are like me and like a bit more of a punch versus a sweet flavor. Lower the amount of sugar and increase the amount of cider a bit.

I made this for my annual teacher friends first day of school dinner.  It was eh"  Everyone took a little,  It was interesting, the dressing had no mayo which was nice, but of course the sugar took it's place.  The coriander made it kind of weird.  Overall I would give it a 6 out of 10

I substituted green onions for regular ones so I didn't need to chill the onions before mixing it with the other ingredients. I also ran out of apple cider vinegar and substituted about 1 tablespoon of  plain vinegar with about 3 tablespoons of apple juice.

I really liked it. Took so little to make, I read the comments on the onion over powering the dish if not left over night so I substituted for green onion and didn't find them to over power. My husband found the vinegar taste too much but I thought it was just right.

I made this exactly as written.  Next time I'll add some crushed red chili pepper to give it a little zip, and will also peel the cucumbers.  We loved the corrainder flavor.  Easy to make, tasty, and even healthy - what more could you ask for.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night to go with grilled chicken and I'm already craving it the next morning. I spiralized the cucumber and the carrots as well, and instead of grating the onion, I sliced it paper-thin (I used red onion). I realized at the last minute that I didn't have coriander so I subbed fresh Italian parsley instead. Next time I'll have the coriander on hand. Yummy delish!
