Your recipe is awesome and a five star as is! However, I can't help tweak a recipe to my liking but the only true change I made with your recipe was to use 1/3 heaping cup fresh finely shredded parmesan. I know garlic powder and onion powder is easier but I took the extra effort for the fresh equivalents (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp minced garlic and 1 heaping tbsp fresh minced onion). I also made the entire five pounds and simply placed wax paper between the many extra uncooked patties, placed them in a zip lock bag and froze them for future use ;-)

Loved this easy recipe.  I mixed all of the ingredients this morning and placed in the refrigerator allowing everything to blend.  Just prior to grilling, I made into patties.  Had no problem with getting the burgers to stick together - they were just perfect.  I did brush the rolls with olive oil and sprinkled them with garlic powder before toasting the rolls.  Used mayo, lettuce, tomato, shredded parmesan cheese, sliced red onion. Served Sandwich Stuffers - Bread & Butter pickles and corn on the cob on the side.   Thanks steveandjackie for sharing your recipe - a keeper for me!

These were delicious!  Moist and flavorful as advertised.  I used a bit of extra cheese in the meat mixture.  Also, I topped them with extra cheese and crispy bacon.  I cooked them in a skillet on medium-high heat for 6 minutes per side, since I don't have a grill.  Next time, I may add the bacon crumbled in the burger and let the mixture sit in the fridge for an hour to let the flavors soak in a bit.  Also, I may throw in some diced jalape√±o for a little kick.  But, even without any changes, this recipe would be great!

I had organic grass fed beef to use so figured the  olive oil in this recipe would be the perfect addition.  Scaled to one pound and made 4 burgers. Served with extra sharp cheddar and smoked gouda.  Now my go to for burgers.

You know, it doesn't get much easier or tastier than these burgers! Great recipe...I scaled back for one pound of beef, topped with all the good stuff and there wasn't one scrap left over!

I scaled this way back and just made two burgers.  I skipped the egg and had no problems with these falling apart on the grill.  I couldn't really taste the parmesan in this so next time I might just leave it out.  Regardless, I thought the taste was great!

wow! I was looking for a simple recipe since I am married to THE pickiet man ever! I had all the ingredients on hand and made only 1 lb of meat but was able to get 5 patties out of it since I didn't want them too thick. The meat was 96% lean since we are trying to eat healthier and I cooked them using my george foreman. I was afraid they would be too dry but nope. I added some mayo to the buns and toasted them. Delish!

This is the absolute BEST burger I've ever had!!! I halved the recipe & my kids are fighting over the 1 leftover. Guess I'll be making these w/the full 5 lbs of ground beef next time. Wow! Thank you, steveandjackie!!!

Awesome burgers!  I'm new to cooking and am looking for easy, but flavorful ways to spice up dinners.  This definitely fit the bill.  Juicy, flavorful, but not overly complex.  Topped it with a slice of cheddar cheese.  Will definitely be using this again.

I was not as impressed with these as others were. The patty did not want to hold together very well and the flavor for me was just not much different than my plain beef burgers with some montreal steak seasoning on the top. Thanks anyway.

I make these all the time. When it is too cold for the grill I spread them flat in a cookie sheet and cook in oven for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. Great served on Kings Hawaiian rolls. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I scaled this back to 5 hamburgers.  I used 1 egg in the mix and they held together very well.  This is very similar to my regular recipe with the addition of the Parmesan cheese and the egg.  I think they would have held together fine without the egg.  You could not taste the Parmesan cheese, so next time I would either increase the amount or leave it out of the recipe.  We enjoyed these burgers with 'Corn Off the Cob Salad' and 'Cauliflower and Egg Salad' both recipes from AR.

I thought these were very good and moist. I scaled this to 1.5lbs ground sirloin but used 2T parm. I don't buy powdered garlic or onion so I added a bit of minced onion and used homemade garlic infused olive oil. Good stuff!

Being really tired of tasteless ground beef I decided to give this recipe a try.  Though I liked the choice of seasonings I felt that the Worcestershire sauce flavor was overwhelming.  But most disappointing was the texture of the burger, it had the texture of meatloaf.  I'll keep looking for a great hamburger recipe.

Delicious juicy burger!  Topped mine with monterey cheese.  Will make again!  I used lean sirloin instead of chuck, and it was just as flavorful and juicy.

These are some of the best burgers I have ever tasted and were just as juicy and flavorful when I re-heated the leftovers.  Those of you who said the patties did not hold together I would suggest that you refrigerate them for 15 minutes before cooking.  Also, don't make the meat too wet.  I don't want to be Captain Obvious here, but remember that this recipe is based on FIVE POUNDS of meat.  I only used about 1 pound of meat so I used 1 egg and reduced  the worcestershire to about 2 teaspoons and the olive oil to 1 teaspoon.Then of course I scaled the dry ingredients back one fifth.  These burgers were fantastic and I can't wait to make them again.

I made these one weekend as sliders and cooked them on the grill with no trouble at all. I wanted something flavorful but not onion soup burgers, and these came out as good as they sound. I didn't expect much flavor from so little Parmesan, so unlike other reviewers, I wasn't disappointed that I couldn't taste the cheese. I think that addition serves more as more of a binder.

Very good recipe my husband liked it better than what I usually make.  I divided it by fourths and made 1lb. of beef use 1 egg and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce.

YUM! I scaled the recipe down to only make 2 burgers, and in place of the 1/4 of an egg, I used some mayo, and that worked well. I made mine earlier in the day and refrigerated them until I was ready to cook them, which allowed the flavors to blend and kept them together nicely. These came out very moist and flavorful...these are a keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made these and they were scrumptous I would have given them 5 stars but they were a little mushy and kept falling apart on the grill but other than that everyone loved them and I will be making these again but with less liquid :)

Delicious. Try 4 lbs beef 1 lb ground mild Italian sausage. 3 tbsp garlic powder 3 garlic cloves minced. 1/3 minced sweet onion with 1 tbsp onion powder. 1/3 cup shredded park cheese. 4 tbsp poison sauce. So much flavour BBQ'd. also serve with alder smoked bacon and swiss cheese. High on the calories but high on everybody's  satisfaction. Enjoy.

Loved this recipe! Only change I switched out some of the olive oil with bacon grease and YUM! Burgers held together perfectly and there were no leftovers. A definite keeper. Thanks!
