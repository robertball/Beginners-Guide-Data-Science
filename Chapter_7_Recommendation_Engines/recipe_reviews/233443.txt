Decent recipe, and while I followed the recipe I'm thinking if I make it again I'll add Parmesan cheese

Great recipe that satisfied my craving for carbonara without the noodles. Next time we will use less oil when cooking the bacon, and add cherry tomatoes. Adding Parmesan is a must!

Cooked the bacon in the oven and used just a bit of the bacon fat  in the skillet. Didnâ€™t use the olive oil. Also, Parmesan cheese made a good addition to the recipe. Added a salad on the side. The whole family really enjoyed this recipe!

Loved It! Very simple. We will make it again. Just a few things that I ran into. Reduce the olive oil. The bacon will provide plenty of oil. I followed the directions as a first attempt, because in the past, I've run into where the squash does absorb most of the oil. I also think I may have over baked my squash, since it practically turned into a chowder, thick soup like consistency when I was done mixing, but that wasn't a bad thing. It was still good! As my shredded squash sat while I prepared the bacon, there was a lot of juice. I didn't catch that until I dumped the squash into the pan. That may have also contributed to it's soupiness. Overall, very good and will make it again. It's a new comfort dish for my family!

I didn't add olive oil. Made the bacon and then drained the fat and patted the bacon with paper towel.  Then add that to the squash in a separate skillet or bowl. It's way too greasy otherwise.

I used half of the oil, and it was still way too greasy.  I used big, thick pieces of bacon, and it was overpowering, and maybe contributed to it being too greasy.  I also didn't see much purpose in adding the egg whites at the end.  It was a lot of work for a not very good recipe, in my opinion.

This was SO good! I cut the olive oil down by half and added Parmesan cheese at the end. Otherwise I followed the recipe.

Followed the recipe almost exactly and it was delicious! I did not have fresh basil, so I used dried. I am not a great cook and this was easy and yummy! Definitely will use this one again!

So many paleo spaghetti squash recipes don't quite work, this one does! It balances the flavors beautifully without being too wet.
