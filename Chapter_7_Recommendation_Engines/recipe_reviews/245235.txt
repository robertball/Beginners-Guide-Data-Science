I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  It has lots going on... savory, sweet, crunchy.  I finely chopped the brussel spouts and kale so their taste is not over powering.  I'm making it again!

Great meal salad! We didn't have hazelnuts so used almonds instead, delicious. I wasn't sure the dressing would be sweet enough with only 1tsp maple syrup, but the sweetness from the sugared nuts and pomegranate seeds paired well with the tart dressing.
