Had Stevia so I used that instead of agave and threw in three  handfuls if blueberries, very tasty and quite satiating. (Update) I've made this three times now, the last two I did not use any sweetner and dropped the cinamon and increased the vanilla. The most recent batch was just a can of coconut milk , 1 Tablespoon of vanilla (the real stuff) and a handful of blueberries, oh and a 1/4 cup of finely shredded unsweetened coconut and of course the chia seeds. It's plenty sweet as is and very tasty. Satisfies my sweet tooth cravings.

I loved this recipe. However, as most of us do, I made some changes. I skipped the cinnamon, salt and strawberries (didn't have strawberries), and substituted one small can (8oz) of crushed pineapple, juice included. Went great with the coconut!

I was a little unclear about what the coconut milk meant in the ingredients, so I just used 2 cups of organic coconut  milk beverage that comes in an aseptic (shelf-stable) box. The other smaller portion of coconut milk might be referring to the stuff that comes in a can, but I didn't use any of that.  In any case, it turned out fine, though it's not very sweet on its own.  Mixed with fruit it's pretty tasty and a good substitute for pudding or yogurt as a snack.

I just had this at First Watch for breakfast and loved it.  So I came home and found this recipe and made some.  It was great.  It was thinner than the restaurant version,  maybe they used canned coconut milk and I used the stuff in the carton.  I added banana, dried blueberries and coconut granola on top.  Delicious!

This recipe turned out great! My kids enjoyed this and kept eating more! I added fruits like fresh pineapple, kiwi, pears and granola since I didn't have strawberries. It's a keeper!

I think this will be my standard go-tofor chia pudding as it thickens well and is very healthy. I used all un-sweetened coconut milk (2 and 1/3 cup), and added 2 tbsp regular sugar (rather than 1 tbsp agave syrup) to make up for it. I also added a pinch more cinnamon than called for and 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I like spice!

Great taste and consistency. I was timid with the cinnamon but will be more aggressive next time. I used Truvia instead of agave and was plenty sweet for me. I mix with raspberries and its amazing!

Terrific! There are no empty calories from starch, so I didn't feel bad that the whole batch disappeared almost at once. We thought we might add a bit more vanilla for our taste, but this was wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe!

Another great chia pudding recipe. I used all unsweet coconut milk and left out the salt. I left it in the fridge for almost 48 hours and it was still delicious. I preferred it without the fruit. Thank you for the recipe.

Made it for my potluck dinner and it was well received.  Made some modif cations to the recipes.
* was too thick -- will need to find some coconut milk that is not too creamy for I was unable to find "sweeten" coconut milk.  All the milks that I had found were unsweetened
* added an addition 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, 1/2 tbsp of agave syrup and 1 tsp more vanilla (since I was making 12 servings)

Next time will go to my local cold pressed juice place to get fresh coconut milk and try again

Perfect! As chia seed lovers, My 8 year-old DD and I make this often, using all organic ingredients.  We leave out the cinnamon and the optional strawberries, as we love the simplicity of the vanilla flavor. I love to add unsweetened coconut flakes on the top of my portion, but DD enjoys hers plain. This is such a great base recipe to incorporate your favorite add-ins and flavorings! The texture is spot-on and we can indulge on something healthy! Enjoy!

I've had this a few times made by others and was figuring out how to make it; My question is, do you use coconut milk beverage or coconut milk that comes in a can? I am confused about this, if anyone could answer that would be great, thanks!

This "Chia Coconut Pudding with Coconut Milk" tastes quite good. I was confused by the recipe: What is the difference between "coconut milk" and "unsweetened coconut milk"? I remember several years ago there was an issue with many Allrecipes recipes confusing "coconut-milk beverage" and “coconut milk” (which has an international definition for purposes of international trade). Allrecipes corrected some of the recipes from "coconut milk" to "coconut-milk beverage" at that time (2014?). I just used 2&1/3 cups of actual coconut milk, as specified in the recipe (albeit in a confusing way). I also used 1/4 teaspoon of stevia (HERBAL SELECT vegan non-bitter formula); however, I think agave nectar would have been better (more "mouth watering" properties).  For those of you who like to cook in metric,  my 1/2 cup of chai seeds weighted 87 grams (not 60 grams as in the metric version of this recipe). Thank you Donna Kim for sharing your recipe.

Thank you for the delicious and simple recipe! Was out of agave so I used a Tb of honey. After I made this a few times, I mixed it up and added a few big dollops of greek yogurt, half Ts of homemade ground ginger, 1/4 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes, 1 Tb of ground dried cilantro (not storebought) and 1 Tb of chopped fresh cilantro. Topped with fresh blueberries, bananas or any kind of fresh fruit, a drizzle of honey or agave, and good to go!

Very good basic recipe. I like to mash  up some banana in mine and drizzle a little honey on top. This pudding can make you very...regular if you know what I mean? It's chock full of fiber!

This has to be my new favorite ?? dessert. Not real sweet but flavorful and filling. I used papaya to keep it with a tropical flavor and a light touch of simple syrup using raw pure cane sugar. Which took it to a whole new lvl.

I used honey instead of the agave, still tastes amazing! I recommend leaving it overnight, it really helps take any “crunch” away from the chia seeds.

HOOKED! I've been looking for a chia seed coconut pudding recipe and this one is EXACTLY WHAT MY TASTEBUDS CALLED FOR and it is SO SIMPLE. I used canned unsweetened coconut milk for both portions of coconut milk and added just a tiny bit more agave nectar. It's so good after chilling overnight, some delicious grab and go breakfasts or desserts with some fruit and granola, amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about it as I wait for my pudding to chill.

I loved almost everything.  I would say add the cinnamon very sparingly because it dominated the flavor way too much.

Delicious breakfast.
I didn't add the agave nectar, or salt & I used kiwi fruit instead of strawberries.
Thanks.

I made this exactly as written, it came out great. I made it a second time and added 2 teaspoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and a little honey to the mix, also great.  Seems to keep me full between meals too:) thank you for the recipe!

This is a great base recipe as is and easy to customize or embellish.  Ok, I was being greedy and decadent.  I wanted it to be super rich so I opted for cream of coconut as my liquid.  I didn't realize that the coconut oil would solidify in the fridge! Duh!  For my second batch I strained the cream and was much more successful.  I also made a double batch with two cups of coconut cream and two of almond coconut milk.  I didn't use the salt or agave but pumped up the cinnamon.  I then added fresh berries to my serving and love it.  I think I'm going to top my next serving with natural unsweetened dehydrated coconut.  Scrumptious!  Photo soon.

Delicious! The friends I served it to asked for the recipe and made it themselves soon afterward.
