My family really liked this stew. I wouldn't normally have bought chayote but I recieved some as part of a food co-op and had no idea what to do with them! When I saw this recipe I knew it would go over well...and it did!

(MY FIRST CHAYOTE RECIPE ATTEMPT )Very good!  I used sausage links, cooked, then sliced.  Had no beans or corn, but I did use lentils.  Very good, I served with rice. Will make again next time chayotes are on sale :)

This was delicious! With just 2 of us, there was quite a bit for leftovers but this was even better when it was heated up for the 2nd and 3rd time. Very flavorful. I followed the recipe except added an extra jalapeno as we like our food spicy.

Too hot!  One two inch jalapeño will do it.  Otherwise, we liked it.  But, next time we will serve it over rice.

Great Chayote recipe! Perfect for a chilly autumn night. I substituted chorizo (for italian sausage) and used 1 small can chopped jalapenos instead of fresh. Nice and spicy, great texture. Thanks for posting!

I was happy to see a recipe for chyote, which came in my CSA box. I followed the recipe except for using fresh tomatoes instead of canned (because that's all I had). It came out great.

Instead of Italian sausage I used 1 lb of ground turkey seasoned with Penzy's breakfast sausage seasoning plus fennel seed. I only had two chayote. Used 2 serrano (seeds/ribs and all) instead of jalapeno. Otherwise, kept to the recipe (well, I was heavy handed with the chili powder and thyme). This is fantastic. Be careful not to overcook the chayote, it has such a delightful texture. I really made this highly seasoned, and in doing so the sweet, refreshing "cucumbery" flavor of the chayote was lost. That was my fault, not that of the recipe. Still, the texture works and I'll be happily eating these leftovers and making this again and again.

This was wonderful.  I made some changes - mostly in amounts.  I had an acorn squash, so I cubed that instead.  I used 6 spicy italian suasage, doubled the onion(2), doubled the canned tomato, used a can of goya black bean SOUP in place of the black beans, and used about 3 cups of frozen corn.  I let it stew for about an hour or so before trying it.  What a great recipe!

Very good!  Used mild peppers instead of jalapenos for the kids.  Would be better with the heat from jalapenos.

I and my family really enjoyed this recipe. I adapted it for our plant-based diet using Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo, omitting the the olive oil (water sauteed the onion and garlic), seasoning with oregano instead of thyme and stirring in fresh baby spinach. This was our first intro. to chayote and we will enjoy it again and again!

Great recipe because you can change it up so many ways. I had fresh chayote, onion, garlic, Anaheim chili pepper, tomatoes and thyme. I substituted pork chorizo and omitted the chili powder. It tastes great and costs little to make.

Was looking for a chayote recipe when I found this. What a fabulous dish!!!  Highly recommended!  Would increase the sweet Italian sausage (I used 2 pkgs & cut each link into 4 pieces), and maybe add one more chayote.  Didn't have jalapenos and don't really like it too hot or spicy so substituted 6-8 individual red pepper flakes instead and was absolutely delighted at the taste and how the "heat" came up pleasantly as an afterthought!  Great use of chayotes!! The tomatoe-chayote-corn mix with the thyme was unique - really good!  I was also more liberal with the thyme (covered the top of the mixture, then stirred in). WOW - Yummy good!!  Will make again real soon.  And it tastes even better as leftovers!  Letting it sit in the fridge just kept the flavors blending!  Bon Apatite!

Turned out pretty good. I made it with whatever I had on hand which was butter beans and veggie sausage.

never heard of Chayotes but they ended up quite enjoyable, I used a stick of Chorizo instead of sausage, peas instead of beans and only one small Jalapeño, we don't usually go for stews but it was even great reheated next night, its a keeper!

loved the recipe.  I also added some baby bok choy and since I did not have jalapeno peppers I just sprinkled in some cayenne pepper to taste. It was absolutely delicious!!

This was very good. Because of my kids I only used Taco Seasoning and no extra chili. I also left out the jalapeno but  I used lean ground beef and used tomatoes with lime (Rotel).
It was even better reheated for lunch next day.
Thanks for this great recipe.

I made this tonight and we really liked it!  I only used one jalapeno and added a little bit of chicken broth along with the tomatoes, beans and corn.  Instead of serving it with rice, I spooned it over some Yukon Gold fingerling potatoes.  I will make it again, next time I have a chayote on hand.

This is a great recipe for using the Chayote squash, which I had never tried before.  The stew was great tasting.
