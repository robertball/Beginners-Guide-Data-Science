I made this for dinner tonight with a few adjustments. I used 5 cups of hashbrowns and baked them for crispiness before adding the rest of the ingredients. I added the corn into the soup mixture, I used 2 cans of soup and 2 cups of milk. I used shredded Colby/jack cheese. This was good. Next time I think I will use more potatoes, and more cheese. My pickey children even liked it.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I used cream of mushroom soup and green beans instead of corn, my family LOVED it.  I also used velveeta cheese.  I've already passed this recipe along to several of my friends.

Use regular chopped onions in the hash browns, added garlic salt and black pepper, use grated sharp cheddar cheese, top with some French-Fried onions and only cook until bubbly, about 35 minutes.

I think cooking it for 50 -55 minutes total was too much. This was pastey from over-cooking and did not have a lot of flavor except the fried onion taste. Also, why not just add the corn in the beginning? Corn doesn't break down easily, so what difference could it make adding it in the beginning with the potatoes. ??My 12 year old liked it. When I want something to please the kids, I might try again and not cook 'til mushy.
  8-30-03= tried again; this time, not even my 12 year old would eat it. Still think it is too pastey, too strong dried-onion flavor and chicken is too plain. The corn was a nice texture, though. Sorry...  :(   Try; cooked 4-5 breasts cooked shredded chicken, 8 oz. sour cream, 2 cans cr. soup,  1 sm. box crushed Townhouse crackers mixed with 1/2 stick of melted butter, mixed up, topped with more crushed crackers and baked just til hot; We like that, and it is similar.

Made this recipe as is and thought it was good...things I would change to make it *great* I would try browning the hashbrowns first, or take other reviewers suggestions and try out the tator tots. Our family wished there were more onions...they were the flavor of the dish. Brown the chicken first--would probably save a lot of time and add to the flavor of the dish.

This was good, my family liked it, but I changed it completely. I used tater tots, cheddar cheese and broccoli. It was very adaptable and easy to make.

Everyone in my family gave this a 4.5.  It tastes alot like a chicken pot pie.  I doubled it(I double everything-check my reviews if you are a doubler).  I didn't double the corn or the fried onions though. I used one cream of celery and one cr. of chicken.  I also used a white sharp cheese (that's what was in the house)I think this and the celery soup really enhanced the flavor because mine wasn't bland at all.  I also threw in a little left over chicken that I had in the refrigerator.  It came out very good.  Next time I would probably increase the potatoes, a little and of course some extra fluid. And add some peas

This was quite good...We cut back on the onions a little bit, used shredded cheese instead of slices and didn't add the corn. I think a 2nd can of soup would've been better. I think this recipe would work very well with ham.

Quick and delicious. I don't like fried onions so I left these out and I used squash instead of corn. Loved the way the hash browns tasted with it and didn't think them mushy at all - or maybe I just like them that way :) Will  make this easy recipe again.

My husband and I enjoyed the dish very much. I did some changes to it though. I used 5 cups of hashbrowns which I seasoned up with some salt and pepper, garlic powder, and a little italian seasoning. I used shredded colby jack cheese and I also cooked the chicken first and seasoned it with poultry seasoning. I mixed cream of chicken with cream of mushroom, and mixed in a can of cream corn. I cooked for 35 min, and at the end I sprinkled more cheese on top. I didn't have any of the frech fried onions, but I am sure it would have taseted yummy with them. Def a keeper!!

I loved this! I used russet potatoes, shredded in place of the frozen hash browns and slices off of mild cheddar block because I didn't realize I was out of American cheese. I also seasoned chicken with garlic, onion, and pepper. Had a duh moment and completely forgot the layer of corn, instead adding shredded cheese with the remaining French-fried onions on top. Yum!!! Thank you!

This was extremely easy ,very filling and i really enjoyed it. Even my son who is a really picky eater had two bowls of it, but too funny he had to look at the recipe to see if i was telling him the truth that there wasnt anything he didnt like in it. For my taste I added a little salt and pepper to the raw chicken and I put a little more onion rings on it and topped it with a little sharp cheddar cheese, this is a keeper!!

Really good recipe; fast, hearty, and tasted great. Only change I made was to use shredded cheddar cheese instead of American cheese. Turned out very tasty. Another change was a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken soup; I even omitted the chicken in one batch for us vegetarians and this was a yummy variation as well. Either way, I loved this recipe and will be making it for my family again.

My family loved this recipe - all the kids gobbled it down.  Next time I'll brown the hash browns first since some in our family are sensitive to "squooshy" things.  Then it will be perfect for us.  They practically licked the plates.

This was delicious and easy.  I substituted the corn for mushrooms, the cheese for shredded cheddar and the soup for cream of mushroom soup.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was an easy recipe for four 17yr old boys. I used what I had on hand which was pepper and onion hashbrowns, shredded monterey and colby cheese, cream style corn (great way to get rid of when you buy by mistake) and cream of mushroom soup. Works well together. Will make again.

Made this and followed some of the reviewers suggestions and seasoned it with some salt and pepper. This was a keeper simply for the fact that my husband and son liked it, and they are pretty picky eaters. It's not a "wow" kinda dish, more of a quick, easy meal night dish. May try a few variations next time like adding broccoli and such.

Yummy!!! This is comfort food for sure. I did make some changes.. 1) I added 4 cups of hash browns rather than 3; 2) I mixed cream of celery soup with the cream of chicken & added salt, pepper, & garlic salt to the soups befor mixing them into the casserole; 3) I used a lemon pepper rotisserie chicken that I shredded up.  I did not layer the ingredients in the casserole dish I mixed everything together then 7-10 min. befor it was done I topped it with the leftover fried onions. My kids loved this & I will be making it again soon!

Not bad. We personally think the french fried onions in this were too strong so if I make this again, I'd use less. It could also use some color from some red or green bell peppers. Certainly tasted like country cookin'!

I think this was really good - and so easy.  I used left over corn from the night before and only used about a cup.  This casserole was great!

This casserole is delicious!  It's creamy from the soup that baked into the hash browns and it's rich from the French-fried onions. I sautéed the chicken separately just to shorten the baking time and I also added frozen peas & carrots just to 'up' the vegetable content. I will try shredded cheese next time.

I got RAVE reviews on this.  I did not mix up the layers.  And I used green beans instead of corn.  And I used shredded cheeses instead of processed cheese.

So comfort and delicious! Used frozen hashbrowns, can of cream of celery(all I had handy)and added 1/2 cup sour cream when I added corn to mix...other than that, followed directions to a tee, and it was wonderful!!!  Oh yeah...did take the chicken out for 5 minutes at the end and broiled the rest to brown potatoes a bit...my husband loves the crispy stuff! Super comfort food!!!  No need to cook hashbrowns first if you follow the directions...even if they are frozen.

This recipe was very delicious and easy to make. I added 5 cups of potatoes instead of 3 I put green beans in it instead of corn.  I also added a layer of cheese over the green beans and then added french fried onion rings. My family loved it!!! (all of them)

Chicken baked recipes almost always taste dry.  This one is the best I've tried yet.  I was hesitant using the corn but did and was surprised how good it was.  I french fried onions was the key.

I've made this a few times now, and it turns out great every time.  This is my new go-to dish when I have leftover rotisserie chicken. I like to pre-cook my hash browns, use whatever shredded cheese is in the fridge and frozen corn instead of canned.  It's really easy to change the flavors by adding garlic or even curry powder.  I did find that a full can of French-Fried onions was too much, a half can is sufficient.

Very Good!!!! Except the serving size is only three people!! So double the recipe. Also I left out the corn, and fried onions. It was FABULOUS!! You got to make! I served it with corn instead of putting it in the casserole.

This was really yummy!  I used hashbrowns in half of it and tator tots for the other half because I didn't have enough.  The hashbrowns really stuck to the bottom of the pan though, so maybe I needed to grease it a little bit more.  Very tasty though. Especially good with some ranch dressing on top.

Made this last night....yummy!  It was very quick and easy.  I used frozen shredded hash browns.  I also added pepper and onion powder to the soup mix for a little extra flavor.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe needs a little tweaking. I believe doubling the cream of chicken soup and omitting the corn would be helpful. Too much of an onion flavor

With the chicken, it was awesome! However, next time, I would use tator tots, or some sort of potatoe that was more solid. Or, I would maybe cook the hasbrowns first because when I followed this recipe, the potatoes kind of came out mushy. We are a "crispy" kind of family and the thickening of the potato consistency would've helped! Thanks for the idea though! I can deiniftely add some different varieties/changes to it!

My husband declared this one a keeper, too.  Next time, I would make a few changes:  definitely add more hash browns (at least 4 cups) and increase the milk to 1 cup.  I added a generous amount of pepper and some garlic salt, and I added the corn in with the soup/milk mixture and decreased the total cook time to 45 minutes.  It was very yummy and filling!

Good...my kids loved it. Easy enough that my 11 yr. old made this by herself. Only used half the amount of corn called for & we all thought that was plenty. Used 4 cups hash browns though.

Excellent.  I did not add the corn and added a tablespoon of sour cream to the cream of mushroom soup mixture.  I also added salt and pepper to the potatoes and chicken spices to the chicken.

My husband loved this and said it was a keeper.  I did add two stalks celery and half of a green pepper because I wanted to use them up before they went bad...I cooked them both a bit in some butter jusst to soften them.  they added such great flavor to this dish.  Do not skip on using the fried onions as they really add some flavor and crunch.  I also used chicken I had broiled a couple of days ago and not uncooked chicken.  Will make my version again and again.

I tried this recipe tonight and I must say that I enjoyed it very much. Since I was just cooking for myself I scaled the servings size down to 4.   I did not have the onions as called for but the hasbrowns I used had onion and peppers already in them.  The only other alteration was that I used peas instead of corn since that is what I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again.

This was pretty adaptable to accomodate ingredients on hand. No hash browns so we used Tater Crowns, no Cream of Chicken so we used Cream of Mushroom and it was declared a keeper and probably better with the original recipe. 4 Adults and 5 picky kids (1 non meat eater no less). We are going to make it again as originally written and then we want to try it again with ground beef and few other modifications.  Thank you for sharing.

i used Cheddar slices and cooked the chicken and used tater tots ( baked ahead of time for crispness ), mine seemed a little dry and not much flavor. my hubby said it was good, so maybe it was just me....?Maybe i should try with a can of cream of celery soup and cream of chicken ?

This is so good!  I followed the recipe except for the cooking time. I cooked the 1st part 35 minutes, took it out mixed the corn in and topped with the onions and cooked an additional 10 minutes. Everyone loved this!  I served it with broccoli & cheese and sweet baby carrots and parker house rolls! Delicious!!!!

This was very good.  I was short on time so I cooked the chicken about half way through before adding to the dish and I also added Mrs.'s Dash Garlic Herb seasoning to the chicken while it cooked.  Other than that followed the directions and it turned out great.  I only cooked for 45 minutes total (due to time restraints) so maybe this eliminated the mushy hashbrown problem because mine were not.  Will definitely make it again.  Great comfort food.

This was a pretty good.  Next time I make it I will make some changes, such as use different cheese (probably cheddar), use mixed veggies.  I tried cooking the hash browns in a frying pan before putting them in the dish, but I don't think it really mattered much, once the dish was done they came out more like mashed potatoes than hash browns.

Was a good combination.  Made some changes.  Used alot more than the 3 cups of hash browns.  Browned them first to make crispy.  Used two cans of cream of mushroom with half & half.  Used combination of colby/mozzarella cheese and added a can of diced green chiles.  Will use green beans next time as the "yellow" corn made the dish look blah.  I think I will brown the hash browns with red bellpepper next time.  Overall good comfort food and simple to throw together.

This is a guilty pleasures in our house.  I cut the onions in half, used a Jack/Colby shredded cheese blend rather than processed cheese, and also substitued frozen corn for the canned.  EXCELLENT!

Great recipie and very easy. It has a few to many onions for my taste, but I will make again (with fewer onions). - Tried again, but cut entire recipe in half and used shredded colby-jack cheese instead of slices, no corn, and loved it!

I mixed corn with soup & milk & spread over the chicken.  I poured a little more milk over all of it.

My husband and I were looking for something new to make, having never made a casserole before we decided to try this one. We made an excellent choice!! Easy to make, tasted great, not a lot of prep, it was perfect!

I use the small can of french fried onions and that is about perfect.  I also use 2 or 3 chicken breasts instead of 4.  I also use 4 cups of the hashbrowns.  This has been a family favorite for over a year.

YUM!  I was afraid of the FF onions, but they make the dish.  Next time, I might try browning the hashbrowns first...I like them crunchy.  Definitely a keeper!

Very delicious and filling!  I was hesitant about the fried onions at first, but they make the casserole!  My husband and son, who do not like onions, gobbled it up, and I have made it several times.

Delicious and easy, what a perfect combo! To make it taste cheesier (as shown, it doesn't taste cheesy at all) I will use Cream of Cheddar Cheese soup next time. And there will definitely be a next time :)

Great recipe.  Used cream of mushroom soup and, when re-heating, a small can of mushroom pieces.  A bit thick, maybe I'll put in just a little of the canned corn juice next time.  Definitely will make again.

Definantly a tasty dish.  I almost didn't add the corn but my husband insisted.  It suprised me how well it worked in the dish.  I didn't use the onions.  Instead, I used a thin layer of shredded cheddar cheese.  Yummy!

I made this exactly as written.  It was gummy and bland, and I don't know what I'm going to do with the leftovers.  I should have read more reviews before I made this; seems as though everyone else kicked it up a few notches.

My whole family loved this dish. I did add some garlic salt and black pepper. Didn't realize until I went to make it that I was out of corn! Also, I didn't have a large can of french fried onions, only 1 of the small cans and I think this was the perfect amount. I did not add any of the onions to the hash browns, simply put them on top for the last 10 minutes of baking time. I cooked for 35 minutes, added onions and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. For those of you who complain about the hash browns being soggy... this is a casserole type dish, they are meant to be slightly soggy. If the original author wanted it to have crispy hash browns, he would have told you to cook them seperately and then use the chicken mixture as a topping. We loved it, will definately make it again and try to remember the corn next time! = )

I fixed this today. Thought it was good. The only thing I did different was use the hash browns with cheese already in it. I think I will add more of the hash browns next time and add a little salt or some kind of seasoning. It is a little bland. But I don't like alot of seasonings anyway. Overall it was good and I will fix it again.

I was drawn to this casserole because it had meat, potatoes and vegetables all in one.  Add a salad and you have a satisfying meal.  Surprisingly though, it was very bland.  I will make it again but definitely will try to spice up the hashbrowns with lots of salt and pepper and sauteed onions. I will also add the corn right in with the hashbrowns to save a step.  Cooking for 40 minutes is plenty.  I am also going to shred the chicken or cut it up into very small pieces.

I pretty much doubled everything except the chicken and the fried onions.  I used one can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom, about 1 1/2 c Milk, and used velveeta cheese.  I browned up the chicken with salt and pepper first.  This was excellent!  My family really enjoyed it!  I will definately make this again!

This is so good. We are in the middle of a snow storm and this was the perfect meal to come in from the cold to. I used a bag of the Ore-Ida crispy crowns instead of hashbrowns and omitted the onions because my husband doesn't like onions (bummer).I precooked half the bag of crispy crowns, added the chicken and the rest of the ingredients and baked for 35 minutes then added the corn and topped it with the rest of the crispy crowns and baked until they were golden brown. Awesome stuff !!!

I really liked this recipe, but my husband wasn't too crazy about it.  I do agree that a 6 oz fried onions is too much.  I cooked my chicken first then added to the rest, mixed it together and topped it with the rest of my fried onions and cheddar cheese.  Will make again w/less fried onion.

This is a nice, solid recipe that kids will like.  Adding broccoli florets, changing the cheese to cheddar, and using tater tots instead of hash browns helps it a little.  The tater tots hold up better than hash browns.  I also like to make my own hashbrowns instead of using frozen ones.  With modifications, I'd give it a 4.  I make something similar with hamburger, and without the french fried onions -- but I think I'll try adding them to my beef dish next time, just for a little kick.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was okay.  I don't think I'll make it again but it was good in that all the ingredients are readily on hand.  Didn't really have any "oomph" that makes a recipe stand out.  It reminds me of comfort food though.

My family and I love this dish!  It was very easy to make without alot of prep time.  The only thing that I changed was using tater tots instead of hash browns and shredded cheese instead of sliced cheese.  I also pre-cooked the chicken lightly before baking which gives the chicken a better flavor(my personal preference).  I highly recommend this recipe.  It is very delicious!!!

I liked the idea of this recipe, just not all of the processed and canned foods.  I substituted all of the processed foods with real food (e.g. made my own mushroom cream sauce) and it was extrememly fresh and non-chemically tasting.

 Maybe if you marinated the chicken before hand.

This was ok. Easy to make and fine for a regular family dinner.  But not fancy or extra-special.  I'm not sure what would make it better.   I left out the corn and I had to use two cans of soup to make enough liquid.

2/17/05 Made this for dinner last night and would make major changes. Way too much onion. Definately "up" the hash browns, 4 cups at least. I also would add more chicken and cheese inside and on top. Don't know if I will try again. This wasn't a big hit.

This is a great recipe for simplicity and taste!  I followed the recipe fairly close - except for a few things.  I didn't really measure the hashbrowns out - just put what I thought was a good layer.  I love dark meat, so I used boneless chicken thighs, which fried in a bit of butter and olive oil beforehand, mixed with the soup and corn and poured on top.  I also put an extra layer of cheese on top underneath the fried onions.  I didn't have to cook mine as long, either - about 45 min. altogether.  Other than those minor alterations, I followed the recipe.  My son declared this a keeper - and he's very picky!

I made this casserole for my husband and father's dinner last week.  Although I didn't try it (vegetarian), I wanted to report back how much both loved it and how filling they said it was.  I did add about 1/4 cup shredded cheddar to the onion ring topping, but other than that made no changes.  And as I said, the guys loved it.  Wanted no changes made and both said to make it again in the future.  My father usually declines leftovers that require borrowing tupperware, but he took this in a heartbeat.  I served it with crescent rolls and salad; my husband also said the casserole would be really good with a hot veggie side.  Excellent recipe- thank you Heather for sharing it with us!

This recipe was wonderful!  My husband has two reviews for all recipes - keeper or non-keeper. As you can tell he's a man of few words.  But for this one, he says, "It's definitely a keeper!"  I agree.

I thought this recipe was very good.  Maybe a little too much chicken.  Next time I think I'll cut it down to 3 chicken breasts instead of 4.  Otherwise, kids & husband enjoyed it!

I used cubed hash browns because I had exactly 3 cups to use up. I only had half the french fried onions because I wanted to keep it healthier so I didn't have any for the top. The second time I made this my 9 yr old did not like it and I just thought it was ok. I didn't have enough fried onions, maybe that would have helped. I did add green peppers and wish I hadn't. Normally I like them in everything but they didn't do well in this.

Great dish.  I did add an additional can of cream of chicken soup since I felt like it would be too dry.  I made another casserole from this site with same size pan and only 1 can with milk and it was so dry, we didn’t eat it all.  This was just right for us.  I also had a question about the corn.  It does not say to drain it, but I did. Maybe the liquid from the corn would have made it more moist, but I would prefer the soup for moisture.

Followed directions exactly with one package of boneless skinless breasts (3 instead of 4) and a can of green beans rather than corn.  The kids LOVED this.  Maybe add some poultry seasoning or something to the chicken next time?

I layered the hashbrowns (added seasoned salt and pepper),  a good handful of the french fried onions, shredded Monterrey jack cheese, chicken (which I cooked with chicken seasoning),  and corn (only used about 2/3 can).  I used cream of mushroom soup, mixed it with the milk and poured it over the entire casserole.  Baked it all for 50 minutes - came out perfectly.  My husband and I liked the variety of textures and the combination of the flavors.

I made this for dinner as written except I used Mushroom soup instead of Chicken soup and used Broccoli instead of Corn.  I used raw fresh hash browns and had to cook this a little longer.  It was really good the first day and EXCELLENT on the second.  It did need salt to taste when served.  I think next time I will try shredded cheddar.  I like things really cheesy.

Easy and it turned out great.  I did cook it a little longer than the recipe called for and I used block cheese instead of slices.

Not even gonna give it 1 star. It was NOT easy, took me most of the afternoon (to be fair I was making another recipe at the same time). Neither my wife nor I would eat it. Will put it out for the possums and skunks!  HAD TO GIVE IT 1 STAR TO SUBMIT THIS.

I made this today. I cooked a whole chicken in the crock pot and used the meat and chicken stock added mixed veggies and cream of chicken soup and hash browns and cheddar cheese and topped with pieces of bread all over the casserole. Then baked it and it is Wonderful! Tastes like chicken pot pie. SOOOOO GOOOOD! It's not mushy at all and has a very good consistently!

This turned out fabulous! My family loved it, Started w/ several left over fried chicken pieces from the deli of our local Publix and used the meat as well as the breading on the chicken. Then I used frozen hashbrowns from Ore-Ida and shredded cheddar-colby cheese. Also I added a tab more milk when mixing the corn in and did not use the entire can. It is super quick and easy and everyone loved it !

Yummy, but it says to use corn but does not give instructions on when to incorporate it into the recipe. I used cheddar instead of Velveeta and used a little less of the french fried onions. All in all, my kids liked it and I will making it again in the near future.

I found this recipe using ingredient search when looking for a potluck recipe. It was great!  Everybody liked it. I already had cooked chicken and I used  cheddar cheese, about half cup of sour cream,  and added a bit of Cajun seasoning for a kick. Baked for 25 min. Then added topping and baked another 15.  It was the only thing that was completely gone at the end of dinner!

Made this Friday night for my daughter and hunny. The two of them had seconds and fought over leftovers the next day. I made excatly as the recipe stated but added a few extra pieces of cheese as they are both cheese freaks. I also used copper sharp american deli cheese instead of cheap cheese slice, just what I had on hand. I felt it took a lot longer than suggested so don't do it if you are rushing. Will make again. Possible changes would be a few more potatos and as always they want more cheese

I really liked this recipe.  I made some changes, however, and it turned out great!  I mixed the chicken, soup, milk, corn, some green onions and fried onions together first.  I then seasoned the mixture with garlic powder, onion salt and pepper.  I fried the hashbrowns so they were a bit crispy and warmed through.  I layered the hashbrowns first, spread sliced velveeta over the top of the hashbrowns, then poured the mixture on top of that.  I baked and topped with more fried onions as directions stated.  It was really yummy.  Will definitely do this one again!

This was definitely a hit at my house. I didn't have any french fried onions on hand so I just omitted that. I also used a little more hash browns as I had one of the carton ones and needed to use it all. Next time I will add one more can of soup.

I thought it was a very easy and quick recipe to make. My daughter didnt like the hashbrowns seemed to turn into mush so make cook the chicken ahead of time next time and bake the hashbrowns less.

This was just wonderful!  Comfort food at its finest!  My 12 year old sister asks me to make this all the time!  It's been a while since I've made this, but I'll be making it tonight!    I use 2 cans of soup, btw, and colby-jack cheese instead of american.

This was ok.  It was easy and tasted fine, if a little bland, with the exception of the overwhelming onions.  Will try again with added spices and less onions.

This is true comfort food. I used chicken thighs. Cooked them on the stove top in some evoo with salt and pepper. I also fried up the hash browns and added cayenne and garlic salt. Used two cans of cream of chicken, used half n half(about 1 1/2 cups) and left out the corn.

The hashbrowns are a nice twist to this chicken/mushroom soup casserole.  It didn't "wow" me, but it was nice comfort food and I would make it again.

This is a great recipe..I just used potatoes o brian instead of plain hashbrowns and seasoned with cajun seasonings, garlic, and pepper. I prebaked the potatoes for about 10 mins. on 400 then added the other ingredients I also put the corn in with everything and cooked for 35 min on 350. Family loved it

I changed it up a bit...I did not add the corn.  I added another can of cream of chicken soup.  I also added more hash browns...about 5 cups.  It was good, but my family did not go crazy about it...however, this recipe is perfect for a quick and easy meal.

My family loved this recipe!  My son and husband are picky eaters so I am very happy to have a comfort meal we all loved. I precooked 3 chicken breasts in chicken broth, then cut up and added to the mixture of 4 cups potatoes, soup (I used cream of chicken AND cream of mushroom) 1 1/5 soup cans of milk, lots of shredded Mexican cheese and 16 oz. frozen corn.  I did not add any onions to the mix. I mixed all this up, then baked 55 minutes, added 2-3 oz. French fried onions and baked another 5 minutes. There's no way we would have eaten it with 6 oz. of onions. Served with dinner rolls and a salad, this was perfect. 17 year old son said it was one of his favorite recipes that we've tried! Definitely a keeper for us.

Easy to prepare but just o.k. in the flavor dept.  It seemed to have an overly processed flavor to it, and that was with using real Cheddar cheese instead of the American cheese.  Overall, it seemed to be lacking something.

It needed more potatoes and colby jack instead of american.  I also added about 1/4 cup of mild salsa and some peas while baking.  Without the salsa, it would have been much too bland for me.  The recipe is a good base, but it needed too much alteration.

I made a few personal touches to this recipe by using 50%-50% American/Cheddar, and instead of just corn I added a vegetable mix. I was uncertain if my husband would like it, and well a few bites into eating he started humming--his way of saying he thought it was good!

We loved this dish!  Made a few minor changes: we got CHEESY hashbrowns and cooked them before they went into the casserole.  We also used Colby Jack cheese instead of American-- MUCH better.  I served it with green beans and biscuits.  Good southern comfort food :)

It was OK.  The hash browns ended up soggy.  The flavor wasn't there.  All I could taste was the french fried onions.

Very tasty! Next time I would brown the hash browns first, for a better texture.  I would also mix the corn in the soup mixture, then just bake straight through for 45 min. Can't wait to have again!

Pretty good dish.  I'd go lighter with the onions next time.  I did also add some cheddar cheese to the top.

Good, quick home-style meal.  I used peas instead of corn because that's all I had, I think next time I'll add broccoli and other veggies to give it more substance.
Thanks!

We thought this was pretty good.  My kids did not like the French fried onions even with me using less than the recipe called for.  Next time I make this dish, I will do half with onions and half without.  Personally, my husband and I really like the French fried onions!  I took other reviewers advice and baked this for less than what the recipe called for and it was not mushy at all.

This was really tasty - like something you would get at Cracker Barrel. Not company fare, but good home cookin'. I cut down slightly (by about 1/3 cup) on the french fried onions. Family enjoyed it - there were no leftovers.

I'm giving this four stars only because my mom really enjoyed it.  It was a tad bit too bland for my taste, but I'll make it again for mom.  Thanks Heather.

Awesome dish! I decreased the fat content using lowfat shredded cheddar and fat free cream of chicken soup, along with 2% milk.  The kids & my husband love it! Definitely a keeper.

My family really liked this recipe! I mixed 1/4 of the ff onions with about 5 cups of hash browns and baked them at 375 for 15 minutes. Then, I placed the cheese slices on top, cut up about 3/4# chicken breast, and sprinkled 2 cups of thawed mixed veggies on top. I baked this for 30 minutes and stirred in another 1/4 of the onions. I put the remaining onions on top and baked for 10 more minutes. My 5 year old even said ,"mom... You're a really good cook-lol!"

This recipe was great, easy and very tasty. I cooked the chicken half way first and used the velvetta cheese which worked out great.  This is one recipe I have already recommended.  Thanks!

Very tasty dish....even my husband liked it and he's not much on chicken or casseroles.  I added only 1/2 of the corn and it was great..I thought i would have leftovers, but nothing was left.  Must try!   Thanks

I used this recipe for my cooking class of seven to nine year olds. They had an easy time making it.  Their families liked it.  My brother in law said that he liked it and he doesn't usually like things like this at all. A couple of my mothers said that this recipe was a keeper.

This recipe is definately a "keeper", which doesn't happen often in my house.  I used 3 slices of velveeta cheese broken into pieces and left out the corn.  I also only used 2 boneless chicken breasts and cut into very small pieces, and this covered the whole casserole.  Even my picky 13 year old had seconds and didn't "pick" anything out!  Will make this often.
