This was a really easy and delicious shortcake.  Nothing trick but quick. just don't overbake the buiscuit dough. I baked the biscuits in muffin tins and they came out perfectly round. I baked for exactly 11 min, and the insides were just slightly soft, perfect & moist.  The top did crumble a bit when I sliced them warm, but once the berries & cream were added, you couldn't tell the difference, although I did try these without slicing, still very good.  To enhance the flavouring of the strawberries, add as much as 1/4 cup of lemon juice with 1/2 cup of sugar (or splenda) to the strawberries, mix well and allow to sit for as long as possible (10 min or up to a couple of hours). Really good...

These came out EXCELLENT and were so quick.  I doubled the batch, used heavy whipping cream instead of milk, and added 1 tsp almond extract which made them awesome.  9 minutes in my oven made them golden.  I will make these all the time now.

I wanted more of a cake consistency as opposed to biscuits, so I added 2 eggs and an additional tbsp of sugar.  I used a hand-held mixer to get the batter nice and smooth, and poured into a jumbo sized muffin tin.  I baked them at 325 for about 25 minutes.  This yielded 6 perfect shortcakes that were easily sliced in half to layer fresh whipped cream and strawberries.  I chilled the fresh strawberries mixed with sugar for 30 minutes before serving….makes wonderful strawberry syrup.  I used the “whipped cream” recipe on this site and sub’ed granular sugar for confectioner’s sugar.  I think these were the best strawberry shortcakes ever and my fiancé agreed!

Easy and delicious.  I added a little bit of vanilla extract to the batter, which was nice.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and  made it more cake-like by adding 2 eggs and some vanilla and mixing with a mixed. I cooked it in an 8x8 pan at 375 for about 25 minutes. Delicious!

Excellent! Made these for guests last night. I neeeded a quick, easy to fix, seasonally appropriate dessert to serve with our summer meal. This met my expectations exactly! :) As with any recipe, I have a few suggestions for improvement. The next time I make these (there WILL be a next time!), I will substitute heavy whipping cream for milk (for richness) and add a bit of vanilla (to enhance the overall flavor) as others have suggested. I baked my shortcakes for 11 minutes, but feel they would have been fine at the 9 minute mark. After sititng for 10 minutes, these split beautifully (i.e. no crumbles!). NOTE: My grocery store only had 2 lb. containers of strawberries. This recipe instructs to add 1/2 c. sugar to a quart of strawberries. There are approximately 1.5 lbs. of strawberries in a quart (this conversion ONLY applies to strawberries; with any other ingredient, you cannot convert from pounds to quarts). I added 3/4 c. sugar to mine with great results. Filled with the delicious strawberry mixture and Cool-whip, this was really a great treat - and my guests couldn't have agreed more. Thanks!

For what it is, this recipe is five stars. If you only have a couple of minutes to prep, then make this. I added a little bit of vanilla as someone else suggested. don't overbake or they won't be very good. enjoy!

These were very simple and easy to make.  They taste great!  However, be aware that they are too fragile to be split and filled...this didn't bother us of course.  A family favorite now!

I made this exactly as written, and I  can honestly say that I will never buy shortcakes from the store again. This tasted so much better than the ready made shortcakes and the effort to make these was minimal.

i added 3/4 tsp. cream of tartar and a little bit of lemon juice and it was SO YUMMY!  i think we could have eaten the shortcakes alone!  splitting them was not a problem--we just crumbled them up in a bowl, added sugared fresh strawberries, and topped it with whipped cream.

Very good, but very delicate and didn't rise much so I wasn't able to split these. They certainly would have crumbled had I tried. I used homemade bisquick/biscuit mix and half and half instead of milk. I used a strawberry syrup that I made earlier and drizzled some hot fudge topping that I found in the fridge. These were good.

Have made these for years. Sounds different but will sometimes add 1/2 - 3/4 tsp. cinnamon . Works great and our non- strawberry eaters love it with peaches.

I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.  They were great for what they are, and it couldn't have been easier.  I used heart healthy Bisquick, and it still turned out fine!

These were great but a little on the savory side for me. With the following adjustments it turned it into 5 Star: add one more Tbsp of sugar, add 1 tsp vanilla, add 1 egg. Delicious!

I made this for my husband's birthday, his favorite is Strawberry Shortcake.  He said this was THE best Strawberry Shortcake he has ever had!  I felt so happy, I was nervous since I didn't get a chance to test it before hand!

The only change I made was using Cool Whip, didn't have time to make the whipped cream.   I also used a bit of strawberry glaze on the strawberries for color and a bit more sweetness.  But these are minor changes, it was great!!

this is the recipe on the back if the Bisquick box, and is honestly not very good. It tastes like cardboard, and is not worth the time it saves to use the baking mix. next time we will go back to a typical homemade recipe for shortcake without the Bisquick.

Simple, delicious, esay to make, pretty to look at- what more could you ask for?  We had these yesterday, and they were so good. I had guests over, and I only had to spend 5 minutes preparing the shortcakes to go in the oven.  And five minutes more to assemble them after baking.  I will definitely do these again.  BTW, I didn't split the shortcakes because I didn't want to risk them falling apart.  I just put shortcake, then cool whip, then arranged sliced strawberries on top-perfect!

I made it again 4 July, 2019. This time I added nearly 1/4 cup of sugar to the Bisquick mixture. This made it slightly sweet and yummy. I added a little sugar to the heavy cream. My husband was thrilled. Turned out very well.

I made the changes another reviewer suggested  1/2 and 1/2 and vanilla.  It turned out great !   Maybe a little crumbly but that did not hamper the enjoyment !    I would definitely make this again !!

Won’t make it again.   It does not compare to my scone recipe.  Scones make excellent shortcakes.

LOVE this recipe! Sad it is no longer on the box so i have to look for it..
w that said for our tastes this isn't buttery nor sugary enough. sooooo I sprinkle sugar on the dough begore cooking. then after I brush a "healthy" (well maybe not "HEALTHY") coating of melted butter on ea biscuit then sprinkle more sugar on top of that. OHHH so yummy!!

Have made these for 60 years, but always used evaporated milk because my Mom did. We smash our strawberries a bit for more delicious juice, then crumble the shortbread to soak it all up! Mmmm! Think I need to go pick some berries right now!

AMAZING. Will be making this many more times. I halved the sugar in the strawberries, but made no other changes. Incredibly delicious and deceivingly easy!

I usually use angel food cake for my strawberry shortcake, but thought about how my Mom used to make them from scratch.  Felt like a piece of home.  Excellent!

My first review!  I also used the jumbo muffin tin.  The result was delicious!!  Next time, my best friend suggests I use vanilla extract instead.  All six of us loved the dessert.  Thank you.

Perfect strawberry shortcakes!  I believe this is the Bisquik recipe I grew up with.  I added a little vanilla but otherwise followed the recipe.

Awesome!!!!  Let the strawberries sit in the sugar for at least a couple hours so they can soften a tad, and slice more ham you think youll need because they shrink when soaking

I made this for Father's Day and it was a hit! I followed the recipe exactly. I tried to slice one when warm and it crumbled. They sliced better when I let them cool.

The only thing I did different was to use the heavy cream in place of the milk. Both my hubby & I loved it!  Will definitely be making again....love strawberries, blackberries & blueberries!!

Muffins browned nicely, but I think a bit dry ... though the strawberries (w/o added sugar) and added blueberries plus whipped cream was great! A hit with friends!
