I thought this recipe was wonderful! The turkey had a nice lemonade taste to it, which was very different. I have never had fruit kabobs before, and they were delicious. They were sweet with a nice grilled taste to them. I used mango and cantelope. I will definitely make this recipe again, it's a great summer treat.
