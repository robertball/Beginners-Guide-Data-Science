This recipe is very good, as long as you add the 1 garlic clove to a cup of mayonnaise (not a tablespoon) and be sure it is very finely chopped. The mayo makes this sandwich!! It tastes like it came from a deli. YUM!

I'd highly recommend baking or sauteing the garlic before mixing it into the mayo. Raw garlic is very harsh.

This is very good.  I used a small white eggplant that I bought at the farmer's market yesterday.  I got three sandwiches on hot dog rolls out of it.  I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the garlic is a bit harsh--next time I'd just cook them a bit with the eggplant to address that.  I don't eat mayo so I used hummus instead and mixed the garlic in with the hummus.  It was yummy for me that way!  Bf doesn't like eggplant so I made all three for me.  :o)  Delicious, and now I have an excellent sandwich for my packed lunch tomorrow!  thank you for the recipe!

Really good! This was my first eggplant sandwich aka burger. I crushed the garlic and added red pepper flakes to the mayo. Topped the eggplant with a slice of cheddar cheese & tomato on a hamburger bun as that's what I had available. The garlic was really strong (as states by other members) but I loved the taste it gave to sandwich.
