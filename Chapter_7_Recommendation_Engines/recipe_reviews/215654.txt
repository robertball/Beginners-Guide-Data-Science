This is a great recipe.  I increase the peppermint extract to 1/2 tsp.  For the crushed candies, I've found that it works best to separate the "dust" fom the chunks.  I stir the dust into the fudge (after it's done cooking), then place the larger pieces on top.  This makes it pretty.  1/4 cup is about 10 round candies.  Once the mixture starts to boil, I turn the heat down to low-medium and only boil for about 3 minutes.

my family has a similar recipe for fudge, and the addition of peppermint bits is a nice one (we also like to add a bit almond liqueur and some chopped pecans).  a word to the wise about making fudge:  candy is a science (chemistry, actually) and it's also one of those things that you only 'get' after a lot of trial and error.  this recipe allows for the use of margarine, i would caution against it.  not only is margarine hydrogenated (i.e. bad for you) but it lacks the fats that butter has which will give your fudge that smooth and creamy texture.  also, knowing when you've reached a 'full rolling boil' is hard to define, but if you *don't* your fudge will not set properly (and if you let it go too long after, your fudge will be hard as a rock.)  just a heads up for future fudge makers, don't  be afraid to keep trying - after all, the best part is eating your mistakes!! :)

While the fudge was easy to make, I found it dry and heavy. The texture was just not very pleasant. I'd also leave out the peppermint extract - I found the flavor overwhelming.

I am not sure what has gone wrong.  After 24 hours my fudge is still not solid.  I followed the recipe, but realized I picked up skim evaporated milk.  Would this cause it to be soupy and not solid?  It is almost like mousse...flavor is great though.

I must have done something wrong... This recipe has great reviews, but it's just not working for me.  When I went to put it in the pan to cool, I had to spoon it out and then spread it with a spatula.  Once it was cooled, I cut it, and it was very hard.  The taste is good.  The texture, not so much.  It looks so soft and... fudgy in the pictures.  What did I do?

Easy to make, and delicious.  Note that you really do need to add the peppermint candies on top to get more of a pepperminty flavor.  I recommend adding more extract if you'd like the fudge to have more of a peppermint flavor from within.  I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 4 because I already have an excellent fudge recipe!

a little too chocolatey for me, I added vanilla jello mix and 1/2 cup more marshmellows and swirled it in to the fudge until it had a marbled look... it tasted great.

Dianne's review was incredibly helpful. I took her suggestions and my fudge was absolutely perfect. I did make one small change--I added a good amount (I did not measure) of chopped candy cane Kisses that I pushed on top of the fudge along with the bigger chunks of crushed candy canes. Very good. This fudge literally melts in your mouth.

Love this recipe! Made the same recipe using white chocolate and it came out super yummy! I'd use this recipe for any standard fudge I'll be making in the future!

This came out perfectly by following the cooking directions (full boil for 4-5 minutes).  I used butter (of course!), and split the chocolate chips between dark and semi-sweet.  I also increased the peppermint extract to 1/2 t and the vanilla to 1 t, as well as adding more salt.

This recipes is great. Works if you don't have the candy canes also. Make sure you follow the directions precisely though. My family loved this!

I'm not liking the way the fudge looked when I just mixed it up. I cooked the sugar/milk mixture for 4 minutes and as soon as I added the marshmallows and chocolate chips the chocolate seemed to seize up. I just finished it so I'm not certain what it will be like when it cools but it doesn't look rich and creamy. We'll see.

It seems I'm not the only one who got hard dried out fudge! This was my first time trying to make fudge, friends told me that it probably wouldn't be right the first time. I thought they were wrong lol but that's what I get for thinking they were wrong. So apparently I over cooked the sugar, butter, and evap milk! Trial and error I guess! Sucks I was making this for Christmas Eve dinner with the family tomorrow! Oh well it will be a memory no one ever forgets! :) Taste good tho!
