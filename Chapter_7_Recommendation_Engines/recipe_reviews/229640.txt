Luv it! I added chipotle for some spice... It was mouth watering.

I wasn't sure about this recipe because I am not a big greek yogurt fan, but I had a ton of arugula from the garden to use up so I went for it.  Brought it to a friend's house and everyone liked it - four of us ate almost the entire thing.  I added a little more yogurt and cheese than called for and a bit of spinach, but otherwise followed exactly.  Served with pita chips and some fresh veggies.

This was made for our dinner club by a participant. It was delicious, such a clean and fresh taste. We all asked for the recipe! I will make this very soon.

What a good dip with multiple layers of flavor.  I didnâ€™t have any pita bread, so I just made some crostini which worked very well.  Another Oikos winner!

This turned out to be a very bright starter for a heavily grilled meal.  It was perfect with the smoky char-grilled flavors, but didn't really have enough flavor on it own.

I followed the recipe, except for adding some sour cream because I found it to be too thick as is.  Even though I love all of the ingredients separately, I just didn't carer for the flavor of the final product. I guess its just a matter of taste.

I love this dip! It's great as is but also can be easily modified. I have substituted lightly cooked chopped kale, and have used marinated artichokes instead with great results. I also love adding a touch of mayo, and dried onion flakes. It's a keeper.

I love this easy, cold version of artichoke dip. Perfect for a summer barbeque or potluck....... or dish to bring to a bingo night.
