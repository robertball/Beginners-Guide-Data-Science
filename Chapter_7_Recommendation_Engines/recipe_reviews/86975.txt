I did not care for this recipe. Olive oil and bread usually make a good combination, but not here.

Well, after I put the bread into the olive oil to brown it, there wasn't any reserve oil left for the spaghetti. It was a waste of bread and olive oil. I didn't care for the taste of the bread crumbs either. Sorry.

Maybe it's just me, but isn't a store brand shaker of parm cheese about half the cost of olive oil?? I did not care for this recipe.

I would rate this as a five star for really stretching your dollar but other than that it's flavorless. A little crushed red pepper would up it some.

No changes were made. Followed exactly. Would make it again. Great for a quick, easy lunch or dinner serving whatever you like alongside or just alone.
