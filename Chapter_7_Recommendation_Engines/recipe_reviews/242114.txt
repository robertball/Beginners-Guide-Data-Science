I'm a huge quinoa lover and this was a nice change of pace from the usual. I had all the ingredients on hand, so decided to give it a try. I made it exactly as written. I only cooked my quinoa for about 12 mins because that's how I like it. I also rinsed the quinoa beforehand to remove any bitterness .  The red pepper and garlic seasoning I used was salt-free, so I did have to add some salt at the end.  I think next time I will toss in the fresh herbs after the quinoa is cooked, to maximize flavor.

Love this - hot or cold. I toast the quinoa in a dry iron skillet before cooking in lo sodium chicken broth. I like the nuttier taste I get from that. Instead of the red pepper and garlic seasoning, I roast a red pepper and add that. I've made this about a dozen times and it's a much requested dish and recipee.

I didn't have any of the pepper seasoning blend but followed all the other directions. WOW this was delicious! I used it cold in a salad. Will most definitely make this again.

This one was just ok, very middle of the road for me.  I made as written, but did substitute dried spices for fresh (as I didn't have anything available).  Overall, it was a little bland, but totally edible.  I'm wondering if possibly preparing with chicken broth instead of water may fix the issue, but I'm not sure.  There are better recipes out there, there are worse.  I may try this again with chicken broth and fresh herbs, but it's definitely a maybe.
