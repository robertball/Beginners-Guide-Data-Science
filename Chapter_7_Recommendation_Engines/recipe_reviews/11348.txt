I let this chill for 24 hours, cut it and it crumbled. I didn't have time to re-chill this so I added in an egg, stuck in mini muffin cups, I pressed an indentation after baking and then filled with jam. They taste very good...

These did not call for enough liquid. Tried to cut them and they just crumbled. Was going to toss the dough, but worked in some orange juice and re-refrigerated them, sliced and baked and they were not too bad.
