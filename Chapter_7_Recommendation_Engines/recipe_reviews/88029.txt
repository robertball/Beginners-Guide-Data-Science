I'm from Albuquerque so I was tickled to find a recipe using our town's name. It's a good basic recipe but with tweaks came out really great.  I would advise using only half the taco seasoning packet as it can really be salty and spicy.  Another good tip is to use one or two crushed garlic cloves mixed in with the sour cream.  This is actually an old recipe my grandmother used to make, but she called it an Aztec Calendar because supposedly the mix of colors and textures all together resembled pictures of those ancient Aztec calendars.

I used a homemade taco seasoning, homemade refried beans and fresh LIME juice instead of lemon juice. I did not have fresh green chile peppers, I used one 4 oz. can of mild green chile peppers. I also used a reduced fat sour cream. My husband, kids and I inhaled this dip. We loved it. My husband asked me if I could make it again tomorrow.

This was so disapointing.  I usually love mexican dips but this was all wrong.  The full pack of seasoning in the beans was too much really over powering, the guacamole was bland and just plain sour cream on top was a blah finish.  I wouldn't reccomend this dish, we threw it away, there must be a better layered dip on this site.  Sorry Becky I don't mean to be harsh this just wasn't it for me.

This is a great way to use up extra fresh green chiles during harvest.  We also keep a lot on hand in our freezer. 
I recommend spreading the layers on a round pizza dish though instead of a pie plate and using just half the taco seasoning or else the refried beans overwhelm the other ingredients.  I tried squeezing fresh garlic into the sour cream and that was also very tasty.
