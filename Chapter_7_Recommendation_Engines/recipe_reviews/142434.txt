Yum!  I really enjoyed this smoothie.  I pared it down to one serving for breakfast, using 1/2 cup of fresh pureed pumpkin (skipped freezing and used it at room temp), 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 scoop vanilla protein powder, 4 ice cubes, 1 tsp Stevia and 1 cup nonfat milk.  Sweet, healthy, and great for you.  I will make this again!  Thanks!

Yummy! I love anything with pumpkin. I freeze the pumpkin puree in ice cube trays, and then put the frozen pumpkin cubes in freezer bags. Makes it really easy for just 1 or 2 servings. When I want a smoothie I just toss in a few cubes, and add the rest of the ingredients to the taste and consistency I like.

I just made this. Instead of freezing the pumpkin overnight, I just threw some ice cubes in the blender. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, and threw in some vanilla extract. It is a bit thick, but you can always add more milk if that bothers you. I liked it fine as is, my husband asked me to add some sugar to his. I like it either way. He describes it as "pumpkin pie in a glass". This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is a great idea!!  I changed the recipe some, which is not usual for me.  I used a frozen banana and vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  I like the brown sugar idea, but I might try a drizzle of honey instead next time.  I also froze my pumpkin in a freezer bag.  Thank you for a great idea!

I had to change this up a little bit because I don't support any factory farm industries.  I replaced the dairy with Almond milk and it was to die for!!!  I also added a 1/2 tsp. vanilla.

Great idea.  I loved it both with or without banana.  A hint of vanilla also tasted wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!

Made this today to try something different with my kids I thought it was OK, I happily finished my glass knowing the benefits of pumpkin. My 1 year olds first reaction was to try to scrape it off her tongue ( probably because she was expecting our traditional fruit smoothie) she went back for a couple more sips but that was all leaving her cup full. My 2 1/2 year old took one sip, said she liked it but didn't go back. It has a wonderfully thick and creamy texture, but unless you truly like pumpkin in a non pumpkin pie form, you probably won't be so excited about this smoothie.

This is SO good. Even my boys (husband included) who normally turn up their noses at pumpkin anything drank this down happily. Next time, I might try to add a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I really enjoyed this!  I used a few ice cubes instead of frozen pumpkin, and substituted almond milk for regular milk , which cuts back on the calories and sugar and adds protein.  I found it to be a great mid-afternoon pick me up!  Next time I think I'll try vanilla and stevia!

Yum, I had fresh pumpkin puree and couldn't wait for the pumpkin to freeze so I just mixed up a half recipe for me to drink.  Delicious!  I used cinnamon with a little ginger and cloves and a dash of vanilla.  Very filling too so will be good for a healthy afternoon snack to hold me over until dinner.  I'll have to see about freezing some of the puree and trying it that way too.  Thanks for sharing.

After halving the recipe size, I first made this as is and found I had to tweak a bit for my liking. I added a small container of plain greek yogurt, a splash of vanilla extract and some frozen zucchini. It was very filling and the pumpkin flavor came through nicely. I would make this again when I have pumpkin left over.

Very tasty smoothie.  I think I would have enjoyed it even more if it was a crisp fall day, rather than waking up to 7 inches of snow on the ground.  But, I'm trying to clean out the freezer and found a container of frozen pumpkin.  This smoothie held a nice mixture of ingredients.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I will try this again in October.

Tried with 8 oz of pumpkin puree and banana. I accidentally put 2 tsp of cinnamon when it should have been less (b/c of decrease in pumpkin). Turns out good! Thanks for the recipe! I was looking for something to do with leftover puree and this was just perfect. :)

This is yummy! It tastes like pumpkin pie filling. I used canned pumpkin puree and reduced the ingredients to make one serving (1/4 cup pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup milk, 1 T brown sugar and 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice.) The only change I made to the ingredients was pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.

This was pretty good. I used to make something similar. This is probably the only sort of recipe that I'd prefer the pumpkin be from a can, as it tasted a bit squash-y. A whole banana was too much, I think I'll go with 3/4 next time. I added nutmeg because I can't do sweet pumpkin food without it, and a bit of vanilla.

This recipe was yummy and creamy. I made it from memory so I accidentally didn't put in the full amount of cinnamon, next time I probably will. I didn't even freeze the pumpkin, just dumped everything in the blender. I needed 5 servings instead of only 4, but two were drinking from sippy cups so I gave them each only 1/2 a cup (1/2 a serving) then added 1/2 a cup of milk to each sippy cup. Two of my kids liked it tons and two of them not so much, I consider this a mild success! (Especially since it was the pickier two that liked it!) Will make again!

This was a very good smoothie! I was looking for a way to use up my leftover pumpkin puree (I made muffins) and make dinner in the same recipe:) I followed Rachel's suggestion and made it with stevia and protein powder. I also added pecans and pumpkin pie flavoring. Annnnd I may or may not have put a few white chocolate chips on top:)

Loved this idea. Like others, I used room temperature pumpkin puree and threw in a few ice cubes. Also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, and vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk. It really does taste like liquid pumpkin pie.

I did change this a bit...sorry for giving the 5-stars, but I didn't try it as-is, so I can't exactly take any stars off.  I can tell you that it probably would have been delicious the way it is written.  But I made changes for health and taste preferences.  I just took a good size chunk of roasted pumpkin (not frozen) and threw it in the blender with 1 C. of regular almond milk, a scoop of vanilla protein powder, a Tbsp. of milled flax seed, three ice cubes, and about 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  It probably would have tasted more like pumpkin pie with the brown sugar added, but I'm trying watch my sugar intake, and the protein powder gave it enough flavor.  It was very tasty this way, and I would like to try this blended up with the milk and spices and then heated for a cold evening drink!

If you don't like the taste of raw pumpkin, then this is not the recipe for you.  I realized I like pumpkin flavor in desserts (like cheesecake) or muffins but not  in a smoothie.  This tasted like liquid pumpkin.

Easily the most amazing drink I've ever had. Didn't follow the recipe at all with the second batch. You really can't mess it up; more milk, less cinnamon, whatever! It always tastes DELICIOUS!

I am a lover of all things pumpkin - but I did not care for this recipe. It was almost like eating raw pumpkin - straight from the melon. I tried many of the alterations mentioned in the reviews, nothing helped. I eventually added eggs and flour and turned it into pumpkin bars.

I LOVE pumpkin, so this recipe hit the spot for me!  I did not freeze the pumpkin, so I added some ice.  I also subbed sugar-free almond milk for the regular milk and 2 packets of splenda for the brown sugar.  It turned out great!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I haven't tried this but didn't want to lower the rating so I rated it 5 stars.    One can sub Greek yougurt for the milk or some of the milk to up the health benifits and hide the taste of the Greek yogurt. I can't have pumpkin due to the glycemic index however I bet this smoothie is delicious.

I think I'll have to play with it a little, but its really good!! I think I'm going to try adding nutmeg and ginger next time to make it taste a little more like pumpkin pie. Over all, simple and YUMMY!!

Tastes really good. I didn't freeze the pumpkin just refrigerated it. I changed the spices to 1tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1tsp cinnamon. I also added 1 cup Cool Whip. Also added ice cubes

I used fresh pumpkin puree and didn't freeze it over night and the smoothie was still yummy!  I also didn't add ice cubes because I don't care for extremely cold drinks.  Thank you for sharing!

I cut it down to just one serving to fit in my Magic Bullet. I added a bit more brown sugar, as it didn't taste sweet enough the first time. Even after that it still needed something else. This definitely is a recipe that I'll tinker with until I get it to what I like. I also didn't freeze the pumpkin, rather I just added a few ice cubes.

Boring and fairly tasteless.  Use vanilla yogurt instead of milk for a better consistency and flavor.

I feel like this recipe takes pumpkin to a new level. I froze the pumpkin puree for a couple of hours and it worked very well. I did not warm it up at all before using it. I added banana, vanilla, nutmeg, and a small dash of clove. I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar. I agree with some of the reviews below, this is definitely a recipe for the pumpkin lover.

This is really good.  I made it exactly the first time around and thought it was too pumpkiny.  The 2nd time I added 1/2 tsp ground ginger and it really made a difference.  Next time I'll try pumpkin spices to spice it up a bit.

Good fall smoothie. I put a few scoops of vanilla ice cream and a bit of sugar in it to make it a little less tart. I enjoyed it but it isn't for the light of heart, only one out of three people I offered some too would even try it.

I had to alter it a bit. Only had can evaporated milk so I added a little water to it to = 16 oz. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. I dumped it all in a blender with ice cubes and it tastes really good.  Will make this again for sure. Easy peasy

Definitely for pumpkin lovers! I do love pumpkin and I liked this. It's very rich. I used some leftover tinned pumpkin puree I had in the freezer. Followed the recipe and used coconut milk for the milk and added nutmeg instead of cinnamon. Made a healthy and very filling breakfast drink. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Trinka :D

My hubby and I have been trying to get more fruits and veggies in our diet, and this is a great way to get 2 servings! (if you have half the recipe)  The brown sugar is the key.  We tried it with a little cloves and nutmeg instead of part of the cinnamon to make it even more like pumpkin pie.  With just the cinnamon it's great, too.  Next I'll try it hot!

I was short on milk so I used carrot juice to make up the difference.  I also added about a half teaspoon of vanilla.  I used honey instead of the brown sugar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  The smoothies seemed more like milkshakes than smoothies, but they were delicious and I will definitely be making these again.

I tried this recipe as is (with the exception of using a milk alternative seeing as that im lactose intolerant) and found that I didn't like it much.I love pumpkin, but the flavor was too strong. 

I added a banana, little nutmeg, and a splash of vanilla then found it to be perfect for me. My husband LOVED  the smoothie. He was glad I came across this recipe. thanks!

I love pumpkin and I love this! Perfect for those of us who want pumpkin smoothies but don't have yogurt on hand. I make a smaller version since I usually just make this for me, and I add pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon, use canned pumpkin, and a dash of vanilla. Since my pumpkin's not chilled, I usually add a few ice cubes too before blending. Mmmmm good!

This was pretty good! I used my fresh frozen pumpkin puree, added a small frozen banana, as I wasn't so sure about a strong pumpkin flavor for breakfast.  I also replaced about half the milk with plain yogurt, and added some freshly grated nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves.  Nice change from the usual tropical/fruity smoothies.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was pretty tasty; a lot like a summer version of your favorite fall dessert, but healthier.  I think next time I'll make it with vanilla yogurt instead of milk to increase the sweetness and creaminess a bit.

This was pretty good and if I had extra pumpkin on hand again, I would tweak the ingredients a bit more and make again.  Probably add some more sugar and vanilla.
Thanks.

I think it needs less purée and more almond milk. I added coconut sugar and shredded coconut.

Delicious! It was a cozy and warm cold drink, pretty ironic, if you ask me.

I only had unsweetened almond milk, so I used 1/3 C brown sugar instead of 1/4 C... added a splash of vanilla & added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice... Although I liked it... my niece hated it. Her words were “it tastes like pumpkin straight from the can”. And she was right. So next time, I will add a banana & see if that breaks it up a bit. I think it’s worth another shot :) If you love pure pumpkin, you will love this!

Nothing against the recipe, but I wasn't a fan. I like pumpkin, but I guess I just didn't like drinking a pie. I added two bananas and some ginger, and that helped, but I don't think I'll be making this again.

I made it following the recipe EXACTLY... but it was a little too much pumpkin for me. I made it again using about two spoonfuls of the pumpkin and a few scoops of vanilla ice cream (same amounts of spices) and both me and my friend loved it!

I made for one and modified it.  
Modifications:: I used unsweetened almond milk, subbed 1 Tbsp maple syrup , omitted brown sugar, added 1 overripe banana and ice. SUPERB.

Simple and delicious as is but also a great base to add other ingredients to make it your own. I added a banana just to make larger servings. Next time I want to try pumpkin pie seasoning.

Used some unused can pumpkin from Thanks Giving.  Thought that worked well.  Also,  thought I'll try cream or ice cream in place of milk next time.

A family favorite! I've made this several times now and double the recipe for 5 good size servings. We prefer this with a half tsp vanilla (1tsp per double) and use pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon. I use 2 cans of organic pumpkin puree per double & ice. I taste it & usually add a little more spice. Tastes like a frosty pumpkin pie!

Too much cinnamon for my family's tastes. Will probably cut that in half and add an extra banana.

I did have to add a banana and a few drops of vanilla extract because it was a little on the bitter side....maybe because it was fresh pumpkin puree?  Not sure.

As is, I would give the recipe 2 stars - it was too thick for my taste and the flavor was bland.  I found that I needed to add more milk and doubled the brown sugar.  I also added a pinch of salt to bring out some of the sweet.  What I ended up with was pretty much nothing like the recipe, but the ingredients were a good starting point.  A little vanilla yogurt added to this also tasted good.

I used refrigerated pumpkin I had leftover from another recipe. It worked fine, I added ice cubes and I didn't use cinnamon. I probably will make it again since I didn't have to use bananas.

I added more milk then the  recipe called for because it was too thick for my taste and I used a little bit of maple syrup instead of brown sugar. It was pretty good.

This was tasty and filling! It of course has a strong pumpkin flavor, which we love, but I think next time I'll try it with banana for some natural sweetness. I substituted honey and maple syrup instead of the brown sugar, and used pumpkin pie spice. I wanted to have it right away instead of waiting for the pumpkin to freeze, so I used room temperature canned pumpkin and added ice cubes. My 6-year-old loved it too!

Too bland for me. Tried to add chocolate chips for more flavor but that wasnt good either. Going to try a yogurt based one.
