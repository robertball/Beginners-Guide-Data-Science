Excellent - love this cake. Substitute unsweetened apple sauce for the oil and it is still excellent and moist.

Really good. I put in no mayo, but added an unmeasured amount of of applesauce - probably about a cup- and it turned out great.

Delicious carrot cake.  I was a little unsure about using mayonnaise rather than oil, but decided to try it anyway.  This cake baked up very nice and even, no dip in the middle like some carrot cakes that use oil.  We enjoyed the addition of the dried cranberries.  I frosted with a cream cheese icing.  We had this for my son and father's birthday and everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks jowolf2 for sharing your recipe.

I made this for my Boyfriends birthday, I didn't have any pecans but used hazelnuts instead.  OMG was perfectly moist and great.  I used cream cheese frosting, but wasn't even needed.

Made this cake twice already. The first time followed the recipe exactly. It was great the first day when just baked. But when I ate the leftovers out of the fridge the next day, the cake totally changed consistency. It was hard and too dense. Warming it in the microwave for a few secs set it right. Guess the mayo sort of solidified in the fridge or something. The next time, instead of mayo used 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. This time it was perfect. Great flavor and texture even the next day straight out of the fridge.

Loved it as is. To the "reviewer" who said she omitted the nuts and cranberries it is the equivalent of rating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich after omitting the peanut butter and jelly. I wish people would rate the recipe as written not something they dream up.

This was just ok...  I made exact except I omitted the nuts and cranberries because the birthday boy didn't want them in, I felt it was very spongy like, not overly impressed, probably will keep looking for the perfect carrot cake recipe.

Absolutely excellent!  The "only" thing I changed was taking out the cranberries.  Overall a delicious moist cake that kept for days in the fridge.  Your guests will think you bought the cake at the bakery!

This cake was amazing!  I did make a couple changes - I discovered partway through making it that I didn't have ground ginger, so I used fresh ginger instead, and I also swapped from pecans to slivered almonds to avoid a friend's pecan sensitivity.

This is like another cake recipe I have, but with cranberries. Hubby & I both love this, but will add more cranberries next time. Going to make this again for a fundraiser bake sale. Will make a cream cheese frosting then also, but good without icing also.

I made it and it is the best carrot cake ever (sorry, Mom)! I added 2/3 cup of chopped pecans and used a 13"x9" cake pan instead of the 8" round pans. I was in a hurry so I used a cheesecake frosting out of a can. Really easy to make.  This recipe is a keeper and I know it would make awesome cupcakes.

This cake was easy to make, moist and tasty.  Different and with lower calories than many. I made it for my son's birthday and everyone loved it. You could probably use a different combination of nuts and dried fruit.
