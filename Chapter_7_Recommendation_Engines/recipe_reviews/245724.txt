I have enjoyed preparing Easter dinner for the past 16 years.  I seek out a good ham, not smoked, as local as possible, with some pretty good results.  This year I purchased 1/2 pig to support a friend's new farm endeavor, and therefore had a leg of pork.  I did not want it smoked, so fresh ham it was.  I followed this recipe, no changes, and it was the most delicious ham I have ever served up at our family Easter dinner.  The flavor is complimentary to the meat, but not overpowering. I did pick up a meat injector for about $4, and injected the brine evenly through the leg of pork before brining.  I would recommend doing this.  After brining I did the coldwater soak  for about 6 hours, and the salt level was just about perfect to my taste.  I don't like overpowering salt flavor.  I served the maple honey glaze on the side, it went well with everything, from the ham to the potatoes to shrimp!  Try this recipe, homemade is amazing!

Followed recipe except for the pink curing salt. I did not have any in house. Still came out Perfect! 2 1/2 days brining followed with a half hour of clean water soak. Grilled it on the Big Green Egg. Amazing! Next time I will make the sauce.

I used two boneless pork butts, one 8lb one 9lb, and cooked them differently.  I followed the brine recipe except I didn't have pink salt so I subbed sea salt.  I was able to brine both butts in same large ss stock pot.  I brined for 3 days then rinsed in fresh water for about 15 min.  I tied the butts.  I smoked the 9lb butt in my Masterbuilt electric smoker at 275F with Hickory chips until it reached 150F, about 2.5hrs.  I baked the other 8lb butt in the oven as per recipe but without star anise, instead used ground cloves and cinnamon.  The verdict:  Both were super juicy, but everyone thought the smoked butt was FANTASTIC.  The baked butt ended up tasting salty but still OK.  Next time I will rinse in fresh water for longer.  As for the sauce, I used Hazelnut syrup instead of Maple and it was also Fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe.

My first home-cured ham.   This recipe could not have been any easier!    I soaked my ham too much so it was not as salty as I would

I rate 1st try with this recipe  a 5 star...Recipe inspired me to fulfill another try at making a holiday ham...last year was 1st attempt and well it came out like apork roast.....this year much much much b etter...I bought a fresh ham from the market cured for  2 1/2 days...the steps to follow were self explanatory in which is another plus for me because I am the type who over thinks on things when doing for the 1st time...We are very happy with the results ...Thank you Chef John

This was the best ham ever! Yes, you do have to plan ahead, but the results are so worth it. Made this for a New Year's Day party and it was a hit.

This came out fantastic. I kept as close to the recipe as I could with just two small changes. As he hinted at in the video, I cooked this on my gas grill with hickory wood chips to give a nice smokey flavor to the ham. Also, I didn't have any maple syrup for the glaze so I used honey instead. The only thing I would change next time would be to put it in a roasting bag for the brining process to help keep down the mess when I move the tub around in the fridge. I will be doing this one again in the future.

Fantastic Recipe!  Made my first Christmas Ham and it was a hit!  Used a bone-in pork shoulder and worked fantastic.  Wondering if it would work with a boneless pork loin too!
