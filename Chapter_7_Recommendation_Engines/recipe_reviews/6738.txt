If you bake them for five (5) minutes before you drop them in the water, it makes them easier to handle, just pre-heat the oven to 300 for the initial baking, then raise the temp as directed for baking after the water bath.  This also makes them alittle more airy, and less dense.  Works great!

I, like another reviewer, unfortunately tried the Mall Pretzels from this site first...we LOVED that recipe.  This was much quicker to make but the other reviewer was right the other recipe is much better.  This also didn't work very well...oven temp too high and it just didn't taste as good as the other one.  We will keep the other one.  Thanks for the post.

I may have given these a better rating, had I not tried Mall Pretzels from this site first.  These are quicker to make, but not near as good.  The dough was tough to work with, it should rise for an hour first.  When putting the pretzels in the baking soda water, I had one completely fall apart.  I'm not sure I agree with the 475 degree temperature either.  I had mine in for 9minutes, and they burned.  They tasted okay, just more trouble to make than the Mall Pretzels.  I will be using that recipe from now on.

This is a good basic recipe but I did adjust it a bit. I omitted the margarine and used two cups of water. After the dough was mixed I hand kneaded several times and placed the dough in a greased bowl and let it rise for one hour. I then punched it down and kneaded it a couple of more times and cut the dough into sixteen pieces. Once my pretzels were formed I let them rest for about ten minutes while I prepared my boiling water to which I added two tablespoons of baking soda. The pretzels held a perfect shape while poaching and were easily extracted with a slotted flipper. Once cooled I brushed the pretzels with an egg wash and proceeded with a garlic and salt topping. They came out golden and shiney. The gang devoured them! Thanks for a good start Colleen!

Yummy! I followed the measurements exactly and combined it all in my cuisinart (fast!). It makes a nice dough. After shaping I increased the rising time to at least a full hour. I also found that boiling for longer than 1 min. and flipping them half way through in a steady simmer resulted in the chewier consistency we all are looking for. I reduced baking to 7 min. or golden, brushed with melted butter while cooling and sprinkled with either salt or cinnamon-sugar.

Everything went well until I tried to lift them off the pan to boil them.  Since the dough had risen, they were very delicate and were easily misshapen in the transfer process to the pot of water.  Then they came out looking really weird.  They taste good, though.  And since they were boiled, they stay moist for awhile.  So if you can't eat them all right away, they keep pretty well in a Ziploc bag.  I think I'll try some other recipes, though.

The only difference I did was bake them at 400 degrees for 5 minutes; then turned the pan and baked another 3 minutes - because the first time I made them at 475, the batch came out very dark and hard.  I also made one batch of brushed-on butter and coarse salt, and one batch with brushed-on butter and then sprinkled cinnamon sugar.  The kids LOVED this, tasted like Monkey Bread.  I also placed them on parchment paper, and sprayed that with cooking spray.  They did not stick at all.

I like this one because the taste is closer to a soft pretzel you'd get in Philadelphia.  If you are looking for the mall pretzel, this is not the recipe to choose.  These are lighter and fluffier and have a more traditional pretzel taste.  Definitely reduce the oven temperature to at least 450°.  I baked them at that temperature for nine minutes, and they were close to burning.  Next time I'll try it at 425°.

so delicious! The dough was pretty tough and not elasticy at all, but that is likely due to my cold house and my water not being warm enough at the start, but regardless it turned out perfect!  I used another recipes direction on baking, boiled them in a bath of 4cups water to 4 tablespoons of baking soda for approx. 1 minute turning once, and then baking at 400 degrees for 12-14 minutes, top or middle rack so they dont burn.  Baste with butter once cooked and they are delicious!

I tried this recipe to the letter. I believe you should let the dough rise and then make it into ropes, then finish with the recipe, not the other way around. Otherwise, it is a good, easy to prepare treat!

Maybe it was me, but these were not very good at all. I am used to working with dough, but they were soggy and floated all around the pot and broke. I would not make boiled pretzels again!

They came out awsome good and just as soft as mall pretzels. The only thing was the dough was hard to work with so I let it rise first then shaped into pretzels.

Followed this recipe to the letter and it came out perfect! Our first try at soft pretzels is just delicious. I wonder if some who are having trouble with them sticking together are not quite getting the water "just to a boil" -- mine was tiny bubbles but not close to rolling. I was wondering if anybody has ever mixed things into the dough, bagel-style -- would diced green chiles and shredded cheddar work, for example?

As usual I didn't ready the instructions properly and didn't bring the water to a boil.  I have an old and cantankerous oven that I have to work around the idiodsyncrazies of, so bringing the water to a boil was risky.  I instead brought the water to a simmer, put the pretzel in and counted to 30 (for both sides).  Any longer than 30 would produce something a little scary-squishy looking, like it was going to fall apart.  I'm pleased with the results - they browned up beautifully without anything added and the flavour is pretty good.  I wouldn't change anything in the recipe, other than maybe rolling out the dough out to a more thin rope and putting fewer on the baking sheet (mine were kind of like buns more than pretzels in shape).  Overall, a "keeper".

We started a new New Year's Eve tradition by making soft pretzels using this recipes.  I wasn't prepared for the mess after the pretzels are in the water a little more direction would have been nice.  They looked a little crazy but boy were they buttery and yummy.

Now that the baseball season has begun, I am always making this recipe for my Husband to enjoy.  These pretzels are absolutely wonderful and extremly easy to make.  They remain soft for quite some time and can be enjoyed over a couple of days.

This recipe was horrible! The water to flour ratio is not what it should be, and this so-called "dough" is more like murky water. Please have something done about this, I'm sure people have had the same problems with this recipe. Thank you, Dillon.

After letting the pretzels rise, it was difficult to lift from the pan and place in the hot water.  My first pretzel fell apart after leaving it in the water for one minute.  So the others, I just put in a few seconds.  My next 6 pretzels, I didn't let rise long before putting them in the water, and that worked better.  Baking them for 10 minutes burned them.  The pan needs to be re-greased before cooking them.  They were misshaped, but tasted good though.

I am 15 years old  and these pretzels were a hit a my house! I found though that if i added the full amount of flour was too much and i needed to add more water which made it all sticky and not a nice dough so, i used about one cup less. Also i thought that the last part of the directions were not good. instead i used the dough and rolled them into pretzels. then i melted about 3 tablespoons of butter and i added a few pinches of kosher salt just to make sure it was nice and salty, then sort of patted the pretzels with the with a pastry brush full of the butter and i put more kosher salt on top. this made the outside nice and crispy with a nice golden brown colour and a soft melt in your mouth center. I only cooked them for 10 minutes and it worked alot better. i dont know if it is the size of my pretzels but i found they were over cooked. Next time i was wondering if i could put pizza filling in them. i don't know if that would work or if i need a different recipe.

This was so much fun to do! My recipe only yielded 5 pretzels  =D The boyfriend and I did monster ones. For mine, I used 3 cups bread flour and 1 cup all purpose. I let the dough rise as a whole (not in its pretzel shape) on a cookie sheet, on a bit of buttered foil then I covered the   dough with another bit of ungreased foil and THEN covered that with a kitchen towel. I sat the whole thing over a large bowl of hot water to help it rise. 

After we formed the giant pretzels, I baked them for a 5 minutes at 300 degrees and then boiled them. They were a lot easier to handle that way. I took them out of the bath and put them on a paper towel to kind of drain and then cooked them. 
As far as baking time, always watch your oven. The recipe says 12 minutes, and I  did mine for 7. Oven times always differ  so make sure you're in the room and you're SMELLING for doneness. Once you go "ooh, I smell pretzels" they're a minute or two from coming out.  Anyway, They were better than the mall ones. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our spoils quite nicely. I've tried 2 other pretzel recipes that were 'quick and easy' and they just tasted rushed and doughy and not in a good way. Take the time to do it deliciously.

These are really yummy! After having the pretzels at the mall for a snack yesterday, I decided to try to make them at home. The recipe I used was very similar to this one. I added a bit more water to the dough, used 4t of baking soda in the water bath and baked them for 12 min at 400 degrees. I dipped some of them in melted butter and sprinkled them with coarse salt. The others were dipped in the butter and then in cinnamon and sugar. I made 12 med sized pretzels out of the batch.

I will give it a three because I do not wish to put anyone's recipe down. But as to my own experience I found it better to not boil the pretzel. I followed it except for that and they came out more mall type than if I had boiled then. I tryed both ways as my own opinion follow the recipe except the boiling part..delicious..thanks

This recipe is very good. Yes it is difficult to handle the pretzels after they have risen because they're soft and gooey but that's what makes them perfect. They stay very soft even if left out overnight if you do it right. I did let the dough rest after kneading (for about 10 minutes) which I think makes them easier to roll out. When you roll them out make them very thin, they're going to about double in thickness. If you want a really authentic tasting pretzel using 2 T of lye in a quart of water is the correct dip. You have to be careful but my family has always made them that way and they're delicious. Keep an eye on them in the oven, I think 450 is probably closer to the temp you want.

I gave this a 4 because they tasted good. However, they did not come out like pretzels should look. Look kind of flat and deflated.  Not sure what I did wrong.  I followed the instructions.  Any help out there?

Pretzels turned out really good. Not chewy or doughy at all. I did put more water in to boil with baking soda, it seemed like it would not be enough water then adjusted the baking soda amount.

Pretty tasty! I skipped the boiling step for most of them. I worked in a mall pretzel place years ago and so I did what I learned there instead - give them a quick dip in room temp. baking soda water. (fill a baking dish or large bowl 1/2 full of water and add baking soda until very slightly cloudy. Lift a pretzel using two hands "hooking" it through holes with your fingers, give it a dip in the water, then shake off the excess water and put on cookie sheet). Also, I let the dough rise BEFORE forming the pretzels instead of after. They looked and tasted great!! (I did try one pretzel with the boiling method but it came out chewy and a tiny bit soggy.) Also, when you are shaping the pretzels make sure to tuck the bottoms under and give them a pinch so they don't come loose.

Made these for the first time ever and I will never waste my money on mall pretzels again. very easy and fun to make. My kids and husband loved them. The dough was a little tough to knead and it did not rise as much as it should have but they were still a hit!

These were delicious. Let the dough rise as a large ball instead of individual pretzels. Reduced the oven temperature to 350 for 12 minutes. Sprinkled with kosher salt before cooking, then brushed with melted butter after cooked.

Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. The bigger the better! Perhaps a bit more flour could be used when making the dough. I also baked them for 3 minutes before boiling and this helped to maintain the shape.

MMmm... Very good! This was my first time making pretzels and I am quite pleased with the turn-out! They were very nice, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside! A little bland but that can be fixed. I did'nt keep them in the water/baking soda mixture for as long as a minute though. about 30 seconds.

This is my first attempt at making pretzels and they were great! Someone mentioned that there is too much water. The first measurement of 1 1/3 cup is what you use to make the dough. The 4 cups is for boiling with the baking soda. I let the dough rise before shaping and that worked out well. I also didn't have kosher salt, just regular, but they were still so good! Would be even better with some cheese sauce for dipping. They tasted best fresh but reheated ok in the oven.

This recipe was great! I made these with my 3 1/2 year old daughter today and she had a blast! We actually made 8 regular pretzels and then used the dough for the other 4 to make cool shapes. We rolled the dough to about 1/8-1/4 inch and used cookie cutters to make shape pretzels. I baked them on a separate cookie sheet and decreased the time by about 2 minutes. She just thinks it's so cool to eat a pretzel "K" or "star". Thanks for the recipe!

Although I didn’t think the flavor or texture was like a good mall or movie theater pretzel, it was good.

So easy, my 13 year old made these. They turned out perfect, soft on the inside and hard on the outside. Great for school lunches with a side of nacho cheese.

I really liked this recipe. I’m all about simple and easy. Being pregnant I tend to crave a lot of different things, pretzels being pretty high on the list. I however like trying to make my cravings instead of going out and buying them. Cooking is part of how I nest. The only problem I really had is this recipe kinda requires a lot of space at least way more than what I had in my tiny kitchen. I ended up making half into parmesan pretzels and those were my personal favorite. It’s a good recipe I will use it again.

If you are looking for a bread that tastes similar to a pretzel, you will love this recipe.  I'll be honest...it tastes really good, but a true pretzel, it is not. Yes, it has that familiar pretzel-y taste, but it's way more bread-like than pretzel-like. P.S....I have made this three times now, trying to tweak different things, but I end up with breadsticks that taste pretzel-y each time.

This is an absolutely phenomonal recipe. However, as a seasoned bread maker I would strongly recommend that there be two rises. Do a first rise til doubled in size then form the pretzels and do a second rise.

Epic fail. I followed recipe to the letter and had high expectations based upon the reviews. The pretzels did not get dark like regular pretzels, they stuck to the pan (yes I greased the pans) and ruined my cookie sheets. Also didn't taste like pretzels (they did not taste bad...more like a roll). Not sure what I did wrong but never making this recipe again. Way too much work to be disappointed.

Made the recipe exactly as it is presented.  I put a slotted spoon in the water before dropping the pretzels in.  Dropped the pretzels onto the spoon, lifted them out...simple!  Slid them off the spoon onto parchment paper and popped them in the oven.  Came out perfect!  My family loved them!  I will make these again.

Absolutely delicious.  My only problem was that, despite greasing the baking sheet, the pretzels stuck.  It's not a big enough problem to take a star off over.  Yum!
