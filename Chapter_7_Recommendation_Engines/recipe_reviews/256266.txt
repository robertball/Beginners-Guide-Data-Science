After tasting this, I felt that it needed something so I added the seeds of  one vanilla bean. Perfect, but now my 'ice cream' was very runny. I solved this by placing it back in the freezer  and letting it firm back up, just a few minutes. Loved it with the addition of the vanilla bean seeds.

No sweet at all. Had to add Stevia to get a good taste. Still not my fav.
