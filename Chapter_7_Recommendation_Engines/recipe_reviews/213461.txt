We've tried this steak rub three times now, and tonight was the best.... the first couple of times I used the full amount of salt, and tonight I cut both the salt and turmeric in half.  Be sure to apply the rub just before grilling.  If you leave it on too long, the flavor gets too strong, and the meat loses it's juice.  Thanks, Rocky... the best steak we've had all year!

This steak rub Rocks!  I cut the recipe in half for two good sized T-bones and it was perfect.  I did use half the amont of salt though.  It had just the right amount of spice and we melted a little butter over top of them when they came off the grill. I don't think any steakhouse could have compared.  This is a definite keeper - these went great with grilled onions and Leslie's Saltly Grilled Potatoes from this site. Thanks Rocky.

I looked at the ingredients and tried to imagine what this would taste like…I had no idea.  It just looked interesting.  After pulling the steak off the grill, letting it sit for five minutes and tasting it all I can say is, this is absolutely wonderful, a fantastic complement to steak on the grill. The rub enhanced that beef flavor a man looks for without being overpowering.  I would make one adjustment.  As some reviewers who preceded me indicated, I would cut back on the salt. Beyond that, this is something I will use again, and often.  Special note: for those of you who love strip steaks and your significant other likes tenderloin, using a porterhouse and cutting the tenderloin off, cooking it separately (as shown in my photo), is an easy way to satisfy different tastes and different cooking temperatures.

While a T-Bone is a better cut of meat than I'm used to having, this rub blew it out of the water!! Wow!  My husband, who doesn't even care for steak loved it too and couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  I pan fried the steaks in a grill pan, about 8 minutes each side and then put 1/2 a tablespoon of butter on top to melt when done.  I served it with sauted onions and baked potatoes.  I will definitely be using this rub again - maybe it will even make my London Broil taste better!

I hate to give negative feedback, but I feel that the average star rating  for this recipe is out of wack. The spices were way too strong. I was looking for a spice blend to accent the flavor of the meat, but this overpowered it.  It didn't even taste like beef.

Good recipe however too much salt. I would cut down on the amount of salt however husband and son enjoyed it on New York strip steaks.

I think the secret to this recipe is to add the spice mixture right before grilling the steaks otherwise the spices overpower the meat.  However nice this change was we are still partial to our steaks cooked the old fashioned way with salt and pepper.   Served with Tangy Dill Potato Salad also from AR. Nice change for a change Rocky!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good and a nice change from all the sauces. It is simply and very tasty with a slight kick. Like others I decreased the amount of salt. It was so good that I have mixed up a triple batch and bottled it so its ready when I need it. Thanks for sharing this  keeper

This rub was so delicious my husband couldn't stop commenting on how tasty it was! It really was the best seasoning blend; I doubt I'll ever use anything else again!! (I did half the amount of salt used, though).

Wonderful flavor on this seasoning. It did not overpower the meat with salt or heat or spices like so many others rubs and I loved how the flavor of the steak was enhanced. I used kosher salt and only half the cayenne called for and my steaks were straight from the refrigerator not room temp as that disagrees with what I was taught about proper/safe food handling. This was easily as good if not better than any steakhouse seasoning here in Texas. Loved this, thanks Rocky!

Love love love!  Everyone at the cookout got to try a bite and everyone loved it!  I took a bowl and poured canola oil into it then added all the seasonings.  I covered each T-Bone, then put the steaks into ziploc  bags. Since it made it a marinade, I poured it over the steaks and then marinated for about 8 hours. The oil definitely helped to keep the seasonings on the steak when I put them on the grill.

I made this rub and keep in my seasoning stash to put on everything.  I have elementary aged kids so I ease off the pepper & cayenne a bit, but not much.  I put it on the meat (and I've put in on nearly everything) while it comes to room temp.  LOVE it.

This is my go to recipe for steaks! I have used this recipe on T-Bones, ribeyes, and sirloins. The seasonings work so well together and greatly compliment the steak! Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed. I have also used this recipe on the grill, broiled, and pan seared.

Just bought a new grill, my first one!  I wanted to grill some T-Bones for my brothers and their family.  I made the recipe as is, except no cayenne pepper.  Phenomenal!  They all raved about it say it was the best steak ever!  Also made some rosemary grilled potatoes and corn on the cob. This is a keeper!!! Thanks!

This was the first time I have grilled a t-bone and this rub was perfect.  The steak looked amazing and tasted every bit as good.  I did leave out the coriander beacuse I did not have any.

Amazing!  My husband was mistrustful of the steaks I cooked him for his birthday with a dry rub, but he quickly changed his tune, and absolutely loved it!  Next time I will hold off on a little of the salt, but other than that, this recipe is a definite keeper!!  (The salt thing is probably my fault, since I didn't have garlic powder, only garlic salt, and then I played with the other salt amounts to try and compensate.  Have since bought garlic powder!)

For us, the cayenne overwhelmed the basic steak goodness of our very expensive T-bone and the salt is way off. I used the recipe amounts for all the spices but half ("to taste")the salt, which was good saltiness for us. Overlooking the excess heat, this was pleasantly savory. I will try again, using 1/4 the amount of cayenne and think it might be to our liking with those adjustments.

I wanted to try a 'dry rub'. This was excellent! I used smoked paprika and half the salt like some suggested, rubbing it on just before pan frying my T-bone. Yum! Thanks.

We loved it! My daughter don't usually eat steak but she liked this one because the flavors wasn't too
complex. As for the salt, my husband eyeballed it and just sprinkled on the steaks (both sides) first before adding the rest of the dry rub. I think he halved it though. I'm not too sure. We also let it rest for a few minutes on a plate, covered with foil.

Only used 1/2 the salt and was still almost too salty.  Otherwise, very flavorful.

We liked this seasoning.  It did not over power the taste of the meat--a very subtle flavor.

Fantastic! Great rub, complex. People seem to object to different spices used here; that's one nice thing about a homemade mixture, is you can leave out or adjust the amounts of ANYTHING to personal taste. I only used 1/3 as much cayenne as called for and it was still a little spicy for my boys. I used the full amount of salt, but it was large-grain. I agree with others that was a little too salty.

Very tasty, but I add 1 T brown sugar as well.  I use this recipe everytime I make steak.

This is a recipe to make your own way... glad I only put in half the salt. I subbed cumin for turmeric because I didn't have any. I used my judgement as to how much of the rub I wanted to put on the meat. Even though the salt level in this had to be adjusted so much, I won't give this any less than 5 stars. This will be a repeated blend in our house. I'm sure hamburgers would benefit with it sprinkled on as well.

The cayenne pepper give it a nice kick.  We really enjoyed this.  Made enough so we're having it tomorrow on some grilled chicken.

OMG Rocky this is deadly! I used half the salt as others suggested and immediately made a large batch for future use. I'll never grill another piece of cow without it again.

I looked at all the reviews and also noticed for the first time that you can change the amount of servings you have and calculate accordingly.  I had two servings.. I didn't have Turmeric either like most of us, but it was still good.  Since I HATE anything spicy hot, I only used a pinch of cayenne.  One thing I added which Emeril suggested on his recipe for T-bone Steaks was to put 1 Tbsp of Olive oil on each side of each steak before rubbing the spices in, which was an awesome idea.  I used a little less pepper like everyone suggested.  And I did add an additional sprinkle of Emerils original spices on both sides before grilling.  And for a good size steak, really make sure your grill is super hot and set a timer for 3.5 minutes on each side. It was a very great steak and will be using this recipe again!!

I made this for two 1.5lb T-Bone steaks, they came out amazing! My dinner date could not stop talking about how good they were. I finished up the steaks by rubbing some unsalted butter on them while they were still grilling. For those complaining that the steaks are too salty read the ingredients more carefully i.e. 4 teaspoons salt, OR TO TASTE! So if you don't like a lot of salt add less!

This wasn't bad - but not quite what I expected, I guess.  Still, will keep on hand and try on burgers, perhaps?  When it comes to a nice steak, I guess I'm pretty much set on enjoying the flavor of the steak itself - - - probably just my tastes.

This is the first time I have ever grilled a steak without someone looking over my shoulder and telling me what to do every 5 seconds and it was SO GOOD! Use this recipe if you need a cooking ego boost because it is hard to mess up (even if you leave anything out) and delicious. We drank a 2005 Zin with it and it was DELICIOUS! I've paid $35 for this meal at a restaurant but tonight it was only the cost of the meat! YUM YUM YUM.

This seasoning is the absolute best.  I, too, prefer to cook my own steaks using this recipe than to eat anyone else's.  I feel like I'm the best cook ever when I serve my family a steak that's been seasoned with your recipe.  Thank you for sharing!  By the way, any recipes for other meats you'd like to share :-)....seriously!

Far too salty - husband resorted to steak sauce to cover the flavor. The spices seem to go well together, but definitely cut back the salt if you are going to try this.

I made this rub for two steaks. I followed the recipe except for adding salt and turmeric, didn't have any, but used ginger instead.
Only thing is we had an unexpected situation and had to put the steaks in a ziplock with the rub on them and didn't cook them until the next day. I was so afraid that sitting that long would be too much spice. But..Oh my gosh...were they ever good! Not too much and you could still taste the juicy steak. Thanks Rocky...we'll be using this again.

Excellent flavor.  I agree with others that it tastes like a restaurant quality steak.  I used a little less salt than called for and half the turmeric called for.

Made the rub exactly like in the recipe then cooked the steaks on the grill with some hickory wood in a smoker box....absolutely amazing.  My wife says she doesn't want steak prepared any other way than this from now on.  Thanks Rock.

Absolutely fantastic. I'm actually surprised this was posted, most people guard recipes this good as family secrets. Like the Colonel posting his chicken recipe lol (almost) I've tried every marinade possible for years thinking that was the best way to go but this by far beats everything.   This is a true restaurant quality steak recipe.

This was a great rub! I did halve the salt as recommended by others and added a little sazón seasoning to it. I also used a little olive oil to rub down the steaks too and get the spice rub to stick better. This is a keeper!

I used 3 T-Bone steaks (on sale at Kroger this week).  Brushed with Olive Oil and sprinkled with Savory Sensation (Homemade Gourmet spice).
Cooked over High Heat for 8 min total.  Medium (some pieces had more red than others)

Delicious!

I reduced the cayenne only because I prefer less spicy, but this is my favorite and I tell everyone about it. I cook my steaks in butter with a couple garlic cloves, a sprig of rosemary and a couple of thyme to season the butter, and I'll never go back to anything else.

Forgot to mention what I added to your recipe rock. 1st, I cut the amounts for 1 steak. I coated both side with olive oil, and sprinkled 1 1/2 caps full o liquid smoke. Then I added 1/2 tsp of rosemary, 1/2 tsp of basil. Rubbed all the ingredients in on both sides and let it stand for 30 minidress after I pulled it from the feeding.

I didn't have tumeric or coriander and I used garlic salt and onion salt in place of so much of the physical salt. I put the rub on an hour before with a little olive oil and put back in the fridge until we grilled them. They were amazing! I used all the rub on just two steaks.

This became our go to steak recipe since the first time we tried it. I've made this countless times and its just perfect every time. I served this last Christmas and it was a huge hit, I substituted for rib eyes because they were on sale and was making 25 steaks, they were just as good as the T-bones. I adjust the cayenne pepper and turmeric whenever I make it for my kids. However, I always half the salt and use sea salt. There have been times when I do not have any coriander and I have used cumin instead, you can't tell the difference. Seriously, this is a must try you won't be disappointed.

This steak seasoning is the best!  It tastes so right with the steak!  The only change I made was to reduce the salt as I am on a low sodium diet.  I will not buy steak seasoning again!  Thanks, Rock!

Great recipe. I use this rub on pretty much all cuts of steak. I now keep it on hand, pre-made in a little Tupperware container.

I have made this many times I use it on cheaper steaks that do not have alot of marbling to get some good flavor out of them. I also accidently used this on a pork butt before putting it on the smoker it turned out FANSASTIC!! I found out later I had used the wrong dry rub....I use it on purpose now.

OMG! This has by far been the best dry rub I have tried. Made me feel like a true chef of the house hold. Definitely will make it hard to order a steak out. You don't need any dipping sause with this one.

This was amazing as is. I did omit half the amount of salt because it seemed a bit excessive (and that's that I like salt). Also, I seared it in a cast iron pan with a bit of butter, garlic, and thyme. Wow! My fiance loved it! Definitely going to make again!

I used the dry rub on some pork tenderloin steaks; really good.  A bit more salt than I would like, so I'll tone down the salt a little next time.

My husband and I really enjoyed these steaks.  I made half the recipe for two 3/4 lb ribeyes. I cut the salt in half, but  I could have done a little more. In my opinion I could have cut down on the cayenne pepper. My husband thought they were good they way they were.

This was awesome! I did as others suggested by halving the salt and sprinkling the spices onto the meat just before cooking the T-bones. The spices complimented the meat and I was really surprised at how well the tumeric added to the overall flavour. It was delicious. I'll probably use this spice mix again with T-bone.

This recipe is amazing.  If you have kids you might want to decrease the pepper.  I broiled the steaks in the oven on HI for 4 minutes on each side.

I read the comments and cut the salt in half. My husband loved this rub and we decided this would be our go to rub. Next time for a kick I'll use my hot paprika. Highly recommend.

I use this recipe every time I have steak no matter the cut of meat, my family won't let me try any other marinade or rub. I now cut back on the salt (about half) and increase the garlic and onion powder's. Also, depending on my audience I may adjust the cayenne powder.  Love the flavour of these spices on steak! Delicious every time!

This is a copycat recipe of Longhorn Steak House's "Prairie Dust"  that they season just about everything with.  You can use this on pork chops, steaks, fries, anything really.  As for the recipe itself, you do have to tinker with the amounts, especially the salt to make it to your liking.

With a few adjustments, this recipe is great.  It really adds a nice flavour to steak.  As others suggested, I reduced the salt, by more than half.  We found it a bit spicy, so next time we'll cut the cayenne in half also.

Very impressed but like every one here mentioned, need to cut down on the salt. I followed all the instructions minus the salt. I added the salt directly on the steaks. I have cooked awesome steaks with garlic and butter and this receipt is hard to beat.

This a great way to season your steaks.  I did not use the amount of salt called for.

This is hands down, the best steak I've ever had -- at home or at a restaurant.  I never knew steak could be so flavorful!  I've made it three times now and doing so again tomorrow night for company.  (I cut the salt to about half, and I don't yet have coriander, so I make it without it.)

It is a winner!  I usually marinate steak but was looking for something different and had good t-bones on hand.  This made them incredible.  Will definitely do again.  Thanks.

My husband was in love!  I used half the salt and 1/3 of the cayenne (I wanted the kids to eat it).  I also did not have any turmeric, but it was still exceptionally delicious!

I love a good T-Bone steak, having grown up in the Midwest where good beef was always a part of the weekly menu.  These days, due to the expense, I rarely eat steak, so when I found a great deal on them, I was excited to finally enjoy one again.  I hesitated using this recipe because I thought all the spices may overpower the flavor of the meat.  But it was terrific!  I followed others advice, and halved both the salt and the turmeric.  Really great recipe and deserves the raves everyone is giving it.

This was excellent. I cut some of the salt out like others suggested and it was still pretty salty, but it was delicious. I will definitely be making this again!

The rub has a good basic flavor but I feel like it has too much pepper. I reduced the fresh ground black pepper by half as well as the cayenne and it had a better flavor. It complimented the meat vs flavoring it. Very good basic recipe, and I use it often for beef, I also have sprayed just a touch of butter flavored fat free cooking spray directly on the meat to help hold the rub and it adds a nice butter flavor to the mix.

Made this for mother's day and it was a hit!  I have not had better steak from anywhere!  I have always grilled my steak as is and allowed my wife to add steak sauce on her plate.  She did not even touch the steak sauce!  I did cut back on the salt as suggested, but found the flavor of this rub to be wonderful!

I rarely grill steaks.  More of a chop, turkey fillet kind of a guy.  (I'm the husband of this member).  Even then, I don't even use dry rubs.  It's just a foreign concept to me, but I decided to try this on some nice t-bones we bought.

This rub is MONEY!  I can't remember the last time I had a steak this good, period.  My wife and I couldn't get over how much flavor came from the meat using this rub, and how nothing was overpowering, or stood out.  It was all in the right proportions.

The t-bones we bought were even on sale, so nothing fancy about the meat--this rub was great.

I enjoyed this rub! I used the 4 tsp of salt and did not find it to be to salty.  I did not have t-bone steaks, so I used the steaks I had in the freezer and it was good.  I put the steaks in the oven on broil because I did not feel like firing up the grill and it was good this way also.

Good stuff.  Didn't change a thing.  I started out with only using 1/2 the amount of salt.  After tasting the blend with only 2 tsp salt I decided that it could use a little more.  Added another tsp and tasted and thought, I should just go ahead and follow the recipe as written.  Glad I did.  While the blend tastes a bit on the HOT side on it's own, it's perfect on steak.  It doens't over powere the flavor of the beef.  Rather it's a nice compliment.  Try this, you'll love it.  As other reviewers suggested this reminds me of steak you would find in a nice steak house!

Very good flavor. The only change I made was that I cut the salt in half.  Still was a bit salty but could be because my steaks were very thin.
