With a few altercations, mine turned out wonderful!!!  Delete onion and lemon, instead, use 1/2 bottle of Mrs. T's bloody mary mix.  Put the hot sauce in the boiling mixture, not at the end.  Add about twice as much garlic cloves, so when all is done, you use the soften garlic to spread on some dried italian bread.  Absolutely delicious.  Can also add crab legs.

This was wonderful! I loved the fact that exact amounts are given for the water & the seasoning. I recently had another seafood boil that didn't & it wasn't seasoned as well as I would have liked. I also liked the suggestion of saving the stock & using it in a soup... I can't believe I threw it all out on my last seafood boil. I did add closer to 5 quarts of water (needed it for coverage) but only added the 1/2 cup of Old Bay & I think that was plenty. I added a lb. of King crab & OMG! there was a lot of food for 2 people....we'll be eating the leftovers all weekend (not that I'm complaining LOL). Hubby & I loved the flavor the boil gave the corn (I used frozen but thawed half cobs because I didn't have any fresh) & the potatoes. Thanks for another great recipe Pam!

This was OK, but there are better shrimp boil packets out there than using Old Bay Seasoning.  And it would be easier and quicker to use a shrimp boil packet.  My corn didn't turn out very well with this recipe.

This recipe was fairly quick and easy.  Only change I made was to put in 1/4 C of Old Bay instead of 1/2.  Even my two sons who don't eat corn at this.  Delicious!

I tried this recipe for the first time when my daughter and I went to the beach for a week.  We absolutely LOVED it!  My daughter and my boyfriend are a little on the picky side.  I made it for my boyfriend and he has already requested I make it again.  AWESOME and so easy!

Spicy and easy to make.  My husband thought this tasted like something we would get at a restaurant.  I left the water in after cooking and served with garlic toast.  The soup mixture was great for dipping!  Great recipe!
