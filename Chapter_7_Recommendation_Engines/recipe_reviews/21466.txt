I was really scared, based on the other reviews, that this would be WAY sweet and soggy.  I subtracted an egg and used one cup of milk, and it turned out great!  My roommate said it was the best french toast she's had!  It was sweet, but I wouldn't say overly sweet...it was overly good though, I ate a lot :)

Mmmm!  This was full of caramely goodness!  I used a loaf of fresh sourdough and skim milk.  I put in a little less butter than it called for.  I used walnuts instead of pecans.  I didn't use the blender for the eggs, just a whisk.  I almost didn't make the caramel sauce to spoon over it, but I'm glad I did.  I spooned the leftover sauce onto the leftover french toast before putting it in the fridge.  I love baked french toast dishes, and I will make this one again!

This recipe would have been better had I reduced the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg to 1/2 tsp each. The amts required tasted off to me, esspecially with the combination of the caramel...and cinnamon is typically a favorite spice! I took other reviewer's advice by using only 1 layer of caramel (the bottom layer)b/c when you serve, you can flip it over so that the caramel is on top. Also, I only used 1 layer of bread, which was thick-cut french bread slices. Finally, I only used 3/4 of the egg/milk/spices mixture...as I poured overall, I suddenly had an image of a previous baked french toast failure (from this site) which resulted in way too soggy bread. Glad I did (but sorry to waste the remaining 1/4-1/3 amt of mix)b/c the toast turned out very good. Only a few spots were a little mushy but overall, most had cooked to the proper texture. Served with sausage and hashbrowns...what a meal! I would make this again, reducing the egg/milk a little (so not to waste) and the spices to 1/2 tsp. Thanks Stefanie!

Love it!!! I have made this recipe often. I have teenagers and when their friends sleep over they love this scumptous breakfast. It is an easy low mess way to feed a group.
I will share all my modifications with you....
I have made it in the morning without the overnight sit and baked it right away both ways turned out fine. I tear the bread into bits and have used all kinds of bread, from white to wheat to cinnamon and even hamburger buns when I was low on bread.
I combine the carmel sauce and pour it all on the bottom for lots of goey sauce when dishing.  I also reduce the milk to 1cup and use 8 eggs to prevent it from being soggy. I don't put in the nutmeg and choose to sprinkle the cinnamon directly onto of the bread.  It has been perfect every time!!

This was fabulous! I made it for Christmas morning and my family loved it! I made it again for a "breakfast for supper" meal on New Year's Eve with friends and the dish was emptied!
Good and sweet!

Way too sweet. It didn't need the top layer of bread, and just one layer of caramel sauce would have been plenty. I used French bread and didn't have a problem with the layers being moistened, but after pouring on the eggs and milk, I did have to spoon the mixture over the top layer of bread a few times to coat it.

There is no way that I would ever pour another layer of caramel sauce over the top - it was way too sweet to begin with!  Overall, though, it was a pretty tasty dish, and my boyfriend even commented that it was "better than normal french toast."  Give it  a try.

Very sweet, but good.  We didn't use the carmel sauce, but next time we make we'll use the sauce and not the 1st 3 ingredients.  We'll use alot less nutmeg also. A nice change from rolls.

My children did not like this recipe as it was too mushy, husband eats anything.  This recipe takes a lot of work, not worth the effort.

YUMMY!  My family won't eat nuts, so I left the pecans out and added thin apple slices instead.  It tasted like carmel apples!  Great to get new breakfast ideas... Thanks!

This was very very good.  I read through many reviews and made the following changes which worked well.  I did not make the additional caramel sauce and we had plenty.  I only used the bottom layer of caramel and one layer of bread.  I thick cut a loaf of french bread - my 9 x 13 pan used 6 slices.  I only used 5 eggs, 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and it was plenty.  I only used 1/2 cup (1 small baking package) of pecans and put them on the bottom layer of caramel sauce prior to covering with bread.  After the dish baked I flipped it out on a serving platter and it was beautiful.

Wonderful! Was a hit at a Valentine's Brunch. I cut the bread up in cubes instead to make it easy to serve and just mixed the pecans in with cubes. And based on others' suggestions,  after baking I turned it upside down on a platter. Gorgeous and no need to make additional Caramel Sauce.  Everyone raved about it. I said it was like a combination of bread pudding and cinnamon rolls (only easier to make!) I loved that I could make it the night before and just cook it in the morning. This will replace my caramel cinnamon roll recipe and I'll make it for every brunch!

YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Make sure you pour most of the egg mixture on the outer edges of the bread pan, the mixture will drain to the middle as it sets.  I baked it for a little longer than suggested to cook all the way through.  It is delicious!

Excellent recipe!! Very delish!  I used a thick cut country style bread that I bought at Panera. Also, I didn't make the extra caramel sauce and I didn't think I needed it at all.  Other posters were correct in that if you served it "upside down" it looked perfect.  Next time I will try to make a filling for it using cream cheese and cherry jam.

I'm quite surprised at all the good reviews on here. I made this for brunch, and wasn't too thrilled with it. Two of my kids liked it, two didn't, and hubby didn't. I used fresh Italian bread, followed the recipe and must say that it initially looked delicious. I served it, and was disappointed. The bread was mushy and looked like... well, let's just say it was mushy. The caramel on the bottom became hard as a rock within minutes of serving. As I was eating it, I was concerned about my dental work. We couldn't have seconds, as it was all just too hard. The taste was okay, certainly not worth making again. I was going to give this three stars, but hubby, who usually praises everything I make, whether good or bad, quietly said, "Two Stars". I took his advice.

Was good, but I may have baked it a bit too long. My oven is kinda mean and the caramel got a bit too sticky. My boy's didn't care for it, my husband did. So mixed reviews here. I will try 1 more time for good measure. I used the Texas toast and it was almost dry. I will leave the milk ratio the same next time instead of cutting it back to avoid sogginess.

This is a keeper! I used 5 eggs and 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2. I made only a single layer with raisen cinnamon bread. Use non-stick foil to line baking dish. Then you just need to lift it out and flip it over onto your serving dish. No messy dish to clean up.  The hot carmel sauce from the bottom now becomes the wonderful sauce on the top. Really no need for the extra sauce. Everyone loved this dish.

I have made this several times, trying different things == and at worst, it's a hit. I make it for a big group (dish to pass) and found it's easier to serve if I cut the bread into bite sized pieces before putting it in the egg mixture overnight. I usually make a double batch of egg-bread mixture but use the same amount of caramel sauce on the bottom and top. I also usually cook it until it's done, which is closer to an hour.  OH! And as I don't usuallly have corn syrup on hand, I use store bought immitation maple syrup - which is mostly corn syrup anyway. Adds a hint of maple.

I made this for a brunch a couple of days ago.  I was a little worried b/c I had never done a test run before...  The only difference I made is that I bought two loaves of french bread (the long narrow kind at the grocery store) & cut both up to equal two layers of bread in the pan.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  It was soooo good.  Everyone went for seconds & said they loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.  I would give it ten stars if I could!

OMG!!!! This is simply the BEST! And the easiest! I made this for Christmas brunch and the only problem I had was that I did not make double! The changes that I made were 1 cup milk, 5 eggs, no nuts. After i poured the egg mixture onto the bread, I thought that it looked a little too much, so I then poured about 1/3rd back out. I was afreaid of mushy results. It was in the oven for about 50 minutes and it was perfect!!!!!!
After it came from the oven I turned the pan upside down onto a serving platter. I did serve the extra sauce on the side. YUMMY! MUST TRY !

Made this when I got word that I needed to make brunch for 15 people.  It was great!  I cut french bread into bite size pieces and only did 1 layer.  I also only used 5 eggs and 1 cup of milk (I don't like soggy french toast)  It turned out great.  The toast got nice and crispy, and with the carmel sauce poured over the top...YUM!

My husband loved this!! Since there are just two of us, I made it in one layer. I used 5 pieces of bread and 4 eggs and adjusted the ingredients that go with the egg mixture. I will definitely make this again.

I used this recipe's brown sugar icing to serve with traditional french toast.  I made my french toast with peanut butter sandwiched inside.  With the brown sugar topping it was to die for.

Fantastic! The texture you get is not crispy-toast-like, it's more like bread pudding - but definitely not soggy. Just be careful with the amount you put in, depending on bread type, and how dry your bread is in the first place. It's a great recipe to use if you have leftover baguette or pumpernickel. Use less liquid if using fresh, moist bread. I didn't have pecans (so no layers), didn't use extra spices, and didn't make the syrup for the next morning. I cubed leftover pumpernickel bread that had dried out, placed it evenly over the caramel sauce, then poured the milk/egg/vanilla mix on top until just damp (almost all of it). It turned out great!

Heavenly! Just like caramel pecan rolls! Used 4"x4" buttered casserole dishes for individual servings.  Turn upside down into second pan or on plate so that caramels and pecans are on top rather then the bottom, this also avoids the need for the extra caramel sauce. Used cubed sandwich bread (you don't want it to be too fresh), rather then sliced french bread. Wonderful brunch recipe!

ATTN GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE:  I made it just as written, using Udi's whole grain bread from Costco (therefore the slices were larger than the standard Udi's loaves). It turned out perfectly. The amount of liquid was just right, and the extra caramel sauce was also good to have a drizzle or two of, though we didn't use nearly all of it. It got rave reviews from everyone- my gluten-eating husband and brother-in-law, my gluten free kids, and my gluten-free sister.

OMG good...but I made this every Sunday for a month since the family loved it so much & i think I gained 5 pounds! (worth it!) Anyhow, I prefer French bread & soak over night in egg/milk mix with cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla, I save the salt for adding to the caramel sauce to make it more of a sea salt caramel. (or toast your nuts with butter & salt to get that extra flavor) mmm...I add a touch of half & half to my caramel to keep it creamy and make sure I have enough for drizzling over at the finish. Putting the nuts on the pan with the caramel before baking is good & it is also great to just toss into the caramel & drizzle on after baking bread. THANK you for sharing, this will be a family favorite forever!

YUM! I have a 4 year old and a 4 month old so, the night before prep was key. My kitchen smells fantastic. I used a non fat milk and a honey oat (whole grain) bread. (I used a homemade butter butter to even the playing field) Next time I will add more pecans and possibly garnish with banana slices (only for personal preference) Great, simple;delicious recipe. Loved it.

I made this as the recipe directed and while it was good, (the kids, especially, loved it) it wasn't great. It was too sweet, even for someone like me who has a major sweet tooth and a bit soggy. My husband suggested that we cut the egg mixture in half so it toasts better and then top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and then the caramel sauce. Mmmm...going to have to try that...

YUM -  I did add dates to the mix.  The topping of caramel sauce was "Mexican goat milk caramel. "  I heated it in the micro and poured some of it over the baked dish.  We all enjoyed it -  however seemed when it cooled off it was a bit "Mushy".  Made it for a Christian brunch -  and it was well liked.  My hubby does not like bread pudding -  and he thought it too much like bread pudding.  He is the only one who did not like it.

This was really sweet and really good!! Served it with sliced bananas. The changes that I made were: 5 eggs, 3/4 c. skim milk and 14 slices cinnamon bread cut into bite sized pieces. I baked it in a glass pyrex dish and did not have a problem with it burning as some other reviewers did.

I made a few modifications I was happy with. First of all, I couldn't wait 8 hrs to prepare the meal, so I dipped the bread in the egg mixture and heated it on the skillet. The caramel sauce: I added some water to dissolve the sugar first. Then I added the corn syrup and the butter. I was much happier with the texture of the caramel. Yummy!

Very Good but very rich. I will use less than half of the sauce this calls for next time. If you like it rich then leave it as it is.. very similar to sticky buns.

Since this sounded good but we don't like overly-sweet foods, we cut the caramel bottom by half.  Also used cut up cubes from a 16oz French bread loaf.  Added a couple more eggs and extra milk since the bread was quite dry and really soaked up the liquid (soaked for about an hour, not overnight).  Sprinkled the top with cinnamon since we forgot the vanilla and seasonings when mixing the eggs and didn't make the additional caramel sauce topping.  As we made it, the texture was good, it tasted like french toast (though not as browned as what you'd make on the stove top, and the caramel bottom (top if you flip it) took care of the need for any syrup.  Tasty, and points for the ease and speed of making.

This is the best of these recipes that I have tried!  I left off the caramel topping though, since my family likes maple syrup on their french toast.  (I also left out the pecans because of an allergy issue.)  We loved it so much, I made it again a few days later!

I know better than to try out a new recipe on Christmas day. :( I have yet to try a soak overnight french toast recipe that isnt soggy. I did reduce the milk to 1 cup and used Texas Toast. It was still soggy in parts and dry in others. ? Its too sweet too, and I LOVE sweets. Maybe all the other sweets that come with Christmas is too much and I should make a savory Breakfast recipe for us. Who knows. I didnt enjoy this at all and made it exactly as stated just reducing the milk by half a cup in hopes to reduce soggi-ness. No luck. I gave it 3 stars because it did have a good taste. i could probably tweak it and come up with something yummy. But regular french toast is actually better than this. Good luck.

With the reviews I thought this would have been better. I followed the directions except omitted the pecans b/c my daughter is allergic to them.  The bottom was a soggy mess so I flipped it and baked it some more which did seem to help.  I tried a bite and it was like eating soggy scrambled eggs with carmel sauce.  The most positive part was my kitchen smelling fabulous.  I will keep looking.  Thanks for sharing anyway.

Let me start off by saying that I hate reading reviews because no one ever follows the actual recipe. Everyone changes it!! I want to read reviews of the actual recipe and not how people change it. On that note, I decided to make the recipe according to the actual directions. The french toast was okay. I love french toast and this did not make the grade for me. It was not as soggy as some reviewers made it sound. I did, however, broil the toast for the last 5 minutes which made it a little crunchy which was great!! I loved the caramel bottom. I actually served mine upside down so the caramel was on top. I also did not use the extra caramel sauce the recipe called for because there was enough on the bottom of the pan. Not sure that I will try this recipe again.

Amazing! I made this for Christmas breakfast, and it was easy and delicious. I left out the pecans for the picky eaters. Between the three of us we ate the whole thing, so it didn't seem like a lot of food to me.

Great recipe.  I can see why people think it's sweet, but if you like cinnamon rolls or the like, these should taste fine.  The recipe at the beginning said to cook brown sugar/butter mix until thick and it kinda starts pretty thick so I didn't cook long.  Mine ended up soaking in a lot to the bread instead of becoming caramelly like the pictures seem.  Next time I'll cook mine for a few minutes to thicken it more.  Didn't change the fact that it was still very good.  I did tear my bread into chunks too just b/c I thought it would work better and it came out fine.

ooey gooey goodness!!  I made this dish for Christmas morning and it was superb! It was great for Christmas morning because I did everything the night before and then popped it in the oven right before we started opening gifts, once we were done with the presents breakfast was ready.   I did make some very minor adjustments:  *I used challah bread  *Because challah brean is so thick I didn't "sandwich" the pecans, only one layer *I didn't put any pecans in 1/4 of the dish because my stepdaughter can't eat nuts due to her braces, even the parts w/o pecans were yummy!  I definitely recommend this recipe :)

I just made this french toast for a mother's day brunch.  I would give this 500 stars if I could.  I took the advice of another review and used bakery fresh cinnamon raisin bread. The caramel sauce on top of this was perfect.  Some of us even put a spoonful of whipped cream on top.  My young daughters LOVED this.  This one is a keeper!!

Ohhhh man... Wonderfully delicious! Due to DH preference, I nixed the nuts.  Used stale Vienna bread.  5 Eggs / 1 Cup Milk.  Also, added my trademark splash of Almond Extract.  For the "Topping" bit of caramel sauce, I also added in a splash of heavy cream and vanilla.   This will be a "Packer Sunday" brunch addition for sure!

This was delicious!!! Instead of making the additional caramel sauce, I just turned each piece over on serving plates so that the bread with sauce was right side up.

I made this recipe for Christmas brunch.  It was fantastic and MUCH better than the  Baked French Toast recipe from this site.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a really tasty recipe.  I used homemade cinnamon swirl bread and definitely recommend it.  I left out the chopped pecans and the extra caramel sauce; I think rather than have two layers of bread with extra caramel, just one layer of bread with half the milk/egg mixture would be much better.  That's what I'll do next time, because the caramel baked into the bottom layer of bread was absolutely delicious.

Sooooooo delicious!!! It tastes more like a sticky bun than french toast. Don't skip the caramel sauce when you serve it, it really adds the finishing touch. We went through all of the caramel sauce and only half of the pan of french toast, so I would suggest doubling the sauce if you think the entire pan of toast will be eaten. This is very sweet, so keep that in mind if you aren't a fan of sweets for breakfast. My whole family loved it when I served it for Christmas Brunch.

OMG!! I can't even explain how delicious this is!! I had it at Easter Brunch, and the lady who made it, used a French Baguette instead, which made it convenient to just have single servings that you could seperate easily instead of having to cut it.

This is DELICIOUS, albeit VERY sweet.  The only change I make is to drain the excess liquid from the baking dish before popping it into the oven.  YUM!!!!

Delicious! and easy! I'm going to make this for company.  Tastes like hot fresh gooey cinnamon buns with alot less work.  Didn't have light corn syrup so I used regular Aunt Jemima pancake syrup and it works just fine. Next time I will use whole wheat bread and cube it rather than layering slices (the top slices crusts got rather crunchy and were kind of hard to slice through), and I think a layer of cream cheese in the middle would be really good too. Caution...very sweet and way too tempting if you are on a diet!

I had the opposite problem of the bread not getting soaked through. Mine was completely mushy. I used less bread, because of the other reviews I read. It tasted great, and the part of the bread not submerged in the egg mixture was delicious, but the texture otherwise was very disappointing. Love that caramel sauce, though! Quick and easy. Will probably use that on other stuff.

A huge hit at my Mother's Day Brunch.  Though the extra layer of bread wasn't needed and didn't soak up a lot of the egg mixture. Overall, it was quite tasty!!

I think the nutmeg flavor was overpowering.  And I only used 1/2 tsp.  I overcooked the caramel sauce for the bottom layer and it wasn't a gooey sauce in the bottom, it got a bit hard after baking and then cooling on your plate.  So just heat it until the sugar is dissolved.  (I am not rating the recipe down because of that-it was my error.)  If I were to make it again, I would probably use 1/4 to 1/2 cup less milk.  It was just a little soggy in the center when nicely browned on top.  But overall, my fmaily just really did not care for the taste. This was convenient for a make ahead, but I will try something else instead.  Presentation was nice, it did look visually apealing.

Turned out awesome!!! Changes I made were: 1 full loaf of french bread torn in pieces, added 2 extra eggs, used almond milk, 2 apples chopped, did not use nutmeg and did not put second layer of caramel sauce. Also I just used a whisk in a bowel instead of blender and baked it covered for 35min then uncovered for 10min. Our guests loved it. Came out perfectly cooked.

I make this every year for christmas morning. For ease of serving, I cube the bread and make 1.5x the liquid.   Amazing stuff! Makes great bread pudding recipe as well, if made in smaller individual portions.

I left foil covering it for the first 20 minutes of baking.  Removed from oven when top was dry yet still soft. Let sit to cool 5 minutes before serving.  No caramel sauce...it was sweet as is and we didn't need sauce or syrup.  Excellent!  Thanks for making this for us Aunt Carol!

I really wasn't a fan of this..but my kids liked it. It was very easy to prepare and I liked that in the morning all I had to do was pop it in the oven. However, the bread came out very soggy and you could really taste the nutmeg. I probably wont follow this exact recipe again..I'll need to do some tweaking of my own.

This recipe was excellent!!  Some say it is too sweet, but with a good cup of coffee or glass of milk it is perfect.  It is not soggy at all.    I don't think you need to serve it with anything as heavy as quiche and home fries though.  Maybe some simple scrambled eggs or however you like them, and maybe a slice or two of bacon.  Will definitely make this again!!!

Loved it!  Based on other reviews I used 5 eggs and 1 cup of (skim) milk - it came out crisp on top and not soggy at all underneath.  I didn't make the sauce for the top - didn't think it needed it.  I'm sure it's delicious with the sauce too but it was plenty sweet without it!  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast and my family and I loved it!  I think it will become a Christmas breakfast tradition.  Per some of the reviewers, I skipped the extra carmel sauce and it definitely does not need it, it is plenty sweet by itself.  I also used canadian white bread instead of the french bread just because, and it worked very well.  Thank you for sharing your yummy recipe!

Very good, but I'll use less of the egg mix next time so it won't be so soggy. I purchased a loaf of french bread, sliced it thick, and let it sit all day to get stale. I also left off the topping and flipped it on a platter before serving. PERFECT!

This was great! I found the carmel too sweet though so i added more of a streusel topping to it.

Came out great! I made half the amount for me and my boyfriend. It made four nice size portions. I used Challah bread and it came out great. I split all the ingredient measurements in half and refrigerated overnight. When I make it again I will use the FULL egg mixture (step 3 of the directions). The Challah was a little dry on the top layer. Caramel Sauce was great and so easy! Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Yum! Extra sauce not needed - it is an easy make-ahead breakfast and tasted great with bacon & fruit. I cut back and used 1 1/4 cups of milk, but I found that it could have used the extra milk - so I will stick to the original recipe next time!

Used maple syrup instead of corn syrup.  If you don't like sweet, don't make this!  My husband is a sugar fanatic and LOVES this recipe.  This is a nice recipe to make on the holidays, too rich for every day but just right when you are treating yourself.

This will definitely become a staple breakfast item at our house. I took another reviewer's advice and used one less egg and 1/2 cup less milk and it wasn't soggy. I didn't add nutmeg either. Also, took make it "a little" more healthy I used butter spread instead of real butter in the caramel mixtures and it still turned out great!

This is a great recipe!  I always get rave reviews.  Please use a non stick pan though.  It comes right out of my non stick pans, but sticks to glass panns.

This recipe is the easiest for family gatherings.  I used six eggs, but I only used 3/4 cup milk.  This is important because I think it would have been soggy if I used all of the milk!  Everyone in my family said it tasted just like a cinnabon. I also substituted almond extract for vanilla extract, as another reviewer had posted.  I'll definitely make this a family tradition!

This was a great recipe - my only issue was sticking to the pan and not having enough!!!  I should have doubled the recipe.  Everyone really liked the carmel taste but the extra sauce makes that happen....

great recipe.  I use Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl bread and cut it up into small squares.  Makes eating and serving much easier.  I am now famous for this and requested by all my co-workers whenever we have a morning meeting (which is often!!)

My husband made this for Mother's Day Brunch. He left out the sauce and flipped the bake over (after cooking) so the pecans were on top. This reminded me of a sticky bun...very good. Tis was served with fresh fruit.

I made this for mother's day brunch. Everyone loved it, but here are my suggestions for others: Grease the baking dish. The bread stuck to the sides and was very hard to get out. I followed other's recommendations (doing only 1 layer and decreasing the egg/milk mixture) and found the bread was not soggy at all and could have in fact soaked up more eggs. I made the additional sauce and it was not too much, but I cut the bread thick so there was more to cover. Next time I will cut it thinner.

This is a tasty brunch french toast.  I used bakery swirled cinnamon bread and decreased the number of egg yolks by 2.  I baked for 40 minutes but would reduce that by another 5-10 minutes next time.  I also  used only one layer of bread and caramel/nut mixture (I halved the recipe).  The caramel sauce is very tasty (and very sweet)  I added 1/4 tsp. vanilla and a pinch of kosher salt to the sauce before drizzling over the toast.  Will make this again.

I tried this as the recipe is written and with some of the adjustments.  It just turned out soggy.  I think it could be great if it was written with all of the changes, but currently just turns out to be sweet soggy egg bread.  I won't try this again.

Definitely must have with the additional caramel sauce. I skipped it, and the top of the casserole was rather dry. Otherwise, very, very good.

I crunched up my pecans into tiny little pieces and only put one thin layer over the caramel.  I also sprinkled extra cinnamon over the bread mixture.  I tore the bread into bite sized pieces and it turned out beautifully.  I think it is sweet, but not too sweet.  The extra caramel sauce is a must!

This tastes great, though I only used one very thick layer, and the sauce on the bottom thickened up too much to be very gooey. It still tasted great. In the morning i drained the excess liquid and poured it back over the french toast. French toast texture was perfect.

I've been making this recipie for a while for brunch.  Be very careful not to burn the bottom of it. Also good with a sprinkling of sugar/cinnaman mixture on top before it goes in the oven instead of the added layer of carmel sauce. I also heat up the syrup in a sauce pan w/ more pecans, pour it over  right before you serve it and serve with sliced bananas around the sides of the serving platter.  The type of pan you use for this makes a huge difference as far as sticking and burning - the best luck I've had so har has been a ceramic baking dish - glass and metal has burned

This was way too sweet.  I tasted it after it came out of the oven before I put the sauce on and it was edible then.  I thought that putting caramel sauce on something could only improve it.  I was wrong.  It was too sweet to eat.  my two year old disagrees though.  She happily licked the sauce off of the top.

If making with kids...the caramel sauce can be tricky and dangerous!  Be careful and observe basic cooking rules when kids are around the stove.  Other than that warning, I only have this warning...watch out!  This stuff is killer~!  I didn't use day-old bread, which I think would have improved an already great recipe, but I will next time, and the next...lol...yum!

Made this and added pecans instead of walnuts. My husband a french toast with butter and sugar lover loved this. I served with scrambled eggs and bacon.  I even made a mistake. I only did one layer of french bread and when I put it in the oven I thought oh no I forgot the vanilla. I took it out of  the oven and squished the rest of my french bread in between the slices. I poured 3/4 cup of milk into a measuring cup added the vaniila with another half a tsp. and poured in between and over all. Then I just moved them around a little so they'd all get some vanilla  and wet from the milk mixture on the bottom. When done I  tipped it over on a plate so the sauce was on top as some suggested (great idea), and didn't make anymore sauce to serve. I t was delicious!

I’ve been making this for years and it’s evolved into my own creation! I don’t use the final syrup recipe, I make a light cream cheese frosting in the center along with some Canadian bacon. I use whatever nuts & bread  I have on hand for variation. It’s a family favorite!

I made this twice for work functions. Everyone raved about it. No left overs! 

The first time I made it, I cooked it with very thin sliced apples. It was good but I liked it better without the apples

I used maple syrup instead of the corn syrup.  I would only do 1 layer of bread,  just cut a bit thicker.

I've been making this for years! I don't have a problem with it being soggy. Instead of pouring egg mixture over, I dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture as you would for regular French toast.  Then, I stagger them in a standing/leaning rows in the pan, pour over any remaining egg and follow the rest of the directions.  I also turn it out, upside down, to serve.

I've been making this as part of our Easter Brunch for years, and it's a big favorite in our family. The best advice I can give is don't cook the caramel sauce too long in the sauce pan.  If you cook it as long as the recipe says, by the time it's done baking in the oven it will harden and then it's hard to eat. Also, I don't do a double layer of bread, just a single layer in two pans. If you do it that way though, you might want to double the caramel.

Loved this recipe. I used cinnamon apple fritter bread. So gooey and yummy. It was a hit. I cooked for 5 minutes less than what recipe called for.

We really enjoy this French Toast. It reminds me of caramel cinnamon rolls my mom used to make. (Ok, not as good, but I'm not spending all day baking, either. ) I was out of nutmeg the first time I made this, and it turned out so good that I've just never added it. I don't think I've ever had this sit before baking for more than 3 hours; and I've actually put this in the oven less than an hour after getting it assembled. Yes, it's sweet but we don't think too sweet - and we always add the caramel topping! Just yum! We enjoy this with maple flavored sausage, for some reason it seems to taste better than regular sausage, and we eat this at any time of the day!

I will definitely make this again. My family enjoyed it for Christmas brunch. It is very sweet and quite moist without adding the final caramel topping, as there is a layer of caramel in the bottom of the baking dish. Flip each portion over when serving to reveal the caramelized pecans and sweet caramel.

Very yummy.  Used a loaf of italian bread thickly sliced and placed into a 9 x 13 pan, and when we made the custard we only used 1 cup of milk, went a little short on the nutmeg and cinnamon though I don't know that we needed to do that.  Delish

Made this per the directions.  The nutmeg flavor was way too strong and I agree with another post that the topping of more caramel sauce was too much.  Going to remove this one from my saved file.

It was really good.  I didn't modify much...used challah instead and didn't do the second caramel sauce.  It came out perfect.  Not soggy or too sweet.  I think it could have been good still with the second caramel sauce, but that's all dependent on how sweet you like things.  I don't typically go for a lot of sweet for breakfast.

Absolutely scrumptious!  It made for a special treat for my daughter's 17th birthday brunch.  

I didn't change any of the ingredients.  

I did tear up the 12 slices of French bread.  

I only made caramel sauce for the bottom of the pan and, as others suggested, flipped the pan over onto a platter.  The level of sweetness was perfect.  (Of note the caramel sauce stayed soft and pliable--I was almost frightened to make it after reading some reviews of people worried their dental work would be damaged due to hard caramel!)

I'd make it again in a heartbeat.  The leftovers are good for a late-night dessert with a nip of whiskey on the side.  ;)

Everyone loved this. Only change I made was making the bread "stale" in the oven first. The egg mixture didn't cover all of the bread completely. I was worried the unsoaked pieces wouldn't be good, but that wasn't the case. Made this for thanksgiving and now making it again for Christmas. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this days in advance of a girls' trip, froze it, thawed it overnight and baked it exactly as recommended.  Everyone loved it!!!  I had sliced almonds, which I toasted and used instead of the called for pecans. This recipe would be great with any nuts you have on hand, or none at all, or add golden raisins, bananas - it's so versatile and delicious! Adding this to my rotation for sure.

I rate this recipe 4.5 stars.  Here's what I did...
Didn't soak overnight, used only the caramel sauce on the bottom, not the top, only 1 layer of bread.  Didn't refrigerate overnight, prepared it and baked it right away.  We liked it, but it is very sweet, looks like sticky cinnamon rolls when inverted.  The bread was a fresh loaf of Italian, so I didn't want it to soak overnight and become saturated completely...I think that's why some reviewers complain of "mushy" bread.  We wanted it to be sort of crispy like regular French toast.  I made essentially 1/2 of the recipe, except the caramel sauce, I used the quantities listed for that because I wanted lots of sauce.  I didn't want the problem mentioned of "rock hard" sauce stuck to the bottom of the pan as others reported.  Oh, I also sprayed the bottom and sides of the pan with cooking spray to keep it from sticking.  We liked this, but it is very sweet.  I will make it again, but not very often.

I made this and put it in the fridge before I read the reviews, so no tweaks. I used presliced french bread from the store.
After baking, it was  beautiful. The top layer of bread was a perfectly crunchy brown. I added the cararmel sauce and served it to 10 friends for brunch.  They all raved, and wanted the recipe. I have no idea what anyone did for it to come out soggy. I don't even have a real oven-just a counter top convection oven!

I looooved this. The only thing I changed was I used French bread sliced a little over an inch thick to avoid the sogginess/over sweetness others reported having. I also served it with a cream cheese/powder sugar/raspberry filling for somewhat of a stuffed French toast thing. It was like heaven.

Definitely forget about the extra sauce. We've made a recipe like this many times, but the pecans were a great addition. I cut my french bread one inch thick and filled in any gaps. Texture was perfect.

I made this without the extra caramel sauce. It was delicious. It would have been extra yummy with more sauce, but probably not needed. My husband would have preferred only one layer of bread but I liked it fine with two.

Both my husband and I were disappointed in this recipe.   The bottom layer of bread was too mushy, and the top was too hard, so much that it was inedible.   I followed this recipe to a T, so I don't know what went wrong.  I will not be making this again.

Very sweet but good with eggs and sausage to calm down all the sweet.  I think next time I'll use 6 slices of thicker bread instead of 12 slices of thin bread.  It was a little bit soggy, but not bad.

I had a brunch party with abt 20 ppl and this was a great dish to make! The only thing I changed was the amt of egg/milk mixture I poured in the pan. I individually poured the mixture over each toast just enough to get the top layers saturated and some around the bottom. In other words I did not use the whole entire mixture because I was afraid of the toast being mushi(I've read in other reviews online). So other than that it was great! I didn’t even need to add syrup to the finish product because the caramel mixture is sweet! Thnxs for the recipe!

This was a great recipe. This is the first recipe I have every rated after making many, many recipes from this website. I made this for my mother for a Mother's Day Brunch. I did have to make a few changes because I was only making this for myself, my mother and my daughter. I decreased the serving size and I didn't have to layer it because the pan I used was not deep enough. I used 4 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk. I also didn't make extra caramel sauce at the end. I followed another reviewer that said it wasn't needed. Overall the recipe was a hit. It's more like a sticky bun from the gooey caramel on the bottom with a breading pudding texture. None the less it was great. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

The first time I made this was in school. I did not care for this recipe. It is soggy, the fake caramel sauce is too sweet and it sticks to the bottom of the pan. I will never ever be making this recipie again.

This was a great recipe!  I took other's suggestions and cut the milk in 1/2.  I kept the same number of eggs.  It was sweet, but was approved by all at the housewarming party I went to.  I will definitely make it again!

Yummy recipe! I think I grated a little too much nutmeg in it though so will lessen it next time, I also used almonds instead of pecans, turned out fantastic! The sauce was just the right amount IMO. Will definitely be making this again.

I thought this would really be good but it was very, very sweet--and I don't mind sweet!  As suggested in other reviews, I would definitely not put any additional sauce over it before serving--it really doesn't need it.  All in all, this would be best served in small portions along with something else, like the original poster says she does.

This recipe is amazing and delicious.  It has a praline-like taste with the caramel and pecans.  My family and I prepare this on Christmas Eve and pop it into the oven Christmas morning.

This was yummy! It got rave reviews! I did not make the extra sauce based on other reviews and did not feel like it needed it.  I cut the french bread into cubes and mixed it with the egg mixture before putting it in the pan. It came out so good - would definitely recommend and will make again!

Very easy and great for Sunday brunch! I used leftover hamburger buns and broke them into pieces. It turned out great. I even left out the extra caramel sauce, and it was plenty sweet. Would definitely make again.

After reading the reviews I had really high expectations for this recipe and I was very disappointed. It came out soggy with a taste that I can say was very unpleasant. The only way I was able to finish the meal was because the Carmel sauce covered up the real flavor of the food. My stomach became very upset after making this one; needless to say we will never make this one again.

After reading all the reviews I went ahead and tried this pretty much as it was. I did use a larger pan (10X13in) and my husband wondered if it couldn't be single layered.If we do single layer it, I will have to make more egg mixture to go over it because it was just the right amount in the bigger pan. Baking it for the full 40-45 minutes and using large day old french bread was just the tips I needed. Also we never ever used the sauce,(but I loved it like candy and my grandchildren loved it too) Also added extra pecans because my husband always say "you can never have to many nuts". Great for company, and easy to have done the night before!

This is a keeper.  Fancy enough for company but easy enough for regular use at home.
