Really great recipe for families with picky kids.  I've also tried substituting sour cream for the half and half; thickens up the sauce nicely.

It was good I had to make more marinade than suggested because it was not enough for all the chicken. Next time I will ease on the honey and add jalapeno peppers for a spicy taste the chilli powder didn't quite do it.

These were so delicious! A new family favorite! We've made them hree times now and learned something new each time. Be sure to marinade the cooked chicken at least overnight. Big difference! Bake them covered for the first half of the time. I like when they get a little crispy on top. Yummy!

I made this using shredded pork instead of chicken(cooked a pork loin in the crockpot for about 5 hours then shredded). I doubled the marinade recipe and left out the half and half. Served it topped with sour cream and fresh cilantro with mexican rice on the side. The meat alone was so delicious and my husband raved about it. Best of all my 5 picky kids all loved it which is a rare thing for any dish! This is a definite keeper for us!

Very good. You can double the marinade and add two cups of cooked rice to make this go much farther. Kids loved it.

I did not care for this dish at all. The honey and lime are very strong and take away from the enchilada-ness of it I think. It was very time-intensive and we were very disappointed. Maybe we just weren't prepared for how strong it would be.

Interesting and different to try but hubby and I both agreed this wasn't a keeper. Tasty but not something I'd make again. A bit too sweet probably would be better to reduce honey to 1/4 cup. Enchilada sauce to pour on top was thin so I didn't add the half-and-half; I think adding sour cream instead would be better to thicken it up a bit.

Given that my husband and I don't typically like enchiladas this recipe gets 5 stars for producing something we both genuinely enjoyed! However I don't get the point of cooking chicken separately and then marinating it - I used my slow cooker to cook my chicken breasts IN the marinade and it turned out great. Only took about three hours on HIGH and the chicken was falling apart on its own and saturated in flavor. There was still some honey/lime juice left in the slow cooker to add to the enchilada sauce. I also put a dollop of sour cream in both the chicken mixture and the sauce on top and used about half the cheese called for a mexican blend and some sharp cheddar. Served on a bed of lettuce - tasty!

This is a great recipe! My husband loved it. I used a whole grain tortilla and reduced fat cheese to try to make it just a little healthier and it didn't seem that we sacrificed anything as far as the taste was concerned.

Even though making enchiladas is always a messy task these were excellent! I used a mixture of half cheddar cheese and half monterey jack cheese. I agree in making extra marinade for the chicken and I marinaded it overnight.

This recipe is similar to one a coworker shared with me. The honey lime and verde sauce makes this dish so unique. I agree with others that I would double my marinade... it's just too good for such a small amount.

I only used 2 cups of cheese and ended up with the most flavorful tortillas (used only five shells). Otherwise marinade was amazing and sauce was just right!

We had these at a friend's house and two days later I was on here looking for a recipe. Turns out these weren't exactly the same but oh my were they worth the effort in making them! I doubled the marinade and let the meat soak for a couple of hours. Used medium enchilada sauce cheddar cheese and sour cream instead of half and half. Served with sour cream. As an afterthought we're a little sensitive to acidic foods and strong flavors so this was a little on the warm side for us. I'm definitely making it again but probably will use mild enchilada sauce next time. DELICIOUS dish!

Good! Will make again and maybe add some other touches such as rice beans and/or onions. I put the chicken in the food processor rather than shredding it which caused the chicken to soak up all the marniade I was worried but it turned out good. I would suggest more green enchilada sauce than what the recipe calls for.

These were very good and we enjoyed the sweet with the lime. Six cups of cheese seemed excessive even to a cheese lover like me so we used 2 cups mixed in with the chicken and 2 cups on top. We also only used 1 cup of enchilada sauce and there was plenty of sauce. Very nice recipe!

Great dish! I did substitute half of the fat free half and half with light sour cream and I think it did thicken up the sauce a bit which was tasty. I recommend adding a small can of green chilis to the chicken and cheese mixture before rolling them up in the tortillas. If you like a little extra spice add some jalapeno slices to the top before baking in the oven.

this is soooo good! i didn't feel like messing with chicken so instead i put a can of black beans and can of pinto beans in the sauce (doubled it as others suggested) then layered all the ingredients in a casserole dish and also threw in 2 bags worth of boil-in-a-bag rice (without cooking it first). baked it up and it was awesome rice cooked perfectly and the taste is AMAZING!!!

Very very rich. I liked the unique flavor of this dish not the typical enchilada but after eating two I concluded it was very rich could barely get the last bite down. I doubled the marinade as suggested but only marinated about 45 mins. I could have used a little deeper dish as there was quite a lot of sauce to pour over the enchiladas. Maybe the next time I would throw some black olives in with the chicken and cilantro but all in all a very tasty rich dish. I would make it again. FYI - the recipe calls for Monterey Jack but mentions cheddar in the instructions. I used both. I also used the half and half and the sauce thickened quite well.

I didn't waiver from the recipe too much except I used chicken sausage instead of shredded chicken (I like the texture better) and it was still very good. I didn't find the honey too sweet or the lime juice to powerful. I used a blend of cheddar and Monterrey jack cheese to top the enchiladas. I don't personally think it needs anything like guacamole or sour cream on top. I would make it again:)

Will make over and over! My husband who hates Mexican found this recipe amazing and went back for seconds. I ended up marinating overnight which helped the honey flavor really come through.

Whole family loves this (includes 3 teenagers). As others suggested I reduced honey to 1/4 c and substituted half and half for 1 c of plain yogurt. Ended sprinkling cumin on top and would add it to the sauce next time. Great "base" recipe!

I made it exactly as it is directed. It didn't specify what chicken but I used rotisserie chicken and it was easy and delicious. My 1.5 year old husband and brother in law decimated the plate.:) This is sweet with a very very mild spice. I'm sure you can add more if you like but it was great!

If allrecipes allowed I'd rate this 0 stars. I don't know if I let the chicken marinate too long (about 1-1.5 hours) but the filling was way too sweet and these enchiladas were inedible even using less honey than recommended. Neither my husband nor I could eat them.

My picky teens loved these. My husband and I liked them a lot but next time I won't use as much honey. It was a bit overpowering for us. I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic. I only used 3 C of cheese but definitely could've used another cup or so...go with the 6 C. It's a keeper though. I'll definitely make it again.

My family & I love this recipe! I like that it is different from regualr enchiladas. And the sweet/spicy combo is yummy. I found that we like it best when marinated for at least 2 hours. Serve with a dollop of sour cream on top & a side salad. Delicious!

I LOVED THIS! I changed a few things though. I'm not a big fan of the green sauce so I did red enchilada sauce instead. I marinated my chicken for 6 hours and it shredded up nicely super great flavor. I also got rice-a-roni chicken flavored rice and rolled that up in the chicken. I used sour cream instead of half and half and it really added a great top layer. highly recommend super easy recipe!

This is my first time reviewing a recipe even though I have used allrecipes for years. I LOVED these enchiladas! Unfortunately I was the only one in my family of 6 who loved them. Don't let that deter you from making them though. They are sweet yes but the flavors of lime honey garlic and chili powder really meld well together and I found them to be very very yummy! I used homemade flour tortillas subbed full fat sour cream for the half and half and used a little less honey. A very interesting and different recipe!

My husband says these are the best enchiladas he has ever tasted! I used sour cream instead of half and half and pepper jack cheece instead of Monterey Jack (the cheese substitution was purely a reading error on my part:) but gave the enchiladas a real kick. Yummy indeed!!

Tried this recipe for the first time it came out fantastic! Couldn't ask for a better honey lime enchilada recipe. The filling was sweet but savory at the time almost similar to a really tangy delicious BBQ. The lime made the entire dish very refreshing. I live with my partner and we finished half the dish in one day! One request I would reccomended is to add the zest of two limes into the chicken marinade and what refreshing mouth feel it makes! A definite pleaser! Thank you Kellycena for the recipe 5 stars without a doubt!

I took inspiration from this dish and wanted to use what I had in stock: mango cilantro lime cream cheese sweet pineapple sausage chicken. I used taco seasoning chili powder and garlic. I cooked the ingredients over low heat to blend all the flavors and rehydrate the chicken. Let it simmer until thick then wrapped in flour tortillas and used green sauce and into the oven! Delicious.

This recipe was surprisingly good. I thought the combination of lime and honey would be weird but it wasnt. I thought the leftovers I had the next day were better than the night before so next time I will probably let the chicken marinate for longer; probably over night.

I LOVE this recipe. I can't get green enchilada sauce at my store so I just grab some green salsa and run it through the blender. This may give it more of a kick as opposed to the green enchilada sauce. Either way this dish is incredibly delicious! Thank you so much for sharing. =)

kids love it; leftovers as good as original; use corn tortillas not flour no need to roll just make like lasagne; and omit the salt.

We love these at our house! I do put some chopped jalapeño in the marinade and I also do double the marinade. I have done half and half (not fat free) in the enchilada sauce and have also tried it with the sour cream good both ways.

Honey lime enchilada is a family hit! Even my finicky husband and grandkids went back for seconds. After reading some of the comments I decided to make extra sauce. I doubled the green chili sauce and all the marinating ingredients.

YUM! The best honey-lime enchilada recipe I've seen- a great proportion of flavors to each other. I made mine ahead and let them 'soak' in the mixture you pour over for a while... then I baked covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for an additional 20 minutes- they were p.e.r.f.e.c.t!

Great out of the oven but better as leftovers.
