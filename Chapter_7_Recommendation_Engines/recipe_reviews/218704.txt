I have to say this was one darn good pie.  Everyone loved it.  However, the only down side was the Meringue, which is why it got 4.5 stars instead of 5.  Next time I would use 4 egg whites for the Meringue. Other than that wouldn't change anything with this recipe.

I made this pie and it probably would have been amazing; however, the pot I used reacted with the lemon juice and caused the filling to have a metallic taste. (Common reaction according to research) I had to throw the whole pie out! I would recommend a glass pot (Pyrex) to make this pie. I used stainless (do not use copper either) and it was awful.

this is delicious! i love lemon meringue pie but had never figured out how tho make it before. i was about to make it and realized that i didn't have a lemon. so i used lemon juice in place of the lemon peal. (1tbs lemon juice=1/2 tbs lemon peal) which would be 2 tbs of lemon juice.

FANTASTIC!  We absolutely loved this pie!  It was easy to make; the hardest part was waiting the 3 hours for it to chill.  Next time, I will increase the meringue, (although it is not necessary), so I can have a "higher" pie.  Thank you Argo for such a FANTASTIC recipe!

I love this recipe-I make and use the filling for cakes, cream puffs, cupcakes and donuts. By adding gelatin the filling can be molded for more dessert applications.

Excellent pie.  I added 1/4 tsp of Cream of Tartar to my egg whites.  I live in a humid environment and the Cream of Tartar stabilizes the meringue and keeps it from going soft.

I had no problem with this recipe. I had successfully made a lemon meringue pie 28 years ago and so I was a little concerned when I read about falling wet meringue and runny lemon filling, but this recipe came out great. I did take the meringue outside to cool it down though before I whipped the meringue. No problem with the meringue baking on top. I also didn't put it in the fridge before eating because I donâ€™t like cold pie. It was wonderful!

This pie has a lovely, delicate flavor and a light texture.  I made the meringue by adding 1/4. tsp of cream of tartar, and this was my only deviation from the recipe and instructions.  Usually, I allow the pie to cool before I add the meringue, and I brown it by using the broiler for a few seconds (you must watch like a hawk).  The meringue wept and didn't want to adhere to the pie once it was cut, and I think the cooking and cooling directions are the culprits here.

I had my doubts about this one. I was pleasantly surprised! I did not have a lemon so I used lime. This was actually really good. The only thing I would change is not putting in the lime peel. I would just use the juice. Very Good recipe.

This pie was awesome. I have never made Lemon Meringue before as I do not like it but I tried this one and it was awesome. My 68 yr old father in law was very impressed! He is hard to please.

This recipe is perfect as it is!! I've tried with dried lemon zest and bottled lemon juice and it was good... then I tried it with a real lemon and it was GREAT!! Either way, it's the best I've found so far..

For starters: anyone who makes this pie may want to use an extra egg for the meringue. It is exceptionally flat but that could also be because I ferociously hand-mixed it, sans the hand mixer. I'm not worried so much about it being flat but I would prefer more meringue. In regards to its taste, this recipe did not turn out how I expected it to.

I followed the directions almost perfectly however I am not impressed with the amount of meringue, the fact that I cooked it until it was golden and half of the pie is solid but the other appears to be jiggly/liquidy and the pie doesn't have the right texture. It is almost rubbery. Three stars!

This recipe has been approved by my father (who gets mad if we show up without it :) ). I had no grated lemon peel, so I just omitted it. It still turned out awesome. It's as easy as the boxed stuff, but taste much better.

Everyone raved at how delicious this was! Once the baking was done I turned off the oven but left the pie in so the top of the meringue got toasty brown and crusty but the inside was still fluffy. So good! Thank you.

While this is the very first lemon meringue pie I've ever made and it turned out beautifully, it really wasn't the taste of a lemon meringue pie that I am used to.  I doubt if I'll make it again.

MMMMMMMM!!  the only thing i did was add another egg and a 1/2 tsp vanlla to merangue.  Next time i will do 6 eggs for a higher merangue.  Since i raise my own chickens, that's easy.  Love it.  It went into the precious recipe box.  Thanks!
