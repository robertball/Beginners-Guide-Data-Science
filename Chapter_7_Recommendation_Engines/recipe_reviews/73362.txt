I don't eat baked beans myself so I had to let hubby be the sole judge on this one. He found it to be incredibly bland and asked me not to waste the ingredients on this one again. He much prefers Baked Beans III from this site.

I love this recipe.  I made it recently for a tailgate party and everyone loved them.  Very easy to put together and smells great while cooking.

This wasn't my favorite baked beans recipe.  Baked beans are already kind of sweet, and the cola and brown sugar just overdid it for us.  It also didn't seem very flavorful to me, so I tried adding sauteed onions, but it still wasn't that great.  It was fun to try out cooking with cola, though!

These baked beans get rave reviews every time I make them.  It's so easy to put together.  We're making them again for New Years Eve.  Happy New Year everyone!

The beans turned out really good, however they weren't much different than most canned baked beans.  The cola seemed to make no difference.  I don't know if I would make these again.

I am absolutely hooked on the taste that the cola gives these beans! I've tried them with Original Baked Beans and BBQ Baked Beans and the Original was better. Made them with BBQ Beef Sandwiches and loved dipping them in the sweet sauce! The best!

These were okay. I think giving them a 5 star rating is way overboard, as they really were nothing special. In my opinion, they taste just like some of the pricer baked beans out of the can. For the prepwork that I put into them, I would rather have just bought a few of those canned beans, heated them up and served them.

The recipe was a little different, but didn't have that wow factor for me with this recipe. Can't say that I'm make again as written. To much brown sugar in it, but was also very soupy like.

Liked these a lot but they ended up being a tad too sweet -- I used Cherry Coke (all that I had). Very easy to prepare. Went well with BBQ sandwiches.

I feel like I have to stick up for this recipe-- because it really can be a 5 star recipe!!
*PLEASE use a GOOD QUALITY CANNED BEAN-- I get fantastic results when I use Bush's Baked Beans (I like the Boston Recipe)... I have used cheaper baked beans with sub-par results.
*COOK THE BACON before adding it to the slow cooker. I cook it until just before it's crispy.
*My family enjoys the addition of CHOPPED onion. I usually use between a half to one whole onion.
*LAYER the recipe, like a lasagna; beans, sugar, bacon, Coke, onions (if you add them) over THREE to FOUR Layers. I don't know exactly what this does, but I have also just added all ingredients to the crock pot in no particular order, and haven't had as good results.
Also-- it's a bit liquidy first day-- better on day 2, or after it has completely cooled (thickens with cooling).
Hope this helps everyone! :)

I made these for Easter dinner & followed the directions exactly. I'm sorry but I wouldn't waste my time making these again. They tasted no different than beans you can buy in a can.

We loved this!  The cola gave the beans such a great, almost smokey, flavor.  Thanks for giving me a new way to prepare an old standard.

I made this dish and everyone liked it.  The only thing I changed was the amount of brown sugar added. Because you get sugar from the cola as well.  I also added a litter butter.  
Overall , it's a great dish and I plan on serving it at our next BBQ.

These were pretty good from the get go, but I did make a few change, which everyone thought was amaZING. First instead of baked beans use garbanzo beans. They give it a nice richer, fuller consistency than the baked bean do. Next, ditch the cola and go straight for the 7up (or Sprite, but 7up is better). This gave it that subtle hint of lime that is sure to spark interest at the barbecue. Other than that just follow the recipe and prepare for a taste bud experience.

I didn't bake it long enough to thicken it up, or didn't drain the beans enough, so it was still runny.

Don't expect thick baked beans.  Left overnight and came downstairs excited to see the result.  Instead I found soupy mushy beans with not as much flavor as I had hoped.

You can buy any good canned baked beans and just add homemade cola BBQ sauce and get the same results.  Cooking for the time recommended would just give you mushy bean soup.

I really did not find that the pop added to much more flavor.  I could just have put a few cans of baked beans in a crock pot and called it good.

They were better than canned stuff, but nothing extraordinary.

Tastewise, the recipe lives up to the raves recorded about it.  But I would call it "fake baked beans."  It is not much more trouble to make the real thing, and that does not require adding a whole cup of sugar!

I added some minced onion, otherwise followed the recipe. It was a hit!

I'm 90 years old so I make 100's of variations off the top of my heard--just used some coke this time and see no reason to do it.  I add catsup, onions, mustard, Worcestershire and whatever canned beans I have add to it.  Not brain surgery.

I made as directed using quality products and half cooked bacon ahead as well.  I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I used the oven method (I also used a real Coke).   Worst beans I have ever had... sorry!    Though the beans were submerged in the sauce, the were dried out and my teeth hurt from the sugar level.  4 out of 5 at the table agreed...

What could be easier?  I prepared in a crock pot exactly as directed and used 3 different  kind of beans for variety.  Great dish to take to a pitch-in.  Easy does it 4 ingredients.  Who could ask for more?

I made these, as the recipe is very similar to a Coke chicken recipe we love. Very soupy, despite draining my beans and reducing the soda to 9 oz. Will definitely add some ketchup or BBQ sauce and Worcestershire sauce next time for more zip and to lessen the sweetness. Let me say, the beans were much, much tastier the second day. I will definitely make again and will probably put together the ingredients the day before baking.

This is great. I substituted Root Beer (A&W) instead of the cola.....just for variation! It was fantastic. It has now become a requested side dish!. Thanks!

Just put some bar b q sauce in your beans, cook them on the stove and be finished with it.   It's easier, faster, and cheaper.

Disappointed in this recipe. Cooked on high in the crockpot for 4 hours. Was VERY soupy with little flavor and I had even added pepper and onion flakes to it. Won't make again.

I am not a bean connoisseur, so I can't say that this recipe is necessarily better than any other.  I will say that my whole family gave it great reviews and that it was easy to make.  We ate it for the fourth of July, and the Coke in the recipe made it seem even more American than other baked bean recipes.

These were good, but no better, no worse than any other recipe made from canned baked beans.  Will make again though.

I agree with the reviewer who said you could just open up fancier canned beans and get the same effect.  No cola flavor.  The plus here is being able to make them in the slow cooker.  The flavor wasn't bad, it just wasn't special.

Great base for any BBQ/Tailgate. As Marlowes Mum said however - a wee bit bland...added a teaspoon of smoked paprika, a couple of garlic fried onions, chillies and diced chorizo and took it to a whole new level, great breakfast/brunch accompaniment too ! 
No need to cook for so long, if you don't have a slow cooker, use a heavy bottom pan, fry the onions, chorizo, bacon until browned and then add the rest, place a lid on and simmer for an hour until the beans break down and thicken the sauce.... great topping for hot dogs too!
