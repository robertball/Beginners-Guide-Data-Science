Wow, what a poor little beat-up recipe! Check out these reviews. One person hated the idea that it calls for food coloring. Huh. One person thinks that it tastes - impossibly, look at the ingredients - like *flour*. Another person is obviously bored and wants to insult someone. A couple people think it's not sweet enough - okay, I might buy that. I made this exactly as written this morning. A perfectly decent strawberry-banana smoothie, a little heavy on the cinnamon (which I thought was interesting rather than offensive). My fruit was quite ripe, so the sweetness was perfect for me. Mine is just another opinion. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm sorry but the minute I read that the recipe called for food coloring I had to say something. A smoothie is a drink made with fruit so don't go and mess it up with something like that.

If I could give this recipe a lower star rating I would.   I love the strawberry-banana flavors together, but with a recipe like this, I think this person should be banned from any kitchen anywhere.

My daughter made this because she was craving a smoothie and it was easy to make.  She said it tasted like flour.  We had to add more strawberries and some vanilla extract to even make it drinkable.  Sorry, not a good one for us.

This was great! I added extra strawberries and some orange juice. That gave it a little extra flavor. I wanted it to be thicker so I added ice. I highly recommend it.

This is a fine smoothie recipe.  I was scared of the cinnamon, so I skipped that and added a little OJ, but this is a quite normal recipe for a smoothie.  I made it after a workout and enjoyed it.  I don't often review recipes, but this one has gotten a lot of unfair 1-stars.  If you feel the need to add whipped cream, ice cream and sugar, I suggest you search for milkshake next time, not smoothie.

I made this smoothie twice; the first time, I did it exactly like the recipe said and it wasn't creamy enough. The cinnamon made it taste weird. The next time I left out the cinnamon, and added some vanilla ice cream, cool whip, and sugar and still didn't taste right.

An OK smoothie, I left out the cinnamon. Added a a couple spoonfulls vanilla yogurt to "smooth" it out a little more.  Made it again and added some  kiwi nom nom...  I think that the bananas need to be very ripe, no green on the peel and not so ripe that it is mushy.  A less ripe banana will have a different consistency.  As for the food coloring???  If you are serving to a child, they may enjoy the appearence of a darker pink drink - happy smoothie making ;)

It was okay. I had to alter the recipe a lot! For example, I added 1/3 cup sugar, put in more strawberries, skipped the cinnamon and put in half a tablespoon of cocoa (you couldn't taste it, it only added a darker color), and put in a LOT of ice. It came out good.

The food coloring is optional.  Don't put it in if you don't want it.  I'm not a big milk fan, so I just splashed in whatever I felt like, and although I love cinnamon, I just did the same with that.  I prefer yogurt smoothies, but I think it's my preference for yogurt overall anyway.  My fruit was a bit underripe, so needed a tad sugar to sweeten it up but I'm not concerned about that so much.  If I'd have been patient, it would've certainly been sweet enough on it's own.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe, since it has no sweetener, needs really good fruit. My strawberries are good & sweet so I didn't need it. I've been reading about the health benefits of cinnamon, but a full tsp was a bit too much for me, you can feel the grit from it. Also, I only used about 1/2c of milk, I can't imagine using the full cup since this recipe doesn't call for ice to thicken it. Mine was too milky with the amount I used.

I find this a starting point more than anything.  To make it more healthy I added 1 cup of Strawberry Yogurt, cut out the cinnamon and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup of Splenda and then added two cups of ice cubes before blending to thicken it. Then it was a great smoothie and, since I drink them as a meal supplement because of swallowing problems, this offers much more nutritionally than the original recipe

Used fresh strawberries and a banana. I didn't care for the addition of cinnamon, but hey, you win some and you lose some.

Everyone knows that strawberry and banana in a blender with milk comes out great every time! The drop of food coloring gives it a beautiful strawberry color, making it more appealing to guests and kids.

I omitted the food coloring, used only 1/2 the cinnamon called for, added 2 packets of Splenda, and used frozen whole strawberries hoping for a thicker smoothie (but not getting it).  I didn't care for the flavor of the cinnamon at all.

I love this recipe. I don't understand why people don't like it. Sometimes people want to add food coloring to make it a little bit more fun, for some odd unknown reason colors that are not found in nature are more interesting. This recipe is perfect.

This was  a good smoothie for when you are out of yogurt. I did cut back on the milk a bit to keep it from getting too runny. I also cut the cinnamon in half since I use a very strong variety. I'm not totally sure what is up with the reviews but this is a smoothie that is worth making and trying.

This is how my son makes his smoothies too!  It really is all good for you.  Just dont use the food coloring.  Honestly if your fruit is not ripe from the beginnning it will not be very sweet. This is a smoothy in the most natural form.  Not everyone likes yogurt or ice cream in a smoothie.  Just makes it more fatening.

Used a frozen banana, just a dash of cinnamon and no food coloring.  My daughter loved this, as she's going through a phase of not liking yogurt in her smoothies.  If my strawberries aren't sweet, I add just a teaspoon of honey.  Very refreshing!

The ground cinnamon was over bearing, I don't think you need as much.  I do plan on making it without the cinnamon, my kids thought the cinnamon was to much as well.

The cinnamon was subtle as long as I kept it stirred while drinking it, but I think cutting it back would be better.  From a thickness point of view, I thought that amount of milk was fine.  However, it might also be what kills the flavor.  It could use more strawberries and some sweetener of some sort.  After reading the reviews (and deciding to give it a shot anyway) I purposely used a VERY ripe banana, and frozen strawberries which are sweeter than the 'fresh' we get around here, plus that helped make it colder.  But still - just didn't think it was very good, I had to add some honey to make it drinkable, and even then did not finish it.  Despite the ingredients, I do understand why a couple of people thought it tasted like flour/dough.  Obviously, a lot of people have not liked this, but still, I can't comprehend leaving a bad score because of optional food coloring (which I didn't use) when you didn't even make it! and I also have to assume the person who submitted it likes it - I mean duh!  So maybe some of us don't like it, but the submitter is welcome to stay in the afore-mentioned kitchen.

Quick and easy but not as sweet as I would like.  I added about 3T. sugar.  I did like the use of cinnamon though.

It wasnt bad like some people here say but I thought it was flavorless. I added 5 more strawberries then the recipe asked for, some "daily protein & fibre" (a fruity drink mix, great for when your going to be active all day) and 2 tablespoons of sugar (for 2 servings). I found this gave the smoothie more flavor and tastes delicious.

I added a single serve cup of passion fruit yogurt and omitted the cinnamon and food coloring.  Awesome taste and amazingly filling!

I think you should add a little less cinnamon, maybe a half or fourth teaspoon.

Yum! This recipe is a healthy breakfast for when your on the go.
However, I disliked that the recipe said it needed food coloring, It is not natural and takes away from all of the healthy ingredients. I did not put in any food  coloring and the smoothie  could have been a little bit sweeter and could've had a little less cinnamon.

The smoothie was great and the cinnamon just adds that extra goodness for your body as cinnamon is a great spice  to help make bowel movements "move" Great idea on that since I'm drinking the smoothie for health benefits and to cure that sweet craving. Thanks

I thought this was very easy and quick.  My 7 and 9 year old daughters said it was very good and thought it was awesome.  I as well thought it was great.  The only thing i changed was 3 teaspoons of sugar for sweetness.  I did not add cinamon or food coloring as i did not have those.  I doubled the recipe and it served 3 of us plenty.  As for the negative reviews those people probally are just unhappy and have nothing better to do than bring others down.  Great job great smoothie thanks for sharing

I froze my fruit to make thicker. If your fruit isn't perfectly ripe add alittle sugar. Finally, I suggest to add cinnamon in small increments to your personal taste. Tried it without the cinnamon as well and missed it. My family loved this.

I used more strawberries when I made it and it was still a little bland. Maybe it could use some honey or sugar to sweeten it or give it seem flavor. Just a suggestion. It was very refreshing otherwise :)

I used cinnamon sugar instead of cinnamon as I thought that amount of cinnamon was far too high. My cinnamon sugar is 1 tsp of cinnamon to 3 tbsp of sugar and I used 1 tsp of this mixture and it still has too much cinnamon flavor.

I hate to give this the rating what i did cuz I really was hoping it was gonna be better. The taste isn't very good. The cinnamon w/the foamy milk&banana did not go well
