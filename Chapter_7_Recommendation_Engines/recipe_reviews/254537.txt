Super easy recipe and tasty. This works for a low carb diet, a regular diet, snack, breakfast, side dish. Could be eaten like a real pancake with maple syrup. I always have frozen spinach and eggs on hand. I'm going to make this all the time!

Spinach Pancake  Haiku: "Gotta serve with ham, Dr. Seuss-style for kids, (or the young at heart!)" What an easy and delicious side dish, bright and healthy. My only swap was sweet onion (around 1/3 c. finely-chopped) vs. scallions. I followed the recipe as written and only found slight difficulty in loosening and flipping the egg/pancake out of the pan; am thinking that a quick broil in the oven with Parmesan would rock this to 10 stars, but we loved it just the way that it is.
