I was making ribs and realized I didn't have any BBQ sauce.  I picked this one out because it looked tasty, and it didn't let me down.  My husband was shocked that I made it myself, and I have to say, I like it better than bottled sauce.  Finger licking good! (we used it on pork ribs)

This was really really good! BUT, if you're looking for the genuine "BBQ" flavor- this isn't really that- but me and my hubby LOVED it. Tastes so good on out hamburgers. It's a definate keeper! (didn't have a lemon, so I used 1 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice.) Oh and I used 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of powder as I LOVE garlic.

Really good.  My husband couldn't tell it didn't come out of a bottle.  This was a super easy recipe that was great because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I will keep in mind for the next time I want bbqed chicken.

Loved it!  I was looking for something with the ingredients I had, and this was it!  I doubled the recipe as follows:  1/2 c. apple cider vinegar, 1 cup ketchup, 3/4 c. water, 1/2 c. brown sugar, sprinkle of Lawry's seasoning, a couple dashes of worcestersire sauce, and... I sauteed a 1/4 of a small onion (chopped fine)and 1 chopped garlic clove and tossed it all in the bowl at the same time.  I did make a couple of squirts of ketchup to make a thicker consistency.  After all that....I had some boneless pork ribs, tossed them in the crockpot and put the BBQ mixture over the top.  Stirred together and cooked about 4 hrs. on high, then turned to low until we were ready for dinner.  When we were ready to eat, I took a large slotted spoon and separated the pork.  I then ladled it onto good hamburger buns and even the kids ate all their dinner!  I think next time I will use the Hawaiian buns.  Overall, YUMMY!! (even hubby said so and he doesn't say things too often!)

This was good; we used it for our 4th of July BBQ... I added a tsp. of liquid smoke and a touch of cayenne for spice!  Kept the chicken moist, thanks! :)

It was a good recipe to use in a pinch, as all ingredients are usually easily accessible. It kept the meat tender. Next time I will add more fresh garlic and smoke flavour and maybe 1Tbsp whiskey! You won't go wrong with this recipe.

If you're using this as a replacement for bottled BBQ sauce, you're going to be disappointed.  However, if you're using this for a meat baster or IN something calling for BBQ sauce, it imparts nice flavor.  I used this in "Slow Cooker Baked Beans" by wannabe chefette on this site and it was a PERFECT addition to that recipe, in lieu of bottled BBQ sauce.  THANKS for the recipe, Dave G!

I would more consider this as a sauce for shrimp cocktail - not a bbq sauce.  As a seafood sauce - I'd give this 5 stars.

This was amazing! I thought it would be too ketchupy, but it was fantastic, and got better the longer it sat. I used smoked salt in place of the soy sauce and microplaned in the onion (I eyeballed it) and one clove of garlic for 1/4 of the recipe. I didn't have fresh lemons so I used lemon juice. 

Thanks so much, Dave!!

Great basic recipe, I kicked it up a couple notches by adding a couple tablespoons of mustard, teaspoon or 2 minced garlic, teaspoon of chili powder, and about 1/3 cup of dark beer. It was a little overpowering for a dipping sauce but when cooked over ribs was incredible!!!

Very good base recipe!  Kids wanted hot dogs and had no BBQ sauce.  Well this hit the spot fine.  Did not have onions so used minced onions after tasted it was a little too ketchupy so doubled the Worcestershire, soy and hot pepper sauce and added .5 TSP of hot paprika.  Came out pretty good my kids loved it although a little spicy, but they like it spicy like me.

Thank you! No BBQ sauce and the stores are all closed because it's Christmas. I had everything in the pantry. Just enough kick and we added a little honey. Love it, we won't buy BBQ sauce again!

Perfect recipe to start your "base".  The only thing I omitted was the onion and lemon simply because I was out. Ground mustard, onion powder and "Jersey Death sauce" gave it the perfect kick!

I made this because I had run out of my bottled sauce...and I will never buy bottled sauce again.  My family loved it and even my little 6 year old that doesn't like meat loved it on country style pork ribs.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious!  I have searched high and low for a good recipe with Whiskey and this is definitely a keeper!  I added a little bit more liquid smoke for our taste and it was awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!  Will use again and again!

I made mostly as directed,  I didn't measure anything other than eyeball, .  I've made this many times and it's always a hit.

Most bbq sauces do use the same. Ingredients that are in ketchup,  that is not a "bad thing".  It saves a lot of time! adjust heat and sweet to your taste.

The recipe is great; you just have to cook it for about an hour on low heat. I swapped soy sauce for all natural liquid smoke. I used yellow mustard for flavor and tang rather than the lemon juice, and i used onion powder instead of fresh onions.

I took this bbq sauce, added a bit more chilli sauce as I like more zing. I cooked it off and liquidised it whilst it was still hot. I marinated on some pork ribs overnight and put it on the BBQ. Would thoroughly recommend anyone to try this as there is great taste and just enough zing to it.

While I usually use this sauce recipe, tonight I made a BBQ chicken recipe that had its own sauce version, so I thought I would give it a try. NEVER AGAIN!  I will be loyal do Dave and his BBQ sauce from now on!!  Great Recipe, THANKS!

It was great but I also kicked it up like a member did with liquid smoke and pepper flakes.

This is pretty similar to the bbqsauce I make,  but I highly recommed use canned tomato sauce instead of ketsup, after all ketchup is tomato sauce sugar and viniger. Apple cider viniger works even better. Also a shot of burbon for the sauce works well, one for the cook works well to:-).
Add liquid smoke to taste, but If you get heartburn as I do going lightly on anything smokey helps. Try some Dales's Seasoning instead.

I used this recipe to go along with the Zesty Slow Cooker BBQ Chicken and it really did help make the dish fabulous!  I didn't have bbq sauce on hand so I tried this recipe because I had all of the ingredients in my cabinets!  I did substitute minced onion for the chopped onion and I added a TB of yellow mustard, but other than that, this recipe will be used in the future!  Tasted wonderful.  Thanks, Dave!

I found this to be the best base for a great BBQ sauce ever! I used it to beef up bottled sauce by adding to it. I omitted the hot sauce for our own tastes. I added 1 cup of bottled BBQ sauce, one small red onion-diced and half of a green bell pepper-diced. I also used molasses and sugar substitute instead of the brown sugar. Delish and the best beefy BBQ this side of NJ!! :)

This was tasty for a red sauce.  I did only put in a dash of the hot sauce cause the kids were eating it on chicken quesadillas.
