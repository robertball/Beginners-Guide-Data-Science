So easy to make, and way more cost efficient than those pricey coffee house drinks! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I cut the recipe in half and am storing it in the fridge. Kids would love this too, just stirred into some warm milk. I use about 1 tbsp per cup of coffee and that's plenty sweet for me. Thanks for the great recipe!

I wasn't very skeptical at first. The recipe is different than most. As I was stirring the powdered ginger into the bowl I was beginning to doubt the recipe, but I really wanted to give it a try. I have a Breville Barista Express and the machine can pull a beautiful shot of espresso and steam the milk to perfection. I scooped 2 Tablespoons of syrup (which is think) into my cup and set about making the drink. I was blown away, since I just indulged in a Starbucks Gingerbread Latte earlier in the day. This recipe is very close without the artificial ingredients of you were to buy it at a store. I will be making this again !

Really easy, really tasty. So much better than the shop bought, synthetic syrups. Will be putting it in hot chocolate too. A new favorite!
