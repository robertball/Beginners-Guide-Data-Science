Simply awesome! It's a nice spin on regular 'ol ham and cheese. Plus, it's a great way to use up leftover brie cheese! This made for a quick and easy dinner coupled with a glass of white wine (or in my husband's case a cold beer). Just eyeball the ingredients and you're on your way to something really tasty!

I love brie and had some leftover from my party last week, so I was very happy to find this recipe. Made just one sandwich for my lunch yesterday and it was delicious!

My husband and I loved this recipe. We actually used the foreman grill  and had great results.

I have made a version of this sandwich a long time. I use a Brie spread instead of slices of Brie because I dont like the rind on a sandwich.  I also will put it on a crossiant and grill it like a panini. Delicious!

This was pretty good. I ended up with my own take on it I guess because I used a hearty multi grain bread instead of an english muffin and it turned out great! I also used helmans olive oil mayo and some djion with horseradish and omitted the white wine vinegar.  Mixing the two together worked great though.  This was a delicious sandwich that I would make again next time I have some brie in the house.

This recipe was very good!  I used it to entertain a guest for lunch.  It would go well with a glass of wine.  I made one batch with brie (which was heavier) and one batch with camembert (seems that my guest and I both preferred the camembert) and didn't measure the ingrediants, but instead just used my eye as a measurement for the sauce mix.

I used a nice tender and not too salty bone in ham from the deli.

Very good!

This was a great way to use some brie we had left over from a party. The mayo/mustard mixture is quite good, and we have used it for other sandwiches with good results.

We made this recipie for our chef and restaurant class.  It was quick and easy to make but there are some changes to the recipie that we made that we thought made it better.  We toasted (or broiled) the english muffins before we made the sandwiches.  We used about three triangular slices of brie per sandwich, one tomato slice, about three pieces of ham, and the spread.  Just make sure the ham is hot or at least warm because it made for a strange sandwich with cold ham and other hot items on it.  Overall, a great idea to eat for a light lunch if you have the ingredients lying around the house, but don't go out of your way to make it.

Did this for an outdoor concert and it was a 5 star hit. Really was a different presentation for the usual picnic food.

Had this for lunch today.  Not bad but would prefer to eat it on a multi-grain bread.  Will make again!

This was a wonderful recipe ... my son, who does not like brie ... liked this!  As a matter of fact he keeps asking me to make it again! Thanks for sharing.

Normally I love brie cheese, but I didn't like it on a sandwich. Just a personal taste thing.

Excellent! I put everything on one half & then topped it with another half that had only the mayo on it making a sandwich. This is just delicious!

My husband and I just had a baby so we've been trying lots of sandwich recipes. I have to say of all the recipes we've tried thus far, this is my least favorite. That isn't to say it isn't good. My husband LOVED it. I did make some changes to it. 

Since I was only making 2 sandwiches, I didn't use as much of the spread and I just made the spread without measuring. I used olive oil mayo instead of regular mayo and mustang with horseradish. 

I used sesame seed sourdough bread, which tasted great I think. I also used tavern ham and those precut wee brie things. They melted really well but I imagine real Brie would have made it so much  better. Lastly, for the tomatoes I used cherry tomatoes and yellow perfection tomatoes cause I have WAY too many in my garden.
