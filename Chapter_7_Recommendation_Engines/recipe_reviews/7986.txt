I was hesitant to try this recipe at first because of some of the bad reviews, but I am so glad that I did!  This recipe was awesome!  The cake was very moist and fluffy - not at all dense or dry as in the previous review, and it rose perfectly (perhaps the problem with previous reviews saying thiers had fallen in the middle was old baking powder?).  I followed the recipe and instructions exactly (except I substituted butter for the shortening because I didn't have any), and didn't even use a water bath and it was still incredibly moist!  It was perfect with Tianne's Chocolote Frosting I.  Definitely a recipe that I will use over and over!

I found that if I used the amount of baking powder 3 1/2 tsp which it calls for, that is all you taste in the cake.  I tossed the first one out (which was also to dry due to using the exact bake time and not less which you should) and found that the cake was good with just 2 teaspoons of baking powder and only 22 minutes in the oven using 2 9inch pans.

This recipe is perfect. It was light and moist. To all of you that this was a dense heavy cake ...sift the flower befor adding it and only bake it for about 25-30 mins. I have a family of 200 gathering and it was gone in 15 mins. Now I have request for it. Great cake! I also entered it into a bake contest and I won first place.

We were very pleased at how this cake turned out. This was my husband's first attempt at making cake from scratch (LOVES cake and has  made box cakes until  now).We substituted butter for shortening and about a 1/2 c or so of the flour was whole wheat (will increase to 1 c next time), baked in 2 round pans for 33 min(one to eat, one to freeze). We both went back for seconds (OK, I had thirds). Oh, and that was with no frosting! Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE: made it again and it turned out even better. We mixed it a lot more this time and it baked up very light. This makes me wonder if people who have gotten really dense cakes have not mixed long enough to incorporate some air into the batter before baking?? Bottom line - wonderful to have a recipe from scratch that tastes this good. Many thanks!

I use this recipe for birthday cakes or other special occasions and its always a hit.  I have some recommendations though which might help some of the others who weren't as happy with it as me.

1) I bake this cake in a water bath - place tin on cookie sheet (or other tin with high sides); fill larger tin with boiling water while baking.  This ensures an extremely moist cake.
2) Line tin with parchment paper and grease with shortening - this definitely allows it to come out clean from the tin.
3) I like to add almond extract with the vanilla for a really nice subtle flavour.  I've also frosted this with a vanilla (store bought) frosting and added ground almonds with sugar between layers or on top.

Thanks very much for this recipe - definitely a keeper for me :o)

This recipe is awesome!  I doubled it and made an American Flag cake with it (with blueberry stars and strawberry stripes) for a birthday treat (my b-day is close to the 4th of July) - and there were 50 happy people at work!  I did follow other's advice and cut the baking powder to 2 tsp and used 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, plus I separated the eggs.  I whisked the egg whites and added a bit at a time, then mixed the yolks with the milk and alternated it with the flour mixture, which I sifted.  It turned out light and fluffy and moist! Will make again for sure!  Thanks!

DRY.  DRY.  DRY.  I should have been skeptical when I noticed the ingredients not listed in order of use.  I followed the directions fine, but the cake was not.

This is a very flavorful cake.  I've made this recipe three times.  I, like others, have found the cake to be too dry.  What made the difference for me was to separate the egg yolk and white before creaming, then adding the yolk last (before the flour & milk)
I cooked mine for only 35 minutes and it came out perfect.  My oven is a piece of junk so it could just be my oven :)

i didn't get a bite, but everyone who took some said it was awesome
I made this cake again one day in a 10" springform pan, cut it in half, spread the inside of one piece with half a package of instant vanilla pudding mix with whipped cream(real), topped the pudding mixture with slice bananas, laid the other half of the cake on top of the bananas, iced the cake with whipped cream, topped whipped cream with more sliced bananas and created my first iced cake: banana pudding cream cake. it was literally gone in 15 minutes.

My first time making a cake from scratch and it came out perfect. My husband loves it and he is picky about his cakes because his mother is a great baker. I followed the recipe and had no problems. I substituted half of the shortening with sweet butter, and that is the only change I made. For those of you who did not get good results, try this recipe again and follow the instructions carefully, too little or too much of any ingredient may cause an undesirable result.

I made this cake today and it is great! It is not as yellow as a 4 to 6 egg cake, but the taste is delicious! I used real butter vs shortening, and used 1 cup 00 italian flour and 1 cup all purpose (finer crumb, tender texture). I decreased the baking powder to 3 tsp and decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp (these are personal preferences). This is my go to cake recipe. My entire family loved it! UPDATE: I have made this cake 6 times since my original review and have found the following works best: room temp eggs, real butter straight from the fridge, room temp milk, sift the two flours together w/ the baking powder. cream the butter/sugar on med-high, add all 3 eggs at the same time and mix on the highest speed you have for 2 minutes, cut the speed all the way back to the lowest speed you have and just add the flour blend and milk at the same time. beat on the lowest speed until mixed (do not over mix). pour into prepped pan and bake ( I average 30 min...sometimes longer, sometimes less). This is my go to cake!

I made this for my mother.  She does not like boxed cake mixes.  I did sift the flour and I followed the directions very carefully.  But, it was still pretty easy and it came out beautifully.  I used half butter and half shortening.  I used two 9 inch round pans.  I baked it 28 minutes, as another reviewer recommended.  I might even test it at 25 next time.  Everyone loved it, especially my mother!  It is a very different texture than a cake mix. It is sort of like comparing a fast food burger to a homemade one.

I was excited to try out this recipe because I wanted to make cupcakes from scratch instead of using a box mix.  I should have stuck to the box mix.  They tasted like corn muffins and they were very dry.  I had to bake another batch using a box mix that I had in the house.

I really liked this recipe and my husband loved it.  The consistancy was moist, not dry and was not crumbly like a lot of cake mixes turn out.  I substituted Spenda for half the sugar and it wasn't even noticable.  I also used butter instead of shortening, I just think it really adds more flavor to the cake.  To anyone who thought this tasted like corn bread, I would suggest making sure to follow the step of alternating in flour mixture and milk.  This step will really smooth out the texture of the cake.

Much better than the Wilton basic yellow cake recipe! The only changes I made, was I used baking soda as I was out of baking powder after a weeks worth of Wilton thud brick cakes, and then to counter the saltiness of the baking soda, I added about 1/4 more sugar to the mix and baked in a water bath in the oven at 325 in convection mode. What I got was the most spectacularly soft and moist and fluffy cake! It was amazing! For those who are getting dense cakes or cornbread like cakes, beat your shortening or butter and eggs more to make it lighter and fluffier and presift your flour. It makes a ton of difference. You really can't do wrong with this cake recipe. If it's not turning out, it's operator error.

This cake was ok. It was really dry and both times that made it, it broke when it came out of the pan. The second time the middle completely fell in and was like batter. I will probably use a differnent recipe next time.

Made this cake for my son's birthday. It was not edible!  I questioned using that much baking powder, but did it any way based on the reviews.  My son took one bite and spit it out.  It was GROSS!

This batter is so delicious and especially for making cupcakes. I had to make 60 of them for a Halloween Party and the batter is so moist and better than any box mix. One tip, make sure if you are using all purpose flour even though it has baking powder in it to use baking powder anyway this makes a big difference.

This cake came out dense and moderately dry, I followed the directions immaculately. I was very excited to make a cake from scratch and expected a wonderful tasting one, but was dissapointed.   It also needed more sugar than the recipe calls for, and you could almost taste the eggs.  If you insist on making this cake(which i wouldn't personally recommend), add more sugar and two eggs instead of three.

Loved it!!!!!  Have made it 4 times with all types of options.  If you make layers, just cut back on the cooking time.  If you make the 9x13, then bake at the time listed.  I also cut back on my baking powder to 2 tsp.

For someone who can barely make a cake from a box, this was awesome! I made it as a cake and as cupcakes. It came out GREAT! A family favorite, YUM! It came out of the pan flawlessly and the taste was good too. Now to find a flawless, easy, icing recipe... I'm not so good at that, yet.

I used this recipe to make a mini wedding cake.  It had really good texture.  It didn't crumble when I cut out the mini cakes.  Thanks for the recipe! Edit: I'm changing my previous rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. I made this recipe again and for some reason when I use butter instead of shortening it made the finished recipe a bit salty, and I'm using unsalted butter! IMO it's probably better to stick to just shortening and lower the sugar content.

Excellent! Very easy and very tasty! It definitely isn't like the store mix but I think it's really great for a from scratch recipe.

I think I tried to make this one before but it turned out too dry. Made it this time as cupcakes with a water bath and it turned out great. Very moist.

Finally a good from scratch cake recipe!

I made this cake for an accomplished baker, I wanted to make it from scratch, my cake turned out great, the only suggestion, I followed was, to beat it till you got the air bubbles out...nice and fluffy. thank you for this recipe..........

I made this cake exactly as directed. I substitued 1/2 of the shortening with 1/2 butter as the recipe state could be done. We liked the flavor of this scratch cake but according to all of my family it was a tad dry and the crumb was too large. We actually baked this two minutes under the stated time. When cutting the cake there were crumbs all over the serving plate. This made a poor presentation. Based on our experience we could only rate this cake a 3.

This is a VERY good cake! As far as one reviewer stated that it was not sweet enough, well it was plenty sweet enough for us, very sweet and flavorful in fact. I could have eaten the whole thing without icing. I did make a few changes when making this recipe. I used butter in place of the shortening, I cut the baking powder down to 2 1/2 teaspoons, I sifted the salt, baking power and flour twice, and I added 1/8 tsp of almond extract for more flavor. Very nice cake. I also reduced the baking time to 28 minutes, well at least that's how long it took for it to bake in my oven. I wanted to try out  a few recipes before making a cake for my son's birthday in a few weeks. I think this one will be a winner!

My sister and i tried to make this cake. We followed the directions. We put it in the oven and after few moments we smelt something burning. When we went to check on it. It had pretty much exploded. It was all over the racks and caked on the bottom of the oven. We had to turn off the oven and let it dry a little before we could even pull it out of the oven. We had to throw away the pans. We spent over an hour scraping bits of this cake off of the racks. We still have not finished cleaning the bottom of the oven. To top it all off it smelled absolutely awful. I was very disappointed with this recipe. It looked nothing like cake. I will NEVER make this again. I might never even eat cake again.

If you want a hard packed pale white cake with little flavor.. this is the one for you! I read the reviews.. followed the tips but this one was not good. I am an avid baker- from my ultimate choc chip cookie to baklava and I have never had a cake come out so "lead like". I was truly embarrassed!

I was reluctant to make a cake with shortening (Crisco); but I was nearly out of butter, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  And I did just about everything wrong, but it still came out great.  First, because I wanted to use it for a pineapple-upside-down cake, I substituted 3/4 C pineapple juice and 1/4 C cherry juice for the cup of milk.  Then, I found I didn't have enough baking powder (and it was old, too), but I went ahead and used the 2 t I had.  Lastly, I forgot the vanilla until I put the cake in the oven, so I just drizzled it on top! (I did follow the suggestion of using a water bath because I don't like dry cakes.)  Anyway, to my amazement, it came out wonderfully--very light, moist, and flavorful--much better than my old recipe for yellow cake.  It took about 50 minutes to bake, and I kept testing it because a pineapple-upside-down cake can take longer than a regular yellow cake, given the moistness of the fruit.  My boyfriend, who usually prefers flourless cakes, really loved this recipe, too; he can't stop raving about how tasty it is.  I'm looking forward to making this cake when I actually have all the right ingredients and can follow the recipe exactly (though I'll still use the fruit juice instead of milk the next time I make a pineapple-upside-down cake).  Thanks, Foxy.

The flavor is good ~ the cake was not as fluffy as a box cake mix.  Moist & dense with a crusty edge ~ which my fiance enjoyed.  Used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening.  Also 1/4 cup less sugar and 1/2 t. less baking powder.  Do sift the flour first & then spoon it lightly into your measuring cup for accurate amount.  Beat with electric mixer for about 2 minutes when all the ingredients are added/as with box cake for air to incorporate.  Only needed 35 minutes baking time.  We definitely LOVED this cake which I 'iced' with a homemade Hersheys recipe for Chocolate Mousse...excellent!

This was really good.  Not as yellow as I thought it would be, but very yummy.  I made the cake in a loaf pan (2) and we ate them right out of the over, barely cool, that was how good they are.  Will be making this one again and maybe even frost it next time.

Please.  Don't waste your ingredients on this awful thing.  It wouldn't even qualify as cornbread.  Are the reveiws for real about this so called cake?  I'm a good cook and baking is my specialty.  This is just plain awful.  Don't go there.

Really simple to make. Had a nice flavour and texture.  Gave 4 stars because it didn't rise as high as I would have liked.  Also used butter for better flavour. Worth making again.

This is a good cake base.  You just have to play with the ingredients.  I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of 3, oil in place of shortening (it is a cake after all), and because I love vanilla, I used a tablespoon instead.  I also am a little heavy handed with greasing the pan so not only was the cake more flavorful and moist with my changes, it popped out of the pan!

Dry, dense, and flavorless.  Will not make again.  I could feel how dry it was as soon as it cooled and decided to get the frosting on it and let it sit for a day under a cake dome hoping that would help.  It didn't.  The worse part was it was brought to a family gathering where the only one who ate a piece was my husband.  Which doesn't say much, since he'll eat anything if it has chocolate slapped on it.

It was a great cake. I was worried a bit because of mixed reviews, but it turned out fine! Be generous with vanilla or some other flavorful extract. I made it in bundt form, whith butter frosting it was delicious. I added only 2 tsp baking powder as someone adviced and cake rose beautifully.

Terrible, terrible, terrible! DO NOT make this cake. I made it for my mother's birthday and it turned out extremely dry. Eventhough I greased and floured the pan, the cake still stuck and tore apart. I usually have great success with cake recipes but this was an exception.

I think I should've substituted all butter, or used butter flavored shortning.  This was very dry and really didn't have much flavor.  It worked out okay though because I used it in i trifle.  This would not be very good by itself, even with frosting.  I don't think I will be making this again.

I have made a lot of cakes from this website, but this is the first one I was disappointed with.  Like other reviewers, the cake was too dry for me and lacked flavor, even though I added an extra tsp of vanilla.  The cake rose beautifully in the oven, but collapsed after I took it out to cool.  After comparing other yellow cake recipes, I think this one doesn't call for enough eggs.  Sorry, but I won't make this one again.

I made this cake today, The only change I found necessary was the milk amount. It calls for 1 cup, I added 1 1/2 cups. The cake was moist and delicious . Will definitely make again !!!

Very dry and dense but not in a good way.  Not worth the cost of ingredients, the time to make it or the time at the gym to burn it off.  I am an experienced baker.

Made this yesterday for a Valentine cake for a 97-year old dear man.  Trusted the reviews that if I sifted my flour (ALWAYS sift flour, pre-sifted or not), thoroughly creamed the shortening mix before adding the flour mix, and measured and mixed accurately, it would turn out tasty with a nice crumb and not fall in the middle.  Fail.  It fell in the middle, so that crumb was dense, had a rather large crumb around the non-fallen edges, and tasted okay as long as it was accompanied by the sweet cream cheese frosting I spread on it.  Pretty disappointing.  The cake alone, was dry and not very sweet.  Still looking for trusty, basic cake recipes instead of using mixes.

Super moist cake. I followed the directions as they were written and I also beat the mixture for a long time (I let it beat for the whole process and a little extra while I greased the pan) It's probably important to get a lot of air in it.

I just made this and followed the Recipe but it came out looking like cornbread and tasting like egg. Next time I will reduce the egg, add 2cups of sugar, coconut oil instead of butter/grease and use buttermilk instead. It came out a little dry but maybe because the recipe calls for 45 mins in oven.

I needed a fairly simple recipe and this fit the bill. My kiddie taste testers thought it wasn't sweet enough, but when you pile on the icing (which we tend to do) I think they're plenty sweet. I used butter instead of shortening and only 2tsps of baking powder.

Very tasty, moist, fluffy, and not too sweet cake. I tried to make a cupcakes, but made the mistake of over filling the cup. DO NOT FILL MORE THAN HALF WAY. I got about 35 reasonably sized cupcakes out of the second batch. I made homemade chocolate and white frosting. YUM! Will make over and over again.

I've been baking cakes for about two months, but i use the box cakes. But for my little cousins baptism i decided to try making one from scratch.  (i thought it would be cheaper since its for about 50 people) so i decided to try it before actually making the real thing. It was way better then i thought it would be. The only changes i did were instead of 3 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, i used 2 1/2.  I also didnt have any vanilla, so i skipped that this time. But it was still amazing super moist and very fluffy. i followed other people's advice and baked it for 30 minutes instead of the 45 it said. maybe that is why it comes out dry for others.   anyways, I will definitely be using this cake for the baptism this weekend

Cake exploded in my oven. Was my first try at baking cake from scratch, this is not the recipe to use when baking from scratch for the first time apparently. If it is your first try baking a cake without a box, don't let the "easy" description fool you. I re-read the recipie and followed it to a T and still had the cake explode and collapse on me.

This cake was amazingly moist....almost too moist to get out of the tins in one piece.  I forgot to line with parchment paper so I got a little sticking on the bottom even though I greased and floured.  I made it twice and tried both the baking powder recommendations.  I didn't notice much difference in the taste.  I also cooked it less then the recommended time (my oven cooks hot).  Used it with The Barefoot Contessa's Chocolate Buttercream frosting (to die for) and topped it with yellow peeps lining the edges and choc chips in the middle to make a sunflower cake.  Loved it so much I made a batch up cupcakes to follow it up.  MMM MMM good.

The only change I made to the recipe was using oil because butter/shortening is really expensive here in China. The cake was soft, moist and tasty -- very easy to make! Great recipe.

I was searching for a shortcake recipe to go with some fresh strawberries.  I did not have adequate ingredients on hand, after doing a further search, found this yellow cake.    I used butter, and only baked for 35 minutes.  I do believe if I had baked it longer, it would have burned.  The cake came out perfect, no overpowering flavors, and the strawberries on this cake, made it perfect.    The only reason for the four instead of five stars, is the length of time to bake.

this was a great cake my family of 5 ate it all in one day. I chose to use no icing it did not come out hard i also added a 1/4 cup of oil and used butter instead of shortening. it was outstanding. The only type of cake i have ever made from scratch is a pound cake other wise i have always used a box mix. from now on i will use this instead. again awesome cake

This cake is yucky. It only turns out about 3/4 of an inch tall. I have made alot of cakes, and this one just doesn't cut it. If you want a light fluffy cake use the berry tiramisu cake on this sight. I know it says sponge cake, but is a really good yellow cake mix especially if you add a bit of nutmeg to it. Just leave this recipe alone.

This is a great & easy recipe that yields an excellent cake!  It tastes very 'homemade' as opposed to many boxed-mix cakes, which tend to have an 'artificial' taste.  I read the reviews before trying this one, and while I see what people meant about the cake being dense, I think that was part of what made it so appealing.  I did not find it dry at all, though it did dry out about three days after I made it.  (I think this was more due to the container i kept it in than due to the cake itself.)  A lot of cakes are too moist, falling apart when being eaten.  This one held together beautifully.  It did not sink in the middle, as was the case with some of the reviewers.  It was lopsided, but that's due to my oven, which isn't level.  Fortunately, with enough frosting (cream cheese frosting...mmmmm!), you couldn't tell it was lower on one side!  Even my son, who has never been big on cake, thought this one was good enough to eat four or five pieces!  This is really something, seeing as how he hardly ever eats even one piece of other cakes I've made.  I decided to go with 2 tsp. of baking powder after reading the reviews, and 3 tsp. of vanilla, as I prefer a sweeter cake.  Now you'll have to excuse me as I am heading back to the kitchen to make another one of these super yummy cakes!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I was looking for an easy cake that I could make for a "cake making project" for my 10th grade Biology Class.In my class we all had to go home, bake a cake, and bring it back in to class, and write a lab report. Also, the teacher insisted on trying a little bit of everyones' cake. Then she announced her favorite cake, IT WAS THIS ONE! I love this recipe, it's easy, short, and tastes sweet (but not TOO sweet) and moist. The second time I made this cake I tried adding some raisons and cinnamon; it turned out better than before. (5*)

It was a good recipe, and it tasted great, but it was a lot denser then I expected. I dont think I'll use it again, I need a recipe that yeilds a fluffier cake.

My kids and I had some fun with this.  We added food color droplets into the batter and swirled in color.  Then threw in a few chocolate chips before baking (note: choco chips sank to the bottom of cake).  I followed recipe exactly using butter instead of shortening, and included water cookie sheet in the oven for extra moistness.  I made a 9x13 pan and baked for the full 45 minutes.  It browned fully on top but was NOT hard or crusty.  It was a great tasting cake.  No frosting needed!

This cake was so good!!  I read the reviews first and I took the advise to whip the egg whites and put the yolks in with the milk and alternate the milk mixture with the flour.  This made the cake light and moist, Thank you.  I will make this again!

I didn't read the reviews first, or I may not have tried it!  I loved it.  I made it for my daughter's birthday, and it made several cupcakes and an 8x8.  I'd recommend keeping it all in the cake (the cupcakes got a bit dry).  The cake was wonderfully moist, though, and delicious.  I was a little heavy on the vanilla, as I love it, but that's the only variation I made.  

Thank you for a great recipe!  I'm putting this one in my box.

Unfortunately I was not overly impressed with these cupcakes.  I was hoping for something that would almost melt in my mouth, but this wasn't it.  It was too crumbly and gritty, even after I followed others' suggestions of sifting the flour, etc., and creaming the sugar and butter well.  I think David's Yellow Cake is a better recipe than this one, although I still think there has to be an even better one out there somewhere.  I'm still on the lookout for a true 5-star yellow cake recipe.

I made this cake for a guy I was enamored with at Valentine's Day. The cake itself was moist and smelled excellent. Although I never got a slice, he said it was great. So, I give this five stars. It was pretty easy to make too.

This was the best tasting cake I have ever had!  It was so much better then box mixes from the store.  Home made is definitly better in this case!  I made about 24 cupcakes using this recipe and it was soo flavorful and wasn't dry at all.

I made this cake twice and both times it didn't rise.  I made sure I measured the baking powder( it was fresh)exactly.  The cake tasted really good though, but I probably won't make it again

I substituted butter for the shortening and only used 2 tsp of baking powder instead of 3 1/2 tsps. It had a good taste but, was a little dry. I might try again but add oil or apple sauce to see if it makes it a little moister.

Turned out perfect! Had to cut the baking time a lot because my gas oven runs hot, even at 350. But it came out very moist and delicious. My husband and I are cake connoisseurs and both thought it was better than boxed mixes. I didn’t have to make any substitutions or change any ingredients. The only difference in the directions was the aforementioned baking time, and I mixed the dry ingredients together first, as I learned in 8th grade cooking class. I would change those instructions in the recipe to put all of the dry ingredients together first. But that’s just me. Other than that, perfect recipe.

What a great cake. So glad I decided to give this a try. I've been looking for a light and fluffy yellow cake recipe for quite some time now and I think I've finally found it. I did only use 2 teaspoons of baking powder but the rest of the recipe was as written. I beat the tar out of the eggs, sugar and shortening until it was light as air.  It's fine as is with the sugar quantity as long as I use frosting, but if I were to just eat it as is I'd probably add another half cup or so. Thanks for the great cake.

I used cake flour and added 2  tbsp. of butter. It came out lovely but was kind of dry. Next time I will use 10 tbsp. of butter and no Crisco. And probably add 1 egg yolk. It was better than a box cake mix  though and delicious with chocolate fudge icing.

Wonderful! Moist and tasty. Follow the recipe  and do not over mix and it will turn out wonderfully! There is no need for the extra half cup of sugar, I only put in one cup and no one noticed. I used lemon extract in place of the vanilla and it made a lovely lemon cake. This will take the place of boxed mix for me. FABULOUS!

Dry as toast. I followed directions to the letter! I watched it closely as it baked, took it out before the full time. It fell apart and is dry. I’m really bummed. Never again with this recipe. You live and learn but what a waste.

I followed this recipe exactly except that I took it out of the oven at 35 minutes. I was so disappointed after spending the time and using the ingredients,  it came out dry. Had I left it in the suggested time it would have been hard as a rock!

great base recipe. I made a few changes however: i used 3 egg yolks only, and no whites, and unsalted butter instead of shortening. I did not try the recipe as is, based on the reviews and what I had in my pantry. I baked the cake for 25 mins. depending on your oven, 22 to 25 mins should be perfect. super moist, sweet, but not overly so. for those with dense or heavy cake, you are over mixing. sift the dry ingredients, twice i'd recc..it really helped the dry incorporate with the wet. also, i used whole milk, which adds more fat and richness to the cake, without making it heavy. i made chocolate buttercream frosting and it's wonderful all together!

Great recipe. I turned this into a lemon cake by adding lemon yellow food coloring and 2 1/2 tsp lemon extract. 

The only thing I would change about this recipe is: use butter flavored shortening instead of plain shortening and add 3tbspn  sour cream to the finished batter. This makes your cake very soft and even more moist.

So far Im not pleased.  The recipe did not fill the size pan it says.  I had to make 2 and 1/2 batches at different times to fill the pan.   A 9x13 cake pan takes at least 6 cups of batter.  My pan should have been filled because it takes 6 cups of batter (not 9x13) 2 1/2 later it is still not filled and I am out of ingredients to make the cake. I used all my eggs, had to spbstitute brown sugar for the last 1/2 of mix.  It is a stand up bear and the bottom of the feet will be nonexistent.  Hopefully it expands before it sets so he has some feet.  Trying the 25 minute bake time and then go from there.
waiting for it to bake and apparently i could have stopped at 2 batches.  Still oozing

I liked this cake.  I subbed butter for all the shortening.   I also doubled it and baked a half sheet cake at 325 for about an hour.  I made two of them in fact for a church reception.  Got many complements.  The creamed butter and sugar was not "light and fluffy" but I did add eggs one at a time and really beat well to give a lot of air.  I also mixed the vanilla into the milk to make sure it was well distributed. Nice texture and flavor. Will make again.

First time I have made a cake from scratch and this turned out perfect for my upside down pineapple cake. I followed Tonysgdbg suggestions and used the ingredient at room temperature except for the butter which I substituted for the shortening. Very moist and not too sweet.

We made gluten-free cupcakes using Pillsbury's new Gluten-Free multipurpose flour blend. They're delicious!!! Everyone loves them. I subbed half butter for the shortening, and baked in lined cups for about 20 minutes. Finally, gluten-free cake that doesn't weigh like 80 lbs. Very light. Thank you for sharing.

I halved the recipe, baked it in a 9" round cake pan, and it was perfect at 30 minutes of baking. It rose great, is soft and springy, and smells perfect.

I tried this cake recipe as a test run to begin teaching my friend to bake. Not only did this cake turn out very well, but it required very little ingredients, most of which are things i would have around my house anyways. It is confusing that people are complaining of the cake turning out dry or collapsing, these sound like issues of people that are actually paying too much attention to the recipe. Never trust bake times. just check it yourself. My bake time was a little bit longer than the recipe suggested. This recipe was easy, and tasty. Well done.

I made this cake for the 1st time last night (along with an improvised, home-made cream cheese chocolate frosting) and it came out great.  Like other users, I used butter instead of shortening.

It came out looking exactly like every box cake I've ever made.  It was not dry or dense.  Then again, I took the time to follow the directions exactly. (grin)  

Yes, it's faster and easier to just make it all in one bowl or to throw all of the eggs in at once, etc but you won't get the same results.  Follow the directions EXACTLY.  Every step DOES make a difference in how your finished product will come out.  You really need to add, mix, add, mix, add, mix as described or you'll end up with a saw dust tasting brick.  

In addition to doing the slow add/mix with the eggs, I also did that while adding the flour mix and milk.  I added 1/3 of each in turn between mixings.

My finished product was suitably light, tasted good and was very moist.  Instead of the pan size suggested, I used 3 small square pans (as I love the frosting to cake ratio of 3 layer cakes) and baked it on the middle over rack for about 20 minutes on 350.

I like this recipe because it's simple but I made a few changes to the ingredients and method.  I use 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder, 1/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of butter (instead of shortening).  Then I mixed all my dry ingredients in a bowl and set to the side.  Next I mixed my butter and applesauce, then added the sugar and vanilla extract and beat until fluffy, next beat in one egg at a time. Finally I added dry ingredients and milk alternatively.  Taste the batter and you will know you have a good mix.  I baked in two 8" round pans for about 20 mins.  Amazing and everyone loved it!

The recipe is a perfect guideline and my first one was mediocre at best. For my second I reduced the baking powder to 2 tbs and reduced the cook time to 22 min and the heat 10 degrees and its perfect. Some advice for people, with any new recipe do it beforehand once even twice, adjust accordingly and you'll produce great results.

YUM YUM YUM!!! I don't understand all the negative things said about this cake. I was keeping my fingers crossed while it baked. I used a bundt pan and cooked it a tad longer.Followed directions as shown. It came out perfect! I took one bite and the taste lingered. I almost wanted to skip dinner lol

This was a somewhat dense cake but with good flavor and not too sweet.    Although I think it may come out a little too heavy for my liking for regular cake use, I thought it was perfect for pineapple upside-down cake.  I liked that it wasn't too sweet as pineapple upside-down cakes tend to be over-sweet.  Also I think the denseness of this cake is more suitable to pineapple upside down cakes.  For my cake I used butter instead of shortening, and added about a half cup of pineapple juice which may have added to the denseness, so when I try it again as a regular cake it may be a little fluffier.

Made this into cupcakes, made about 16.  This cake tastes great even without icing!  Happy to find a good scratch recipe.  I use my own hens eggs and they are extra large so I only used 2 and that was fine. Making Boston Cream Cupcakes.

After reading the reviews I used only 2 teaspoons of baking soda, and I was careful to sift the flour.  I also used 1 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup margrine.  It turned out great!  I will definitely use this recipe again!  Next time I am going to try cake flour to see if I can skip the sifting.

I tried to make cupcakes, they didn't bake uniformly, many were doughy. I thought it may have been old baking powder so I tried again with new powder but the same results, they puffed up too big for muffin pan then flatten out. Maybe it would work better in a cake pan. Don't think I will bother though.

I made this cake for the first time and it turned out perfect. It was not dry at all and had a good flavor. I did substitute self rising flour since that's what I had on hand. Once I added the chocolate frosting,this was a great cake. I'm glad I tried this recipe.

Very nice cake batter, very delicious. I used a cupcake pan, and baked it for about 16 minutes, it came out perfect, the tops of the cupcakes were kind of crispy, but sticky, which I thought was a nice touch. If you don't allow the batter to mix properly, then your finished product will not be enjoyable. I was pretty surprised that it was so good. Also made from-scratch lemon icing. It was an awesome recipe I will use again!

Wow...so simple to make! It turned out spongy, fluffy, and just right! I turned the broiler on for the last 4 minutes to give it a great golden color and crisp. I only baked it for 30 mins, because I sifted the flour. I even added blueberries, which sunk a little and kept the middle even more juicy and yummy!!! LOVE this recipe, and WILL use again! Thank you muchly :)

This cake was very easy for my first time baking a cake from scratch! It tastes very good but it's more of a white cake than a yellow. It's a little dry but with a little tweaking of the recipe it'll be a perfect cake to bake and teach to your kids for their first cake!

This cake was really dry and not flavorful at all. The baking time was way too long the cake was overcooked. Maybe it was me because everyone else seemed to love it.

Definitely scale back a bit on the baking powder and oven time (maybe this was for high-altitudes). I also spit the shortening with unsalted butter for a little richer flavor.  Substitute pineapple juice for milk and this makes a GREAT pineapple upside down cake.

I had a box of Coconut pudding and thought it might be good in a cake.  I just wanted a plain cake recipe.  This one worked!  I added the coconut pudding and some chopped pineapple to the batter, then topped with whipped topping after cool.  It was good!

Very tasting and simple to make.  I wanted a simple yellow cake to use to make pineapple upside down cake. And I wanted to use organic ingredients.  I don't ever use shortening due to the GMO's in it so I used butter in place of that. And due to prior reviews I used only 2 tsps of baking powder.   This cake cooked up nice, light and yummy.  The family was raving about it when I served it for dessert.  Thanks the poster for sharing it!

I altered this a bit and got sensational results:  1) I used vegetable oil instead of shortening 2) I ran out of milk so i mixed 1/2 cup of 1% milk with water 3) I used 2 jumbo eggs instead of 3 4) I used 3 tsp baking powder 5) I live in Chicago (for altitude reference) and it only took 25 minutes in (2) 9-inch baking pans to bake  The result is a slightly moist, robust cake.

Beatuful, delectable, easy, 5 stars! My friend and I needed a yummy cake to feed my family for the 4th of July party, so we chose this one. It was a hit! My grandmother is asking me to make it again on her birthday. I do have to say, I ran out of milk so we used the same amount of half and half and it still turned out great! Definetly will be using this recipe again. Thanks!

I baked this cake for my 24th birthday. I have never baked a cake from scratch before, but this one was SO easy! After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical. I certainly didn't want a rock hard cake. But, even without the use of a mixer, I found it to come out perfectly. The baking time was right on, and it came out golden, moist and only slightly more dense than a box cake. Because I wanted something a little different, I added lemon zest and fresh squeezed lemon juice. I also substituted butter for the shortening. I really can't say enough about this cake. I will definitely be making it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. This was the first time I ever made a yellow cake from scratch and it got rave reviews. It was easy to cut into layers and it was easy to frost without breaking or crumbling. I transported it to a few different places and it held up great. I did find that refrigerating it dried it out.

Not bad, followed the directions exactly since this is the first time I have ever made a cake from scratch, the middle fell in and it had a sort of cornbread taste and texture to it, but fortunately my family loves cornbread, so not a complete waste LOL.

This was exactly what i was looking for and it worked beautifully.  I needed an easy sheet cake for my son's birthday for school and this was simple and looked wonderful.  I didnt get a chance to taste it but the kids and teacher said it was fab!!  Iced it simply with butter icing and lots of smarties and sprinkles - thank you, this will be used again and again.

This is exactly what i was looking for.  I however started to make the recipe and realized i had no shortening so I used a half cup of butter and added 1/4 cup sour cream. Three days later and still moist and yummy.

This didn't work out for me. I made this a first time, and added cocoa powder in it to make it chocolatey. It came out very dry even when I added more liquid and sugar to it. The second attempt, the cake came out llike a cornbread consistency as another viewer said, and the middle dropped with a split in the middle. My baking powder was "not" old. I won't be trying this a third time.

I followed this recipe exactly. It tastes like Jiffy corn bread mix and also stuck the pan. The cake is all torn and cannot be served. Don't waste your time with this recipe, it really isn't good. Very crumby and not sweet enough. I make cakes from scratch all of the time and this recipe is a dud!

AMAZING!!! This cake turned out wonderful! I did cut down the baking powder to 2 tsps, but the turnout was beyond words! Light, fluffy and moist!! It you are looking for a cake that tastes similar to store bought box mix, this is it!!! I will NEVER buy cake mix ever again!!! Thank you for sharing this one of a kind cake recipe!

Excellent yellow cake. Followed the directions exactly, and the cake came out great.Iced with a chocolate glaze and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Make sure you use room temp butter and eggs. Other than that follow the directions, and you will get a moist, delicious cake.

This was my first time making any cake from scratch, I have always used the boxed cakes. This was very easy to understand and follow even without a wire whisk, tabletop mixer, or handheld mixer, recipe came out perfectly. I used only shortening as the recipe was written that way. The only difference I made was I only baked the cake for 37 minutes. I had the intentions of checking it at that time but when I put the toothpick in it was already done. I was very impressed, I think this cake came out better than any boxed cake I have ever made! I am going to make a from scratch fresh strawberry frosting. Will definately be using this recipe again and again.

Not a very good recipe.  It falls in the center, regardless of the precautions you take, and I just didn't like how it tasted.

I was very hesitant about triyng this cake, and just in case I bought a box of mix, but I didn't use it, because this cake was wonderfull! I use 2 9 inch round pans and I didn't use the water bath, and it was great, I used for my daughter's birthday cake with Rick's buttercream frosting and everyone loved-it!

If I had to rate the recipe strictly on taste I would give it a five. I baked it for my daughter's birthday cake and used 2 9in pans and was hoping to be able to frost it, but it was very crumbly and basically fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pans. I wish I could find a good layer cake recipe that would rise and not crumble to pieces when I frosted it. Great on taste, poorly on staying together. Wondering if it's my Baker's Secret pans I used. Hmm......

Used warm ingredients like milk and eggs, and sifted flour. Deleted salt and also substituted warm salted butter for shortening. Added 1 box of instant pudding mix along with flour. Can we say the best pudding cake from scratch recipe ever. Made my own fudge frosting and heaven.  Finally!!!

This was so good.  I took someone else's suggestion and sifted the flour first.  I made cupcakes with this recipe and they  turned out beautifully.  Very light and fluffy.  I also had to substitute margarine for the shortening since I did not have any shortening on hand.  I will make this recipe again.

Not very good. It was edible, but slightly dry and heavy. I'm not the best cake baker, so maybe I did something wrong, but I don't plan on trying this one again. I think "Four Egg Yellow Cake" from this site was better.

This cake was awesome I will admit I did revise it but only a little I used canola oil isntead of shortning and also I added 1/2 a cup of ameretto to make it a little smoother I did cupcakes and they turned out perfect! So moist and fluffy we ate a few without icing and they were declicous. Definetly the best scratch cake recipe Ive ever used!

This cake is so yummy.  I folloiwed the recipe to a T only subbing marg for the shortening.  Came out perfect; not too sweet, subtle vanilla flavor.. so good.  I didn't find it too dry as others said, maybe they cooked it just a bit too long?  Maybe they were expecting something like a boxed cake?  This is not a boxed cake.  It doesnt have the same texture as a boxed cake; that is good.  If you want a good home made cake, this is it.  TIP: do not over mix when adding the flour, just mix until you dont see the flour.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I give this recipe 5 starts due to the substitute ingredients still fluffy and very nice looking, I substitute 1 cup natural orange juice instead of milk, and soy oil instead of shortening and it look fantastic I did backe two round 9" pans to make a layer cake, great recipe.

I made this cake and it was to salty and so I made another one and used less baking powered and just almost no salt at all .... The second tasted just fine and it was better than the first one .... so I think that whoever posted this recipe on this Yellow Cake Made from Scratch needs to go back and review the recipe ....

This cake tastes very very good!  Although I wasn't happy with the cupcakes.  I made cupcakes and then used rest of batter for small cake.  Cupcakes formed crispy crust around the edges that over- lapped onto the pan.  When I pulled the cup cake liner off, the cake stuck to the liner so bad that it never even formed a cupcake.  You basically had to eat just the chunks off of the liner.  Which were very tasty, by the way.  The crispy part tasted like a vanilla wafer.  The cake stayed more intact, but it sank.  This is not a dry cake, but it was a little too crumbly for me.  I had alot of air pockets, but yet was still very moist.  I guess I'm just not used to the box cake mixes.  Anyway, that's my experience with this recipe.  Overall, I think the taste was very good.  It would be good plain, or with a powdered sugar frosting.

I made all of the changed recommended by the others -- less baking powder, more vanilla, separate eggs, whip egg whites, alternate yolks and flour, etc -- and still ended up with a dry, dense cake. I didn't overbeat or overcook it, so I'm not going to use this recipe again. The cake didn't taste badly, and it would work well if you need a dense cake (one with very sweet frosting or maybe one with lots of fruit on top), but as a yellow cake, it didn't really satisfy.

I have also made this cake and it is my second time but I must say I read the reviews first to get every ones opinion as to be sure. And I must say the advice given to sift the flour or do a water bathe was actually helpful the first time I did the water bath and it was sooo moist, now I have sifted the flour and I'm sure it will come out great, Good recipe, Which I used to improvise a Strawberry Cheesecake literally, after cake cooling I iced with Jello Pudding instant fat free Cheesecake and topping with crushed/ sliced strawberies, cake was gone in an hour but today is Easter and I have about 8 guest coming all with request for this cake thanks so much for such a tasty and easy recipe, I will post pic soon of my Jello Puudding Strawberry Cheesecake

Very good cake! Mine turned out pretty dense, but I was making a pineapple upside down cake, so that was fine (and I did NOT follow any of the recommendations on ways to make it lighter). I used an equal amount of butter in place of the shortening, and followed other reviewers with the 2tsp baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. My cook time was drastically increased, but I'm sure that had much more to do with the way I had to cook it and how thick the cake was in the cast iron pot. Overall, this recipe is EASY and pairs beautifully with Anne's "Pineapple Upside-Down Cake VII." Thanks, Foxy!!

This recipe was actually pretty good!   I did note from a previous review to reduce the baking time and add less baking powder.  MOIST RESULTS.  Just don't mix your batter for too long.  Take your time and always always..add a little more vanilla.  Trust me!

This recipe was delicious! I followed others and substitued butter for the shortening; I made cupcakes and they came out better than the box mix. I followed others advice and sifted the dry ingredients and used a stand mixer to thoroughly cream then beat all the ingredients. I started with a one egg recipe, but my kids tasted them (even without frosting) and asked for more. I only gave four stars because I want to try other recipes, but most recipes for cupcakes seem mixed.

This cake recipe makes a cake you can anchor a boat with.  I made it (exactly as instructed) for a family gathering.  They were not so happy with the cake at first.  It was dry and dense.  Luckily, the cake is VERY absorbent and we soaked it in brandy and had a few laughs.

This is a great basic recipe.  I did make a few changes to lower the sugar content and make it moister which anyone can copy pretty easily:

1.Exchanged one cup of splenda for 1 cup of sugar
2.Used 1/2 cup of no sugar added vanilla yogurt Its all I had on hand at the time but plain yogurt would work too.  I add the yogurt last and its beat on high for 2 minutes.
3.Where it calls for 2 cups of flour I the equivalent of  1 cup of cake flour.  I always sift my dry ingredients together.  I think this makes the difference on how the cake turns out.
4.Butter instead of shortening.   Fine if you have to use shortening, but at least used the butter flavored stuff.
5.Used 1/2 cup of heavy cream, 1/2 cup regular milk. You can also use powdered milk in place of regular milk.
6.If you notice your stove doesn’t hold a steady temperature, use a water bath.

I let my cakes cook for 20 minutes before I first check them.  If you have timer on your oven, they're wonderful to use.  

I always let my cakes cool in the pan on a wire rack, turning it out of the pan when I can pick up the pan with my bare hands.  I garnished with a homemade cheesecake pudding and some fruit.  To keep it from drying out cover it as soon as possible.

This cake holds up very well and is quite dense! This cake recipe begs for someone to be creative, so go for the gusto!  Instead of vanilla flavoring, try something different like lemon or orange or coffee or even cinnamon!

The taste was ok, I added some almond extract to the cake instead of vanilla extract. But quite frankly, this turned out to be more of a large cookie than a cake; it was hard, quite dense.

I made this cake today and it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  I used the waterwell method and it was moist but my cake kind of collapsed.  I am a new baker so it may be my fault.  I am not sure if pans affect this, but it could be I used the wrong pan.  I did notice when it came out of the oven it did smell a lot like cornbread.  I do have to say my husband liked it, he couldn't stop raving.  I will make this cake again and try a different pan.  I didn't think it was bad for my first try at a yellow cake :)

This recipe came out a little dry for me. I have very little baking experience and don't even know what to sugggest to change it..more milk? For the mixing the sugar and shortening (I did half butter and half shortening) part, I mixed them for a looong time and they never did get 'light and fluffy'. Apparently there's a trick for that, but I don't know it. Maybe that was the problem.

Cake was a bit dry... you need a really good frosting to go with it!  Not bad, but I probably won't keep the recipe.

This is a very forgivable recipe. I was making it to use with strawberries and whipped cream, and I didn't have much time and kept getting interrupted.  I wasn't sure if I had put in one or two teaspoons of baking powder. Then I read the recipe wrong and started to put in 2 cups of milk instead of one. Only used one and a half cups when I realized what I had done. Threw some more flour in and beat it quite a bit! It was a little dry but otherwise delicious and the strawberries made it perfect. I used all butter.  Will definitely  
make it again. My family loved it.

I made this with oil this time instead of shortening, since I didn’t have any on hand, and with buttermilk instead of plain milk. No bitterness from the baking powder, which I’m normally very sensitive to!

I made this for my youngest daughter's 32nd birthday and everyone really liked it.  I went so far as to trim off the tops of the layers while she and my son-in-law were out to dinner.  My granddaughters ate the trimmings and loved it! I used a 3 tier cake pan and poured simple chocolate ganache over each later.  Topped off with gag candles and it was a hit when they came to pick up the girls!

I been using this receipe using a cup for cup all purpose gluten free flour I have  a gluten intolerance the cake comes out amazing this is the receipe I use  I have also from time to time  added a box of  your favorite pudding  mix cake always came out .
Sometimes if the batter was  was to heavy I would add just a little more milk  or apple sauce .
Cake was moist and tasted great  I give it a 5 stars  
Depending on your oven and we’re you live might take a little longer to bake just sick I tooth pick in  if nothing shows up on the stick cake is done .

Made the gluten free version and loved it! I was afraid this would not turn out well after reading some of the reviews. For first attempt at making it GF, I made the following changes: 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, increased vanilla to 2 tsp, increased baking powder to 4 tsp, and topped with whipped cream cheese icing. I mixed ingredients exactly as instructed, texture is beautiful and cake is very moist. All changes were preferences and based on my personal, very limited experience making GF version of recipes that always came out either too dry or with a crumbly outer texture and dense almost raw middle. I may try this recipe again exactly as it’s printed and update review.

I will not be making this recipe again. I always sift my flour so I didn’t run into similar problems of the cake being dense and dry as others has suggested. But as others have suggested the baking soda is way to much.

I don't usally review a recipe if I make changes to it. I needed a cake I could make dairy free, I've made this cake 5x now. I use coconut milk and coconut oil for the shortening. I seen other's  sub butter. This cake is yummy it's a great cake for a base. We made pineapple upside down, apple caramel. It would do well with add-ins in the batter like carrot raisin cake or just add a little cinnamon and a crumb topping befor baking. If ur looking for that soft springie cake u get in a box scratch cakes rarely achieve that.  Don't over bake ur cake

I am a cake decorator and I use the base recipe all the time I have made some other variations like making a chocolate chip cake and everyone always says how get my cakes are I do use cake flour for tier cakes because I need them to hold the weight but this is a great recipe I do beat my sugar with my shortening and then add eggs so I mix it slightly different but over all a great recipe

I substituted with butter, it's in the oven. I can tell by the consistency of batter it's going to be a slam dunk!

Ok so I wish I took it out of the oven sooner. Taste wise it was perfect and true very fluffy!! But it only took 30 minutes versus 45. I took it out at 40 and the bottom burned. It was my first time trying this cake so I will make it again, just not bake long enough.

I followed this recipe precisely but I baked mine in a bundt cake pan instead of a 9x13. I was a little worried since it was for Thanksgiving but it turned out perfectly. Moist and delicious and people enjoyed it. I made a lemon glaze to drizzle on it. Yummy!!! 5 stars for recipe simplicity; I already had everything in the cupboard and fridge.

Very moist and flavorful!  Heads up, my 2 ~ 8” layers took  only 26 minutes to bake perfectly. Leaving this cake in the oven too long will dry it out.  The alterations I made was 3 tsp baking powder and buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Thanks for sharing!

Used this for cupcakes. Used butter instead of shortening, and baked 25 minutes. Should have been even shorter probably. This turned out more like angel food cake than yellow cake. It was still good (it didn’t TASTE bad), just a different texture than expected. Light and fluffy instead of moist and crumbly like I’m used to with yellow cakes. It wasn’t overly dry, but I wouldn’t say it was moist either. Overall it’s still edible, just not what I was expecting.

I made this cake. The taste was great but, the cake was a bit more crumbly than I prefer. But, I had to split the layers for a lemon meringue cake recipe which may have contributed to that. Easy to prepare and baked up nicely.

Ok, so this recipe is quick and easy, except I substituted real butter for lard, and after everything is mixed well I add 1/4 cup mayonnaise. Best cake I have ever had. Fattening as heck, but go big or go home. Great with PB frosting or Lemon glaze.

It was very good.  Used vegetable oil as was suggested by many and whipped the egg whites, then folded in.  Did not change anything else.  Made this to use as strawberry shortcake and it was delicious.  Plenty sweet especially with the strawberries.

Made this using butter (had no shortening)  and sifting twice. The cake itself was delicious but it was more like a poundcake than a light and fluffy cake. Will still make it.

This is a perfect yellow cake, but only if you DO NOT bake it for longer than about 22 minutes!!! The baking time is just so wrong on this recipe, and it’s a shame because people are going to make this wonderful cake and then dry it out and burn it if they follow the baking time instructions. Check it after 22 minutes!

lacked favor, and I even added 1/4 more vanilla favoring.
Very dense and dry. It held its form and it looked great because it was so dense, it would be good for a staging but not for eating.
will not make again

I made the cake tripling the recipe for a grad party. I put it in the oven and then started reading the comments. I was floored at the bad reviews. I am glad I did not read the review first otherwise I would not have made this recipe. I followed it exactly as shown and it came out moist and delicious. I used a cream cheese frosting.

Love this recipe. Made it with butter not shorting. Cut recipe in half using two eggs and two tsp baking powder for a 8x8 glass pan. I needed a scratch cake recipe to make rhubarb cake with cream. It turned out better then when I've made this recipe with a box cake mix in 9x13 pan. Thank You

A simple white (yellowish) cake for your imagination to influence on. I cut the recipe in half to make a single cake, cut the baking time down too. I also added lemon zest and a tablespoon of lemon juice to make a lemon enhanced cake for my recipe.

I use this recipe to make gluten free pineapple upside down cake.  This recipe is perfect  for making gluten free. 

It is fluffy and moist, stays fluffy and moist.  I switch out the milk for pineapple juice, of course.  And it is perfect.

My non gluten free friends love it also, can't tell any difference, when using gluten free flour (I use Pillsbury gluten free flour).

I halved the recipe, used all butter, 2 eggs,  and subbed out the milk for strawberry soda and added a half cup of chopped strawberries. I baked in a round cake pan and frosted with cream cheese frosting. Absolutely delicious and very moist.

I usually don't combine all the ingredients, but this time I did, whipped it all together for about three to five minutes, the consistency of the batter was so satiny almost like my angel food 12 egg white cake. And the texture o.m.g.  to die for.

Follow the directions exactly and the cake is very flowery tasting. In my opinion not very edible. I guess I'll be going in finding another cake recipe.

I've made it twice. Both time my cakes have been deflated in the middle. They taste delicious but are rather unsightly. I've check my baking powder to make sure it's good & ive followed the recipe to a T.

I read many reviews before making this cake. I thought it was a great recipe. There are reasons for cake coming out dense. If you follow this recipe completely and understand baking, there should be no reason for coming out with a dense cake. I whipped each egg entry, which helped in lightening up some. I was ask to make a cake topper for a wedding. I gave them the choice between two cakes. One was a box cake. They chose this one. My now go to cake recipe. Thanks!

Unfortunately I have to agree with many others, this turned out very dry and I also think it tastes similar to corn bread.

This turned out well with slight adjustments. It was moist (so moist in fact I wish id used a cake liner as it cracked when i tapped it out of pan to frost).
Its a great little cake to make if like me your craving cake but have no mix. And in fact id say id prefer this over a box mix because its not overly sweet as they are. With that Ill give my adjustments. I subbed shortning with unsalted butter. I used 1/4 cup more milk (batter was extremely thick is why i did so) and i took the baking powder down to 3 teaspoons.
With that said...if your going to do a very very sweet frosting id say leave sugar as directed. However if your making a less sweet icing id up the sugar in the cake by 1/3 to 1/2 cup more than directed. I did notice while warm it has a slight eggy taste which could be why some say it tastes like cornbread. But once cooled the "eggy" taste disapears. Over all I enjoyed it. The husband went back for seconds. Its in my rpbox as a keeper :)

This cake taste like a somewhat sweet cornbread without the corn meal. It really needs to be sweeter to be considered a dessert cake. I think if it has more sugar, more vanilla extract, and maybe a 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening, it would be better. I won't make this recipe again, unless I edit the ingredients.

FABULOUS!  

I did substitute 1/2 of shortening for butter and used butter flavoured shortening.  

Came out amazing! Super moist with light vanilla taste. Will be fun to try adding subtle flavours next time.

It's a really good recipe. Personally, I use less sugar or substitute coconut palm sugar or brown sugar or a combo. The recipe is such an easy one to pull off for amateaur bakers such as myself. Goes great with a cheese cake frosting.

This is a great starter recipe! Came out moist and very close to tasting like ones from the box. I made no adjustments at this time, but plan on making it again with some little extra flavors added in. My family loved this recipe. It's a keeper!

Followed the recipe with the exception of butter instead of shortening and only 3 teaspoons of baking powder. I also added a store bought can of Caramel Apple pie filling to the batter. I spayed a 13x9 glass dish and baked in a convection oven @ 325 for 40 minutes...IT CAME OUT GREAT. Moist, fluffy and a beautiful golden brown. Topped it with a cream cheese frosting

I made this for the basis of strawberry short cake.  My husband likes a basic yellow cake.  I usually make a hot milk cake, but felt like trying something different.  I made this exactly as the recipe states, with shortening, 1 1/2 cups sugar and 3 1/2 tsp baking powder.  It baked in 5 min. less than the recommended shortest time, i.e., 35 min.  In general, the cake was quite dry.  It was also very sweet.  I agree with other posters that it had a rather metallic taste due to the baking powder.  I don't think I'll make it again.  I will say, however, that the dryness was overlooked b/c it allowed a lot of our juicy strawberry topping (homemade) to soak in.  I would not eat the cake plain or frosted, though.

I made it, and it turned out slightly dry. To be fair, this was probably due to over-baking it, but I had only put it in for 35 minutes. Next time, I will probably put it in for about 30 minutes, and maybe add an extra egg. Overall, the taste was amazing, and it's excellent with chocolate frosting.

I made this with a full half cup of butter and it was very good. I make this cake if people request cupcakes for parties as they hold moisture very well. The only issue was that they dry out very quickly after a day or two. I would recommend 1/3 a cup of butter and 1/6 a cup of oil. That's about 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons of oil.

I made this cake tonight, it tasted very good, even with out icing. I did cut back on the baking powder to 2 tsp and plus i separated the eggs added them at the end. Plus with a lot of extra mixing till smooth. It came out great. Will use this recipe again. I have a fig tree, plus my sister in law has a pear tree. Maybe i can figure a way to incorporate those into them. Any ideas?

This is the first yellow cake I've made from scratch. I changed it up a bit by adding 2 egg yokes and using heavy cream instead of milk (had some leftover).I also reduced the baking powder to 3tsp.  It is absolutely delicious!  It is a dense cake.  I sifted the flour/BP/salt before mixing it in. 

Great base recipie!

This was amazing! I substituted the shortening for butter and did a teaspoon less baking powder, since 3 1/2 seemed like a lot to me. The result was a wonderful, beautiful cake that went really well with a strawberry topping. It was gone in minutes.
Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out quite well. It is a moist cake which I used to make a pineapple upside down cake. A lot better tasting than a store bought mix.

This cake was great although I made a few changes : instead of just 1/4 of a cup of butter  and  1/4 a cup of shorting ,I used 1/2 of a cup of butter  and 1/4 of a cup of shorting. I also had to beat it with an electric beater to get it right texture.Even though 
I sprayed and greased the pan well it still stuck. So this is a good recipe if you like to work really hard. It took me about an hour and fifteen minutes to make the batter alone.
for cupcakes you should bake it for at least 23:00 minutes and then check on it.

I needed a yellow cupcake recipe and I was in a hurry so I didn't look around too much. I should have. This was so bad. I followed the directions perfectly. They came out flat. They don't taste like cake at all. Should have read the reviews first.

I am a pie person, when it's my birthday there's no need for cake. I am trying to make memorable birthdays for my little girls though. Today was one of my daughter's birthdays, her first birthday, and I didn't have time to run to the store to buy cake mix, so I searched for a scratch recipe to use instead. Found this one and per some suggestions, I used half shortening and half butter (chilled) and sifted my dry ingredients. Beat in whites first then added yolks to beat in after whites were fluffed. This was SUCH a delicious cake!!! I don't think I can go back to using boxed cake mix ever again. It's like boxed hair dye vs professional grade hair color... Richer, and more control and much more desirable. I don't know if I've ever eaten so much cake in my life (I was ravenously eating it out of my round baking dish, no frosting needed!!!) I'm going to be dreaming about this and crave it soon again. Can't wait to share it with friends!!

I really like this recipe! When I made it, I had a time limit of two hours, but since it was so quick and simple, the baking was done in only an hour! The batter can also be very easily colored. I would definitely make this cake again.

1-29-2016 ~Even tho’ I added extra fat when I used 1/2 c. shortening and 4 T. butter, and an extra egg since yellow cakes are notorious for being dry, this cake still wasn’t exactly what I’d call super moist.  And until or unless I come across a yellow cake that IS, the best I can say about it is, “It was okay.”  I also reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp. and the salt to 1/2 tsp.  Both proved to be necessary modifications.

The cake was okay, but not great.  We still enjoyed the cake but for the effort of making a cake from scratch, I was hoping for more.  It was a little dry, perhaps too much baking powder as other reviewers noted.  I'd alter it, maybe add an extra egg next time.
2nd time I added an egg and did one teaspoon less of baking powder and cut back the time 10 minutes.  This is an okay basic cake for beginners, which was what I was looking for , kids enjoyed it but not out of the park amazing, maybe a few more tweaks would improve it.

OK, I am compelled to write a review and it earns a  5 *-* rating.  This cake is moist and the taste is spot on & soooo much better than the box mixes. I make Cranberry Orange Muffins using a box yellow cake mix as my base BUT this morning I see I am out of box mix. So I look & find this recipe & give it a try. Now some of you critics out there might say this is not a FAIR RATING BUT rest assured that IF you do not have a great base to start with, chances are you are not going to have a desirably tasty outcome! I used this recipe for my Cranberry Orange muffins and they turned out WONDERFUL!! I had to laugh at some of your reviews that said this cake tasted like cornbread! Are you kidding? Thank you so much for sharing this recipe FOXY!!! Great recipe and will be my go-to yellow cake from here on out. No more box mix for me. :-)

I gave this recipe 4 stars because 3.5 tsp of baking powder is definitely way too much. I made the recipe using 2 tsp of baking powder, as other reviewers recommended, and it turned out very well. After adding each egg I beat the mixture on medium-high using my Kitchen-Aid stand mixer until the egg was well incorporated and a pale yellow, so maybe 1-2 minutes. When adding the milk and dry ingredients alternately, I started and ended with flour. I'm not sure if this makes a different but I have a great  pound cake recipe that states you must start and end with adding flour. I baked the batter as cupcakes for 16-18 minutes and they turned out beautifully. Definitely use the vegetable shortening, not butter, and you will have a perfectly moist yellow cake. Great recipe, just DON'T use the 3.5 tsp of baking soda as directed.

I enjoyed this cake. Next time I will substitute half of the shortening with butter for more flavor. I accidentally over baked it (timer issue) and it's still delicious.

I just made this cake it is very good I don't understand the negative reviews sift your flour and make sure your milk....eggs...and butter are room temperature if you use butter or margarine instead of shortening see if that helps. will make this again . For diabetics I used Splenda sugar blend it worked great.

This recipe is a no-fail one for beginners like me.  I used all shortening and King Arthur all purpose flour, which I know has higher protein, but it turned out soft.  I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup since  Can you believe it?!

I used two sticks of butter instead of the shortening. This cake  was DELICIOUS...nice and moist! To quote my 10 year old son, "That cake is the best cake I've ever had!" Lol

This cake turned out very well on the first try. After reading a few reviews, I used margarine instead of shortening, reduced the baking soda to 2 tsp, and used a little less salt. Also added a hint of almond extract, and beat mixture very well. I baked in two 9" round pans, and baked for twenty minutes even. This cake only takes like an hour to cool completely on a rack! They came out of the pans super easily after less than five minutes. ( I use PAM Baking spray, already has flour in it and its great for everything.) Cakes were a little thin, and the crunchy edges needed to be trimmed, but lovely moist, fluffy texture. Trimmed edges still make a delicious snack, but I don't like it mixing with the fluffy texture of the cake, and I wanted a smaller cake. Filled it with low fat cool whip(A little less than half a tub) mixed with diced strawberries. Topped with more of the cool whip and sliced strawberries. Loved it!

Have to agree with previously posted review that 3.5 teaspoons of baking powder is too much and made the cake more savory than sweet. Otherwise, this a nice quick recipe.

I did not like this recipe at all. I wanted yellow cake to make with my friends and once we cooked it, it was barely sweet at all and tasted just like corn bread. it was dry and crumply.

I followed the instruction to a t. It turned out awful. The taste wasn't all that bad but the texture was sponge-like. It burned very easily to the side of my pan. Like literally within the first  15-20 minutes. dy.

This recipe was most delicious. The texture was very good. I halved the recipe, used it to make a pineapple mandarin upside down 9x9 cake and cut the baking time to 20 minutes. Also, I used egg substitute to cut down on cholesterol.

This is a very good cake, I do not understand all tge bad reviews. Ive made it two times, i decided to make it because I was out of cocoa. It doesn't take much to make it. It tastes good. Ill be making it again too.I also used butter instead of shortening, because i was out of shortening, followed the recipe exactly.

My sister and I tried making this from scratch, but it was definitely not what we thought. We followed the recipe exactly as it's posted except for the time, we baked it for 30 mins. Well the cake came out very dense not moist and of all it had a taste exactly like Cornbread. Not gonna be using this again.

Very dry. Not much of a yellow cake. I make scratch cakes all the time and i think a box mix would have been more moist. I would knock 5 minutes off the time to start with.

I just made this recipe. It gave me a 9 inch cake and a pie pan sized cake. For years I have been putting off making a cake from scratch but this recipe (along with all the reviews I read) really made me feel confident in my abilities. 

Here are some things I did that the recipe did not:

I used a fourth less flour and whisked my dry ingredients thoroughly. 

I used only 2 tps of baking powder and a 1/2 tps of salt.

I also used 1 cup of honey butter melted and poured into the sugar which i beat with electric mixer

I used egg whites and saved the yolks for very last. 

I then added a 1/2 of a cup of flour to ever 1/4 cup of milk every time and beat that in until all the flour and milk was gone and the batter well beat, 

I then added my vanilla, and eggs yolks beat them in and then stirred in some chocolate chips. 

I baked it at 350 for 35 minutes and no longer.

I've only ever made cakes from boxes and never from scratch.  I wanted to try making a cake from scratch but most recipes I found called for cake flour. With no $ to get that I found this recipe. Despite my baking powder being outdated the cake came out fluffy and evenly baked just as the directions said. Only thing I found lacking was that even with the vanilla the cake seemed to have no flavor at all. The cream cheese frosting I put on top had a million times more flavor than this cake. Otherwise turned out pretty good for my first attempt at a cake from scratch.

I followed the recipe but substituted the shortening for butter. Came out delicious and subbed vanilla for lemon extract,  had lemon cake and the the family loved
 This time switched out vanilla for almond extract.

This is a versatile recipe. By subbing in different extracts or flavor oil you have a new cake each time. I typically don't use shortening but margarine and butter have both worked fine.

I creamed the shortening and sugar very thoroughly, sifted the dry ingredients before adding them (just as the recipe instructed), and baked the cake for only 35 minutes.  However, we still found this cake to be a bit dry and lacking in taste.  I made chocolate frosting using Hershey's Cocoa, which helped to redeem the cake. Perhaps using butter instead of shortening would help, but I don't know that I'll give it another try.  I'll probably just go back to the ease of box mixes.

I have it in the oven now for my first attempt at this recipe but I have to question the 40 min. cook time. That seems like way too much time. I also used lemon instead of vanilla.

Baking time is WAY too long.  I bake a lot and found this recipe because I was needing something with fewer ingredients than what I usually make.  This has potential if you make a few changes however next time I'm out of buttermilk I think I'll just try one of the other higher rated yellow cake recipes on here.

This is the first time I made a cake without Uncle Duncan or Aunt Betty's help. It still had a little baking powder taste but the chocolate frosting covered that up easily. If you follow the instruction, I don't see how other came out with cornbread like cake. Mine came out very moist and not too sweet. So thanks for helping me on my journey of scratch baking.

This is such a wonderful cake. Is so versatile. I use pineapple juice instead of milk and butter instead of shortening and I melt butter (2 TBSP) in cake pan and add brown sugar then put crushed pineapple over the brown sugar. I pour cake batter over that. It is such a hit at my daughter's job and for my family..thanks for sharing

WAY to flour-y! Also, baking time for me was 35 minutes. I made 6 cupcakes and a 9x9 cake... both were a little on the dense side. The cupcakes more so, because they're smaller and less concentrated. Also, I cut the baking powder to 2 teaspoons instead of 3 1/2. That sounded a little too much! Overall, I would make again with some minor adjustments. Did make the house smell AMAZING however- always a plus!

Great recipe!! So easy to follow, but I made the mistake of adding 
3-1/2 cups of sugar instead of 1-1/2 cups.. Oh no you say.. Well I fixed my mistake by adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour, one 3oz package of jello lime flavor gelatin, an extra tablepoon of vanilla, lemon & pineapple extract.. Made cupcakes instead of a cake. Added orange frosting, and design them with candy corn, white chocolate with peanut butter chips. Wow and they were a big hit at my son's school Halloween bake sale!!

I followed the directions for this cake exactly. The cake tasted fine.  It was a little dense (which was not a problem) But it stuck horribly to my pan!  I had to "glue" it together with icing.  The end result was okay, but I won't be using this for a cake again.

This recipe came out excellent.  I did substitute butter for half of the shortening and I also substituted self-rising flour for all-purpose floor.  I left out the baking powder.  Batter tasted wonderful and cake came out great.  It rose wonderfully and smelled great topped with chocolate icing wow. :)

Made this recipe for the first time today... I followed the directions exactly EXCEPT I made it into a peach upside-down cake. It turned out very well. The cake itself is a little dry...but it works well with the peach/brown sugar topping.

this was my first attempt at making a cake from scratch, made it for my coworker's baby shower.  the cake came out somewhat dense, but i think i overcooked it.  the flavor is great and it was easy to make.  i think next time i will make some adjustments on the bake time and perhaps add a water bath, but i was pleased that my first cake wasn't a complete disaster :)

It tasted like a scratch cake. I cut the baking powder and substituted the shortening. But i am a person that likes really sweet cake and icing, and this cake was good, just not sweet enough for me.

I used butter instead of shortening, and rice milk instead of regular milk (that's all I had and this was sort of a last second dessert idea..)  It came out delicious!  Very moist, simple cake that tastes great even without frosting.  I used the recipe's amount of baking powder, and it took about 40 to 45 minutes to bake for me (and I'm at a very low altitude) so I'm not sure where others have had problems.  My husband says I must make it again!

I must say that I did not read any reviews before trying this recipe. All I did extra was add bananas and apples to give it a little extra. It turned out very moist and very delicious. Thank you for sharing with recipe with everyone.

For some reason, this recipe turns out tasting more like cornbread than yellow cake. Even so, it still got eaten. Definitely not what I was expecting though.

Not the best, but not the worst. It was pretty good. BUT  the shortening gave it a bit of a strange taste. But i did find out it works great as the yellow cake for pineapple upside down cake:)

I loved it! I thought I did something wrong-- it was a very liquidy batter. I added 2 tsps of flour to give it some more texture, then I added about 1/4 cup of brownie mix to make it chocolately. It's a large cake, and it's very moist. Totally saving this recipe.

My 3 year old & I just made this cake.  We followed the recipe exactly, except we added 1/2 tsp more vanilla.  We had fun counting while we gradually added the flour - we started with only 4 scoops, then mixed, added a little milk, etc until we were up to 12 scoops - and it looked really nice and fluffy.  I wondered how it would turn out (esp with a 3 yr old helping ;).  We only baked it 25 min, checked it & gave it another 5 min and it was perfect.  Her little sister woke up from nap right as it was coming out of the oven, perfect snack!  We ALL thought it was great!  Not too dry at all!  Just take your time to beat in each egg well & to add in that flour & milk alternately & gradually.  But I do think if it would have baked it even a few more minutes it would have been too dry.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe!

Yum Yum! this cake was great! It turned out super moist and really tasty! It was for my hubby's birthday and he's not a fan of chocolate, which put me in a perdiciment :o Anyway, the only thing was I made it in 2 cake tins and the middle collapsed a bit, lol but it could be because there was too much cake mix in the tins after doubling the recipe. But will definately make it again! Thank you ^_^

Really good, but too sweet, more like cookie sweet, lol, but it was moist and fluffy.  I used 3/4 butter and 1/4 oil.  I ran out of eggs so I use egg substitute and it still was yummy, kids loved them, I'll make it again when I want a fast and eazy recipe.

I just used this recipe for the second time today. My first attempt was an epic failure. The cake didn't come out as cake at all.. it was more like cornbread. It was dry and yellow like cornbread. I followed the instructions and ingredients exactly so I figured it was because I didn't have enough elbow grease to mix properly. Tonight, I tried again using a hand mixer. The cake baked beautifully. It looked like cake and smelled more like cake than the first one, but I was worried when I smelled a hint of cornbread. We tried it out after it cooled and I frosted it.... It was not as great as most people (who altered the recipe, I've noticed) on here said it was. It was fairly moist but it still had the faint taste of cornbread mixed in and not much cake flavor. I don't think I'll be trying this recipe again.

This cake is delicious. I overlooked the instructions that called for creaming the sugar and butter, my bad. I mixed all the dry ingredients including the sugar(i didn't have enough sugar so I used 1cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of powdered, then I added the wet ingredients. I also added some flaked coconut for variety. Baked for about 45 minutes. I came out great.  I gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipe just a little

This cake came out AWESOME..My neighbors tried it and said it was excellent, this coming from a man that doesn't always eat sweets. In fact, he asked for another slice. Thank you sooo  much!!

I made this cake for the cowboys.  The first time a tried a layer cake.  Bad idea.  The layers were too thin.  The batter seemed to separate on me.  I made it again, this timing using 1 1/2 cups milk and a bit more sugar and baked in a 9x13 as suggested.  It was very moist and tasty

I needed a simple cake recipe to make from scratch with very few ingredients.  This fit the bill and it was delicious too! I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and only used 2 tsp. baking powder and it came out wonderfully. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this turned out. Will be keeping this recipe.

This recipe was OK, I think I was expecting a thicker cake,  since there is so much baking powder in it. And I suggest to watch the timing. I set the timer to 35min and it was a lil too done by then. :( oh well...NEXT!

I thought this was terrible.  I did not have a problem with moisture at all.  I had the opposite problem.  The cake kept sinking in in the middle.  I made it three times making sure I did not do something wrong.  Maybe it's my oven but I have never had a problem like this before.  When I served it my 7 year old asked "why did you put chocolate frosting on corn bread"  and i had to admit it kinda did taste like corn bread.

I altered the recipe a little bit to make a white cake and a strawberry cake for Independence Day, and everyone LOVED it! People raved. I did substitute half the shortening for butter, as the subtitle recommended. It turned out very well for me.

This recipe really was very easy. It was my first time making a cake from scratch and it was quite simple. I used butter instead of shortening and my cake still turned out fluffy and yummy. Thanks!

I live in Georgia and baked this in a free standing convectional oven. I am not sure if ovens & location vary in baking results.Anyways, This cake was easy and not over sugary with a perfect consistency . I put rasberry jam between layers and served the next day. What a cake! Next time I will layer with homemade pinnaple preserves,baste with brandy simple syrup & frost with coconut frosting for a fancy celebration.

It tastes like a sweet corn bread to me as well.  It had a lot of air bubbles in the center and eventually cake fell in the middle.  I used 9 x 13 inch pan and had to bake it longer to be done inside. (Maybe it should be baked in two pans.) When I checked it at the 45 minute mark, it had fallen.  Will wait to see what it tastes like when it cools for a fair assessment.  Cake is moist though, without water bath.

I made this one tonight (cupcakes) and incorporated a couple of the reviewers' recommendations - I used two teaspoons of baking powder only and baked them in a water bath.  I also started checking on them after twenty-two minutes and ended up baking them about thirty-two. Unfortunately they still came out very dense and heavy - I wish I could figure out what all the people that raved about the recipe did right that I didn't!

The cake is really moist and delicious and doesn't require frosting at all. The only problem I ran into was how the cake fell in the center. Otherwise, an excellent recipe!
