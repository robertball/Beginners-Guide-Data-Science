I love this, it is so good!  A little tip: you can also cook it right in the can.  If you are cooking a pot of beans, etc., you can bring the liquid to a boil and then simmer for about 3 hours or so.

It is a wonderful caramel color, but it still tastes exactly like sweetened condensed milk.  

It needs something. Perhaps vanilla or a liqueur would be nice.  I would recommend making the real thing. This isn't doing much for me.

Definitely add vanilla extract or your favorite extract or liqueur, and it's perfect.  I used the homemade vanilla-rum extract I made from this website and drizzled the dulce de leche over eggnog cheesecake (also from this website).

Very easy to make!! Just took longer than the recipe stated but the end result was the same!  Topped the Tollhouse pie recipe on this site with it to make a turtle cookie pie!

Absolutely delicious!  Still, the end result was extremely thick - almost too thick to serve.  That may have been b/c I baked it 1/2 hour longer than suggested, so I would say follow the recipe even though your gut is that it needs more baking time.  Over vanilla bean ice cream - lovely!

I think my oven may have been too high because the top layer of the condensed milk started burning. :( 
I agree, a little bit of vanilla extract will make it taste more like dulce de leche and not so similar to condensd milk.
Tip: try your Dulce de Leche with your morning pancakes! Mmmmmm!!

I was so surprised at how good this is!  And easy too.  Just put it in there and set the time and you have a perfect caramel sauce.
