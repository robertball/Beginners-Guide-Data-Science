This is a typical Old French recipe but pound the breast before you season and remember to crack pepper corns fast use the bottom of a small skillet and roll it across the peppercorns for consistant cracking. Also to make your sauce thicker reduce the 35% cream by SIMMERING it for about 8 minutes and add 2 minutes for each stage thicker. also be aware that you can add other seasonings for extra flavours, ie. lemon, sage, thyme and add fresh mushrooms to the sauce, but 1rst saute them slightly.

Very proud to be the first person to review this recipe. I made the chicken ala cream recipe (see reviews) and decided to go ahead and make this one since they were very similar. Very, very good and I have decided to serve this at my Italian wine tasting party next week. It went very well with some Italian wines I opened tonight -- think it must have been the rosemary flavor, which is dominant. It was great to finally have a recipe where I could use my pink and green peppercorns.

Yum!  I made a few modifications to make it a little healthier and it is delicious!  I cooked the chicken in a skillet that I sprayed with a little butter flavored cooking spray, no butter.  When I removed the chicken, I melted 1 tablespoon reduced fat butter in the skillet and added a little bit of flour to make a roux (sp???).  To this I added 1 cup skim milk, the garlic, and fresh rosemary.  After it had cooked down I added some chicken broth (I let the liquid get too low) and cooked it down a little more.  Served the chicken and sauce over white rice with steamed broccoli - yum!

So, so, so rich -- and full of flavor, too. I bought mixed peppercorns in a grinder (very cheap), which has pink, green, black and white. I substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream, and also reduced the amount of butter and cream per a previous reviewer. There was still enough sauce to cover the chicken. This is very easy and quick, and would probably impress your guests. I'll make this again. Thank you, GS!

This dish is absolutely delicious and SO simple!!!  My family loved it -- we'll definitely be making it again soon.  The only thing I would change (and this is just my personal preference) is to decrease the butter and cream a little.  When I doubled the recipe, two cups of cream made more than enough of the delicious sauce.  Delicious!!

This is delicious. I had only black peppercorns; it wasn't a problem.  The taste and texture of the dish is wonderful. I prepared it as written, but may try to cut back on some of the fat content if I make it again. But it's a lovely dish as written and if you're not concerned about the calories, try it. This is a classic preparation (heavy cream, garlic) but the peppercorns and rosemary are a nice variation on the theme. A nice "company" dish as well as a quick mid-week treat for the family.

I loved the creamy herb sauce, but found the peppercorns a hair too spicy for my taste.  (My husband loved it.)  However, I'm still giving it a 5 because it was easy to knock off some peppercorns to reduce the spice, and this was both quick and easy and elegant, which is rare.

My family love this recipe, I however found it a bit too peppery for my taste. I bought a pepper grinder with all the peppercorn colours and just gound it on the breast. I will definately make again but with less pepper.

I didn't have pink or green peppercorns so cut the amount to 1/3 & used 2 tbps mixed peppercorns.  Even then it was WAY too peppery and my husband couldn't eat it.  The sauce was good - I used 35% cream, cut the butter in half, and added lemon, sage, thyme & sliced fresh mushrooms as per a previous reviewer's suggestion.  If I make this again I would simply pepper both sides of the chicken well using my pepper mill.

This was very good, and very quick and easy to make.  I thought the sauce was a little thin but that's an easy fix.

This is a quick and easy recipe!  I've tried a slight variation by grinding a generous amount of peppercorn onto thin chicken cutlets and the result is just as tasty.

This was just "okay".  I was trying to duplicate a similar dish at a local restaurant but came up short... too peppery and kind of bland.  It should also definitely simmer longer.  This is an okay starting point though; when I get it right I'll post it!

Really nice recipe! I was looking for a black pepper and mushroom chicken recipe, and decided to try this with black peppercorns. Not only is it good as written, but it can be tweaked and still doesn't lose its character. I added mushrooms and thyme. The sauce was a bit thick for me; next time I'll add some milk and broth.

This is a great dish to make to impress someone. It is very easy to make and tastes fantastic. The sauce is very, very good. I did just eyeball how much peppercorn to grind on each breast so as not to make them too peppery as other reviews mentioned.I followed this recipe as is and wouldn't change anything. It was absolutely delicious.

Delicious! The first time I made it I got the peppercorns according to the recipe, and it was terrific. The next time I got a 4-peppercorn blend from the grocery store (which was a little cheaper than the pink and green peppercorns) and we actually liked it a bit better. I also added a bit of white wine to the sauce, which was nice. 
A quick recipe with impressive results.

Very easy and quick, especially if you're a working mom.  Looks like you spent a lot of time.  It was bland as other reviewers mentioned so I would add a little salt.  Also decreased butter by half.  Would make again.

I made this last night, I found it somewhat bland, I added a fresh sage leave and a sprig of rosemary to the sauce and simmered a bit longer, it helped but.....  This recipe just didn't do it for me.

This was really good.  I didn't have the fresh peppercorn so I just used ground pepper.  I also added a little bit of flour to thicken up the sauce and it was so yummy.

I thought this was a pretty great recipe, after I had made some of the suggested modifications. My significant other is lactose intolerant, and so I had to cut back on the dairy ingredients used here. I added an extra clove of garlic, and like another reviewer suggested, replaced the cream and half the butter with chicken broth, a tsp. of corn starch to thicken, and lactose-free skim milk. I'd recommend increasing the rosemary to one tbsp., and to definitely decrease the amount of peppercorns by at least half. We only had black peppercorns on hand, so used those.
But all in all, we truly enjoyed how fast this came together and how great it tasted! :-D

This was good but a bit too spicy for me.  I would make this again with less pepper.  I used black pepper as I did not have green or pink.  I used 1% milk in place of the heavy cream to cut down on the fat.  I thickened the sauce a little by adding 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with a little milk.  I think next time I make this (with less pepper) I will cook the chicken in the oven and use only half the butter in the sauce to cut down on the fat some more.

I can't give an entirely fair review as I didn't have rosemary, which is literally in the title, so I substituted thyme, which has a wholly different flavor profile. While I did somewhat enjoy the peppercorns smashed into the chicken, I can't say I loved it, but perhaps with the rosemary, I would have better liked the taste. With the sauce, I added some mushrooms and onions, but that was because I was also using the sauce for some ravioli I was cooking.

Way too much pepper for 2 chicken breasts.  However, the cream sauce saved the day after I scrapped off most of the pepper before serving the chicken.  The next time I make this dish (and I will make it again) I will only use 3 T of the pepper.  Other than that this was recipe was rated "Good" by the man of the house!

That was quite a delicious meal. My one tip would be to use clarified butter, that way it won't burn in the pan. The chicken and the sauce were very flavourful and were very simple to make.

I totally loved this and it was easy to make.  I served it with brown rice and carrots. the sauce was good over the rice. My husband didnt like it as much - I like peppercorns more than he does.
