After making six batches of this recipe in order to perfect it, I would advise the following:

1.  Cook to no more than 234 degrees - if if cooks at higher temperatures, it will be very stiff and somewhat grainy.

2.  It is very important to let the fudge cool in the pan to no more than 120 degrees, 110 is better.  Just leave the candy thermometer in to check this.  This cooling process takes at least an hour, so allow extra time.

3.  For an even smoother fudge, add 2-4 Tbs of cream as you are beating the fudge.  This will make the fudge easier to slice.

4.  Beat for at least 3 minutes with a good quality hand mixer.  It will not look like it has set up when you put it in the pan, but put the pan in the fridge and a few hours later, it will be set.

I don't usually go to this amount of trouble, but the flavor of this recipe is so good, it was worth it - and even with their flaws, eating the trial batches was very tasty.

This recipe will take considerable restraint on my part to NOT EAT THE WHOLE BATCH in one sitting it's so good! Fantastic brown sugar taste with a creamy, smooth and buttery texture. I followed the recipe exactly except skipped the nuts and it turned out perfect.  A couple key things for someone new to candy/fudge making: make sure you don't stir it AT ALL after it comes to a boil and until it's cooled off - take it off the heat and don't touch it.  Otherwise, if you stir while it's boiling or while it's cooling off, you'll start the crystallization too early and it'll end up horribly grainy and even separate.  I use a candy thermometer and take it up to 234 exactly (as other reviewers do)  then let it cool off to 110 without touching it. I then use a hand mixer and beat it on medium-high until it is creamy and really starting to thicken up (consistency pretty thick where you can see the tracks/ribbons from the mixer but still pourable - once at this point it'll firm up quick if you keep beating and you'll have to scrape it out of the pan).  And I know it's a silly detail but I always move the pan around on the counter every minute or so to constantly give it a cooler surface underneath so it sets up a bit quicker although it still took me about 10 minutes today with the mixer.   Thanks for the great recipe!

This fudge turns out soft and creamy with an excellent brown sugar flavor.  Make very sure to let the fudge cool to about 110 degrees before stirring to get it to that creamy texture.

Awesome.  I whipped it for 5 or so minutes on high speed after it was cooled a bit from the stove and that made all the difference.

I made this last night for a dinner party and it turned out perfectly.  One of my guests even drew my aside at the end of the evening and asked for a piece to take home :)  For those who had trouble with this recipe, please keep in mind that fudge is somewhat tempermental, and if you made this recipe the same way every day for a week, it might not turn out every time.  It's just the nature of fudge.  Don't give up; this recipe is perfect as written.

I was inspired by this recipe yesterday to use as the frosting for the caramel cake I was making.  I increased the cream to 1 1/3 cups and cooked the mixture to 236F.  I poured the penuche into a clean mixing bowl without scraping the sides of the pan to cool.   I added 3 Tbsp's of butter to the top of the hot mixture without stirring it in, as it cooled to 110F.  When cool, I added the vanilla and beat the mixture by hand until it was thick enough to spread and frosted the cake.  I used what I needed for the cake and continued to beat what was leftover and scraped it into a buttered mini loaf pan to set up as fudge.  It set-up perfectly.  Excellent flavor and creamy smooth texture.  Will definately make this again.
**NOTE:  regarding graininess..Any implement you put into the candy while cooking but remove and set aside, has to be completely cleaned of any sugar from a previous dip into the boiling candy or it will cause the entire batch to start to crystalize and become grainy or sugary.  When you remove a spoon or whisk, rinse it well and dry it before using it again.  There should be enough time between uses to clean and dry it.. Just sayin!

Love this recipe!  I have made Penuche for years, and when I found this recipe, I was excited as it made a more creamier candy. . . plus it was way more user friendly than mine. . .not AS much stirring, but still, you need to be prepared for a work out, but it is worth it!

Awesome recipe!! My penuche came out light, fluffy and delicious. It tastes like it came from a candy store and was very easy to prepare. I allowed the mixture to cool to 115 degrees and whipped with my Kitchen aid as per a previous review. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe.  Turned out perfect, had a very good flavor and even having to use a candy thermometer, was extremely easy.

I tried making this recipe twice.  The flavor is great.  I'm just having a hard time with consistency.  I used a candy thermometer also, that didn't help.  It seemed to sugary for my liking.  Creamy would be better.

I've made this recipe a few times. It is really good!! To change things up, I left out the pecans and added a 1/4 cup diced candied ginger (from Trader Joes). 
I followed other reviews and heated the penuche to 234* and waited until it cooled to 110* and then whipped it. It always turns out good, too good, I end up eating too much of it!

This is the first time I've tried penuche (usually my sister-in-law makes it).  I followed this recipe, using Chris D. Williams' tips, and it was perfect from the first batch!  As for those people who are having trouble getting it to set up:  well, I can sympathize, because when I made it at home on my gas cookstove, it was great, but now that I'm at a friend's house I made some on her electric stove, and it's different!  It's in the fridge now.  I'm not sure if it's going to set up.  Anyway, this is a GREAT recipe!

I followed these tips and it's sooooo yummy my father says it's the closest thing to his mother's recipe he's ever tasted.   I did not touch it once the sugar was dissolved as per recipe.  Once it became a soft ball in the water I turned off the flame and didn't touch it for almost an hour!  I even put the pan in cool water to help the process, but I understand a drop of water wrecks a bath of fudge so be careful if you try this.  It is soooooo delicious. Thank you very much for this recipe!!!!

Wow! I followed the recipe to the point of beating the cooled mixture and then I used a hand mixer set on medium for 5 minutes as suggested by other reviews. I thought it wouldn't set up but I put it in the fridge and it was perfect, so creamy! Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm going to have to give this recipe another shot, next time following the directions a little more closely.  I didn't let it sit undisturbed like I was supposed to, and I ended up with a very grainy texture.  However, the flavor was incredible definitely worthy of a 2nd try.

I must have done something wrong--even with my new $14.00 candy thermometer!--because it came out hard and grainy (like maple candy). However, the flavor was spot on, and out of this world. In fact, both my husband and I thought the flavor was much better than the that of the "Panocha Fudge" recipe from this same site that we'd also tried.

This penuche nearly duplicates the texture and flavor of my favorite penuche from Wall Drug, S.D. fudge shop!!  It doesn't last very long, even in our household of two. ??  ...For Your Information: if allowed to sit about five days, with foil over the pan, the flavor and texture are much richer.

This is the creamiest fudge I have ever had.  I followed a previous reviewers' advice and heated to 234 exactly and cooled it to 110 exactly, then poured the fudge into a bowl and beat it with a hand mixer until it was creamy. It looks like it's not going to set up, but it does!  Great recipe; thanks for sharing!

It's absolutely delicious but easy to mess up. You absolutely cannot over-cook or under-cook the candy (234) and you must not stir too much while cooking or the candy will become grainy.

Focus is needed in two area's. First, make certain the sugars dissolve completely before they begin boiling. Second, do not beat the candy until it reaches about 110 degrees. Then beat it until it loses its sheen, becomes dull. After that, work quickly to fold in the pecans and get it into a pan because you won't have much time before it really sets.

I discovered this recipe several years ago when I was given my mother's old cookbook and it has become a Christmas tradition at our home. When done properly, it is wonderful!

This might be the best penuche I've ever had, as good as any candy shops have. I followed the suggestions of the reviewers regarding temperature maximums and did add some cream while beating the fudge. Beat with electric mixer for fine minutes and chilled. Came out perfect but I can't stop eating it. I will make this again soon.

First off, the flavor is great! I followed the recipe to the tee (usually I browse the reviews before starting, but I went into this one blind), bringing the fudge to the exact temperature, then cooling it to 110*, as is standard for fudge. When I was beating the fudge, it had a sticky almost butterscotch consistency. After I poured it into the pan and cooled it, it was solid as a rock. It's not particularly grainy, but very solid and not at all creamy. Next time I might add butter while beating it, or cream as another person suggested. Anyway, flavor is great, but consistency needs tweaking.

I'm giving this five stars because I think I messed up a bit somewhere...lol  Mine came out kinda grainy and was a little hard to cut.  Otherwise it had good flavor and I went the extra mile and dipped the cut pieces in chocolate and doused with chocolate sprinkles.  It was a hit at our Cocktail party along with Christmas!

I used my candy thermometer like I always do for fudge. I cooked it to soft ball stage, but it didn't set up properly. Also, it was extremely grainy and sugary. The flavor was good, but the consistency was horrible. It felt like pure hard packed brown sugar. I won't make this one again. I'm still hunting for a penuche recipe.
