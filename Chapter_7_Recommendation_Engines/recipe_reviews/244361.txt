These are great.. Especially when I'm leaning out. I prepped them for the week and had them with cucumber salad and sweet potato chips. No bun. 
I shared this recipe with my personal training clients and bootcamp clients. This is great for people who are used to eating clean.

Looked unappetizing, messy and flavorless.

YUM!  I  thought these were wonderful burgers.  I took out the ground beef from the freezer, let it defrost but when I went to make the burgers - I realized it was ground elk and not beef, so I used that. I did make my burgers a bit smaller so I got 6 out of this recipe. Will make this again with beef and I bet even ground turkey would work well
