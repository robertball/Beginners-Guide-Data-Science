I made this for a party I attended yesterday. I used balsamic vinegar too, didn't peel the eggplants, but DID salt and drain them in a colander an hour before using them. The recipe came out PERFECT, not marinara-ish AT ALL! I served it with toasted pita chips and it was more popular than the regular salsa/chips on the table. EVERYONE raved about it! I will definitely make this again, not only for home enjoyment but for my company's potluck lunches. Easy, elegant, and very yummy. Splurge for pita chips or toast some French or Italian bread and skip the saltines or Ritz crackers.

When I made this I didn't chop up the eggplant small enough to really fit on a cracker or pita chip with much else.... i guess i wasn't really thinking as i was chopping. But, after it cooked, to remedy the situation, i put the whole thing in a food processor.  Man is it good!  It came out as more of a dip, but it's a delicious dip, and so healthy.

Awesome.  I served it on shredded cabbage with a dash of red wine vinegar, a few fresh green olives and plum tomatoes sliced, and topped with shredded parmesan.  Like an exotic "downtown" summer salad. Really fresh and tasty on a sweltering day.  You must try it.

This was very good, but I doubt there was enough for 48 servings there. Once it was done, I made some italian toasts and spread the antipasto over them, sprinkled some parmesian on top and put it back in the oven for about 5 minutes.  It was a big hit at my party.

Fantastic. I don't bother peeling the eggplant, and I personally don't like mushrooms or olives. I substitute zucchini for the mushrooms, and 1-2 tbl of capers for the olives. Instead of the vinegar sugar combo I followed others suggestion and just use balsamic vinegar to taste-1/4 cup probably. If possible I add fresh herbs instead of dried, and cook it longer than 30 minutes, 45 more likely. Great with fresh soft/crusty bread or over pasta.

This is great!! I used to have a roommate whose mom made something like this and I loved it. The recipe sounded akin to what she made but I had no idea what it was called. Anyway, instead of using red wine vinegar I used balsamic vinegar, just a personal preference of mine, but I think it really helped to develop the flavor, and I used a 1/4 cup of it. The only other alterations were more garlic, not peeling the eggplant, and I didn't have oregano and basil at hand but I had italian seasonings, so I used a 1/2 tsp of that, instead. Oh, and I didn't bother to add the sugar since balsamic vinegar already has some sweetness to it.

I did not peel the eggplant because the chore seems so tedious and it came fine. Be sure to place the chopped up eggplant and sprinkle and toss the salt and place in colander for 30 minutes.
This drains the bitter juices from the eggplant. I served this cold on top of crackers (SEE MY PHOTO). I do recommend serving this on top of Ritz crackers if serving to company. TY for the recipe!!
BTW, this recipe is totally vegan too!

This recipe is very light and flavorful.  I served it with fresh mozorella and parmesan on crackers.  Everyone loved it!  I actually roasted it longer than the recipe calls for.  Also, if you can let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of days, the flavors really come together.

This is the recipe that hooked me on the Allrecipes website!  I think it's also called caponata.  Everyone in my family and all our guests love it.  I usually bake it for 45-50 minutes for the eggplant to get tender.  It has been great for the South Beach diet (I fudge on the little bit of sugar.)

What an interesting recipe.  I followed another's advice and used splenda instead of sugar.  I also added a minced jalepeno pepper for some heat.  Next time, I'll add more olives.

Thanks for this fabulous recipe! What a great way to make good use of all the extra garden produce. It all came together so well. Really good hot served with spaghetti.

Loved this recipe. I made it a couple of days in advance of my diner party, and could barely resist eating it before hand. I didn't change anything from the recipe, but next time I will add more mushrooms.

I did like this recipe a lot but it kind of tasted like vegetables in marinara sauce. So its a good base that just needs a little more seasonings to the reds sauce. Also mine turned out a little think. Will make again with a few ajustments. its a keeper though

Almost there, no bell peppers, no mushrooms and no green stuffed olives.   Instead use; sicilian green olives (pitted) and capers.....that is the authentic version of caponata!

I enjoyed this served over roasted spaghetti squash.  As per the reviews, I subbed 2 tablespoons capers for the olives and used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar and sugar.  I made extra to freeze and it still tasted great after having been frozen.

My sister is a professional chef, and she makes a dish like this but with red instead of green peppers, and some diced sundried tomatoes and uses it to marinate white fish and bake them in parcels. Served with rosemary roast new baby potatoes and greek salad it's beautiful. I used this recipe to make the fish dish and this version definitely rivaled hers! Plus if you've any leftovers from that meal, it's beautiful as a salsa with leftover greek salad and lamb meatballs in pita breads.

Quite excellent and very well received at parties.  I tend to add more green olives than recommended because I find they add a nice kick to the flavour

A great way to use fresh veggies from the garden!  This is really easy to make.  I love how the vegetables stay crunchy and I LOVE the green olives.  I stirred in fresh tomato slices (also from the garden!) right before serving and, mmmmmmmm!!!
I think it would also be good warm over pasta.

I made just a couple of changes to this, only because of the contents of my garden and frig -- instead of green bell pepper, I used poblanos, and instead of stuffed green olives, I used kalamatas.  WOW!!!  Extremely yummy (and healthy, too!) An absolute hit.

This was an excellent and easy dish to make. Next time I will double the recipe, as it was eaten so quickly.

Excellent dish!  Amazing depth of flavor.  We are vegetarians and will make any good veggie dish into a meal.  That is what we did with this and it was wonderful.

This is delicious! I really enjoyed it.  I added marianated mushrooms instead of plain, left out the sugar, and used balsamic vinegar in place of red wine.  I also used red pepper instead of green as a personal taste preferance and completed the italian spice trilogy by adding thyme.  Served it with parmesan and garlic pita chips and it was awesome.  I may cook it a bit longer the next time to soften the eggplant a bit more but other then that I was really pleased with how it turned out.

Excellent appetizer.  I used roasted red peppers instead of green bell peppers and served it with pita chips.  A real crowd pleaser.

It was delicious!  After reading many comments, I decided to substitute the balsamic vinegar as many suggested. I was skeptical about the green olives but it turned it perfect!!  I served it straight out of the oven over white rice. I can’t wait to try it again as a dip!  Yum!!

Fabulous recipe! I had a HUGE bounty of white eggplant and this dish did not last long in our house. I did make substitutions but only because I did not have some items on hand. I subbed: red pepper for green pepper, capers for green olives and white eggplant for the typical purple. 

Only modification is that you need to cook it for much longer than is noted in the directions. 

This is a keeper!

So good and healthy. This is a keeper!  Even before I baked it, ate it as is with pita chips and it was great. Microwaved the eggplant then pulsed it in the food processor. Stir fried the other chunky stuff in a pan and combined with eggplant and seasonings. Easy.

Great alone, on crackers, or with other vegetables.  It really does go well with anything.
Made it for friends and they all loved it!!!
Used red peppers instead of green peppers and left out the olives.
Used a large skillet, which really was needed as it makes a large amount.  Five of us ate it  and the rest I froze for the next time I have company.

I make this a lot for parties. It goes a long way and is delicious! My vegan friends can eat this as a meal over pasta. There is no reason to change a thing. I usually do a little something to make it my own but, this recipe is perfection and nothing needs to be changed!

Unlike my usual modus operandi, I made no changes to the recipe except I didn't realize it was supposed to be covered the first 10 minutes of baking. That oversight doesn't seem to have made a difference. This stuff is unbelievably good. I find myself sneaking a bite or two like it's fudge or something. Seriously!

I've made this several times and always am complimented on it. I do double the herbs to give it more flavor. I have passed the recipe on to a friend that asked for it and she told me that she did the same. You can make this recipe with confidence that it will be enjoyed.
