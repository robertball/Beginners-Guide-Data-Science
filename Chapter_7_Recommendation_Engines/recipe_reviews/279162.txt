Excellent!  I will be making it again.  The bacon was a special ingredient which we eat on a rare occasion.   Making it in the spring when asparagus is inexpensive is a plus.  No substitutes.  I would chop the parsley fine.

This might be 4 stars but I didn't use bacon since we don't eat it. Also I did not have plain yogurt so I tried using sour cream which was ok when it was first done but after a while not as good. I will definitely have to use yogurt next time. I just used the whole egg instead of just egg yolks. But one thing I noticed is the recipe doesn't say what to do with the asparagus once the pasta dish is  done. I just dumped it into the pot with the pasta and warmed it up.

This recipe had me at Greek yogurt. The only change I made was to use Sea Shell pasta since I didn't have spaghetti. I love the tang from the yogurt, which really goes well with the fresh parsley. I am definitely making this again!
