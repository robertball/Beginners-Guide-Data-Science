Wonderful. Used 2 and a half large bananas, and bake time was 75 minutes until just done. Moist and awesome.

Really liked this having followed the recipe exactly, but the second go around, I’d make a few changes: I would double the bananas because they really got buried by the molasses flavor. That being said I’d reduce the amount of molasses; I think it’s a good flavor in the bread, but it’s a little overwhelming. I also think I’m going to add crushed pecans into the batter next time for some more texture. On the icing, I added more butter than requested having tasted it as I went.

I was a little reticent when I read the myriad of spices, as I thought there is little to no banana flavor, it's overpowered by the spices.  It's an OK coffee cake but it's not great banana bread at all.

Really moist!  I wouldn't have thought to use molasses in banana bread, and yet the flavors went so well together.  I sprinkled some extra ginger on top before baking since I like ginger *a lot.*  It was pretty good on day one, and downright delicious on day two.   Next time I make it, though, I'm going to try to remember to make the glaze...oops.

Beyond delicious! As soon as I saw this recipe, I knew just what to do with my over ripe bananas. I did not make the icing, but the bread itself was so moist and flavorful I didn't miss the icing at all. The whole family loved it...I will def be making this again and again~YUM! Dianne, Thanks for another wonderful recipe! :)

Moist cake! I put mine in a brownie pan, not fond of the icing a cream cheese glaze would be better! I cooked exactly as described.

Really good, moist gingerbread. The whole family really liked it, and it was just what I thought it would be. If you are looking for banana bread, this isn't it, but if you want good gingerbread with a twist...perfect. Just a hint of banana, but if you didn't know it was in there, you might not necessarily pin it as banana. I'll definitely be making again.

Very good.  Very moist.  The flavor was a nice blend of banana and molasses.  I only had 1/4 c molasses on hand, so I’m reviewing it with that caveat.  Next time I’ll do it as written, as I like to do.  I would probably reduce the milk in the frosting so that its a bit less runny.  Otherwise, a great recipe!

Followed directions - turned out to be fantastic.  Everyone loves it.  Moist, tasty and just enough ginger to give it that burst of flavor without overwhelming you.  Try it - you will be happy you did.

My hubby loves banana bread and ginger so he had to make this.  He added orange zest and juice to the frosting (lemon works too).  It was amazing!  This is now the only recipe he uses when he makes banana bread.  He only makes 1/2 the amount of frosting. I've been looking for a recipe to make that type of frosting as it's like Starbucks frosting on their lemon cake, but this is so much better!

Mine turned out to be a little sunken in but it was super delicious. Actually totally cheated on the recipe and used gingerbread cookie mix, just added 1 extra tablespoon of water and 2 ripe bananas to it. Cooked approx 50 mins. Did a very light glaze with only 1 cup of powdered sugar and 3 tb spoons of milk.

This was ok.  It was a cross between a gingerbread and a banana bread, so my taste buds struggled with the gingery aftertaste.  The areas with the glaze were much better than without, so if I were to make this again I would make enough to cover all sides. I think this would be better if you added mini chocolate chips, nuts or supplemented applesauce for the bananas.  The icing was delicious, I wouldn’t change that part. Though I do have to say, the bread came out very moist.
