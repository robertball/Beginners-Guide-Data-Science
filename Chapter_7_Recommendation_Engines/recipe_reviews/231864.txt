I was skeptical of using stevia instead of sugar but this bread turned out better than I anticipated. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, a cup of chocolate chips and substituted apple sauce for the vegetable oil. Delicious!

I made this with honey substituting the stevia. It turned out great. I also used only regular flour because I didn’t have rice flour. I omitted the nuts and added some spices to my taste.

I made this using 1 cup organic wheat flour and 1 cup mixture of Millet, Almond & Cassava flour to reduce the gluten. I also used 1 tsp of liquid Stevia to avoid the corn and dextrose in powdered varieties. I used organic walnut oil in place of vegetable oil also. 
It came out awesome!! Next time I’ll replace the oil with organic sugar free applesauce to reduce the fat more.

I've made this several times already, to rave reviews. I didn't have rice flour, so I used regular flour. Once I didn't have eggs so I substituted ground flaxseed in the  proportion of one Tablespoon flaxseed plus 3 tablespoons water for one egg. It worked perfectly. I also omit the salt, since there is already a whole tablespoon of baking soda in it.  Sometimes I add chocolate chips or sprinkle them on top. My family doesn't like nuts so I don't add those. It makes a very light and fluffy banana bread so I bake it in an 8 x 8 greased pan and cut it into squares.  Sometimes I use a quarter cup of sugar instead of Stevia. It is less sweet but still yummy and gives it plenty of sweetness.
