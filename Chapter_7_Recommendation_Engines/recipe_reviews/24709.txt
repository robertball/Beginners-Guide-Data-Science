I used Basmati rice, replaced the water with chicken stock and added a cinnamon stick.  I first heated about a 1/4 cup of stock with the saffron in the microwave for about 2 mins.  Let it set for about 5 mins.  Added everything to my rice cooker and let stand on "warm" for about 1/2 hour.  This allowed the flavors to really settle in before turning on to cook.  Rice came out bright and colorful.  At the end added some frozen peas/carrots that had been defrosted in the microwave.

Good recipe, but unnecessarily complicated. The saffron does not need to be steeped separately, nor does the water have to be boiling in order to turn out perfectly cooked and fluffy rice. I used saffron threads to taste, and chicken broth rather than water. This is a perfect, pretty and  understated rice side dish to complement spicier meats or main dishes.

Like several others, I used saffron threads instead of powder.  I steeped the saffron in 1/2c room temp. white wine. I used chicken bullion (veg.  stock would also be a good substitute) for the remaining 1 1/2c liquid.  Both these additions added a good amount of flavor to the rice.

What a great way to make flavored rice.  I only used only about 1 tablespoon of butter.  Instead of using powdered saffron, I went to an Indian store and purchase saffron threads, they are much cheaper compare to the American grocer.  I put the saffron thread with boiling water, mush it with the back of the spoon to help release more of the flavor before pouring it to the rice.  For one cup of rice I used a little less than 1/4 tsp of thread.  I hope this helps!

I tripled this recipe for a dinner party and it came out great.  It was the first thing to disappear from the platter and the first thing that I was complimented on by my guests.  I used whole Spanish saffron threads, but used more than I would have if I had Indian saffron.  I also added about 8 green cardamom pods and 8 cloves to give a little extra flavor.  I also used ghee instead of whole butter.  I couldn't have been more pleased with it, and I'm pretty picky about my basmati!

I agree with other reviewers that the texture of the rice did come out perfect.  However, my rice also suffered from a lack of taste.  Maybe because I had to use Mexican Saffron.  That was all I could find.  It does have a pretty yellow color though.  
I served with Indonesian Pork Satay.  The nice part was the taste of this rice did not over power my main dish.

Excellent recipe.  I topped each serving with a light sprinkle of cinnamon and toasted pine nuts as they do in a local restaurant. Scrumptious!

I must say that I have never had rice turn out as fluffy and as tender as this! Mine usually sticks together and eventually turns to mush. However, I was very disappointed by the flavor. It could have been because I used Spanish saffron, so I will try Indian next time. I hate to say this, but the Zatarain's yellow rice had more flavor! To save my beautiful fluffy grains, I ended up adding tumeric which REALLY helped alot.

Great recipe!! However, I used chicken broth instead of the water, and it turned out excellent.  The saffron rice went great with the Marakesh Vegetable Curry.

Yummy and easy!   I 4x this recipe for a Girl Scout event that featured foods from around the world.  I was amazed how many girls were asking for seconds or even thirds!   I just made this again for my family, and it pairs up wonderfully with the Curry-Coconut Shrimp

This is absolutely perfect rice every time. I never steep the saffron (& we use threads, not powder). After cooking rice & salt in butter until opaque, I just pour low sodium chicken stock (in place of the water) and saffron over the rice, cover immeidately and cook on low for approx. 20 min. Excellent! Thanks for sharing!

I used brown rice and added a 1/4 cup more water.  I also used Spanish Saffron and doubled the quantity to 1/4 tsp since the author's notations state that this is based on the "richer" Indian saffron.  The cooking time is 10-15 minutes longer with the brown rice. If you are using salted butter you can decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp. - This is yummy and simple.  I wish I made twice as much.    Thanks

Quick & Easy.  Very handy recipe. When we want only white rice we now use the cooking technique suggested here & drop the butter, salt & saffron.  The rice comes out light and fluffy and is a great base in other dishes.  For special occasions use a better quality rice for a better dish but for normal day in day out cooking any rice will do quite well.  If my main dish is chicken I drop the salt and add a chicken bullion cube to the water.  Then sprinkle the top with roasted pine nuts and a pitch of cinnamon.  This also goes well when served with peas and carrots.

adding approx. 1tablespoon of lemon juice and a little bit of sugar will increase the taste. Traditionally we also garnish with caramelized onion just before serving.

Pretty good rice, and the directions are perfect for perfectly cooked, fluffy rice.  My only complaint is that it wasn't as flavorful as I'd have liked--I didn't taste much of the saffron.  I used saffron threads and didn't steep long enough, I think, and next time I'll use chicken broth instead of water.  Otherwise, this makes perfectly excellent rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really tasty! I liked it a lot! It was easy to make and very fluffy. I did end up using Spanish Saffron due to being unable to find the Indian Saffron, it didn't taste spicy but that is probably why. It still had a good flavor. I added a picture of it!

I cut the butter down to 1 scant tablespoon (unsalted) and only used 1/2 teaspoon salt. I can't get over how GOOD this was. I served it on some red leaf lettuce with tandoori chicken and chapati bread.

This was tasty. I used threads of saffron instead of powdered. Subbed veggie stock for the water. It came out delicious. I could have used a few extra strands of saffron but I was unsure how many to use, think I used 3. The cooking directions are really great. Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing recipe. For those who said it was bland... I don't know what you were eating. I used the saffron strands from a Middle Eastern grocery store. I used about 2 tsp (for a double recipe). I crushed it by hand before I boiled it in the water. I didn't strain it but left the saffron in the water. Went exactly by recipe the first time and it was yummy. Made it again and used one chicken bullion cube (in place of half the salt) and I added a splash of white vinegar and a couple sprinkles of sugar as suggested by someone else. It was amazing. Next time I will probably use double the saffron cuz I like a strong flavor. My husband said he could just sit there and eat the rice even WITHOUT the coconut curry chicken over it. lol. I am trying to figure out how to incorporate it into more meals like fried rice, etc. Excellent recipe.

I'll have to try this one again. followed the recipe, though i used spanish saffron threads which i crushed and brown basmati rice. Next time I'll use more saffron and perhaps no salt or very little. It sort of reminded me more of buttered popcorn than indian rice. :) I even think it would be fun to make it more of a casserole, use the same recipe but put it in a baking dish, add chicken pieces to it, cover and bake for 45ish minutes.

I skipped all the boiling water etc.  I used my rice cooker and put the saffron in with chicken broth (instead of water), butter, salt, & Kasmati Basmati rice.  I soaked it all for 20 minutes before turning on the rice cooker.  It was wonderful!  I paired it with Curried Honey Mustard Chicken and Parmesan Asparagus from this site.  My kids (young adults) loved it.

Excellent recipe.  I used Saffron powder.  I used chicken, garlic broth instead of water.  Was very tasty. I will make it a lot more times. It went well with Pork chops and garlic green beans.  Took a pic of the plate and put it on the site.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used Spanish saffron threads and Jasmine rice, because that is what I had.  I thought it was delicious.  I ate mine with roasted tomatoes and cauliflower.  I will definitely make this again.

It wasn't tasteless, but it was bland.  Didn't like it and I seriously wouldn't make it again.

This dish was really wonderful. I took the advise of some of the other reviewers and steeped the saffron threads in white wine then used chicken stock for the rest of the liquid and my husband and I really loved it. We decided that if you added some fresh keilbasa or pork (something that would let off a little fat) it could be a savory main dish

I thought this was really good, but I will only make it till the saffron runs out, then I would probably make plain white rice and save on the cost of buying saffron.

I wasn't impressed with the flavor. It was lacking something, however I can't figure out what. I might attempt it again, but I doubt it.

I made this dish over the weekend and I must say it was wonderful even though I'm not much of a rice eater. I thought I'd splurge and buy some saffron and I'm glad I found this recipe. Leeflea51
Dear Cooking for Dummies, as stated I made this and it was great. When I tried to save it, it appears on my screen as if I had submitted it and I don't know how to get it off and give proper attribution. I've contacted support for their help. I just don't want you to think I usurped your wonderful recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make, however, it was very bland. The saffron rice I have had in the past was very flavorful. I'll will have to keep looking for my saffron rice! Thank you for this recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe.  The only changes I made were to use jasmine rice, 1/4 tsp saffron threads & add two chicken bouillon cubes dissolved in the hot water instead of adding the salt.  Neither my husband nor I had ever tasted the amazing subtle flavor of real saffron before.  Thanks for posting this recipe and for all the great comments by others.

Excellent flavor.  Is saffron really that expensive?  I bought Saffron flower and it works just as well.  Very tasty rice.  Good with cucumber yogurt and chicken.

For some reason, I've never been able to make rice. The consistency is always too watery or too smushy.  I followed this recipe to a "T" and FINALLY I made rice that was palatable.  This recipe will now be my go-to rice recipe, although it's a little on the bland side.  It's a good overall recipe for saffron rice.  Definitely a keeper for those of us who are rice-challenged.  My husband asked for seconds!  (very rare...)

This was a great recipe, which I will definitely make again!  Both my husband and 4-year-old enjoyed it (the latter was exceptionally excited at the notion of eating "yellow" rice).  I followed the recipe precisely with three exceptions: 1) I used Spanish saffron threads (it was all I had on hand); 2) I substituted 1/2 cup white wine for 1/2 cup of the water (per another reviewer's suggestion); and 3) I cooked it in a saucepan with lid as opposed to a skillet (my only lidded skillet was far too large for this recipe, and I was afraid it would burn).  I think that next time I might saute a large chopped onion in the butter along with rice/salt for added texture and flavor.  All in all, it is a nice recipe!

rice turned out perfectly fluffy and a gorgeous color! I used spanish saffron threads, and crushed them in a mortar/pestle to make the required amount.  I made this recipe twice for the marrakesh vegetable curry on this website. The second time i made it, i halved the butter for less fat and think it was better the second time around, less greasy/buttery. I also used unsalted butter. If you love buttery rice though, do use the amount listed! Very good recipes, will definitely make again and use the technique for other grains.

Loved this dish!  I used chicken broth instead of water, but if you do you should omit the salt.  And I used saffron threads instead of powder.

Was good but not so great that I would want to do it all the time. I followed the advice from other readers and used chicken broth instead of water to cook the rice. Note that my rice was done in 15 min... I left it in the pan 20 min and it started to stick and became crunchy.

I'm used to my rice having a more intense flavour, but I have to say that this recipe was wonderful.  I did add a sprinkle each of pepper, paprika, garlic and onion powder.  Also I added slightly more saffron but overall it tasted great.

I love this recipe.  I also used saffron threads instead of the powder. I like to add white wine and use chicken broth instead of the water.  I use this recipe and make risotto because my family loves it that way.  Enjoy!

I disagree with the other reviewers. I was actually very disappointed with how this rice came out. It was very bland and flavorless, almost as if i had done nothing to the rice at all. My saffron has been sitting for quite some time....perhaps it's lost it's flavor. Other reviewers make me think I'm doing something wrong. I may try this one again when i get new saffron, and I'll put more saffron in next time. If the result is the same, then this recipe is simply not worth my time (and more importantly, my saffron).

Yum! The texture of my rice was perfect...rice is hit or miss for me usually. My first time using saffron, I had threads not powdered...followed the recipe exactly otherwise. Next time, less salt, think it overpowered the saffron just a hair.

SO GOOD!  This recipe for saffron rice really does melt in your mouth.  I didn't bother boiling the saffron or the water.  I just toasted the rice (I used basmati) and used chicken broth instead of water and added saffron threads before covering.  Turned out perfect!  Thank you!

Very good recipe.  I used 1/2c boiling water to steep the saffron and 1 1/2c chicken broth for the remainder of the liquid.  The taste was very nice though having never before had saffron I have nothing to compare it to.  This was an easy recipe which I would make again.

This rice was beautiful and tasty. Used a tea strainer since I only had saffron strands. Took a coffee filter and cut a square out and wrapped the saffron in it, then put it in the strainer and in the water. Came out rich and yellow. Served with Tandoori Chicken from this site.

This is a great little recipe!  Easy and produces beautiful rice.  I used saffron threads and brown jasmine rice- just cooked for about 35-40 minutes.  It has a mild flavor and goes great with Indian food.  Great to have in my recipe box.  I forgot to add the salt- would probably do 1/2 tsp. or less if I did put it in.

This rice was good.  The water being hot when added to the rice really did make all the difference. I put a slice of onion, some coriander, dash of cayenne in to steep with the saffron.  Next time I'll put even more spices and onion in, maybe a little lemon juice for zip.  I'll make this often.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good dish. I added a dash of cardamom, a sprinkle more of salt and a tiny bit of ground ginger. Served with a coconut curry and chai tea. Thanks for sharing!

The rice was good but I expected more flavor.  I used Spanish saffron, but next time I will use Indian saffron instead.

My daughter brought saffron home with her from a trip where she saw it harvested, not ever having used it before I wasn't sure what to make with it. This recipe was easy to make (I used the suggested chicken stock and used my own homemade) and delicious!

I made a bit more rice and added a chicken bouillon cube.  I usually add my saffron straight to the rice.  I like this way.  I strained the saffron water into the rice to keep out the strands as I didn’t powder them.  Plus the butter is a great addition.

This was very good. I have to say that everyone using the whole saffron threads is missing out. I haven’t seen ground saffron for sale, only threads, but if you grind them in a mortar with pestle and steep them you get much better flavor and better distribution of color. I used basmati rice. Run of the mill rice has a lot of broken grains generally and can make for gummy results. Plus the basmati just tastes better. This recipe is a great jumping off point for more elaborate rice dishes.

A nice twist to standard white rice.  Made it practically tasty enough to eat alone.  But served with Asian Pork Tenderloin.

This was excellent. I did not have basmati on hand and ended up using jasmine. The ingredient amounts and instructions were perfect, and the rice was very good! I used saffron threads instead of powdered. Next time I'll try steeping in chicken broth as other suggested. Served this along with Keema Aloo and will make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This rice was very good. The flavor was excellent. I used regular saffron. The buttery flavor was excellent! I served the rice with lamb kebabs and the combination was perfect. Will definitely make it again.

This recipe needed a little spiced up.  I did what other reviewers suggested and used chicken stock for the water.  The technique for cooking the rice is 5 stars and I recommend it over a rice cooker. When cooking the rice with the butter, I added chopped onion and minced garlic, along with a couple of whole cloves and whole allspice.  With these additions, it was great.

I was really surprised with how well this turned out!  I think I'll cut the salt by half next time because it was a little salty for me, but texture and overall flavor was amazing.  I used Jasmine rice.

Easy, tasty method to cook saffron rice!
I rinse and soak the rice for 10-30 mins just as a personal preference (also cuts down the cooking time to about 15 mins). Make sure to reduce the cooking water accordingly (approx 1/2 cup less water).
I also like to add bouillon cubes (chicken or veggie is best for this rice).

Great, simple-to-make dish that is good as-is, but would also make a good starting point to take it a few steps further with amendments (cinnamon, cardamom, turmeric, nuts, currants, etc.) as mentioned by other reviewers. I followed the recipe as-written, only I used stock instead of plain water. It was wonderful and perfectly fluffy.

Absolutely lovely result - Note that the pan produces a lot of very hot steam when the water is added - just ask me how I know...   Use a decent jug for the water, not a little measuring jug!!  :)

I simplified this by using my rice cooker, but I did steep my saffron (threads) in hot water a bit first. I doubled the batch but did not double the amount of water-- just increased it by maybe 50%. Turned out very nicely, and my picky teenager went back for seconds, which is a huge improvement over throwing half his dinner in the trash.

Delicious!  This is the only rice I have ever had that I could eat just plain, it's so good...I think that sauteing the rice in the butter first is a key step, although we used a little less butter and like other reviewers, real saffron threads.  We liked it even better than a saffron rice recipe we found in an authentic Indian cookbook!  Yum.

Used threads instead of ground, but otherwise stayed true to it, and served it with chicken curry. It turned ordinary rice extraordinary!

I'm addicted to this stuff! It's great as written but to really elevate the flavor I've tweaked my version with some of the other reviewers suggestions. I boil two cups of chicken stock in the micro with a 1/2 tsp of saffron threads, about a 1/8 tsp of ground turmeric and a splash of vinegar. I use jasmine rice instead of plain rice. To make it a meal I've added an extra ingredient; onion, diced bbq pork, diced grilled chicken, cashews. Seriously awesome recipe!!! Thanks for sharing!

You really need to use basmati rice to get that wonderful flavor. Try that!! I used your recipe as you have it written only I used the basmati  and soaked saffron in hot water first and it tastes just like the restaurant. Oh! and I put it all in my rice cooker and it turned out great!

This was the first time I had used saffron in a recipe. I did change the ingredients i must admit. I added chicken oxo to the rice, and also mushrooms while it cooked. I think otherwise it would have been a bit bland. Very good witht he additions, and i will definately make it again.

This was perfect Saffron rice. I made it for a dinner party with Persian Kabobbs and everyone wanted seconds. I'm saving this one.

This is the most buttery delicious rice! No wonder saffron is priced right up there with gold...

A great easy recipe but WAY too much salt.

Highly recommend reducing the salt to at least 1/2tsp. You can always add more salt later if waned.

I wasnt expecting this to be real flavorful. just yellow.lol. Saffron doesnt have a really strong flavor but it does have a very mild and unique one.

I had to use spanish saffron threads (it was all I could find) but this still turned out really well for us.  My husband vastly prefers it over the storebought kind.
