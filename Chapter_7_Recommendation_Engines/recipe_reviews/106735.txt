Have been doing them this way for years,  The key is par boiling them until just tender before sauteeing then you can do anything with them.  My family loves them this way and if we happen to have some wild leeks( in our search for the fiddleheads - (here in the Northeast springtime)then by all means throw a few of them in as well.  This dish definitely says "SPRINGTIME" for us here in New England and it is SOOOOO Good.

Yes, this is a basic recipe that is an excellent introduction to a veggie many people haven't heard of or tried. This was my first time trying these, and I prepped them as described on Health Canada's website (Trim, remove papery husk [if any] and rinse through several changes of water then boil for roughly 8 mins strain and then proceed with recipe.) These cannot be be eaten undercooked or raw otherwise you're putting yourself at risk for food-borne illness. I added some diced onion to this, and think that balsamic vinegar would be a delicious substitute for the lemon juice.

Meh. This is just a super-normal, super-common list of ingredients for sauteeing vegetables. It's not bad. . . . but the recipe could give more guidance on how to clean and actually cook the fiddleheads. (Common saute ingredients aside.) So I'll keep looking for a newer or more definitive fiddlehead recipe.

Delicious.  Very fresh tasting!  I added just a little butter to my olive oil too.  My husband liked them without the lemon juice; I liked it without, but preferred them with the lemon.  Thanks!

Don't bother boiling the fiddleheads first.  They are crispy and delicious sauteed.  Try stir frying them with all of your favorite vegetables or in fried rice.

I had this at a friend's house and they were delicious. Like another reader, my friend added a little butter while sauteeing them and tossed with toasted pine nuts before serving.

I have been using this recipe for over a year now, I love it!  I make it exactly as directed.   It was the first recipe I ever used for fiddleheads (which I was kind of anxious about cooking right), now I really look forward to them being in season.

I have always wanted to try Fiddleheads. This was a great recipe to try them for the first time eating them. I have to say 5 stars up! This was great, I made them exactly as you wrote it up. Awesome with the garlic and the lemon. I had them for breakfast with an egg omelet on the side.

Super simple and super yum! I used a little less garlic to let the fiddlehead flavour shine through, and used half olive oil and half butter, and boy, with that dash of lemon, it was tasty!

Delicious but like other people I would like to emphasize the importance of rinsing the fiddleheads first.  My mother also taught me to exchange the water halfway through boiling.  I boiled it for about 12 minutes and then sauteed for 5.

Very good, but very basic. A little more detail would have been nice, but overall the fiddleheads were good. NOTE TO ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THIS: ALWAYS wash the fiddlehead so thouroughly, even if they come from a store, to make sure there is no pollen left behind on the ferns.

Fiddleheads can be a little intimidating because you don't see them often at the market. I used about half the amount of fiddleheads called for, but kept other amounts the same. The cooking times were spot on for me, simmering for 10 min and sauteeing for 5 min. They were still slightly crisp without being soggy. I used extra garlic and did not add it until there were 2 minutes left in sauteeing, because I was afraid it would burn. The lemon juice was a good addition, adding a nice freshness. Thanks, A Korean, for the simple and delicious spring-like recipe! I enjoyed it!

The recipe is great. One review said I don't boil them first. That's fine as long as you keep them in the frying pan for a long, long time. Raw fiddleheads are poison.

I just made this recipe last week while visiting in CT, searching for fiddleheads now that I'm home in SC! This recipe turned out wonderfully! I followed as written and definitely recommend boiling for the least time so they'll hold up to the sautee step and not get mushy. Thank you!!!!

This is an excellent recipe that I use frequently in fiddlehead season! I'd recommend using butter and oil though, that's what my family liked best. A quick safety tip though... do NOT skip boiling your fiddlies unless you plan on getting violently ill, especially if you pick them yourself. Speaking of which, make sure you don't pick any once they've opened up at all, because mature fiddlies aren't safe to eat either. Stay safe, y'all.

Great recipe! I live in Maine and get fiddleheads every spring, I added Apple cider vinegar as well and was amazing. Vinegar really goes well with these.
