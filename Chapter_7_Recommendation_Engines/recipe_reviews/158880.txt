I made this dip and took it to a tailgate and everyone loved it.  I added a small can of diced chilis and it was perfect.

I made this and took it to work, and it was a huge hit! The only thing I did differently was I used an extra large can of chicken (28% more) and added shredded cheddar cheese on top. I think the cheese gives it the final touch. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy, tasty and travels well.  I took to a pot-luck.  The night before, I cooked everything as instructed, added 1 small can Ortega chopped roasted chili and about 3/4 cup of pre-shredded mexican cheese.  Next day, tossed in a crock pot about 1/2 hrs before the party and it heated well.  Served with tortilla chips, and put spicy salsa and guacamole in separate dishes on the side and let everyone know if they wanted to spice up, to just top with these. It was well received.

I make this but prepare it a little differently. I heat the cream cheese in a pan on medium heat, then add soup, the crumble the chicken. Then transfer it to a crock pot and add jalepnos. GOOD DIP!!

Used this as a jumping-off point for VERY fast hors d'oeuvres. Mixed whipped cream cheese (what I had on hand!) and a can of white meat chicken with some gourmet olive brine (added flavor and a hint of saltiness), and packed the mixture into split, deveined and deseeded jalapenos. (I wore surgical gloves!). Baked for 15 minutes at 400 degrees and they went over GREAT! Thanks for the inspiration!

Great recipe! I add an extra can of chicken to thicken, plus extra jalapenos, a can of diced tomatoes w/ chiles and if I have any on hand, some roasted red peppers from a jar. We like it spicy! Serve with frito scoops. Yum!

This was good!  I didn't have seasoned salt at the time, so I used a cajun seasoning instead, and added extra jalepenos.  It made it much spicier!

This is great.  I used a larger can of chicken, one regular and one chive cream cheese, added crushed ritz crackers and shredded cheese then baked at 375 for 10-15 minutes.  Delish!

Excellent as written.  Makes alot.  We like more heat so added almost one cup chopped jalapenos and some hot sauce.  A real keeper for sure.

I will admit that I was a bit skeptical when I read the ingredients. However, it tasted great! I used homemade pickled jalapeños, but otherwise, I kept the recipe as is. Thanks for a great recipe!

Super easy, fast, and delicious! I added the diced chiles another user recommended, as well as jalapeño juice, and it was fantastic. I recommend and I’ll be making this again.

A bit bland before adding some salt and pepper, but really simple and really good. I made it on the stove, stirring constantly instead of the Microwave

This is a great easy to make dip! I made same amount as specified on this post but with grated mild cheddar cheese on top, as per another user’s tips. It was eaten up quickly!! 
Some tweaks: The original recipe calls for one 8 oz. can of  chicken to 16 oz cream cheese and can of cream of chicken soup which results in a lack of chicken. If I had had  a 10 oz (can of chicken breast 1 1/2 cans) I  would’ve added it in a snap! 
 WIth a meat-loving crowd the more protein the better. Also I added 1 1/2 large fresh diced jalapeños. Sometimes the fresh jalapeños aren’t spicy so if you favor an extra kick, I’d play the jalapeños to you and your crowd’s taste.

Made this for our family get-together Christmas Eve. Everyone enjoyed it. Was asked for the recipe. Made exactly as directed. Wasn't sure why the chicken had to be cooked separately. I feel all ingredients can be melded together and then put in microwave. Will be tweaking in the future as this was a bit bland to me. I may add a spice or two. Also, wondered why the photo shows cheddar cheese on top but not mentioned in recipe. Served with Triscuit crackers. Thank you for sharing this "easy" recipe!

I like to add everything to a very mini crock pot and let it heat up and take that to the party, you can replace the Jalapeno's with almost anything, Frank's hot sauce or your fav hot sauce for buffalo wing dip, or Garlic Butter for Garlic Dip, or mix it up, I also like to add a can of cream of mushroom or cream of celery soup to it also, everyone always loves it, and never any leftover and more than 1 person is always asking for the recipe, Love to dip Frito & Tostito scoops in it and Bagels cut up into pieces.

This recipe was a good starting off point. 
I added two large shredded chicken breasts i had boiled in water with, chili pdr., cumin, onion and salt.  One tiny 3.3 oz can la costena diced green chiles. 4 dashes of Tapatio salsa picante hot sauce, that is just what i had on hand. mixed in 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar. I spread the mixture in a pyrex baking dish and topped with more sharp cheese and baked, It is very good.  The best part of this recipe is that i used it to make quesadillas, I spread a thin layer on a flour tortilla topped with some more chicken and a little more cheddar cheese, they were very good. Thanks for posting this recipe.

AS WRITTEN ITS BLAH VERY BLAND NEEDS WAY MORE JALAPENO'S I USED BONELESS CHICKEN BREAST BECAUSE MY FAMILY DOESNT CARE FOR CANNED AND IT NEEDS CHEESE!! IT TASTED LIKE IT WAS MISSING SOMETHING SO I ADDED ABOUT 2 CUPS EXTRA SHARP SHREDDED CHEESE 1 CUP MIXED IN THE CREAM CHEESE MIXTURE AND ABOUT 1 CUP ON TOP ADDED IT RIGHT BEFORE I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OUT! I WILL NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE AGAIN AS WRITTEN ONLY WITH MY MODIFICATIONS!

In the picture there is cheddar cheese on top. It is not in the recipe (unless I missed it).  Should I just sprinkle some on top before baking?

Great recipe.  So easy to make and enjoyed by all.  I had several requests for the recipe.
