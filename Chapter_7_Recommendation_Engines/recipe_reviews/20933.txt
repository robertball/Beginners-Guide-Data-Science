This is a wonderful recipe!  I modified it a bit to make it a tad healthier.  I used 1/4c white flour, 1/2c whole wheat flour, 1/4c wheat bran, 1/2 scoop of vanilla flavored whey protein powder, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp salt, 3 mashed bananas, 1/4c splenda for baking, 1/4c nonfat vanilla yogurt, 1/4c egg substitute, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.   Nutrition info per muffin: 82 calories, 0.5g fat, 18 carbs, 2g fiber and 3g protein.  Once cooled I sealed them in a plastic bag overnight, and I had no trouble peeling them from the muffin liners.  Very moist and healthy!

The kids are home sick. Perfect for  today. I didn't have sour cream so I used nonfat vanilla yogurt. I beat the bananas, eggs, yogurt and vanilla well and then added the mixed together dry ingredients. I also added walnuts. Very nice light, fluffy texture. The kids loved them!

These were great.  It's important to let them cool off completely before serving (they refrigerate very well).  I made a batch using plain, nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream and it worked fabulously.  
When the muffins were gone, I used this recipe for banana bread, replacing the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  It works, you just have to let it bake a little longer to get done in the middle.  
I also found that these are great with even less sugar (thought they don't have much to begin with), the ripe bananas do plenty of sweetening.

My best advice about this recipe is to bake it just before you go to bed at night.  That way you can leave them to cool overnight and when you get up in the morning, you can stick them into the freezer (before tasting them) so you can have some left for tomorrow.   Just keep 2 or 3 out or as many out as you need for breakfast or brunch.  That is unless you need them all that day for some occasion or just to be immediately eaten, because they will be if there's anyone around to sample or taste them. 

They baked up beautifully - very light and fluffy but needed to cook a little longer than 20 mins to come out of the papers easily.

I baked these for a study group next week but I know I'm going to have trouble having some left by then, even though they're in the freezer.

What I like most about this recipe is that it uses only 1/2 cup of sugar.  We all know that bananas have the highest sugar content of any fruit and therefore don't need 3/4 or 1 1/2 cups of sugar with them.  They are deliciously and perfectly sweet with this small amount of sugar.  I toyed with adding some spices (just because I like spiced bananas) but decided to do it as written first to see how they taste normally.  They are quite scrumptious as is and  I'm really thankful that I found this recipe.  It's perfect!

I didn't have enough banana, so I added applesauce. My other alterations were pretty standard: cinnamon, and vanilla yogurt for the sour cream. To the reviewer who used 1/4C extra banana rather than sour cream, and got poor results: baking soda requires an acidic ingredient to cause it to act. By removing the sour cream and replacing it with fruit, you removed that acidic ingredient, and the baking soda remained inactive.

OMG i LOVE these!!!!!! soooo yummy and tender!!!! i used 2 medium ripe bananas, half whole wheat flour and half white flour, replaced the sour cream with fat free vanilla yogurt, and had to use almond extract instead of vanilla. Other than that, everything was kept the same.....cooked in about 22 minutes.....i really beat together the egg and banana mixture, so i think that helped make the muffins so spongey....mmmmm!!!! Just the right amount of sweetness, o-so-low in fat, and just straight up scrumptious!!!!! Made exactly 12. seriously- try this recipe!!!

Considering that I neglected to add the baking powder and they still rose twice the size with just the half tsp of baking soda I was pretty impressed.  They were neither too moist or heavy or dry.  I did add a couple tablespoons of oil, to compensate for the small banana I used and I did add nutmeg, cinnamon and extra vanilla for extra flavour.  Very tasty.

Thumbs up for this super easy recipe.  I found these to be very moist & light.  The banana flavor is mellow not bland...makes me think of a banana pancake.
Going by the reviews & personal preferece, I made a few minor changes:
Instead of 1 cup ap flour I used 1/2 cup all purpose & 1/2 cup whole wheat.  I also changed the 1/4 cup sugar to a mix of sugar/Splenda.  I used 3 ripe bananas (what I had on hand) instead of measuring out the one cup & added a dash of cinnamon & Splenda to the top of each muffin before baking.  20 minutes worked perfect in my oven. Yum!  
Don't let the scant 1 cup of flour fool you - you will get 12 regular sized muffins or 6-8 generously large muffins out of this small amount of batter.  
I didn't taste any of the bitterness or have any problems with dryness. Perhaps the extra bit of banana made a difference?  I don't know for certain but when I made my second batch I stuck with my changes & they came out great, too.

Excellent muffins!  Love everything about them from the fluffy texture to the guilt-free great taste.  I used fat-free yogurt in place of sour cream with no problems as well.  Also added about 1/8 teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg for a boost in flavor.  Will definitely make these again.

One of the best banana muffin recipes.  It's simple and tastes great, and best of all is low in fat and sugar.  I made some for my kids and they loved them!  I didn't have the heart to tell them the muffins were actually good for them!

These tasted salty, and the texture was strange. Light, with lots of pockets of air, not dense at all like a muffin usually is. They were moist, but that's all that I could say that was good about them.  I almost trashed them, but I know people who'll eat anything. I did tear up the recipe sheet and throw that away. The simple ingredients drew me to this one, but I think muffins really need butter/margarine. Thanks but I'll keep on looking.

These are nice and moist. I actually baked this in loaf pan instead of doing muffins.  Not too sweet.  I used low fat sour cream.  These are nice if you are watching your calories and fat.

Great quick and easy muffin recipe. I love how they are very light and fluffy. If you are looking for a dense cake this isn't for you. I can see myself making this with pumpkin or apple sauce. I did a few different things. I make them into mini muffins. I sprinkled a tad bit of sugar and pecans on each muffin before hitting the oven. I also replaced the 1/4th cup of white sugar with brown sugar. I can also see how the sour cream can be switched with yogurt. I may try berry yogurt and bananas next time. This one is a keeper!

I subbed: 1/2 ww flour and 1/2 ap flour; yogurt for the sour cream; 1tsp baking pow instead of 1 Tbs; 2T of brown sugar instead of 1/4 c white; pinch cinnamon and made it into bread instead of muffins.  Baked at 170C for 50mins. YUM  I plan to sub grated apple for the bananas next time.

So this is good BUT.... not the best I have ever had.  They were a bit plain and I had to put some blue agave syrup on them before eating them which worked out fine.  I appreciated that they were low fat and less sugar, but it needed more taste and sweetness for me.  If I made these again I would add some blue agave to the mix and perhaps add cinnamon as others did.  I like to rate the recipe as is and not base it on a bunch of changes.  I would have given this 3 1/2 stars if I could.

This is the banana muffin recipe I always use now, even tho I have probably 10 or 12 others!   I've made them with multigrain flour the past 2 times, and they are still yummy.  I also use low fat sour cream.  So it's nice to know they taste good and aren't too unhealthy.  I only get 9 or 10 muffins each time tho because I fill my liners close to the top for bigger muffins!

My family liked these, but I think that the baking powder taste is too strong.  They did turn out light and fluffy, and I like the fact that they are lower in sugar and fat than most muffins.  But the after taste was not pleasant.

I was underwhelmed. I like how moist they are and they're healthy, but they were a little bland. I might try adding some orange zest or some nuts or chocolate chips or something next time.

These are great!!! I decided to give it try after the great reviews.  Well let me tell you my husband and his friends ate the dozen in less than 5 minutes.  I ended up having to bake another batch so I can taste for myself.  They are so moist.  Just enough sugar and no butter Wow!Thanks for sharing.

These were OK, but I've made much better banana muffins. My batch tasted a bit too strongly of baking powder; not my favorite flavor. But at the same time, they collapsed during cooling into sorry-looking hockey pucks. The texture was a bit too gooey for me, too.

Good, low fat muffin. I would suggest something to help give them more flavour.  Maybe some dark chocolate chips or chopped walnuts.  I didn't use papers, but instead used my aerosol-free oil sprayer and lightly sprayed the muffin tins.  I also use a plastic knife to remove my baking from the pans if they are sticking a bit, works like a charm.  Kids enjoyed them.  Good recipe if you are looking to reduce calories/fat. I followed it as per the recipe, no changes.

When I followed the recipe properly these were great.  The first time I made them I blew it on the sour cream and put in a cup instead of 1/4 cup.  They were like banana Yorkshire puddings.  A little humility doesn't hurt and reminds me to read recipes more carefully.  Bottom line, the recipe as is, is a keeper.

Wow!  I love this recipe.  It is just sweet enough and so light and moist.  I even used 1/2 cup whole wheat and it was still light and fluffy.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I made mini muffins and they came out perfect in 12 minutes.

I added a lot to make this better and that's what kicked it up to 5 stars.  I used half brown sugar, added 2 heaping teaspoons of cinnamon and about 1/4 - 1/2 a teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg. I also swapped out the sour cream for vanilla yogurt. Then I added a generous glob of peanut butter, just for fun...maybe about a tablespoon and a half.  The texture is lovely, a nice fluffy soft muffin, with a lot of flavor. I'm on Weight Watchers and it's only 2 points! And delicious too...a great find.

These were ok- but kind of dry and bland and not special enough to make again.

These were great. I followed the recipe exactly, but added 3 bananas total as per someone else's review (not sure how many cups that equates to). They were moist and delicious.

Quick and easy.  Very moist.  I used Rum extract instead of vanilla, which was not noticeable at all.  Next time I will add cinnamon and try it with yogurt instead of sour cream.

FABULOUS! And even that isnt enough praise for these great muffins! These are the best low fat muffin that I have ever tried. If you are looking for moist flavorful muffins this is it! I did use the regular sour cream because there is no other oil or butter in the recipe. I added a bit more vanilla but that was it for the changes. I have even made them without the sugar and they are great!  You wont believe that you are eating a low fat muffin because it does NOT taste low fat!!!  Try this you wont be disappointed. Next time I am going to add a few blueberries!  Yummy!

I used fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream to keep the fat down and I also used whole wheat white flour. I didn't want to taste baking powder over everything else so I cut it back to one teaspoon. Tasty, but could use just a little more vanilla.

These taste great! I used half whole wheat, half white flour and non-fat yogurt. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg as other reviewers suggested. Very yummy! My 11 month old baby loves them too!

These muffins smell and taste wonderful. I used whole wheat flour in place of the all-purpose, used yogurt instead of sour cream, reduced the sugar to 3 tablespoons (although next time I will reduce it some more), and put in a pinch of nutmeg and some cinnamon. I also had to bake them for a little longer than the twenty minutes. Great recipe! Will definitely make this again. The texture was amazing.

This was good for a lowfat muffin. It isn't too sweet and perfect when you want to save the extra cals. In response to others who used splenda and were not happy w/ the results: DON"T use splenda! Your baked goods never come out as they should. I don't care what anyone says Splenda is NOT sugar and so far removed from sugar to be made from sugar as it's claimed. Stick to the real and natural stuff and just practice moderation.

These were seriously yucky.  I followed the recipe exactly - the result was spongy, chewy, (really, really) unsweet (vaguely) banana-ish muffins.

these muffins were so good~! i used all whole wheat flour, splenda, and dannon lemon flavored yogurt. it was still amazing. i've never tasted such a good fat free and healthy muffin before. 1 cup mashed is about 1 1/2 large bananas. i'll always be waiting for my bananas to ripen so that i can make these muffins! ^^ thanx for this recipe

These are my daughter's most favourite muffins. They're light and soft with a pleasant banana flavour. They're a great weight watcher's snack too (around 2 points). I have made them with regular sour cream or fat free and either way they are tender and delicious. I'm not sure why some other reviewers had problems with them rising? My batter rises before I even get them in the muffin tin. Perhaps they are over mixing or have old baking powder? I keep my baking powder in the freezer so it's always fresh. Thanks for such a great and easy recipe!

This is a great muffin considering its low sugar and fat content! I used RF sour cream and half the baking powder, and they tasted very good.  I wish I had remembered to add some cinnamon, which I really like in banana bread. Of course, nuts would take them over the top, but then they wouldn't be 2 Weight Watchers PointsPlus each, would they?

They were ok. I thought they needed more flavor though, maybe some cinnamon. I also feel like the amount of baking powder is unusually high compared to other banana muffin recipes.

Okay, I made changes - but I am sure the base recipe is good as is! I just wanted to share my ideas: I used brown sugar instead of white, 3/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup quick oats, fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream, one TBSP vegetable oil, and two TBSP of vanilla protein powder. These are great and won't wreck your diet!! :)

This is a great starting point recipe!! I have made these several times with additional healthy changes and they have turned out very good.  Here goes.. sub 1/2 cup Whole wheat flour,  reduce baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp, ADD - 1/2 cup to 1 cup extra mashed bananna, sub best brown or golden brown sugar, extra 1/2 tsp vanilla, ADD - 3 Tbsp flax meal, 1/2 cup chipits, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts,  and I added some cinnamon too.  Thanks for a great low fat fun muffin.  My son gives it 2 thumbs up (as his mouth is full of muffin).

Talk about moist!  These muffins are wonderful.  I used a little more sour cream than the recipe called for; and my bananas were extra ripe.

Also, I borrowed the Cinnamon-Crumb topping from the "To Die for Blueberry Muffin" recipe:
1/2 cup sugar; 1/3 cup flour; 1/4 cup butter, cubed; 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon.

Try it with the topping!

VERY good and healthy recipe!!!! I added milk chocolate chips, pecans and coconut and topped it wil a streusal topping before baking. They came out SO delicious!!!!! If you want to make them even healthier, substitute whole wheat flour and I added ground flaxseed for some 
omega-3's!

My family thinks these are great!!  I found they easy to put together. I have made this several times since finding it on the site.  I don't know what to say about the bad reviews about the muffins being dry. I found them to be very moist, and have a great, true banana taste.  For my gang( several adults and 4 kids) no extra sugar is needed.  They are even better the next day. They have made a great lunch box treat for the kids, and one I don't mind giving since the low sugar content and lower calorie aspect.  Thank you so much.

This recipe is so frickin' simple and tasty, I've made these twice already and I will definitely make it again.  I'm a health conscious person and so have made a few changes to help make this a bit better for you but still awesome.  I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 to make them a bit bigger.  I also mixed 1/2 cup all-purpose flour with 1 cup whole wheat, switched out the sour cream for fat free yogurt, mixed 1/8 cup white sugar with 3/4 cup brown, and added a taste of cinnamon to the wet mix.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of roasted, crushed pecans to the batter.  Finally, before baking a added a banana slice to each muffin cup.

Considering these have no butter I thought they turned out very tasty... maybe not quite the best ones I have ever had... but these are more healthy so they get 5 stars... Will be making these again.

Best.Muffins.EVER!!  I baked according to the recipe and they are simply wonderful!  They are super moist and fluffy and do not fall apart.  I have made 6 doz ahead of time for a gathering so I will be freezing them.  Mine baked for exactly 16 min and have the perfect color and came out of the pan without sticking (not using paper cups because of freezing).  This recipe is going to be the only one I use from now on!

I gave these muffins 5 stars based on the fact that they have no shortening and very little sugar, resulting in a very low calorie muffin. I used 1/3 cup of sugar actually, but I used non-fat sour cream. They stuck a little to the paper, which is not surprising, and I might use a different recipe if I were making these for company. But based on the fact that I made this batch into 11 muffins that were 90 calories each, I will keep this recipe and reuse it over and over. They were very tasty. Next time, I plan on adding fresh blueberries.

These are great and so easy, also if you make them into minimuffins they are super treat for very few calories! I used whole milk yougurt instead of sour cream and 1/2 whole wheat flour and they were delicious! I calculated the points for ww in case anyone is following that and its 1 pt/ minimuffin (makes 24 minimuffins). What a great treat thanks for the great recipe!

MMMmmmm these were good. Only thing i did different was uses lit n fit dannon yogurt(vanilla)since i had a whole ton of it. excellent muffins and weren't flat like some reviews said them to be. oh but word of advise; don't reheat in microwave they become slightly weird or maybe that was because i used yogurt...

I am super impressed with these muffins! I made them one night simply because I had two large overly ripe bananas, and most recipes seem to call for three bananas. I just wanted to get rid of my mushy produce, and expected some adequate muffins...  But now I have to say, I think this is my FAVORITE banana muffin recipe on Allrecipes (and I've tried a few!). I just love that it's not obscenely sweet, and I think the sour cream makes them taste extremely moist (I used light sour cream)... no oil or butter needed!  For my second batch, I threw in a handful of Ghiradelli semisweet chips... DECADENT!

I always make Janet's Rich Banana Bread when my bananas go; it's an awesome recipe, but not very healthy.  I wanted some lighter muffins since we're not very active this time of the year.  This is a good recipe considering the ingredients but is by no means decadent and has only passable texture and flavor.

After reading the reviews I had to try this recipe and I luv luv luv it.  The thing I had to change was the flour since I doubled the recipe (due to the reviews and I'm glad I did) I used 1cup  rice flour and 1 cup gluten free all purpose flour, then added 1tsp xanthum gum as the thickening agent.  And I did use the small tropical bananas because I find they have more flavor.  These are sooooo my favorite!!

This was a good recipe. We used it with some modifications for our daughter's first birthday "cake." We added 2 tablespoons of oat bran and substituted applesauce for the sugar and plain yogurt for the sour cream. They still are very good without the conventional ingredients and she loves them so much I think I will have to make them often for snacks.

These are my son's most requested treat for his lunchbox! I substitute in wheat flour (about 1/2 cup) and also add in some dark chocolate chips to make it more kid friendly.  Great to find a recipe with no butter and little sugar - thanks for sharing!

These muffins have good flavor. The texture is very light and fluffy. I added about 1/3 cup oatmeal and 1/2 tp. cinnamon. I used reduced fat sour cream and baked them in a mini muffin pan for 12 minutes. I like that these muffins have almost no sugar or fat.

These are good for a low-fat recipe.  They are not good when first eating them warm, can definately sense more of the baking powder aftertaste.  (and I used less than the recipe called for).  Once cooled however, they were tasty enough to eat again.  Don't expect a cakey muffin though.

I did not have sour cream so used an extra 1/4 cup banana at the suggestion of my mom. It was very soft and fluffy but tasted somewhat bitter. I think the baking powder was way too much?

These were wonderful!  I used a touch of nutmeg and cherry vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream.  The  cherry flavor added a tang to it, I may use straight up cherry yogurt next time. Thanks!

This was really good, but I unfortuently did not read the reviews that said to add cinnamom and nutmeg.   I used whole wheat flour and 2 Tbls. Sucunat sugar instead of 1/4 cup white sugar and it turned out great.  I used mini muffins since I had then sitting around and wanted to use them.  Next time I am going to try adding coconut to add flavor and keep the sugar down.  For using Whole wheat decrease your oven temp by 25 degrees and add about 3-4 minutes to your oven time.  Also when you use mini muffins instead of regular take the time down by half.

I made these tonight for my husband to take for breakfast in the morning.Since he is trying to eat healthier, I also used Splenda,wheat flour and added a dash of cinnamon also. These turned out really great! I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for such a healthy and delicious recipe!

This is one of the best low fat muffin recipes!  The low fat sour cream makes the muffins soft without butter or oil. I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar instead of white and it had a deeper flavor.  I recommend cinnamon and nutmeg too.

Now this is my kind of recipe! Plenty of room for customization here. I used whole wheat flour, raw cane sugar, nonfat yogurt vs sour cream and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce as I didn't have eggs on hand. Also added cinnamon and nutmeg. Yum!

These are a very tasty banana muffin. I acually added a tiny amount of crushed choc chips. And i added an extra banana. They are really moist muffins, and came up wonderfully. They only thing is the tops of my muffins are a little sticky. maybe i should of left them in the oven a little longer, or not added the extra banana. Either way they are tasty.

Following the recipe exactly, I found that the center of these muffins sank upon cooling despite being careful not to overmix.  While the texture was ok and not rubbery, there was a strange aftertaste -- perhaps from the amount of baking powder (??).  For a healthier low-fat muffin, I much prefer 'Lighter Banana Muffins' from this site.  At any rate, thanks for the post!

Mmm, these muffins were yummy.  One of the better low fat recipes I have made.  I use whole wheat flour and splenda.

I doubled the recipe so I could share with my diabetic mom.  I used half sugar and half Splenda.  Very good muffins for the calories. I still think banana breads should have nuts...but the calories/fat.  I'll will make this recipe again with nuts.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.  My whole family enjoyed them.

To be honest, I was a bit tentative when I chose to make this recipe, because I'm not a big fan of bananas, but my older sister is (that's what I call showing some love :)). They turned out the best muffins I've ever made, really (I ate most of them consequently :))! My mom helped me, in a way, but she beat the mixture too much, so it wasn't as filling, but still very moist! The large quantity of bakign powder really took effect for me too; the caps were huge! Once again, a scrumptious recipe! I'll be trying this again very soon.

It didn't rise very well, but the second time I made them, I made it in a casserole dish instead. It seemed to cook all the way through and were wonderful that way.

I really don't get a dozen out of this recipe. I doubled it and made fuller muffins and they were very good. I never have sour cream so I always use fat free plain yogurt instead and use brown sugar instead of white. VERY moist...alittle too moist if you ask me. They borderline mushy but my dad says they're perfect. Maybe its just me. I like them the next day toasted in the toaster oven with some butter...mmmmm.

The muffins are great!!!  I made them completely fat-free using fat-free sour cream and egg substitute and they were wonderful!  My family loves them.  My father is very picky about my fat-free cooking and he has already eaten several of these muffins!  I doubled the recipe and got about 18 muffins out of it.  We didn't find them dry at all.

These muffins turned out great. Super moist! I used (i?go) vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream. I didn't mesure the amount of banana, but I used 2 of them. I also made jumbo muffins instead of regular size, and the mix was only enough to make 4 of them. Excellent recipe!

I LOVE IT!!!!!! best recipe ever! It only tastes like its bad for you!! I tweaked this recipe just a tiny bit and it looks and tastes :)great! instead of using only all purpose flour i used half all purpose and half whole wheat to bump up the nutrition. I also was just the tiniest bit short on banana so I added a tablespoon of applesauce and that did the trick. I used organic sugar instead of white sugar and instead of using sour cream i used 0% fat french vanilla yogurt to substitute so i didn't need to add the vanilla extract. AND to make it even more nutritious by substituting the egg with 1 tablespoon of flax meal mixed with 3 tablespoons of water. I added cinnamon just for an extra kick and garnished with one chocolate chip in the center, cant wait to make this recipe again!

Needs to be slightly sweeter, for me personally. I think next time I will add a tsp of Stevia or Splenda. I added some cinnamon, a tiny dash of cloves, and a tiny dash of nutmeg. Overall nice low cal treat!

I did the Elvis version. Used a small banana, added 1/4 C creamy p. butter, subbed mayo for the sour cream and an extra egg. Batter was a bit thick so added a splash of milk.Ooooh yeah!

These were a little bland.. Not very sweet I thought, and I don't usually like really sweet stuff. They also stuck to the muffin cup liners pretty bad; I thought the point of using liners was so that they don't stick to the pan. Overall, these weren't bad, but I have had better banana bread recipes so probably wont make these again.

these are amazing!  they take literally about 5 minutes to prep.  spray the muffins papers or tin with cooking spray, since there is no oil or butter, they will stick a little.  I used 3/4 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white, swapped raw sugar for white, added a tad more vanilla and a shake of ground cinnamon, sprinkled a little raw sugar on top before baking, they were PERFECT oh, I also added 1/2 cup of mini choc chips :)

Hmm... I'm not sure how to rate this one. I appreciate that it's healthier and a decent substitute for banana bread if you don't want all the fat and calories of traditional recipes. However, I would never make them if I was trying to appeal to an audience of eaters who weren't focused on being so health-conscious. The texture is slightly off (given they don't have the fat/oil) and they don't pack a big flavor... maybe more bananas next time and perhaps some heart-healthy nuts. --I did not find it had a baking powder taste, as some reviewers commented. --All in all, decent. Just up the banana for more flavor.

This muffin is good if you are looking for low fat / low calorie options. In comparison to other low calorie muffins, this one really is very tasty. I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup mini chocolate morsels. With these changes, each muffin is 128 calories. As others have said, these are small muffins and you might prefer to make 9 instead of 12 for a fuller muffin.

Wonderfully low calorie and decadent! I did make some changes. I substituted the all purpose flour for 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup bran. I used buttermilk instead of sour cream. And 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of white which gave these muffins a nice caramel color and taste. Instead of 12 muffins I made 6, the nutrition stats for my muffins were  122 calories, 4.3 grams fiber, and less than 3 grams fat. Looved it!! Will definitely make these again.

This is the best lower-fat muffin recipe I've ever used.  I was looking for something a little different and liked the idea of sour cream instead of the standard yogurt/applesauce.  Made the following changes/additions: 1/2 AP and 1/2 whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of white, low-fat sour cream (added a little extra), about a tablespoon of ground flaxseed, sprinkled in some cinnamon and nutmeg, and lightly covered the tops with a cinn/sugar mix and some fresh blueberries.  The texture is awesome!  Baked fully in 17 mins.

Made a double batch with no change except adding 1 t cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  They were so good you don't miss the fat at all.  Will make again and again experimenting with adding raisins, chocolate chips, etc.

Love this recipe! With a few changes suggested before, I replaced 1/2 cup white flour with whole wheat flour and added 3 tbsp wheat germ.  Decreased baking powder to 2 tsp, increased vanilla to 1 tsp and used plain fat free yogurt instead of sour cream.  I think they have great flavour and even my nephew who hates all things healthy loved them.

Soft, light, and very easy to make muffin.  I followed recipe exactly and only had to leave them in for 15 minutes.  The sweetness was just right.  Next time I may use whole wheat flour, add some other spices, nuts, and/or chocolate chips just to "dress" them up a bit, but they are fine plain by themselves. I am also glad that these are supposedly lower in fat.

I really liked that these weren't very sweet. I used flax instead of the egg, and made 24 mini muffins that baked for 15 minutes. Surprisingly good for what's in them.

These were yummy!  The changes I made were I used 1/4 cup Dannon Light & Fit Carb & Sugar Control Vanilla Yogurt for the sour cream.  (It's what I had.)  I also used 1 cup oat bran flour instead of all purpose to bump up the nutrition.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips (my kids love them that way.)  I made 30 mini muffins.  (Only 53 calories and 8 carbs each--even with my add-ins.)
I just realized that I didn't even realize the recipe called for 1 T. of baking powder, so I only used 1 t. and they were great.  Some reviews say 1 T. was too much, so just so you know they work fine with less!

Yum. I used nonfat yogurt instead of the sour cream and added some tart diced apples. I don't know that I would use the apples again, but the muffins were delicious even straight out of the oven. I was a little concerned about the color as I used some yucky brown frozen bananas, but the outside at least was a lovely golden brown. Definitely better when cool. I'll be making these again I think.

Great for kids because they don't fall apart like traditional muffins.  It's exactly the type of recipe I was looking for that would allow them to eat muffins without making a huge mess.  And they taste great too!  Very convenient.

this is a very light, tasty recipe.  I just pulled the first batch out of the oven and tried it for the first time and I must say MMMMMM!  I added some cinnamon and nutmet...just a dash of each like other reviews suggested, and they gave the recipe some added flavor.  I doubled the recipe, and it turned out fine!  I also added a single pitted prune on top, to half the recipe and sprinkled some walnut pieces on top of the other half.  This adds a few extra calories, but healthy calories!!! ENJOY

An awesome muffin.  I like using the mini muffin tin because my family likes it crispier.  I replaced the real sugar with saccharine, but used a whole egg, giving me a more cakey texture.

For a low fat muffin, these are excellent. i used splenda and nonfat  yogurt instead of sour cream because that's all i had in the house. They were very moist and yummy. As a variation i have also added frozen blueberrys and they turn out just as good:)

I thought that these banana muffins were very simple to make and very soft and moist.  I made mine in thoughs cupcake paper thingys so that clean up was easy.  They also taste better if kept in a plastic bag.  Will make again for sure!!

I need to update my review below. I used this recipe as a foundation for a carrot raisin muffin and it turned out great. Basically, I substituted 1 cup finely shredded carrot for the banana and added cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/2 soaked raisins. Turned out great!


I made this with low-fat sour cream that I had hanging around and some over-ripe bananas in the freezer. At the suggestion of others, I added cinnamon and nutmeg. I can't ask for a more tasty banana muffin with such few calories. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper.

Thanks for this recipe! I am a bit bored with my low cal snack choices, and now I can enjoy a delicious muffin. I had a tablespoon of peanut butter on it & it was delicious. I did add an extra banana & bran to amp up the fiber a bit. My kids enjoyed these also.

These are pretty good muffins. I did add some chocolate chips because plain banana is a little boring. My did stick to the paper muffin cups even though I did let them cool completely the day I made them. The next day, they tasted even better and they didn't stick to the paper at all. I will definetly try this recipe again.

I liked that this recipe was low in fat and sugar, but it turns out it is low in flavor as well.  I added nutmeg and cinnamon, along w/ a cinnamon-sugar topping.  I think as someone else said its the baking powder flavor that comes thru, and I used a scant tablespoon; however they rose nicely.

I agree, this is pretty good for a low-fat muffin. I added the some blueberries, as someone else had mentioned, and tripled the recipe for 24 large muffins.

Really good muffins, especially when you consider that they're pretty healthy.  Soft with great banana taste.  Made 8 really big muffins.  A touch of cinnamon would have been a nice addition.

They were very small and did not rise much, as many have already mentioned, but I really liked that they were very low in fat and calories. I used splenda to make them even more so, and they were almost completely guilt-free. :) They had a nice banana taste- and it was a great way to get rid of those overripe bananas sitting around!!

These had a great banana taste, and I love that they are pretty low in fat and calories, but mine didn't rise hardly at all! They turned out small and stayed pretty flat, and they would not cook on the inside at all despite lots of time in the oven. I'd suggest increasing the temp to 400F and perhaps double the recipe to make bigger muffins? Great taste, weird appearance.

A very easy and delicious recipe! It was so simple to make and the bananas added so much flavor to this moist muffin! Great for breakfast, a snack, or even dessert! Great recipe!

Good stuff ... I do not eat eggs, so I substitute 1 tablespoon of plain yoghurt for each egg.  Even with the change, the muffins turned out brilliantly. They are not overly sweet, which I prefer and they are wonderfully moist. I found the baking time too short 25 minutes seemes to work ... then again, it may be my oven. Definitely, give these a try.  They are easy to make and keep well in a covered container.

Great muffins. I would increase the oil content, though. Also, it wouldn't hurt to have a little more mashed banana in the batter.

I love this recipe, and so does everyone I make it for!  The muffins are fast, easy, and very tasty.  They also freeze very well and are great with a little low-fat cream cheese spread on them.  The only thing I do different is divide the batter between 9 muffin cups instead of 12 to make them bigger.  It just takes a minute more of cooking time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best banana muffin recipe I've found.
The muffins are very light and tasty. I also add about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

I thought this was a very delicious recipe. Not as rich as some other banana muffin recipes, but very good for a lowfat muffin. I added a tsp of cinnamon and it really perked it up. Very yummy!

making these where really easy and they where moist and  good when warm straight from the owen.
BUT when cold there wheren´t much flavor, instead a bitter after taste  probably from the large amount of baking powder. if I would do these again, since they are so moist, I would add just 1teaspoon baking powder instead, I don´t think it would affect the result much. and a little coconut or chopped nuts would be nice.

These muffins are terrific! I tried one after they had cooled. It was good, but just a bit dry; however, after sitting all night in an airtight container, they were perfectly moist. Next time, I may try reducing the amount of baking powder by about 1/2 and mixing in some nuts. For easy, quick muffins, these are definitely a winner!

These muffins were a delight!  I was able to whip them together in just a few
minutes, and I never would have guessed they were low in either sugar or fat.  I 
couldn't resist having one fresh from the oven, and it tasted wonderful, but they
were all the more scruptious after they had a day to sit.  I will definitely make 
this recipe again!

To salty, didn't rise (I had new baking soda and baking powder). I think the ingredient measurements must be off a bit.

I've made these twice.  As written, I give it 3.5 stars.  My additions were to add about 2 tsp. of oil, a big dash of cinnamon and ground cloves.  I used half sour cream and half buttermilk.  I also used brown sugar Spelnda in place of sugar.  Very good!!

I notice people saying that these muffins are dry, but they are probably just over baking them. Mine were completely done in 10 minutes. Mine were also not at all salty. They are a bit bland, which is why they lost a star, so you should probably add an extra banana and some spices. Also, I would reduce the baking powder to about half a tablespoon. Overall they weren't bad, but they weren't my favorite.

EDIT: everything I said above is true for the first couple of hours after they come out of the oven, but by the next day they are soggy, sticky, and just plain disgusting

This recipe was great, and it is much healthier than many!  I did make a few changes the second time around and still liked the way it turned out.  Instead of a T. baking powder, I used 1 tsp.  I didn't have enough sour cream one time and added applesauce to make the 1/4 cup.  I used roughly  half regular flour and half whole wheat pastry flour.  Instead of 1/4 cup sugar, I filled the measuring cup a little more than half that, knowing the handful of chocolate chips would add extra sweetness.  Will be making these again and again, as my daughter loves them!

I made these for a diabetic friend using Splenda in place of sugar.  You may want to add a couple of teaspoons sugar with the Splenda if you like them brown on the top.  I also used 1/2 cup wheat flour, 1/2 cup white flour and fat free sour cream.  I sprayed muffin papers with cooking spray to minimize the sticking.  Definitely let them sit overnite for improved flavor. Quick and easy to make.

Great healthy version of banana muffins. I didn't have sour cream so I just used low fat plain yogurt. I liked the small amount of sugar and lack of oil. I will have to double the recipe next time. They went fast.

I thought these were great!  No, they aren't as wonderful as ones with more fat and calories, but for a healthy muffin, they are wonderful!  I didn't notice the baking soda taste that other reviewers have complained about, but I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon, so that may have helped.  Each muffin was only 2 points for Weight Watchers, so I'm thrilled.  I will make these often!

This was an okay recipe, but I found the muffins very chewy. Their saving grace - low in calories!

Pretty good and really easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and added some chocolate chips.  Nice and moist.  I did eat 2 before they made it to the freezer.  Recipe only made 10 muffins though.

These are quite good (my picky son ate 2 as soon as they had cooled).  For this reason I will make them again, but I need to make a few changes.  1. a little bit less baking powder   2. add a little cinnamon & nutmeg   3. spray the muffin papers with baking spray or don't use muffin papers and just spray the tins well (my main complaint is that they really stuck quite badly to the papers)   4. use less sugar - the bananas make them sweet and too much sugar made them a bit too sweet for me.   otherwise, I really liked how simple and healthy-ish they are.

Delicious and healthy. I modified the recipe to make it a super healthy snack for my toddler (and based on what I had in the kitchen) and the muffins still taste great. I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat, cut the sugar in half, used vanilla low-fat yogurt in place of the sour cream, and cut out the vanilla extract. An easy, quick recipe I will use again!

Moist and subtly flavored. Didn't have enough wet ingredients to mix with dry, so added some milk. My egg may have been a little small.

Written as is, it was not too flavorful.  If I make it next time I'll make sure to increase the vanilla and add in cinnamon and nutmeg.

Love them. I used 1/2 c of wheat flour & 1/2 c of organic spelt flour which has a nutty flavor, reduced fat sour cream.  Even my kids loved them!

I used 3 bananas and no egg, whole wheat flour, a dash of cinnamon and lite sour cream. They turned out great! Add an extra minute to cooking time if you use whole wheat flour & no egg.

I am surprised by the number of people who loved this recipe, and have to agree with those who said they found it to have too much baking powder.  I did not like the 'spongy' texture.  It only made 9 muffins, and they did not have the high rounded tops that my usual muffins have.  Sorry, but I will not be making this one again.

I made these as directed after reading the first 15 reviews which were positive.  Had I read further I would've seen the reviews which were older regarding the quantity of baking powder.  As I learned, the 1 T. called for is WAY TOO MUCH.  It left a very bitter taste, and I ended up having to throw away the muffins because after one bite my family would not eat them.

These were really good! I made the recipe exactly as written (but with fat free sour cream instead of plain), and they turned out very tasty. Perfect amounts, perfect temperature, even perfect baking time. My husband made a face when he saw me preparing them, "You're putting sour cream in the banana bread?," but when he tasted them he was very pleased. I'm always trying different banana bread/muffin recipes (some are too sweet or are too unhealthy written as-is), and this one is a keeper. They would also be good with a little cinnamon and/or nutmeg added, but it's not a requirement. Thanks, Tahoegirl!

These muffins are SO good. I can't even describe the taste... the texture... oh, they're wonderful. Every time we have bananas my family begs me to make them. I've learned they're even better when throwing in a handful of chocolate chips at the end of mixing. Yummy! 5 stars all the way; I'm keeping this recipe forever.

I used only 1 tsp of baking powder and fat-free yogurt instead of sour cream.  I mixed the baking soda with the yogurt first, then stirred in the rest of the ingredients, wet first, then dry.  Turned out nicely although they were a little less "structured" than a regular muffin would be.  I will make these again and attempt a sugar-free version with Splenda.

What an excellent, guilt free way to use ripe bananas! No alterations needed, but if I made some it would be to add baking soda to the sour cream, then fold into the bananas/sugar/egg, then lightly stir in dry ingredients. This makes for a very light and airy muffin. You could also add 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips. As others have stated, plain yogurt can be used in place of sour cream.

My husband enjoyed them but admitted he could tell they were low fat.  I could hardly tell.  My only complaint: they are too small!

These muffins are delicious and moist.  My 6 year-old loved them.  I used 1 cup + 2 tbs of cake flour instead of the AP flour.  I eliminated the salt and baking powder and used only 1/4 tsp of baking soda.  I added a tbs of brown sugar, and used 1 full tsp vanilla. I used reduced fat sour cream. Delish!!!! I will make this recipe again and again.

Great tasting muffins!  I followed the recipe exactly and they are yummy.  The only thing I would do next time is I would not use the muffin tin liners.  The muffins stuck to the paper.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious these were. I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. I also substituted the sour cream for light vanilla yogurt and added a small handful of chocolate chips. A+++++++

This calls for 1 Tablespoon of Baking Powder. It just seems like too much, maybe it should be 1 Teaspoon. I made this recipe and doubled it and used 1 Tablespoon Baking Powder. I could taste the Baking Powder in the muffin after it was made.

I used WW flour and replaced the sour cream with NF plain yogurt - my non-eating 2yr-old has just eaten three of them.

I have used this recipe so many times and my family adores them!

I actually changed the flour to a 1/2 white 1/2 wheat mix and then tossed in some wheat germ, cinnamon & nutmeg, (my staples). They were so delicious and they freeze like a charm. They are especially great for salvaging those ripe bananas! I always add more banana though, and I don't mash them all very fine, I leave some chunks, and they are a dream.

These are a wonderful, healthier version of banana muffins. I used flavored yogurt instead of sour cream so I reduced the sugar significantly, and also added about 1/3 cup of mashed strawberries.  I'd love to try this recipe using whole wheat flour and adding nuts.  These won't wow the socks off of anybody at a luncheon or anything (they're not super sweet, buttery or decadent), but they definately are a great on-the-go breakfast or a nice snack for kids and I will for sure make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  I'll definitely be making these again.  I made it even more healthy by using whole wheat flour and adding 3 Tbs ground flax.  I also replaced the sour cream with plain yogurt and the white sugar with brown and cut the amount of sugar in half. I reduced the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp and used 4 medium sized bananas.  It made 12 cupcake-sized muffins.  I kept a third of the batch plain and added a couple of chocolate chips to a third of the batch and fresh blueberries to the rest.  All three kinds turned out wonderful.  I ate one fresh out of the oven and all the prior reviews are right... it's not as good if you don't let it cool.  In fact, it's much better several hours after it cools.  Strange how that works...

I substituted plain yogurt for sour cream. It tasted light. Though my mom said it was the best muffin she'd ever had, it tasted kind of bland for me. I think 2 bananas didin't give enough flavour. Next time I make the muffins, I will use 3 bananas.

I have to disagree with most everyone else, these were not what I was hoping for.  The texture was nice, but they had a funny aftertaste and did not taste as banana-ish as I would have liked.

These are so good! I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar, fat free sour cream and 3 large ripe bananas. They have been out of the oven for less than 1 hour and half of them are already gone! This will be my permanent banana muffin recipe. My favorite part-no oil!!

I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with all of the rave reviews...I used yogurt instead of sour cream as one user suggested, but other than that made it exactly.  Not only are they not very sweet, they don't seem to have too much flavor at all, I think there needs to be a little more vanilla or sugar to bring out the banana flavor. Also, the texture is very much like a plain sponge-cake, not muffiny at all.  They are quick and easy but I will be shopping for a different recipe to use from now on.

Considering they're low-fat, they're very good.  Husband is not a big fan of "healthy" baking, and he didn't even notice and loved them.  2 yr old loved them too.  I used lite sour cream, it's all I had.

These muffins were rich and wonderful yet still low calorie!  I used non-fat sour cream and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also put half a cup of chopped walnuts on top, bringing the total to around 115 calories per muffin.  Half of the tin didn’t rise so well but I think it was because I over-mixed the batter.  I can’t stop eating them- I will definitely make these again.

When making these muffins, I replaced some ingredients, as mentioned in the comments, but found these muffins to be very bland.  They were very moist but just didn't have a very good flavor.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and vanilla yogart to replace the sour cream.  I also used splenda. Don't think that I'll make them again.

My husband loves these! I put them in the freezer, two each in a sandwhich bag and he puts them in his lunchbox for work in the morning. They are thawed and tasty by lunch. He's a diabetic so I used Splenda.

I substituted fat free half & half for the sour cream, and 50/50'd the sugar with splenda. The resulting texture was that of pancakes. I sprinkled walnuts on a few, and chocolate chips on some others. My co-workers liked them a lot.

This is now our everyday muffin mix. It's hard to believe that you can get a dozen out of the small amount of flour but they work every time.

This was a "just right" banana muffin.  Just sweet enough, just perfect banana flavor, and makes just about a dozen.  Fresh from the oven and buttered, they melt in your mouth.

Tasty!! I love it that these are low in fat too! a nice change over cold cereal for the kiddies. I added a touch of cinnamon. I only get 9 out of this recipe, and they are not overly large. What a great, easy way to use up those leftover bananas!

This recipe is a winner. I followed it to the letter and found no dryness problems
stated in other reviews. All ingredients went into a food processor at once and 
pulsed until blended. Texture and moisture, were perfect. Makes 6 ea. Extra-
large muffins or 12 regular-size muffins.

Fabulous recipe! Moist and delicious! I used fat free sour cream, so they had almost no fat.   My husband took some to work and everyone wanted the recipe.  Great breakfast or snack for the dieter! Thank you for posting this recipe.

Very healthy and a doesn't have nearly as much flavor as a regular banana bread recipe, but it is a low calorie recipe so it makes sense. It is still tasty and a makes a good snack.

Love this recipe! Just finished making my first batch & it tastes heavenly! 
I did 1/2 all purpose & 1/2 whole wheat flour, & added blueberries, ground cinnamon (I just eyeballed this instead of measured) & topped each muffin with white chocolate bits. I also like having a few little chunks of banana when eating the muffin so made sure I had a few good, small chunks when mashing the banana with other wet ingredients. 
I’d highly recommend this recipe to anyone. 17 mins in the oven was perfect for me too!

Made these cute little banana muffins last night.  I liked that these were very light and airy.  My regular banana bread recipe is very dense, so it is different in a good way.  Great if you're watching calories and need a quick on the go treat or breakfast item.  I didn't change anything in the recipe except I did them directly in the muffin pan without paper cups, and I tried them when they were nice and warm.  I actually prefer them warm from the oven.

This is my go-to banana muffin recipe. I tweak it with other goodies,  adding maraschino cherries, pineapple, chopped strawberries, white chocolate chips, etc., to change it up. Always great, everyone raves about them!

I made these with only two changes to the recipe: I used about one and a half cups of banana and I only used one and a half teaspoons of baking powder. I got ten muffins. They came out well, but have a very subtle banana flavor. Also, they started getting a bit sticky after a four days. I probably will make them again, but I'll add nuts or banana extract to give them more flavor.

Great recipe! I loved that it didn't need the use of any butter. My only modifications were that I used 3 ripened bananas (mashed) which yielded about 1 1/2 C of bananas (I just didn't want to waste half of the third banana) and then I added chocolate chips and chopped walnuts.
- Quick and easy!

Made these twice now and the flavor is delicious but both times they come out very mushy. Mushy as muffins and in bread form. What am I doing wrong? I'd love suggestions on how to "dry" these up a bit. Thanks!

Keep in mind these are on the healthy side of any muffin recipe. With that in mind, I love these as they aren't laddened with fat and sugar. You do give up the light fluffy texture that the fat provides. I sprinkled a bit of raw sugar on the top before baking as another review suggested. Do that!

I added more sugar (1/2 cup total), 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and another 1/4 cup of flour to the mix.  Completed the batter by adding 1/2 cup of dried cranberries (for color).  Poured into 6 jumbo cupcake liners, dusted the tops with sugar,  baked for 22 minutes @ 350 degrees. Great texture, does not crumble, moist. Perfection.

Although I am not very experienced when it comes to baking from scratch,I also thought the amount of baking powder was a typo. When I realized it wasn't,I read thru many of the reviews and made just a few adjustments. Decreased the baking soda to 1/2 tablespoon,increased the vanilla to a whole teaspoon,added 1teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. Only made 10 regular sized muffins,but they looked perfect  and tasted great. Love that they require so little sugar and no butter or oil.Next time I am going to try using  a low fat flavored yogurt .

Not the best, but definitely good for something so low calorie/low fat. I added another 1/4 cup of Splenda, and it still could have been sweeter. So I would definitely up the sugar.

These muffins have a very sponge - like texture, almost chewy.  It's also very bland tasting.  I added craisins, a little cinnamon and topped them with some sugar which helped a little but I don't think I'll make them again.

I just made these muffins exactly as written & I thought they came out nice. They are lower in sugar than most recipes so I knew they wouldn't be as sweet, but that sometimes is a good thing. The next time I make them I will add more banana. Thanks for sharing!

I made it to exact specifications except that I used gluten free flour (Pillsbury brand) -- my husband is a celiac.  They came out fluffy and not too sweet -- i definitely LOVE that this is a healthier version of standard banana muffins. You get the sweetness of the banana, but it's not too much. Next time, I'll probably add some cinnamon (because I love it) and another 1/4 tsp of vanilla. Thank you for sharing!

I just made these muffins  and they are wonderful! The only change I made was to add  full fat sour cream and some finely chopped pecans to the batter. They are moist, full of banana flavor and will be great to serve for a snack or a quick breakfast on the go!  This will most certainly be my new banana muffin recipe.

Really moist, I added chocolate chips and 4 bananas instead of measuring. Doesn't have an over powering banana taste but the perfect hint :)

I made this according to the recipe and my twin 3 year old girls ate them all before I even got to try one. I did not let them cool off over night in the refrigerator and did have the problem of them sticking to the muffin paper. But they were a big hit!!

Very good.  Followed the recipe except for using half whole wheat flour, half AP.  Easy, fast to make.  Very moist.  Only reason it doesn't get 5* is that I personally like a little crunch to the muffin top.  Think I'll have to add some cinnamon sugar &/or toasted nuts to the top next time.  But overall, a definite keeper!

Don't alter this recipe! Amazing just as it is. Lightest, fluffiest, moistest muffin I have ever had. I used 2 med bananas to make 1 cup. As for flour, I'm sure white, whole wheat or a combination of the two would work just fine.
Love that there is no butter or margarine, makes them seem like a healthier choice. Not cake like or super sweet like store bought - they are just right.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Almost there, but not quite.  I think it's a bit too much baking powder.  I think I would reduce it to 1/2 tablespoon or 2 tsp.  It does affect the taste.  I only got 8 muffins out of this recipe.  I would probably not try this recipe with adjustments.  I would rather just start with a better recipe.  I will eat these, but I wouldn't want to share them with others.  :-(

I made these yesterday! They are amazing---light and fluffy and yummy. I did not have fat-free sour cream so I used non-fat greek yogurt . I also added pecans and semi-sweet chocolate chips! I will definitely make these again!

Yum!  These came out great - even though I made it with non wheat flour (Bob's Red Mill GF Baking Mix + xanthum gum), and used Trader Joe's non dairy cream cheese for the sour cream.  I did add some cinnamon and also some dried cranberries because I had them.  Would also be good with walnuts added.  It made just 9 muffins.  However, those 9 are perfect - hard to find a good low fat, low sugar muffin recipe.

Actually, pretty good for a low-fat version. Reduced baking powder to 1 teaspoon, substituted Splenda for sugar, and added chocolate chips. Needed to bake an additional 5 minutes using my AirBake pan. Texture was spongy and moist. Made 6 BIG muffins.

I think there is a typo in this recipe because 1 tablespoon of baking powder is WAY too much for 1 c. flour!  I followed the directions as written and tasted the batter and it was extremely salty.  I added 1/4c. buttermilk and an additional 1/4c. sugar to hopefully salvage this recipe.  The muffins are baking now, hope they turn out ok.

My 2-year old was asking for muffiins. Thought I'd jump on my favorite recipe site and find one with bananas. Absolutely wonderful! Yes, I also subbed low-fat plain greek yogurt for sour creme, 1/2 whole wheat flour... and added some ground flax seed and protein powder. OK... and some mini chocolate chips and raisins. And splenda for sugar. So simple and quick! Definately a keeper!

I love this recipe! I Usually make it only substituting greek yogurt for the sour cream, but today I substituted white flour for 1/4 white, 1/4 almond flour, and 1/2 whole wheat. Can't wait to see how they turn out! They already smell great!

These muffins are delicious! I made them for breakfast for my husband and 3 kids that we take to church. The picky eater of the three didn't finish hers (she hardly eats anything though), but the other two really liked them. They are not overpoweringly sweet, which I really liked. The only change I made was I substituted sour cream for greek yogurt.

The easiest way to use up browning bananas!  I subbed plain yogurt for the sour cream and added 1tsp cinnamon and about 1/3c chocolate chips.  Definitely not your typical dense, cakey muffin consistency--they're airier, almost spongy, but good. And tall!

I have made these muffins several times, and they turn out great every time.  I usually stir about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans into my batter, which is also very good, but not necessary.  If you have 2 or 3 bananas that are turning too ripe to eat, this is a great way to use them up.

Very good, nice flavor and texture--but I kind of missed the slightly sweeter, harder top of muffins with more sugar.  But they taste wonderful without more sugar ... !!!

I just tried this recipe and this makes more than 12 muffins if extras (ie blueberries, chocolate chips) are added. I think I added too many blueberries because they all sank to the bottom and now I'm stuck with a muffin top and jam underneath. The cups were too full and the batter dripped over the edge, resulting in a burnt smelling, messy oven. Next time I will try these as mini muffins and use less bleberries or nne at all.

This is not a bad recipe for muffins, but not the best either. I did change it a bit though so may not be completely accurate. I used about a half cup of oatmeal in place of a quarter of cup of flour. I added a quarter teas of almond extract along with the vanilla. And I sprinkled the tops with a little cinnamon and sugar. Turned out pretty good:)

I keep muffins in our freezer for a quick breakfast (just microwave for 15-20 seconds and they're ready to eat), and these work great! Very good muffins with a nice mild taste.
