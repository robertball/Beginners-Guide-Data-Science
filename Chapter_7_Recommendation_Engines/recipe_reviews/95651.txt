Easy to do and NOT necessary to prepare in advance. I left out the onions as my girls would not like them. Turning on the broiler the last five to ten minutes put the burn on top we all fight for. Great potato flavor.

These really were a good alternative to regular mashed potatoes.  I halved the recipe and had more than enough for my 4-person family.  I would use a little less onion next time.

My husband called them "rich-y potaotes" on account of all the cream.  They were a hit at Thanksgiving this year, I will definitely make them again.  i probably didnt need to double the recipe, but more leftovers for me!   Some guests thought the onion gave it a neat au gratin taste  (also - I grated the onion instead of chopping it so the flavor was there without any little bits to bite into. maybe next time i'll add garlic!)

I made this today for Easter and everyone loved it. I didn't have time to make it ahead as directed. I cooked the potatoes last night and refrigerated overnight. In the morning I thinly sliced them on a hand grader instead of grating to get a texture closer to scalloped potatoes, and left the skin on because we like them. I mixed as directed except I used dehydrated onions instead of fresh. I refrigerated  them about 6 hours before baking. I tasted them before cooking and they reminded  me of potato salad. I wasn't sure how they would be. At the last minute I decided to dice and mix in about 10 slices of land o lakes white american cheese before baking. I don't think it needed the cheese but it was DELICIOUS  Thanks Ricci, whoever you are (=     I will be uploading my pic soon

Really delicious, made no changes! I did broil a little for browning at the end. Always get raves from the family. Love the ease of starting two days ahead.
