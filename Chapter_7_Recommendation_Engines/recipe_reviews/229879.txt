Made these for Recipe Group...We LOVED these! I did use whole almonds in place of the cashews b/c they are more affordable for me to buy (they worked out great!), but followed the recipe otherwise. I did end up adding more cinnamon sugar to get a better coating on them, so they wouldn't be sticky. These really came together quickly, and would be wonderful to give as gifts. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. ;)

Recipe Group Selection:  14, September 2013 ~ I'm a few weeks behind on making this recipe, but it got done.  Thought these were good, but think we would have liked them better made with almonds.  The honey flavor really comes through in this recipe.  Make sure they are completely cool before adding the additional sugar/cinnamon mixture.

These were pretty good, though not what you get at a fair.  The honey flavor was a bit overpowering and they were too sticky.  I prepared the recipe as indicated with only one exception.  In lieu of using all cashews, I used whole almonds, whole pecans and cashews in equal amounts.  These were fine, but I will be looking for another recipe.

I prepared these on PARCHMENT PAPER, not foil.  The nuts did not even consider sticking to the parchment paper.  Parchment paper is oven safe up to 420°F.  I only use foil when I am unable to use parchment paper.

Made these for Recipe Group. I had some problems with the mixture, I ended up with caramel almost on the nuts and had to pry them off the foil. I don't know if it would benefit from tossing the nuts in the mix first and cooking till dry and then roasting or if stirring in the oven would help. They were tasty, but I probably won't make again this way.

made this recipe for Oktoberfest party. Wasn't sure I had enough cashews so I added 2 cups of whole almonds and 2 cups of pecans (because they are my personal favorite) Turns out that made it the perfect amount - for a Double Batch!! Hurried and put necessary ingredients with original to double mixture. Other than accidentally doubling batch I added 1 TBS of sea salt before cooking. LOVED the results! Can't wait to see how they go over at party yet part of  me wants to keep some home!! ;-)

I quartered the recipe, and added only a pinch of cinnamon.  It only took about 7-10 minutes in my convection oven, stirring a few times.  I also added the finishing sugar while still warm, then I cooled the nuts.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon salt at the end.

Yummie nuts.  I used a mixture of nuts (cashews, almonds, and walnuts), didn't let them sit for the full 20 minutes after baking (they were starting to stick to the foil), and added a bit of salt in the sugar sprinkling.  I let them dry for about an hour after, stirring/shaking them loose sporadically, but they seemed a bit softer than I'd have liked.

I saw this on Recipe Group and happened to have a large container of cashews I needed to use. I don't know what I may have done wrong but these remained moist & sticky. I added a considerable amount of additional cinnamon sugar but it just absorbed the moisture and stayed sticky. The flavor was good and did enjoy picking at them but wouldn't make them to have for company as I had hoped.

I thought these were just Fine! I know that sweet things need a little salt, so in went a tiny bit with the honey mixture. Since I am aware of Splenda being sweeter then regular sugar, I took the liberty to add a sprinkle of Kosher salt to the top of the nuts. I used Splenda along with the cinnamon for the final topping. Good little snack!

I used salted cashews as that's what I had on hand and I added a pinch of nutmeg and and even smaller amount of clove because I love both. I only let them cool about 20 minutes because the honey was started to get too hard otherwise. I sprinkled the sugar over the nuts in small amounts then stirred, and repeated until all my sugar was used up. They  came out only the smallest bit sticky. These are delicious and I love them for a quick sweet treat!

Definitely a little too much honey I'd say because it just makes them way too sticky...however I threw them in a bag and froze them for a few hours and besides not being sticky anymore, it made a really awesome cashew cluster.

I had to alter the recipe a bit. After letting the cashews cool for 15 mins I started coating them in the sugar. It wasn't nearly enough. I had to quadruple the dry sugar portion of the recipe. I had to put them in a bowl with a bunch of the sugar mixture and break the nuts apart by hand while tossing them by hand. Also for my own taste...I added a 1/4tsp of sugar to each batch of the dry sugar portion. They turned out great!

This is a good starting point. I messed up a little bit because I cut the recipe in half and didn't cut the time down, so mine came out slightly burned. I think the biggest problem was that once the nuts started cooling, they began to stick to the foil. I was only able to let them cool on the foil for a couple minutes before i realized they would be a nightmare to peel off. Luckily, it seems like tossing the nuts in the sugar mixture before they were completely cooled helped, the sugar didn't melt and it kept the nuts from sticking to the bowl. I added a little salt to the sugar mixture, and next time I'd cut down on the cinnamon in the glaze to keep the cinnamon flavor from being too overpowering, but that's a matter of personal taste. 

If you plan on making these, I suggest keeping an eye on the nuts to make sure they don't burn and transferring them from the foil to the bowl before they're completely cool/stuck to the foil.

I'd say follow this recipe to a T for possible success. I think I let the cashews sit too long on the tin foil after they had come out of the oven and they became like peanut brittle and also stuck to the foil. I had to put the pan back in the oven to soften the honey to get them off, then cooled them the rest of the way on a regular baking pan. Although I didn't try it, I like Patty Cakes's idea of adding a little salt. I think that  might be better with almonds than cashews.

I made these for Christmas gifts.  They were very simple to make and tasted great.  The only thing I did different was to use decorating sugar (is that finishing sugar?).  It looked extra special with the larger sugar.  Can't wait to give them to family and friends.

3.13.17 Wow, are these good!  I scaled this recipe down, and baked 8 minutes (not 10-15) .  Would suggest not letting them get too brown, mine would have  been burned at 15 minutes, so watch your time.  I read the reviews, and a number of people said they had difficulty getting them off the foil. I’d suggest not baking these cashews to the point where the honey mixture has completely hardened.  As soon as you take them out of the oven, immediately move them to a plate to dry for 20 minutes, and then sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture on them.  At least this method worked for me, and I couldn’t have been happier with the way they turned out.  Of course, I knew  that I was going to luv these nuts, and I wasn’t let down.  DELICIOUS and going on my Christmas “Food From The Kitchen” gift list this year.****UPDATE 12.5.18**** I recently bought a 2-1/2 lb jar of whole cashews on sale at Costco, specifically for a Holiday Food Gift From the Kitchen this year.  Today I made  this  recipe again, and this time I baked for 13 minutes at 325ºF, that’s the time listed in the recipe. so I’m thinking the 10-15 minutes stated in the recipe is spot on.  The last time I made this recipe, they were done in 8 minutes, and I’m now thinking maybe I accidentally had the oven set at 350ºF.  Whatever, 8 minutes at 350ºF or 10-15 minutes at 325ºF, they’re still delicious.

Great recipe, and very easy. I added garlic salt instead of regular salt for a change. I also let the nuts cool slightly, not the full 20 minutes. The sugar stuck to the nuts better (I thought).
