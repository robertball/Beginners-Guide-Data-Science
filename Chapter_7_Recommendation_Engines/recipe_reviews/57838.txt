I made it once according to the recipe and it was pretty good.  The second time, I took a little extra trouble and cut up a fresh tomato and a couple of serrano peppers (instead of the canned) and it was super-delicious.  The flavors seemed a lot more vibrant and interesting.  My husband even gave it a 4.9 and he begs me not to make fish.

This is good.  I used canned tomatoes with lime and cilantro.  I forgot to buy cilantro so I didn't put in extra in.  I seasoned my fish with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder before adding the other toppings.  I also put all the fish in one pan and covered it with foil instead of individually wrapping each fish.  It stilled turned out pretty good.  I placed thinly sliced lime on top of each piece.  I would recommend adding more lime slices to give it that extra flavor.  Ultimately, I will make this again.

This was great! I used fresh tomatoes and skipped the chiles. Went heavy on the cilantro, and added salt, pepper,cumin and a little paparika. Served it over the mexican rice III by Alansmom on this site and it was delish!

Tried this with my family several times.  Kids and wife actually like it a bit better when I substitute the diced tomatoes and chiles with a fiery homemade salsa.  Great recipe and easy to make.

My entire family loved this recipe.  I skipped the olive oil and used PAM spray on the foil instead to save a few calories.  I've tried this recipe with all types of white fish and its great every time.  Try using pineapple or mango pico...both are yummy!

I made this recipe for my darling husband and myself tonight.  I found the fish to be lacking something; I haven't put my finger on it, yet.  I will try this recipe again, but I will add some spices like salt, pepper, garlic, etc.  My husband said it was good and he would eat it again.  It's great meal to loss weight too, but I have to figure out what it lacks.

I fixed this for the family and used salt, pepper, lime slices and oregano to season the fish before I popped them on the grill. I also took the advice of 1 reviewer and used fresh tomatoes and canned jalapenos. Boy! This was a Perfect summer time dish. MMMM Toasted up corn tortillas and passed around the chopped cilantro and green onions. Delish! I would like to try this with salmon next time. Thanks Surfwench. Keeper!!:)

I've made this dish several times and every time it turns out awesome!  I usually sprinkle salt and pepper on each side of the filets and use dried cilantro because I always forget to buy fresh cilantro. I also sprinkle the top with crushed red pepper flakes.  I serve it with Spanish rice and steamed veggies.  Great filling dinner!

This was good.  I used fresh tomatoes and serano peppers and threw in some mushrooms.  I think next time I might not use as much cilantro; it was a bit to much for me.

I thought the fish was kinda bland
recipe calls for no salt and with fresh fish of this type there isn't much of a flavor. 
I also thought that the only flavor that was well absorbed was the LIME
nothing like biting into a spicy tart lime.
the fish did taste better 2 days later
But I had so many leftovers I wouldn't try this recipe again.
It was A Big Dissapointment

I was snowed in the day I tried this, so I had to make do without cilantro or foil; I simply sprayed the bottom of a 9x9" baking dish; lightly added salt, pepper & very little garlic powder to the fish; spooned on the Rotel (I use the mild version that has cilantro & lime) and topped with lime slices. Baked with no cover, it was still tremendously tender and ridiculously yummy! The tomato & lime juices in the bottom of the pan end up basically poaching the fish, and the taste is awesome. Although I love fresh tomatoes and will probably try that version, this was an amazingly simple and delicious (and healthy, bonus!) way to get dinner ready in a big fat hurry. WIN.

Delicious and easy!  I substituted diced tomatoes with jalapenos for those called for to give it a little extra heat because my husband loves spicy.  I also used Pam instead of the olive oil to save on calories and used 1 T dried cilantro.  It was a big hit!

Delicioso! The foil pockets are ingenious! Used tomatoes and ancho peppers from the garden. Added salt and pepper. These made great fish tacos topped with mozzarella and a little salsa! Gracias!

I wanted something different and decided to try this recipe.  This was not to my liking in my opinion.  The end sauce had a strange and unappealing taste.  I normally love cilantro but I didn't think it worked well with this recipe.  Neither my son nor I could finish it.  You would be better off sprinkling lime on the fish and keeping it simple than doing this combo.  Not a keeper and I won't make it again.

This was a great, quick, and easy recipe. It left the fish incredibly moist. My husband and I are both watching our waistlines and this recipe was guilt free. We paired this reciped with a black bean and roasted corn salad. One tip, add more salt!

This recipe was extremely bland.  I would not leave the limes to cook with the fish, it gives it a bitter taste.  I felt it was better to squeeze fresh lime right before serving.

Made as stated. Very bland. Did as others suggested and had fish totally dried and it was still over juicy and sloppy.  That would have been ok if it had tasted better!  Won't bother with this again.

I thought this recipe was just ok. I used the Rotel canned tomatoes & chiles that already have lime & cilantro in it. I usually love this flavor combination so I it would be good with the fish. It was easy but it was pretty underwhelming. Also, this produced so much juice per packet there is no way I would open them at the table unless you want a big mess.

Very nice.  I didn't have canned so I chopped fresh, peeled tomato and one fresh chile, about a cup and a quarter.  On the other hand I didn't have fresh cilantro so used dried.  This fish is more poached than baked, as it cooks in the lime and tomato juices, which gives it a wonderful flavor and makes for a quick weeknight meal.  My bf never had tilapia this way and really liked it.  Thank you!

This was an easy dish to make and very enjoyable. I served this with Spanish rice, put a couple of spoonfuls of rice on a plate and set the fish and it's toppings right on top of the rice.

I did this slightly different - I put all fillets on a large piece of foil, spooned the diced tomatoes over the top, drizzled with lime juice and placed lime slices on top of that.  I didn't have cilantro so I used dried parsley and sealed with foil over the top.  I also baked it slightly longer, maybe 25-30 minutes.  It was served with rice and a vegetable.  Excellent dish if you are trying to lose weight but don't want to feel still hungry at the end of a meal.

We really liked this recipe!  We love more spice, so we added some creole seasoning to it.  Like someone else mentioned we used PAM olive oil instead of regular olive oil just to cut calories.  We will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for sharing!!

Excellent change up for Tilapia filets.  I used a fresh tomato instead (more on the ripe side) and jalapenos in vinegar instead of green chiles.  Great with Mexican Rice and beans.

Took the suggestions and added 1 clove of garlic, 1/2 tsp of cumin, a dash of paprika, salt and pepper.  Used 2 tomatoes instead of canned.  No chiles or cilantro.  Good flavour.  I rated this 4* because with all of the changes this isn't really the original recipe.

I thought this was pretty good- spicy and different. I served it with black beans and roasted corn on the side- really good. I would recommend making your foil packets a little bigger than the recipe states-- I had to start over again with larger pieces because my 8X10s were too small to seal off.

I actually made this recipe with chicken and just baked it for 30 minutes instead of 20.  It was amazing! Also added cilantro and a little lime juice to the rice I served with it.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This is an interesting blend of flavors. I think it is a good base for something, but I didn't like it very much.  Maybe changing out the canned tomatoes and chilies for fresh? I think mostly I didn't like the mixture of fish and tomatoes.  The recipe was supereasy though, and clean up was a the fastest ever.

Really good even though I had to improvise. I used fresh tomamoes, sauteed onion and garlic, bottled lime juice and threw in some white wine and cilantro in the end. Family loved it with fresh pinto beans and corn tortillas. Thanks for the idea!

I added a can of corn to the recipe as well as a tablespoon of minced garlic and a tablespoon of tequilla on each fillet then seasoned it with a little crushed red pepper and served it over whole grain rice. It was delicious.

I made this recipe with Birds Eye frozen stir fry mix which has onions and red and yellow peppers. The fish was deliciously moist and with great flavor. A big hit in this house.

I make this recipe slightly different -  without the tomatoes, first of all.  If you put olive oil on the foil, salt and pepper the fish (frozen is okay), then top with just cilantro and thicker slices of lime - that's all there is to it.  Cook in oven, on grill, or over a hot fire (camping).  Made this way it is simple and perfect.

I thoroughly dried the tilapia before putting it on the foil yet I still ended up with a liquidy mess. Too much juice from the tomatoes I guess. I didn't use much though. I would definitely recommend salting the fish before adding everything else. I have other ways of preparing tilapia that I liked better than this so I probably wont make it again. I was hoping it would have a good flavor with the tomatoes, chilies,cilantro and lime but all in all it was bland.

Tasty and healthy too! I used fresh salsa instead of the tomatoes and chillies mix and also sprinkled the fish with cumin for a little kick. I served it with tortilla chips and gaucamole. Yum! Next time I will put the tilapia in tortillas for fish tacos!

Thank you for this recipe!  I found it last summer - and subsituted some fresh garden salsa for the canned tomatoes, cilantro, and lime juice.  Excellent!  Have made this many times since using salsa I had frozen(the garden was very productive last year!).  So quick, healty, tasty, and easy! Also try using mango salsa!  For those who have found this dish runny - pat the filets dry before placing on foil and only add about a tablespoon the juice from the canned tomatoes to each filet.  Thanks again!

So simple to make and a big hit with the family.  I had mexican style stewed tomatoes which I chopped and drained and added some tomato sauce.  I'll definitely fix this again.

This was a hit at my house. I told the kids it was magical food and they enjoyed the foil packets.  The chili's were a little too hot for them- but my husband and I really liked it. A recipe I'll be making again.

The fish I used was very thin, and the juices in the recipe kept it very moist.  It was a pretty good recipe.  I enjoyed it, but also felt it was missing something.  I think I would skip the cilantro next time and maybe add some parsley and a little salt.

I made this for my 8th wedding anniversary along with another receipe on here for vegatables. It turned out great. The tomatoes add a really nice flavor to the fish along with the lime. We enjoyed it with a bottle of wine. Outstanding. I would definately make this item again.

This was just ok. I suspect the key to this recipe is to use a very high quality salsa or pico de gallo. I also didn't like the baked cilantro taste, I prefer it fresh. Don't think I'll make this again. If I do, I'll sautee the tilapia, and the top with salsa and cilantro.

I usually use whatever is in my pantry. I used canned diced tomato and a can of jalapeño salsa. It wasn't spicy enough so I added two sliced jalapeños from a can. I followed the recipe and added a lot of cilantro and it came out amazing!! I wasn't expecting so much flavor from a simple recipe. I can't wait to serve this at the next family dinner

Used ingredients on hand, so instead of chopped tomatoes, I used salsa. Instead of lime, I used a lemon. I put the lemon slices underneath.  I also had this jar of Mexican spices someone gave me as a souvenir from their vacation, so I sprinkled that on the fillet to season it.  (The recipe didn't mention anything about seasoning the fish, but I find that just a bit of salt and pepper before cooking any fish or meat makes such a big difference; a lot of advanced cooks take it for granted that you would do this). Then I also added a few drops of tequila down the length of the fillet, before covering it in salsa.  It turned out so well. I can't wait until I have the actual ingredients on hand, especially the cilantro.  This type of fish is so mild, that if you don't season it a little bit, you might very well find it bland.

I like to make a fish dish like this one, But I like to use fresh tomatoes, onion, Jalapenos and green peppers, cilantro.  I saute all the ingredients in olive oil; then I lay the fish on top add salt pepper and spicy smoked paprika. I add a little water and a fish bouillon cube cover and let simmer for ten minutes enjoy over white rice.

great after a few mods I added: salt, 1/8 tsp cumin, a clove of garlic, more lime juice, sliced fresh mushrooms. I substituted: a fresh tomato for canned. I made everything into almost a salsa and let it sit for a while.  Poured it over the filets in a glass baking dish, covered and baked.  Turned out a little soupy but great.

Pretty good! I think this would be a five star recipe if you used fresh tomatoes and peppers, but as written, it's tasty. Thanks :)

I read many of the reviews before i made this recipe and did alter it according to them. I sprinkled a little bit of cumin, garlic (just a LITTLE bit), salt, and pepper. aside from this i followed the recipe exactly. it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. Just ok. i will only make this recipe if i have too much lime juice and cilantro after i make salsa that i need to use up. otherwise i doubt i will ever make this again.

This recipe was great, but i did add one thing. I used about 4 Tbsp of sour cream mixed in with the green chilies and tomatoes to give it a creamier effect. I also added some white cheese on top and placed in the oven for a few more min. and this dish had no leftover in my house

Very juicy results, a lot of liquid. I wouldn't serve this for "elegant dining" as the foil pouches are not terribly attractive. Overall, nice simple flavors. The flavor of the fish can dominate since it is so mild, it might taste better with something other than tilapia. I added cumin, salt, and pepper, otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter.

Fantastic dish for summer time! I love to squeeze a lot of lemon and lime on top for flavor, but be mindful of using too much liquid, or can drain before serving, so that the fish is not too wet.

It was ok...followed recipe as called for.  Fish was bland.  I'll stick to my other recipes for tilapia from now on!

I just eyeballed the ingredients, and also added a pinch of salt. It turned out great - 20 mins was perfect. So quick and easy. Thanks!

Unfortunately, when trying new recipes, you'll eventually come to one that just doesn't work for you.  This was it.  Our family loves tilapia, but the tomatoes made it extra mushy and the lime juice didn't suit our taste buds.  Sorry.

Very Good and easy. I also added scallops on top to make it even more hearty.

This was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone at the dinner table. I did season my fish with salt, pepper and garlic powder before sprinkling with the lime juice and adding the tomatoes though. Next time I make this, I'll use my husband's homeade salsa rather than the canned tomatoes with chiles, simply cause his salsa rocks. I served the fish with beans and rice, and loved that this meal was so light and refreshing.

The fish came out great - soaked up the flavors and seasonings wonderfully! The cilantro was a good pairing with the lime. I put the packets on the grill like another reviewer, used fresh tomatoes and had it with a side of kale. A nice, quick, easy meal!

Good taste and easy to make.  I used more of each topping.  Next time I'll remove the rinds from the lime slices because they left a little bitter taste.  Bigger filets may require more than 20 minutes to bake.

I LOVE this recipe. I have made it several times on the grill and in the oven, and it is always a hit! We have 4 children and they all love this. I'm not sure why the complaints about it being too juicy in the bag - that is so much better than dry fish. Just open the bag up and transfer the fish to your plate before the table - not a problem.

WONDERFUL!!  Not only was the taste phenomenal, but the presentation is fantastic!  My fiance was crazy about it, said he felt he was having a gourmet mexican meal in a fancy bistro...don't skip on the cilantro, it adds the perfect flavor/touch. Usually served with wild rice & a homemade mexi-blend veggies.  I make this about once a month, and it's always a hit!

Yummy. I held the green chiles (I just cut up a tomato) but I bet it would be a lot better with the chiles.

My husband and I love this recipe and have it regularly.  We didn't need to use the olive oil on the foil because of the juices from the spicy tomatoes.  It is so light and easy to make.

This was super easy and had a great flavor. I used parchment paper and then wrapped it in foil. I used a red jalapeno and canned tomatoes. I added slices of garlic. Try it during the week for an easy, yummy meal.

It seemed like the fish didn't absorb the flavor of the tomatoes, chilis, and juices very well.  It's unfortunate because I was really excited about the recipe.  Perhaps it would work better if it was baked longer.  FYI, I cooked it for 35 minutes.

Definitely an easily prepared meal, and it looks beautiful in presentation.  I forgot to add oil at all, and it did not stick. The spice and freshness was very nice. The lower rating is because I find tilapia to "fishy" for my taste, and something to thicken the juices would greatly improve the recipe.
