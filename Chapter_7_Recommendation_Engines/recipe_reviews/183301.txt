No, DO NOT peel the fruit first... Leaving the rinds on gives it a much more interesting color and texture... Sorry about the vagueness.

This sounds like a variation of Shaker Lemon Pie, which I have made and everyone found delicious. I haven't made the Citrus Pie yet, but I will. P.S. I wonder if the person who thought the recipe was vague/incompatible actually tried to make it!

instructions are either unclear, or the makings are not compatable.

I had to make this myself as I don't take much stock in reviews from people who have never amde the recipes.  This was a waste of time and ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly-too much dough and jst tasted like sugared fruit rinds.  Would not make it again
