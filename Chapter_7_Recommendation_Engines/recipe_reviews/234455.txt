Smelled and tasted delicious! I think some of the dill should be cooked in the rice, not just in lamb/beans/onion mixture. Also, I thought it should be 2 1/2 cups of rice, not lbs, so thatâ€™s what I did. Otherwise, followed recipe closely. It was good, but better when mixed together rather than layered. I will make again.
