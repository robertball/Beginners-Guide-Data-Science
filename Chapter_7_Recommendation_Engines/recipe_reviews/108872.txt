My Husband found it a little dry. I think it certainly needs some oil.

This dish is simple and sooo good! I didn't change a thing on this one but will add a little more balsamic vinegar and broil the salmon in a smaller dish.

I cut this back to 1 portion but made it as written otherwise. The length of time really depends on the type of salmon and how thick it is. I think that Coho salmon would have worked better than the Atlantic salmon that I used. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
