I do believe these were really good, once I added a few changes of course. I felt that these would do better as a crock pot recipe. I was right! Instead of chicken I did a beef roast (as I had one in the freezer and I did not feel like deboning a chicken). I sprinkled salt, pepper, tons of garlic powder, onion powder, and instead of the chili powder I did smoked paprika all over my roast. I literally rubbed the roast in the seasonings. Then I made the sauce according to the recipe and let it cook 8 hours on low. I believe I only added a little bit more salt and it was delish! For me if something seems "plain" or "missing something" it is usually lacking salt, plain and simple. As for garlic and onion, I ALWAYS add that to all my recipes, just because I think all food can use that extra flavor.

Also, I should add that while these were delicious on their own, adding the coleslaw brought the flavors to a whole other level. I do believe I will make this again and try some different experiments for some more awesome flavors.

This was just alright for me.  We all liked it, but it was just alright.  I substituted taco seasoning because I had run out of chili powder.  I should substituted with Cayenne pepper seasoning instead.  It needed more spice for my taste.  I actually sprinkled the Cayenne pepper on my chicken after my first bite.  I did not have coleslaw on hand.  I am sure it would have been much better with that on it.

It's a good basic bbq recipe that can really be played with in the future. The fire roasted tomato sauce makes for a great base. Coleslaw is a must.

I made this for dinner last night and I followed the recipe as it should be. I liked it but, I felt like it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. The sauce tasted good, it really did, but I think if I used more spices it would have tasted less like a pasta sauce and more like a BBQ sandwich. Great base to work with though. I REALLY liked that it called for the coleslaw to be put on top of the sandwich rather than as a side dish. It really brought out some fun textures! Someone had suggested to cook this in a slow cooker which I think is a fabulous idea! All-in-all, not my favorite but, I liked it enough to experiment again with it.

I thought this recipe was good for a quick meal on a busy weeknight.  I added a few more spices including fresh garlic, fresh ground pepper, kosher salt and a tiny bit of ground cumin.  Served it on a fresh hoagie roll with a wedge of onion and a pickle.  All the flavors came together really well.

Quick and easy meal with store bought rotisserie chicken and coleslaw kit. The coleslaw gives it the added flavor needed.

This recipe get's points because all 4 of my kids ate it without complaining but that said my husband and I did not like this. In fact I was told not to make it again. The sauce is bland and needs some help. It is a good base but that is about it. With doctoring up this could be a lot better.

This is certainly a quick and easy sandwich to make.  However, it will require quite a bit of tweaking to transform it from chicken in tomato soup to a 5-star recipe.

In one word, boring. I really had to 'doctor' it up. At the end, it was a delicious dish, I just couldn't relay on the recipe alone.

This was just ok.  I even tweaked the seasonings a little after reading other reviews.  Instead of just chili powder I used a bbq seasoning which had the chili powder in it too.  I don't care for coleslaw much, so I topped with pickles.  I probably will not make this again, but I do think the Fire Roasted Tomato sauce would be best used in a pasta dish, so I'll try that next time.

I have to give this one 5 stars!  It was very delicious in my opinion.  I used Woeber's Sweet & Spicy Mustard instead of yellow mustard and instead of white sugar went with brown sugar.  Absolutely delicious.  Very quick and easy meal for a busy night!

Unfortunately these were a big flop on game day at our house. I tried to use the recipe exactly as written to give an accurate review. As written, these were basically inedible. I felt like I just soaked some chicken in tomato soup. My guests were also not impressed and most did not finish the first round of "un-doctored" sandwiches.
I added in a whole bottle of BBQ sauce and some cayenne pepper. That at least got the guys to eat them.
I don't think I will ever make these again. Prepared according to the recipe they are bland and the sauce is too thin.

This was a quick dinner, but the sauce was lacking in flavor. I think this needs a lot more seasoning to be a make-again dinner.

Made this for the family. Followed the recipe as listed. We all thought it was just ok. Probably won't make again, quite easy though. Could not find the "Progresso" fire roasted tomato sauce, so HAD to use spaghetti sauce that was similar.

This made for a really quick and easy weeknight dinner. I added some extra chili powder and Frank's Hot Sauce. I topped it with Vernell's Slaw from this site.

This sauce is more tomato-y than BBQ-y. I did not add the cole slaw, but I don't think it would be good with the tomato-based sauce. Probably would not make this again. I did make sure to reduce my sauce before adding the chicken.
