This was my first attempt ever at gingerbread.  I refrigerated it for 1.5 days because I got busy, and the dough kept well wrapped in plastic wrap.  YUMMY flavor--my 2.5-year-old and I both love them!  I didn't have enough molasses on hand, so I used probably about 2 Tbsp of corn syrup to make up for what I was missing.  It didn't seem to cause a problem.  For the other gingerbread virgins out there, here is my advice: first of all, when you take the dough out of the fridge, it will seem rock hard.  Don't panic, it softens as you roll it.  Only roll out 1/2 at a time as it gets very soft, very fast.  Second of all, don't forget to MOVE the cookies to a wire rack after 1-2 minutes as listed.  I got busy with my toddler and forgot, and my first batch stuck pretty good to my cookie sheets.  I had to be careful to not crack them to pieces when removing them.  With the next batches, I removed them after 1 minute with no problems at all.  Happy baking!

Exactly what I was looking for. The taste and texture are great and the dough is SO easy to work with. After making 8 batches of sugar cookies it was so nice to move to this dough which rolled and sliced so easily. I am an expert baker and I really love this dough! You can up the spice if you are looking for something super spice-laden, but this one is great for kids. A tip for molasses: spray the measuring cup with cooking spray and the molasses just slides right out!

This fantastic recipe is a favorite of my cooking students!  The balance of spices and flavors is perfect and the "men" turn out just right each time we make them.  To complete this recipe in 1.5 hours we patted the dough onto a Corelle dinner plate and put it in the freezer for 15-20 minutes.  This thinner layer of dough chills quickly making the men easy to roll out and cut.

This recipe is delicious and the dough was easy to work with! To avoid rolling out the dough too many times and inevitably adding more flour, I separated the dough into 3 flattened disks before wrapping and refrigerating them. After an hour, I took the dough out of the fridge and rolled out each disk until they were the right thickness (for me, about half a centimeter). I then re-wrapped each disk in plastic and refrigerated them overnight. The next day, I simply unwrapped the disks, placed them onto my floured counter and cut out the gingerbread men!

I don't cut these out or chill the dough. I roll the dough into small balls and roll in sugar. I use a small glass dipped in sugar and flatten them out. I bake them right away and call them Molasses cookies.I wanted a recipe that called for butter and not shortening.This recipe turned out great.

Just to add to my last review - I cooked the cookies for about 5 minutes longer, making them crunchy rather than soft. The molasses aren't so overpowering anymore. Now I can't stop eating them! I would use less molasses, more cinnamon.

Excellent, just as written.  My personal preference is a slightly puffed (no spread) cookie with a little bit of a spice kick.  Therefore, for my second batch, I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup, increased the ginger to 2 tablespoons, the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons, the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon and added a teaspoon of ground cloves.  This recipe is fabulous.

Made this recipe two days before Christmas.  Followed recipe exactly.  These were the best.  Throwing away any previous recipes I had for gingerbread cookies.

I have tried this recipe twice and both times the dough turns out very dry and crumbly. I would not recommend this recipe.

I've made this recipe twice now, and the cookies were a huge hit both times. I personally love the cookie because I think it is the perfect incarnation of what a gingerbread man cookie should be. They are firm, but still cakey enough. The consistency is perfect, and they are packed with flavor. Highly recommended. Don't alter anything!

Love this recipe. The gingerbread turned out really good. This recipe called for the gingerbread to be put in the fridge for 4 hours or over night but I only put it in for 1 hour and it was fine for me to roll out.

This was my first time trying this recipe. The consistency of the finished cookie was very nice and they were easy to make.  They were a bit bland for my taste, however. I think next time I will add a bit more ginger and perhaps some ground gloves to spice them up a bit more.

Little orbs of HEAVEN!! Gorgeous flavour, gentle, warm, not hot and spicy. I creamed all the wet ingredients first, then added all the dry at once into my mixer, and the batter was light like a frosting! My absolute favourite cookie now. FIVE STARS!!!

Followed it exactly, even refrigerated the dough for 8 hours.  So sticky, it was impossible to handle!  If someone knows what I could've done wrong, please let me know. This recipe has amazing reviews so I was really excited! I ended up wetting my hands to handle the dough to flatten it out with my hand since it was WAY too sticky for the roller.. then trying to put the cut out lil men on my pan was impossible.  The dough wouldn't release so their legs, arms, heads would tear off as I was trying to separate them.  sigh.  3/4 of the dough is still in the fridge because I have no idea how to handle it!

I've been making gingerbread cookies for 45 years.  This is the best recipe I've ever used, I had to make 3 batches!   Do 1 minute less for a soft cookie if your kids like soft not 'snappy' cookies.  LOVE them.

The recipe is a 5.  
The only thing I changed was the molasses, used on 3/4 cup.
The spices I played with too added a pinch more of cinnamon and nutmeg.
Made this for my daughters kinder class for them to decorate.  The kids loved them!
I had never made gingerbread cookies before now i've found a recipe for life.

The drawback to this recipe is that my dough was really sticky.  I followed the recipe as written and put in the fridge for 6 hours.  I used 1/3 of the dough at a time, leaving the remaining dough in the fridge.  To make the dough work here's what I did: I was working on a floured surface so I rolled out the dough, then lifted the dough up and put down a thicker layer of flour, then cut the cookies with cookie cutters dipped in flour.  I also reduced the baking time to about 6-7 minutes.  The baked cookies were soft with good color and flavor. I would use this recipe again but I will keep looking for an easier to use recipe.

I'd have liked a bit more gingery bite, but the cookies are really good even so. I did increase the cinnamon to 2 tsp, the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp cloves. The cookies cooked very fast in my oven. I had to take them out after only about 7 minutes.

I am not good at cut out cookies, but these turn out great every time. Texture and flavor are perfect. Not too hard or too strong of a flavor, even to people who don't normally like gingerbread.

Excellent basic gingerbread cookie recipe. I follow this to a T and always comes out perfect. Not a strong ginger taste which the kiddies love.  Recently I have added a teaspoon of cocoa powder to give it a chocolatey lift!

This is a very good gingerbread recipe. It's a standard that has been around for ages. If the recipe is followed as written it works.

Delicious.  I rolled them a bit thicker (1/3" maybe?) because I like them softer.  I frosted them with buttercream frosting and decorated with gumdrops, they turned out perfectly!

These were DELICIOUS!  I cut them into football shapes for the playoffs last weekend, and they came out great.  I will definitely be using this recipe any time I want gingerbread cookies.  They are still pretty soft after three days too.

I thought this recipe was perfect. It even worked well with Blue Bonnet Light and Ener-G egg replacer (we have to use those due to food allergies). The only thing I did differently was I refrigerated the dough in a plastic container rather than saran wrap. We put vanilla frosting on the cookies. They were delicious, the texture was perfect, and they were gone within 24 hours. We will be making them again soon.

Not as spicy as I like.  8 minutes for soft like Sarah likes or 10 for a crunchy cookie.  Sarah and Dave's fav.

I actually loved this recipe, however I didn't follow it exactly. It was an amazing recipe with just a few modification. I Used a full cup of buttermilk instead of 1/2 cup of normal milk , increases the red colouring to 1.5 ounces , vanilla extract to 3 teaspoons , baking powder to 1.5 teaspoons and added half a teaspoon of lemon zest preferibly fresh. I also used self raising flower and used 2 1/4 cups instead of  2 and a 1/2 so that my cupcakes are extra moist. Since they are red velvet cupcakes I reduced amount of cocoa powder to 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup so as to avoid my cupcakes becoming too chocolatey in flavour. I leaved the frosting as it is qnd actually got 32 medium sized cupcakes with extremely good taste. Made them twice already and I discovered this recipe 2 weeks ago. That adds up to a total of 64 cupcakes :) this recipe really was a hit ! Got compliments all day and even received presents from people I made cupcakes for. Our neighbour who is a pro baker even told me to hand her my recipe! How awesome is that ! Amazing recipe ! Go for it ! You won't regret it :)

Simple, easy to follow and make recipe. The cookies are delicious, soft and chewy. I didn’t change a thing to the recipe and I’ve made the cookies three times this season. Every time they came out perfect. The seasoning and balance of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and molasses was perfect for my taste but the recipe is forgiving if you want less or more flavor. Highly recommended!

Perfect taste and texture.   I love gingerbread cookies, but they are usually too crisp.   This recipe yields cookies that are structured and hold their shape (they do not spread), but are soft when you bite into them.   I am a terrible baker and this recipe was easy to follow and the dough was relatively easy to roll out.    I made a slight adjustment and used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter.

FOR starters, I made this and the dough was all crumbly.  Couldn’t get it to form together... I saw one reviewer had the same issue... as I was chilling it, I decided to make a second batch, I DIDNT BEAT THE BUTTER BROWN SUGAR PROPERLY THE FIRST TIME, SECOND batch is currently chilling to be baked in the morning.... looks awesome

I didn't have butter, so I used a  Butter Crisco Stick. These came out better than any gingerbread man cookie I have ever bought in a bakery.  My family absolutely loved them.

This was my first time baking gingerbread man cookies.  I love baking, but whenever there is a rolling pin involved, it's always hit or miss.  We refrigerated the dough for 4 1/2 hours.  Then divided it in half.  Rolled the first half out onto a floured surface.  It started sticking. Added more flour.  Still sticking.  Stuck it back in the fridge.  Pulled out the other half.  Rolled it between two pieces of saran wrap.  Perfect.  
You need to work quickly.  Once the dough gets close to room temperature, it's hard to work with.  
TIPS FOR BEGINNERS-  wrap dough in a disc shape, as stated in the recipe.  Allow to firm up for two hours.  Then roll it out between two pieces of saran wrap to the 1/4 Inch thickness.  Wrap it in  saran wrap and refrigerate for another two+ hours.  It makes cutting out the shapes so much easier!  No sticking to the table, no breaking because the dough was to warm.
We replaced the nutmeg with cloves.  Decorated with royal icing.  Mmmmmm.  Thank you for sharing a delicious recipe.

These were good, but I frosted them with an orange zest frosting and then decorated with colored sugars and candy's, the cookies stay soft and are sinfully good,kids from 1-92 love to decorate and eat them !! They freeze well, even frosted(wax paper each layer)for up to three months so I double or triple the recipe,and save some, for Valentines day to decorate in black, red,pink,white.

The recipe either needs less flour or some water in it. I also think that baking powder should be in the ingredients list. I'm still determined to figure out how to make gingerbread, so I'm going to try this again, but add baking powder and only add dry ingredients until I have a moist doughy consistency. If I put all the dry ingredients in as directed, the dough just breaks apart. Stay tuned. I'm going to try this next week for my work pot luck.

First of all, I made ginger turtles not gingerbread men ha ha. I followed the directions as listed. I made the wet items first, And in a separate bowl mixed the flour cinnamon ginger and nutmeg. Then I combined them and blended everything. Only cooled them for 1.5 hours. Did turtle cutouts. No problems.

First time using this recipe and loved it. I used a little less molasses and a touch more cinnamon and accidentally a 1/4 cup extra butter (baking with the kids) they turned out great taste wonderful but not too spicy and the kids all loved them!

Used this recipe yesterday because I wanted to try something different.  I always used Wilton's recipe.  This was ok, but the taste is kind of bland according to my children so they are adding royal icing to them and it taste a whole lot better.  The dough was kind of sticky when putting it in the saran wrap and when it came time to use it I had to keep adding flour so it didn't stick to the surface or roller.  Just takes a lot of work but not a bad recipe.

Delicious recipe! It makes a generous amount of cookies. It's the easiest gingerbread cookie dough that I have worked with- even though I still recommend flouring the surface you work on.

Perfection. In case you're time-crunched like me, two hours to chill the dough was adequate. I put half the dough on my workspace, other half in the fridge to keep chilling while I rolled, cut, and baked the first dozen.  The cut dough held its shape ok. If you can chill longer, do. Don't fret if you only have two hours though.

Perfect as is! Right In between the crisp/crunchy cookies and a chewy cookie. Nice lighter gingerbread flavour - but I did add 1/4tsp cloves as well. Other than that made as directed! 

They do fluff up a bit so roll to less than 1/4" thick for sure. Make sure to take off baking pan within 1-2min out of oven to ensure they don't stick! Will save this recipe.

Delicious! I make these every year with people still asking for more. The only thing I would change is that I would add more spices; probably a little less than double. Also, I added a pinch of cloves and a little bit of lemon zest. Makes it even better:)

It is great recipe, but it was too mild to our tastes. I will increase amount of spices next time. Otherwise, I baked 9 min and came out perfect!

Great in all respects except not nearly spicy enough, even after increasing spices by 50%.  Will make again, but will double the spices and add ground cloves.

Loved the taste! Not overly sweet. The dough warmed up quickly after refrigerating. Wondering how to avoid that to get better shapes.

Followed the recipe exactly and most disappeared before we had a chance to decorate them;) We went with 7 minutes for soft ones, and made a few crunchy ones for 9 minutes, both were great.

Good recipe. I followed it and made one change to the light flavored molasses. I left it in the fridge for 14 hrs before making them. Good taste and consistency.

I followed the recipe for thumbprint cookies but without the nuts or caramel. Instead, I flattened them with the bottom of a glass and once baked and cooled, I spread a thin layer of Nutella on the bottom of one cookie and topped it with another to make a sandwich cookie.  I decorated them with royal icing and red or green sanding sugar.

SO delicious! I made the dough the day before and was super worried when I started rolling out the dough and it kept crumbling. I cut the dough in half and slooooowly rolled it out. It worked a lot better this way. The dough got much softer once it sat out a bit for later cookies. I baked at 350 for 8 minutes exactly. The cookies came out firm but soft—not hard and crunchy which I’m not a fan of. The perfect gingerbread cookie recipe!

These are excellent!  I usually make another recipe for gingerbread cookies that does not have molasses because I really don't like that taste. But I'm glad I gave these a try because they were very good!  Not a strong molasses flavour at all and not too "spicy".  Perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

I did make changes based on others' recommendations but I loved the cookies and so did my youngest boy!  I doubled the spices (except the salt) and added some ground clove, same as nutmeg.  The dough kept shape very well and days later the cookies are still great.

i think most folks would like this cookie, but my picky kids thought it was too molassesy. next time will do 1/2 molasses and 1/2 corn syrup.
 dough def needs to be chilled to be rolled out, i chilled for 35 min in the freezer.

Cookie dough was phenomenal. I replaced the nutmeg with cloves and the molasses with honey. The cookies came out nice and crisp, but the sweetness was a little underwhelming. Still, it's the best gingerbread cookie recipe I've come across. I ended up adding some homemade buttercream on top to make up for the lack of sweetness. Plus it's very kid friendly! Made this with my little sister (3 years old) and she had a great time.

Honestly, these were the worst gingerbread cookies I've ever tasted. I don't usually write reviews but I had to make an account to write this and hopefully help anyone who wants to please family during the holidays. I had high hopes because of the amount of positive reviews and because the dough did not taste bad. I followed the recipe exactly how it was written. Left the dough in the fridge overnight. I rolled it out very thin, but the first batch puffed up way too much and were too soft. I rolled it thinner and cooked it longer but the results were part of the cookies were hard and part soft - SO off putting. I could have cooked them longer but then the edges would most likely burn. The gingerbread taste was very light and not sugary enough throughout the cookie. I'm just really disappointed because I was so excited to try this recipe and share these with family and friends but this is the first time I'm going to just toss out cookies I've baked. I wouldn't even want to donate these to the food bank, it would just be insulting to them because they look adorable and like they'd taste good, but once you take a bite you want to spit them out.

Wow! These are amazing! I made them a little thicker than the recipe called for and iced them with royal icing and they were great. I did not chill them in the fridge, which was fine, it just required a little more flour when the dough got sticky.

My first time making ginger bread cookies and they came out good.  I chilled the dough overnight and used a 2 1/2 inch round cookie cutter.  I also increased the baking time to 13 minutes and they came out soft with crisp edges.

Ended up with a really good texture, but the flavor and color was a bit off. Idk what I did, but it wasn't as brown and gingerbready as I wanted it to be. Still alright though!

This was my first time ever baking gingerbread cookies from scratch and they turned out perfectly. The only thing I did  differently  I added maple flavoringInstead of vanilla extract because I was out of vanilla extract and they still tasted delicious.

I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies came out just fine. The second time I added an additional 1/2 cup of flower to the batter. It was necessary to do this so the batter would not be so sticky. I also baked the cookies without refrigerating the dough first as I don't feel that it is necessary.

PERFECT SOFT CHEWY GINGERBREAD!!
I was worried these might not stay fresh as I made them (exactly as described) a few days before a Christmas party but I worried over nothing as these are STILL fresh a week after the party finished.  I will definitely make this recipe every year! I refrigerated overnight in three separate pucks to make working on the dough easier the next day.

These were really soft and delicious, they stayed soft for a whole week! Make sure to keep in sealed container with a piece of bread so your cookies stay moist longer. This recipe is a keeper, thanks!

So good! They didn't even need frosting. The dough yielded 40 gingerbread men for me and they were all gone at the Christmas dinner. Not to bland for kids not to sweet for adults Perfect and Delicious.

This was a fun and easy recipe.  I had never made gingerbread cookies before so I was concerned about overbaking and only baked 7-8 minutes. I am going to bake longer next time because these cookies were a bit too soft and didn't stand up so well to decorating (though they didn't just crumble...they did ok). I baked on parchment paper, just an FYI.  Also, a good tip I happened upon is that if you are cutting out cookies, when you go to reroll the scraps from between cuttings, put the dough bits back in the saran wrap and roll inside the saran wrap.

I've made these 3 Christmases in a row and have received rave reviews each time. They have the perfect amount of chewiness and firmness. They don't balloon in the oven making their shape unrecognizable. This is the recipe to make!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  The only change I made was wrapping it in smaller portions to chill the dough.  Once chilled I found it easy to handle .  This made about 24 gingerbread boys.   Use royal icing to paint on buttons and faces.
We will definitely be adding this recipe to our cookie arsenal!

Stays soft, doesn't get hard like other cookies. The dough is really soft, but totally worth it!

Yummy. Ended up with 36 cookies. Dough was easy to work with. It helped to form 2 discs before putting it in the fridge.

So yummy! This was my first time making gingerbread men. I have to say these are the best tasting cookies ever! The only changes I made was to the spices. I never  measure my spices, I add more than what the recipe calls for. One tip I used from one of the comments was, I rolled the dough in between two pieces of plastic wrap. I did this to avoid extra flour on the cookies. I also discovered thst when taking the cookies off of the trays, its a good idea to start from the head down to the toes. Prevents the cookies from breaking. I also chilled my dough overnight.

I was surprised how well the dough held it's shape. It did not take long for this to get crisp and crumbly. The flavor was good and could see these disappearing quickly as cookies. I made this into a gingerbread house and was pleased how well it held up. The crisper texture worked for what I was needing. If I was making this just into cookies I would be very watchful of time and thickness of the dough depending on how much of a crunch you want on these.

These cookies were outstanding! Soft in the center, crispy on the edges... the perfect snow day treat! We used a gingerbread man cookie cutter and they kept shape very well. If you're not a big fan of molasses then you probably won't like these as they have a strong molasses flavor. I prefer to add extra spices to recipes, so I doubled the nutmeg and added 1/2 tsp. more cinnamon. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.

I recently bought Star Wars cookie cutters and knew I had to make some cookies for May 4th. A coworker requested gingerbread, and so I tried this recipe.  The only things I changed were increasing cinnamon to about 1 1/2 tsps and I rolled out the dough with powdered sugar instead of flour.  I am definitely not going to have any cookies left by lunch today! Everyone loves them.

my 2 year old nephew helped decorate them with sprinkles before they were baked, and with icing after they were baked!
this will be the gingerbread recipe I will always go to during Christmas!

First time making gingerbread cookies, reading the recipe I was worried it might be a little on the bland side so I was bold and upped the amount of ginger (3tsp instead of the recommended 2tsp) used 1/2 tsp nutmeg instead of 1/4 and also added 1/4 tsp ground cloves - the result was all I could hope for and went over well with family and friends. Wonderful aftertaste. I will be using the recipe again in the future. Perfect winter cookie (it helped that it was -15C the day I made them, so the extra dough trimmings after wielding the cookie cutter was easy to re-harden by leaving it outside for about 15 minutes.

This was a very good recipe but I would make some changes: put a bit less of the molasses and the brown sugar, as well as less flour. If you spread the dough before you put it in the fridge, it would only take about an hour, more or less depending on how thick it is. I would also add more of the spices, perhaps twice as much. Overall, the recipe was pretty sweet and the spices were very much hidden, but a very good recipe for kids and goes great with tea.

Made it exactly as the receipe and the cookies are great!  I love the flavour lots of spice!  I found the first time I rolled it out the dough did crack alot, but I put the left over bits in the fridge again and rolled it out a little slower the 2nd time and it was much better.

This was a perfect recipe for gingerbread. I did increase the ginger to 2 tsp and the cinnamon a bit as well because I like my cookies spicy. The dough held together well and kept a decent shape without being dry. Just make sure you don't roll the dough any thinner than 1/4 inch and don't over bake if you like soft cookies.

The dough is very sticky and doesn't cut well unless covered in flour. The cookies rose quite a bit - a bit too fluffy for my liking (and I rolled them flatter than 1/4 inch). The taste was good, but a little dry. 

I cooked the first pan at the recommended 350 for 10 minutes and they burnt. The second pan went in for 7 minutes and were better.

I chose this recipe because I did not want to use shortening in the cookies.  I made both the gingerbread men and the kiss cookies rolled in sugar and they are excellent.  My husband usually doesn't care for gingerbread and loved them.  I also pressed some of the men in the sugar for something different.  Very good.

Best gingerbread cookies ever, especially for kids!  My boys loved them, even my eldest who "doesn't like gingerbread cookies".  It has the classic gingerbread taste without being overpowering or having a spicy feeling.  The dough was so easy to work with, not too sticky or dry.  My boys, ages 7 & 12 were able to make all the cookies by themselves!  If they were thin, the cookies had a great cruch, and if you left them a little thicker, they were soft and chewy.  This will be a go-to recipe for my family.

These were very good! Delicious taste. My kids loved them. The dough was easy to work with. I put it in the fridge for 2 hours. I made a double batch. The first half I rolled out and the rest I let the kids use it like playdough and make the shapes. They all turned out amazing. We used the butter frosting on this site to ice them. Super yummy! It made at least 5 cookie sheets full with the double batch. I baked them for 8 minutes. I had to use my large mixer for the double batch. My smaller one couldn't handle the mixing. Thank you!!

Followed the recipe exactly, but used small cookie cutters for little fingers so I reduced the cooking time. Dough was easy to work with and the flavour is nice and mild. Not overly spiced??

Personally I found the flavors a little off balance -- too much molasses, and not enough spice.  The second time around, I replaced the brown sugar with white (to cut back the molasses flavor), increased the ginger and cinnamon by half a tsp, and added about a 1/4 tsp of allspice. Much better then!

Absolutely great recipe.  I have never made a good gingerbread recipe until making this one.  I'm not a very good baker and for this to turn out so wonderful is a surprise!!!

 I'm going to make a gingerbread house with it.  It will be grand because the dough hardens just right.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!!!

Followed directions exactly.  Made a double batch.  Yield 40 4"cookies/men.  Really good tasting, nice texture & color, easy to roll, cut, and bake .. did not need 2" space between cookies on pan.  Even the thinnest cookies held their shape and held up to a child icing them.  Strongly recommend as much icing as you can get as the sugary sweetness of the icing offsets the ginger flavor well.

Molasses was really strong. It could have been my molasses brand. I may try it again with less molasses or lighter molasses. It was fun to make with my 4 year old!

So easy and delicious!  My 5 year old decided we NEEDED to make gingerbread men. This being my first time I gave this recipe a try. Could not have been easier or more delicious.  I refrigerated the dough overnight and rolled it out with a bit of powdered sugar instead of flour.  They cut so easy I wish my sugar cookies were that easy to cut.

I have done a lot of baking for well over 40 years, and I did not care for this recipe.  Made as is, and it was so sticky that I had to add so much flour that it was tasteless.

Incredible! Delicious! I made these at work as an activity with seniors.  I didn't have time to refrigerate the dough for hours so I used a lot of flour on the cutting board and rolling pin to prevent sticking.  The dough is very soft when room temperature.  I used a spatulla to transfer the cookies from the cutting board to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  They didn't grow and puff up and lose their shape like sugar cookies do.  They slid right off the parchment paper.  They looked perfect and tasted just how you expect gingerbread cookies to taste.  Everyone who had them raved "I usually don't like gingerbread cookies but I like these."  There was a good amount of spice and sweetness.  We piped on vanilla frosting and used red hots for the buttons and eyes but they are also delicious plain.

I measured the ingredients exactly except for adding extra ginger and the dough was very easy to work with. I only refrigerated it for half an hour, using half the dough at a time. Not sure what the complaining was about. If it sticks a little to the rolling pin just put a little flour on it. The cookies were moist and wonderful!

Fab recipe easy to make and great taste! I will definitely use it again in my future Christmas preperations. Also I found it a bit easier to work with once the dough had warmed a little after being out of the fridge.

Excellent recipe!
Disclaimer: I ATTEMPTED to follow it exactly, however, am in Italy at the moment so I had to use the metric converter, which always seems to short change the flour (I added more until the dough seemed reasonable to roll and didn't stick like crazy to my fingers) as well as just added a bit more molasses (because brown sugar doesn't exist here, but you can substitute with about 1 c regular sugar and 1 Tbs molasses, so long as you can find molasses somewhere).

ANYWAY, they turned out fantastico!! Very gingerbready taste, soft, shaped well without breaking, and we all loved them! I also had to make my own cookie cutters (because, you guessed it: gingerbread men cutters don't exist in Italy either!), which can be done easily by shaping strips of a sliced up pop can (thank you pinterest!!). Therefore, my cookies were RATHER on the small side (obsiously, less than a popcan diameter), and a half receipe turned out to make about 40 of these small little men.

I also used the dough to make a little gingerbread church, which I have never done before but was adorable and easy (once I got the shapes right)!! 

I also used buttercream icing (butter, powdered sugar based) which worked great, but I later found the traditional is actually royal icing (whipped egg whites and powdered sugar).

Doubled the spices based upon posted reviews. Flavor was still not spicy enough for my taste. Dough was easy to work with but definitely split into two pieces so you can swap out every 15 minutes with the other in the fridge or freezer.

This recipe was just what I was looking for. I wanted something that called for butter instead of shortening and this was perfect. I did end up using more spices and added clove to the recipe. Also the recipe came out very sweet and next time I will cut down the sugar at least a 1/4th a cup. I didn't have brown sugar so I just used white sugar and added a teaspoon extra of molasses. They came out really nice and soft and chewy and were very easy to frost. Had nice color and everyone loved them!

These are amazing. Made them last night with my kids and they were a huge hit. Easy to make and my 13 year old son actually said "these are better than Grammy's" that's a huge compliment!! Thank you

used cookie cutters and they didn't keep the shape super well, but the texture and taste was pretty good.  so far the better gingerbread cookie recipe I've made.

First time making gingerbread men and they came out great. I added 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves but otherwise followed the recipe as written. For timing - I baked until their little feet were set, then let them cool on the baking sheet until it was cool enough to handle before tranferring them to cooling racks to cool completely. Decorated them once they were completely cool with royal icing.

We have made this around Christmas time every year for around 4 years. Always comes out great each time. We tend to make them more thick though because we like the softer type of cookies that comes from it. Everyone loves this recipe and the cookies never last long. If done correctly they come out great each and every time. :)

I liked this recipe. I used double the spices and it turned out really well. Also for those who don't like waiting for four hours for the cookies, just freeze it for 1 and1/2 hours and it works just as well.

After reading some reviews, I used one quarter cup light corn syrup and one quarter cup molasses.  I thought they might have been a little more ginger-y, but I like to really taste that ginger.  I let them refrigerate for about three hours only and had great success.  Baked the full time and ended up with nice crunchy cookies that were a hit.  Oh, and a as side note, I used half whole wheat flour and they were still good.. Not rocks :)

These are outstanding.  My family does not normally like gingerbread men as much as other flavors, but these got raves.  Dough was very easy to work with.  Will use again for Valentine's Day instead of the traditional sugar cookie.  These are much better!

So, the cookies tasted good, but they tasted more like molasses than ginger. This recipe needs to be modified.

This is a terrific base recipe, but the spices are a bit off - the cookie didn't taste very "gingery" to me (although it was still a tasty cookie). I tasted the nutmeg a little more than I wanted to, however the cookie texture is PERFECT and actually stays perfect even after a few days (I find that other cookies get hard after a few days).  So I will simply play with the spices next time - bump up the ginger and reduce the nutmeg. I told everyone this was a "ginger nut" cookie.  Instead of cutting shapes, I simply rolled my dough into small-medium balls, then used a glass to press them a bit flat, and I topped with sugar (using a glass rim dipped in sugar on each flattened cookie dough before baking).  The result? pretty amazing even though the spices weren't quite what I hoped. I will use this forever!

My granddaughter wanted to come over and bake Christmas cookies with me, and when I asked what kind she said gingerbread men. Having never made them before, I thought I'd give your recipe a try. They are delicious, and were fairly easy for a 9 year old to make. Thank you!

This recipe was ok.  It was short on spices, so I doubled them and they were a bit dry to work with, but tasted ok when they were done.  Not my favorite gingerbread recipe.

Pretty good for 1st time gingerbread with a few tweaks in the recipe. I used 2cups all purpose and 1 c whole wheat. And instead of molasses I used 1/2c organic maple syrup and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg. Everything else I followed. Pic coming soon. Beacuse of no molasses they weren't as dark brown but my nephew and niece enjoyed them just as much and had fun decorating them. * Icing just powdered sugar and a few tsp of milk. For the white icing. For the red, instead of regular food dye I used Grenadine for the red icing it gives the icing a bright red color and a mild fruity flavor.  Happy Holdidays !! Next time I will try recipe as written but very good!

I love this recipe though if you are not planning on adding frosting (for those who do not want any) I would suggest adding more cinnamon and more ginger.

These cookies turned out really good. We used multi grain flour and we ended up having to add more flour and then put the dough in the fridge for another 4 hours.

So over all, they tasted really good when they were done, but if you use multi grain flour... use a little bit more then what the recipe calls for.

Tried this for the first time and it was delicious.  My husband who HATES ginger anything didnt mind them either.  I left out the nutmeg because I dont like nutmeg, and they still turned out really tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this recipe! We liked the milder flavor than we usually make and with the size of cookie cutter we had, we made about 2 1/2-3 dozen. My oven tends to cook things faster than the recommended times, so 7 minutes was perfect.

I cook for some diabetics so I used Splenda brown sugar in this recipe. You are supposed to cut the splenda brown sugar in half for recipes that call for regular brown sugar but I used 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup and they came out great. I cooked them just about 8 minutes for chewy cookies and they were a big hit. They aren't the spicy gingerbread cookies though.

So good and they stayed little men when baked! Followed recipe exactly and they turned out great, the dough was a little wet when I went to roll it but just threw down some powdered sugar/ flour mix.

Great recipe, I made 5 batches for a friend to decorate.  They were sturdy enough to decorate and soft to eat.  The last batches I only chilled for 2 hours and they were perfect.

This dough turned out perfect.  Once I got all ingredients together, I worried for a minute because the dough seemed a bit dry/crumbly.  I just worked it a few seconds with my hands and the flour finished absorbing and it was great!  Did cut outs (rolled thicker than recipe suggests to get a thick, soft cookie) then rolled some in balls, then in sugar and baked into soft "ginger snaps".   Next time I might add a bit more ginger as I personally like a good zing to these cookies!

I always have trouble with gingerbread men, but I love them so I was  pleased when these turned out perfectly!  Mine may have been slightly thicker than 1/4", and I baked them for 10 minutes.  They were just right - soft and chewy. This will be my go to recipe and I expect to have gret success with gingerbread from now on!

Great recipe!  Ran out of molasses and used honey for the rest.  Worked Fine.  We also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white.  There were no complaints. :)

I love this recipe! Best gingerbread recipe I have found yet!
Created this minues the molasses and nutmeg, used demerara sugar instead of brown and didn't do the 4 hour refridgeration wait - but they still came out wonderfully! I would recommend an extra five minutes in the oven, just to make sure they bake through properly.

Fabulous recipe!
