My husband really enjoyed this.  I used a really lean ground beef and also added a clove of minced garlic, served with mashed potatoes...it's very comforting!

yummy, easy comfort food.  I made mine even easier when I found pre-formed turkey burger patties on sale.  The pre-formed patties, one can of soup,  a bit of water, a can of mushrooms, and a splash of worcestershire and dinner was ready in less than 20 minutes.  (I served with rice and steamed veggies)

A very nice and easy patty. I simmered it for an extra 10 minutes and served it over whole wheat pasta. I will definitely be adding it to my recipe box. Thanks for the recipe.

DH & I were both sick and wanted something comforting, yet not too troublesome to make.  I didn't add to the meat, simply browning up well seasoned burgers, then removed from pan, sauteed the onions and some mini-Bella mushrooms, added the soup, more water than called for, and the Worcestershire sauce and then returned meat to pan and simmered as directed.  Served with mashed potatoes and greenbeans and while not visually appealing, it certainly hit the spot.  Will likely make again.

Great recipe. My husband loved this. I only had Golden Mushroom soup so that is what I used. I substituted minced dried onion for the fresh (2 Tbl worth). This really needed a lot more gravy though and it barely covered the burger patties. I will definitely make this again with the Golden Mushroom soup and double the sauce part. I left out the extra mushrooms since the soup had plenty.

Great flavor! Suggestions: I doubled the Worcestershire, and added minced garlic.  I would remove the patties after step 2, then add them back to skillet after mixing everything together, then simmer.

Delicious comfort food! I am sensitive to gluten so had to make a few small changes. Used homemade soup from a recipe on this site and omitted the bread crumbs and Worcestershire sauce. I added garlic powder instead of onions (don't like them) and some pepper. I didn't need the water since my soup wasn't condensed. After cooking with the lid on, I cooked an additional 10 min with the lid off to thicken the soup sauce. Served over quinoa, tasted great! Next time will add more soup over top to make more sauce.

I liked this. I added extra water because the soup seemed too thick, once the mushrooms cooked down I had plenty of liquid. I would make this again, it's quick and easy.

This is good. I have been making a very similar dish for awhile. The only difference is that I don't add the worcestershire sauce or the water to the final sauce. It is good both ways. This version has a stronger tasting sauce because of the worcestershir, but they are both good.

Our burgers fell apart! I am thinking we used too many onions. It had great taste though. May try again sometime.
