My kids enjoyed it also. I used an air fryer to prepare the tots. I used ground turkey and low fat cheese. Turned out great!

Liked the concept. Did not know about those Veggie Tots so baked beef salsa and Cauliflower for 20 min @ 450 then followed the rest of the pattern. Great idea and my kids loved it

It was a big mushy mess for me even with pre-baking the tots. I think it could have some potential with some tweaks.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I changed the toppings when casserole was finished. I left out plain tomatoes and added shredded lettuce bacon bits sour cream and guacamole. Casserole is very filling and the tots flavor is definitely hidden. Used a recipe calculator to figure carbs and 1 serving is 24.9 carbs!
