This was so good! It's a super simple recipe that you can easily compromise with. We didn't had green onions and we didn't want sour cream or lettuce and they tasted delicious! Half of them we had pepper jack cheese and half we did without olives. This is something easily made on Sunday then you could take them to school the rest of the week. They are amazing!

Great little appetizer/snack. I made these for the kids as an after school snack, they loved them and they disappeared quick!

This easy recipe makes a delicious and attractive appetizer.  I would add a little salsa next time to enhance the flavor but was still good as is.  I made Chef Johnâ€™s flour tortilla recipe, cutting the tortillas into three inch rounds before cooking them for this recipe.  Worked out great.

As is, not a bad little appetizer. I think it would benefit from onion, guacamole and salsa.
