I was looking for a recipe which used cilantro.  This was delicious.  I did it set tomato sauce as I didn't have any chopped tomatoes.  I will make it again.

So incredibly satisfying! It might sound like a lot of cumin, but  the other ingredients mellow that assertive spice out. 

A quick and easy winner, winner chicken dinner!!
