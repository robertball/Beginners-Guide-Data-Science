This recipe was very yummy and super easy!  Only thing I would watch...which I caught on the first attempt at this...check the rice after a while in the oven and you might have to 'lift' with a fork or spoon to have the sauce get down to the rice/bottom of baking dish. Even my hubby and son loved the cooked onions since they get so soft and add great flavor to the whole casserole!

Loved it. I did some different things though. I added a red bell pepper for more color, plus the green bell pepper and instead of slicing it, I diced them into 1 inch pieces. I sauted them along with the onion rings, then using the same pan, seared each pork chop to hold in moisture. I added all the wet ingrediant's with eachother then poured over the rice. I then topped it with my sauted veggies, covered & cooked in the oven for 30 minutes before adding the pork chops. I left it uncovered & cooked for another 45 minutes. Turned out perfect and delicious. I will definately make this again.

I left out the green peppers and instead, added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Also used brown rice istead of white rice.  Was a bit soupy and had to bake about an hour and a half.  Would recommend cutting back the water and maybe not adding the porkchops until 30 minutes in so they don't overbake.

BOY HOWDY is this the WAY to bake porkchops baaby! My family absolutely flipped over the seasonings  of this yummy casserole. I did flip the chops over half way thru baking them. And you want to make sure and fork the rice a bit when doing so in order for the soup mix to get down in there real good. mmm'MMM GOOD!

My family did not care for this recipe.  The onion flavor was overpowering.  I would suggest the onion soup mix be cut in half.

I liked it, husband didn't, next time I will use less liquid, it turned out really wet and gloppy, later, it was like risotto, but I think with less liquid it would be better. I didn't put in the peppers and onion, but put in frozen green beans and carrots. I would try to sneak it into rotation again. The rice tasted really good.

I am not quite sure what happened here.  My rice took a lot longer then an hour to cook and when it did absorb all of the liquid, my chops were over done and the rice wasnt the texture I was hoping for.  It had a good flavor though.  Not sure if I will make this again

Very Easy to make yet the flavor was just not there. Also VERY ugly on the plate. (I added chopped green onions on top JUST so it would look better)The only one of my kids to eat this was my teenager but he will eat just about anything. My rice cooked perfectly as did my pork chops so no complaints there. I will use this basic idea again but revamp the ingredients for more taste.

Easy and pretty good. I did use chicken broth instead of water and I mixed the soups and broth and brought to a boil and poured over the rice. I cooked the rice 15 minutes then added the pork chops after stirring the rice. Baked for another 40 minutes and it turned out good.

The flavor is excellent, but due to my overcooking (husband wasn't ready to eat) the meat itself was tough.  I will try again with better cooking!

I personally omit the green peppers (as I can't have them) and dice 1/2 an onion and a couple shallots into the soup mixture.
It's an incredibly easy meal and takes next to no time to throw together.  
Perfect for those nights you have to work late.

I really wanted to like this...it smelled delicious. However, the taste was so-so and it was very soupy and mushy. Maybe just not to my liking.

Overall this recipe was fast, easy and with a few adjustments very tastey.  I used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom soup, and I used good seasons garlic and herb powder salad dressing instead of the onion soup mix. I mixed the rice, soup, water, a little pepper and 1/2 of the garlic and herb powder together.  Then I mixed the other 1/2 of the garlic and herb powder, a little salt and pepper and oregano together and set that aside.  I sprayed the baking dish with non-stick spray, poured in the liquid/rice mixture, coated the pork chops with the dry seasoning that I mixed together, then topped it all with french fried onions.  I cooked it for about 1 hr 15 min and boy was it good!

I made this because I could put it in the oven and pretty much let it go. Wonderful surprise! The rice is so good! I think that next time I will brown the pork chops...and as another reviewer said..you have to check it about halfway through and " lift " the rice. All in all... a great weeknight meal with little fuss.

WOW! I made my version a little fancier...I chopped mushrooms, red, green and orange peppers, 1/2 yellow onion, celery and a bit of garlc.  I used a pork roast instead and seasoned it, then seared it all over. Removed roast and chucked in veggies to sautee.  Then I mixed 2 cans of mushroom soup, 1 pgk of roasted garlic and onion soup mix, 1 cup of water and 1 cup of milk.  Poured it over roast, rice and veggies.  I cooked mine for an hour and a half, stirring every 20 minutes or so.  Absolutely AMAZING and easy!!

This was good. The rice needed longer to cook. I added a can of mushrooms with the juice and buttermilk instead of water. It was nice and creamy. Did not add the bell pepper.

Disappointing.  By the time liquid was absorbed the meat was way overdone.  Also somewhat of a bland flavor.  Wouldn't make again.

Easy and tasty.  I mix the rice right in with the soup and I always add a little cream cheese/sour cream or even mayo to add a little creaminess to the sauce.

This was a very good recipe. I did use a little less water and added a dash of red cooking wine to the soup. I also did what was suggested and added a layer of mushrooms with the onion and peppers. I also cooked it about 15 minutes longer just to have the rice a little more dry. It was quick, easy and delicious. I have leftover rice and will warm that up with chicken. Thanks for a great way to do pork chops.

I tried using brown rice in this recipe so I ended up having to cook way longer. I thought it was kind of a disaster but my family liked it a lot.

make.

It was good and easy to prepare. I used brown rice because we cannot have white.  Also I only had 1 can of mushroom soup and 1 can of golden mushroom soup so that is what I used. I did brown the chops before putting them in the pan because they were very thick.  The meat was very tender. I will probably make this again but it is not my first choice for pork chops.

I was uneasy about using uncooked rice, but it came out great! I can think of endless variations to this dish.

Delicious!!!! I whisked together the mushroom soup (1 can only), water (1 can) and soup mix and poured over the rice and chops. I left out the peppers but added 1/2 bag of frozen green peas to the rice. I put some of the thinly sliced the onion on top of chops. Can't wait to make this again.

After one hour in the oven the rice was totally uncooked as none of the soup mixture made it to the bottom. I had to remove the chops and stir everything, and put the chops back on top for another half hour.  The end result was a hideous gray lumpy mess and the chops were dry as heck.  The onion soup mix did not dissolve as expected either and those bites were hard to choke down.  The rest of it did have a nice flavor but due to it's ugliness who wanted to bother.  It was worth a shot but nobody liked it over here...

I am not an experienced cook, so I followed the recipe to a T. The boneless chops I used were wonderful, but the rice was soupy to the point of unusable. It did not absorb the liquid well.  liked it enough that I will try again and this time mix the rice and mushroom soup mixture together before baking, and probably stir it half way through.

I made this recipe twice, and both times the chops came out dry and tough.  The rice mixture is delicious.

I was cooking for one tonite (me!), had 2 boneless chops and wanted something quick, easy, and tasty!  This was it!  I didn't have any bell pepper and I thought the onion from the onion soup mix would be plenty, so I just used the rice, soup mix, and golden mushroom soup instead of the cream of mushroom, and it came out very good.  The chops didn't really absorb any of the onion flavor, so I cut one up small and mixed it with the rice and really enjoyed it. And I've got lunch for tomorrow. I'll make this again. Thanks!

I prepared the recipe as per instructions and the rice came out soupy and the onion soup mix too overpowering.  The pork chops came out tender.  I don't I will prepare it again.

This recipe was just great! This was a last minute dinner and I only had 1 can of soup on hand. So, I just used one can of soup plus 2 cans of water and it still came out really yummy. I will definitely make this again and next time I will try it with both cans of soup.

Flavour was great. Nice easy recipe that doesn't take long to prepare. After making it exactly as the recipe says, if I made it again I would cut the water down by 1/2 cup and brown the pork chops before adding to casserole.  Other than that it was great. I will try it again with the changes.

I made this on a last minute idea for dinner with what I had at home. I didn’t have any bell peppers so left those out. Also I added some seasoning (Don’s Specialty Meats) to my pork loins.  This came out really good. Easy throw together, bake and walk away. Will definitely make again!

Good basic recipe but  after reading reviews I made it with cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup. I also browned the pork chops first and chopped the onion and bellpepper and mixed it all together and laid pork chops on top and baked. I also seasoned the chops with salt and pepper and a little garlic powder.

I make something similar with chicken. The onion soup mix can be a little overwhelming salt flavor. My remedy is to cook some plain white rice on the side with green vegetable of choice, and add to the completed rice. I also add extra sauteed portobella mushrooms and onions.

I  made this recipie  following the instructions minus the onion and green pepper. The rice and pork chops were not fully  cooked after 1 hour at 350.  After another 30 mins at 375 they were done, but it was so watery it could have passed for soup.

After reading some of the other reviews i did alter the recipe a little... i didnt use an entire packet of onion soup mix more like 3/4 of it. I sprinkled the pork chops with onion soup mix and lightly seared them to keep them moist. i also added 1 cup milk, 1 cup water for a bit more creamy texture.( not 2 1/2 cups)  I added the pork chops after 30 mins, My rice took a little longer 1h 15 mins...  I now have mushroom/ Onion soup with rice and over cooked pork chops. Seems like i should have reduced the liquid even more... once the rice keeps absorbing its going to be super mushy.  The flavour seems to be pretty good... not sure if i will attempt this again.

After reading some other reviews I tweaked this just a bit. I added garlic to the rice/soup mix. I salted the pork chops on top before cooking. And in another small pot I cooked another 1/2 cup (dry measurement) of rice just in case. Sure enough, I did need the extra rice, but after stirring it in to the finished dish, the consistancy was perfect! Very good, and I'll certainly make this again!

I only used 2 cups of liquid, and instead of water I used chicken stock. I also changed 1 can of cream of celery in place of one the cans of cream of mushroom. And added chopped celery and diced onions to the rice mixture. I spiced my pork chops with garlic salt, salt, and pepper. And omitted the onion soup mix.

I think this recipe is better when boneless pork chops are used.  Otherwise, great alternative to chicken or beef.

Very good and tastey, but it came out very, very soupy and wet I had to cook much longer than the recipe said because I was trying to "dry it up" some, but it didn't and then the chops were just dry. I will try again with less water though beacuse we all still liked the taste of it.

My whole family loved this dish. It was so easy, that I was able to prepare before I went to night school and still made it to school on time.
