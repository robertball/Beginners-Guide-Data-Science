Easy enough for the grandkids to do as a surprise breakfast treat. We used home made strawberry jam in place of fresh strawberries. It worked well.

I made with whipped cream cheese. I put 2 TBSP on each croissant with half a strawberry. It was a delightful low calorie breakfast treat. It is only 154 calories each.
