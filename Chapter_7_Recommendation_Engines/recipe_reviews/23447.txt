This made a delicious and beautiful cake that pleased everyone who tried it!! It was fairly easy to roll, and I only ended up with one crack which I disguised by tucking under. There was extra filling left over, but it was tasty and I used it for something else, so no harm was done there!! 

The cake was moist and wonderful. I changed nothing in the recipe, and shall make it again!

This is very good, but I use baking mix instead of the flour, and sprinkle my towel with confectioners sugar before rolling.

This cake was fabulous!!  I served it at a birthday party for my friend along with cinnamon ice-cream and it was a HUGE hit!  Make sure to keep it stored in the refridgerator though.

To me presentation is everything and the photo of this pumpkin roll looks awful. The icing is suppose to be on the inside rolled up, not on the outside.
