Turned out like a dream. After reading some reviews concerning the oily quality of the cake I substituted 1 cup of the oil with apple sauce.  Still moist and yummy.  I also added a dash of pumpkin pie seasoning.  There's no need for frosting and/or ice cream.  It's heavenly just like it is.

Delicious and easy recipe. 1/2 the recipe makes a nice 9x9 cake, baked 30 min.  Increased the spices a bit and included 1 t pumpkin pie spice.

I've made this three times and everybody loves it!  I put a cream cheese icing on the last two times and it was a super hit.  I highly recommend this recipe for a fall or any season treat.

VERY tasty and moist cake. I put raisins and walnuts. My dude would have preferred it without the raisins. I thought they were great. I've chopped the raisins in the past for other recipes to take away the little pockets of raisin texture so I'll do that next time for this. I served it with fresh whipped cream and crystallized ginger. I have a feeling that this would make fabulous muffins. This has a very strong pumpkin flavor (which I lurve). If you don't love pumpkin then keep recipe searching.

One of many similar, but nonetheless good pumpkin cake/muffin/bread recipes from this site.  This variation appealed to me in that the spice was limited to just cinnamon, a welcome change from the usual additions of pumpkin pie spice, allspice, ginger, nutmeg and/or cloves. Other than baking these as cupcakes, about 22-23 minutes, I prepared the recipe as directed, using a 15-oz. can of pumpkin rather than measuring out 2 cups.  One recipe made 24 cupcakes.

Thanks for the recipe, it was quick,easy and delicious. Very moist, I'll definitely make it many more times over this fall season since my son had a good crop of pumpkins. It is the type of cake that goes good ANYTIME!

This is an awesome cake!  I made it gluten free with 1/2 rice flour and 1/2 Bob's Red Mill GF All Purpose Baking Flour and also low fat, with Egg Beaters.  I sprayed the bundt pan really well with Pam, then floured it with the mixture of gluten free flours I used in the cake and it just came right out of the pan.  It was very moist and the cinnamon gave it a subtle, but satisfying flavor.  Perfect with ice cream or whipped cream.

Delicious! I used one 15 oz can of pumpkin puree. This does indeed taste like pumpkin bread and I agree with other reviewers that this tastes great wtih cream cheese frosting. I originally made this to clean out my cupboard and use up the pumpkin, but will be sure to use this recipe every fall. Thanks!

This cake is excellent with added spice and even healthy substitutions.  Instead of all that oil, I used 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup light sour cream.  Instead of 2 cups of sugar, I used 1 cup of light brown sugar and 1 cup of splenda.  Instead of 3 cups of flour, I used 1 cup white flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup wheat germ.  I added a lot of pumpkin pie spice to taste and topped with a basic confectioner sugar glaze (conf sugar and milk).  Delicious!

YUM!  This is so tasty; not too sweet- perfect with a cup of tea.  I made a couple of minor changes:  I reduced the oil to 1 cup, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, and added 1 t nutmeg and 1 t ginger.  It came out of the pan perfectly and tastes great!  A keeper, for sure!  (my baking time was about 50 min.)

This was very good.  I used 1/2 c. of oil and 1 c. unsweetened applesauce, and I added about 3/4 c. dried cranberries.  I received lots of compliments on it.  Thanks for the idea!

This is a great cake.  I add Craisins and nutmeg.  Before the cake completely cools, I brush it with fresh orange juice and sprinkle with Turbinado sugar.

Try using 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup light sour cream, and 1/2 cup oil to replace the 1 1/2 cups oil.  A truly moist and tasty cake.  (I increased the spices as well - extra cinnamon, and nutmeg.)(And extra nuts, of course.)

This recipe is almost identical to one I make myself and is very good and never lasts long in our home. The key to keeping this cake from becoming hard and dry is to be sure to remove it from the oven as soon as its done. The brown sugar in it will burn and harden if left in too long. An excellent homemade icing for this cake is Cream Cheese Icing: 1 pkg. cream cheese (room temp), 1/2 stick unsalted butter (room temp) blended until smooth with a mixer. Add in confectioners sugar until you get your desired sweetness and texture. The easiest and best cream cheese icing I have ever tried. Excellent cake!

This was so easy and delicious! I usually fail miserably at homemade cake, but this came out BEAUTIFUL! And soooo yummy! I did subsitute 1 cup of applesauce for 1 cup of the oil. I drizzled it with cream cheese frosting and sprinkled on chopped pecans rather than baking in the walnuts. So delicious!

I only used 3/4 cup oil, and it was plenty.  2 tsps pumpkin pie spice, fresh pumpkin, and pecans instead of walnuts.   It didn't taste like pumpkin at all more like moist pecan cake.

If you LOVE PUMPKIN - you have to make this.  A delicious cake for Fall, but too delicious to only eat one season out of the year!  I made mine in a Bundt pan - it made a big cake, but didn't overflow the pan while baking.  Used 1/2 brown sugar - just personal preferance - and added a double dash of cloves. Since we also love cream cheese, I made a frosting that was more cheese taste than sugar (add less confectioner's sugar) and that brought together the pumpkin/cheese flavors perfectly.  A really good dessert for family dinner or to take to the office.  Works with the substitution of egg beaters/applesauce or add in of your choice - raisens/choc chips/toasted nuts.  Easy, versatile and DELICOUS - can't ask for more than that!Note:  You can make two bundt cakes out of this recipe unless you want one huge one.  If you divide it evenly between two pans you get two perfect bundts - one to take and one to leave at home :)

Delicious!  I omitted the nuts, halved the oil (ground up an apple instead), halved the sugar, halved the flour with whole wheat.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes in 8 x 8" pan.

Nice cake. I'm going to work on variations of this though. I replaced the oil with butter and used whole wheat flour instead. I might try to incorporate more eggs and sour cream the next time I make this. Also think it could be really interesting using Pumpkin Pie Spice.

I had 1 substitution: used 1 c unsweetened applesauce instead of 1 c of the oil. Also sprinkled in some nutmeg and cloves. This should have been called pumpkin bread instead of cake.  It is excellent, will probably use this again.

Simple and easy recipe, impressive results. I only made one alteration during baking: 1 cup oil, 1/c applesauce to replace the original amount of oil. After it cooled I drizzled it with a streusel type topping of melted butter, powdered sugar and cinnamon. I made this for a PTO event and 6 people asked for the recipe.

Very good basic recipe.  I changed a few things: reduced the oil to 3/4 cup, 3/4 cup sour cream, and I added 2 Tbs molasses, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp cloves.  Made the cake very moist and tall.  Very comforting and great for the holiday season, it disappeared fast!

I was excited to come across this recipe because it is one that I can make for my grandson, who has dairy allergies...and has just discovered that he likes all things "pumpkin" and "sweet potatoes".  I made this as written, but added a cup of Ghiradelli bittersweet chips to the batter before baking.  This is a very good cake that gets better as it sits.  Next time I make this I plan to add a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to add more depth.  (I would also like to try this with a cream cheese frosting when not making this for my grandson.)  Thank you, Jennifer, for sharing this recipe.  My grandson ate two huge pieces and took half the cake home with him (he is only six), and he seems to enjoy the fact that he gets something made "special" just for him; I enjoy...and appreciate...the fact that good cooks like yourself share your recipes so that I can make my grandson "special" dishes!

Followed the recipe exactly and got an amazing cake!  Not oily but moist and addictive.  Definitely cake texture.  It is, however, a LOT of batter and after filling my ring pan I also filled a 9X9 pan.  Don't see the need for any icing - it's great as it is.

This was a wonderfully easy recipe and very yummy.  I did change to half brown sugar and half regular sugar and also added nutmeg.  Frosted it with a cream cheese frosting and it was delicious.

It tasted just like pumpkin bread to me.  For some reason, I was expecting more of a "cake" texture.  I served it at Thanksgiving and no one liked it at all.

This was very tasty. I always try to cut out some or all of the oil/butter. I used half butter and half applesauce. I don't know if this is what made the cake really heavy or if it was something else. I followed the rest of this recipe to the letter. I made it yesterday and it is almost gone already so there is no complaints from my family!! Great seasonal taste. =)

I give it 4 stars because I think it needed a bit more than 10X (confectioners') sugar for frosting.  I made it in a bundt pan, using pecans instead of walnuts.  I drizzled a glaze over the cake made from 10X, maple syrup, maple extract and half and half to thin it.  I topped the glaze with more nuts.  My family said it was five stars with the added topping.  The cake itself is wonderful...moist and not too sweet, and it could not be easier.  I'll make it often.

While this turned out very pretty we all thought it rather bland tasting. I made this several days ago and had to toss the rest of the cake (over half) since it didn't get eaten, a rarity at this house. I left the nuts out, but that didn't affect the cake enough to alter my rating. Sorry this just didn't work for us.

I made a lot of changes and it turned out great. I substituted the oil for half crisco/butter and applesauce.
I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. 
I also added 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 of pumpkin pie spice. For some health benefits I added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and wheat germ.

Very good but I was expecting a little more. It is very moist but the center didn't cook all the way and the top was burning. May have been my oven. I would try it again.

This is an awesome recipe. I made a few changes. I added 4 tea of cinnamon, added 1/4 tea allspice, 1/2 tea ginger and cut out 1/2 cup oil.  I only have a 9" bundt pan so put the rest in a loaf pan.  Covered it all with powdered sugar icing.  Perfect way to use up some of my fresh pumpkin.

I made this in min tube pans so every body had a serving. O put a little whipped cream on top with a cherry. Was very pretty on the table.

I have made this twice.  The first time as is, for which I will rate it four stars.  The second time, I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. ginger, and that made it even better.  This is a moist, dense cake, best suited for a bundt pan.  Both times I frosted it with ermine frosting.

This recipe is exactly what I wanted. A moist, soft, pumpkin cake. Based on other reviews I added 2 tablespoons vanilla and pumkin pie spice II (1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves) and substituted half the flower for whole wheat flower. The flavor was perfect with the added spices. I topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting II (     2 (8 ounce) packages softened cream cheese, 1/2 cup softened butter, 2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract). I also added 2 teaspoons of nutmeg to the frosting. It came out so well that it will be a new holiday tradition.

I made this using  a single 29 oz can of Libby's pumpkin instead of 2 cups. I also split the batter and  made 2 cakes using 2 ten inch  round pans, about 2 in deep.  Other changes include adding 4 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, grape seed oil instead of vegetable oil (healthier), raw sugar instead of white and no nuts. I check them at 55 mins with a toothpick. These cakes are incredibly moist and need no icing or additional topping whatsoever and is dairy free.  EVERYBODY loves it and its not too spicy or overwhelming pumpkiny (if that's a word) and its really easy to make!!

A perfect pumpkin cake recipe! I followed this recipe, omitting the nuts and baking into cupcakes. The cupcakes were perfect and beautiful and tasty as they were, but I decorated them with a simple cream cheese frosting. I received a lot of great feedback from coworkers about how moist and yummy they were. I loved the true pumpkin flavor of these, with just a hint of cinnamon flavor coming through - not complicated with extra spices. A full batch easily made over 30 cupcakes.

I made this cake for my daughter's baby shower. Everyone loved it!! My 3 year old Grandson had 2 pieces! I also cut down on the oil by using half oil half applesauce and cut the sugar a bit too. Instead of icing the cake with  the traditional cream cheese, I iced it with whipped cream. Just like pumpkin pie! There wasn't any left!

I was disappointed with this recipe. The cake was definitely moist, but I feel it lacked flavor. I was expecting the cake to taste like pumpkin. It didn't. If I were to make this again, I would use much less oil and add some pumpkin pie spice, cloves, etc.

This turned out wonderful. I used a pumpkin shaped muffin pan and the mini pumpkin cakes were adorable as well as delicious. I did not add the nuts however and I used cream cheese frosting instead of powdered sugar. I served these at a party along with a pound cake recipe I found on here and everyone loved both. I will definitely be making this again.

This cake is amazing.  I make it and it gets better in the refrigerator as the week goes on.  It is a bit much so if you do not need a big cake might consider halving it.  Best of luck!

So moist and super delicious! Made the recipe exactly as is. An hour was a bit too long and it got a little crispy, but that didn't stop it from disappearing. Next time I will shorten the cooking time, but other than that I would not change a thing!

This is an excellent recipe for Autumn's bounty.  I made this for a Dessert Auction and it received much praise.  As a previous response mentioned I iced it with a cream cheese glaze and used brazil nuts rather than walnuts.  Wonderful!

I've tried this recipe last sunday. My family love it. I love it most because its the simplest recipe i've ever tried,its not sweet and i need not do any alteration what so ever. But i feel it would have tasted richer if i could use some topping or cream in between. Must try it.Thank u Jennifer.

I made a variation on this recipe as I was short on  pumpkin so I made a 2/3 's  sizerecipe and lined up peach slices on the top. . It came out very nicely.   As the top was juicier than the bottom, I put the pans in the upper rack in the oven.

Okay. I just mixed this cake up. I used Sweet Potatoes instead of pumpkin. And I didn't use nuts. I have a friend allergic to them and plus I don't like all that extra in cake. I also used 1 cup of canola oil and 1/2 cup of butter crisco shortening instead of 1 1/2 cups of oil. I also added 1 cup of sweet potatoes as a wet ingredient, because my sweet potatoes were a bit wet. And I added the last cup at the end. Funny thing is the Sweet Potatoes were actually left over from a crock pot thingy. It has 
 the skin still on. We'll see what happens. FYI - this makes a lot of batter.

Made this for my husbands birthday and he loved it.  Added a box of instant pumpkin spice pudding and reduced the sugar.  Glazed with cinnamon glaze.

This was a wonderfully moist and delicious cake.  I used 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices and it was perfect. Also glazed it using a brown butter glaze from another Allrecipes recipe. Absolutely delicious.

I did as suggested by others, and substituted 1 cup applesauce for 1 cup of the oil. I've made it twice now, and it's easy and terrific. We like it warm, and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Awesome!!

I loved it! It came out perfect. The taste was moist and pumpkiny. I think this is one of the best pumpkin cakes I have ever had. It is so easy and it comes out perfect. I wanted seconds and more seconds. This is a very good cozy halloween or fall dessert. This will make your guests want more helpings. I absolutely LOVED this cake. Thank you allrecipes.

I made this, using only about 1/2C of coconut oil, 1/4C of applesauce, & added some ginger & allspice! Mmmm, very tasty! A lot less guilt!

Made it twice in 24 hours, because the first one I wasn't satisfied with.  It was done much faster than anticipated and when I checked it after 50 min it was already too brown, yet a tad gooey inside in places.   I baked mine in a nonstick bundt pan, so maybe it cooks faster in a dark pan.  Also, I thought it didn't have enough flavor.  So this is what I changed on my second attempt, which turned out terrific:  I added 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, replaced the walnuts with mini chocolate chips (mix this in by hand), baked at 350 for 55 min.  Also, grease the pan, but only a very light dusting of flour or it will be ugly with flour still stuck to it.  Mine came out easily after cooling for 10 min and running a knife along the edges first.

A+. I only thing I did differently was 1C oil 1/2C apple butter. And since I only had 1 can pumpkin (1 1/2c) I added 1/2C buttermilk.

I've made this cake several time with no problems.  I didn't have an oily issue. This last time I did use just 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I replaced 1 tsp. of cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice. Next time I think I'll replace it all. I wouldn't mind it having a little more spice.

I made this and it was perfect! Moist but not crumbly, great for eating with fingers at a party. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon.

This cake got raves and requests for more from family and friends. I made a few changes as suggested: 1 C brown sugar and 1 C white; 1/2 C oil, 1/2 C applesauce, 1/2 C plain kefir; 3 eggs and 2 egg whites (because I had them); 2 C white and 1 C whole wheat pastry flour; and I used a bit more than 2 C pumpkin. This will be on our Thanksgiving menu from now on!

The cake was very good but it was very oily.  I want to make a way to make it into a butter mixture then I think it would be great.

Super easy recipe, with a great taste. I didn't bake it in a tube pan, I used a regular cake pan. It also took a bit longer to cook. It turned out very moist, and nobody could guess it was made out of pumpkin!

This was DEEElicious!It was a BIG hit for a fall gathering I had. I cut the oil to 1 cup, added raisins, 1 t nutmeg, 1 t ground clove. I cooked it in a bunt cake pan in the convection oven. It only took about 45 minutes to cook - it probably was ready in about 42 minutes. I glazed it with some melted vanilla frosting. My husband asked me to make about three more of them! :) Tasted even better the next morning for breakfast. I will be making this again really soon.

OMG! I made this for the office and everybody said it was the best pumpkin cake they'd ever had. I did the half oil switch for applesauce and added some nutmeg and allspice (1/2 tsp?). I will be holding onto this recipe forever.

I made this gluten free... and forgot to put the nuts in.. so I added them to the top.. so moist and so good.. not one crumb went to waste.  A keeper! oh and we did use half applesauce for the oil.
