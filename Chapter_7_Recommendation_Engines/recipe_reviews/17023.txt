I've made this chili recipe at least 5 times and it just gets better and better. I always add extra cayenne pepper and cinammon to give it additional flavor, and I add a small can of corn. Mixing both black and white beans is a good touch too. And don't forget to reduce the amount of chicken broth to your desired thickness!

I only used 1/2 of the cinnamon called for and am glad; I think using the full amount would have been too much, but with half of it, it created a really nice complex flavor with the cumin and the green chiles. Also, I drained and rinsed the beans, I always do this because it helps reduce some of the sodium in canned beans and it gets rid of that yucky starchy gooey liquid. Even without the bean liquid, I still only used 3 cups of stock and that was plenty. I did mash one can of beans with a fork instead of pureeing it, and I only added about 1/2 cup of cheese to the soup. I didn't think it was necessary to put 2 cups of cheese in it and add all that fat; I left the rest of the cheese out for us to add a little to each of our bowls. My husband ate three bowls of this the first night, so it is definitely a keeper, and I didn't think I would like white chili. what a great surprise!

Definitely the best recipe I've found for white chili. I substituted diced chicken pieces for the ground turkey; added more beans; & since i didn't have green chilies, substituted Pepper Jack cheese for the Monterey jack & added a little  Chipotle Chili Pepper for some zing. It's the combination of seasonings that make this dish so awesome. If you're tempted to leave out the cinnamon...DON'T! Threw some corn starch in to thicken, simmered for about 30 min.& served with rice,sour cream, extra cheese & corn chips. Thanks Donna

This recipe makes excellent white chili when slightly modified.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out way too soupy with too much of a cinammon taste.  I reduced the broth to 3 cups and the cinammon to a half teaspoon, per other reviews, and it was AWESOME!  I took it to a chili potluck and got several compliments.

I liked the different use of beans in this chili, instead of simply subsituting ground turykey for ground beef. I doubled the garlic, cumin and oregano, cut the chicken broth to 2 cups (I didn't want soup), omitted the jack cheese (I didn't have any) and simmered on the stove for hours to let the flavors blend.  Served with mini corn bread muffins.  When trying new recipes, I usually ask my husband:  'is this a make-agin?'  The answer was 'yes'

This was outstanding.  I did make some changes. I used crushed red pepper (all I had), I omitted the cinnamon and green chilies (I do not like the taste) and instead of the white beans I used mild chili beans.  I also took other advice and only used about 1 15oz. can of chicken broth. That was the real clincher on the taste. It was wonderful.  I would definetly make it again and again.  Even my 2 year old ate it and wanted more.

My husband liked the flavor of this better than regular chili.  To be honest, I was skeptical of the cinnamon, put it in anyway and didn't tell my husband.  I used diced chicken breasts instead of the ground turkey because that is what i had on hand.  it has really good flavor.  I just wish that it was thicker like regular chili instead of like a bean soup.  *7/03, made this again and subbed 3/4 cup uncooked rice for the beans and the liquid the same.  Not chili anymore, but a really great spicy chicken and rice soup.

I made this weeks ago and feel I've done a great disservice by not praising it immediately! I truly loved it both times I made it. I went w/ advice from others to cut down on the broth and only used 2 cups. It was soo cold out, so I made cornbread with it for a perfect meal.

I followed it almost exactly. Ingredient-wise, it's great. However, the submitter seems to have not included the fact that you need to let all the chicken broth reduce down. The reviewers who say it's soupy obviously didn't do this. Once you add the whole beans and broth, let it simmer for 30-40 minutes in the large pot. About mid way through this, add the ground white beans. Don't add the cheese until the last 10 or so minutes. You'll have a thick delicious chili.

This is an awesome recipe.  I omitted the cinnamon and added a half pack of taco seasoning.  It came out great.  Definitely a keeper.

1 word: awesome! This chili has a very different taste, but it is simply excellent. My boyfriend was so surprised when I told him the magic ingredient to the different flavor was cinnamon. I did have to use great northern beans because, well, I live in the middle of nowhere and no stores around here have cannellini/white kidney beans that I can find. I used 4 cups of broth, which was fine for us, but I suppose cutting it down wouldn't be a bad thing. Also, I did this in my slow cooker so dinner would be ready when we got home tonight. Here's what I did: browned my turkey with garlic salt and cumin, added the green chilis and spices and let them simmer while I put all the beans plus 1 can of whole kernel corn in the slow cooker. Then I threw the meat mixture in and let it cook on low for 5 hours. Served it with sour cream and shredded monterey jack. SO GOOD! Thank you for a great chili for this chilly night!

varied the recipe quite a bit where it was no longer "white" (added red wine in place of one cup of chicken stock, ground chili in place of chile peppers, some tomatoes, curry, brown sugar, corn and substituted black beans in place of cannellini beans) but it still came out really well. the brown sugar was only added because i put too much chili - sweet to counteract the hot. the cinnamon is a lovely accent and you absolutely cannot forget the monterey jack cheese. wonderful blend of flavours. it did initially look watery, but i let it simmer for a good 30-45 mins longer than requested.

This is my family's FAVORITE recipe of life.  It is such good comfort food and it smells amazing while you are making it.  I make this about once a week by popular demand.  Do not use 5 cups chicken broth; 3 cups is as much as you will need for a good consistency.  I suggest that you sautee everything in a large skillet and then transfer to the pot when you need to add the chicken broth and beans, since it seems to sautee everything a lot quicker.  I serve it with monterey jack cheese sprinkled on top, with avocado, and sour cream (and occasionally with warmed tortillas).  Try it with these toppings - it's magical and makes you happy to be home eating dinner :)

The first time I made this I followed this recipe exactly, except for draining liquid from the canned beans. The second time I added an extra can of beans, (red Kidney). I like the Chili/Soup consistancy, so I kept the same amount of broth.
This is a great Base recipe, and everyone can adjust the seasonings and/or ingredients to fit their indiviual taste. I will be having fun, cooking, and playing around with this recipe, for years to come.

Very delicious after I made a few tweaks! A new favorite. We used low-sodium chicken broth and 33% lower sodium white beans and were very pleased with the taste. We cut the amount of broth out by at least 1/3 - so our serving called for 6 cups and we put in 4. Glad we did that. Don't skip the herbs and spices -- they, along with the chili peppers, make up the taste of this dish but I only used 3/4 of what was called for in my cinnamon spice.  Glad I did that. We also added spicy turkey sausage and red and yellow onions to give it more flavor, plus one of the three cans of green chili peppers were hot and the other two were mild flavor. We also added 3/4 cup of sour cream in the last hour of cooking and don't forget the cheese! It really puts this dish over the top by adding extra creaminess and a little bit of saltiness. I used a hand blender to puree 1/3 of beans. Our serving called for 4 cans, so I pureed 1 and 1/2 cans and it help to thicken the broth. I slow cooked it for 4 hours and it came out AWESOME for our Superbowl party. Everyone loved it and I am going to keep this receipe. I served it with organic corn ships. Quick and easy and fairly healthy too! Great for a night during the week.  Thanks so much!

Fantastic!! Here were my modifications: I used 3 cups of cooked rotisserie chicken instead of turkey, 2 7 oz. cans of salsa verde, a little more cumin, 1.5 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of the full tsp (I was skeptical of the cinnamon - but it's a must-do!), and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. I used 1 can of cannellini and 1 can of great northern beans, and 1.5 oz chicken broth. I think the ratio of beans/broth/chicken was perfect this way. I bought chopped jalapeños instead of green chilis - so I used a couple teaspoons of the jalapeños. I let it simmer altogether for another 15 mins at the end. I used a potato masher to mash it all together for a few seconds instead of blending one of the cans of beans.  Did not need to add cheese. Great!!

Followed the recipe exactly and agree with other reviewers about there being too much cinnamon and broth. It turns out to be more like a soup. I would reduce the cinnamon amount by half atleast and reduce the broth amount down to 4 or even 3 cups. Otherwise, it tasted really good!

This was a pretty good recipe. Glad I only used half of the cinnamon. I also only used 3 cups of chicken broth. It would have been way too runny with 5!

I love this recipe.  It is so good and anyone I serve it to asks for the recipe.  My husband and I like really spicy so I up the Cayenne quite a bit and instead of green chiles I use jalapenos.  I also add a couple cloves of fresh garlic.  So good!  Enjoy!

This recipe was pretty good. I ended up cooking the ground turkey and then throwing it all into a crockpot on low for a few hours.

However, it was more like soup than chili, as it was very thin.

Yummy for sure. :-)

I made a few changes, a couple by choice, and another by necessity. 
I chose to use about 1/2 the cinnamon and I'm glad I did. It added flavor interest, without being overpowering.
I used less chicken stock...let your preference be your guide. Only YOU know how soupy you want your chili to be.
I also only used two cans of beans, because I only bought two, thinking that's what the recipe called for. Oooops. That worked out well, too. I think a 3rd can would have been too much. I used about 1/3 of a can of beans to puree.
I added the cheese to each serving as I reheated it, instead of stirring it into the whole pot.
Overall, this one's a keeper. Great flavor.

This had a good flavor, but the consistency was not chili. It was more of a very watery soup.

WOW!!!!!!!!!  Need I say more?  What a fabulous dish!  My husband and I made this yesterday while we were "iced" in for the day.  We did make two slight variations, though.  First, we used 2 lbs. of turkey, instead of the 1 1/2 that the recipe calls for.  We also added a little garlic salt, only because we used homemade chicken broth which is usually less "seasoned" than store bought.  This is my new favorite in the chili department!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and as another reader wrote, it came out way too soupy.  I actually drained a lot of liquid out after it was done. Next time I will reduce the amount of broth used, as well as less cinnamon (or none at all).

This is a great recipe but I rinsed the beans and used no sodium chicken broth. There is way too much sodium per serving. I added another onion and reduced the amount of chicken broth. This is a healthy chili so no cheese for us!

Very good.  I love the addition of the cinnamon in the chili, was unsure at first; but I really enjoyed it. It was a nice change from the usual.  I did add a 7 oz can of jalapeno sauce to the chili and it added a nice spiceness to it. Topped it with cilantro, cheese and some tortilla stips. Thanks for the great recipe!

I really enjoyed this chili, although will do it differently next time.   I made 2 smll changes to the original recipe.  I  put in 1 cup less chicken broth.  It was still the consistency of soup, which was not really what I was hoping for.  Next time, I will add at least 1 cup less broth.  I also added a can of black beans and omitted one can of canellini beans.  I drained and rinsed the beans first.  I served with black bean tortilla chips.  Delish!

This was really tasty, but I thought it was really watery.  I like my chili chunky and thick, and this was almost like chili soup!  I will make this again - its a great dish - but will reduce the amount of broth added.

This was just OK. I tried 'doctoring up' the leftovers the next day, and there was some improvement, but not enough to where I'd make it again. Sorry.

A great recipe that tastes even better with great northern beans which are glass packed, fully cooked and produced with just salt, sugar and water.  I find the "juice" adds to the flavor of the chili.  I also sprinkle scallions on top to give crunch and color.

This was good, but I'll use less broth next time, it was too watery for my taste. I subbed tomatoes for the peppers for my mom, but would like to try with the peppers sometimes. I liked it with some hot sauce added in too!

Amazing!!! The cinnamon gave a nice subtle flavor and the consistency was great. I used an extra can of pureed beans and 3 cups of water and it was perfect. Sprinkled a little cheese on each serving at the end instead of mixing it in, and garnished with a little lime wedge and some fresh cilantro. The leftovers were even better today with the chilly, rainy weather!

A good weekday recipe. Very quick. I don't have a food processor so I just added some thickener at the end. I also drained and rinsed the beans and drained the chilis.

I thought the cinnamon taste was a little strange. I think I'll leave it out or reduce the amount next time.

This was absolutely delicious - I followed the recipe to the "T" because I don't like to review a recipe and tweak it before giving a true rating.  I wish there had been leftovers because we all know that all homemade soups/chilis are better the next day!!  Will definately make this one again!  My tweak will be to cut back slightly on the cinnamon - just a preference.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Like others, I cut the broth down to 3 cups, but I kept everything else exactly the same. Overall I was pleased with the flavor - I love cinnamon in chili, so I didn't find that unusual - but I would probably leave the cheese out next time, and just sprinkle some on at the end in each bowl. I feel like the flavor and texture of the cheese gets lost when melted into the broth entirely - cheese is too good and too many calories to waste on thickening broth! Also, I did rinse the beans I added whole, but kept the liquid from the can in the ones I pureed, and it came out great.

This is one of the best white chili recipes we have had in a long time. I was also skeptical of the cinnamon so I went a little light on it but boy did it add a different dimension to the flavor!!  I used a blend of ground white and dark turkey meat and I think that tweaks up the flavor as well.  My husband said this is one of his favorite soup/chili recipes! And my teenagers liked it too!

I stuck to the recipe, though I tossed in some raisins in the last 10 minutes for a fun punch. Very interesting and nice taste - definitely different from a beef chili, but good different. :)

Quite delicious! A new favorite. We used fat free/low-sodium chicken broth and were very pleased with the taste. Don't skip the herbs and spices -- they, along with the chili peppers, make up the taste of this dish. Also, we added cheese to taste when served instead of dumping all the cheese into the pot at the end of cooking. But don't forget the cheese! It really puts this dish over the top by adding extra creaminess and a little bit of saltiness. If you don't want to dirty a blender of food processor, you can smash the 1/3 of beans with a potato masher, but don't skip that step either. The mashed/pureed beans help to thicken the broth. Quick and easy and fairly healthy too! Great for a night during the week.

Very good chili. I used kidney and black beans and for the pureed, black eyed peas, because that's what I had. I kept the cheese on the side and personally skipped it (I'm watching calories but the kids used it). Followed the recipe otherwise exactly, down to mixing chopped cilantro at the end - I'll definitely make this again.

Really, really good.  It was the kind of recipe the company wanted to have.  The cinnamon added something special; the spices were just right.  I didn't change anything and wouldn't next time, including the food processing of the 3rd can of beans.

I made this yesterday and it was wonderful! I stayed true to the recipe as far as
the ingredients, other than using a little less cheese and ground turkey, and 
thought that the consistency was fine. I did let the chili simmer longer before adding
the cheese. I will definitely make this again.

I finally made this chili after much contemplation and I'm glad I did. It is awesome. I did like other reviews stated and cut down the broth to about 2 1/2 cups and added more spices. I was pleasantly surprised at the taste of the cinnamon, it's a great flavor in the backdrop that leave people wondering "what is that"?

This was not good. I made exactly per recipe- maybe the cinnamon gave it a funny taste. Also texture was runny and meaty. Not at all appetizing.

Agree with others--5 cups Chicken Broth is too much. I used 2.5 Cups of broth.  Also, I used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon instead of 1 teaspoon.

It was delicious and we'll make more at our house!

This is wonderful. The only thing I did differently was to add some chopped roasted red pepper to onion and garlic. I sauteed these in olive oil until onion was soft and then added the turkey. The roasted red peppers added another layer of flavor and red color to the chili.

This had a great flavor, but was soupy.  I would use 3 cups of chicken broth next time instead of 5.  I simmered 45 more minutes just to get rid of excess liquid.
You could get away with other beans if you don't have cannellini beans on hand.  I used 1 can of navy, 1 can of white beans, and one can of black eyed peas because that's what I had on hand.  It was very good!

Great recipe!  I doubted I would like this better than my regular chili recipe, but I was wrong -- it was very tasty!  I made a few changes: added more garlic, cut the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, used 1 tsp cayenne (could have used more), and added a can of rinsed black beans (I love black beans, and it added a bit of color to the dish).  To cut the fat, I used low-fat mozzarella as a garnish instead of stirring 2 c of jack cheese into the dish.  My hubby and 12 year old son loved it!  Next time I will try making it in a slow cooker, and adding cilantro.

This chilli is delicious! I added about a half cup of heavy cream, but trust me, it was really good without it!

I subbed the cannellini beans for pinto because it's all I had and added some tomatoes. Still turned out pretty good. I was very cautious about the cinnamon, but it created a wonderful contrast with the cayenne.

Delicious! I only made the most minor of changes. Since I halved the recipe I won't deal with amounts, but I omitted the green chilies and added a bit more cayenne and paprika instead. Used half white and half black beans and ended up pureeing the portion of black beans. Obviously this made the final appearance much darker, but it still looked good. One reviewer suggested adding a bit of corn starch. I tried this since I may have added too much broth. It did the trick. I was so glad I had fresh, dried oregano on hand.

This was a great dish with a few changes :)
I did not use Cumin because i did not have any.
I used way less cinnamon because i was skeptical about putting cinnamon in my chili, but it did turn out good, can't imagine putting a tablespoon tho. I used 2 cups of beef broth because that is the only broth i had on hand (YOU DO NOT NEED MORE THEN 2CUPS OF LIQUID ) it came out perfect chilli consistency more then 2 cups would be like a watery soup. I did not use Cayenne peppers and only used 1 can of green chile peppers because i have small kids and can't do spicy, also i used cheddar cheese that is all i had on hand and black pepper, i also added salt to my turkey, onion & garlic mixture (salt is always a must) and i did add a little olive oil for the onions and the garlic to give it more flavor. Also i used way less cheese served extra on the side. (cuts fat in half) overall the chilli came out great we really enjoyed it my kids liked it as well too and they are only 15month old :)
thanks for the recipe. (i served it over rice)

Yum Yum Yum!  Forgot to get ground turkey so used some diced chicken thighs instead.  Also added a can of green chili enchilada sauce because I LOVE more of that green chili flavor. Other than that made it just as written.  Full of flavor, just the right consistency and goes great with cornbread!

Good, but I feel like it was missing something.. I think a healthy addition of diced fresh chili peppers would add some depth... I think using 99% lean ground turkey breast may have robbed it of some of the richness that I would have liked.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. The flavor was delicious, but the consistency was too thin/watery. I will definitely be making this again, but will drain the beans and decrease the amount of chicken broth. I liked that dinner was ready in less than an hour and I think a thicker consistency would bring the rating up to 5 stars. Thanks for sharing your recipe! It's a keeper!

Very spicy, which wasn't an issue for me, but my husband couldn't stand the heat, so next time I will use far less peppers then the recipe called for. I also followed another users advice and used less broth then the recipe called for and the texture came out perfect. I will definitely be making this recipe again in the near future!

Good stuff! I used 3 and 3/4 cups of homemade chicken broth.  I used one can of navy beans and one can of great northern beans WHOLE, then just used a potato masher on another can of the great northern beans.  I also added a can of corn.  I didn't use as much cheese as the recipe calls for and it was still great.  Everyone at the Super Bowl party loved it.

This perfectly hit the spot. I am a bean lover and, although I cut the recipe in half, I still used 3 cans of beans. I also substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and it came out great. Really satisfying, and full of flavor!

Unfortunately this did not turn out well for me. Maybe I did not puree enough beans. It looked watery and the white ground turkey meat did not look appetizing floating in it. My kids would not eat it. Actually, I wouldn't either, so it took a long time for me to feed it all to my husband. I should have gone out and gotten more beans to puree and add to it to see if it made the consistency better, but I gave up.

I was so tired of the tomato based chili & was looking for something new & came across this great recipe!! I couldn't seem to find any canned green chiles in the market so I just chopped up some green peppers to give it some color. Don't be scared of the cinnamon, it makes people wonder, hmm what is that. This recipe is even better the next day!

Pretty good, but I think it needs a little zing.  Maybe the juice of a lime would help give it a little more depth of flavor..

Good recipe.  The only thing I would change is to not use so much chicken broth.  It's more like a soup than a chili.   Next time I will definitely cut the broth back by 1 to 2 cups

I usually brown the turkey and then put all the ingredients in a crock pot on low for a few hours.  5 cups of chicken broth is way too much... I use more like 3.

Yummy!  To make it a little healthier, I deleted the cheese in the soup and opted to add as a garnish instead.  I also reduced the amount of broth to about 4c., rinsed my beans, and added about 3/4 of a can of corn (rinsed). Definitely season to taste.  I added some sea salt and extra cumin and white pepper. Served with corn muffins.

I've made this recipe twice now and it is very good. The only negative I can say is that I feel like I have to increase the amount of spices slightly to add more flavor. Also, as some others mentioned, I did decrease the amount of liquid to about 4 cups and wish I had decreased it a bit further but that is just personal preference.

My husband LOVES this chili with white beans.  The modifications I made are as follows:   1)  Brown the onion and garlic first in 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil.  2) Increase the amount of turkey to 2.5 pounds.  3) We like it spicy; so I use 1 tablespoon of the cayenne pepper and 1 tablespoon of the white pepper.  When I serve this to guests, I reduce the amount of both peppers to 1.5 or 2 teaspoons each.  4)  Like most who reviewed this recipe, I use two cups of chicken broth.  5) I use mashed beans instead of pureed.  6) I have yet to use cinnamon in this chili.  I follow the rest of the recipe as it is written, and it turns out great each time I make it.  Thank you so much!

Great recipe!  Part of my regular rotation. Here's my version:  First I substitute 2 poached chicken breasts (diced) which are added with the broth and simmered.  Eliminate the cinnamon.  We like a green chile flavor, so I add 3ea 4oz cans of chiles OR I process a can of drained tomatillos.  As far as spices, I double the cumin and add a tablespoon of poultry seasoning.  For the beans I use 1 can each of black and white beans, both drained & rinsed, THEN puree one full can of white beans with its juice in the processor. And finally I reduced the broth to 2 cups for a more chili-like thickness.  Any more is way too soupy.  YUM!

I added all the spices except for the cinnamon, and then tasted it, and it was very good.  Then I just added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and I wished I hadn't.  You don't taste a cinnamon flavor, but it made the chili taste too "earthy".   If you don't like earthy flavors, this recipe isn't for you.

This is one of the best white chilis I've had. I omitted the cheese because I don't really like cheese and added a dollop of sour cream to serve. Wonderful!

We love this twist on chili.  The only thing I change about this is cutting down on the chicken broth to 2 cups.  Otherwise, it's too soupy and not thick like I think chili should be.  Even the kids like this one and it's great topped with a dollop of sour cream!

Very simple and easy to make. I scaled the recipe to half to use up 3/4 lb ground turkey I had on hand. I drained the beans and pureed 1/3 of them with some of the chicken stock.  I think this key to getting a good smooth texture and not a watery soup.  I doubled the amount of garlic and used half the cinnamon.  I use Penzey's cinnamon, which tends to be stonger than others. I would not recommend leaving the cinnamon out altogether, as it adds an unexpected element that really makes the recipe stand out from the rest. I also used mexican oregano, which is a less sweet variety than the more familiar mediterranean commonly used in Italian cooking.  I like that this recipe is prepared with just a few ingredients and and is ready in minutes.  Will definitely make again.

Holy cats, this is awesome, and my husband (a meat-and-potatoes guy at heart) raved!  Loved the cinnamon-- I recommend leaving it in for sure.  I doubled the garlic, chilis and spices, used extra lean turkey tenderloin, and 2 oz of fat free cream cheese instead of the 2 cups of jack cheese, and used 2 c cannellini beans and 1 c black beans.  At the last minute, stirred in 1/2 c scallions, 1/8 c fresh lime juice, and 1/2 c chopped fresh cilantro. Served it with corn bread and scarfed it down!  Yielded an 8-serving recipe with 262 cal, 28 g protein, 32 g carbs, 3.25 g fat (0.15 g saturated) per serving.

It's pretty good, I think it needs less cinnamon and something to thicken it up a little.  It's more like soup than chili.

Stopped on the way home and picked up the ingredients.  Whipped it up in a little less than an hour.  Take a chance and add the cinnamon-you will not be disappointed.  Used 4 cups of broth-and added frozen corn and celery.  Very tasty and a nice change of pace from 'traditional' red chili!  Plenty of leftovers for freezing and lunch tomorrow.  Thanks.

I followed other reviewers advice and reduced the broth to 3 cups. We like our chili spicy, so I added a little more cayenne pepper and a few dashes of tabasco. I served it over rice with some extra cheese and tortilla chips. Delicious!

This was the most awful recipe! I tried it twice and still have no idea why you need to add 5 cups of chicken broth at the end.  It should be called turkey chili soup!!!

Sorry.

This recipe is not only  easy but so delicious! I have made this several times now, slightly changing the recipe each time, and regardless of the changes it always comes out amazing!  The cinnamon adds such a great flavor that keeps people guessing, and last time I put 2 Tsp instead of 1 which came out great.  I never have green chilis so I just use red pepper flakes and like it.  Also, I've used chili beans or navy beans because that's what I had on hand, and while I like cannelini the best, it still came out great.  Like others have said, it can come out a bit too soupy, so I've just let the broth simmer down or used less!  Definitely a recipe we will use again and again!

This is a keeper! I didn't add the cumin or cayenne pepper because I didn't have either. Also i used mozzerella cheese instead. I added chili powder and red pepper flakes for lots of spice. My husband and I loved it. The flavor was perfect. Thank you for sharing.

I've made "white chili" before using chicken, but never turkey.  I'm not sure why I've never done it before, because it was delicious! The ground turkey is just the right meatiness to make it be a true chili.  Every time I use chicken, it just feels like soup to me.  I also was a little skeptical about the cinnamon.  I don't care for it in my normal red chili, but to give the recipe a fair chance, I used it.  And I'm glad I did.  All the spices really complemented each other to give this chili and nice, robust flavor.  The whole family enjoyed this and I will definitely put this in the winter rotation!

I had really high hopes for this but I thought the cumin and/or cinnamon were way too overpowering.  I think this would be better with some slicked mushrooms in it but I probably won't make it again to find out.  Don't take my word for it though - a lot of people think it's great.

This was very good. Made a few modifications based on previous reviews. I agree with others that to add all 5 cups of broth would make it too runny. I used 4 cups, or one box. I also reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon. I wasn't sure how much "to taste" means for the cayenne pepper and white pepper so I used a 1/2 teaspoon of each. Maybe I should have added a bit more because it needed a little more kick. Solved that though by adding a 1/2 teaspoon of habenero hot sauce that I happened to have on hand. And my small town grocery store did not carry cannellini beans or shredded montery jack (only) cheese. I subbed great northern beans and a montery jack/colby cheese blend & they worked just fine.

Love the ingredients in this recipe, however, I just joined weight watchers and have been figuring out points and cannot find anywhere on here how much is considered and actually serving.  I know that this serves 8, but does anyone know the exact measurement of each serving?

Wow! This is absolutely wonderfully! I never would have thought adding cinnamon but it's what makes this dish and no it's not sweet but adds just the right amount of flavor! We eat ours over rice or I add about 1-2 cups of coked rice to the pot once finished making! Delicious, my husband asks for it all the time!  Thanks Donna for a great recipe!

Delicious!  My boyfried is not a ground turkey fan but he loved it!  I agree that only a half teaspoon on the cinnamin and added corn to it.  It's my new favorite dish and super easy to make.

This is an all time favorite in our house. However I do cut back the broth to two cans total. I now keep all the canned ingedients readily available in case the craving arises.  my two kids and husband are big fans of this recipe.

TOO MUCH CINNAMON.  I thought this recipe was bland and had too much of a cinnamon flavor.  I would leave it out or just put half.

This is a great alternative to standard chili which I do not care for. I only had 2 cups of cheese so a added 1 1/2 cups to the pot and saved a half cup for topping. It worked great. I also only had a Mexican blend cheese and it worked great.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  I thought it was lacking something that I couldn't quite figure out, but the rest of the family really liked it.  We served with homemade tortilla chips and extra cheese.  Not sure if I'll make it again - definitely needs a tweak or two.

I'd seriously consider adding sauted onion and garlic and you can also substitute cheap pork meat. Otherwise, reads Yumm-O!

The first time I made this it was for a friend that had a new baby and thought it would freeze well. They loved it so much I made it for my family. We loved it. It's different but very tasty. I took others recommendations and added a can of corn and reduced the amount of cinnamon to 1/2t.

I made this recipe exactly as it said to. The flavor was great, the consistency was not. It was VERY soupy. In the future I would only add 2 cups of chicken broth and I would save the cheese as an optional topping rather than putting it in the pot. I think with some changes to make it thicker and creamier this recipe will be worthy of a 5 star rating.

Great Recipe! The only change I would make is: use northern beans.  I used 1-T. for the white pepper and ceyenne pepper and it was VERY spicy (even for me).  I would recommend 1-t. instead.

I made this as a healthier alternative to the chili my husband makes and he didn't like it.  I really liked it but even halving the cinnamon, I still felt like it was too much.  Next time, I will try halving it again.  I liked the idea of cinnamon but it was just too overwhelming.  Really good flavors though.  Love this recipe!

The whole family loved this chili!  I doubled it due to the size of my family and there was only one small bowl leftover (which I hid for myself).  I was afraid of the cinnamon but added it anyway and I am so glad I did!  Great flavor and thank you for sharing!!

Very bland. Needs seasoning and less cinnamon. The ground turkey tastes great though. The broth tastes like green chiles. Said less or no cinnamon because it created a very unappetizing stench.

Made a vegetarian version with a chicken substitute.
I followed recipe exactly. It was awesome! The only thing I would change is less stock to thicken it up.
One more thing, THE CINNAMON makes the dish do not omit.

I cut back on the chicken broth...only added about 3 cups.  I also added a little more cumin, garlic salt and salt.  I pureed the one can of beans undrained but drained the other 2 cans.  Definitely think it would have been soupy with the 5 cups of broth.

We really enjoyed this but I doctored it up quite a bit. I doubled the garlic, halved the cinnamon, added a few extra shakes of all the other spices, cut the broth down to 3 cups, added a half cup of salsa, some shredded carrots and mushrooms, and used 1.25 lbs turkey with a half pound of italian sausage. I let it simmer, covered, for a long time - about 2 hours. Just put a handful of cheese in the chili, and used the rest as garnish. Like I said, we loved it the way we had it but when I first tasted it, before I added all the other stuff, it was pretty bland. Maybe it just needed to simmer, but in any event I will make this again with the changes listed.

I made this according to the recipe - tasted it, and this was so watery, more of a soup then a chili.  I also did not care for the flavor, too much cumin - that seemed like an overpowering ingredient.  I didn't want to trash this - so here is what I did to make this not only edible, but delicious.  My kids were saying that it tasted exactly like 'Wendy's' Chili after I fixed it.  I browned the turkey and was left with big chunks - I decided to blend it in a food processor to make the pieces uniform/smaller.  I browned my onions/garlic alone.  I through all of this into a crockpot, and added the other ingredients.  I also think you should cut back on the chicken broth (use only 4 cups).  I used two cannellini beans and one dark kidney beans (rinse many times and drain first).  I added two bottles of Chili Sauce (I think they were roughly 15 oz. each, can't recall just bought them at Walmart).  I also added 2 T. Chili powder.  With these changes it came out really good.  I am giving this one star for the original recipe (my version 4 star).

I thought I'd give this recipe a shot, and it's not bad by any stretch, but I personally prefer a spicier, tomato-based chili.  The cinnamon adds a nice touch, but I probably would have added some chili powder to the mix.  I substituted some beer for the chicken broth, and that gave it a boost, but I think I'll stick with a more traditional chili recipe in the future.

excellent recipe!  I like other reviewers, added extra cayenne, cumin and cinnamon to liven up the blandness of the turkey, and I added some gumbo file powder after cooking (one tablespoon) to dial up the thickness.  it isn't a "thick" chili but I actually like it this way.  a household fave!  thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic soup! I followed other suggestions and doubled the spices (cumin, cinnamon, cayenne), added a can of corn (no sugar/no salt), and half of the cheese. Also, couldn't find ground turkey so used ground chicken instead. Loved it.

Loved it!  I put half a cup of rice into the broth.  I used a 7 oz can of Salsa Verde instead of the chiles.  Because the salsa added it's own seasoning, I reduced the spices a bit.  1 tsp cumin, 1tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp Cinnamon, dash of white pepper, dash of paprika,  One can only of cannellini beans, plus one can of cream of chicken soup, AND to boost the nutritional value I added one can of diced tomatos.   Caution: This was plenty salty, so if you could use unsalted soup or beans or tomatos, it would be good.

I love this chili I make this at least once a month it's my daughters favorite.  The only thing I can say is when you process the beans add a little of the stock it will help get the beans nice and smooth so you dont get a grainy texture.

This is my 2nd review. I have made this so many times now.. Still 5 stars. Although, I don't use all 5 cups of broth. I like it a little thicker, more substance. Cinnamon is really a taste thing. It's good with it and without it. I don't think it's the show stopper. But it's OK with it in. Excellent. Part of my rotation of meals.

Fabulous chili was made after reading the reviews. I'll give it four stars because I think without my changes it would be four stars, but it's delicious after the changes I made... I used 4 cups of chicken broth, added a diced jalapeno, and used PLENTY of cayenne. I used about a cup of mozzarella instead of the jack, as well. Then I simmered the final pot with a can of garbanzos and corn, plus a hefty sprinkling of chili powder, for about an hour to reduce the liquid. I like my chili chunky, and this one is! Perfectly spicy for my taste. This may be my new signature chili dish! I don't know, you might be able to do without the cheese.

We all had seconds.  Because I didn't want to go to the store, I made this with what I had on hand:  2 cans (rinsed) black beans, 2 cups frozen corn kernels, and 32 oz. low sodium chicken broth.  Instead of adding the cheese to the pot, I served it on the side along with strained plain yogurt (instead of sour cream).  Don't be afraid of the cinnamon.  We didn't find it an identifiable flavor.

I used leftover turkey burgers (recipe from this site in place of the fresh ground turkey.  This gave it a TON of FLAVOR!!  I skipped the cayenne, only used 1/2 of the green chilis recommended.  I also eliminated 1 can of beans (personal preference). I have made many different white chili recipes with ground beef and I have to say this turkey recipe was even BETTER in my opinion.  The combination of herbs and cinnamon really made a difference in this recipe.  This is a 5 star keeper!!

This is delicious!  The only changes I made was leaving out the cinnamon (but will try it in the future) and using my own, dry pinto beans instead of canned beans.  I made this all in my crock pot and it was a huge hit with my family.

Being a born and raised Ohioan who loves cincinnati chili I love the cinnamon- how brilliant to add it to a white chili. I would say that if the idea of cinnamon turns you off, look for another recipe. But if you like cincinnati chili and want to try something new look no further! This is the perfect cold weather meal with sour cream, extra cheese and crushed tortilla chips on top, what else could you need?

This is awsome! Some people cut down broth, some added corn,chipotle seasoning or extra hot stuff. I change this up all the time. I added BLACK WILD RICE to it which gives it a unique flavor. It also has a nice contrast against all the white ingredients. You must try this. A slow cooker also works but best to brown the turkey, onion and garlic first.

I enjoyed this dish very much. The cinnamon really did make it! I would give it a 5 star for inspiration, but I can't for food because I changed several things. I cut the broth by two cups, used a can of pinto, a can of black, and a can of cannellini beans, simmered the broth and spices (added fresh cilantro) for half hour or so before adding turkey, onions, and garlic. I topped my bowl of chili with shredded cheese and squeezed fresh lime juice in it. Served with tortilla chips. Yummy!

Very good with a few changes. I doubled the spices and eliminated half of the broth. If you don't eliminate the broth it is just like soup. It's a nice flavor - different from regular chili. We enjoyed it.

This was good, but not very spicy. If I made it again I would at leat double the chiles. Also, it was pretty loose. I would recommend adding less liquid, or letting it cook down for quite a bit longer than recommended in the recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe and it deserves 5 stars!  The only alterations I did was:  I used 1 can of green chiles (but next time I'll use two), red pepper instead of cayenne, 2 Cannellini beans and 1 Red Kidney & 1 15oz can Chick Stock.  TREMENDOUS!  I have an 18 yr. old (very picky) and she LOVED this meal.  I served this meal with the Mexican Cornbread I (also from this site), which was very good, but to moist for my liking.  So next time, I'll alter that recipe, but for the White Chili . . . . . Very, very good!!!!!

One of our all time favorites!  My only suggestions are to leave out the cinnamon, add frozen corn, and since we're big fans of everything spicy, I swap the monterey jack cheese for habanero cheddar.  Top it off with a dollop of low-fat sour cream - spicy & delicious!

This was GREAT and so easy to make.  I used 4 cans of chicken broth so make it less soupy.  I also used whatever cheese I had in the house, which ended up being 1 cup mozzarella and 1 cup cheddar.  Still mighty good!!  Thanks for sharing!

I did not process any of the beans and did not add the cheese until time to eat the chili, but this was a great tasting way to use ground turkey!  Will definitely make this frequently.

We really like this recipe. I took some suggestions from other reviews and then changed it up. I drained and rinsed the beans using a smasher instead of using the blender. Instead of ground turkey I used ground chicken and dried minced garlic. Since I used 2lbs of chicken I used 4 cans of beans and 6 cups of clear chicken broth. My son used crackers and I used tortilla strips.

Tasty Mexican flavor, but not spicy. We followed recipe exact (except forgot to add cinnamon--I meant to try to add a little at a time to see if I liked the result, but forgot altogether). Anyway, it was very good. Both my 7 and 4 year old ate it up! It was pretty filling already, but next time I will add some corn and some mushrooms to it to make it even chunkier and make it go a little further--we love having leftovers since we are so busy.

Very good flavor.  Was a little too soupy.  I will just add 4 cups (1 box) of broth next time.  Otherwise loved it!  Doesn't look as good as it tastes.

DELISH! A new favorite regular item for the dinner menu. I didn't put as much liquid as the recipe called for, as per other reviews, and I'm glad. It would have been soup, not chili. I also only used half of the cinnamon, for our family preferences. The rest of the recipe was followed to a T. VERY good!

I made this for our annual Chili Cook-Off and folks really liked it. (I didn't win because folks tended to go for the more traditional red sauce, but everyone that ate it, loved it! Not a drop left!)

My variations were to brown the onion, garlic and turkey and then put into a slow cooker and combine the remaining ingredients except the cheese. 

I reduced the cinnamon in half and cranked up the heat with a full tablespoon of cayenne and chili powder, plus a finely chopped jalapeño pepper. 

I slow cooked it on low for 4 hours and then let it simmer for another 2 hours. 30 minutes before serving I mixed 2 teaspoons of cornstarch with the juice from the chili and added it to the chili to thicken it up. I then added the cheese so it melted through, which gave it a nice consistency.

Finally, I served it with more shredded cheese, sour cream and chopped cilantro. Yummy!

Wow, we absolutely loved this chili. I used less of the spices than called for, I thought 1 tablespoon of cumin was too strong so only used 1 tsp,  and I only put in 1/2 tsp of cinnamon because I like spices to be subtle, not overpowering; to each their own.  For us the result was perfect.  I did not put the cheese in the soup because it sticks to everything, rather we put grated cheese and sour cream on top in the bowl.  Absolutely fabulous. I'm making this again for super bowl on Sunday!

I totally agree with the previous reviewer.  I only gave it 3 stars because the flavor was so good--I wanted to give it 1 star because I was so disappointed that the end result was not a chili but a SOUP.  Way too much broth.....!!  I ended up throwing another can of beans in and mixed 3 T. flour in to thicken it somewhat, but I was fighting a losing battle.  There was just too much liquid ~ I would've had to add about a cup of flour or cornstarch, and I didn't want to do that.  I will make it again, but I'll cut the broth in half.

DO NOT USE 5 CANS OF BROTH. I made it for the first time and that is way too much broth. Reduce it to 1 or 2 cans, depending on how thick you like it. Other than that, the flavors are amazing.

This is amazing!  I added an extra can of beans, a bit less broth and hot sauce instead of cayenne pepper.  We also kept the cheese on the side and added it to each bowl per each persons taste.  We absolutely loved it!!

best explosions of flavors I have eaten in a while! I didn't use as much cumin or oregano and cutout the cheese both for lactose and carb cuts. It was great with northern beans as well

This was much better than I expected it to be!  I replaced one can of chili peppers with one can of jalapenos, which made it a little TOO hot, but still very good!   I added a can of black beans.  It looked a little strange with the black and white beans, but both my husband and I thought it was delicious.  I'll definitely make it again.

After following the recipe, the result was a bland soup.  I added taco seasoning, jalapenos and cooked pasta and still thought it was disappointing.  I learned that I prefer using shredded chicken in white chili.  Ground turkey in a pale broth looks pretty unappetizing.

I followed this exactly and I really liked it...BUT it does it really has a heavy cinnamon taste.  It reminds me of the flavor of Skyline Chili (if you're familiar with the Cincinnati chili).  While I kind of liked it, the rest in my family thought it was "weird".  Next time I'll probably follow what others suggested in the review and decrease the cinnamon by at least half.

I made this with an extra can of beans and half the green chillies.   It had just the right amount of 'bite' without being overwhelming. Everyone is on a diet in our house so I omitted the cheese and let people put what they wanted on top, for a lighter version. I would imagine this is very low calorie.  It was EXTREMELY easy, quick and hearty.  My family loved it!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  I made a few minor changes like more garlic, small amount of nutmeg and cut back just a bit on the cinnamon because of the nutmeg.  If you use good cinnamon, like Saigon, it doesn't come across as a cinnamon taste.  It's more like a background taste.  I also made it a little hotter with pepper flakes.  Thanks again!

This is way too watery to be called chili.  With 5 cups of broth this becomes a soup and is very unappetizing to look at.  Very dissapointed in this recipe!!

First time I made it, while cooking the turkey I added salt and pepper to the Turkey.  DO NOT add salt until you have tastged it.  I followed recipe 2nd time and no salt is needed between the cans of beans and broth.  Made for a pot luck and everyone loved it!  and you can control how spicy it can be!

This was good, however, way too much chicken broth. And I would leave out the cheese all together. Otherwise, the flavor is great. I like another readers idea of adding corn, and I think it would be good with celery too. I would make this again with some modifications!

Yummy recipe and a great alternative to the usual chili. I added more seasonings to my taste, including a dash of nutmeg. I also added a half a chopped green onion, sauteed. Delish, thanks!

very good chili. The one thing I did differently is I used presoaked beans and cooked them with all the ingredients together until the beans were soft. The Chili was not runny at all like some reviewers stated. It had enough spices and I thought the cinnamon gave it an interesting flavor. will make again

I followed this recipe for my first attempt at making white chili, and it turned out very yummy! I was very surprised how well the cinnamon complimented the flavors. Definitely will be making this again. :)

Loved it! Fast & simple, very tasty. I added diced corn tortillas during the last step & the juice of two limes. Delicious and not too heavy! Served topped with a dollup of sour cream.

This is very close to one of my own fav chili recipes.  I'd leave out the cinnamon and cayenne; add some tomatillos, and you've got a marvelous and healthy chili.

This was good with the alterations I made. Ground chicken, about 2 1/2 c broth, 1/2 T spices, only 1 can white beans, cheddar jack cheese since that's what I had on hand, a little cream and a little asiago cheese. Very delicious! Added just a sprinkle of cinnamon since I wasn't too sure if we would like it. we liked it alot!

I did half of the cinnamon, as did many reviewers.  It was a great, and different flavor than many other chilis.  Nice to have something new, easy and not too spicy for the kids.  I also only used about 1-2 Cups of chicken broth, didn't think it needed as much as it called for, and I cooked my own beans beforehand.

White Chili w/ Ground Turkey Haiku: "I thought this was good. (My dinner guests, not so much.) The cinnamon failed." Only changes that I made were using 1 Cannellini, 1 Great Northern, and 1 hominy, and reducing the broth and cinnamon. Even 1/2 tsp. cinnamon came through very strongly and the folks who I served this too weren't subtle about making their opinion about it known. I thought it was unusual, and all the better w/ a sprinkle of cheese, tortilla chips, and Sriracha sauce, but I can't rate it any higher due to me being the only one who finished her bowl.

Better than I expected.  It does need extra seasoning, so season to your own personal taste.

So quick and delicious.  The seasoning is perfect, but  I add only 3 cups or less chicken stock, 1 can black beans, w/o the liquid, 1 can navy beans (or cannellini) and 1/2 can cannellini beans, mashing the other half,  1 ear fresh corn, and put the cheese on top, afterwards.  I always get tons of compliments on it. Yum!

A noble start, I think.  I had to make a few changes to enhance the flavor...
- sautéed one fresh jalapeño with the onion/garlic (perhaps two would be ideal?)
- added one can corn
- instead of the third puréed bean can, I threw in some cilantro jalapeño hummus (who wants  to get out the food processor? Not me!)
- Included more garlic,as usual
The chili had a nice "spiced" flavor but not the bold, upfront heat I like.
Bottom line:
Turned out pretty tasty but I'm not obsessed.

Made this for daughter's potluck and I must say, it was the only dish that was not finished.  Made as is and the cinnamon seems to over power the dish...not really what you would expect from white chili.  It aslo seemed to lack any kind of a kick to it and seemed really bland.  We will not be making this recipe again.

This was good.  The recipe didn't say whether or not to rinse/drain the beans, so I rinsed/drained the first two cans and then put  the contents of the 3rd can in the blender.  I thought five cups of chicken broth would have been too much, so I just used one 14.5 ounce can.  As the other reviewers said, I only used 1/2 t of cinnamon.  I'll make this again.

Great recipe! I have adapted it to our tastes over the years with chili powder and a can of diced tomatoes but I realize that basically changes the recipe.  I say this because it is a great recipe that can take some creativity and or changes not because it's not already good but because we like it another way.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fantastic recipe.  I only made minor adjustments and only because I enjoy my chili more creamy.  I put 4 cups of soup and a scoop of plain yogurt in.  Also because we had no Monterey Jack we used a garlic cheese from the local farmers market and some pepper jack.  Then eaten with a crusty bread and oh man!

YUM, yum, yum!!!  I did everything as directed, except I only put in one cup of cheese (I accidentally bought a bag of Swiss thinking it was Monteray Jack).  Also, I wasn't sure if I was to drain the beans or not - it seems like you always have to drain beans - so I did.  It turned out AWESOME!!!

It was really good.  I didn't use canned beans.  I also cooked it all day in a crockpot.

I find the pictures are so honest and you can see what people did differently (the wrong color of beans, and how the food really looked!). My chili is still in the final 10 minute simmer (although I was too lazy to blend the last can of beans, and am not adding the cheese until it's in the bowl so I don't have to scrub it from the pot).

This was so good! My husband thought it was unique and really flavorful. I used ground chicken (it's all I could find at the store). I scaled the recipe to 6 servings. I halved the cinnamon amount, and it was the perfect amount. I ended up using 2 cups of chicken broth, and thickened it up with corn starch, and it worked out great...not soupy at all. I used 2 cans of beans, and did not mash any, just didn't fee like it at the time :). And, I had no Monterey Jack cheese, so I just used parmesan instead, but only sprinkled it on the chili and mixed, it definitely was not 2 cups. Overall, excellent recipe and I recommend it.

This recipe is awesome!  Don't be afraid of the cinnamon - it makes it wonderful.  Some reviewers mentioned it was a bit juicy so I added some brown rice and let it simmer.  Really good!  Also I used hot turkey sausage so I didn't need to add cayenne.  I also added a small amount of chopped celery and carrot when I sauted the onion and garlic.  This is a wonderful recipe.

I loved this recipe! I was unsure about the combination of spices, however, it was great! I cut back the cinnamon a bit but only because that is a personal taste. I also only used 4 cups of broth to make it a bit thicker. Great recipe!

I made this recipe minus the green chile peppers and white pepper.  Maybe it was my first time using cumin...but I did not like this recipe!  I thought it was very bland.  I didn't want to throw away the entire pot of chili, so I added a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of yellow corn.  That made it more tolerable but still not good.  HOWEVER, I saved one bowl to try the next day...and it was actually better the next day.  Not something I would make again though.  I added sour cream and cheese to my bowl of chili when ready to eat.

Made this with leftover Thanksgiving roast turkey breast, cubed. Substituted a seeded and chopped jalapeño for 1 can of green chiles. Was skeptical about the lack of salt, but it wasn't needed. Yum!

I made this dish last night, and wow was it TASTY!!  Instead of serving it with tortillas (which is a good idea), I served it over rice.  To thicken it the chili, I added more cheese (maybe a cup more), and or course only used about 2 1/2 cups of broth instead of 5 cups.  HINT: I didn't add cooked rice to the chili because I knew it would of soaked up all the broth.  What a great meal to serve on a cold night!

This was a great change from a regular beef chili.  It was very easy to make and I enjoyed the unique flavour of the cinnamon in it.  The only thing I didn't enjoy about it was how it looked.  Honestly, it looked pretty unappetizing.

This was good!  Like others, I lessened the amount of broth to three cups.  That made the perfect consistency.  I also had ground chicken to use up and so I used that instead of turkey.  I agree that the seasonings need to be increased.  I made it as is and then added more seasoning and chili powder to it.  The cinnamon was a fine addition!  Husband raved and raved about it!  Will make again when I'm in the mood for something different.

I usually follow the recipe exactly the first time I make anything but I did cut the chiles & cayenne since I was serving this to my small children.  It was amazing!  The flavor was fantastic and the cinnamon, although unusual, was an outstanding addition to this great recipe.  It was a little on the soupy side as opposed to stew.  Next time I think I will add kale to the recipe.  It reminded me of Olive Garden's Tuscan soup and I think the kale instead of the spicier ingredients will be good for my family.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Excellent. I made this for me & my son last night and it was really delicious. I used to make something similar but lost that recipe so I tried this one. It's a little different with the seasoning but we really liked it. I halved the recipe though, but followed the directions otherwise. I thought I had 2 cans of the cannellini beans but I only had one and one pinto beans so I just used those too.  It was a little brothy but we were more interested in the flavor - might try thickening it up next time though (next time DH is away that is, he won't eat beans!)

Today was cold and snowy so I baked bread and made this recipe.  Because I was missing some ingredients, I substituted hot salsa for the chili peppers and omitted the cheese; also did not puree any beans.  Using all the broth made it more like soup but we loved it that way.  We will definitely enjoy this again!

i loved this. i think the combination of the cinnamon and cumin are what make the flavor. the adjustments i made are as follows (i know everyone gets worked up about reviewing a recipe after you modified it but here i go): 1. i sauteed the onions and garlic and in a tablespoon of bacon fat since i had some on hand. after 2 mins of cooking on their own, i added the turkey. 2. i halved the cinnamon and cheese. 3. i only used 2 cups of chicken broth. 4. i didn't mash any of the beans - next time i would puree, i think it would make the consistency a little thicker. this was delicious - make it, you won't be sorry. mmm!

I used four mexican cheeses instead of the monterey and it works great! I also use Navy beans along with Canneli beans. They are somewhat interchangable.

Very nice.  I really couldn't taste the cinnamon but I could smell it and I really like the aroma of cinnamon from chili!  Never knew that about myself!  I did only a bit of cayenne, and I used only one 16 oz container of chicken broth (which I think translates to 2 cups) and I was happy with the spices and the ratio of liquid to beans and meat.  I like a thicker chili, so I wouldn't have been as happy with 5 cups of broth.  I mashed the last can of beans with a potato masher bc I just wanted mashed pieces and did not want them pureed.  It turned out great--I really like the flavors in this chili!  I put it in the crock pot on low all day, so it gave the flavors a lot of time to meld.  I served in bread bowls, and while the bread bowls I chose weren't a hit, this chili was.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome. The first time, I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I altered it a bit, adding an adobo chipotle pepper (instead of diced green peppers), a can of black beans (I only had 2 cans of white and smooshed up one of the white). Also, I like my chili a little thicker, so I added a touch of corn starch, threw in some rice and frozen corn and voila! It was delicious!

We all loved this recipe!!! The cinnamon and cumin together are awesome.  I changed it a bit by adding less chicken soup and adding WAY more cumin...a few table spoons more. Also added more cayenne pepper and some tabasco for kick.

I love white chili and was looking for a healthy ground turkey recipe and found this one.  After reading the other reviews I halved the cinnamon but wish I wouldn't have added it at all.   It seemed like it overpowered the taste of the chili. I also added a a few tbs. of taco seasoning which is something my other white chili recipe had in it.  Great recipe but next time I will leave out the cinnamon!

This recipe has a unique flavor and tasted good. I made a few changes. I could not find canned chili peppers at the grocery store so I used 5 fresh serrano chili peppers. I used 3 to saute with the turkey mixture. The other 2 were pureed with the cannellini beans in the blender. That made it pretty spicy but the cinnamon and cumin still could be tasted. I also used about 3.5 cups of broth based on some of the previous reviews. If needed I will add more broth when I reheat. I have a feeling this might be better tomorrow after sitting for a bit. If I make this again, I may puree more of the beans.

This is one of my most favorite recipes. My mouth waters thinking about it. Don't be put off by it's looks, I do admit it doesn't look all that appetizing. By the way, to me, the cinnamon makes the dish, so I don't suggest omitting it. Give this one a try!

This is one of my favorite recipes! I always substitute for one can of well-drained black beans for visual interest. I also add 3 or 4 chopped up canned Embasa Chipotle peppers instead of green- this gives it a smoky flavor that is unbeatable. The other can't miss step is to add freshly chopped cilantro to the top.

I love this recipe.  It's sooo fast and easy!  I used half the amount of the turkey.  I also used two cans of the white beans, and one can of the pinto beans.  I used half the amount of cinnamon, and added a bit of chili flakes to it as well.  YUMMO!

Husband said and I quote "This is the best chili you've ever made!" which is something coming from him as he's not one to rave over food.  I subbed ground chicken for the turkey, great northern beans for the cannellini and only put in a dash of cinnamon and cayenne.  Also only used 2.5 cups of broth (2 cans) which was perfect for us, but very thick the next day.  Will probably make again.

Wonderful flavor and even better served over basmati rice.  I didn't have canned chilis so I substituted in pepper jack cheese. Next time I will cut the broth so it's less soupy.  Definitely a keeper!

This was very good. I used shredded chicken breasts (3 small) in place of the ground turkey and I used about 4 cups of the chicken broth. The cosistency seemed just right. Not too soupy and not too thick. I thought the cinnamon would be overpowering so I started with just 1/2 tsp but ended up adding a bit more. You can adjust to your liking.MMM, good.  Thanks

We all really enjoyed this chili. Thanks to everyone who wrote about reducing the amount of chicken broth! It would have been soup using 5 C. as written. I ended up using 2 C. Also I threw in an additional can of black beans (rinsed and drained) and used the entire 1 t. of cinnamon. It's amazing how you can't taste it specifically, but I thought it really added to the overall depth of flavor. Thanks for a new family favorite!

I have alway love chili. I tried this and my boyfriend love it!! The only change i did was adding bit of lemon juice. When we had those leftover. I would pour the leftover white chili in sauce pan and add bit of cornstarch in to thicken up, make the burrtio with chicken rice flavor/ yellow n green bell pepper mixed in. then pour the white chili leftover over it, sprinkle with  cheese. Its really good!! Will plan to use it again in the future

I've made this chili twice now and it's so good I could eat it for breakfast or as a midnight snack!!!  I cook it over the weekend, then portion it into ziploc containers and freeze for my lunches for the week.  I don't make any changes to the recipe--it's PERFECT "as is".

Great balance of spices. I made this without the cheese to keep the calories in check- was still delicious. Served with a bit of thick yogurt and a dash of green Tobasco.

We used black and kidney beans(all we had on hand) and increased the cayenne.  Although we cut back on the cinnamon it was still a little too noticeable for my taste, however we did crock pot it which seemed to intensify the cinnamon taste the longer it sat.

This was super!  Very different, but super.  I kept to the recipe, mostly.  I love cinnamon so I doubled that, and I added an extra teaspoon of cumin.  The green chilies were hot instead of mild, and I used 4 cups of the broth instead of 5.  I let it simmer for 2 hours and then served it on top of crushed tortilla chips, added extra cheese and a dollop of sour cream on top.  It was even seasonal because of the cinnamon, SO GOOD!!!  I will definitely make this again!

Try with more turkey.  Consider cubed ham or chicken.  Experiment with black beans.  Green chiles were good, try jalapenos.  Don't add more cinnamon.

i had to add salt to this, my mom & i loved it, but our "steak & potatoes" hubbies were not so fond.  they didn't like the "herby" taste, so next time i am going to cut down a little on the oregano & cumin, but mostly on the cinnamon - it didn't add the WoW factor i thought it would.  overall, pretty good but needs some personal tweaking.

My husband is allergic to tomatoes, so I am always looking for old favorites that have been remade WITH OUT tomatoes.  Since there are only two of us, I changed the conversion to four (so we can have leftovers) and swapped out a couple of things that I didn't have.  I used Great Northern Beans and Italian seasoning instead of oregano.  Because people raved about the cinnamon, I put in about 1/2 tsp.  It does add something to the flavor and I would do it again.  I was also out of cumin and I used 2 tsp of chili powder.  As soon as my water boils, I will serve it over macaroni!  Happy eating!

This is excellent!  I used maybe a cup of broth because I prefer a thicker chili.  I added a Knorr's chicken bullion.  I doubled the cumin because I love that spice. I also only did 1/2 tsp of cinnamon which was perfect.  The flavor that it gives is great.  Of course I added more garlic..5 large cloves.  Did not have cayenne on hand so used red pepper flakes.  I left out the cheese, I did not think it needed the extra fat and with less broth it was already nice and thick. I served with a dollop of low fat sour cream, more figure friendly that way and a great taste too.  I really love this chili.   I also love the idea of mashing the one can of the beans.  Makes it even thicker...like I like it.  Dont use all the broth or you will be making a soup..not that the flavor will be off...but if you want a nice thick yummy chili recipe...this is it.  Another update> I made this again and used Ground Turkey breast...I cooked it up with a little olive oil with the onions and garlic. However, just not as flavorful as with ground turkey...the ground turkey breast is a little too dry and flavorless.  I thought maybe you would not notice with all hte yummy flavors going on, but I did.

I've been making white chili for years & most people I know aren't sure what it even is. I made this as is except for a couple of changes I *always* make (e.g. I hate pieces of cooked onion in stuff, so use either onion powder or liquify the onions in a blender), and I used the full amount of cinnamon *and* broth.  I admit to a leariness of the cinnamon as I'm not fond of Cincinati chili, but I really didn't notice it.  I also think mashing those beans helps with the liquidy problem.  (I mashed them w/a fork as my blender is still in the bottom of a box from a recent move.)  I guess I didn't care if it was more liquidy.  I was a bit liberal with the white pepper.  It wasn't as spicy as I would normally like, but there was some other flavor that made it really good.  (I think more likely the Jack cheese than the cinnamon.)  Cannellini beans can be found in most bigger stores, usually with the Italian stuff.  Northern/navy are probably a better substitute than red kidney cause they're more mild like cannellini beans, and still white. :-)  I think I'd like adding some sour cream but didn't have any.  The appearance didn't bother me at all.  But I really loved this, 5 cups of broth and all.

This was good but very different for me.  I cut the cinnamon down to 1/2 tsp and it was still all I could smell and tasted very strong.  That didn't bother me, but some people may not enjoy that as much.  To cut the calories a little I drained and rinsed the beans and only used 1 cup of cheese.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth and my husband still thought it was too runny for chili, so I may cut that back next time.

Delicious! I used 3 cups turkey broth from Thanksgiving instead of the chicken broth, reduced the cheese to 1.5 cups to save a little fat and calories, halved the cinnamon, and doubled the garlic. Even with reducing the broth to 3 cups it was still a little thin. I simmered it down a bit more. I think an extra can of beans with the extra simmer time would make it perfect. As it is, we still really really enjoyed this recipe. A winner.

I loved this! It is by far a favorite of mine now. I only added 3cups of stock and 1/4tsp of cinnamon. I loved the cinnamon in it though and don't think it would be as good without it. Great with tortilla chips on the side.

It wasn't so great, so I remembered that others had added taco seasoning.  I added Lawry's Chicken Taco seasoning packet.  Then it was really good.  It's five stars with the taco mix added.  So I leave out all of the other seasonings. With the exception of the cayenne, for the heat. I don't use the chili's either.  I use one or two cans of chicken broth.  It is a bit runny but very good.  I use Northern White beans.  Can't find the other kind.  My mom said that it's the best food I've ever made.

This was okay. I scaled the recipe to 5.2 servings to have one pound of turkey and two cans of beans. My supermarket didn’t have cannellini beans so I used great northern, which worked well. I didn’t puree any of the beans. I thought the spices were overpowering and would recommend using half the amounts. This white version is good for those who don’t like tomato bases such as those used for traditional chili. I probably won’t make this again.

This was very tasty!  I substituted great northern for the cannellini beans, and served it over basmati rice - mmmmm.  We all liked it, but the only negative is that the color is not the most appetizing color - kinda greenish gray.  I will make it again though!

WOW!  Used advice of previous reviewers and only added enough chicken broth to get "chili" consistency.  Also added a little more garlic than called for and cilantro and a little lime juice.  I left in the cinnamon and I thought it gave a wonderful depth of flavor.  This one is definately going into my book!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Even loved it down here in Texas!

This was very good!  I also made some substitutions just to fit what was in my pantry without having to go to the store.  I used dried onion flakes in place of fresh.  I did not have the green chiles so had to omit.  I would add them next time to give it an added kick.  Ours was good, but definitely needed something else to add a little spice.  The only white beans I had were 1 can of Great Northern and 1 can of Navy.  I blended the Great Northern and put the Navy in whole.  Based on other reviews I only added 1 can of chicken broth.  I like a thicker chili.  I did not have Monterey Jack cheese, so added a combintion of cheddar and mozarella (mostly cheddar).  

The test question for my husband is always "can I make this again?"  He gave it a "yes", but only if I omit the cinnamon next time.  I wouldn't tell him what was in it until after he tried it.  He couldn't tell what it was exactly, but said there was something sweet in it he didn't like.  So, next time, no cinnamon for us.  The biggest surprise was that my 2 year old ate it!  His staple is chicken strips/nuggets and mac and cheese.  If he doesn't like the way something looks or doesn't recognize it, he won't even try it.  After protesting a few minutes at this new food on his plate he finally tried a bite when he thought no one was watching, and before we knew it ate the whole plate.  I just used a slotted spoon to make him a plate of all the "chunky" parts of the soup.

Had a good flavor except next time I would decrease the amount of broth and the cinnamon.  It was a little soupy.  Would make again with changes.

Very Yummy! I used only two 14 oz cans chicken broth, and it was still liquidy, but I liked it.  I only used 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and it was just right, subtle, (couldn't imagine using more) I forgot the cayenne, but it was still a little too spicy for my 3 year old, but my nine year old liked it. I will make again!

I just made this and my first tase is wow!... I can't wait till the hubby comes home to try it. I may add a little roux to thicken it a little but it is wonderful right now. I can't wait to make a salad  and dig in with some fresh french bread.

I will definitely make this again.  I needed a gluten free, dairy free option for dinner and this worked perfectly.  The people who like dairy can add cheese at the end.  I did cut the cinnamon and I used much less of the chicken broth.  Vey good!

I made this several years ago and forgot about it. It is still as delicious as it was the last time. I make it exactly as stated with one change, I only put in 32 oz of chicken STOCK.  I also allow the liquid to softly boil down a bit (a good half hour) before adding the can of beans that have been through the food processor which gives it the perfect consistency, not too much liquid! Excellent recipe.

I HATE beans and this might still be one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  I reduced the beans to one can pureed and one can straight into the chili.  I also added a diced orange pepper to the mix because I had it on hand.  I also didn't mix the cheese into the chili, instead I served it on top.  I made it the day before I served it which really let the flavors meld and made it soooo much better than when I tasted it right after I made it.  I served it with sour cream, green onion, and raw jalapenos in addition to grated cheese on top.  It was absolutely fantastic!

I suppose I should give this 4 stars since I made a change, but really it's personal preference, so I'll keep it at 5. I've made this recipe at least 7 or 8 times now. The one change I always make is reducing the chicken broth by half, or until its the desired consistency. Other than that, the first time I made this recipe as written. It was delicious. Since then, I've substituted chopped chicken for the turkey, used pinto and/or kidney beans instead of the cannelli beans, used different kinds of cheese, or used cans if jalapeño peppers instead of green chillies- whatever ingredients I have on hand. My favorite cheat is to use a can of refried beans instead of processing my own can of cannelli beans. The seasonings are delicious, and I never feel the need to tweak them. Love this recipe!

So different, but a GOOD different! Variations: added 2 cans of cream of corn, used 1 can of light red kidney beans instead of one of the cannellini cans, added celery and a can of drained crushed tomatoes. The cinnamon was not over-whelming at all! It was delicious!!

This recipe was simple to make.My expectations were high, It just didn't deliver. It was very bland and no matter what I tried to do to adjust the seasonings just didn't help it, Not going to make it again.

This is a great after Thanksgiving chili.  I used chopped roasted turkey instead of ground and Serrano peppers for a bit more spice.

We loved this and will make it again.  Savory with just the right amount of spices.  We didn't tweak it at all.  And my husband's crew has won the Chili Cook-off in the Atlanta Metro area several times.

I have made this chili MANY times and even pinned it. It's very adaptable to adding/substituting different ingredients. Just when I think I have all the ingredients necessary I will find I have used all my cans of green chili's....  I subbed a package of Frontera green taco sauce and it was great. I also wouldn't hesitate to use green chili salsa.  Adding ground chipotle is wonderful if you like smoky heat. I have a problem with cooks who praise a recipe and then change every ingredient but this one deserves 5 stars because it's good prepared as is (w/less chicken stock!) but can be jazzed up for individual tastes.  Have fun when you cook!

We just had this for dinner. I used a mix of cannellini, northern and black beans. We also used ground chicken. It was very tasty, but we would all definitely prefer shredded chicken. May use this recipe again for Thanksgiving leftovers.

There are no leftovers! I didn't even get very much, the boys loved it so much!!  I served it with some brown rice.  So yummy and very healthy!
Will definitely make some again, just so I can have more!  Being a Cincinnati girl, I liked the cinnamon, but you really don't even notice it.

Crucial to read the reviews first. I can't imagine this with 5 cups of broth. I only added 2, and it was delicious. It definitely needed salt and more pepper, but this was very good and very easy. I only used half the cheese as well.  The cinnamon adds a different taste, but it was good!

This was delicious.  I reduced the amount of chicken broth to make it thicker - probably used2-3 cups.  I omitted the cheese and served it with grated pepper jack, cilantro and green onions as garnish. I also added some white corn which added a nice crunch.

Made this tonight!  Wish I had scrolled down to read the reviews, as 5 cups of chicken broth was too much.  I wound up adding a cup of white rice and a can of black beans to help absorb some of the broth.  Delicious!  This recipe is really easy to make and very tasty.  I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the excessive chicken broth (made it too soupy).

My pot of this chili is done so I had to try it and review it before we eat it for dinner! Delicious! I added a less broth, as most reviewers suggested.  The seasonings are great - even the cinnamon.  I can't wait for dinner when we top this with more cheese and sour cream for hubby.  I have a loaf of parmesan/cheddar beer bread that will go great with this. Perfect meal for a chilly Fall day!

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I added Chicken Broth until I got the desired consistency, just a little bit "soupy."  Then, when I added the cheese at the end to simmer, it made the broth creamy and wonderful.  You have to add the cheese!  And use just as much broth as you like.  Also, use the cinnamon and all the spices.  I garnished with Sour Cream and a little more shredded cheese, and I also topped mine with some raw chopped onions I had left over.  It was wonderful!

I liked this but it needed tweaking, otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars. I cut the broth in half and tripled the seasonings. I also added carrots as a personal choice and when I pureed the beans, I also pureed some extra carrots with the beans and it added some nice flavor. Thanks so much!!

This was a decent chili but not my favorite white chili however, I did change it up a little bit.
First, I only did one 15 oz. can of chicken broth to avoid it being like soup... I used 2 cans cannellini beans and one can of white beans (blended one of the cannellini). I had a red bell pepper that needed using so I added that. I only used half the amount of cinnamon (not a huge fan of it in savory dishes). And I used a taco blend for the cheese (cheddar and pepper jack blend). Served it with a dollop of sour cream, minced cilantro and tortilla chips. It was successfully consumed so I would make it again.

This is a forgiving recipe adjust it to your tastes.  I did not like the green chiles so I skip them instead I add in addition to the spices in the recipe chipolte pepper and some chili powder. I also add corn like another poster suggested and chopped fresh spinach at the end.  If I have it on hand I substitute part of the ground turkey for sweet italian turkey sausage taken out of the casing.  I have made this several times and have learned to put the browned meat, beans, corn, in the pot and add liquid as needed.  Some posters have mentioned simmering the excess liquid I do at least 20 minutes to get those wonderful spices to blend. I have also noticed when you cool and refrigerate the beans soak some liquid up.  This is great frozen and tastes even better the next day.  I am on my 7th batch of this just love it.  Do not be afraid of the cinnamon it adds a wonderful dimension to this recipe.  I also like others have mentioned never add the cheese to the pot I just sprinkle it on top of the bowl when serving with a little bit of sour cream.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I've made it several times and it's always a hit! It's become one of my signature dishes. I made a few changes: I omitted the cinnamon and I add balsamic vinegar to taste (appx. 1/4 cup for a big batch) for a little extra kick. The flavors complement each other perfectly, and I top it with cilantro, avocado, limes, shredded cheese, and sour cream, and serve it with a side of tortilla chips!! :P

I felt this recipe would be better suited to a long slow cooker than to be ready in 45 minutes...  there just isn't enough time for the great flavors to really be enhanced when you are trying to cook this in 45 minutes.  The leftovers were far better than the night we had them because the spices really opened up.  It was certainly much waterier than I prefer my chili... and I used 1 12 oz bottle of beer and 2 cups broth. 
Oh, and don't get talked out of the cinnamon all together as other reviewers reported.. it's good... I just did 3/4 teaspoon.

This recipe was great!!  We found it to have a little too much chicken broth, so in the future I think we may add brown rice to make a tad more hardy.  We also added some crushed red pepper but only because we love our food extra spicy.  Thank you for sharing!!

I've always wanted to try white chili.  This recipe is fantastic.  I don't think I'll ever eat any other chili.  I used fresh jalapeno and half of the cinnamon as others suggested. Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe, Donna.

This is a great recipe!  Instead of mashing a can of cannellini beans I add a can of refried beans!  It helps to thicken and adds a great flavor!!!

Yummy! This recipe is fabulous! I followed the recipe except for the amount of chicken broth (cut it down to 3 cups) and used leftover white beans from last night's dinner (from our local farmers market). Definitely add the cinnamon - it adds a unique flavor. Loved it and so does the family! Thanks Donna :)

Very tasty! I left out the cayenne since my stepson can't really handle anything spicy. And I added cilantro and crushed tortilla chips. It went over very well. Even BETTER the next day. Only reason I gave it a four was because of the cinnamon. I would've left that out. But to each's own!!!

I only used one can of beans and added an orange pepper. Also only used one cup of chicken broth so it was a little thicker. I added a couple splashes of Worcestershire and hot sauce to give it some depth, as well as a spoonful of brown sugar. Served it with a dollop of sour cream on top and it was perfect!

I'm used to white chicken chili so the ground turkey was a nice change. Just a little too soupy, even though I used only 4 cups of chicken broth. I think next time I will use just 3. I added extra cayenne for kick.. and I used a navy bean/great northern bean combo instead, which, in the can tastes pretty identical to cannellini. Will definitely be making this again.

This turned out really well. I did as some others suggested and added a can of corn but like someone else said - next time I will definitely use FROZEN since canned corn never loses that weird crunchiness. Since others raved about the use of cinnamon, I used the suggested amount but it was definitely overpowering! Not inedible but just really really strong. Scale down to 1/4 or 1/3 unless you are all about the cinnamon. I may substitute nutmeg in place of the cinnamon for a milder flavor next time I try this. I served with chopped green onions, extra shredded cheese, and sour cream. Some tortilla chip strips would have been great addition. All in all, a keeper! Thanks for posting!!

I've made this so many times since finding it, I can't believe I never reviewed it. It has a very unique taste the my family loves. I rinse the beans, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. My boys love adding a little salsa to their bowl.

Great recipe, easy to make and tasty. Because of personal preference and other reviews, I used a box of stock, replaced one can of green chillies for regular green pepper and used half teaspoon of cinnamon.

Pretty good. I second reducing the amount of stock as suggested in other reviews: 3 cups of stock was about right. The canned chili I had was pretty tasteless so I added a jalapeno as well, and that was about right too.

I was unsure about the oregano as I prefer to keep that particular herb in Italian dishes, but it wasn't bad.  Next time, I will leave it out and add coriander and/or curry powder.  I did decrease the chicken broth to one can and added 1/2-1 c white wine.  Good chili, everyone enjoyed it, including 5yo & 2yo.

I followed this exactly as it says to and this was so delicious, the combo of spices gives it excellent flavor.  I will definitly be making this recipe a lot.  I made a big batch of cornbread to go with it and the family loved dinner.

I like the taste of this--used 1/4 tsp cinnamon which gave it a pleasant undertone of cinnamon but not overpowering. Also, I cut down to 4 cups stock for a less soupy result. However, I did NOT like the look or mouth-feel of the ground turkey.  If I make this again, I will use shredded turkey or chicken.

This was great! I used 2.5 lbs ground turkey since that was package it came it, and it was a good amount. The flavor was so nice and my kids even ate it (18 months and 4). Definitely make again.

We really like this recipe.  I used 1.2 lbs turkey (Honeysuckle White Ground Turkey package amount) and, based on other reviews, I used 1/2 t of cinnamon, and just one can (2 cups) of broth.  Also, I drained the beans.  Other amounts were the same.  I mashed the one can of beans in a bowl since that seemed easier than getting a blender dirty.  I served it on top of tortilla chips and added the cheese last after serving it in bowls.  It was delicious and the kids loved it too.

Love love this chili!  I have made it several times, slightly different each time based on what I have available. 
Most notable change would be substituting the Monterey Jack with cheddar, I always have cheddar.  (I also only use about 1/2 a cup)
Today's change, added a bunch of chopped kale, with a few grates of fresh nutmeg, turned out really delicious.

This is by far my favorite chili recipe! The 1st time, I made as written - it was good, but a little soupy for me.  The 2nd time, I made slight alterations.   I only used 2 cans of cannellini beans and 4 cups of chicken broth. I also made it non-while chili by adding chopped red bell pepper and 1 10 oz bag of spinach.  After letting the flavors blend, in order to thicken it, I used a ladel and took out approx 2 cups of the broth & mixed in  1 Tbsp or so of cornstarch, poured back into the pot and simmered for approximately 20 min.  I will be making this often!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Donna!

LOVE this. I only used  2 cans of beans though, one can of whole beans and pureed the other can. I added some cilantro to the puree. I also substituted one small can of salsa verde for one of the cans of diced green chilis. Yum Yum Yum!

Pretty good recipe. We are not much of a fan of the taste that the cinnamon gave and I even cut the measurement down to 1/8tsp but it was different from a standard chili one usually makes with beef.  I did add a few ingredients to give more flavor and try to help the taste of the cinnamon.  After dinner, hubby and I both agreed it was a good chili.  I think that alittle bit of dillweed would be good in this recipe too. Thanks for sharing!

Really good.  Only used half the cinnamon and it was plenty.  Also incorporated one can of black beans which added a little variety to the soup.  A great soup and seemed to taste even better with time.

turned out pretty good.  Removed a lot of juices though.  A very hearty lunch and it just left me so satisfied all afternoon :)  I had to make it withy kidney beans.  The grocer had no idea what cannellini beans were.

The cinnamon in this recipe lends a wonderfully different flavor to this healthier chili! I also added ground coriander because I love how it enhances food. I also substituted paprika for cayenne pepper because it was what I had on hand. I doubled the spices (cinnamon included) and WOW... this combo is a definite flavor enhancer! And let's face it, turkey needs all the help it can get. I also added a bag of corn to the recipe (thanks to another reviewers' suggestion) and did not puree the can of beans.. it was just great the way it was! Great recipe!

I normally make white chili through a longer process of boiling a  whole chicken down and then adding all the other ingredients.  This is a quicker version is soooo good and of which I only have enough to take for lunch! A couple of recipe adjustments: only used 2 cans of beans, mashed  about a third of second can (like a meatier chili), 2-3 cups of broth, broke up two slices to Colby jack cheese because I didn't  have shredded jack to melt into it,a little bit of adobo seasoning, a little creole seasoning-didn't have cayenne pepper by itself, and Mexican oregano instead of regular.

So delish!! I like my chili a little thicker though so next time I will do 2 lbs of ground turkey, only 4 cups of chicken broth, and get 4 cans of cannellini beans puree-ing 2 of the cans. I also added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and found that it was the perfect amount of heat. Thanks for this one I will definitely make it again soon!

I only used 4 cups of broth. It is absolutely bland.  To make it edible I'm going to have to drain most of the liquid off and add  my "red" chile ingredients.

I made this for a large group - 26 people, but even multiplying this recipe to 30, it was not enough as a main course.  Good though!  I cut the broth way down to about 25% and very little cinnamon.  Topped with chopped onions and grated cheese.

Tried this tonight for something different. Like nearly all the recipes I find here, I fine tune it to my liking. Instead of turkey, I used 1lb of ground chicken. I used 4 cups of chicken broth, reserving 1/2 cup to add 2 tbsp corn starch and make a roux to add later to thicken it up a bit. 5 cups of broth will definitely make this, "soup." I didn't include chilis or add the jack cheese, but otherwise used the recipe as it stood. I thought it was delicious! Definitely a departure from my traditional "red" chili that I make. Which is exactly why my wife didn't care for this recipe. I would have given it 5 stars if she had liked it better. She said it was okay, but liked the "red" chili better. Definitely give this a try if you want a break from "red" chili, beef stew or chicken noodle soup on a cool evening.

I added some chopped mushrooms when sauteing the turkey and onions.  I'd actually call this more of a turkey mushroom soup rather than a chili.  The cinnamon adds great depth of flavor.  Cilantro would be a great addition next time.  Awesome recipe!

Husband approved - and he doesn't even like beans!  I added some broth to the beans while pureeing to cut down on the paste factor.  Also omitted the cinnamon because it made me nervous, and a hefty teaspoon of red pepper flakes without any cayenne on hand; salt & black pepper to taste.  Went a little overboard on the garlic because we love and it doesn't overpower at all.  I'll probably make this once a week, it's so tasty AND filling... but relatively guilt-free!  Thanks for a keeper.

great flavor!!!  I don't really like ground turkey and prefer ground chicken - but this was awesome.  I had a 1 lb pack of turkey - so scaled it down to 5 portions.  Increased the cumin and oregano to 2 teaspoons - used 2 cups of chicken broth, 2 fresh jalapenos, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Added the cayanne and white pepper to taste.  Added some cilantro at the end, put the cheese on top instead of in with a little sour cream.  Served over crushed tortillo chips.

I liked this recipe, but only gave it 4 stars b/c of the changes that I'll make next time.  Instead of adding all of the broth at once, I'll do it gradually.  I'll also puree an additional can of beans to substitute for at least half of the cheese.  My family enjoyed it. Watch your spices!

I changed it up quite a bit due to personal taste.  I put in more garlic then the recipe calls for.  I only added 4 cups of chicken broth but then i added 1 cup of water and 4 chicken bouillon cubes.  I also added 1 can of corn.  As far as the spices go i added in crushed red pepper to make it a touch spicier.  I added 2 tablespoons corn starch to make it a bit thicker and more like chili instead of soup.
  Overall it was a great starter recipe and with a few changes due to your own personal taste it will make a great chili!

Great new taste! Love the cinnamon! I only gave 4 stars because of an issue with it thickening up. I had a lot of time so I let it simmer and reduce for a couple hours. I also added 1/4 flour (whisked smooth in water first) to thicken. It turned out thick enough finally, and my sister in law, who is allergic to many ingredients in traditional red chile (onion, which I left out, beef and tomato, poor thing) was in heaven! Thanks!

I made this for my picky 12 year old son. I followed the directions except that I left out the chiles and pepper because he won't eat spicy food. Even without the heat, this is still pretty good! My only complaint was that the writer didn't mention whether or not to drain/rinse the beans. I only started scratch cooking a few years ago, and have discovered that seasoned cooks forget to mention important details that make or break a dish. I have become dependent on other readers' reviews because they have saved me from many kitchen disasters! Thanks for the recipe, will make notes to self and use again!

Really good with some modifications:
Used two cans beans, 1 can chilies, 1 can chicken broth and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Stirred in cheddar cheese. Yum. 6 and 4 year old kids ate two bowls and gave it a thumbs up. Definitely will make again.

This was extremely good. I had never made or even tasted white chili before, and I loved it. I added cheddar instead of Monterey Jack, because it is what I had on hand. Mine did come out a bit thin, more like soup than chili, but that didn't make me love it any less. Next time I may add corn starch to thicken and omit the cheese in the chili and just sprinkle it on the top instead. This will become a regular dinner around here.

I must have missed something here!  It was pretty bland and too thin.  I can follow directions rather well, so I just didn't like this recipe.  I like turkey chili with left over turkey so  maybe it's just the ground meat thing.  You can't really "brown" ground turkey, can you?

Loved this!  but did tweek it a bit.  eliminated cinammon. reduced to 2 cans of cannellini beans, added can of black beans, and can of hominy (rinsed). Reduced broth to 3 cups and added a can of green enchilada sauce.  then at the end, added about of cup of chopped cilantro.  rave reviews from hungry boys!

Just served my boyfriend and I some of this wonderful chili a few minutes ago, and it's wonderful and spicy!  Perfect for our cooler, overcast day today!  My bf kept commenting on how amazing the kitchen smelled as I was cooking this.  Definitely a keeper.  

Changes that I made to use up stuff we had in the fridge:  Chopped chicken thighs instead of turkey; about 2 tbps chopped , canned jalapenos, instead of green chilies; 1 small chopped tomato; 2 very tiny potatoes, some coarse sea salt, a couple of twists of freshly ground black pepper, a couple of shakes of crushed red pepper.  Left out the white pepper because I didn't have any.  

Overall, great recipe.  Will definitely make again!

This was really good. I substituted rotisserie chicken meat for the ground turkey, and it was excellent! Will definitely make this again!

A nice change from regular chili; however, seems like a mix between a chili and soup even though I cut the chicken broth to one can.  I didn't have cannellini beans so used one can each of navy, chickpea and lentils.  Doubled the cumin and oregano as well.  Finally, I was out for the afternoon so threw everything in the crockpot for four hours on high setting so I didn't bother blending/food processing the third can of beans... and maybe this is why it wasn't as thick?  Love the hint of cinnamon w/ the heat of the chilies!

I love this chili!  I accidentally added a half tablespoon of paprika and I added taco seasoning to the ground turkey while it was cooking.  This came from another chili recipe on this site and I accidentally combined the recipes, however it all turned out amazing!  I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit more spicy so next time I'm going to add some cayenne pepper!  This is a very simple and easy recipe, I had it ready in a little over an hour because I take a while to prep things.  I highly recommend this, it's very flavourful!

i really like the base ingredients, but i think the dish is kind of bland.  i reduced cinnamon and tripled all other seasonings and i still taste overwhelming cinnamon.  also, next time i will make sure to have tomatoes or salsa to enhance the drab color of the dish and pep up flavor!

So delicious! Didn't have the green chilies, but great anyways and mild for my kids to enjoy. I used a cup less of broth to make it thicker and also added some arrowroot at the end to thicken it up. I also added some salt and did not add cheese. This recipe will go on our menu for sure!

This was really good! Went easy on the cinnamon, but the chopped chiles really added a nice flavor. This will be a regular at our house. Served it with iron skillet cornbread and honey butter.

Fantastic Chili! This has become a fall/winter staple in our household!   I generally don't like canned beans, since they add so much salt, so I soak white northern beans overnight, and use those instead. Otherwise, I stay true to the recipe!  2 thumbs up, and a YUM!

Wonderful! I cut back the chicken broth to 4 cups and simmered it for longer than specified, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I loved the blend of flavors. Next time I will make this with corn bread. I think they'd go well together.

LOVED IT!  So easy and yummy!!  I always read the reviews and make a few changes.  I did not use all the chicken broth (but sorry can't tell you exactly how much I used...about 3 to 4 cups).  I let the broth reduce and added a bit more as needed.  It was thick just we like our chili. I only used 1 can of green chiles and for our tastes it was probably enough.  Had just enough of a kick and not enough to be hot. I only used 2 cans of beans and I used Great Northern.  This will be added to my regular rotation!  Can't say enough how easy this was to make and to adpapt to your personal tastes.

My husband and I are so in love with this white chili! Ive always hated turkey but I took the chance and I'm just so stunned. I used whatever white beans I have on hand and omitted the cinnamon.

Well I changed this up a bit due to my pantry not having all of the ingredients, so it is 5 stars to me but this is what I did differently.  I used one can of cannellini beans, one can of pinto beans and one can of garbanzo beans (weird mix I know)  I had no canned chile peppers so I used two fresh jalapenos and I added in a small cube of chipotle seasoning.   I had no cinnamon so I used a tiny bit of pumpkin pie spice, I honestly couldn't tell if it contributed anything to the dish but it didn't make it worse.  No cayenne or white pepper as I felt the other spicy ingredients were enough for me.  I used NO chicken broth...I sauteed the ground turkey and onions which released alot of moisture and I didn't fully drain the beans which added some liquids. After letting it simmer for about an hour it reduced down quite a bit so I just added 1/2 cup of water and simmered for another half hour and it was the perfect consistency without having all of that added sodium from the broth.  Lastly, I had two small sticks of reduced fat colby jack cheese and two slices of mild cheddar I threw in there to balance the spicy.  I bet this would be even better in a slow cooker but I didn't have the time, this recipe is definitely a keeper and pretty healthy for chili!

This is the first time i have made or eatten white chili.  I don't have anything to compare it to but it sure was yummy.  I was shocked when my 4 kids cleaned their bowls as well.  I used 4 cups of broth but had more beans.  I bought those big  48oz jars of great northern beans and used a jar and a half.  One jar I didn't drain, but I did drain the half.  This ended up being the perfect consistency.  I also used diced chicken breast and cut the cinnamon in half.  I echo another's advice: resist the urge to omit the cinnamom!

I really didn't like the flavor of this chili.  I made it as written.  The chili, itself, really comes together well, but there's just something about the flavor that I didn't like...I'm not sure if it's the cinnamon/cheese combo.

Amazing white chili.  The seasonings are perfect.  I doubled the beans, and served the shredded jack on top (with cilantro) instead of mixing the cheese into the chili, because some people in my household prefer it without cheese.  ( I know, I think they are freaks of nature too :)  Actually, the cheese on top was delicious.  It stuck together in a delectable melty blob which you can scoop up in portions that personally suit  you.   A perfect meal regardless of the of how you eat it!

I thought this was an excellent dish! I have been trying to find different things to make with ground turkey and this was perfect! Although, I didn't have any ground cinnamon I threw a cinnamon stick in there for awhile to catch some of its flavor! Loved this! Will be making again and again!! Thank you!

This is really really good. I made a few changes. I cooked the garlic onion and a jalapeno that I added in 2 Tablespoons of butter first, then added only 1 lb of turkey. I also only used 2 cans of beans and 3.5 or 4 cups of stock. I also let each person add cheese in their bowl. The cinnamon is definitely a must in this. You may want to add some salt too. Really good with jalapeno cornbread.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made! I reduced the chicken broth to about 3.5 cups just because I like my chili a little thicker. I also reduced the cumin to 2 tsps. and the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. I also put in 4 cups of cheese! I know that adds too much fat for some of you to like, but it made it so much thicker and creamier! Thanks for a GREAT recipe :-)

This recipes was great with a few additions.  I added corn with peppers like another reviewer suggested, and I also added some Schriracha Sauce for a little more heat.  Also, topped with a little Habanero Shredded cheese...delicious!

excellent! I added red pepper flakes and doubled the cumin & oregano, I also added in about 4 tbsp of jalapeno cheese along w/mozz cheese b/c I had no monteray jack cheese. I simmered for about an hour to thicken up & not be runny. Had some left over cheddar & bacon biscuits to soak everything up- yum!

Took some suggestions from others and used 4 cups broth, used a little less cheese and cinnamon. Still super watery...Kept adding cornstarch to thicken. I wouldn't use any more than 3 cups if you want a chili and not soup.   Bottom line is it was bland. We had to add everything we could think of to give it flavor. Very disappointed and will go back to my standard recipe with good old chili powder and kidney beans/tomatoes.

Delicious! I cut back on some of the broth as well, since we like a thicker chili and added some corn starch. My boyfriend's new fav!

Great alternative to the red chili version I grew up with. Hearty enough for a meal with a salad on the side and some fresh bread. thanks for sharing.

This recipe was easy to follow and turned out great!  I made some very slight modifications.  I used hot green chile's because I wanted to add a little more spice.  I also served sliced lime on the side, which was the perfect complement to the flavor of the chili.  Use less chicken broth if you like thick chili.

The chili ended up being delicious but I had to tweak the recipe to my liking.  It definitely needed more spice so I ended up doubling the cumin and added some chili powder as well.  Also there is too much liquid for my taste.  It was very soupy so I ended up having to add some cornstarch mixed with cold water.  I will make it again, I just won't add as much broth next time.  Once the cheese is added it really comes alive and takes on it's own personality.  Yummy.

Love this recipe!  The only thing I did different is I use a white chili spice mix instead of the spices listed in the recipe. I add that to the ground turkey when it is frying to get all that flavor into the meat. And at the end I serve it over yellow spanish rice, which adds a nice flavor to the dish.

Excellent, easy to make very healthy.  I made some modifications as didn't want to go to the store and we're eating healthy.  So, I cut the recipe in 1/2  Here's what I left out as I didn't have any - green chile peppers and cheese.  I used white Navy beans.  Here's what I added to make it a little healthier, turmeric and 1 chopped carrot.  To thicken I added arrowroot, great thickener and allowed on Gluten free diet I understand.  I did put in the cinnamon as that is on the healthy food list and I agree with those that say "don't leave out the cinnamon".  I rarely make things twice with all the wonderful recipes but I'll make this one again, healthy and my husband loved it.

I've had better white chili, namely with shredded chicken instead of ground meat, and I thought the cinnamon in this recipe overpowered the rest of the flavors.  The cheese also adds a lot of calories.

I thought this was fantastic. Most  white chili I make tends to taste like meat+ veg + beans in chicken stock, but this had actual flavor.  I added a a few shavings of dark chocolate to one serving, which went nicely with the spice of the chili and cumin.

I've been making the recipe from this site for years now, and I get rave reviews every single time I make it!  I had the whole family in for Thanksgiving & made it with shredded leftover turkey instead of ground turkey as usual - it was still great!  When I made it for a neighborhood progressive dinner - EVERYONE asked for the recipe!  The cinnamon seems like a strange ingredient, but don't leave it out - and use the amount specified - no one will ever guess it's in there, but it doesn't taste as good without it.  This is one of the best recipes I've ever gotten from Allrecipes - and it's healthy too.  It's all good!!!

This chili is so delicious, although I had to make a few changes. I used 2 cans white beans (couldn't find cannelini) and one can black. I pureed one can of white beans. I added a can of corn. Did not at cinnamon because I used it in spaghetti once and my husband hated it. Wasn't spicy at all so I will add more cayenne next time. I also have to admit that I really do not like the taste of turkey so next time I will use some ground chicken/pork that we have and I believe that it will be a thousand times better. Also used 4 cups broth but will use 3 next time.

A little bland, needs more spices. If I had added a little more pepper it may have been better. My husband had to add some hot sauce to his.

Add the broth a cup at a time! Mine turned out too soupy because I just dumped it all in. Next time will decrease the broth. Important! ..READ THE NOTE AT THE TOP by the poster as to what to garnish it with. This makes a HUGE difference! Since those items weren't in the ingredients list, I left them off the first time & had an OK (but icky color) chili. USE THE GARNISHES!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I LOVE this chili. It's healthy and filling and so good.  Here is how I change it to make it our own....4 cloves minced garlic instead of 3, sweet onion, diced green green chilis, little extra cumin and be careful not to overdue the cinnamon, i only use 1 can of beans, and after i've added 2 cans chicken broth, I add about cup and half of instant white rice, cover and simmer for 10 mins.  PHENOMENAL.  We eat it with little sour cream, mexi blend shredded cheese and my husband scoops it up with tortilla chips.  I put about 1 cup mexi blend cheese in after the rice is done and mix it up and serve! I've toyed with the idea of pureeing the 2 other cans of beans, leaving the rice out and baking it with a cheese layer and then serving it as a dip, I'll re-review once I've tried it. Thank you for this recipe, it's the best!

This was really good.  I may a few minor changes to appeal to my 3 year old.  Eliminated green chilies and reduced the spices by 1/2.  Used cut up chicken instead of ground turkey.

I just made this recipe and it's good but I'm not a fan of cinnamon (it gives me a migraine) I thought I would try just a bit 1/4tsp. It didn't give me a migraine but we didn't like the taste. Otherwise it was a great alternative to chili. I drained & rinsed 2 cans of beans the 3rd I mashed with a fork leaving all the starch in the can. I used 3 cups of stock and it was perfect. The starch from the beans helped to thicken it up nicely. I also added a little sour cream when we ate it. I will make again just leaving out the cinnamon next time.

I thought this was very tasty, as did my husband and 2 year old daughter. I added 2 cups of frozen white corn. I used 3 cups of chicken stock as suggested by another cook, and that worked good...not thick, but more like a hearty soup. I used beans on hand which was white beans and pinto beans for the pureed portion. I would make again

I love it and it taste even better in a crock pot after 2 hours.  I kinda liked the cinnamon but I don't think everyone would.  I also added an extra bag of cheese and more salt.

So good and a great alternative to regaulr chili that can feel heavy at times. I doubled the recipe and added a can of corn. Somebody suggested to monitor the chicken broth to make it as thick as you want it and that was a great suggestion. My husband and mother loved it and want me to make it again!

I made this for me and my husband, we both loved it! I did not add any cheese to the chili, I had it on the side and I added a can of corn to it too. I will make this yummy chili again

Delicious! The cinnamon should definitely not be omitted - it really makes the dish! However, next time I make it I'll leave out a cup or so of the broth... Just a little soupy for what I was going for.

Very good chili. Spices were perfect. I omited the cheese and added 1 tsp chili powder. I would make again. This is more of a soup, so if you want it thicker, cut back to 2 cans stock and let it reduce by cooking uncovered for 30-60 minutes.

great recipe! But, it did need alot of seasoning for my family, I added garlic salt and some sea salt, I would not use the cinnamon next time it gave it a weird flavor, maybe 1/2 the cinnamon next time? It almost made it smell like tripe in menudo while its cooking......sorry. But very good besides that =)

This was yummy! I made some changes based on other reviews. I only added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and cut the chicken broth down to 2 cups. I didn't have a third can of beans so I added a can of cream of chicken soup, this made it nice and thick. I added 1 cup of pepper jack cheese and saved 1 cup to sprinkle on top. Served with sour cream and tortilla chips. Everyone thought it was Delicious.

This was pretty good. Followed the recipe, but added a little less then half the broth called for. Still a little soupy but good. I was a little unsure how spicey it would turn out, but it was hardly spicey at all, which isn't a bad thing for me since I've got little kids who don't like spiceness that much.

Phenominal. I always loyally loved my dad's traditional red chili with lots of fritos and cheese but I actually prefer this one.  I recommend about double the cumin but that's the way I like it.  I also load on the pepper but be careful with that cayenne, it's hot!

Ok, the flavor is good.  I love cinnamon with meat (ever since I tried it with my Greek friends!) But this was very "soupy"...And I only used 2 cups of chicken broth!! I like chili to be more hearty and less watery.  Next time I will start with one cup, and add more if needed.

This was DELICIOUS!!! It's a good white chili base recipe then just adjust the amount of liquids, spices etc. to your liking. The changes I made were to only use 3 Cups chicken broth, I halved all the spices since my husband does not like spicy foods, I also thickened with equal parts cornstarch and water. I also really liked the subtle cinnamon flavor it blended very nicely with the oregano, cayanne, and cumin. We will definitely be having this chili again and again. Thank you!!!!!

I have been making this recipe for about six years, I have replaced the ground turkey with ground chicken. To make it quicker onion & garlic POWDER are just as good.  Cannelini or Great Northern Beans.  I always puree one can of beans along with the green chiles.  This is the greatest recipe for "tweaking" to your own personal preference, and it always turns out well. It's my "dish" that I always have to make for my husband's hunting trips, without room for discussion.

This was a very good dish. I have wanted to try alternative chili recipes and I am glad I chose this one.  The only thing I would do different would be to back off a little of the cinnimon.  I used the full teaspoon and it was too much for my tastes.  I think next time I will do 1/2 to 3/4 of a teaspoon and go from there.  I have never mixed cheese in the whole pot of chili.  We normally add to our individual bowls, but this addition makes the dish.  I will be making this dish again for a potluck this week and will keep warm in the crock pot.  Thanks.

I'm really glad that I read the reviews and knew to reduce the amount of chicken broth to 3 cups.  I did add a can of corn with was really good.  I think this one needs the cinnamon but I will use half the amount or maybe less next time, it was too obvious.  Also, I used shredded chicken breasts instead of the turkey.  I made it for my parents and my dad claimed ALL of the leftovers.

Very light and good recipe. Served it's purpose of filling up my 9 year old boy that has a problem with his tongue and can not eat red sauces including normal chili. I did however tweak it. I took everyone's advice and cut the chicken broth to 1-14 oz. can. I only added 1-4 oz. can of the green chilis. 3/4 tsp. of the cumin. Only a pinch of the cinammon and a pinch of the cayenne. I substituted 1 can of the white beans for black beans. I also added an extra large clove of garlic. However, I still felt it was to thin of a consistency for our liking so I thickened it with a water/flour mixture. Added half a bag of the 4 blended Mexican mix cheeses. Added a dollop of sour crean and served with tortilla chips. Wonderful!! Would definitely make again!

This is REALLY good.  The spices and flavor is just right.  (however, I left out the cinnamon.)  If you are afraid of it being to salty, I reccomend rinsing the beans before adding them to the chilli.

It was perfect with just a couple alterations, otherwise it would have been a 5 star for sure! I only used 2.5 cups of chicken broth (half of what the original recipe calls for).. I tend to like my chili a little soupier than chunky, and it was perfect with 2.5 cups, 5 would have been WAY too much!!!! Also, I only used 1/2 tbs of cinnamon. I was worred that the cinnamon would overpower the other spices.. Using 1/2 tbs gave it just the right taste without being able to identify cinnamon as the "secret ingredient". I will be making this again!!

I just love this recipe. Tried it for the first time last night...great hit with the family. Esp.my husband, a picky eater. The only thing I did different was I used 3 lbs of ground turkey as I love alot of meat, used 2 more cloves of minced garlic by adding it into the puree. 2 cans of the white beans and 1 can of black beans. I pureed the white one. I used 3 cups of chickern broth as I love my chilli thick and ate this with a lot of saltine crackers & grated cheese. Recommend this for anyone who loves good savoury food.

I thought this chili was pretty good and different.  I've never tasted anything like it before.  I used 1 can of black and 2 cans of white kidney beans, increased the cayenne and decreased the chicken broth to 1 1/2 cups, I also decreased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.  The next time I make this, I think I will skip the cinnamon.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point, and it turned out so good! Although, it wasn't "white" when I finished.  I added a little chili powder, a can of fire roasted tomatoes, 10 oz of frozen corn and a can of black beans.  Also,  I always add a can of beer when I make chili - you can't leave that out. I love the idea of adding corn chips as a topper.

We loved this!  Can't have cheese so we omited that and I added corn as people suggested.  The flavor was great and I loved the cinnamon- but I love interesting and funky spice concoctions.  When my hubby heard there was cinnamon in it- he didn't think he would like it- but he absolutely loved it and went for seconds.  This one is a keeper.

The recipes was too soup like, so I had to add less chicken broth. I threw in a small can of corn on my own too -- otherwise it would have been a 5. It was different, but a really nice change from the traditional chili I always have.

I read the reviews and made some revisions; for instance, I only added one cup of chicken broth to maintain thickness! For variety, I also added one can of black beans (with the two white beans, of which one I pureed) and a can of Mexicorn. I like a lot of spice, so I added a lot more cumin and cinnamon, and I also added chili pepper and pureed chipotle peppers in adobo. I only put a couple handfuls of lowfat cheese in to keep it light, and next time, I will add some fresh cilantro at the end.

I LOVE this chili and make it at least 2x per month.  It has depth and an interesting spice mix.  I usually let it simmer for a longer time to let the flavors meld.  I also add a couple of chopped carrots and/or frozen corn to the pot as well.  Yum!

Wonderful! First time we ever tried a white chili and we loved it. Only change I made was cut the broth back to just one can so we could have a thicker consistency. Hubby was shocked when I told him about the cinnamon!

I really enjoyed this.  Was a little scared about the cinnamon since my husband is so picky, so I cut it back for the first time, but I think it would be fine at the full amount.  Definitely would make again.

This was fantastic!  I used 2 pounds of ground turkey, an extra can of beans, and two tsp of cumin instead of one.  I used mozzerella cheese instead of jack, and added it when I served it to cut down on the fat.  It turned out really well, and we had plenty of leftovers.  I think it was even better the second day!  I'll definately be making this again!

Delicious!!!...I added diced green pepper to the onions and garlic to soften, then added the ground turkey. I decreased the oregano by half, and used 4c.fat free/low sodium chix broth, used 2 cans of canelli beans, one whole and one pureed, also added 1 tlbspn chili powder. Loved the flavors and was pleasantly surprised by the cinnamon flavor. Will make again!

I made this chili for a tailgate party and it was gone in 15 minutes.  A few changes that I made: I used half of the cinnamin and you could still taste it but it was subtle enough to be a nice taste but not overpowering.  I used one can of corn.  I used half of the broth and I used an equal amount of both mild and hot green chiles.  I also did not add the cheese until serving the chili.  An extra clove of garlic or two can never hurt either.  Topped with sour cream and cheese and served.  It was the best chili at the tailgate.

I was looking for something to make with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and so I used cubed turkey instead of ground turkey.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I have to give this only 3 stars because the cinnamon flavor pervaded the dish, that's all I could taste, it was very prevalent.  My husband however loved it (although this was afer an afternoon of watching football afer having consumed numerous beers).  I don't think I will make again, but if I do, I will omit the cinnamon, because I think it might have been pretty good without it.

This was good, but I did make a few changes. I cut the broth to 2 cups to give it more of a chili texture..not soupy. I also did not like it with the cinnamon the 1st time so now I make it without it. I add some diced jalapeno for more kick and top with sour cream. Easy and quick meal and a nice change from regualr chili. Thanks!

Excellent basic recipe.   I didn't realize that I was out of oregano so I substituted w/ fresh cilantro.  As per other reviewers, I added 1 can of corn (drained) and I reduced the broth & cinnamon. As I see it, these were small changes to an excellent quick recipe.

This is different and delicous.  If using the 3-5 cups of broth, I would suggest not adding cheese to pot as it gets stringy and just sticks to the pot and serving utensil.  Pureeing some beans for thicker base would probably help this.  I used 1 can great northern, 1 can red kidney, and 1 small can corn because it's what I had - and adds some color.  I also used some whole cumin seeds, in addition to listed ingreds.

We tried this recipe tonight and got really good reviews from everybody. My family and then extended family were over and they all LOVED it! The picture doesn't do justice for this recipe. My husband said this would be a recipe he would like to keep in rotation. Tasted better with flour tortillas we all thought and added the cheese individually. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. A+++

Awesome flavor and so easy to make! I loved it, my husband loved it and the left overs were good too. It was quick to make, inexpensive and simple. I'll definately add this to my regular dishes. I usually get bored with ground turkey, but with this soup you can't even tell that it's turkey.

This is a very tasty chili. I used 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon and that was almost too much and I love cinnamon. Next time I make it, I will only use 1/2 tsp. My family did like it also!

I had always been suspicious of white chili, thinking it couldn't be nearly as tasty as red chili. Boy, was I wrong! This is DELICIOUS! Like others, I made few changes. I used one 14.75 ounce can of chicken broth and found that was more than enough liquid. To make sure things didn't get soupy, I also drained the beans before adding them. I find the flavor of cinnamon to be too overpowering, so I decreased the amount to 1/2 a teaspoon which was plenty for me. (Don't omit the cinnamon...it's essential to the flavor of this dish.)I love cheese, so I upped the amount to 3 cups. I served the chili atop Baked Corn Casserole and had a fantastic dinner! What a wonderful way to warm up on a cold winter day!

What a sinker - in the trash can! We were really looking forward to this, being white chili fans, and it was awful. The cinnamon was over powering and was a complete disconnect with what could have been an okay recipe.

Cinnamon aside, it was very bland and I'm certain one could find a better chili recipe than this one.

I only used one can (2 cups) of chicken broth and it was still a little soupy at first but thickened up as it cooled. I didn't add the cinnamon this time, but will try it next time.

This was very good, however I did make a few changes.  I didn’t add any cinnamon and I reduced the chicken broth like other reviewers.  I had some shredded turkey on hand so I used that instead of ground turkey.  To make it a little thicker I mixed a little cornstarch and water to the chili and that seemed to help.  I also didn’t put any cheese on it so it was a little healthier – maybe next time I will find some low-fat cheese and add it.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I took some suggestions and cut down the broth to 2 cups, and used 2 cans pinto and one can kidney beans, instead of cannelini.  Also substituted ground chicken, because I had it on hand.  It turned out good, and can easily be changed for what you have on hand.

Awesome!! I agree, the color is not very appetizing however, but the taste means everything! I did add slighly less cinnamon than was called for.  I simmered with the lid off after adding the broth and I didn't think it was too watery at all.  TASTES GREAT!!

This was good with a few minor changes.  I added an 11oz can of corn and only used two cans of beans and no chicken broth.  There is definately enough liquid without the broth and I think it would be too soupy with it.  I took another reviewers advice and added a healthy amount of fresh lime juice and cilantro!!  Extra yummy.  Thanks!!

I originally gave this three stars, but leftovers were better, especially when you add the secret ingredient...lime juice! Squeeze plenty of lime juice as garnish along with cheese, cilantro, and crumbled tortilla chips (lime flavored are great). I would skip all that useless cheese mixed in next time, too. Great with corn muffins.

This had a GREAT flavor.  Don't skip the cinammon- it makes the dish.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the color was a bit unappetizing- kind of a gray/beige color.  Adding a lot of chopped cilantro or even chopped spinach would help.

This was great!  Even my 5-year-old and 2-year-old loved it.  I reduced the broth to 3 cups and used just a pinch of cinnamon.  Last time I made it I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey, diced.  Wonderful!

Excellent stuff... the flavor was perfect but the consistency was a little soupy.  I didn't drain the beans so think I'll do that next time and possibly use only 4 cups of broth.  Either way, its a really great recipe!!  Oh, and top with shredded monterey jack cheese... yummy!

I would have given this 5 stars, but the recipe amounts were definately off.  5 cups of broth and 3 cans of beans would have been way too much.  I only used 1 can of broth...and 2 cans of beans were plenty.  Also, I added mushrooms.  The meal was amazing and was delicious the next day.

This was tastier than I thought and was very easy. Since I didn't have the beans, I substituted the beans with cooked rice as another reviewer suggested.  I also put about 3 cups of chicken broth instead of 5.  The combination of spices smelled and tasted good!

This recipe is Awesome!  My husband and daughter are picky eaters and they both loved it.  I brought the leftovers to work and the praise continued.  Reading the previous recipe suggestions really helped.  I did reduced the amount of chicken broth and, yes, do not omit the cinnamon.  I will definately make this again.

My husband LOVED this---said he would eat it "frequently." I used the spices as is except a dash of hot sauce for the cayenne pepper. Also, 1 can of chilis and 2 cans of beans: one mashed, one not. For broth, 2 bouillon cubes and 2 c. water. Tasted even better the next day, with a real Indian flavor, so next time I'll make it on a Sunday to eat during the week! Made 4 large servings over brown rice.

I love this recipe, I change nothing apart from less chicken broth to make it thicker and less like soup. Here in England, white chili is unknown but an American friend got me hooked! This is one of the best I have tried.

The cinnamon was somewhat overpowering.  I also thought it wasn't thick enough and let it reduce for a couple of hours before serving.  But it definitely has potential if you play around a bit.

Fabulous!  Didn't have time to grocery shop, so used chicken breasts (great texture) and only 1-3/4 cups chicken broth.  Left everything else the same, including cinnamon.  Great flavor.  This is a keeper.

This chili was easy to make, but was a bit bland. I added some extra spice, used less broth and added a little less cheese. It turned out creamy and tasted pretty good, though it was still very mild. I did not miss the tomatoes, and will probably try this again with some alterations.

Simply put, this recipe was to die for!  Awesome.  My husband, who isn't a fan of "new" stuff absolutely loved this.  I used Great Northern Beans instead but didn't change anything else.  Definitely a keeper!

This chili is excellent!  I have never made chili before trying this, and it is the best I've ever had!  I too cut the broth to 2 cans (~3 cups), and I have no idea what cannelli beans are, so I used kidney and others, and used cornstarch in the end to thicken.  But delicious, Delicious, DELICIOUS!

Nice meal for a chilly October night. I've never had white chili before, so I can't compare, but this was very flavorful!  I cut back on the chicken broth (only 3 cups) and it was still a bit too soupy for my taste.  I thickened it with cornstarch and it was perfect. Served with sour cream, tortillas, and chipolte salsa.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks!

This was so good!! Very easy, too. I think the cinnamon is what made it so special. It was more like soup than regular chili, but the flavor was perfect. I'll definitely make this again, and often!! Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this for an office chili cookoff.  It won the first place prize in the "white chili" category.  (Although it helped that mine was the only white chili entered!)  : )  Very easy to make.

this was an awesome recipe as a student in Culinary school I had to make a Chili that was white with ground turkey and I had to have white beans and use cranberries. if you add cranberries add them to the end it helps cut the spicy but if you add to early its not as good. this was a competition and I was the only one not a Chef. out of 100 votes I was second place with 40 the first place had 41, the other 19 votes were spread between the three other Chefs. Guess I can't complain I kicked three Chefs butts in this competition, this is a good recipe

This recipe is very adaptable and so delicious!   The first time I made it, the cinnamon was way too much so now I only put in about 1/4 of it or none at all.  I have made this with leftover diced turkey or chicken with great results and have also added a can of hominy which adds great texture.  Serve with tortilla chips!

Liked the flavors.  I only put in 4c of broth and still wwwaaaayyyy too much liquid.  Before I added the cheese I brought it to boiling then simmered until the liquid reduced by half.

Delicious!  I actually added 8 cups of chicken stock and let it reduce down for 45 minutes and it was thick and yummy!  I didn’t add the cheese to cut down on calories and fat and only added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and increased the pepper and cayenne because we love spicy but it was perfect!  Will definitely make again!

This was a yummy chili! The spices give it wonderful flavor. I added extra cumin and white pepper, and some Penzey's vindaloo seasoning as I am out of cayenne right now. I prefer a thicker chili so might play around with that next time, but my family loved it as is! Served with jalapeño corn bread.

Oh my yes!!!  This is really, really good, and in my red chili loving family a real surprise.  I made it with hot pork sausage for extra depth of flavor, and for goodness sake, don't leave out the pinch of cinnamon.  I know, strange, but trust the other 980 of us, you won't taste it but will appreciate it.  Mine was made with dry beans, pressure cooked for 30 minutes, then added the broth, veggies and chilies.  I added a small can of green chilis and at first it was really spicy, but settled down after about 6 hours in the crock pot.  Served with monterey jack cheese and fritos, we have dinner!!!!

I have made this several times, sometimes taking out the garlic and onions for guests with food allergies and it is always a hit.  I also subtract the cheese just to lower the calorie count a bit.

It was delish! I highly recommend this recipe. Of course adjust it to your liking. Mine came out a bit soupy but I know that I used more broth than needed. I added a little cornstarch water mixture. It helped a little. Thank you!

This recipe is super easy  and practical to make. I made it at school for our Thanksgiving lunch.  Everybody loved it!  I am, definitely, making it again for my family.  I actually did  save a cup of the chili for my daughter and she asked me to please make some at home.  I love easy and yummy recipes and this one is a winner.

I tried to make this as close to the original recipe as I could. Honest I tried. I sadly only had two cans of white kidney beans & so I sub. 1 can chick peas, used can of Guinness (it would have been a crime not too and its preference of mine in chilli just adds a richness to the dish.) I used fresh green chili's and a pablano pepper. what I had to work with on the chillis. 
I wish I had some white pepper it would have really elevated the whole thing. don't skip out on this or the cinnamon. doesn't seem like it makes a difference but seem to me that would have made this a WOW dish instead of Very Good-great.
My family devoured it. thanks for the recipe. will make again.

Added jalapeños with the green chilis and reduced the broth to only 3 cups.  Might need to thicken depending on tastes.  Great chili.  Works with good cheddar too.

Not to be the typical - I made it but I made a million changes person. I made it but I made a million changes. I left the cheese out of the chili and used a habanero jack and feta for garnish. I also cut down on the chicken stock - about 4 cups - and then brought the chili to a boil and reduced to simmer until it reduced a bit (about 20-25 min). I doubled the amount of fresh garlic, doubled the spices that were called for, and added ground cilantro, onion powder, garlic powder, and agave nectar. Garnished with fresh cilantro. It's fantastic!

We make this all the time.  For  school/sport nights, it can also be done in the croc-pot ahead of time.  My entire family loves it!  I use ground chicken instead of turkey  (I like it better) and we add corn (my son loves it).  Other than that, we pretty much make it according to the recipe!  Absolutely wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe.

This was yummy.
I made this close to the given directions. I scaled down to 4 persons. The recipe then calls for 3/4 lbs meat and 1 1/2 cans beans. I used the whole lb meat, and added 1 1/2 cans beans and puréed the remaining half. I also took other members suggestions and added chicken broth to come out the way our family likes chili.
We had crushed up tortilla chips with it and it was delicious. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this and let me tell you it is amazing. I followed the recipe, but as others mentioned, I only had 1 pund packages of ground turkey, so I used 2 packages. I reduced the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp, increased all the others to taste, especially garlic. I drained the beans and on carton (4 cups) of chicken broth. Wish I would not have drained the beans I pureed, due to lack of thickness. I felt it needed more salt so I added garlic salt to taste.  Served with crushed tortilla chips, sour cream, green onions and cheese. with corn bread. Turned out to be very good!!

Great recipe.  I only used one can of broth. I used less of the broth like others suggested it was still a little watery. The cinnamon was overwhelming for me next time I will use half  than what the recipe calls for.

This is the first time I have tried a recipe that had so many positive reviews which I ended up not liking.   The cinnamon does not need to go in the recipe!!!! Totally throws the taste off!   I didn’t even use but a half a teaspoon. 
And I don’t get the cheese, either.....If anything, it should just be used as a top off after you serve it.  Like somebody else said, the Cheese ends up ‘globbing’ onto the meat.  Weird.  I ended up throwing a can of Rotel’s chipotle diced tomatoes and green chilies in and a packet of taco seasoning. I can’t stand to waste, so this made it tolerable to eat. Also, this DEFINITELY should go under the SOUP category.  It’s not chili.

Super delicious! I agree with some of the other reviewers - you don't need all 5 cups of broth. Depends on how thick you like your chili. I found the blend of spices and flavors in this really wonderful.

I made this recipe as written, except for swapping out the ground turkey for chopped chicken breast. I wondered if the cinnamon flavor would overwhelm the chili, but it did not, and we all found it tasty. That said, however, one of my kids has a very sensitive sense of smell, and it was really disconcerting to him to eat soup that had a cinnamon scent, which is a smell he normally associates with dessert or sweets. For that reason, I may not make this particular chili again, even though the taste was good.

I reduced the broth to 2 cups based on other reviews and I also rinsed the beans. It was too soupy in my opinion to be chili. Perhaps because I rinsed the beans it didnt have the starch to thicken it. Flavor was great though! Next time I'll try with 2 cups broth and not drain the beans.

I wanted something that tasted very similar or identical to Whole Foods white bean turkey chili. This tastes very close, and as good. I strain the canned beans and i used a lot less chicken broth than called for. I did not add cinnamon. I added salt, and I increased the dry seasonings a bit more than the recipe called for.

This is SOOO good!! I pretty much followed the recipe, I eyeballed the spices and used basil and thyme instead of oregano because I didn’t have it. The reviews are correct reducing the amount of chicken broth- I actually used just over 1 cup of chicken broth because I like my chili thicker and more creamy rather than soupy. Will definitely be adding this to our regular menu!

I slow cooked in stove top for 4 hrs on low heat rather faster and added diced zucchini, mushrooms and substituted fresh shredded Parmesan cheese . It was absolutely incredible! Also added pepper flakes to add heat especially on a cold winter day.

Made this two times already and it was amazing both times. Used all organic ingredients and goat cheese instead of Parmesan. So quick and easy to make and so many wonderful flavors! I prefer beef based (Cincinnati) chili so I was skeptical and a bit hesitant to make turkey chili. I’m so glad I took the chance!

Followed recipe closely, with only exception being I subbed chopped turkey breast for ground turkey.  It was definitely a different flavor, but not sure I would make it again.  If I did, I would reduce the cinnamon by at least half.

Very good recipe.  I usually buy McCormick white chili seasoning package- even buy extra to have on hand. However- when this one came in my email- I had to try it.  I always go over the reviews first. Looking at the recipe,  it was going to be a lot so here are my changes.  I halved all the ingredients- except the Turkey.  1 lb.  2 cans beans- 1 full can in the pot,  1 drained can to blend--Used some of the liquid from the (knorrs's chicken flavor bouillon)  2 1/2 cups ....    measurements of spices 1.5 tsp. & 1/4 tsp of cinnamon- used suggestions of reducing to half.  No more McCormick!   &  topped with chopped cilantro a plus!

Excellent chili. I used 1/4 tsp of cayenne and only used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. A whole tsp would have been too much for my taste.

This is a winning white chili.  I eliminated the white pepper  and reduced the cumin to ½ tablespoon and was really glad I did.  The balance was perfect.   Just enough kick without overpowering the flavors.  Will keep this one on my go to list.

Very tasty!  Be sure not to use more cinnamon than called for because while it's an interesting addition, it could overpower.  Also note that this is NOT a creamy thick broth, but that's just fine wth me :D.  I also added large chopped raw pieces of lactino kale after it was simmering.  Nice color addition and sooooo good for you.  Almost forgot -- I used 1 pound of organic lean turkey and 1/2 pound of chicken breast -- boiled the chicken for about 10 minutes and added it after turkey was cooked up.  Then it had time to cook rest of way while simmering for an hour or so.

I made this with veggie sausage, and it worked perfectly!  When cooking the log of veggie sausage, I threw some veggie stock in which helped break it up and made sure it didn't burn.  Then added the rest of the stock.

Fantastic! Made the with diced turkey breast and fresh hatch green chili (5oz) and it was spectacular. Less soup stock or more blended beans are need or it will be too liquid.

Is amazing for Huevos Rancheros!

I was looking for a healthy but tasty recipe to use some extra lean ground turkey (my first time cooking with it). I followed the recipe almost exactly but had to modified a little as I only had 1 lb. of meat, two cans of the white kidney beans and one can of the chilies. So I eliminated the step of processing one of the cans of beans (I drained and rinse the beans) and reduced the remaining ingredients as necessary and used approx. 3 small jalapeño peppers (diced small) to make up for the chilies. I took another reviewers advice and let everything simmer for approx. an hour (lid on) then took the lid off and let it continue to simmer and thicken up (approx. 30-40 min.) Doing this gave me a thicker chili consistency (not soupy at all) and the next day it was even thicker.  I did reduce the amount of cinnamon I used but really like the flavour it added, wouldn't be the same without it I think. Overall I was very happy with this recipe and will definitely be making it again, and again.

This was really good.  However, instead of 5 cans of broth, I just put 2 cans because I wanted the thickness of a chili.
Also, I swapped out 2 other different kinds of beans.  1 Chick peas & 1 White Chili beans

I agree, it is a great alternative to regular chili. I made a few adjustments. I cut the cinnamon in half, added 3 lbs of ground turkey with 4 cups chicken broth. I also substituted a cup of the Monterrey cheese with a cup of pepper jack. Added a bit more kick. Overall, it was a great hit with family, will be making this again!

Quick and easy. Cinnamon was a nice touch. I used ground chicken and added corn. I also eliminated the cheese and was quite generous with the cayenne pepper.

I will definitely be making this again... every December I host a cookie exchange party with the same 25 ladies, and every December I serve a different soup. So during the remainder of the year I search for the next great soup recipe. So far, (knock on wood) everyone has loved every one of my soups, and I'm absolutely sure that they will love this one too. I will serve it with a tray of  toppings such as cilantro, diced shallots, sliced parmesan cheese, spicy sour cream, garlic bread cubes, and extra spices, as well as thick hot cornbread. They're going to think that they have died and gone to heaven!  Thanks for the ideas. Thought that I would hate the cinnamon when I first smelled the broth, so I only used 1/2 of what the recipe called for, but it was unbelievable.  I  may even increase the amount to 3/4 of what is called for next time. Thanks again...

Delicious white chili but a little too soupy the first time, now I cut the broth in half & just a pinch of cinnamon & everyone loves it. This is a regular in my meal rotations. I love to make a double batch & freeze half for soccer nights.

I made it more of a soup, I call it tortilla soup than a chili. Everyone loves this dish! I use 48oz of chicken broth and a can great northern beans, 2 cans of black beans and a can of corn. Trick is to brown the onions to get better flavor. I also don't add the canned green chile and I do a 1/4 of cinnnamon. Then we add pasta to a bowl then the soup and then corn chips, green chilis, cheese on top so people can add what they want. We also have done this over rice and its fantastic!

I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot the cheese.  Never missed it!  With a generous tablespoon of sour cream, salsa and chopped cilantro on top it was so delicious I made a second batch the next day.  This time I only had 2 cans of beans so I omitted the 3rd can of beans and the blending process.  I lightened up on the cinnamon in this batch but kept the other spice amounts the same.  This is the version I will use for a summer lunch dish with a green salad.  So light and satisfying.  For the light version I only used 1 - 14.5 oz  can of chicken broth.

Slight changes.  I don't care for spicy too much so only used one can of chilies.   Added some colored bell peppers instead.   This recipe was the best I have used in forever!  Hubby loved it too so will definitely make again soon!

Wow this was extremely easy to make and very filling and yummy! Perfect quick week night dinner. Especially when paired with corn bread muffins. The only changes I made were using 1 pound of ground turkey instead of 1 1/2, but kept the rest of the measurments of seasoning and etc the same. There was still enough meat in there to enjoy. I also used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of 5. I put all ingredients in as directed except for the monterey cheese,  letting the chili boil first and then turned the heat down and let it simmer for 30 min. Once simmering was complete i mixed in the cheese and let it sit for a few minutes. Served it in a bowl with sliced avocado and topped it with cheese. Soooooo Good!!

Ground turkey is already so bland, it doesn't need the help of this recipe. Even after adding extra seasoning, it wasn't good. My husband would not eat it; won't make it again.

This is delicious! I only made 2 changes. I didn't have green chillies, so I used green enchilada sauce. I also added some finely chopped carrots for extra veggies. The flavors are phenomenal!

This was very tasty!  I mashed one can of beans to thicken it like the recipe stated, and followed the recipe almost perfectly (only adding 4 cups of broth instead of 5).  I also added some red pepper flakes (perhaps a few too many ...as it made it a bit spicy).  Because of this, I added a couple tablespoons of cream cheese w/chives to cut the spice, and that was a nice addition to the chili.  We enjoyed crumbled tortilla chips on top!  enjoy!  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! And super easy. Perfect for a healthy, weeknight meal. Topped with some cilantro which gave it a fresh flavor. Added some olive oil at the end of cooking for richness and paired with crusty bread. Will definitely make again! Even my anti-anything-healthy husband liked it lol :)

This was wonderful and filling! I didn't have a food processor, so I just added 3 cans of the beans. I would stick to 2 cups of chicken broth only! I added a very VERY tiny amount of ground cinnamon because it does over power the chili.  DO NOT Drain any liquid from the cans of beans! I added cheddar cheese as I was mixing the chili and top it off with mozzarella or cheddar whichever you prefer! I didn't have white pepper, so I just used what I had which was black pepper. I also added 2lb ground turkey. Trust me follow this and it was AMAZING!!!

This recipe was delicious!  I halved the recipe because it was just for two people.  I only had one 19 oz. can of cannellini beans so I thickened the chili with some corn starch and a little water which worked well.  I substituted Mexican blend shredded cheese because I find Monterey Jack cheese to be bland.  When I make it again (which I will), I'll have the correct amount of beans and also will add some frozen corn.

Made no changes and we will definitely make it again.  We were very surprised that such a light colored Chili would taste so awesome.  We always used traditional kidney beans and ground beef.  What a delightful surprise as we try getting into healthier dinner alternatives.

The cinnamon gives it an interesting flavor, which if you eat a lot of ground turkey, is welcomed.  Way too much chicken broth.  Three cups probably would work.  Since I didn't have any cheese but provolone, I melted a slice on top of a serving bowl and it was good.  I had a can of green chilies in tomato, which worked just fine.  All the improvising was out of necessity since I had no idea what i was going to make for dinner, and it all worked out.

I make chili every week and freeze it in serving size containers to help me stay on my diet.  I have been searching for a white turkey chili as an alternate to my other favorite, Simple Turkey Chili (also on allrecipes).  

This white turkey chili is by far the best I have found -- I'm not looking anymore.  This is a fantastic recipe.  I use 100% ground white meat turkey.  I estimate the calories at 250 (no cheese)  for 1.8 cups (my serving size) -- that works.  It's as good, maybe even better, after freezing.

Excellent!  Even my chili-averse spouse loved it! Followed the recipe fairly closely ingredient-wise except that I varied the beans used - pinto, great northern, and cannellini.  Will use this one again and again.

This was delicious! Made ALMOST to the letter. Added some carrots for color and only two cans of beans. I also chopped up some fresh cilantro to sprinkle on top with the jack cheese. If I would've ordered this in a restaurant, I'd have gone back for more. Just excellent!

The chili was very bland and too watery.  I used a low sodium chicken both and would not recommend 5 cups of broth.  1 can of chicken broth is plenty, but be sure to add in 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt for any hope for flavor.

I made this recipe to use up some Thanksgiving Turkey leftovers. Saute onion and fresh garlic with oregano add sliced turkey last and substituted great northern white beans. I doubled up on the seasonings and added  4 oz or so of roasted chilies with the canned chilis.

This is easy to make and delicious! However, it was too thin for my tastes. I added 3 small potatoes diced fine, and 1 cup of frozen corn. Next time I'd add less chicken broth, probably 4 cups instead of 5. Well worth making again, though!

Came out great, but I followed the suggestions of several others to reduce the cinnamon (to about 1/2 what the recipe called for) and reduce the amount of liquid. Broth was home made turkey broth from Thanksgiving.

This is my first introduction to white chili. LOVED IT. Great recipe. I made it w chicken instead of turkey and used some hatch green chilis from my freezer. I also cut the cheese quantity in half. Really really good. Don’t eliminate the cinnamon from this dish, it really works well. Super easy to make.

I made this recipe exactly as written. I found it to be a little bland, and I didn't like the added cheese as a thickening agent. All it did was re-form as it cooled into a sticky mess on my spoon, the bowl, and the back of my teeth. It was really soupy with 5 cups of broth. Next time, I'll modify it by adding creme fraice or sour cream, tomatillo salsa, and by using less broth and no cheese (except as an individual addition in the side).

Very nice, I did not add all the cinnamon at once I added about half a teaspoon at first  and that was all it needed other wise I had a bowl on the side and added a little more and it tasted too much like cinnamon and made the rest of the flavors get lost. But overall great and different  : )

The recipe as it appeared in the magazine is a little different from the one on the web site.  The magazine calls for 4 cups of  broth and does not say to puree one can of beans which would help to thicken the chili.  I simmered the pot for about an hour to reduce liquid and then added the cheese.  The verdict is still out on this dish as my family has not tasted it yet.  I like it but think it will be better served over brown rice.

Loved this recipe.  Very tasty and full of flavor.  I will definitely make this when I'm looking for a turkey chili in the future.

I have made this several times and  follow the instructions mostly. It is Great. Sometimes I do not add the cheese, but let people put their own cheese on after they have it in the bowl.

I made minor additions but it came out great.  I used the Allrecipies  magazine recipe which had a slightly different  amount of ingredients, but it still turned out great.  Will be keeping  in my favorites folder.

Huge winner with my family.  Spicey enough for my husband, mild enough for my kids --- when accompanied with cheese topping and a glass of milk.

I would give this 4.5 stars. I 100% followed the recipe in the Allrecipes magazine that called for 4C versus 5C of broth (magazine versus online). The rest of the recipe is the same in both publications. I thought the spices and the green chili's produced a fantastic flavor to go with the turkey. Very flavorful but not overwhelming. The recipe is still very brothy using 4 cups. But you can easily ladle off 3-4 large spoon fulls of broth. Once ladled in bowls, I topped it with diced avocado, and a little cheese and sour cream. Used organic turkey. Will make a again, and again. Much healthier than red meat chili.

I made this last night & will not make again. I don't know how it gets the high ratings. I only used 4 cups of broth & it was still soupy.  Ground turkey just didn't appeal in this recipe, I will stick to shredded chicken in my white chili from now on & adding cheese to the mixture just made a gloppy mess on the bottom of my pot.  A waste of expensive ingredients.

Yum!  I just made this and am so happy I did.  I read the other reviews first. as always and used 4 cups of chicken STOCK as I didn't have broth. ( About 1 of the 4 cups was used with the 1 can of beans in the blender for easier pureeing.)  I used about a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon.  To help the liquid absorb, I let the whole mixture boil, uncovered, for a half hour.  At the end I used an immersion blender to help thicken the consistency.  Make sure not to puree it too much; you can leave some of the beans intact.  I love the slight taste of cinnamon.  I only had one can of green chiles so I added a bit more cayenne for kick.  Perfect!

Excellent! I did reduce down the chicken broth by a lot & I didn't purée any of the beans. I meant to reduce the cinnamon, but accidentally put extra in! It was great!

It was an easy recipe to make. I wanted the chili to be creamy instead of soupy, so I used 2 cups of broth instead of 5. Other than that , I followed the recipe and it turned out great!

This was perfect for a chilly spring dinner.  I cooked a whole turkey yesterday and ground the meat myself.  I skipped the cinnamon and added 2 tsp more cumin and 1/2 TBSP of cayenne.  I also used almond cheese.  I only used 3 cups of chicken broth. Two cups no sodium and one cup with sodium.  I like a thicker stew.  It was pretty salty in spite of no sodium in 2/3 of the broth.  Definitely making this again!!  YUM.

My husband loved it!  I did cut back a little on the cinnamon, but it does add a great, complex flavor, so don't skip it unless you just hate cinnamon.  Cut back a tad on broth and cheese as well and just added cheese on top in bowls.  Served with a dollop of sour cream.  YUM!  Will make again!

delicious!  I used half the  cinnamon, did not blend the beans, and only used half of the chicken broth.   I did not have white pepper but added regular black pepper.  I had some hatch peppers so I used them.  My boyfriend with extremely posh taste loved it as did I.  I will be making it again

It's a good chili. We served it with cornbread. And I rinsed my beans to keep the sodium down a little for my husbands special diet. I just added a little water to puree the beans. I also added a little extra cumin, pepper and salt substitute. Also only used # cups broth like others suggested.

This is awesome!...I followed my fellow cooks advice and only used a half tsp.,of cinnamon. I also added corn which added a nice sweet taste in every bite. I then added a half tsp., of red peppers for an added zing.

This was very tasty I loved the different flavors...family and friends loooved it.   Definitely a keeper!

Excellent flavor, great recipe! My only adjustment was  to use 4 cups (one 32 oz. box) v. 5 cups of broth which I think also helped reduce some simmer time. The cinnamon was a great addition and really adds to the unique flavor even if you like to add additional cayenne pepper to your taste like my wife and I. I will definitely add this among my top soups/recipes and plan to make this many times more in the future. Thanks for the recipe.

Recipe doesn't specify whether to drain beans and chillis.  Guidelines for the cayenne would've been helpful, mine got too hot. Not sure why but my soup was gray not white.  Not appetizing.

I first made this chili recipe about four years ago and it's still a crowd favorite and regular meal in my household. It's become my favorite go-to chili recipe as soon as the weather starts to turn! I don't modify it much, the only modifications are: I like to let it simmer in my slow cooker all afternoon, I add a can of corn (drained and rinsed) about 15 minutes before serving, and I hold the cheese to top with right before eating. 

For those ambivalent about the cinnamon: I go all in on the cinnamon as it's written here and I never regret it. I was also skeptical but I've long since been converted. Give it a try if you're not sure!

This was easy and good.  I didn't use as much cinnamon b/c a little goes a long way.  I also used 2 cans Great Northern beans in place of all 3 being the same. Update: I've made this several times now with good results.  The last time I made it I added corn and even threw in some shredded carrot for color and more bulk. Pretty quick and easy to throw together on a week night.

Great recipe to switch up having regular beef chili. Really flavorful. I was alittle unsure about the cinnamon but it really makes it taste great. Recommend it.

Delicious! Sautéed the turkey w/ chopped onion and garlic; only used 2 cans canelli beans (1 mashed-did not add cheese during cooking-used as topper); 1 tsp Cinnamon was perfect! Used 1 can (10oz) Rotel diced tomatoes w/green chiles instead of 2 cans green chiles-just the right amount of kick for us) threw in some chopped homegrown tomatoes from the freezer;  Will definitely make a again!

This is a popular cold winter dish in our house.  Easy to make, good use for ground turkey.  Commonly have the ingredients needed in our pantry.  Have made several times, it’s a winner.

I followed just suggestions on some of the reviews. I used 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth, reduced the  cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon,  I was not for sure how much red Cayenne pepper to use so I used 1/4 of a teaspoon. I added salt at the end because it was a little bland for my taste. But otherwise it's a great dish!  And I make Jiffy cornbread muffins to go with it!

Followed the recipe except instead of ground turkey I used left over turkey breast and shredded it.  I wouldn't call it a chili since it wasn't that thick but I loved it!  Very easy.  Would make again.

This chili was a hit with my entire family, including the baby!  Usually when I make traditional 'red' chili the only ones who really enjoy it are my husband and I.   This recipe however pleased everyone including my skeptical husband, and ultra picky oldest son.   I served this over a little bit of left over white rice for the children which added some bulk since this is a runny chili.   Next time I make this I might puree two cans of beans and have two whole, for a total of four cans.   The only ingredients that I left out were cinnamon ( I wasn't sure about that) and cayenne since I didn't want it too hot for the kids.  The only addition that I made was to saute about a half of a green bell pepper with the onions and garlic.  I figured that it would add some flavor and a little color.  I will definitely make this again.  My picky son who otherwise hates beans gave this recipe a very high complement, "this chili is actually pretty good."  That is about as good as it gets!

My pet peeve with internet recipes is that they do not turn out as expected. The flavouring on this chili is excellent, but 5 cups of stock leave it like soup, instead of a thick chili. 3 cups of stock vs 5 in the recipe and 1 more can of beans would make it much thicker.

I do like the unusual flavoring of this chili. I loved this recipe when a friend made it. She substituted adobo chilis for the green chilis, and I think I liked it better that way. Like others, I think the cinnamon is very powerful for my taste, and there is too much broth. I would make it again, though, trying the adobos instead, reducing the cinnamon, and using only 1 can of chicken broth.

This was amazing! It was so easy and quick. I did skip the 2 cups of shredded cheese and opted to just sprinkle some in my bowl at serving to lessen the calorie intake. Bookmarked this one for next time!

I agree with a previous post. 5 cups of broth is too many and double the cumin. its spicy but the flavor is good. I used 1 can of black beans and 2 Cannellini, the black beans added flavor. i wouldn't make it w/out black beans.

I only made half a batch, just 2 of us.  I used turkey stock, I had made from our leftover thanksgiving turkey carcass.  I also used 2 cups, cooked shredded turkey, added corn,  1 can of cannellini beans and one can of white chili beans,  along with the rest of the ingredients.   It came out delish!  My husband, who is not a big turkey fan , loved it.

Wish I could give 4 1/2 stars! Super yum! Great base flavor, did after a bit based on personal preferences and that resulted in the best white chili I've ever had:

I made it as shown and added some chicken cubes for texture. If I make again, I won't purée the one can of beans and I wont add the cheese in. I'd put the cheese on top. I think it makes iti a little to thick and heavy for our taste.  probably won't make again.

This is the chili that won me my first cooking contest!
I change it slightly, by sautéing the onions and garlic with a can of SPAM (diced and smashed slightly), a ratio of 2:1 turkey and ground pork, a can of good beer in place of some of the broth, and a can or two of hominy along with the beans.  I like my chili thick, so I cut back on the liquid by a third or so. Sometimes I throw a ham bone or smoked hock in there if I have one.
I let this chili cook a long time, and add the last couple cans of beans about 20 minutes before I think it's done.
The great thing about chili is the amount you can tweak the recipe!

Great recipe, and I think one you can tweak to fit how you like it. I didn't use any cumin (but did add a package of white chili mix to it) and used small white beans. I also used about 3-4 cups of broth, as I like my chili with less liquid. I've made this twice now - once with only small white beans and the second time with small white beans and black beans (rinsed them both times.) Thanks so much for this quick and easy recipe.

Giving this a 5 Star because with slight modifications of my own, it was absolutely AMAZING! I used a fresh jalapeño instead of canned chilis, only 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, a can of tomatillos, and added a tablespoon of coriander. I also only used 3 cups of liquid, 1 cup being a light beer! This was a great recipe to use for basic guidelines, but I wouldn't use it exact.

This is great! As recommended by other reviewers I used only 1/2 t cinnamon, and only 2 c broth. I also used 7 oz green chiles and 1.25 # turkey because that's how they come packaged. Also cooked my own Cannellini beans so used just over 5 cups to approximate 3 cans. Followed another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the onions, garlic and turkey in a tablespoon oil and then threw it all in the slow cooker for about 5 hours on low. I didn't add the cheese to mine to keep calories lower, and it was still fantastic! I did add cilantro. Made as described above it makes six servings around 310 calories each.

I'll admit that when I was first browning the ground turkey and onions together I didn't have high hopes.  But the dish turned out pretty delicious!  I made as is for the most part - I reduced the cinnamon to about half a teaspoon and used Palmetto Brewery Ghost Rider Beer for one of the 2 cups of liquid I added (5 cups definitely would have been too much liquid for a thick chili - the way I like it).  I topped the chili with a dollop of sour cream, slices of avocado, chopped cilantro, and squeezed lime over the whole thing.  It was bright and delicious!  We will make this again.

I've been making this recipe for years.  I add extra cayenne pepper and white pepper but omit the cinnamon due to family preferences.   I like to brown and drain the ground turkey, then add the onions until translucent.  Then I freeze this so it cuts prep time when I am busy.

This is one of my go-to recipes. Everyone I have made it for has loved it. I try a little bit of a twist on it every time I make it. I usually add less chicken broth than the recipe says so it comes out a bit thicker. Don't be afraid to experiment with different types of cheeses and vary the amounts of the spices depending on what you like best. This is such a solid recipe that you can't go wrong!

I made it and loved it, then I saw that I missed adding the cinnamon, it sounded cool so I added it. I was disappointed. The cinnamon taste just muted all of the awesome flavors that were there before. I loved it before but the cinnamimon was a big no for me. I have regrets. Anyway, I won't be mentioning it to my husband.  I'll see if I can get away with it.

Love this recipe and have made it many times. I've made a few changes:  Two cans of beans with liquid. No chicken broth. A bit more cumin, but no cinnamon.  I sometimes add chicken bullion for the salt.  I usually serve it with green onion, cilantro, chopped tomato, jalapenos, sour cream and shredded cheese.  It's one of my family's favorite recipes! Thanks for sharing it!

This is a first-rate, very healthy chili. I loved it. I did make some changes. The three primary changes where that I used fresh green chili since it's in season; I also used Great Northern beans instead of the cannellini beans; and finally, I ran short of the Monterey Jack cheese and so I substituted some cream cheese - about 4 ounces. I absolutely loved it and I will absolutely make it again. Thank you for a great idea!

This was the best chili ever! It was my first time making white chili so I had no idea how good it would taste. What others has said is right--the combination of seasonings is what sets this recipe apart. I also used black beans and corn along with cannelini beans and I think I will do it again. Ours turned our spicy being that I put a lot of cayenne pepper and we put a lot of cinnamon as well that gave it a fun enchanting aroma! My one tip would be not to add the cheese while simmering. I was hesitant to do it but followed the recipe and it all sank to the bottom and burned, wasting all the cheese and making the pot hard to clean off. Adding the cheese after serving is a fine way to enjoy it.

Was good but needed some zing. I switched the 3rd, pureed can of cannellini beans for refried beans for variety. I used only 3 cans of chicken broth so it wouldn't be too watery. Also added about a cup of corn and 1/4 cup of lime. Garnished it with avocado, jalapeno peppers, Mexican blend cheese and tiny tortilla strips.  Delicioso!!

Made this recipe for the family and I made a few adjustments. I cut the broth down to 3 cups and added two cups of drained corn. I simmered the chili for an hour because it wouldn't thicken. I added corn starch and it did eventually. I used chicken instead of ground turkey and that tasted alot better. I'm giving this 3 stars because the cinnamon overpowered the whole pot. it was too sweet. I'll make this again without the cinnamon.

Best White Turkey Chili recipe I've tried. Added corn. Halved the cumin and only 1/8 teaspoon cayenne so not too spicy. Topped with sour cream and cilantro. Family votes this is a keeper!

I closely followed the recipe, except I reduced the broth to 2 cups because I rinsed the beans. It was still a little soupy for our taste, but very delicious!! (We love thick and hearty!) I used 1/2 tsp pepper and 1/2 tsp cayenne. Very spicy , but not too hot. My husband loved it!

This was a good recipe, I am making for the second time tonight. I did reduce the broth to 3 cups and cinnamon in half. This time I will reduce the broth to 1 1/2-2 cups because 3 was too watery. I am also going increase the cayenne, this chili just needs a little bit more of a kick for us. But other than that it was delish!

Either drain the beans or use a lot less chicken stock. I doubled the recipe and used only 4 cups stock and it was still thin, so I thickened it with potato starch. Even so, this chili got compliments and recipe requests at a teacher appreciation lunch.

Fantastic!!! The only changes that I made were to reduce the chicken stock to 3 1/2 cups and let it simmer for 30 minutes. This made it less soupy and more chili-like. I also only put half of the cheese into the chili to cook. I served the remaining cup on top as a garnish. Delicious!!!

This is great. We are looking for new recipes all the time, and I made this one tonight was fantastic. I changed the serving to 13 cause there a lot of us and to have left overa it was great. I reduced the liquid about 2less cups then it called for added more seasoning to taste and was fantastic. Definitely a keeper

I'm a Southern girl, but had this in WA state at my daughter's house. It's only the best chili I've ever had! 

My son-in-law said he uses 3x's the amount of cinnamon called for. Seriously, I've never had better chili. Oh, and normally, ground turkey disgusts me; but, not in this recipe!

I made some changes based on necessity!  Like potatoes for beans (because I had no beans), no cumin or cheese (again, because I had none!) and I cut the cinnamon in half (just to try - I figure you can always add more....), my ground turkey had rosemary (pre-seasoned from the store) and I used Mrs. Renfroe's Green Salsa instead of the chilies because that's what I had on hand....
Anyway, final result......wonderful!  I've never had "white" chili, and I loved this! It was even better after an hour in the fridge (I went back for just a little taste!) I loved the hint of cinnamon and am glad I cut it in half.  I plan on making again with the beans, etc. just for the fun of it, but tonight's concoction will stay in my rotation!

This chili not only tasted amazing, but it was very easy to make gluten free.  My only changes were: using only one can of green chilies and adding a yellow bell pepper (I'm a light weight when it comes to spicy stuff), and I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to make it a bit thicker.  Great recipe.  I will most definitely make it again.

Wow1  I really like this.  The cinnamon makes me think of Cincinnati chili.  My daughter loves that served over spaghetti noodles.  I used three small onions and 2 garlic gloves.  Didn't have the right beans so I used one can of drained northern beans and creamed a can of chickpeas.  I love the idea of creaming the beans!!!  For spices I also added a little paprika and chili powder with the other spices.  I added some mushrooms with the onions.  I cooked the onions, mushrooms, and garlic in one pan and the turkey in another.  I drained the turkey grease and added the turkey  to the onion mixture.  I also threw in some corn as others did.  Going to serve it as soon as my husband gets home.  I have sour cream and white shredded cheddar cheese waiting.  I didn't measure the broth, but I have been waiting so long that it has cooked way down.

I've made this recipe so many times, it's the only chili I make and I can't stand chili so that says a lot (seriously I've been making this for over 7 years!).  First I was afraid of the cinnamon part and refused to put the full amount in, but let me tell you it's a must!  When I rate a recipe it is based off the actual recipe NOT me changing it.  As a personal preference, and after making this a million times,  I do omit one can of beans since I am not a huge bean fan and add 2 lbs of turkey since I love ground turkey.

This is must to try at least once! Oh, and it won in a chili cook off :)

I just made this for the first time and it's delicious! I doubled the recipe, didn't use all the stock, as others have mentioned, used half the green chiles and 1 tsp of cayenne, bumped up the cumin and added kosher salt. I also let it simmer for over 2hrs to infuse more flavor. Perfection! Just waiting for the cornbread to come out of the oven and then I'm diving in!

I wanted less beans used only one can of them, rinsed and drained. I substituted 2 cups of roasted cauliflower for the rest of the beans. I took one of the cups of chicken broth, half the beans, and 1 cup of the cauliflower put them in the blender, then added it to the other ingredients. I also added one fresh, diced jalepeno pepper to add more kick. My husband likes to add Tapitio, a hot chili sauce, for even more fire.  So delicious, I must say! ;D

the cinnamon was too weird for me.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written, but the cinnamon was too strange of a flavor with the other ingredients.

I had a White Chicken Chili packet by McCormick that I used in conjunction to the cayenne & cinnamon. I also did not use the canned chilies but I had some fresh jalapenos that chopped with the garlic and onion. I added some fresh chopped Italian parsley and cilantro to the bean mixture. It tastes so good!!!

I changed it up a bit by, seasoning the turkey with cumin and cayenne, instead of canned chilies I added fresh chopped jalepenos, and drained corn before I added the cheese.

This recipe is so good and even my picky 7 year old and 2 year old ate it!!!  The only change I made was I added the cheese as a garnish at the end in each bowl along with diced avocado.  I was surprised to see the cinnamon as an ingredient and surprisingly enough loved it's contribution to the chili!  Great, Easy, healthy recipe!

love this chili! The flavors work very well together. I would cut down on the spices. My batch turned out pretty hot. I did not add the cinnamon(thought it was taste funny).

Calls for too much chicken broth. Had to cook it down for 1 1/2 hours. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before trying it. My husband and daughter thought I messed up the recipe because it was too soupy but I followed it exactly. Not enough spices...

This was good, but I wish it was thicker. The broth seemed way too much. I would try it again, maybe cutting the broth in half and pureeing two of the cans of beans to thicken it up. Flavor was good though!

Great alternative to traditional red chili.  I used low sodium chicken broth.  I added frozen corn at the end and served with sour cream & cilantro.

This was my first chili and I took a few liberties here and there. I added jalapeno salsa and a can of beer. It had the consistency of soup so the next time I'll use a thickener. Looks like I'll be entering the company chili cookoff this winter.

A 1 lb bag of dried beans yields 34 oz but just over 3 "cans" worth of beans in volume.  I only had a 1 lb package of ground turkey so I threw in a can of mixed chili beans (which is why I had an empty can to measure the white beans) to make up the difference in volume.  I used 4 c of low sodium chicken stock, 1/2 t of cinnamon and 1/8 t each of the white pepper and cayenne.  I also drained the canned chilis for fear of having too much liquid as others complained.

Fantastic, my husband is a traditional chili lover so I wasn't if he would like this...he loved it. My daughter in the other hand was not a huge fan. Although it's been awhile since I have made this and her taste buds seemed to have matured a bit. Think I will give it a go again this month now that the weather has dropped.

We really liked this White Chili.  I didn't have green chilis or the cheese, so left them out, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Its a good, easy, lowfat recipe.  I'm sure I'll be making it again.

This is so good! I chose this recipe over the others since it said picky eaters would like it and the middle child loved it! This one is a winner and we will certainly be making it again! I followed the recipe and served it with avocado, shredded monterey jack cheese and sour cream. Highly recommend!

This was pretty good and my 4 little guys and one big guy ate it with no complaint... However I added corn, and if I make it again I will use a lot less broth. I like my chili like chili not soup... It was good though...

Very disappointed with this recipe. As others have noted, using 5 cups of broth makes it way too soupy. It is also too heavy on the cinnamon. I like cinnamon in savory dishes, but I would reduce it by at least half.  In order to make this edible, I plan to doctor it up by adding tomatoes, chili powder, and possibly more beans. Of course, it won't be a white chili anymore.

I used half the chicken stock but otherwise followed the recipe and it was great! The cinnamon really added a nice flavor.

Great on the quick prep side.  I think that next time I might leave out the cinnamon as it left tasting a little too sweet. I also would suggest preparing the onions and garlic first, a sauté, then add the turkey.

Excellent recipe, for sure.  Only used about 4 cups of broth and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Served with cornbread.  Tasty!

Better than tomato chili! We make it OFTEN. We reduce the broth and cinnamon to half per the suggestions and use about ten fresh diced jalapenos instead of canned chilies. We double the recipe and eat left-overs for days at a time. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!

We followed the recipe to the letter and while it smelled great as it was cooking, it was bad, so very bad. It's more like turkey bean soup than chili.

This is a keeper!  I followed the recipe as much as I ever do...I kept pretty close to this one, esp with the spices, just cutting the cinnamon in half.  It was delicious.  I was able to use fresh New Mexico green chiles too, which made it even better, but it would still be great with canned.

My family absolutely LOVES this chili!!! Although I don't follow the recipe to the T, it comes out just as good. I eliminate the green chilies, and only add a pinch of cinnamon. I also experiment with different white cheeses. I tried the Italian blend by Kraft recently and oh my goodness it was heaven on a spoon. I deem this chili recipe the ultimate cold weather comfort food.

Great soup!  Definitely add cinnamon (1/2 of what the recipe calls for) just so you can try it...adds a lot of flavor and surprisingly, very tasty.  I followed recipe almost exactly except for 1/2 of the cinnamon and less chicken broth.  Its a keeper!

Great recipe! Was looking for a change from tomato based chili and this fit the bill.  Followed the recipe except I reduced the amount of broth to 3 cups but will reduce it further next time for a thicker chili.  I also did not stir in the cheese but served it on the side along with sour cream. The cinnamon added subtle warmth...may increase it next time and add a little more cayenne for more kick.  Definitely will me making this again...maybe in the crockpot next time.

I really liked this recipe. I did reduce the cinnamon to 1/4 of a teaspoon, didn't include the canned chilies because I didn't have any and I used mozzarella because I didn't have any monterey jack.  I also put two cans of the beans in the blender and would do all three next time my kids don't like the look of beans but don't mind the taste.  My family really liked mixing salsa with it.

The flavor of this recipe is great.  I would however say that 5 cups of broth is WAY too much.  I will try adding it cup by cup next time to my desired thickness as others have suggested.  The cinnamon and spice amount was unique and perfectly balanced (I did add salt to taste at the end).  I used organic ground beef instead of the turkey which I feel complimented the cinnamon flavor nicely.  It was also more rich and I did use all 2 cups of the cheese.  We are topping with diced tomatoes, diced avocados, sour cream, cilantro, and tortilla chips. I will make this again!

I've been an avid AllRecipes follower and supporting member for over a year now without writing a review. This recipe is making me change all that. It's simply phenomenal. I wasn't sure how I would like the cinnamon in a chili, but it adds such a unique and delicious flavor. I probably did 1/2 to 3/4 tsp of it instead of the full tsp, and it was amazing!  Definitely worth a try, even for the skeptics out there.

I did some modifications to this recipe.  I don't eat turkey, so I used 1 pound of ground chicken meat instead.  I am also very conscience of salt, so I used two cups of water instead of the chicken broth.  I did not use the cinnamon, I only used two cans of rinsed white kidney beans and I did not puree a third can of beans.  After simmering for 15 minutes, the water cooked out and the chili became thick and when I served it I used Colby Jack cheese and sour cream for garnishes.  This could have been a filling for a burrito, since it was thick.

I followed the recipe, with the exception of adding less than 5 cups of broth.  Even with just 2 cups,this turned out more like soup than what I think of as chili.  The flavor was wonderful.  I love the addition of cinnamon and green chiles - a combo I never would have thought of.

This is so quick, easy & delicious.  I substituted a broasted chicken for the turkey to make it even easier.  I will cut some of the water the next time, though.

This has become a go to easy meal in our house.  It is a bit soupy so depending on my mood I may reduce the amount of broth or simply increase the amount of turkey and/or beans.  I also puree the onions due to the kids picking them out otherwise, and I adjust the cinnamon to taste.  I love that this chili can be enjoyed year round because it is so much lighter than the traditional beef and beans version.

I made a few minor substitutions: omitted cinnamon, and white pepper, used mix of navy and garbanzo beans, used fresh oregano instead of dried, and added 2 habaneros cause we like a kick. It is a yummy dish. Even my husband gave it a 2 thumbs up!

This was a great chili - spice it up as you liked it.  I did it very mild for my young kids.  It looks kind of bland in color but tastes very good.  Was a change from the typical tomato based chili.

This is the easiest and healthiest white chile that tastes great!! My whole family loves it. I do use less chicken broth, less cinnamon and don't put the cheese in the pan, put it on top of your bowl of chile. YUMMY!!

Love this recipe but am on Weight Watchers and wondering if it's really 10 points for 1 cup?  Maybe I could use fat free cheese instead.  It seems like such healthy ingredients!!

This recipe is a staple now for me.  I add vegetables (carrots, corn, celery) and then about half the amount of ground turkey.  Also use only about 2 cups of broth as I prefer a really thick chili.  This recipe and flavors are amazing and a huge hit with my friends and family!

This recipe was very good. I used 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers. The cinnamon taste was still too strong, in my opinion. Next time I make this recipe, I will cut back on the cinnamon even more. I only added 1.5 cups of cheese to chili during cooking. I garnished each bowl with a few pinches of cheese and green chilies. This dish was a bit spicy from the green chilies. If your family can't handle spicy....cut back on the green chilies. My five yr old son loves jalepenos and made a comment that this dish was hot to him. I served this chili with cornbread muffins which ended up working out fine together.

Delicious. The second time I left out the cinnamon and used vegetable broth instead, and it was still great. Definitely a keeper.

I have been making this recipe for a few fall/winters now, and its a definite fave. The cinnamon gives it such an interesting taste that you don't want to stop eating (but I do halve the cinnamon). One thing I do that's not in the recipe is whisk in a big scoop of sour cream at the end of cooking, then melt in some cheddar cheese. It gives it incredible richness....so tasty!

This was great! I was glad I checked some of the other reviews and made some changes right from the start. 
(1) I used 3 cups of broth but next time will only use 2, it still came out a bit watery (2) didn't have cumin, so I used chili powered instead (3) rinsed the beans and instead of blending 1 can, I mashed it with a fork (4) used 1/2 the amount of cinnamon and next time will use 1/4 because it was still overpowering. This is a super recipe to make on a cold day! Enjoy!

wow this was really good, I did use 1 lb. ground turkey and 1 can of green chile peppers, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 3 cups of broth. We like our chili a little on the thick side so I used some flour and mixed it in some broth and then added it in to thicken it up.

Just the right amount of spice with a hint of sweetness. I love this receipt whether it's same day or leftovers as the flavors really set in on the second day. It's a hearty, feel good meal for the fall and winter months, but I've been known to make it in the summer as well. It's just that good!

I used ground chix and added all ingredients to crockpot on low to let it simmer for a few hours. I had only 2 cans of beans so I added some small macaroni (cooked) and a grilled chicken breast (that was left over from last night-chopped it in sm. bites). De-Licious!

I've made this several times & loved it every time.  I only used 2 cups of broth, as others, & substituted chicken/sausage for 1/2 of the turkey a few times w/good results.  Other than the one substitution, I followed recipe. I rinsed the beans, to hold the sodium down & I think the full amount of cinnamon, is a must.

quite possibly the best chili I've ever made!  I did cut back on the quantity of chicken broth to make it thicker.  And I added black beans and jalapenos...great with home made honey corn bread.

Excellent.  Didn't have ground turkey so used 2 lbs. ground chicken.  I didn't have green chile peppers so used chipotle seasoning. I used 4 cans of beans and mashed them a bit before I put into the soup.  Only used 3 cups of chicken broth as others suggested.  Will definitely make again.

I up'd the spices by 1/3 for extra flavor.  It is a little runny;  I added 1/4 cup cornstarch to thicken.  Serve with tortilla chips.  Healthy and Delicious!

This was a very interesting and delicious take on chili. I made a few modifications: I added two cans of white corn and I only used 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Next time, I may use even less cinnamon. I would definitely recommend this!

This is what i did, i like my chili meaty so i used 2 and 1/2 pounds of ground turkey, i used fresh turkey wings and removed skin and bones and cut it up in bite size piece.  i bought 3 cans of great northern beans. i mashed one can and rinsed and drained the other 2. one half small vadalia onion chopped,  i used 1 can of cream of celery.  i did not measure but i used cumin, oregano and cinnamon. i did not have broth so i made my own with chicken boullin base, i seasoned the ground turkey as it cooked and along with the chicken base no additional salt was needed. i did not have any of the extra spice so mine did not have a kick to it, i browned the ground turkey and cooked the fresh turkey pieces for about an hour and a half then i added beans and onions in the crock pot on low over night.  it was not soupy at all actually i could have added more broth but it was great as is.  i topped it with monteray jack cheese afterwards.  turned out better than i expected my 10, 7, and 3 year olds loved it. will be makeing this again

Good flavor,loved the combination of spices.Being artistic though I found it visually unattractive so I added some chopped red pepper and a can of black beans which improved it.

This is delicious and sure to satisfy both tummy and soul on a cold night.  I used fresh jalapeño peppers ribbed and seeded instead of the canned chilies.  I also added in the juice of a lime and a teaspoon ground corriander.  Topped it off with the usual fixings and served with homemade Mexican style cornbread.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good...I didn't realize about the "Servings" button up top (I'm new to All Recipes), so my Chili was very meaty, HAHA. I loved the spices. Made it very tasty. I wish it wasn't as thin though. I don't know if you can add flour to thicken it like canned chili. Other than that, great recipe!

I made this recipe over the weekend.  Didn't change a thing and absolutely loved it!  I even added the cinnamon which I was on the fence about after reading the reviews, but it added something extra to the recipe.  I would make this again and again just the way it is.  Thank You!

It must have been the cinnamon (and I only used 1/2 tsp) that gave this soup a very strange taste.  Also, I cut the broth to 4 cups per other suggestions, and it was way too soup-like to be considered chili.

I didn't really expect my husband or teen daughter to like this, but both did!  I used alittle less broth, no cinnamon but added curry powder. When I was washing the pan, I realized I had left out the green chili peppers. They may not have went well with the curry anyway, it turned out really good just like it was.  I think maybe the name white chili gives a false impression to some.

I like this chili, but my boyfriend wasn't too pleased. The cinnamon and chilis had an interesting effect on the flavor.

This was so delicious I ate the leftovers for lunch for the next 2 days. I agree with other reviewers that cinnamon needs to be cut in 1/2. I also left out green chilis because I did not have any but I think would add a little kick and I will tey next time. A new favorite at our house

This was an excellent recipe! I'm not a fan of spicy, so I just put in one can of green chile peppers and opted out of the cayenne pepper, it was delicious! My 4 year old said,"I love this, you should make it every day!"

great white chili recipe. i used a little less chicken stock because i like my chili thicker, and i omitted the cinnamon (forgot to add it!).  i did not add the cheese until serving time, garnished with a bit of sour cream.  thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

Followed this recipe exactly and I was very pleased with the results! I mashed up a can of beans with a fork and I think it helped thicken the soup. Oh but I did omit the cheese for less calories and I didn't feel like it needed it! With this recipe I had dinner on the table in 30 minutes. This is my new go-to and I will be making it again and again!

This is a great recipe. I hesitate to give it 5 stars, though - that'd make it among the handful of best chilis ever, in my book. But still, consider this a strong 4-star rating from me. I made it pretty much as written. The green chiles I used were "fire-roasted whole green chilies", which I drained; I used 1 tsp. each of the cayenne and white peppers; I didn't drain the cans of beans; 1 cup of my chicken broth was "reduced sodium" (what I had on hand); and for the cheese I shredded a whole 1-lb. block of Monterey Jack. The pureed can of beans was a new little trick to me, adding a little body to the soup. The taste was great, an interesting combination of spices. The cinnamon was novel, and noticeable, but I did like it. The eight servings lasted me for 4 fairly big meals, and I enjoyed it to the last drop. If I might niggle a bit, the chili was a little soupy for my taste; I prefer thicker chilis. The cooking times and the medium-heat settings, in my case, meant that the broth was hardly reduced at all, and didn't get very hot, temperature-wise. I might turn up the heat and/or increase cooking time, next time. Overall, though, I highly recommend this recipe. (I usually read all previous reviews before posting my own, but this time I'll skip all 379 of them!)

Didn't have any cumin or green chile peppers, but this still turned out nicely! I would def. make it again. The cheese adds a nice texture and creamy flavor. I had to use slices but it worked out fine.

This to me was good but a little bland.  I actually added more spices than called for and let it simmer a little longer, but it just didn't have the oomph I was looking for.  The base flavors were fantastic however.

My husband absolutely loves this chili! I never measure the spices and add as much or as little as we feel we need that day! We put a little butter in ours and eat with rolls. I am going to bring it to my next work party! The cinnamon is the greatest thing about this meal.....

I followed the recipe exactly and it was good, but not five stars good. It had a very Middle Eastern flair and was much improved the next day when combined with rice but it was lacking something. I almost wonder if reducing the amount of chilis to about half would have made this better. There were kind of competing flavors...like it couldn't decide if it was Mexican or an Indian dish, but if you are looking for a easy to make white chili this recipe was pretty good.

cut down on the broth because i don't like soupy chili. i was liberal with the spices (except cinnamon, which i cut down to 1/2 tsp.), and used butter beans because that was all i had. overall, it was pretty good, but needed more of a kick.

It's still cooking and it's great.  I'm notorious for throwing in what I have.  I did add some crushed tomatoes and some garbanzo beans.  I love the smell of this soup.  The cinnamon was a great touch.

Great dish! Very savory with fantastic aroma - I made it for a group of 50 and I used the the recipe calculator which helped so much.

Yum!  I didn't have green chiles so I used about half a can of diced jalapenos...worked great!  I followed other advice and only added about three cups of broth.  Also added some spinach at the end for some greenery.  The flavors meld together very well, creating a complex delight!

All i could smell and taste was the cinnamon, it was not a good combination.  This was easy to make, and looked good, but the cinnamon was just too much, it smelled like meat with cinnamon, I couldn't take it and threw the whole thing out.  Next time I'll omit the cinnamon and i'm sure it'll be fine :)

This was very tasty. I followed the recipe almost exactly (no substitutions), though I did make some adjustments to the amounts, as other reviewers suggested. 5 cups of chicken broth would have been waaaay to much - with only 3 cups, I still needed to use some flour to thicken it up, and left it on the burner for much longer than it called for.  Still pretty good - and I may freeze it to eat when I return from my international travels next month.

Love this.  Wasn't sure of the cinnamon either but WOW, what a great touch.  I used chicken instead of turkey, 3 cups of broth and one cup of water (ran out of broth), added 1/4 teaspoon of French Four Spice and 1/2 teaspoon Black Red (a black pepper and cayenne pepper mix) (both from Penzey's). I didn't add any cheese and it was still great! Thanks for the recipe...this is a keeper.

I should have listened to the others.  This dish did not have the normal chili consistency and was too watery.  I used a crock pot though so I just left it on longer to let some of the liquid evaporate and to let the flavors meld.  I was amazed though that my daughter loved it, and she is at a VERY picky eating phase.

I made this last night and reduced the chicken stock from 5 Cups to 3 to make it chili as opposed to soup.  The cinnamon/cumin and cayenne pepper really create a wonderful smell and taste.  I will make this again.  I also added twice the amount of garlic and it worked well.

I made this for the first time this week. Next time I make it, I will most likely reduce the cinammon to 1/4 TSP and liquid to potentially two cups because I used only three and it was still too soupy. My family also doesn't like chili peppers so I left it out.   Overall it's a yummy comfort food! Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I took the advice of previous reviews and only used 3 cups of chicken broth.  I also added a small can of white shoepeg corn.  I waited to stir in the cheese to each individual bowl and I think it worked out better for the leftovers.  It was yummy the next day for lunch!

This was excellent! I did tweak it though by only adding 2 cups of chicken broth, chili powder and hot sauce. I think cinnamon is very understated in this dish and think it brings out the flavor. I will be making this again!!!

I would give it 3 1/2 stars.  I didn't read the comments while I was making it and I wish that I had because it turned out to be a soup.  I didn't have time to wait for it to thicken so I served it as is.  The flavor was good but my husband said that he could really taste the cinnamon (even though I didn't add the full amount). We just finsished dinner and I have it simmering so I hope that it thickens up some.  I think that it should be better for lunch tomorrow.

Wowza, this was a tasty recipe. My whole family enjoyed it. I used Northern beans and no Cayenne. It was more like a soup than a chili. You could thicken it up but we liked it just fine. It was super easy to make too. Will make this again. Served with cornbread.

AWESOME!!!!  Thickened with a little cornstarch and served with Fritos, sour cream and some more cheese on the side! Picky Hubby even liked it!  The Cinnamon seemed a little weird, so I only used 1/2 tsp as others did... but it totally worked.  Great flavor.  Can't wait to make again!

I followed jmarie's advice and tried this chili AND liked it!  I followed the directions exactly except for using rinsed and drained Great Northern Beans that I did not mash.  Used a little less broth and the chili was thick enough for my liking.  Also did not add the cheese to the soup but used it as a garnish on top and stirred it into the individual servings.

The only reason this got four stars instead of five was because of the few little tweaks I made. If you want a thicker chili, use less broth. I did add a cornstarch slurry to help thicken it a bit more. I also added in a quarter can of diced jalepenos, we like things a bit spicy. I also only put in a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Simply because I was too scared. But it was good and I probably could have used more and it would have been just fine. A MUST is the chopped cilantro, sour cream, shredded jack cheese, and taco chips on top. This completes the dish. This was a GREAT change from red chili with hamburger. Try it...you will like it!

Was pretty tasty and easy. I did not puree the beans as specified. It was also too watery; I wished I had read other reviews to scale back on the broth. I was able to thicken it a bit with corn starch.

This was the "Best" I used only 2 cans of chicken broth and used one can of Butter beans.  Then I added at the end 1 slice on top of each bowl a slice of the spicy Velveeta cheese.  yummy.

This was ok, not the best,  I like a good hearty chili and this just didn't win me over. If you like mild, then this is for you.  The cinnamon really ddin't taste that great and I ended up throwing in taco seasoning to help bring out flavor.

Be warned this chili is way too soupy if you use the 5 cups it calls for! I debated on using that much when I started making the recipe, because it sounded like way too much, but I went ahead with it anyways. Unfortunately it came out like soup and I had to drain some of it off. Use only 2 cups of broth. It was also very bland so I added more spices, cut back on the cinnamon, added a few dashes of hot pepper sauce and some chipolte chili powder and only 2 cans of beans. My husband liked it, I thought it was just okay. Don't think I would make it again. ) > :

Great ground base to get me started.  Very bland, though.  I like flavorful, full bodied foods.  Had to add an array of spices to give it any oomph.  A tsp. of cinnamon was a little overpowering.  I will only add a small dash next time.  And was not spicy at all so my kiddos could enjoy as well.

This was excellent.  I added some extra beans and a bag of mixed cheese.  I did need to play around with the spices a little.  I followed the directions then added as I saw fit.  Husband loved it after initially being lukewarm.

This chili was great - very thick and hearty, particularly if you just mash the third can of beans with a fork and only put in about 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth.  I also simmered this chili for several hours to let the flavors meld.

A really tasty, really easy dish that was very rapidly demolished in our house! (Serves 4 hungry adults) Couldn't get canellini beans so substituted 2 cans Northern beans +1 can pintos; as suggested I mashed one tin with a fork instead of pureeing. Also instead of cayenne I added some McCormicks smoked chipotle pepper. I used only 2cups broth for a thicker sauce, and added 1cup shredded Colby-jack cheese. Served in bowls with self-serve bowls of plain tortilla chips & more shredded cheese, cayenne and black pepper. Would be great with cornbread too. Yummy! Thank you!

Great recipe! Followed other reviewers suggestions and used 2-3 cups of broth instead of 5 and 1 can of black beans in place of 1 can of cannellini beans.  Also added 1 tsp. taco seasoning and a little pepperjack cheese. Omitted the cinnamon because I didn't think the rest of my family would like it.  I'm sure the recipe is also great as written.

I really enjoy making this recipe.  The cinnamon adds a "sweet" element that counteracts the spice.  Everyone I know who has tasted it loves this chili!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! I did follow some advice from the other reviews as far as using only 3 cups of broth.  I also doubled the amount of cheese and added more cayenne and white pepper for extra spice.  But my husband loves it and so do I! Thanks :)

I made this with leftover thanksgiving turkey but forgot to review it.  I worked with what I had so I used 2 cans garbanzo and 1 great northern.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of what the recipe called for.  Served hot with crushed tortillas on top... AMAZING!

This recipe is extremely bland as written. We had to quadruple the spices and only then did it have some flavor... and it really wasn't that great of a flavor. I know there are far better white chili recipes out there.

Flavor was great. I wasn't sure about adding 2 cups of cheese since I was making it in the slow cooker and feared there would be a big glob of cheese. So I left it out. What I would do if you are going to leave out the cheese is to add another can of beans and puree that one as well. Cut back the chicken stock to 32 oz and drain at least one of the cans of beans that you are not going to be pureeing. Otherwise, it's more like a soup than a chili, it's still good but if you want it more hearty and without cheese this is what I would do.

yuh-umm! This is fabulous! There's probably no need to change this recipe at all, but frozen corn & black beans sounded really good so I went with it... and liked it! Also, as I was adding the broth, 5 cups seemed like it was going to be a bit much for 'chili' so I stopped at 4... definitely enough fluid for us. Oh, and the cinnamon totally works! Use less if you're not sure, but I would say it's essential to the white chili flavor... We luh-uvved this recipe!!

Very yummy! Next time i make it, i will not add as much chicken broth. Adding 5 cups made it more like soup rather than chili. 2 cups would probably be enough. Though, is fantastic!

Chili was pretty good. I did what a lot of reviewers recommended and cut the stock down to 2 cups but that was barely enough when you are adding 3 cans of beans. I had to add another cup of broth.

Love this recipe! I use chicken instead of ground turkey. I saute celery with the onion and garlic and add a can of corn and fresh cilantro.  I don't add the cheese directly to the soup but sprinkle on top afterwards.  Corn bread or tortilla strips go great with this chili.

Based on other reviews, only change I made was I used 2 cups chicken broth and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon instead of recipe as written. I also prefer a little thicker, so I used a little cornstarch.

made this with the leftover thanksgiving turkey -- definitely a hit!  spices were perfect.  also added some celery, bag of fresh spinach, can of corn, and 2 cups leftover mashed potatoes (instead of 3rd can of pureed beans) to clean out the fridge.  for liquid, only did juice from cans + 2 cans chicken broth.  came out nice and thick and hearty and full of veggies (although more of  a yellowish green chili than white).  will definitely make again!

I must say that I loved this chili, but my husband swears that this is his favorite.  That's a LOT coming from him too because I cook a lot and he likes it all.  Anyway, I think it was great (with the reduction of the amount of broth as recommended by others - I used about 2 cups).  It is a fabulous blend of flavors.

The second time I made it however, I doubled the recipe (I like to have some left to put in the freezer), and I added a can of mild rotel and a can of rotel for chili (we both love tomatoes).  It was PERFECT.  Just enough extra seasoning to kick it to the next level.  It was a small enough amount though to still have that "white chili" look and taste.  This recipe is great and has now been put into our normal weekend rotation.  LOVE IT!

I made this with chicken, similar to others.  I didn't like the taste or the texture, but the husband really liked it!  Since I'm a picky eater I figured I'd give it a shot- not for me, but a good recipe for normal people.

I really enjoyed this recipe!! It was a nice break from the usual heartburn inducing chili that I usually make. LOL I did add only 3 cups of liquid and doubled up on all the spices and chilis and it was still fairly mild...I went easy on the cinnamon and garnished with tortilla strips and sour cream...thanks for the recipe!!

Family loved it! The only change I would make is to add just a dash of cinnamon (I think I added too much).  Will make again with the cold weather coming up!

This chilli had good flavor but was very heavy. I added more cinnamon, garlic and cheese to thicken it a little more. Loved the tortilla chips over the top.  If I do make it again, I might try to figure out how to make it less heavy because it gave my husband and I bad indigestion.

This soup was delicious, and will be even better tomorrow. I didn't have canalleni beans so I used black beans and blended some left over garbanzo beans. I also didn't have diced chilis, so I used a can of diced tomatos with chilis instead. Both substitutions worked well. I will definitely be making this recipe again. It was great with tortilla chips on the side.

Very good!  I too only used about half the broth as we like our chili to be really thick.  I added some cheese and then served with additional cheese and sour cream.

I tried this as something new and was plesantly surprised.  The flavors combined nicely.  I added a bit of worchestershire sauce, but it was still missing something.  I will try it again and tweak it a bit.  I had leftovers and brought some with me to work the next day and YUM...even better on day 2!

I made this and put it in the crock pot on low for a few hours...I didn't really like the taste of what I think is the cumin, but my mom and husband loved it. I would suggest draining the beans and can of corn to avoid too much liquid...ours ended up more like soup.  I will try again with more turkey, less liquid and less cumin.

I've made this twice and it was great both times. I wouldn't add any more than 1 can (about 15 ounces) of chicken broth though, because that makes it soupy enough.

I made this chili with extra lean ground turkey which worked really well.  I only used 4 cups of broth which seemed plenty and I didn't use the 3rd can of pureed beans.  I was very hesitant about the cinnamon so I only added a half teaspoon.  I wish I hadn't used any at all.  It was definately odd tasting with the cinnamon and would be better without in my opinion.

This was good but I tweaked it a little. I only used one can of green chilis and then I added one fresh diced jalapeno. I also only used half of the cinnamon and next time I think I would use even less. All in all a good recipe...thanks!

Sorry. Not my favorite. very bland. I used 1/2 of the stock so it was the right consistency, but it lacked flavor. I added lime juice and cilantro which helped.

Ok...I kinda screwed up the recipe because I wasn't paying attention to the amount of ingredients I had on hand. I sure it would have been ok if I did it correctly but I think the ingredient that made the taste wierd was the cinnamon. I also added chili powder. I know that kept it from being white chili but it just didn't really taste like chili. Probably won't make again.

Just delicious! Only recommendation is to add way less broth -- I used it all and needed to add more beans and simmer for a couple hours to try to cook off excess liquid. served it over brown rice too with grated cheese. this is a keeper!!

The family loved this. I'm not sure about the cinnamon, though. I think next time I'll skip it and add cilantro. Very good topped with sour cream.

I thought this was a really solid recipe.  I liked the addition of the cinnamon - gave the dish a little added complexity, which was unexpected in a chili!  We will definitely make this again as the weather cools, and I'm looking forward to trying some of the recommended variations (corn, black beans, shredded chicken, etc).

I follow this recipe to the T, with the exception of the cheese.  I expected to have leftovers, so I did not put the cheese in the pot.  I put it in the bowls and then ladeled soup on top of it.  My husband and my oldest daughter are very, very picky eaters and they thought this was the best.

Thanks!!!1

We really liked this-great flavor and easy to cook with what is in the pantry!  I followed the recipe with only a few exceptions- I used 2 full cans of green chiles (8oz total) and only 2 cans of beans (mashed 1 can with a fork so as not to dirty the blender) and cut back a little on the broth.  I only had cheddar cheese so that's what I threw in.  It was a DELICIOUS dinner!  I love that it's a 'forgiving' recipe- still tasted GREAT with the changes I made.  YUM!  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This was quite good. 
I love the cinnamon, very nice addition (of course I am a huge fan of Cincinnati chili). 
I did use chopped chicken breast to lower the fat content a little. 
I took it to an event at work and it got raves. 
Thanks!

This is so delicious.  I made it as it says.  Next time I will add less broth.  It is like a soup this way, but still...a good soup!  
I don't mind the cinnamon taste, it's good to me.  I can't wait for my husband to come home and try this!

This was an ok recipe. I only put in 4 cups of the chicken stock and it was still like a soup rather than a thick chili. It did have a god sing to the taste though!

Excellent dish!  The cinnamon is very interesting and unique.  It also works well with ground chicken.  My family usually omits the cheese and we don't puree any beans.  We're lazy that way.  Sometimes we cut back a can of beans and can of peppers, too.

great recipe. i cut the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp., reduced the jack cheese to cut fat. garnish with cilantro like she suggests- it really adds another dimension, not to mention it looks great.

The cinnamon makes this very interesting. Hearty and filling but not very heavy like tomato-based chili. I added corn and reduced the chicken broth to make it less soupy. Garnished with cheese, tortilla chips, and sour cream.

This is very good, the flavor is definitely unique.  I used a little less broth per other reviews, which made it more chili-like, but I think I would like it better as a soup than as chili, next time I will probably use the full amount of liquid.  Didn't mix in any cheese but garnished individual servings w/ cheddar (didn't have jack), sour cream, and olives and served with tortilla chips.  Oh, and I added a can of corn just because I love corn!  Thanks Donna!

Didn't read the other reviews in advance and mine too came out a little soupy, but I let it simmer down for a while and it turned out great.  I crushed up some tortilla chips to add as a topping.

This was outrageous!  I only used one pkg. of ground turkey which is 20 oz., and 1 can of broth was plenty so that it wasn't soupy.  Also used 1 full tbsp. chile powder cause we like it hot!  The cinnamon gave it a great taste,  thanks for sharing, Donna.

I made this recipe with about half the amount of chicken broth and cinnamon but added extra garlic and green chile peppers. Served it with tortilla chips and cheese on top. It tasted good but next time I will not put any cinnamon in. The smell was just too much - I think it would taste even better without it.

This receipe was really good (even my picky 7 year old liked it). I especially liked the cumin, cinamon and green chile combo. I agree with a few others about the color.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is easy and tastes great, a perfect combination in my book!  I am a busy mom of a 5 and 2-year old, and everyone in the family likes this dish.  I make it several times a month.  The beauty of it is that you can keep these ingredients on hand and make it any time you are in a pinch for what to serve for dinner!  I usually make it with less chicken broth than called for (about half the amount), and sometimes add diced tomatoes or a can of Rotel.  Also, I would definitely rinse and drain the beans.  Yummy!

Gave it two stars because my husband didn't mind eating it. The amounts of cumin and cinnamon are overpowering if you use high quality spices. I also didn't care for the added cheese, something I would rather let people add to their chili as a garnish.

Very good.  I used more garlic, about 5 cloves, 2 cans of northern beans and 2 cups of chicken broth.  I skipped the cheese to reduce calories.  I pureed both cans of beans.  I added cilantro and frozen Trader Joe's roasted corn.  The corn really pumped it up; it did need 'something more'.  This freezes well.

Very good recipe. Would definately reduce the ammount of liquid in this by cutting the Chicken Stock in half and drain and rinse two of the three cans of beans. Also I am not big on cinnamon in food, except french toast. I kept it in next time I will leave it out. Wasn't bad with it in just think it would be better without.

Very tasty and best of all, easy, but WAY too much chicken broth is called for.  Would cut that down to 2 cups.
I'm not a cinnamon lover in savory dishes, so I dropped that too.

My husband. who is a very picky eater liked this. I liked it a lot. I didn't use the cayenne because he doesn't like things too hot and this was just about right for him. I didn't think I would like the cinnamon, but after the chili simmered for 20 minutes, it was much better

I've made this recipe several times now and think it's a keeper.  Of course, read the reviews and made some adjustments.  I decreased the amount of broth and cinnamon (not a big fan of Cincinnati chili either but think a mere pinch of cinnamon adds depth and mystry to this dish), increased the garlic and added white corn.

Easy, quick, and a show stopper.  This was a wonderful recipe.  DON'T leave out that cinnamon it makes the dish. The combination of spices is purely top rate. Absolutly the best of the ones on this site.  Okay so did I mentioned that the kids loved it all 6!!  My dh thought it was great too.  So do it.

I thought this recipe was great! :) The cinnamon adds a very interesting touch! I love the ease of canned beans! I also found tht Great Navy Beans work just as well! :)
