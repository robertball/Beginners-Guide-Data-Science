Awesome Salad!  I did add/ change it a bit to suit my liking.  I made it equal parts oil/vinegar and reduced it to 1/4 c. This kept all of the flavor and just made it less oily. 

Make sure you constantly stir those almonds and as soon as they are slightly brown, get them out... they can burn quickly.  I recommend spraying a small dish with cooking spray to pour the almonds on and allow to cool before breaking up, otherwise, the sugar makes them stick to the surface.

Recommend using 1/2 red onion- a whole onion just seems to be too much.
I also added dried cranberries and used bagged green romaine lettuce. Delicious!

Excellent taste!  Recommendations: add a teaspoon or two of the orange juice from the can into the almonds when you put them in the pan.  Cook on low heat and stir often for 5-8 minutes, cool quickly when they brown;  they come out wonderful!  I make extra to snack on later because they are THAT good! Another thing I do is soak the chopped onions first, as it reduces the OVER-ONIONED flavor and throw the entire dressing (along with the pre-soaked and drained onions) into the blender.   The dressing comes out perfect!

This is one of the best salads I've tried on this site-I loved it as did my husband.  Surprisingly, I loved the almonds and I typically hate them.  I didn't add the celery (personal preference), used green lettuce rather than red, and halved the entire recipe.  As most salads of this sort (in my opinion), it doesn't necessarily keep very well so don't toss the dressing until you're almost ready to serve.  Wonderful! Thanks! :)

This salad was very good - I will definitely make again.  I took some of the suggestions from other reviews.  Short cuts like using 2 bags of prepared salad, only 1/4 cup veg oil in the dressing, & bagged seasoned almond slices.  I also added craisins and some crunchy chow mein noodles.  My friends were impressed.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars. Before my bank's Christmas dinner was over I knew that I would be passing this recipe on to my fellow co-workers. It has become a favorite for my family and it is now the requested item for me to take to family functions. Hint-I always make the dressing up the day before and to make this quick and easy I use 2 bags of the prepared romaine lettuce. Thanks Betsy for making this one of our favorites.

Made this for a dinner party and all the guests really loved it.  I knew it tasted good when someone elses husband commented on it!  My husband ate the leftovers for lunch the next day and my husband doesn't eat salad!  This recipe was very easy.  I prepared the dressing and the nuts in the morning and chopped the celery and onions and put them in the refrigerator.  All that was left was to put everything in a bowl and toss just before dinner.  The salad looks very professional too.

Very, very delicious salad that I made just for me today. After my daughters' prom Friday night, the kids returned home and told me that the food was just so-so, but the salad was GROSS! When I asked them about the salad, they all informed me that "they" had the nerve to put oranges in their salad along with a sweet dressing. Sounded awfully good to me so I went asearchin' for something similar. Glad I found it Doreen and it was anything BUT gross! Hey, what do kids know....

This is a wonderful salad, esp. for winter. The dressing is a wonderful blend that is so tasty and compliments the fruit perfectly. I made a few changes, but nothing that affects the salad. I used toasted blanched olives, a mix of romaine and baby spinach, added cranraisins, extra oranges, and soaked the onions in water for an hour and then drained them (this helps to take the bite out of the onions.) Just a wonderful salad. Thanks Doreen!

This was an easy and delicious.  I've read other orange salad recipes and one instructed that the onions be soaked in water for an hour and then drained.  I may try this next time, to give the onions a milder flavor. This is a keeper!

Very good salad! Tip from a produce mgr: cut thin slice from bottom of read leaf lettuce, rinse lettuce in warm water for 3 min., drain upside down. Lettuce will be restored to crispness. It worked even though our lettuce was several days old.

Very good salad as was the dressing. I made equal parts of veg oil and cider vinegar, 1/4 cup. I added almost an 1/8 cup of white sugar. I minced up some fresh parsley and seasoned the dressing with salt and black pepper. Thou it did not call for this in the recipe, I did add the juice from the mandarin oranges to the dressing instead of draining it. Also, I only used one can (15 oz) of mandarin oranges. I placed the dressing in the refrigerator to chill. I toasted up the almonds with 1 T of white sugar as the 1/4 cup seemed a bit too much. Once the almonds were coated I removed it from the heat to cool down completely before breaking them up in pieces. I rinsed, dried and tore up  bite size pieces of the red leaf lettuce. I thinly sliced up a quarter of a red onion as well as one celery stalk with the leafy green parts. The nice part of this dressing is that you can adjust the amount of seasonings to taste with room to add other ingredients to the salad. I served this with Asian Grilled Chicken and Sesame Broccoli Salad, from this website, and delicious by the way.

DELICIOUS!  This salad was a HUGE hit at our dinner table, and I will definately make this again and again.  I thought some of the reviews were hysterical ("My celery fell to the bottom" - LOL.  It's a SALAD!!)  Anyway, awesome dressing.  Loved it.

I have made this salad a number of times and always get rave reviews and asked for the recipe.  The trick to keeping it crisp is to wait to mix in the oranges and the dressing until right before you serve it.

I was looking for a Mandarin Orange Salad just like the ones in the fancy restaurants.  This one is even better!  It's the perfect salad for special guests.

Absolutely Delicious!  As per prior suggestions I used half the amount of oil and a mixture of red leaf and romaine lettuce.  Using bagged seasoned toasted almond slices saves a step and cuts the sweetness a bit.  You may want to add about half of the dressing at first and then finish adding to taste.  Even my husband ( "You are putting oranges in WHAT"? ) loved it!!

Excellent salad!  Always a hit when I make it and everyone always wants the recipe.  I add craisins as well and have used the dressing recipe as a marinade/dressing for fresh vegetables.

I make this all the time to take to gatherings or to have with a large or small meal.  I now receive requests to bring this to the office party or neighborhood gathering.  For variations I will change the type of vinegar used in the dressing i.e. balsalmic or apple cider vinegar.  This is definely something to keep in the front of your recipe book.

We (adults) liked this. I did have a problem with the sugar burning then sticking to the pan. I also used half the amount of oil and added water for the remainder. I think I created too much dressing. I'll omit the water next time. Also the celery fell to the bottom of the bowl.

everyone is right- i made it with less oily dressing (using fresh parsley) and less onion (i actually used scallions) and i doubled the almonds, and i substituted avocado for the peppers (which my gf doesn't like).  and OH! it was SO GOOD!  the combo of the oranges, onions, almonds and avocado was a taste sensation! highly recomended.

I made this recipe following the directions carefully. The salad tasted good, but it was all limp and soggy. No one wanted to try it as it looked so bad! I ate some of it and what i did eat tasted good, although a bit mushy.
Would look for a different recipe nex time. and I would use a different type of lettuce as well.

Very good salad!
I took it to Christmas Eve and Christmas Day - each family gave it rave reviews.  I'm now getting "famous" for bringing such wonderful green salads to family dinners.  I did add butter to the almonds when sugaring and only used about 1/4 of the dressing.  Delicious!!!

This was the first dish to go at our Chirstmas dinner. Everyone ate it up and asked for the recipe! I did change the recipe a bit...less oil, less salt, added cranberries and only half an onion. Yummy!! This is a new favorite!

Very yummy. Followed other reviewers advice and cut the oil in half and I used fresh parsley instead of dried. The almonds were amazing on the salad. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this salad for a potluck dinner last night and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I used a combination of red leaf and butter leaf lettuce, substituted Splenda for half the sugar and used raw almonds in order to save on the calories. Delicious!

Fabulous! I saved a step and just added slivered almonds from the store, the flavored kind. I also added about one tablespoon of the juice from the canned mandarin oranges to the dressing.  I also added some craisins ('cause I love 'em!).

Really a nice salad.  I used Romaine and green onions as I did not have red leaf and red onion, equally as good though.  I served for a ladies luncheon with quiche and bacon wrapped breadsticks~~yum.

I tweaked this for myself and a client - used clementines, splenda, light olive oil, toasted almonds and oj.  Great flavor, very refreshing and figure friendly.   Chef Diane

we LOVE this salad...i always make it to accompany peanut butter noodles (from this site) or any other main asian dish.  really tasty!  it does not keep well the second day, so i always keep the oranges and dressing separate, and dish up as needed.

I thought this was good but it was missing an Asian flair. The only thing really Asian about this salad was the oranges. It's very sweet and like candy. I think if I was going to make it I would reduce the sugar and add some sesame, ginger, and soy to give it more of a bite.

I tried this recipe for a partylast year, and it was a hit.  The oranges give the salad a twist and the vinaigrette was wonderfully sweet (I kept some to use it on other salads).  I did not use red onions, as I am not a big fan of them.  I also found that the viniagrette needed to be added at the last second before serving otherwise the lettuce gets very wilted.

I make this once a week.  Everybody loves it.  The only change I make is that I substitute walnut oil for vegetable oil, and I do this with all of my homemade salad dressings I just like the flavor better.

I had a can of mandarin oranges in the pantry that was getting old, so I selected this recipe to use them up.  I just toasted my almonds (350 degrees for 8-10 minutes) rather than glazing them with sugar.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  This was a nice combination of ingredients and made for a tasty salad, however I did think the dressing was lacking a bit.  I would make this salad again, but I would try another dressing.

This recipe was good except for the red onion! It was really spicy even though I only used 1/2 an onion. Next time I make this, I will replace the red onion with another sweeter onion.

I loved this! I made it tonight for BUNCO i was hosting, and everyone raved about it.  The only alteration that I made was adding about 1/2 cup dried cranberries. It added some nice color variation, and the tartness/sweetness addition was really great!  I cannot wait to make this again!

Recipe has way too much oil.  Switch to 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/4 cup oil.  

Other than that, very nice.

I made this and my family was won over by it.  Especially the dressing! That has to be the simplest, most yummy dressing ever! I didnt toss the salad with it though, i let them put on as much as they wanted! everyone went for seconds, and everyone asked for the recipe. (i'm only 13!!!) My dad loved it so much, he made it at the restraunt he works at! It sold bunches.....and was put on as a special!! yummm!

Yup. This is a great salad. I thought 1/4 cup sugar sounded like way too much so I reduced it to 1 heaping tablespoon. Glad I did. Only other changes I made was to use light olive oil and romaine lettuce. My company loved it. Oh... one other thing I would do next time is to use a little less red onion. It's a keeper!

I only had "roasted garlic ceasar" almonds on hand so I used those and eliminated the step where you sugar the almonds.  It still made a great salad that the whole family enjoyed.  This dressing is great on a cucumber, tomato, and onion salad also.  Thanks Doreen for taking the time to post the recipe!

This salad is wonderful.  I have made it 5 times over the summer for potlucks.  It is the first dish gone.  With many asking for the recipe.  I did follow another viewers advise to add craisins and crumbled bacon.  What a great add.  Thanks

If there's one thing I hate it's leftover salad that already has dressing on it-not a problem with this one!

A woman at my work made this salad and I HAD to have the recipe.  I made it just as the recipe states and all I can say is it is delicious and my new favorite.  I may do as others suggested and add craisins next time.  Just be careful heating the sugar and almonds and take it low and slow.  You think the sugar will never dissolve, but it will -- just don't rush it, otherwise it might burn.  Yummy salad!

This was very good..based on other reviews I cut the oil down to 1/4 c but it was almost too tangy so next time will make as is.  Different salad that I will not be afraid to take to share.  Definitely put the dressing and almonds on right before serving or lettuce will wilt.

Nice salad, light flavor so it doesn't overwhelm the flavors of your main dish. The dressing was more than we used.

Loved by all at Christmas dinner.  I changed recipe slightly by adding some drained orange juice from the canned mandarin oranges to the dressing, only used half a red onion.  Next time I will not bother to sugar coat the almonds as the sugar in the dressing adds enough sweetness. Half a red onion chopped is plenty. Leave the celery in 1/4 in. "half moon" segments rather than dicing or chopping.

Used fresh oranges and spinach instead of lettuce. Chopped up almonds before caramalizing. Turned out well. Oil can be reduced according to me...I won't miss it when reduced.

Soooo good!!  I did what others had suggested and reduced the amount of oil to equal the amount of vinegar.  I used olive oil and red wine vinegar.  I also added just a little of the mandarin orange juice to the dressing.  This is a great salad!  Thanks for sharing!

Very easy and tasty!  I didn't have apple cider vinegar, so I just used plain white vinegar, but it still tasted great.  I think next time I might try some of the other suggestions about using 1/4 c of oil instead because it was a bit oily.  Instead of red leaf lettuce, I just used various salad greens that I had on hand.  Also, I used a white onion instead of a red onion (that is what I had on hand).  I followed the other tips to soak the onion in water first.  I also left out the celery becuase I didn't have any.  Very tasty salad!

OUTSTANDING salad! Really, I was quite impressed. This would be a 5 star recipe with the one minor adjustment of reducing the amount of oil in the dressing to equal the vinegar. I also added a few Tablespoons of the orange syrup to the dressing, but I don't know that it made that much difference. I can't wait until my next dinner party. This is sure to be on the menu.

This is delicious!!! I love the tangy-sweet dressing with the soft manderine oranges and crunchy celery. I made 1/2 the dressing recipe and only used about 2-3 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil. (for the reviewer asking about what to do with the purple onion - I sliced it thinly and put it in the salad, not the dressing. The color combination of this salad is fantastic. I used 2 frozen cubes of hopped parsley and love how it adds bright green speckles to the dressing.

Question: The recipe doesn't say what to do with the onion. Does it go in the dressing or on the salad?
This salad has so many good reviews, I can't wait to make it. But I want it to be just right.

I was so excited to try this salad, but was disappointed because I didn't really think the dressing matched the concept of a mandarin orange salad.  I would have thought it would have more of an asian flavor.  I would recommend the following:
-you only need about 2 tbsp. of onion and make sure you mince very fine and put into the actual dressing
-add chow mein noodles 
-add sesame seeds
-change the dressing - I would recommmend trying an asian sesame dressing.  I am going to try that next time to see if it tastes better.  I hear Good Seasons has an Asian Sesame that you just have to add the vinegar, oil and water to.  I've looked all around and most stores don't carry it, but it is available online for purchase.  

Keep in mind...what I was going after was a salad similar the Oriental Chicken Salad at Friendly's.

Not bad.  It is a good base recipe.  The salad itself was excellent.  I was not a huge fan of the dressing.  I think there is something about dried parsley that I'm not that crazy about.  I made it for company, however, and they LOVED it.  I would consider substituting poppy seeds for the parsley or using fresh parsley next time.

I've made this salad several times and always receive compliments on it.  I usually use baby spinach instead of the salad greens and I add craisins. I sometimes add sesame seeds, a few drops of sesame oil, and a little  of the orange juice to the dressing.  I will also substitute pine nuts for the almonds sometimes.

I substituted splenda for the sugar in the dressing & just added the almonds plain.  The addition of mandarin oranges to the salad was a nice touch but I found the dressing way too sweet.  If you like a sweet dressing though, you'll love this. I brought the leftover salad to work today with another dressing.  I added chunks of blue cheese & leftover baked chicken strips & it was tasty.

VERY, VERY good.  I didn't use a red onion because I don't care for raw onion in my salads.  I used probably twice the amount of almonds than were called for because I love slivered almonds.  Dressing was delicious!

My whole family absolutely loved this salad!  I used Sugar Twin instead of the sugar, but while this worked very well in the dressing, it did not go over when cooking the amonds.  This is a keeper!

Wonderful!  Felt like I had ordered a fancy salad at a restaurant.  I used pecans instead of almonds - they were very good!  Thanks.

Made this for a family dinner using 2 bags ready to eat romaine and canola oil versus vegetable. Didn't use parsley, onion or celery. Was SO good. My mother in law makes this but it calls for a bit of tobasco in the dressing but tastes just like this recipe. Will definitely be adding this to one of my "go to" recipes when I need to take a dish somewhere.

Fantastic and so refreshing! The only change I added. I sprinkle  coconut flakes to it on top adds a bit more sweetness and texture to it. Everyone loves this salad when I sever it and never have any left overs.

This was very good base to start from but I felt it lacked substance.  I added dried cranberries, onion, and crispy Chinese noodles and it made it great. 5 stars with tweaking.

Great recipe.  For the dressing though, I only use 2 T vinegar, 1 T parsley, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 t salt, pepper, and 1 T Splenda.  It cuts down on the calories and oil a bit.  I don't use the celery either.  Works out great!

Very good salad. Thank you. The only change I made was to decrease the sugar for the almonds by 1/2. This will go in my favorite salad recipes.

I make this salad often, using plain sliced almonds.  The dressing is wonderful!  Think I would cut recipe in half since there are just two of us.  It makes a good amount.

What a great salad! I made it yesterday for the Super Bowl and my mother-in-law commented that it was one of the best salads she's had in a long time. I especially liked the flavor combination of the caramelized almonds and oranges. I did use clementines instead of canned. I also cut back on the red onion. I only used about 1/4 of the onion because I think using the whole onion would have been too overpowering. I'll definitely be making this again.

I made the recipe as stated. When making the candied almonds keep a close on it. This recipe is delicious and I received may compliments. It is a keeper and I will be making it again. Its a nice change of pace.
