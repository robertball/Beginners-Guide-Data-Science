This soup was awesome! The only changes I made was to use regular potatoes instead of red potatoes and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of light cream. It was plenty rich. I will definitely make this again!!!

Very sweet and yummy!  My five year old gave it 2 thumbs up and eight year old gobbled it right down.  I think next time I will add red bell peppers.

It's summer, and I'm heading into my soup and salad/half-sandwich mode.  Cook early in the day, maybe grill in the evening, and don't heat up the kitchen for dinner.  Followed this recipe to the letter and garnished with a couple roasted red pepper strips and chopped parsley.  Roasting the fresh corn really brings out its sweetness and adds great flavor to this chowder...pls. don't skip this step.  Excellent, wouldn't change a thing.

To skip having to make the roux, I started with 4 T of butter to saute the onions, celery, and garlic and added half a poblano pepper.  Then added the 3 T of flour before adding the other ingredients. Delicious and with less cream would be just as good.

This has been may go to chowder for awhile now. To make it vegan (and bc I don’t ever have cream on hand) I add 2 cups cashew cream to it instead (1 cup of raw cashews boiled for 15 min or so or soaked overnight, then blended in a high speed blender with 1 cup water). Super rich and creamy and yummy!

This is a really great soup but don't skip the roasting of the corn. Roasting takes the raw corn flavour out and you get a real corn taste.  I added a few spices to kick it up a bit and added the  butter and flour to the sautéed vegetables.  I added a bay leaf, a shake or two of thyme and cayenne.  Added grated cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon to the top. Top notch recipe.

It was really good! I used coconut cream though because i'm vegan. I also made the cream of corn myself, by simply putting in in the blender. No salt used, just my usual bragg's aminos, nutritional yeast, and other spices for flavor. Turned out really good! Added crab sticks too. Next time, blend everything BEFORE adding potatoes and half crab sticks, and some corn, and some carrots...? make it chunky!

Funny but this is the recipe I have for Corn Chowder in the recipe box in the kitchen! The only thing I change out is the cream for milk (I do the same with my Cream of Mushroom soup). It can be thickened just fine without cream. 

It's tasty and yes the next time I make this I will be adding freshly picked peas.  I also make a pot full and freeze the rest.

You can also add some spicy thai sauce so it completely changes the taste. Even Jalapeños! It might also be good with some steamed mussels or scallopes added at the last minute.

We added 2 cups of greek yogurt, it was so yum yum.  This really hit the spot, make sure you sizzle everything in oil before throwing it all together.

Next time, want to make thicker (more flour or  add corn starch).  Add bell pepper and something like hot sauce for a zing!

A nice thick corn chowder that satisfies every sense.  It's perfect for a cold winter's day or a cool fall evening. I highly recommend this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to add more corn. ;)

One of my favorite soups. Can use frozen corn (I use the entire bag). Can also put in crock pot after it's finished to keep warm for parties, etc.

Very good soup! Had to sub sweet potatoes 'cause I was out of white, but they tasted really good, and I added a bit of cumin and cayenne pepper for a little zing. Will definitely make again.

The soup was great but a little plain. Next time I will definitely add peppers and ham or bacon. Also I used cornstarch to thicken and it worked perfect.

I have never made Corn Chowder! I made it for a coworker that was leaving and we had a party for her. She requested corn chowder. This recipe was AMAZING!!!
I like a little protein so I cut chicken breasts into little pieced and coated with a little flour and pepper and cooked it. I added water to the bottom of the pan and scraped the pan and added to the soup for additional seasoning. DELICIOUS! I made three soups that day and this one was gone within a 1/2 hour! I now have people asking me to make it and they would pay me!!! hahaha. Make this recipe it's fantastic. Thank you!

Wow, this was really good chowder!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I froze 2/3 of it, so I hope it thaws and reheats ok.  I think I'll add either bacon or rotisserie chicken the next time I make it.  Also, I thought it would thicken up a little more, so perhaps some corn starch next time.  All in all, very good and well worth it.  (1/13/18) Update:  The soup reheated just fine after freezing.  I first thawed it in the fridge and heated it up on the stove on low heat.  I just made it again for a second time but used frozen corn because its January.  I also added fresh cooked and chopped bacon!  Delicious!

Simply delicious! My husband and I loved this Corn Chowder. I will be keeping this one in the recipe box for sure! Since my family can't enjoy a soup without adding a touch of meat in some way and form... I added bacon while it was thickening with the roux. It was amazing! I'd like to try adding Hamm to the chowder as well. Oh, I also didn't have corn ears or celery in the house and it was too much of wintery-weather to head out to the grocery store. So I added half a teaspoon of celery-seed as I was making the roux and for the corn I roasted frozen corn, although I'm sure the real deal there would of been even better!

Love this chowder! I make it in the crock pot, but do sauté the onions, garlic and celery and roast the chicken in the oven. Have made it twice now and varied it with sweet potatoes when that was what was here. Also added some kale when there was no parsley in the house. Delicious!!

Very good! Since I halved this, I skipped the oven part for just two ears of corn. A reviewer mentioned that she didn't notice that much difference after oven-roasting it anyway. I only had regular milk on hand, so I went with that. I used one white potato that I didn't peel because it had a thin skin, and it looked nice with the skin on, too. I also added a little cayenne pepper at the end because I like a little bite. This will be nice in the colder months. I'd just try canned or frozen corn since fresh wouldn't be readily available, and I'm sure it would work fine.

I just made this soup and we love it!    I did, per my family's preference add some fried bacon and some roasted red peppers to it.   Again, we loved it.   My only other comment is that I did roast the corn, but didn't taste anything from doing so.   So, I'll probably skip that step the next time I make it, and there will be a next time!

My husband and I really, really liked this!  The only change I made was to use plain almond milk in place of the cream because that's all I had in the house.  Oh, and I had to use frozen corn since it's February and I can't get fresh.  Easy and absolutely delicious!  We garnished it with green onions, cheese, and a dollop of sour cream, but it's good without all that.  I will definitely make this again since it's easy enough for a weeknight dinner and I almost always have the ingredients.  Thanks!
