Tiny Banana Cream Pie Haiku: "Kids liked these alot. For me, they were just ok. But they are easy!" I could only assume that 5 graham crackers was five of the broken rectangles from the larger sheet that's made up of four? Obsessive organizer in me kicked noting that one round banana slice doesn't exactly cover a rectangle, so I used two slices instead, deviating from the recipe's instructions. But for the ease of putting these 3 ingredients together for an after-school snack, I didn't think the adjustment was an afront to the recipe submitter. They tasted pretty good and the young gals I served them too gobbled them with mumbled "yums."

@Rock_Lobster 
Im glad your kids enjoyed! Though, doesn't taste exactly like the real thing, it has it's own delicious taste. I actually used pre-made cut garam crackers by the creators of the normal garam crackers company.  I probably should have made myself a bit clearer! Thanks for rating.
