I have made this with pork chops instead of chicken and it comes out great.  You could also use a pork loin roast. When I first saw the recipe, the ingredients just didn't sound like they would go together, but I was intrigued.  The concoction comes out tasting like a very mild barbecue sauce.  Don't be afraid to try it! It is so nice to find a recipe that uses so few ingredients and ones that I usually have on hand.

I have to tell you, I didn't change a thing with this recipe and I think this recipe is the best I have gotten on any website.  I LOVED IT!!!!! Not only was it totally yummy but the smell of it cooking made me drool all day.  I would have never thought of putting these ingredients together but boy, it sure works.  Thank you, momof2boys.

I made this last night for Christmas Eve.  I used a whole chicken, 1 can cranberry & about 2 cups fresh cranberries, 1 package onion soup & a little water.  I left out the Catalina.  It was DELISH and a huge hit!  Using the fresh berries eliminated the problem other reviews had with berries (sauce) being too mushy & not staying whole.  It's a festive, easy and yummy dish.

Simple and good.  I love when a recipe uses practical items, and especially love it when all I have to do is throw it in the crockpot awhile.  I did turn up the crock pot to high for the first couple hours, then backed it down to low.  Chicken was cooked PERFECTLY.  Next time, we're going to add a can of chunked pineapple, per my husband's recommendation.

Made this for a Sunday dinner and everyone loved it.  Sauce wasn't overly sweet, it was unbelievably easy, and I made it as written.  Didn't have any fresh chicken, so I used pre-cooked, frozen chicken breast patties.  Slow cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours - beautiful!  Will now be in our Sunday dinner rotation!

This tastes just like the oven version, so it was a hit with us! I used chicken tenders and did reduce the catalina dressing to 8oz. b/c that's the way I make the oven version. The smell/taste of this always reminds me of and Asian-y or Chinese-y type of dish, so I served 'Asian Coconut Rice' and 'Garlic Broccoli" (except used green beans), both from this site...a great match! Served the chicken and sauce over the rice~YUM! Loved that I was able to do this in the slow cooker and get the same results. A great new way for me to make this yummy chicken! Thanks for sharing. :)

Got this recipe a couple of years ago and have made it with meatballs for potluck at work  Everyone wanted the recipe and could not believe how easy it was. Great stuff! As for people lecturing everyone on calorie counts and how the world is so fat why bother coming to a recipe site? Check out recipe sites for low calorie, heart, diabetes recipes etc. The rest of us just want good recipes to serve our families.

I have this same recipe for the oven.
Reduce Catalina salad dressing to 8 oz.
Bake uncovered, one hour at 350 degrees.
Comes out perfect!

All I would do is add more chicken. I have a lot of leftover sauce now. Also, When it was done cooking I added a flour/water mix to thicken the sauce.

I was skeptical because it doesn't sound like the ingredients work, but this turned out wonderfully. I can't believe how easy it is. The person who wrote the bad review four years ago was mistaken about the calories. Catalina dressing has half the calories of regular dressing, and the liquid is plentiful and just used as a sauce. I wouldn't say it's for people on a diet, but it's not a problem to eat the chicken and a few tablespoons of sauce. It's certainly not cause for flipping out about obesity. I've seen worse "diet" foods. That review should be removed. They never even tried the recipe and skewed the ratings.

Very tender and sweet. It tastes  a lot like barbeque chicken. I liked it, but I don't know when I'll be making it again.

I have been using this recipe for about 25 years.  It makes enough sauce for 10 chicken legs seperated.  I also use French salad dressing and add a tin of mandarin oranges undrained.  After putting the chicken in the crockpot or an oven dish (350 for 1-1/2 hours) I SPRINKLE THE CHICKEN GENEROUSLY WITH CURRY POWDER AND GARDLIC POWDER, plus some pepper, then add the sauce mixture.  I turns out great over rice or pasta.  I have to say that it took me a long time to try this dish because of the unusual ingredients but when I did try it, it became a "keeper".

I was so happy I planned to make this for tonight's dinner because I had a crazy day and this is so easy to make. Catalina dressing is very sweet so I only used half a bottle of the fat free version. I still ended up with plenty of sauce that was just sweet enough to complement the tartness of the cranberry sauce. Overall I thought it was pretty darn good considering how incredibly easy it is. Definitely make mashed potatoes or rice to serve with it.  You can add in an extra piece of chicken or two since this recipe makes plenty of sauce.

I have been making this for years and I have to say it is always a hit with my family. Couldn't be easier. I've cooked it in the oven as well as in the crockpot. If you can find bacon French dressing instead of Catalina it's even better.

The recipe couldn't be easier!!! But the flavor is a bit strong and odd. The chicken does end up pretty moist and tastes great over rice. I put mine with carribean peas and rice and it worked great.

I made this with a pork tenderloin.  I thought it was okay.  I tasted too much Catalina dressing and not enough cranberry.  I made the recipe exactly as instructed.  If I make it again, I think I may try to add some brown sugar to it and decrease the dressing.  It just didn't hit the mark for me.

I tried this recipe yesterday and it tastes great!  It does produce a bit too much sauce for 4 chicken breasts, so next time I think I will just use half the bottle of Catalina dressing.  

I threw in a small package of chopped walnuts (since I love cranberries and walnuts).  Served it over white rice for dinner last night, and today I have leftovers that I chopped up for use in a sandwich.  Yum!  I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the excess sauce.

This recipe was so easy and it was so good. I used egg noodles and put the sauce over them. My family said " You can make this again". It was a very good choice and very simple thing to make. I would make no changes to the recipe.

Easy. Simple ingredients and prep time.  Family loved it.  Unique flavor.  Excellent!  It does yield a lot of sauce.  Maybe could cut back on dressing.  Added walnuts and tossed in some dried cranberries at the end and put some canned pinapple tidbits on top to dress it up and it was great!

This is a standby at our house.  Just fine to omit the salad dressing too.  Yummy with a wild rice pilaf.  I've been making this recipe for 15 years and am surprised anyone else has heard about it.  Like the idea of adding walnuts as another review suggested.

Delicious!  Another variation is to use Russian dressing, apricot preserves and dry onion soup mix.  Good with boneless pork, too.

My family thought this OK.  I'm giving it a high of 3 stars because maybe it cooked too long, but the breasts were a bit too tough and while the sauce wasn't bad initially it gave a very strange after taste.  My husband specifically told me to PLEASE not try this recipe ever again.  Just not for our family.

Oh, my!  This recipe is *really* good!  We have made it twice, now.  The first time we didn't have Catalina dressing so we substituted French dressing.  The second time, we did have Catalina dressing on hand.  Both times, the results were fabulous with the Catalina dressing version being just a touch spicier.  Great on rice (white or brown).

I really enjoy this recipe. Very easy and tasty. I have also done this with russian dressing in place of the catalina and apricot preserves in place of the cranberry sauce. I like the original the best but it is fun to mix it up a little.

This was tasty. I used chicken breast cut into large pieces and served on a bed of rice. I had the rice cooker out so I used the top tray to steam some green beans to serve on the side. Don't expect a strong cranberry taste, the cranberries mix with the seasonings and dressing to create something very different. I will make this again, next time with pork.

I made this last night with some pork chops I had frozen. The sauce was delicious! I also threw in some apple slices and it was a nice compliment to the flavors. I served it over rice with asparagus, cornbread, small salad on the side. I overcooked the pork a little bit (1hr on high, then 3 hrs low) but that was my fault-not the recipes. Will eat again!

Ease of prep:  5 stars

Way too much sauce.  Try decreasing the amount of dressing.

This was great and very easy to put together.  I used pre-frozen chicken tenders, and put them in frozen - still only took 5 hours on Low. and it was perfect.  almost reminds me of the chinese food red sauce.  servied with rice and green beans

I followed the directions exactly, and I agree with one reviewer that it tastes like a mild barbecue sauce, but something about the sauce (maybe the onion soup mix) made everything smell weird, metallic or something. It was good, but I really wish I knew what to do to make it smell better.

My entire family loved this!  Which is so rare!! I didn't change a thing to the original recipe.  I was a little skeptical of this recipe because the ingredients are a little strange.  I tasted the ingredients after I first mixed them together.  The mixture didn't taste too great. But I added the chicken and let the crockpot do it's thing. Six hours later, it tasted amazing!  Honestly it tastes a little like orange chicken. That what my family calls it. Four thumbs up from us!!!!! Yay!!!!

Pretty good!  To those giving it a bad rating due to the fat/calories...it's very easy to use low or fat free dressing!   And if you leave it out altogether as a few suggested, there's really very little fat in it.

Unfortunately, this meal was not appetizing at all!  I was excited about it being so easy, but couldn't get over the horrible smell that came from this meal.  While the chicken itself was ok, the "soup" it was in was not.  Kept thinking I had done something wrong, but I hadn't.  This meal went in the trash.

Really delicious...
I followed the tips from another reviewer and added 2 cups of fresh cranberries in addition to the canned. It came out perfect...not too sweet, with a hint of tang left in the cranberries. I omitted the salad dressing and added 1/3 cup water to the soup mix; when the fresh cranberries cook down, they release a fair bit of water.

I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 3 breast halves as I was not sure about it.  I wanted to try it because it looked simple and I love cranberry sauce.  But no one in my family really liked the finished product of this unusual combination of ingredients.  The cranberry taste is completely lost in the Catalina and onion soup flavor.  I shredded the finished cooked chicken and served it on buns.  The chicken had a vinegary taste, somewhat reminiscent of barbecue.  We all agreed that while it was edible, we like traditional barbecued chicken much much better than this.  I will not make this again.

This recipe was OK but I would prefer to grill the chicken next time then brush with the sauce. Or warm the sauce on its own and use it for dipping, etc.  It is very sweet and rich.  Will try a lighter version next time.

We've had this recipe for years, except we bake it in an oven until done.  The name of our recipe is "Tasting is Believing Chicken", because of the wierd ingredient combination.  It goes good with a nice rice pilaf.

I had to try this because it sounded so strange, and it turned out... weird. It was sort of like sweet and sour chicken. If I made this again I think I would serve it with broccoli and rice for sort of a Chinese feel.

I made this per the original recipe and followed all the directions as written.  The flavor was good but the presentation lacks.  The cranberries break down and are lost in the dressing.  I now know why there is no picture of this recipe once finished.  Very uber easy to throw together and forget for 6 hours.  I will be using all the leftover chicken for possible chicken enchiladas as my guests didn't eat much.  I would suggest making homemade cranberry sauce but I couldn't as cranberries are in our markets here yet.  I used the store brand and wished I used the name brand.  Maybe some of the cranberries would have stayed whole.

I made this for dinner tonight.  I followed the recipe exactly and I loved it!!!.  It is easy to put together, low cost, and delicious to boot.  What a great fall meal is what my husband said.  My son, was here for dinner, asked what was in it I told him whole cranberry sauce he said yuk, he wasn't eatting.  After he tasted it, he also said it was delish!! (he is not a child by any stretch) lol.  Served over rice with a salad.  Perfecto!!!

I have been making Cranberry Chicken (this recipe ) in the oven for 25+ years - it was my moms recipe.  

I never thought to try it in the slow cooker!  Will definitely try.  Only have done it with both chicken parts and breasts - in the oven the breasts will dry out if you overcook.  Can imaging in the slow cooker.  

Another tip - if you marinate the chicken in the sauce overnight it is even more flavorful.

The only reason I gave this recipe 2 stars was in case I did something wrong. My chicken turned out kind of gross. I don't want to use this recipe again.

While this is easy & flavorful the oven version tastes better in my opinion.  These amounts create a lot of sauce and works well for 8 or so pieces of chicken. I’ve been making this for years. The original versions were called Funky Chicken. Some called for Catalina dressing, others French. I got the recipe from my mother-in- law 40+ years ago after she made it for us one evening.  (Use drummettes/and or chicken wings for a great appetizer!)

Very quick and easy recipe to prepare.

Ladled some of the sauce (after removing chicken) strained it, and added it to a saucepan, with a teaspoon of melted butter and a teaspoon of flour combined. Nice gravy over mashed potatoes and green beans.

Made as is except bone in breasts. It was delicious. Not quite like bbq, not quite sweet and sour; similar, but something quite unique! It was a bit greasy, so I skimmed it off and added cornstarch to thicken. Makes way too much sauce, but it’s really  good mixed with rice. Will make again.

I wish that I hadn't waited so long to try this; it was fantastic. As others suggested, I used only 8 ounces of the dressing, and I think that was a wise revision. I chose to slow bake bone-in thighs and wings in a glass baking dish, sealed with foil, at 190°. After they were tender, about 5 hours, I carefully moved them to a broiler pan, and broiled them a few minutes to brown the skin. I thickened the sauce with corn starch. Very tasty, and will definitely make it again.

This recipe is flavorful and easy. What more could you ask for? I made it exactly according to the recipe and it turned out great. I served it over spaghetti  with Brussels sprouts as a side dish and it made for a wonderful dinner. The sauce is great over pasta. I saved the remaining sauce to serve over pasta for another meal.

Turned out great. Added pineapples like someone suggestion. I liked it but it's quite sweet and my fiancé didn't enjoy it as much as I did. He ended up leaving a bit of chicken and I could tell he didn't really like it. I won't be making it again since like I said it's a bit sweet an unique but this recipe was correct and I'm glad I made it just because it was different and easy to make.

I made this but prepped and froze 6 more servings for later. I mixed the 8oz Catalina dressing, 15oz whole cranberry sauce, and packet of onion soup mix. Placed 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (1 whole, split) in a freezer bag and poured about 1 cup of the sauce mixture over the chicken and froze. The sauce was enough to make 8 servings.  I thaw and place in baking pan. Pre heat oven to 350 degrees and bake 45 minutes. Add a pan of roasted veggies and you have a wonderful meal.

This was SO easy to make! I did throw the chicken in the bottom of the crock pot frozen (in a big, frozen-together chunk no less!) with everything else on top and cooked for 1 and a half hours on high then switched to low for  4 more hours.  Worked like a charm! I also used chicken tenderloins but other than that I followed the recipe. It was very sweet so I wouldn't make it very often but since it's so simple and not half bad, I'll keep this recipe on hand. The sauce reminded me of Chinese restaurant sweet and sour sauce.

Followed recipe with a few minor changes, had 5 chicken breasts instead of 4. Used Kraft Asian Sesame dressing instead of Catalina. Served over brown long grain rice. The chicken just tore apart it was so moist, the sauce in the slow cooker was great on the rice. Great flavours, will do this again and again. Very easy!

Very good! So simple a eight year old could do it...and, I had my eight year old grandson assemble it.  He was very proud to serve us this tasty dinner over rice.  He also made the rice in my rice cooker! You got to get them working in the kitchen early! Some day he'll cook for a happy wife.  Happy wife - Happy Life!

I made this exactly as the recipe says. Chicken was very good and tender. I might cut the sauce part in half next time, a lot of left over sauce, or add something to thicken it, it was very liquidy.

I changed one thing - I used an 8 oz. bottle of Catalina dressing instead of 16 oz.  It's what I had on hand, and I believe I've seen this recipe before written that way.  It's great with 8 oz., and it made plenty of sauce for 3 breasts and 4 or 5 thighs.  I cooked a bit longer than the recipe stated since the thighs were bone-in.  Served over mashed potatoes, and it was great.  Love the way the house smells while it's cooking, too!

I followed the recipe, but used it on a pork roast.  My wife liked it well enough, but I found the "gravy" to be too sweet and rich.  I won't make it again, unless asked.  There are better ways.

Great reviews, I was concerned adding in catilina dressing because we seem dependent  on prepared foods full of sugar and other unhealthy ingredients, so when I saw the review that left out the dressing and added fresh berries I could see this recipe change to one I would try.  Thanks!

Told my family I was going to the store and what did they want me to get…my 13 year-old son asked me to “get the stuff to make that new chicken.”  His thoughts were not about snack food but about this chicken dish.    My family loved this simple recipe…the leftovers were fought over.  My family prefers dark meat so this time will try with thighs.  Did not use the slow cooker as my work day is too long according to directions.   I followed advice from other reviews and put in oven at 375 until done, (about 45 minutes) other than that I did not change a thing.  Delicious and very easy week day dinner.

This was good, and we would repeat it.  It was a bit of an odd combination, but was a tasty suprise.  I made enough for 2 dinners and it was better the first day.

This turned out great!  Fantastic flavor that somehow doesn't taste too much like cranberries or catalina dressing.  And as always, using the crock pot meant no dry chicken.  Definitely a new staple.  Thanks!

Just made this using a whole deboned chicken. We don't like the smell in the house, nor the taste. Now I'm trying to doctor it to make it edible so I don't waste a whole chicken.

Based on the reviews I made a few adjustments, while sticking with the main recipe. I used 4 large chicken breasts and cut them in half, (1) can of cranberry sauce + 2 cups of fresh cranberries, last 1 packet of dry onion soup mix with 2/3 water. With a wisk mix together the onion mix and cranberry sauce then pour over chicken. adding the whole cranberries on top. I cooked in the slow cooker for 4 hours on low heat (or until cooked through). Super easy prep!

Made it for company very disappointing.  The sauce was delicious but the chicken was dry and stringy.  Texture reminded me of pulled pork.

I am really impressed with this chicken. The only thing I changed was the pieces of meat. I used leg quarters,  I did separate them. Sorry I forgot to take a pic.

Simple, simple, simple, for a saturday meal while we're mowing the yard, etc. I did add a little schiracha to cut the sweetness. Others are correct - too much sauce. I also thought is was too liquid, so with 30 minutes left, I reduced 2 cups of the sauce by about half and got a much thicker, tasty reduction for chicken and rice.

This was very, very good. I made per the directions but cut it in half  as there are only two of us. We still have plenty to make sandwiches tomorrow. I do not usually like barbecue,  it after making dinner for sixty years I was desperate for something different, so tried this. As I said, very good, will be making this again soon.

I followed this recipe pretty much word for word.  I used a 2.5 pound bag of wings instead of breast.  I like sweet and spicy,  so once I assembled the ingredients in the slow cooker,  I dusted the top with cayenne.  I thought the recipe was very bland.  It was not bad,  just maybe ok.  I won't be making it again.

Such an easy dish to put together. I did thicken the sauce a bit on the stove by adding a little cornstarch. Served chicken and sauce with rice. Shredded leftovers and served on a bun for dinner the next night.

Love this recipe. Tastes good and the house smells of Thanksgiving while it cooks. Because I have to watch my carbs I made two changes. Cut back on the dressing (major source of the sugars and calories) and I added a sliced onion to the mix. The taste still had the pop (my wife says halfway between BBQ and Sloppy Joes). There was plenty of moisture to get the chicken cooking, and of course I went light on the sauce, and skipped the rice and reduced my serving a bit. Dinner came in at two carb exchanges.

Amazingly delicious!!  I did not have breasts, so subbed thighs, legs and wings.. The flavor was perfect.  The sauce was a little thinner than I would have liked.. but it did not matter for the flavors were well blended!!  Served with steamed rice and topped that with the sauce!  Great dish, for any time of the year!!

Half way through the cooking time I added a cup and a half of long grain rice and let it cool in the broth. Yum. Thinking that the next time I make it I'll add some cut up green peppers and onions and possibly pineapple making a sweet and sour dish. Will update when I do.

I made this exactly to the recipe, it was delicious. I don’t have a slow cooker, so I did this in a cast iron pot,  stove top for 5 hours, I also made rice from the recipe offered just below chicken recipe, it came out perfectly. This will definitely go on my favorites list!!!

I use pork chops.  I was doubtful about the dressing and the cranberry sauce together.   But it was very good over penne.   I love a meal this easy that cleans up so well in the slow cooker

I used lite Catalina dressing. The chicken was very tender.  It’s an easy dish and tasty.  My daughter loved it and asked for it to be served over rice so she could enjoy the sauce.

Made several changes that really turned out well, but plan on extra time and ingredients. Instead of onion soup mix, I sweated onion, shallot, and garlic. Being summer, I pitted and halved some fresh sweet red cherries and added about them about half  way through cooking.  Tossed in some raisins and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Will definitely make again. Next time, instead of cherries, I’m going to try crushed pineapple.

This was very tasty and easy to make, but it had too much liquid.   A whole bottle of Catalina wasn't necessary, and I had a lot of sauce left over.

. We did several things that could have been wrong but should not have made that much difference. 
We put it together early in the morning and left to go out of town. While it was made straight from the recipe we did use boneless breast and because they were so large we cut them in half. On low they cooked for about 8 hours, too long I know but the mixture came out bitter. Yes the chicken was a bit over cooked but the onion soup mix had made everything have a sour bite that hit the back of your tongue in a bad way. The berries were cooked away and would have made a nice gravy but for the soup mix. I have had overcooked things from a slow cooker before and nothing ever came out as bad as this. 
I may make it again in the future but it will be a long time and I wont use an entire packet of soup mix.

I read the reviews & added the crushed pineapple someone suggested, also added 1/4 lb dried cranberries......not sure I would use this as a gravy but it makes a delicious compote to serve over ice cream or just to eat alone.

I haven't used my crockpot for a while,  so bringing it out since that last Superbowl nosh I whipped up was worth making this yummy dish.
Very simple and I actually had all the ingredients on hand, even adding some pineapple too.
My chicken really shrunk though and it became rather liquidlike, so I added a little cornstarch. 
That helped. I put it over white rice...
It was very flavorful. 
I would make it again.

i used French dressing instead of Catalina. It's a bit more savory. This is a fabulous recipe! Actually have not done it in the slow cooker - usually use a 9x13 pan, mix all ingredients in the pan, then place chicken in the mixture, spooning the sauce over the chicken pieces. Into the oven at 350° for about 50 minutes. Serve over rice. YUM!

Taste was great but next time I will cut way back on the Catalina dressing.  I had a full pot of soup and had to fish through it to find the chicken.  I used 5 really large Chicken breasts which are very tasty but the soup couldn't possibly be used over mashed potatoes but was okay over rice.  Next time I will use a cup of dressing and see if that works better.

I had great expectations for this recipe.  I was disappointed.  The three flavors didn’t meld like I thought they would.   The sauce had a strange taste.  I used brand names for the dressing and soup mix and a store brand fir the whole berry cranberry sauce.  Maybe I should try again.

One of the best easy prep sure-fire tasty meals I have discovered in years!  The chicken is so moist and the sauce is perfect over rice.  We cut the breasts in half and try to limit our consumption in order to get two meals out of the one cooking but it didn't work - we ate the whole thing.

Chicken was a little dry being in the cooker for six hours on low.  Five would have been better.

it was blah.  The chicken was tasteless and there was no sauce---just a ton of bland juice.  I put the juice in a saucepan to cook it down----didn't help.  It sounded good but was not.

This is delicious. Chicken turned out tender and flavorful. Sauce was perfect. I made my Catalina sauce because store bought brand has high fructose corn syrup. I will definitely do this again

I followed the directions exactly. The chicken was very moist and fell apart as I was removing it from the slow cooker. Cooked it for 4 hours on low but probably was done in about 3 1/2. Beware of the salt for you people with high pressure. Tastes delicious. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing

Ok, I will admit that I didn't think that this was going to be a good recipe because the ingredients seemed "odd", but the idea of chicken plus three ingredients in a crock pot had me intrigued.  Holy moly!  This is now one of my husband's favorite recipes and he even said that it was one of the most flavorful ways he has ever eaten chicken.  I will even put this on the list for company the next time we have someone over for dinner.

This is an excellent dish...it's equally good made with either chicken breasts or pork chops.  And to think I've been baking this same dish in the oven for years...it's so much easier to make it in the crockpot!

I have been making this recipe for YEARS using Kraft sweet and spicy dressing, which became difficult to find, so have switched to Russian Dressing. So simple and so delicious!! I baked mine in the oven instead of using the crockpot.

I liked it a lot but I think using the Catalina dressing will make it better (I had Russian on hand).  Also throw in a bag of frozen peas and carrots and you can be all done in about 5 min.

Made 8 chicken breasts (4 large, 4 small) and used amount of sauce called for in recipe.   Came out perfect.  Cooked longer than recipe called for so large chicken breasts were falling apart.  Took out some of the juice/sauce and thickened with cornstarch in small pan on stove to serve over chicken.  Served with baked sweet potatoes.  Delicious

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It was amazing!  I would serve it over rice the next time I make it.

Followed the directions almost exactly.  Someone suggested catalina with bacon.  I used it instead and wow!  It was awesome!

As some other reviewers mentioned, I found the  dish had a peculiar smell to it. Used boneless chicken thighs and added the fresh cranberries. Only used 8 oz of the Catalina dressing and still found it too watery. Wasn't bad, but won't be making this again.

I was very skeptical about the combination of the ingredients, but decided to try it anyway, hoping for another quick, easy yet scrumptious slow cooker recipe. I was delighted and will make it again! I also like the idea of making it with pork chops or a pork loin roast. I decided to put it over a bed of creamed spinach and the combination was heavenly!

I enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe. The sauce was a little runny, I might cut back on the dressing or add more cranberry sauce next time. I used boneless pork chops, tasted very nice.

I made this for dinner about four days ago. I am waiting until now to write my review because I really wanted to take the time to think about why this recipe turned out so poorly. 

What I can tell you is that my chicken was dry in the middle (how often does this happen?) and the flavors of the three other ingredients did not blend together at all while cooking. Additionally, the author says you use the liquid as a sauce, but it was so oily and watery that it was not much of a sauce at all for rice or potatoes. I have never used a four star recipe on here before that so was not!

SO good! Can't wait to eat leftovers. Will be passing this on to my Mother. Wouldn't change a thing. Had the sauce over mashed potatoes and everyone had seconds.

I really did not like this recipe AT ALL. It was dry, burnt and the flavors together did not mix. I will not make this one again unfortunately...because with only 4 ingredients, it sure would be nice to make again! Sorry for everyone who loved it...just not for me.

This seemed like a good recipe but it was far too sweet and tangy for me.  Its missing an element of creaminess or richness to it.  Perhaps next time I will swap out the Catalina dressing for cream of chicken soup. I think it would pair well with cranberry sauce.

Awesome flavor.  The chicken breast was super dry, but I think I let it cook for too long.  Serving the sauce with mashed potatoes is a MUST!  It went well with Tangy Broccoli from this site.  Wonderful meal!
