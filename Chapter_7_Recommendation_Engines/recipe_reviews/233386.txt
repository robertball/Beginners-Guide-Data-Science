Love it! I prefer to soften the broccoli a little by steaming, but this is a personal preference. It tastes even better the next day. The recipe is perfect!

The combination of ingredients was ok except the vinegar.  I would have preferred less vinegar and more sugar. :)

A very good broccoli salad that we thoroughly enjoyed, even my DH who isn't crazy about raw broccoli.   I mixed the dressing up the night before so that the sugar would be totally dissolved when I was ready to use it.  In the morning I mixed the broccoli, red onion and dressing together.  About 30 minutes before dinner I added the cheese, bacon and sunflower seeds.  At first I was a little worried as the salad seemed a little dry.  But it was perfect when we had at dinner time.  My DH even packed the leftovers for his lunch.  It is the first broccoli salad that I've made (and, I've made many) that he's really enjoyed.  I think it was that everything was coated with dressing, but not excess dressing.  I did only use 3 TBS of white vinegar, and that is the same amount I will use next time.  Served this with 'Ham and Pineapple Kabobs' from AR.  Thanks Magesse, for sharing your recipe.

Everyone loved it. I substituted craisins for raisins and pumpkin seeds for sunflower seeds. I will add this to our favorites!!

I'm a single guy and made this without no trouble, I followed the instructions to a T and it came out delicious. Great option for a salad side.

The picture on this recipe is from my house... 

(sorry about the poor color quality, my phone camera isn't that great!)

This slaw turned out great, and I got lots of compliments at our church Thanksgiving fellowship!

I made some adjustments according to what I had on hand... I used red onion instead of yellow, and I used frozen broccoli. I also used golden raisins, and I skipped the sunflower seeds. I think chopped & toasted pecans would be even better. For the dressing I didn't use measurements, but I think it was about 1 cup mayo, 1 tbs vinegar, and probably a little over a tbs of sugar.
