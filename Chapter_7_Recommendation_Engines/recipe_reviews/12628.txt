I didn't like this recipe at all. The filling wound up being a pile of mush and it wasn't much like a pie at all. Maybe it would suit somebody else's taste better but my family didn't care for it.

Yummers! I was a little leary about how a potato would end up tasting in a spinach pie but these ingredients all work out really GOOD together! Good job Jen!
