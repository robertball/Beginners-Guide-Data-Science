My husband loved this, and I was surprised at how flavorful it was without broth.  The cabbage and spices really make it nice with the ham.  I did not add greens the first time but am adding some to the batch I'm making now.  I agree with one reviewer though, you need MUCH more than just 1 cup of water...I just add enough to make sure it's all covered.  A keeper in this house!

We thought it was going to be bland, turned out we wrong. It is not spicy, but, very, very tasty. We really enjoyed it. Serve with a Rye bread for a filling meal.  The ham I used was Black Forest-organic. The ham is a big part of this dish. Get the best quality ham you can, you won't regret it.
The salt I added was 1/2 tsp. and ground up a bunch of black pepper. It wasn't salty, which I thought it was going to be.
All around great recipe-Thanks

has a good flavor but with all the other ingrecients found that 1c. water was not enough liquid for the end results. You need more like 2-3 cups of liquid

This is really delicious. All those healthy vegetables and a perfect spice combination result in a very satisfying stew that tastes even better the next day. I probably shouldn't have used red cabbage, however, because the entire meal turned an unappetizing shade of purple! My mistake. It's what I had in the fridge, but I'll stick with green cabbage next time : )

I made this dish last night and absolutely loved it.
I had some left over ham, carrots and celery and did a search, found this and sounded yummy...got the rest of the ingedients and turned out just wonderfully.
I highly recommend this on a cold chilly night.
Good job...thanks so much!

We finally tried this last night, and we loved it! I didn't realize that I didn't have carraway seed until I started making it. To add flavor I put some ground clove in it which I loved but was a bit much for my husband. I'd try less next time. I also took the advise of many and added more liquid & chicken broth (I love Mrs.Knorr's powdered chicken broth seasoning). Will definitely be making this again!
**UPDATE** we made this again with the carraway seed and no clove - it was so delicious - one of our favorite recipes :)

Very flavorful.  The ham, cabbage and caraway reminded me of a corned beef flavor.  My husband admitted it wasn't appealing to look at.  Maybe it would be more appealing if the cabbage and onions were chopped into larger pieces.

A quick, flavorful and filling meal. Snowed in one afternoon, I looked to All Recipes to find a dish for the ingredients I had on hand. We were quite happy with this dish, I had to substitute a sweet potato for white and used baby spinach for the greens. We will be making this again and again.

This was a wonderful and hearty stew.  It's a great way to use cabbage and greens.  It was simple to make.  I don't use caraway a lot, but I loved the flavor it gave to this dish.  Thanks!

I tweeked this recipe alittle b/c I didn't have the additional greens. I just added additional cabbage. Celery salt is a good trade-off depending on how salty the ham is already. I was unsure about the carrots and potatoes cooking thoroughly, so I added about 10  more minutes esp. w/ the extra cabbage. Overall a great dish and will cook again w/ the greens.

What a great Fall dish!  Potatoes definitely need to be cut large.  I wanted to speed up cooking time so I cut the potatoes a bit smaller and ended up with mashed potato stew BUT the flavor was still fantastic. Love that caraway kick.  A definite keeper, YUM!

I'm sorry, this wasn't for me.  I just didn't care for the spices in it.  I also didn't have a liquid problem.  Cabbage creates water.  I chopped the carrots, literally.  One of the photos I looked at, the pieces were very large.  I subbed zuc for the green bc I didn't have any but other than that, followed the recipe.

Great base recipe.  Like others, added more liquid (used low sodium chicken broth).  After sauteing the onion and garlic, just threw everything into the pot (except spinach) and let it simmer.  I think the caraway seed makes it!  Added a bit of grated nutmeg with the spinach and a squirt of siracha for a little more color and spice.  Smells and tastes wonderful!  Will chunk up and freeze some of the leftover holiday ham to make this soup again!  Comes together easily, too!

First off -- like other reviewers, I added more liquid (1 cup chicken stock + 3 cups water.)  Other than that, I kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  The flavor reminded me of a New England Boiled Dinner.  Simple yet delicious flavors, and very healthy.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe -- it is already a favorite when served with whole grain french bread!

This was really good and filling. I didn't have cabbage so I used navy beans. I didn't have red onion just used yellow and left out the caraway seed.

This was very good, I subbed cooked ground sausage for the ham and at the very end I added a couple of handfuls of cherry tomatoes,some fresh basil,  and a can of kidney beans undrained. this added a nice bit of color and flavor. We absolutely loved this!

Just made this for supper on this cold rainy day with homemade bread and it was wonderful!  I used all ingredients the recipe called for but had to add a little more water. Still have spinach & cabbage in the garden so that worked out well.  Do not leave out the caraway seed, it really gave it a wonderful flavor.  Will definately make again!

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but it isn't as good as I thought it would be. First off, it needs way more than 1 cup of water to simmer everything and not burn it. That's ok, but there was almost NO flavor, despite only using enough water to barely cover everything. I had to add a lot of extra seasonings to get any taste to this. Oh well. It was worth a try!

Delicious! This recipe is a definite keeper.  I usually try recipes the first time as written, but I did have to compromise a few things based on what I had in the house. I used fennel seed instead of caraway seed, turkey ham cubed, a bit more water and 2 small heads of cabbage instead of cabbage and greens.  I also added a few bouillon cubes for more flavor. It turned out fantastic!

We loved this Stew..  It was very filling and delicious.  I did not have any greens, or coriander, but I will get some for the next time.  I added a lot more water and used my chicken bouillon and some Ham seasoning from Goya too.  Served with cheese and croutons.

Yummy, hearty stew packed full of vegetables. Made this is my dutch oven. I had some saved up greens of leeks leftover so used them instead of the onion. I also substituted the caraway seeds with a star anise I had on hand. If you keep it covered as you simmer there is almost enough liquid. But because you can add more or less veggies, adding more liquid would work well too.

This was great, and super quick for a busy weeknight.  I used a bag of coleslaw mix for the cabbage, and stirred in a cup of half and half just before serving.  Great way to clear out the veggie drawer!

I had to buy pancetta to sub for the ham because that’s all they had at the store and I didn’t have time to make another stop. I cooked the pancetta first, then added the garlic, onions, and carrots. I don’t have celery salt so I added about 1/3c diced celery. Added paprika and caraway and let that cook up for a bit. Then added the potatoes and 4 cups chicken broth brought to a boil then simmered for 10 mons. Added the cabbage and mixed greens (kale, chard, and spinach). Came out pretty good but wouldn’t use the pancetta again. Next time I might also add a can of great northern beans.

I should have known better! There were so many 5 start reviews, I thought maybe I was wrong, but unfortunately I wasn't. I gave 3 starts because it is at least healthy but it's lacking in flavor big time. I even doubled the spices and still meh. If you're a meat and potatoes kinda person you might like this, but I prefer more spice or at least more flavor.

I always double this recipe because my family loves this! The only thing I do differently is use the rest of the ham & the bone from a previous nights dinner. So much more economical. I'll throw a celery stalk or two if I have on hand too.

I made this for dinner today. I used all the leftovers from our St Patrick Day boiled dinner Thursday. But I used a ham steal instead of the corned beef. I think it was delicious but agree that it needs 3 cups of water. I used spinach as my greens.

No changes here!  This is a very simple, yet Delicious meal. I will absolutely make it again.  Next time I will probably add more cabbage.

I didn't have any ham, so I used sausage.  I also added celery.  Very nice stew.

We really liked this. I'd call it a soup instead of a stew since the base is a broth, but that's just me. Used celery flakes because that's what I had instead of celery seed. Added a whole cabbage because we love cabbage. A hit with everyone.

When finished cooking, there isn't much broth, but the taste was still excellent.  It could be eaten with a fork.  Both my husband and I liked it, and it was so healthy all in one dish.

I love these kinds of dinners.  Not too much fuss and something everyone (in "my" family) can agree on.  I love adding (hiding, rather) different vegetables when I make things like this.  It's a great springboard to whatever your family prefers.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! We used about half as much ham because that's all we had.  What an excellent dinner for a lazy spring afternoon!  Very healthy, low calorie and full of flavor, what more can you ask? 

Also, I had everything on hand that was called for, so no problem.  Used smoked sweet paprika and Swiss Chard greens for the green.  

I did have to add a little more water along the way, but that's no major disaster.

My husband and I really liked this soup!  After reading reviews, I added 2 additional cups of chicken broth to make it more soupy and also tripled the seasonings due to the extra broth.  Tasted very good!

Used sauerkraut instead of cabbage and cumin instead of caraway seed and still turned out delicious. I also omitted the greens. Hubby loved it!!

Excellent stew, very filling and flavorful. I was worried that it would be bland and considered adding chicken broth, but it wasn't needed. The spices were perfect. I used half potatoes and half sweet potatoes, and added a can of white cannellini beans. I also used white onions and bok choy instead of cabbage. 

Next time I will double the recipe as it only made enough for one meal for my family. I served it with sourdough bread and parmesan cheese.

Made this tonight with some leftover ham I found in the freezer.  Used yellow onion, garlic, leftover ham, purple cabbage, potato, sweet potato, carrots, celery, swiss chard (no spinach).  I didn't have caraway so I left it out.  It did need 2 cups of water.  It was delicious and hearty.  Not the best looking meal, but SO tasty!  A good adaptable recipe.

Great hearty stew for a fall night!  We loved the flavor but made some modifications - my husband 
braised three ham hocks in the pan before we started the recipe, we doubled the spices, and we used about 4 cups of water. It turned out fantastastic! Next time we will double the carrots. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

Excellent recipe!  I recommend using at least 3 cups of liquid; I used low sodium chicken broth.  The whole family enjoyed this one!

Thank you for posting this recipe! I first tried this because I needed to find ways to finish off the Christmas ham. I made this for some picky eaters and very good and experienced cooks and they all loved it. It was a very easy dish to make. I have made this several times using just a ham steak cut into small squares. I chose the spinach for the packed greens and the only thing I did different was I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of 1 cup of water. This is a dish that everyone should give a try. You will not be disappointed. Thanks again!!

I used maple cured ham steak, and the stew turned out with a slight sweet taste which was delightful. I was skeptical about the cabbage AND spinach, but it cooked down, thankfully.

For starters the taste is exceptional, a really nice blend of taste and textures.  I might try cutting the potatoes into big cubes and slow down my cooking just a bit more.  Had no problem with the liquid, perhaps the slow cooking style retained more moisture.  Used escarole for my green and it contrasted the cabbage rather nicely.  Erin Go Bragh!

I loved this stew because the caraway seeds gave it a unique flavor. Definitely not the same old thing.  The veggies were nice and soft for my infant to eat.  Didn't change a thing.

Used slightly different ingredients, but still great results.  My husband looked at me when he was finished and said "Did you say this has cabbage in it?"  Thanks!
