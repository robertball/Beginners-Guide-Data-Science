Really good and special. I made it per ingredients. Since I'm super busy and caring for a sick mate, I used the bread machine on it's dough cycle (1 hour, 28 minutes) to make the dough and do the first rise. Then took the dough out of machine, formed it and did the rest as Chef John demonstrates. After baking in the oven, I brushed melted butter on sides and bottom and toasted on gas grill because I made foot long buns (don't have a big enough skillet for foot longs). Family loved them. Light, tasty, crisp outside, not at all like a "regular" hot dog bun. These smell wonderful. These take a hot dog way beyond an ordinary hot dog. Although Chef John prefers just mustard on his, I dressed these up the Chicago style way. Even added the poppy seeds on half the buns I made (without seeds on the others). Whatever toppings you add to your hot dogs, I think this may be one of those things you have to try before you die.

Super easy recipe, and yum! The first time I tried this, I made 8 buns as indicated by the amount of servings. The buns were a bit too big for hot dogs but would work well for something larger like sausages. Since then, I've started making 12 buns from the same amount of dough, and I get the perfect size buns that way.

Really easy to follow recipe.  There is a split-top pan available through King Arthur Flour.  This is how all hot dog, lobster, and clam rolls are served when I was growing up on the East Coast.  There is nothing like having the bun toasted, inside and out, filled with fried clams or lobster salad or a grilled hot dog or sausage!

I've made this recipe and chef Johns hamburger bun recipe,  these are by far the best dog and Burger buns I and my family have ever eaten.  Didn't change a thing, I learned many years ago at the hands of my dear mom that baking is an art,  change something in a great recipe and you run the chance of ruining the whole mess. Thank you Chef John for sharing this recipe with us.

I loved these - they are so good.  Light and fluffy inside with a nice buttery crust.  I had a hot dog a little while ago and I'm fighting the urge to go eat another bun all by itself.

These did not really work for me. They came out dry and the texture dense. I prefer a light and airy bun. Maybe it was something I did or the weather conditions. Since there are so many stellar reviews it was probably something I did! Don't let this review deter you from trying it! It was probably an error on my part!

This recipe was fantastic!!!  They were very easy to make and the taste was fabulous!!!  I did watch the video in order to ensure I formed them properly and that was very helpful.  I followed the instructions to a "T" and did not change a thing. Once you try these you'll never want to eat a bagged bun again!

Great flavour. I messed them up though. I had made the dough too flat and tried to reshape it....you can't do that.  Doesn't end well. The dough itself was easy to get to the perfect consistency,  and it was beautiful.  I'll try again now that I have learned what not to do.  Im thinking I'll use this recipe for bread sticks too.

Couple tips if you are going to follow this recipe. I would say increase the proportions. Why would you only make 8 buns? If you are putting in the time to make buns from scratch, I would want AT LEAST 12. If you have some extra, share them with friends and co-workers, its very little extra work and very appreciated by all. 

Secondly, I would increase the time of the second rise, Personally I doubled it. This gives you much nice, light buns, rather than dense hockey pucks.

20 minutes seemed to be about perfect.

I only had time to let the dough rise for half an hour before I shaped the buns and let them rise for another half hour, but it still turned out fantastic.  So delicious, I'll be making these again and again.

Excellent recipe. It has inspired me to order a New England Hot Dog Bun pan, and I will never have to eat the store bought kind again.

The flour to water ratio is off causing a very dry stiff dough after only adding 2 cups flour. The instruction also omit the other half cup of water left over from making the yeast mixture. IMHO I recommend using 1.5 cups water for 3.5 cups flower. Dont forget to add the remaining water to your dough mixture.

I made these buns  in a New England hot dog bun pan and the dough was just perfect for the pan.  Wonderful and soft.  Baked 20 minutes at 375.

Made exactly as written. My first try, and other than imperfect shape, they were really good! Help up to bbq ham and bbq little smokies. No doggy buns! Hubby says no more store bought, please.

This is a great  recipe, however, I managed to make the guys too big.  The next time I will roll them out 5” x 3” since rising causes it to grow exponentially!  The taste and texture are great, a keeper of a recipe.  The mistake was totally my own.  I’m still a newbie here.

I always have a big of these and Chef John’s hamburger buns in the freezer. Easy and utterly delicious. I do find that the quality of flour affects the outcome of the buns. When I cheap out (which I have to do periodically), the buns don’t shape up as well. Nevertheless, they’re always delicious. I’ve even over-risen them, resulting in large holed sponges. Great tasting sponges. My family still gobbled them down.

I've baked weekly for years--not an expert but fairly experienced.  I made exactly as directed, and my results looked exactly as the video, down to the bounce and wiggle.

These were very spongy and soft, but the sponge is dense and it doesn't really compress.  It didn't adapt to the shape of the fillings at all and trying to keep it closed ensured the "hinge" ripped on all of them.  They were also very heavy in the sense of overly rich for me.  I love butter and usually toast hot dog buns before eating, but this just crossed the line to greasy.

It's trouble getting hot dog buns here in Tokyo and I suspected these would taste night and day better being fresh from the oven but,a little let-down, not much different from usual

Finally we had extra-long hot dogs but  these were enormous buns.  If I try again, I'll be making 12 not 8.

I assumed that these would be harder to make than this. As it turns out, this took no time at all and the finished product was AMAZING! I have been on this healthy (well, healthier anyway) kick and started making my own bread products. Since then I cannot even walk down the bread isle of the super market because their "bread" smells awful. This was the first time I have attempted to make my own hot dog buns and I was not disappointed. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is a simple and delicious recipe. The video made it easy to follow the step-by-step directions. My only complaint would be that these are way too huge for a normal sized hotdog; the ratio seemed off between meat and bread. I didn’t make any alterations to the ingredients and I won’t next time I make these since it has everything it needs. What I will alter is how many this can make- 8 is what is called for, but 10 might be the preferred amount by me. Thanks for sharing Chef John!

I made this into hot dog buns and found them to be too salty. I later made them into hamburger buns and cut the salt in half and they tasted great.

I made this recipe in my bread machine just for mixing and kneading, took it out to rise for two hours in an oiled bowl and followed the rest of the recipe.  Perfect!  I am going to use this recipe for hamburger rolls.  Thanks.  P.S. My husband loved them

Easy to make and tasted very good. I divided the dough into 8 buns as the recipe says but mine came out very large. Next time I will either divide into ten buns or buy larger hot dogs. The upside was that they tasted good enough that nobody minded the extra.

I made it just to try it and succeed, Chef John hotdog recipe, but I used the New England baking pan because I wanted them to be exactly like the Montreal hotdogs. "Toasted sides, split on top" which I can't get in Miami unless I order them online for 15$ bucks, Not Thank. I used the Publix buns for many years but they are not always perfect and have to cut away some of the sides to make it work.
I'm making another batch today, but this time I will leave the dough over night in the fridge to give the yeast extra time to eat and get more flavor. This time I will cut off a fist size piece of dough so it doesn't rise above the pan when baking. I guess the olive oil in the ingredients was for the dough to proof in.
I baked my buns in 325 deg oven convection and they browned perfectly in 20 minutes.

Thx Chef John

I didn't make any changes, but I will the next time.   I made eight buns as called for, but there was too much dough and the buns were far too big and heavy.  That's the only reason for 4 instead of five stars. Taste was great.

What a great, easy recipe. These turned out beautifully! I can't believe that I've been buying hot dog buns in a store all these years when these take so little effort to make at home!

I have made these several times now & while they do take a little bit of time it is worth it.  They turn out very well & if you take the time to let them rise properly they will be light & airy also.  I will definitely use this recipe every time I need any hot dog buns.  They have a wonderful taste as well!

The only thing I changed was I only use one teaspoon of salt.  My wife loves them, no more store bought for us. Thank you Chef John,  going to try french rolls next.

Great bun recipe! Soft, tender, delish!  Love that I can customize the size, as I had some natural casing link "chubs" from our local meat purveyor, which I could never find buns to fit.  I was able to make the perfect bun to fit these.  I also like that I can toast them to get that perfect buttery goodness on all sides!  Can't wait to use these for lobster/shrimp rolls.  Thanks Chef John!

I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews but my rolls did not turn out that well.  My rolls were very dense. I don't know what I did wrong, I've made bread/dinner rolls before.  I may try 1 more time but if anyone has any tips on what may have gone wrong I'd welcome them.
