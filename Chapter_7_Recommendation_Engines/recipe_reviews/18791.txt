An overall tasty dish. The recipe calls for rotisserie chicken which I believe is VERY unnecessary given what is done to the chicken later. I cooked 2 chicken breasts on my George Foreman, (yes the Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine) and the dish turned out wonderful. I also made a few more changes: used 2 onions instead of 1, added garlic and 1/2 lb. of sliced mushrooms to the onions as they sauteed. These changes were based upon previous reviews. The cooking time may need to be adjusted as well. I found that the broth was not absorbed in the 20 minutes it suggested so I had to cook it for about 30 minutes. I plan on making this many, many times.

Very good but the writer forgot a very important step, you need to have the wine and the broth at a simmer when you add it to the rice, otherwise you get sticky rice instead of creamy, smooth rice.  I added 1 cup sliced cremini mushrooms and increased the chicken to 3 cups.

This recipe is wonderful if you have the time to make the risotto.  I used 5 1/2 cups of broth rather than the 7 called for and it turned out well.  In addition, I added porcini mushrooms and a can of artichoke hearts, drained and chopped, which made for great consistency.  Excellent!!!!

This was absolutely delicious.  I don't know why I was always so scared of making risotto....it may be time-consuming, but it's also EASY!  A few alterations:  I used 3 onions instead of 1 (they shrink down so much when caramelized), 2 garlic cloves, and only a tablespoon of balsamic (and that was PLENTY).  This was an amazing dish...well worth the time (took nearly an hour and a half from start to finish).  Left out the thyme at the end...instead sprinkled it with parmesan.  Can't say enough good things about this dish!
P.S. It really doesn't matter how you prepare the chicken, you can barely taste it in the dish!
P.P.S. Used a dry Pinot Grigio for the wine...wonderful!

why is this dish called "roasted" chicken when it just calls for chopped chicken?  why would you get a roasted chicken from the deli when all you need is some boneless,skinless to chop.

This was excellent!! The caramelized onions really gave this recipe a great taste, plus garnishing with thyme was a plus. I didn't have any arborio rice or brown rice, so I tried white rice and that worked fine.  Would definitely make this again and again...

I made this the other night and it came out super yummy!!  I had never made a risotto before but I followed the directions and it came out great, although I think it took longer than 20 minutes for the broth to be absorbed.  I added some sun-dried tomatoes for color and flavor and it was delicious.  Very good recipe.

MMMM ... loved this recipe. I, too, used only 6 cups of chicken broth and added a half pound of sliced mushrooms when sauteeing the onions. Turned out perfect.

This is a delicious meal, I served it for company.  The total time of 45 minutes listed in the recipe, however, is not accurate, I would say the recipe takes closer to 1-1/2 hours.  Roasting and cutting up the chicken, and especially making the risotta, are very time consuming. 
But if you have time , it's a fabulous dish!

This was awesome, I loved the taste, I agree with another reviewer about the rice being a side dish without the chicken. Mine turned out great. thanks

Be sure to use arborio rice in this dish. Regular rice (long grain or jasmine) isn't going to work. 1/4 cup of the balsamic vinegar is way too much. Carmalized onions take a while to make. They must be cooked over low heat in order to bring out the sugars in the onions. If done correctly, this is a great dish.

I thought that this recipe was quite good, but I too am a little confused by the name.  I was searching for a recipe for a whole chicken that I wanted to roast, which this is not.    Any type of cooked chicken will work well.  I also have never heard of risotto being cooked al dente.  The whole point of risotto is slow cooking to bring out the starches, which is only achieved well past the al dente point. I cooked my rice nearly an hour, and did use all of the broth.  I have no idea how you could use up that much broth in only 20 minutes with the slow cooking that risotto requires.   It is a very tasty recipe, though which I guess is what matters most, so I will be making again.

This is an amazing recipe - the only thing bad about it was it's appearance.  Otherwise, it had an excellent flavor.

This recipe is delicious!  I made 2 adjustments as suggested by others. I used about half of the balsamic vinegar called for and splashed some chicken broth into the carmalized vineger.   I added a small can of sliced mushrooms at the same time I added the chicken and onions.  

This is one of the best recipes I have every made.  Its very time consuming, but well worth the effort.  Your family will love it =)

You need to have a liking for balsamic vingar,as it overpowers the dish. My wife and I like balsamic vingar and use it in many different recipies including bread dips. This ended up being a waste of good roasted chicken and expensive rice which cost $2.00 a pound.

Superb risotto!  It's one of the best I've ever made!  I made a couple of alterations including the addition of extra balsamic vinegar, a smaller amount of thyme and the addition of mushrooms (8 oz. of canned mushrooms without the juices) to the caramelized onions.  However, I would suggest fresh mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms along with a few artichokes after the "caramelization" of the white onion and mushrooms as you add the butter with the chopped chicken to the risotto.  I accompanied the risotto with the Mediterranean stuffed chicken from this website along with iceberg lettuce with feta cheese.  I will definitely make this recipe again!  It's a definite winner.

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it.  I would add more onion, as other people have said, and also shitake mushrooms.  Pinot Noir is a great wine to complement the dish as well.

This is one of the best, most elegant recipes I ever serve to guests.  The taste is delicious, but a caveat is that to make it incredibly rich, you should really use homemade chicken stock and not Swanson's broth or whatever (store-bought broth has its place, but it's not in this recipe!).  Also, we make this with the meat from a store-bought rotisserie chicken.  Makes it very easy!

I ended up using this as just a basic risotto recipe, because when I went to add the balsamic vinegar to my onions, doh! the bottle was empty.  So prepared the risotto, added a 1/2 cup additional wine and about 1/2 cup of frozen peas and the caramelized onions at the end, stirring until wine was absored, and served with parmesan sprinkled on top.  The onion flavor permeated the whole dish...oh so good, if you like caramelized onions, that is!  I'll definitely have to try this again with the balsamic, was disappointed I wasn't able to this time.  Regardless, thanks for the recipe!

Balsamic vinegar overpowered the dish. If I try again I'll use less balsamic.

If you like balsamic vinegar, you'll love this dish.  Personally, I don't...but my girlfriend does.  Just be warned that the amount suggested in the recipe overpowers the dish.  Also, consider adding some garlic and using about 5.5 cups of chicken broth.  And per the suggestion of other users, 2 onions is perfect.

Awesome recipe. I used 2 sweet large onions. And topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese. So delicious. My family at it all immediatly and requested for it to be added into the fav meal rotation. I will definatly be making this again. Although I agree it need to be pulled off the stove before the last cup of broth is absorbed and it did take me 30 mins to cook. May a slighltly higher heat next time. Thank you so much for sharing! I served with Garlic bread and a salad for a complete meal. Now to find a big enough pan so I can double it and have left overs!

VERY good, although a bit more work than I thought It would be.  I also used about 5.5 cups of Chicken Stock (instead of 7), because it wasn't really cooking down as much -- it could've been my crummy stove though.  I also added a bit of garlic to the onion/vinegar mix, but otherwise cooked as described.  Will make again!

"Royal treatment" is right.  It took a little more work to make, but well worth it.  The whole family loved it.  Even as leftovers it was excellent.

I'll give this 5 stars BUT I did only put 1 tablespoon of balsamic in.  Any more would have been overkill.  Took about 6 cups of the chicken broth and I added a little parmesan with the butter. Had a really nice flavor!

Very good.  I have made this several times.  I heat the chicken broth in a sauce pan so it is hot when I add it.  I also reduce the amount of balsalmic by about 1/2.  I have made this w/o chicken or using a store-bought rotisserie chicken.  It is very easy to make.  There is a lot of stirring involved, but I just get a glass of wine, put on some music, and hang out with my risotto by the stove.

The balsamic flavor was a bit too much for me.  Next time I would cut the balsalmic in half.  The title should be Balsamic Chicken with Risotto and Onions because that is the main flavor of the dish.

I did not use all of the broth, eliminated the wine and added artichokes. It took more than 20 minutes, but it was delicious,. Next time, I think I might try 1) using low-sodium broth and about 2) 1/2 only half the vinegar.

Had very good flavor. This was my first time making and eating risotto so I wasn't sure if it came out right. It was very "gummy" and I'm not sure if risotto is suppose to be like that. If it is then it was delicious!

This is wonderful. I wanted to lick my plate but I felt that the other at the table would look at me funny. I also added mushrooms to the dish. I thought this was very filling and was so flavorful. The only thing I would do different is cut down a bit of the vinegar. I cannot wait to do this again.

Ahh..Risotto the rice of the Gods first off risotto MUST I repeat MUST be constantly stirred to create the true creaminess that was intended for this type of rice...if you are using quick risotto stop reading this review and eat that with your store bought chicken! Otherwise when making risotto ladle 6 oz of stock into the rice and stir until the rice has absorbed all the stock before you add more. To get a creamy consistency you must STIR! The rice is done when it looks as if you put heavy cream into the rice and the rice should be firm to the bite.

This was my first risotto attempt and am I pleased!  Absolutely delious, easy, makes great use of left-over roast chicken, and best of all, my picky husband loves it. (That's the "Kid Friendly Rating")..

This was the first risotto recipe I've tried, and it turned out wonderfully! I added porcini & portobello mushrooms - it was as delicious as any risotto I've had in a restaurant. It can take a while to cook the rice, so it isn't a "quick" recipe, but the results are definitely worth it!

Wonderful recipe.  I do suggest cutting the balsamic in half and adding sauted mushrooms and parmesean cheese (1/2 C) at the end.  I have made this a half a dozen times and always get raves!

This was really good, but I felt like it was missing something.  Maybe roasted tomatoes or zucchini?  I'm still not sure.  Regardless, I'm sure I'll make this again, minus the balsamic vinegar (I didn't think it really meshed with the rest of the recipe).

This was awesome! I used pearl rice which is a cheaper similar version of arborio and it worked great. I wound up using about 6 cups of broth. I omitted the thyme just out of preference and topped with cheese and chives instead. The caramelized onions were SOOO good with the balsamic vinegar on them. This definitely does take a lot longer than it states but it's VERY delicious.

This was delicious, and easy. I love risotto anyway I can get it and this was a nice addition. The only thing I did different was when I was done cooking the onion I deglazed the pan with white wine and cooked the chicken in it and sliced it into small pieces and it was really good cause all I had was boneless on hand. Excellent dish Michele

I really liked this. I used some grilled herb and lemon chicken breasts I had in my freezer. I can see the balsamic being too strong for some - especially if you are using a really cheap or harsh one. Use a good quality balsamic and add it slowly at the end to eliminate the possibility of overpowering this with vinegar. Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of our favorites it is simple and delicious!  I do a few things slightly differently.  I always add mushrooms - I cook them with the onions for the last 5 minutes.  To make it a bit healthier, I only use 6 cups of low sodium chicken broth - 7 cups of the regular is just a crazy amount of sodium!  I also skip the butter at the end - it is a bit tastier with it, but not enough for me to justify the extra fat/calories.  I also cook my own chicken breasts with a little garlic and olive oil.  I use about 1/8 cup of vinegar - I love vinegar but with a 1/4 cup, all you taste is vinegar!

This was very tasty, and although it was a little time consuming, it's certainly worth doing every once in a while. I'd also like to speak out in defense of the roast chicken idea. I think that roasted chicken tastes better in this one than grilled or boiled. Plus, for one or two people, leftovers from a roast chicken are perfect for this recipe. I never eat the whole chicken in one meal (even with one other person helpng), so I pull off the extra (usually around 2 cups) and shred it. For this recipe, I tossed the carcass into four cups of store-bought broth, added 3 cups of water, an onion and some parsley and simmered for an hour to perk up the boxed stock. So for the price of one chicken (usually less than a package of breasts, for that matter) I get several meals.

I'm not a big fan of onions, so I used shallots instead, minced them, and just left them in while cooking the rice so that they melted into the dish. I'd also recommend low sodium broth, as the salt gets concentrated as liquid evaporates. I think when I make this again, I'll also increase the wine to 1/2 a cup.

This is delicious.  I halved the balsamic vinegar and doubled the wine.  I don't think I would eliminate the vinegar altogether because it really adds to the flavor.  However, I think the entire amount might be too overhelming.  I also sauted about 4 ounces of sliced mushrooms after the onions were done.  While cooking the last cup of stock into the risotto, I added a bag of fresh baby spinach and let it wilt down.  This not only added color but nutritional value.  Also, I don't think using a roasted chicken is completely necessary but given the amount of time and attention a risotto needs, it was nice not to have to worry about cooking chicken.  I'd definately make this again!

Very Disapointed! This looks like a big ple of mush - I was embarassed to serve it even to my own family!!!  Thank goodness I didn't serve it to company!  After reading other posts I did put mushrooms in as well, but I was going to also add minced garlic but I did not.  Maybe if I did add the garlic it would taste better?  My family eats almost anything but this got a big thumbs down.  The taste was terrible - all I tasted was the vinegar!  Just drink vinegar straight out of the bottle to save yourself some time.  Ewww.... Don't waste your time as it also takes FOREVER to prepare!  MUCH longer than what the recipe says.  What a disapointment.  :(

DO try this! Pre roasted garlic chicken from the store really made this simple. I used 1 TB balsamic vinegar per other posts, and upped the rice to 2 cups although next time I wouldn't unless feeding a crowd. That much rice did take 7 cups hot broth. Used mostly homemade broth but had to add boxed. Don't skip the WINE part!! I added dry thyme to the final broth stir-in because it needed more flavor. Topped with dry grated Italian Blend cheese. The overall broth adding process took me about 30 minutes not 20 (maybe my stove was not hot enough). I would also suggest pulling off stove to serve before that final  broth is absorbed, or else it will soak up TOO much once served. VERY GOOD. Thanks for sharing.

this recipe is great! i used chicken parts and boiled them with vegetables for a home-made stock. the result was perfectly tender chicken and a flavorful broth. i took the advice of other reviews and added double the onion & included fresh mushrooms. this was a delicous dish!

This is very satisfying. The caramelized onions make the dish, so I would suggest using more - I actually quadripled the amount of onions. I also cubed and fried my chicken breast until it was golden brown, but still more moist than roast breast. Added a bit of Guoda cheese to the risotto and skipped the thyme as I didn't think it very fitting.

Really good recipe. Tons of flavor, very filling. Everyone in the house loved it. I bumped up the rice to 2 cups (and used boiling broth) and it fed 5 adults. Took a while to make, but worth it. Will make again!

My boyfriend and I made this for dinner the other night, and it was not only delicious, but relatively easy to make.  We made two changes: we omitted the butter and added mushrooms.  I feel the mushrooms were an especially nice addition.

This was very good, especially as left-overs the second day. I had difficulty getting all of the chicken broth to absorb and ended up having to cover the pan, which greatly helped. It took much longer than called for in the recipe. I think next time I won't use a rotisserie chicken (flavor too overpowering) and will use the entire amount of balsamic vinegar. I may also use two onions for more carmelized onion flavor. One onion really cooks down. Great recipe. Thanks!

Another reviewer was correct when he stated that the balsamic vinegar just overpowers this dish.  I also found the recipe to be very time-consuming and was very disappointed with the end result.  Will definitely not be making this one again.

You're right Michele -- this is great even if you're busy & have to purchase a pre-roasted chicken!   The added touch of the excellent grated cheese really tops it off!   Two "YUMS" up!

I tried this recipe as written. However I like mine 10 star more. I use dry vermouth instead of wine matter of choice. I caramelize the onions remove set aside, in same skillet add 1-2 Tbsps. butter if available fresh chopped shitake, baby portabellas, oyster mushrooms and crimini, a combination of mushrooms is best, sauté when soft and cooked to liking, combine with the caramelized onion reserve for later. There should be enough butter/olive oil no need to add additional, didn't care for the balsamic vinegar so I omitted it. Stir in rice as instructed then add vermouth or white wine, until absorbed then begin adding broth 1 cup at a time until your risotto is done to your liking. It always amazes me how anyone can cook risotto in 20 minutes mine is always at least 30-45 minutes. You need to stay with this adding more broth as it absorbs. When done add the mushroom/onions stir in salt and pepper to taste. I also use fresh grated parmesan and I prefer parsley to thyme. I know I completely changed this up just though I would share my version

I added mushrooms, cooked chicken, and peas to make it more of an entrée.  It was delicious!!  I love the onion, mushroom, and balsamic vinegar combo!

After reading several of the reviews I changed a few things as well. I added Mushrooms and shrimp to the onion mixture. I also sauteed them in butter and Garlic instead of the oil. with the Rice it took a little longer than the 20mins. I also cut up chicken breast and cooked it with my own seasoning. I added the needed amount of butter to the risotto and the chicken to the onion mixture and then combined everything together. IT was so Good! all my kids and my Husband just loved it! this is one meal I will make often!

This was decent. I have never had risotto before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I did add mushrooms and a bit of garlic as other reviewers suggested. I also cooked two chicken breasts on my Foreman grill as another review suggested and I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and seasoning salt. My husband and 3 year old did not care for it, but my 6 year old liked it. I would have to agree that the balsamic is a bit on the strong side and can definitely be reduced. The cooking time was also off as this did take about 45 minutes for the rice to absorb the fluid. I probably won't make this version again, but I am opening to trying different versions.

I agree with the other reviews about too much basalmic and I love love love basalmic. It was a bit over powering in this recipe. Also the cook time is off by quite a bit. I've made a lot of risotto and it takes about an hour not 20 minutes. I would not make this again.

Good flavor but arbrio rice is expensive. My first time making risotto and it came out a bit mushy. Also, time estimates are way below actual.

Incredible! Had this as a side dish without the chicken because we had steak as the main dish. I thought this was the best risotto I have ever made. An a+ from my daughter, too. I was actually afraid of adding the carmelized red onions to her rice but she loved it. When using chicken buillon, make sure to use unsalted butter. Oh and also it wasn't necessary to sprinkle thyme.

The first few bites were great, but by the time I got to the middle of my portion it was boring.  It makes for nothing but edible, but not tasty, leftovers.  Leftovers sustain us.  I enjoyed the onions and balsamic together.

We followed the recipe pretty close and felt like it was good but needed something. Like possibly bacon...ha. I know, bacon makes ANYTHING good. But for all the time it took (a good hour and a half) we didn't feel it was worth the time. Couple things we would change: add into the actual recipe part a step to heat the broth before adding because we totally forgot to heat it before adding. Not a huge deal but I think it would have cooked much faster. Also we felt 2 Tbsp thyme was too much. It was definitely creamy though and we just cooked the chicken in the same pan after the onion mixture so maybe if we had gotten a rotisserie it would have added to the overall flavor.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this.  It tasted great until we added the balsamic onions. I love balsamic but it totally overpowered the dish and made it taste almost sour.  I'll use this recipe as a good base for other risottos, but will skip the balsamic next time.

Very good recipe; would be great with some modifications.  I followed it as written, except I sauteed some chopped chicken breast instead of roasting.  I also did 1 T oil and 1 T butter when carmelizing the onions; they took around 40 minutes on a low heat.  I also only needed about 5 cups broth -- after that the rice was perfectly done.  Next time I would cut the balsalmic down to about 1/8 cup.  I like balsalmic, but I thought the taste was a little strong and overpowered the onions a bit.  I would also add some minced garlic.  I worked on a small stove so I heated the broth and wine in a small coffee cup in the microwave shortly before adding them into the rice.  It worked out very well!  The risotto was creamy and my husband ate several servings and licked his plate clean.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe.  Instead of buying a roasted chicken, I grilled a couple of chicken breasts.  My family loved it, including my 15 month old.  She cleaned her plate!  I will make again, however, I'm going to throw in a few veggies with it, and use lower sodium chicken broth.  But overall a very good dinner!

Sorry to post a negative review but I strongly disliked this recipe.  You must be a LOVER of balsamic vinegar to enjoy this - I thought the recipe very shallow in depth and very vinegary (and I went light on the BV)

Absolutely delicious. Obviously, risotto is a little time-consuming, but the results were definitely worth it. Like the previous reviewer, I added a package of sliced gourmet mushrooms. With some asparagus topped with shaved Parm, this made an elegant and delicious meal. Thanks, Michele!

Unbelievable.  My family rated this a 10.  Worth the effort - stirred in some peas prior to serving for some color but otherwise made according to the recipe.  My advice - try it, you wont be disappointed!

This is wonderful!  I followed the recipe, but added frozen aspagus ends the last 5 min of cooking the risotto.  I also used 2 chicken breasts that I sauteed in EVOO and thyme and poultry seasoning. Used some gouda stirred in. Mmmmmmm, a new fave

I made this for dinner for my visiting mother-in-law and my husband and we thought the taste was nice, but that the dish itself was VERY rich.  I bought a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and the breasts were the perfect amount of chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly with exception to the broth and the onions.  When making risotto you should never use cold broth, it should always be warm when adding to the rice otherwise the end result will be gluey rice.  Also, instead of using only 1 onion, I used 4 as 1 onion would not yield very much caramelized onion (they shrink down SO much!)  I also only ended up using about 5.5 cups of broth (7 would have been way too much IMHO).  So in the end, I probably won't make this dish again (maybe as an appetizer at a dinner party, but that's about it).

This was great! My husband loved the flavors. I roasted a chicken and added a few slices over the top of the risotto. I didn't have to use as much liquid as was called for, and I also used low-sodium broth and red onions and no butter. I also only used 1 tbl. of olive oil for the risotto. I used spray oil for the onions (to cut down on fat). The texture was creamy and wonderful. Also, I sprinkled dried thyme on top just before serving. Thanks for a great recipe!

This has comfort food written all over it. I did not have to stray from the recipe, other than the fresh garlic I put in everything. The Arborio rice took a little longer than stated, but I just kept testing after 20 minutes. I also drained/discarded most of the balsamic from the onions when they were ready to go in. Great recipe, will definitely make again.

This is definately a "no fail" risotto.  Very easy.  I omitted the butter and wine.  I did stir in some sliced crimini mushrooms at the very end to make this dish more of a complete meal.  It was delicious!  I think the balsamic vinegar is what makes this dish so special, so don't leave it out.

I changed this a bit after reading others reviews. I added mushrooms to the onions along with garlic and reduced the amount of vinegar. I then added the onion mixture to the rice while it was cooking rather than leaving it to stir through at the end. With the chicken I used cut up breast pieces and dusted with flour and herbs. I then cooked the chicken in a pan and added it through the rice when the rice was almost cooked. At the very end I stirred through some cream to finish the dish off. The taste was excellent but without the changes the vinegar flavour would have been too overpowering. I don't think vinegar is particually suited to risotto so don't think I will be using it again.

I really liked the flavor of this dish.  I don't think you need to add the butter that it calls for at the end if you want to save some fat/calories.  I took some chicken breasts, cooked them with a little salt, pepper and very slight seasoning and cut those up for this and other recipes for the week.  I also steamed some asparagus, blached it in ice water and added it at the end...skip the tyme, too powerful

I finally got around to trying this recipe last night (it's been in my recipe box for almost 8 years), and we were very pleased with it.  The only thing I did differently was to use about 1t dried thyme stirred in near the end of cooking, rather than fresh.  I did notice that I needed only 5 cups of broth, but would still have the amount called for ready for use.  Using a really good balsamic vinegar is important - the best I've found is Kirkland Signature from Costco.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  Thanks, Michele!

The balsamic vinegar is OVERPOWERING and ruins what could possibly be a good dish. I like balsamic vinegar but this was simply too much. A tablespoon might be okay but I would only add a little at a time tasting it as you go. In any case taste it before you add the chicken as you may want to save your chicken for something edible.

Very nice recipie, and instructions were perfect.  First dish dasn't so good as the basalmic vineger gave me a "bite back,"  must be my palate.  After leaving out the vinegar and using my own marinated oven broiled chicken, this recipie rocked.  Tasty, creamy, and well beyond my expectations.  Simply delicious!  Thank you for making what I thought was a complicated dish easy and delicious.

We had risotto at a very fine $$ italian restaurant  back in Dec while visiting Seattle. It was so good, that I have wanted to create it at home. I  have been scared of making it - but no more! It is time comsuming, since you need to stir  continuously at med high heat and for all those that gave it a one star - I say --"follow the recipe directions" and "you will have no trouble"!!! You need to  keep it bubbling and stir and stir and keep adding your liquid a little at a time and let it absorbed into rice and  eventually you havea nice creamy risotto!  I did add  3 cloves of garlicand  1 cup sliced mushrooms to the onion mixture.  I used 1T  red wine vinegar after I read some comments that it was  too much vinegar!   I used about  6 cups broth - you have to keep stirring and adding broth  amd it only took me 26 min  - next time I might add peas for color and eliminate thyme and use just  basil. I did add some red pepper flakes. I roasted  chicken  tenders  and cut those up.  over all this dish  was delicous and I  will be making it again, now that I know how  to make it and  will add my own variations!

Very good.  Didn't have the correct rice so I used basmati.  Turned out really good but not as creamy as I expected, may be from the rice.  We will make it again.

I just don't get it!  Most of the time I agree with the ratings.  This recipe just didn't do it for me or my family.  As much as I love all the individual ingredients it just tasted funky.  I followed the recipe exactly and we ate it but just because we didn't want to waste it.

I really didn't like this recipe at all, and used incredibly good balsamic vinegar.  I'll be saving that for my vinaigrettes now.

This was DELICIOUS!  I didn't need 7 cups of broth... more like 5-5 1/2.  I also added garlic to the chicken and mushrooms.  It definitely took longer than 20 minutes to make the rice.

SO TASTY!!! We went with other reviews and only used 6 cups of broth and it was just right.  We also didn't use a whole onion - about 1/3 cup diced onion with the balsamic vinegar. When adding these into the risotto, we used a slotted spoon to catch all the onion and then added the balsamic to our taste - not overpowering at all when done this way.  A definite keeper!

Today I cracked this one out of the archives.  Upgraded the review to a 4 because the kids and hubby liked it. But I only used 1/2 tsp vinegar. George Foreman-ed the chicken again. Added spices to the oil prior to rice; dried thyme and  onion powder.  Added 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp rouge pimento to rice before adding onion and chicken. Didn't add the butter.  I'll play with adding more balsamic vinegar next time. 
10/20/08 3 stars Okay, I have to give this a 3 because while I LOVED it (5) my entire family hated it (0).  Grilled two chicken breast on the George Foreman grill.  Added 1/2 cup orzo to the rice- used all 7 Cups of stock.  I thought it was SO good.  I will make again with out the balamic- my guys didn't like the balsamic vinegar taste.
The cook time is definitely longer than posted, but worth it.

This was really good!  My whole family loved it even my two kids ages 5 and 2.  I followed the directions.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  Instead of using "rice" I used actual Risotto pasta.  It used less broth than called for so I would make sure to follow the directions and add it one cup at a time... It used about 2 1/2 cans of broth (plus the water because I used condensed).  I wouldn't add any sundried tomatoes because I think this would be too much but I definately could see adding mushrooms... I might do that next time!  Yummy!

This is superb! I did cut down on the balsamic vinegar and I used chicken that had been grilled in a tarragon/balsamic vinegar marinade, otherwise pretty much left it as written. We love it!

This was okay, we reduced the vinegar to 1 TBS, I can only imagine how overpowering the 1/4C must be. Wouldn't make it again.

This dish has the most fabulous flavor!
Be sure to cook the onions s-l-o-w-l-y; this is the trick.  Delicious!

This dish tasted great.  The best part, in my opinion, is the caramelized onions!  What a great flavor with the risotto.  One thing I'd suggest is, don't add any salt at all.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of salt without tasting first, and it definitely was not needed.  I nearly ruined it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I poached the chicken with some spices, onions and celery, which made it very moist for the risotto.  I also used a red onion and if I make it again, I would use a white onion (the left overs tasted even stronger of onions).  I chose this because it was a risotto that was not mushroom, and this was definitely a good one.

We enjoyed this recipe!  I cooked the onion at the same time as the rice (in separate pans of course).  I marinated chicken breasts in Italian dressing and garlic for half an hour and then broiled them while the onions and rice were on the stovetop.  I only used 2/3 cup of Arborio rice for a smaller portion and used a full 4 cups of chicken broth (32oz box).  It took 40-45 minutes for the rice and I stirred it almost constantly. I did still use a whole onion but not the entire amount of balsamic vinegar - probably about half.  I was worried that the chicken stock would over power the flavor of the rice since so much of it was used and concentrated, but the onions with balsamic really gave the rice a nice flavor and it was so creamy!  Instead of mixing the chicken into the rice, I served the breasts sliced on top.  Yummy!  I'd make this again - thanks!

This recipe is AMAZING.  I added a lot less balsamic vinegar than was recommended, but it still had a wonderful flavor.  I just eyeballed it.  I used the spice mixture from the roast sticky chicken-rotisserie style from this site.  I cooked three chicken breasts with liberal spices and then chopped them up into very small bits.  The spices on the chicken add a lot of great flavor to the risotto.  This is my new favorite food and my husband loved it, too!

Wonderful and different flavor. I resisted the urge to use more onion than called for, and I'm glad that I did. It was perfect. Changes: I sauteed whole boneless, skinless thighs in a non-stick pan and then wiped the pan clean and used the same pan to cook the onions with no oil. I only used 1 TB oil on the rice, and 1 TB of butter, and added 1/4 cup parmesan at the end. I used the full amount of both the vinegar and the (low sodium) broth. It's supposed to be creamy. Definitely allow more time than the recipe calls for, even with starting the rice first, this took an hour and 15 minutes from start to finish. I finished it by mounding the risotto on the plate and topping it with an entire chicken thigh (instead of chopping it up and adding it to the risotto) and the thyme. Don't omit the thyme---it adds a LOT. Wonderful and elegant.

This is awesome!  If you're looking for something to warm you up or need a "new" comfort food, this gets my vote!  This and a green veggie and you're all set!  Actually, I've even added the green veggie into the mix and made it a one pot meal.  Just par-cook the veggie and add it in towards the end of the cooking.

I really liked this recipe. I made it using the chicken stock recipe by Margaret Price. I also added mushrooms as suggested by some people. I tasted it before adding the caramalised onions and it was delicious. I didn't think it was as good after adding them, but that is just my personal taste. All in all a fantastic recipe. Will definately be making this one again

Incredible tasting meal.  It was my first time making the risotto and I didn't have the wine or broth simmering when I added them.  The texture was a little sticky but it still tasted great!

I would call this "Risotto with chicken and onions" since everything else takes a back seat to the rice.  Everything, except the balsamic, that is.  It was a bit strong on the balsamic--it was by far the dominant flavor.  Next time I will tweak the ingredients a bit.

This had a very good taste! I added mushrooms and let them and the onions sit in the vinegar on low while the risotto finished and I think it let the flavor soak in a bit more. I also didn't have roasted chicken, so I baked 2 breasts w/garlic salt, thyme, pepper and salt and then added them in at the end. I made it with asparagus with balsalmic butter sauce and it was wonderful!

I was so disappointed in this recipe!  I love all the ingredients, but the flavors were WAY to strong together!  Maybe with half the vinegar it would be okay, but neither my husband nor I cared for it and I wouldn't spend the time making it again.  Sorry.

I really liked the combination of caramelized onions and thyme, but my boyfriend thought it was "too strong."  I might try it again with less onions.  It also took me a lot longer to add the 7 cups of stocks -- I gave up after 6 and the consistency was still good.

I thought this was really good. The balsamic vinegar gave it a really tasty kick and I love interesting variations that I would never have thought of! I used two onions and cooked the rice regularly because I dont like al dente rice. I will be making this again!

What a wonderful meal for a cold and rainy day! This is the first time I've ever tried to make a risotto, and it turned out quite well. Like other reviewers I reduced the balsamic vinegar to 1/8 cup, and the chicken stock to 5-1/2 cups. I also made stock using Better-than-Bouillon Chicken flavor to make the stock.

Timewise it took me a total of about 35-45 minutes. I was grilling the chicken, cooking the onions and making the risotto all at the same time. It kept me quickstepping a bit, but worked out quite well.

This was a great recipe! Even my boyfriend who is the pickiest eater in the world really liked it. I didn't have arborio rice,so I used brown rice instead and it still turned out great.  It was very easy to make. I will make it again and again!

This is very yummy, but I did have to make some adjustments as I didn't have any Arborio rice.  Instead I used brown rice that I prepared in the oven.  I started by caramelizing the onions and then let them sit in the balsamic while I sauteed the chicken.    
Than I simply combined the chicken and onions and poured them over the rice.  My family enjoyed it very much and I can only imagine that they will enjoy it more with creamy risotto the next time. I did forget to use the thyme and didn't notice the difference.

This was great!  I did not use the butter or thyme, not needed.  Using the store bought chicken made it so easy, great for a week night dinner.  Add parmesan cheese before serving.  Next time I might try adding sun dried tomatoes or peas.  A keeper!

A very yummy recipe but the directions were a little off. I only needed 5 cups of stock and 40 minutes cooking time. After that I had produced a delicious dish that my husband loved and agreed was repeatable. Most Risottos takes a while to cook so leave extra time.

LOVE this dish! Going into my regular rotation. Took about 40 minutes to prepare. I had some left over shredded roasted chicken which I just added as directed. Next time I will chop it up before adding it. Agree with other reviews. Next time I will use 2 onions. I sautéed one onion with garlic and used only 1 tablespoon of balsamic. I never made risotto before but I followed the directions and it turned out great. I heated up 5 cups of chicken bone broth and slowly added it to the rice. The trick is frequent stirring and adding only 1 cup or 1 ladle at a time. It took me about 25 minutes or so before the rice was done. I normally used dried herbs and I am glad I bought fresh thyme for presentation purposes. I also sautéed some mushrooms on the side and added this at the end (kids don’t like them but hubby and I do!). I topped it with shaved Parmesan and thyme. Perfect dish for left over chicken!

Not sure if I did something wrong or the balsamic vinegar I used but the balsamic just over powered the dish. I did everything as the recipe stated except added mushrooms. It smelled great and looked great but the vinegar was just over powering. I will try again and use less balsamic next time. I read reviews before I made it and no one mentioned it so I'm thinking it may have been something I did.

I used the crock pot caramelized onion recipe for this & then followed the rest of recipe as stated except for adding sun dried tomatoes.  It was delicious!  Will definitely make again.  Might add sautéed mushrooms also next time.  Easy - once you have made the crock pot onions - and delicious.

I don't know why we give 5 stars to recipes that we've altered somehow, but here I go, doing just that.  I took to heart other reviewers thoughts about the balsamic being too much and halved it to only 2 tbs, instead of the 1/4c it calls for.  Also, I used the stock from the previous night's roasted chicken, and added some chicken bouillon to it for flavor.  In addition, I probably used closer to 3 cups of chicken, as it's what I had leftover.  The result?  Oh.em.gee.  It was wonderful!  I've never made a rissotto before, and I'm feeling pretty impressed with myself over it.  One note: I did make sure the wine AND the stock were fairly hot when I added it to the rice mix, and it took far longer than 20 minutes for it all to absorb--"20 minutes" was much more like "one hour".  But no matter--I'll be making it again, for sure!

I made this last night for the family and it was super tasty!  I used my own chicken breasts that I seasoned, pan seared in olive oil and then finished in oven while I got the onions going.  I took others advice about cutting back on the balsamic and only used about 1 1/2 TBSP. My risotto only needed about 5 cups of broth. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

I've been using this recipe for a while and keep forgetting to review it! We LOVE this recipe, when I have time to make it. I'd always been a little scared of making risotto, but this recipe was well written. The balsamic onions add a nice sweetness and tang to the overall creamy dish, which is much needed. Without them, I could see this being way too heavy. Good balance, good texture. This is one of the few recipes I follow exactly every time! I have substituted basil for thyme depending on what I have on hand and it works very well, too.

I guess it was my fault that the dish tasted like Balsamic Vinegar overload.   When I added the vinegar to the onions I didn't cook it down, I just stirred it in.  The flavor of vinegar was overwhelmingt.  Added more onion and that didn't help.  This recipe also makes a huge amount.  I will make it again without so much Balsamic Vinegar

Delicious.

Here's how to roast the chicken (I used three smaller boneless/skinless breasts):  Just pour a small amount of olive oil (other oil probably would work) in a casserole dish.  Take the breasts and put them  in the casserole dish and then turn them over so they have a thin coating of oil on both sides.  Then just put a little salt and pepper and put in the oven for 25 minutes at 350 degrees if small breasts or 30 minutes at 350 if larger.  Alow breasts to rest about ten minutes and then cut into small strips or cubes.  And that's it.

You can actually cook the onions and the risotto at the same time.  So I had the onions carmelizing on one burner, the risotto simmering on a  second one and then the chicken stock/broth simmering on the third so it was hot to stir in.  

Once done, I did mix in a little parmesan cheese in addition to the butter is calls for.

Served with a ceasar salad.  Really, really good.  I'll definitely make it again.  Leftovers were delicious too.

Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

This was very good, but certainly takes longer than 45 minutes!  Make sure you use a good balsamic to really maximize the flavor.  The chicken needs to be seasoned or it will be very bland against the rice.  We sauteed small cubes with some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and thyme and that went very well with the other flavors already in the dish.  Rice definitely takes longer than 20 minutes to absorb- plan on a good 45 for a real slow-cooked risotto.  We also added a couple of cloves of pressed garlic to the onion mixture and chopped the onions very small so as not to have too much crunch in the texture of the rice, but that's just a matter of preference.  Overall, nice flavors- just takes a while!

Great dish. Tasty and easy to adjust to suit your tastes and needs. You can put anything you want with the rice base. It's not hard to make, but does take time. The 20 minutes to stated for broth to be absorbed took nearly an hour. Heating the broth before adding (and re-heating between pours) helps the absorption speed a bit. If you have the time, it's worth it.  -- I have to add that the thyme is really a great garnish for this!

It was ok.  I didn't have Risotto, and our store didn't carry it so I had to substitute it with brown rice.  It had great flavor, I added some garlic to the rice while it was cooking just because every review said it need some help on flavor.  I also did what others did with cutting down on the balsamic vinegar, I just sprinkled a little on the onions and mushrooms (also what reviews advised) and tossed.  I liked it, but it wasn't like awesome or anything.  Nothing to rave too much about, but was good enough to eat and not have to use the backup pizza for (haha).

This was really good and my first time making risotto which I was super nervous about but it was perfect. I thought the balsamic was a bit overpowering so the next time I make it I will use a little less than what the recipe calls for.

The risotto was good, but it turned out very very sweet (and I love balsamic) so it was hard to eat more than a few bites of it. Also, I added mushrooms which I would completely recommend.

Delicious! I left out the butter ... mostly because I forgot.. but I don't think it needed it anyway - if you cook it right, it will be creamy already. I might want more onion next time and will probably add some veggies like asparagus. Thanks!

I really liked this. Made as author intended. I would try with crimini mushrooms as others suggested.  We just cooked our chicken in oo in frying pan and it was fine! Couple things though, our rice was no where close to being done in 20 minutes . it was more like 30-40. My husband thought it was pretty time consuming for "chicken and rice" but he did like it! thanks for sharing.

This did not taste like risotto to me.  I should have cut back on the balsamic as others suggested.  The only thing that "saved" this recipe was adding about 1/4 cup of parm and about 1/4 cup of heavy cream at the end, this gave it more of a risotto taste but the balsamic was still overwhelming. (and that's coming from someone who loves balsamic and uses it often in cooking)  So, I would suggest cutting the balsamic to at least 1/8 cup, add 1/4 cup heavy cream and allow it to absorb a bit at the end of cooking, remove from heat and add 1/4 cup parm.

Hubby says give it 6 stars.  I used 2T balsamic, added garlic with the onion, added artichoke hearts with the chicken.  Other users are right cant really tell the chicken was roasted so maybe next time I'll use regular...also used white grape juice b/c I didn't have any wine :(

Even though I made some slight changes, I give this a 5 because it would still be amazing as it's written.  I cooked 2 chicken breasts - on the stove top - in about 6 cups of water seasoned with salt, pepper and onion powder.  After taking out my cooked chicken, I used the broth for cooking my arborio rice.  With the advice of others, I added an extra onion.  Also tossed in some mushrooms and fresh garlic as the onions started caramelizing.  Stirred in some thinly sliced zucchini to the onions mixture when I added the balsamic vinegar, after taking it off the heat.  Wanted to "bulk it up" a bit by adding veggies to make it a well-rounded meal.  This fed my family of 4 (2 adults, 2 small children) with some leftovers for my lunch tomorrow!  This was AMAZING!!  Will definitely make it again, but only on the weekend when I have a little more time - and my husband to help with the kids.

Was a pretty disapointing dish.  I expected so much more from this.  I used left over chicken breast from our bbq and I think it all went wrong when I didn't use homemade stock - I used store bought stock.  The finished taste was all stock and you couldn't even taste the rice/chicken/onions.  It would have been better if I had used half stock and half water I think.  Also there is no need to cook the onions and rice in separate pans.  I cooked the onions, with some garlic, as directed then just added the rice to the same pot and began cooking the risotto.  Surely you want the rice to absorb all the different flavours so why keep them seperate?

I hate giving bad reviews. I honestly do. The flavours were terrible. I have made many a risotto. I'm sorry to be so harsh, but I just don't understand why this has gotten so many good reviews.

Too salty! Use reduced sodium chicken broth, do not add extra salt at the end and use ONLY 1 T. balsamic vinegar (cannot stress that enough).  Definitely use 2 onions and 2 t. minced garlic.  Fresh thyme at the end made it taste heaps better.

Absolutely beautiful. Yes, I used only half the amount of vinegar, but that's just a personal preference--the only 'right' amount is the amount you like. Also, if you let the vinegar cook out a minute or so, it reduces and becomes sweet, which gives the almost a raisin-y type taste. Again, whatever's your personal preference. (the cooking times will always vary, as brands of rice vary) All in all, a hit with both myself and my husband!

I made the recipe as written and the balsamic vinger is too overpowering.  Also, the rice takes much longer than 20 minutes to cook. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour. I may try again with less balsamic as other users suggests.

This is a fabulous recipe.  My husband raved over it. I followed recipe as written with just a few changes. 1. sauted 2 chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic for chicken component. 2. added portabella mushrooms to onion mixture. 3. used 2 onions as suggested by others. 4. added grated parmesan and some sliced grape tomatoes prior to serving Yummy!

This was pretty good - this was the first time I made risotto, and while it did take a long time, it turned out well.  I did thought that the balsamic was an interesting twist but it was a little too strong and overpowering.  Next time will reduce to 2 tbsp like other reviewers suggested.

Absolutely delicious!   I've made it so many times and it never disappoints!  Some variations I do are: don't put the chicken in the risotto.  I cook whole chicken breasts and serve them on the side.  I stuff the chicken with some herbed goat cheese and put the same goat cheese in the risotto when it is almost done.  It is so good and it ties the two together.

I really enjoyed this recipe, I used rotisserie chicken that I bought at the store and I reduced the vinegar to around 1/8 cup.  If you don't cut the vinegar down that is all you will taste.  Made like I listed above the flavors work really well together!

I love this recipe and have made it several times now.  I do however put the chicken stock in a pan on the stove on med. heat close to the pot with the risotto so it is hot when added each time to the risotto.  I have also made it where I keep the chicken out of the dish and serve it on the side rather than in the risotto.  Works well either way.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but I found that the flavor was very one-dimensional.  I love balsamic vinegar, but it was really overpowering in this recipe.  If I made it again I think I would reduce the balsamic vinegar greatly and add something for some more fresh flavor.  Maybe fresh chives?  Or basil?  We felt it would be better as a side dish than a main course for dinner.

Wow......terrific risotto!  The combination of the onions, roasted chicken and balsamic vinegar work very well together.  I made mostly as directed, but took previous posters' suggestions and added dried oregano and basil to the simmering risotto and a little sugar to the onions after cooking.....brought out the flavors a bit better, I think.  I also added a generous helping of grated Parmesan at the very end to up the creaminess factor of the risotto.  This one's definitely going in the recipe box!

A lot of work...flavor of rice tasted better BEFORE adding carmelized onions. Smelled better too (odor of onions turned me off after being added to rice mixture). Very surprised though on how much arborio rice swells. Wow! 1 1/2 cups is like 10-12 cooked. Careful single folks! I had so much left over it was silly.

This was awesome!  I agree with some of the other comments.  You probably could skip one of the cups of chicken broth and it does take more thatn 45 minutes. next time I might add a little more chicken and add muchrooms.

This was very good and I will make it again, but with a few tweaks to add a little more flavor. If you're not careful, it's a little bland.

great dish! I used orzo pasta b/c I didn't have rice. I had about 5 cups of extra broth after the pasta was cooked so I strained the pasta and made gravey with the extra broth. I also used  pinot grigio b/c that's all I had. This dish is a keeper.

I really didn't find this very appealing at all.  Not much flavor to it and followed the recipe very closely.

Taste was super yummy. I did find that it took more like 40 minutes than 20 minutes. Nice and easy and yummy!

I loved it.  The first time i made it i followed the directions to the tee and it came out great.  I also made it again and added some spinach and portabella mushrooms to the carmilzed onions when they were about half way done, and i loved it as well that way

I thought this recipe was great!  I didn't put chicken into the risotto, I served it as a side dish with a balsamic marinated steak, and I only used about 5 cups of stock.  It was super easy! And tasted delicious.  I will be making this again.

Relatively simple, but my whole family enjoyed this dinner.  I changed it slightly so that I could do it in the pressure cooker (such an easy way to make risotto) and because I only had red wine on hand instead of white.  I used 2 vidalia onions and a little minced garlic and sauteed them with the arborio rice until the onions began to carmelize.  For me pressure cooker, the ratio is 1.5 cups of arborio rice to 4 cups of liquid.  For the liquid, I used 3 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of red wine.  Poured that all in at once and set for high pressure for 5 minutes.  When it was done, I stirred in the balsamic vinegar and some parmesan.  We did use the rotisserie chicken because our kids (3 and 5) eat it up and love it in comparison to regular chicken breast.  I served with a side of simple sauteed green beans (fresh from the garden - yum!)

Incredible.
I halved the amount of balsamic as suggested by many, and found I only needed 6 cups of broth to make it the correct texture.  Time consuming in the making because of having to stir so often, but other than that, really easy to make.

This was EXCELLENT! Very easy to make. Enough for an entire meal. I didn't alter the recipe. I used meat from a roasted chicken I bought at the store. I will absolutely make this again! An update: I've made this many, many times. It is a wonderful and versatile dish. I rec. using the highest quality balsamic vinegar you can get your hands on....same with the chicken stock now that I think of it :-) I've chopped roasted asparagus in just before serving...yum! I also think that shaving some parm. reggiano over it is a must before serving...

We call this the "husband keeper" or "husband maker"

The roasted chicken adds an amazing dimension to this dish.  True the arborrio takes a little longer to cook than stated but a little fresh parmesan and the rosemary are AMAZING!!  I used lower sodium chicken broth and have even made it with salt free broth.  You dont need a large portion as the meal with a salad and some fresh garlic bread more than fills you up!

AMAZING recipe..and truly one night in the heat of a pending divorce I cooked this meal.  I truly believe it saved my marriage!!  LOL

Thank you!!!

I didn't use all the balsamic vinegar, as per the other reviews.  I also threw in some mushrooms and peas to the risotto.  I thought the balsamic vinegar was too overpowering, and I will definitely use less next time...also, I only needed about 6 cups of chicken broth for 1.5 cups of arborio rice.

This dish was delish!! My friend and I made it for a small dinner party, and everyone liked it.  I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic vinegar for the onions- also added chopped garlic to the onion mixture.  I did not use a roasted chicken- I chopped up 3 chicken breasts and sauteed in olive oil with garlic, rosemary and freshly ground pepper.  I also added cooked shrimp to the chicken skillet just before the chicken was done. Also added fresh chopped basil to the risotto mixture just before it was done.  YUMMMMMM.

This recipe was okay, but alot of work for something not so great. I cooked the chicken with butter, and cut down on the balsamic, taking into account other people's reviews. The amount of chicken broth required (21 cups for 12 people) was WAY too much. I bought six boxes and only used 3 and a half.

Easy and good, though a tad bit time consuming. I live in Taiwan and can't get to Arborio rice, so the regular white rice took more than half an hour to achieve al dente status. I used leftover home-roasted chicken and the flavor mixed well. Thought the risotto could have used something more than onions, so I added minced garlic - but it could still use another vegetable to make it a more healthy and colorful meal. Overall, yummy! My husband gobbled up two servings.

Absolutely delicious!  Moist and creamy, just how risotto should be.  It is a definite must to stir in some grated parmesan before serving to give it that extra special taste!!  Will definitely make this again.

We really loved this risotto.  I didn't have roasted chicken so I just marinated some in the balsamic vinegar and cooked it and then shredded it.  It did turn the risotto brown, but it tased absolutley delicous.  I had a hard time not sneaking bites before I served it.

I've made this several times, and it's a very good risotto recipe. I've never used the full amount of chicken broth called for by the recipe. I recommend using a store bought roasted chicken for ease and good flavor. Fresh thyme is better than dried, but I've used both. I also like to add a good helping of fresh parmigian or romano cheese.

This recipe turned out well; however, the amount of broth recommended I found was way too much.  I made it to serve 6 and it recommended 10.5 cups of broth for 2.25 cups of rice.  I only used about 5-6 cups of broth.

What I love about this recipe is that the initial taste isn't anything spectacular, but once you eat a serving, its tough to avoid seconds.

Substitutions:
I couldn't find fresh thyme so I went with fresh rosemary, turned out nice.  I also added some seal salt and minced garlic for taste.

I have to give this a 3 rating.  Although it was very tasty with a creamy texture, we felt it really wasn't worth all the work.  The only thing we did differently was to saute some mushrooms and add them.  It was good and also a good use of leftover roast chicken.

This was an easy recipe to make.  I did add 1/2 C. of mushrooms and 1 bunch of asparagus tips.  If I made it again I would reduce the balsamic vinegar as it's the overwhelming flavor.  Good reipe for a cold day!

My family really likes this meal a lot, and I have even made it for the In-Laws
and mom-in-law requested the recipe.  I really don't deviate from the recipe at all, and I use a rotisserie chicken.  Be careful with the balsamic vinegar, a little goes a long way.

This recipe ended up great!  I took around 45 minutes for the risotto to finish.  I added no other veggies as I had none (oddly).  I also thought I had balsamic vinegar in the cupboard - but I didn't, so I used a bit of cider vinegar, just for the bite.  Ended up great, but I think the color would have been better with balsamic!  I'll try it again with it, and some other veggies.  I also sauteed some chicken in garlic and lemon juice, and it added a great taste to it.  The risotto was creamy, and my boyfriend said it was like "an orgasm in my mouth."  So, overall, a keeper!

DELICIOUS! Like others, I added garlic and 1 cup of mushrooms. The next time I make this I plan to add more wine.  I found that the the second day leftovers was even more delicious. HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

This was amazing, my boyfriend told me it was the best thing I ever made. Definitely start the rice at the same time as the onions, it took me 2 hours start to finish. I reduced the amount of vinegar to 1/4 cup and it was still a strong flavor. I added frozen yellow corn to the last cup of broth, and added about a teaspoon of TRUFFLE OIL when I added the butter. Omitted the thyme. Delicious!

I think this recipe is great.  I didn't have any trouble absorbing all the liquid, and I thought the balsamic flavor was perfect.  I'm making it for the second time tonight!

This was very good! A good way to use up leftover chicken!  I would suggest starting the risotto first, and while it's simmering/absorbing the broth, doing the onions... seems more time efficient that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe. I never measure a thing, so i'm quite sure i used less vinegar than called for, but i thought it actually needed more than i put in :) So maybe you were right! Very good, easy dinner. I loved the addition of fresh thyme. Super yummy!

This was great. I used only 6 cups of chicken broth and it was fine. I also added chopped garlic when carmelizing the onions. YUM!

This was delicious. It did take a long time. I seasoned the chickened breasts with thyme and boiled them, then used the bouilon for stock (I had to add a bit of water and one bouillon cube to get 5 1/2 cups). I used 2 onions and next time will try 3. I skipped the butter, it was plenty rich without it.

I made this on a whim for a friend and after we finished we both sat at the table for a few minutes basking in the afterglow. Really, really good. I added mushrooms (oyster) because of other reviewers' suggestions and I'm glad I did - gave it a little more texture. Yum!

YUM! It does take a longer than the recipe states. I usaed 3 1/2 chiecken breasts. I seasoned them to my taste. I used about 5 1/2 cups of chicken broth. I thought the overall taste was a mild flavor. The b. Vinegar was not strong at all. I actually might add 1/3 of a cup of b. vinegar the next time I make it.  I like b. vinegar alot. I used a "shake" of tarragon. I do not think it is needed.

Each Sunday night by boyfriend and I take turns with who makes Sunday dinner.  It's just a nice way for us to try things out in the kitchen.  When I saw this in the "daily dish" it sounded too good to resist!  We both loved it... I changed a few things, and will maybe change a few more next time, but nothing that would alter it terribly.  It really was great.  Instead of buying a rotis. chicken I cut up breast and made it in a skillet by cooking chunks over med heat and then turning up the heat a little when it started to cook and adding water (I don't like to use oil when I cook chicken).  Had the chicken, onions and rissoto going at once (three separate pans, of course).  Halved the recipe, used a little more wine than called for.  I may leave out the butter next time.  I just didn't know if it was necessary.  When cooking the chicken I used a little ground thyme as well as when the rice was almost done.  We both LOVED it and wished I hadn't halved the recipe!

Excellent, the risotto took about 45 minutes to cook instead of the 20 min listed. I only used 6 cups of the chicken broth and it was still delicious!!

This is a great recipe!  I made it with a roasted chicken and didn't put the chicken in it and it was still wonderful!  For the user who complained about the fat/sodium content...don't use the butter, use low sodium broth, there are ways to get around that!  I did and it was wonderful!  I will use this recipe again and again!

My boyfriend and I both loved this recipe.  In fact I was still talking about and hour after we finished.  I substituted brown rice and frozen chicken breasts for that was all I had.  It still turned out wonderfully.

Tasty but takes way longer than the 45 minutes, closer to 1.5 hours.  Which sucks when you have hungry kids and a busy night.  I added a little less than a 1/4 cup balsamic because of kids tastebuds. Turned out to be perfect balance. One issue I have, the risotto takes so long that the chicken and  onions are cold by the time the risotto is done.

I added mushrooms and garlic to the onions. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was wonderful! 7/8 of the adults who ate loved it. The one said he liked it but wasn’t as excited about it as the rest. The decision is that we should put it in the rotation!

I love risotto and I make a few different kinds fairly regularly. I’m surprised the reviews are so positive. I thought this recipe was overpowering in flavour (I only used quality ingredients, including the balsamic), but it really has a strange, unpleasant taste and texture for me. I will not be making this again.

This sounded delicious, but we did not like it.  I'm not sure if it was the balsamic or the thyme but the taste was just off to me.  I'm so bummed too!   I make many risotto recipes so I'm confident I made it correctly.

This was outstanding, Michele!  My guy and I both give it 5 stars and it's definitely going into the rotation.  We didn't think there was too much vinegar at all.  We added mushrooms because we love them (though it would have been great without them, too) and I was surprised that we only needed 5 cups of broth.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I followed the advice of another reviewer and increased the onions to 3, added 2 cloves of garlic, reduced the balsamic by a lot to 1 tablespoon, and I definitely added parmesan. The risotto was delicious. Used chicken tenderloins, arborio rice (the rice is important, it absorbs a LOT of fluid and makes a very creamy-textured sauce at the end.) and definitely added parmesan on top. So good. Will make again, even though it's a time-consuming recipe!

I must have done something wrong because this was gooey, and had only the vinegar taste despite adding lots of spices and my own just made homemade chicken broth from a fried turkey remains and wasted the leftover chicken-- still did not help.  I know my spouse won't eat this ....

Made this exactly as written except for the fresh thyme (didn’t have).  My picky kids loved it.  Agree with a couple of reviewers that it takes longer than 20 minutes for the risotto to absorb all of the liquid, but worth the wait.  I’ll also say that it is very filling so there was a lot left over.

Like others have said, less vinegar and add some mushrooms. I used red onions. I also added some saffron to the broth and a little to the completed risotto for an authentic risotto taste.

I left out the balsamic vinegar and this was very tasty.  As other reviewers suggested, I added mushrooms and more onions. I also substituted 1/2 c. of broth for white wine. I haven't made risotto before and although it took me considerably longer than stated (40 minutes), it was pretty easy.

I just cooked up a couple of chicken breasts rather than using a rotisserie chicken.  Pretty well followed the recipe but probably added more carmarelized onions than called as I love them  and I will make a whole batch of the onions in my slow cooker and freeze in packagesl.  Very tasty recipe.

Great recipe. Risotto turned out creamy and tasted good/salty enough with 3.5 cups of chicken broth. 

Next time, I'll probably cut the balsamic vinegar to half the portion as well. It was a bit too sour for us with the proposed portion. 

It is possible to reduce cooking time by cooking the rice and the onions at the same.

I made this tonight and it IS quite tasty.  It does take longer than 20 min for the rice to absorb all of the liquid.  I also added a bit of garlic to the onion/balsamic vinegar base mixture.  My husband thought the balsamic flavor was a bit too strong.  I will cut back a bit on the vinegar next time.  But overall, very good recipe!

I made a roast chicken for dinner one night, then used the leftover chicken for this dish the next day. I followed the recipe, but added mushrooms (baby portabello) and diced sauteed garlic--just threw them in the empty pan after the onions were done cooking and left it on medium low, stirring occasionally. About halfway through cooking the risotto, I added the cooked chicken to the mushrooms and garlic to warm it up.  I also made 2 cups of rice instead of 1.5, to help balance all the extra ingredients. My whole family loved it and asked me to make it again! It has wonderful warm, complex flavors and is easy to make, although you are at the stove the whole time.

Going on our favorites list for sure.

First time making risotto and the reviews and instructions were very helpful. I cut down the amount of balsamic as noted in the comments and added garlic to the onions. Consistency was perfect but the flavor is pretty bland unless there's a big chunk of the carmelized onions.  If I make it again I will up the onions, garlic, salt, pepper and butter and see if that helps.

I used half the amount of balsamic vinegar, based on previous review, glad I did,  and added some veggies towards the end. I love it but not the 6 & 8 yr old.

We're risotto aficionados and thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  Don't be alarmed by the nay sayers.  The onions and balsamic vinegar are delicious in the rice (I drained the excess vinegar before adding the onions to the dish).  I added some sautéed mushrooms and some peas to make it a one dish meal.  We're looking forward to using the left overs for crispy risotto cakes!

Wonderful flavor mixes; from the balsamic vinegar to the carmelized onions and thyme. We loved it. I did purchase a small 28oz rotisserie chicken that was on sale so we probably had twice as much chicken,and I only used about 5 1/2 cups of broth, but other than that I did not change anything else. My husband called it the best in comfort food. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

Horrible recipe. BV and rice are NOT a good combination. One thing I got out of it is that thyme encrusted chicken is delicious, so at least that part will be used again.

Delicious!! Yes, Risotto takes a while to cook, but it is worth the effort.  I added some sautéed mushrooms before adding the rice.  I also halved the balsamic since my Wife isn't a big fan.  She really liked it though.  The balsamic adds a nice sweetness along with the caramelized onions.  Definitely a keeper!

Finally! I have tried risotto a few times and every time has not been very good.  But this was wonderful.  I make it into a side dish and cooked the chicken a different way separately.  I also added fresh mushrooms to the onion balsamic mixture and that really made the dish!

Great recipe!  After making it as directed we experimented with other ideas.  Our favorite is spinach and artichoke! We prepare the risotto, onions and chicken as directed.  Then we microwave a package of frozen chopped spinach and a can of artichoke hearts and mix them in at the end with the chicken and onions.  They add a nice flavor and we serve it with fresh parmesan cheese.  I sometimes substitute the last 1/2 cup of chicken broth with whole milk, to make it a little creamier.  Wonderful base recipe!

Absolutely fabulous for my first time making risotto.  I thought it tasted great!  Kids may have liked it better either with less balsamic or maybe if I would have had a better quality.  It wasn't their favorite, but oh well, more for me!!

I was not a fan of this recipe. The balsamic vinegar overwhelmed the dish in my opinion. I followed the recipe to the letter and found the time was closer to 1-1/2 hours, 7 cups of broth was too much--made the rice soggy. I added parmesan cheese as a garnish, but it didn't help the taste of the balsamic vinegar at all.

I hate to give a bad review, really I do, but the flavor had WAY too much balsamic, even with 2 onions. After the dish was complete I had to find a way to tame it. I ended up adding about 1/2 cup cream, about a half dozen sliced mushrooms, 2 tsp bacon fat and 2 tsp sugar. By doing this I was able to save the dish, but even after this I still did not get a single compliment. And when were the onions caramelized? They were browned, not caramelized.  And what's with the chicken? This recipe was highly disappointing. I will not be making it again.

I thought this was great just the way it is. I do really like balsamic vinegar, so keep that in mind, but I felt that the flavors were perfect. I used a sweet onion, which may have helped. I may make this without the chicken next time and serve it as a side dish to a flavorful chicken dish, but it's definitely being added to my list. This is also the first risotto my husband has liked that isn't loaded down with nearly a cup of cheese.

This was an fantastic dish! I used 1 large onion, and instead of removing them from the heat right away, I let the balsalmic (1 tbsp) reduce for a couple minutes before removing it. I used about a half of a rotisserie chicken, and served it with a salad and galic toast- delicious!

The flavor of the balsamic vinegar was nice. I didn't add chicken to the dish because I used the risotto as a side. It's best eaten immediately.

The onions and balsamic vinegar were the best part of this dish. It was a delicious idea.  However, the cooking time for the risotto is off. It took more like 35-40 mins to make the right texture.   I'm not sure why it's called roasted chicken in the title, when there's no instruction on how to make the chicken. I ended up using a George Forman grill, while seasoning the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.   As a note, it makes far more than 4 servings, unless you're eating far more than you should. As most leftovers, it wasn't very good the next day. So I'd say eat it when you make it.

So good! Recipe definitely took longer than the suggested 20 min to make the risotto but it was worth it. I used a huge vidalia onion and 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar, which made for an amazing flavor. I'm going to add asparagus next time.

Great recipe! You definately need patience and constant attention to cooking the risotto. I added gorgonzola and mushrooms as well. The second time I made it, I switched out the chicken with shrimp and crab. Sooo good!

This was a good, easy recipe, although it definitely took longer than 20 minutes, but overall I had it ready less than an hour after I started cooking (I used a store-bought rotisserie chicken.) I definitely recommend using 2 onions, and adding mushrooms - I added 8 oz. of baby bellas, and reducing the balsamic vinegar. I used 1 T, I think 2 T would have worked better. I also used white grape juice instead of wine, since we are a no-alcohol family, and probably only about 6 cups of chicken broth. I think sundried tomatoes, or a good tangy salad, would have worked well with this. Thanks!

My first risotto!  So yummy:)  Love the balsamic flavor and how easy it is to make!  I used only 6 cups of broth and it turned out perfect, it did take a while for it to cook though, longer than 20 minutes.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, and for those that have no idea what to do with the rest of the rotisserie chicken...use it in another dish.  I have mine chopped and ready for enchiladas later this week!

Delicious! Very straight-forward and surprisingly simple to make... In lieu of roasting, opted to saute cut-up chicken breasts in butter. Also, used standard long-grain white rice [hangs head in shame]... Even so, makes a great dish (just takes longer with inferior rice).

This was pretty good, but the balsamic vinegar was definitely way too overpowering. I would cut it to 1/8 cup next time.

This was very good, a nice change but I was not as blown away as I wish.  Defenitely reduce the balsamic vinegar to about 1/8 cup, and make sure to cook the onions on low for awhile to get the carmalizing.  Left out fresh thyme, sprinkled some romano on top, was very good. Roasted chicken is always a time saver and so moist, liked it, may make it again.

This was my first attempt at risotto and being honest I have never had risotto so I have nothing to compare it to but it was delicious.  I followed previous posters' advice and only used 5-6 cups of broth.  I did however leave out the chicken altogether and served it is as a side for salmon, it went together beautifully.  I was also surprised at how easy it really was, time consuming but easy and I was still able to make a salad and other prepartions while cooking it so it was not that bad.

My daughter (17) made this for her annual Christmas potluck with girlfriends.  It was a HUGE hit!  Only change she made was to remove most of the onions from the pan to a side bowl (to add the balsamic) and then reuse that pan for the risotto.  I think cooking the rice with some onion gives it more flavor.  I would highly recommend rotisserie chicken because it does boost up the flavor.

This is a spectacular recipe, and this is my first time making it!  I used brown rice, and was a bit worried about the slow cookingo of it because it was "instant" rice.  I wound up using 4-5 cups of broth, and apple cider vinegar instead of white wine since I never have white wine in my home.  We put some Old Bay on the chicken when we cooked it, and when I put everything together, I added some red pepper flakes.  The red pepper wasn't necessary.  This was surprisingly filling and the tang is just succulent!  Definitely a keeper in my repertoire when I have the time for it!  (That 20 minutes for the rice was probably closer to 30-40.)

This was much better than I thought it was going to be.  Such simple ingredients come together so nicely!  I think the balsamic vinegar makes the dish.  I baked a whole chicken and used about half of it and it was plenty of chicken.

This is really tasty! I used up some leftover turkey I had frozen from Thanksgiving, and it turned out great.
It took a lot longer than 20 minutes to cook, maybe 35-40 min, but I will definitely make this again.

the recipe overall is very good. for more flavor in the risotto try using 2 cups on wine and 5 cups of broth heated together and use that to put into the risotto. a nice touch to this is dried cranberries and some fresh thyme

This was the best thing I have ever tasted in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used 3 small onions instead of 1 and added some fresh sliced mushrooms. Other than that, I followed the recipe exact! I have been raving about this to my family and friends and I can't stop thinking about it! Thanks, Michele!

I've made this twice, and I'd rate it 4.5 if I could. Very tasty, very easy, but rather time consuming. I made it once with precooked chicken breast strips and it turned out fine, but it was better when I made it with rotisserie chicken. The second time I also added 1 tsp of sugar to the onions along with the balsamic vinegar, and I added some dried oregano and basil to the rice as it sauteed, and it was much tastier.

i've never had risotto before so i can't compare it to any experience.  the cooking time was about 1 hour 15 minutes and i was amazed to see all 7 cups of broth soaked up.  the rice was still a little firm but it was very creamy.  i found that i had to stir stir stir or it would stick to the bottom of the skillet. following the receipe exactly left the dish a bit bland but i think adding mushrooms and maybe red peppers (for colour) would make this dish a 5 star.  cooking the onions slow and marinadeing them in the balsamic was a nice flavour.

This recipe was great! I made a few adjustments... only used about 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar and I only needed 6 cups of broth. I added salt and pepper and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to the rice as it cooked. Once it was almost done I added approx. 1/4-1/2 cup parmesan cheese. Delicious!

Really flavorful recipe. One of the best recipes I've found on allrecipes. And pretty healthy!

Changes I made according to other reviews:
-6 cups of broth instead of 7
-I just cut up some chicken breasts and cooked them on the stovetop before adding it to this dish-- I don't think you necessarily need roasted chicken
-It ended up taking up way longer than 20 minutes to incorporate all the broth. I think it was something like 45 minutes for me. 

Next time, I'd like to try putting in mushrooms as others have suggested-- I think that will be yummy.

The balsamic vinegar was overpowering.  If I make it again, and I'm not certain I will, I'd cut the vinegar in half.  Also, difficult to put the 7 cups of broth into the risotto.

Just ok. I was disappointed since I saw all the great reviews. The balsamic vinegar really overpowered the rest of the ingredients. Next time I make this I'm only adding a teaspoon or two instead of a 1/4 cup.

I'm not much of a cook and was looking for a way to use up a abundance of chicken broth I had on hand and ran across this recipe. We love caramelized onions so I found this to be a easy perfect recipe for left over chicken.
It was even better the next day!

This risotto was great!  Unfortunately, I did not realize that I was out of chicken until I went to make this.  So I changed this into a Grilled Steak with Risotto and Caramelized Onions.  I grilled slices of steak medium rare and chopped them up and added the pieces at the end instead of the chicken.  I also used half and half beef broth and chicken broth.  And for a final touch I added about a quarter of a cup of grated parmesan when adding the onions back in at the end.  Delish!

Made this for dinner last night and I thought it was very good.  I followed the advise of others and cut the vinegar back to 1/8 cup, I could see where 1/4 cup would overpower the dish and added some chopped garlic while cooking onions.  My picky teenager even said she liked it.

This was the first recipe that I made from this site and it turned out very, very well. The only thing as others have posted is the cook time, it should be about an hour to an hour and a half.

I received The Pampered Chef rice cooker as a xmas gift, until then, I never cooked rice because it never turned out.  Now it always does, perfectly and cuts cooking time to 1/3 I used Risotto for this recipe & added peas but the really tasty part is the caramelized onions and balsamic. Great recipe! Thanks!

We really enjoyed this.  The flavor was great.  When I cooked the onions I threw in some fresh mushrooms.  At the last minute I threw in some fresh asperagus.  Well worth the time it takes to make.

This was my first attempt at making risotto and it was a hit-even with my very picky 16 yr,old.  I made it twice in one week. I roasted my chicken with some garlic powder, salt, pepper and a little  basil.  Very easy-just takes patience!  Will definitely make again-probably this week!

I used a very good quality balsamic vinegar, however, I preferred no using it after all.  Otherwise, it was a great dish....I might try making it without balsamic next time.

My husband and I really enjoy this dish. I've made it without the wine before when I   didn't have any on hand and it was still good. The wine does make it better. I probably make this once a month.

This made for a great dinner! To get some extra veggies, I added some chopped carrots with the rice and tossed in some sauteed asparagus when I mixed in the onions. Also, I backed off on the balsamic a bit, because I'm not a huge fan. Overall, a good recipe. Thanks!

This truely is a wonderful recipe. What I did for the chicken was bought boneless/skinless chicken breast, cut it into chunks, and cooked it in olive oil and an herb chicken seasoning mix. It was perfect with the risotto and onions. I'll definitely make this again. It's wonderful left over.

I cooked this in a large quantity and so had difficulty cooking the risotto consistently. I used a lemon/olive oil marinade with the chicken and baked it, which complemented well with the risotto. But the time-consuming nature of this recipe might call for store-bought rotisserie chicken next time in a smaller quantity.

Not bachelor friendly, largely because of the time factor.

THe review from the person who lives out of the USA and had to use white rice was spot on. The white rice took about 32 minutes to get al dente, and did not require seven cups of broth (if serving 4). 5 was more than enough. I also added two cloves of garlic directly into the rice as I was adding the broth, and that really "kicked it up a notch." Try adding steamed broccoli florets for a nice addition.

I made this almost exactly to recipe, except I shitake mushrooms and used only 5 cups of broth. Turned out great, wonderful, warm, home cooked comfort food. The only thing I would change would be to add less onion. I felt is was a little overpowering and I'm not a huge fan of onions.

I made this recipe without the onions, and it came out very good, but also very rich.  I subtracted one cup of broth, and replaced it with a cup of Parmesan cheese.  The cheese is probably what made it so rich, but I really liked that addition.  It turned a main course kind of risotto into something that you would want on the side, since it's so rich.

Oh my god! I love this dish. I didn't change the amount of vinegar as I am a big fan of Balsalmic. I have made it a few times and I added asparagus one time and green beans the next. Both were great.

This recipe was good- I loved the caramalized onions and balsamic together- but it wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.  I am used to making my risotto with parmesan cheese and I think next time I will add some to kick this recipe up a bit.

This recipe is fabulous!! I thought risotto would be a challenge, but preparing it was quite simple; adding the broth, however, can be quite tedious. Contrary to other posts, the presentation was quite nice.

Delicious! I loved this! It was so worth it. I was amazed that it tasted so good and all i had to do was chop onions and some chicken (I was tempted to add more ingredients but I was glad I didn't). So easy to make! Based on another reviewers' suggestion i reduced the amount of balsamic vinegar. I also did not put in the full amount of broth because it did not absorb well.

This recipe is fantastic! I added about a half a pound of asparagus about half way through the cooking time and it turned out great!  Careful on adding salt though, I used lower sodium broth and there was no need for any additional salt.  Definitely making this again!!

I used less broth and added garlic and mushrooms to the onion.  I thought it was okay, but my husband loved it - thus the four stars.

This is a great recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviewers.  Used 5 cups of homemade stock, and put in about a cup of thawed frozen peas and some grated parmigiana reggiano at the end.  I also added about 8 ounces of a "gourmet" mushroom mix, sauteed at the same time the onions are added back in.  We had this as a side dish with roasted chicken as the entree.

This risotto was just great!  It took REALLY long though, and eventually I had to crank up the heat and cover the pan for it to get done.  We'll keep tinkering with this one.

Tasted wonderful!  My only complaint is the length of time it took for the Risotto to absorb the broth.  This meal took me an hour and a half, not 45 minutes.  I used about 6 cups of broth.  I wonder if the rice used may have some effect on the amount of broth and the length of the cooking time.  I used Italian rice...

I made without modifying and it worked well and was great tasting; however, I was a little disappointed with the blandness of the presentation and the lack of vegetable content. Next time, I'll make it and add mushrooms and spinach in the end, sprinkling parmesan on top so I can have a one-dish meal.

This is tasty but I agree with the previous review.  It looks like slop and seemed more like a side dish or a lunch meal to me.  I would do chicken breasts separately next time if I were to have it for dinner.

This was very delicious.  I gave it 4 stars only because of the presentation.  It looks like slop!  I will definately make it again, but I will cook chicken breasts separately and serve them whole or in strips over the rice.

This is so delicious.  I didn't need the full amount of broth, just kept adding until the risotto tasted done.  Definitely use a rotiserrie chicken from the store.  It adds to the rich flavor and the chicken is so tender.

I also increased the risotto to two cups and used about 6 cups of broth. I added way too much balsamic vinegar, which I typically love, but this was way too overwhelming. Only a few tablespoons would work.

Excellent flavor but I definately agree with the previous reviewer that all the other ingrdients do take a back seat to the risotto. Next time I would not add the chicken to this dish, I would just serve the risotto on the side. We really felt this was more of a side dish than a main course. I will make this again!

I love risotto, but had never attempted to make it.. This recipe was very easy and delicious! I only used about 5 cups of broth as others have mentioned. Also I took the lazy route and purchased a roasted chicken. I even used the same pan for the entire recipe which made the clean up much faster. Thanks!

Awesome! This was so good. The only thing was that I didn't seem to need all 7 cups of broth, but that wasn't really a problem, I just didn't use all of it. Highly recomended.

This recipe was delicious! I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and it was perfect for my son and I with even some left over. I cooked a boneless chicken breast in the microwave while carmelizing the onions and cooking the rice. I also added a small can of mushrooms. The meal was complete in about 40 minutes. Very easy to make and is definitely going into my recipe box.

After reading the reviews, I was excited to try this recipe.  However, I was very disappointed.  It took much longer to prepare then the recipe stated, and then we did not like it at all.  In fact I threw it out after all the time I spent standing at the stove preparing it.  I can't even think of any variations to make it better.  This was a bad one.

This recipe has a lot of great flavors in it, but I actually had to change some things.  The grocery store didn't have any risotto, so instead I used orzo and cooked that in the chicken broth.  I also added mushrooms in with the onions; and actually sauteed them at the very end and added the balsamic to that.  Since I didn't cook the risotto, I added the chicken (which were 3 breasts cooked in the oven with poultry seasoning)to the pan with onions and mushrooms, and mixed well with the butter.  I served it with a cesaer side salad, and it turned out great!  My boyfriend liked the recipe a lot, especially the onions and mushrooms and has asked me to sautee them in balsamic vinegar all the time!!

I accidentally misread the recipe and used WAY MORE olive oil in the risotto than called for so I didn't use the butter... and I did add more rice b/c I accidentally added more chicken than what I could estimate was a pound and was trying to even it out. But even with all my mistakes, it turned out fabulous so I will have to put this in my NO-FAIL recipe category and will make again and again!

I would of been happy without the balsamic vinegar.  It added for a strange flavor that did not seem to go with the chicken base behind the whole recipe.  I would of expected a creamy chicken dinner instead of a brown vinegar chicken dinner.  Definately time consuming, no one in my family liked it and the recipe was followed to a "t"

This is awesome. It is a bit of work, with caramelizing the onions and stirring the risotto, but it is all worth it!
