A nice twist on alfredo!  I did make a few modifications though.  I substituted chicken broth for the butter, lowfat evaporated milk for the regular skim, and lowfat ricotta for the part-skim.  I also added a hefty shake of white pepper.  The consistency was smooth and perfect!  Also, no need to steam the broccoli separately - just throw it in the pasta pot during the last 2-3 minutes of boiling.

I've made regular fettucine alfredo a hundred times but just recently started adding ricotta.  As if it wasn't artery clogging enough, right?  Anyway, the way I do it is to use full milk ricotta and whole milk instead of skim.  Of course this is super rich but it's not a meal for every day either.  I'm not crazy for the taste of parm, so I don't use that much...I basically throw a small handful in at the end and mix it in.   Also, make sure that the broccoli is fresh and not frozen.  Remember to use salt and pepper to your own liking and not necessarily what the recipe calls for.  Everyone has different tastes.  I'm sure the right amount of salt will make a big difference in whether this dish is bland or not.

Very bland. I'd suggest keeping the starchy pasta water to thin the sauce out because straight from the recipe its way too thick and dries out once it's incorporated with the pasta. If I were to make this again I might melt in a sharper cheese to punch up the flavor. This needs more salt and seasonings.

really good and quick recipe. since i didn't have any cream in the house, i was so happy to find this recipe, and i had all the ingredients in my fridge. Instead of broccoli, i blanched some sweet snap peas and added those, along with some baked chicken. I would recommend serving this dish immediately after adding the noodles to the sauce, or else it gets too thick and the noodles stick together.

Family loved it. Has the alfredo taste, but it a bit lighter, due to the ricotta. Excellent!

I tried this tonight and it was fantastic!  I hae a quick feetucine recipe that I make a lot, but since I'm on a diet, I wanted something lower in fat and calories--this did the trick!  I added some shrimp and a little more parmesan.  Superb recipe, and a little goes a long way.  Very filling.

For the most part, it was pretty simple.  I found that I only needed about 5-7 minutes for the milk/butter/flour to thicken, not 15 minutes.  I also took someone else's advice and threw the broccoli in the boiling water towards the end of the pasta cook time; it worked out well and less dishes to clean!  It was definitely not as rich as a restaurant-style alfredo, but I'm guessing that's because of the ricotta, which hopefully made it a bit healthier though.  It still had a great flavor!

This was delicious!  Almost a perfect substitute for the real fettuccini alfredo!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe but if I were to do it again I may add just a tad more milk (or less ricotta/parmesean) since the sauce was quite thick...almost pasty.  The taste was excellent and both me and my healthy food hating husband loved it!

It's okay, nothing like good alfredo sauce because of the ricotta. Since i had some ricotta that I needed to get rid of I thought I'd try it. I also added shrimp which was a great addition. I think the recipe should include more salt. Good meal to make if you have the ingredients on hand.

This was delicious...so delicious my 7 year old was asking to eat it for breakfast the next morning. My husband is vegetarian, he loved it as well. I added garlic and mushrooms, otherwise the recipe was the same. This is one I will continue to make for sure!

This was really bland.  I even added some crushed fresh garlic and it still didn't taste good.  It smelled wonderful, but it didn't taste at all like it smelled.  I may try playing with it sand seeing if I can make it less bland.  Maybe using cornstarch inseat of the roux and using more garlic and such.

We loved this recipe.  I was just looking for a recipe to use up some ricotta cheese.  I didn't change a thing - it came out perfectly; even my 2 yr old loved it.  This is now going in the dinner rotation!

Didn't have broccoli so used fresh grated zucchini and grean beans from the garden. I also added some Morningstar Farms Chik'n Meal Starters. Didn't stray from the recipe for the sauce. Very good! The trick really is to keep stirring at all times.

This was so so for me.  I found it was a little bland.  I added garlic and white wine for added flavor, but it seemed like it still needed something.  The idea is great, just needs more seasoning I think.

Really good base recipe.  I did add a whole head of garlic, 1 cup of shredded marbled cheese, and a half cup of cottage cheese.  Fresh parsley would have added an awesome finish to this recipe but unfortunately, I didn't have any on me. However, this is a great recipe to use up leftover ricotta cheese. Nice to find a recipe for ricotta that's NOT lasagna.  Thanks!

What an easy, quick and easily adjusted recipe! Changes I made based on tastes and what we had on hand:  1. Used Egg Noodles 2. Sauteed onions first, then made the roux 3. Increased Kosher salt & fresh cracked pepper tremendously (I think this is key to eliminating the blandness of ricotta) 4. Added 2 cloves finely chopped garlic after the sauce came together 5. Followed the suggestion of throwing broccoli in with the pasta water during the last two minutes, plus added whole grape tomatoes in the water as well  It's important to do the sauce relatively slowly or it's not going to come out right. Also, don't be stingy with the salt and fresh cracked pepper.  This was absolutely delicious, and my husband (who admits he doesn't like "white sauce" or ricotta for that matter) actually enjoyed it very much. My picky kids both liked it too.

I just made this for dinner and it was really good!  It is rich and easy to make.  My husband is an alfredo fiend and he wanted to rate this 5.5 stars.  I am glad to find a healthier alternative to the heavy cream version.  I did add a lot of garlic for extra flavor.

I used whole wheat linguine, fat free half & half and fat free parm in this recipe-the 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the milk made it very creamy.  I sauteed garlic,fresh basil, mushrooms and scallions as well because of some of the comments about blandness. used the chicken and broccoli as well- It was excellent-will definitely make again.  I didnt even miss the fat!!

This turned out great. I did not think the texture was strange like some of the other reviewers.  However it does need a little bit more flavor like more parm. cheese or garlic.  Otherwise it was simple to make and I will probably make it again.

I didn't mind this. I didn't have broccoli so I used frozen spinach. I also put in musrooms and chicken. I cooked the pasta...while that was cooking I made the sauce...I steamed the spinach and then fried up the mushrooms and chicken. When the mushrooms and chicken were done and put the sauce back in to heat it up some more then I poured it over the pasta. It wasn't fat free as I used whole milk and full cream butter...but it turned out really nice. Oh and I added powdered garlic to the sauce as well as parsley and salt and pepper.

I'm not sure the difference between two stars and three, but this recipe was pretty blah.  The ricotta and flour DO give it a wierd consistency.  I don't think the reviewer who "curdled" it actually did curdle it, that's just the way it turns out.  Not a bad flavor, but I'm pretty sure I won't make it again.

Like other reviews, I tasted it as after adding the ingredients and found it to be bland.  I added what I add on hand...garlic powder, paprika (which I like in creamed pasta and potato dishes) plus mozzarella cheese...cheddar or colby would have been better because it was stringy.  I usually make my alfredo style sauce without a recipe, but I wanted to try this one because of the ricotta cheese.  It really needs a lot more to flavor it.

This was a great dish!  It's not Alfredo but that's why I liked it.  I had no problems with consistency or texture of the sauce as other reviewers have mentioned, but it is important to use butter and keep stirring any béchamel sauce.

I found this recipe when we wanted to make alfredo but did not have cream or whole milk in the house.  In fact, we used powdered milk.  We used LOTS of garlic (we're big fans of garlic) & used peppers & a little onion and scallops and shrimp but definitely used the sauce recipe.  This is definitely a repeat item in our house!

Very yummy, but I made a few changes. I added 3 chicken breasts that I seasoned with olive oil, basil, salt and pepper and baked for about an hour, turning once. I just chopped them up and added them to the pasta along with the sauce. I also used frozen broccoli, and 2% milk. I just added the broccoli to the pasta water as it was boiling, for the last few minutes. I also added about a teaspoon of chicken bouillon to the sauce which really helped the flavour, but if you do this, season it to taste when you add the salt. My husband took it to work the next day and said it was very good reheated as well.

Not bad and between he ease of making it and the fact that it could easily be a one pan meal I can't give this recipe less than 3 stars.  I followed the recipe to a T and flavor-wise it will require some tweaks for our preferences.  That being said; I think it's a good base and I expected the ricotta to give it the texture it did.  It looked positively rich in the pan!

We've been making this one for years and it almost always turns out perfectly.  It is great with or without chicken and/or broccoli, most times we just make the sauce.

This was really tasty! My husband even liked it and that really surprised me!  He said it tasted like cream of broccoli soup over fettuccine. My only changes to the recipe were using frozen broccoli and using a few shakes of dried parsley since we didn't have fresh.  I will probably make this again, but I will toss the broccoli in the food processor to make it a less chunky sauce. Thank!

Not bad for lower fat. I used romano cheese instead of parm, needed more salt, but all in all, well worth the trip to the store for ingredients.

This was very bland, even after adding fresh garlic.  I think with some other seasonings it may be ok but I felt like I had to keep adding salt to get any enjoyment out of it.

I loved the addition of ricotta and personally preferred the use of skin milk and lower fat options. It was a little thick and bland straight from the recipe, but when I added some garlic butter, it was perfect.

Did not care for this at all.  Very boring.  Riccotta did nothing for the broccoli and pasta.  Sorry, but I've made much better recipes.  But thanks for sharing.

I think I made a mistake with the measurement of ricotta cheese.  It's way too thick, and looks like spaghetti pie when it's in the bowl in the refrigerator. Boyfriend said its good, but I think it needs adjusting...or I did something wrong. It called for 2/3 ricotta cheese, well I only had a 1/3 measuring spoon and put 2 big scoops of that in. 2/3's right? lol. If it wasn't so thick it would be delish. I'll try again

I thought this was pretty tasty! I mostly followed it as stated but did sauté garlic with the butter at the beginning and also added in 1 tsp Italian seasoning, as another reviewer suggested.  For some reason my sauce didn't thicken before adding the ricotta, so I added in some corn starch. This worked perfectly.  I think the flavor and texture was great!

This was a lot of trouble (especially the constant stirring) for a bland-blah recipe. The texture and taste was nothing like Alfredo. I wanted something tasty to use up ricotta cheese I had and this wasn't the one. I think more cheese might help, but the idea was to keep it lo-fat. I'll keep looking!

My family really enjoys this sauce, especially my husband, who doesn't like creamy anything. No matter what milk/cream you use, it always comes out smooth with a nice consistency. It makes a lot, so you can have left overs one night or freeze the rest.

Delicious! I used what I had on hand (namely spaghettini and 2% milk), but it was so yummy. I did find the sauce a bit thick after it had cooled down a bit. Next time I will thin it a bit with some pasta water.

Meh. Not bad but I much prefer the other two Alfredo recipes we use (cream cheese or half and half). I thought it was exceptionally bland and desperately in need of spices. It definitely needs more salt and pepper than the recipe suggests. Also I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but once the sauce started to cool it began clumping. It was worth a shot since we had ricotta leftover, but I won't be repeating this one.

This was ok. It satisfied the need for Alfredo, but it is definitely bland and the sauce is dry the next day. I followed other reviewers advice and added extra milk-probably close to another cup-and it was still dry. Also had to add salt and pepper while eating it because the extra I added during cooking still wasn't enough.

I live out of town and didn't have some of the ingredients; so I changed some. Instead of broccoli I used red & green peppers sautéed in virgin olive oil. I also cut up some cooked chicken (about 1 1/2 breasts).  I didn't have any ricotta cheese so I used lowfat cottage cheese. I also put a few pinches of onion and garlic powder.  Sounds like I changed a lot ;)).  And prepared it the same way.  My husband really enjoyed it after I sprinkled it with cayenne pepper. For the leftover; I had to add latte milk to the container; however, the next it was great!!!

I've made this several times since I first found it and it turns out great every time. I usually bake several chicken breasts, cut them into chunks, and add them at the end, along with the broccoli. YUM!

A nice way to get away from the jar alfredo sauce.  I added spinach and chicken to add a little more nutrition. I substituted the butter for Brummel and Brown Yogurt Spread and the ricotta for low fat (not fat free).  Modifications made it around 315 calories per serving.

It was definitely quick and easy, but the taste was very bland. I added some fresh diced garlic, a splash of sherry, more fresh ground black pepper and a squeeze of lemon.  That seemed to give it a bit more pizazz, however it did have a somewhat grainy texture even before I added anything.  Maybe this is because I used the part skim ricotta?

Needed twice the flour stated. Would have been much better with heavy cream, no ricotta and twice the parmesan. Won't use this again.

I loved this recipe. It was the right amount of creamyness with almost half the fat that you would find in an ordinary alfredo recipe. ALthough I agree with the person that adding garlic and crushed red pepper would be an excellent addition to the recipe. THe recipe was light but it must be served immediately.

It was okay to me.  Bf liked it, although he said there was too much of a flour taste.  I'd be willing to say that I might not have cooked the flour long enough, so it could be my fault.  I didn't think it was that flavorful--I thought it might need some garlic or onion powder.  Thanks for the recipe--used up some of my ricotta!

This was very tasty and very easy to make.  I added 1 TBSP minced garlic to the butter, 1 tsp hot red pepper flakes as others recommended and a splash of lemon juice.  I also added a can of Lump Crab Meat to the sauce when I added the broccoli.  VERY GOOD EASY MEAL!!!

This dish is very, very bland. It could be good if you add a lot of more flavors like garlic, more parmesan and maybe some fresh basil. I will try again with these changes, I like the fact that is so light.

I really liked this recipe. I didn't use the broccoli, I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and I added a bit of basil. The only thing I would do different is add a bit less pepper.

I made this with chicken instead of broccoli.  It was ok, but not wonderful.  We didn't really like the ricotta flavor with the noodles.  I need to keep the ricotta mixtures with stuffed shells and lasagna!

It was creamy and had good texture, but it was lacking in the spice department.  I thought it should have more flavor.

I made this 2 hours ahead of meal time and put it into a covered corning dish.  I heated it in the oven.  The consistency was like a casserole - but way too many noodles for the 6 servings.  Bland, bland, bland.  Had to add salt and still did not like it.

This was quite good, but needed a little additional seasoning to be really great.  Since my frozen broccoli "florets" were more like saplings, I served this on a bed of fettucine topped with a cooked chicken breast, then the broccoli on top of the chicken, topped with the sauce!  It looked very pretty :)

This recipe took WAY longer than the 15 min. of prep that it mentioned, and was really not worth the wait.  It tasted just ok  I would say.  The sauce was kind of a strange consistency.  When I put the broccoli in the sauce, it all fell apart.  If I were to make this again (which isnt probable), I would put the sauce on the noodles only, and then place the broccoli on top of the noodles.

I'm not sure what I did, but I curdled the sauce. Despite that, we added quite a bit of Chicken Kassla (tastes almost like a ham chunk). Despite the chicken and broccoli, it still didnt have much  flavour, although this definately could have been due to the curdling. I'm not sure if the lower fat was worth the result.
