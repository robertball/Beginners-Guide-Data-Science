I like this recipe.  It is great basic starter chia pudding.  Very easy to do.  I do a couple of things differently, though.  I use honey instead of maple syrup in the initial mix with the chia pudding.  I also do not mix additional maple syrup/honey with the strawberries before serving.  I simply prefer mine less sweet.  And if the berries are good, I feel they are flavorful enough on their own.  Also I ONLY use greek yogurt when I make this.  I just feel the density of greek yogurt holds up better with the chia seeds.  And lastly, after the initial 30 minute soak, i gently mix the ingredients to redistribute.  I then divide it into pint size jars to sit overnight.  These are perfect size for me to easily grab in the morning and head out the door.  FYI, I also like this without any additional fruit, etc.  On it's own is good, too.  Also, if you like this recipe, consider checking out the recipe for Almond Strawberry Chia Seed Pudding on allrecipes, as well.  It's wonderful!!

I have been experimenting with chia seed recipes and I really liked this one.  I used almond slivers that i just sprinkled over the top.  The maple syrup added just enough sweetness without it being too sweet.

Dessert for breakfast and guilt free, to boot. That’s what this is. I saw this recipe in the Jan 2018 magazine. It suggested using dairy free yogurt to keep it vegan, which I did.  I added a bit of cinnamon and cardamom, too. What a treat. Thank you for the recipe.

Tried chia pudding at First Watch restaurant & loved it, so looked up some recipes. This one, I agree, is an easy basic one. I did not make the "topping," either, but used just fresh fruit.  Calories were pretty high per 1/2 cup serving - about 125 without the fruit. The maple syrup added about 100 calories (25 per serving), so I may use brown sugar Truvia next time. Going to experiment with cocoa powder and chocolate almond milk, also. This is great for "grab and go" breakfast or for a mid-morning or -afternoon snack.

This was excellent.  I used Greek yogurt instead of regular because I like the taste better  (Chobani Simply 100 Vanilla) - i did not use the extra maple syrup as it was sweet enough - i may omit it next time I make it (tonight!) I'm going to try parceling it out into smaller containers too to make the servings more even.  Overall this was delish and easy!

I gotixed reviews from my family members on this recipe. I thought this turned out pretty good, but  I did make some changes. I only had one carton of strawberry Greek yogurt (5.3 oz); so I used that and 1/2 c mashed strawberries, then added the milk until I had a total volume of the two cups. I used agave instead of the maple syrup - milder flavor. The flavor was great, but the texture of the chia seeds kind of threw us. Next time I will blend it all in the blender to  chop the chia seeds up more.

I really like this and was surprised at how delicious it is. I didn’t care for how loose it was so next time I’ll lessen the milk and increase the yogurt but I’ll definitely be making this again and I look forward to trying it with different fruit and yogurt flavor combinations.

I didn’t have honey so I used trivia nectar. Using the nectar you have to be careful of the amount. For 1/4 cup honey I used about 6 teaspoons of nectar.

I loved this recipe very much. The only little tweak I did was. I made 6 servings. The recipe calls for a cup and a half of Greek yogurt. So, I added one cup of vanilla Greek yogurt and a half of strawberry Greek yogurt. Loved it!

This is my new last-minute lunch. I honestly use about 1/2 T of sugar instead of the maple syrup just to simplify. I'll pack this with a cup of sliced strawberries and some granola. Healthy lunch solution!

I like to make this recipe w/ coconut milk and plain Greek nonfat yogurt. I don’t use the extra maple syrup and I add coconut chips as a topping before serving. So delicious!

I followed the directions as written with the listed ingredients. Mine came out soupy. I recently travelled to Quebec City and had various flavors of chia pudding. The pudding was much thicker in Canada. So, I like the flavors of this pudding and love the maple syrup however next time I will change the ratio of milk to pudding. I plan on adding about 1/2 cup more of yogurt.

This was pretty good but I found it to be a bit on the thin side for my taste.  To change that, the second time I made it with 12 ounces of Greek yogurt, 8 oz unsweetened vanilla almond coconut milk, 1/4 tsp. Chia seeds and a touch of salt.

I used Greek yogurt and added 1/4 cup unsweetened, unflavored whey protein powder.  I omitted the topping and just added sliced fresh strawberries.  Delicious!

I am hooked! I have to have this in my fridge all the time now and everyone that tries it wants the recipe. I use just the 1st 6 ingredients (sometimes omit the salt) and add some dried cherries (craisins don't give the same results) and it's so addicting. I stir after 1st 30-45 minutes then leave alone until next morning. DELISH!

Delicious and super easy to make! I substituted the almond milk with regular milk and it tasted great! I noticed that with the regular milk substitute most of the flavour comes from the yogurt, so make sure you use a kind you really like. Or try different variations of yogurt to change up the flavour a bit.

I loved it!  What a great way to incorporate chia seeds into the diet!  Overnight in the refrigerator gave it a nice consistency.  Will definitely fix this again!

I didn't add yogurt since I am lactose intolerant and used honey since it's what I had and swore I had maple syrup in my cupboard. Also, I topped mine with bananas, strawberries and blueberries and simply let it set in the fridge overnight and with that said, it was absolutely to die for! Before I knew it I was at the bottom of my dish. I will certainly be having this for breakfast again and again. I meant to take a picture but by the time I remembered it was too late. This is a great recipe, thanks.

I made some changes as I was looking for more protein and less sugar using ingredients on hand. Substituted Greek yogurt and used 1.5 cups with 1.0 cups unsweetened almond milk. No additional sweetener added, 1 tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt with .25 cup Chia seeds. Added 1 tbsp more Chia seed as was not as thick as I wanted after an hour in the fridge. Served next morning with fresh sliced strawberries no added sugar. Very tasty with a good vanilla flavourful and thick but not stiff texture. A Keeper!

This has become my go-to breakfast to bring to work as it is easy to prepare a large batch to last all week. I've been adding a tablespoon of ground flax before serving for the extra health benefits, and it works well and adds a bit of a grainy texture. I love how the texture is so much like tapioca pudding, it makes me feel like a kid eating dessert! Can never get tired of it, which is great for someone who doesn't have much of an appetite for breakfast normally.

Good for breakfast. I made a single serving in a mason jar.  I used frozen raspberries that I defrosted- however I skipped tossing them in the maple syrup because I didn't want it to be too sweet.

I've been trying to find a fast and healthy breakfast that I like for years.  I'm not normally a yogurt fan, but the mixture of the yogurt (I used plain Greek, as others suggested) and the almond milk with the texture of the Chia seeds really fit the bill.  I love it!  I used huckleberries and added a bit of huckleberry syrup I made once I spooned it out.  This is a great basic recipe you can really have fun with..

Love this. I used agave nectar in the pudding instead of maple because maple is not my favorite thing.  I put raspberries on top and almonds. I just love this and you can keep trying various fruits forever.
