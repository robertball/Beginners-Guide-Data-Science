Followed the recipe as written. These were good, but not great. I would highly suggest seasoning the pork chops with salt and pepper as you're browning them, because although the sauce is flavorful enough, the chops themselves were on the bland side. Also, my chops turned out dry and I don't know if this was due to the long simmering time or what. On the plus side, this recipe is easy and presents nicely.

The secret to moist pork chops is to use bone in chops. The boneless chops dry out during the simmering process.

These pork chops were tender and juicy and had a lot of flavor.  We loved them!  I followed the recipe except for the mushrooms (didn't have any) and I left out the salt (personal preference).  This is a terrific quick and easy weeknight dinner that everyone will love.

Delicious!  I scaled this to 2 servings, but made half of the sauce.  I used a mix a colored peppers and sautéed them separately, topping the chops with them when plating.  The flavor of this is excellent, perfectly seasoned.  The only thing I would change next time is to cut back on the simmering time because my chops  dried out a bit, even though I used a very low simmer.  But that is an easy fix and I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this a quite few times so now I know what changes need to be made.  I make 2 chops but use a whole can of tomatoes.  There just isn't enough sauce and adding water dilutes it so use more tomatoes, about double the amount.  The cook time is way too much.  I seared 2 mins on each side.  They should be brown but not fully cooked.  Simmered for 15 mins, not 45 and another 5 after adding the mushrooms and bell pepper.  Added more mushrooms to make it a whole meal so I didn't have to make a side of veggies.  Granted, if you use really thick chops, you may want to simmer them longer but I would't suggest 45 mins.  I also throw in some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  Not necessary because the sauce is delicious but I wanted some spice.

I absolutely loved these pork chops! The only thing I did was added a little bit more seasoning since my family likes their food spicy but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a sure hit! It's been added to my recipe box for future use. The chops are juicy and tender...try it!

I put this in my Recipe Box because of it seemed to be a very healthy recipe...according to the nutritional information...although I wonder if it was calculated correctly?? Anyway..it was quite simple to make and it was VERY tasty! I used a 540 ml can of Alymers Cracked Black Peppercord and Roasted Garlic stewed tomatoes and the flavour was AMAZING!  I used a red pepper but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. The sauce was so good it might be good as a pasta sauce on it's own and I will defiantly try this with chicken.

* I did try this with chicken..not as good..something about the pork chops I guess!

Very good, easy to make and presents nicely.  I did use bone in chops so they didn't dry out and added red wine in place of the water for a tad more flavor.  Wine for the sauce and wine for the cook.  Doesn't get much better than that!  Served over polenta and with a simple side salad.  Thank you lutzflcat for the recipe.  Will go into my favorites file!

These pork chops are very good. I use diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the regular tomatoes and added black greek olives.

Very tender pork chops indeed! I used the same amounts for 4 chops instead and it's not too much, especially since we ate them with only a small side of mashed sweet potatoes. Will be making them again and this time, I will be sure to brown the mushrooms and chops more. Thanks for a great recipe!

I had a loin I wanted to use and something I could make in the slow cooker.  I upped the tomato to a 28oz can and omitted the 1/2 cup water.  I used all fresh herbs in place of the dry.  Also added some parsley and basil  that needed using up. I doubled the veggies and used red, yellow, green peps and a red onion.  So pretty and smelled fabulous.  I shredded the pork and served on my Beer Rolls.  Oh, I also added some crushed red pepper for added heat.  Nice and easy meal for a cold and busy day.  Will make again.

Really good. Didn't change much from the original recipe, just added some steamed spinach on top. Had it with a sweet potato, which was good, but I think it might be better with some pasta.

I will probably try this recipe but will use red peppers instead of green.  Green gives me indigestion when cooked. and yes, thick bone-in chops are better, they do not dry out like the boneless ones do.

This was very good! I made some slight tweaks such as seasoning the mushrooms with salt & pepper. And also seasoning the pork chops with salt & pepper before frying. I didn't add any water. I just doubled the diced tomatoes instead. I topped it with shredded mozzarella and served the pork chops on a bed a mashed potatoes! YUM! This reminded me of an Italian style pork stew. I will definitely be making this again! A keeper for sure! Thanks Lutzflcat!

Great pork dish. We had a bad storm and lost our Internet so I had to cook these without the instructions. I remembered to cook the mushrooms and set aside. But I cooked the onions, added in the chops, browned on each side just couple minutes and then added in the tomatoes. My chops only took 30 minutes to reach  150° internal temperature simmering on low. I topped with two colors of bell peppers the last fifteen min. Tossed the mushrooms back in while the pasta was cooking and just let the dish set covered off the heat until the pasta was ready. The sauce was fantastic tasting, and the pork loins were tender and juicy, a terrific combination of flavors.  I did marinate my pork loins all day in Italian dressing and herbs.

I really enjoyed this, it was packed with flavor. After getting it all back in the French oven I covered it and placed it in the oven at 325 for 45 minutes. My chops were about 1 inch thick and were tender and juicy! I used fresh basil and no bell pepper, it was delicious!

We followed the recipe as is and even left out the mushrooms and bell pepper (last minute meal!).....it was delicous!  I used two butterfly pork chops that we were looking to do something with and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  Served it with buttered linguine tossed with parmasan and green beans.....so easy!

This was pretty good.  I used boneless loin chops - they seemed a little dry and that is my only disappointment.  Otherwise a nice recipe.

We are not very big on pork, but I had some pork chops left and I decided to try this out. As expected, we didn't enjoy the pork, it had a weird, bland taste and it was chewy. However, the vegetables and sauce were excellent! I doubled the mushrooms and the garlic as we love these a lot. I will definitely retry this recipe, but with chicken breasts and I bet it would turn out amazingly!

4.5 Stars: I had to leave out the mushrooms and sliced bell peppers for the family.  I did add some dehydrated bell pepper to the tomato mixture.  I made it ahead and added some water when it was time to add to pork loin chops.  We served it over angel hair pasta and I thought it was restaurant quality.  I'm not sure what's keeping me from giving it the full 5 stars, perhaps my revisions.

Great recipe 1) bone-in loin chops, 2) salt/pepper when browniing, and 3) add crushed red pepper at the end.

These are delicious!  My husband made them because I wasn't going to be home in time.  He did them on the grill and they were great!  I don't know the details of how.  He used all the ingredients called for in the recipe, but did all the cooking on the grill.  4.5 stars for me!  We ate them over a bed of spaghetti noodles.  DELICIOUS!

Loved it! My family did too. The sauce is really nice, and a green vegetable like peas or beans is a great side dish. :)

Flavor is good, but pork chops were dry. I recommend watching the meat closely -- I had very thick cut pork chops and stuck to the time on the recipe -- the pork was overcooked.

I love this recipe. It was easy to make. I was able to prepare and relax while it cooked. I used this on loin lamp chops. It was yummy. I omitted the Green Pepper because I did not have one in my refrigerator like I thought I had.

I have been making a similar recipe for years.  Mine did not include the mushroons and bell peppers.  I serve this over yellow rice.    So very good!  Will add mushroons next time I make.   Not a fan of bell peppers.

Great easy recipe especially for me, who really has never cooked before. I marinated the pork chops in zesty Italian dressing for 6 hours before making the dish which added an additional kick to the flavor.  Will definitely be making this again.

I used two(2) cans of the diced tomatoes.  Think the time for cooking is too long for boneless pork chops.  Next time I'll will use a shorter time for cooking.  Was very good.  Also prepared my sauce the day before.

I loved this very much. I am not a big fan of salt so that is the only component I might cut down on or eliminate. Excellent Recipe. Tomatoes and mushrooms gave so much flavor.

My daughter and I are using Skinny Fiber and in turn are looking for very new healthy recipes. This was amazing I did change it up a bit though! I sauteed all my vegis (mushrooms, orange and yellow peppers and onions) together in a squares of real butter instead of olive oil. Then Put them in a covered bowl while I cooked the chops.Once the Chops were no longer pink on the outside I covered them with the vegi mix and simmered for about 10 more minutes. I did add all the spices as it called for. I also added the tomato's but I used a 28Oz can of stewed soaked in Basil and added all the juice. Once complete I served it over the top of white rice and used the juice for a gravy it was AMAZING!

I changed this up like everyone else, using more mushrooms, no green pepper, and chicken breasts (thought I had pork but didn't). The sauce instructions and measurements are spot on and produced a very tasty sauce.  My chicken breasts were on the smaller side and 40 minutes was too long (my fault).  I served on spinach and chive noodles.  Fantastic base and very easy to customize to your family's taste.

This was fantastic.  I normally dislike pork chops as they are always dry and nasty tasting.  These were moist and delicious. We bought "fresh" Center Cut from the meat counter at the grocery store.  I substitued the green bell pepper for a red pepper (sweeter).  I made some mushroom Risotto and some brussel sprouts - my husband was really impressed and wants it again.  This recipe is most certainly one that we will have again and again!

Would not reccomend this recipe if you are used to "real Italian"cooking. It was totally bland and tasteless. My husband asked ..."what part of Italy is this recipe from? Certainly not where your people are from.".............

I was looking for a flavorful way to prepare pork chops and this is it.  The pork chops were so tender and the sauce was great over noodles.  My whole family loved this recipe even my eight year old son who doesn't like much. This recipe is a keeper.

Very yummy, I will definitely make again.  I took the advice of others and seasoned the pork chops before searing (garlic powder, onion powder, fresh ground black pepper, a little seasoned salt, and a little paprika).  They would be very bland had I not followed this recommendation.  Also, I only simmered them for about 20-25 minutes, which was perfect.  45 minutes would have ruined them.  I used thick, bone in chops; I do not recommend making this with boneless, I think they would dry out.  I added 1/4 cup of dry red wine (instead of water) with the tomatoes before waiting to see if it would dry out.  I definitely recommend adding wine, it gave it a great flavor.  There was a lot of sauce leftover, and I think it would be good over some pasta.

I followed the recipe except I added some black olives we had to use up. Although the sauce was really delicious, the pork chops came out very dry. I used bone in chops since I find they usually have more flavor. Not this time. I may try this again, but will use boneless chops, and probably pierce the meat so the sauce can permeate the meat. I might even try cutting up the meat before browning it and let it simmer in the sauce. Am still on the hunt for s really good pork chop recipe.

I followed the recipe to a "T" but found that it was bland. I added more spices like 1 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary,1 tbsp chopped fresh thyme as well as increased the basil 1 tbsp and oregano 1 tbsp. After I did this my family can't wait until I make it again!It's a 5 star recipe now!!!

When I came upon recipe I found it quite interesting and a different way of doing pork chops. I found the suggestions of other reviewers to use white wine very helpful. And I used asparagus instead of green bell peppers and substituted beef stock instead of water and the end result was amazing !!!! Oh yes I also seasoned the pork chops with seasoned salt and my husband loved it ! So did I . Thanks again for the recipe I will be including it to my rotation of menus

I really liked this recipe but I did make a few changes and it was awesome. I substituted black olives (cut into halves) instead of the bell peppers. Then I added a little white cooking wine that gave it that bit. Loved it

This was delicious. Next time I will make it on a weekend so the chops can slowly cook until they are fall apart tender. I'm going to get cravings for this, I can tell.

I made this for my fiancé and I and it was amazing. I did use bone in *they came out very tender*. The last five minutes I placed the bell pepper strips and mushrooms on top to steam and heat up. The pork was fall off the bone. Served with a side of spaghetti and sprinkled parmesan cheese. Definitely will be making this again soon!

Absolutely delicious, moist and flavorful. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used three chops, and basically about the same amount with the rest of the ingredients (i didn't actually measure anything) and just used salt and pepper and italian seasoning, and some red pepper flakes for some heat. I put salt and pepper on the chops before browning and I cooked my peppers with my onion and garlic. And I added 1/4 of the tomato can of water to let it simmer. The chops were so moist and better than the slow cooker recipe my father in law gave me which has similar ingredients. It pleased everyone from my husband to my 19 month old daughter. Definitely a keeper!

This was awesome. Made as per recipe and the whole family, teens and 4 year olds all liked it. You won't need the water, I had lots of sauce without it. I am going to try it next time using a pork loin roast and doing it in the oven. Wife thought it looked like something from a restaurant.

I tried to add a photo because it was just beautiful, but I guess it didn't fit the AllRecipes requirements.  This dish just as written is perfect.  I used Italian stewed tomatoes with boneless chops and it turned out tender and tasty.  I made some roasted potatoes, carrots and asparagus to go with it.  Yum.  A keeper.

Good recipe but we always use pork blade chops because the loin usually dry up quickly (even with bone in).    Just because of our tastes add sliced black Olives and lots of fresh parmesan on top. Certainly a recipe to add to the file so thank you so much

This meal had me shouting, MOMMa Mia! IT WAS DELICIOUS! Because it was late and I wanted to cut down the total cooking time, I baked the chops which were marinating in Worcestershire sauce in the oven at 375 degrees in an oiled pan until they were slightly browned about 20 minutes while I sauteed the mushrooms and cut up the onion, bell pepper, and garlic, simultaneously making some wild rice in a vegetable broth from left over homemade soup. Then I followed the recipe with veggies and seasonings after placing the two chops back into the pan from the oven for additional browning, and then simmering all with lid on for maybe another 15 minutes. At the end I added the black olives suggested by another member and simmered an additional 5 minutes. THIS recipe over the flavored wild rice was the BOMBDIGGITY!!!

Loved this! I would recommend it to anyone. I used pork steaks. They weren't dried out at all. Nice and juicy. I had the lid off almost the whole time, too much liquid (my fault). I also served with Orzo. I will be making this all the time now.

This recipe was so flavorful, but the chops dried out in spite of the initial browning. When I make them next time I will get very thick chops and leave them a bit frozen and see if that helps. Otherwise, a truly good dish that my husband and I both really liked.

Pretty good. I ended up putting it in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes (1/2 time covered) because my stove pan is too small. I kept the spice amounts the same, cut back a bit on the onion and pepper.

This recipe is GREAT just the way it is.
It's very simple, not time consuming at all, and very...VERY delicious.
I've read most of the comments on how it was changed.  Not needed!  The only 'change' I've ever made to it was to add an extra can of the tomatoes...but that's really not a change; just a preference of how much sauce you'd like.  Oh, and I cut my bell pepper into 10-12pcs.  
Cooking time is perfect if you like a FORK tender chops - no knife needed.  You're not going to over-cook the chop if you let it simmer (a true simmer).  It just sits there and gets even more tenderized.  
All the flavor is there.  This is great over garlic mashed potatoes or your favorite pasta.  Currently, my favorite pasta is Fusilli col Buco 101.

Wonderful blend of flavors and easy to fix. I changed the servings to two since we are now empty nesters. I made two slight modifications: rubbed Italian seasoning on the chops before browing and used a small can of tomatoes and green chiles since I had it on hand and my husband loves spicy food. Like other reviewers, I reduced the simmering time to 20 minutes and the chops were very moist. (I did not need to add any water.) Next time I may cook the green peppers with the mushrooms and set aside--or add them earlier in the simmering process so they aren't quite as crunchy.  This one is a keeper tastewise and it looks beautiful on the plate. Nice enoug for company.

This was delicious and my children liked it alot too.  I used thinner bone in pork chops so that it would cook quicker and served it over mashed potatoes.

I had boneless porkchops, so I did not simmer 45min. 15 minutes did the trick. I also seasoned the chops before cooking them, after reading some of the reviews. I served this with mashed potatoes, but I think it is very versatile and quinoa, egg noodles, or rice would be good too. I will definitely  be cooking this again!

Full of flavor.  Be very careful about cooking time.  45 minutes is WAY too long.  I did add the peppers at the end and they cooked nicely and were still somewhat crisp...just perfect.

Did not change ingredients or change how to prepare everything — except after browning chops and making sauce, I put everything in the crockpot for about 3 1/2 hours.  Excellent taste - will make again.  Next time will use bone in chops and not loin, if I did not put in crock pot, chops would have been dry.

This was a nice change from the traditional fried pork chop.  I had some left over spaghetti sauce so I substituted it for the diced tomatoes.  I kept an eye out for the doneness of the chops and only cooked them with the sauce for about 15 minutes until they reached 145 temp, then turned off heat and let them simmer more in the sauce.

Loved this recipe! It was super easy & really yummy. I used thick bone in pork chops that I seared first so they stayed nice and moist white cooking in the tomato’s. I also used red pepper instead of green - personal preference. Really good - will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe fairly closely.  I used 2 thick salt and peppered pork chops, diced the pepper and cooked that with the mushrooms and added some red pepper flakes for a little spice.  It was a good dish!  I also seared the chops 2 minutes on each side then they only simmered about 20 minutes.

Not a bad recipe- the pork was slightly over done, but not inedible. Instead of simmering for 45 minutes I would try 30. Also ( in one Italian family’s opinion) we all felt there was too much oregano - will try 1/4 tsp next time as well as adding a little more garlic.  And don’t forget to garnish with some fresh basil leaves!!

Excellent, easy, colorful! I used multi color peppers and added a few slices black olives.  Anything this pretty has to taste good.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was very good and the sauce prevented the chops from being dry.  I added a can of tomato sauce and served it on linguine.  Delicious.

I jus made this recipe tonight for my family and it was a big hit.. I followed the directions all except the simmering time.. instead of 45 I did 25.. n then added the peppers and mushrooms for 10 extra minutes.. so all together i let the chops simmer for 35 minutes.. I also used the bone-in chops because after reading the reviews it seemed to be the better choice.. plus it was already n my freezer.. lol.. oh and I used some red wine to make sure nothing dried out..I finished it off with some basil pesto pasta, green beans yellow beans and carrots... the meat was so tender and juicy.. n the pasta tasted even better once it was glazed over with the sauce.. definitely looking forward to making this again..

Good way to use up what I had - mushrooms, red pepper instead of green, red onion. I wouldn't cook the pork chops quite as long next time - will vary depending on thickness. Very tasty and easy to make.

This was so yummy. Doubled the sauce and served over some egg noodles. Everyone ate very well. The reason for the 4 stars not 5 is the pork chops. The sauce was outstanding but the chops lacked flavor and were very plain. Next time I’ll prepare them separate from the sauce and either bread them up or grill. Or possibly follow other review and marinate them in Italian dressing first

Exactly what I was in the mood for yesterday.  That was a good tip with the peppers.  I always cook them with the onions, and they do get mushy.  This was super simple with a lot of flavor.  I will be putting this into my rotation.  The only thing I changed was the portion size, so I had to "eye" things.  Theres only two of us, and we dont have very huge appetites.  I made mashed potatoes to go with this and fresh broccoli.  I'm so rigid about serving a green veg no matter what I make.  But my son wolfed it down.  Thanks.  Enjoyed this very much.  Great rainy/snowy day meal.

I used a small pack of frozen veggies and grilled them brown at the end, so as to not over cook.  Also used a T of Worcester on pork as they simmered.

Made this last night and it was GREAT!  I used bone in pork chops and cooked them in a cast iron pan.  Besides the ingredients listed I also added 2 cubes of chicken broth; 1/2 cup water and a cup of wine.  I thinly sliced a 1/2 red and green pepper which I cooked after the onions browned.  I covered and cooked the pork chops for about 2 hours on low in the cast iron pan.  I would make this again!

Changed up the order of operations a little, and cut down the wet heat coooking time by about half. Left the heat a little higher after adding the chops and tomatoes back in, cooked at medium to medium high for about 22 minutes. Still had a 180 degree center temp, but NO issues with drying. Chops were juicy and thoroughly done. Served with my go to fettuccine with sweet pepper and cayenne sauce (https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17702/fettuccine-with-sweet-pepper-cayenne-sauce/), and a side  of tabbouleh. Definitely will do this again.

Very good flavor, and my boneless pork loin chops were tender and moist.  But the resulting liquid is more like a broth than a sauce, needs thickening  in my opinion.  Otherwise, a nice dish that is quick and easy to fix.

Didn't brown well enough,  but still turned out delicious.  I'd use a like more seasoning next time,  and put some garlic in towards the end so it doesn't get washed out.

Like many others I found the sauce lovely and colorful, but the chop a bit bland.  And I did salt and pepper my chops. I used bone in thick chops, only two and the amount of sauce was about right so consider doubing the sauce if you make more.  The cooking time was spot on for the bone in variety such a I used.  I just wish I knew how to season the chop to make it more worthy of the sauce.

I made this the other night for my family.  It was awsome.  Cooking porkchops has always been a challenge for me, but this recipe made the porkchops so tender.  The only thing I did different is serve it on a bed of jasmine rice...I am trying to cut down on my pasta consumption.   (I used porkchop [5x] without the bone,  and the chops were very tender, not sure why others got dry chops).   It was very good, thank you!  I will definitely make this again.

We loved this recipe.  I did find that the pork chops were fully cooked about  20 minutes after I added them to the simmering sauce.  I only used 2 rather large boneless loin chops and the amount of sauce was produced was enough for 2.  I would consider adding more tomatoes if I were using more meat.  I served them with some mushroom cheese raviolis.  I am going to try this recipe with chicken next time.

I ended up having to use a pan with out a lid so for the simmering, I covered the pan with aluminum foil and some steam did leak.  I am attributing this to why the chops were so tough and dry.  I did not need to add additional water as suggested.  I am not a big fan of 3/4" chops as, unless I bake them in gravy or soup, they always are a challenge with being dry.  Flavor-wise...this is a great recipe.

I made this at least three times and it just gets better. My husband loves this. When I tell my Sister I’m making this she comes for dinner.

I made these in my instant pot - I rubbed the oregano, basil, salt, and pepper on my pork chops, sautéed in oil for about 3 minutes. Added the onion, garlic and tomatoes sautéed another minute. Cooked on high pressure for 30 minutes (thick pork chops). Quick release on the pressure and added the bell peppers and mushrooms for 2 minutes on high. One word...Amazing!

This was quite good, but it didn't "wow" me enough to give it 5 stars. I halved the ingredients for 2 chops, and omitted the mushrooms. I also took some other reviewers' advice and cut the simmering time back to 30 min.  so they remained juicy.

My husband and I really liked this.  He said it was one that we could serve to company.  I served it over rice.  The only thing I changed was the cooking time, since my chops were thinner.  Excellent!

I made this last night. I used a larger can of tomatoes and it had italian seasonsings already.  I also pre prepped my pork chops with a dash of hot seasonings, just to give it a small kick. It was hubby approved!

Made the recipe as is .......loved it!   Used boneless chops and simmered very low for 30 minutes.  Sauce is excellent and so I’m using the sauce recipe again with sweet Italian sausages to see how they turn out.

I made this recipe because I saw it featured in the Allrecipes Greatest Hits.  I am always looking for grain-free recipes without sugar, and this recipe filled the bill!  It was delicious with red bell pepper, but multi-colored would probably be a good idea, too.  The chops were tender and juicy, and the Italian-inspired sauce was a nice change for a weeknight pork chop.  Besides the red pepper instead of green, I kept the skillet uncovered after adding the mushrooms, to reduce the sauce a bit.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks, lutzflcat!

Before searing the pork chops, I seasoned them with some salt and pepper. I have got some leftover sauce, it can be used with some pasta. Some red pepper flakes would add more flavour. It is easy to prepare and filling.

Seasoned and seared the pork. Placed them in slow cooker for 3 1/2 hours on high with fire roasted tomatoes that I drained and added a slash of red wine, garlic, and Italian seasoning. Easy taster meal! I'm sure it would be even bettered simmered. Sauter my veggies separetly so they didn't turn to mush in the slow cooker.

This was surprisingly light.   I  did use bone-in chops and seasoned  them before browning as others suggested.   A word of caution, whatever chops you use, keep a close eye on them while cooking.  Cook only until the chops are not pink in the middle.  Longer results in a dry product.  The sauce was very flavorful but a bit thin to use over pasta.  Next time I  will thicken it slightly.  We liked this and will be making it again.

This was Great. I followed the receipt as instructed however I substituted the water for white wine and used multicolored peppers. Also I did season the Chops with salt and pepper before browning them, as suggested by one of the reviews. I will definitely make this again.  Lady D

I thought it was a little dry but I should have checked it after 30 minutes.  I also used bone-in chops.
Sauce was delicious - I used crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes (28oz each) and increased seasonings.

I did not add any water and it came out great.  I did add 1 cup of cherry tomatoes.  You did not need a knife to eat as you can cut the meat with a fork.  It was very flavorful.

We used boneless so we had to alter cooking time accordingly or else the chops would have overcooked. It was very good! We plan to try the same recipe but use tenderloin tips next time.

I made this from the recipe in the AllRecipes magazine. There are slight differences in the ingredients.  I made it just as written in the magazine.  This was very good and I will make it again.  I had a large red bell pepper which might have been a bit too much.  Next time I'd use a bit less  bell pepper.  My husband liked it too.  I will keep this recipe and make again.  Thanks

I made a few changes:  We love mushrooms, so I used 2 pounds of sliced mushrooms. I had three large fresh tomatoes that I chopped up and added to the sautéed sliced  onions and sliced bell peppers.   I had thick boneless pork chops, so after I browned them in a different frying pan, I baked them in 1/4 to 1/2 cup red wine in a preheated 350 degree oven for 20 minutes to make sure they were cooked and then I added them into the simmering tomato, bell pepper, onion mixture with the mushrooms for another 10 minutes and covered the pan. I served the pork chops and the vegetables over fettuccini noodles. Yum!

I made according to the recipe this time with the exception o seasoning the pork chops before browning.  You always have to season your meat.  Next time I will change it up a bit and add other vegetables to the mix.  I really did enjoy this version very much thank you for this easy week night meal.

Amazing!! Definitely a keeper! Used a red bell pepper instead of green and added a few more cloves of garlic (or family loves garlic). Otherwise, made per recipe and everyone devoured it. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Really enjoyed the recipe after a few chances. I did season the pork chops with salt. & pepper.  We don't like mushrooms so I didn't add those. I also cut red and green peppers into strips  along with onions. A little extra garlic to give it that zip helped to.  Served with yellow rice it all came together for a nice flavor

After reading the comments, I was worried about the pork chops drying out, so I got big thick bone-in chops at the warehouse store. There were 10 in the pack so I cooked 5 and froze the rest. I marinated them for a few hours in Italian dressing and sprinkled them with some Montreal Steak seasoning prior to browning. I only browned them for a couple of minutes on each side as they cook just fine in the sauce. I doubled the sauce recipe and that was a bit more than was needed but it covered the chops nicely and it all fit in the 12" pan just fine. I found that the bell peppers required about 15 minutes to soften up to the right consistency.  I served it on a bed of rice and my wife and our guests loved it  (me too).

I made this recipe as it was in the magazine of Allrecipes.  But this  recipe differs a little bit in the magazine. The magazine version is made with red peppers, a can of regular diced tomatoes and no water is added. Maybe had I used the online recipe I would have enjoyed this recipe more. I found it very bland... Chops were nice and tender but like I said, the sauce is very bland.

This recipe was amazing! I definitely added in two cans of tomatoes to have enough sauce to put over pasta. And I only cooked my pork chops for half the time, they would have been really dried out otherwise. The family loved this!

I made the recipes with 2 thick (1")  boneless pork chops, but made the full serving of the sauce.  I did have to add more water than I expected during the simmering process.  I used tomatoes with basil & oregano in them and added the spices noted in the recipe.  My husband doesn't like mushrooms so I omitted them.    The pork chops were very tasty and juicy.  If you are using a thinner pork chop then the cooking time would need to be reduced to keep them from drying out.  The recipe is very easy to follow.

I loved this! I cooked the pork chops (with bone) with some red wine, and added salt/pepper. I 
added red wine to the "sauce" as well! Absolutely amazing dish. I also simmered the pork chops with the sauce for 35 minutes instead of 45. Very juicy and tender. The sauce is great with thin spaghetti as well ;)

Great recipe!  I used a shallot instead of the onion, doubled the garlic, and used a jar of chunky Italian pasta sauce.  The chops were fully cooked in about 20 minutes.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is quick and easy! The only change I made was adding 1 small can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. We really enjoyed the flavour of this dish and will definitely make it again. I may try it with chicken next time.

I followed this recipe except I put Italian seasoning on the chops before cooking them.  I used a can & a half of diced tomatoes instead of adding water & I only simmered for 30 mins after reading suggestions from others.  It was very good. My chops did not dry out.  My whole family enjoyed it. I will make again.

This was awesome!  Only thing I did different was cook the chops on the grill, 5 minutes each side then added to sauce.  Meat easily pealed off the bone.  I'll be doing this again, especially the way my wife was looking at me during the meal.

I didn't have mushrooms or Italian tomato's so I skipped the mushrooms and used regular chopped tomato's and it delicious.  Our mouths  water just thinking about the night we ate it.  We will use this  quite often from now on.  Definitely buying Italian tomatos and mushrooms to make it correctly next time.

I really enjoyed these. They didn't take as long to cook as the recipe said, but it's because I used bone in pork chops that were a little on the thin side. Once I placed the chops back in the sauce they only had to cook about 20 minutes. Also after reading several reviews about the taste of these, I seasoned both sides of the chops with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper when browning them. They were very tasty.

I made it almost as the recipe stated except I cooked the chops more quickly. I didn't take them out after browning them, but instead added the onion, garlic, and other seasoning in after flipping them at 5-7 minutes. Then I added the tomatoes and let it simmer 15 minutes, then the mushrooms and peppers just to soften them a very little bit. It was SO flavorful! And I had read from others that the pork was bland so I seasoned them a little before cooking them with oregano and garlic.

Please read the reviews! This is a fairly easy recipe but things to be aware of: (1) season chops with salt and/or pepper when browning to avoid blandness, (2) the 'browning' step is mostly for color. The chops should not be 'cooked' at this point. Keep chops covered during cooking to retain moisture. (3) Keep chops covered during simmering to retain moisture and adjust simmering time based on how well the chops have been cooked thus far otherwise they'll come out dry.

At step 2, I sautéed the onions, red and orange peppers until soft. I added the garlic, diced fresh tomatoes, and the mushrooms back in. I then put the park chops back in for just a couple minutes (45 minutes and your pork chops would be waaaay overdone). I served over zucchini zoodles and the whole family enjoyed it.

Very good - we made a few minor changes based on suggestions  from others.  Seasoned the center cut pork chops before browning with garlic powder, sea salt and pepper.  Uses 2 c onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Instead of 14 oz  tomatoes, I used  large can of crushed tomatoes. As someone else said we simmered with chops  for 15 minutes.  Lastly to spice things up we added some crushed pepper. Put over spaghetti it was awesome! Real hit!

I used poblano peppers instead of green peppers and the flavor was really good.  But, I cooked it too long, and it got dry.  I will make it again, but not cook too long.  flavor of the onions, tomatoes, and poblano peppers went really well with the pork chop.

This recipe lacked flavor. Yes, to the salt and pepper and a lot of it to bring out some flavor to the chops.

Followed the recipe and the author's advice and didn't add the green peppers until close to the end.  My family gobbled this up - was so delicious!  I used thick cut, bone-in pork chops and they were the most tender chops I have ever made.  Will definitely make this again soon!

Loved this flavor!  I did season the chops before searing and I only seated for approx 3 minutes each side and then braised for approx 15 minutes. Delicious!  I will definitely be making this again and I am thinking of trying with chicken as well.

It is good, however we would rather just have the flavor of a plain pork chop.

This dish was really good. Recommend cooking as directed but leave the pork chops out and grill them (couldn't really taste the chops in this dish). The veggies with pasta would me the perfect side to grilled chops!

I used three bone in chops with all the same ingredients. I didn't bother  with sauteing the mushroom just throw it in the skillet towards the last ten minutes. Served it over angel hair pasta. It's not amazingly good, but easy, tasty and relatively healthy. Will definitely make it again.

GOOD  We enjoyed. I followed recipe totally with my own cooking knowledge.  Used bone in chops.  Used diced tomatoes,  no water, added peppers earlier than 5 minutes. Also added some red pepper fkakes for extra flavor.
Cooking time varies for everyone. Pork chop size, pan  size,
liquid amount, simmering temperature. Just watch , be attentive and don't dry out pork.

This was such a delicious meal that was very satisfying and would be great for company!  I pretty much went by the recipe but flip flopped the directions.  I browned the pork first, set aside, and then sauteed all the veggies together.  Added everything back in together and simmered only for another 15 minutes and not the whole 45 minutes it says too.  I wouldn't simmer it for that long unless you have really thick chops.    Also instead of water, I used a splash of white wine.  Other than that, everything else was the same and it came out with amazing flavor!  The sauce and veggies were so flavorful and delicious!  I served a nice pasta on the side that I thought complimented it very well, Fettuccine with Sweet Pepper Cayenne Sauce here on Allrecipes.  I also served with a salad to make a great meal.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!  I will make again!

Very easy to make.  Served with angel hair pasta.  I think next time I will add some tomato paste so it will be a bit thicker - I had to serve it in bowls which made it hard to cut the chops.

Was a hit in this household .. Changes, chicken broth instead of water, yellow and red bell peppers rather than the green and I browned the pork chops first then the mushrooms,  deglazing the pan with the chicken broth 
Served with linguine noodles and a creamy cucumber salad

We all loved this recipe. But after I browned the chops and removed them from the skillet, to save steps I added the rest of ingredients to the pan then placed chops back into the pan. To add more liquid if needed I add chicken broth. Make sure to add salt and pepper. Salt brings out the favor in your food. Don't over do it because pork is already salty. We like to create sauce, not much just enough to drizzle over the noodles. It quick and easy. I don't use just green peppers I also add yellow or orange to add color. Enjoy.

Made almost as written except used bone in chops as others have advised to keep the pork moist.  It was mouth watering and will definitely be made again.  I made double this time around and froze half for a quick and delicious meal in future.

The ingredients mix together for perfect flavor!  I did add an extra can of tomatoes.  Next time, I will do the prep on the stove and then put in the slow cooker.  The pork chops were not very tender because my gas stove basically has 2 temperatures, high and medium high.  It does not simmer.

Definitely a go to recipe for us now! I was looking for something else to do with a pork chop and this is it. Thank you Barb for recommending to use a bone-in chop. It did have more flavor. We noticed that the tenderloin portion was the best tasting and will most likely use  a slice of tenderloin next time.

Made 2x the sauce for just 2 chops/added colored peppers/more garlic.  Don't exceed 1/2 to 3/4 in. chops; found 1 in. chop to be dry.  Needed some red wine & beef broth for moisture.  Will make again; good one to experiment with!

I will definitely make this again! My husband and I devoured it! I used bone-in pork chops. I made the recipe as stated except I recommend using a thermometer to determine when they're done instead of setting a timer. My chops only took an additional 15 min or so in the pan and they were done. Would have been way over done and dry had I relied on the timer.

I did salt & pepper the chops prior to browning them.  I deglazed pan with 4 tablespoons red wine, after onions and garlic.  I served it on top of Orzo with basil pesto.  The cooking time on simmer for 2 boneless chops was 25 minutes and they were juicy and tender.  Love this recipe.

I followed the recipe, except that I did not drain the pan of drippings before I threw in the onions and garlic.  Everyone raved over this fantastic recipe!

Followed other reviewers advice. Added the salt and pepper to the chops as the browned. I also doubled all the spices just because that is how we like it. I only cooked it for 35 minutes. The only thing I would change is either adding the peppers (did tri color peppers) 15 min before the end of cooking time or sauteing them separately. Otherwise this is a pretty easy recipe to modify to your tastes.

Good recipe.  I simmered for only 20 minutes and chops were still tender.  I cut the recipe in half as well and diced my own tomatoes rather than using canned.

I will make it again but..
cooking time is far , far too long
I browned the chops in the pan 5 Min each side and then simmered them for 15 min each side (total of 30 min) and they came out tender,  I prepared the bell pepper separately and added them in the last minute

So tender and delicious!!  There is nothing I would change about this recipe...it's  very tasty and the best way to eat pork chops that do not need a steak knife. 
P.S. I used the bone-in pork chops to insure that they were tender.

I'm not saying this is a bad recipe, but the chops never really got tender enough to fork-cut, which I would expect with a simmered acid sauce. I left them for an hour on a slow, easy simmer, lots of juice. Maybe just a bad cut of meat.

These chops were very good and super easy to prepare. I'm surprised that some people need to have salt and pepper listed on a recipe in order to use it, anyone who cooks on a daily basis knows to salt and pepper to taste or according to your own dietary needs!  No need to give a recipe 3 stars because you can't figure out whether or not to use salt.....!

So delicious. Unlike others, my pork didn't dry out even though I used boneless. I did use pork loin chops, which have a bit more fat, so that probably helped. I made the whole process a bit quicker by searing the pork on high heat, removing it to bake for a few minutes in the oven while I sauteed all the sliced veggies at once, then added the tomatoes and pork back into the skillet to simmer for about 10 more minutes. I did season the pork with s&p before searing, and I seasoned the veggies as they were sauteing. I added the Italian herbs when I added the tomatoes. The searing also helps hold in the juices. This one's going in my Favorites folder.

What I did to minimize drying out the chops was to cook them throughly. Then just warm up the tomato sauce. Plus I added a little puertorican flavor to the cops. It was a huge hit!

Delicious and quintessential Italian. I only had four chops, but still used the full amounts of veg and sauce. Glad I did, those peppers/mushrooms etc. were lovely and glad I had a lot. I did feel the need to increase the seasonings. Chicken or fish could be substituted for the pork.  Unfortunately my chops were quite thin, even though bone-in they only needed a few minutes to cook, but it worked out very well. I'm very glad to have this recipe in my arsenal.

I made this without mushrooms because I didn't have any. I also had to substitute the bell peppers for some orange, yellow and red ones I already had. The dish was delicious. I will be making this again and trying it the way it was intended.

We made this using bone-in chops with a side of roasted potato wedges. Would've been great with rice as well. Best pork chops I've ever had. Tasted even better re-heated a couple days later.

I didn't have fresh mushrooms on hand, so substituted canned.  I added the liquid from the canned mushrooms instead of the extra water after adding tomatoes.  Since my pan has a tightly fitted lid, this resulted in too much liquid in the sauce, so I had to boil off much of the liquid near the end of cooking to get the sauce to a desired consistency.  My boneless chops were plenty moist by cooking this way, though.  Will certainly make again, but will try to have fresh mushrooms on hand.

My family loved this recipe. I actually got two different meals from it. The left over sauce I made into homemade tomatoes soup. Big hit on both dishes. I just added 3 small cans of tomatoes paste, 4 cups of beef broth, 1/2 cup macaroni and I added small meatballs, pepper.

Made this recipe as is, except I did season the pork chops before browning as another reviewer said, and LOVED IT!  Served it with rice, and the whole family wanted more! Definitely a keeper as is! Super moist, lots of flavor.  One of our new family faves.

Great flavor.  Used bone-in chops, seasoned them with Greek seasoning before browning.  Also used twice the amount of tomatoes and cooked several hours at 200, for tender chops.  Served all over noodles. Yummy

Pork chops, in my experience,  are notoriously tasteless.  Growing up in polish culture it's common.  However, this recipe has restored the things I love about pork chops!!! Love it!!!!

I made these for supper last night. I had everything in my fridge and cupboards already which made it a simple quick dish. Great flavour, just remember to salt and pepper. I made asparagus as a side to keep it light and fresh without starch or carbs. I would cook this again.

Followed recipe but was bland. Added crushed red pepper flakes and a TB of balsamic vinegar. It was ok, but thinking crushed tomatoes and more oregano would be better.

This dish was amazing!  I followed other reviewers suggestion and used bone in chops but it came out so juicy and moist that I think boneless would have been fine.  I started with the mushrooms and followed Julia child's rule to not crowd them and made sure to sear them on either side first, put them aside and then browned the chops.  I put those aside as well, cooked the onions and added everything back to the pot to simmer.... It came out beautiful and smothered in all the good stuff and was even better when we finished up the leftovers.  My fiancé loved them so much he slurped the juice off both our plates!!

These were soooo delicious!  The recipe called for six - I had four (bone in pork chops) and did not reduce any of the ingredients.  I did follow a previous viewers advice and seasoned the chop during the initial browning.  I also added the 1/2 cup of water before placing the chops back in the pan for 45 mins.  They were almost covered.  My hubby loves his chops with apple sauce and had his eyebrow raised when he glimpsed at what I was doing - lol.  He LOVED them! I served with cauliflower mash and spinach salad.  This recipe is a KEEPER.  Thank You lutzflcat for posting.

My husband and I found this dish delicious. I made it by the recipe except used fresh herbs and served with mashed potatoes instead of pasta. I also adjusted the ingredients for 3 chops instead of 6, very easy to do.

Absolutely delicious!!!! Had ingredients in the fridge or cupboard.  Used 4 small bone in chops for my husband and myself.  It was so good my husband thanked me again in the morning, and gave me a big hug.  Husband then proceeded to discuss other meals we could make with this recipe.  Thank you!!!!

This was a great recipe for pork chops.  We really enjoyed it.  I added black beans and deglazed the pan after onions and garlic were cooked with a little red wine.  I used fresh herbs just because I had them on my front porch.  The great part of this recipe is how it can be tweeted depending on what's available in your kitchen. The core base is the most important part to follow to get moist, juicy pork chops.

If this had been cooked maybe a fraction of the time suggested, it would have had a better chance.  I'm sorry to say that I probably won't make it again.

This was Incredible!! I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of the Italian tomatoes. I also used extra thick boneless chops as well. They came out tender and juicy. Will definitely make again.

Very delicious! The pork chops were tender and juicy. However, I think that simmering them for 45 minutes might be too long, I did maybe half that and they were fully cooked.

Weren't the best pork chops we've ever had but we did enjoy them a lot. They take longer to make than most other dishes I normally make but it's a very healthy plate.

Made this with one little change....I put it tomato puree and added fresh tomato chunks. I did utilize the 1/2 cup of water too! It was absolutely amazing and so filling! We will be definitely having this again!

My italian bf loved this! Used twice the amount of tomatoes with sauce and served it over angel hair pasta.
