This review will use an odd analogy, but it perfectly describes my thoughts on this recipe. I read an article that compares a dog's sense of smell to a human's. It said that a human can smell spaghetti sauce; a dog can smell every  ingredient in the sauce. This dish reminded me of that comparison. The ingredients are so few and simple, so you can taste each individual flavour. One bite has more freshly ground black pepper than the last, the next bite has more onion, and so on. With each bite I was looking forward to the new combination of flavour. I was very pleasantly surprised! PS - I had to use dried thyme because my grocery store was all out of fresh.

4.5  Although I must confess I did tweak it just a little in the way of adding black olives as an afterthought.  Light, fresh and seasoned with Parmagiano - Reggiano that had been aged 24 months and fresh thyme.  Thanks for the recipe Barilla!

This was a great dish. We love a light tomato sauce, so this was a winning recipe for us. The red onion was even enjoyed by the non onion lovers of the family! I will add garlic next time to enhance the flavour a bit more, but I have to say, the Barilla farfalle cooks so well!

I think that this is a fantastic base recipe.  The tomato sauce was light and incredibly easy to make, and the flavours really complimented each other well.

Next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I would add some red chillis, garlic, and some cayenne (if I was feeling dangerous).  I would also add more cheese and some mushrooms.

This recipe has so much potential - take it wherever you want to go.  Thank you, Barilla, for the delicious Sunday!

The flavours here were ok, and this was palatable, however as a whole it was just very uninspired. It would have been made better with garlic, or more herbs, or some sort of a meat. Or all of the above. I would be unlikely to make this again without major modifications.
