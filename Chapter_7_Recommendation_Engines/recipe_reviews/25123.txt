These were SO good.  I am not a big fan of white chocolate but thought I'd give them a try and  just loved them.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I needed 2 or 3 more mins. of baking time.  Could have been because it was an extremely humid day.  Save yourself some time and buy the already shelled  pistachios.  It took me 45 MINUTES to shell the cup and a half I needed.  I then determined that the shells weighed the same as the nuts so when it's all said and done, you aren't saving a great deal by buying the ones in shells.  I bought unsalted pistachios, I think next time I would buy the lightly salted ones, just to give them a bit more flavor.  Also, one pkg. of white chocolate chips didn't quite make 2 cups, more like 1-3/4 cups, but it tasted fine.  I used a small ice cream scoop and got exactly 7 dozen cookies.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 1 cup of shortening instead of 1 1/2, and 2 cups of white chocolate chips.  Using less shortening helped keep them more consistent, but unfortunately the chocolate was a little overpowering.  I would suggest only 1 cup (maybe 1 1/3 cup) of chips, and more nuts.  But overall very tasty!

These taste very good, but they do flatten considerably and can be somewhat difficult to get off the pan.  I think it has to do with too much butter and shortening . . .I think I'll go with 1 cup next time instead of a cup and a half.  The cookies are delicious, though!  Thanks for the recipe!

What a great cookie!  I was looking for something different for my Christmas baking, made a batch last night and of course had to sample a few with my neighbor.  They were great!  I really didn't mind that they thinned out a little, it just seemed to make them all the better!

i loved the cookies. they were just phenomenal the the salty-ness of the pistachios brought out the sweater side of the cookie. the brown sugar and the white sugar combination was just wonderful and it just brought the chewyness to the cookie. it was just a very delicious cookie!!

Good cookies. I reduced the sugar by 25%. These taste better the day after they are baked. Also, you should flatten them before baking; they barely spread at all. Dough freezes well too (I am baking a batch using premade, frozen and thawed dough).

The recipe AS IS : 3 starts
But I took some member's advice and halved both the butter and shortening (1/2 c & 1/4 C respectively), and the cookie came out amazing! So with the changes made, a 5 star recipe.
Definitely will make again....yum!

Overall a good recipe. Just needs about 1 cup of butter or shortening (not both, and not more than that!! Waaay too mushy then). Also, cooking time is more than 10 minutes. I needed about twice that just so they would firm up a bit. Other than that, a good recipe!

I really liked this cookie and so did the family! The only thing I changed was that I skipped the shortening (I accidentally omitted it and didn't realize until the end) and as a result the cooking time.  I bumped the temp up to 375 and baked for 13-14 minutes. They were cake-like and delish. No issues of flat cookies like the previous reviews stated. I will definately make again.

These are amazing.  Super buttery (as you can imagine reading that recipe).  I love that the wheat flour and rolled oats in it - gives it a nice texture.  The pistachio flavor doesn't really come out, however.  I might try this with macadamias.

Batter tasted great, cookies tasted great, but they came out super thin and couldn't hold their shape at all.

A great cookie, all around! I wasn't too sure about the whole wheat, but it really went well with all the other flavours and textures. The only thing about these cookies - they need to be watched at the very end as they will overbrown in a split second.

I have made this recipe many times because my partner loves these cookies. I just noticed that I have never added the 1/2 cup shortening (I don't know why). I have no reason to start adding it. Plus, I only put in 1 cup of white chocolate chips and this might even be too much. 2 cups is waaaay too much white chocolate.
