The molases makes it a little bitter (and not a pretty color). I'd just use white sugar if I made it again.

This wasn't bad for a healthier version of rice pudding. It looked kind of sad on the table next to the sugar & butter laden Easter cake, but people did actually eat some. It has a strong resemblance (appearance-wise) to oatmeal. I love sweet, but I thought the 1/3 c. of Splenda for baking was a bit too much- as the recipe says though, to taste. I left the leftovers with a diabetic family member. I wanted to like this more, but alas, I will stick with my sugary junk.
