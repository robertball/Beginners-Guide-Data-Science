I made these exactly as written other than reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp because my salt is very fine, not coarse. They turned out great! I put some Canadian bacon and cheese on them to make healthier breakfast sandwiches than running for fast food. 

To the reviewers who deviate from the recipe and then rate the recipe poorly...stop doing that. The recipe works if you follow it. You cannot replace almond flour with coconut flour one for one and expect it to turn out. You cannot remove the honey from the recipe and then be surprised when the biscuits are salty; there's no sweet to balance the salty. If you didn't make the recipe as written, you can't leave a bad review. tl That's entirely unfair to the author, and it makes it hard for the rest of us to find accurately rated recipes.

Seriously so amazing! I've pressed one batch of dough down into a 9X13 pan, baked for 5 minutes, layered cooked ham, eggs, cheese, and a second batch of dough on top and baked for another 15 minutes. Then I cut it into 12 squares and individually wrapped them and refrigerated. My husband is a soldier who doesn't often have the time for a fast AND nutritious breakfast so if I do these on Sundays he has an easy, "manly" breakfast to heat up and go. Really great biscuit recipe!

Perfect. Made as written.  The house smelled wonderfully fragrant while baking.  Update:  This is my go-to recipe now.  It's easy, uses few ingredients, and leaves me with biscuits that I can freeze and pull out as needed.  I don't press down prior to baking anymore.  I leave them in a small heap and have a fluffier biscuit that way.  Going to try adding shredded cheddar for a cheesy biscuit.

I did half almond four and half coconut flour, but otherwise made it as is. Easy and delicious!! This was my first attempt at biscuits since learning I am allergic to wheat and dairy, and I admit I had low expectations, but these were genuinely amazing.

My husband was very impressed with these. The first time I made them I used avocado oil, only because I didn't want to melt and cool coconut oil. The second time, I went ahead and made as directed with coconut oil. They were very good with avocado oil but even better with coconut oil. I won't go back now!

I loved this so much. I made them exactly as described. I even grilled them and served it with a perfectly fried medium egg on top. I have to tell you, I was in heaven. They came out looking so "normal" and they sliced in half beautifully.  The browning on the surface gave them eye appeal. When I put that grilled egg on top with salt and pepper and the oozing egg center.... well.  I'll never be the same.  :) This recipe right here will be the reason I can eat Paleo for life. THANK YOU for posting it.

They are super yummy!! And so easy to make. I didn't have eggs that were room temp though (mine were in the fridge) and they still turned out fine

Pretty good!  Of course, they're never going to taste like "real" biscuits because they don't have gluten or wheat flour, but these are a great substitution.  I will reduce the salt by 1/4 tsp. next time.  Otherwise, we really enjoyed the recipe.  We liked the little bit of sweetness the honey gave the biscuits.  Ours rose slightly and could be easily split.  If you are new to working with almond flour, you don't want to overwork it or the oil will come out of the flour and make the recipe too oily.  I recommend beating the eggs and honey together before adding to the flour/baking soda/salt mixture -- then mix it in until just combined.  To those who are trying to substitute coconut flour for almond flour -- it's not going to work without making other alterations to the recipe.  Coconut flour absorbs a lot more liquid than almond flour.  I can't wait to try some of the other suggestions -- adding Italian herbs and not flattening them for a more fluffy biscuit both sound like wonderful options.  Thanks for a great and versatile *paleo* recipe!

I made this recipe as is and everyone in my house loves it. In fact I shared it with my in-laws and they love it too. The biscuits have a great texture and a sweet and slightly nutty taste. Definitely put the coconut oil in before the eggs or you end up with a crumbly mess.

So easy and quick to make.  See my picture, if 12 biscuits are made, they are on the small side, 2.5" wide x 0.75" tall (enough to split them).  I prefer to make 8 biscuits from a 12 serving recipe.  Great with a spread of avocado and a fried egg for breakfast!   A touch of sweetness, can easily make a savory version too.

Excellent biscuit. I added cinnamon and some lemon zest to the flour mixture, then added blueberries. Addictive biscuit! ( I also replaced about 1/4 cup almond flour with coconut flour-just cuz.

I bet these would be good with a couple of over medium eggs on the top. I didn't have enough almond flour, so used about a cup of coconut flour and the rest almond flour.  One reviewer mentioned she didn't have room temp eggs.  I didn't either so I run warm water over them and that did the trick. Definitely a different taste, and probably about the best one will get if not using regular flour.  I was not able to cut them I half after the baking as they were too crumbly.  I like the fact that everything gets mixed in the same bowl. I will try these again. Might add some of the Italian herbs that were mentioned in another review.

I had a serious addiction to Bisquick drop biscuits most of my life, and was one of the things I never found a replacement for when I went gluten free several years ago. Now that I. Am refining my eating to Paleo, I have searched out recipes and I came across this one. I prepared it as a drop biscuit, and fell in love. Like swoonie, knee buckling love.
You wont regret making these.

I mistakenly made them the first time with almond meal (still worked), but came across blanched almond flour and tried again. In short, we like them! There is a prominent buttery taste, and the texture is very close to biscuits made with flour. I just made a batch with frozen blueberries (photo attached. They turned out delicious and did not need to adjust cook time or other ingredients). Other variations  I plan to try next: brushing the tops with garlic butter, working bacon crumbles in to the dough, and maybe trying some pumpkin pie spice. Thanks for sharing!

Someone mentioned their biscuits were very crumbly and they said they used coconut flour.  You can't sub coconut for almond flour without adding a lot more liquid ingredients.  Try googling to find conversions.  Coconut flour would also give you a much softer biscuit than almond flour.

These turned out way better than I thought any paleo biscuit would ever be. They were tasty and crumbly and went with Paleo Chicken Stew quite nicely. Only change I made was that I mixed all of the wet ingredients together before adding them into the dry goods. I didn't use an ice cream scoop, I used a spoon and guessed at how big they should be. This made 12 biscuits and they were perfect after 15 minutes.

This was the first Paleo type bread I made and it's perfect! 
It tastes just like a biscuit and has a nice fluffy texture. Simple to make and stores well. I make a big batch at the beginning of the week and use it as my go-to bread. Only thing I do differently is make 8 biscuits because it's a more useful size to make a sandwich.

Really liked these. Picky hubby does too!  Ran out of coconut oil so used sunflower oil but worked fine. Not very sweet so served with raw honey and it was delicious. Might have been sweeter with the coconut oil which I will use next time.  Dough is easy to work with and that made them super easy to make.

Great taste - slightly sweet. I shoved a few frozen blueberries on top of half of them & left the other half alone. The plain will be great with a savory entree or stew. Perfect recipe as is! I made some bigger and some smaller. I read notes and used less salt -fine grind sea salt, 1/2 a tsp. Had something else in the oven on 375, baked larger size ball with blueberries for 13 minutes, the little ones for about 10-they were ALL golden brown and moist!

This was good, and easy to make. The calorie count listed is very misleading, though. I entered all the ingredients into My Fitness Pal calorie counter app, and it came out to 192 calories per biscuit (17 grams of fat, 4.4 grams of carbs, and 6 grams of protein). Just in case you were wondering....??

I made it just as the recipe said and it turned out great.   My husband said it’s a keeper.    Oops!    I didn’t have sea salt so used 1/2 tsp. Of regular salt!

I made these almost exactly as written. The only change was to reduce the sea salt by 1/4 tsp because it just seemed to be too high of a ratio of salt to the rest of the ingredients, and even then, the combination of baking soda and salt made these way too salty for my taste. They did hold up their shape well during baking, and had a nice texture, not crumbly, but I won't make these again as written.

I did not have coconut oil so I used olive oil and they are still yummy.  They would probably be even better with the coconut oil.   Otherwise, I made the recipe as written.  The second time I made these I shaped the biscuits a bit thicker than the first time and they were easier to cut.

These biscuits are phenomenal! They are similar to  a corn muffin in consistency.  I feel like I am cheating when I eat these. I will try adding bananas, pumpkin, or blueberries . I followed the recipe as written - perfect!

I made these "biscuits" exactly as the recipe was written.  They were good, but these are not "biscuits" they are more like a cornbread muffin (which I love, but wanted biscuits).  The recipe is GREAT but I was expecting a biscuit and these were not.  Also, the nutrition info is wrong.  It claims only a small amount of calories; but, if you do the math with all ingredients its more like 200 calories a "biscuit".

Pretty good. I've made them 3 times already. A bit dense, but good for soups and stews. I took one reviewer's suggestion  and did half almond flour and half coconut flour. Do NOT do this!!! Those were horrible. Stick to the recipe as written, and enjoy!

Next time I'll try using avocado oil instead of the coconut oil. And might try Cassava flour to see what it tastes like. Great recipe to experiment with! My husband loves them, so on to rosemary and cheese tea biscuits

Made exactly as instructed and these are really good, even compared to regular biscuits. Just a little bit of ghee on top and they are scrumptious. Even my kids love them!

Very good, easy to make.  I think there are many ways you could use this recipe.  I wanted to try it following the recipe exactly before I try other options.  You could add rosemary, cheese, etc. for other options or just with tea and drizzled with honey for an afternoon snack..  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe to a "T" this time but I think the next time I'll try adding some shredded cheese to the mixture. They were just as the recipe says. DELICIOUS!!! Definitely a keeper.

I made these to go with chicken cacciatore for dinner one night, so I omitted the honey since I didn't want a sweet biscuit. That's the only change I made and followed the recipe exactly barring that. That being said, these were ok except that they were WAY TOO SALTY!! I realize that you have to have some salt to assist in the leavening process, but I'm thinking 1/8 - 1/4 tsp might have been enough. I recommend you reduce the salt  significantly if you try these!

These were great. I only had 1 and a half cups blanched almond flour so I use the un-blanched almond flour for the balance. The biscuits were a lovely brown like a hamburger bun. I made Eggs Benedict top the biscuits. I may try cashew flour next!

Wondering if anyone knows what I did wrong. My dough was super crumbly. I used all coconut flour as we didn't have almond four.

Tasted great! I did some pressed down and some not and I liked the ones that were not better. They were less dense than the others. I would also watch the baking time. Mine were very brown after only 10 minutes.

I made this recipe with some slight changes.  Used cold butter instead of coconut oil, using a pastry cutter to incorporate. I used baking powder instead of baking soda, and baked on a lightly greased muffin top pan. These were good, (but did not pass the kid test)  I am trying to get used to the nutty flavour of almond flour, and figure what to use them for. They did bake up to a nice biscuit texture - a bit crumbly like cornbread. I will consider making again if I'm craving a bread like food.
