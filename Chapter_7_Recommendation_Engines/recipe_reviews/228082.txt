This is the way guacamole is supposed to be made. 5 stars for the recipe, 4 stars because of the title being redundant. Labeling things that just are that way as being that way is asinine.  Traditional or Fresh Guacamole is what I would have titled it. Put paleo as a keyword if you want people looking for paleo/paleo friendly recipes to be able to find it. Go to a grocery store and see a sign for paleo vegetables and it is just the fresh produce department would be silly. Fresh vegetables already have a name and they just are paleo. I know vegetables can be processed or preserved and guacamole can be made with preserved or artificial ingredients to make them not be paleo, but you get my point right?

This guacamole is healthy and so good! My husband just started the 'caveman diet' also know as the paleo diet and we have been eating a lot of avocado so this is a great way to stick to the diet and jazz it up a bit. We put this in lettuce wraps and use it as a condiment on top of burgers or as a salad topper. 

Sometimes I crumble up bacon on top - yum!

Great basic recipe.  You can adjust the quanities for your taste buds.  I used a half of a red onion for additional color.  This made a great addition to Super Bowl snacks.

"Thoroughly mashed" avocado does not mean you will have chunky guacamole. Try cubing each half of the avocado while still in the peel with a sharp knife. Use a large spoon to scoop the cubes out into the bowl. Gently toss with the rest of your ingredients and try not to mash the cubes.  I was taught this technique by a "Chilanga" who made it with olive oil and white vinegar (instead of lime juice) and it is fantastic this way!

This was really good.  My jalapenos were a bit large, so I minced 3/4 of one.  This gave a good flavor, without being too hot.  If the lime juice is too bright for you, add a bit more salt.

I made this, needed another jalapeno, did not add cilantro-allergic to it- and it was good.

While I think this is a perfectly awesome guac recipe I'm trying to decipher the title. Why is this paleo guacamole? Am I missing something? Thanks for any information.

I had guacamole for the first time at a Mexican restaurant the
other night.  They had to call the fire department because of the chili peppers.  I decided to try the recipe at home without those peppers and the only way to describe your recipe is with four words:  "Out of this world".

I've actually made this recipe several times...

It's quick and easy (something fun to watch, so wait till you're visitors arrive before your make it), there are no parts of this recipe that are intimating!

Great flavor and fun to make, the lime juice it key to a good guacamole. Left out the cilantro since my wife isn't fond of it. Also used 3/4 of the jalape√±o to make it milder, but should have put it all in--it was almost as mild as bell pepper this time.

Good ratio of ingredients. I left out the jalapeno and used a pinch of cayenne and a little hot sauce for heat instead.

Very good recipe!  I did not add the minced garlic because it is not usually in a traditional guacamole and it was great tasting without it, so that is definitely a taste preferential thing. ????

I absolutely love this recipe! I added some jalapeno seeds and 2 clovesof garlic to give it an extra kick. I also put all ingredients in to the food processor. First, I put in ingredients minus the avacados and process for a min high if smooth, low if chunky. Then added the avacados after. It's amzing.

Quite possibly the best guacamole that I have ever made. Thank you so much for this wonderful, simple, and delicious recipe.
