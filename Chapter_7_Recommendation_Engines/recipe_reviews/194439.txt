Decent salad. I used blanched sugar snap peas in place of the snow peas. Had great ingredients and potential. It was just missing something. Dressing was a little bland. Might reduce the sugar, use a different vinegar or add fresh lemon juice, add minced garlic and maybe a dash of chili oil in the dressing. I may also spice up the steak more before grilling.

This salad is really good.  I added cucumbers to my salad.  I really liked the salad dressing, I did leave out the sesame oil 1/2 t. doesn't add up to spending $7.00 for a bottle of oil.  My husband said the dressing didn't have a lot of taste and added Ranch dressing to his salad, but I thought the dressing enhanced the veggies and the meat.  This was a great meal all around--beautiful meal.

Oh my goodness... this salad was TASTY!  The Asian dressing totally makes the whole thing... DELICIOUS!  If you aren't a fan of "earthy" flavor, keep the raw snow peas on the side for each individual to add or not.
