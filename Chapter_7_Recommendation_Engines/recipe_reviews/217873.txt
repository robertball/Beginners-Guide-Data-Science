These are ok, but they're certainly one of the least flavorful wontons I've had.  If serving as a fried appetizer rather than in a flavorful broth they will require a strongly flavored sauce to accompany them.  The egg white is really not necessary, wontons can be sealed just by wetting the edges of the wrapper.

I thought these were flavorful and delicious. I used Italian ground pork because it was what I had on hand and pickled ginger (from the Japanese market) instead of fresh. I fried these is a shallow pan with olive oil. After using up one package of won-tons there was still about half the filling left. I used it to make the most AMAZING fried rice. Awesome!

This recipe is delicious!
These wontons are great fried, steamed, or cooked in chicken broth!

Time consuming, but well worth it, we loved them, they were delicious!  Only 2 changes; no ginger root, but all other ingredients were included, and I never boiled them, they went into the deep fryer only.  They were so good, my guy just went nuts over them!  This is one of the things I love in a Chinese buffet, but not all of them have them.

buying these from a store is fine if that is what you wish to do. But some of us do cook. and regardless of cost, home made is better, at least I know what's in there since I put it there.
