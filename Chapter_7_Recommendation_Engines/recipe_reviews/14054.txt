The amount for the diced tomatoes in this recipe as originally posted was not transcribed correctly from the submitted recipe. The recipe has been updated to read 1 (29 ounce) can diced tomatoes instead of 1 (14.5 ounce) can.

This is a great recipe, however it does need some minor tweaking.  Next time, I will follow suggestions that make it a little saucier.  Also, the ricotta mixture needs a little "oomph," like some garlic salt and red pepper flakes.  BTW, DO drain the vegetables before putting them in the lasagna.

This recipe is great for people who like their cheese baked and crusty, rather than ooey gooey, and are looking for a yummy, healthy lasagna.  I will definitely make it again.

This was fantastic!!  I replaced the Mozzarella and Parmesan with Gruyere, and decided to go with heavy cream instead of the ricotta.  I left out all those vegetables - so much fuss! - but I did opt to throw in some bacon, which I love in anything.  Also, the seasonings seemed a bit much, so I omitted those as well.  Instead of the noodles I went with a pre-baked pie crust, which of course made more sense in a pie plate rather than the 9x13 baking pan that was called for.  45 minutes to 1 hour seems like too much baking time; mine looked perfect after only 35 minutes.  My family raved about it!  Although, for some reason they thought the garlic bread I made didn't go with it.

This is a fantastic veggie lasagna recipe. It takes a while to prepare, but the results are superb. I use frozen spinach instead of fresh for ease, and sometimes I substitute meat for the veggies to make a good meat lasagna. Simply outstanding recipe!

I made this for the week that my husband was in the field. It reheated wonderfully. I added bell peppers, and broccoli, and omitted the spinach. I also sauteed all my veggies, and then mixed them in with the tomato sauce, and let it all simmer for about 30 minutes.

This is deffinately NOT a keeper.  I thought it was very bland and a bit dry.  Needed some salt .  Also, I would put the veggies in more than one layer.  With all the veggies on the same layer, they fell out when I cut it because it was such a large layer.

I would perfer ALOT more sauce! And maybe more heat added. Otherwise it was very delicious. My parents said it was excellent (especially since they didnt have to cook). The cinnamon in the sauce made it very aromatic and added an interesting twist.

This came out really well... The tomato mixture was absolutely delicious and smelled wonderful while cooking.  If you like more tomato sauce and cheese, I would add more than the amount suggested in the recipe but my husband and I loved it the way it was recommended.

This was delish! I made a few changes. I added shredded carrots, I also made more sauce- It still didn't have enough sauce for me so next time I make it I will at least double the sauce-I also put cheese and sauce on each layer. But I really liked it. I will make it again.

This recipe was fabulous !  I made it for 12 and even the kids ate it !
It does take time to prepare.....but worth it.  I used No-Boil Lasagna Noodles - this saved a step,(also in clean-up) and worked out perfect in the end.

This was okay. Even with so many spices and vegetables (and I LOVE veggies), it was missing something. Not quite as saucy as I would have liked.

I haven't made this yet, but just a note. In carefully reading the recipe the amount of Parmesan needed in the ingredients list should read 1.5 cups, not just 1/2!  Looks delicious!

I loved this lasagna. I could have done with a little less mushrooms. But it's fine if you love mushrooms! The kids didn't enjoy it a whole lot...you know how that goes. 
Oh, and I forgot the mozarella. Ah well. 
I also baked the parmesan on top instead of inside. Yummy. :)

This was a pretty good lasagna. It's got a nice tomato sauce! A few things though...I would double the amount of sauce....and I'm referrring to the receipe with the 29 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. I would double it next time around so that there is enough sauce for the lasagna itself when preparing it layer by layer (I ran out) and then for pouring over the lasagna after it's cooked. Also, add salt!! I added a little in the sauce about a teaspoon. It wasn't enough so if you are doubling the sauce add at least 2 teaspoons. Also, if you are omitting any vegetables from this dish, up the ricotta cheese mixture that you make and add it.

I loved the veggies in this recipe and also added grated carrot and broccoli.  I found it wasn't cheesy enough for my family's tastes so I added mozzerella on each layer and topped it with more parmesan than it called for.

Worth every minute. Real lasagna for real people. I found the two cans of tomatoes, diced and crushed, to be fine. My family loves this recipe, and it is a regular weekend dinner at our house. Makes enough for leftovers during the week.

I have to say I LOVE this dish!  Since recently adopting a meatless diet, I've been scouring websites looking for various vegetarian dishes.  I was very interested in this one because I am a huge fan of mushrooms, zucchini, and spinach. It is so hearty and the sauce is to die for!  I did a little "tweeking" by adding some extra seasoning, but it came out great and the cinnamon was a great finishing touch.  If there was anything I'd change is increase the amount of sauce.  The finished lasagna came out a little dry and I had to make more sauce the next day.  I didn't mind though because I'm excited I know how to make sauce from scratch!!  Again, WONDERFUL  recipe!

I used goat and sheep cheese because I am allergic to dairy, otherwise followed the recipe as is, very very good.  Took me around 45 mins of prep time and I let it bake for an hour.

This recipe took quite a bit longer than it said it would.  It was very good, but not worth the time money and energy, when it tastes almost identical to a store bought vegetable lasagna for less money.

This recipe is delicious. I added 8 oz of tomato paste and 1/2 cup of water, and it still needed more.  Next time I will add a can of tomato sauce as well.

Very tasty, all said.

This recipie was very badly written. It doesn't have an accurate amount of ingredients in the top summary.  There wasn't enough sauce so I added some tomatoe paste and some water. The veggies were watery when cooked as directed. I had to drain them. The taste could be easily achieved and surpasses with some of  your own inventiveness. Perhaps use this recipie as a starting idea and make it all your own. It isn't worth trying to follow.

This lasagna is really good!  I thought it needed more tomato sauce, so I added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  Next time, I think I will try frozen chopped spinach and canned mushrooms (to save time), and maybe add some carrots.

I made this for an group of 8 adults.  One is vegetarian and we are all cooks.  This is an excellent lasagna with rave reviews.  I doubled the sauce because so many suggested it but ended up with lots of leftover sauce so will just make the recipe amount next time.  I used no boil noodles, layered like regular lasagna (sauce, noodles, ricotta, veggies, sauce, noodles, ricotta, veggies, noodles, sauce, mozzarella and parmesan) and sprinkled a pinch of red chili flakes on each veggie layer.  I had the onions, garlic, eggs, spices and tomato products on hand and bought the veggies, noodles and cheeses.  It's not an inexpensive dish but well worth the $30 - $40 for good quality ingredients.  Will absolutely add it to my 'special occasion' file.

very good lasagna.  I've made it twice now.  1 for a friend's daughter who is vegetarian for a party.  Everybody loved it. And at Christmas.  I didn't add the cinnamon; since it would alter the taste of the sauce.  I did add more garlic and an italian seasoning i get from Penzey's Spices (Tuscan Sunset).  A lot of flavor!!  Making it for another friend of mine to try.   I used the left over sauce for the second lasagna since i basically doubled the recipe and i used it for chicken parmigiana

This is quite good, but next time I'd cut back one zucchini and one onion, and probably would do two layers of combined ricotta and veggies rather than just one of each (I think this would help hold it together a little more).

I added 1lb if hamburger and halved the veggies. I also left out the second onion in the veggie mix. Tasted fantastic! My parents loved it. Next time I make it, I might add a small can of tomato sauce to the sauce mixture just so my sauce gets a little more saucy!

I made more layers, separating the ricotta and the vegetables twice .  I only used spinach and onions because that is all I had at the time. Overall a very good tasting dinner but next time I will make thicker ricotta layers.
Update: I made another with more veggies (no meat) and a thicker layer of ricotta.  It was great!
*I made this a third time.  It has become one our favorite meals because I can cut it into squares and freeze for quick later meals.  My husband love it!

This was delicious! I think I would definitely do the ricotta blend and veggies in the same layer twice instead of separately and I would add the mozzarella later in the baking process so it's gooey and melty instead of crispy and burnt. But overall I will definitely make it again! And again....

Overall a very good recipe!!  However,  next time I am going to make more sauce and layer the cheese and veggies together.  I also used oven ready lasagna noodles and that helped to speed things up a little.

I used the best marinara sauce ever (from this site) for the sauce and my cheese measurements were off as I seemed to run out of space in my pan. I also added a layer of fresh mozzarella to the top of the dish before baking. I will be much more conscientious about space the next time I make this. I didn't think it would turn out that well but it was still great. It did fall apart a little right out of the oven so next time I will see if I can layer it better to avoid that. Very tasty!

Very interesting recipe with all the vegetables!  At first I wasn't sure of the amounts of everything, but it turned out perfect, except it needed more salt.  The cooking time was a bit long though as 30 minutes was enough time.  I will make it again, but I will use a bigger pan than the size that was in the recipe.  It definitely was not dry and I loved the crust of cheese on the top!

I was impressed with the taste.  Great receipe! The only thing that didn't strike my fancy was the cinnamon.  I like more of an Italian spice zing.  I will omit that ingredient next time and add other type of spices like garlic salt, fresh ground pepper, and Italian seasoning mix.  Overall though, super yummy!  Worth the 3 hours from start to finish....half a bottle of wine was a great partner during the entire process ;)

Love this recipe.  Have made it numerous times over the last few years.  Found it after two of my daughters went vegetarian.  I (and they) were skeptical about the zucchini, but it tasted amazing, and we all loved it.  As a meat-eater I found the zucchini added a great texture and substance to it and I didn't miss the meat at all.  We have also paired this recipe with a very similar one and added some chopped carrots which were a great addition, too!

To save time, I used two jars of pasta sauce instead of making the sauce.  For cheese, I used mozzarella as well as monterey jack and some gruyere and emmantel that I had left over from other recipes.  I separated the vegetables into two layers with the ricotta layer between.  The lasagna was great.  I could have done with less of the vegetable mixture, but my husband thought it was good the way it was.  We will definitely make this recipe again!

I've made this a half dozen times or so now, sticking very close to the original recipe and every times it was great. The recipe does not mention salt and pepper so it is up to you to add salt to taste, especially to the veggies and the sauce. I also drizzle olive oil over the top for flavor and to encourage browning. Also, it is my habit to buy bell peppers in various colors when I find them on sale, slice them into triangular pieces and freeze them and they come in handy for many recipes. I add these to the sauce and the veggies of this recipe. I wind up having to omit one of the zucchinis because the pan begins to overflow. Also, I pour off the liquid from the veggies into the sauce for extra flavor and nutrition. I also add pickled Jalopenas to the sauce. As is, the recipe is 5 stars way up. I think next time I might use eggplant instead of zucchini because it is more flavorful.

UPDATE: Yes, the eggplant was excellent. Also, I started using a canning pan (the large, cheap oval shaped ones with the ceramic coating) to not be concerned about it overflowing and that works out great.
