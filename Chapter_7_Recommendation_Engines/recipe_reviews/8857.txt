Excellent marinade but way too much butter.  I use a few tablepsoons of olive oil and whisk it into the mustard mixture, thickens it up nicely.  If still too thick, add a little bit of water.  Do this or else the chicken will be swimming in butter when it's done.  I do add 1/2 and 1/2 coarse ground mustard and Dijon.  The mustard seeds add great flavor and texture.  I've also made with boneless thighs, with and without skins.  If using skin-on chicken, broil on high for the first 5-7 min. to brown/caramelize the skin, then lower heat to regular cooking temp for the remaining cooking time.  This is when I loosely cover with foil to keep the chicken moist.  Put the extra marinade right in with the chicke when baking because it makes a wonderful sauce over rice.  Kid friendly flavors yet elegant enought for company.  When I do have comapany, I grill this for more intense flavor and color.  Also try this marinade with (grilled or baked Pork Tenderloin - SUPERB.

As a budding chef looking to expand my range of recipies, I could not be happier with this one!I have been browsing for some time for a great, unique chicken recipie that uses curry, and I have found it! 
I cut out some of the fat by using less butter than the recipie calls for and added olive oil to make up for part of the difference. I also doubled the amount of curry.
To make this a more balanced, healthful meal, I experimented and added 1/2 package of frozen stir fry vegetables (found in the freezer section of my local grocer), and added them to the chicken while it marinated.
To ensure that the vegetables remain tender but the chicken completely cooks, make sure to cover the pan during the initial 10-15 minutes of cooking at 375 degrees and then uncover and reduce the heat to about 350 degrees and cook for about another 25-30 minutes. 
Serve over a bed of jasmine rice,or cool and add to a bed of salad greens and enjoy!
The end result should be a wonderful, tasty, unique meal that your family or guests will savor!

I don't obsess about lowering the fat in everything I cook, so I ignored the previous reviews that cut down on the amount of butter and followed the instructions. If whisked well, a good emulsion forms and the butter is incorporated into the marinade properly. Olive oil does not create the emulsion properly and distorts the intended flavor. The results were excellent, but I found that the marinade overpowered the chicken. On my second attempt, I added a half teaspoon each of nutmeg and sage, which enhanced the flavor of the chicken and balanced the recipe. Overall, very good!

This is definitely going in the "family favorites" category.  I was planning on making another honey mustard chicken recipe until I saw that this one called for curry.  I thought curry would make a tasty twist to the usual honey mustard variety (got a little carried away with the curry but still tasted great!).  After a few bites, my husband insisted that we have it again next week...and the week after that...pretty much EVERY week.  I only used about 2 Tbsp light butter-flavored spread instead of the 1/3 C butter.  I found that the sauce was still a good consistency.  Next time though, I'll be sure to double the sauce so I'll have plenty to drizzle over rice.  I love how the recipe only requires a few ingredients that I usually have on hand and the directions are very simple.  Five stars all the way!

I just LOVE this easy recipe. I have made it probably 4 times in just a few weeks.  My husband doesn't like Dijon mustard at all, but he RAVES everytime I make this.  The combination of the curry, honey and mustard make a wonderful sauce that everyone who tries it is suprised. Everyone always ask me how to make it , which is why I am online to print out the recipe for the 10th time! It's not what you may expect and it is worth the try to see just how tasty this is.  My children love it too.  I sometimes will add a little cumin to the recipe for extra punch of spice.  Thanks for such a yummy recipe! **note: corn syrup will substitute for Honey if you are out or if you prefer*

I have used this same recipe for a long time and find it to always be a hit. I don't think the butter is necessary and have never used it. Also if you are in a time crunch the marinating period can be done without.  Finally for a little more flavor i would double the curry. This dish is great when served with stuffing and vegetables.

I have made this twice now, and my husband and I just flipped over it.  I was a little nervous of the large amount of curry powder, but it turned out to be a perfect balance of honey, mustard and curry.

I actually made a double batch of the sauce the second time and baked all of it with the chicken.  After the chicken was done, I plated it up on a bed of saffron rice with the extra sauce poured over all.  YUM!!

This is definitely a new staple recipe in my household that will be made again and again.

Very easy and yummy! **** Made this for the second time almost 3 years later and it is just great!  Wonderful flavor and super easy to prepare.  My chicken came out so moist, tender and juicy.  And there was plenty of sauce to spoon over brown rice.  It seems like a lot of curry but it is not too much.  Great recipe!

This was easy to make and our entire family enjoyed it.  I used brown mustard in place of the dijon and only marinated the chicken for 30 minutes, but the taste was still great.  We served it with brown rice, which was a good compliment.  Though, basmati probably would have been a better choice.

This bird recipe is cluckin' slap yo mama good! Best prepared with skin-on thighs or wings... be sure to stick under the broiler to let the sauce sizzle into the crisped skin.   ~ You can use a little less butter without sacrificing flavor, the amount listed has the chicken swimming in butter. ~ You can substitute basic yellow mustard for the dijon, it just won't have as much of a horseradishy bite.

After reading the reviews I modified the recipe by adding more curry and cooking for a longer period of time. I liked the overall taste, however I felt that the honey overpowered the rest of the ingredients. Next time I would use half of what's called for. Adding cumin was a great idea!

We really liked this a lot.  Followed the recipe exactly in terms of ingredients.  However, the cooking time seems off to me.  I baked 10 minutes covered, then another 10 per the recipe.  Chicken was still raw (and I used blsl thighs which are usually thinner than breasts) and needed an additional 25 minutes in the oven.  We liked the subtlety of the curry, not overpowering, with the nice kick of the cayenne.  The second time I made this I used the 1/3 cup butter but doubled the rest of the sauce ingredients.  Served with basmati rice - the extra sauce works well with the rice.

Tasty!  I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the marinade and it was a great addition.  Also, just before serving I sprinkled a generous amount of chopped fresh parsley and squeezed some fresh lemon juice over it which really complemented the flavors nicely.  Served over a bed of couscous, it was a hit!  This recipe made a lot of marinade, enough for 7-8 chicken breasts.  Some final notes, I found I had to bake the chicken for much longer than the recipe called for, around 35 - 40 mins total (probably because I used more chicken breasts.)  Also I did not use the full amount of butter, maybe half of what the recipe called for.  Overall I'm very happy with this one.  Leftovers should make great sandwiches or chicken salad.

Delicious!  I followed others recommendations and tweaked it to suit my taste but it is very yummy and I'll be making it again.

Change suggestions:
2tbs butter, 2 tbs olive oil, 1/4 honey, 1/2 djion, 2tbsp curry, 1 pinch cayenne, 1 pinch cumin.

I added 1/2 red onion and cut up 5 mushrooms into the pan and cooked them with the chicken.

So good!

This recipe was simply superb!  I followed the ingredients list exactly but used 3 chicken breasts because mine were enormous and very thick. So that they would cook evenly, I pounded them out a bit and tucked under the thin edge. Admittingly, I didn't have time to marinate, but the flavor combination was just too exciting to wait to try. The end result offered unexpectedly complex flavor that was both robust and balanced, and the chicken was incredibly moist.  I am sure marinating would just make it that much better!  I paired it with a side of garlic herbed couscous cooked in chicken stock. It complimented the chicken well.  Thank-you very much for the submission!

Curry lovers rejoice!  A wonderful, simple weeknight dish with few ingredients and a big taste packed punch.  I prepared this exactly as written, baked at 350 for 45 minutes out of the fridge.  Loved it, you will too!  Thanks for this tasty, tasty dish, Priscilla.

Yummy recipe. I'm sure it is delicious with that much butter, but I just used a tablespoon and it came out just fine. The cooking time is way off, too. I ended up cooking it for about 45 minutes.

This is one of those dishes that I would give more than 5 stars if possible. So easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand. The only thing I changed was adding less butter, probably 2 Tbsp, then completed with olive oil and it was just perfect. I also would recommend to marinate the chicken and refrigerate overnight to give more flavor. Served with basmati rice and steamed green beans.

I love this recipe! It's a staple chicken recipe in our house. Very easy and very very tasty. I have made it "as is" and I've also cut the butter by a tbsp or two and it's always great. Sometimes I substitute one tsp of the curry powder for a tsp of hot curry powder for some kick. Usually I make it with 8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs and serve the sauce over rice. If I think to marinate the dish beforehand, great. But most of the time I don't and it's still fantastic.

If the chicken breasts you're using are particularly thick I would suggest cutting them in half. If you have to cook this recipe for longer than about 30 mins the sauce can start to burn.

OK there is a reason why this recipe got rated highly by so many other people. It is WONDERFUL. Even my husband raved about it and he is an engineer that doesn't really get excited about many things at all. Also my 2 two year old sons loved it also. Only advice to anyone trying this for the first time is to be sure to buy a lot of chicken because everyone will gobble up all of it quickly. This one is definitely going to be a regular at my house.

I need to explain this review, as is this recipe is really just okay in my opinion. I think it has like many others have mentioned way to much butter. Not enough curry or cayenne pepper. And it just was a little bit disappointing because it sounds so heavenly, the ingredients are good they just need to be altered. 2 tbsps butter, 1/4 cup curry before ( you knock this add it in gradually as it cooks trust me it comes out perfect) and i sprinkled the entire sheet with cayenne pepper. And 8 diced green onions. And after it was done I added 2 diced jalepenos (I don't like soggy jalenpenos, and this keeps it milder for those who don't like it to hot) After all that it comes up to a top notch marinade!!!

Based on prior reviews, I made a few changes to the recipe, and we loved the results. I first sprinkled salt, pepper, and cumin on the chicken breasts.  Then I pounded them a little flatter to avoid having to lengthen the cooking time, and to work in the spices.  As for changes to the sauce, I used a tbs of melted SmartBalance instead of all that butter, three tsp of yellow curry powder and one tsp of red curry powder, and added one clove of minced garlic.  Everything else stayed the same.  The chicken cooked perfectly in 20 minutes and tasted great!

This is EXCELLENT! I have been making it on a regular basis for over a year & most often use chicken thighs (& remove the skin 1st!) Sometimes I add a pinch of cumin (as we love that spice) & the aroma of it cooking is enough to prime anyones apetite.
Bon Apetit!

Delish and easy.  I made it last minute.  I chopped up the chicken into bite sized pieces, cooked in a pan with olive oil, then added frozen veggies when halfway done.  I added the sauce at the end and turned to low to simmer while I set the table.  I made it with sweet brown rice, cooked with a splash of sugar and shredded coconut.  DINNER IN UNDER 20 MINUTES!

I have used this recipe for many years and loved it. 
It is fantastic just as it is and without fail has been a hit. I also bbq it on a medium heat to prevent it from blackening too much with the honey.
I've found it works well with any mustard, all have a unique flavour.

This was DELICIOUS!  We used 1/3 c. olive oil, because we have milk allergies in our family, so when I can, I avoid making 2 separate dishes!  I also used Spicy Brown mustard instead of Dijon, simply because that was what I had on hand.  We served it with some "Spicy Rice" - Rice cooked with chicken broth instead of water and a little curry.  We had some carrots and green beans too.  We put it in our monthly rotation we loved it so much!

Great!  I replaced the butter with evoo (used maybe 3 T. or so) and added a little water to slightly thin out the sauce.  Like another reviewer, I tossed about half a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies in with the chicken to marinate.  I cooked the dish covered at 375° for 15 minutes, then uncovered and cooked at 350° for 30 minutes.  Hubby and I both loved this!

I have made this recipe a number of times, and each time I get tons of compliments. I usually make it with wild rice-- it makes a delicious accompaniment to the flavors from the chicken. I suggest using a fork to make holes in the chicken before marinating so the flavors can mix.

I prepared this recipe earlier in the year and forgot to review it until this time. This is fabulous, easy to prepare and very delicious. I served this  over a bed of steamed basmati rice on a platter and added a sprig of cilantro for garnish. Try using your own homemade curry powder as I did and it will make your palate sing.  Served with baked squash and also a side dish of  Indian tomato raita.  I'm happy. :)

DELICIOUS!!!  Yum, yum, yum does not say enough!  I used Digon mustard that has a seedy texture to it and bone-in, skinless, chicken thighs.  I used less butter that it says and added 6 tsps of currey powder.  I mixed the chicken in the marinade, stuck it in a glass baking dish and then put it in the fridge overnight.  My hubby got home from work plucked it in the oven covered with foil for 25 minutes at 375 and then another 20 minutes uncovered.  He turned on the rice cooker with some long grain brown rice and VOILA an absolute gourment tasting meal (that somehow he took all the credit for...lol).  And leftovers tasted even better the next day for lunch!  You won't be disappointed.

This recipe is delicious! My 3 year old granddaughter, who does not like to eat meat, begged to try this because of the aroma, then begged for more because of the taste.  I altered the recipe by using about 1/2 the butter than the recipe called for.

I agree this dish is delicious.  However, it needs much more time to cook than the recipe calls for.  I ended up cooking it for 45 minutes, which squares with the Better Homes and Gardens standard time for roasting chicken breasts - 45-55 minutes at 375 degrees for 2 1/2 to 3 pounds of meat.  So, just plan for extra time, then enjoy!

This turned out great! I used 3 large bone in breasts and marinated for several hours. I subbed olive oil for the butter and added some garlic too! Added a little extra curry because we like it.  Will be making again, thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is very good. I used 1/4c of butter and added some red pepper flakes because I didn't have the ground cayenne. I used 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs but kept the sauce amount the same. There was plenty imo. I thought it would be more intense with such strong flavors of curry and dijon, but I actually found the flavor to be quite mild. Next time I will use more curry than called for. Love how quick and easy it is to put together. I baked at 375*, covered with foil, for 20 min and then uncovered at 350* for 25 min. Served it with brown rice, which we put the extra sauce on (so good!) and steamed zucchini. Will definitely be added to the regular rotation!

This dish is fabulous!!  I love curry "anything" though.  I just used Kraft Honey Mustard dressing/dipping sauce and about 2 T butter.  It is so flavorful and moist and yummy.

really nice. i liked the flavor, it came out so moist. i cooked it for 30 minutes at 350, then it sat in the oven for a bit longer. it was a bit sweet, so next time i'll do a little less honey, but that's just personal taste. i really like the touch of curry flavor.

Wow!  "Honey this chicken is Excellent!" according to my husband when he called me on the phone to tell me how much he liked this chicken.  I had fixed it the night before so this was the reaction the second day.  And it could not have been easier to make.  This is pretty amazing considering my husband and I would tell you that we don't like curry.  Of course, this recipe made liars out of us!   I followed the recipe except substituted reduced fat margarine for butter and used less of it.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  I'm sure it would taste even better with real butter (although it is hard to imagine it tasting better).  I think the only reason to change it would be to try to lower fat and calories.  I don't think there is any reason to change it because of taste.  This will definitely become a regular go to recipe for us.  For those that don't like curry go ahead and give it a try in this recipe.  I bet you will like it in this combination of flavors.  Thanks for sharing such an awesomely delicious, quick and easy recipe.

This was really, really good.  I was delayed on a flight home and didn't have time to marinate, so I took another reviewer's hint and cooked the thin cut breasts in a non-stick skillet after mixing all the sauce ingredients.  I turned and basted the chicken frequently.  Served with rice on the side (used this sauce on the rice, too).

This was great! Not a typical "curry" flavor, but instead it kind of made its own unique taste. The only thing I'd do different next time is to melt the butter on the stove and fry the curry in it a little before hand to get out some of the grittyness that uncooked curry can sometimes have. Other then that, fabulous!

I tried this as I was looking for a curried chicken recipe.  I thought the taste was okay, but my husband, who ends up not being a fan of mustard, didn't like it very much.  Of course he ate it, but my three little ones didn't, even though I doubled the amount of honey because the mustard taste was too much as written.  So, I think this is great for those who love mustard, just not for my family.

Pretty good chicken recipe.  Very, very easy.  I will probably use less honey next time - it was a little too sweet for my taste.

Good recipe, will definitely make it again. Next time I will try pan searing the meat for a couple of minutes each side to caramelize the sauce on the meat surface before baking in the oven for added flavour and colour.

This is easy to make and tastes amazing!  The only thing I do to shave off a few calories is I use a little less the 1/4 cup of butter and it tastes just as good.  This is great over coconut rice!!!

As far as dinners go that require 5 minutes or less of prep time, this is about as good as it gets. We loved the sauce, so next time I will probably double it so that we have more to pour over our rice. And I may also cut the chicken into smaller pieces so that they absorb more of the sauce. This was very tasty, very easy, very quick. We'll make it again.

This is a fabulous recipe - I cut the chicken into cubes before cooking and serve over rice. You can also use regular yellow mustard - just as tasty.

A good dish, however, didn't that punch I was expecting from the curry and cayenne pepper. I being the "pantry queen" was shocked to find, I was out of dijon so I used Boar's Head spicy deli mustard. Definitely, could have done without the butter, it added no extra flavor just extra fat. Hubby and I did like it, we will just make some minor adjustment next time.

I doubled the curry, added cumin, and used drumsticks instead of chicken breast. This is a nice recipe, but as another reviewer said, it will not satisfy your hot curry cravings.

My favorite recipe so far off these pages.  The juice is great over rice, and the chicken is suffused with flavor.  Using mild curry makes this a good recipe for those not in love with heat.  High fat dish, so around here, it gets saved for really special occasions.

Really good.  The honey balances out the mustard and curry flavors nicely.  It could use more salt though.

I was looking for something new and different to throw on the grill tonight......this was it!  I had to use yellow prepared mustard instead of Dijon.  I basted the chicken once on each side while it was grilling.  It was fantastic!

This is a great recipe.  My husband is not a big fan of honey mustard, but loved it.  I used Grey Poupoun deli mustard and it turned out great.

Quick, easy and good!  My daughter (8 yrs old) wouldn't eat it, but then who would 
expect a kid that age to eat curry? ;-)  Hubby & I loved it though, especially how easy 
it was to just pop in the oven after marinating all night!  It took longer to cook to my 
preferred level of doneness, though, than the recipe recommends, but your preference 
may vary.  I served this with fresh cooked carrots and jasmine rice... YUM!  I'd love to 
try this grilled, too!

This was a neat spin off the regular honey mustard chicken recipes -- very tangy!  I didn't give it time to marinate and it was still great!  I used Grey Poupon and think it's what made the taste.  Next time, I will try holding some sauce aside to coat julienned sweet potatoes or carrots to let bake alongside.  THANKS!  A easy and tasty 5* in my book!

I make this recipe with water instead of the melted butter, this way you get lots of yummy sauce. I found I didn't like the consistency when I made it with the oil.
This has become a regular at my house. Good to use chicken thighs or firm tofu

Very tasty and smells great, too!  I baked the chicken about 10 minutes longer to make sure it was done.  Chicken came out tender and juicy, and the dish was very quick & easy to make.

I didn't think I would like this recipe because I'm not a fan of curry! Boy, was I wrong and glad I decided to try it. This recipe is simply delicious. I prepared it exactly as the recipe calls and I couldn't imagine changing a thing! Well, except that no one in my family ever finishes an entire chicken breast so I usually cut it into strips to save wasting. I will update once I try it with chicken strips. I highly recommend this :)

We really love this recipe. I made it exactly as written the first time. The second time I made it I cut up the chicken and cooked it in the sauce on the stove. The curry was much more flavorful when cooked in the oven. Served it over white rice. This one is a keeper.

A recipe I remember from the past. Used bone-in skinless thighs, so had to cook longer than specified.  Didn't have time to marinate but dish was still flavorful.  I used all of the butter, and while it was probably unnecessary to do so, it turned out just fine (might cut back next time).  This recipe was a good solution for a very last minute dinner party.  Roasted fingerling potatoes and a nice salad and we were good to go.  Can't go too wrong here.

I use bottled Italian dressing instead of the butter and it is so good with the extra spices.  I usually use thick breast so it takes longer in the oven, usually 40 to 45 min then I uncover for 10 minutes more

This was absolutely to die for!! I am not a fan of curry- So I started with a LOT less than it called for. Added more in half teaspoon increments tasting after each addition. I ended up going to the suggested amount in the recipe and, frankly, I could have handled even more.

One note...the left overs are even BETTER.  I may even consider making this dish the night before I actually want to serve it, they were that good.

This came out really wonderful. We ended up broiling the chicken for about 3 minutes on each side [after the initial 20 minutes] and it gave it a nice crispiness. I really liked that the flavor wasn't too overpowering but then again we only marinated the chicken for about an hour. Will definitely make this again.

I like the base idea of this recipe but as is, is a little too bland.  I like rich, flavorful curries.  I added a few shakes of sea salt, some cumin, and pineapple.  I'll use it again but I still think it needs more flavour.

This dish was very good. I used curry paste instead of powder, helped make the sauce thicker. Make sure you whisk the mixture WELL, it will help the butter distribute evenly, so once you refrigerate it, if wont clump weird. I added some fresh raw peppers to the dish along with cilantro, really gave the chicken the finishing touch!

Absolutely loved it!  Only thing I did different was to use bone in chicken breast (no skin) and flipped the chicken a few times.  Had the perfect amount of sauce to pour on top of the chicken and some brown rice.

This is great! I let it marinate overnight and the flavor was wonderful. Next time I'll remember to add the cayenne pepper, I'm sure it'll be worth 5 stars.

This is one of my Grandmother's recipes that I love to make. If you use boneless, skinless chicken tenders it will cook on top of the stove covered in about 20min. I like to add sliced raw carrots to the mix. Even my picky husband likes this dish over rice.

I would have given it 5 stars if it had more color. The chicken looked almost white but it was good. I used the thin sliced boneless chicken and cooked 15 covered and 15 uncovered. I was reluctant to only do 10 and 10 because it was chicken, but I think it would have been even better with the recommended time because my cutlets were so thin.

I made these according to the recipe, but it was way too sweet for our taste.  It needs more of something to balance out all of the honey.  Dont know if I'll be making this again, but if I do it will need some tweaking

Love the taste, but feel that the butter needs to be reduced.  I prefer this dish with boneless/skinless chicken thighs, baked longer, and then no butter is needed.  My boyfriend "doesn't like curry" but loves this dish.

Yikes...this did not turn out well at all. Probably my own doing as I am a beginner cook. The thing is though...the chicken was slimy and bland...didnt look a thing like a picture.

Used brown spicy mustard because I did not have dijon. It turned out fine, the taste was pretty good but could have been better. Not sure what I would add next time to make it balanced (was the brown mustard too strong? too much curry? I'm not sure). Anyway, overall it was good and easy to make. Will make again with some more thought and tries, I think it could be 5 stars.

My family has never had curried anything until I made this. We all absolutely love it.  I don't add the cayenne pepper because my little ones don't like anything with even a hint a spice. It's great without it.

We liked and would repeat this recipe.  It took a lot longer than 20 minutes to cook, though.  I'd plan on at least 30.  Lots of sauce that would have been excellent with rice.

I've made this recipes several times now.  My husband doesn't care for chicken and yet this is one of his favorite dishes he'll actually ask for.  Everytime I bring it to a party, everyone is talking about and asking for the recipes.  I don't change anything, it doesn't need any changes.

WONDERFUL!!!! It was verrrrry hard to not stray form the recipe like I usually do, but I stuck to it as is since other reviewers said it was so good. This is truly amazing and tastes great! I doubled the sauce and decided to add cut up potatoes after seeing it in one of the recipe photos. It was a nice touch, but not necessary. We ate over rice and will be lunch tomorrow at work! I wonder how it would taste with a little garlic and onion?? I also only marinated for two hours and included some wings I had. Great recipe....5 stars!

We loved this!!!  First of all, I read the other reviews and cut the butter to 2 TBSPs.  I used half dijon and half yellow mustard and cut the curry by about 1 tsp just b/c I was a little leary of it.  Don't be!!!  Next time I will put all the curry b/c it was wonderful and not overpowering at all.  I ended up doubling the sauce though b/c once I got it all mixed up and loved the taste.  I served with rice and green beans.  I had enough sauce to add to the chicken and rice once it was served.  I wouldn't tell the dear husband what it was until he raved about it.  We both were shocked how great it was b/c both of us didn't think we cared for curry that much.  Don't be afraid....really, it we will make this often! BTW, even after doubling sauce I only added 2 TBSP of butter.  It didn't need anymore than that.

Nice, easy and inexpensive workday meal! I cooked my chicken about 25 minutes total and then removed it from the  pan and let the sauce brown a little longer - maybe 8 minutes. We had this with spiced rice and peas and a spinach salad. Easy and good! Thanks!

My husband can't get enough of this.  Next time I might cut down on some of the butter, but we loved this recipe!

I made this with leg/thigh quarters, and added chopped potatoes...it was SOO good!  I used brown mustard, and red curry paste... it was all I had...and also didn't let it marinate for 4 hours...maybe only two...but my whole family loved it!  I served with rice, and green vegetables. I can't imagine bbqing it since in the oven the chicken cooks in the juices which makes it so juicy.  I am saving this recipe, and can't wait to make it again!

YUM.  I made this with boneless, dark meat, which is what I had on hand, and my husband and I ate it all up!  I will definitely be making this again.  Also, if you're an onion fan like us, I recommend cutting up an onion and marinading it along with the chicken, too.

Really, really good and very easy.  I did not marinate the chicken and used chicken thighs because that's what I had.  I followed advice from another review to broil for 5-7 minutes prior to cooking for the rest of the time.  I also added mini yellow bell peppers and their sweetness was a perfect match.  I think that it would also work well to add golden raisins - similar to Indian cooking.  Very tasty and I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent!  I took the advice of others and instead of 1/3 cups of butter I used 3 tbsps of margarine and 2 tbsps of olive oil.  I served this over flavour infused rice and a summer salad.  I had to print out the recipe for my guests as they left. Thanks Priscilla.

This recipe is wonderful.  Even my three young children ate all of theirs.  We tried it in the oven first, and loved it.  The next time we put it on the grill, on low heat.  It was even better.  I will put this in my regular dinner rotation.  It was excellent and so easy!!

This is probably the best recipe I've pulled off of this site.  I was a bit skeptical at first because I like my curry hot and not sweet, but WOW, what a mouth watering dish!  The curry is very subtle and even if you're not a fan, you'd surely love this chicken!  Next time, I will use less butter as the recipe called for a bit too much.

Pretty greasy, but all in all very flavorable and tender chicken! This is certainly a keeper. Not too over powering. This dish hits the spot when craving curry. Love it! Love it!

This was really easy to make.I put all the ingredients in a baggie. Let it sit for a couple of hours. I had to cook it another 10mins. Wasn't cooked all the way. Had a really nice flavor.

My husband and I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I ended up using a tad bit less butter, cutting up the chicken into bite-sized pieces and serving it over rice. I also doubled the sauce and that made for a really nice sauce to put over the rice. VERY yummy!

I made this recipe last night and enjoyed it. The only change I made was substituting EVOO for the butter and don't feel like it adversely affected the dish whatsoever. 

I thought it would be more fun to cut the chicken into bite-size pieces, so I sauteed them in a pan with the marinade. After I got them cooked, I added in a frozen stir-fry veggie mix. I served this dish over white rice. We all enjoyed this slightly spicey dish and I'd probably make it again.

Absolutely delicious! Specifically used: Grey Poupon Dijon mustard, unsalted butter, and Malabar Masala Curry Powder from Singapore. Added 1/3 bag of snow peas and 1 sliced sweet red pepper. Baked 12 mins covered, and 20 minutes uncovered. Sauce was great over brown rice! A keeper!

This was FANTASTIC!  I used the leftover chicken carcass and skin to make an amazing stock (to which I added a touch more curry and a can of evaporated milk).  Will absolutely make again.

If you love curry, you will love this. So simple to make! I didn't have time to marinate this for the full amount of time, only about an hour and it still had wonderful flavor. This was the first time I had exposed my family to curry and they didn't care for this unfortunately. If it was up to me I would make this over and over.

very good recipe....I added way more cayenne pepper for an added kick. Next time I would double the marinade for more sauce for leftovers and to pour over rice.

This turned out SO well, and it was incredibly easy to make.  I had to cut the marinating time due to lack of time, and as I used the spicier and stronger  madras curry powder, I used slightly less of it than the recipe called for.  It had a lovely light (yet slightly spicy) flavor and the chicken was oh-so-tender.  Great recipe!

Love this recipe.  It is a crowd pleaser -- a great intro to the world of curry.  My picky 5 yr. old loved it, and my spice loving husband gave it thumbs up as well.  Great with steamed rice or couscous, sweet potatoes, and bell peppers or a salad with citrus dressing.

I made this last night. This recipe produces a very mild sweet curry sauce.  Very good but do not make if you're craving curry.  I served this over sweet potato puree which I found complimented the dish very well. I will be making this again as it is very easy and very tasty!

Outstanding!  My husband and I absolutely LOVE curry so we knew this dish was going to be a winner!  I added more curry powder than the recipe called for, of course!  I used lemon herb chicken from Costco and marinated this in the curry/mustard sauce for 24 hours -- the chicken was 100% fork-tender.  This recipe will go in the rotation because it has ingredients that are always in the pantry.  A side dish of mixed veggies made this a guilt-free dinner, too.

I didn't change anything about this recipe, except that I cooked it for 30 minutes total (20 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered).  It was DELICIOUS!!!  I thought the mixture of honey, mustard and curry was just right -- not too sweet and not too spicy.  I wouldn't change a thing!  I served it with a long grain and wild rice mixture and steamed broccoli.  My husband LOVED it and I will definitely be making it again!

I'll jump on the bandwagon and add that this is one of the easiest and best tasting chicken dishes I've made in a long time.  Took so little time to prepare.  Careful, the dijon mustard and curry together make it very spicy.  I love curry and this was definitely an inventive variation.

Intersting chicken.  I reduced the curry to 3 tsp and was still full of flavor. I also did the stove-top method instead of baking and turned out good.  Since it was so easy, I may make again but I'm debating how often I'll have a craving for this one...

We were very pleased with the wonderful taste of this chicken.  Our 5 year old daughter LOVED it and ate 2 pieces. The honey added another dimension and married well with the curry and mustard. Very good. Thank you.

Oh my god!  this recipe is so simple and the taste is excellent.  I made this for my Swedish mother in law and she loved it.  My husband can't get enough of this.  I have made it 2 times and plan to make again.  I used a full chicken instead of the chicken breast and it looked great!

I just made this and it turned out great.  I followed the recipe other than: I used ghee instead of butter and added 1/2 teaspoon of each cumin, nutmeg and sage.  I also used a bit more than a pinch of cayenne.  I cooked it for 20 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered, as the breasts were large.  We ate it with quninoa (cooked in broth with garlic), drizzling the left over sauce on the quinoa. Everyone in the family loved it, including a fussy 7 year old.  Next time I will try to add water instead of the butter/ghee, as I don't think it was wholly necessary.  I did not find this too sweet at all, so not sure why others writing reviews might have, and we don't eat much sweet food. Maybe it depends on the type of mustard used.  I used a whole grain dijon.

This was great. I don't like mustard at all and I think the curry powder dances well with the mustard to make it taste like asian-y. I did however cut back on the butter and substituted it with olive oil. It was so easy. I cooked 2 breasts and 2 thighs for 30 mins basting after 15 mins in.

This is one of those OMG recipes...everyone loved it..my husband and 2 sons. I DOUBLE the recipe with the exceptions being I used only 2 tbsp. melted butter combined with grapeseed oil to make a total of 1/3 c; and I used 3tbsp  of curry powder. It is great to have the extra sauce for rice or brown rice noodles (which is what I have served with it so far) Tonight I am making regular mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes to try along side this dish. The recommendation to double the amount of curry powder is a good one because it definitely doesn't overpower the overall taste...definitely has a CRAVE factor!
Also, I bake longer...about 20 minutes covered and then another 20 uncovered.Excellent with boneless skinless chicken thighs too :)

I love curry and I love chicken. I'm easily doing this simple recipe for dinner three times a week.  Sometimes I do the full 4+ hour marinade and sometimes it's a little over a half hour.  I make it using chicken thighs.  Making one in the oven right now. Heheh

I am not a big spice fan and while I enjoy the milder curries this one was just a bit too strong for me. While I will more than likely not make this again (or will make a alternate version instead) I would recommend this to my more adventurous friends who have stronger taste buds and can handle it's kick.

We didn't hate this but also didn't love it.  If I were to make it again I would definitely tweak the recipe a bit.  I'd use olive oil instead of butter for one.  Also, I'd add some salt and fresh garlic to it I think.

My family LOVES this!   The only difference I do is I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and serve with loads of the sauce over hot rice.  Makes my husband, son, and two young daughters very happy.  Thank you for a great recipe!

My whole family loves this recipe.  I have used it many times for company and it gets rave reviews every time.  It is so easy to make and delicious too.  I up the curry on this to 2 Tbsp, but we love curry.  I use Grey Poupon for the mustard.  I always serve it with Basmati rice and Naan bread.

We both really enjoyed the recipe. I used chicken tenderloins, so I did not bake it the full time. I broiled it for a few minutes at the end. Next time, I will try it with a little less butter.

Excellent. Lots of flavor. I used chicken tenderloins,
pounded slightly to absorb even more as the chicken marinaded. Side of Mash and a vegetables,
and you have a great family meal. Thank You For Sharing.

I added about 1/4 cup of half and half to the marinade. The dairy makes the meat even juicier. I've made this chicken about five times and people always rave about it.

I make this ALL the time. While I still follow the original recipe, I like to change a few things to make it more of an Indian-style dish. I cut my chicken breasts up into approx. 1in pieces, and double the sauce (but I do not quite double the butter, since as others have said, you can use less butter.) I marinate the chicken in the sauce overnight or for a few hours if I don't have time. I either cook the dish in the oven for about 20 minutes and then finish up on the stove in a skillet, OR put it right in my slow cooker and cook on low for 5-6 hours. I serve it with rice and warm Naan. Have found you can add a dollop of greek yogurt to cut the spice if desired.

Absolutely and undeniably delicious! So flavorful and savory (with a few additions).... I'm not sure why the recipe doesn't call for basic seasonings like salt and pepper, but this is what I included along with onions and cut up potatoes (also with s/p). 
Amazing!

I love this recipe but my husband is not the biggest fan. I still make it on occasion and he will still eats it. His biggest problem is the curry (he's not much of a curry fan.) I love curry!
I use a little less butter and a little less curry.

Added about a tablespoon of brown sugar and about a handful of unsalted, roasted peanuts. I needed to cook it for about 20 minutes uncovered... it was still pink in the middle after 10 covered and 10 uncovered for me. Excellent taste!

I've made this twice now and I love it.  My son really loves it.  My husband seems to think it's a little too swet so we've opted to cut the honey in half next time, so we'll see how it goes!

A very simple but tasty recipe. I have made this both in the oven and last night on the grill. The grill definitely wins but doesn't it always?  Only change is cutting down on the butter. Thanks for a great recipe where even the bf who thinks he doesn't like curry, likes this. :)

Fantastic chicken recipe.  I love curry, so this was really enjoyable.  Cut the butter by half, and added a little bit more than a pinch of cayenne (like things spicy).  It turned out fabulous and I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good but not great.  I agree with a previous reviewer who said it tastes just like honey mustard chicken with curry in it.

Very easy.  Only had time to marinate for about 30 min.  Grilled.  It was delicious.  Will definitely make on the grill again and leave some sauce out for dipping.  Served w/ saffron rice and peas/carrots.  Mixed all leftovers together for a one dish lunch the next day.  My husband, and even my 3 and 5 year old boys loved it!

Prepared exactly as directed, this chicken was pretty good.  Of course, I went out and bought an entire bottle of currie powder, so now I'm on the hunt for a stellar recipe to use the rest of it up (eventually).

this, at best, was lackluster.  i could barely taste the curry.  it was tender but then that's from my oven cooking, not the marinade.   i won't be making it again.  sorry:(

Used this marinade on Chicken wings. I used Hot and sweet mustard, not Dijon-style. Omitted the cayenne, because the curry powder I use is very hot. Baked at 375, then broiled to get the caramelization. Gone in a flash! Perfect recipe for a beginner too!

I am baking this chicken right now so I'll see how it turns out. Here are my changes: 5 breasts, 1/6 cup butter, 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup water, 1/3 cup prepared mustard, 1/4 dry mustard, 3 cloves pressed garlic, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 6 tsp curry powder, 1tsp cayenne pepper if that, all whisked very well. I then marinated this for at least 4 hours where as I cut into thin strips. Now it is baking at 190 C for***I cooked for about 17 minutes. I served over rice topped with sesame seeds and raisins as well as a spinach salad. Scrumptious. My entire family loved it! They said I should for sure makes this every couple weeks. Wonderful recipe!

Very good and extremely easy.  I omitted the cayenne and we used Basset and Morton curry powder (it's a sweet yellow curry...our favorite).  I browned it in a skillet, before baking, to carmelize the chicken.  It only needed about 12 minutes in the oven after that.  The next time I make this, I will probably add red pepper flakes since we don't care for cayenne.  Also, it was lacking just a little tang for me.  Maybe a squeeze of fresh lime after baking. Served with coconut rice and steamed peas.  Yum!

This was a very good honey mustard chicken.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts since that's what my husband likes (and they are much more flavorful than the breasts).  I did not marinate the chicken in the sauce as I needed to make this right then, but next time I think I will as the sauce kinda 'slides' off a bit while cooking.  I actually put the thighs in the oven, uncovered and lightly seasoned without sauce, for about 15 min at 425 just to crisp up the skins.  Then I lowered the heat to 350, brushed with honey mustard, covered, and cooked until finished.  I left out the cayenne because I had put black pepper on the chicken and cut down the curry by 1 tsp...but I think next time I'll use all the curry.  It really adds a nice 'something extra' to a usual honey mustard.

I followed the popular reviews and halved the butter, doubled the curry, and next time I will also add cayenne because i thought it was very sweet without any spice. Of course the spiciness also depends on the curry you use. Mine was mild and we love spicy food. Easy to make and a great staple for dinners. Most people have these items on hand too so thats a plus! I served with mixed veggies and wild rice.

I was so surprised that this was the only entry for curried honey mustard chicken! I read about curried hm chicken in a magazine but couldn't find it again, so i tried this one out, and it turned out great! I did give it 4 stars, even thought i changed it a bit. I had to substitute the curry powder for red curry paste, and i completely left out the butter. I thought this was awesome, as did everyone else. I will probably make it again.

Will be making this again! I used chicken and tofu and baked together. It did need a double recipe of sauce. Next time I will cut back on the butter as I felt guilty about eating it for that reason. Served with Easy Masoor Daal also on this site, peas and rice.

Very easy and delicious! I omitted the pepper (I was out of it) but think it would have made it even better.  Cilantro would have been good sprinkled on the top.  Will try that next time along with a little more curry powder.  Overall a wonderful chicken dish that my husband really enjoyed! Thanks!

This chicken is delicious!  My husband and I have this all the time now that we've tried it.  I didn't make a single change to this recipe.

I love this recipe!! I have never used the butter or cayenne or marinated it and it turns out great every time. Also I chop the chicken into chunks, sometimes using thigh meat instead of breast. It bakes much quicker and is great served over rice!! The rice soaks up the tasty sauce. My picky 10 year old loves it and almost licks her plate clean!!

VERY VERY GOOD! I've tried several honey mustard chicken recipes, and this one gets first prize. I used 2 teaspoons of curry since I'd never tasted curry before and was afraid 4 teaspoons would be too strong. Also left out the cayenne pepper, just because I don't like it. I skipped the marinating so I could have it ready for dinner in a flash and it still came out fabulous!

Awesome flavor!! I followed the recipe exactly, except for that I added some diced onion and shredded carrot just before baking. Like other reviews have stated, I did have to bake it longer than the recipe stated. Served it with oven roasted potatoes w/ cilantro and steamed broccoli. This is the first time I've ever made edible chicken, and it was so easy.

I've never tried Curry, and wasn't sure I'd like it, and my boyfriend is a major Curry fan.  I made this and he said it was better than most resturants.  The best he's had! I even liked it...thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I made it using 2 Tbsp of olive oil in place of the butter and marinated cubed boneless, skinless chicken breasts for about 4 hours.  I then baked the chicken for half an hour in the oven.  The chicken was well flavored and my kids loved it.  Next time I will decrease the honey and up the curry and cayenne a bit to let a little more warmth cut through the sweetness.  This paired beautifully with jasmine rice.  Yummmmm!

We all loved this recipe even after only manrinating it for 30 minutes.  I was looking for a recipe with ingredients I had on hand and this fit the bill-plus it was great.  I served the chicken over white rice and green beans with extra sauce over the top

We loved this. I used chicken thighs with bone and skin and marinated it for about 2 hours before baking. I did chicken out only used half the cayenne as I had a spicy curry seasoning. I also used half butter and half olive oil and instead of honey used Splenda for diabetic reasons.

good recipe - the curry balanced nicely with the honey mustard. I only marinated the chicken in the sauce for about 2 hours, rather then the recommended 4, and it still had loads of flavor.

Sooo yummy!

I used frozen chicken breast, cut it up, threw everything in a skillet, cooked it on low - perfection over rice!

used regular yellow mustdard, added turmeric, black pepper, extra cayanne.

**curry, and turmic are cancer fighters and black pepper helps your body digest it, this recipe has all three!**

Great basis for an easy honey mustard chicken!  I used olive oil instead of butter to up the health value.  And I've added and varied the pepper used to change the spice value. And I use spicy brown mustard rather than Dijon...also to add more spice. I've gotten to where I don't even measure the items used and just go with what I'm in the mood for (more curry or more pepper). And I've found I don't even have to marinate the chicken to have the flavor come out so this makes this dish even more quick in terms of preparation to oven to table. Serve with some couscous and salad and this makes for a simple, easy, healthy meal.

Absolutely delicious marinade (in fact, with the proportions changed and olive oil instead of butter, it makes a pretty killer salad dressing) but the cooking time seems out of wack.  My chicken took almost triple the amount of time to cook (2 breasts, skinless/boneless).  Still, the marinade is the star and not the cooking directions, so 5 stars all around :)

We loved this recipe! It was so easy and tasty. We did change a few things though:
1. I didnt marinate for four hours. 
2. I just made the sauce and pan seared my chicken on the stove then added the sauce and simmered for 10 minutes in the sauce. 

Very yummy!!

Very easy and tasty, though a little on the sweet side for my taste. I will decease the honey and butter in the future, but that's because I'm Indian and used to spicy curry. Great recipe and probably a good introduction to curry for those who are a little wary.  Update 4/27/09:  Made this for a potluck and it received rave reviews & requests for the recipe.  I doubled all the sauce ingredients except the butter and used enough chicken tenders to fill a 8 x 12 pan without overlapping too much.  I just can't give it a 5 because it falls flat to my tastebuds, but that's just me.  Try this--doubt you'll be disappointed.

Everyone absolutely loved this! Everything from the beautiful caramalized glaze to the sweet exotic taste made me feel like I was a fancy chef! I will definitely make this again. I might even try it with less butter and possibly coconut milk? Nothing but goood things can be said about this recipe.

Very tastey recipe.  I also reduced the amount of honey and butter to 1/4 cup.  Other people commented that 4 teaspoons of curry seemed too much.  I think that it depends on the type of curry powder you use.  I use red curry powder which is a little stronger than yellow curry powder and used 2 1/2 teaspoons.  I also took other's suggestions and added a pinch of cumin.  Nice touch.  I paired the chicken with Jeera Fried Rice (recipe on this site) and it was very good.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was my first recipe that I made from this site...not only was it easy to make but it was delicious! I, too, cut down on the butter and added water for the sauce. I'm not a fan of curry but I am now with this dish! This recipe is a keeper!

Yum!  Instead of butter I used Brummel & Brown spread and it still turned out great!  Will marinate it for 24 hours next time; 4 wasn't enough for the chicken to soak up the flavor.

Hubby practically licks his plate every time I make this!  I usually use skinless chicken thighs because they're more moist.  Makes a great dish with saffron rice, but be careful, and don't use white linens because it stains!  The flavor is excellent, this will be a recipe we make for years!

Extremely easy to make.  I love the fact that you  make it early in the day, avoiding the dinnertime rush.  Just pop it in the oven and it turns out delicious and tender. (I used 6 chicken breasts and there was plenty of sauce.)  My husband had two servings and even my 2 year old gobbled it up.

We really enjoyed this dish. You can definitely taste the curry, but it doesn't overwhelm the other flavors. I'm going to double the sauce the next time I make this.

Oh my gosh yum!!! We loved this! I did, however, follow the suggestions of others, which is why I only gave 4 stars. I reduced the amount of butter to 2 Tbsp., added 1/4 tsp each of mustard powder, sage, and nutmeg, and baked at 375 for 40 minutes with 20 minutes covered. Also, my husband HATES curry, so I omitted that altogether and we both still thought it was wonderful. I'm definitely going to be trying it with the curry at some point!

Delicious no doubt about it. Didn't change a thing except I grilled it after marinating over night and the left over sauce I boiled and spread over chicken before eating with a sprinkle of salt. Dang, allrecipes makes me look good!!

I made this tonight for the first time. I used 6 chicken breasts and pounded them to flatten out a bit. I doubled the marinade and kept it in the fridge for about 5 hours. I did follow the recommendation of another and I added some cayenne pepper. Cooked it on 375 covered for 10 minutes, then uncovered for 15 minutes. Perfect and truly delicious!

We used thighs and broiled them at the end, also used oil instead of butter to make it healthier.  Didn't care for it too much.

This was amazing! I added a big squirt of rooster sauce and 1/2t cayenne and butter. I boiled down the leftover marinade for 10 minutes to use as a dipping sauce. This is one of the best recipes I have found from this site!

I liked this.  Used bone in chicken thighs and did marinate for 4 hours.  I think I have some high-test curry powder so I only added 3 tsp and reduced the amount of butter.  Smelled great while baking and reheats well the next day.

Very good addition to the chicken rotation when we're in the mood for something different.  I didn't stray from the recipe (though was tempted based on some of the reviews) and was pleased with the results.  The only thing was I forgot to cover for the first 10 minutes so the sauce was VERY thick, I thinned with  a little chicken broth.  I served with white rice and steamed broccoli.  Next time I'd like to have some naan to mop up the sauce with.  It definitely reminds me of Indian food with all of that curry.  Mine was done before 45 minutes.  It was nice and tender.  I might want to try cutting the chicken into chunnks next time (kind of like chicken tikka masala).  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavour of the curry ( I am a BIG curry fan ) mixed with the honey and dijon was not a match made in heaven for me. Overall, it was just an alright meal. I served this with basmati rice and roasted potatoes.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  The chicken in tender and moist.  The curry is not overwhelming.

I let the chicken marinate a good 18 hours and baked for 1 hour.  Delicious! And save the extra sauce. It might look funny, but it tastes great.

I made this for dinner tonight.  It was tasty!  I served it with roasted sweet potatoes, which really helped even out the spiciness.  My husband and children all enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe, but it took 30 minutes to cook.  I kept it covered the first 20, then uncovered the last 10.  I'm sure my husband will make sure there are no leftovers tomorrow(he likes to have second dinner later in the evening, especially if dinner was good)!

I made a few changes to work with what I had- I used coconut oil instead of butter (a little less than 1/4 cup), I had bone in, skin on thighs that I removed the skin and used with bone in.  I let it sit in the fridge overnight and put in the crockpot at 130pm.  I set it at high for 1 hour and then low for about 3.5 hours and it was perfect!  Wonderful flavor and the meat fell off the bones.  I served over brown basmati rice with some of the juices from the crockpot.  definitely worth a try!  I wouldn't have thought to put these flavors together, thanks for a great recipe!

TOTALLY AMAZING - reading a lot of reviews I doubled curry - added a little cayenne and garlic powder . . . there was a LOT of sauce, that I marinated maybe three hours before cooking. Next time - marinate over night, as the sauce is - OH SO GOOD. Cooked roughly 6 lbs. - three boneless skinless breasts and 3 lbs. boneless skinless thighs in heavy aluminum foil. Cooked 350 for 30 minutes, covered. Uncovered, 20 minutes rearranged, then turned heat up 375 cooked another 20 or so minutes. There was A LOT of sauce, we used on top of rice. The leftovers - I added rice to the sauce with the few thighs left over - OH - in the morning the rice had absorbed much of the sauce - leftovers were better than first served. I am thinking the next time making the rice in the sauce during the baking process.

I followed the instructions, but at the end I broiled the chicken to make it brown on top. It was wonderful over rice.

Absolutely delicious!! I did increase the cooking time, but this was due to the size of the chicken breasts I used.  Next time I make it, I will likely cut back on the amount of butter, and may increase the spice. As it stands, this recipe offers a wonderful sweet and spicy taste.

Fabulous! I had 5 pretty large blsl chicken breasts so made 1 1/2 times the sauce & it was perfect! I baked 20 min. covered, 20 min. uncovered & my chicken was a tad dry/overcooked. I'll go for 30-35 min. next time.

I didnt care for this much at all. I'm not sure if I just cooked the chicken too long and it got dried out, or if maybe I'm just not a honey/mustard/curry kind of person. I made the marinade as directed except with only 1 tsp of butter and let the chicken marinate over night. I put them in a pan and baked for about 45 minutes @ 400 as I had pretty thick chicken breasts and I always end up with undercooked chicken. The breasts were tender but the flavor was just so-so for me and my husband. I was glad we tried it though as we have never done anything like this.

Very tasty! My boyfriend loved this recipe! I followed the recipe as stated, cooked the chicken in the sauce, and served sauce over rice. I will definitely make this again. The only thing I will do differently next time is cook the chicken on the grill.

This was excellent!! Very easy with only 6 ingrediants. This is one I  will keep in my recipe box. I did not modify to a lower calorie version but I will next time. My hubby is a beef and potatos guy and he even said to keep this! I made him a baked potato but I also made a quinoa salad with red onion, carrots, mandarin oranges, lime and cilantro as a side dish. This is a recipe that I'll keep for a dinner party.

I've made this dish for my husband and me, and have made it for several families in my M.O.P.S. group when they brought a new baby home.  The only changes I make are to add 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp sage to the mixture (per another reviewer's suggestion).  Everyone I've prepared it for LOVES it, and asks me for the recipe.  It's already so quick and easy, but I make several batches of it and keep it on hand in my freezer for those busy times when I don't want to think about what to cook.

This was so easy and even my picky friend to does not like honey mustard loved this. I used skin on bone in chicken thighs.  Cooked it for 30 min, skin side down then flipped for the last 30 min.  Broiled at the end to get golden brown.  I doubled the sauce because I had 8 pieces.  I used 6 tsp of curry.  I will use the full 8 next time.

My family loved this recipe.  I didn't have time to marinate the chicken.  I just cooked the chicken in the oven with the sauce poured over the chicken.  I misread the curry powder and used 4 T instead of 4 t.  It was awesome!  I paired this with Indian Saffron Rice and Parmesan Asparagus both from this site.

We have a Gluten-egg-dairy free family, and we're avoiding soy for health reasons. This recipe covers all that, AND it tastes fabulous!! We had a quinoa pilaf along side and it was a wonderful meal. Thank you for this recipe!!

This was very easy.  However even cooking it with my convection oven, it needed longer cooking time. I also increased the temp the last few minutes to give it a nice glaze.  The sauce was good as extra dip for the chicken.  Will make this again!  Also I used a yogurt based margarine and not as much as was called for.

Great recipe! I changed the honey to maple syrup and served it over cooked quinoa with a side of Beets and Greens (also from Allrecipes). I topped it off with a nice Chardonay as suggested. Wonderful meal! I will definitely make this recipe again!

My family really liked the flavoring.  I'll will say though that I had diced the chicken and pan browned it, then added all the ingredients and cooked it.  While not the exact recipe, the ingredients were the same and the flavor was very good.  Even the kids loved it. I did reduce the butter to 3 tbs

This was good. I was worried about it being too sweet, but it was not. We will make this again.

Liked this even more the 2nd time. However, I think that you could (and should) add more chicken for the amount of marinade it makes. And I forgot to marinade it before hand--just poured on the marinade and put in the over and it was still very flavorful.

This really is a great recipe!  I modify it by doubling the sauce but use 1/2 the butter and bake it with baby carrots and onion wedges.  I bake it for longer than the recipe calls for.  Then serve with rice.  The extra sauce is great over the rice.  Enjoy!

This has long been one of my favorite dishes, but my mom could never remember how much of each item to add when I wanted to learn it. We used to make this in a skillet instead of a pan, but I was very pleased with the results. Personal note: team up with some rice or mashed potatoes for a big hit. :D

This chicken does turn out very moist, but it was a little sweet for me. I think the honey was a little overpowering, and it really doesn't need more than 2 TBS of butter.

This was a tasty and easy to prepare recipe.  Everyone loved it, including my 3 year old.  I only had half of the honey required for the recipe, so I made up the difference with maple syrup.

This was ok. My chicken looked nothing like all the pretty pictures on here, which makes me believe they have adapted the recipe. Tastes a lot like honey mustard chicken with a bit of curry after taste. Will not be making this one again.

This was really good. I made fried potatoes as a side and the sauce from the chicken gave the potatoes a sweet potato flavor. Very easy and delicious recipe.

I also cut down the butter; I stuck with just a tablespoon, and it served just fine as the emulsifier.  I used local, raw honey and dijon and a hot madras curry powder.  It was tremendously simple.  It came out delicious.  The chicken was tender and moist, and I had made enough extra sauce that everyone was rubbing their fingerling potatoes in it.  I'll definitely make it again.

Really good - my husband even liked it, and he tends not to like sweetish main courses.  Don't be alarmed by the 4 tsps of curry powder; it's necessary to cut the sweetness of all that honey, and isn't overwhelming at all.  I think next time I might try browning the breasts first or putting them on the grill, as some others did; baked, they were very moist, but unappealingly pale.  Still, very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty tasty although next time I think I would brown the breasts in a frying pan - they were cooked after half an hour but there was so much sauce in the pan that they didn't brown, rather they boiled. The flavour was good, I decreased the butter like most other reviewers. With a few tweaks I would make this again!

This was my first venture into cooking with curry, was surprized that I liked it!!  I like that this recipe incorporated the honey mustard.  Made some fried rice with coconut to serve with it.  Was very quick to throw together in the AM so the hubby could just pop it into the oven.

Made this for dinner last night--very simple to prepare, had all of the ingredients on hand! It was delicious. I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and a dash of crushed red pepper in place of the cayenne. The extra sauce was wonderful over rice. I also sprinkled some toasted pecans on the chicken before serving. Definitely will be making this again!

This was delicious! The only problem I had was with the conversion I ended up putting a little too much cayenne pepper.Also I used half Dijon and half whole grain mustard for some fun texture!

I have made another honey mustard recipe from this site, but I found that the amounts were better as written in this recipe.  I did cook the chicken for about 20 minutes covered and then 30 minutes uncovered.  I added a bit of salt to the sauce and didn't have time to marinate the chicken in it, but it still tasted great!

I have the pickiest hubbs ever & he really liked this dish. Actually, my son chose this from the Allrecipes cookbook I received in the mail & HE made it for us, exactly as written.  He does suggest that if you like your food spicier to increase the cayenne pepper & curry, but made as is was perfect for me & hubbs.  LOVED this dish!!

This was fabulous and so easy.  I made it for 12 people at a church meeting and everyone raved.  I hated to admit how little work I did.  I served it with jasmine rice -- and I added some star anise, cardamom, whole cloves, and whole allspice to the rice while it was cooking.  It was delicious.

I have to admit that I forgot to print off the recipe and therefore didn't have access to it while I was making this. I remembered the ingredients but just eyeballed the amounts and it was delicious! I probably ended up with more curry than the recipe called for but that was perfectly fine with me. I'd recommend that others do the same in terms of not necessarily following the amounts exactly, just go with what you know will appeal to you. A delicious combination of ingredients!

Delicious!  Usually, I hate eating the same food repeatedly, and never really finish leftovers.  With this dish, I wish there were more leftovers!!  I used a dash of chili powder instead of cayenne pepper, but it was still scrumptious!

I made this last night without the 4 hour marinade time, in something closer to a dutch oven than a baking dish. It turned out great! This is the first time I've ever cooked chicken and it wasn't dry or chalky.    The marinade/sauce is a little sweet for me, though, so I squeezed a lime over it on my plate. I also doubled the sauce and threw in some frozen vegetables (make sure they are covered in the sauce, too). The marinade goes from a pasty consistency to a more liquid one after cooking, so all that leftover sauce is great to pour over the rice.  Since my big soup pot had more head space than a baking dish, I had to leave it covered for about 20 minutes total to get the sauce to start bubbling up. Then, I left it uncovered for another 20 minutes. Next time, I'll definitely try to marinate it over night to get the chicken to be more tender & juicy.

I made this exactly as written. It wasn't as good as I had hoped. The ingredients sounded excellent together. I normally make either a Honey-mustard style chicken or a curried chicken..but this recipe seemed to be both! The chicken lacked color & the flavor wasn't as strong as I had hoped.

Incredible flavor and SO EASY! I ran out of Curry powder and used Garam Masala in it's place, and will probably make it that way again. I doubled all of the sauce ingrd's so we'd have enough to serve over rice, but didn't double the butter.

This was a good easy recipe.  It was user friendly because it only contained ingrediants that I normally have on hand.  I made no changes to the recipe.  Served it with rice and sweet baby peas, easy and quick, and good.

My husband and daughter both said this was 5 stars. It is easy to put together and smells great when cooking. It did take slightly longer than 20 minutes to cook, but that is probably due to the thickness of the chicken breasts I used. thanks!

I cooked this for my boyfriend and his friends and they absolutely loved it! All I had were drumsticks so I used those instead of chicken breast. I only used 1/3 of the butter called for and subbed olive oil for the rest. I had extra sauce (because I tripled the amount based on all of the chicken I had) and used it to marinate a salmon filet. I let it marinade for the same amount as the chicken, about 4 hours, and then baked it uncovered. It was DELCIOUS! Who would have thought curried honey mustard salmon?

A delicious blend of flavours.  Will definitely cook again. I only used 2 tablespoons of butter, and substituted the rest for olive oil. I added 10 minutes to the cooking time and it turned out great. The husband loved it!

I decide how good the meal is I cook each night by if my husband carries leftovers to work... he didn't hesitate to take this (: I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except I did not measure everything out; I just kinda guessed. I did season my chicken with season salt, added black pepper on top of everything, used some butter and some olive oil, and used a jalepeno pepper instead. The meal was still delicious! Will definately make again!!!

This is the best curry I've had, ever.   I cut the chicken into small bite-size pieces (makes it more flavorful). I also doubled the recipe. I added a teaspoon of cumin, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and a sprinkling of ground coriander.  This is a family favorite-it's been requested for the second time this week!Thanks!

Excellent!!!!!! This is a keeper.  I followed everyone's suggestion and used some olive oil in place of the butter and doubled the recipe so we could put it on the rice; did not have any cayenne pepper but it was delicious without it and still had a nice "kick"

This is the first time I have ever had anything with curry. I would not make it again, the leftovers sat in the fridge until I begged my bf to eat them. I couldn't stomach it again myself. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is the benefit of the doubt that if I liked curry this would be a good recipe... maybe??

This is a nice and easy recipe that the whole family would love!! Even with the picky eaters in my family they could not with stand this combination of sweet and spicy flavors that truly evens itself out after cooking. Cut the use of butter down and replace it with olive oil works great, I marinaded it overnight and it was just fine, but then I also love the curry flavor in foods.

I'm giving this 5 stars because my whole family loved it!! My ten year old son is very finicky and he ate this happily. My eleven year old son ate two pieces and my husband liked it too. This has a strong flavor after marinading for 5 hours. I used thin cut boneless chicken breasts so the flavor really got in. My curry powder already had some cayenne mixed in so I didn't add extra heat. The color on this is really pretty too!

Just made this for dinner today and it is VERY tasty!  The chicken was moist and simply tender.  I may have added too much honey, which made the sauce a little too sweet.  It took about 30 minutes for the chicken to be done instead of the 20 minutes that the recipe stated.  I will definitely make this again!

4 stars b/c it's EASY, QUICK, & requires MINIMAL INGREDIENTS--- most of which you can find in your pantry everyday. I followed the recipe as is (marinating overnight) except using 4 chicken breasts.  It turned out well for a quick & easy meal. I am not an experienced cook so this was a good easy one for me. The chicken was juicy and flavorful.   I will make it again but next time (as others mentioned) I will not use as much butter.  After baking, the butter/oils separated from the honey mustard sauce quite a bit so it became rather greasy looking (it did not taste greasy at all).  It was not terrible but I prefer less oil. I served it with white rice and steamed plain green beans.  It was good.  I think peas would be even better.

This is one of my favorite recipes when made with yellow mustard (vs. dijon).  It could have been the brand of dijon mustard, or curry powder that I used -- who knows, but this is the first time in my life that I had to get pizza delivery instead of eating what I made.  I'm so sad.

Really good recipe. I made it as the directions stated and marinated the chicken overnight- loved it! I served it with rice mixed with cilantro.

This was a good recipe. I made it exactly as stated however I doubled it and cooked in the crock pot. Everyone's taste is different but I thought it was a little too much curry. Next time I make it I will cut down the curry and I am sure it would be a five! Thanks for sharing.

Not bad, it definitely needs more curry and probably need to season the chicken before marinating.

We found this to be just ok...I think as a chicken for topping a sald, it would be great...As a dinner item, we weren't overly impressed.

Absolutely awesome!  Next time I will put a little less butter and honey.  I did put a little more cayenne and curry and used a hot but delicious mustard from France.  Also added some fresh veggies.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This recipe is excellent. I marinated the chicken in the same baking pan that I cooked it in, leaving extra sauce to mix with the brown rice I made for it. Delicious.

This is one of the top recipies I've ever tried from this site (and I've tried a whole bunch).  My mouth, belly, and boyfriend are all very very happy.  Feel free to use more curry (I probably almost doubled it).  Absolutely no need to use butter.  Definitely double the sauce to use as a gravy over meat and rice.  Made with steamed asparagus.  OMGNOM!

Very yummy!  I used a spicy mango chutney and it had real kick....use a sweet mango chutney and it would be not so spicy....my whole family loved it.  I am going to try using the really skinny egg noodles next time.

I have made this twice and have loved it both times. I decreased the butter, as recommended and used some yellow mustard because we didn't have enough dijon. The best thing is that everyone in the family asked for more-including my 3 year old.

This was okay -- the curry flavor didn't come through as strongly as I would have liked. The pan was a mess after baking, which always makes a recipe less enjoyable for me. I think it was better when I sliced the leftovers and served it in a salad. My brother scarfed up the remaining leftovers and he enjoyed it more than our family did.

I have made this two times now and my husband and I both really like it. The only thing I didn't like about it was that we had leftovers and my husband ate it the very next day and said he didn't like it at all. He wasn't specific, but he is the leftover king most of the time so I don't know why he didn't like this?! Anyway, it is a great recipe and we will have again, but I will have to make only what we will eat since I hate wasting food...if not for that, I would give it 5 stars for sure.

I like curry, I like honey, I like mustard, I like chicken.... this was not very good.  While it wasn't inedible, it had a pungent flavor that didn't work for us. When you consider the calorie content of butter vs. sour cream I think I'll stick wtih my creamy honey mustard chicken recipe.  I couldn't help but think this recipe was a waste of very expensive organic free range chicken breasts.

I used oil in place of butter, and decreased it to 3 T.  I butterflied the breasts, then marinated then grilled.  these were satisfactory.  I love curry, but this was nothing to write home about.  They were healthy, standard fare but not exciting.

I substituted the chicken for a package of extra firm tofu (cut in bite size pieces).  Make sure to still marinate; however, rather than baking it in the oven I stir fryed it in a pan for a few minutes until seared and golden on each side.  Threw in some asian veggies!  Awesome, quick/easy/delicious!

The first time I made this recipe I didn't care for it. I attempted it again and it was wonderful!! Made it when we had guests over(what was I thinking, since I didn't like the first time)It is always requested for dinner now. SO simply and fast. I did make one change that some may like to try. I used the Jack Daniels hickory smoke mustard. It gives a wonderful flavor. THANKS!!

I'm not usually a big fan of honey mustard anything...but I do love curry, so I decided to give it a try.  What a find!  So quick, easy and delicious - my chicken turned out moist and tender (even tho I did increase the cooking time by 10 minutes afer checking and seeing pink) and the flavor reminded me of the chicken curry dishes found in Chinese restaurants.  Served it over jasmine rice and peas.  This is definately a keeper!

Love the recipe, I dunno why but I tried to post a review for this recipe and it didn't show up. Anyways I love it but I will reduce the honey and leave the rest so the chicken ain't so sweet but other then that I LOVE IT , good with some rice and veggie.

I really enjoyed this unique, slightly spicy flavor, hot out of the oven.  My husband, however, was not wowed by it until he had leftovers for lunch the next day.  Good stuff - I will make it again.

My boyfriend really liked this recipe, I can't say I cared for it much. It was really messy (use foil) and the curry gave the sauce a gritty texture (could be the brand). I love curry and honey and mustard, I'm not sure what happened!

Very nice! I actually forgot to do prep for the dish so I ended up just stirring together the honey, mustard, curry powder and then just drizzled about 2 TBL of olive oil into it. I flipped the chicken over several time to make sure they were coated and popped the whole thing in the oven. Total time from start to finish was only 30 minutes and it tasted great...I can't imagine how much more depth the flavors will have when I remember to marinade it first! Thanks!

this chicken is amazing.  so simple and yet so good.  i could barely stop myself from licking the plate clean.  i had one chicken breast left over so i just cut it up into bite size pieces (to shorten the cooking time). i didn't have time to marinate at all so i just put the chicken pieces in a bowl with the sauce and coated it and pan fried for about 8 minutes, stirring once in a while.  i can only imagine how good it'll taste if marinated overnight and maybe even using chicken thighs next time.  also i just realized i didn't even follow the directions .. i didn't use the butter in the marinade but melted it in the pan and then poured the chicken in and cooked.  it was still good!

This was fairly good.  The sauce was tasty, but I thought it was a little too saucy and covered the taste of the chicken a bit too much for my taste.

Definitely less butter, I usually try to marinate it at least a little bit before, If I don't get a chance to, I make sure it stays in the oven for a long time, that way it really browns and caramelizes....it tastes a lot better once it has browned a bit....

This was pretty good.  I made a mistake and misread the amount of curry, so it was quite overpowering!  Other than that I used tenderloins instead of breasts.  I would be willing to try this recipe again with less curry powder!

This was an amazing flavor , a little too sweet for my husband's taste but I thought it was  perfect. The only thing I added was a whole onion and I'm glad I did , it gave a great flavor if you like onion.I also did not use butter, only peanut oil. My chicken did not turn out as the picture did with the crust , mine was very saucy but perfect for dipping indian naan bread into. I plan on trying this with tofu next time.Thank you!

This recipe is delicious! I really like the sweetness combined with the curry. I didn't have any Dijon mustard so I used regular yellow mustard. It still came out excellent! I served it over rice as others have done.

Great curry taste, quick and easy, smells lovely and fragrant! I used my pyrex with the lid. Turned out just great. In my opinion, you could halve the sauce and still have enough, and reduce the butter too. I melted the butter in a saucepan and quickly sauteed a little minced garlic in it, then continued with the recipe as is. Thanks!

We weren't big fans of this. And based upon all the other wonderful reviews, I assume that we must not like curry. Maybe it is something that you have to acquire a taste for, I don't know, but I don't think that we'll be making this again. Sorry.

Made this for my step-daughter's birthday as well as regular brined/baked chicken, her favorite. I miss judged and should have made only this dish.  It was incredible!!  We used a spicy mustard and it worked out great.I will make double the sauce to eat on rice. Regular requests for it again!!

This was really good. However, I cut out the butter completely and just poured a bit of olive oil into the pan before adding the chicken and marinade. The marinade has such a great flavour that you don't miss the butter at all. I used half Dijon and half mustard with seeds. I also dredged the chicken in whole wheat flour before covering it with the sauce and baking it, which thickened the sauce quite nicely.

YUCK-O!!!! This turned out sooo badly and i followed the recipe exactly. The chicken was juicy (but thats about it), the combination of the marinade was unpleasant, even washing the pan later was not fun. I will not make this agin.

Great recipe. Changes I made: 1/4 cup butter, 1/3 cup plain mustard (because I didn't have dijon), 2 teaspoons madras curry powder, and omitted the ground cayenne pepper (because I didn't have it). Also, I cut up the chicken into bite-sized pieces so it cooked faster. I mopped up the sauce with garlic naan - amazing! I will try next time adding cayenne pepper and using dijon mustard.

I made this last night as I was pressed for time. I only marinated for 30 minutes and I used boneless thighs.
My husband LOVED it- calling it amazing!
The curry with the mustard is a nice combo. Next time I will use less butter and more curry!

Wonderful! I love the curry flavor. I served it with white rice and put the juice of the chicken over the rice when serving. Awesome flavors.  We had fresh tomatoes with it for a great meal.

Great recipe! Loved the strong taste of honey mustard + curry.  I used turkey instead of chicken and made in in the pan rather then baking in the oven and turned out fine. Thanks!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! I made this for dinner for me, my mom, dad, sister, and grandparents. My whole famliy oculdn't stop raving about it. I left out the cayenne for my younger sister's sake but it would be even better with the pepper. The way I know this recipe for sure is a great recipe is that my grandma asked for the recipe after dinner and has decided to replace her own chicken recipe she makes every sunday for sunday dinner (for the past 20 years or so) with this recipe. That's an amazing compliment in my book!
Thanks!

I've been looking for a good mustard chicken recipe for a long time.  Everytime I tried a recipe it was too mustardy but this was just perfect.  I'm sticking with this one.

It was really good I only marinated for an 1 1/2 hours. I found the recipe a little to late. This recipe was great. I expected a little more kick with the cayenne pepper. Guess I didn't put enought in. The whole family including the three year old ate his plate clean. I had leftovers and shredded the chicken with sauce in a frying pan put it over lettuce with cucumbers and it was excellent.

mid-preperation of this meal, i was skeptical because the aroma was...well, different...almost bad smelling.  but the chicken itself, much to my surprise, turned out really delicious!  i couldn't eat a whole lot of it though because it is awefully rich, so i would suggest serving smaller pieces.  we paired it with steamed broccoli and a date and walnut wild rice dish.  YUMMMM!!

This was very yummy!  I had no cayenne pepper, so I used 1/4 t red pepper flakes.  I did cut the butter to 3 T and added a dash of cumin as suggested by others.  This was great over a bed of rice with steamed brocolli.  It had lovely taste combinations, with the honey weighing down the heat nicely.

I am not a big fan of curry, but I loved this recipe.  I did add a bit more cayenne as I like it real spicy.  I always seem to get sick of the taste of chicken breasts and can never eat the whole thing, but with this recipe I almost ate 2.  The sauce would be good with rice also.

not sure what all the fuss is about but this was very odd and i like trying different things. it was WAY too sweet and got worse as my partner and i ate it (the buildup of too much sweetness). 
it's definitely different, but not our preference.

This was a very tasty dish! I didn't have time to marinate it and it still came out great! Next time I will try & plan ahead a little and marinate it so that yummy flavor soaks up in the chicken. We just had this last week & plan to have it again this week! My little ones loved it too!

Very yummy recipe, and soooooooo easy.  I added cumin like some other people suggested, and doubled the cayenne.  Had to cook it for 40 minutes in order to cook it thoroughly.  Amazing flavor.  A definite keeper!!

Delicious!  I decreased the butter to 2 to 3 tablespoons and marinated this for about three hours. It was so good!  I'll definitely make it again.  (As a few others mentioned, the chicken needed to cook longer than the recipe called for.) My husband loved it, too.

I cooked this for happy hour at my bar using chicken thighs and served it over plain rice with cornbread on the side.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used chili powder instead, added mustard powder and some chinese five spice.  I also cut back on the butter and added olive oil like some of the other reviewers. Everyone raved about it, even the people who don't normally like curry. The sauce was very aromatic and flavorful, with a nice balance between the heat of the curry and the sweetness of the honey.  Everyone asked me to make it again soon!  Thank you Priscilla.

The marinade was delicious.  I didn't have any chicken breasts, so I used this on chicken wings and broiled them for 15 minutes until they were brown. They came out very moist and flavorful. Also, I cut down the fat to 2tbs of olive oil because I kept the skin on.

This was great! just a little bit too greasy - I think I'll take the advice from someone and use some olive oil and 1/2 the butter. I didn't add as much curry as I have a 2 year old - she ate every last bite. Thanks for the recipe!

We love curry and this was wonderful.  I did not have enough honey when I prepared it so I added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  It was great!  I also added extra cayenne pepper to make it a little spicier.  My husband loved it.

What an awesome recipe! My husband loved it and so did I. We served it with couscous and steamed asparagus. I marinated it overnight, cooked it ahead and stored it in the refrigerator. To heat it up, I heated the chicken breasts and juice in a skillet, which gave it a beautiful brown glazed look and a yummy flavor. This is a keeper.

This chicken was ok nothing to die for. It was rejected by my picky 8 year old.   Would probably be good as a sandwich with a little monteray jack cheese.

This was good. I had a large chicken breast so I sliced it half way through diagonally so it would take the marinade better; I only had 4 hours to marinate it. I did add salt to cut the bitter taste of the curry powder as someone else suggested; otherwise follow recipe as directed. I will make this again only marinate longer. Served with "Indian Rice Pilaf" also from this site.

Delicious! We made some vegetable rice to eat with the sweet tender chicken and it was an instant favourite. We didn't have any Dijon so we just used a premixed honey mustard.

This chicken was delicious with one main adaptation.  I used 3 TBS of butter instead 1/3 a cup and it turned out great.  I used skinless chicken thighs (enough to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan) and marinaded them for about 24 hours.  The flavor is slightly sweet with the slightest hint of heat at the very end.  SOOO easy to make and I'll definitely make again.

This was great! Followed the recipe exactly.    I didn’t even marinate it four hours, it probably would have been even better. Simple and I had all the ingredients on hand.

My whole family likes this recipe,  including my 5 & 7 year old boys.  It is delicious on the grill and in the slow cooker.  I also used this marinade for salmon and it came out great!

The flavour is great, thanks to marinating for 24 hours. All I changed was to pound the chicken breasts to a more consistent thickness, sprinkle garlic powder on the breasts, and decreased the butter by about half. I will make this again, my go-to honey mustard recipe!

I use olive oil instead of butter, and just tried a can of pineapple instead of honey.  Soooooo good!
We serve with rice and peas.  I'm trying to figure out some other ways to add more veggies...

We love West Indian curry in particular so we love this recipe.  I tripled the recipe in order to have plenty of the sauce for rice and was generous with the curry.  Asparagus and spinach salad as sides make for a pretty plate. I will definitely make this again!

This was too sweet for my taste, and I even halved the amount of honey used as I felt the recipe amount was a lot.  I will make it again, and reduce the amount of honey even more as I love curry.

I will add this to Family Favorites. It was very moist and flavorful. I combined the suggestions in the reviews to form a modified recipe which used about 2 tablespoons of curry powder (was still mild), using slightly less honey (about 1/4 cup) and about 1/2 or 3/4 cup of Dijon mustard. Regarding the cooking time, with my medium thick chicken breasts--I cooked it for about 35-40 minutes at 375 degrees (the first 10-15 were covered with foil). Happy Baking!

Did on stove top, no time to marinade.  Used equal parts dijon mustard and honey (1/2 cup each) with the 4 t. Penzey's curry powder and a sprinkle of homemade red pepper.  Sauteed chicken with garlic powder and black pepper in butter and mild olive oil. Wonderful aroma as it cooked!

I cut the butter in half and replaced it with olive oil the second time I made it. I think the chicken was even a little more tender than it was with the butter.

Very easy to make and the chicken came out beautiful. The flavor went all the way through some very thick breasts and was juicy and delicious. Will 100% be making this dish again.

I made this recipe exactly as is, and it wasn’t bad at all. There definitely wasn’t any “pouring” going on with the honey-mustard mixture as is was more like a really sticky rub; the stickiness also made it incredibly difficult to spread nicely and evenly over the chicken, as well as getting the mixture to actually stay where you need it to be! Apart from being a pain in my rear end to make, it did taste good and my 2 year old ate it and my husband said it was “ok” (typical husband “compliment”, am I right, ladies?) so I guess it was an overall success.

Made this a lot!!! Went by recipe to the T. Also cut butter down. Both are GREAT!!! Curry adds awesome flavor. Can use less butter, still awesome chicken. Did with bone in thighs and just cooked for about 40 min. Tried with a little garlic, THE BEST!!! Thank you for a WONDERFUL recipe!!

I made the recipe as stated.  First it took far longer than 20 minutes to cook.  I figured as much and started early.... glad I listened to my instincts.  Second - the flavour was just sweet & bland.  We all love curry... and my son loves sweet but right away he said it was odd tasting.  He was right.  Saving grace - we added Bragg's (soy-type sauce) to our servings.  The saltiness countered the sweetness and after that it was quite enjoyable.  I likely will not make again.

Only change I make is swapping oil for the butter as I do with most recipes. I make this weekly. Its one of my favorites. Goes great with a brown rice, mushroom and spinach mixture. Great for dieting and so tasty and boyfriend loves it too!

This was an amazing recipe. It was very delicious. The curry compliments the honey and dijon mustard perfectly. The cayenne adds a nice kick as well. The cook time seemed a little short to me. I cooked covered for 20 minutes, then uncovered 20 minutes. Unfortunately, my wife isn't a big fan of mustard, otherwise, I'd be making this every week.

Good flavor, used 1/2 of the butter listed, make in the pan as listed or it's difficult to get out of a plastic bag.  My favorite honey mustard chicken is still a grilled version.

It was just ok....  I had to cook for much longer than recommended, and honestly, it just didn't seem to have as much flavor as I'd hoped or expected.

I never thought I liked curry but I’m trying to broaden my interests, and this recipe pretty much shocked me with how easy and delicious it turned out.  The second time I made it, I used chicken thighs and I threw in a can of chickpeas.  It was really good too.  Goes well with basmati rice and steamed vegetables.

I used boneless skinless thighs and prepared mustard.  Loved it!    I used 8 thighs and left the amount of sauce the same. I marinated the night before and baked the whole time uncovered for a bit shorter.  When I make it next time, I'll serve it with the sauce from the pan and rice to sop up the sauce.

Oh so delicious. The working womans time management strategy is... throw this whole recipe in the crock pot and cook for 4 hours. The sauce is absolutely awesome. The best of the best in flavor. 
I didn't have any honey or corn syrup so I used 1/4 cup brown sugar. I went back to read the suggestions and will make many varieties of this. My next plan is to add the bag of frozen oriental vegetables and to add curry.

Made this last night and we both enjoyed it!   Great mid-week meal, served with forbidden black rice and roasted sweet potatoes.   Heated the marinade for 2 min. in microwave and poured over chicken and finished with toasted pecans.

Very good.  Based on others reviews, reduced butter to 2 Tbs, used half dijon and half brown mustard.  Sprinkled both sides of chicken with seasoning salt and pepper before adding to pan.  Let marinade on counter top for 1-1/2 hours.  Did not cover while baking and baked for 45 minutes (forgot to set timer).  Turned out great.  Only had 2 large chicken breasts and the amount of sauce was just right...enough to spoon over some rice (used recipe for 4 servings).  Will make again, maybe cook 5 minutes less and maybe 1 tsp. less curry powder.

Loved it, and would definitely make it again. I doubled the mustard, honey and used 6tsp of curry powder instead of 4. So there's would be enough sauce for the rice. Delicious!

I loved this chicken recipe! I made it exactly as written, except I added a few extra dashes of cayenne pepper since I wanted a little more zing to counter the honey. I put chicken and marinade in a freezer bag and let it marinate for 24-hours. I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes covered, then another 10 uncovered. When I make it again, I will add extra curry since I love curry flavor. I served it with basmati rice and green beans and used some of the (cooked) marinade on the rice. Super easy and super good!

I've made something like this years ago but lost the recipe. This is very very close to that one. It was a huge hit with my family, who had all forgotten it. I've made it twice in the last two weeks. The first time I didn't leave it to marinate in the fridge like the instructions here say--I was looking for a last minute idea for chicken & didn't have time and besides I knew from the lost recipe that it would turn out all right without that.  I'm making it again tonight--it's in the oven now--and did leave it in the fridge a while first, so we'll see if it makes much difference. Anyway, it's super easy & you can totally skip leaving it in the fridge for hours if you don't have the time for that, it turns out fine.

Used boneless skinless chicken breast. A lot of moisture leaves the chicken breast making the dish "watery."  So, I cooked the plain chicken in the pressure cooker until cooked all the way through and poured the liquid off that cooked out of the chicken. The chicken was then tender and I just tore it in chunks and dumped the "marinade" over it as a sauce instead. (Made the marinade exactly as recipe is written.) It was so addictive, have 3 little ones and a hubby and there wasn't anything left. We served with brown rice and peas, which made a great combo.

Very good but a little too sweet for our taste.  Will be making again but next time will cut down on the honey by about 1/3 and increase the mustard to 1/3 cup.

Great marinade recipe!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts and coarse grain mustard and spicy brown instead of Dijon bc we didn't have any.  I also substituted EVOO instead of melted butter and added about a teaspoon of dried cilantro.  I think next time I will cut the honey down to 1/4 cup bc it was a little sweeter than I prefer.  All in all this is delicious served with quinoa and steamed vegetables.

Very good, my husband and I enjoyed it. I added less honey after reading the reviews and I'm glad I did. I cooked the chicken in the marinade and I wish I had made more because the sauce was tasty with rice!

It is a rare day when my son tries something new and says that he "loved it"!  This was one of those times. The recipe seemed too simple to be so good!  Like some of the others here, I cut back a little bit on the butter (but not too much). I used honey from one of our local farms and was generous with the curry.  Served it with rice and fresh broccoli. A new family favorite!

I put this glaze on a whole chicken and cooked it in the
crock pot.  Took some of the broth and added it to balsamic rice.  It was very tasty, but will reduce the butter next time

Just finished eating this. It was something different for us but will make again with changes. I'll reduce the butter a bit and also the Dijon. We are not big fans of Dijon and felt it over powered the curry. Not bad but for us a tad too much. All in all it was a nice change.

This is a great simple recipe. I just used the basic idea and used some sweet and spicy mustard, and didn't marinade it, but came out great. Nice for something different.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  Totally delicious, fast and easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe as written but only marinated the chicken for about 1 hour and it was still excellent!  I cooked the chicken 15 minutes per side, instead of the 10 minutes per side as written.  This is going into my rotation!  Thanks for posting.

So, I  made this with chicken thighs instead of breasts, and I didn't marinade before hand, I just made sure to get the sauce under the skin.  This was a glorious meal paired with the Quinoa with Chickpeas and Tomatoes recipe.  ITs important to note that thighs take much longer to cook.

Its ok, More sweet than spicy.  Just for my own taste:  Use 1/4 cup of honey instead of 1/3.  Use a generous pinch of cayenne for the extra heat.  After 10 minutes remove lid/cover and cook for an additional 20 minutes Serve with Basmati rice

Loved this.  I didn't make any changes.  However, I didn't have enough Madras Hot Curry so I used half Madras Hot and half regular curry.  Next time I make it, I will make sure to use all Madras Hot.  For the "pinch" of cayenne, I used about a sixteenth of a teaspoon.  I'll double that next time if the honey is very floral.  One reviewer suggested using olive oil in lieu of the butter; I'll try that the next time I make this.  This recipe is a keeper.  I served it with sage walnut roasted carrots and risotto florentine.  This made for a good Valentine's Day dinner.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

This reheats wonderfully.  To serve the leftovers, I sliced the chicken and spooned sauce between each slice.  Next time I make this, I'll double the sauce.  I am also going to experiment with serving this on a bed of rice made with some of the marinade's flavors.  Yum.  How great would this taste with some garlic Naan!

Love, love, love this recipe!

I am torn about how to review this... my guests said they liked it; my husband said it was okay but told me not to make it again. I liked it... I actually preferred it without  extra marinade. I let it cook 15-20 mins covered and then uncovered for only about 8 minutes; I was worried about drying it out and with these time segments it came out perfectly tender and moist. Something different, but will definitely not be added to our regular rotation.

Yummmmm!  Omitted all the butter and added 2 TBSP of olive oil with a splash or two of apple cider vinegar to thin things out. Do let the chicken marinate for at least 8 hours.
Delicious!!! Many thanks for a simple tasty recipe.

This was great. I modified the ingredients based on some recommendations. I used 2 tsp butter, 1/4 cup honey, 1/2 cup spicy mustard, 2 TBSP ground spicy curry, pinch of cumin, and cayenne pepper. I also added a few mushrooms and onion. It was delish!

This recipe was spectacular. I followed the recipe almost exactly, just used a little less butter. Marinated the chicken all day. It was a big hit! Oldest asked if he could take it for lunch the next day at school.

I liked it but as per other reviewers they're right, there's too much butter in it.  Also, it bakes for about 45 minutes in oven.  Will make again but with some modifications.  Update:  made again and found it delicious but must remember to put even less butter.  Too much butter.  We ate it with spicy rice (Basmati rice with chicken stock instead of water and a bit of curry spice) and peas.  Very simple supper to make!

I liked this very much (but I like curry a lot!).  My family was not too keen on it...guess I will just make it for myself in the future.  It was a little spicier than I expected, so I might cut the curry down to 2 T. next time.

I didn't make any changes and I will make it again.  It was very moist and tasty, but I think it should stay in the oven for 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes.

doubled curry powder and doubled the recipe so that i had sauce left over for rice and veggies. I cut the chicken into peices and marinated it. i added a tablespoon of curry paste to the marinade i set aside and poured it over the chicken for the last minute of cooking. had chicken with rice and onions and green bell peppers. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful. The mustard added a nice kick that was mellowed out by the added curry paste in the reserved marinade. I made this a week ago and i'm making it again today. Soooo good and easy! :)

Very sweet and flavorful. I used real curry and so maybe a little less curry would help the taste and a dash of garlic and onion powder. I will be sure to make this again and again.

Great recipe! I made it for the first time yesterday. I just added a little extra curry for my liking. Next time I am going to add Thin sliced green pepper and thyme for a more savory taste! Nonetheless, the recipe is great just the way it is!! :)

I told my husband I was making this dish for dinner and he replied "I don't like spicy" I told him it wouldn't be and just try it. We both LOVED it. I've made it like 3 times now and I have noticed other reviews saying the butter is too much or the honey is too much for the amount of chicken. I think it really depends on the size of your pieces. I like a little extra sauce as we serve this with rice. This is such a great quick fix chicken dish. Thanks Priscilla

It was very very easy and very very delicious.  Instead of a "pinch" of cayenne pepper I added a teaspoon and a half because we like spicy things (next time I'll add two tsps of cayenne pepper). It marinated in the fridge for two nights instead of 4 hours because of a change of plan in our weekend.  Also, I had used left over chicken that we had soaked in milk and vinegar (homemade buttermilk) a week before for another recipe. For that recipe we had only used half of the buttermilk-soaked chicken, so we froze the rest of the chicken (minus the buttermilk).  Perhaps that helped too because the curry turned out so creamy and the chicken so tender.  I usually soak chicken breast in buttermilk before I bake them as crispy strips, and they always turn out tender.

While very simple to make, I wasn't impressed with this recipe.   I thought the mixture of honey, Dijon mustard would balance out the curry flavor, but it did not and the curry flavor was all my family tasted.

I simmer pork chops in this sauce for a couple hours after browning them and they're my family's favorite. I cut back a bit on the butter because a lot of fat comes off the chops. Otherwise, this is perfect and absolutely delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and my family didn't really care for it. It was sickly sweet. If I ever make it again, I would decrease the honey by 1/2. I'll stick with the honey mustard chicken recipe I usually use.

We enjoyed the recipe. The cooking time is off. We needed an additional 15 minutes. Also, the recipe is a bit heavy on the butter.

Outstanding, lip smacking stuff. I skipped the butter completely and used extra virgin olive oil instead and not too much at that. 
The family loved it. I'm doing this for our X'mas party! Thank you.

We didn't care for this. Made exactly as described, and the chicken was swimming in butter. It didn't have a distinctive flavor, pretty bland for a curry. I will keep looking.

This was really good - even my husband who doesn't like chicken devoured his. I made it as described, but I cut the breasts into thirds and basted it a couple of times during baking.

I made this as written and it was very good. I then tweaked it adding a little tumeric, garlic powder and hot pepper jelly. It's easy to prepare ahead and then pop in the oven when I am having big family gatherings and have a couple of main entrees.

This recipe is the BEST! I used coarse mustard, and extra Cayenne, and I'm glad I did. My chicken was a little larger, so cook time was about 35 minutes til juices ran clear. I also re-basted them at the 10 minute mark after removing the tin foil lid I made. So flavorful.

Delicious and EASY!
Love it.  Substituted a little bit of the butter for olive oil...didn't really measure how much. Baked for 15 min with cover and half hour without cover (45 min total).

This was a winner with my twins and I. I only tweaked a couple of things during the prep time. I poked my chicken THIGHS with a knife then I seasoned my chicken THIGHS with sea salt, cracked black pepper, and onion powder. For the honey mustard blend I excluded the cayenne pepper, I used 2 tablespoon of Dijon mustard and added dried parsley. I pour half of the honey mustard blend on top of the chicken and I let it sit for 15 min, I cooked then the chicken for 30 min turned chicken over and spooned most of the remaining honey mustard on the chicken than I let the chicken cook for 15 more min. The chicken was tender and very flavorful!!! def. keeping this recipe for the near future and so on.  btw.. I also used coconut oil instead of butter!!!

It should have better flavor. It's okay, but not great. Also, it took more like an hour for mine to cook.

Really good!  Based on the reviews, I substituted olive oil for 1/2 of the butter and used half of the amount of honey.  I'd probably bump up the curry next time (I got REALLY tired of curry in the 90's...nice to try again!)  I marinated the chicken for about 1/2 of a day.  We grilled ours and it turned out great!

amazing and simple! Used approximately 1/4 C olive oil instead of butter, regular "yellow" mustard, and a pinch of red peppers (from the Dominos Pizza packs, to be specific). Melted the honey mixed with the olive oil in the microwave in a small container and whisked in curry, pepper, and mustard. Had no problems with consistency. Threw it all in a bag and let it sit overnight. Simply delicious. No leftovers. A staple recipe.

Just tried this recipe, I made it with curry brown rice and some mixed vegetables. This was a big hit. I do agree though that the cook time needs to be adjusted. I added 5-10 minutes to each,covered and uncovered, still came out very moist and thoroughly cooked. I even cut the marinade time to 3 hours and still was wonderful. I used margarine this time but I think I will try coconut oil or olive oil next time to make it a bit healthier. A great simple recipe.

This marinade is very good, but I cut the butter out, and added about 1 TBSP of olive oil.  I grilled the chicken instead of cooking it in the oven.  It's a great compliment to Spicy English Seven-Layer Salad http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Spicy-English-Seven-Layer-Salad/Detail.aspx?soid=recs_recipe_seed.

Love this.   I made it twice.  First with some of the modifications.  It was good.  Next time I made this exactly as the receipe said and it was EXCELLENT.  Only thing I did different was take the chicken out of the sauce and put them on a sheet in the oven to brown them.  We used the sauce to pour over the chicken and side dish.  I made pasta.  This is a very easy dish and very yummy.  Even my son loved it.

This was good, but I liked it better as leftovers for lunch the next day. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours. Also doubled the curry and used more than a pinch of Cayenne. We like spicy! Cooking time ended up being about 45 minutes. Served with Basmati rice season with Cumin. I found the honey a little over powering straight out of the oven, but all the spices in the chicken and rice blended really well the next day. Yummy!

Only had horseradish mustard on hand so I used that instead of dijon. I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours and it turned out great. My boyfriend isn't a huge curry fan but he really liked it. I'll definitely make this again.

Recipe needs a tab bit more of curry.  Maybe next time 2 tablespoons of butter will work instead of 1/3 cup because my chicken was wading in the honey mustard butter.  Next time, I may omit and make it heart healthy with olive oil - remember that's important folks.  Also, I poked holes through the chicken t help the flavors permeate through - marinated for fours hours but feel it deserves an overnight marinade.

I did take someone's suggestion to put under the broiler to crisp and caramelize the skin.  Do this if you don't like soft chicken skin.  I cooked my leg quarters for about an hour on 350 degrees - just until the skin darkened. Serving with a side of plantains and veggies.

My family loves this...However, I don't marinate my chicken in this... I cook the chicken and chop it into bite size pieces..  I make the sauce and heat it on the stove, I pour it over the chicken and let it simmer for about a half and hour to hour...  Then I put the chicken over some rice.  My very picky family LOVE it...

The sauce for this tasted pretty good, but there was just way too much butter! I'm not sure if I'll ever be using this recipe again, but if I ever - I'll take into account to quarter the amount of butter!

This was not fantastic but still good.  Next time I will add some herbs or something fresh into the marinade, then grill and baste.  This has potential.  :)

Excellent flavor. It could be better if the sauce was a little thicker. I think I will add some cornstarch next time I make this. I WILL make this again.

I absolutely loved this recipe, I have never used curry before but was interested in trying it. This was the perfect recipe for a first try, not too many ingredients and very simple to prepare. I loved that it wasn't too sweet and not too spicy. And my 4 and 9 year old loved it! Definitely will make again!!!

I tried this with curry paste instead of curry power, and also replaced the chicken with Tofu. I added mushrooms and chopped onions and threw it all on a pan to cook...muah! Delicious!

This was a wonderful recipe I added some garlic to it only because I'm addicted to cooking with garlic. I didn't see this dish being spicy at all I put more than a pinch cayenne pepper but it wasn't spicy. I will add more next time I didn't chicken breast I used legs and thighs I feel they hold flavor better. I had this rice and green beans and a side cucumber and tomato salad.

i am NOT a huge curry fan but my fiance and I both enjoyed this... He actually requested that I make a few more chicken breasts next time so he can treat himself to thirds and leftovers. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of my error: I added more than a 'pinch' of cayenne..... although each bite was tender and delicious, it  was WAY too spicy.  Note to self: just a PINCH and no more.

This one will go into heavy rotation at our house. So easy and delicious! I threw in a thawed bag of peppers and onions and think it compromised the taste a bit. Won't do that again.

I followed the advise from other reviewers about cooking time. I baked it at 350F for 25 minutes and turn to broil on low for another 15 minutes. Turns out great, very moist and falvorful. perhaps next time I'll add more chili peppers to make it hotter. Thanks Pricilla for this great recipe!

Easy and yummy!  Took much longer to cook, I used a digital thermometer so nuch sure exactly how much longer.  I also added a little bit more curry powder, each teaspoon was heaping.  My husband loved it, definately a great recipe especially for days when I know I will have had a long day and don't want to do much prep, I can just marinade the night before.  Thanks for a simply and great recipe.

I used oil instead of butter and used dark meat as well as breasts. Found that it needs more cooking time--about 35 minutes overall. It was delicious! Marinating in the fridge for four hours gave it great flavor throughout. According to some other reviews it was too much oil/butter but I found that it made a lot of delicious gravy. The chicken had a water-based cooking texture from all the sauce.

This recipe has a strong mustard and curry feel. If you dont like one of those ingredients, do not try this recipe. My husband and I happened to enjoy it, though it's not our favorite of the bunch. We served with rice and sauteed spinach.

This dish was delicious.  I actually ended up making it on the crock pot because I wanted the chicken to be more tender than baked chicken.  I set my crockpot on low while at work during the day.  I also threw in some small dutch yellow potatoes, which were quite tasty with the sauce.  It worked out well.  Very easy, very tasty, and I'll be making it again!

I really enjoyed this. I marinated the chicken all night and then I let it sit for 30 mins at room temperature. Then grilled it on the BBQ and served on top a chicken curry gravy. Served it with rice and green and yellow beans in butter and rosemary......My Partner Loved it...Will make it again for sure.....

Yum, Yum, Yum. Yup that about sum's it up :). I baked this recipe as is and loved it and so did my husband, the only complaint I have is the sauce got on our white counter and stained a little but that is my fault and has nothing to do with the wonderful taste of the chicken. Will be making again in the near future.

absolutely wonderful!  whole family loved it - that's me, hubby, and toddler. I didn't have cayenne so I added a pinch of cumin instead, and like a previous reviewer suggested, didn't use the butter. Marinated for only 30 minutes and it was delicious.   I also doubled the sauce and there was plenty to keep the chicken moist and spoon over brown rice. Served this with brown rice and california blend - cauliflower, broccoli, onions, and carrots.   Thanks for sharing!

I liked this recipe, and will make it again, I just don't think it was the most fabulous chicken I had tasted.  I like curry, but we don't eat lots of it. So I found the flavor just enough. Even the pieces of chicken with thicker marinade on them were too strong for me, and had to rub off some of it.  I also preferred the chicken thighs and drumsticks to the breast, but it was all still juicy and tasty. A keeper, but not an all time fav.

This was very good but it was a little sweet for me.  Next time I plan to cut back on the honey and increase the cayenne pepper.

This was outstanding!  I subbed 2 tblsp olive oil for the butter.  Used about 1/6 cup honey (filled it to the 1/3 mark on the measuring cup with water).  Marinated it for 9 hours.  Took the covered pan from the fridge and into the oven.  I used chicken breast cutlets, so the cooking time on the recipe was close (I added an additional 5 minutes).   I served it with Orzo Delicioso (recipe from this site), and had happy campers all around!

Tasty and easy.  My husband said he would like again.  We cooked all the sauce with the chicken and served it over rice.  I mixed the left over rice, chicken and sauce with a little mayo and put it on bread with mixed greens and cheese.  Made a pretty good sandwich.

This is delicious and really easy, but I will cook this in the oven next time instead of grilling.  I used 2 tbs. olive oil spread instead of the butter with great results.

My husband very much enjoyed this recipe, however I was slightly disappointed with the overall flavor. I let the chicken marinade overnight, and perhaps that made the flavor too strong. Will try again, esp since he has requested again.

I forgot that it needed marinating time on the day I made this (oops!), but it still turned out pretty good. There were parts where the marinade was too thick and kind of chalky but I think that was from having no marinating time. 
We will try it again for sure :)

Just great!  Also cut down the butter to half.  Used skinless boneless chicken once and chicken with bone in and skin the second time.  Must say that the bone-in chicken was moister and juicier.  Thank you for sharing and God bless!

I made this just last night & both my and my guy FELL IN LOVE with it.  I cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces and I actually didn't marinade it for more than maybe an hour.  It STILL tasted fantastic!  The only thing I may change in the future is adding some cornstarch to thicken the sauce up.  Other than that, this dish was the tastiest I've made in a long time & I'll most definitely be making this one again!  In fact, I may make it in just a few days!

these came out really good.  i love curry, my room mate hates it.  she didnt notice the curry until she was done eating, and asked if there was curry in it.  it was a pretty good dish, came out really nice, but its probably not something i'd make again based on taste.  i would make it for someone who wanted to eat some chicken and wanted to try something new.  probably a recipe i'd make a few times a year.  4 stars.

Delicious! I didn't have time to marinate so I just mixed it up, slapped it on some bone-in skin-on chicken and baked it for about an hour. I reduced the amount of butter since my chicken had the skin on and added salt, pepper and garlic powder. So easy and so yummy! I baked the chicken covered with foil for the first 20 mins then uncovered for another 40. It stayed juicy though I would have liked the skin to be a little more crispy. Maybe next time less time under the foil. Definitely a keeper! Easy go-to recipe!

This is so good. I’m only giving it four stars because I don’t think it’s "the best" I’ve ever had. But the chicken was nice and tender, very juicy. The sauce was great too, but don’t use all the butter it calls for…I also added a dash of nutmeg. Very nice

My friends love this chicken. I added frozen stir-fry veggies and it made a very good meal. I thought there would be more of a honey mustard taste but the curry is the most prevalent.

Sooooooo good.  We absolutely loved this.  The chicken came out super moist and tender, and the flavor of the sauce is amazing.  I cooked this dish for about 40 min. total (15 covered, and 25 uncovered).  Delicious!

My boyfriend and I absolutely loves this recipe as is, but I add 2 tbsp of apricot preserves to the mixture and we like that even better!  It gives it a wonderful sweet and spicy flavor.  Also, as other reviewers have said, the butter is totally unnecessary - I just add a little bit of EVOO to get the desired consistency and it's just as good and much healthier!

THIS is our new favorite chicken! The whole family loved this so much. We grilled ours also, on the advice of another reviewer. Turned out so tender inside, caramelized on the outside. The flavor was terrific. You could smell the marinade throughout the house. YUM!! A real winner!

This was very similar to a curry chicken recipe my mom uses.  I thought it was pretty good...I used the leftovers to make chicken salad and the chicken salad sandwiches were wonderful!

Overall, this was a nice and simple way to do chicken.  Next time I will cut down on the honey and bump up the curry (it was too sweet), and probably cut down on the butter, too.  I think it will be great with a little tweaking.

My husband and I loved this. It turned out much better than I was expecting it to  because I don't even really like curry!

The only change I made was using less butter- 1/4 cup.  

I will be making this again! :)

I tried this over the weekend.  I didn't like it at all--but I think it was the curry.  My fiance liked it a lot.  I asked him to rate it and he said a 4.

Like I said he really liked it and I served over rice.

This is wonderful - I think it's safe to cut back on the butter and still have a great tasting recipe.  Will make this again.

Giving this 4 stars because I did a different preparation.  But the sauce is definitely 5 star! I used olive oil instead of butter and instead of baking chicken breasts, I chopped up 6 chicken thighs and a bell pepper, combined them with the sauce, and simmered in a skillet for about 15 minutes.  I served over egg noodles and there was plenty of sauce to pour over the noodles.  The taste was amazing!!  Sweet, spicy, and pungent - my house still smells good!  Served with Sauteed Curried Corn from this site. Will definitely try baking with chicken breasts next time!

Delicious!  I used olive oil instead of butter, whole grain dijon mustard and grilled the chicken with onions that I marinated in the sauce as well instead of baking.... YUMMY!   I set aside some of the mixture to drizzle over rice and my son used it like a dipping sauce for his chicken.  Definitely a regular recipe in my rotation moving forward.

I was looking for an easy baked salmon recipe and found this chicken one.  It turned out great.  I used the same ingredients except for evoo instead of the butter.  Baked @375 for 20 mins.  Served over green beans and cous cous.

We loved this recipe!  I did make some changes.  I used mild curry paste to cut down the spice (my wife is breast feeding our new born) and I substituted some of the butter with olive oil.  We used the left over sauce over the chicken on a bed of rice.  A few days later I cooked the chicken in the left over sauce and added some mixed veggies and served over rice.  It was great.  I will make this one again and again!

This was really just okay. It tasted like any other curry chicken dish to me. It was a nice meal. I paired it with brown basmati rice and peas. It just wasn't anything real special. I doubt I'll be making this again.

This is really excellent. We usually make the sauce separate on the stovetop and just top the chicken with it...the flavor is strong enough that the meat really does not need to marinate. In a pinch we have made it with spicy brown mustard, which comes out tasty also, although the texture will be quite a bit grainier.

This was so yummy!  I changed it a bit. I added 1/4tsp. dry mustard, used chicken breast tenderloin strips and cooked it in the sauce in a deep dish, covered.  So tender and tasty, my husband loved it.  I'm going to save the sauce to use on rice.

Very good.  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, spicy brown mustard, a little less honey, and more curry powder (hot madras).  I definitely think the extra curry powder was a good move.

This was very good and so easy.My kids loved it. I used olive oil instead of butter as others suggested. My kids like stuff with sauce so I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream the last 10 minutes of cooking and it made a great sauce.I will be making this dish again.

This chicken was wonderful. I used chicken breast halves, so I cooked it at 425 for 30 minutes on one side and 15 on the other -- cooking times vary, however, and I think my oven's temp may be a little off. Be creative =) It was moist and flavorful! My whole family enjoyed this recipe.

This is my new go-to in a flash recipe.  I use a little olive oil instead of butter.  Less mustard, and skip the cayenne, and its delicious!

I used legs and thighs, had to bake for 1 hr, i also doubled the recipe.  Too much mustard, the curry didn't pop out as much as I hoped, but it could have been the brand of curry I bought - McCormicks. This was very tastey though and well worth making.

Made this for 60 people at church function. It went over big time! The honey cuts down on any spiciness so it was pleasing to everyone. I did leave out the pepper just to be safe and it still tasted great.

I thought this was a good recipe.  To really enhance the flavor of the marinade, I would suggest grilling as opposed to baking.  The juices from the chicken, when baked, make the dish too watery and the marinade runs.

Easy to make ahead of time and bake in the same pan; would work equally well with chicken pieces. I served it with rice and cooked broccoli. Family enjoyed it, will adjust seasonings and make again.

I loved this recipe!  However, I did double the marinade.  Also, I had to add WAY more cayenne (I'm from Louisiana).  Also, I cut the chicken breasts in half to ensure even cooking.  It was delicious!  I highly recommend.

Good Recipe.  I will make again but increase the curry (to me it had a mild curry taste).  When making, I did increase the cayane pepper which may be why the curry seemed mild.  This is a good weekend night recipe, not a very presentation though so I don't think I would serve to guests.

PERFECT recipe.....what a flavor! I was cooking for 2...used only 2 breasts but followed the recipe otherwise, therefore I had a lot of sauce leftover but I poured it over the leftover rice....soooo yummy! Such an easy dish to make! Some other reviewers said they added garlic, but I really think this will change the flavor too much. Keep it as is! (I made the peanut rice from this site and also steamed some red chard to soak up some of the awsome sauce!)

Yum!  This chicken was good!  Recipe was perfect: I didn't add or subtract anything.  I do recommend grilling instead of baking in the oven; however, make sure (if you do grill) not to baste the chicken while it is cooking in the sauce.  Otherwise the flavor will be too overwhelming.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks for the share!

I did like the recipe, but I believe I put to much honey and mustard together. Maybe if I used less the sauce would have been thicker, but the taste was good if you like sweet tasting chicken. I will try making it again!!!

I really loved this recipe, and followed the recipe exactly.  I did add some frozen veggies and let them marinate with the chicken.  Unfortunately, I was not aware the teens and hubby did not like curry.  They did not even like the smell.  After hubby had a bite he changed his mind a little, said still not one of his favorites but good.

I took the advice of another reviewer and reduced the butter to 3 tablespoons and added a dash of cumin.  The chicken was VERY flavorful and juicy.  My only complaint was that it needed just a little kick.  Next time I will increase the cayenne pepper and add minced onion.

This recipe was delicious and the chicken was very tender. Probably the best chicken I've ever made by following a recipe! I used slightly more mustard than the recipe called for, slightly less butter, and I butterflied the chicken breasts to facilitate even cooking. Served with brown rice and broccoli, it was perfect.

This was very easy to prepare.  I marinated chix in ziplock bags overnight and transferred to a heavy sheet pan for baking.  I left a lot of the marinade in the ziplock, so there wasn't too much sauce.  The taste was a nice combonation of flavors.  I served it to 15 people, and everyone really liked it.

We have never really liked curry, but gave this recipe a try.  It is very good.  We like our chicken a bit more done so I baked it about 35 minutes.  This is definitely a keeper!

OK but nothing I'd make again.  Just didn't care for the combination of flavors.  Allow about twice as much time as recipe states if large chicken breasts.

Incredibly tasty and easy.  Perfect recipe as is.  I have found I need to cook the chicken a little longer than suggested but that might just be my oven.

A little tip for anyone trying to do low carb:  I usually cut the honey in half and substitue splenda to taste.  No one has ever noticed.

This is quick to prepare so I make it from time to time although I've changed the proportions.  Too much honey for our taste and as much as I love curry I think that 4 tsp. is overkill.

Busy cooks must have recipe!  Very easy to do and tastes great.  Have even used the sauce on grilled chicken skewers.  Marinate the chicken skewers with some sauce, save the rest to brush over or to dip in.  Also ok to use pre-made honey Dijon mustard if you’re really squeezed for time.

YUM!  I did not marinate the chicken and did not miss it.  I added extra curry and used a healthy shaking of red pepper flakes because I did not have cayenne pepper.  I doubled the recipe and had to add about 10 more minutes to the cooking time.  I also added some golden raisins and served it over plenty of brown rice.  My family of 5 loved it.  Thank you Priscilla.

Wow! This was great. I didn't have dijon mustard so I used regular and it was outstanding.  My very picky husband liked it and I loved it.  I added much more cayenne pepper though and it had just enough kick.  A keeper.

This is an incredible recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, except just a scoosh more curry dusted over when I popped it in the oven.  Will use this one every year for the holidays!  Thanks so much!

Perfect blend of curry, honey and dijon mustard. Reduced butter, the rest was perfect. YUM!

A good basic curry chicken.  Served over rice.  Kind of plain.  Might look for another recipe that has more stuff in it like almonds, raisins.
Still a good recipe.  My son and hubby munched the leftovers the next day.

Okay, so still dreaming of this dish. I am going to make this at least once a week. It is soo good. I wish I could rate it more stars. I recommend this to anyone. I served with rice w/cilantro added...and let me tell you...the sauce was so good, that I really could have drank it.... I didnt..but it was so delicious. This is my NEW FAVORITE!!!! Thanks

This is a great recipe- definitely a keeper! I only added a 1/4 c honey to tone down the sweetness, about 2 pinches of cayenne pepper, and a dash of cumin as another reviewer suggested- and it was superb ! Instead of serving on rice, next time I think I will try the chicken on a warm pita with plum tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion, spinach leaves, and a sprig of cilantro. Mmmm...

This was nice except I found the curry powder too overpowering. Next time I would add just one teaspoon of curry powder as it is a very strong spice.
