This turned out really tasty. I did end up giving it a punch of worcestershire to give it deeper color. After I sliced 8 ounces of mushrooms it looked like a full pound would have been overkill so I stopped there. It wouldn't have been. Use the full pound. The only thing I did not care of in this recipe was the cheese. It didn't melt. If the cheese isn't going to melt anyways I will definitely use one we like the flavor of better next time.

I made this exactly as is and my husband and picky kids loved it! The only critique would be the cheese but that’s purely a taste-preference.  We’re going to try provolone next time like a traditional Philly cheesesteak!

Easy week night meal. I cooked sliced pepper and onion too.
