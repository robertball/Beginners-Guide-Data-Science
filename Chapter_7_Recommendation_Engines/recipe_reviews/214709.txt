But then it wouldn't be Mother's Potato Salad! It would become Dr. Greg's Potato Salad. Now, I'd rather have Mother's....but that's just me!

This potato salad is an excellent base but it doesn't get the 5th star because small changes improve it significantly.  Mind you, it's a fantastic keeper recipe!  I cut down on the gherkins because they give too much vinegar taste.  Try some small capers, and/or substitute some black, sliced, pitted olives for some of the green ones; and/or some grilled, peeled red or yellow pepper; thinly slice a tropea red onion, soak it in white wine vinegar, rinse it and substitute for the small onion; and substitute that cheap yellow mustard with some serious, mild dijon.... it gets that 5th star!!

At first I was dubious about the combination of sweet gherkins and green olives but I decided to give it a try. I'm not a fan of potato salads that are sweet, but the olives and the onions balance the sweetness of the pickles. I substituted horseradish mustard for the yellow mustard and it turned out great.

With a few changes this has become my "Go-To" recipe for potato salad. I don't put the olives in because we don't care for them. I do put a few extra eggs in, add extra mustard and I use relish instead of the pickles. I usually end up making this every weekend during the summer for parties. Thanks for such a simple and delicious recipe!!

I have made this potato salad since I can remember.  Except for the green pepper... I have never added that.  I use diced pimento stuffed green olives instead of just plain pimento.  It's always great, and I get lots of compliments on it every time.

Perfect "church basement" potato salad.  My wife was not sure about the olives (_I_ liked them!), so next time I will double the gherkins.  I may experiment with the type of mustard - Dijon, heavy grained, etc.

Loved it! I reserved half as is and the other half with half of a granny apple (diced) for my boyfriend who loves apples in his potato salad. Both were delicious!

it's a close match to my grandmas, calls for 3 celery ribs and 2 table spoons of mustard. if I cut those two item's, in half and add another egg. Should be about right for me. thanks for the awesome guidelines to follow.

Used this recipe for my first try at potato salad.  My husband loved it.  I omitted the olives and green peppers.  I also used dill pickles instead of sweet Gershwin’s.  I will definitely be making this again.

I just eyeballed everything cause that's the way I roll. Didn't have any green peppers and limited the olives ( family won't eat them). It was very well received at Memorial Day cookout. It's very close to the recipe I grew up on. Will definitely make this a lot this summer.

I simplified my version by using chopped onion, chopped hard boiled eggs, and celery seed.  Dressing as recipe states.  Of course, salt and pepper to taste.  I garnish with sliced hard boiled egg, then sprinkle with paprika.
