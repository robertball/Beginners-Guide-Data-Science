These were so good that my husband and I could not eat just one. I have been looking for a great oatmeal cookie recipe for years and this is it. I also added 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. ground cloves to the recipe.  They were wonderful and I will be making another batch very soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies have a wonderful flavour.  I have made them many times now. Sometimes they flatten out and sometimes they don't (and I gently press them down with a lifter, straight from the hot oven).

We call these "crack cookies" because they are so addicting and you crave more when they're gone!

These were wonderful!  I used chocolate covered raisin and added a bit extra flour because I live at a high altitude.  Thanks for sharing!

These cookies had a very nice taste.  But the cooking time was off alittle, I thought.  My cookies were very doughey in the  middle and needed at least 12 mins to cook.  I think I will look for a different oatmeal raisin cookie.

My cookies came out flat and crispy. I suppose I could have done something wrong, but I doubt it because I am not a beginner cook. I wonâ€™t waste ingredients trying again.

I had a slight problem with the stickiness of the dough, don't know if anyone else has... They needed 15 minutes in my oven to get that nice brown colour. But the flavours are amazing, the family loves it!
