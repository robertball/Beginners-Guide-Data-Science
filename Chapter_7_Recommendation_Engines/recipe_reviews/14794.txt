I marinated overnight, it was pretty good, think I'd like more "zest" but it was a great change on pork, this is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly (perhaps I was a bit liberal with the thickness of the sliced ginger root) and it was delicious!  My husband loved it and I will be making it again soon.  Thank you!

This recipe was a little confusing.  It said to cook a 5 lb roast for 1 hour or until internal temp reaches 160.  This took exactly 2 hours for me.  The roast was so dry when it came out that we could barely eat it.  I marinated for two days, but there was no evidence of any flavor in the meat at all.  I will not be making again!

I and the wife liked it. Kids thought it was OK. I think ginger is a bit of an acquired taste.

I would almost give this recipe a 5 star rating. The flavor is really good. The fruit comes through so well, and the roast comes out tender and moist. I stopped the cooking at 144 degrees internal. It coasted up to about 150 during the rest. That is plenty done for a pork roast these days. 160 internal will turn that beautiful loin into shoe leather, but I think AllRecipes has to cover themselves against legal attacks in the case someone does get sick from bacterial toxins or infections. I used a 3 pound pork loin and it took longer than the suggested time for a 5 pound roast cooked to a well done level. That is my one complaint. The time was way off. If the editor changes the internal temperature, they should correct for the time or reword to only use a thermometer, not a timer. This is a keeper recipe.

I cannot rate this higher than four due to the HUGE discrepency in cooking time.  It said take it to 145, about one hour.  It took me almost two hours to get it to 145, and I do not eat pork that is only cooked to 145.  The FDA recommends 170, and my programmable thermometer says 160.  It took 2 1/2 hours to get it to 160, and it was still lightly pink inside.
But the recipe is great!  The glaze was tasty, and thickened with corn starch it was a GREAT sauce to top slices of this roast with.
Next time, I will figure on approaching three hours to get it to 170 internal to get rid of the pink.
I just don't like pink meat!  Chicken, also, I always cook longer than the recipe calls for.
Mine was NOT dry, though; the initial browning all over and then the basting every ten minutes kept the inside nice and moist.
I used a 3 lb half of a Boston Butt roast for this, and marinated it for 24 hours.


Definite keeper - I will make this one again!!

I was only able to marinate for about 5 hours, but I think the flavor still came through.  I followed the recipe, but was using 2 shoulder roasts with bone in (3lb, and 4lb).  They took a long time to come to 145F (almost 2 hours) and then the inside was very pink.  I am OK with a little pink.  With pork you are just trying to kill trichinosis (more prevalent in game than commercial pork) so 145 is OK.  I'd start this far in advance of 1 hour and just keep checking temps.
