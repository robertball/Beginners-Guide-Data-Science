A great way to use leftover turkey but....you either need to make 1 1/2- 2 times the sauce or use only only 1/2 the amouobt of pasta.  Not enough sauce for 1 lb of pasta.  Wonderful dish...i know I will make it again.

Yummy!  I added white cooking wine like a previous person mentioned.  I also added a bit of chicken broth.  Added my own spices in addition to those called for (basil, oregano, tarragon, salt, and crushed black pepper) to the onions and mushrooms along with a clove of fresh garlic.  I will definately make this again!

This is a good recipe. Used one cup milk and one cup half and half for a creamier sauce. Cut the pasta in half, as the last time I made this it came out too dry.

I was looking for a 30+ year old recipe when I found this one.  I read the recipe and a couple of the reviews before making it.  I followed Juliema's advice and added basil, tarragon, oregano and used half & half instead of milk.  I also used 12 oz. of egg noodles because I had them on hand, but they are too heavy for this recipe.  It still needed a little more milk (and 1/2 the pasta), but it was absolutely delicious!  I will note the additions I made and make it again for the rest of the turkey leftovers.  Spray your casserole dish first; makes a lot, so as one other person said, put it in 2 pans and freeze one for later if there are not at least 4 of you.  Great with fresh homemade bread and butter!

This was so darn good. I did make some changes though. I sauteed 1 onion, 1 tsp garlic and a pack of mushrooms in 2 tablespoons butter.  After it cooks for a few minutes I added 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup white cooking wine and let simmer.  This adds so much flavor. I tend to cook a lot with the red wine vinegar.  I added the mustard and chicken broth ( I use the granular) and let simmer until tender. Then I added the flour and I used half and half.  after it was thickened, I added the turkey and cooked noodles and stirred it all together and poured it into a large glass pan. I do not put cheese in the sauce I put it all on top so it can melt. I then broil it at the end for about 3 minutes or until the cheese is crispy. My girls keep asking for this over and over. I just made it 4 days ago and now making it again by request.

Thank you for the recipe.

I used reduced fat cheese, 1% milk, and 12 ounces of pasta, instead of 16, and I think it turned out great. The recipe didn't indicate whether I should grease the caserole dish, so I sprayed it lightly with cooking spray and it was very easy to serve (no sticking). I baked it covered for the first 15 minutes, then uncovered it for the last 10 minutes. It's a great, unique way to use leftover turkey, but I think it would be great with chicken as well.

I substituted the cheddar with 1/2 cup each of parmesan and romano.  I added: as recommended in other reviews; tarragon, basil, oregano.  I left out pimentos,  added mushrooms, and finished it in two days licking my lips.

Okay this was a great recipe and though I made some revisions due to lack of ingredients last minute, it was wonderful!  I used a can of cheddar cheese soup (with one can of milk) instead of the home made sauce (as a previous reviewer mentioned) and I didn't have any pimentos so I threw in a 1/4 C of salsa for some flavour.  Also I only needed to use ONE package of pasta and it was almost too much.  Even with my changes the recipe was fabulous and my picky kids were fighting over the left overs!

This was OK, but the poultry seasoning was a little overpowering, so next time I will reduce it.  Also, there was way too much pasta!  I made the amount called for in the recipe, and I ended up only using half of it or it would have been way too much.  I will make this again, but I will play around with the seasonings a bit, add some flavor other than the poultry seasoning.

This was pretty good.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and substituted half and half for the milk.  I also doubled the mustard, white pepper and poultry seasoning and added just a couple of shakes of garlic powder to the sauce.  I used the amount of noodles suggested.  It didn't come out dry, and it wasn't soupy either.  We thought the consistency was perfect.

This was a nice dish.  I used grilled turkey breasts which added a nice flavor.  I think the dish could have used a bit more "soup".  It seemed a little dry.  Overall a good meal!

I also only used 8 oz of pasta; half & half instead of milk to make it thicken faster, 1/4 cup of sherry (most tetrazzini recipes call for it), frsh mushrooms, and parmesan and asiago cheeses instead of cheddar.  With these changes it was awesome!

I like the sauce because it is made from scratch, but 16 oz. pasta was too much for the amount of sauce.  Use less pasta so it isn't so dry.

My stepson loved, but he's accustomed to eating bland food. Recommend adding some paprika, garlic salt and ground white pepper.

We liked this very much. I made a couple of "tweaks": Italian seasoning instead of poultry seasoning, a pinch of nutmeg, garlic powder, black pepper instead of white... I made about 12 ounces of pasta and added a cup of the pasta water to the mixture. Good stuff!

My picky boys loved this. I made a few changes. I omitted poultry seasoning, pimento, and mushrooms. I pureed 1/4 onion, added 2tsp dried basil, 1tsp dried thyme, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, and 1/4 cup of Turkey broth. This is a winner.

This was fantastic with changes! I subbed basil, oregano, and garlic powder for seasonings, used sharp cheddar and fresh parm, and doubled the sauce. I put half in the freezer, but had to pull it back out when the first pan was gone in minutes!

I made quite a few changes, but this was a huge hit with my husband and daughter.  After the onions were browned in the butter I added 8 oz minced baby bella mushrooms and skipped the canned mushrooms and pimentos. I used 1 cup chicken broth in place of one of the cups of milk. I subbed smoked Gouda for the cheddar because that's what I had. Replaced the spaghetti with rotini.  And instead of layering, I mixed everything together, as you would for mac and cheese.  Fantastic!

Made more soup than called for - used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, added some chicken broth and white wine.  Omitted mushrooms and peppers - added chopped onions and fresh garlic.  Cooked ground turkey.

I added garlic power and used half the pasta. I also did not layer the ingredients as instructed but rather mixed it up before putting in the baking dish. It was excellent.

This recipe was perfect for my leftover turkey from Christmas dinner! I thought it could have been a little "saucier" but my husband preferred it this way! I also added a little parmesan cheese to the sauce (maybe why it was was not as saucy). All-in-all, a really great and easy recipe!

Tasty, but agree that you should double the sauce and add more mustard. I also used fresh mushrooms as they cooked well in the cheese sauce.

I halved the noodles and added green peas instead of the pimentos.  It was good enough for my kids to eat so I gave it four, however for me it is more a three star recipe.  That said, I would definatly dice the turkey next time.  It was much too bulky sliced.

This recipe was really good although it was rather difficult to get the cheese sauce to thicken with the directions given.  I made a few modifications, and it was really good.  I would make this again and my 8 year son loved it.

Used fresh portabellas and cooked them with the onions in the butter instead of the canned mushrooms.  Also, to make it gluten free I just used gluten free spaghetti noodles and gluten free flour.

The flavor was great, but not enough sauce.  I did changed it a bit; Instead of canned mushrooms, I sautéed mushrooms in butter and instead of poultry seasoning I made my own mix of fresh rosemary, sage, thyme, fresh parsley and ginger and  replaced the pasta with  egg noodles.  Next time I will double up on the sauce.  Being that there wasn't enough sauce, the noodles were dry and crispy on the top.  That was the only negative.

I use egg noodles and add a can of cream of mushroom soup (progreso low sodium). This balances off the need for more sauce.  A pinch of yellow curry lends a savory complexity.

I started off stir frying onion, garlic and peppers.
Hearing that people found this dry, I made about 1/2 as much sauce again (more milk and flour). I also added some white wine I had on-hand (just poured some in) and about 2 tsp of Worcestershire. I also added some cream cheese to the sauce, melting everything down to a nice smooth sauce.
For seasonings I added Poultry Seasoning and a pinch of Red Pepper Flakes.
I chopped the turkey and added it to the cream sauce then added the pasta and stirred everything together. Placed the pasta mixtures into a casserole dish then topped with grated cheddar and a parmesan cheese.
This turned out great! What a super way to use turkey leftovers when you are tired of the gravy and potato type dinner!

This was an easy recipe to put together. i did not have mushrooms so I used a bag of Green Giant honey roasted corn and it was delicious! I gave it a kick with some tabasco sauce which goes with everything and 2 table spoons of white cooking wine.

I added a bag of mixed veggies, salt and pepper but then still had to sprinkle Parmesan cheese on it after sampling a bite. It is a fast easy recipe and that is great but if you have your heart set on great Tetrazzini you'll have to look up a more complicated recipe.

This was a really good recipe. I made everything exactly as suggested with the exception of the permentos.  I used a small can of green chilies instead. Tasted great, my husband and son asked for seconds. I will make again.

I followed this recipe very loosely using brown rice noodles, dried mushrooms that I rehydrated, all the same spices - to taste, fresh milk and some canned milk, some chicken broth, lots of chopped onions, the cheese and it turned out great.  Will make again when I have loads of turkey leftovers.

Easy and Quick recipe.  I added a few other ingredients: celery, carrotts and peas.  I also used Parmesan instead of cheddar cheese and prepared everything stove top versus baking.

Very easy.  I definitely agree that you need to either cut the pasta in half or double the sauce.  I will have to do some experimenting with various spices and I would like to try it with white wine/chicken broth.  This was a fun dish to cook!

This REALLY was a good weeknight meal.  I followed to the letter, except using the shell noodles my 4 year old picked out.  I left it in a little too long, so it was a little dry, but she still had 2 helpings.  Thank you!

I made this for dinner last night. The only problem is the pasta soaked all the sauce up, and made it dry. I will try again with half the pasta  and maybe make more cheese sauce. Otherwise it was very good and even my picky grown daughter liked it. she's 27.

I love this recipe. I add frozen green peas on top of the turkey layer, and I like to make more of the “sauce” if I can—with extra shredded cheese on top. I always have leftover pasta, so you could probably use 3/4 of a 16-ounce box.

Good, but need to double the sauce. Even after cutting the pasta in half. Great taste though.

I took the advice of a couple cooks and doubled the sauce. I like it a little saucier, so I will double the sauce and cut down  the pasta by 20% for that recipe. Loved it.

Delish!  Used this as a guideline....Because I didn’t have all the ingredients, but followed some of what the reviews suggested.  I will definitely make this again!

Was very good, used fresh mushrooms chopped a 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead of canned, and fine chopped some broccoli to add to the sauce for color. Next time will make more sauce and there will be a next time. Great company recipe with a Caesar salad and garlic toast. Thanx for the recipe.

This is a easy recipe but you definitely want to either double the sauce or cut the noodles in half. Tastes great though.

Shoot! Wish I had read the reviews before making it. Totally agree that you can cut the pasta back quite a bit. The flavor is good. I’ll make it again and modify it. I did add frozen peas for another veggie, too.

Excellent, if not terribly healthy, recipe. This is one that my husband dreams of. Weight Watchers beware - one serving is 14 points. Honestly, though? Worth it. I do recommend adding spinach or broccoli (blanched and chopped) to the casserole. It will add some vitamins and make you feel a little better about eating it!

I used only 8 oz of pasta as I wanted to make a 1/2 of what the original recipe made.  I needed to double the sauce.  I liked the flavor and I think next time I'll sautee fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Also, I added celery to lighten the flavor.

This wasn't that great. It was a good way to use up the last bit of leftover Thanksgiving turkey but the taste was sort of "meh". First off, the noodle to sauce ratio is completely off. Too many noodles not enough sauce. I suggest half the noodles or double the sauce. I used one pack of thin spaghetti noodles and it was too much. Also I'm not sure if this was my mistake, but it was very peppery.  I won't be making this again.

I was in a hurry to make a turkey recipe and chose this one.  I didn't take time to consider that, if you dilute your turkey 3 or 4 to one with bland ingredients such as spaghetti, milk, flour, etc. you are going to get a bland dish.  Further, if you first cook your spaghetti and then cook it for another hour it's going to be mushy.  I considered this dish a waste of good turkey.  With a few more tasty ingredients it might be an OK way to stretch your last turkey, but, with luck, you will not have this problem.

Loved it.  Like another reviewer I sauteed fresh mushrooms and carrots and garlic with the onions, then added some wine and cooked it down.  Used half and half and added basil and tarragon and turmeric and used rotisserie chicken.  Also used homemade spinach noodles.  Did not have any pimento.  This recipe is so easy and flexible with what you have on hand.

Good recipe overall. I would use fresh portabella mushrooms and increase the sauce volume slightly for a 9 x 13 dish. If you don't increment the sauce volume I might also do one layer only of the pasta as some of the pasta was only covered by cheese at the top and was singed a bit due to the sauce volume being slightly lower than needed.

There was barely enough sauce so I added 3/4 cup of milk to the casserole before baking. It still could have used more. Next time, I will make 1.5 times sauce as an earlier reviewer suggested.

I used a smaller pkg of pasta than the recipe called for, and I still thought it was too much pasta.  I will also cover it while baking next time, which the directions did not say to do.  I thought the top layer got too crispy while cooking.  I will make this again, however I will increase the amount of sauce.  I did love that it was easy and quick to come together.  It was also easy to make a smaller dish for my vegetarian daughter, and replace the turkey with broccoli.

This is a great recipe for leftover turkey and is easy to cut in half (since there are only 2 of us).  I added some fresh chopped up spinach with the turkey.  My husband likes things really creamy next time I will make more sauce.  I also used fresh mushrooms and they worked well.  Will definitely use this again.

Great way to use leftover turkey. Next time I would make more cream sauce so it isn't so dry. Family loved it though and are waiting for the next attempt.

I used old bay seasoning instead of poultry seasoning. I also added celery to the onions.  I cubed the turkey and also made half again the amount of sauce using some half and half.  You could just throw everything together on the stove top and then garnish with your cheese of choice at the table which is what I did.  This recipe was wonderful!!!!

This is a very good recipie.  I made some slight modifications.  I used fresh mushrooms and chopped them up really small to hide from the kids and sauteed them with the butter.  I also doubled the sauce recipe and even then didn't use all the noodles called for.  It was a little dry but the kids LOVED it.  That is a good recipie in my book since my kids hate casseroles.  would definitely make again.

This has a great taste. I had to add a jar of four cheese sauce. The sauce did not make quite enough. I added cracker crumbles & shredded cheddar on top. It was very tasty! Hubby & kids loved it!!

Don't use canned mushrooms!!! You can use real ones if you stream them in the microwave first. Worth the few extra seconds!

Great recipe! I used shredded turkey and egg noodles as I didn't have angle hair pasta on hand. Loved the sauce, I may just use it for other recipes also.

This was an excellent way to use up the leftover turkey! It was hot, hearty and delicious. I think the seasoning could be pumped up a bit with more white pepper and ground mustard. I used fresh mushrooms and, now, I'm eager to try it with white wine or sherry.

Didn't have any mushrooms or pimentos. Added my leftover half and half to milk to make 2 cups. A hit with my
 23 year old son and husband!

It was very good, prepared as is but used a lot more fresh mushrooms which I nuked first and drained.  Kind of weird using cheddar instead of a white cheese but thoroughly enjoyable!!

Absolutely awesome!  I did use 1 cup half and half and one cup milk.  Froze it and took it up north for Deer Camp.

This turned out to be a big hit with my 4 boys & my husband!  Made it twice in one night so we'd have enough to freeze some.  (that kind of good!)

7-8-16 made it again and switched out turkey for chicken & they devoured it!

I substituted whole wheat angel hair for regular, but otherwise followed the recipe carefully.  It was very dry and bland.  I assume I did something wrong, but I can't figure out what.  If I were going to do it again, I would add 16 oz of sour cream, and seasoning.

I had never had Tetrazzini before and I thought this was really good. My dh was not so impressed. Maybe next time I will leave out the pimentos (he doesn't like them) and see if it goes over better. 
Thanks!

I added a little bit of wine after putting the pasta in the baking dish, and also sprinkled a little parmessian cheese over it.  Everyone I served it to liked it.

I like this recipe a lot, and it is one that my entire family will eat!! Yippee.  :0)
I double the cheese, and use 1/2 fat free, and 1/2 regular, and I also add a lot more pimento's and spices. This recipes is a winner every time!
A great big THANK YOU to Earla for sharing this one!
