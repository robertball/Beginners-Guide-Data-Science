Delicious!  I had to improvise because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I added a can of cream of mushroom because I didn't have milk, used broccoli because I didn't have mixed veggies, spaghetti instead of macaroni and used bread crumbs mixed with some garlic/italian seasoning because I didn't have stuffing.  I think it's the perfect recipe to improvise though and definitely would be just as tasty made exactly the way the recipe describes.

This was a great easy weeknight meal.  I had to improvise a little for what I had on hand.  I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey, cream of mushroom soup, and frozen chopped broccoli.  I also didn't have any stuffing so crushed up some garlic and herb croutons on top-didn't even need the butter.  My two year old gobbled it up.  Will definetly make again.

I thought I would like this better, but looks like I was wrong.  Thanks for the recipe.

Super Chicken Casserole Haiku: "Not remarkable. It's comfort food at its core. Needs some broccoli." Only had half a bag of frozen peas & carrots, so I made up for the difference w/ some quickly-blanched, chopped broccoli. (Figured why not, since cream of broccoli soup was in it.) Didn't have the stuffing, so I took another review's suggestion and crushed up seasoned croutons. Oh and my pasta was penne, not elbows, but close enough. Not a wow-inspiring meal - it was good, but not earth-shattering. With a little jazzing up (Idk, minced garlic, additional spices or veggies), it'd be a nice casserole to make in bulk and freeze, but at dinnertime, we weren't terribly impressed w/ it.

This is a great casserole! I cooked my chicken with butter and some italian seasoning to add flavor to it. I also added corn instead of peas and carrots and used cheddar cheese instead of mazzerella cheese. I added some oregano & salt to the casserole as well, that really gave it a great flavor! I will be making this one again and again!!

Pretty Good! I didn't have any leftovers with 4 people and a little one. I underestimated the Cream of Brocolli soup since I have never used it before. I was impressed!

I needed to use up some chicken and had all the ingredients on hand for this recipe. The only thing I substituted was the stuffing, I had Chicken flavored Stove Top available. I also increased the macaroni to closer to two cups to make it go further. My husband and I liked it. Our two boys, ages five and seven were split, the youngest didn't care for it. I will be making it again!

Smashing Hit. I made this for 40+ teenagers and 10 adult staff. Everyone came back for 2nds & 3rds.  I definitely recommend it for potlucks or large gatherings.  I love how easy it is to recalculate for the number of servings and the recipe is reconfigured to match the servings.

Very Good. I substituted cream of mushroom instead of cream of broccoli and it was just as delicious.

I prepared this just as the recipe indicated and both my husband and I found it bland.I did use an extra can of the broccoli soup and chicken flavored Stove Top but that is it and that hardly counts as changing the recipe. I was surprised since the reviews were so good.

I loved this casserole.  I did change the elbow noodles to small shells and I substituted the carrots with peas and corn.  I used the 98% fat free brocolli soup and I used reduced fat mozarella string cheese and it turned out fabulous and LOW FAT!  will make again!!

It was wonderfully easy to make and turned out delicious. I did not have stuffing so substituted with bread crumbs and seasoning.

Very yummy, adjustable basic recipe! I didn't have cream of broccoli, so I used cream of mushroom. Used canned chicken. Didn't have mozzarella so I used more Parmesan & some other white cheese (white cheddar? that I had in my fridge. Still very tasty, easy quick meal for those days your fridge is empty or you are crunched for time :)

Was okay.  Added more veggies than what it called for, and was worried that it would be dry so I added another can of soup (used cream of mushroom).  Probably was too moist.  Maybe next time I'll add some sour cream instead.

As somebody else said, it's comfort food. I through this together one night for dinner on a day where I was too busy to cook something that would be time consuming. This was quick, easy, but not anything spectacular. I cooked the chicken with italian seasoning and used sharp cheddar cheese in place of mozzarella. I covered it for the first 20 minutes of cooking, sprinkled the stuffing mixture, and cooked it uncovered for the last 5 minutes.

Great and easy recipe.  I did add some additional garlic powder and onion powder while cooking the chicken, and added more garlic powder to the recipe.  My husband and both kids (10 & 13 months) liked it.  We will make again :)

I modified this for health reasons. I used some herbed salad croutons that I had on hand, skipped the parmesan cheese, used fat free butter spray for the melted butter, 1 can of 98% fat free broccoli cheese soup, fat free mozzarella cheese and 1 Tbsp. of real garlic. My husband said it was pretty good and my oldest son said it was really good. It was easy to make. Next time I may add some poultry seasoning.
