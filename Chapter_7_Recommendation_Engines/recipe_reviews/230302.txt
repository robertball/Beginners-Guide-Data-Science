It's no wonder I liked this!  With the exception of the white wine, which I really liked, this is the way I've been making Beef Stroganoff since I was a young girl in the early 60s, from a paperback Sealtest cookbook! (Any of you out there old enough to remember Sealtest Dairy?)  Two minor criticisms, however.  First, it is counterintuitive to cook a pretty decent cut of meat like sirloin for "two to three hours."  "Back in the day," when I was making this with round steak, it was indeed necessary to simmer (braise) the meat in beef broth for an hour and a half or so to ensure tenderness. But with sirloin, once browned it didn't need much longer on the stove than it took to pull it all together with the remaining ingredients - ten minutes tops.  Second, the wine should be used to deglaze the pan once the meat is browned, not just before serving as the recipe instructs.  You want the alcohol to cook off.  These, in my view, are two important considerations for the success of this dish.  Also, while I did not measure any ingredients precisely, I do know I used more broth and less flour than the recipe directs.   Finally, don't forget to include pepper with the salt! I served this with hot, buttered egg noodles tossed with fresh chives and a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley for garnish.

I'm on a budget so instead of beef sirloin, I used beef STEW MEAT. I made sure that the recipe simmered for a while before I used the stew meat as the simmering helps tenderize the tougher cuts of meat. When I floured the meat, I added just a little onion powder, garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. I made no other changes. Mine was done simmering at just under two hours. I served this over hot buttered egg noodles. My family INHALED this. Out of the whole skillet, there was a small amount for my husband to take for work the next day. Delicious!

This is absolutely delicious. I made this exactly as directed and got a dish that was creamy, rich with flavor and hearty. My son liked it a lot and he is not a beef fan. I only had ground beef on hand but it worked just fine following the same directions. I sprinkled the flour & salt mixture over the ground beef before placing it in the pan. It adds flavor and thickens the drippings.

Thank you for adding this!

Very delicious and easy to follow instructions!
This was my first time making Beef Stroganoff; I came to allrecipes.com looking for something my friend described as having made and I chose this one because it uses the same ingredients.
As I was nervous about the meat tenderizing I used a tenderloin roast which cut simmer time to almost nothing.
Simple, made mostly with ingredients commonly on hand with an outstanding result!
Creamy, beefy, mushrooms. You won't go wrong!

This was one of the best stroganoff recipes I've ever tried.  I just shared some leftovers with a coworker and she agreed.  I did add some balsamic vinegar to the stock mixture and I added more than the called for beef stock as the roux was too thick without it.  Very, very tasty!

Delish! And yes, I made this in the crockpot.....used some marsala wine since I had no white wine, and at the end of slow cooking for about 9-10 hours, added 4 oz. of low fat cream cheese and 1c of low fat sour cream, thick, creamy and delicious! Served over buttered egg noodles, family loved...thanks!

Great recipe. I recommend de-glazing the pan with the white wine and increasing the amount of beef stock.Any cut of beef can be used, increase cooking times for 'tougher' cuts. Philly cheese is a great substitute for sour cream. Serve with fresh parsley and egg noodles. I have made this recipe many times, its a firm family favorite

Tried this recipe and the family loved it. The tomato paste makes for a more "rich" sauce than others recipes. I used "Better Than Bouillon - Beef Base" for the stock as it keeps very well and is my go to beef stock with great flavor. I also used Red wine, as I traditionally use red wine with red meat and white wine with white meat. I'm sure its fantastic as written, a definite recipe to try. I've never ad better stroganoff...,

This was very easy and very good.  I used all the ingredients with the exception of leaving out the mushrooms since I didn't have any.  After sautéing the beef and onions I put everything in a slow cooker for about 3 hours and added the sour cream at the end.   It was a good comfort food dinner.

this was my most adventurous attempt at a 'gourmet' meal. followed the directions exactly (with the exception of more garlic, as is our preference).....was fantabulous! could not be happier with the result - it will assuredly become a regular in this home.

I tripled the flour and salt in the first step to properly coat the meat and that left the drippings quite thick so I doubled the butter for both steps and also doubled the mushrooms. I ran out of wine so I used more beef stock instead. Also only let it cook for a little over an hour. It needed quite a bit of pepper at the end but the result was fantastic. I have a simpler, less traditional recipe that I usually use for beef stroganoff but my exceptionally picky husband actually moaned several times while eating this so I guess this is my new recipe.

This was very good.  I made it the night before (except for the sour cream and wine). The next day, I heated through with any extra 1/4  to 1/2 cup water. Then I added the wine.  We just added a couple of dollops of sour cream on top once plated. I will defintiely make again! I followed the recipe except for adding a little extra meat and adding sour cream to plate. The sirloin steak strips were tender in about 2 to 2 1/4 hours. I used No Yolk egg noodles; the next time I will use regular egg noodles - this recipe deserves it.  Best of all, no canned soup involved!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight as the recipe stated but doubled it.  Very tender meat and a nice rich sauce.  My husband and children enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe.  However I will keep looking.  Lacked the flavor profile I was seeking and remember from childhood.

I love Beef Stroganoff and being able to bring the dish to the table quickly, easily and tastefully is a blessing. This may not be the pernultimate Stroganoff recipe but it will be our go to recipe in the future. And FYI Beef Stoganoff was traditionally served over mashed potatoes and is my preferred presentation  .

This recipe is pretty much identical to one I received in a recipe cards-of-the-month set, and it is one we have enjoyed for years. The one thing the card mentioned, that I do not see here, is that you can substitute beef boulion for the wine.  We make the bouillon two or three times as strong as you would make if you were drinking it, depending on how beefy you want it to be.  Being non-drinkers, we do not miss the fermented wine taste.  If you want a little tart fruitiness, you can also add a little cider vinegar to the bouillon.  It is good either way.

This dish was incredible.  I hate to sound too "Food Network-y", but the sauce had an unexpected depth of flavor--so rich and delicious.  Sadly, there were no leftovers.  Even though there are only 3 of us, each of us went back for seconds.
*****
Note:  I didn't have tomato paste, so I substituted 5-Tbsp. tomato sauce.  I used Sauvignon Blanc, and I used it to deglaze the pan rather than later in the recipe.  I used a "healthy" bowtie pasta, but I think I'll use unhealthy egg noodles next time.  :-D

This was simply delicious, the only thing I changed was as previous rated was the placement of the wine and addition of a tablespoon of Worcestershire.  I deglazed the pan after cooking the meat, I could still taste the back drop of the wine and believe if added in the end would be way to strong of the wine taste.  If you don't like the taste of wine I would even leave it out all together, but it did give a zing to the sauce.  All in all it was very rich and tasty.  It's a thrifty way to stretch a rather expensive steak as I used a couple Tbones, only because I did not have sirloin available this day.

Good, but something was missing. It needed more of a beef flavor in my opinion and less of the tomato. I added a little bit of paprika to the sauce and extra sour cream. 3 stars for me and 5 stars from the rest of my family. Serve with coleslaw and mashed potatoes :)

This is terrific. I have been teaching my teenaged son how to cook and we had not yet made a German selection. This one proved to be ideal and in no way too difficult for a beginner. We prepared it exactly as the recipe specified. We found it to be very flavorful and as authentic as any stroganoff I have ever been served. I did serve the sauce over white rice, as is my personal preference. We will make this again.   Thank you Nana.

My family liked the flavor of this recipe. I used leftover prime rib, I know that's a strange cut to put in a recipe like this but we had a lot of meat leftover after Christmas and my family was getting tired of it.  The only thing I did differently was I didn't brown the meat, I just prepared the sauce with the mushrooms and added the meat. I also added the wine before the simmer. It was very good.

I really liked this minus the sour cream and white wine at the end. My 10 year old daughter rated it 9/10 and my 16 year old son rated it 6/10. Next time I am going to leave out the sour cream and wine. The sauce was better before adding it

I cooked this a little differently from the author.  I browned the meat in 3 tbs. butter then put the meat in the slow cooker; cooked the mushrooms separately in 3 tbsp. butter until they were brown (about 5/6 minutes) put on top of the meat in slow cooker.  Used large can of little onions, drained and into the slow cooker. Then I made the sauce separately as directed and dumped in slow cooker. Slow cooker on low 5 hours.  Added in white wine last 30 minutes.  Then dumped in the noodles (half cooked) and let them soak up the sauce for 10 minutes while making bread and salad.  Turned off slow cooker and added sour cream at the very end. Put lid back on for 3 minutes to let it warm.   Don't clean the pan in between cooking the meat and mushrooms.  Just add in the butter at the end and cook the flour for 5 minutes until it's golden then add the tomato paste. Let that get hot, then add the garlic and use half red wine/beef broth to deglaze the pan.  All those bits are what gives the dish so much flavor.

We made this exactly as the recipe was written. It’s a little bland but it isn’t bad. I agree with some others, it needs a little more beef flavor, maybe more beef stock. I’m not sure! I ended up adding a little more salt to my dish when it was done and that helped a little bit.

Husband and I enjoyed it.  I’m sure I will fix again, however, due to the prep involved probably won’t fix very often.  Also needed some salt and pepper to taste.

I made this recipe but used ground beef (my husband just had oral surgery and couldn't handle chewy meat) I added a little cinnamon to the meat while I was browning it.  My husband loved it!!

Made Nana’s Beef Stroganoff with all the ingredients as listed, but cooked it in a slightly different sequence and methods as to not overlook the meat. The flavors of the ingredients were amazing!

I made this last night. I followed the recipe mostly. I used the beef stock needed. it still did not have enough beef flavor so next time I will use bullion cubes in addition to the beef stock.

Great dish, cooking time is depending on the beef and how much you're working on the flavors. The cut of Sirloin I bought was ready in 20, but I wanted the garlic and onion to Fuze all of their flavors together. I enjoy a spicier flacor, so I threw in a dried chili pepper into the simmer. I also cut back on the sour cream to a 1/2 cup. I like the savory and the Uma I with a little less bite of the sour cream. All in all, a good basic recipe to make your own.

I used ground beef only because it was what I had in freezer and I didn’t want to go to the store. This was excellent stroganoff even without the steak. I’ll have to try it w steak next week

I love this recipe. Not only delicious, but the tomato paste adds a beautiful color to the dish that you normally don't get. This is quickly becoming a family tradition in my own family.

We enjoyed this.  At the same time, think we prefer this dish without the tomato past better.  Made enough for about 6-8 servings.

As I did not have a full cup of sour cream so I topped up the cup with plain Greek yogurt. Also did not add the white wine. The sauce was nice and thick, The meat very tender as I had let it simmer 2 1/2 hours. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika for a little zip. Hubby said it was very tasty. I would make this again without a doubt.

Taste delicious. Takes a bit of time to make, but worth it. I used a tiny bit more wine to compensate for a little extra meat. And another note, I only used 1 1/2 tsp of the red pepper flakes and I'm glad I did, next time I will only use 1 tsp. and I do like spicy, but 1 tsp. would be enough for my taste. Would make this again!

In my opinion, this is the only stroganoff recipe worth making.  It's incredibly easy, you can even make with ground beef, and tomato paste is so yummy in it.  And it doesn't use those canned soups!  We like it, and I double the onions and garlic and don't use the mushrooms for the kids.  Tonight I also added black beans - interesting addition, not bad.  Oh, and I used port for the wine ---mmmmmmm.

So delicious!! Two things to add... #1) didn't use wine, just I increased stock and #2) next time I think I'll make smaller slivers of the beef.

This was amazing! The only "tweaks" I made was to use ground beef (because it needed to be used) and chicken broth with a couple of teaspoons of beef bullion granules. Delicious and simple! This recipe is.a keeper.

Great stroganoff recipe. Used Sprouts organic beef broth instead of stock (great flavor) and sliced very thin leftover medium rare London broil for the meat. Because the meat was already cooked, I threw it into the pan with the mushrooms and onion when those were nearly done.  I only simmered for a half-hour and meat was incredibly tender.  My partner said it was good, and then corrected himself and said "very good." P.S. I garnished with sliced green onion but parsley would have worked great, too. UPDATE: Had a little trouble with an overpowering tomato sauce  taste. Next time I would use just 1 Tbs and go from there.

This was very tasty, but add some paprika and parsley to the sauce.  Also, thicken up the sauce before adding the sour cream and wine.

Just the right amount of tomato paste and sour cream. I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and topped the finished dish with fresh snipped chives.

Excellent.  I didn't use any wine and it still tasted great.  I was worried that simmering with sliced mushrooms in there would disintegrate them so I put them in after I blended the meat back in to the sauce, then simmered for an hour.  Perfect.

There was way too much flour for me. I did use organic wheat flour, maybe that was to 'dense' otherwise nice taste - will try again ...

Used golden mushroom soup instead of making sauce.  Used everything else and it came out very good.  Almost a 5 rating.

Very good stroganoff recipe. The only thing I did differently was add the white wine just before I turned it down to a simmer. Portabella mushrooms stand up well. This is the first review I have ever done. Have used this website often. Sometimes just as a starting point. If I make a LOT of changes I won't rate it because it is not the same recipe. It's not fair to the one who submits it. Rather than listing all your changes, I would suggest you submit as a new recipe ??

I have never made stroganoff.  Even the chef classes I took in the military we never made it so I was a little nervous.  I fell back on my training and changed the recipe a little.  I used a high end roast that I cut up.  Double the recipe because of the amount of meat.  Added cracked pepper, cayenne, parsley, extra butter, the juice from the mushrooms, two dashes of oregano, and I didnt have tomato paste so I subbed with stewed tomato juice.  I almost forgot, I used 10 spring onions greens included and because I love garlic I doubled it and it didn't drown out the taste of every thing else when mixed together.  My grandson is extremely picky as an eater due to Asperger's and his comment was "there will be leftovers, right?"  i have tried stroganoff several times and never liked it.  But this OMG the food of the gods LOL.  Just mad that my stomach can't hold much.  I am going to freeze several meals to attack at my leisure.  Thank you for the recipe absolutely great.

This is so simple but yummy. I did add some spices to the flour before coating the meat paprika, onion powder, garlic powder (omitted the fresh garlic) and the salt and black pepper. After browning the meat and sautéing the onion I put those into a lined crock pot then cooked the flour I used the flour left over from dredging  and deglazed the skillet with red wine and added the broth. Didn't have tomato paste so I used ketchup instead. Added it to the crock pot and cooked on low for 2 1/2 hours. It turned out delicious! Thank you!

Delicious and easy to prepare. Only thing is the sauce turned out too thick so I think I'll either use less flour or more cream at the end. Surely different that than the usual one I used to prepare but equally tasty.

Simple and delicious!This recipe is great and it came out wonderful. I was thinking that for next time to add red wine instead of white, and maybe a little balsamic vinegar as someone else suggested. I served it over aborrio rice and it was just perfect on a cold day. The only thing I did was add the white wine to my rue so that the alcohol burns off, it did take about 20 minutes for my sauce to start to bubble, but you can increase the heat a bit more and continue stirring so long as it doesn't boil. I covered it for the 2 hours it was simmering but it was rather watery, so I left it to simmer and reduce without the lid for another 30-45 minutes and it was perfectly creamy!  Test for salt, you may need to add a bit to taste. I also loved the sour cream in it but a friend recommended horse radish if you want to give that a try. Over all, wonderful and I will be making again!

Honest to god it was as if I was propelled back 35+ years!  I have been trying to replicate my mothers Stroganoff for years with little success.   This recipe  has nailed it!!  If you have children I highly recommend you double it.  My 11 year old & husband went back for 3 helpings.

This is my husband's favorite meal so I tried this recipe. He said it was good but was more tangy than he is used to and likes. (He likes it more "mushroomy".) I THINK it was the wine but not certain. Will look for another recipe.

This was really good.  I added the wine early on like many of the other reviewers and also added a touch of Penzey's Bavarian Seasoning to give it just a little richer flavor. This spice blend includes crushed brown mustard, rosemary, garlic, thyme, bay leaf and sage.

Lovely recipe!  The tomato paste browns the sauce, nicely.  Don't be afraid of the sauce browning/sticking to the bottom of the pan.  It de-glazes perfectly when you add the sour cream and white wine.  Suggestion: use two large portabella mushroom caps chopped into 1 in pieces.  They will hold up better for extended cooking.  I only cooked this for 45-1 hour before adding the sour cream/wine and serving.  It was perfect!  Thank you, Nana...

I couldn't find my mom's recipe, so I was looking for one that was similar. Found it! This is exactly how I grew up eating stroganoff. Creamy and rich. The white wine really brings out the flavors in the sirloin and mushrooms.

This is a very nice stroganoff. We added the wine to the flour/tomato paste mixture, followed by the broth.  Also added a little more water to thin it out a bit while it cooked and a dash of thyme.  Nice dinner.

Get the butcher to run your meat through the tenderizer a few times to break down the fat. This cuts your cooking time to one hour.  Also I used Campbells Beef Consomme instead of stock. It is really delish!

This was really good.  I didn't feel like babysitting it on the stove for 2-3 hours so I popped it in the oven in a covered casserole dish for about an hour.  I added the white wine and sour cream and put it back in for another 30-ish minutes.  Worked great

I followed the recipe exactly and it was awful! I think that it was mainly a lack of seasoning.  It just didn't taste like anything. Sorry.

Had to substitute turkey and turkey stock for the beef and beef stock, but otherwise followed the recipe. It will be my go-to recipe for stroganoff.  Thanks!

Excellent flavor. I used beef stew meat, as I had it on hand and canned mushrooms (again, had them on hand). I only simmered for an hour, as I cooked the meat through during browning. 

I kept tasting it through the entire cooking process and by the time the meal actually came together I was full! I will be making this again. Very good.

My husband loved this! I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and included the white wine.I used leftover sirloin beef roast and let the flavors meld for 1 hour. Also added a few dashes of cayenne pepper and served over egg noodles..... Delish!!

This was easy and delicious.  I used white balsamic vinegar in place of the wine, which added a nice flavor, and is of course made with wine,  but I only used a good couple of splashes, and did this before the simmer, not after.  I added water every now and then as needed.  I only simmered for an hour, but it was sirloin, and very tender.  I only had canned mushrooms so that's what I used, but fresh would have been better.   I will definitely make this again.

I picked up a small sirloin steak but it wasn't enough for the two of us. I let it tenderize a couple of days before making this and used all of the ingredients. I even used my own homemade beef stock. Becaue the meat was tender to begin with, this only took about 2 hours on a very low flame. My husband and I inhaled it and there was only a small portion left. Only two things I changed were 1 tblsp of tubed tomato paste and 1 tblsp of ketchup and about 2 tsps of dijon mustard before simmering it. Didn't need the wine, because the stock had wine in it. This was fab and we'll keep this recipe to make it again. Thanks for posting.
