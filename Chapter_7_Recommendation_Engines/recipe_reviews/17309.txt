Wonderful flavor. We added just a splash of amaretto liquer (just a splash, it's strong and too much will permeate the drink) to perfect this recipe. We didn't "slush" it (I only like that in daquaris), but rather, poured everything over a generous glass of crushed ice. Add the grenadine first and the alcohol last, and the color of the drink will look like a fading sunset. This is the perfect summer drink for relaxing after work or on weekends.

This is SO good!!! I put 3 ice cubes in a shaker with the other ingredients and shook it up and served it over the ice instead of blending it together. I did double the recipe and I would call that one serving. It is also great with Dole's Orange Peach & Mango juice in place of the o.j. and pineapple juice. YUM!

WOW!  Yumm-y!  I took another poster's advice and used the Dole orange-pineapple-banana juice and it was perfect.  What a great way to enjoy a summer evening.

Yum Yum! I've been obsessed with getting my hands on a Bahama Mama,  but just too lazy to make it :P I tried this recipe out and it was really good. I used Bacardi and Malibu for the rum and Dole's Orange and Pineapple Juice. :) I do like to add a little more Malibu and orange juice to mine. Thanks for the recipe!

As written, this cocktail was pretty bland to me. Personally, I needed to increase the liquor quantities and add a little sugar. Then it came out pretty good.

As made (using coconut liqueur as I had no coconut rum), DH rated it a 3--too sweet.  I loved it as it so reminded me of some of the cruises I've gone on.  Omitting the grenadine syrup, DH rated it a 3.5.  I liked it both ways.  Beware, 2 drinks OK...3 maybe...but better slow down with the 4th!

Very good!  To save time, Skip the blender and ice and just throw these into a freezer-safe pitcher and freeze overnight.  I make a similar bahama mama recipe for parties and freeze a huge cooler full of them.  No blending, no ice and they come out perfect every time! Depending on the size of the batch I make, I always check on them in the morning to see if they need time to thaw a little, but it saves alot of time and aggrevation of dealing with a blender!  I also add a bag of Dole frozen fruit(peaches/mango/pineapple) to them!

This drink is absolutely delicious and deserves five stars on any hot summer day! I lessened the amount of grenadine and placed it in a shaker to get the top really white and frothy, and then enjoyed it in a tall glass over ice. It was perfect!

Awesome...at first I tried the orange/pineapple/banana juice combo that others had used but absolutley did not care for the banana in it so made it exactly as the recipe states but doubled the liquor (I like my drinks with some bite). I used cups instead of ouces and made a batch to put in the frig. Even good the next day.  Definately a keeper, just will use the recommended amount of booze for a gathering....could scare people! Nice summery flavor :)

This drink was easy to make, refreshing, and tasted great. I used the dole pineapple, orange, banana juice to make it easier & save room in my fridge. I think that if you use pineapple juice & OJ it might have a stronger fruity taste than the dole juice. I will definetly be making this all summer long. thanks!

I switched out the plain rum for dark rum and sometimes spiced rum. Using regular pale rum, is not quite the way I like them.

One word: Delicious!  I've been 21 years old for less than a year- so I can't say that I've had a lot of drink types since becoming legal- but I enjoyed a virgin Bahama Mama in the carribbean a few years ago and fell in love with it.  It was the first legal drink I enjoyed as well, and I just decided to try my hand at making them myself. This recipe is top-notch, however I did substitute the plain rum for some pineapple rum.  I will deffinitely be making these again... and soon!

Great tasting recipe AS WRITTEN. I tried this at first using the Dole Orange Pineapple Banana juice that others suggested and it did not taste right. That banana threw the whole thing off for me...However I tried it again today following the ingredients as listed and it tastes great! Much better!

Great reviews from my Memorial Day gang.  I made them by the pitcher so guests could easily serve themselves over cubed ice.  I reduced the amount of grenadine by half because the "test" drinks were way too sweet.  Also used Dole orange/pineapple juice.  I always have a signature cocktail for Memorial Day and this is the best so far.

Very good!  I used a shot of both rums, a shot of grenadine two shot fulls of o.j. and dole pineapple-orange-banana and two cups of crushed ice.  PERFECT size drink.  I could see this being dangerous.....

I like this cocktail. Wonderful tropical flavor. Of course, it is necessary to use fresh pineapple and orange juice.

This  is pretty close to how you are suppose to make a Bahama Mama , But you are suppose to use 1 part light rum, 1 part coconut rum, 1/2 part grenadine, 2 parts orange juice , 2 parts pineapple juice and blend in a blender. You can pour over ice or add ice if you want a slushy type drink. This how they make it in the Bahamas.  Substitute the word part with oz , cup ,pint or whatever.

Delicious flavor but not slushy at all following the recipe directions. Maybe because our ice is regular size and not crushed. Next time I will add more ice so it is thick and frozen.

A bit strong, but tasted as good as a cocktail you would get at a bar. The real thing! You definately have to double the ingredients for a single drink, though.

It was good, but I didn't find it as good as many of the other reviews said. It seemed to be missing something, but I don't know what.

This drink was a big hit during the summer....I used Dole Pineapple/Orange Juice in the refrigerated section because I do not like the taste of juice from a can....This is a definate keeper!

A great and very popular tropical drink. Traditionally, you add creme de banana to it but the banana rum would be a cheaper alternative (2 bottles vs. 3). That's the joy of tropical drinks...you can modify them to your own personal liking! And everyone likes an escape to the islands from time to time...even if it IS mentally with an umbrella drink in hand!~

Excellent, very tropical drink. I found this recipe a few weeks ago and have made it several times since.  I originally made it using the blender, but now prefer it on the rocks.

Next time I am going to cut down on the ice.
I might try 1/2 cup of ice.

I like mine "on the rocks" so I don't blend it all together, but serve on ice, instead.  Great mix/blend of ingredients, wonderful taste.  Love it!  Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed these over rocks, with a tad less grenadine and a tad more coconut rum.  Very nice and "islandy".

I don’t add the ice so when I make it it’s not a frozen drink. I serve it over ice so it turns out to be a little stronger and then I throw in a dark rum floater right before serving. Everybody loves these!

I made this for a party just mixed a large batch in a pitcher, stirred and put in the fridge to chill.   Used Blue Chair Bay Coconut and white rum.  Served over ice instead of mixing in blender - this was just easier for a large group.   Everyone loved it the drink was a big hit!

Delicious!  I used the Dole - orange/pineapple mixed juice and I have also used the Dole - orange/banana/strawberry mixed juice.  Also, use a little less syrup.    Everyone that has tried these - has liked them.  Even the 'boys'!

Very good!  Unfortunately I didn't have any coconut rum, so I just doubled the spiced rum and I thought it still had great flavor.  I don't love slushy bahama mama's, so I just mixed it together in my cocktail shaker and then poured it over ice.  I would definitely make this again!  Excited to try it again with the coconut rum and the orange pineapple banana juice that some reviewers mentioned.

I've had this before but prefer a Malibu Bay Breeze - Malibu Rum, Pineapple juice, and cranberry juice.  Delicious!  The suggestion to make this with the Dole orange/pineapple/banana juice sounds yummy too.  Gotta try that one.

Fantastic!!!  Just like we had when we were in the Bahamas..Don't add any sugar, if you want is sweeter just put in a splash more of the grenadine.  I have been looking for this recipe since we returned from our trip.  Took a WHOLE bunch to a party, it was the a hit!!!  Thank you so very much :) and my family and friends thank you too..

Really great, I'm no bartender, so I've tried making this without a spice rum, and when you add it,it's completely different and so much better!! I like to serve mine over ice rather than blend it, but that's preference. Must make this one!!

It's pretty good but I think next time I will use a little less pineapple juice. I had the juices here so that is what I used. Next time I will try the Dole Orange-Pineapple juice. But it's a keeper.

I love this recipe!! I mix up a big batch of them and then pour it into the single serve plastic Ocean Spray bottles and put them in the freezer overnite before a beach/boat outing.  Drop them down in the ice chest the next day and you have a slushy yummy drink with just the twist of a cap!! YUMMY!!! Making a big batch tonight for a beach trip with the gfs tomorrow!!

Good! Next time though I will add a little more O.J. and less pineapple juice. I served over the rocks.  Next time I will try it with the crushed ice.

Very good. Also drank this on the rocks. Used Capri Sun since I didn't have any orange juice and it was quite tasty. I can see making a huge pitcher of these for a party. Pretty color to boot.

These drinks were pretty good - recently came back from the Dominican and they tasted exactly like the way they made them there.  Next time I'd probably increase the coconut rum and decrease the ice but overall, was a very good recipe.

VERY good!! I served these at a "ladies night" party last week, everyone loved them! I added a bit more coconut rum to make them more tropical. They reminded me of Hawaiian Punch. WARNING: make sure you get the BIG bottles of rum!!! You won't want to stop with just one!!
