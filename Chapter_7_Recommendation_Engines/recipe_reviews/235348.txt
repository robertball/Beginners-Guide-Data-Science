Very disappointing.  My ramekins were too small, so I made this cobbler in a small rectangular glass loaf pan.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.   The cobbler turned out rather stodgy, (heavy).  The flavours were very good, but the texture of the cake part was not. 
I will probably try the savoury flavour combination with peaches .... in a different recipe.

Probably won't be able to have regular old Peach cobbler again thanks to this recipe. :)

I really enjoyed the addition of fresh basil, and the parmesan was nice as well. I'm not so sure about the pepper though. I suspect the grind on my pepper mill was set too course because some bites were quite potent with black pepper!

Great flavor combo that I wouldn't think of on my own. 
The dough came out a little chewy but otherwise everyone loved it!

7-31-15 Different, liked it, would make it again and would try to cut back on the amount of butter. For an odd combination of ingredients it was good.

interesting taste, not bad but not terrific either. MUST use elf rising flour, otherwise, a lump of dough.
