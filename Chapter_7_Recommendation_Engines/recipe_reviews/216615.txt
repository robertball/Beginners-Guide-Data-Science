It's getting cold, stew weather! I guess the double secret step for this is to grind the bay leaves, picking out the main stems, couple peppercorns or pinch of coarse salt helps the grinding along.

I wasn't sure what to make of the cumin and the cinnamon...they changed the flavor that enough with the bay leaf it was hit or miss with my crowd.

This was great!  I've been looking for an alternative to traditional beef/venison flavours and this fits the bill.  I didn't have any rosemary but  it didn't taste like it was lacking anything without it.  We had it with home-made bread and hubby and I really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this using black wildebeest, left out the cumin add I didn't have, added corn and peas, it came out devine.. you could taste the wildebeest with the flavors coming out properly and not ruining the meat itself.. I'm doing this again with winter coming.. lovely

This is a really good stew, with all the flavors of the spices. I did change it because it was a little bitter. I added a 1/3 cup of Heinz ketchup, and another tablespoon of brown sugar.
