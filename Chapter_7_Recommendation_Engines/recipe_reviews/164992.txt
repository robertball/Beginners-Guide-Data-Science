Definitely cheesy and easy as the recipe states - my niece loved it and it was a nice change from the regular 'ol hot dog in a bun.  I just don't know why kids love hot dogs so much but if you can think of a creative way for them to eat them  - why not? All it needed was plenty of ketchup for dipping and she was happy.

I like to wrap a tortilla around a hot dog or sausage, secure with a toothpick ,spray with no-stick spray, toast in a skillet then enjoy with honey mustard:)

Family loved them.  Make sure y ou use 6" white flour tortillas. I used 10" Whole Wheat and I think it would have been better the other way.

This is great! A better alternative to hot dog buns. I use spinach flavored wraps, something I usually have on hand. This couldn't be simplier for a lunch!

After an extremely busy day at work, I needed to scarf something down ASAP just to get something in my stomach. This fit the bill perfectly- super fast, tasty, and filling (I had two). This is a keeper for the emergency "gotta eat something NOW" days. Thanks.

I didn't like this as much as I thought I would.  The hot dog bun is still the best way...

Thanks!  This was a nice change from a hot dog bun.  I used swiss instead of American.

This is a must on our camping trips, we add chilli, shredded cheese, hotdog then wrap in tortilla, fold up one end like a burrito and wrap in foil, you can cook over the grill until done.

Super simple snack and great for times you don't have any buns. Next time I will add some chili and onions to the mix for extra flavor.

Quick and simple way to prepare a hot dog, and that is what I needed tonight.  Liked the alternative to using a hot dog bun.  This was served with 'Fancy Franks' and 'Thin Spaghetti with Garlic, Red Pepper and Olive Oil' both from AR.

Had this for lunch today since I didn't have any hot dog buns on hand. I used shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese instead of American cheese (I don't like American sliced cheese). It was alright. It's a good alternative if you don't have hot dog buns, but I still prefer hot dog buns over tortillas. It tastes good enough for me to make it again if I don't have the buns.

This was an easy quick thing to make when you're really hungry and don't have time to make something fancy. I tried it with mozza cheese as that's all I had on hand and it was good. I didn't like dipping it in the ketchup, I think it tasted better by itself. thanks for the recipe!

My sisters and I ate these growing up.  We called them "Pup in a Poncho" instead of a hot dog roll up.  These are very simple and quick to put together.

Necessity is the mother of invention. My tortillas were too large, so I just cut two hot dogs in half lengthwise and laid them on the tortilla side by side, along with mustard and grated cheese, and folded the tortilla in half. Still just as good for an easy lunch. I did cut the final product in half for easier handling.
