Great easy recipe. Will try different fruit varieties as well. Have a canned cherry pie filling with fresh mango in the oven right now. Quick adjustments; make double the crumb topping and also do not melt the butter for the crumb topping. Cut the butter into the flour and sugar or else you will get a paste rather than crumbs.

I used stevia instead of sugar. It turned out very good! Next time I'll try cherry pie filling.

To begin with, I made my own pie filling.....a lot more fruit and not nearly so much 'filler' as store bought pie fillings.  The only other change I made was baking these in a muffin pan rather than cake tin.  Flavor was great and definitely will try these with other fruit as well.  If you are going to do these in a muffin tin, make sure you cut your baking time nearly in half.  Also, use muffin papers in order to help with clean up later. This recipe gave me 12 good sized muffins.

I loved this recipe. I made it this morning for my family and there was only one small piece left of it! I will the next time double the crumble topping, and will not add the fresh blueberries. Very good recipe!!!

It was okay - needed nuts or oatmeal in streusel to have some crunch & topping just sat in top of the cake. Probably wonâ€™t make this again

Definitely will make it for Christmas morning.  Easy to make ahead and serve warmed up with whipped cream, ice cream or yoghurt.  Would NOT serve 12, more like 6 or 8....1 piece is not enough.
I did make more crumble, but I only had an 8x8 pan, so probably didn't need to.  So little batter, so much pie filling , but it came out perfect.

Very good flavor. The addition of lemon extract makes this recipe. I doubled the fresh blueberries and it was great.
