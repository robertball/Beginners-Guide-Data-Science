If you have to dirty another dish to put in oven, it is not really an Instant Pot dish.

Loved it. Didn't peal my potatoes. I set my IP on meat for 11 min total. I forgot to put the weight on the lid but when I checked they were done. Used 2% milk and came out delicious.

This was so easy to make and it turned out delicious. Followed recipe as written. End results were creamy, cheesy potatoes in no time at all. Super recipe!

I sliced 2 small onions, then layered them in the pressure cooker.  I also added about 1/2cup whipping cream to potatoes before I broiled.  I used 2 c shredded jack cheese, and about 2 Tblsp butter on bottom of pan.

I didn't have evaporated milk so I used some cream and half and half.  Also, I sprinkled some cheese on top before I broiled it.  Delish!

Wow, this was so easy and yummy.  My tweeks at my altitude (6500 ft), 1 minute for the pressure, 3 minutes release time.  Otherwise the potatoes were very over-cooked and almost mushy.  Also, I am not a fan of canned mil so I substituted half and half and milk, 1/4 c each.  I made two batches for a potluck this evening, so I had a chance to try the 5 minute release and a 3 minute release.

No more boxes of potatoes - this only took about 30 minutes including peeling the potatoes!

Delicious and fast! Great recipe! The only suggestion I have is to use your toilet on high, not low. I didnâ€™t get any of the nice browning on the potatoes until I turned the broiler up to high.

Very easy, but pay attention to the times. I forgot to set my timer and I overlooked the potatoes however my guests loved this dish, I will definitely make it again

This recipe turned out even better than I thought it would; it had the consistency of mashed potatoes with very large chunks.  The ultimate comfort food!
Mods: I used 3-4 TBL of fresh snipped parsley.  For the cheese I used 1 cup of Great Value fine shred mixed cheddar and 1/2 cup of GV fine shred Fiesta cheese (which is about 33% cheddar).  The recipe mentions doing a quick release for 5 minutes.  I did a very slow quick release for about 7 minutes so perhaps that's why mine came out halfway to mashed potato consistency.  But honestly, that mushier consistency is what sets this recipe apart!
