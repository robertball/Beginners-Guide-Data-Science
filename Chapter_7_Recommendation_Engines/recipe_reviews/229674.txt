This was a great addition to our Valentine's dinner. I made it with raspberry jello instead of cherry, but I think any red jello would work.  I might add a little more water as it was a bit sweet.  Otherwise very tasty.

This is a great substitute for plain old cranberry at the Thanksgiving table, and everyone loves it. In fact, they go hunting in the fridge for it the next day before the ‘heavy’ foods are even given a second thought.
