I've been making a version of this for years.  Instead of dry ranch dressing mix I use about a cup of ranch salad dressing and omit the milk.  Also I add a half can of french fried onions mixed in, bake covered for 20-30 minutes at 350 then sprinkle the rest on top and bake un covered another 10 minutes or until the chops are done and the onions have crisped up.  Also, the remaining sauce is great as topping to baked potatoes. Warning..this in NOT a low fat/calorie dish!

In a house of 6 it is very hard to find things that someone does not fuss about.  Well I found something in this.  Everyone in the house loved it!  My family told me that this is going to be a keeper recipe.  I did cook regular rice and put some of the ranch packet in the rice, not to mention if you are going to use the sauce as a "gravy" you may want to double the recipe.

This is one of my go-to staple comfort foods I make when I either low on time or in a funk and need something warm and familiar. I suggest that you use a homemade ranch dressing mix, sans salt, as the soup is salty enough on it's own. I mix ranch dressing mix with plain AP flour, coat the pork chops in the flour/ranch mixture and then fry them on both sides. I then saute an onion and chopped mushrooms in butter and then add the soup and milk to make the sauce. EDITED: I made this again tonight, adding a little worchestershire sauce and a touch of sour cream. I layered the pork chops in a baking dish and covered it with sauce and baked it for an hour until it was all fall-aparty. I served it with fluffy rice and steamed broccoli. Again, everyone loved it. HUGE success. NO leftovers.

This made pork chops GOOD food again! I can't give 5 stars since I adjusted... I fried 4 strips of bacon first, retained the bacon on the side and dumped out all bu 1 Tbsp of the drippings. Fried the chops in THAT instead of plain vegetable oil. I also added 1 Tbsp of minced garlic and used only 1/8 cup of milk, then substituted regular ranch dressing instead of the packet. This was a HUGE hit at my house and goes in the permanent file.

My husband and I love this recipe! I made it once using prepared ranch dressing and the other time using the dried mix and both ways were great (the powder has more zip to it). I make mashed potatoes as a side and use the gravy on the potatoes. This one will be a regular at our house!

This recipe was great.  I used regular pork chops nothing thick.  I coated my chops in Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese and garlic powder.   Fried them up and followed the rest of the recipe.  It was wonderful.  Kids and hubby gobbled it up.  Thanks for sharing.

Supremely easy and quick weeknight meal that pleased everyone. Just what a busy night called for. While I can't fathom using canned cream soup, I was appreciative of the idea, so thank you for that, Campbell's! I used a homemade version of cream soup which I make up in bulk and keep on hand in the freezer. I also used a home made ranch mix. The pork was tender and the sauce flavorful and creamy. Loved the 'ranch rice' as well.

QUICK & EASY.  threw it all in the oven to save the fat from browning the chops.  pretty basic flavor, but very satisfying.  i will make again, especially when feeling lazy or pressed for time.

These pork chops were a huge disappointment.  I made them exactly as the recipe called for, except that I added a little more ranch seasoning, and even then, they were tasteless.  The pork chops came out chewy, and it was just an extremely boring recipe.  Tasted processed.

This was a very good comfort food. It was easy to put together with flavorful results. I used a package of 4 pork loin chops, which I seared in a little olive oil seasoned with Hawaiian sea salt and balck pepper with one clove of garlic and ranch dressing mix.  I mixed the dressing with the can cream of mushroom soup and threw in one sliced russet potatoes with a dash of Worchestershire sauce for more flavor.  Towards the end I threw in some sweet peas for color, taste and nutrition. The creamy mushroom sauce was so scrumptious and not too thick, with the sweet peas, tender moist pork and potatoes. I smothered the sauce all over the rice and it made for a creamy, enjoyable meal. Perfectly flavored over hot steaming rice!

The ranch pack gave great flavor to the pork chops. I make a similar recipe with chicken which calls for 1 can soup to 1 can evaporated milk: with only half a can milk in here, the sauce tastes too much like canned soup and the texture isn't so creamy. With one can each soup, milk, and half a ranch pack this is a definite repeat recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.

Great recipe.  Very easy.  Instead of adding seasoning/soup/milk straight to the pan, I mix it all up in a bowl and add a small can of sliced mushrooms then pour it all over the chops.

This is very nice.I used some creamy dill ranch dressing in bottle since I never buy the dry mix stuff. I just eyeballed it but I would say I used like 1 Tbsp or so. I also used pork tenderloin  instead of chops and when it was time to serve I just cut them in medallions and spooned some gravy on top. Served with butter and brown sugar carrots and some dill ranch baby potatoes.

This is a family favorite in our house.  After making it several times, I stopped adding the ranch to the rice.  Instead, I double the cream of mushroom soup and milk and add the whole packet of ranch to it.  I just serve over plain rice.  We like the gravy!

This was very good.  Made is with a can of Cream of Onion soup as I had never heard of it  before and wanted to try but I'm sure Cream of Mushroom is good too.  Made mashed potatoes and used this sauce as the gravy as well.

I made this for dinner with the only changes - used cream of celery soup instead beccause that's all I had on hand and also I did it with actual ranch dressing about 2-3 Tablespoons because I didn't have the packaged on hand either. It was amazing!! My husband loved it! As did my 16 month old although the pork chops were tough for her to chew. Note: don't leave out the paprika. It really makes the dish!!

The recipe was simple and the sauce was even pretty good , although it tasted a bit salty to me.  I think maybe cooking this in a slowcooker would be better to make the pork very tender.  I am just not a big fan of pork, so this didn't impress me much.  However, my husband and son liked it.  so I met in the middle.

For quick and easy I give this 10 stars. I do not advise these to be eaten as leftovers otherwise they are very very salty. Must be eaten the same day. I had 4 bone in pork chops but otherwise I followed exactly. I did double the recipe though and served with minute white rice. If you love ranch, u must try these!!! KEEPER!

These were really good. The sauce is amazing. Next time I won't use pork chops that thick. Other than that my Husband and I loved them.

For what this is - pork chops browned in oil, with a few  canned and packet whatnots thrown in - this is a decent meal. I had zero time to cook tonight but also needed to use up some pork chops that had prematurely thawed in my broken freezer. This was ok.

This is almost like a recipe I got from my mother-in-law years ago.  After the pork chops are browned, add 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of milk or water and 1 cup of instant rice.  Bake in oven at 350 for 40 min.  Yummy!  Very simply.  Not sure what I think of the ranch flavor being added.

Quick meal for busy weeknight.  A little on the salty side, but I used regular cream of mushroom.  Next time would use the lower sodium.

Made It tonight.  Substituted cream of chicken for the mushroom and can I just say yum. It didn't take very long.  I did use just 90 sec microwave rice.  Will be making again.

I made these tonight for a chicken loving family and 1 of the 3 LOVED them.  The other two ate them, but still wished I'd made chicken.  This was a very easy recipe and for someone who has just begun to experiment with new recipes for meat, it was nice to have it turn out exactly as planned.  So, I still gave it a good rating, because the prob. wasn't in the recipe.  Will try with chicken next time.  Thank you!

We liked this a lot! I'm new to cooking so I overcooked the chops a little bit.  One thing I did differently was I cooked some rice in a seperate container until it was almost done, then I added it to the pan with the sauce and chops and let it all simmer together for another ten minutes.  This will be in our rotation now!

Great recipe! I thought the ranch would overpower the pork chops, but that wasn't the case at all. The husband said it was fantastic! So it's a keeper : ) Just make sure you keep your chops nice and moist and you have a winner. I paired it with mashed potatoes and had lots of gravy!

The pork chops turned out good and tender.  As for the sauce, i hardly tasted the ranch flavor in it.  It was kind of a waste if you ask me...

Yum, yum, yum !  My hubby and I loved these chops.  I didn't have the 3/4 inch boneless but had 1/2 inch boneless and the flavor was wonderful.  I think you could use boneless chicken breasts and get a wonderful result.

I changed, sorry, but what I had on hand was ranch dressing mixed with creme fraiche as a dip, so I put 1/2 cup of that and used hot water (instead of milk) mixed with a pork buillon cube.  I also quartered several mushrooms and stirred into soup/ranch mix... it was very yummy.  Hubby and mother-in-law raved...I never thought ranch and cream of mushroom soup would work, but it does!

I made my own version of this just recently. was looking thru recipes for chicken, w/ ranch dressing. mine is 6 chicken breasts, boneless, skinless, 1 cup fat free ranch dressing, marinate chicken for about 1 hour. then heat skillet , put chicken WITH marinade , saute til done. remove chicken , keep warm. add 1 tablespoon capers, drained, crushed, about 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, and 1 can mushrooms. ( or use fresh)  1 tablespoon real butter, cook and stir til it thickens, add chicken back into skillet, cover, heat through. and serve. My own recipe I just made up on a whim. Everyone loved it! I have made this several times now, and always get raves . have given the recipe to several who requested . I can't wait to try with pork chops.

This was sooo good! My husband loved it...he went on and on about it. I didn't use the big porkchops. I found some scallopini porkchops and used those and it worked just fine. I also didn't use the packet in my porkchops, but used the packet in my water for my rice.  The only complaint I have is that the recipe for the ranch rice was hard to find. I couldn't find it on this site and ended up having to google it. I did find it though.  GREAT RECIPE! :) Still eating it right now.

I thought that this dish was really easy to make and very yummy. i put the ranch mix on the pork, lightly browned, Removed them and mixed the soup. I used 2 cans of fat free soup, I then put the pork back into the pot and let them finish cooking. I did make the ranch rice which had no flavor so next time i wouldn't even bother. I had made extra sauce so i could use it with the rice. My son, grandma and myself LOVED it and it was really easy. Will definetly make again. Easy way to cook pork and a nice change.

We double the sauce as we do with all cambell's recipes and probably we could have gotten away with not doing that on this one. The sauce was my favorite part though so I didn't mind having extra! My kids cleared their plates but my husband thought that the sauce tasted too much like the soup and not enough like anything else. Quick and easy though.

Good, but very average. I prefer my food to have a good color, not a brownish muck look. It was a tad salty... but still edible. I would make this again in a pinch, but I also would not serve this to company!

My family really loved this dish.  I used the rest of the ranch dressing mix in the rice and cooked it in the rice cooker with a little butter.  Everyone was pleased!!

Not bad at all! Simple and quick as far as the ingredients go - made it for dinner with my mother-in-law and she liked it. She's a fantastic cook, so I took that as a good thing.  I'll make it again.

Added sauted onions and mushrooms turned out delicious . The sauce was very creamy served over biscuits. Also served with rice and broccoli.

We loved this recipe. I followed the recipe, only I simmered the pork chops an hour. The meat was moist and very tender.

The chops, the gravy, and the rice were very tasty.  Contrary to many of the reviews, we had plenty of gravy without doubling it.  The chops were pretty tough though.  I had hoped they'd be a little more tender with the simmering in the gravy.  Thus the 4 instead of 5 stars.

I found this recipe today and made it today. It's easy and very tasty. I followed the recipe as written. I made it with some quick instant mashed potatoes and some candied carrots.  The "gravy" was perfect.  I'll definitely make it again, maybe with some chicken.

This was very easy to make but needed a little bit more seasoning. To spice it up a bit I added smoked paprika. That made the dish more flavorful.

I made using 4 boneless pork chops, I doubled the seasonings but not the Parmesan and Ranch dressing portions.  It was really good, pork was tender and we had left over "sauce" we can use with simple egg noodles some night !  I made Parmesan baked potato wedges as a side.  Definitely a keeper recipe for us !

I modified the  recipe somewhat .  I browned 6 pork chops then  sauteed mushrooms with butter and a little Worcestershire sauce.  I cooked brown rice and put it in the bottom of a casserole dish.  I topped the rice with the pork chops, mushrooms, and a sauce consisting of 2 cans of mushroom soup, one can of milk, and a bit of Worcestershire.  I baked it, covered with foil, for 30 minutes at 350.  Yum!

Probably will not make this again. The chops were tough. The flavor was really bland, surprisingly. The ranch rice tasted like regular rice. Made some green beans with it and they were the best part unfortunately.

I loved this recipe and my boyfriend did too. One of the reviewers said they followed the recipe and were disappointed because the meat just didn't have any flavor.. well the recipe doesn't say season the meat but I think anyone who is a cook should know to do that (season salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder). It turned out perfect for me. I even added a few white potatoes. I will make this simple recipe OVER AND OVER again!

Ever since I was pregnant with my daughter (she is now 8) I have not enjoyed one single pork chop, NOT ONE!  These changed that.  This recipe was so delicious.  They were so tender and saucy.  The sauce was so good.  It was good on the chops, it was good on the rice, it was good on the green beans I made to go with this.  I did add some sliced mushrooms in the sauce.  Also I used gluten free cream of mushroom soup (Pacific brand).  I am going to make these again and again.

This is really good but different then I expected. The ranch flavor was really mild.  It was more just tangy than ranch-y.  I usually find that the meat called for in these cream soup recipes is badly underestimated so I started with 6 bone in chops. Since I had more chops, I could not do the pan method. I browned the chops in 2 batches with pepper but no salt (I had read enough reviews saying it was too salty to salt the chops).  I put the browned chops in a 9x13 casserole and browned just a little bit of onion in the remaining oil, then added the 1 1/2 tablespoons dip mix (note that the recipe calls for a half packet of mix) and half can evaporated milk to mix it up before pouring over the chops. I covered with foil then baked at 375 for 45 min, uncovering about half way through because I didn't want it too wet. It was tasty and not overly salty at all, but it needed more bake time to get really tender. I really liked it with the ranch rice called for. I wasn't clear on the recipe so I looked on the Campbell's website for the recipe. It wants you to mix the remaining 1 1/2 tbsp dip mix with 1 cup dry rice and water, then make your rice as normal. That was almost worth the recipe right there, I loved the ranch rice and it went great with the chops and sauce. I did only use 1 tbsp instead if 1 1/2 and it was great. Even with 6 chops, there was still plenty of gravy. You could probably even do 7 or 8 and still have plenty. This is a keeper, thanks!

Easy, fast and delicious! Just be careful not to cook the pork too long. If you have a thinner cut, then the amount of time indicated in the recipe is too long. Just monitor your pork knowing you will have it simmer in the sauce 10 mins or so after it's browned.

Made this recipe last night and thought it was delicious.  I used more oil because the bone-in chops would have stuck in my electric skillet and then drained the grease before adding the combined soup/milk/dry ranch mixture to the chops.  I added a can of mushroom pieces while the chops were simmering. Next time I would use a whole soup can of milk because the soup sauce tasted so good with the instant rice with the dry ranch mix and frozen peas added.  I would also add onions while the chops were frying. Yummy and easy!  Thanks!

I baked this in the oven instead of in a skillet simply for ease.  I mixed everything together and poured on top and covered with foil in 350 oven for an hour.  The sauce ended up being really runny.  I think when I make this next time, I will cut down or omit the milk.  My kids loved the sauce.

Need to stir the sauce mixture before pouring next time. Didn't need so much sauce unless eating with rice. Kind of strange tasting using fat free ranch dressing.

I make this all the time. I love it with pork ribs. plus sometimes to add a bit of extra kick, I use a spicy ranch packet. I use the whole packet too for that extra flavor.

The flavor was really good, but I recommend baking it in the sauce instead.  I browned the chops, put the sauce on, etc., followed the directions exactly and the chops were not done.  Tried to broil them, still not done.  Had to put them in the oven for 15 min. before they were done!!  Overall, great idea, just cook differently!!

This recipe was excellent & simple. My fiance had seconds and then ate the leftovers a few hours after dinner was over. The only thing I did differently was mixed the soup, milk & ranch seasoning in a bowl before pouring it over the chicken. It was great & I'll definitely make it again.

This was a nice dish and side.  Mine didn't turn out as I would have like, but it wasn't the recipes fault.  I liked the creamy sauce over the rice.

My family loved this recipe. I did use someones suggestion and use prepared ranch instead of the packet.  I mixed the mushroom soup & ranch together, saving 1/4 of the mix for my mashed potatoes.  Over all---Awesome!

Wonderful!! We had this for dinner tonight. I added some grill seasoning to the pork chops as I fried them in the pan. This has been added to our recipe book! Thankyou for sharing!

My son and I didn't care for this - he rated it a 2, I rated it a 3,but my husband really liked it-5, hence the 4 rating. It just didn't do it for me. I made plain rice and both my son and I agreed that the plain buttered rice was the best part of the meal. But, like I said my husband really enjoyed it- he ate the leftovers up today! It was a very easy weeknight meal. I might try it again and tinker with it a bit. Thanks for sharing!

We liked these and very simple to make. Ranch dressing mix gave it a nice taste but we did not like the ranch rice I made to go with it.

I enjoyed this a lot.  When I finished the cooking, I placed the rice in a shallow glass dish, placed the pork chops on top of the rice and poured the sauce over it all. Next time I make it I will use a whole can of milk instead of half for a little more sauce and add some chopped brocolli to the mix.  I also used the whole packet of ranch mix and cooked the rice by itself.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good.  Easy and simple but nothing extraordinary! A good, basic weeknight meal - but not for guests or a special occasion.

This turned out pretty good, although I thought a bit salty even with the lower sodium soup.  Probably just me.  It is quick and easy, and the chops were tender.

I really like this recipe.  I seasoned the pork chops with a little salt and pepper before browning them.  I also let them simmer for about an 1hr to 1 1/2 hr and the meat was so tender.  I didn't make the ranch style rice because I thought that would be too much ranch flavor.  It didn't matter though, because it made so much sauce I just poured that over my brown rice.  Fantastic

these were great. i used brown rice, and then stirred in some ranch dressing once it was finished cooking. i browned the meat in coconut oil(vegetable oil is very bad for you, and olive oil gets rancid at high heat temperature). loved it, and the hubby asked if we could have it again sometime soon!

This came out well. I followed directions except didn't have time to cook rice so used orzo which was a perfect addition. Used thin chops. I'd like to try this with chicken also.

I tried this just as is.  Very good!  Even my fickle teen liked it! I did simmer over low heat longer to help the pork become more tender, maybe 20-25 min.

I cooked this recipe for dinner for my family last night. It was wonderful! I had alot of extra sauce that I used over the rice as gravey. I think this recipe would also be great if the chops were substituted with chicken. I think i'll try it with the chicken next time.
