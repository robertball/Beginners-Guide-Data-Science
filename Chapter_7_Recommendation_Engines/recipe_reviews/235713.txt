I've made this several times, tweaking it a bit each time for my preference that night, and it is excellent.  What's better is that it is amazingly simple:  Coat the chicken and throw it in the pot.  If you really want to complicate this recipe then you can try throwing it in the pot from a distance, maybe 3-point range.  For me, I just plop it in there and get delicious results.

I understand that the amounts of spices should be adjusted to suit individual tastes, but I would like to suggest the following tip which I have found useful. To stop the chicken cooking faster on the bottom, and possibly overcooking before the rest of the bird is properly cooked, roll up aluminium foil make 5 ,o 6 balls (nearly golf ball size) and put them in the bottom of the cooker for the chicken to rest on. This allows the heat to circulate more completely around the chicken and cook more evenly. It also reduces clean-up time.

Very good and very easy! I didn't put it in the bag overnight (no time), I used only black pepper (I didn't have any white pepper on hand) and I laid the chicken on a chopped onion in the slow cooker. When it was done I took all the good meat off the chicken I tossed the bones back in the slow cooker along with carrot, celery, onion, bay leaf, parsley, thyme and salt and cooked on low overnight to make soup stock.

Excellent dish and as noted in another review is very similar to "Roast Sticky Chicken - Rotisserie Style" seasonings also on this site. Not having to have the oven on and heating the whole house (it's hot all the time in Florida) is great and the meat is delicious, moist, and fall apart tender. The stock is incredible and I'm able to make plenty of gravy which I thicken up a bit with a cornstarch slurry. The chicken smells amazing cooking and tastes amazing as well. I do cut back on both the salt and peppers using 2 t. salt, 1/2 t. cayenne, 1/2 t. white pepper and no black pepper and find it to be perfect for our taste. I do quarter an onion and roll the quarters in the seasoning then stuffed them into the cavity. Now when I buy whole chickens for this dish I clean and season then wrap well and freeze. When I know I'm going to make one I thaw it out in the refrigerator the day before. Works very well and good to know I can prep a few and freeze for when I want to make this meal. Good idea to make it in the slowcooker bhbitts, it's one of our favorites.

This was one of the best crock pot chicken recipes I've ever tasted. My chicken weighed 5-lbs and I made the rub as directed except reduced the salt to 2 teaspoons since I have to watch my salt intake. I didn't notice the rub was to be put on overnight, mine was only on for about 3 hours, and I lifted the skin and put rub under the skin also, but the flavor was still awesome. I took the advice of another review and put some sweet onion along with celery chunks in the cavity. I made a two inch stand under the chicken with some potato chunks to keep the meat from laying on the bottom. That worked out great and husband ate the potatoes, too greasy for me but he loved them. I think this kept the chicken from falling apart since it wasn't laying in the greasy stock.  I used a meat thermometer and cooked on low until the temp reached 170Â°, which took 8 hours exactly. My crock pot is old and cooks low when it says low, my newer larger one cooks much hotter, so I suggest checking the temperature to keep from over or under-cooking. This chicken was so tender, juicy and flavorful, it really did taste as good as the rotisserie chicken we buy from our favorite store...it was finger lickin' good.  I'm making this one again...so dang easy!

I followed this recipe with one difference I used "smoked paprika" because it was on hand and was VERY pleased with the result. I used this dry rub the night before and the next morning I put it in the slow cooker with some veggies and went to work. SO NICE to come home to a hearty meal after a long day. the chicken was VERY tender I think the salt had something to do with that and I would not use any less personally. great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Easy and delicious!  I set the marinated bird on top of some whole potatoes, carrots, and onions. Thought it seemed like too much salt so I used one less tsp. The bird was perfectly seasoned but next time I'll sprinkle the remaining salt over the veggies. I added a bit of water but didn't need to. Lots of juice when it was done. I didn't want to add any heat to my non-air conditioned house so I set it on a table on my back porch and left for work. Came home to a great meal and I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.

Made this last night.  OMG good!  I usually bake my chicken but too dry.  I will never do it another way again.  I also reduced the salt to 2 tsp, skipped the white pepper (didn't have any) in it's place I used Chile & Garlic seasoning and cut back on the dry cayenne pepper.  Used a quarter onion in the cavity.  Served with chicken stuffing and gravy.  My most satisfying meal in a really long time.  Over and beyond my expectations!  Thank you for the post!

We loved this recipe! I am not the cook in my house typically, but I put the spice rub on the chicken I got from the farmers market last night, and ran the slow cooker tonight. We have a 7 quart oval slow cooker and found about 5 hours on low was perfect (it ranges from 4-8 on the recipe, which I thought was a huge difference). Alternatively you can definitely smell when the chicken is ready to be checked.

Great. Never have time marinate it so just rub the spices on and put in the slow cooker. Tried putting the chicken on 4 aluminum foil balls so it would not be not sitting in  grease and worked fine-next time I thought why not put vegetables in the balls- chopped potatoes, onions, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, etc.  Didn't seal the foil super tightly so flavor from chicken slipped into vegetables but minimal grease. Definite keeper

I love the seasoning on this chicken; however, it is almost the same as this site's Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style. This recipe adds an extra 1/2 tsp. cayenne. The good thing about cooking the chicken in the slow cooker is it requires no attention and it is so tender it falls off the bone. The down side? It falls off the bone and lacks in appearance. Still delicious though!

I changed up the spice mix and applied it differently so my 5 stars are based more on the general idea and cooking method. However, I did use this spice blend on oven baked chicken thighs to get an idea of what he outcome is incase I decide to make it this way. My chicken came out very moist. I may have left it in a bit longer than I should've because it was hard to take it out without it falling apart. But it was so worth it. The major difference I did in applying it is I made sure I had enough seasoning to completely over the chicken front back and inside out. Which I did because here were a few people complaining about bland chicken. Super glad I did this. The entire chicken was flavorful and the drippings made he best gravy ever. I also cooked some potatos and carrots beneath the chicken to keep it up out of its own liquids a bit. You should do that too.

This is tasty. The seasonings really do have that rotisserie flavor. Based on the amount of salt in this recipe I see how the store bought cooked chickens may be so salty now. Whole organic chickens were pretty pricey, so I went with a cut up one. A lady on the buzz suggested an onion in the cavity. That is a great idea. I modified it by layering the chicken with 2" pieces of onions. I mixed the seasonings and shook the chicken pieces in a bag with it, after cleaning the chicken and rubbing on a little oil. I did change up the seasonings some. For the peppers, all 3, I did 1/4 tsp. I did 1 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 tsp. of paprika and the rest of the seasonings the same. I took mine out of the crock-pot about 1-1 1/2 hours early, due to it being cut up. The meat is in a lot of liquid, at least with using the onion anyway. Next time I will elevate it on some balls of foil or other method. The cooked onions were tasty too. I may try a gravy, as suggested, from the strained liquid. The fall off the bone meat and onions will be good with a rice pilaf. Don't be expecting crispy chicken or skin at least following the method above. If that is not an issue, this works fine. Note: I also used a crock-pot liner for ease and clean-up.

What a great recipe that makes a great meal... and leftover meals to come! I did what some other reviewers did- stuffed the cavity with chopped sweet onion and celery (mixed this with the seasoning first), we also added one chopped jalapeno to the crock pot on its last hour. And at the bottom of the pan before placing the chicken in to cook, we put chopped onions and celery. As far as the spice mix- I used 2 teaspoons and then 1 teaspoon with the chopped onion and celery. I also added chopped garlic. I didn't feel like it was salty enough so I added one more teaspoon- but I think the perfect amount of salt for our 3lb bird would have been 3.5teaspoons. We used the leftovers to make sandwiches on hoagie buns... they were amazing! I would also suggest using your leftover shredded chicken to make some soups with it or another dish. Thanks for this!

This was so delicious and easy. I used a 5 lb. chicken and cooked it for about 8 hours while I was at work. It probably would have been fine at 6-7 hours. The meat just fell off the bone. I also halved the salt as others recommended and I added a tsp. of rosemary for preference. I also stuffed the inside with some chopped onion for extra flavor. This is definitely my new favorite way to do a whole chicken!!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

Cooked on low for 8 hours and was perfect. I followed another reviewers advice and placed the chicken on top of quartered potatoes and stuffed the cavity with 3 stalks celery and onion. Just wish the skin would have gotten crispy, but I don't think that it is possible just using a slow cooker.

This was really good. Definitely lots of grease that drips off but I propped my bird on top of big chunks of onion and celery so it wasn't sitting in the grease. I cut the ingredients in half and still had lots to rub on. Cooked for 4 hours on high and it turned out perfect.

Way too hot so far as the amount of different pepper used. We like spicy food but this ones taste is off balanced with the amount of pepper. Won't be making this again. I followed the recipe exact.

I loved it... with changes... As is I give it 4 stars, with changes a definite 5 star.   I cut the salt in half and because I have two little kids I also cut the cayenne in half.  The skin was still a little too spicy for them, but the chicken tasted great! I couldn't even take it out of the slow cooker without it falling apart.  It's the only way I cook whole chicken.

The chicken came out so moist it fell off of the bone very good seasoning. I had a 7 lb chicken cooked it for 8 hours and added 1 cup of chicken broth and put carrots and onions on the bottom. I cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp just so it was not to hot for my kids and they loved it!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! It comes out amazing! I have been making it for over a year now, but not the one from this site.  The one I use says to rub the outside with garlic cloves and put them inside with a lemon that's been quartered butted against each other then rub it down.  I cut the cayenne down to a 1/4 tsp or less.  

Also I discovered my slow cooker doesn't fit a whole chicken so I had to oven bake it. I put it in a big roasting pan on a big bed of chopped veggies, cover it with foil and bake at 350 for 1 to 1.5 hrs then take the foil off & bake another 15-30 mins. Nice crispy skin & juicy on the inside, it's amazing!

I made this.  I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I seasoned it with the seasoning she posted plus one more of my own. I added the seasoning to butter and put that butter under the chicken skin and on top. i put potatoes and carrots on the bottom of the crock pot, and added a little water. Then i stuffed the chicken with garlic and onion..came out great just missed the crispy ness u would get from baking it in the oven. It didn't take long to cook a few hours....

This definitely made my first time cooking a whole chicken a breeze.  My family personally liked it sitting in the broth.  I stuffed it with onions and garlic.  The remaining chicken will be turned into pulled bbq chicken.  I will cook this again.

I have now made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and discovered that our slow cooker, on low, takes only four of the eight hours that I had allotted to cook the bird.  Even after warming the cold chicken for dinner four hour later, was wonderful if a little on the salty side.

The second time that I made it, I cut the salt in half and put the chicken onto cook only four hours before dinner time.  It cooked perfectly!  When I took the bird our of the slow cooker, I looked at all those nice drippings in the pot and decided that they were calling out to be made into gravy.  I added a quarter cup of water and then added flour a teaspoon at a time, stirring constantly, until the gravy was the right consistency.  Not only was the chicken delicious, my wife told me that the gravy was the best she had ever eaten.  From a senior citizen from the south, that is high praise indeed! And I agreed.

I've used this method quite a  few times, and I recommend using a rack, if your slow cooker has one, or ball up pieces of foil to elevate the chicken so it doesn't braise instead of roast. I agree with other reviewers that this recipe has way too much salt. I personally like to use rosemary in my rub.

Added potatoes, celery, onions and mushrooms to the crock, surrounding the chicken.Cooked on low for 5 hours, turned to high for additional hour. Chicken was super moist and although not as spicy as I thought it would be, it was very good. Great and easy way to make a whole bird.

Followed another poster's advice and placed potatoes on the bottom of crock. Chicken came out juicy, not falling apart. The potato, carrot and celery mix was indeed a big hit with the guys.

Amazing. This was one of the best recipes I have ever made. My entire family loved it and it was so easy. My daughter and husband LOVE pepper so they naturally loved the recipe. I don't love pepper like they do, but I love it as well. Make it! You won't be disappointed.

Our chicken turned out really well.  It was very tender and juicy.  I did add the thick potato slices at the bottom to get the bird up off the floor of the slow cooker as suggested in the comments, and it helped.   Very happy with the rub, may add a Spanish Paprika for a smoked flavor and some brown sugar next time.

Like many of the others I cut back on the salt and it was great. Skin was a bot spicy, but I could eat some of the skin for the flavour and the kids could skip the skin and skip the spice. Made great gravy, too.

Great rub! I put it on the chicken and put the chicken in a vacuum bag overnight. I couldn't even get the chicken out of the crock pot without it just falling off the bones. I definitely don't recommend going over the 8 hours of cooking, mine was in 10 hours andrive was a little dry.

I've made chicken like this for years.  However, I can't use pepper of any kind, so my substitute is Basil.  Lots of it.  Also can't use garlic and onion powder, so I use real crushed garlic and real onion.   I lay the chicken on a bed of onion and, rub the chicken down good with salt, crushed garlic and crushed onion and dried basil, the salt seems to pull the juice from the minced onion and garlic which makes it easy to rub the meat inside and out.  This is  a super easy way to fix roast chicken.   After the meal, the carcass makes great stock.  Just add a carrot or 2  and some celery to the water.  I like it better than what you buy in cans or cartons.  I've kept the broth in the fridge for up to a month.

Holy cow! This is the best seasoned chicken I have ever eaten! I made it according to the recipe, and it was flavorful and fell right off of the bone! I cooked it in low for 6 hours, then it sat on warm for 4 hours until I got home. Delicious!!! I wouldn't change a thing!

This was unbelievably easy and came out great.  I took the advice of others and cut the salt in half.  I also added carrots and potatoes to the bottom to keep it from getting soggy.  And I cut the pepper down just a bit and so glad I did.  It was just on the verge of too spicy. But it tasted just like the one you get in the store minus the msg they put in it.  I was impressed!

This chicken turned out delicious! I didn't take the time to marinate it, just made the rub, put a little olive oil on the chicken, sprinkled the spices on it & put it in the crock pot. My whole family loved it!

Absolutely fantastic!  The seasoning is perfect, a little heat, a little smoke. I will say I put a cored apple and quartered lemon in the cavity only because I traditionally do this. The meat fell apart - really fell apart. No one needed a knife!  This is being made on a regular basis in our house going forward. :-D

Wow! Wow!  I've always roasted my chicken and was looking for something different.  So easy - I washed and dried the chicken and sprinkled it with Montreal season salt (salt, pepper and garlic) and put it in the slow cooker Breast side down. No, I didn't do the overnight deal.  Added some small fingerling potatoes. On high for one hour and on low for five. Very juicy and tender.  Even got the hubby thumbs up.

i was really excited to make this one and idk what i did wrong, but i followed the recipe exactly, put the chicken up a bit in potatoes, carrots and onions, cooked for 5 and a half hours and it was....okay, not bad, but not didn't match up with the responses of other reviewers. i did however use the leftovers in Lloyd's healthy chicken zoopa (from this site) and it turned out fabulous!

Great chicken - came out flavorful and moist.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I just had some leftovers for lunch and its still just as good.  The only change I made was because I didn't have onion powder, I used onion salt and then cut down on the sea salt I used to season it.  A keeper recipe for sure.

I actually added no salt and didn't miss it as DH is sodium restricted. For those that are used to it I would only use two teaspoons. Be warned, this is quite hot from the pepper. This chicken is moist and pretty, but screams for more flavor, such as sage or rosemary. I made gravy with the liquid, but it was still bland, not for lack of salt, but lack of spices. I'm sure the leftovers can be used lots of ways, such as salads or sandwiches and extra flavoring added.

First this is an amazingly delicious recipe.  I did reduce the salt in half.  I make 2 or 3 times the amount of spices listed and keep it in an old empty spice bottle so I always have it in hand. 
You can add more garlic and onion powder also.  
Second, I put a cup of rice or mix of rice and other grain and add one cup of water in the bottom of the crock pot before adding the chicken.  You can add some diced onion or frozen vegetables. Sprinkle on some chicken soup flavor or a tablespoon of the spice mixture over the rice before adding the chicken.  There is usually enough liquid from the chicken to finish cooking the rice. If not take the chicken out of the crockpot when done, add a little more water and let if cook a little longer in the crockpot. This recipe gets rave reviews whenever I make it.

Wonderful recipe!  I placed aluminum foil balls in the bottom, seasoned with poultry seasoning, kosher salt, and half an onion stuffed in the cavity.

I thought the seasonings were great, and will probably use those again, but the slow cooker method left my chicken with disgustingly soggy, rubbery skin. I used the foil balls suggested by Chef John, but at the end, the chicken was swimming 1/3 deep in it's own juice. I prefer doing the beer can chicken for the crispy skin.

We really like this recipe. I reduce the salt but otherwise I follow the recipe for the rub as written. I spread some of the rub under the skin too. The heat seems just right.  I put potatoes, carrots, onion and celery on the bottom of the pot and stuff the chicken cavity with a half lemon,half onion an 3 cloves of garlic. Yummy!

I think this is a pretty good recipe that certainly has potential. I like a slow cooker approach, the heavy seasoning and the idea of refrigerating it overnight. My slow cooker has a rack in the bottom, so it held the chicken out of the juices. To my taste, the paprika was just too prominent. The heat was barely noticeable. I will make it again, but I think I'll cut the paprika and increase the thyme and pepper and maybe add rosemary and perhaps more cayenne. I don't think it needs onion or potatoes. Thanks for a good, base recipe to work from.

This turned out very well. Five pound chicken cooked in about 5 hours. I can only give it four stars though, because it was way too spicy for my comfort. I'll definitely make this again, but without the cayenne.

A five-star indeed! I've tried to cook whole chicken in the crock pot several times, but it always turned out over cooked (bones breaking apart), and swimming in broth! I followed this recipe AS IS and I was very pleased! I cooked the chicken on LOW for 3 1/2 hours. (Note the time-window in the recipe 4-8 hours - such a broad time!). 
Delicious and moist! Thanks!!!

The chicken turned out great. I used less salt and pepper due to tender mouths. The 5# plus chicken was finished in 4 hours on low. I will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe!!

This chicken came out amazing.  I used a little chicken broth, enough to cover the bottom.  I stuffed it with onions and I followed the rest of the recipes but used half the salt that's required.  I used a liner also.  I put onions, small white potatoes and carrots at the bottom.  As soon as I cut it open juices were flowing out.  Hubby loved it!!!

This is a delicious, easy recipe. I skipped the marinating part only because I forgot to do that the night before. My chicken was still frozen in the middle so I cooked it almost the full 8 hours. so delicious!! Served over rice with the juicy broth the chicken made.

I didn't add as much cayenne pepper to it, as I can not eat spicy foods. This was an excellent meal my family really enjoyed it and it was easy to make.

The dark meat was decent, but the white meat had pretty much no flavor. Overall, it was an edible basic chicken recipe, but nothing special.

As others have said the chicken was very moist and tender. It took a little longer to cook than the 4 hours for a 3 1/2lb chicken but at an additional 30 minutes and it was at the proper temperature. I did cut the salt in half as others suggested and I cut the cayenne in half also only a personal preference but other than that I used the exact seasonings as the recipe indicated. My husband especially enjoyed it and went back for a second serving. Thanks for the recipe. I will be using again.

I made it mainly to use the chicken in other dishes.  I cut back on the salt as suggested.  I cooked it for 6 hours and it fell apart.  It was convenient and with a liner easy cleanup.  Lot of juice in the liner to make a nice gravy.  I would make it again

I reduced the amount of salt to 2 tsps.   Very delicious.  I made a roll of foil to raise the chicken on in the bottom of slow cooker.  I find the chicken roasts better when raised so it's not boiled on the bottom.

This is a great base recipe! This time I used smoked paprika instead of regular which is a GAME CHANGER! Also, I layered Yukon potatoes and yellow onion for a base so the chicken has room to breathe.  I also stuffed the cavity with oranges and sprigs of fresh rosemary. amazingly juicy and the mixture of spice, citrus, and Smokey was perfect. I seperate the chicken from the potatoes and onions...shredded the chicken and make lettuce cups with Pico De Gallo, avocado, sour cream, and sauteed sweet peppers. served the onions and potatoes as a side. AMAZING!!!

The only change I made was I used smoked paprika and added more garlic powder.  Otherwise, followed the exact directions cooking on low for 8 hours and this came out perfect - moist and delicious!  A new favorite!

The flavor was spicy and delicious! I did use 1/2 the amount of salt. You really should put in the zip lock bag overnight. I tried to skip a step & put right in slow cooker, but the spices were not evenly distributed.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars was the bottom of the chicken was down in the juices from the chicken, so really not roasted. Next time going to try & elevate chicken so all gets roasted. Thanks for a keeper!

This recipe is perfect.  I did follow one of the suggestions and place the chicken on golf ball size aluminum foil.  I also stuffed the chicken with onions, fresh garlic and celery.  Overall it was yummy!

Used a 5.5 lb whole chicken and was a tad overcooked at 6 3/4 hours (6 qt. slow cooker on low).  Would make it again if I was going to use the chicken for another use, very tender but our family missed the crispy skin (plus texture more poached than rotisserie).  The spice mix was good but on advice of other reviews, cut down salt to 3 tsp.  Stuffed under skin and over then marinated overnight. Placed bird on a bed of sweet potato/onion pieces and stuffed cavity with 2 slides of onion and a head of garlic with outside paper removed and 1/4" top cut off.  Agreed super easy but our family voted to return to the "flat chicken" (open up chicken, remove backbone & sternum.  Stuffed spice/butter mix under skin then lay flat on bed of veggies.  Roast 425 degrees for 50-70 min depending on weight).  Best part was the sweet potatoes which we mashed with the roasted garlic cloves, butter, and Parmesan cheese!   Note for future reviewers - please include weight of your bird...it was hard to judge timing when this was seldom mentioned.  Thanks!

1) I cut the salt way down and also cut several pepper measures down a lot cuz too much spice hurts me, but it was still really delicious.  
The chicken was too big for my crock pot, tho, so I roasted it on a tripod right in the slow cooker ceramic pot at 400 deg for 1.5 hours.  It was wonderfully juicy and tender with crispy skin.  Turned out great!

I was pleasantly surprised at this recipe because I normally always use the oven.  I did do like the other reviewers and put potatoes underneath.  I halved the salt and omitted the cayenne pepper only to please my wife.  I will be making it this way again and again.

I put a layer of cut potatoes, celery and carrots on the bottom with about a cup of water and chicken adobo seasoning. Set the chicken on top of all of that and added the seasonings. Let it cook all day. Amazing. A little spicy for my little ones but not inedible. I personally loved it. One of the best "roast" chickens I've ever made.

Five stars for sure!  Easy, adjustable to personal preferences and what's in the spice rack.  This delicious dish smells GREAT when you come in the door after a hard day's work.  Soooo juicy and flavourful!  I sprinkle a little of the seasoning inside and under the skin and place a sliced onion inside before cooking.  The drippings make fabulous gravy.  So easy that kids have no valid reason to not "make" dinner while you're out!  :)

Very impressed with this rotisserie style chicken. It can't get any easier than this. I cut back on the salt to 2 tsp (trying to keep salt lower for hubby) and left out the white pepper (didn't have any) and it came out delicious regardless. I added some carrots and halved potatoes to the bottom of  the slow cooker before plopping in the chicken so we could have a complete meal.

I did not make mine Spicy after reading reviews...instead just seasoned with Garlic, Onion, some Salt (recipe calls for way to much salt!) and a bit of Paprika over the top. Also added a chopped onion to the Cavity and about 1 cup of chicken broth to the pot . Tender & Juicy

This was fantastic and really does taste like Rotisserie chicken! I made no changes.  I think the key is putting it in the bag overnight.  I've made many whole chickens in my crockpot but this was the only one where the seasonings actually went all they way into the meat.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a super simple and delicious recipe!

The chicken turned out very flavorful, tender and juicy. I added flour to the drippings to make the gravy. I also cut the salt to 2 teaspoons, put in some cut onions and celery in the cavity.

I made it like it was listed except I didn't have white pepper so I replaced it with more black pepper.  Yum! It was perfect! The recipe didn't say what to set the crockpot on high or low so I cooked it on low for 6 hours and it was juicy and delicious!

So Delicious and so easy. Made it exactly as the recipe shows except I cut the salt down to maybe 1/4 tsp. All the spices definitely allow for cut back on the salt. Will definitely be making this again and again.

Excellent and so easy! I cut the salt and cayenne in half as per other reviews and it turned out beautifully. I doubt I will ever roast another chicken in the oven.

Lessen salt to 2 tsp, used white pepper a bit more as I was out of black pepper. Stuffed with onion and celery and placed chicken on top of carrots and potatoes.  YUMMY!

I made it and it was good especially since it was the first time making it.  I agree with some other reviews to add tomato paste for added flavor.  I impressed myself with this one.

Far and away the best chicken I have ever made.  Like others, I cut the salt in half and it was very good.   Also, I didn't have white pepper, so I made do without it.  The chicken was still excellent. 

I tweaked it by putting some celery that I wanted to use up in the cavity of the chicken and it was delicious.   I also put some red potatoes and baby carrots along with a sliced onion in the bottom of the slow cooker.   Then I sprinkled a little garlic salt on the veggies.  They too were delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe to everyone!

EXCELLENT!  Like the others said, delicious and so, so easy.  If someone wrote a negative review on this recipe, I'd say either their crockpot is strange or they didn't follow the directions exactly.  (But my crockpot is one back from the 1980's...and it did fine!)
.
I applied all the seasonings, put it in a bag and refrigerated for like 12 hours (overnight).  Then, I put it in the crock pot first thing in the morning....and came home to a wonderful lunch!  I just opened and warmed some LaPreferida refried beans (http://www.lapreferida.com/products/authentic-16-oz/) with salsa on top and put a little lettuce & tomato salad (avocadoes weren't ripe yet) on the side.  DEE-LISH!....and so quick!  (still eating as I'm typing.  2nd helpings  :)   Enjoy it!

Easy peasy! This was great! The seasonings were tasty and the chicken came out really nice. I used potatoes on the bottom and cooked it on low for 9 hours. Moist and falling off the bones. Thanks for this recipe. I'll never oven roast chicken ever again.

My crock pot sat unused for years.  This recipe sounded so good I took it out and glad I did try this recipe.  Excellent!
The spices were just right.  I did add more garlic, and only 1/4 tsp. salt. So easy and so very delicious.  I put carrots, celery and a few potatoes underneath the chicken.  Absolutely delicious.  Glad I had that crock pot!

I love the concept of this recipe, but I did adjust herbs and spices to suit my family's tastes. I also cut way back on the salt (less than one teaspoon). I would also suggest forgetting a chicken with the pop-up timers (do they even sell those anymore?). They are almost never accurate. Just use your regular kitchen thermometer for accuracy. This came out tender and delicious!

This is very good. Thank you!  Those who had troubles have to adjust  their times to different weights of bird. Too long, bird will fall apart (not that that's bad, but sometimes not what you want :) ).  The same goes for the spices. Last, if you have a large bird which is going to give off more liquid then not only can you use vegies to lift it off the bottom but you also could use a rack fitted inside your cooker. Plus I only season the night before if I am leaving very early in the morning, ergo.. dump in, turn on, leave. If home, I season just before putting in. Same - same.  Soo nice to come home to a meal you just need to dish out.  Thanks again!!!

Some parts were too spicy from soaking in the oil in the bottom of the cooker while other parts were a bit bland.  Using the small potatoes to prop up the chicken is likely a good idea.

I followed someoneâs suggestion to add fresh garlic with the quartered onion in the cavity bf cooking.  I also didnât have time to put in slow cooker bc my bird was 8-1/2lbs so I cooked in oven for 5-6hours at 275 degrees. Upped it to 3000 last 30 mins. It came our Fantastic!!! It was tender, juicy & flavorful.  Next time Iâll try the slow cooker, just have to remember to put in early bc for that size roast it will take close to 10 hours.  Definitely adding this to my
Menu rotation!!!

First time I ever made this recipe. Best chicken I have ever made, Only things I did different was used half the seasonings rubbed the chicken with the seasonings and put some on the inside of the chicken and saved the rest for later use.
Buttered the chicken like you would a turkey generously, Added not even half a cup of water around the chicken into the Crock pot. Set it to high for 30 mins to 1 hour then back to low to cook the full 8 hours, falls off the bone melts in your mouth! This would be amazing with homemade noodles for some Chicken Noodle Soup!!!

Made close to the recipe directions ( reduced salt and pepper). The chicken was little dry and the skin didn't have the beautiful golden brown color that it usually gets when roasted in the oven!
I had to bush the chicken with some melted butter and broil for few minutes in the oven before serving to brown the skin and make it crispier.

This was a delicious rub and cooking the chicken in the slow cooker made it very tender and juicy! I cut the cayenne in half to make sure it wouldnât be too spicy for my kids. I added a quartered onion, crushed garlic cloves and some celery stalks as aromatics. The chicken was so tasty and the gravy was delicious! My 6 year old son had 5 helpings at supper and ate it for breakfast the next day!

I made this just as the recipe said. It was amazing. The chicken tasted so flavorful and it was so tender. As others suggested, I did cut up some onion and celery and placed it on the bottom. I will be making this again for sure!

Check amount of salt and pepper before using, way too much of both !  Season Salt, garlic sprinkle and Poultry seasoning were perfect on our bird.  I sat a small ceramic trivet underneath to keep bird bottom from being soggy.  We like to remove breast meat for sandwiches and the rest goes with drippings (fat removed) into a Mexican soup or over noodles.  5 lb bird was done in 4 hours on high, using 6 qt. oval crock pot.

The only thing I did different was, I love the crispy skin. but in a slow cooker that was not going to happen so.....I placed the chicken on a rack and put it under the broiler for 10 min or until I could see the skin getting brown. Loved it!! and it helped to render out some of the grease. WIN WIN!!!

I am rating the seasoning mix at a 5. We baked boneless chicken thighs in the oven with this seasoning and it was MARVELOUS. I hope to use it on a whole chicken in the crockpot later, probably adding a sliced onion to the bottom like someone else mentioned. . .Tonight we are making more of the seasoning for a second baked chicken tomorrow. We are on a really limited diet right now, (sort of elimination eating plan) and this fits the bill perfectly.  Serving it on rice might be nice, but it is so tasty, we don't care.

This was such an easy meal, with tossing in some quartered potatoes and carrots the last two hours of cooking.
I did cut the salt in half. I really liked the flavor, but it was a little too peppery for my husband. I will work with adjusting the amounts of the spices.

DELICIOUS. I did 1/2 the salt, 1 tsp of black pepper instead of the white. Put foil balls under, rubbed the spices on, and threw it in the crockpot right away. Kids loved it and they are very picky. Not too spicy or "hot" at all. Just perfect.

Really good for a whole chicken which is personally not my favorite. Love the spices for it and super easy. Only reason why it isn't a 5 star is just that I don't love whole chickens.

It cooked 5:20 on low and came out delicious. I put 2 potatoes and 2 carrots rough chopped underneath it and they came out underdone after all that done. Easy enough to finish those later.

Chicken was very moist and the rub is quite good. I put some carrots and celery beneath the chicken and am glad I did. Adds flavor and helps prevent skin from sticking to crock pot. Planning on using the rub on grilled or smoked chicken when I can.

Great recipe that was easy and fun to make.  

A few tips: 
The first time I made it I made the mistake of turning the chicken over a lot during seasoning and as I turned it I rubbed off much of the spices.  You really want to get the spices to lay on the surface without too much rubbing to give the bird some color and flavor.

Line the bottom of the crocpot with a single large sheet of aluminum foil.  The chicken is often falling off the bone when you get home from work, and this lets you remove it without destroying the chicken.

The last time I made it I removed the skin before cooking.  The result was that the chicken had more flavor since the spices penetrated into the meat better, but it was slightly less juicy.

This was the second worst thing I have ever eaten, only by virtue of the fact that it didn't give me food poisoning on top of being utterly inedible. I don't know what it is with the spice mix but it is so overpowering and stinks after cooking. I followed the recipe exactly so its not the fault of any mistakes on my part. I'd give it less than one star if I could.

I used the recipe as is and a whole chicken with the pop up timer. I have a Rival 6.5 quart slow cooker and it seems to cook faster than what the slow cooker recipes call for so know your slow cooker. It only took 4 hours for a large bird to cook thoroughly. Delicious right out of the cooker but over the next two days the meat was dry so if you're planning for leftovers then save the cooked broth. Another winning recipe!

Great flavor and easy to make. I think next time I will brine the chicken prior to putting on the rub. Seems to me if you brine the meat, the texture is amazing.

Great easy recipe.  The spices used are almost the exact mix in Emeril's Cajun Spice mix.  You can find the recipe online.  We like our food spicy, so I use half the salt indicated and add more mix to each recipe to our taste. Just be sure you are using garlic POWDER and not garlic salt.  I mix up a jar and have it for when I need it. We are from SW Louisiana, so remember, "spicy" is by personal taste!  Even here in NM we find most food somewhat bland.

This is so beyond easy and yummy! Followed the spices exactly. Didnât remember to do the rub the night before but flavorful regardless. Propped the chicken up a few inches on top of onion and carrots as others suggested. I canât believe the skin even got crisp in a crockpot, yum! I let it rest 15 minutes on a plate before slicing to keep the juices in.

Best chicken I have ever made! Popped it in the oven on broil for 5 minutes at the end to crisp the skin.  Juiciest and most flavorful recipe I've ever tasted.  Family raved about it and it was way too easy!!!!

A little dry the 8 hours was too long for the size chicken we used... approx. 4lbs. Next time I will mix up the spices a little. Easy to do..

Loved the idea of doing a whole chicken in slow cooker.  Simple to make the rub and smelled great while cooking. So tender and juicy to eat, just might tone down the heat a bit next time around.

Quite tender and juicy. I didnât do the overnight bag thing, so I canât be critical. Mine turned out sort of bland except for the skin which had all the spices. Next time Iâll do it the right way.

I followed the recipe exactly. I placed the chicken on a ring of crumbled tin foil so it did not sit in the liquid it made as it cooked. The chicken was exceptionally good.  My family loved it.  Also, I have started using Crock-Pot liners which make clean up a breeze.

I followed the directions, but made a larger batch of seasoning because I got a 5.5 lb. bird. I left it overnight and put it in my 7 quart crockpot the next morning. I set it for 6 hrs. on low, but my popup timer went off about 5 hrs. in. A quick read thermometer gave me about 180 in the breast, thigh was up also, but the bird didn't dry out, it stayed moist. I think I used too much celery and onion because the spicy flavor was very muted. That was my only complaint. I used the left over chicken to make a chicken pot pie, which came out great. For that, I stayed with the recipe on a nationally known pie crust box. Next time I will adjust the seasoning to fit my picky palate.

I used only 1 t of salt and italian season instead of thyme and black pepper.  I sliced onions half inch thick and placed on bottom of crockpot.  I rubbed the seasoning allover the chicken and up under the breast skin onto the meat directly cooked 5 hours on high.  It is so moist and delicious!  Now the bones and skin and juices plus carrots and extra water are slow cooking threw the night for soup tomorrow!

Better than any store bought chicken and I have tried them all.  However, I think Sam's might beat this in flavor because of their marinade. Anyway, I started with the best...a Perdue no-antibiotic, non GMO chicken that was on sale at Jewel. Start with a good product and you should have good results.

This was a huge disappointment. The flavor was lacking but almost there, and the meat was dry. I followed the recipe but only reduced the salt by a teaspoon.

This recipe is just so good. It is a staple in our house. I like to use smoked paprika, it adds a really nice flavour, and I never have white pepper so I donât use it. Oh and I never marinate it overnight, I am just not that organized. The chicken turns out so moist but the skin on top is still crispy and delicious.

Delicious! Made it just like the recipe except, I stuffed it with a lemon and thyme sprigs. I also put some sliced onions on the bottom so the chicken wouldnât burn.

Totally doubted this would be good. Thought it would be too salty or too spicy.  I thought might be dry. It looked just like the picture (wish I'd snapped one.)  Absolutely delicious, moist, and tender.

Easy, I cooked too long though so the white meats was a little dry. Next time Iâll stick to 4 hours! I also made the stock as someone suggested on these reviews. Canât wait to use it to make some yummy soup!

Cooker 1200g whole chicken on low for 6 hours, with 4 tsp salt.  Came out a little dry and too salty.  Will cut salt in half and add butter next time.

My husband really liked this recipe. I did stuff the chicken and did not need to cook it the entire time stated but I think my slow cooker cooks a little high. It turned out moist and flavorful. Will make it again.

The chicken was very good and tender.  My boyfriend absolutely loved it! The one thing
I did was cook the bird breast side down to keep it moist. When it was done, the meat fell off of the bone. Will definitely cook this again.

I made this on a hot humid day and it was tender and juicy. I like a crisp skin, so when the weather cools down I will put it in the broiler for a bit to crisp up the skin. Leftovers are Delilah to use for chicken enchiladas, and home chicken soup with egg noodles.

So easy and yummy! Trying to be better about using my Crockpot (I have 2! For goodness sakes) to make evenings easier and eat at home more. I used the suggestion about wrapping vegetables (potato, onion, garlic cloves, carrots) loosely in foil to prop up chicken and keep it from getting soggy in drippings, and stuffed some onions/carrot/garlic inside too! I did wash and try chicken before rubbing in olive oil and coating in spices. I would definitely do this again, the veg took prep time but the rest was quick and easy!

No changes. Chicken turned out cooked perfectly. Tender, juicy and delicious. I didn't think a slow cooker would work on a whole bird this well. Good recipe to have. Thank you!

A bit too much pepper in the rub, cut back on that and all should be great. Chicken stays moist and tasty. I did add some green beans and sliced potatoes, also tasty. Will do again!

I had high hopes for this recipe; however, the flavor was a little off.  My family would probably prefer me to season with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Also, after 5 hours on low, the breast meat was dry, and the thighs were a little bloody.

Excellent!  I made this a week or so ago and making again tonight.  I omitted the cayenne since I didn't have any on hand and substituted some red pepper flakes.  I didn't add white pepper since I had none on hand, but this was plenty spicy for my taste without it.  I also followed some other reviews and used a couple of quartered potatoes and onions on the bottom of the crock pot to hold the chicken up.  Cooked on low for about 8 hours.  This was YUMMY!  I thickened the liquid produced with some corn starch and it was outstanding!

OMGosh! This recipe was awesome! Hubby bought a chicken that was too large for crockpot so I made it in my Dutch oven. Put it in a 225 degree oven to cook (covered) for about 6.5 hours. Last half hour roasted with lid off.  Delicious and got family raves all around. Will definitely put on my meal wheel! Was able to use  the little bit of leftovers for quesadillas next day. Have used the broth for sautÃ©ing veggies.

I made this almost exactly as stated,  I just used a little less chili powder and the chicken was great.  I am going to make this recipe many times, so easy to make and doesn't heat the kitchen during hot days.

With a time crunch in cooking, I roasted in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes.  Also put an onion and celery in the cavity before cooking.  Delicious and so moist!

This was so easy to make and hubby enjoyed it.  Very tasty and will definitely make it again.  I made a few changes though and although I omitted the white pepper, the chicken was still very hot with the Cayenne and Black Pepper.   I also omitted Onion Powder and cut up a med onion and put it on the bottom of the Cooker, then placed the chicken on top of the onions after I completed the prepping.  I omitted the dried Thyme, and used 1 tsp of the fresh Thyme and 1 tsp of fresh Rosemary.  I used Minced Garlic instead of Garlic Powder and I did not use a resealable bag nor let it sit overnight.  I rubbed the ingriedients over entire chicken, and placed the chicken on top of the Onions.  Then I  cut up six potatoes (quartered),  placed some under the chicken with the onions and layed the rest around the entire chicken.  I also cut up one stalk of Celery into strips, cut the strips in half and layed them on all sides of the chicken.  Cooked on slow for 6 hrs.  Removed the chicken from the Cooker, transferring it into another dish to brown in the oven.  I poured off  3/4 of the  juices made from the chicken, and thicken the remaining juices by adding one can of Campbells Cream of Chicken Mushroom Soup, stirring and mashing out the lumps until you get a smooth texture.  The gravy is delicious with mashed potatoes or poured over the quartered potatoes baked along with the chicken.  Thanks for sharing this tasty dish!!!

Ridiculously easy, surprisingly juicy! After carving, i put the bones back in the slow cooker, added some accumulated vegetable remnants (a la Pioneer Woman Cooks), and it made excellent stock. I did omit the cayenne, which may not be too good in stock. I also used smoked paprika, which made it a tad smokier than I would have liked. Next time, I'll use half sweet paprika, half smoked. I'll make this again and again.

This chicken was so easy and yummy! I rubbed the spices up under the skin and marinated it for 24 plus hours in the fridge.  I used a large chicken so I cooked for 7 hours on low in my crock pot.  I strained the juices and made a nice gravy too.

Easy to make, chicken was good. I seasoned it the night before, stuffed it with onion and celery the morning of. Next time I may stick it in the oven under the broiler for a minute or two so the skin gets crispy. Either way will definitely make this again.

I used 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper instead of a full teaspoon, and it was plenty spicy (I think 1 teaspoon would have been way too spicy). I cooked it for 7 hours on low in the slow cooker, and the dark meat was amazing but the white meat was a little dry. I will taste the white meat after 5 hours next time and stop there if it seems good.

So  easy! Used whatever spices I had on hand - poultry seasoning, garlic salt, pepper, paprika, little cayenne. Set the chicken on halved potatoes, as another user recommended. Chicken is so most and fall off the bone tender! This recipe is going in our "favorites" file!

Very easy and just as good as a rotisserie chicken you'd get at the grocery store. Since you don't add water or broth I was concerned there wouldn't be enough stock/drippings for gravy, but I got a good 2 cups worth.

EXCELLENT EASY Iloved the spices . I followed chef Johns advice about foil balls on bottom no problem and
a good idea. Do again. I think it's perfect. I will  buy fresh,
rub, freeze, thaw and slow cook. So easy. Watch the time though, doesn't need that much time.

This was so delicious and so easy.  The meat came out so tender and the flavor, so good!  I pulled my bones out and used the remainder as a stock for pasole.

I made this recipe using only the ingredients listed and it turned out amazing! It's very easy. The only step I didn't follow was refrigerating the chicken in the rub overnight. I let it sit in the rub for about 2 hours before cooking it overnight on low. I'll definitely be making this again, and probably play around with the spices for the fun of it.

This is the best tasking chicken I have ever made. I've never made a whole chicken before. Also, I had to jam it into my crock pot, so it was extremely tight in there & t was submerged in all the juices the whole time, so I wasn't sure how that would affect this recipe or if the chicken would be soggy.... I did not let sit for 8 hours in the fridge before cooking. Just rubbed the seasoning under the skin, rammed some fresh garlic and onion in the cavity and let rip. I only cooked it for 6 hours. So good!

Made this exactly as written.  As other reviewers suggested, I put 5 golf ball sized foul balls on the bottom of the crockpot to support the chicken. I also used a slo cooker liner for easy cleanup.  I added carrots and potatoes for a one pot meal.  My bird weighed  4.36 lbs.it took 5.5 hrs to cook. 1 hour on high and 4.5 on low.  I have a 7qt. SLO cooker. The seasonings were very good and not salty at all.  No need to use any oil or broth.  The chicken is very juicy and tender.  It was really good.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is not like a rotisserie chicken as the skin is not crispy.  At the end of the cooking time I basted the top of the chicken with its juices.   This was the.easiest recipe and virtually no cleanup involved.

Made this exactly as directed except I stuffed the cavity with whole onions rolled in the spice mixture as another reviewer suggested (not sure this was in any way beneficial) and using another couple of onions cut into quarters to line the bottom for the chicken to rest on.  Very tasty.  Served with roasted potatoes and baby carrots made a nice mid-week meal that was very easy to put together.

This was worth the effort.  Used a slow cooker liner to store the chicken while absorbing the dry rub in the fridge overnight and then just easily transferred to the slow cooker.  Also rough chopped some potatoes, carrots and leeks and put them under the chicken and they cooked up great while keeping the chicken from just soaking in liquids.  One thing I would adjust in the future is to not have the rub so spicy and maybe sweeten it up a bit with some brown sugar.  I ate the wings off before even removing the chicken from the cooker.  Gave me an idea to maybe do wings this way and finish off in the oven broiler.  Good stuff, a keeper.

I was really interested in this simple recipe for one reason only...I had all of the ingredients in my pantry....how cool is that?  Except for one thing.....I didn't have a chicken in my fridge.....but I had two 2-inch thick boneless pork chops from a big box store on hand. Sooooo, being the adventurist person I am, I mixed the ingredients for the rub in a bowl, put that in a large plastic baggie,  added the pork chops,  sealed the bag then tossed them together until the chops were covered with rub. I left them in the fridge overnight then baked them in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees. MUCH better than anything we had ever tasted!!!!

I was ready to try this with out changes but my husband asked me to make with the same seasonings I use for Beer Can Chicken instead which is a store bought Chili Lime rub.  So I did!  So I cannot comment on the seasonings noted in this recipe but putting a whole chicken in a crock pot for 8 hours on low made a wonderful tender chicken that was a hit with the family!  I flipped the chicken after 4 hours so it would cook more evenly.

Blah!!  I don't know where the rest of you buy your rotisserie chickens, but I get mine at Shoprite and Costco and they don't taste anything like this peppery recipe!  I followed the directions to a T, didn't change or substitute anything, and I was so looking forward to this meal when I got home from work today, based on all the reviews that said how good it was, just like rotisserie chicken.  So disappointed!  I will NOT be making this again.

I made this recipe with 3 teaspoons of salt instead of 4 but followed all the other instructions.  I added a layer of quartered potatoes, sliced onions and 2 stalks celery on the bottom under the whole chicken.  The seasoning flavored the potatoes and onions perfectly.    If you don't like pepper I would cut that back some, my husband commented it was a bit hot but we really liked the flavor.

Good! Didn't have some of the ingredients so switched out poultry seasoning for the thyme, reduced the salt and replaced it with beau monde seasoning and  skipped the cayenne because toddler doesn't like spicy

My 8 lb bird was done in four hours on low (my crock cooks hot) and it did not fall apart. Moist and delicious, and the gravy was great. No one in my family eats the skin, so I rubbed the spices under the skin on the breast, but on top of the skin everywhere else. The meat had a mild flavor, but I'm not sure I liked the cayenne on the small part of the breast that was in direct contact with the spices. I will leave that out next time. I put it straight in the crock with no waiting, used 1.5 tsp black pepper because I didn't have white, and halved the cayenne. Oh, and I used 1" thick onion slices to keep the bird out of the juices, and I put extra onions and garlic in the cavity.

We love this recipe!!!! I do especially due to faster cleanup.The first time I made this I failed to see the 24 set.and it came out GREAT. SECOND time I cooked w/o white pepper. Liked better. We have now got it down to a few slices of onions at the bottom of pot( not many) and not letting it set for 24 hours but just 2 or 3. Nor do we use the white pepper. However, every way we tried this it was delipcious as my 5 yr old grand daughter says. Just need to try it first to see where you can go with it. Thank you for sharing

Great recipe that I have made many times. I often will use either a quartered chicken or a pack of drumsticks instead of a whole chicken, but whenever I do chicken in the slow cooker this is the recipe I use.  I do not cut the salt because I usually don't eat much of the skin.  I also like to roughly chop onion, carrot, potato, and celery and use that as a bed for the chicken and then eat as a side. It also makes for an awesome chicken broth when I strain it out, chill it, and skim the fat (which I also save for cooking).

I used a 3lb organic chicken and put some sliced onions and carrots in the bottom of the crockpot. After 2 hours on high, there was no liquid, so I added some vegetable broth. After another 2 hours on low, everything was tender and juicy. The meat easily pulled away from the bone. The flavor was great!

I made the rub exactly as the recipe was written and took the advice of a reviewer and put some potatoes, carrots and thickly sliced onions in the bottom of the slow cooker.  I have made it 2 or 3 times and have cooked it on high for 4 hours and also on low for 8 hours.  It was delicious every time.  I used leftovers to make Chicken Pot Pie on the Run, which was wonderful.

I read the reviews and made some of the changes that others recommended. I cut the salt and cayenne in half. I also added some rosemary to the rub. I put the rub on the bird about an hour before I placed it in the crockpot.  In the cavity, I put half a lemon, a quartered onion, and some fresh sage. I cooked it on low for 6 hours on the rack in my crockpot. It was very good.

We loved it... I left out the cayenne pepper because we don't like food that is too spicy or better yet it doesn't like us .  Used a little less salt too but not much... It turned out wonderful and my husband loved it...just the two of us so I froze some of the chicken and used for another recipe which was great...

Delicious! I didn't have time to refrigerate - just defrosted my chicken, and since I'm not a fan of the skin, I skinned the whole chicken (otherwise you tend to lose most of the flavor in the skin), rubbed on the spices, and into the slow cooker. I didn't know if that would make it too dry, so I added a little bit of red wine, and about 1/4 cub butter on top. The meat was falling off the bones when I took it out of the slow cooker. Super taste and juicy.

Didn't find the spice blend very flavorfull. Chicken cook nicely but will use this methid with different spice blend. Halved potatoes and placed on bottom of slow cooker with carrot ,cekery and onion.  kept chicken out of juice nicely and vegetables were tasty.

My hubby said this was the best chicken ever.  I did make some adjustments such as only 2tsps salt,  1/2 tsp white and 1/2 tsp blk pepper and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, I used fresh thyme and as I had no onion powder I cut up an onion and put it on the bottom of the crock pot.  Myself and my boys found the skin too spicy but my hubby loved it.  The chicken was so tender and I made a gravy from the juices and OMG it was the best gravy ever.  I will definitely make again but will probably reduce the peppers even more so it's not so spicy.

Perfect way to make a whole chicken.  Flavor is awesome and the meat is moist.  I do a lot of slow cooking because of my schedule and this one was perfect.

I was not that impressed with this recipe.  The chicken was tasteless, the skin was not very tasty.  I did reduce the amount of salt, as was suggested, but it was bland.  Salt shouldn't be the flavor.  I found the combination bitter, the skin I ate.  I won't fix this again.

The was delicious! I halved the cayenne and it was still to spicy for my husband so I will leave it out altogether next time. The mix of spices made a great tasting chicken. This will definitely be on a regular rotation. I did not marinate it because it didn't have time. I just rubbed it and crocked it. Turned out great!

I made this exactly as stated. But I made a mistake.  I used red cayenne pepper instead of white pepper.  I didn't realize the mistake until I read the directions that says "white pepper".  I was worried it would be too spicy but no one seemed to complain. I knew it was a bit spicy so I made some gravy from the drippings and added boxed chicken stock to dilute the spicy flavor.  Anyway.....it was delicious and will definitely put in my dinner rotation.

Amazing. A total hit with all who eat it. Ingredients are staples in my house and it's perfect for the days i have to work. Just set it and forget it and voila! Yummy dinner! I took other people's advice and put potatoes and carrots on bottom. I usually use the leftovers for chicken pot pie afterwards.

I cant believe this recipe only has 100 reviews.. I used chicken leg quarters (4 large)- cut the cayenne and salt in half. (worried about the cayenne for the kids)- Added one cup of water before cooking to make extra stock.. Absolutely fabulous.. Falling off the bone good.. All three kids licked their plates clean.. Happy momma.

Made this yesterday - for the 3rd time.  I did not marinade overnight.  I laid the chicken on top of 3 carrots placed on the bottom of the slow cooker.  Seasoned to taste and cooked on low for 7 hours.  It was excellent and so easy.

I added carrots, onion, and potato. Even with cooking the bird breast down the legs were the only part that was moist. It was also very bland. I'm going to try it again, but adding chicken broth and doubling the spices.

This was easy. This was great. What more can you want? And yes, it tasted  like a rotisserie store bought chicken.  I made it exactly as shown.  I did follow Chef Johns advice of raising the bird on foil balls to prevent it being soggy. Another great idea. 
It is now a favorite.

I've never done a chicken this way before and was really pleased with the results. Mine was done well in advance of the 8 hour mark, and I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to get everything nice and crispy. I also propped up the chicken on some sliced potatoes which were very tasty. The juices made for a nice GF gravy, thickened with just a bit of cornstarch. I didn't have time to let the bird sit overnight but will try that next time to compare!

Excellent. Absolutely use all the salt- that's the secret- it's the overnight dry brining that makes it so juicy. I followed recommendations and put foil balls on the bottom so it wasn't sitting in grease and added an onion to the cavity. This is the first time I've been happy w a whole crock pot chicken. The meat is moist and pleasant And my whole family- even the picky preschooler- enjoyed. Thanks!!!!

If I could give it 10 stars, I would! This is my husband's favorite chicken  seasoning. I do, as recommended cut the salt in half. 
I have made this with chicken thighs and breasts also. The smaller pieces allows even more spice, as there is more surface area to coat. I have made this at least ten times over the last couple years. I should have posted a raving review earlier. 
Thank you for sharing this amazing blend of spices for chicken. :)

I love my slow cooker so I'm always looking for recipes. This one did not fail. The skin absorbed most of the seasoning. Next time I will remove the skin before putting on the seasoning. The chicken was gobbled up with nothing leftover.

This was very good the only thing I didn't add just the cayenne pepper. I put inside of a slow cooker liner and left in the refrigerator overnight. Then made foil balls for the bottom left inside the liner made holes in liner so it would drip laid chicken on the foil. Came out very tender. With the dripping I made a gravy

We had this last night for dinner. I found I had to cook it a lot longer than the amount of time listed, and had to turn the slow cooker up to high for the last few hours just so we could eat at a decent time. What we ended up with tasted really good and was enjoyed by the whole family.
Next time I will put the chicken in first thing in the morning in order to have it ready in time for dinner.

I followed the directions but my chicken ended up floating in liquid that pulled all the moisture from the chicken. Maybe it was the chicken but I won't try it again.

It was easy enough to make, I rubbed it all onto a whole chicken, but I was disappointed as the flavor didn't get infused into the entire chicken, just the skin.  My chicken thermometer never popped up so the white meat was a little dry, but still edible.  No changes made.

Reading the reviews I was eager to try this recipe.  I'm used to the slow cooker and chicken thighs method and have only roasted a chicken in my cooker.  My husband and I thought this was just okay.  To be fair I only marinated it for 3 hours, but still felt there was just something missing.  Don't get me wrong - the chicken was moist and delicious, but the rub lacked something.  Don't think I'll try this again.

I used 3 very large carrots,1 full spanish onion and 4 stalks of celery. 2 1/2 lb chicken(grain fed) cooked on high for 1  hour added the vegetables and then left on high for another hour. Turned it down to low for 3 more hours.

Thanks but I agree with some other reviews that all that work yields an extremely plain tasting chicken. I was forced to add bbq sauce after I shredded it. I was so excited too bc of all the great reviews. On to another recipe!

I made it with the spices as directed. Next time, I will double the spices as I thought it was a little bland. I made a gravy with the juices and next time I will add 1/2 cup water with one chicken bullion cube to really make it delicious. I lined the crock pot with aluminum foil and that really helped with the clean up. The flavor is fantastic, I just felt it needed to be a little stronger. I used a leave in meat thermometer, and even after 7 hours it only read 160. After carving, it was all completely cooked though. Super moist and yummy. I will make it again with the noted changes.

Way too much salt!  With the other seasonings it's tasty enough. Taste wise and ease of prep up it to 4 stars.  I did use smoked paprika to give it a barbeque twang (and to help use up the box store sized jar of the stuff that I bought on a whim). As for putting it in a re-sealable bag overnight, I used a crock pot liner and just dropped it in the cooker the next morning. No muss, no fuss. Made for a super easy clean-up too. They can be pricey in the supermarket, but Mallwart has them a lot cheaper. Cheaper still is Amazon.com. They sell a version that is very reasonable.
