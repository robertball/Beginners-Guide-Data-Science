Okay, this is my recipe and I made a mistake-- you're supposed to add TWO cans of the tomatoes.  I'm from Texas and not afraid of a little spice, so I use the hot Jimmy Dean sausage, one can of hot Ro*Tel, and a can of regular Ro*Tel.  I always take this to parties where I know men will be in attendance.  They get their wives to ask me for the recipe!

I made this for a shower and it was gone so fast I had to scrape the pan to get a taste of it myself!  Everyone wanted the recipe and raved about it.  Highly recommend.

Thank you for this recipe. I made it twice. 1st time I made it exactly how it instructed me to. It was to runny for me but was still very good.  The 2nd time I used: 1lb hot bulk sausage 2 can rotel tomatoes w/ green chilis 8 oz sourcream & 8 oz cream cheese& 1T crushed peppers. 1/4 c shredded cheese & 1 sm onion diced After mixing everything together I topped it with about 1cup of shredded cheese & baked it @ 350 till cheese was melted. We loved it!

I made this and brought to work to heat it up in a little crockette, and it was almost gone before it got heated through.  My colleagues say it's the best!!

Another great recipe found on allrecipes. We like spicy-hot foods, so I made two easy changes, substituting hot turkey sausage for the pork sausage, and Ro*Tel Hot Diced Tomatoes with Habaneros for those with green chile peppers. Thank you, Carey, for sharing.

I would give 5 stars but I like it slightly different.  I use 1lb of hot pork sausage, 8oz cream cheese, 16oz sour cream, and 1 or 2 10oz cans of rotel tomatoes. No onions or red pepper for me.  I will however throw in extra green chiles or jalapenos sometimes.

Just what I was looking for.  Quick to make and oh my gosh..I could have eaten the whole pot by myself.  I added 1 extra container of cream cheese and only 1/2 the sour cream called for.  I also added just a small bit of garlic and ground red pepper to the mix as it cooked!! This is going to be my go to for hot dip now!  I left out the onion, cause I didn't happen to have any in the kitchen.  It is now a Football Sunday must have for my husband!

We all really liked this dip! I was out of sour cream( what I thought was sour cream was actually cottage cheese!) so I had to leave that out.And I added half a chopped green pepper when I added the onion. This was still really good though. I halved the recipe but next time will def. make a full batch!!!

Wow.  Don't understand how this rated so high.  If it weren't for spicyness of the hot sausage I used it would have been completely tasteless.  Very bland and a waste of time and ingredients.

This turned out great.  I took this to a bbq where I knew there would be several men who like hot & spicy foods.  I used the hot flavored sausage, one can Rotel Extra Hot diced tomatoes with chilies and one can Rotel Mexican tomatoes with lime and cilantro.  Served with Frito's Scoops.  I'll definitely make this again.

Wonderfully rich and flavorful. I must admit, the combination of ingredients grossed me out at first, but the reviews were so rave, I had to try it.  I'm glad I did.  Great stuff!

This dip is AMAZING!!  I always take copies of the recipe with me when I take it somewhere because I know I will have several requests for it. It has quickly become one of my standards for parties.  YUM!

Great dip!! Perfect for Christmas and everyday parties. I added a little garlic, extra tomotoes and next time I'll add cream of mushroom soup to make it creamier.

I just made this for a BBQ on the 4th of July.  I made it on the stovetop and then transferred it to a slow cooker for serving. The bowl was practically licked clean.  I served it with tortilla chips and slices of sourdough baguette. Definitely a keeper!

I have a really good sausage dip recipe that I take to every gathering and I thought I'd try this one just for a change. Because I was comparing this one with my old recipe, it was just okay. Everyone agreed mine was better.

It was a little too tangy for me.  But I took it to a superbowl party and it was a huge hit.  Next time, I think I'll just stick with my usual.  But thank you for the recipe.

Awesome!  EASY to make.  I've been looking for this recipe for a long time - my aunt used to make it years ago.  Made it for a small party at our house, it was delicious as usual and my boyfriend especially loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

LOVED this.  I made it and stuck it in my slow cooker for the night, so it was always nice and hot. Just had to make sure I gave it a little stir once in awhile.  Have since been asked to bring it to another get together from someone who was at my house and had it.  This will be a hit.

This is the best dip ever! Everytime I make this its all gone and everyone loves it. I like to double the canned diced tomatoes w/ green chiles for extra spice.

Good base. I doubled the chili spice, added pinto and Black beans and substituted cheddar with Cream cheese. Came out great and basically doubled the dip.

I LOVE this recipe, everyone loves it and there is never any left over!.  I changed it a bit though.  I add a few cloves of garlic, 1 large onion, about 5 large mushrooms minced and a small can of green chiles to the sausage mixture while cooking.   Also at the end I add some of the shredded habanero kraft cheese for some extra zing!

I made this for my company Christmas party and EVERYONE raved about how good it was and wanted the recipe. The recipe calls for a tablespoon of red pepper flakes which I reduced to a teaspoon. That along with the rotel diced tomatoes and peppers gave it plenty of spice. Will definitely make this again as it was very easy to throw together at the last minute.

I found this recipe to be quick, easy, and flavorful!  I did add just a little tomato soup(for a little more flavor) and served it with toasted frech bread.  My family loved it!

I Love Love love this dip. My best friend and I makes this all the time- we call it crack dip because it's so addictive. The only things we do different are- we don't add sour cream or the red pepper flakes and I usually cook it in the crockpot too for about 2 hours. It is so yummy! It's great to play around with and add blackbeans or hamburger instead of the sausage or even with the sausage. You can't go wrong with this one!

I made this again, this time I used Morningstar Sausage Style Cumbles (which is actually veggies made to taste like sausage) all that I can say is "EVERYONE" raved about the recipe. I had to tell them that it was not really sausage, no one knew the difference.  I also used low fat cream cheese and sour cream.  I can not tell you how many people I had to e-mail the recipe to.  By changing the few ingredients this recipe became low fat and not all that bad for you!  You must try it!!!  The following is my original review...
This was a big hit!  I added sliced black olives to it and put it into a bread bowl...people were breaking apart the bread to get the very last bites of the dip.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno's for even more of a kick.  I will be making this one again!

This is an excellent hot dip, and 'spicy' fans will love it. It does make a lot. Don't do what I did by forgetting to drain the diced tomatoes--big mistake - the dip was too runny. But it was still awesome in taste!

This was awesome! Received lots of great feedback and was asked for the recipe. The sour cream makes it really creamy, but next time I will add less, maybe only 3/4 to 1 cup. Definitely follow Carey's suggestion...use 2 can of tomatoes and chilis.

Made this dip for a superbowl party and turned out good.  I used spicy Jimmy Dean sausage and with the added crushed pepper, it was good and spicy.  The sour cream made the dip creamy and did not require reheating or serving in a crockpot to maintain its yummyness.  I will make this again.

Awesome stuff... I did made several changes, although the recipe would be excellent as is.  I used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes and a 4 oz can of green chilis instead of the pre-mixed 10oz can.  I also added some diced pepperoni.  This is a perfect snack to make for a football party... guys really like this stuff.  I also served it with pieces of baguette... really tasty.

This recipe was very good, and I would make it again. I did however use Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage for the recipe as we like things spicy...as it was I'd still probably add more spice next time. I'd also add a bit more cream cheese or some other shredded/melted white cheese as it was not quite as thick as I'd expected. It was great on those tostito "dipper boats" we call them.

Recipe calls for two can rotelle tomatoes. One spicy one not.
I made this as written and found it needed a lot of tweaking. I added a chipotle pepper, half a fresh jalapeño and one cup of cheddar cheese.  Still seemed lacking. I think next time I will up cream cheese and reduce the sour cream.  The sc seemEd to be too predominant.

This was such a great snack.  I added the 2nd can of Rotel as the recipe owner suggests above.  One can was chunky and one was fire roasted. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and used1.5 pounds of sausage, half hot, half mild.  I used 1.5 sticks of cream cheese and 4 oz of sour cream for a thicker consistency.  Yum!

Simple and delicious! I didn't have chiles but added extra crushed red pepper (during cooking) and used my own very ripe garden-fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes.

I love love love this recipe, it's so delicious. After getting everything mixed in the skillet, I put in a baking dish and sprinkle shredded cheeses on top (mozarella and cheddar) and bake until melted. It's so good, and the next day, flavors are even better!

I have made this dip time and time again by request from my co - workers for potlucks and by my family for get togethers. I usually use ground red pepper instead of crushed. This recipe is easy to adjust to your personal tastes, adding more sour cream or cream cheese....sometimes if it's more men that will be eating it, I double up the meat...every time - a winner! Thanks!

This appetizer is particularly popular with the men.  Thick and hearty.  I did increase the tomatoes and green chili peppers to 2 cans and reduced the sour cream to 3/4 cup.

A great variation of a dip I already make.  I have had it for dinner and served it with only tortilla chips...TASTY!

Made exactly as written, except I didn't use the crushed red pepper, not all of my friends are in to hot.  Everyone liked this, it was a great recipe.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a very good recipe.  I made this on the spur of the moment, so I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I substituted the tomato/chilis for salsa and didn't have red peppers on hand.  Still turned our yummy!

Made this for a work potluck and several people asked for the recipe.  I used a lot less onion than called for, because I didn't have that much on hand, but it was still good.  I also used lower fat cream cheese and sour cream, which didn't seem to affect it.

My husband loved it, but I didn't.  I didn't like the texture of the red pepper flakes.  I think I would use hot red peppers to flavor this instead.

took this to a superbowl party - it was average - a bit too salty for my taste.  guess the combo of processed chesse and sausage will do that to you.
