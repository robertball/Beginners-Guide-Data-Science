It's a great easy beef stew! I added Kale and Sriracha to take this amazing recipe to the next level.

This stew has a lot of flavor! Really enjoyed it on the slightly hot side. Didn't change anything and will make this again with more corn next time.

Yummy and easy. I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies and cut up the potatoes to put in. Filling on a cold winter night.
