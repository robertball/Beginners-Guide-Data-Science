OMG just made this as written in the recipe. It is so good.  The "dough" actually tasted and had texture of bread.  I really couldn't believe it.  I imagine you could put just about anything on this too.  Next time I think I'll try an alfredo sauce with sausage or something.  I will definitely make this again.

I am rating the crust only, since I put different toppings on it.  The idea is great, and the instructions to make it were spot on. 
 It came out of the oven looking very much like a pizza crust.  It held up well with sauce and toppings on it, and we could actually pick the slice up.  But the taste and texture were so off for us that we just couldn't enjoy it.   We ATE it, but won't make it again.

Sorry, did not taste like "real" pizza, except for the toppings. Better than some, but a discernible texture difference which my spouse and I found off-putting. I fear my expectations are set at an unrealistic level.

This was so good.  It almost, 99% tasted like real pizza.  It was even better cold the next day.  Already planning to make this again so I have some easy road trip food.

I precooked some mushrooms to add and it absolutely was the best home made crust Iâ€™ve ever had. Would definitely make it again
