This is YUMMY margarita. I did add some 7-Up to it to cut the sour power of the lemonade. I've also made it with one can each of frozen lemonade and limeade.

Love this for the summer.  I usually cut the vodka down to 1 cup and add another beer other wise it is a little strong and too lemony.

This was way too sweet for me, I had to add two cans of club soda.
