My husband loved this! I don't know what it tasted like because I could'nt have the oranges (allergic) but I made it for my husband, then my friends, and they all loved it. It is great for small parties. GREAT RECIPE MICHELLE!

Watermelon Pucker works really well in this and I've used frozen strawberries and skipped the ice to make an alcoholic slushie. Add a little cream and it really takes it over the top. My husband even likes this "girly" drink. (shhhhh.)
