In spite of its simple and few ingredients, or maybe because of its simple and few ingredients, this was deceptively and surprisingly good.   Basic and simple was just what I was after today (didn’t want to do a whole lot of monkeying around ) and this really panned out.  How, I asked myself, does one run of out yellow mustard?  I mean, think of the advance notice/warning one is given.   Dijon had to take its place and it was a most pleasant substitution, tho’  I have no doubt the yellow mustard would have been equally as good as well as given the potato salad that characteristic creamy yellow color.  I thought this would be too mayonnaise-y, preparing in advance to add some sour cream if necessary.  It wasn’t.  I thought it would be kind of blah, what with only salt and pepper for the seasoning, and was prepared to add other seasonings (dill was in the back of my mind).  It was anything but.  The flavor of the creamy potatoes I used coupled with the teensiest bite from the green onion, was all the good fresh flavor it needed.  When I think of most potato salads, with all their add-ins, this one seems like the best kept secret in Idaho.  (pun definitely not intended as I used small, new red potatoes) As this recipe’s first reviewer, I’m happy to give it two thumbs up.

To be honest, I hate making potato salad. But this was worth it. Very simple, and easier than most. I used country Dijon mustard since I didn't check my on hand ingredients first, and I use red potatoes skin on. Delish and better the next day.

This reminds me of my grandmother's recipe, I reduced the mustard and added dill pickle relish, we really enjoyed this.

Simple yet still tasty. I used chives from my garden in place of green onions, and used Dijon mustard instead of yellow. Also added in one pickle which was floating around solo in the jar. I'm used to my moms potato salad(czech recipe), ive become so accustomed to that which has lots going on and alot of different levels of flavor, I kind of missed that in this one. Overall though this is easy to prepare, and It can be customized to suit ones tastes which i love...you can always add something to a dish but cant always take something out. Thanks for sharing :)

This is a fantastic classic potato salad! I followed the amounts and ingredients listed to the letter. But I added a couple things. We had leftover bacon, so I crumbled in a couple slices, as well as chopped up one dill pickle and a splash of pickle juice. I like the little bit of dill and garlic from the pickle. Next time I'll add some sliced radishes, my Mom always put that in her potato salads. I added the recommended paprika as well. A true classic, thanks for sharing your recipe! :)

Just realized I haven't reviewed this recipe although I've made it several times as written. The ingredients and proportions are spot on. Thanks for sharing, Rockin Robin!
