Awesome!!!!! Made just as written, except I just had to top it with some crumbled blue cheese! I used maybe 1/4-1/3 cup olive oil to get it to the right consistency for us. Great with veggies, pita chips, pretzels and tortilla chips. I will def be making this again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
