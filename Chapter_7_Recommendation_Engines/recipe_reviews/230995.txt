I rated this a 5 after I made it a couple of times and tweaked the recipe. First we use bone-in thinner chops, "cheap" chops and they came out tough the 1st time, 2nd time we like extra sauce so I doubled the sauce recipe, but it was even saltier than the 1st time. Finally my husband let me try a 3rd time, so this is what I did. Brine your chops! 4 cups of water w/2 Tbls. of table salt and 2 Tbls (packed) brown sugar. Brine for 2 hrs. I use olive oil. Sear the chops 2 1/2 min each side, remove from pan and set aside. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic, and roughly 1/2 cup of minced onion, and saute'. Whisk 1 cup beef broth, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 4 Tbls. brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper. Return the chops to the pan and simmer, covered 3-5 min on each side. Remove chops again and cover with foil. Thicken the sauce with corn starch. Serve with egg noodles and greenbeans. Try it, you will love it!! I promise! Even my "cheap" chops came out succulent, juicy and tender!! Definitely a keeper for my recipe box!!

Excellent flavor with a beautiful presentation. I cut back on the soy sauce and made up for it with more broth to avoid over saltiness.   Also,  I did reduce  the cooking time drastically, knowing boneless pork chops cook quickly and dry out quickly too.   Alas, they were still tough.  No fault of this recipe necessarily, although I can't imagine what cooking these for 30-35 minutes would do to them.  I just would consider a pork cut with a little more fat if I was to make this again.

These are great!  Garnished with green onion just topped it off perfectly.  Don't over cook these - mine were done in 20 minutes.

Great way to prepare a boneless pork chop!  My husband and I loved the taste of this recipe.  I used low sodium soy sauce, so I did not experience the saltiness some of the reviews mentioned.  When I returned the chops (1 1/2" thickness) to the pan, I simmered for 10 minutes on each side and they were perfectly done.  To thicken the sauce, I added a little Wondra® and it was the consistency I was looking for.  Served these with 'Smashed Cauliflower Side Dish' and 'Chik-Fil-A® Slaw (Copycat)' both from AR.  The meal was delicious and I will be using this recipe again.

Made a couple of changes (of course).  Still think the original recipe would be the bomb.  Ingredient change was using chicken broth instead of beef. I already had one open in need of use.  Left out additional 2 teaspoons of oil.  Due to reviews on overcooking the pork chops, I quick fried them and took out.  Made the sauce and then added the chops back in just for maybe 5 minutes to absorb flavor and took out again.  Added the cornstarch/water mix.  It thickened up nicely.  (If it's too thick, add a little more broth.)  Tossed in the chops to coat at the end.  I enjoyed them very much and will make again.  I used Thin pork chops with bones.  Very tender and would definitely make these again.  I would extend the cooking time if the chops were thicker.

My family found this dish good but very salty.  I doubled the sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  May try it again but cut half the soy sauce in half and replace the missing liquids with either more broth or some white wine.

Beautiful glossy looking sauce (although I only had to use half the cornstarch/water mix), but as so many others have said it's salty.  Next time will increase the amount of broth (use low sod) and cut the soy in half.  I had lovely inch thick chops which after searing and then covering (even tho I removed after only 10 minutes) were overdone.  Would suggest leaving lid off pan and watching carefully.  If you sear, 5-7" should be enough.  Will def make again after tweaking to our tastes.  Other reviewers suggestion of serving over/with egg noodles was perfect.

The only thing that I changed in this recipe was that I seasoned the meat with onion and garlic powder, turmeric, Italian herbs, salt and black pepper. I also did not cook 30 minutes nor did I cook 5 minutes per side. I wanted my pork fork tender and it was.

Wow, we were impressed with this one!  I knew dinnertime was going to be rushed, so I made this early in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated it, and simply reheated it when it was time for dinner.  I did double the sauce and cut back just slightly on the lite soy sauce I used.  My sauce thickened nicely, so I didn’t need to use all of the cornstarch/water slurry.  I browned my chops on medium high heat for four minutes on each side.  After browning, they were almost done, so I only needed to simmer them for a few minutes when I reheated them.  The only change I’d made next time, would be to cut back the soy sauce a little further and just use 3 T. in my double recipe of sauce (for two chops).  These were very good and the sauce gives the chops a beautiful sheen.  I’d also like to try this sauce on grilled pork tenderloin!

I enjoyed this one, as did my boyfriend. I used 3 boneless chops, displaced the red pepper flakes for paprika and then didn't use the 2tbsp of water. I also didn't cook it for any of the above times, though I did watch it like a hawk as I seared it and then simmered it covered with the mixture to ensure it retained it's moisture. I ended up topping it with mini peppers sautéed in butter and served it with pasta. It came out amazing.

I followed the advice of the majority of reviewers by cutting back on the cooking time and decreasing the amount of soy sauce and upping the beef broth.  I regularly decrease soy sauce amounts in recipes as I usually find listed amounts too salty.  Wish I'd omitted the oil called for in the sauce preparation.  It wasn't needed as there was an ample amount left in the pan after browning the chops. I'll definitely make this again with these changes as the taste is delish!

I used the thin pork chops and only simmered them for twenty minutes also, I used the less sodium soy sauce.  I will be making them again.

The sauce on this is fabulous. The only change I would make is to not cook them so long. Mine were over done for my taste. Next time I would get a good brown on the meat and the take it out and let it rest while the sauce cooks down with the pork drippings, then when the sauce is almost ready finish the pork in the sauce keeping a close eye on it.

I love this recipe.  I use the thick pork chops with bone in.  I follow the recipe exactly as written.  I did not find them too salty however I do use the low sodium soy sauce.  Such a rich flavor...I try to make extra sauce since I usually serve this dish with rice and it's nice to have the sauce for that.  Really YuMmY!!!

We had this for lunch today. The taste was not bad, and we were okay with the saltiness, because we ate it over linguine (what I had on hand). However, with pork, I find there is one way to assure tenderness when cooking on the stove -- sear it on each side quickly (seconds, not minutes) and turn heat down to low or simmer to cook for a longer period of time, covered. I followed the directions anyway and the meat was tough. I think I will make this again using my own method and bone-in chops, because the sauce was very tasty.

We thought this was a great tasting recipe. We will definitely try it again and like many others, we will decrease the soy sauce and increase broth the next time.

Made it tonight everyone loved it! Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce, a little salty for me. I doubled the sauce part not knowing if there would be enough for my sauce loving family. A little goes along ways so next no need to double it. This recipe is on the "do again" list. We all thought it would work good for chicken too.

Wonderful! I used farm-fresh local thick pork chops. I followed the recipe, tried to! I didn't whisk all ingredients before adding them to the frying pan ...didn't notice the whisk direction until I'd already dumped ... I probably allowed the garlic to "brown" a bit much. I cooked the chops exactly 30 minutes, covered. I did not finish with thickening. I poured the juice as-is. They were the best chops I have ever had.

This was really good. I didn't follow recipes exact measurements but I did use all the required ingredients. let me tell you very flavorful. I made with some white rice : P yummy. all I needed was to add broccoli and it would have tasted exactly like beef broccoli from the chinese fast food. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was really easy to follow and was super tasty. I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of soy sauce and used a little more beef broth.  I also sauteed diced onions with the garlic to give it some more flavor.  The sauce was delicious! Not too sweet or salty. 

I used chops that were about an inch thick, and unfortunately 30-35 minutes was far too long on the stove. I would definitely make these agin, but I will reduce the cooking time to about 20 minutes.

This was really amazing. I did pepper and lightly salt the pork before browning them. They were moist and tender. We really enjoyed the flavor. Only down side is even after 5 minutes my sauce never thickened up like we had hoped. Everything else was done so we just served it anyway. I think next time I will make sure I set aside a little more time so the sauce does thicken up as my hunny thought it would really add to the flavors

Was a hit in my house as I made for dinner last nite.  Husband gave the whole meal a 9.5.  My husband is French and very fussy about food.  I pared this with the Ranch Style Potatoes and a small salad and it was a perfect meal!  Will definitely make again!

I made these on a whim. I was looking for something different from our ordinary fried or broiled chops. These were AH-MAZING! My husband demanded they go in our regular rotation and he asks for them often! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious, and my new go to brown sauce recipe!   I followed the advice from one of the comments--brined the pork chops, doubled the beef broth and brown sugar measurements while keeping the soy sauce the same.  I served this with fried rice, and it was really so flavorful.  I'm definitely trying this recipe with chicken and maybe I'll add cashews and broccoli to the mix at the end.

My family really loved it.  The sauce was just right … not too sweet.  The Pork Chops  were so tender * everyone wanted more sauce.  They want me to make it again!

Port Chops were a bit small so I cooked it for less time.  Sauce is very savory, not spicy, even with Habañero Garlic.  Don't worry about too much spice.

Rich tangy flavor from the sauce makes these pork chops delicious. I used some leftover thin cut pork chops, browning for 3 minutes per side and then simmering in the sauce for 15 minutes. I don't know if it would be better simmering longer or if they would get too tough, but they came out pretty tender.

The sauce for these chops was nice and zingy, made the sauce just as written, but only cooked three chops (we enjoy extra sauce.)  Did a quick sear on the chops, about two minutes per side, and cooked them about 15 minutes.  Really good served with fettuccini noodles.

This recipe is great. I've made it twice now. I used low sodium soy sauce because I really don't like salty food and I only cook the chops at the end for about five minutes. They come out a little pink and very moist. I will definitely make this again.

Really good. Follow recipe pretty much exactly except I doubled the sauce, used boneless pork chops and didn't cook it more than about 20 minutes. Served with stir fried bok choy and steamed fried noodles. Very nice dinner.

I didn't have any broth but had a can of beef consommé in my pantry, so I used that. I used 2 cloves of garlic but otherwise followed the rest of the ingredients. I also used low sodium soy sauce. I didn't cook for 30 minutes, but after browning on both sides for 5 minutes and putting aside until sauce was done then added back to the finished sauce only long enough to coat and cook down sauce a few minutes. Delicious, the family loved it and I plan on making this again soon!

Sauce was nice (I used chicken broth). Presentation was beautiful (check out my pic). But pork chops were tough. I might try the brine that another reviewer suggested next time. I also added half of a minced onion to my sauce along with the garlic. I was also thinking I would just leave the second cooking in the sauce out and just remove the chops form the pan, make the sauce and pour that over the chops. I really think that extra time cooking in the sauce it what makes them tough.  I served them with brown rice and broccoli.

The  sauce was very delicious with the pork chops. I read all the reviews before cooking and so I cut down on the simmering time to about 7 minutes on each side for thin boneless pork chops. They were not tough at all. I also seasoned them beforehand with some adobo, garlic powder, and Cajun seasoning. As per the reviews I bumped up the beef broth and cut back on the soy sauce and added a little bit extra  minced garlic. It had that savoury, sweet, spicy flavor that I love. Had with some mac and cheese, broccoli and cauliflower, and tostones. Very tasty.

I can not count how many times I have made this, it's a normal meal in my house now. My fiancé is insane over these things and and so am I. The flavor is excellent, it's a blend of sweet and savory and the pork comes out so tender. Also I leave out the red pepper. Still tastes amazing! Strongly recommend this.

Very moist and tender if you brine the chops first. I make this in a cast iron skillet and reduce cooking time to 20-25 minutes.

We absolutely love this recipe, by far our favorite pork chop recipe.   As many other have suggested I cut the cooking time in half.  They taste fantastic.    Serve them bad boys over a bed of brown rice and Boooooooooommmmm.

I didn't have beef broth so I used vegetable broth. I didn't use cayenne pepper (I have three young children) and I didn't make gravy. Didn't want extra calories. My husband raved about it. Said it was the best pork chops I have made in quite awhile. I didn't change a lot but it was awesome.

I should have heeded Baking Nana's warning more about being careful not to overcook these!  My chops were an inch thick, so I thought I'd be safe cooking them for only 22 minutes.  Wrong!  Mine were way overdone---gray all the way through.  So sad!  I will make these again but not cover the chops with a lid at all, and I'll be sure to use that technique where you test for doneness by touching the meat in the middle---if it feels like that fatty tissue by your thumb when your hands are lightly clenched, then it's done!  The sauce was very tasty, so I'll be sure to try this again.  I must admit that my hubby liked his pork very well done (I haven't done a very good job of training him in the new ways of pork--where it's good to still have it pink in the middle)!  Thanks for this recipe!

No changes, 10 and 14 year old loved it. Tender and loved flavor. Glad I didn't add extra red pepper flakes as one comment suggested-plenty as is for us!

I followed the other recommendations to use 1 c broth with the soy sauce. I used ground red pepper instead of flakes. Agree with everyone, the sauce is the star of this dish. Served it with egg noodles. Yum.

I was specifically looking for a pork recipe that would be tender and moist, so I tried this recipe.  I loved the sauce and the flavor of this recipe, as did my family.  Unfortunately the cook times for the pork and the sauce were WAY off.  I chose to prepare it to the 30 minute cook time since it was a range of 30-35.  I rotated halfway through as suggested.  The pork was too tough and dry, even with the sauce.  My jaws were hurting after chewing just a few bites.  The cook time was too long and my family did not enjoy the meat at all, so I had to prepare a second meal after this one :(  Also, the sauce on a simmer was taking a lot longer than the 5 minutes listed in the recipe, so after waiting 15 minutes and it still not thickening up, I cranked up the heat and boiled the sauce over medium heat and it finally thickened.  I will try this recipe again, but I will need to adjust all of the times and temps to see what will truly make a tender pork.  Excellent sauce, just needs adjustments on the times and temps.

Doubled the gravy. Seasoned the chops with Mortons Season All, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder and Pepper. I also use Low Sodium Soy Sauce to cut down the salt intake due to using Season All which is a season salt.

The sauce recipe is very good.
I used less soy and more brown sugar and garlic.
Great.
But I took the chops out of the pan in 20 minutes they were at 145 which is done.
They are not soft when cooked like this at all.
However soft or not the sauce makes up for it.

Superb sauce, also very useful for chicken pieces (light or dark) and beef tips as well. My changes were unsalted beef stock, 2 Tbsp of Coconut Aminos (low sodium soy substitute) and then sauteed onions and green peppers with the garlic. Entire batch of sauce was only 236 sodium, so much better then BBQ, Sweet n Sour, or Honey Mustard. Will definitely make again!

I make these in the crock pot & they are very very tender. Very thick chops I sear 1st. Bone in. I've never had good luck with boneless-too dry. I cut way back on the brown sugar (we don't like sweet), use low sodium soy & broth, cause yes it can be salty, depending on ones taste. I don't add oil to the sauce either-rendered chops produce enough oil- unless a few drops of sesame oil for more flavor. We like ours spicy so add more pepper flakes and a splash of either dry red wine or rice vinegar since we like the tang. I do increase the liquid amounts for more sauce. I know, I know....rating with changes, but I think most cooks tweak their dishes. But this is a really good taste!

Made per instructions--but I DOUBLED the sauce, which was a very good call!! The sauce is the key here--and I got from it a real bold, almost smoky essence to it's taste.; I made it first, giving it time to "marry" in the bowl ( use the LOW SODIUM soy sauce  and beef broth ).  Using boneless half-inch chops ( 8 total ),  I used my trusty Jaccard tenderizer on both sides before seasoning / browning them ( salt, pepper and Mrs. Dash Table Blend  ); really helped with tenderizing them, along with simmering them in that wonderful sauce for 25 minutes.  The only other  tweak I did was add in some sliced onion strings and sliced mushrooms I didn't want to waste.  I really am interested in trying the brining suggestion next time---and I'm thinking of applying this recipe base to chicken, as well.  Stay tuned: Updates forthcoming!!

I found this recipe to be pretty bland on its own, and that’s not for lack of salt. I used low sodium broth and soy sauce and it was plenty salty.  If I were to make it again I’d probably add some onions, more garlic, and some kind of spice.

I could eat this every week!  Made it as written except I browned the pork chops in garlic infused olive oil because I can't eat garlic.  I adjusted the cooking time to 20 minutes because my stovetop cooks fast.

So I've made this recipe a bunch of times. But I must say I made some big adjustments. 
I slice the pork into strips, season with salt and pepper. Brown the pork and take out.
Then I add 4 garlic cloves minced to pan, sliced red pepper, and slice mushrooms. I cook that down a bit. 
Then I make the sauce according to the recipe, EXCEPT, I make 2 cups worth of the sauce.
Add back in slice pork, cover and simmer for 40 minutes. 
whisk beef stock and a tablespoon of corn starch add to thicken sauce. 
Serve over white rice. 
Makes a delicious spicy stir fry.

1 word = YUM!  Knowing my family likes extra sauces & gravy's, I did 4x.  I used low sodium soy and low sodium broth because that's what this household always uses and has on hand.  Other than that (and multiplying the sauce by a bunch), everything else was the same.  For 4 boneless 1" chops I only cooked a total of 20 minutes (10 per side) at the end, keeping watch with my thermometer.  PERFECTO!  Obviously I went overboard on the sauce, so had plenty left over.  I saved the extra and used it on grilled salmon.  Another winner!!  I'm guessing the wonderful flavor of this sauce would also go great on chicken!  This is a keeper!!!  Thank you!!!  PS - I had this with whole grain orzo that I made with chopped asparagus.  Put the chops on top of the orzo/asparagus and added the sauce on top, sprinkling a little chopped green onions.  Getting hungry thinking just about it!  :-)

I follow this recipe exactly, except I double the liquid. My family LOVES this meal. If I try to cook chops a different way, I get dirty looks :). I serve over rice and usually steamed broccoli. Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe. I made it for my sister and her grandkids and they couldn't get enough.  I sautee mushrooms and onions before garlic.  I subbed out chicken broth for beef broth and it was still good.  Subbed Maple Syrup for brown sugar. Add more red pepper flakes. Yummy!

So delicious, yet so simple!  Followed the recipe exactly, and will definitely make this again.  Left-overs were even better when the sauce thickened even more.  Serve with something that you can sop up the delicious, savory sauce.  Yum.

Really like this. I did like others Ann's halved the soy sauce replacing with mute beef broth. Doubled the garlic. I think this would taste even better with a little pineapple juice. I'll have to try that next time. I have saved and will make again.

I spiced up the boneless pork, garlic, black pepper, turmeric, Italian spices, sage, brown sugar, red pepper flakes, and some Traeger rub, seared it in some olive oil, set it aside, then added fresh garlic for a minute,  cooked up the broth using chicken stock made fresh earlier today from thighs, cut back on the soy sauce to just dribbling based on earlier reviews. Threw the pork back into the mix and simmered it for awhile b/c it felt tough, cooked maybe an hour, removed the meat, added the corn starch mixed in cold water, Great sauce and great pork. Tender and tasty. I like things well done and was not sure of the reports of cooking so quickly. I find a slow cook for a longer time helps the tenderness.

Great overall taste.  Had to substitute honey for the brown sugar and I don’t think it adversely affected the final results.  Was really good.  I will say that since my pork chops were very thin and as a result the finished product was a little on the dry side.  The awesome taste certainly made up for my cut choice.  Very good recipe that is easy for whipping up a delicious meal in a reasonable amount of time.  Can’t wait to eat the leftovers.

I added green onions to the sauce. My fiance loved it. I made mashed potatoes with them and he put some of the sauce over them. Said he could have eaten more, but it was just a trial so I guess next time I make more than just the 2 chops he usually eats

Excellent combination of flavors in this dish!  As a side dish, serve with Ramen noodles, to which finely minced onion and frozen peas and carrots were added.  This was a big hit with my family!

Very good and easy. I used low salt soy sauce and unsalted chicken broth (didn't have beef broth on hand) so we had no issues with these being too salty.

Yummy! The soy sauce gives it a taste similar to dishes I've tried from Japanese cookbooks (for westerners). I doubled the sauce ingredients (because I accidentally dumped in extra b. sugar) and mixed that in the pan first, added my pork chops, then added about half a dozen diced red potatoes I had on hand (sprinkled the potatoes with salt/pepper). The sauce covered almost everything. It cooked maybe about 5-10 minutes, before I added white mushrooms over the top of it all (added salt/pepper again), and then cooked until the pork had been in there 20 minutes. Everything was just right! I didn't bother to use the corn starch.  It was delicious!

So disappointed!  I made this as written when it comes to the ingredients and the amounts.  Way too salty!  It tasted like we were eating salt by the spoonful. Cook time is another problem.  Total cook time is 40 – 45 minutes.  A small, boneless pork chop only takes a few minutes to cook.  I browned the chops as directed.  When I added them back to the sauce, I realized they were already cooked all the way through.  I let them simmer a couple of minutes so they could soak in some  sauce and then removed.  By that point, they were overcooked, dry, and tough.  They would have been jerky had I cooked for the full 30 min.  This has the potential to be a good recipe, but you will need to make a lot of changes as suggested by other reviewers.

Made as directed.  Because why would you do anything else the first time?  DH loves porkchops and I generally can't stand them, but I will make them for him.   We both thought the sauce was delicious, but a little bit salty.  And I have a wicked "salt" tooth.  So next time, and there will definitely be one, I will try it with lower-sodium soy and see how it goes.  Yummy recipe, I even stole an extra bit of his!

This was fantastic!  I didn't  have any beef bullion, so I used a package of dry brown gravy.  I added the other ingredients (minus the oil) and a half cup of water.  I used the gravy over the chops and potatos.  I will be making this again soon!

This was a fairly simple dish that was well received by most of my kids. I'm cooking for a family of six so I doubled the meat and tripled the sauce.  In an effort to be sure it wasn't too salty, I used one cup of broth and 1/2 cup of reduced sodium soy sauce.  My chops were quite thick so I figured they would take longer but when I checked them at 20 minutes of simmering, they were 170 degrees.  I need to work on not over cooking pork but aside from that, these were great.  Served with rice and California blend veggies.

Very good, moist/tender, and flavorful chops! Simple to make too! Didn't have beef stock, but had beef broth concentrate (followed instructions on the bottle to dilute). Also, used low-sodium Tamari soy sauce. It was a little salty, but likely due to the concentrated stock--didn't notice the sodium content on the bottle and should have tasted and diluted it more! With regular beef stock + low sodium soy sauce I think it would be perfect! Also, don't dump the whole sauce all over the chops like we did, just add the amount of sauce you want. Served with A Homemade San Francisco Treat by Shorecook and a garden salad. Delish dish and will make again as written!

Substituted chicken broth for beef, and cut soy sauce by half based on other reviews (while increasing broth to make up for the difference), but this was still *extremely* salty. Otherwise the flavor was great! We used thin-cut boneless chops and cooked them to temp, so our time was obviously much shorter - maybe 3-5 minutes per side and then 5 minutes of simmer time. Served it with garlic quinoa and steamed broccoli, both of which were also delicious with a drizzle of the sauce. We will definitely make this again, but will further reduce the soy-to-broth ratio to cut down on the saltiness.

I was disappointed that the pork chop was dry, and I didn't let it cook as long as the recipe called for.  And the sauce was a bit salty.  It was just average.

Because I couldn't find thick pork chops, I used this recipe for boneless chicken breasts. They were awesome. I doubled the sauce as per other reviews and served these with oven roasted vegetables (cauliflower, zucchini, carrots and onions with balsamic glaze). Everything was gone in a flash and my 6 year old was asking for bread to make barquitos, little boats on her sauce to eat.

I made this as written and it turned out delicious! I actually had to increase the cooking time to 40 min, but I had very thick porkchops (a little over an inch thick) with a decent amount of fat on them, so they still turned out very tender and flavorful. 

I made sure to use low sodium broth and the saltiness level was just right. No need to double the sauce. I served this over some cilantro-lime jasmine rice and the flavors married perfectly!  I'm saving this recipe for future meals.

Nice and easy, and tasted very good. I used chicken, because it seemed to me that it would work for chicken, chicken broth instead of beef broth, low sodium soy sauce, and I doubled the amount of sauce ingredients because we like sauce. Left out all the oil, because browning the chicken seemed to make enough. I used a huge glop of garlic paste because there is almost no such thing as too much garlic. I misread the cornstarch amount and put in way too much, but it was okay, just gloopy instead of saucy. We will definitely have this again some time, and I'll get the thickener right.

The sauce was great.  However, based on other reviews, I cut down the browning time (to 3 minutes per side) and cooking time to 20 minutes.  the chops were still tough.  They were OK, but not great.

I made this as it was written. We really liked it. I would make couple of changes. I would use Pork steak, it is more tender. I would double the sauce but on soy sauce I would add 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup water. But loved the taste. Just the right zing to it. Made brussell sprouts and riced potatoes. Great meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really delicious.  My whole family loved it.  I made extra sauce, using a 4 to 1 ratio of beef broth to soy sauce, and it was still pretty salty for us, and we like salty.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.  Thanks for the new way to cook pork chops!

The sauce is delicious but the chops are tough. I used 1" boneless loin chops and, when I lifted the lid to turn them halfway through the simmer, they were more than done. The simmer was barely a bubble but next time I'd start with 5 minutes a side and turn every 5 minutes, checking for doneness.

It had very good flavor. I only had a pork loin so I just sliced that into 1" chops. I was afraid it would be tough cooking it that long but they were very tender.

This is a great, fresh recipe for pork chops that I absolutely LOVED. I seasoned the pork with garlic powder, chipotle chili powder, and a little salt before I browned it. I omitted the extra oil in the sauce, too. I used very thick chops (a little over an inch)  and they were  still done quicker than the recipe says, so be careful not to overcook them.

I used low sodium beef broth and low sodium soy sauce and the sauce was still too salty. It tasted like a salt bomb ion your mouth. I also added a little more corn starch than what the recipe called for since it was not thickening at all after 5 minutes, and the sauce was still too runny.

The cook time on the pork is  also too long. Even after shortening the recommended cook time, the pork was very dry and tough to cut through with a steak knife. I would not place the pork back in the pan once it is browned--just pour the sauce over the top of it once the sauce is completed.

My family did not care for the recipe and I will not be making this again .

I have finally found a pork chop recipe that leaves the chops both cooked all the way through and not tough. I followed the recipe to the letter and the chops and the sauce both turned out perfectly. Will definitely be making this again, next time probably with more pepper flakes.

I see many reviews saying that it's too salty so I should note that as a matter of course I use low-sodium ingredients--both the broth and soy sauce--and didn't add any salt. I found this gives the sauce the right amount of flavor without too much salt.

We really liked the flavor of the sauce on these chops, but they were a little tough. So I didn't know if they needed to be cooked longer or if I cooked them to long. I want to try it using the crock pot next time, but with the same amount of sauce.

I did halve the soy sauce. I thought some pineapple would be good in this recipe.  I added a couple of heaping tablespoons of pineapple tidbits to the skillet with the garlic and followed the directions for the remainder of the recipe. It was yummy.

This is definitely a repeat! I doubled the sauce, but kept the soy sauce at the standard measurement because of comments about some folks' came out a bit too salty. Served it with egg noodles. Hubby noshed, as did I. Thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe mainly as is. My "mistake" was that I added the corn starch mixture too early. Anyway, it came out really nice. My only adjustment was only using one tablespoon of sugar and no pepper flakes as I can't eat spicy things. I think it is a keeper. I will try it with other cuts of pork as others suggest: bone in or so.

This was really easy! I always have all these ingredients on hand. I did add extra beef broth to get more sauce. I mixed in some soba noodles at the end because that's all I had for noodles. Would probably be better with rice.  I like spicy and this was perfect. Good with Sriracha :)

Very good.  The sauce is great.  Make sure you make the full amount of sauce because it does not make much and it is really good. You may want to double it if you make four or more chops.

With all due respect....This recipe has been around for 30plus years!!!!  

Our parents used to do this with all the spices in the cupboard...unfortunately, no body can afford meat prices anymore.

Great flavor. Next time I'll use a whole pork tenderloin, less brown sugar. I increased the red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. I'll also use egg noodles or brown rice.

My wife's been making This dish for 16 years and uses sherry in place of the beef broth and extra oil. Equal parts sherry and soy sauce and 1/2the amount of brown sugar. Red pepper flakes to your liking.

I made this with brined pork chops (6hr) as directed by another reviewer  then added some white wine to the sauce to cut the salt from the soy sauce and sweetness from the brown sugar. Also added the pepper flakes.  Rest all the same, and was wonderful, and my pork chops were thick so the brining made all the difference. Thank you all.

Love this recipe and have made it for years.  My original recipe did not give beef broth as an option and I recommend Sherry over the broth.  Also the original recipe I had, gives a range of thickness of chop up to 3/4".  If you use a thinner chop reduce the cooking time to avoid the meat turning out tough. I also make more sauce, use reduced sodium soy sauce and add more pepper flakes, as we like ours spicy.  Best on wide noodles and stemmed broccoli.

I've been making a version of this for 20+ years, instead of broth try dry sherry or white wine, nice tweak.  Definitely cut soy to half even when using low sodium soy.  At times I have also swapped cornstarch and water proportions for thicker or thinner sauce.  Nice, easy and delicious dinner!

I've made this recipe several times now. I really love the sauce.  I have not yet found the right cooking time though. The recipe calls for 30-35 minutes of simmering, but that just dried the chops out. I'm down to 1 minute on each side to sear, and 5-7 minutes simmering.

No changes except made in my slow cooker - browned chops (used center cut loin chops, sometimes bone-in and sometimes boneless),. made sauce in same pan and when combined and warm, poured over chops; cooked on low for about 6 hours - chops were so tender we didn't need knives!! Used low-sodium soy sauce and broth (that's all I ever buy) so we didn't notice saltiness. Similar receipe in Taste of Home years ago... And have made these numberous times. Family loves them.

I agree with the less time... They did turn out a little tough. But overall these turned out great!!! I don't like too much of a salty taste so I will probably use less soy sauce but they were delicious!

Doubled the sauce, otherwise didn't change a thing. Browned 2-3 minutes per side and cut back the simmering time to 25 minutes and the chops still turned out pretty dry. The family liked the flavor though, so I may try this again watching at 20 minutes total.

I made this tonight and my partner and i loved it.  I used boneless loin chops.  Next time (and there definitely will be a next time) I'll watch the cooking time more closely.  The 30-35 minutes as suggested seems awfully long. I took mine off the heat at 24 minutes and they were a tad too well done. I'll also back off on the soy sauce by 25%. 
Overall this recipe is a winner.

I made this on a whim.  My husband and son like pork chops and I prefer pork tenderloin.  I decided to give this a try and  read some of the alterations that were made to this recipe.  Like others I decided to brine my pork chops.  The pork had an amazing taste and was very mild flavored and juicy.   My husband raved over and over about this recipe and said he had not had a pork dish this good since we were at this very high end restaurant several years ago.  I doubled the sauce recipe as I served this with baked potato's and steamed green beans. This recipe was incredibly easy to make and comes together quickly.  I used a cast iron pan and it seared the pork nicely.  I will definitely make this again for my family and even company.

I came to the site looking  for a pork chop marinade so that is what I did: I marinated it.

I put the ingredients and pork chops in a bag, let them marinade overnight and then poured everything into a pan on medium heat.

If you cover the pan and cook until the marinade browns, you can then use the sauce it creates just as stated in the recipe.  Turned out great!

After reading some reviews I found and used a some added info to brine the chops. I also made a couple small adjustments to the sauce. Please note I also made 3x the amount of the recipe. Having 2 teenage boys in a family of six requires it.-----------


2 Tbs brown sugar, 2 tsp salt & 2.5 cups water  for every 4 chops. Boil one cup of water, dissolved brown sugar and salt in it, then mix 1.5 cups more water. Put chops in container, added brine and stored in fridge for about 3.5 hours.----------
I used light virgin olive oil to "brown" the chops.
After "browning" the chops (3 minutes/side high heat), I added my sauce mix to the juices/oil in the pan.----------


Many complained about the saltiness of the dish in their reviews so I used "no salt added" beef stock. I also used about 1/3 to 1/4 less Soy Sauce and maybe a little less garlic (?) - I used 2TBS pre minced garlic paste and mixed it directly into the sauce, another 2TBS of minced spice rack garlic and 2TBS minced onion. I kept the Red Pepper, olive oil, brown sugar & beef stock ratio the same. To make the sauce thicker next time I am leaving out the olive oil from the sauce mix and using just what was left from the initial browning of the chops.----------


After simmering the meat for 30-ish minutes (closer to 35), I poured all the sauce out of the pan and added it to the water and corn starch mix. I turned the pan back up to high heat, waited 5 minutes and finished browning the chops (3.5 minutes per side, adding sm

Definitely not a fan. Aside from shortening the 30-35 minute cooking time. I followed the recipe exactly. The  pork chops were very dry. The sauce was pretty runny even with the cornstarch and lacked flavor. Will not make again.

I made this recipe as written. To alleviate the too salty taste that was mentioned by other reviewers I used less sodium beef broth and soy sauce.  This  dish had a lot of flavor and was a hit in our household. Thanks for sharing.

So dry, so tough, hard to understand. I made it exactly per the recipe. I've never had this happen before with an A/R recipe.

Jeez, this was salty. I had read other reviews saying it was too salty, so I cut the soy sauce down to half. But even that wasn't enough. I'd say you'd have to cut it down to half AND use reduced sodium soy sauce to make the sauce palatable. The pork was great, but I tossed the sauce and ate it plain.

I followed the suggested adjustments by cutting back on both cook time and soy sauce. We enjoyed it. I will make this again.

This recipe is really good. The pork chops cook really fast even on low. Just watch them. They would've been really dry if I had followed the recipe to cook them for 30 minutes. My husband loved them.

Good and really easy with ingredients commonly kept on hand. Doubled the red pepper flakes and was sorry that I did.  Too spicy.

My husband and I loved this recipe!   The red pepper flakes gives it just the right amount of heat.   It is pretty salty so I may cut back on the soy sauce next time and just add more broth.  Also, I've doubled the recipe both times I've made it because we like plenty of sauce.  Plus the leftover sauce is awesome for another meal (such as hamburgers).  Great recipe!! :)

My family loved this. I did make some modifications, because I made it with the things I had on hand. I used thin boneless pork chops. Seered them in a hot pan with salt and pepper until they were golden on each side. I sautéed garlic and some sweet onion until soft in coconut oil and a small pat of butter. Then added the wet ingredients. I substituted Worcestershire sauce for the soy, because that's what I had on hand. I doubled the recipe because we have a large family so I used 3/4 cup of beef broth and 1/4 cup of the Worcestershire, because so many reviews said it was too salty. It's sweet with some heat. The pork chops were so tender and not at all dry. I'll definitely make this again.

I have made this twice now.  Both times it came out great.  The pork chops came out very tender. I simmered for 30 minutes. I used lite soy sauce because it is less salty. Fried rice  works well with this dish. I used teriyaki sauce instead of the soy sauce the second time I made this. Didn't have any soy sauce. Works just as good as the soy sauce. If you do use teriyaki sauce, omit the brown sugar. This is a keeper.

I made this for dinner tonight and it came out awesome. Instead of cornstarch, I used Wondra and it made the sauce perfect. We poured the sauce over some buttery mashed potatoes and our whole family loved it and had seconds. Thank you!

I did use low-sodium beef broth and low-sodium soy sauce as recommended by so many other cooks.  It was fabulous!  The most tender chops I have ever made - and mine were over an inch thick!  Wonderful - a keeper!

This was a great little recipe, easy cheap and very tasty.  I didn't change anything.  The meat was so tender and even the kids were asking for it again.  I put Chinese vegetables on top.  Bok choy, beans, and Chinese cabbage, boiled in a chicken garlic broth.  It was very light and very extremely delicious.  
San Francisco Pork chops in Australia ha ha.

I followed Susan Turners review and she was absolutely right. BRINE the pork first. She also doubled the brown sugar to help with the saltiness. My husband hates pork chops and was thoroughly pleased with this dish. The sauce thickened great. We served over egg noodles with green beans and brussel sprouts.

FAB!!  I pre-seasoned my chops with celery salt, tumeric and Italian seasoning. Avoiding the high salt comments, I used two tablespoons Worcestershire sauce and kept everything else the same. It took about 20 minutes of simmering for the chops to be ready. Served rice as I was out of pasta. Will double sauce the next time. Primo!

Extraordinary blend of flavors. The chops were tender and moist. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I made it I tripled the sauce recipe. Served it over a bed of rice. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I just made these tonight with thin chops (25m simmering) and they are fantastic! I'd probably suggest cutting down on browning time for thin chops too. This was soooo tasty! I love the tangy sauce.

Great dish for the potentially bland "other white meat" - read some reviews and took advice! Slow your roll on the Soy - went with 2 tblsp vs 1/4 cup! Pumped up beef broth to about 1/2 cup, completely ditched the extra 2 teaspoons of oil while going with 1/2 tsp++ of red pep flake ?? And cut corn starch in half.  If you have a lot of sauce  after simmering maybe go more corn starch.  It was perfect with some steamed broccoli and stir fry celery!  Low and slow simmer kept the chops tender.  Enjoy!!

This is all about the sauce ! I cut the soy sauce in half and doubled the Beef Broth, This is a keeper next time will double the sauce. Pork came out tender and where good on their own. I cut the cooking time also in half.  I used tenderloin chops about 1/2 inch thick

I would surely give this fantastic tasting meat dish a 5 star, except indeed too salty.  Knowing better, I should have cut the soy in half, added extra water.  But because I was doubling the recipe, I didn't.  I had 7 good sized boneless pork chops to fix.  The flavor was remarkable and delicious.  I did a different twist on the soy, using Aminos soy, low salt beef bullion and added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, 1 or more tablespoon of red wine vinegar.  I use the half brown sugar/half fructose mixture using only 1 tablespoon, even in this doubled recipe.  I shamelessly cooked the pork in real butter and seasoned the meat first.  I also added some chopped onions to the garlic saute.  My husband was ecstatic over this meal.  Fixed the Indian Rice Pilaf along side using beef broth instead of chicken.  I know next time to figure out less sodium for this amazing savory dish.

I rated this a 5 after I made the recipe for the first time in my Foods class. We had no pork chops left after my friend and I gave it to my class off 9. The class that I am in doesn't eat a lot so we were very surprised when this happened. I cant wait to make it for my family. Just love the taste.

First time making this, I used  thinner chops after reading some of the reviews. The sauce was the perfect amount. We will be making this again.

Great sauce in this recipe. My only recommendation is to pan fry chops until just done. Then prepare sauce alone and simmer about 10 minutes. Throw chops in with sauce on low for 3 minutes or just enough to reheat them before serving. I served with yams and green beans.

The overall flavor was good.  However, the saltiness was almost too much.  I will reduce the soy sauce next time and perhaps increase the broth as suggested by another cook.

I thought I might like this when I read the recipe, but when I made the recipe I liked it much more than I had imagined.  The juices from the pork chops with the sugar and soy sauce made a very rich, brown gravy/ glaze that was just perfect!  I served with buttered egg noodles and green beans. Five stars!

My husband made this today using boneless pork loin chops, and low sodium soy sauce.  It smelled fabulous when I walked in the door.  We served it over rice, and had steamed some cauliflower and broccoli for a side.  We ended up mixing it all together and agreed it would be good as a stir fry, perhaps with the addition of water chestnuts and more vegetables.  Delish!

Great flavour from a simple recipe. I didn't find it salty, despite using all the soy sauce recommended - probably because I replaced the beef broth with plain water. I think store bought broth would add a lot of salt to this recipe. Try it with water instead. It was just as good.

Very good! I agree with Susan, reduce the cooking time for thinner park chops. 
I found when making the sauce it thickened within a couple of minutes. I think 5 minutes would have been too long.
My daughter, whom is not a fan of pork chops tried it and loved it!

Quick prep, easy recipe. Used a little of pork side fat to braze with homegrown green beans. Substituted Cayenne Pepper for flakes. I agree with reviewer who commented that residue oil in pan is quite enough without additional to sauce.

This is one of my family 's favorite recipes. I use cooking sherry instead of the beef broth and double the sauce. We serve it over egg noodles. It can be very salty, so low sodium soy sauce might be a good choice if you have a problem with sodium.  I have cooked this recipe in a skillet, in the oven, and in the crock pot using a pork roast then shredding the meat

I thought the recipe was good. The only thing I did was cut back on the simmering time, seasoned with pepper & garlic salt before frying. I used minced garlic and added just a lil extra as we like garlic.  I would definitely make this again

Pork chops are not my fav but I make them from time to time because my husband loves them. However, this recipe made me a fan! Deeeeeee-lish! They are so tasty that I will be making them for our next dinner party because I want to impress our friends. This recipe is so good! No....really, really good. FYI, I used extra virgin olive oil instead of veg oil and it was perfectly fine. That was my only recipe modification.

Made this and my husband and I truly enjoyed it. Double the gravy cause we love gravy.  Would cut back on soy sauce a bit and add more beef broth and might cut back tiny bit on crushed red pepper.

This was good as outlined just be sure you check the internal temp of the meat I found the cook time to be long by 8 min.  It should be noted the sauce is thick and rich so you may want to double the recipe and thin just a tad.

Definitely will make this again.  After searing and adding the liquid ingredients, I put the pan in the oven for 8 minutes on 400. Thats all it needed to be medium on the inside. Totally moist and delicious! Dont over cook pork chops!

This was really good!  I used less soy and sugar for our liking. Doubled the recipe because we like extra sauce. Cook your pork chops depending on size and thickness. Thanks for sharing.

Yum!!  What a quick & easy meal using pantry staples!  I tossed mushrooms & sliced red peppers in to simmer with the pork chops while the pasta cooked.  I used 4 thick chops & doubled the sauce just because we like extra.  It was so tender!!  We'll be making this again!!

I used 6 pork chops instead of 4, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, 4 cloves garlic instead of 1, doubled all other ingredients, but did not use cornstarch or any other ingredients to thicken the sauce.  Increased simmering time to 50-60 minutes due to adding 2 pork chops to recipe.  Also topped steamed green beans with sauce!

Very good recipe! I cut the soy in half and doubled the broth and this still turned out very salty but not to the point of ruining the dish. I also cut the cook time in half to avoid having dry chops - I'm glad I did. I cooked them for about 5 minutes to brown and then simmered for about 15 minutes. The sauce took a bit longer to thicken as suggested in the recipe; I simply turned it to medium-low and stirred often. My husband thoroughly enjoyed this recipe - will definitely make again!

Followed the recipe to the letter - pork chops were incredibly tender - way too salty - we used low sodium beef broth because of all the reviews but next time we will use low sodium soy sauce too - will make again

After reading that everyone else's was very salty I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar and a tablespoon of honey. I did not have any corn starch so I used 3 tablespoons of flour adding it directly to the pan and whisking it. It only took about 2 minutes to thicken then I added the two tablespoons of water. Delish.

I loved it! a tad to salty though. I will play with the soy sauce and beef broth to tone the salt down. 
I will however make this again!!

I let the pork chops sit in a brine over night and used a low-sodium soy sauce. I also lessened the cooking time because our pork chops were a little thinner. My husband and three kids (ages 8, 6 and 6) loved it. I will definitely be making it again.

I used bone in thick cut chops and my favorite cooking tool, electric skillet.  I followed the recipe and only had to make an adjustment at the end to add more water to the sauce.  I also used low sodium beef broth and soy sauce.  We all liked it and will be a repeat meal in our house.

This was fine.  This was similar to adobo chicken/pork.  Somehow I lost the beef broth that I bought, so I used sherry with some worchestire sauce.  I know it isn't the same, but it did the job.

Excellent recipe! After reading the reviews I reduced the soy sauce by half and used 1 cup chicken broth in place of the beef broth. I also only put a couple shakes of red pepper flakes in since I had little ones eating it. I used 1/2" thick boneless pork cops, seared for 2 mins each side then returned to the sauce for about 10 more minutes. Served over rice with a side of green beans. It reminded me of a teriyaki sauce so next time I'll do broccoli instead. Definitely a keeper!

Hubby loved these! I used thick boneless chops, so I brined them with the Maple-Brined Pork Loin recipe.  They were salty,  but I think it was the sauce so next time I'll reduce the soy sauce.

I made this recipe with brined pork chops that were 3/4 inch thick.  They were wonderful! My husband declared this meal was a "do again".   I did nothing different except for brining the pork chops.  This really is a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I added a little minced fresh ginger at the same time as the garlic, halved the amount of soya sauce, and doubled the amount of broth. I still found the sauce rather salty, but my wife and I both liked it.

My family really loved this dish! I made my sauce without the red pepper flakes, because I didn't have them on hand, and it still turned out delicious! I cooked my Porkchops on the same temperatures with the same thickness, but ended up having to cook mine for a shorter amount of time. Overall it was wonderful and really filling when served with rice and steamed vegetables. A definite repeat!

This was an easy and well received recipe.  I have had trouble with pork chops being dry but this recipe solved the problem.  Kudos to Susan Turner who recommended brining the pork chops first - I followed her tweaks  to the letter and she was right this recipe is a keeper.  I used very thick 1 1/2 inch boneless pork chops and they were absolutely delicious.  5 minutes a side was all it took - don't overcook - it isn't necessary

I doubled on the sauce to have extra to serve over the egg noodles..the only thing I did not double up on was the oil as I don't like the oil residue it leaves..was really good and chops were Moist..Oh add more red pepper in order to even get a taste of it..I will make this again

This is such a great recipe. My husband and daughter are still talking about it. :) I made some slight changes to the sauce because of the salty reviews. I doubled the sauce portion of the recipe, so I would have more sauce for the noodles (angel hair). I used 3/4 cup reduced sodium chicken broth with a teaspoon of veg base, 1/4 cup soy sauce, and just 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. I doubled all other ingredients regularly. It was great, and not too sweet or salty! Thank you.

This was good. I didn't find the sauce to be to salty, but I used 3 packets of soy sauce (from Chinese takeout). Everything else I did exactly according to the instructions, except for cutting the cooking time, as I used 8 thin boneless chops. They didn't come out super tender, but they weren't too tough either.

This was a big hit all around the table!  For my family of six I made 8 chops and quadrupled the sauce recipe (but halved soy sauce, thanks to other reviewers).  I served it over rice with steamed veggies.  There were ZERO leftovers!  This recipe is a keeper!

Pretty delish.  Both my hubby and teenagers enjoyed it.  I did as others suggested and used low sodium soy sauce and increased the amount of garlic and red pepper flake.  I also added fresh chives on top at the end.  I only cooked the chops for 20 minutes in the second step and they were still a bit over done, despite being very thick.  Next time, I'll decrease the time a bit more.  Served it over fresh steamed rice and with green beans.  Will make again!

Even my picky teen liked it. I did cut down the salty soy sauce and add onions when sauteing the garlic. I also cut down cooking time to suit the pork chops. I will make this again. A quick  meal for a busy weeknight.

My family loved this!  Used coconut sugar in place of brown sugar and coconut aminos in place of the soy.  I forgot to add the beef boullion into the sauce but I thought the saltiness was an point so IMO it didn't need it.  Very tasty though and I served it over cauliflower rice with a side of broccoli :)

I followed Susan Turner's suggested revisions and so glad that I did! Although I didn't use bone in chops; still used 4 boneless chops. But thank you Susan! Your trial and error made for a delicious dinner tonight!

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, low sodium soy sauce, and beef bouillon.   Makes just the right amount of glaze.  I would double it if you want enough to spoon over rice or potatoes.  Liquid evaporates pretty rapidly once it's thickened, so I just added couple tablespoons of water right before serving.

On the grill! I was curious to make this on the grill so I combined all the ingredients except the cornstarch and marinated in a glass pan for 2 or 3 hrs, then grilled on medium heat. They were delicious! You won't have the sauce but I was fine with that.

I made this on the crock pot, per allrecipes suggestion, it was pretty good, pork cops were tender and flavorful but the flavor had no depth, I guess it's worth a shot but I won't be making it again, but thank you for posting, maybe if I'd have followed the cooking instructions it would have been better.

The advice of one member to sear the chops, then cook the sauce and return the chops for just a  few minutes was great. These were the most moist chops I have ever made. The sauce was yummy. Thanks for a great recipe.

I would double the sauce and add 2 more chops.  I used linguine lightly buttered and put the chops and sauce on top.  Served with a side of green and yellow beans.  Also I used unsalted beef broth

This was tasty I agree cut back on the soy sauce just a little or use low sodium soy sauce. The pork was a little dry so I will cut back the time as well

simple and easy with ingredients I already have in the house!  it was a bit too salty for my taste.  I'll be trying again with alterations to make a bit less  salty. maybe less soy sauce and more broth, not sure yet.

Some liked it, some didn't.  I think the soy sauce was a little over-powering.  Overall, not bad, but probably won't make it again without alterations.

(4.75)  I would give it a five but on the Liver to Bacon scale pork chops can never be 5.  I made it exactly as directed  except i was out of red pepper flakes. I put ground Cayenne on my son's and mine only and the girls with out. I think it was delicious. We will eat it again. Served with mash potatoes and corn.  Thanks for the recipe.

I reduced cooking time by 5 minutes and it was still a bit over cooked. Next time I will reduce time by 10 minutes. I cut the soy sauce in half and it was fantastic. Great flavor

I thought this recipe was great as is. I did not think it was too salty, but I also didn't salt the pork chops when cooking. I also used the lower sodium soy sauce and low sodium stock. My husband is not a huge fan of pork chops and said that he'd love to have this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have been making this recipe for YEARS. The only changes being cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes and I simmer for about 6 minutes each side and normally serve with buttered egg noodles. The last time I made these I happened to have just picked a pineapple from my garden so I sliced it into rings and grilled them in the pan after I seared the chops. Placed the chops back in the pan and covered with the sauce and diced the pineapple into bite-sized pieces and threw them into the sauce. Served this with brown rice. Yummy!! The pineapple was a great addition.

Delicious. I had no problems with it. The flavors combine very well. If it's too salty for your taste, just use less soy sauce. Otherwise, excellent recipe.

My family loves this recipe and cant get enough of it. I do like to substitute the soy sauce for Worcester sauce instead giving it a bit more flavor and less salt taste as well. I also will toss in some finely chopped bell peppers (green, yellow, red and orange) for some color and add flavor as well.

I brined bone in pork chops with brown sugar and salt for 3 hours. Seared in olive oil. Set aside. Whisked the brown sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, chili pepper flakes. Sautéed onions and 3 cloves of garlic for a few minutes. Added chops back to pan and added the broth mixture. Simmered for 5 minutes each side. Removed chops and covered with foil. Thickened the sauce with corn starch and served over the chops. Brine made all the difference! Very tender!

I rate this a four based on the recipe.  With a few modifications, it can be a five.  Cooking 3/4 inch chops 30-35 minutes is way too long. Cut it back to no more than 10 minutes per side.  If you are using thinner chops, reduce the cooking time even more. If saltiness is an issue, use low-sodium soy sauce and broth.

I really liked these! I only made 2 chops but I adjusted! Only cooked them for maybe 20-25 mins though. and I used vegetable broth because that's what I had on hand. Served them with brown rice and corn. Would definitely make again!

Restaurant flavor and so simple. I added a little extra beef broth and only simmered 20 minutes, really depends on thickness of chops. The extra sauce while still hot was drizzled on aurugla and plated with the chop. Served with olive oil garlic herb angel hair pasta. Really good, even if it is salty.

This recipe was an instant hit in my home! I tweaked it just a bit by adding just a pinch of extra brown sugar and red pepper. Excellent recipe and goes great with rice!

Great flavor with very little tweaking needed.  I used a thicker boneless porkchop (a little over an inch).  As other reviewers mentioned, I would maybe cook for a few minutes less next time, however the flavor was able to get in there and was fantastic.

These are delicious but the cooking time is a little long.  The chops were tough but still extremely tasty.  Every single person in my family gobbled them up, especially my 2 year old.  Love love love the sauce.  Thanks.  I'll be sure to make these again (with thicker chops!).

It was good just WAY too salty like the other reviews say. Next time I will definitely use less soy, more brown sugar, and perhaps more garlic. My husband LOVED it but he loves salty things. Make sure to not overlook the porkchops (I'd say 20 minute summer rather than 30-35). The flavor was good, just needs tweaking. Will make again.

This was excellent! I didn't use the brown sugar, though b/c I don't like sweet & meat. Also didn't usu the extra oil in the mixture, there was plenty left from from pan frying the chops. Very quick and easy as well!

I like lots of sauce, so I doubled the ingredients for the glaze.  So very yummy.  Reminds me a little of New Orleans Bourbon Chicken...

I was looking for something quick, easy and tasty and FOUND IT!  It was great.  My 5 year olds ate it, my husband liked it and the sauce was great.  I can't wait to try adding the left over sauce to stir fry.  (We're not huge saucy people so the original recipe made way more than we could eat).  At the last minute I was worried about the saltiness that many of the reviews stated, so I did add 1/2 cup of red wine.  The only other thing that was different is that I always use Braggs Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce when cooking. Otherwise I followed the directions.  As the cook notes state, I did not add additional oil to the sauce as I had enough remaining in the pan.  Try this, you won't be disappointed. This would be a great meal for guests.

I cooked this while visiting my parents.  Needed a simple recipe to use up ingredients they already had in their pantry or fridge.  The prep time took longer because I was in someone else's kitchen, but it turned out great!!!  Making this for my husband on Father's Day.

This was delicious and easy.  I ended up adding some sliced onions when I flipped them halfway, so the carmelized onions added just a little extra flavor and sweetness.  I would add less soy sauce or add the soy sauce later in the cooking because it was a bit too salty for our taste.  Definitely would make again but tweak it a bit so not as salty.
