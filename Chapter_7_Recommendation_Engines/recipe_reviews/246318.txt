This was fantastic!  The flavors played so well together.  Mine wasn't overly sweet but the cinnamon rolls I used had a very small amount of glaze on them.  Such a fun way to use up left over cinnamon rolls.  A vanilla sauce would set this over the top as a fabulous dessert.

Very good.  I used  cinnamon rolls from the “ day old” rack at the grocery store.  Since they were not iced, I added extra sugar based on some reviews and added pecans.  With the added sugar, I didn’t feel it needed a vanilla sauce or any topping.  As usual,; better the next day.

Followed every step of the recipe. It sounded delicious but was not good. I won't make this again. There were only a few recipes for banana casserole so that should have been a red flag.
