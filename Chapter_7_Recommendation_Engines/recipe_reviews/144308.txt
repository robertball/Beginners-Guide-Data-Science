This simple little twist on basic white rice is like putting whipped cream and a cherry on an ice cream sundae. It's still the same, but delightfully enhanced. To give the recipe it's proper chance, I made it exactly as written--with the exception of using olive oil for the vegetable oil-- and we were simply delighted. There will be other opportunities in the future to play with it, assuming I'd even want to. I served this with "Baked Orange Roughy with Veggies" (also from this site) and sauteed baby spinach. Perfect.

What a simple but savory way to make rice! I followed the recipe exactly, except I had no onion and subbed a shallot, and the instructions and timing are perfect--my rice wasn't sticky! The flavor is delicious as is, but this will become a base for other dishes, with endless possibilities for additions. Thank you for sharing a family treasure, Nandabear.

This is a perfect way to change up regular old rice.  I  didn/t measure the onions and used 3 smallish cloves of garlic and it was perfect!  Wonderful that it didn't stick together!  I will make this all the time!  I did add a splash of veingar to mine as I ate it.....I am just wierd like that!  Thanks Nanda!

Nanda, I'm so happy to be the very first to review your recipe! My rice loving kids gave this an immediate thumbs up. I halved the rice; basmati in this case, but kept the garlic and onion amounts the same. Also replaced the veg oil with evoo. This went great with the pepper steak I made. Thank so much darlin'!!

WOW!! This was a VERY nice way to jazz up white rice! I usually only buy brown rice but this was suggested to me so I bought white rice to try it! I followed the recipe as is and it turned out perfect! My hubs kept telling me how wonderful it smelled while I was cooking it! So glad Crazy Cat Lady "CCL" and K-dub recommened this to me because honestly I would haven't come across the dish myself! I'll be making this dish again!! :)

Very nice & simple rice dish.  I soaked some brown basmati rice, for a little health touch, then cooked as directed in the recipe, using a bit of extra chicken broth I had with the water.  Did a little fusion cooking tonight serving Brazilian rice with Cherry Chicken Lettuce Wraps and they went well together.  Thanks for the recipe, Nandabear!

Thank you, Nanda, for a great recipe! The water did not all absorb for me, put I think I need to use a better pan next time with a tighter fitting lid. I simmered for 10 more minutes than stated and it was fine. We ate this with Hawaiian Chili from this site. Thanks for the satisfying, yummy meal!

Delicious.  I've made this dish as written and with adding some vegetables, and it's just plain good.  When I add vegetables, I saute green onions, carrots, and garlic in oil.  Then add the rice (I prefer basmati or jasmine) and saute until translucent.  Then add chicken broth, bring to a boil, then let simmer until almost done.  In the last few moments, I add chopped cilantro (to taste).  Great rice!

I had to update this review. We eat this all the time.  The possibilities are endless.  I have used white rice, brown rice, basmati and jasmine.  I always use olive oil instead of vegetable (just because that is what I have in the house).  The only difference between the white and brown is the cook time.  The brown rice takes 10 minutes longer.  I always have leftovers that I use in different recipes during the week.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe!  We love it!

This was a really good variation for boring plain white rice.  I used shallots instead of onions because I already had some chopped for another recipe and they worked great.  Thanks for a great, simple recipe.

This rice a was a major hit! I did change a few things. I used instant white rice and did not use any oil so it would be even healthier. I sautéed the garlic and onions first with a little water, added the rice and followed the directions on the box for the cooking time. Then I added a little season all and a touch of Worcestershire sauce. It turned out delicious!

This is delicious. It also makes a lot. I used brown basmati rice, and it had to cook a little longer, but still good.

Loved the texture/taste. I was never good at making rice something always went wrong even trying to follow what some1 told me... and now I got it! his recipe did it for me :) I'm in amazement- so awesome!

After my success I made a little twist to it and added a can of drained corn to it-- YUMMMY! Still perfect!

(Note i added the corn on top of the rice about 5min before turning it off = at the 15min mark)

Nice nutty taste!  Used more onion, maybe 1/3 cup and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar.  Cooked with chicken broth instead of water so I didn't add any additional salt.  I will be making this again and again.

This rice came out the perfect texture. Nice and fluffy, every grain separate and it looked fabulous. I cut the rice and water in half for just the 3 of us, but left the onion/garlic the same. I used Basmati rice as I didn't have regular white on hand. I really liked this dish and will make it again. Thanks Nandabear, this is fab!
UPDATE: I made this again and doubled the onion and garlic. My DH commented on the rice and said how good it is. He isn't really a rice eater so for him to say anything is saying a whole lot. He even had seconds! For that I have to give this 5 stars.

This is one of those recipes where I think "why didn't I think of that"!  It brings a lot of flavor to plain white rice. I will make white rice this way from now on!!  It is not stated in the recipe but it is important to bring water to a boil before covering and turning down to a simmer. The leftovers will make great fried rice!!!

I have been making rice this way since I lived in Brazil in 1993.  I love it, my kids love it and my Peruvian husband loves it.  We eat it several times a month.  Sometimes I leave out the onion and use only garlic.

It's amazing what simple ingredients and an extra step can do for plain rice! This add more taste, and the rice wasn't dry at all. Worked well with the basmati rice we used. Will definitely make again and play around with it a bit.

Delicious!  So easy and quick, too!  I think I used a bit more onion - probs about 1/4 cup but I didn't think it was too overpowering.  Served with Grilled Peanut Butter chicken from this site.  Yum!

Simple fast and gives plain rice that extra kick! Made with "mama's Asian chicken" on allrecipes. Used 3 1/2 cups water to make it a little sticky.

I had about given up on making rice on the stove top and bought a rice cooker. I thought I would give it another try with this recipe. I am so glad I did, because this was really good. I thought maybe it would taste too much of onion or garlic, but it didn't. I did half the recipe and still around 2 cups of rice. Half the recipe makes about 3 servings. The only change I might make for next time is cutting the salt back some. I will definitely try this again.

I love this rice.  It came out perfectly and soft and delicious!  I love that it's such a basic recipe; I can change a couple of things if I want to, add a couple of things, but I can always use this recipe, as it is, as a basic side dish with dinner.  YUM.

This was really really good!  At first bite, I was a little skeptical, but it really grew on me!  I subbed EVOO for veggie oil per personal preference and also used green onion instead of regular (I bought them thinking they were what the recipe called for...must have read it in a review maybe?).  Served w/Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs for an outstanding meal.  THANKS for a great recipe!!

I could've sworn I already reviewed this recipe! Hate when that happens. Anyway, this is a wonderful way to add subtle flavor to plain rice. I used more onion & garlic than called for & I topped it with thinly sliced, fried garlic chips. Browning the rice in oil adds a nutty flavor that really makes all the difference. Thanks Nanda:o)

I have been preparing plain white rice(no cloves)this way for years. I use olive oil almost exclusively for this too. Have made this rice the day before planning to make stir fry, the rice is perfect. While toasting the rice, you can add a dusting of garlic powder and chili powder,chipotle or cayenne, for Spanish rice.  Have added to the water dried herbs such as thyme, basil, celery seed, and citrus flavorings of orange, lime, or lemon zest.

Very nice side dish.  My mom is from Brazil but has a heavier hand with the garlic and the onion (PLUS adding garlic and onion powders!!).  Nice change from your standard plain white rice.  I halved my recipe as we only have four and used olive oil instead of veggie oil.  Thanks!

I made half this recipe as written.  I think next time I will start by browning the rice and then add the onions and garlic.  It took my rice quite a while to begin to brown and that caused my onions to burn.  I will say that this cooking method created a wonderfully light and fluffy rice with no sticking issues.  I’ll try this one again!

This is pretty much how I make my rice.  However, I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also don't rinse my rice because that actually removes the added vitamins.  So when I add the rice to the pan, I add just a tablespoon of water to get the same effect as if I had washed the rice.  Then I add the rest of the water.

This is a great recipe to have just because it is so simple and perfect for beginners, like me, who aren't completely sure how to make rice. My only critique is that the recipe was kind of bland. I'm a big fan of rice with lots of veggies and etc. Overall, I loved the onions and it's great as a compliment to other foods, but if you're looking for something a little more interesting, than this isn't it.

Saute'ing til "starting to brown" took longer than I expected, but was very worth the wait. The cooking technique resulted in a very nice garlic-y, nutty flavored rice,  that would pair well with tons of recipes, as well as be a good base for a main-dish rice recipe, too. I used Jasmine rice and served with a rich Artichoke Chicken recipe and fresh Garlic green beans. Delicious together! Thank you, Nandabear, for a *best* recipe for white rice.

This is the only way I make rice now. The only change I make is to use chicken broth instead of water. Be sure not to take the lid off of the rice while it's cooking. let it cook 20 minutes than turn it off and let it sit for a few. Sometimes when I'm making stir fry I stir in some minced or ground ginger into this at the end. Mmmm mmmm!

I used brown rice since that was all I had, and it turned out great.  Not sticking together at all, and subtle flavor.  And the extras will be perfect to use for fried rice for tomorrow night!

Nandabear, thank you for this wonderful recipe! Who could ask for anything more out of plain white rice? My husband and I are big rice eaters and we were just talking about how this is such a perfect taste for adding in other ingredients that we like from time to time. I was desperate to make this dish tonight but I only had the 10 minute boil in bag rice in the cabinet, but no fear! I just opened the bags and reduced the simmering time and it worked perfectly! Thanks again!

Oh Nanda, this was delicious! As everyone else said, it is a good way to spice up boring old rice. We put in extra garlic as a personal preference. Very good as a side dish, or a light lunch all on its own. Mine seemed to make a lot for leftovers, so I put the rest in chicken soup the next day and it livened up boring old broth too. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Added more onion and garlic and it was still very bland. Too many other really good rice recipes around; will not try to "fix" his one.

Great taste. I swtiched mine up with Sesame seed oil and a low sodium soy sauce instead of the salt.  Even my Korean step ma loved it! Kudos.  I also did mine in my rice cooker.

Pretty good.  My rice was perfectly cooked at 20 minutes.  I accidently dumped in more onion than called for; I used dehydrated minced onion, which packs a punch, so it was quite oniony.  Oops.  However, despite that mishap, it still cooked fine.  This does make a lot of rice; I shouldve realized and halved it, but I didn't.  Oh, well, I guess we are having rice with something else this weekend.  Hah!  Thanks for the recipe!

good flavor, it only came out a little bland because i added the salt a little later than i was supposed to. i messed up the recipe since i did a lot of things wrong but because of the ingredients it didn't come out as bad as my past rice disasters, hopefully next time i will have better luck. but, most definitely good recipe.

Made this tonight, browned the rice, onions and garlic at the same time, and used half water, half chicken broth as others suggested. EXCELLENT!! Hubby likes it, I like it, the kids like it!  And the rice is loose and fluffy, not sticky like I normally make! Definite keeper, thank you for sharing!

Great! I added a can of black beans once the rice was cooked and let them heat threw before eating. I would suggest tasting before serving because mine needed a little more salt than stated.

Excellent and simple recipe. We eat rice almost every night and I am always looking for new ways to prepare it. This was a huge hit. The flavor is very mild and the rice cooks up perfectly this way. It is very similar to rice-a-roni, but not as overpoweringly flavorful.

There are already a lot of great reviews. I can only add this is great, even with brown rice. I liked it as a neutral (no meat flavor like most rice dishes,) yet flavorful side, and served it with grilled salmon. Not only is it great as written, but the leftovers work well as a base rice recipe for other things, too, such as one-skillet dishes, stir-fry, or any recipe calling for pre-cooked rice. Thanks for sharing this.

I made this recipe tonight, and the flavor was fantastic.  The only thing I did differently was that I added more than 2 Tbsp minced onion...probably about 3-1/2.  A tip for those of you using jasmine rice:  I used Thai Jasmine Rice which is the only rice we eat at home, and the proportions of rice:water were off due to the nature of jasmine rice.  The rice was very sticky and wet because 4 cups water:2 cups rice was too much water.  The next time I make it, I will reduce the water to 3 cups and report back.  Delicious flavor though...I can't wait to try it again with the slight change in water measurement.

I had fun making this and thought that it was pretty good.  I thought it had nice flavor, but some people thought it tasted pretty much like regular rice.  A bit of a waste of effort for regular rice, but I thought it was a nice change.

I used one and a half cups of rice and three cups of water but left the other ingredients the same. It was delicious! Its a million times better than the instant rice while being just as simple to make! Definately a keeper recipe :)

I took advice of other reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water.  My chicken broth was NOT low sodium, so when I added the salt, it became a little too salty for my tastes.  I will make this again as beyond my mistake it has a very good flavor.  Thank you for sharing!!

I followed the recipe exactly and did not care for the results. My boyfriend and I agreed that it didn't taste a whole lot different than just plain old white rice. To really get some good flavor into it I think you'd need to cook the rice and then add the onions/garlic, because the water dilutes it all.

This was a good white rice. I make this with chicken broth or with water and salt. Good either way. Nothing exceptional as it is just rice :P but a nice addition to any meal instead of plain rice. I still prefer jasmine rice.

This was a good basic recipe. I liked the texture of the rice a lot. I would like to add cilantro or parsley in the rice next time for a little more flavor.

I love this rice. The onion and garlic give a wonderful light flavor. The color turned out a bit off-white, probably because it was sauted brown, but who cares. This is fantastic rice and it went really good with the chicken stir fry that I threw together. I will surely make this again and again:-)

This is really good! I was getting tired of the same old rice and this is a nice change of pace. I will definately make this again, maybe I'll try to sub chicken broth for the water. Thanks for a great recipe!

The family loved it! I used less rice and found that browning the rice in a saucepan was a bit difficult. The rice itself doesn’t brown but it takes a brownish hue from the onions and garlic. It is way more tasty than plain white rice and doesn’t take that much more time.

It was a different take on rice. Fairly good but expected a little more. I think I should have let the onions and garlic cook a little longer before stirring in the rice.

Hi, I'm the submitter of this recipe.  I just wanted to say thank you to all who have tried it  and hope that you enjoy it with your loved ones.  Although I love this recipe as it was passed on to me, it is very versatile.  I play with it all the time!  Feel free to do it too.  My mom always used vegetable oil but due to personal taste I use olive  oil and  In addition, I frequently use chicken or vegetable broth, and  add more onion and garlic.  However if you prefer it to be more subtle then follow the recipe.   You can use this method with most types of rice.  It works well with brown basmati rice and I have  tried it with vegetable medley and brown medley rice too.   But beware that It will take longer to cook and may require more tweaking with the water or broth.   I always get so many comments about how nice it smells while cooking.  Please note that there is one other thing I do frequently...  I partially uncover it during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  This helps to speed up the cooking and ensures that it doesn't get sticky.

It's very nice, I Really like it. The timing was very accurate and the texture was perfect. In the future I will try play around with it and add some more flavor to it (maybe vegetables).

This was so delicious!!  I did use chicken stock instead of water, but otherwise I followed all measurements. It was a great side dish to chicken scampi.  Flavorful, but not overpowering.  Great recipe!

This was fabulous!  I used my rice cooker to saute the onions, garlic, and then the rice.  Then used maybe just a smidge less than 4 cups of chicken broth.  It turned out perfect!  This will be my new standard method for rice.

I think this recipe is pretty good...just something a little different from the norm.

Recipe so good as is. It has a great subtle flavor that makes regular white rice a little more interesting.

This was simple yet loaded with flavor. The only thing I added was some diced bell pepper because I was needing to use them up. They added a nice flavor to the rice but it would have been great without as well.

My husband is from Brazil and he says this is as close to the rice his Mom makes as he has had.  I only make my rice this way now and it pretty much goes with any dish you are serving.  If you're looking for a rice with a lot of flavor, you might want to tweak the recipe to your taste because this is just a kicked up version of plain white rice.  I always add plenty of salt to the boiling water which helps alot.  Turns out great every time I make it!

I was looking for a more flavorful side, so I did change it up a bit.  I sauteed about 1/2 chopped red bell pepper along with the onion and garlic. Then, I combined 1-1/4 water, and 1-1/4 cup milk and a packet of hidden valley ranch dressing mix, then stirred until well blended. I added this in place of the hot water... Turned out to be a creamy flavorful side dish.  I will, however saute some mushrooms with the onions, and peppers next time.

I made this rice to along with salmon last night and the end result was really good.  I used half chicken broth, half water, but that is the only change I made to the recipe.  The end result is nice, fluffy rice that does not stick together.  The flavour was very subtle - it's really a nice switch from plain white rice.

It's easy and adds a bit more flavor to otherwise plain rice. Works well under a stir fry or just as a side.

This cooking method creates a great soft fluffy light rice.  I used vegetable broth and this simple rice has good flavor.  Went well with our spicy bbq chicken breasts.

OMG!!! So... I hate rice but needed a side to go with the spinach stuffed chicken (also on this site) for my to male roommates. It was perfect! I mean even i ate a lot. Also there was just enough leftover for fried rice later this week!  The rice was soooo good. I love it and will use it for the rest of my cooking life!!!

As brazilian, I have to agree: "This is the best white rice recipe ever!". I also learned from my mom when I was 8 and have been doing it for 42 years now.  My american husband loves it! The traditional brazilian white rice only uses oil, garlic, sal, water and rice, of course. But it's ok to add a couple of your favorite spices, like onions. It is a matter of taste. Nandabear is right: For brazilians, the idea of sticky-gooey rice is simply repulsive!

A nice alternative to just plain white rice.  I used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water.  I think next time I will cut down on or eliminate the added salt if I use chicken broth again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I hate rice, it's so plain and boring and I always mess it up every time, but this was great! It was subtle enough to still work as a side, there was a little too much liquid but I took the lid off a little early to stir it and it came out fine. So much more fun than plain rice!

I wasn't sure what this would end up tasting like, but I am sure glad I gave it a try! I made it just like the recipe says to, using half chicken broth and half water. I would not mind adding more onion and garlic next time. Overall, this rice tastes delicious and is very versatile! I, like a few other reviewers, made this to go along with the baked orange roughy recipe from this site. The two must be made for each other! :)

This recipe is nice and easy. It makes a great side dish if you are looking for a plain rice dish. Their really isn't much flavor at all so it goes well with most dishes. I like to make it with a meat or entree that I know will have a yummy sauce or juices to soak up in the rice. If you are looking for a rice with a nice strong flavor don't use this recipe, it really only has a hint or very mild flavoring.

I liked the flavor but I like my rice white not yellowish. Four cups of water for 2 cups of rice was too much. My rice turned out pasty. Next time I will put 3 cups of water instead.

This was really good, and I would have never thought to cook rice this way, mostly because I don't make it that often.  Had to scale it down to 2 servings cause I was almost out of rice...  but it still turned out perfectly.  None of the flavors stood out strongly, but just gave the rice a really good savory bite.  Will make rice this way from now on.

I normally make my rice using the exact same method but without the garlic and onion.  I thought the garlic and onion would give it tons of extra flavor, but it was not enough to justify the extra prep.  Good recipe, but I will probably stick to my usual method and get some extra flavor from the main dish and other side dishes.

This was a fantastic and simple recipe to make white rice not so boring. I used extra olive oil and onion and it came out just right after 25 minutes. I'll be making this many more times.

This was good, almost like a white rice but I liked the texture better. The flavors where very subtle...next time I will add more onion and garlic.  It went well with the Kabobs I was serving it with.

I used half water/half chicken stock, the liquid never absorbed after the cooking time, so I just keep cooking and stirring until the rice was done. Tasted great. Will definetly try again. My guests loved it anyway.

This has instantly become my favourite kind of rice. The taste is deliciously subtle. I thought it was going to be a bit stronger. It's perfect for those times when I don't want anything strong (I'm picky with such things). I couldn't help but eat every last grain even though when I tried it I wasn't that terribly hungry. haha This is definitely something I will be making often.

Sorry but I was disappointed with this rice. The taste wasn't "wow" as I expected it to be considering its high rating. There is nothing wrong with it but my family could not tell the difference between this and just plain old rice. Thanks anyway.

Wow!  This rice turned out perfect!  I loved that I didn't need to add any butter or soy sauce, it had really good flavor just the way it was.  My 2 year-old loves rice but I was a little skeptic serving it to her with the garlic and onion but she ate it up!

As far as white rice goes, this is delicious. I used half water, half low-sodium chicken broth. I have never been able to make perfectly cooked rice (fluffy), and now I can!

This is a great side dish - sauteeing the rice ahead of time makes the grains not stick together so it heated up well as leftover too. Thanks!

This was good. I dont know why mine turned brown, but it might be because I burnt the garlic a little since I was trying to do two things at once and not doing a very good job at it! It still tuned out good and was delicious with the Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken from this site. I definitely will make this again and next time it will be white! I'll post another picture when I make it next!

This is absolutely fabulous! I did stir in one chopped green onion when it was done, because I love green onion in my rice and I had one. I used some of the cold leftovers to make fried rice, so yummy! Thank you Nandabear for a great recipe! If you like rice, you have to try this!

I made this rice so many times for so many people and one guy said it reminded him of the rice his family makes that are from Nicaragua. Another said it was like the rice they make in El Salvador (and Peru)!! The rice is a definite crowd pleaser!! The second time around I added DASH GARLIC& HERB BLEND since I didn´t have any onions and that was really good too! You gotta try this recipe, it is so easy and delicious!!

Made with double the onion and should have browned the rice a bit longer. Was very good with the Brazilian Chicken Coconut Sauce on this site and homemade Mango Salsa. Husband loved the combination. I will make again.

Wonderful rice! Made it as stated the first time and it's excellent. Second time around I used chicken stock in place of the water and added some chopped cilantro and parsley. Really great that way too. Thanks for a keeper recipe!

Thanks for sharing this great rice recipe. I love to tweak recipes so I used green onions for color and added extra because I love onions. I took others advice and added 1 cup of chicken broth and I also added 1 cup of diced butternut squash for color and extra fiber. As an afterthought, I threw in about a tablespoon of diced red pepper, again for color and extra flavor. A little pepper finished it off and I consider this a definite keeper. We'll have rice more often!

I was very much looking forward to making this rice concidering all the rave reviews it got. To put it lightly i was highly disappointed. I followed it exactly and it still turned out bland and dull.  Would not make again.

great way for beginners, like myself, to start learning how to make plain white rice better.  I use this as a base recipe  and experiment with it adding different sauteed veggies and spices.

Tasty recipe that I served with moqueca (Brazilian fish stew). I bumped up the onions to 1/4 + cup and increased the garlic to cloves, plus used half water and half vegetable broth. I few minor adjustments makes the dish!

This was a great way to jazz up plain old rice.  We really enjoyed it.  The flavors aren't overpowering, making it a great side to serve with almost anything.  We doubled the onion and halved the salt.  I always halve the salt with the idea that people can always add more to suit their own taste.  In this recipe however, next time I will add the full amount.  It really needs it.  Thanks for the recip!  This one's a keeper!

This rice was GREAT!! I'm not a huge rice fan, but I kept avidly eating these! I served them with spicy Indian chicken which I made, and the rice was absolutely delicious with it. My mother never knew that you could fry the rice before using water. We will definetly be making this in the future. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious with just the right amount garlic and onion. I appreciated the mellow flavor of this rice to go along with several Brazilian dishes, including a Feijoada, that are already packed with lots of flavor. Out of habit, the method I used to cook the rice was a little different and used a little less water (sautéed onion and garlic, sautéed rice for a few minutes, add in water, salt, and cover with tight fitted lid for the same time as directed in recipe). I will definitely make this recipe again!

This recipe is okay if all you've ever eaten was plain white rice.  I agree w/ some others...it was just a bit on the bland side.  I even used chicken broth to cook it in.

 I am used to my mother's Mexican rice and the Brazilian Rice just doesn't have that same "wow" factor and taste like my mom's.

Great turn on plain old rice. I didn't have onion but had a giant clove of garlic. Use sesame oil as a twist to add even more nuttiness to toasting the rice first. I did put some soy on mine after it was done. Very yummy day before payday meal. I may add fresh peas next time too. Versatile.

This is the best basic recipe for white rice, with a tiny ehancement. Texture is fluffy, moist but not sticky every single time. Instead of salt and plain boiled water, I leave out the salt and dissolve two chicken bouillon cubes in the four cups of boiling water required. That pumps up the flavor a lot!

It took me a while to decide on what to rate this dish. Made exactly as written, and we found it a bit bland. But it is what it says it is... White rice. This is a basic white rice dish in terms to flavours. What's special about this dish is the cooking method. It was so fragrant cooking the rice in the oil, onion and garlic mixture. My rice came out perfectly cooked in 20 minutes covered on a low simmer. And for that reason it was good. It was a good basic white rice.. Which cooked up better then good. I probably won't use this rice dish as a side again but it  would be great served under a flavourful stirfry or curry. What I will take from this recipe though is the method of cooking.. I'm looking forward to using that again. 
Thanks!

Good basic recipe but found it too bland when I followed it exactly. I'm going to try adding some canned pineapple chunks to the leftovers tomorrow for a different twist. If I made it again I'd double the minced onion, adding maybe 1/8 tsp ground black pepper, and also 1 tbsp either dry or finely chopped fresh parsley.

I t was simple and had a great taste. I did add a little chicken seasoning powder to add a little more taste due to some ratings and I don't regret it at all, i suggest other to do it if you don't like your rice bland.

Browned white rice in EEVO on medium heat. Doubled onion and garlic measurements and added 2 small cans of sliced mushrooms. Also added 5 chicken bouillon cubes instead of the salt. Cooked as directed. Family is eating now while I take a break from standing over the stove.  It is very quiet over there-all I hear is forks tapping plates. A definite thumbs up for this recipe! Dinner is Brazilian White Rice, garden salad (Romaine lettuce, with thinly sliced veggies; cucumbers, onion, carrots, green pepper, radishes, and celery) and baked chicken (legs, thighs, wings) with garlic salt and pepper until crispy-385 degrees, 45 minutes each side ending with skin side up. I have just finished eating dinner. What is great about this side dish recipe is that the flavor is delicate and compliments any dish without competing with it. Perfect dinner!

Plain white rice has become a rarity in my kitchen since marrying my dear Latin Lady.  The above is a nice departure but don't stop there!  The variations on the theme are fun and delicious by simply adding a teaspoon of 'Better Than Bullion' chicken, or beef, or mushroom base or a combo of those, some sliced mushrooms, or a few sliced green olives, or culantro, or Recaito or Sofrito or Sriracha or.... Fun and Tasty! (Don't forget coconut milk!)

I discovered this procedure many many years ago on a long-lost pilaf recipe, and have been using it ever since... sometimes I add broken up spaghetti. parsley flakes & low-sodium chicken broth & it is VERY much like Rice-a-Roni!

I am from The Bahamas and I tried this dish today. It was delicious. It is easy and simple, but has a flavor. I added some thyme and a little curry powder to it, just for a little more flavor. It was excellent!!

Great recipe. When both my 4 year old and 2 year old will eat rice and say "Yummy", it has to be a winner. Hubby really liked it too.

This is a great way to add flavor to rice to make it a stand-alone dish.  I know I will make this many times over.

Easy and tasty. I am steering clear of garlic right now (can't stand the "after" smell), so I just added some garlic powder and it was still great. I'm sure real garlic would be even more authentic.

This didn't rock my world. I never make white rice as a side or otherwise. I suppose if I was used to just plain white rice, this might have been an improvement. :-(

A great accompaniment for any dish! I sauteed the onions, garlic and rice together in a pot. Then I transferred the contents to a rice cooker and added half chicken broth and half water. It cooked up beautifully. I served it with the Cuban black beans and Brazilian Chicken recipes from this site. It was a hit. Thanks!

I've had this rice before so i knew what i was going to expect, even though the way i did it didn't quite turn out..BUT i know what i will do better next time... i actually made mine in the rice cooker.. i was making a big batch of rice ( 8 cups) and remembered this recipe.. but don't ever try to do this in a pan w/ 8 cups of rice...too much!!  i didn't even measure the garlic at this point, and only had half an onion... i dumped a LOT of garlic in and all the onion chopped....  and i measured the water up to the 8 cup line on my rice cooker... and it turned out just fine..the only thing that it needed was a little extra salt since i didn't put enough...   great recipe.... but for winging it the way i did, i'm proud of myself..hehe    definitely.. don't skimp on garlic,  more is better!!  and if you don't brown it enough, you won't get enough flavor out of that garlic.... i took it off the heat just as it started to brown so it wouldn't burn and get bitter...  thanks for sharing..

This rice was delisous and also very easy to make. Other times I tryed it, I did not have garlic, so i used bell peper instead, and it worked great. I recomend this rice to anyone anywhere.

Excellent recipe.  To make it quicker I used the 5 minute "Boil-a-bag of Rice."  Substituted olive for vegetable oil and added a tablespoon of soy sauce.  I could have done with out the salmon I cooked and just ate this.  Excellent choice if you want to doctor up white rice.

I have made this recipe several times and I love it! It's so flavorful and I always get compliments on this rice. My only variation to the recipe is rather than mince the garlic and onions, I do a really fine chop. Its so easy to burn minced garlic!

This was good and I would make it again but it wasn't as flavorful as I expected.  I added 4 cloves and 1 1/2 onions instead to make more flavorful.  And since this is white rice it won't "brown" as the recipe says so I would saute for at least 5-7 minutes.  If you do it any longer the garlic will burn.

Yummy! This is a wonderful change from plain rice. I do use brown rice though, but that was the only change I made to this recipe. Very fragrant while cooking. It made a great side for Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs (recipe also on this site) and I may try half chicken broth next time suggested in the intro for even more flavour. Thanks for sharing!

I make this pretty much exactly as is, but I don't add any salt. I make 4 portions, and my husband and I eat it ALL. It is my favourite new side dish. I use a heaping teaspoon of chicken flavour Better than Bouillion stock paste mixed into the hot water. Tonight's version smells like the best yet! It is nicely golden brown and delicious!

I would try a little adobo for the seasoning in this recipe.  I would also change the time to check on the rice after 25 minutes and stir, then let sit on the heat for another 10 minutes.  Overall though, very good.

For a simple white rice side dish, this was better than just cooking it in plain water. I used chicken broth instead of water like other reviewers mentioned. I also used dried garlic and onion powder since I didn't have the real thing on hand. Either way it came out perfect!

I am not sure how this white rice can taste like so much more than white rice,  but then also taste exactly like white rice. I don't even usually like white rice!  I love this white rice:)

LOVED IT!!! I cut the recipe in 1/2 because I was only feeding two of us and a toddler, and It was perfect. I did however keep the onion and garlic amount the same (even though I halved the recipe), and I cooked it in chicken broth. This is a definate keeper! Thanks for posting :)

Good and meh. Can this possibly be both at the same time??!!!?!? Made a half batch to serve with Susan Adair's chicken cacciatore (topped rice with "cacciatore" mixture). I don't really understand the rinsing step (maybe it is to remove excess starch to keep the rice grains from sticking together???).... I think I could have omitted this steop alltogether. My only changes were to use 2 T onion and 2 garlic cloves as if I were preparing 8 servings and sub 1 1/4 c. chicken broth (all I had on hand) and enough water to equal 2 c. liquid. My rice was ready in 22-23 minutes. Perfect! I still don't know what all the raves are for, but thanks for sharing anyways :)

wonderful alternate to "plain" white rice! I even used brown rice since I had it and it turned out great! It was even good leftover.

This is an excellent rice recipe!  Don't forget to add a full teaspoon of salt as that is the magic that makes this dish.  I found that 4 cups of water is a bit too much since I like my rice firm and fluffy, not sticky so I reduced my amount to 3 1/2 cups.  I used Basmati rice and it was flavorful and perfect!  You won't be disappointed with this one.

This was excellent! We made it exactly as written and thought it had a wonderful flavor. We'll definitely make it again.  We had it with the baked orange roughy with veggies (also on allrecipes) and the two were terrific together.

This rice reminds the way my Mom makes her rice. The onions and garlic give a good flavor. Here are my changes: basmati rice instead of white and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

I made this with ropa vieja.I saw the suggestion too late about adding half chicken broth and half water and wish I had done that. It seemed to be fairly bland for my tastebuds. Overall it complemented the ropa vieja well because the taste was not too over-powering.

This was a good twist on the typical white rice.  Hubby and I both really liked it.  I followed the directions for the most part.  The only change I made was to use dried minced onion and I added that with the salt and rice.  It was very moist and had a good flavor.  I will probably make this again.

After all the hype, this was just rice for me. I wonder if using chicken broth would make a huge difference. I did up to the frying pan step and then place everything in my rice cooker so the texture was great. I also used the rice cooker measurements for rice and water. I added extra garlic and onion. I like the confetti rice recipe better but for a plainer rice - this was ok.

What a fantastic and simple, yet very tasty dish...such a boost in flavour for plain white rice!  I cut the recipe in half and subbed evoo for the veg oil, used green onions as they were in my fridge.  This went perfectly with Baked Orange Roughy with Veggies (from this site) and some steamed carrots.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is excellent rice. I always "fry" my rice like this except instead of onion and garlic I usually use vermicelli then add the rice. This is a nice change. I've made this a few times and I add 1/2 a small onion and 4 cloves of garlic.

I really wanted to give this 5 stars, but for my taste, it needed more garlic and onion, and I didn't quite put in all the salt it called for (thinking it would be ok) but it needed the whole amount. I will try again, but adjusting to my tastes. Good recipe though.

Thank you for sharing your excellent recipe! This made perfect rice. I followed the recipe as stated and did not make any changes other than cutting the recipe in half for my first "trial run".  I am very pleased with the outcome of this recipe!  I will be making this often!!!

We very much enjoyed this recipe! It's a great change from plain white rice, and not really any more difficult! This is definitely in the regular rotation.

This was so yummy and fluffy.  I followed the recipe as is except my Tablespoons of onions were heaping and not level.  I did the alternate method of half chicken broth and half water. It was really good.

Very tasty side dish.  I will be using this for my rice recipe from now on because I think it lends itself to variations without affecting the base flavor.

I was rather disappointed with this recipe.  I love garlic so I doubled the garlic expecting it to be very garlicy and it was rather bland still.  Although if you do add a little extra salt and pepper it does help some.

Very good recipe. I used chopped onion and pre-packaged minced garlic and chicken stock to ease my prep. Family loved it.

Amazing rice! I am so pleased with how this turned out. I used all chicken broth instead of a combo with water. The flavor was incredible! My boyfriend liked it so much that he wants me to make it again tonight.

Easy and tasty way to add some zip to rice.  I substituted 2 cups of water with chicken broth and it turned out fine.  My finicky son also liked this.  Definitely making this again.

I did not have any luck with this rice.  The water did not all disolve, and I ended up having to drain some out and even after 25 minutes it wasn't completely done.  It smelled delicious and from the reviews I was expecting to be blown away.  What a disappointment!  Not sure what happened with this one....but instead of a good rice side dish I ended up with a mushy mess.  Sorry!

I really love this recipe. It's easy, fast and the whole family likes it. I have omitted the onions when none are on hand and used onion and or garlic powder. Thanks.
