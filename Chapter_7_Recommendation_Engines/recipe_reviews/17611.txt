I don't know what happened when I made these, but they were a huge mess.  First, the texture was more like a crepe than a pancake.  Second, they didn't cook all the way through.  I tried lowering the temperature and making them smaller, but neither helped.  I ended up throwing out the batter and making scrambled eggs.

These Pancakes were great everyone in my family loved them.  I thought they were delicious.  They were very easy to make.  I did not think that they were that thick.  I thought maybe a little thin.  Everyone else seems to think they are to thick.  I realy don't understand that.  They were great.  I will DEFINITELY make them again.

I too found the original batter a little too thick so I added an extra splash of milk. Otherwise - very tasty, especially the nutmeg and cinnamon. I used all low-fat or no-fat products (skim milk, low fat yogurt, Omega low-fat/cholesterol eggs, canola oil) and they still turned out very well.

These came out great, useing some of the suggestions from others reviewers.  I doubled the Baking Powder, doubled the cinnamon (I love cinnamon) and I cut back on the oil, useing only 1 tablespoon.  I also didn't have plain yogurt so I used sour cream.  They came out tall and fluffy.

After reading the revews I decided to try these as my first attempt at American style pancakes.  I made them as per the recipe (apart from olive oil instead of vegetable) and they were spot on.  I'm not a brilliant cook but they turned out really good.  They were a most appreciated breakfast in bed for my girlfriend.  I'll definately be cooking them again.

Wonderful pancakes!  I happened to have extra yogurt and a ton of fresh, large blueberries on hand, so I thought I'd give these a try.  So glad I did!  The only thing I changed was to add a bit more milk.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Since I didn't have any blueberries, I substituted 1/2 Cherry yogurt and left out the spices. They came out really good and are best with a fruit/cream cheese compote. They puff up and flatten out. I think this is a fantastic recipe that allows for LOTS of customization.

These were good, but not the best blueberry pancakes I've ever had.  My husband ate them, but I dont think he likes the "tart-ness" of blueberries.  My 14 month old also didn't like actually eating the blueberries, he ate the pancake around the berries.  However, I did enjoy making my own batter, I felt like it was much more nutritious than stuff out of a box, and really not that much harder.  If you're a blueberry fan, you will enjoy these.

Very easy to make. Nice consistency...unlike some other pancake recipes, the batter did not thin out and slide all over the griddle. Maybe needed a little more sugar...not quite sweet enough for our taste!

These are DEEELISH!  I make them just as the recipe states and they come out perfect everytime.  I serve them with just a little maple syrup.  My boyfriend's eyes light up every time I tell him I am making them.  YUM!

These pancakes turned out very good.  I was a little leary of using yogurt, it sometimes ruins recipes; however, these were moist, fluffy and flavorful.  I used the tip to add some extra cinnamon.  That added nice flavor.  I made them for Mother's day and mom (and the rest of the family!) was very pleased. Thanks!

This recipe was good and the taste was light, not too sweete, not too bland. I added a bit more of cinnamon since my husband loves it. Otherwise great for a light breakfast.

I added another teaspoon of baking powder to make them lighter and fluffier and used Dannon LeCreme vanilla yogurt instead of plain yogurt. They were a little on the bland side even with the nutmeg and cinnamon, but otherwise, good. My kids loved them.

These were good.  They had the consistency of thick crepes (after cooking) as opposed to your typical fluffy pancakes.  But nonetheless, very good.  I did not think the batter was too thick.  I used thawed, frozen blueberries and will add some orange zest next time.

These were good but the consistancy was much thicker than I am used to. I may try adding a little more milk to thin next time.

This recipe is awesome...with a couple of tweaks. Like previous reviews, I only used 1Tbsp of oil and doubled to 2teaspoons of baking powder. The yogurt made the pancakes creamy and not dry at all. I seperated he yolk and egg whites. I poured the yolk in with the liquids and beat the egg whites till stiff. I folded the whites in last. I, however did not fold the blueberries in the mix because they would all settle to the bottom and distribution would not be even.

These pancakes are awful!  I did everything the recipe said to and they turned out like sweetened sponges!  We had nine people eating this rubbery garbage and no one could finish.  I am never making these again.

Absolutely delicious, easy and quick. The best thing is that blueberries aren't necessary if you don't like them. You can use e.g. raspberries instead or no fruit at all.
Our favourite breakfast.

These were great, and loved by the kids. I used half whole wheat, and diced strawberries (what I had on hand), and I followed another reviewers suggestion and increased baking powder by 1/2 tsp. 
The batter is thick, but they cook fine. You can spread the batter a little with a spoon, and press down gently with the spatula when you flip them if you are concerned about them cooking thru.

I am always looking for ways to make pancakes sweet so I can leave the syrup in the fridge and make them handy for little ones and this recipe is a complete WIN!  I used vanilla yogurt and they were a huge hit.

Did not like this recipe.  It turned out doughy and tasteless.  I think maybe it needs some baking soda.  I like the fact that there's yogurt in it but maybe that's what made it doughy.  Might be worth trying to improve it.

I think these would have done very well as regular pancakes, but I didn't feel like the cinnomin and nutmeg went well with the blueberries.  I think next time I am going to try them with vanilla instead.  Also I can see the debate about too thick verses too thin - I found these way too thick at first, so I turned the grill down and cooked them longer at a lower heat, and they turned out ok - only a little crispy on the outside and only a little gooey on the inside.  So for the next round I added just a tablespoon of milk to the remaining batter to thin them out, and they became EXTREMELY thin (my own fault, a little milk goes a long ways, apparently).  But overall, I would say these are ok pancakes, but in the future I think I am going to try something else.

Blueberry Pancakes' Haiku: "Meh, these were okay. The reviews are so scattered! Doubt I'd make again." I was really surprised by how erratic the reviews were for this recipe, and couldn't quite pinpoint an oft'used alteration or addition that stood out as something to improve it, so I simply followed the recipe as written (as I feel that most should do w/ AR), but wow, were we ever disappointed in the breakfast results. The pancakes, as many said, tended to burn, yet remain squishy in the middle. To ensure that they were cooked thru resulted in an overly-crisp exterior, w/ molten blueberries exploding inside. I think I'd rather make the "Fluffy Pancakes" from here and add a handful of blueberries next time.

my current fave for blueberry pancakes atm. I also used sour cream as I had no yogurt.  I didnt think they were too thick. I like the flavors lended by cinnamon and nutmeg

Very good pancakes.  I substituted buttermilk for the milk and yogurt (because I didn't have yogurt, but had leftover buttermilk).  The only thing I would change is to add more spice next time--they were slightly bland to my taste.  Overall, a winner, though. I also used fresh blueberries.  I didn't even need syrup, because of the blueberries.

This is the best low sodium pancake recipe I have tried.  I did use white wheat flour and lemon yogurt.  Yummy!

Great Blueberry taste. Very moist almost like a Crepe just the way I like my pancakes. I followed recipe as is only difference I made was using vinilla yogurt instead of plain. Will make these again for sunday brunch! Thanks for the recipe.

this is the first time i make 1.pancakes from scratch and 2.blueberry pancakes and they came out delicious! I used Vanilla Yogurt because I thought it would lend more flavor and i prob used a little more Nutmeg & Cinnamon than specified because I was afraid of the No flavor some reported, and it turned out to be a good call. It took me 2 test pancakes before I got the griddle at the right temp, but once I got it they came out golden brown and fluffy. With any pancake batter I usually manipulate the griddle so that the batter spreads out a little and doesn't just clump up together. I dont know if thats what youre supposed to do but I always do it and I don't mind slightly mis-shapen pancakes for the sake of them coming out perfectly cooked. Definitly A Must Try! Oh and I used fresh blueberries, they were on sale at the supermarket :)

I wouldn't call these fluffy but I would call them delicious! Gooey, dense, great, organic blueberries and I added choc chips-couldn't help myself.

Delicious recipe! Original batter was on the thick side, but I prefer that since it's easier to thin than thicken. Didn't have plain yogurt, so I used vanilla low fat yogurt. I also substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of all purpose, used skim milk and 2 packets of Splenda for the sugar. Pancakes came out fluffy and light. Next time I think I'll increase the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp and beat the blue berries more so some of them break in the batter for more flavor.

This recipe is fantastic! I didn't have any of the issues of the other reviewers. The pancakes were light, fluffy and tasty! I used a vanilla yogurt and omitted the sugar and just placed the blueberries on the pancake batter as it cooked instead of folding in the batter. My kids devoured them! I would even make this as a batter without the blueberries for a little change from the standard pancake.

I personally enjoyed these...daughters and husband not so much. They thought it was too cinnamon tasting. Used Dannon Light & Fit yogurt & skim milk and could tell a difference in texture and taste. Seemed much healthier, which was why I liked it, but possibly why the rest of my family didn't.

Made it with a tablespoon of shortening instead of two of veggie oil and doubled the milk. Used Greek plain yogurt instead and allspice instead of nutmeg. Came out wonderful and fluffy!!!

These are good! I'll never use a boxed mix again. I  did not have any yogurt, so used sour cream. I also doubled the cinnamon. They had a good texture. I do think it needs something, but can't put my finger on it...maybe a pinch of salt?

I'm in the same boat with Navy_Mommy. The batter just simply wouldn't cook all the way through and it left me with a pancake that has an entirely to gooey center.

Elements of this recipe aren't a complete loss though. If you omit the yogurt as well as the blueberries and increase the nutmeg and cinnamon to between 1/4 and 1/2 tsp it's actually pretty  good.

I doubled this recipe and used whole wheat white flour and used only one whole tablespoon of baking powder for a double batch. I used "soured" milk as well. I made sure to wisk together my dry ingredients and my wet ingredients seperately, then folded the dry into the wet. These were pretty good. Next time, I'll add even more blueberries and maybe a bit of vanilla.

Pancakes did not cook well, were very dark before time to turn over, appeared uncooked even after much cooking.  I wonder if adding yogurt was a good idea.

These were great.  I did make a few changes.  I omitted the nutmeg and cinnamon.  Instead of plain yoguyr, I used vanilla Activia Light.  I replaced all but a a couple teaspoons of the oil with applesauce.  I also doubled the baking powder.  I used frozen strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries - just threw them in the microwave to thaw them out a bit.  Even my 12-year-old who doesn't like fruit liked these!

Delicious recipe! I substituted buttermilk instead of milk and I sweetened my frozed blueberries with a tablespoon of sugar while they thawed. For those with complaints about the pancakes not cooking well, it might be because the blueberries are not fully thawed or because more batter is used than required. Remember the recipe calls for only two tablespoons of batter per pancake so I would suggest to spread that amount as much as you can on the griddle.

Yummy. I used 1/2 ww and 1/2 ap flours; pumpkin pie spice; added extra sugar to offset ww flour, and a bit of maple syrup right into the batter. Good result but a bit dense.

I left out the nutmeg and cinnamon just for personal preference. It was very bland without it.  I also hid a little flax in it.  I think next time I will add some salt.  I really like the texture though.

I'd say this is a great recipe - my only problem was they seem to burn rather quickly, so I had to watch closely.  Otherwise they tasted excellent!  I dropped about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake and got 8 four-inch pancakes per batch.  And lazy me, I used the "one-bowl" technique and just mixed everything together in one bowl - worked fine!  Since I freeze pancakes, (quick, microwavable and a favorite meal of my 2 year old) I used this recipe as a base for two other flavors: omitted nutmeg and added 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips; and omitted nutmeg & doubled the cinnamon and added one grated apple.   Can't pick a favorite!  And I also can't wait to get my hands on some fresh Maine blueberries next summer!  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

This blueberry pancake recipe is the best recipe I have ever tasted! Love the yogurt ingredient!I like the berries folded in, I tried the tip by Chef John on placing the berries in the pancake after the pancakes are on the griddle but I thought the berries got too hot so I folded like this recipe suggests.

First of all, i used extra frozen blueberries because thats what I had. Next I ground up rolled oats super fine and used them in place of the white flour. I also used Stevia instead of sugar and Banana Flaxseed oil instead of olive oil. I also used plain Greek Yogurt and extra coconut milk, but you probably dont need to use coconut milk. I just like it better. I didnt say a word and just gave them to My husband to eat and he immediately said, WOW! These are wicked good! And he never says wicked. I always do! Cooking is always worth it when you get that kind of reaction. I will make these again!

This is a favorite recipe that I use all the time. I, however, modified it a bit. I use nonfat greek yogurt and use about 1/4 to 1/2 cup more milk. Very yummy and fluffy pancakes. Also, if cooked on an electric griddle, 275 to 300 degrees works great.

The batter was really thick, my first pancake couldn't cook through. Now the cooking time could have been thrown off by the juices released from the blueberries, but the center of the first pancake was just raw batter. Adding a splash of milk to the batter afterwards made all the pancakes cook perfectly, but I felt like it needed an added dash of sweetness. I'm not accustomed to adding syrup, but these pancakes definitely needed it.

Great recipe! My mother loved them! I left out the vegetable oil and used an extra 1/8 cup milk. Also used frozen blueberries. Quick & easy, but they taste extra special. Will definitley add this to my recipe box! Thanks!

These were excellent!  I am a veteran pancake maker and my family loved these.  I tweaked it just a little. I 4X the recipe and put in 1/2 tsp salt and a tsp of vanilla.  I left out the nutmeg as I don't care for it and added extra cinnamon.  I put in 1/3 cup sugar to my 4X version.  I didn't mix in the blue berries, I dropped them on top as I was cooking them.  The yogurt makes them extra moist and they had excellent flavor and texture.  I'd encourage you to try them.  I did add more milk than the recipe suggested, they were to thick to cook nicely. I'll be making these again soon.  Thanks for sharing it!

An excellent recipe enjoyed by each of us. Frozen blueberries were taken from freezer and rinsed with filtered water. Homemade yogurt was used (slightly sweetened with honey) & skim milk.  Just right!

I followed this recipe to the T and it was so thick I would have had to spread it out on the griddle...so I added more milk and it still wasn't good. Didn't brown well and tasted very bland...I won't do this again.

I really didn't care for this recipie.  They tasted doughy and were very dense and didn't have much flavor, i even added some more spices and vanilla, with not much flavor increase.  Luckily I put a ton of berries in, but I think otherwise they would have been quite bad.

These are good, but thick, which is okay. I used frozen blueberries which caused the pancakes not to cook through properly. I didn't use yogurt because I didn't have any. Had to add 1/4 c more milk. Used 1/2 the amount of sugar which was probably a mistake. I also used Allspice because I have no Nutmeg, and Olive oil instead of vegetable. I would add a bit of salt next time. The flavor wasn't as good as it probably should have been because of the way I altered the recipe. But I am giving it 5 stars because it was still good and my fault for the flavor difference because I didn't follow the recipe. I think smashing some of the blueberries might be a good idea, as someone else said, and using fresh or thawed, not frozen berries. I will try it again the proper way and I am sure they will be great.

I thought maybe there were a bit of salt needed. And also baking powder was a bit too much.  But still it is good and easy to make.

This is my very first time reviewing after years of using AR, I seriously LOVE these pancakes! I tend to have plain yogurt in the fridge that I need to use before it goes bad and these are perfect! Excellent consistency, and I love the flavor. I've made it as-is and it's wonderful, but I now add vanilla extract, I use whole wheat flour, and add flax meal. I do add extra milk to get the right texture but a solid recipe as written or tweaked. I make double batches now and freeze the extras.

I love this pancake recipe!  I think you can make so many variations with these pancakes by switching the blueberries out for other fruits or add ins. I did adjust this recipe by using half whole wheat and half white flour. I also doubled the cinnamon and used 5 teaspoons of baking powder to make them more fluffy. I will defiantly be making these again! Thanks Sal for this healthy and delicious gem of a recipe!

Excellent recipe. I omitted yogurt (didn't have any on hand). I also used 1full tsp of baking soda and 1/4 tsp of baking powder to give it a good rise. Like will use this as my go to recipe on Sundays. Thanks!!!

Very tasty pancakes.  A little bit thicker batter so I added a tad more milk.  Yummy.

I made it with all the measurements the original recipe specifies, except that I added a little more baking powder. The only problems I had were with the size of the blueberries. My fault of course, but the only blueberries I had were really big ones that made the pancakes really thick and difficult to get cooked all the way through. I might have used a mite too many as some of the pancakes were more blueberry than panckake. I made it through though, and they tasted great at the end, the yogurt made the pancakes delicious and doughy!

This recipe for pancakes is simply delicious!!  I never have used yogurt or oil in a pancake recipe before so that was interesting.  These came out perfect and the taste with all the flavors, and spices was awesome!

I found the batter in need of thinning - but the pancakes were great. They cooked perfectly - nice rise and juicy hot blueberries. 

I used soy milk instead of milk and greek style plain yogurt.

Made these for my family and they were very sweet & yummy.  I love blueberry, but my family does not share my enthusiasm. So I separated some batter without the berries for them. They really enjoyed the sweet, crepe flavor. I will make them again.

Delicious with a little butter and syrup!  They were a little dense, but that's probably b/c I'm used to Aunt Jemima's, haha.  I also used greek yogurt, so maybe that's why?  Overall, very yummy with the fresh blueberries!  My changes per other reviewers:  I added a little more baking powder, a little more cinnamon, plain greek yogurt, and a little less oil.  Blueberries were a great touch.  Might try adding vanilla extract next time!

First, the batter is too thick. I added milk but it was still too thick, it wouldn't even pour into the pan. Then the flavor is somewhat bland. It needs more sugar. I think it would be better with bananas. I won't try it again.

I use bisquick, it makes the process much easier. In addition, I use blueberry sugar free syrup. I heat in a small bowl with additional blueberries in the microwave and pour it on top.  Lots of great blueberry flavor.

These were quite good.  I used vanilla fat free yogurt, fat free milk and fresh blueberries.  I made the 4 serving size (original recipe size) of this and it only fed two hungry adults (about 5 good size pancakes).

These pancakes were awesome!  My son (who likes nothing) couldn't get enough! The BEST blueberry pancakes ever.  I made them with fresh blueberries and made a topping with strawberries, butter and brown sugar.  Delicious!  Thank you!

I Just made this and the boys are in the den with smiles after eating it with maple sausage.  (boys being my hubby and an out of town guest)  I used fresh blueberries and the batter was thick but once I started cooking it i figured it was to keep all those berries in place. I added a Tablesp. more sugar and i always add vanilla to my pancake batter, even the store bought mixes.  There was not any bubbles that popped or anything to let me know when to flip em.  the one time the i tried waiting on them one side of the cakes got a little darker than i would have liked.  Only two suggestions i have, 1--maybe you shouldnt wait for bubbles and 2--i intend to use an icecream scoop to spoon the batter next time.  hope this helps :)

The batter is way too thick.  I had to keep adding more milk.  When I cooked them, no matter how long or at what temperature, they wouldn't get done inside.  They turned out raw inside.  I was so embarrassed when I served these to company.  I'm sure they thought I wasn't a very good cook.  I would NOT recommend these at all.

My husband gives the pancakes 5 stars.  They were easy to make and beautiful.    Actual batter was pretty mellow. Flavor depended heavily on quality of blueberries and spices. Blueberries are in season!  We really liked these cakes.

OK...I am done with looking for the perfect pancake recipe...because this is IT!!!! Wonderful!!! Those that posted a while back about them being a big mess...probably did not check the date on the baking powder as that makes all the difference. Use good fresh baking powder! I made a few changes to my taste. Used buttermilk instead of reg milk, (had to add extra to thin a little) Used Yummy Banana flavor yogurt (not plain) 1/4 t. vanilla, used melted butter (no oil) & and a dash salt. SO SO GOOD!! I think that many flavors of yogurt would work great too lemon, strawberry banana, vanilla etc.....

I didn't have yogurt so I subsituted for sour cream.  We like our pancakes on the thinner side so I added more milk and about a T more of oil.  Also added salt.  With my changes I'd give this recipe 5 stars.

I make pancakes for my family at least once a week.  I tried this recipe to change up what I normally fix and they were perhaps  the BEST pancakes we've ever eaten.  My husband loved them so much he took the leftovers to work the next morning so he could brag to his co-workers.  This is definitely a keeper for our family!

Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of pancakes and I made these at 5:30 am (I'm not a fan of doing that either!) for my boyfriend's birthday this morning.  He is a fan of pancakes and he liked them.  Didn't eat all of them (had 2 leftover, as I really didn't help him eat them--wasn't very hungry!) but he said they were good.  I didn't have plain yogurt and did not want to sub strawberry, so I used sour cream instead.  I also didn't have blueberries and used dried cranberries.  I, too, did not bother separating and just dumped all ingredients in together.  Worked fine.  Thanks!

I have come across this recipe before, from a healthy eating website about 3 years ago, and I have to say, it is the BEST pancake recipe I have ever used! We sometimes mix in about a teaspoon blueberry jam if we have it in the house, and tend to have to add about an extra 2 tablespoons of milk to thin them out most times. I also always sift the flour, don't know if it makes a difference, but I am not about to stop doing it, as they come out absolutely perfect everytime! My family raves when I even mention I am thinking of making them for breakfast!There are 6 of us in the house, and I do have to at least double the recipe. MMMMMMMM!

Very good and easy to make!  Why bother with 'pancake mixes' from the store?  You can modify these in many ways.  I upped the fiber content by adding in some wheat bran, which gave it a hearty texture.  I used blueberry greek yogurt which was wonderful.  Raspberries are also very good in these.

I tried these for labor day breakfast and got huge raves. I went crazy and added buttermilk instead of milk - the consistency was really thick, but the taste is fantastic. I thinned them out with a little milk and whipped up a blueberry syrup with the rest of the batch of berries from our local farmers' market. I just heard for the fourth time how much my boyfriend liked these pancakes.

These were really yummy and easy to make.  I used frozen blueberries.  I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 cup more milk.  Also used 1 and 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat.  All I had was vanilla yogurt. I kind of wish I had put in a little more cinnamon.  Some of my family ate them with powdered sugar, some with syrup.  Thanks!
