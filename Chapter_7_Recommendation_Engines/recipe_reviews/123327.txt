With just a couple of minor adjustments this is a 5-star dish, one I grew up with and have made many, many times in my life! To us Italians, eating pasta like this is similar to how we also think of mashed potatoes--served to accompany, not overshadow, meat--therefore, I don't see "bland" as a relevant way to describe this. Don't boil the garlic in the pasta water and don't use garlic salt. It doesn't make sense to me to discard the garlic only to add garlic salt.  Rather, mince the garlic, and cook it in the butter over low heat just until fragrant, but don't let it brown.  The Parmesan cheese and chives are flavorful additions that complete the dish.  Reserve some of the  cooking water to add to the pasta, as it absorbs liquids readily and may get gummy without it.  I served this tonight with "Pork Chops with Herbed Gravy" and, as usual, it was simply and perfectly delicious.

This is a great side dish if you don't follow the recipe.  I know that sounds strange.  I am not Italian, but I never heard of putting garlic into pasta water! What a waste!  I cooked the pasta and drained it.  Then took the garlic and sauteed that in some butter until it was browned.  I used fresh basil instead of the chives.  You can pretty much use any combination of herbs here (oregano, basil, parsley).  Just remember to taste it.  I added the garlic and herbs to the pasta along with the extra melted butter, tossed it and then added parmesan cheese.  It makes a nice, flavorful, simple, easy to do, side dish that virtually takes no time at all to create.  It's a shame that this is getting poor reviews as written.

Pretty good. I threw in some chopped broccoli to make an all-in-one side dish. Very simple.

Pretty good. I did change it a bit. I didn't add the garlic to the water but added it to the butter and cooked it just a little bit. Simple easy and a great side dish.

I used I can't believe its not butter medditerranean blend in place of butter and it tasted great.  Its kind of bland, but great under chicken parm or a similar dish . . . I also had to use more regular salt on top of the garlic salt

I cooked the Angel Hair pasta according to package directions, but omitted adding the garlic to the water. Once I drained the pasta, I reserved some of the cooking water to add to the pasta later when I mixed everything together. I added a little olive oil and a tab of butter to the pot and heated it up. I minced up a couple of garlic cloves, tossed it in the pot with the oil/butter and let it cook on low heat until it got fragrant. The garlic, oil and butter aroma was a sweet and pleasant smell. I added the cooked pasta and mixed everything in the pot. I seasoned with Hawaiian sea salt, Parmesan cheese and fresh chopped chives. I gently tossed the pasta noodles to coat everything evenly. The Parmesan cheese and chives are flavorful additions that make this dish complete. The garlic, chives and butter flavored the pasta wonderfully. This side dish can also serve as a main course with some chicken or shrimp tossed in. A very simple and flavorful side dish with pleasing results! Tonight, I served this with, “Chicken Parmesan Bundles,” and “Bacon Bean Stalks,” also from this website.

I didn't like this dish at all.  I thought it would be really flavorful, but it was bland.  I wouldn't make it again and apparently my guests didn't like it much either because they asked for spaghetti sauce.

I boiled the pasta separate from the garlic.  Added all the ingredients after draining the pasta.  Added garlic salt to taste before serving.  Paired with creamy green bean parmesan and filet mignon from this site, perfection.

Very yummy and a recipe I will repeat, but the garlic salt is wrong here. With such simple flavors the garlic salt comes off much too harsh. I will follow others suggestions and keep my garlic out of the pasta water, melting the butter and giving minced garlic a quick saute before topping the pasta with it. Thanks for sharing.
