The first step didn't make any sense to me......so I altered it. I kept the flour and garlic powder but I also added onion powder and fresh ground pepper. I dredged the meat in the flour mixture and browned the meat. I did not bother transferring anything to the crockpot, I just added it all and once it was simmering, I put a lid on it, turned down the heat and just let it cook down and thicken. It took about an hour and a half to get to gravy consistancy. I served this and though we wanted to love it, it was REALLY salty. I think it might have been different if it had been served over plain rice or even buttered egg noodles.......but I don't know. I apologize, this just wasn't for us.

I cooked this for date night with hubby. Used Elk Steak instead of beef. This was fantastic! Cooked exactly as written. Was about to serve and realized the recipe hadn't included the browning sauce ingredient. Oh well! Yummy anyway! Will make again.

I wanted to love this recipe, but I was actually pretty disappointed. First of all, I think there is something wrong with step one. 1/4 cup of flour + 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce makes a paste that really isn't cut for dredging meat in...I think the measurements must be off a little bit. I like Worcestershire sauce, but the taste of it was a bit too strong in this recipe, especially when paired with the flavor of the wine. The instructions also leave out instructions about when to add the Kitchen Bouquet, so I just added mine when I added the merlot, etc. I love the premise of this recipe, but I think it needs a bit of adjusting. As written, the rice was actually my favorite part.

The Worcestershire was so strong it was not edible.  I was so sad because one of the best photos was on the front page so I decided to make for dinner.  I'm not sure what could have saved it.  We did strain out the meat and mushrooms, I gave them a quick rinse and we were able to eat it.  Such a strong flavor is not our type of meal.  So sorry.

Ok, had to alter a bit, so bear with me.  The recipe is great!  I subbed Marsala for merlot, and think any red wine would be great. I didn't realize I was low on Worcestershire so in step 1, I added some olive oil and wine to make a thick coating liquid.  Then followed the recipe, except I simmered on the stove instead of slow cooker. Took a couple of hours then made rice.  No browning sauce here, so just browned per recipe then added ingredients as written.  Love how the rice came out and there was plenty of gravy. I always add garlic powder, onion powder and heat (like red pepper flakes) to everything to our taste. Wow! this is a winner!!!! 
Oh, and had to use sirloin tip steaks that we cut into tips because that's what the grocery store had.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was stated and it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  I wont make it again. Overall I think 3 out of 5 is average and that is what it was.

I made this recipe and it’s wonderful… But the ingredients call for kitchen bouquet browning sauce. In the directions, it doesn’t tell you where to use that ingredient… An oversight I think… So I did not use it in my recipe

Family loved it, except for the rice (a bit soupy). Like other reviewers I omitted the Worcestershire sauce in the flour mix, instead added it to the sauce. My crockpot has a browning feature so I did it all in one pot. After 7 hours the sauce was still pretty thin, so I increased the heat to 400 (sear), removed the lid  and let it simmer for about 40 minutes, thickened up nicely at that point.

Very bland. The first step didn't make sense so I skipped it, the recipe calls for too much broth so it doesn't end up like gravy. To make it edible I added a packet of Lipton beefy onion. I'll make it again, but I will use half the amount of broth and add more seasoning, including the Lipton. The Lipton really gave it flavor.

I  reduced the servings to 2, & used Cab instead of merlot.  I started  too late in the day  so I  used the pressure  cooker for 35 min  instead  of the slow  cooker after I  had sautéed  the onions & mushrooms and  browned the meat.  I really like  the paste for seasoning the  meat  but will reduce the Worcestershire sauce next time.  Love the flavored  rice!  Will make that again as a side for another time.

Instead of 8 hrs in the slow cooker just place in a Dutch or French oven for 3 hrs at 300 degrees.   Sooooooo tender!

YES YES YES!!! This is amazing. I followed it as written, except for noodles instead of rice. 20 minutes before serving, I dumped 1/2 a box of Penne Rigate noodles in the slow cooker. This recipe tasted amazing..Will definately be making this again.

We made the recipe as is with exception to adding the Worcestershire sauce to the flour mixture.  We added it with the broth.  The meat was tender and the flavor in the gravy was deep and rich.  We served it with egg noodles.  We didn't think the flavored rice was necessary. The next time we make it we will thicken up the gravy.

Very tasty. I was short on time so sliced beef stew meat into smaller pieces then dredged in flour mixture (used only 2 tsp Worchestershire. 1/4 cup seemed like too much- it is a strong flavor) then cooked it in pan on stove top. Followed the directions from there.  Meat was very tender.
