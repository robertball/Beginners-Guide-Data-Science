Great recipe, I've made this sauce for nearly 20 years as soon as I find the berries in the market.  Packed into sterile jars, it's great to share during the upcoming holidays.  Be sure to cover, the heavier the pan - the better, and I add chopped navel orange peel, which candies somewhat. The brandy should be added when it's hot and just finished baking.  Don't stir, just pour over the top. The alcohol evaporates off and the berries plump up with the syrup from the liquid.  Don't double the recipe, make it twice. Enjoy & share!

This recipe was easy to make and it tasted great.  Since I'm not a big fan of alcohol(and I had kids over for dinner and didn't want to get them buzz), I used 1/3 cup of apple juice and 1 tablespoon of brandy and it turned out just right

Homerun!!! This recipe is YUMMY and EASY!!!  Everytime I take it somewhere, people ask for the recipe. I made this sauce as well as the brandied orange cranberry sauce from allrecipes.com and this one was the overwhelming favorite....and so much easier to make.  This will be my standard cranberry sauce from now on.

I could not figure this out. All the sugar dried and hardened like cement on bottom of casserole dish. Would like to try again...need some advice.

I absolutely love this recipe! It has become a tradition for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Unique and so simple. I love the addition of brandy. It's quite sweet so I cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup.

So easy and delicious.  I substituted Splenda for Sugar and 1/3 c. apple juice + 1 oz. cherry brandy (kirchwasser) for the brandy.  AND I made it the night before Thanksgiving.  It was the perfect blend of tart and sweet.

I like the simplicity of this recipe- throw everything in a pan in the oven and stir a lot.  I decreased the sugar because I like the tart taste, and left out the brandy because one of my guests dislikes the taste of alcohol in food.  In its place, I used a little bit of lime extract about halfway through the baking process.  The simplicity and flavor were great, my only issue was that its so hard to clean the dish afterwards because all the sugar bakes (crystallizes) onto the sides.  Next time I will probably try all the same ingredients but just do it on the stove at a lower heat for a longer time and see if that works any better.

Awesome.  My favorite cranberry sauce, ever.  If you like cranberries, there's really no way you won't like this.  I make it at least twice a year.  No more canned cranberry sauce around here.

The BEST - have been making for years -   I cut the sugar in half and sometimes vary the flavor by using apricot or blackberry brandy -- a winner !

This is a great, easy recipe. I use about 1/2 less sugar and its great. This is the 3rd year making it and people ask all the time for the recipe! Make sure you mix it , a few time while in the oven.

We weren't crazy about these. I guess we are just too used to the "original" cranberries boiled in sugar and water.

I altered the recipe to 3 cups cranberries (1 bag), 1 cup of sugar, and 1/4 cup blackberry brandy.  Fantastic!!  Very sweet, and next time will use 3/4 cup sugar- but it will become a regular addition to my Thanksgiving table.

I've made this recipe for the past 5 or so years ... each time it gets rave reviews and I have even been asked for the recipe a time or two.
If you are looking for an alternative without taking away from tradition ... this is the way to go.

This is a very forgiving recipe.  I used a mix of frozen, fresh, and thawed from frozen berries, and only remembered to stir once (and then forgot and left it in the oven longer than 1 hour) and it still turned out quite nicely.  I cooked it in a pyrex 2qt casserole dish with a lid, and although the sugar hadn't even completely mixed in when I took it out of the oven, the berries had all cooked and when I stirred then, it all came together quite nicely.  There was no crystallized sugar on the dish at all.  I stirred in the brandy (only used 2T because I'm not a huge fan of brandy and that was a great amount for us) and then recovered the dish and let it sit overnight and it has a nice light gel this morning. My children don't care for the lumps, but I expected that.  I think my parents will enjoy this more grown-up cranberry sauce.

I loved, loved, loved this recipe Thank You for sharing Marion. I have a few cranberry sauces in my recipe box and have enjoyed them as well although they were a little to tart at times they were also delicious but this one is it. I will keep this and make it from now on! I followed other reviews and substituted apple juice for the brandy and only added an additional Table spoon of brandy since I have some very traditional "picky" eaters.

Just made the recipe and I think it looks and tastes good except it's too much sugar. If I made it again I would use probably 4C cranberries to 1.25 cups sugar.

I cut back on the brandy per everyone's suggestions.  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving! I will definitely add it to our traditional Thanksgiving dinner.

This is fantastic!  It will be my only cranberry sauce.  I cut down the brandy (it was a little too strong for me) but it doesn't get any easier or better than this!

Wow!! This is great! The only thing I will change next time is letting my frozen cranberries thaw.  I did not do that and as a result of that, had a lot of liquid in the dish, still good though. 
My only modification is what a previous reviewer suggested. She subbed 1/3 C. of Apple juice for the equal amt. of brandy, and added 1 T. of brandy. That's what I did and I loved the results. 
I love cranberries anyway.  Thanks

I make a recipe just like this every year at Thanksgiving.  I haven't tried the brandy.  My family has always made it with pecans - about a half a cup or so chopped.  It's delicious with the turkey.

Perfect taste after sitting in the fridge for a few days. Next time i'll crush up the berries a bit so they go on smoother on the left-over turkey sandwiches.

A few people are concerned about the brandy being too strong. To rectify this one might add the brandy to the baking dish about 10 minutes before removal from oven.  The alcohol will while the brandy taste is preserved. Bon appetit.

I have made this many, many times and it is always delicious!  I omit the brandy and add approx. 1/2 teaspoon of grated orange peel.  Also, I cover it while baking and I don't bother stirring.

This was the first time I've made "real" cranberries. WOW! I will never go back to the red glob in the can. These were delicious and so easy. The only thing I did differently was half the recipe and add to that the grated peel of one orange.

I really liked it, and for those of us who like cranberries, it was delicious.  Now the rest of the family tried it, most of whom do not eat cranberry dishes, and they did not want seconds.  They did not react as badly as they do to cranberry jelly, but it still was not a "pleaser."  I will continue to use the dish at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  You have to have cranberries during the holidays.  Simple to make, and pleasing for cranberry eaters.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year. I replaced the brandy with reduced orange juice and baked it longer for a thicker consistency -- it was wonderful, especially considering I've always preferred the canned jellied sauce! Thanks!

I made this for Christmas and then again for Easter and everyone loved it. It has the perfect amount of Brandy. The only change I make is,I throw in a couple of slices of orange peel while it's cooking. Tastes great heated and poured over ice cream too.

This was far too sweet for my tastes. I did use apple juice instead of brandy though. I won't use this one again.

I make this every year for Christmas and a Thanksgiving. I cut back on the brandy to a 1/4 cup and it's not so overpowering. My trick is to stir everything together and use a good glass baking dish. It doesn't seem to stick in my Pyrex baking dish. I also pull it out after 30 minutes to give it a good stir. I always get rave reviews for this super easy recipe. By the way, this is great warmed up on top of good French Vanilla ice cream!

I've immured the brandy, because I didn't have any. And used some fresh lime juice and lime zest. I've rep early been asked for the recipe . The lime really brightens the flavors.

Made this for last night's turkey dinner.
Everyone like it, it had a good balance of tart/sweetness.
I read a few ratings about it failing so I checked other recipes done the same way and them mentioned to stir it to stop the sugar from crusting on the bottom, came out great.
I used 1 3/4 C sugar, 1/4 tsp.grated nutmeg and I reluctantly added all the called for Brandy. Once it had chilled well the brandy flavor lightened up somewhat, So I was pleased.
Simple and quick.
