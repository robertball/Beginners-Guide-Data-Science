I made this for my wife for Mothers Day. I was nervous about baking but it turned out great. She even liked it better than her berry cobbler that she has been making for years. We can't wait for fresh blackberries this summer! Awesome recipe!

This is a fascinating recipe.  Instead of placing dollops of raw dough on top of the fruit, the raw dough goes on the bottom, and during baking rises to the top.  I ran this procedure by a friend and she commented that this must be a very old recipe, indeed.

None-the-less, it turns out beautifully.  I reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup in the final (third step), and it is sweet enough, especially with vanilla ice creme.  Once cooled, it does form a purple gelatanous base, but this could be scraped off to lessen calories even further. 

We are swimming in blackberries and this recipe is one delicious, easy, and impressive way to use them.  Any berry, fruit or rhubarb could be used.

Delicious! This was simple to make and turned out well. I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8" dish. The baking time remained the same. Great use of fresh berries!

This recipe was fantastic! It was the best cobbler I have ever had, and certainly the best I have ever made.  Whole family loved it and we finished the 9X13 pan in two days!!! A great way to use berries! I made it exactly to the recipe and it was perfect.  I plan to try it with other fruits, depending on the season. hope it works as well!

I made this cobbler today for my husband and in-laws. I followed the recipe exactly. The breading part had a nice and tasty consistency but 2 cups of fresh blackberries did not make this dessert fruity enough for me. I served it warm with a dollop of vanilla ice cream, but there was too much cake to counter the fruit in my opinion. The recipe is quite simple and I will use it again, but next time I will at least double the fruit portion.

I made half of this recipe, using skim milk and slightly less sugar than it calls for because my wild berries were sweet. We loved the texture of the cake and how it looks when it's all nicely baked. Will make again!

So easy and tastes amazing!  I added about 3 cups of blackberries and it still turned out great.

Tasted very sweet, but was almost too squishy with all the boiling water.  Just didn't bake up the best.  Might try it with less water.

I made this last year or so, and remember it being pretty good and very easy to prepare.  I will have to try it again to refresh my memory.

My family went blackberry picking yesterday, so my mom decided she wanted to something made with the massive amount of blackberries. This recipe was fantastic! The bread portion was fluffy and moist, and the fruit on top with the sugar crust was a perfect balance for this sweet tooth. The boiling water created a syrup that kept the bread extra moist (although my mother liked it better once it cooled done). I used 1/4 cup of cream with the rest milk when making the bread potion, but otherwise followed by the book. Unfortunately my dad is allergic to fruit and sugar combos, but oh~well (might try making one with honey with some of the leftover berries) ...

Love it! Try substituting the butter with a 100 g pot of unsweetened apple puree. Works really well

Delicious! This recipe was so easy and it turned out perfect.  I was unsure about using a full cup of sugar on step 3 so I only used 2/3 cup.  As strange as it seemed to build the cobbler "upside-down" and pour the water on top, it came out beautifully.  It's fluffy, moist, sweet (should have used the full cup of sugar!) and yummy.

It's very good. I didn't go exactly by the recipe. I melted the butter in the pan and poured  a little in the batter because it was way to thick to pour. I added more milk to make it pourable. I mixed all the sugar in the batter using  1 cup sugar substitute and 1 cup regular sugar. I let it stay an additional 10 minutes for 1 hour cook time, trying to get it to brown more but that could have been the lack of real sugar. It's delicious.

Way too much sugar for me, but otherwise liked it a lot. Will definitely make again, but with a quarter of the sugar in that last step.

Average at best. The picture looks like the cobbler made by various aunts & grandmothers when we were growing up but the final product looked & tasted nothing like it. This is more like blackberry cake. Definitely not what I was looking for. I follow the directions explicitly except that I decreased the boiling water- thank goodness I did that! I’ve gotten several medals on my True Southern Cook sash but this recipe won’t be earning one. Moving on to find one that will.

I adore this! It has water over the top to give a gelatin type texture. Very delicious, and once, I even used blueberries too in this delactable classic. It's so addictive to grab the whole 19X13 pan and slap it all onto your plate! (especially if YOU made it) ;)
very, very, VERY delicious!!! I have actually made this a tradition to make this dessert every friday night in blackberry season. You'll love this dessert! if it doesn't come out right...try again. It will.

First time making blackberry cobbler. I usually make peach. Blackberry is my new favorite! This was delicious topped with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream and some banana slices! The only changes were a little less sugar on top (I used about 3/4 cup) and I sprinkled a little blueberries on top with the blackberries.

I have made this super quick recipe many times. It is just wonderful. I tend to always have these ingredients on hand, the fruit I have used fresh and frozen. Sometimes just one fruit, sometimes multiple. It is just great. Top off to a complete 10 with whipped cream and or some vanilla ice cream. We just love it. Don't need to change one thing!
