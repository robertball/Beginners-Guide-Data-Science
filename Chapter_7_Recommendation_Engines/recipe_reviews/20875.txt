This is a great recipe. I really liked it just as it is, but on my second shot I threw in 1 tbsp minced garlic and served in over portabella mushroom caps. HEAVEN!!

This recipe is great as-is.  No modifications are necessary.  This shouldn't be served as main course meal.  For the past 5 years we served this, double-size, every year for Christmas Eve.  Serve with crackers, or your other favorite bread snack.    My only alteration is I add 50% more crab meat.  It makes for a more dense crab, if you like it more like hearty stew.

This recipe was not what I expected, although I did you canned crabmeat.  It looked like mac N cheese.  Not a good presentation for supper.

This is a simple yet great recipe. The secret, as always, is in the ingredients. FRESH crab and parmesan reggiano really kick it off. I add scallops and mushrooms when it's a "special" dinner.

Oh, and I used beer (lager) instead of sherry just because we had it and, honestly, Iâ€™ll probably do that every time!

Delicious recipe! I did add about 1 clove garlic and some minced onion, maybe 1 tablespoon. The crab flavor really came through! The crab disintegrated into the sauce, next time I'll add the crab last and should be fine. I used fresh blue crab, canned might hold it's shape better. I would like to try this sauce with other seafood as well.

Simple to make, elegant to serve. I used fresh caught crab and did not make any changes. Served with lemon slices. We will be having this again.
