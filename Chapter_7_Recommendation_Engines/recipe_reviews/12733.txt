Super recipe!  I used no crust and made the following basic changes: 2 6 oz. cans crabmeat, no mayo - used light & plain yogurt instead, egg substitute in place of 3 eggs, pre-shredded light swiss cheese, added 1 tsp. old bay seasoning, 1 tsp. garlic powder, dash of salt & pepper, & 1 tsp. hot sauce.   It was wonderful!  I have also doubled the recipe, using no crust & baked it in an 11x7 Pyrex dish for approx. 70-75 minutes.  Cut into squares & served many at a brunch!  This recipe freezes so well, too!

I've been using this recipe for over 20 years and have made it many dozens of times; I think I first got it from Southern Living. It tastes great, but it's a bit finicky, and sometimes I have a hard time getting it to set up properly. It does seem to help using three eggs instead of two. DO NOT use low-fat mayo or it will never set up. I've made it with different cheeses and with other meats or veggies in lieu of crab; it's very versatile and tasty with all the variations. But make sure it's well browned on top, and test it with a knife to make sure it's set before you take it out of the oven.

After reading other reviews I used:
2 6oz cans crab meat, drained;
3 eggs instead of two;
and added: 
teaspoon hot sauce;
2 garlic cloves;
a bit less than a cup sharp cheddar cheese, grated;
and baked for one hour 15 minutes. 
YUM!!!
I baked it all in a deep dish 9" pie shell which was the perfect size. No need to get picky about measuring. I just approximated everything and it was perfect. Great recipe.

Great recipe!  I used 2 cups of lump crabmeat, 3 eggs, added the tabasco (1/2 t), Old Bay (1 tsp), and sauteed the green onions with red & green peppers.  It was so easy and a big hit.  This is a keeper!

This is an excellent dish: I would recommend the addition of an extra egg, cheddar instead of swiss, Old Bay seasoning, and dash of tobasco.- just to kick it up a little

This was a very good quiche!  Like others, I used two cans of crab meat, and added an extra egg, 2 cloves of garlic, salt, pepper, and seafood seasoning and omitted the crust.  Halfway through baking, I also added enough extra swiss cheese to cover the top of the casserole.  This created a cheesy "crust" for the top of the quiche.  Great for low carb dieters!

This was delicious as a crustless quiche. I just poured the filling into 4 greased individual casserole dishes.  Easy and so good!

As others suggested, I added one egg, some Old Bay seasoning and Cayenne pepper, and 1 cup of chopped, sauted spinach leaves which added a wonderful texture and color!  If you can, spring for fresh crab meat, usually found ready-to-go in small containers at your grocers seafood dep't.  I've made the dish with both canned and fresh crabmeat without telling my family of the change, and they picked up on it.  Fresh crab meat will cost you about $2-$3 more, but if you can't spring for fresh, go ahead and make the recipe with the canned crab meat because it is still a really great quiche.

I dind't have a pie crust so I used Bisquick and turned it into an impossible crab quiche. I followed the recipe (with noted changes and poured into an ungreased 9 inch pie pan. I then added 3/4 cup of Bisquick and mixed it up. I baked it for about 45 minutes at 350. It was GREAT and sooooo easy!!!

I added a small amount of green peper, dry mustard, parsley, and old bay seasoning for flavor.  I also had montery jack and parmesan cheese handy and mixed that with the swiss cheese for a really great tasting quiche I'll make again.  My picky 15 yr. old daughter loved it.

I have been searching FOREVER for the perfect crab quiche recipe. This one gets 4 stars "as is" but 5 stars with  modifications. (I read ALL of the 282 reviews!) So (1) decide if the crab is the focal point or just an ingredient. If the focus, you must use 2 cans of lump crab. If it's just an ingredient, 1 can of claw meat is OK. I used the 2 cans of lump. (2) I don't care for melted Swiss cheese (too tangy) & cheddar in a quiche can get oily when it melts, but I do like its flavor. So---I used 1 cup of fine shred cheddar and 1 cup of crumbled goat cheese, which presented a really good texture & flavor. (3) For sub-flavors without detracting from the crab: I VERY THINLY sliced about a dozen small button mushrooms, shredded 1/2 of a medium yellow onion, and saute'd them together in a tblspn each of olive oil & butter, seasoned with a little celery salt. Added about 1 1/2 cups baby spinach to the saute and cooked down . Layered into the pie crust in order: crab, mushroom mixture, cheeses. (4) Combined 4 eggs in a blender with 1 cup of half & half, dash of salt, cayenne & dry mustard. Pour over & baked 45 minutes at 350. Result: Perfect quiche where the CRAB is the star!!!

i have made a similar one for many years.  i add some choppped shrimp and mushrooms.  however, for the past few years, i have omitted the crust for fewer calories and also, sometimes when you feel like whipping up a quiche, you don't always have a pie crust.  i also do half and half swiss and cheddar.  it's a keeper.

This was our dinner tonight, and it was sooooo good. Like the others, I used three eggs. I used two cups of fresh crab, and just over one cup of various cheeses, including a spicy cheddar. I had no onion, so instead I added a small can of drained jalapeno, plus 1 tablespoon each of old bay, garlic powder, and onion powder. I also dusted the top with old bay and paprika. I omitted the pie shell, and just baked it for 75 minutes in a pie dish. Served with garlic bread and salad. We all ate too much! Yum!

This was great!  I basically doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan since I was cooking for a crowd.  I just made a couple of changes.  I added chopped shrimp,  minced red pepper, 2 additional eggs - 8 total and used shredded chedder instead of swiss.  This recipe is a keeper!

I will definitely make this again. I used 3 eggs, some hot sauce and Old Bay seasoning as suggested by other cooks.  I did not use a crust and baked these in buttered small souffle dishes.  Great recipe!

This is more like a souffle than a quiche. The mayo makes it quite greasy. Milk is not used in quiche. Perhaps this would be better by using half and half or cream and not putting in the mayo. Increase the amount of liquid to compensate for not having the mayo.
Don't be tempted to use canned crab. Canned crab tastes nothing like fresh crab. Quiche is meant to be mild tasting. It's French and they don't use  hot sauce, etc.

I added two extra eggs, spinach, an extra can of crab, Old Bay seasoning and some extra sharp cheddar cheese.  It was delicious!  Highly recomended.  Next time I would definately add some shrimp for extra flavor.

Oh man, was this good.  I made this as an entree for company with a simple salad - used just under a pound of lump crab, 3 eggs, and added some black pepper and fresh garlic.  Easy, very rich, and impressive.  I love this site!

Incorporated the review suggestions (hot sauce, garlic, Old Bay, 3 eggs), used great quality crab, made the crust from scratch but still was the biggest loser at our Easter brunch.  Little to no takers and no one finished their piece if they did.  I didn't like it either, it just didn't seem like the best choice for lovely fresh crab.

Great flavor.  I used a frozen pie shell that I had let defrost.  Then I used 2 cans of lump crab that I completely drained and squeezed mostly dry.  Everything else was as called for.  It was perfect and my husband loved it too!  Thank you.

I made the recipe almost exactly as written, added the extra egg because I had fresh crab and added it all (approx. 2 1/2 cups) and splashed Old Bay seasoning and salt and pepper. It turned out divine!! I would have paid big $$ for it! Will definitely make again when crab is in season!

This is my go-to crab quiche recipe. I reduce the fat by using fat free mayo, egg beaters and skim milk or fat free half & half. Rave reviews every time!

Overall I enjoyed this quiche! I believe simple flavors are best especially when you have an ingredient as delicate as crab. It is very easy to overpower crab with aromatics losing the essence of the crab itself. This recipe allows the flavor of the crab to shine through and is delicious. With that being said, I am from the DC/Maryland area and couldn't resist adding a few dashes of old bay. Not enough to over power it but just enough to get a hint of the flavor. I will say that I think that the cheese isn't necessary in this dish, and traditionally crab isn't paired with cheese. The next time I make this I will eliminate the cheese all together as I believe it actually detracted from the dish. I will make this again with said changes. Thanks for the recipe!

MAN this was awesome!  It really does taste like a giant crabcake.  I upped the crab to two 8oz jars, substituted half a large yellow onion for the green onions (couldn't find them in the store!), 3 eggs, real mayo, 1% milk, substituted Monty Jack for Swiss, 2tbsp flour, about a tsp of Old Bay, and skipped the pie crust.  Cooked for about 65 minutes.  Only thing I'll do the next time I can afford the crab will be to add more Old Bay; we live in MD after all!  SUPERB

This is my new favorite quiche base.  It is so quick and easy and uses stuff you would have on hand any day of the week. I don't know if I will ever use a different one.  I did add 1/2 tsp of old bay and upped the eggs to 3 like previous reviews had mentioned, and I used Mozz cheese because it was all I had on hand, but BOY was the flavor and texture on the mark with this!  I made two, one using a can of crab and the other using a half a zucchini grated as a vegetarian substitute, and both got raves. YUM!!!

1st time: I used 3 cans of crab and plain yogurt instead of mayo. salt, pepper, garlic, Old Bay
2nd time: 2 cans crab, sour cream instead of mayo, 3 eggs, no additional seasoning. Still great!

Love this! Fresh Blue Crab (Lump) was on sale this week, so I made this. I did skip the crust as we are on Atkins. I did use 1/4 c heavy cream and 1/4 c whole milk instead of the 1/2c milk. I also substituted shredded sharp cheddar for the swiss and added a dash of Old Bay (Can't have crab in MD without the Old Bay) Thanks Christine

Very, very good.  Easy to make. I used Parmesan cheese and onions instead of Swiss cheese and green onions because that's what I had on hand and used Eggbeaters due to high cholesterol.  I probably should have let it bake just a few more minutes.  Next time I will.

This resulted in a great, great dinner! For those who don't like mayonnaise, I omitted it entirely and made up the difference with a third egg and an extra 1/4 of milk. The quiche was still rich and creamy. I also added asparagus and sauteed onions, and used shredded jack and chedder cheese. I also let it cook for an hour and let the top brown. It was really fantastic, very gourmet and delicious! Thank you, I will make this over and over.

I followed the recipe, yet took advice from reviewers.  I added extra crab meat for thickening, and I added some garlic salt and a hint of cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. It tasted ok.  I noticed a lot of people added a third egg, and I'm now wondering if that step would be beneficial because the mixture was a bit gooey in the center.  I also cooked 5 min extra because the top was barely beginning to brown.  I wanted it to be a bit darker.  I like the fact that the green onion gives it color, yet due to its lack of flavor, I would probably mix some red or white onions in next time.  This dish is probably not anything I'd make for a group that I'm trying to impress, but it isn't bad for a quick meal with the family.

This was soooo good!  The reviewer who recommended adding the garlic, tabasco and old bay hit the nail on the head. The taste was superb and after sprinkling some old bay on the top, the presentation was great too.  I did saute' the green onions til tender.  Yum!

This is one of my favorite receipes.  I made six industrial size pans full for my sister's wedding breakfast...along with three salmon and three Quiche Lorraine...there wasn't a single square of this left.  I make it without the crust, for the perfect low carb food for any meal.  It is easy to serve and people love it.  This is really one of my favorite foods.

Just absolutely delicious and very very tasty! I decided to divide the mixture into mini quiche sizes using my muffin tin lined with puff pastry (made about 10) so I could freeze some off for during the week.
I used whole egg mayonnaise for a fuller flavour and replaced the swiss cheese with shredded tasty chedder as I didn't have any swiss on hand. I also added 1/4 cup of sweet diced bell pepper, 1/4 cup of cooked diced bacon, a few splashes of Tabasco sauce and cracked black pepper to taste. Mine took about 25-30 minutes to cook and they rose beautifully.
I have to say this is THE best quiche I've ever made and the ones left in the freezer won't last long.
I will definately make these again! 5 stars all the way!!!

This quiche is always a hit.  I use Pillsbury croissants and line the pan with the rolled-out dough.  I've added mushrooms also.  Sometimes I use fake crab which has much more flavor.  Delish!

I took the advice of others and added: 1/2t Old Bay, squeeze of lemon, a few drops of Tabasco, extra 1/2 cup of cheese, 2 additional eggs and the extra crab.  It was way too crabby.  I think the additions are great except for the extra crab, the quiche doesn't need it.  The extra crab over powered all the other flavors.

Imitation crab is great with this recipe if you chop it in the food processor before you add it.  The sweet crab needs blends with the tart swiss cheese for a nicely balanced taste.  I added chopped green onion after baking to give it a fresh look.  Pretty dish.

Super easy to make, and my husband loved it! I made it with 4 eggs, substituted condensed milk, and lined the bottom of pie shell with slices of swiss cheese.  Added a dash of salt-free herb seasoning and black pepper. Might use a bit of hot sauce next time to spice it up.

I have been making this recipe crab or shrimp quiche for 36 years.  First got the recipe from the Memphis Commercial Appeal.  I always use Gruyere cheese as it melts in much smoother fashion.  I also use about 1 Tbsp minced parsley.  You can also add about 2 Tbsp Vermouth.  Sliced mushrooms make a nice addition.  Very versatile basic quiche.  Use your imagination!

Very quick and easy to make. Since I was raised in Maryland I seasoned the crab meat with lots of old bay seasoning and pepper and celery salt before mixing the ingredients. The only other thing different was I added baby spinach to the dish...DELICIOUS!!!

I just made this recipe on the weekend, and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised. I didn't change a thing, but there would be one change that I would make in the future. The next time I make this, I would par bake the crust for approx. 5 minutes so that the crust would be a little more cooked before adding the rest of the ingredients. This recipe is so simple and tasty making it a definite KEEPER!!!!

This recipe was great, light, and fluffy!  With adding some spices, it was a 5 star recipe.  I made a few changes, used low fat mayo, fat free milk, real crab, 2 eggs and the equivalent of 2 additional eggs in egg beaters, used a mix of swiss and sharp cheddar cheese.  Spice wise, I added salt, pepper, 3 cloves of garlic, Old Bay, Franks Hot Sauce (about 3 tablespoons), and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Yum!

Used a can of fat-free evaporated milk, and added an extra egg and a small tin of "tiny shrimp" (drained). Next time, will cut mayo in half.. overall, delish!

I first made this recipe with 2-6oz cans of crab meat. We thought that was pretty good. I made it the other day, doubling the ingredients and using 1 lb of lump crab meat yielding 2-9in. deep dish pies and they were magnificent! Everybody loved them! My sister-in-law raved and wants the recipe--which is a first.  My boss wants me to bring it to our Christmas party!! I'll make this again for sure.  Thanks for the perfect crab quiche.

I also added an extra egg and hot sauce.  I didn't have green onions, so I sauted a yellow onion and added it to the mix.  I used imitation crab meat.  Everyone thought this was great.

Very good!  I used 1 lb. lump crab meat (a bit too much now that I tasted it) and to save on fat I used low fat crescent rolls for the crust.  Sliced nicely too.  Even my picky husband liked it.  Will definitely make this again.

Made this quiche, as well as 3 other quiche recipes, for a bridal shower. This was the only one that had any left over. It tasted fine, but it didn't blow me away. Maybe my expectations were too high.

We had this for dinner last night along with a tossed salad.  After the first bite, I hoped noone else would like it....that way I could eat it all!  The only change I made was to add a little bit of ground red pepper, as I do with my crab cakes.  I will use the again....and often!

Amazing!  My first attempt at making quiche, and it was delicious and easy.  Followed others recommendations and used 3 eggs, salt/pepper/garlic/cayenne, and some broccoli for colour.  This is definitely a new favourite!

per other reviews, I used two 6oz cans of drained crabmeat, 1 tsp each of garlic powder, Tobasco and Old Bay seasoning, and red onion rather than green onion. This was a very good quiche!

This was a nice quiche. Next time though, I would double the filling as it was rather skimpy. I would also shred the cheese rather than cube it to distribute it more evenly throughout.

Great!! I did add an extra egg (3) and 3/4 cup of Mayo as I used a pound of fresh lump crab meat and also, I added a 1/8 tps of Ground Cayenne Red Pepper with a sprinkle across the top with Old Bay.  You really do need the deep dish pie shell with the added crab meat.

This is a 5-star recipe in my book if you alter it just a bit.  The third egg is a must, plus add about a tsp of Phillips seafood seasoning and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I also made it with a mixture of Swiss and cheddar cheese.  I also used lump crab meat from the refrigerated section at Costco.  I had no problem
 with runniness, it came out perfectly cooked.  It was a huge hit for brunch and I'm baking another as I write this!

I made the quiche exactly according to the original recipe (with just an added dash of salt and pepper) and found it to be almost tasteless. I spent the money, too, to get the best crabmeat available, so I was very disappointed. My taste may be biased by the fact that  I'm a born and bred Baltimorean, and I can't enjoy crab of any kind without Old Bay. All I can say is that after a few bites, I sprinkled some Phillip's Seafood Seasoning on it and it VASTLY improved the flavor. I may make this again, but next time I will add at least a tsp of Old Bay/Phillips to the mix, and maybe a little extra kick of garlic and a little splash of lemon juice. I'd also use a bit less milk or maybe an extra egg, because I did find the filling to be just a tiny bit runny.  I so wish I could give this 5 stars, I was SO looking forward to this dish, but it just wasn't as good as it could be!

I followed the recipe except for adding 1 more egg.  Using fresh (expensive) crabmeat, even adding seasonings like Old Bay and Frank's hot sauce did nothing to this quiche.  I think the addition of flour made the texture "unquichelike."  I would not make this again.

Loved this! I made this as directed but with 2 cans of lump white crab meat since others said more crab was better. It was wonderful! It was so quick and easy to make, and tasted delicious. We had some for dinner one night, and the following day we had the leftovers for brunch.

I made a half recipe with some modifications from the suggestions of others: beat two eggs, combined with 1/4 cup light mayo, 1 TB flour, 1/4 cup milk. Sauteed 2-3TB finely chopped yellow onion with about 3 TB frozen chopped spinach in butter/olive oil mix with dash garlic salt. Added to egg mixture with one 6oz. can drained crab meat. Added heaping half cup of shredded Mexican 4-cheese mix + 2-3 Tb shredded Parmesan cheese. Added about 1/16th-1/8th tsp. each: cayenne, nutmeg, powdered yellow mustard, garlic salt, garlic powder, black pepper. Mixed and divided into two individual dishes. Baked 45 minutes at 350, sprinkled tops with a little more of the Mexican 4-cheese mix, then baked an additional 15. Wow! That was 5 stars in my opinion! My husband is not a fan of crab or spinach, and requested next time it be made with ham and no greens or garlic. He also hates quiche, but after smelling it while it baked decided to try it. He ate his whole dish-full, and when I asked would he eat it again if I made it exactly the same - he said yes. :) Winner! Thank you for sharing!

Delicious!  I used 3 eggs, full-fat mayo, and 12 oz of crab.  I added on tsp of Old Bay too.  My husband LOVED it and is begging me to make it again.

This was a really great starting point for a crab quiche. Like other reviewers, I added a third egg, and made it crustless. I also added finely chopped red pepper, celery, shallots, a tsp of paprika and a few dashes of Old Bay. I also switched the generic swiss cheese to an Emanthaler, and baked the recipe as mini quiches. I used canned crab, and no one was the wiser. This was a huge hit at our house! I will definitely be making this over and over again. So quick and easy!

It works great with shrimp, too!   I steamed the shrimp with Old Bay & beer and added about a tablespoon of Old Bay into the egg/mayo/milk and used cheddar instead of swiss cheese. Outstanding!

Fantastic recipe. I used lump claw meat (slightly over a cup)and added some asparagus. 

My son and husband LOVED it!

Next time I make this I will sprinkle Old Bay over the top of the quiche. I added that to the top on a small bite to see how it would be and my husband (a Maryland native) and I both thought it was terrific.

Fantastic!  Used shrimp instead of crab, doubled it (with extra eggs as suggested as well as garlic, tabasco, seasonings) and poured it into a greased 13x9 w/o crust for 50 minutes.  Thanks!

Very bland.  Good basic recipe if you're making your first quiche though.  Use it as a starting point for a quiche recipe...add other spices and different cheeses.

I followed the advice of others and used four eggs and added some horseradish and Tabasco. This is really good! I'll print this one out and make it again. Makes a nice Friday meal with a Caesar salad and some french bread.

I tasted the canned crab I bought before I put it in the recipe and it was not a strong flavor.  However, after the quiche was cooked there was a strong "fishy" taste to it.  Good recipe but bad choice in using the canned crab that I chose, I think.  I used Egg Beaters (egg substitute) and it came out quite nice.  I will try this recipe again using fresh crab or even shrimp.

Excellent! This is a wonderful recipe! Not that it needed anything changed, but my son prefers small quiches. So, I made homemade crust and cut it out with a biscuit cutter to fill my mini muffin tin. I also added some salad shrimp in which I put in the food processor with the immitation crabmeat. It was wonderful! Thank you for posting this recipe.

I changed this recipe a little after reading some of the reviews. I used 2-6oz.cans of crab, omitted the green onions and used Jalapeno jack cheese. I also added 1 Tbsp of chili oil. This was so good. I made this for a birthday luncheon and everyone loved it. This is definately a keeper.

I have gotten up before work in the morning and made this so it would be hot for the office...  everyone raves and it's a favorite!
I've also varied the recipe by using sausage instead of seafood or adding tiny shrimp.

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I took the advice from the other viewers by adding an extra egg, sauteed fresh spinach, garlic, portabella mushrooms, & sharp cheddar cheese.  I used 3/4 c. of egg beaters as a substitute for the eggs.  My husband kept saying it was delicious & he had two servings.  Definitely, will be making it again?? You betcha ??

This is a delicious dish. I used Phillips crab claw meat, added 4 ounces of garlic herb cream cheese, did not use a pie crust and used regular small onion rather than the green onions. I will make this again. It even tastes good cold! Very easy to make. KMENTZER

Oh, my, I crave this! I always double the recipe and it fills two purchased deep dish pie crusts. The only change I make, only because I had no mayonnaise on hand, was to use Miracle Whip which adds a delicious sweetness that SO compliments the crab! This time I had gruyere and will use it again next time...really, this recipe lends itself to a little this and that, and what you have on hand....It's perfect and we have another for lunch tomorrow!
Edited to add: I've used the fake carb "pollack" and it's even better! Nice chunks of 'crab', sweet flavour....MUCH prefer it over real crab which disappears into the recipe...give it a try!  Add a little Frank's Red Hot, too! Oh, you'll love it! :)

Very good!  My changes were really just to make it heartier for a meal.  I put in 1 lb of lump crab meat, about 1 1/2 cups shredded Swiss and about a tsp+ of Old Bay.  I used refrigerated roll-out pie crust in a pottery pie pan which gave it a rustic look.  My family LOVED it!  No leftovers.

For a bit of a lower fat version, I used fat-free cheddar and added only three rounded tablespoons of regular mayo.  I also added a dived green pepper and half a tablespoon of red pepper flakes.  And a third egg. Deeeelish!  Contains basic flavors that you can't go wrong with, a good staple recipe.  It took about 15 minutes longer in the over than stated but perhaps that's because of another egg?

This quiche is so yummy!  A friend had me over for lunch today and made this...it was fabulous.  We had it with a salad and it was a perfect, light lunch!  I was thinking this would be a great holiday brunch item, and you could totally tweak the recipie to your liking by adding an additional veggie to it or using a different kind of cheese in addition to or instead of the swiss.  The swiss went beautifully with the crab, however!  I was thinking that tiny shrimp would be a great addition to the crab and could be served with a white sauce.  Be sure to give this a try!  Thanks, Lynn, for a great lunch and a yummy new recipie!  :-)

Not bad... Pretty simple flavorful quiche.. If you want the cheese in quiche to not be so blended in with the mixture, a trick is to throw a few tablespoons of flour on the cheese before you mix it into the egg mixture..when you cut open your quiche, you will have nice hot cheese pockets.

Just finished this lovely dish for our Easter brunch. As most reviewers did, I too, made this without a crust, used an extra egg, 2 6oz. cans crab, and 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning. In addition, I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, as well as 1/8 c carmelized onions, and an eyeballed amount of shredded parmesan (along with the swiss cheese) and salt/pepper to taste. What a light, mild quiche! My husband added Tabasco sauce to his, but I found I liked the mildness of this quiche just as it was! I baked 25 min, took it out of the oven, sprinkled a little extra parmesan cheese on top and a few healthy shakes of dried parsley to dress it up. I let it rest nearly 10 minutes, and it was perfect; not runny at all. I served this with the Honey Fruit Salad from this site, rounding out this delicious, light meal.

I love this recipe!  You can add variations to make it your own or follow it to a T and it will still be good.  I double the amount of crabmeat and add Old Bay to taste.  Some brands of crabmeat are more flavorful than others, so I find that I have to taste the crabmeat 1st before I decide how much Old Bay to put in (I'm a Baltimore girl at heart).  I haven't found the need to add a 3rd egg, but maybe I'll try it the next time to see if it makes a difference.  I let the pie set for 30 minutes after cooking and have never found it to be runny.

I was a bit apprehensive about the crab/swiss/quiche mixture.  My husband and I found this an amazing dish.  Reheated very well the next day.  I used a premade pie shell for ease, and used an additional egg also.  I'll be making this again for sure!

this turned out great. I also used 3 eggs and I used a frozen pie crust so I had to cook the first 10 minutes at 450 which was the best thing to do then I cooked for 50 minutes. I used prawns and can of crab cheddar cheese it was divine  thanks so much

First time I made this, and it's great! I was reading reviews and some people used 2 6oz cans of crab meat, but I still only used one 6oz can.  To add some flavor I added some red peppers and 1/2 tablespoon of hot sauce.  Instead of two eggs I used 3, and I used a cup of swiss and in addition I added half cup of sharp cheddar and it turned out wonderful!

I've fixed this so often for myself and friends, I can make it in my sleep.  Light tasting and flavorful.  I did add a dash of Old Bay, salt, white pepper and Dill Weed.  Everyone will think you're a chef and they still don't know where I got the recipe (hehehe). I have to keep my bragging rights.

This is an AWESOME dish!  I made a couple of changes: I used milk as the recipe called for (2%); but I also added some deveined salad shrimp, portabella mushrooms, thinly sliced white onions (instead of the scallions - I forgot to get them when I went to the store), 16 oz. of real lump crab meat, 1 tsp of Zatarains liquid crab boil and Old Bay Garlic and Herb Seasoning. It wasn't as colorful as the one in the picture 'cos pretty much all of the ingredients were light or white, but it was better even than I expected!

Just loved this quiche!  Added an extra egg, a dash of hot sauce, and some garlic, turned out perfect!  Can't wait for leftovers for lunch tomorrow (I made 2 pies just to be sure we had leftovers!)

It was okay. I listened to others and added the extra egg and two (6 oz.) cans of crabmeat. I added 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. old bay seasoning. I also added more cheese on the top about halfway through the baking as another person suggested. I also had to cook it longer than noted in the recipe. After adding all the extra stuff, it still wasn't enough flavor. I think the next time I try this, I'm going to have to add more seasoning to it.

Meh.  I used imitation crab, and that might have been a bit of the issue, but I don't think it could compensate for the dryness and blandness of this dish.  I can see why others add seasonings and an extra egg--that's a must.  I would also maybe add some garlic and onion, and definitely change out the swiss for a more flavorful cheese.

Great recipe with some minor adjustments.  I used 3 eggs, 1/2 c. mayo, 1/2 c. half and half, 2 tbsp flour, 12 oz. crab meat (jumbo lump mixed with claw meat), 1/2 c. shredded swiss, 1/2 c. parmasean, 1/2 c. green onion, 1/2 c. red bell pepper, 2 cloves garlic 1 1/2 tsp. Old Bay.  Bake for 50 min. and make sure the quiche top is brown before removing from oven.  Delicious!!!

This was incredibly easy to make and a perfect light dinner/brunch meal.I made changes suggested by some reviewers--I made with 3 eggs, 2 cans of drained lump crab, 1 tsp. Old Bay seasoning, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp. hot sauce and used swiss and gruyere cheeses and baked it for 55 minutes . We liked it, but my BF commented that he thought it needed something...next time, I'll try with cheddar and maybe a tad more of the spices...Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make, and very good!  I used two cans of lump crabmeat, and grated the swiss rather than dicing it.  The green onions were a nice touch, adding both color and flavor.  I baked this the night before for a potluck at work and served at room temperature.  Everybody liked it.

Like this recipe.  Only thing I changed was the 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup milk to a full cup cream. 
No disrespect to other reviewers (we are all entitled to our opinion)BUT Bay SEASONING in a delightful crab quiche NO-definitely not.  I used it once and it is really "NASTY"

This was pretty good - nice and creamy.  I made following the recipe except omitting the green onions.  It was a little floury.  Don't know if that comes from an inferior pie crust or the flour in the quiche.  It was a very good quiche, in any case.

Love this recipe.  I've been making this for a few years now and it always comes out perfectly.  The only modifications I make are to use 3 eggs, and also add some Frank's Red Hot and a little Old Bay to the mix.  I serve it with a roasted veg on the side.  So good.

I manipulated this recipe to: 1 egg & 3 egg whites, light mayo, and reduced fat swiss cheese.  This was good, but something's missing and I'm not sure what.  I will probably try a few more times.

Another excellent quiche recipe!  Also made this one for mothers day, I used 2 full cans of lump crab meat, old bay seasoning, two extra eggs and a monteray/cheddar cheese mix.  It got rave reviews from my family!  Definitely a keeper and one I will make again!

I took the previous advice and increased the eggs to 4, however, the Swiss cheese was horrible amd I only used 1/2 Swiss and 1/2 chedder.  The Swiss killed all of the crab flavor.  I will try this again, but I will only use chedder or some other type of cheese...no Swiss!  The texture was good...it looked pretty, but the Swiss cheese did not work.  I even increased the amount of crab used, but I couldn't taste it over the cheese.  I would recommend that someone try this, but adjust the recipe and cut out the Swiss cheese.

that's a good one! and pretty original too.I made the pastry shell myself, with flour, olive oil, salt and water, and the whole thing didn't take more than 10 min to prepare and 40 min to cook. And it turned out like I spent hours to get it togheter or I got it in a seafood shop!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Even my 5 year old loves it.  I did use sour cream instead of mayo.  For a really nice touch top it with some hollandaise sauce when serving.  Knorr make an excellent packaged hollandaise that is a zip to make.

Deelish! I wanted an easy recipe to demonstrate to my husband that fend-for-yourself-night (i.e., when I'm in class) doesn't always have to mean cold sandwiches or salads. I helped him make this last night, and not only was he was impressed by how easy it was, both of us thought the quiche looked and tasted great!  Thanks.

Easy to prepare and a big hit at the office.  I purchased frozen crab meat at about 1/2 the price.  It was suggested by the butcher and he said that the flavor and taste would be the same as purchasing the fresh alternative.  He was right!

This was pretty tasty, but it DOES need more spice.  I meant to add Tobasco and Old Bay, but I completely forgot (oops!) but I think it's JUST what this recipe is missing!!  I had to adjust the recipe using lower fat ingredients: replaced the mayo w/ fat-free plain yogurt, 3/4 cup egg substitute (which is equal to 3 eggs, per other reviewers suggestions), low-fat cheddar cheese (instead of swiss), and reduced fat crescent rolls as my crust.  This brought the fat down to 8 grams per serving, as opposed to almost 25 as stated by the original recipe.

This is a good basic quiche recipe. I used 3 eggs, reduced fat milk, a lot of black pepper, majoram, red chilli flakes, 2 cans of crab meat, and some broccoli. Didn't like the chunks of diced cheese so will probably grate the cheese next time.

This was amazing! I added a 3rd can of crab, subsituted swiss cheese with a mixture of gouda and munster and added old bay seasoning ( I also used eggbeaters). My boyfriend told me this was on the approved list from now on! I'm sure any cheese substitute would work, but make sure to season it well with salt and pepper. You could also do it without the crust to make a healthier quiche.

I made this twice, the first time with swiss cheese and imitation crabmeat, the second time with monteray jack and cheddar and 2 6 oz. cans of crabmeat. Wow! What a difference. I didn't care for the swiss and imitation my husband liked it so I decided to try it with the modifications. I really enjoyed this quiche the second time around. Very rich though so serve with something light.

I did not have crab meat, but I did have frozen imitation lobster delights, so I used the whole package (16 oz).  I had to improvise tonight, it was snowing hard, so I didnt want to go to the store, and I didnt have a pie crust, so I used a can of cresents rolled out to make a crust.  I used shredded cheddar and mozzarella.  For seasoning, I also used a little Mrs. Dash, some Louisiana hot sauce, garlic and salt.  Instead of flour, I used Italian bread crumbs for flavor.  Once I had it all poured in the pie pan,, it was a little dry because I didnt use the mayo.  So I whipped up two extra eggs with a little garlic powder and salt, and poured on top to cover.  It was wonderful!  My husband said it was very different and very delicious!!!

Nice recipe. I made some alterations though, I added a little bit more natural crab meat and shredded the cheese to even out the texture. Turned out just fine.

Turned out well for a 70's party I had.  Definitely follow some of the other reviewers' advice and add more spice, it's kinda bland as is even though I added garlic.

Easy, yummy recipe!  I added some extras - 3/4 cup chopped broccoli, 5 dashes of tobasco, pinch of minced garlic, and lots of black pepper.  I also used 1/2c each of shredded cheddar and shredded mozzerella instead of the swiss.

Great recipe!  I've made it several times.  People at work love it.  I've brought it for breakfast meetings several times.  One tip...make sure you test the center of the quiche with the 'clean knife test' before you remove it from the oven.  The recipe doubles nicely too.  I usually make two at a time.

I have used another recipe for crab quiche for years but wanted to try something different.  This recipe was delicious.  I think the mayonnaise made it very rich and flavorful.  I did use a 9" deep dish pie shell and would use an 8" regular one next time.

Used 5 eggs and whole grain flour with 2 cans of crab meat.  Excellent served alongside of garlic roasted cauliflower from this site. Nice Friday night dinner which I will certainly be repeating.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!

What a wonderful combination of flavours. I make quiches pretty regularly but this was my first time making a crab quiche. Yum. Because of what I had on hand I made a few adjustments that worked out really well. I used 3 eggs, 2 cups of flaked crab, replaced the milk with 15% cream, 1 cup three-cheese Italian blend with mozzarella, provolone and Parmesan, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, a few drops of Red Hot, 3 small green onions (ran short), the rest was the same. I made this crustless and cooked at 350 for 45 minutes. Turned out perfect with a beautiful colour. Thanks for the recipe and the tips about the extra egg and extra crab.

This recipe is a little heavy with cheese and filling. I would prefer a lighter recipe with more egg fluff. Otherwise, it's good.

Great recipe!!  I added an extra egg, used 2 cups of fresh lump crab, made sure I added 2 tbsp hot sauce and 2 tbsp old bay.  This dish was gone in record time.  2 pies wasn't enough.

Made this tonight exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.  I did have to bake it for 50 minutes, but all ovens are different.  Can't wait to make this for brunch the next time we have guests.

Very good recipe!  I followed others advice and upped it to 3 eggs as opposed to 2, doubled the crabmeat and used about a cup and half of shredded swiss.  Cooked for an hour to get it to fully set up.

After reading the reviews, I liked the bisquick idea. However, I am gluten free and used GF bisquick. Also added tomatoes, gr. peppers, and onion. The outcome was a bit too "cakey". I cut the biscuit recipe in half and the egg concoction soaked up into the biscuit mix. It was good but not how I planned! I rated it a 5 star b/c it was my idea to change the recipe from this original one.

I loved this quiche! But I used shredded mozzarella cheese in addition to cubed jarlsberg. It was delicious but next time I will add a half teaspoon of old bay and red pepper flakes just to give it some kick. I also suggest using another egg. If you follow the recipe without any adjustments it still comes out marvelous!

This was really good like others I used 3 eggs.  I also used greek yogurt instead of the mayo. I added 1tsp old bay 1/2 tsp garlic powder some onion powder (since Id didn't have that many green onions) and colby jack cheese and I used fake crab. It was really tasty

I made this for the first time today for my husband. I used 3 eggs, Old Bay Seasoning, the nutmeg and tabasco sauce.  I'm not sure what I did wrong but it didn't set up right after 45 minutes cook time.  My husband didn't like it as he felt 1/2 cup of green onions was too much.  He said the flavor was good, but too many onions and it was runny.

I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect. The only thing that I thought it lacked was a bit of salt but otherwise it was fantastic. Huge hit with a very picky hubby.

I have to say, I was a little cautious about this one.  I asked some coworkers if they ever tried a crab quiche, but none had.  The taste was so mild, yet wonderful.  Try this one, you won't be sorry.  Didn't have the green onions, so I used shallots, came out great.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe but my husband really liked it. I did modify the recipe quite a bit. I added Old Bay seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, and a dash of Tabasco. I also used really claw meat crab instead of the canned stuff. I don't think I will be making this again unless my husband request it.

I made this recipe and it was very good. I did use light mayo and it turned out perfect. No problems at all. Next time I'll add just a little bit of Old Bay but mainly because I'm a Marylander.

With the recommendations, this quiche turned out fantastic! We added the garlic and hot sauce, and substituted swiss for cheddar. We added an extra egg, and an extra can of crab. We baked it for a full hour, and even though the crust got a little dark, it turned out crumbly, buttery, and delicious!!!

I've been using this recipe forever, and I always get high compliments!  It's a lot of reward for such a little bit of work.  I use a little less onion, and I shred the cheese, but other than that, it's perfect!

Oh this was amazing! I made a few changes though, i did 3 eggs instead of 2 like everyone was saying to do, and i didn't have green onions or swiss cheese so i used yellow onions, some muenster (sp?) cheese and Kraft's Cracker Barrel Extra Sharp Cheddar. And i added a couple dashes of cayenne for a kick. EXCELLENT!

Very tasty! Used canned crab and made 8 individual small quiches...baked for 25 min at 350F. Didn't put any additional spices or Old Bay because it would haven taken away from the crab itself. Try it!

Modification: I added 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning and 1/2 tsp of Tabasco. To top it all off, I added a few slices of ripe tomatoes on the side and it was AWESOME!!! My husband was very skeptical about trying this kind of quiche but really enjoyed it.

This was pretty good. I did as other users suggested: added an extra egg, Old Bay seasoning(1 tsp), hot sauce (1/2 tsp), and fresh parsley.  However, I felt the recipe didn't need extra crab meat (used fresh crab) and definitely no extra salt!  We're not big swiss cheese fans, so we used 1/2 cup of mozarella and 1/2 cup of cheddar.  A very tasty quiche!

Delicious!  I brought this to a potluck at work and it got rave reviews all day long! I followed the advice in the other reviews and added 1/4 tsp of Old Bay, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, a extra egg, a few dashes of salt and pepper, and a deep dish pie crust. I also used 1/2 cup of swiss and 1/2 cup of mild cheddar cheese.  I topped it with that before putting in the oven.  After baking about 55 minutes, it looked and smelled good!  This one was a keeper and I can't wait to try it with turkey ham! Thanks for such a great EASY recipe.

I've made this 5 times, always the favorite. The only tweak, I add Old Bay Seasoning, and once added a small amount of gorgonzola (a big hit).

This was super easy to make and with some minor adjustments was fantastic tasting. I used the Sargento Artisan Blend Cheese: Wisconsin and Vermont Cheddar with Bacon (1 3/4 cup), 1 teaspoon hot sauce, 1 teaspoon old bay, 3 eggs, 2 cloves chopped garlic and 2 6oz cans Chicken of the Sea White crab meat. I did make mine with the pie crust. This really was a great way to start a long day :-)

I followed the suggestions to make this with 3 eggs instead of 2, added some garlic powder, used chopped fake crab (crab-flavoured pollock), swapped the swiss for extra-old cheddar and made this into 4 crustless individual quiches in Coquille St-Jacques dishes, baked for 30 minutes. They were EXCELLENT. I split one between my two kids, and both my youngest (who's not yet 2) and my husband (who normally hates quiche, but said he's willing to try anything I cook) shared the fourth one. His verdict: "I liked it because it tastes nothing like quiche." He must have had bad quiche in the past...

In any case, this is going right into the recipe box to make again. I'm going to try all kinds of variations. Yum!

This recipe was great! It was easy and fast and super yummy. I used imitation crab because it was cheaper and added extra of it. I also added a few more green onions. My family had it for dinner (my son LOVED it) and then I ate some of the leftovers for breakfast and it worked well for both times of the day.

I use this but make a few changes:
-skip the pie crust to make low carb!
-use 1 8oz can mushrooms drained
-skip scallions and use minced onion instead, just for convience b/c then I almost always have the ingredients on hand!

I doubled the recipe. 6 eggs. Spinach. Old Bay (about a tbsp. Salt & Pepper. About a tbsp of minced garlic.  Outstanding! No crust. Husband wants it at least twice a month now. He hates EVERYTHING! LOL. I'm not a very good cook. This was so quick and easy! 13x9 glass baking dish.

Great recipe, but don't use miracle whip.
I did that and did'nt like the taste at all. I also like to use pepper jack and cheddar cheese blend.

I didn't have swiss cheese so I used mozza on top and old cheddar in the mix. It was good, but I think it needed a little more flavor. Maybe the swiss cheese is what does it.

Wow, with some alterations this was delectable! Old Bay seaoning is a must, I couldnt imagie what it would have tasted like other wise. I sautted some regular onions with garlic, used 3 eggs, and added a mixture of cheeses. I didn't have a pie crust, but I had some pillsbury rolls that I baked and then placed on the bottom of the pan and around the sides. MMMM, it was gone before I turned around!

This was crazy easy.  I made it without a crust, but I think that it would really add the extra 'umph'.  Tasted good and was satisfying after a long day.

really east to put together. I used pepperjack cheese since it was what I had. I omitted the green onion and used dried minced onion. I also added some ground garlic & cumin. The crab I used was left over legs steamed with Old Bay. Great easy dish, hubby who hates crab had 2nds.

A huge hit at our baby shower! I was a little skeptical of putting crab and eggs together, but now I know why people do.  It was really delicious! I used canned claw meat--16 ounces for $15. The flavor was rich and unique. I made one in a frozen shell and one with the roll out crust found in the dairy section, and the latter tasted much better.

This recipe is EXCELLENT.  It was easy to make and tasted great.  I made it for an Easter brunch and it was a big hit.  I did as others suggested and used 3 eggs, 2 6oz. cans of crab meat, added a little salt/pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce.  It came out great.  Looking forward to making it again soon.

Excellent! Based on reviews, I made only a few changes: 3 eggs rather than 2, 1 1/2 c swiss instead of 1, and added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dash of tabasco.  THANKS for the great recipe!

This quiche is delicious.  My husband and I wanted to eat the whole pan.  I used two packages of lump crab meat...the kind you find by canned crab, tuna, sardines, etc.  It was so good.

This was one of the easiest and tastiest quiche recipes I have ever made.  Used imitation crab and a shredded swiss/gruyere  combo.  I made the night before. As a personal preference I might not use the pie crust next time.  Great reheated for breakfast the next morning too.

This was very yummy!  I made it tonight and couldn't be happier with the results!  I read the other reviews and used 3 eggs, old bay, tobasco, and green pepper and it was perfect!  This is definitely one I will make again!
Just an update..my fiance, who usually just says "very tasty" or "it's good" said WOW! when he ate this and wants me to make it often!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 1 whole egg & 4 egg whites, one vacuum-pack of starkist crab, twelve large shrimp chopped, and light swiss cheese. I also subbed 1/3 cup lowfat greek yogurt (which tastes like sour cream) for most of the mayo. Added 1/4 tsp. of old bay per other's reviews. I love it! I think I've seen this kind of quiche made with a little crumbled bacon. I don't miss it, but maybe that's what other reviewers are missing?

i thought it was great! a question, hwo do you make it without the crust? do you just put mix straight into a pie dish? also, i used canned instead of fresh (way too expensive!)and it was great. I also cut the mayo down a bit, and it was still good. i will definitely experiment with some veggies and seasonings.

I've made quiche quite often and was hesitant to try this - it didn't seem to have enough eggs or fat content (where's the cream?). However I followed the recipe exactly and was delighted! I think I will use this as the base for future quiches.

This was good, but not the best quiche I've had.  It may have been my fault.  I thought that the quiche was a little too delicate and needed more eggs.  I'll try this again with more eggs next time.

The succes of this quiche depends in large part on the brand of crab meat you buy. It was wonderful the first time we made it, but a little too strong the second time because I bought a different brand of crab meat. We left out the pie crust to lighten the fat a little, added some spinach and old bay seasoning as suggested by others, and substituted cheddar for swiss. We've made it several times now for guests at brunch, and our picky toddler even ate some of it too.

Amazing! This was incredibly delicious and easy. Rich and flavourful... I will make this again!

I had to substitute Monteray cheese for the Swiss because the local store was all out. And we used crab fresh off the boat... YUM!

I'm giving this five stars even tho I subbed leftover 1/2&1/2 for the milk and it turned out too tight a texture. Next time I'll use milk to loosen it and will also add peppers and Tabasco and Old Bay. It tasted GREAT!!!

This was great!  I had crab legs so I shelled them and used the fresh meat. I added sauted green and red pepper, a dash of salt, pepper and tabasco as some other reviewers suggested.  I also used 4 eggs and substituted some cheddar as I did not have enough swiss.  I guess I overdid it since by the time I was done with all of my additions I had enough for 2 quiches.  Luckily I had 2 shells so I gave the second one to my very appreciative parents who thouroughly enjoyed it.  Fantastic!!

I used the horseradish and wasbi flavored mayo for an extra kick.  I also put a layer of shredded swiss on top for an extra little crust.  My fiance an I ate it in two sittings.  Thanks!!

Served this recipe as an alternative to the usual crab cakes and crab soup.  My hubby and 3 y.o daughter loved it!  I did use 1 pound of crab meat for a heartier taste, cheddar instead of swiss cheese, and some Old Bay seasoning.  Will make again!

I made the for dinner last night and invited another couple. We all enjoyed it soooo much that there where NO leftovers and this is a recipe for 8 and there where on 4 of us. As suggested by other reviews, I increased the eggs to 4. I also added a pound of crab meat, 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning and about a 1/2 cup more of swiss cheese. 
For an added touch, I made a packaged Hollandaise Sauce and pour a littler over each serving. This added a delicate and delicious flavor besides it also look attractive. Serve this with a salad of choice and you've got a quick, easy, and light dinner.

Very easy to prepare. Used fake crab meat and reduced the amount of the mayonnaise a bit. Also, sprinkled some shredded parmesan cheese on top before baking. Great for a brunch or shower.

Pretty tasty! I used refrigerated croissant dough cut into squares for the crust and put the mix into the crusts in muffin tins. I also added quite a bit of Old Bay seasoning. It needs a little more spice. I'll make it again!

This is the best quiche recipe.  In the past, I have never had success making quiche.  This recipe came out perfect.  I think the mayo is the key ingredient. It gives it the perfect texture.  My boyfriend loved it also.  I substituted regular onions instead of green onions.

Easy and delicious.  I took this to work and it was gone in 5 minutes.  I made a second one for a low-carb dieter and he couldn't thank me enought.  Here is how:  I added another egg, 1 extra tsp. four, a little pepper and dash of garlic powder.  Sprayed the pie pan with non-stick spray and didn't use a pie crust.  Cook until set and serve on lettuce.  GREAT RECIPE!

I needed to cook mine a little longer than the recipe said in order to get it hot all the way through.  Other than that, the recipe was easy and delicious.

I made this quiche this morning after reading all the wonderful reviews. My husband and I both enjoyed it. But I thought something was missing, I saw that someone added some hot sauce and maybe that is what it needed for me also. I served it with fruit and a tossed salad. It was easy and looked very nice. Thanks for the reviews and the recipe.

This is the first time I've tried making a quiche, and all things considered, it was a pretty good dish.  We had also made pasta that same meal, so the dinner ended up being a bit on the heavy side.  But that had nothing to do with this recipe, per se.  I made the pie crust from scratch instead of using a pre-made one.  That turned out well, although a bit too flaky for a quiche crust.  I also added in brocolli and fresh red peppers.  The sweet red peppers gave the quiche a nice colour and was quite nice to the eyes.  All in all it was a good recipe. I'd like to try it again with a different recipe using more eggs and see if there is much of a difference.  As it was, it was really eggy.  But good nevertheless.

It isn't really fair to call this a quiche, since it doesn't have enough eggs or milk/cream to qualitfy.  It didn't taste particularly quiche-like either, which is too bad since I love quiche.  I was disappointed in the flavor and texture.  I used 1 1/2 cups of cheese, but ai couldn't really taste the cheese.  I will not make this again.

I bought the ingredients I was missing, and when I got home I thought "only TWO eggs, in a 9-inch shell?"  But I made it and it was GREAT.  Very easy, very tasty.  I used imitation crab meat and I used 1 1/4 cup shredded swiss cheese because the bag came in that size and I didn't have any use for the extra.  I didn't measure the crab nor the green onions, just tossed everything in and it came out nicely.  The most time consuming part for me was chopping a few green onions and the rest was just throwing it in a bowl and mixing it.  VERY easy and delicious.  I served it for dinner with steamed fresh young whole green beans.

Really easy to do - but the choice of cheese can overwhelm the taste of the crab if you're not careful!

Easy and delicious.  I used 2 cups of crabmeat and didn't change the amount of any of the other ingredients, and it still turned out great- very forgiving!

Yummy! I also added half an avocado, which I don’t recommend because it turned kind of mushy! Very rich, make sure to serve something bland with it so it doesn’t steal the show!

Good, basic, easy crab quiche recipe.  Added a third egg. Substituted 1 cup low-fat, small curd cottage cheese for milk and 1/4 cup of the mayo (I beat the living daylights out of the first mixture to make sure there would be no curds in the final product).    Used 2 six-ounce cans of crab meat.  Added a small jar of pimentos for more color.  Seasoned with Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning (which would make dirt taste great).   If you're an experienced cook, you can change and add to this recipe a lot.  I just use what needs to be used out of my fridge.

Excellent base recipe for quiche.  I added chopped shrimp to the crab meat.  Definitely will make again but with different ingredients added to base recipe.  Cajun sausage with roasted red peppers and hoop cheese anyone?

I read several of the reviews before I made this.  I thought that the suggestion of using 3 eggs made sense so I did that and it turned out beautifully! I set up and was done after baking 35 minutes. Anyone who truly loves crab knows that it is a pretty delicate flavor and can easily be over powered.  If you are seeking the flavor of seasonings and not the crab then add all kinds of stuff.  This recipe is pretty great but instead of adding more flavoring agents, I am reducing the green onion to 2 tablespoons. I think the next time I make it I will up the amount of crab to at least 8 oz.   I used 6 oz like the recipe said , but I think for crab would be delightful.  I asked my husband for his opinion and he said “It’s good

This was amazing with my homemade pie crust made with butter. I used one can of Trader Joes's crab which after drained I believe was less than one cup. I didn't have green onions so I substituted Jalapeno (no seeds) and red and yellow peppers finely diced. I sprinkled with smoked paprika before I placed the quiche in the oven. I will make this again!!

I have been making this for 13 years now and it is nothing short of amazing! The only two things I do differently are adding a 16oz. can of lump crab meat instead of an 8 oz. can and I cook it for 1 hour. Delicious!!!!!

Basic but good flavor. I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss, and imitation crab meat. Baked at precisely 45 minutes and it came out perfect. Next time, however, I'll be experimenting with some of the recommendations by other reviewers to kick up the flavor.

I had fresh crabmeat and went on search for a recipe, then found this one. I read dozens of reviews and used a lot of the suggestions. Hot sauce, crushed red pepper, shredded Mexican cheese, and I substituted sour cream for  mayonnaise. It took an additional 15 minutes to cook through and is the most delicious car quiche

I ran across this recipe while looking for something different to cook besides chicken, pork, and beef! It was awesome...one of the best quiches I've ever made and/or eaten. 
I did modify a bit: 3 eggs instead of 2, evaporated milk, 2 T. sour cream, fresh garlic, 1 t. Old Bay seasoning, 1/2 c. shredded parmesan, and 1/2 c. Swiss cheese instead of 1 c. I sprinkled the top with more Old Bay. After 40 min. in the oven, I added more shredded parmesan over the top!
This is definitely a keeper as well as a holiday party recipe!

Super easy! I am allergic to crab so I used Surimi. The only modifications were I added about 2 tbl of smoked Gruyere and 1 tsp of old bay seasoning to it.  It is so yummy. Thank you!

Really enjoyed this!  I made it as written using two cans of crab and was afraid it might be bland due to lack of spices, but it was so good!  I'm not a big fan of Swiss cheese, but it went perfectly with the crab.   Hubby loved it too.   Will make again, thanks for sharing!

This was my first time making a quiche and this one was both easy and delicious! Based on other reviews I used three eggs instead of two. Also used shredded cheese and light mayo and had no problems. After baking I switched the oven to low broil for a few minutes to let the quiche brown a little on top. It was excellent!

Really good! Tastes best piping hot out of the oven, yum. It definitely needs the kick of cayenne or hot sauce, and I'm thinking it might be good with a few squeezes of lemon juice as well.

This was my first quiche and it was fantastic!! I did add some old bay (you just HAVE to add that to seafood!!) and a frozen pie crust. Soooo yummy! I will be making this on a regular occasion. Thank you!

I doubled this and made 2 because we have a big family. The kids complained about the swiss cheese so I made 1 exactly as the recipe says and the other I made with half swiss and half cheddar and left out the onions. Both were delicious, the kids are asking for this again already!

Some in my family thought the crab taste was too strong.  I did at first, but really enjoyed it the next day.  I took others' advice and doubled the crab.  Next time I will try it as written.

The texture of this dish was nice but the taste was too bland, even for a quiche.  If I were to make it again, I would add a dash of salt to enhance the flavors. Also, the dish didn't showcase the flavor of the crab as much as I had hoped for.

I felt this recipe should have more egg in it. I added a little bit more crab than it called for and I think that was the right call. Being from MD, I had to add some Old Bay to spice it up a little. Overall, an excellent easy recipe.

I give it 4 stars because my husband and I have very different impressions of this; he didn't care for it and I absolutely love it. To him the egg & crab didn't meld well with the seasonings, I thought the flavors popped nicely.

ALMOST five stars. Although the quiche turned out to be very fluffy, smooth, and pretty tasty anyhow, it definitely needed a bit more flavor, and I wished I had some hot sauce on hand. I substituted cheddar cheese for swiss, diced yellow onions for green, and (as recommended) added an extra egg and a tablespoon of garlic powder. Don't skimp on pepper - I was afraid my guests would be overpowered by it, but it was nowhere close to enough.

It was a hit at the river house and at work. My husband doesn't like quiche, but he ate this one up. Followed the advise on some of the other reviews and put 3 eggs, 2 6oz cans of crab,2-3 cloves of garlic, hot sauce, cayenne to taste. But I neede my veggies, so I shredded zuccini which my husband could hardly tell, and a little of the old bay seasoning. We couln't gobble it up fast enough. I made 2 of them, and shared and everyone wanted the recipe.Marcie

This actually turned out really well.  I added the extra egg, as suggested by many reviewers, but instead of using regular mayo, I substituted it for Wasabi Mayo.  It gave the quiche a delicious little extra kick.

I didn't really care for this. Added 1 extra egg as many other reviewers did. If you like crabcakes you will probably like this, if you don't than you probably won't like this since it is very similar in texture to a crabcake. I did have to cook around an hour until it was done.

This quiche was a huge hit at my house! It seemed to disappear before I could turn around twice! I used lump crab meat from a local restaurant and followed the directions exactly. You're definitely paying a little more for good quality crab meat, but it is WELL WORTH IT! Excellent recipe!

This was delicious! It also took me over an hour to cook. I think the only change I would make next time is a little less onion and little more crab meat. Very good though!!!

This was so good.  Everyone at the party actually thought I could cook, even tho my husband I knew that wasn't the case, lol.  It really was good.  Everything just blended together to make the best quiche.  I agree with some of the others,  I wouldn't use canned crab again, only the fresh stuff, it makes an unbelievable difference. also, I added an egg, and extra cheese.  The cooking time definitely isn't long enough.  Over all tho, it is a GREAT recipe.

this dish was very tasty! made several changes. took everyone's advice and added an extra egg. i also added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, and 1/4 tsp garlic powder. felt like it needed some veggies too so i added 1/2 cup onion and 1/2 cup green bell peppers and some fresh parsley. bf liked it, but thought that it could use a little bit more flavor. he gave it a 7/10. i was pretty satisfied with it though. will probably make again, but next time i'll use less mayo or maybe substitute it for sour cream.

Fantastic. I did not have swiss cheese, used sharp cheddar instead. Worked out just superb. I will definately make this again and again. I could see where the swiss cheese would give this a nice twang, so I will go that route next time. LOVED IT !!

Fabulous... I've made this two weekends in a row and it's great when spiced up a bit (garlic, hot sauce & green onion).  Need to start making at least 2 at a time to ensure everyone has their fill!

The crab makes this very rich.  I think I prefer a quiche lorraine.

I thought this was very good.  My husband doesn't like Quiche but he made it for me tonight just for me and we both loved it.  He made it exactly like the recipe because he wasn't sure it would turn out.  He said next time he will try one more egg and a little kick of some spice.  Very good just as written too~~

Excellent! Comes out perfect every time I make this. I use 3 eggs instead of 2, green onions, garlic powder, old bay and the rest is history. We love this recipe! Looks beautiful too!

This is an easy recipe with many potential substitutions.  I made this verbatum the first time, next time I added 1 T dry mustard and garlic powder.  Yesterday we were snowed in and I didn't have green onions or crab but I  had cubed ham and used that and carmelized a yellow onion---a carmelized onion really adds amazing flavor but would probably overpower crab.  Great with ham@

There's way too much mayo and overpowered the crab.  Next time I think I will omit the mayo altogether.

I never even ate quiche before so I had very little expectations for dinner last night...but this crab quiche was to die for.  I made 2 just in case it came out good....and we were all fighting for the crumbs of the first one last night. It was simple yet DEEEElicious!  I will be making it a lot more in the future, and may try and make mini-quiches if I can find the mini unbaked pie shells.  You really need to try it...very creamy and smooth!

Recipe was simple to do and easy to follow. After reading other reviews I did add a bit more Swiss cheese and a few dashes of Tabasco. I made this for a special occasion date. It got raves from him and scored me some pretty big points!!! I made another one for my son and he could not get enough of it. I will be making this again.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed it almost to the tee (I added 1 more egg).  It didn't taste as good leftover though, so I would recommend chowing down the first night.

This was a very good quiche.  I did add an extra egg and some extra swiss.  I also added some bay seasoning and that really tasted good.  Next time I may use some fresh crab meat with a dash of lemon juice - I used can crab and it was a tad fishy tasting.

Very good.  I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Next time though I think I will add at least one more egg.  My pie dish didn't seem "full" so I think this will solve the problem.

Very very yummy!! I used Miracle Whip b/c that's what I had on hand and everybody LOVED this one! Super easy to make although it seemed to need about 10 more min's cooking then what was required.

Added an extra egg as several reviewers suggested as well as my own favorite seasonings:  garlic salt, paprika, chili powder.  Threw in a bit of chili sauce too.  This turned out ok but not spectacular and it took 10 min. longer than recipe says to cook.  DO NOT DICE THE SWISS - that was the biggest mistake I made in the recipe.  Shredding would create a much better texture.  I made a simple crust (whisk 1/4 cup ice water + 1/4 cup canola oil, then add 1/2 tsp salt + 1 cup flour) that complemented the quiche perfectly.  Much cheaper than store bought and really easy and quick!

Yummy!  My husband is not always a fan of quiche.  We have both had a few that were very eggy and watery, but not this one.  It was firm and tasted delicious.  I almost followed the recipe exactly as written except for a few tiny changes--used 3 eggs, used 1/4 c. mayo + 1/4 c. plain lowfat yogurt (to lower the fat a bit) and one 4oz can of white crab meat (it was about a half cup of crab--we are on a tighter grocery budget, so I was trying to cut back on the cost of the recipe).  It was still wonderful with only one cup of crab.  I will definitely save the recipe!

I along with other rates suggest adding another egg.  I also added garlic and some cajun spice.  It was super yummy!

This was great.  I used canned crab and followed others advice by adding some green and red pepper, an extra egg (eggbeaters), one tablespoon old bay and a little extra crab.  I will make this again.

I added more crab like many of the reviewers suggested but I found the crab flavor overpowered the delicate egg flavor I love so much about this dish. When I make it again, I'll stick to the recommended amount and I think it'll be a *****!

Very tasty, very easy-to-make recipe. I used real crab meat, from some leftover crab legs I had on hand. The only thing I changed about the original recipe was doubled the amount of Swiss cheese. The whole family loved it. Thanks for sharing :)

I've made this twice now.  The first time I had leftover crab from a crab salad and made it just to use the crab.  Saved it to the next morning for breakfast and WOW!  It was so good.  My daughter loved this.  This time I bought crab just to make this quiche and served it to 12 women along with other items and they too LOVED it.  Asked for the recipe - always a good sign.  I used vidalia onions as I didnt' have green onions either time and also used a bit of parsley just for the green color really.  Bought the crust ready made.  Easy and oh so good.

This scored a '9.2' with my husband, and he's a tough sell!!  I used blue crab back fin, a little dijon, old bay & garlic for seasoning.  Mixed up the cheese a little; 3/4 swiss, 1/4 cheddar jack & monterey.  I excluded the onions & tossed in a little spinach to get some color and it came out spectacular!  We'll definitely make it again soon!

I changed the recipe a little, using half parmesan, half swiss cheese.  And I didn't have Old Bay seasoning as some recommended, so I used a cajun mix instead.  Overall, it came out alright.  I might make it again, but I don't know if I'm crazy about the crab in the quiche.  The recipe is fine, I'm just not sure it's to my taste.

My hubby is very pciky but loved this quiche! My kids liked it too.  I used two small cans of canned crab and served this with a salad.  Quick and easy to throw together.  I make this the night before and heat it up the next day for dinner.

This did not have a good taste. Normally I like quiche and thought this would be differnt and good. Different it was. I did not have green onion, but I don't think that would have helped the flavor much. It was a pretty dish only.

Awesome!  I do use variations of different cheeses, my husband is not a swiss cheese fan, and it still come out perfect.  Baby scallops and shrimp also make it delightful if you prefer a medley of seafood.  I would definitely used fresh crab, don't try it with canned!  Canned makes it meely.

I made this last night for a trial run for a shower I'm throwing.  I'm glad I tried it first.  I made some changes, per other's suggestions.  I added garlic, Old Bay, salt & peppar, used 3 eggs.  And I used top quality fresh crab meat.  But I just didn't like it.  I can't quite put my finger on it, it just didn't work.  My husband, on the other hand, did like it so thankfully he'll eat the leftovers and we won't have to waste all of that expensive crab!

This is an excellent recipe... Very easy to make, looks and tastes wonderful. I love the idea that someone suggested to adding some tobasco to it for some extra kick... I'll probably try adding some the next time I make it. Yum!

What a wonderfully easy and yummy recipe! I made it at the last moment for a luncheon and it turned out perfect! I added cheddar cheese to mine and since I did not have green onions, I sprinkled some fresh chives on top. It turned out beautiful and everyone said it was awesome. Even my 19 month old son ate 3 pieces! I will be using this recipe again and again. Thanks!!!

Very good! Like a few other reviewers, I added some old bay seasoning and used crossient dough instead of pie crust. I also used immitation crab... YUMMY. I plan to make this again and again. What a good use for only two eggs!

This did not taste good to anyone who ate it.  It was the first time I ever ate Quiche.  Maybe, I would not like any kind of quiche.  I don't about it?

This is excellent and easy!  I used 3 eggs, added a can of shrimp and baked the pie crust about 3 min. before putting in ingredients. Thanks!

Very good-easy to make and everyone loved it! I would maybe add more crab next time, we couldn't really taste it. I added some salt and pepper as well! Otherwise, it was very cheesy and delicious!

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it! SO TASTY!!! I used real white crab meat. The kind that comes in cans. You can find them in the section with the tuna cans. They are the same price as the imitation crab meat. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This was wonderful.  I think it would be good with or without the crust.  I made it with the crust in a removable bottom quiche pan; it was pretty as well as easy.  My family loved it and I will definately make this recipe again.

This is very good.  I made a few changes to help cut the fat.  I used light mayo, egg substitute and fat free half & half for the milk.  I also used regular onion since I didn't have any green onions on hand.  It was delicious even with the low fat substitutions I made.

I needed something quick to make for my husband for breakfast and this did the trick.  I made a couple of modifications to the recipe to fit my husband's low carb diet.  I made this crustless, added an extra egg and used whipping cream in place of the milk.  I sprayed the pie pan before adding the ingredients.  I also used this as an opportunity to use up the bits of cheese that were in the frig, swiss, mozzarella and mexican.  I added cayenne and fresh ground black pepper for added flavor, dried minced onion and imitation crab.  I then baked it in the microwave and finished it off under the broiler to give it a nice color.  My husband loved it.

I used both canned crab and mini shrimp and also added pepper after reading the other reviews.  I thought this was a little bland, it needing a kick to it.  I doubt if I will make this again.

Was very good!  Used egg beaters instead of eggs.  Increased amount to the equivalent of 3 eggs.  Added pepper for more spice.  Very good!

Outstanding!  I was hoping it would taste good considering it was so easy to make - it did!  Served it alongside a fresh salad with Italian dressing.  The tartness of the dressing complemented the quiche very well.  I used 3/4 pound imitation crab meat instead of the canned crabmeat.  It was much less expensive and worked very well.  Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was easy as can be.  And it tasted absolutely wonderful even with imitation crab meat.  My husband really loved it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This quiche was so fast and so delicious! I used two 6 oz. cans of lump crab meat instead of the imitation stuff. It was excellent, and tasted more like hot crab dip than a quiche. You can hardly taste the eggs!

My partner and I definitely believe this one’s a keeper.  It was great.  I used a 6 oz can of crab.  Next time I’m going to try it with two 6 oz cans.

While this recipe is very easy, it cries out for some sort of seasoning.,,at least salt and pepper. There is none listed in the recipe.  Otherwise it is very bland

So easy, even my roommate could mix the ingrediaents while I made the pie shell.
A must for brunches, an excellent choice to bring to dinner parties.
