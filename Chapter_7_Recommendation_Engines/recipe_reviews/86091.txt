These were great, if you can't find the Thai seasoning then don't make it.  It adds the extra zing that cinnamon can't.  You can find it in an Asian store or if your lucky like we our we have an ethnic store that sells just about anything you could want.  Thanks for the post.

This receipe is so easy and so yummy, I highly recommend it. It has a slight cinammon flavor to it. The Thai seasoning is somewhat hard to find in the grocery stores, so you may seek it out in a specialty or Asian store. I served it as an appetizer prior to a Thai-peanut-pasta entree. Worked well. Served with toasted bread, and was excellent even after it cooled to room temp.

Didn't have any Thai seasoning so I left it out. Did add a little bit of cinnamon based on the other review. Thinking it needed just a little something else.

Very easy tasty way to serve mushrooms. I added a little more Thai sauce because I like extra heat, more than acceptable with out it.

These were really tasty and super easy to make! I added an chopped onion and freshly minced cloves of garlic. I did not have thai seasoning so I found some seasonings and added a bit to the mixture (I don't know what ethnicity it ended up turning out...)But it was really good!

These were very good with crackers. I added some fresh, chopped cilantro once they had cooled a little and it added a really nice flavor (and color!).

I served this with sesame rice crackers at an asian themed party. I had a few people ask for the recipe, and I liked it myself.

Used Chinese hot oil instead of the Thai seasoning and oil.  Delicious!
