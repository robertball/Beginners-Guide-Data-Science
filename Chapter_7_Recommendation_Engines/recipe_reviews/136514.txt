I made this for a brunch and everyone loved it.  I used apricot nectar since I couldn't find apricot-mango, but followed the rest of the recipe.  I like this recipe better than the traditional orange juice-champagne combination.  I has more flavor.  I used a cheap bottle of champagne ($5.99 a bottle) but no one noticed.  I put a couple of fresh raspberries in the bottom of the glasses before adding the juice and champagne.  It looked beautiful!

I served this at a Mother's Day brunch. I used half a can of mango nectar & half a can of apricot nectar & I didn't add the champagne to the mix so that I could add ginger ale to the grandkids' glasses ( they thought they were IT, drinking out of champagne flutes. ;o) )....I added champagne to the grown-ups'.   These were much better than the typical mimosa...thank you!

I have to say, I was a little hesitant in trying this because it didn't have any reviews yet, but I'm glad I did. I made it for my Bunco group, since the dinner theme was "Easter Brunch."  I doubled the recipe for 12 women, and it was almost all gone!  I used apricot nectar instead of apricot-mango (my mistake, but it was still good).  I also made a frozen ring in a bundt pan out of strawberries, pineapple and oj.  Be sure to stir the punch after you add the champage, so that the flavors meld.  Everyone said it had a nice flavor and wasn't too strong.

Wow, I love mimosas and the additional juices were very complimentary.  I changed the ratios slightly based on what I had though.  I used a can of apricot juice, a can of mango juice, a can of pineapple juice, and about a cup and a half of orange juice.  I then filled everyone's glasses halfway with champagne and filled the rest of the way with the juice concoction....delicious!

I quadrupled the recipe for all the juices and made in one pitcher, then let everyone add their own champagne. Float a few raspberries in the glass and this was a hit!!!!

this recipe went over wonderful at an outdoor bridal shower that I did.  Everyone drank more of this than the lemonade or water.  And the crowd was not a bunch of drinkers.  I added a frozen strawberry ice ring to keep it cool and as it melted the strawberries were a nice addition to the drink.

This mimosa was the hit of my Mother's Day bash!  I couldn't find the ingredients exactly, though, so mine was a little different.  I used pineapple/mango juice, frozen oj, and champagne.  I also made a frozen ring out of the pineapple/mango juice, cut up strawberries and kiwis.  Everyone loved it!

FABULOUS drink! I used a half a can of apricot nectar, half a can of mango nectar & 1 can frozen orange/pineapple juice. In the future I will double everything. Very well received by my brunch guests. This will definitely be a regular!

I made this for New Years Eve and it was wonderful.  I didn't use oj concentrate because I got confused between two punches I was making and used a cup of regular oj instead.  It was still great - I wound up making a second batch.  Will definately make this again.

I served this at a July 4th Brunch and everyone raved about how good it was. Like most of the reviewers, I could not find the Apricot-Mango nectar but was able to find a bottle of Apricot Nectar and a bottle of Mango Nectar at my local grocery store, so I mixed the two but found that it needed a little more Mango Nectar than Apricot. I also added a couple shots of Orange Liqueur (Grand Marnier) to take something that's 'over the top' to 'out of this world'  I also froze a batch without the alcohol in an ice tray and used the cubes to keep the pitcher cold without diluting it.

Serves 15? Are you kidding me?? No way! Unless most of the people present hate one of the ingredients.  I had five for brunch and we drank the whole thing - it was fabulous!  Didn't do anything different, tho my juice combos were a bit switched around just because of what I could find in the store.  By the way, I found the juices (for example, apricot nectar and pineapple/mango) in the Hispanic section.  Floated fruit in the first glass and it looked beautiful; after that, nobody cared. :)  This is so much more flavorful than regular mimosas - try it, you'll love it!

I made a non-alcoholic version of this for a baby shower, and people raved! Instead of the champagne, I used half club soda (wanted to cut back on the sweetness) and half sparkling grape juice. Definitely a keeper, both as an 'adult beverage' and a pregnancy-friendly version. Thanks for sharing!

Oh my my!!  Really great!  I ended up making this into a frozen drink, and found myself chained to my Vita-Mix for the rest of the night, making more and more because of the demand.  Next time, I'll plan ahead and make this in a five-gallon bucket and freeze it in my freezer like those freezer margaritas in a tub.

Family came out for dinner and fireworks.  Served mimosas and all loved the flavor.   Very refreshing drink.  For those that cannot find the apricot mango juice, we found it in the organic section of our store - Santa Cruz brand.

I used all Trader Joe's brand for this ingredient list.  The only thing different that I did was using an all mango nectar drink since Trader Joe's didn't have that combination.  I also bought an extra dry champagne from their wine store.  It still turned out to be a hit for our Sunday brunch!  Even the "beer guys" liked it and drank more than 1 serving.  I'm sure my friends would ask me to make it again.

This was very good! Like a lot of others, I had to use what juices I could find but it's so forgiving, just about anything goes. About people giving "kiddie [alcoholic] cocktails" to children, if you re-read the reviews, I think you will find that they used ginger ale or sparkling grape juice for the young ones.

This recipe is very tasty. BUT, no wonder we have an alcohol problem with children. Who (another poster) would make "kiddie cocktails" out of any adult drink so kids would think they were drinking alcohol???

I made this today for our Mothers Day lunch and it was a big hit with everyone. I made a separate pitcher for the non-drinkers and used club soda.I also added lots of ice so as it would be very cold and it's really refreshing.

I went crazy trying to find apricot-mango.  I still can't find it, even in the Mexican isle and even in a import grocery store.  Anyway, you can really just use any juice.  I used a can of apricot and a can of pineapple and it tasted great still.  For the champagne, I used the inexpensive Andre Extra Dry for $5 at my grocery store and it was perfect.

This turned out great, despite using very cheap, sparkling wine, & changing apricot-mango to plain apricot, & pineapple to guava. Added ice and plain OJ. Fixed in blender enough for 2 servings. I'm drinking now while working on some x-mas snacks & it is very tasty. Great recipe!

Made a pitcher of this on Christmas.  As most reviewers commented, could not find the combo of apricot/mango nectar, so purchased 2 cans of Kern nectar and a bottle of mango nectar (from Trader Joes).  We doubled the recipe (wo/champagne)- and set it out for either kids to enjoy alone or adults w/champagne or vodka- wish we had made more!  It was all gone before the guests were gone!

Just made this today and it was soo good!   I couldn't find 12 oz cans of nectar or pineapple juice so I used a 9.5 oz can of apricot nectar and (2) 9.5 oz cans of pineapple juice plus 1 cup of water and the oj per the recipe.    Think next time I might add some triple sec.

This was VERY good. I couldn't find Apricot-Mango nectar, so used 1/2 Apricot nectar and 1/2 Mango nectar. Everyone loved it!

We tried this one for our Christmas Dinner.  I  had to substitute mango nector for the apricot-mango nector but we loved it.  We will be using it again next year.

Nice little addition to our Thanksgiving Brunch.  I couldnt find the apricot-mango so one batch we used just mango and then the next batch we used a strawberry/banana/mango.  Thanks for sharing!

Served this at a wedding shower (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions).  Everyone loved it and came back for seconds (and thirds).  I used apricot nector since I could not find the other variation.

I thought it was just okay.  I think it had too much juice.   I think next time I will have more of the champagne and less of the juice.

If I cannot find the apricot-mango nectar I just use 6 ounces of apricot nectar and 6 ounces of mango nectar which are easily found in the Goya section of the grocery store. I use a good asti since I am not a fan of dry champagne and it comes out perfect. There is never any mimosa discarded down the drain!

Love these.  Just a slight variation on a mimosa or Bellini for a crowd.  I make several batches of this each year for my Christmas cookie swap and any brunches I do through the year.  It is always a big hit.

This was good, but in no way made 15 servings. Plan on doubling the recipe. Thanks to the previous reviewer who suggested looking in the Hispanic food aisle for the mango nectar.

Great!  I couldn't find Apricot nectar, so I used peach juice.  I also added two bottles of champagne to stretch out the servings, and boy, did it pack a punch.  It was a huge hit!

What a wonderful mimosa!  I didn't add water, but didn't miss it.  I used dry champagne because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  I also only had apricot juice on hand and it was delicious.  Next time, I will try mango.

I gave 4 stars since I didn't make the original and can't say for sure, but the variation I made was the same jist and was totally 5 stars. 12 oz Pineapple Juice, 12 oz can of Apricot Nectar, 16 oz. of Orange Juice, Mixed with a bottle of chilled dry Champagne. I gave people the option of adding a Shot of Grand Marnier if they wanted - Awesomely Delicious!

This was great. I made a Bellini bar and had this in a pitcher with bottles of prosecco for guests to make their own Bellini. Went over really great. Everyone loved it. Chef at French restaurant asked me for recipe. I couldn't find the mango apricot so I used peach nectar, mango nectar, pineapple juice and concentrated oj. No water. I put frozen strawberries in the pitcher to keep it cold.

This is soooo good.  I decided to try this b/c it called for more ingredients than just the typical champagne and OJ. I didn't find mango/apricot nectar so I just used mango nectar.  It was so so good.  I will def make again!

OK, maybe I shouldn't rate this since I changed a few things, but I have a feeling it would be great either way. I couldn't find apricot-mango nectar, so I used mango-peach instead. And I totally forgot the orange juice. But it was really good anyway. I made it for my friend's bridal shower and it was a hit.

I made these last night for a girls' night in I had with two of my friends.  I made them exactly as the recipe says except had to use 6 oz. mango nectar & 6 oz. apricot nectar since I didn't have the combo.  They were a huge hit, and we will definitely make them again.  I will also try this with ginger ale instead of champagne for punch at showers in the future.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Excellent drink.  The adults loved it with champagne and the kids loved it with sparkling grape juice.  I am making it again for New Year's Eve.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good - sweeter than the traditional mimosa but also smoother and easier on the stomach.

I made this for a party, and my guests loved it.  Since I could not find apricot-mango nectar, I used a 12 oz. can of pure mango nectar and then a 12 oz. can of pineapple-passion fruit nectar.  I would love to try it with apricot another time because I think that would add a different level of sweetness.

This recipe was a wonderful mix of fruity flavors that were not too sweet.  I had been looking for a use for a bottle of champagne that was way too "brut" or dry for my taste and this worked perfecly.  My friends were asking for the recipe all night!

This recipe was great with our breakfast casserole!  I always thought a mimosa was just OJ + champagne, so when I read this, it peaked my interest.  Unfortunately, my grocery store didn't have the apricot-mango nector.  Fortunately, I found Mango Pineapple juice, so I used 24 ounces of that, and it tasted great!  I also read that a reviewer put raspberries in hers, so I plopped 2 raspberries in each of my crystal glasses...it was pretty. :)  I will definitely make this again when I want to have a fancy breakfast!

This was yummy for Mother's Day brunch today.  Used 1 can (12oz) each Jumex brand Apricot nectar and Mango nectar, along with the Pineapple and OJ concentrate.  Mixed that up in a pitcher and filled flutes halfway up and then added Asti Spumanti or Sprite for each person.  Served 8 and they wish they had more!

I couldn't find apricot-mango nectar so I just used apricot nectar.  Great with champagne or ginger ale for the kids and non-drinkers. I made a pitcher of the juice and then poured mimosas to order instead of pouring the champagne directly into the pitcher of juice.

I made this mimosa for a brunch and everyone LOVED it! I found the apricot nectar and mango nectar at Wal-Mart in the juice aisle. I have also found them in Mexican specialty grocery stores. Some reviewers had a hard time finding the nectars.  The nectars were not expensive and they helped to give this recipe the “wow factor.” I made this recipe as is and made another batch because my guests were asking for more.  The ingredients are easy to keep on hand and if you make this at your next get- together, you will be the perfect host.

Bought all of the ingredients and when I was ready to make it for me and my husband, I discovered my son drank the mango juice. I'll still give it 5 stars because it was still good with just the apricot, pineapple, orange.

Subbed peach nectar since that is what we had on hand, and it was still delicious! This would make a great frozen drink as well...may have to try that when the weather gets warm again!

Very good, just the right amount of sweetness and citrus. I used the apricot, mango nectars. I mixed a 12 oz can of frozen OJ with 3 cans of water. I used prosecco and let guests add they amount they wanted to their glass. Froze ice cubes of cranberry juice for color.

Yum! Made a non-alcoholic one for my kiddo. We only had apricot nectar so we used that and regular OJ. I totally didn't see adding the water part but didn't miss it.

Love!  I do not premix with champagne since it works great with Sprite or 7up as well.  I've made for kids (or adults) and simply put the 'bubbly' part in a cup first, then add the juice mix to it accordingly.  Always a party fav!  I use any kind of nectar (guava, mango, apricot-mango, strawberry, etc) and they all work well.  Without premixing the 'bubbly' part, all can enjoy however they prefer it mixed.

Yes, had a difficult time finding apricot nectar Found small cans, only used one and added prepared orange juice to taste. Only used one 6oz can of pineapple juice. I think I would prefer to use bottled orange juice, one can of apricot, and one can of pineapple for a total of 36 oz plus water. It served 4 people easily.
