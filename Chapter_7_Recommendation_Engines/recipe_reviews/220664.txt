I omitted the oil, using spray oil instead.  These were easy to make.  Great tasting burgers!  I'll be making these again!

I really loved the seasoning in these patties.  I substituted gluten free oats for the flour and it worked out well.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to leave some of the black beans whole in order to have more texture in the patties.  I also adjusted the recipe to four servings to feed the family.  Overall, I loved these and thought they were as good or better than a favorite at a local restaurant.  A great vegan choice!

Taste is good, texture leaves a little to be desired.
