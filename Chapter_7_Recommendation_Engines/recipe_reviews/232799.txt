This is definitely the best lemon bar (square) I have ever tasted! I like to add 1/4 teaspoon baking powder to both the crust and the filling. It will help to get those tall, chewy bars (squares). I love how Chef John gives us those excellent tips, such as beating the filling for 2 minutes, and wetting the knife before cutting the bars. Just follow the recipe exactly, and you will get your prize-winning lemon bars (I mean, lemon SQUARES!). Expect lots of complements!

Thanks, Chef John! Oh boy, these are goooood. I've made some pretty good lemon bars in my life, but hubby and I both agree these are the best. The filling is very lemony, with a perfect balance of tartness and sweet. It set up wonderfully. I'm not 100% sold on the crust, as I tend to prefer one a bit more substantial and firm, but that is simply my preference. This crust is excellent, as long as you are aware it is more flaky than firm.

Two comments, though, and both on the crust. I'd suggest mixing the salt with the flour first, then adding the butter. I also had a hard time with the finger-wetting bit. The crust kept sticking to my hands. I gave up and dusted my fingers with flour, instead. MUCH easier.

EDIT 2/9/14: I made the bars yet again (I've lost count how many times now) and changed the crust a little. Same ingredients, but mixed the dry ingredients in a food processor. Pulsed in CHILLED butter cut into pieces (like pastry crust), then lightly pressed it all into the pan. It came out perfect!

This recipe is almost like the one I've made for many years with three exceptions:  no vanilla in the crust, only two eggs, and baking soda in the custard.  I have to say that I really like how this version turned out and will replace my old recipe with this one.  I did double it because I have to gift at least half of it to someone else, and I knew my family would be very sad if they didn't get any.  I wish I had a kitchen torch so I could have tried the meringue option!  (I do not need another kitchen tool!)   Thanks, Chef John, for another winner!

I craved lemon bars my entire pregnancy and the day i finally made this recipe...i went into labor! Im not saying these bars are magic, but im not saying these bars arent magic either. Either way they are the best lemon bars i have ever tasted and i was thrilled to have some left when i came home from the hospital.

I've made this recipe as is many many times.  That is what the 5 stars are for.  However, now I add 2 teaspoons of freshly grated lemon zest to the crust before I finish blending it.  I also increase the curd recipe by 1/2.  Now the lemon curd sits about 3/4 of an inch above the crust.  It's wonderful.

The flavor of these bars is excellent, and I love that they filled my kitchen with the aroma of lemon pie as they were baking.  However, the baking times listed were much too long for my oven.  The crust was ready in just 10 minutes, and the custard layer in about 18.  I never had the thin, white crust on top as the recipe describes; my custard got light brown and bubbly.  The powdered sugar did a fine job of hiding the bubbly, ugly top.  The crust stuck horribly to my non-stick pan (I did, indeed, oil it first), so be liberal with the oil or cooking spray.  I'll definitely keep practicing with this recipe until I get it right for my oven and equipment.

I have made many lemon bars in my time. For some reason this one is the best. The crust is flaky like my English grandma's tarts and pies. The custard filling delicious and slightly tart. I might add a bit more zest next time to make it even more spunky. This one is replacing all my other recipes.

I made these great lemon bars thank you Chef John!
I did make one small change that turned out wonderful. I swapped out the butter in the shortbread crust for cocoanut oil in it's solid form. The taste of cocoanut with lemon was to die for! I have a friend who said she was wondering "if I would ever find a lemon bar I could enjoy... this is a keeper!" Thanks again Chef John and All recipes

I love anything lemon. These are great. I have also changed the recipe for raspberry bars. Instead of lemon juice use 1\4 cup chambord and about 1/2 cup of raspberries.

Fantastic. For one thing, the timing instructions were dead on for both the crust and final product, which is rare in a baking recipe. One more minute would have been too long. The crust makes these lemon bars stand out. This crust has to be handled like a pie crust. If you follow the instructions and don't over work the dough, and very gently press it into the pan (I barely wet my fingers), you will get a delicious, flaky crust. Too much mixing or too firm of pressing will make it more dense. I do not have a good zester, so I used only 1/4 tsp of zest and it was plenty lemony. Final note--I used organic eggs, which tend to have an orange color as eggs are actually supposed to. I was worried that the custard would look too orange as it was quite orange pre-baking, but it turned out bright yellow after baking.

I made this recipe today and thought it was easy and delicious.  I did use a slightly different method for making the crust.  I used all the same ingredients, but started by putting all the dry crust ingredients into a food processor and pulsing a couple of times to make sure they were well blended.  Then I added the vanilla and cold butter cut into pieces, not softened butter.  I pulsed until it turned into a crumbly, sand-like texture.  I had lined the pan with aluminum foil sprayed with cooking oil.  I was able easily to press the mixture into the pan, and didn't wet my finger. It turned out really well that way and was very easy to work with. Once the whole thing was baked and cooled, it was very simple to lift the whole thing out of the pan and cut the bars with no mess or sticking.

I made these lemon bars to rave reviews for my family, so I decided to take them to a school potluck after doubling the recipe and using a 9 x 13" pan.  I followed the recipe exactly, but took another reviewers suggestion about pulsing the crust ingredients (butter cold) in a food processor.  To press it into the pan, I dumped it in and smoothed it out, then laid a piece of plastic wrap over it and pressed it down first with my hand, then with a heavy can.  I did not prick it.  The baking times were just spot on, even doubled works with the original times.  Everyone at the potluck raved about them, and sought me out to tell me so.  I went home with an empty pan.  Fantastic bars!

Are there more stars to poke???  People, these are a problem! Unless you're ok buying bigger pants or spending an inordinately large amount of time at the gym. I made these for the first time about a week and a half ago. We are now on round 3! Double batches every time. 
I followed Mary Elizabeth's advice and added the baking powder to both crust and filling. The only other changes I made at all were to use Meyer Lemons  and a hand mixer  instead of a whisk..  AMAZING.
I'm going to find out today what happens when you when turn the shortbread into a crust for a cheesecake and the gorgeous custard for the top layer! Oh, and I'm going to the gym.

We are a household that loves lemon bars, and we love this one! I even made it gluten free, by substituting a gluten-free flour blend, and it was also great. The gluten free blend made the crust very flaky, and we really liked that. No one here even realized they were gluten-free! I love Chef John's recipes; I've always found them to be reliably successful.

My favorite dessert is lemon meringue pie, so when I saw this quick and easy treat that could possibly give me my lemon fix without all the work of a pie, I was all over it!  I actually had my 3 and 4 year olds make this all by themselves. (I just scooped the ingredients for them, they poured them in and mixed them and I baked it).  These are super yummy and very lemony.  You MUST use fresh lemon to get the real lemon flavor.

This was my first time making lemon bars and they turned out perfect!  The instructions were very easy to follow and explained how everything would look exactly. 1 reviewer said he added 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda to the crust and filling.  I made two batches so i tried it both ways and both ways turned out great.  One was slightly puffier and taller while the other was thinner and dense.  It just depends on how you like them but you cannot go wrong with this recipe!  Pay attention to the color of the edge to make sure you don't overcook.

Flavor was great, easy to make.  Not sure what happened but the crust rose to the top and the lemon custard was on the bottom - so I just flipped them over.  Why did the crust rise?

I love, love, love these lemon bars.  Made them as directed except doubled and used a 9x13 pan.  Yum! Yum! Very easy too.  Did as one suggested and used my food processor for crust ingredients.  Second time making them this week.

This is a very decent lemon bar. The shortbread base is excellent, with good flavor and crunch. The 50/50 ratio of crust to lemon custard was perfect for me. The extra yolk in this version creates a very solid lemon layer, which some might enjoy; I prefer mine to have a little more creaminess or lightness in texture. I would rate the lemon strength as mild. 
I used Chef John's suggestion to use the extra white for a meringue topping and thought it was a nice touch. My husband and I both thought these tasted better the second day.

The custard was good but the shortbread bottom flaked and wouldn't hold together. It crumbled so much that it made it unpleasant to eat. Also, I like my custard to be gooey... this one was chewy.

Very easy and absolutely delicious!  I added 1/4 tsp of baking powder to both the crust and filling as suggested by another reviewer. These are going into my recipe box.

Honestly, these are the best lemon bars I have ever made. I love everything about them--the taste, the texture, the proportions, the appearance... The little sugar coating that happens naturally on top is fantastic too because it made them look finished enough to me without even adding the extra sugar (they're sweet enough as is!), and they don't get all stuck together when you stack them. This recipe gets all my stars.

Made these for Easter and enjoyed them quite a bit.  Even my son, (who in my opinion, is a lemon square snob), gave them a thumbs up.  The qualities for a "good" lemon square is such a personal thing...each person has their own idea of how the perfect lemon square should taste.  I actually plan to add a bit more lemon the next time I make these with the hope of tipping the scale towards tartness.  Quantity of lemon filling to crust seemed just right.

These lemon bars are fantastic!  I have made a couple of changes to the process of making them though.  I have a really hard time with trying to mash the butter with the flour, so I cut cold butter into the flour with a pastry blender instead, and when I have a crumbly texture I add the other crust ingredients and I work the dough with my hands until I have the slightly crumbly cookie dough texture. I have found the baking times to be too long.  I bake the crust for about 18 minutes and then the whole bar for 20-22 minutes.  I have baked these using convection and not, and I find the regular setting is actually better.  The other change I usually make is to double the recipe and bake in a 9x13 baking dish because they are so delicious!

these are a hit every time!  I have added sea salt to the crust and get good reviews on that as well... always good to bite into a chunk of salt with all the sweetness of the crust and the lemon filling!!

I will make these again and they are delicious.   It took me several tries to get them just right.   to be able to work the crust,  I had to be very careful not to sure too much flour. It worked best when I used the curved side of the knife to scrape the measuring cup.   Watch the video- its very helpful as well! 22 minutes was too high on my oven- crust burned so check your oven often 18-20 was correct in my oven. 

Don't make the lemon too soon or wait too long.  I started it when the crust was almost done and it was perfect.  The first time I started making the lemon mixture  right when I put the crust in and it set out too long.   The bars were ugly.  The 2nd time, I waited and let the crust cool a bit and the lemon didn't set- don't do that either! 25 minutes was too long for my oven.  I give the recipe 5 stars because its perfect and I didnt change a thing other than baking times really.

Thanks Chef John! I was so worried about these coming out of the pan in one piece but after the first piece (i.e. "martyr" piece), they all came out beautifully and are delicious! I did have to reduce the time baking by 3-4 minutes for both the crust and filling but absolute lemony goodness.  It will definitely be a hit at my niece's bridal shower.

This recipe is simple and delicious. The texture is great and the if you want more lemon flavor, all you have to do is add zest. I rarely complete a recipe without modifying it significantly but this time I only added 2-3 drops of almond extract to the eggs and sugar and cut the sugar down by 1/8 of a cup. Thanks Chef John--this is my go to lemon bar recipe!

When my non dessert eating hubby mentioned liking lemon bars, I thought "Score!". I love how easy these were to make, and how the shortbread wasn't dry or overpowering. The lemon filling was silky smooth. I did use orange zest instead of lemon. Next time maybe I'll try lime, for a little extra kick, as we like the citrus tart more than sugar sweet.
Update: we make these often now, but normally double the recipe and sub out half the sugar for honey. It's even better that way!

These are delish! The cooking time, for ME, was way off on the crust. I checked it at 12 min. & it was brown around the edges. Glad I just happened to check it before it was burnt. The filling cook time seemed to be spot on.

Made these as written.  The recipe worked well and came out very good.  However, the lemon bars were much too sweet for our taste.

Amazing lemon bars, very fun to make. I added a thin layer of homemade lemon meringue (1 egg white, 2 teaspoons sugar, squeeze lemon juice) on the top of the bars and broiled them for a minute and they turned out great!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Great lemon flavor and lovely consistency of both the crust and filling.  I made the meringue for these bars and that was a great topping!  I did end up doubling the amount so that I could pipe it well on the top.  Next time, I will grease the pan a little better--had some bars sticking.  Will make this again and again!

Compared to other lemon bar recipes i have tried this one is significantly more complicated and time consuming, and produces an inferior product.  The crust was hard and severely stuck to the pan, and the filling never fully set up.  The ratio of tartness to sweetness was very good though.

The consistency on these bars is amazing!  my only critique is that they're a little too sweet for me so I may add extra lemon juice and zest next time.  But otherwise perfect!

I have been searching for the best Lemon Bar recipe for years - I believe I found it! First, the texture of the filling is perfect - not "soggy" or too dry.  The balance of lemon tartness is also spot on.  The crust is ideal.  I baked as directed in timing of the recipe and both the crust and filling were perfect. I took the hint of cutting the edge with a knife dipped in hot water - it worked.  I also dipped my small metal spatula in hot water, tapped on paper towel so it was just "damp" to cut the bars - awesome - no pulling half the filling up on the spatula - produced a nice, clean, straight cut. Bottom line - this is my number one go to recipe for Lemon Bars!

Chef John did it again! When I wanted to find a failed proof recipe for lemon square, I go directly to Chef John's. It turned out wonderful. The recipe was very to follow.  I did skip pressing the crust with wet hand and the poking using the fork. The crust at the time was very crumbly. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and I won't change a thing.

This is the first time making lemon bars and my family say its the best they ever had. I did use coconut flour instead but still great results with a hint of coconut, I recommend this to everyone I know who likes lemon bars.

I read tons of reviews before choosing which to make and how to tweak the recipes. This recipe is great! With one minor change.. DOUBLE the lemon curd. Otherwise you end up with 80% crust (not exaggerating). Enjoy!

Here it is, 2:00 in the morning and I'm making these very lemon bars, for the millionth time. BECAUSE THEY ARE SCRUMPTIOUS! Every time I make them every one wants them, not a crumb left on the plate. The count down begins. 15 minutes and they will be ready. The BFs friends come over and they still talk about the first time I made them years ago. I am making 2 batches tonight and at least 2 more batches for give aways, because people get their felling hurt if I make them and I don't give them some. The list is long. These are a crowd pleaser, and even the newest chef can hit a home run with these. Highly recommend anything chef John does. Thanks for making me famous with family and friends, chef John!

Just made these lemon squares and they're perfect! The recipe and instructions were all very clear and everything worked out well. I love how they have a strong lemon taste and aren't too cakey like other lemon squares I've had. I'll never have to use a different lemon square recipe again!

The Best EVER!  I've made and eaten lemon bars for years, looking for the best one. This is it!
Like some others, I reduced the granulated sugar to about 3/4 cup. Lets the lemon tartness come through. :)

These are by far the best lemon bars I have ever had! The shortbread crust makes all of the difference in the world, and the filling is the perfect blend of sweet and tart. They are a little bit of work, only because of using fresh juice and zest, but I cannot imagine them any other way! We love them!! Thank you!!

I followed the recipe exactly with one exception- more lemon juice. I like mine a little more tart, and used one and a half Costco-sized lemons (they're pretty big). It came out to probably about 3/8 of a cup of lemon juice.

I always share my baked goods at work, but I couldn't even give these up.

The crust was too crunchy for me. The lemon wasn't tangy enough and the bars were burned when they came out. It looked good, the crust was perfect but like I said, too crunchy. The lemon custard was bland. Did this recipe right like the instructions said. I put and took the bars out of the oven and they were burned. And I couldn't taste the lemon. It was just bars of nothing.I'm just gonna stick to my regular lemon bar recipe. Did you go to cooking class? Well, this told me that you did not. Yet Chef John does it again.

I bake a lot, and am quite good at following recipes. This did not live up to its 5-star rating in my opinion. I will not invest the time necessary again, to create lemon bars that are simply ok. I made two pans for my husband to take to work. I asked him to taste them, and he said he didn't want to take them in.  (I have a reputation to uphold---I am known for my baked goods and other sweets.) What were the problems? The sugar in both the crust and filling caramelized and made it nearly impossible to remove the bars from the pan. The flavor of the crust is bland. (I saw the suggestion to add lemon zest after I had already baked these. I think that might help.) And, to my taste, the filling is too sweet. I plan to keep a few and toss the rest. I will save my calories for something I love.

Very, very good.  Simply AMAZING shortbread crust.  These are a little on the sweet-side, next time I will double the zest. UPDATE: I have made this recipe 6 times now, and I like to double the ingredients but bake in a 9x9 square pan + add an extra 3 minutes to the baking time.  I'm also guilty of adding .5 cups extra powdered sugar to the crust recipe ;)

The only thing I changed was I doubled the recipe because I needed more than the recipe said there was going to be but other than that  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. They were gone by the very next day. And around here when my dad sneaks bites of anything, that means its really good. Have fun!!!

Perfection.  Anyone who says otherwise has only themselves to blame!  Like all recipes, you have to know your equipment  and adjust accordingly.  That said, I had to alter the cooking time on these.  I took my "crust" out a couple of minutes earlier than the recipe called for because it was done and my "filling" only took 18 minutes.   These are beautiful and delicious.  The balance between the sweet and tart is spot on.  It was my first time making lemon bars and I can't believe how easy it was to do.  I will definitely be using this recipe a lot.  Thanks Chef John :)

I had to make them gluten free.  I used Bob's Red Mill Cup 4 Cup (3/4 cup  and almond flour 1/4 cup for the crust and cup for cup in the batter).   I also reduced the sugar a little, because it's for someone that is not supposed to have sugar and used sugar in the raw.  Awesome bars.

Cooking times were a bit too long for my oven but (since that is often the case with my oven) I set my timer to check the dish earlier and it came out perfect! My husband loves lemon bars and this recipe is now one of his favorites!!!

Like others I found the baking times too long (I have a thermometer in my oven & the temp was correct); I suspect the recipe is extremely temperature-sensitive. Cheap contractor-grade ovens (apartment ovens) typically don't maintain consistent temperature well: temperature drops & heating element activity create an erratic heat environment.  This recipe is tasty but more challenging than most to get right without a good oven.

Have made this many times through the years from a recipe I obtained from a local minister.However,she added half a cup of shredded coconut ( I always use the sweetened version ) to the top layer ingredients. In addition, she made a glaze which she drizzled over the warm top made from confectioners sugar ( 1/2 cup) mixed with
fresh lemon juice (6-8 tablespoons). I am almost 70, and it is still my lingering favorite even though it has three distinct stages.But...it is worth every minute of prep time.

I've been making these for a lot of years. This recipe is easy to make and uses "on-hand" ingredients. I make meringue with 2 egg whites, spread on top, put under Broiler until toasty brown. VERY GOOD!!

Too good to be true!  This is not just good, it's FOOD-ORGASMIC!  For the lemon juice, I used 1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon.  The result was not too tart, not too sweet.  Just the perfect balance of lemon flavor and sweetness.  Next time though, I will put some parchment paper in my pan.  The cookie stuck a little to the sides of my pan, even though I greased it.  This recipe will be a regular in my house from now on.  Thank you chef John!  Another fantastic recipe from you, you're the best!  Loved the video too.

Delicious- I also mixed the crust in the food processor and it worked great.  Filling is delicious- you can tweak it to your taste.  I doubled the ingredients and used a 9x13 pan with complete success.

This is now my favorite thing to make! It's perfectly sweet and satisfies my cravings right away! Not too tart at all. I've made this for friends and they can't get enough of them either. Very simple recipe and doesn't use very much ingredients. If you like sweet & simple, then this is the way to go!

OMG These bars are addictive!  I didn't have any salt free butter & used salted butter and they still came out beautifully.  My mother is a lemon nut and everything I have made up until now she always said "not lemony enough"  All she said when she tasted this was WOW I love them.  Not hard to make either.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank Chef John!

Oh my!!! You certainly spoiled us with this recipe, it was simply perfect the taste was superb and I love that it had the perfect amount of everything with such simple kitchen ingredients. Definitely a gourmet dessert suitable for the finest of restaurants. I couldn't do the meringue (no torch) but it didn't need it. Didn't bother putting powder sugar either, it was spot on as is. We had a Chef John dinner which consisted of the buttermilk fried chicken, mashed potatoes, buttermilk biscuits, and these lemon squares as dessert. They were the perfect compliment, to the meal, I think my kids are dreaming about them, they had 3rds and my hubby kept going back to them too. Store bought lemon desserts taste miserable to me so I don't ever do lemon anything in a dessert context, but that will change after today. After they cooled down on the counter a bit I placed them in the freezer for about 30 minutes, they are definitely a cool treat, better they warm up in your mouth not your plate.

I've eaten lemon bars made by my mom for years, and these are MUCH better (sorry, Mom)! The main thing that's so much better is that there is no weird "whangy" lemon/egg yolk flavor to gross me out. It's just sweet lemony bliss. The second thing that's so much better is the crust. It's texture is just right (I'm big on texture). Otherwise, it's a lemon bar, yummy and not bizarre. My hubby made these for us last night, and they turned out so well, that he's making them again today! Yay!

Very tasty but they are kinda flat.  Next time I will add baking powder to the lemon filling.  Don't make the filling until the crust comes out of the oven as it needs to be freshly whipped.

This will replace my longtime favorite lemon bar recipe. I don't know if it is the tiny bit of vanilla in the crust or ? but it is the best lemon bar recipe I have ever used. This time I am making it with lime, because that is what I have on hand. We'll see......

I followed the recipe exactly.  Both the crust and lemon layer were way overdone.  The crust was powdery and crumbled apart, and the lemon layer had an ugly brown crust that was hard to camouflage with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar.  The lemon layer was plenty tart and smelled good (I absolutely love all things lemon), but it was too sweet and too thin.  The crust was bland, and with such a thin lemon layer, it dominated each bite.  It's not worth tweaking.

Gluten Free Version. I simply substituted a gluten free flour mix and followed Chef John's recipe. To compensate for the lack of crust integrity, I used large, paper cupcake liners and then placed them in a silicone muffin mold. The recipe made 15 crusts. Baking time for the cookie crust was 12 minutes. I poured almost 1.5 tbs. lemon custard over the hot crusts. Then baked them for about 18-19 minutes. The lemon bars peeled out of the papers easily! We are delighted. And my wonderful husband is happy!

I was nervous to attempt lemon bars, but gave it a shot, and they came out perfect! Only changes: used cold butter and used my food processor, and didn't have a zester. Otherwise followed to a t, including exact times. I doubled it in a 9x13 pan. Delicious!

One of my all-time favorite bake sale goodies,  just never checked out recipes before. For this Thanksgiving,  decided to Google 5-star lemon bar recipes and Chef Johns had the most favorable reviews.  Wow.....awesomely easy! Only needed to buy lemons. Doubled recipe for 9x13 and increased 1/4 to 1/3 lemon juice. That's it....perfect 1st time around and family loved them.  Even I couldn't believe I made them.

I have a lemon tree in my yard so I've had to search for as many delicious ways to use them as possible. This recipe is one of my favorites. Normally, I'm not a fan of lemony desserts but I decided to give this one a try because I have hundreds of lemons and my boyfriend also loves lemon bars. Once I made this, I was hooked! Absolutely perfect combo of the lemon and crust. I'm a huge crust lover so I did increase the crust by a third to make it a bit thicker but other than that there are no complaints. Very fresh and not overly sweet.

Overall tasty lemon square. Make sure not to over bake the lemon top; the timing in the recipe is perfect!  However my crust was slightly undercooked. Next time I will add an extra minute or so to bake the crust but will definitely be trying this one again!

Just made these and they are awesome!   My family (1 husband and 5 kids) love lemon bars.  I normally do not...but I do love these!   A lot of lemon bars I've had just taste kind of bland but not these, just a pure wonderful lemon flavor.

I've tried other lemon bar recipes and they end up too sweet or not lemony enough. This one is the perfect balance. Have received rave reviews from friends and coworkers when I've brought these to gatherings. You don't have to change a thing about this recipe and they come out perfect!

Came together easily. Per reviewer's suggestion, I added 1 tsp. of baking powder to the crust and filling and got great results.

These are fantastic! 

 I love how the lemon layer somehow forms a bit of a crust on top.  It allows a dusting of powdered sugar to stay on top, and not soak in, as has happened with every other lemon bar I've ever made!  

The shortbread crust is just perfect.  

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan, because a small pan is never enough :)   

 (**next time I will add a bit more lemon and lemon zest because I love very tart citrus flavor, but they're delicious as written)

Made them exactly as per Chef John's recipe & they turned out perfect! My husband thought they were a bit too sweet for his taste so maybe next time I'll reduce the sugar &/or increase the lemon. But the crust was perfect, the custard developed the white glaze Chef John mentions, and the timing was just right. I topped them off with some black raspberries I'd just picked & it gave them an extra little festive touch. Definitely a keeper!

I've never written a review about a recipe before in my life, but this is so easy and so delicious I just had to. I looked around for a good Lemon Bar recipe because I've never made one before. I'm really a Choc-o-laic, my poor husband is tired of it, so I made these at his request. We BOTH are in love with them and I've made these flaky crust Lemon Bars 4 more times since. I'll definitely be making my new favorite desert a regular treat around here.

I was given fresh tree-ripened lemons from Florida and wanted to make something that "popped" lemon.  This recipe is perfect in every way - down to the timing of the crust and filling.  WOW!!!! I did not alter this recipe in anyway as I have a tendency to do!  Kudos to you, Chef John.  This is a definite repeat and recipe-keeper!

I've been baking Lemon Bars for a lot of years and never thought of making a meringue to top them.  Always just dusted with powdered sugar.  Today I used Chef John's idea of making a meringue topping.  They turned out wonderful.  Next time I'm going to try this recipe with orange juice and orange zest instead of lemon.

OMG these are so good!  My husband said these were the best he's ever had, and they were super easy!  I doubled the recipe, using 2 8x8 dishes and just tried to get as close to halving it between the 2 dishes as I could.  Worked great!  Thanks Chef John!

I registered especially to thank for this awesome recipe. They turned out amazingly good. They were my first lemon bars I made, and I'm definitely gonna make them again. I added a bit less sugar, cause I like a bit tart lemon sweets. Thank you, Chef John!!!

I literally got a marriage proposal over these lemon bars! :) They are absolutely fantastic. The crust is flaky and flavorful, but not too sweet, leaving the glory notes for the lemony custard part. I had a standby recipe that I use, but decided to try something different. So glad I did. This is my new go to recipe for lemon bars.

I must have done something wrong because the lemon filling ended up on the bottom. It was a sticky mess and hard to get out of the pan.

I followed the recipe to a T. My bars tasted OK. They weren't tangy enough for me. I made a sheet pan (48 bars based on recipe) for a large gathering. My bars turned out upside down! 
I think the cooking time listed for the crust was too long. The crust pulled away from the sides of the pan, so when I put the custard on, I believe, it soaked in under the crust. Plus, the docking (pricking) may have also lead to the custard seeping through the holes and under the crust. They are impossible to plate and look sloppy. Depending on which bar you pick up it may just be a cookie with a hint of lemon custard on the bottom or a clump of custard with a cookie on top. I will not be making Chef John's Lemon Bars again.

I get tons of compliments when I make this. I didn't change a thing and people tell me that this is to die for. I even made one for someone and they paid me for it , then said I should sell these. Lol. I'm a lemon fanatic and this is perfect for me. This recipe is perfect as is. In my home they only last a couple of days. My hubby and I eat hem all.

I made this exactly as directed.  The cooking time was exactly correct for both portions.  The crust is hard to manipulate and I just got barely enough to spread to the edges of the pan.  But it seemed okay in the end.  It was literally melt in your mouth good.  I would like to get a really yellow lemon filling.  Any suggestions to make it a deeper shade?  Next time I think I will put a little more lemon zest in to make it more lemony for my preference.

This was excellent. I goofed and added twice the lemon juice but it turned into a happy mistake as it was just the right combination of sweet and tart. The shortbread crust melds nicely with the filling. Used gluten free all purpose flour and it still turned out nicely. Will add coconut flakes next time.

I love this recipe, I did however add more lemon juice,  about another 1/4 cup and  another 1 TBL lemon zest.   I prefer a more intense lemon flavor.  I think this will be pretty much my go to recipe for lemon bars.  I highly recommend this one.

The flavor was good, but the baking time was off on both steps.  The crust was crumbly and, despite excess greasing of the pan, stuck terribly.

When I moistened my fingers to press the dough in the dish, the dough got too wet and it wasn't easy to prick it with a fork, it keep going closed.  (I did watch the video.) It didn't get a white crust when done, it was starting to brown, so I took it out after 22 minutes.  The bottom crust was crumbly when I cut it.  

It tasted very good, but I am taking it to a meeting and I want it to look like bought ones do.  Oh well...

I made this today for a cookout and it turned out so ugly that I didn't even put it out. I was curious to see what it tasted like before I threw the entire pan away so I tried a tiny piece. The sides were a little burned and the top appeared to have a crusted over look. All this being said when I tried it, the bar wasn't bad but was extremely sweet. It's hard to rate this one because it didn't turn out looking like any of the photos but for the most part wasn't bad tasting. If I made this again, I would cook it for a little less time and cut back on the sugar by 1/4-1/3. I would probably give a light sprinkle of confectioners sugar over the top to mask the "crusted over" look.

Very addicting!  I'm going to make it again but double it and distribute them to my hubs work.  The only addition I made was the baking powder to the crust and filling.  I kinda screwed up on the crust because I didn't read the directions thoroughly but it was still flaky.

I've never been a fan of citrusy fruits, especially lemons. I'm not very tolerant of sour foods, but in effort to recover from a terrible cold, I had a bag full of lemons in my fridge I didn't quite know what to do with the overwhelming amount, so I gave this a go. DELICIOUS! To help dissipate some of the sourness of the lemon custard layer, I doubled the shortbread cookie dough and made a thick blanket of sweeter crust. Worked like a CHARM. The tartness of the lemon layer was agreeable and complimented the thick rich crust all too perfectly. It's too bad it took a mutant flu to get me to open my taste palette to the wonderful and refreshing world of lemons.

My search for a simple yet delicious lemon bar is over! I've made these twice in just 10 days! The second time, I used a 9" pie plate, and the presentation was a little fancier. I put a few slices of various berries on the plate with the lemon bar slice, just because we were having company.

These are very good but bake time was a little off. I made them twice in the past 2 weeks, used a glass baking dish and a metal one thinking that was the problem since I know my oven temp. was accurate. I will make them again but will check them often.

Yum! These turned out great! I used salted butter, because it's what I had, so I didn't add the 1/4 tsp salt called for in the recipe. And I completely forgot to add the zest. They are still really good. Exactly what I think of when I think of lemon bars. And so simple to make, too! My 9 year old helped me. This recipe is a keeper!

This was my first time making Lemon Bars.  My Grandma made Lemon Bars a lot and I'm so bummed I never got her recipe.  I'm happy to say that my family loved this.  I came home and it was half gone.  Lots of love for this recipe.

Love, love,love the crust recipe! The powdered sugar makes it melt in your mouth. I filled the crust with the Arizona Sunshine Pie filling that uses a  whole Meyer lemon--skin and and all, and got rave reviews. One person commented "I make a great lemon bar, but these are better."

Wow, the recipe was tripled, I didn't have unsalted butter, so I used salted, and I added the baking powder to the crust and filling.  They were really really good!! Took them to a Super Bowl party.   I loved the shortbread, and I did as one of the other reviewers suggested and blended the dry ingredients first and used a food processor.   I will be making this again!!

Loved this - made it gluten free but instead of using vanilla in the crust, I used a bit of almond extract which was extra yummy.  The lemon filling was perfect!

An excellent recipe, a usual. Thanks, Chef John!

I used the method recommended using cold butter, cut into small pieces with flour and a food processor. Turned out so nice!

These lemon bars are absolutely amazing!! I doubled the recipe because I thought there would be enough for a picture.  However they were eaten very quickly and the family is already wanting me to bake more. Thank you Chef John. I enjoy your videos and tips. This recipe will be a new family favorite for all occasions or just because.

Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe! This recipe has become one of our family favorites. the one thing I altered is cutting back the sugar which gives the lemon an extra taste.

Lemon bars being one of my favorite edible things, I have lots of taste-experience to compare to. This recipe was very easy to follow and certainly not bad but not one of the bests either. Not for my like at least. I consider a good lemon bar not sour that you would get a weird feeling on your teeth if you ate too much, and you can't really taste the butter. Like you don't take a bite and immediately think "This has butter in it, yup." This recipe leads to that kind of strong butter taste. Perhaps this also depends on the brand of butter used.

Also the meringue could be improved a little bit.

Finally, the recipe gives a certain shelf in the oven to bake this but in my opinion it's wrong and can easily get misleading. In my countertop oven for example the second, aka the middle shelf doesn't work well for things like lemon bars (the top gets baked too soon and gets brown). The bottom shelf work betters. If you are baking this for the first time, keep an eye on the oven to check how things are going.

Doubled the recipe in a 13 x 9" dish. Substituted bottled lemon juice and they were still delicious. Made them for a church dessert supper and they went quickly!

These are wonderful. I will totally make these again. The crust is amazing and the lemon filling is a delightful combination of sweet and tart. Make sure to take the time needed to blend the crust and to let them cool before cutting. It is hard to let them cool completely but well worth the wait.

The taste is amazing but the cooking times are too long and you need twice the amount of custard to the amount of crust it calls for.  I am going to try that and update my review.

I liked the flavour overall and the crust was really nice.  I think the ratio of custard to crust is too similar.  I'd like custard to be 2/3 and crust to be 1/3. Overall they were gobbled up fast.

Love it! will definitely make it again! I added a teaspoon of baking powder to the lemon custard with made it very fluffy and nice. 

one thing tho is that mine are always very thin even after I triple the custard, :(

still love the recipe tho !!!!!!!

Perfect amount of tart! I only had 1 lemon & supplemented  organic bottled lemon juice for about half of the juice. I've made these 4 times in a month!

Absolutely delicious!! A big hit all around! Tart and sweet. The only sm thing that I  did was that I added 1 extra heaping TBSP of lemon zest to the crust.
If you are looking for a super  easy dessert to throw together, this is it!

Made this for the first time. I left out the vanilla, but used all the other ingredients. My husband said it was the best lemon bar he’s ever had. He’s taking the rest of it to his office to share. Great instructions.

The crust was perfect and buttery, and the lemon custard had the perfect tart to sweet ratio. My husband hates lemon bars, but he loved these.

This turned out great! I doubled the lemon portion and used a little more lemon, less sugar and adjusted the flour slightly as some of the other reviewers mentioned. I served it with fresh raspberries. I served it at a bbq and everyone loved it!

I have made these many times, but this weekend made to share at a gathering with several gluten free family members.   Made just as written, but substituted Bob's Red Mill Gluten free 1 to 1 baking flour.  Had great results, and everyone could enjoy this delicious dessert.

I made exactly per instructions. Crust was fine after it baked,  but the filling was the problem. Not very lemony and it tasted a little “egg-y”.  Sorry for the three stars, but just wasn’t very good.

My husband loves when I make these bars. They are tangy and just the right amount of sweet and sour. Occasionally, we have trouble with the shortbread cookie sticking to our glass pan.

I've done 3 version of this: all double batches and all with reduced sugar to ~300 grams  (2 cups sugar is normally around 450 grams) for the double batch. Version 1 had 2/3 cup lemon juice. Version 2 had 2/3 cup lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of flour to make up for the decrease in sugar, since I found that Version 1 was kind of liquidy and didn't hold its shape very well. Version 3 had 1/2 cup lemon juice (ran out of lemons) and also the 4 tablespoons of flour (60 grams).

The increase in lemon juice really made the lemon flavour pop—when I only used the 1/2 cup I felt that the sweetness was overpowering, even with the reduction in sugar! 

The flour addition helped give the lemon layer more structure, but it was also kind of nice to have the custard really flow when cutting and serving.

I also included some larger pieces of lemon rind in the lemon layer—used a vegetable peeler to get rind without the white bits, and then chopped it finely and added it in. It gave a "fruit leather" feel once baked, and I thought that these chewy bits helped create an interesting textural contrast.

I've had another lemon bar recipe that I usually went to, but decided to try Chef John's recipe and wow, it is so good! More lemony than the recipe I had and I like that. I followed it to a tee. It's very easy to do too. This is a keeper!

I added lemon extract since I didn't think I used the right amount of lemon zest called for in the recipe. Also, it took about 15 minutes for the crust for me. They tasted great though! Very good for my first try at making lemon bars from scratch.

I made the recipe as directed. The thin, white top never showed up on the bars, but I covered the brown top with powdered sugar. When I took the bars out of the pan, the lemon top separated from the shortbread bottom, and the shortbread bottom was very floury tasting. Very disappointing. It smelled so great while it was baking.

These came out so good! I did use a 8x10 pan and didn’t have enough crust so I made more crust and doubles the filling recipe and it came out perfect it was so good! And next time I will already know to double the lemon bar crust because I love thick crust!

8x8" pan the shortbread crust is a lot in comparison to amount of custard. 
Made again with 1 1/2 the amount of custard; good ratio tho almost too sweet.  And added zest into crust.

Apparently everyone in my family loves lemon desserts...who knew? These were a big hit, and everyone wants the recipe.  This was the first time that I used the zesting side of my box grater, and I'm glad I did.  Zesting four lemons was a great arm workout! 
P.S. I made fresh lemonade with the extra lemon juice.

These are the best! The recipe I formerly used tasted a little eggy, but not Chef John's recipe! I made it as instructed, except I used a gluten-free flour blend (Bob's Red Mill). I'm not sure I'll make them again soon...they're TOO good, and I ate most of the pan myself. Sorry, family.

I followed the filling recipe which was absolutely delicious. For the crust, I substituted 1/2 the dry ingredients with crushed shortbread cookies, and 1/2 the butter with coconut oil.  My neighbors begged me to bake these lemon bars for every event where we share desserts!

These were delicious! Added 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder as well and took them out of the oven sooner b/c they browned instead of getting a white film. Will try to adjust my oven heat next time! Delicious nevertheless! Made some little ones with left over crust b/c I used a increased the serving size to use a slightly larger pie dish.

The best I've had!! The biggest issue with most lemon bars I've tasted is that they simply don't taste like lemon--they're just yellow sugar bombs. These, however, are superb-so lemony, you can actually taste the sourness. The crust is excellent as well-buttery rich, with a hint of sweet like Grandma's sugar cookies. Perfect dessert. It was a big hit with my husband

I will definitely make it again! I think the bottom of my shortbread didn't sufficiently bake as the bottom of the pastry was quite crumbly, but this was a delicious way to use our 'in season' home-grown Meyer lemon!

I followed the recipe as far as the ingrediants exactly.  I put the crust ingredients with little squares of cold butter in my Nutri Bullet and pulsed till crumbly. It formed more of a ball of crust that I pressed into 8×8 lightly greased. Followed all other directions to a T. Oh my, all the yummy sounds while tasting a not quite cool bar. These things are dangerously good. I've also tried different Lemon Bar recipes. This one is tops !!!  Baking times, and texture were exact for my oven. So Good!

When the world gives you lemons make lemon bars!!! These are fantastic. I had to add a bit of chilled water to my shortbread dough to get it to come together. The proportions and the contrast of tart and sweet are just divine. Chef John you bring sunshine to my day with your puns! Thank you.

I doubled the recipe and used half lemon juice and half lime juice.  I had to bake a little longer.  For a first time making these bars they went over pretty well because I had none the next day.
I took a pic and sent to my sister in law and she is adding to her recipe file.

I made this recipe for the first time. The top baked more like a crispy layer which I am okay with. Mine needed more lemon juice and less salt. My recommendation is to lay off the salt and add more lemon juice as it was too salty. I will make it again just wish worked better the first time. The layer may have been since I used vegan butter.

Loved it! I will totally make this again, though I think I'll use less flour in the shortbread crust so that it's not as crumbly.

I took these to a dinner party and everyone loved them. My husband, who loves lemon bars and anything lemon, said these were the best lemon bars he has ever had. I made them just as the recipe stated except I forgot to poke holes in the crust, but it still turned out great. I will be making these again soon.

Great flavor with beautiful color profile for office treat. Used at Christmas for different contrast again other plates of nutmeg, cinnamon, or chocolate chip! Nice strong tart; great with morning coffee.

I'm hesitant in trying this again.,  The filling never set up firm enough like a pie, but was runny when I used a skewer to test if it was done.  ( I checked and double-checked the ingredients).  I ended up giving it an entire 15+ minutes more so it could cook thoroughly. Perhaps I'll add baking powder next time.  It took about 1 1//2 medium lemons to get 1/4 cup liquid.  And 3xs that to get the needed grated lemon zest.  You can''t get 1 tablespoon of zest from a few lemons.  Prepare to spend some time grating at least 4-5 lemons.   Can't believe that the originator of this recipe didn't experience the same thing, and warned the public about the quantity of lemons needed to get 1 tablespoon of zest.  Disappointing.   I may try another lemon bar recipe.  Less confusing.

Absolutely scrumptuous!  The only issue I had was removing them from the pan.  The edges got really stuck.  The hot knife was a great help, but I still had to cut inside the edges in order to get the bars out of the pan.  Maybe I left them in too long; don't know.  Didn't taste as if I did.  I also cut it into fourths so I could remove each quarter with a reticulated spatula and that helped too.  I will try parchment paper liners next time and see if that helps.  Delish!  Will def make again.

Nothing but good reviews from those who have tried this every time I make it. My only recommendation would be to make sure you finely chop the lemon zest. I put mine in a food chopper.

My son really likes lemon bars and requested them for his 20th birthday instead of a cake.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 13x9 pan.  Even though this was my first attempt to make lemon bars, I found the recipe easy to follow and the end result was a big hit.  I have a feeling I will be making these for many years to come and not just for his birthday!

I made these bars for our Bunco group last night.  I did not change the recipe at all.  They got rave reviews, even from the older gals who are tough critics!  I shared the recipe with them.  Very easy to make.  I had everything in my pantry except the fresh lemon, which is huge plus for me!

I love this recipe and have now made it twice. The first time I followed the directions exactly and got rave reviews. I personally wanted more custard, so the second time I doubled the custard but used the same size pan. I cooked the bars for 10 minutes at 350 and then reduced the heat to 325 for 25 more minutes. The custard turned out perfect and was exactly what I wanted. A lot of people have commented on really enjoying the ratio of cookie to custard, which is about 50/50 in the original recipe. I really enjoyed the more custard heavy version, which was more like 25/75 so if that’s something you’re looking for, it’s worth trying!

I really liked this recipe. It was easy. Which is good for me because I like the easier recipe. .The thing that I wish was on the recipe was the time you needed to cool down the lemon bars. Other than that I recommend these lemon bars to anyone who likes cooking with simple ingredients and simple directions. I also think it is good to watch the video before reading the instructions. I think you should try this recipe because it really is a great recipe.

Fantastic lemon bars. Made exactly as the recipe is written (one of my pet peeves is people who rate a recipe after switching half the ingredients, the cooking method and the temperature??)...
I don’t have a torch (bummer) so I added the merengue topping and broiled at 500 F for exactly 90 seconds while watching them. I like them better with merengue but they are also delicious without. As usual a winner from Chef John!

I just made these. The flavors are really good, the sweet to sour is perfect. The reason I gave this recipe a 4 instead of 5 is because I think the bake time is way to long. I took the advice of other reviewers and kept an eye on it the whole time it was baking. For the crust I only baked it 15 mins which was still to long. The custard I baked for 15 mins and it came out perfect. I used a nonstick pan and sprayed because others said that it stuck really badly. It came out of the pan pretty easily. I would have liked the crust to be a bit chewy (might get that with less bake time of the crust) but over all it’s a very recipe. Will definitely make it again.

Fabulous!  I used my food processor for the dry ingredients, as well as the wet.  I doubled the recipe but left the eggs as written and cut back on the sugar by 1/4 Cup.  These lemon bars are so incredibly good that I'm speechless!  As a baker I make a good plumber but even I was able to turn out really gr8 lemon bars. They formed a perfect sugar crust so I passed on powdered sugar or merangue.  OMG, SO GOOD! Thanx, Chef John!!

These brought shame upon our household. Ive never been so embarrassed to serve something. No lemon flavour tasted like egg on a bland cookie. People took one bite and left it on their plate. Recipe FAIL.

Ohmigod! These are divine. I don't like to bake so I'm not terribly good at it and don't have a lot of equipment. These require a whisk, a mixing bowl, and a regular glass dish.  Everyone loves these and they are super easy.  The only drawback is that they do need to be served cold.

Followed Chef Johns direction and it came out perfectly. Absolutely delicious.  Have shared the recipe with all who enjoyed it. Didn’t do the topping other than the powdered sugar.  Will make this again and again. Was delicious days later too (refrigerated).

This was really good and I completely reccomend this recipe! Especially for somebody who has not made lemon squares before this is a great base recipe. I used Nellie and Joe's keylime juice instead of lemon juice. I also put the zest of a lime instead of lemon. Then I added one more yolk to it and they turned out perfect. I like my squares tart so next time I may add a half of cup instead of a fourth. I will use this recipe over and over again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and these were a hit at the graduation party. Very yummy! I tripled the recipe and made one 8x8 pan and one 13x9 pan. I only had to increase the cook time for the 13x9 pan by 1-2 minutes. The edges and corners didn't want to release from the pan. Next time, I will try buttering it instead of using oil.

Not as quick as some other recipes, but the crust was nice and flaky and not sweet like others. The only problem I had was that the crust fell apart when I cut it, but who cares, they didn't last long enough for anyone to notice!

First, I read a LOT of recipes and tips before deciding on this recipe. I made the Ultimate Lemon Bars (insert happy dance here...!)

I made the following adjustments: 
Lined 8x8 pan with foil and sprayed liberally with Pam. 
Added 1/4 tsp baking soda to crust and topping. 
Used food processor with COLD butter to make crust. 
Pressed crust into pan with DRY fingers. 
Added 1/4 tsp lemon extract to topping. (I wanted definite zing to these bars). 

The rest I followed as the recipe indicated including cooking times and temps. EnJOY!!

Not our favorite Chef John recipe. Came out ok, but the taste and texture was not as we had hoped, although they looked quite the same. Maybe they are not for everyone...

This was so good! This is the first time I tried making lemon bars and they turned out amazing. The crust was so flakey and buttery and it was so tasty. I used salted butter because that’s all I had and opted out of adding lemon zest because I didn’t have any, but it still turned out amazing!

I’ve made other versions and like this one best. I have substituted bottle lemon juice and dried lemon peel when I didn’t have fresh. I backed off a little on the measure of peel when I did so.

Simply outstanding and simple to make. Someone suggested adding baking powder to crust and custard. I added it to custard but not crust and was more than satisfied with outcome. More importantly, my daughter was delighted, which is good since I made them for her birthday :) Such a great recipe!

The filling was very good but the crust was too flaky and crumbled too easy. Although the crust had good shortbread flavor, it was the loser of this dish.

Made lemon bar a few times, so far this came out the best.
A few change:
1. Shortbread crust: reduced the confection sugar to 3 table spoon
2. Lemon top: reduce sugar to 1/2 cup, use 4 TBSP lemon juice.

I didn't love this recipe. I don't feel like there was enough of the lemon mixture and the lemon taste wasn't terribly strong. The cooking times are a little long as well for the amount of filling. The dough part was fine, but I'll keep looking for another filling recipe.

OMG I LOVE THIS!!!!! I thought it would be hard to make Lemon Bars but it's so easy! I could eat these every single day! And it doesn't take a ton of ingredients. I did bake my crust for 18 minutes and then 20 minutes for the remainder of the time. I used a slightly larger dish to bake them in. I tried doubling the recipe the second time (I also used a larger pan to bake it in) and it didn't set right for me. I would suggest if you are doubling the recipe, make it in 2 smaller dishes rather than one larger one.

These were delicious! I followed the directions as written and only encountered one minor issue which was the bake time with the custard. I use a convection oven and should’ve checked sooner and I overbaked by 2-3 minutes; they have a light golden top. However, even overbaked, there still taste really darn good!!!

These are fantastic.  The shortbread crust really makes the bars.  I used Meyer Lemons and the flavor was outstanding.

I have made these bars several times and made them with a gluten free shortbread crust and double the curd. I also made a meringue with the left over egg white. Wow I am going to make these again.

More lemon, please!  These are ok, I'm not going to throw them out or anything, but they don't have that tongue cramping lemon tartness that I really wanted.  Maybe more lemon juice & zest next time...

Holy cow these are good!  My hubby’s 50th bday and he loves lemon desserts so I gave these a go... they were stinking amazing!  My son is not a fan of lemon and he was in having 3rds had powdered sugar all over his face (the sign of “YUMMMM”). Thank you for making a recipe that is specific in its instructions for people like me who want to do a good job but are not veterans to cooking.  Really appreciate it!  :)

Perfection! To date our family had enjoyed these lemon bars at least a dozen times. I've received many compliments on these little delights. I love to make exactly as written because they are perfect. However, I'm not. I have substituted coconut oil in the crust. Once I didn't have any Lemons on the house so I substituted 1/2 c. lemon juice and it worked fine in a pinch. I love this recipe is forgiving. Double the recipe in a 9x13 pan works great too. Thank you Chef John!

My Lemon  Bars were a hit at the our quilt club Christmas party. Very easy recipe and I am not a cook. I had a gazillion lemons on my tree this year and needed a recipe to try to use them up. Fun to make and easy!!

Made it for a party my daughter was having in her third grade class celebrating southeast culture and cuisine.  Turned out great the first time I made it even though I forgot to stir the custard for the recommended two minutes.   Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious! Doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13 pan for a large family holiday lunch, and everyone raved over it. I don't have a kitchen torch, so piped tiny meringues onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet and placed in the middle of each square after cutting.

Followed directions exactly and I love these squares.  I was looking for a relatively easy recipe with simple ingredients and this hit the spot.  The level of sweetness vs sour is perfect.   If I made it again, I would double the recipe for the lemon filling.  To give mine more volume, I topped it with  meringue using 2 egg whites and a tablespoon of sugar and broiled it in the oven till brown.   I took them to a party (and got lots of compliments) so now I have to make another for myself!  They were very lovely and perfect to take to Xmas parties.

I made this recipe twice in two days!  The first time, I made exactly as the recipe stated.  Delicious!!  The next day, I made a double batch using a 9x13 metal pan.  I also followed a reviewers advice of adding baking powder to both the crust and filling when I made them the second time.  Again, delicious but with a better "thickness".  A perfect ratio of sweet, tart, and chewiness of crust texture.

Made it with Meyer Lemons and it was delicious.  Had a lot of lemony flavor without being too sweet or too tart.  A lot of lemon bars have thick crusts on the bottom that make them hard to eat; this isn't one of them.  These lemon bars were easy to eat with a fork.  They had a bright yellowy presentation that was complemented with great taste.

Delicious and easy recipe. I added 1/3 cup of lemon juice instead of 1/4 for extra tartness.

I doubled the recipe and made a few adjustments. first i made the crust with 1 and a half sticks of butter and 4 tbs of coconut oil & 1 tbs of lemon zest and in the filling I used coconut flour instead of ap flour (used 1 tbs plus 1 tsp) and reduced the sugar to 1 cup and a half cup of stevia powder. It turned out great! Perfectly Sweetened! But I wish I tripled the filling as it had more crust than filling.

Delicious! I was pressed on time and only made the filling part. Poured it into a store bought shortbread pie crust. Served with freshly made whipped cream. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

It tasted good, but when I was making it, the shortbread dough was really salty and no matter how much i mixed it, it was just really crumbly. I spent about 10-15 minutes just trying to pick it because the dough would crumble each time I pricked it.

The flavor was wonderful but the lemon custard could use a little less sugar. In addition, next time I would foil my pan to make this easier to get out.

Did the baking soda addition (1/2 tsp to both crust and topping) and the recipe worked beautifully!

MOST EXCELLENT COOKIE BAR. I USED CALAMANSI OR FILIPINO LIME (SAME AMOUNT AS LEMON) WHICH GAVE IT THAT TART TASTE. THANKS CHEF JOHN FOR MAKING ME LOOK GOOD AT POT LUCKS....

Both my son and I loved the lemon bars.  I made it three times in one week.  Next time will add baking soda for thicker bars.  The flavor was delicious.  The first time I forgot the vanilla but I never even noticed the change in taste.  Saved the recipe to make again and again.  Tastes so much better than store bought boxed mix!

Wow sweet delightfulness. Used salted butter and did not add the 1/4 tsp of salt called for in recipe .Also I used three egg yolks and whites because my eggs were a little on small side = zero sum.  Yum Yum. No other changes. So easy to make and worth the drooling wait.

I have made it with and without the egg yolk in the lemon layer. We prefer it without, as otherwise there's a faint eggy smell when it's hot. But the taste is awesome, and my son asks for it at least twice a month!

I love anything lemony and this is a fantastic  recipe. I just cut up the bars to take to a friends for a BBQ and I'm struggling not to eat all the edges I cut off in one go because they're so delicious. Really easy to make, my only mistake I think was to leave them in a little too long so the top is browner than I'd like. This was just a confidence issue as the topping still seemed runny so I left it in too long. I also made meringue topping but I don't like the appearance on top of the bar so probably won't do that again. Would definitely recommend this recipe.

I will make changes next time by decreasing the sugar and increasing the lemon juice.  I would like it to be a little more tart.

Ok...they taste ok, but not very 'lemony' - & I even added extra zest!  My biggest complaint is that they aren't deep enough - too skinny and I even took one reviewer's advice and added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder to the custard!  Probably won't make these again.

So tasty and lemony! Citrusy perfection.  It was easy to prepare, but looked difficult. So impressed my guests. I only had a 9X9 instead of the 8X8 pan recommended so they came out a bit thin.  I also substituted margarine for the butter so it would be parve (kosher for meat meals). No discernible difference. Next time I'll try with the 9X9. Thanks Chef John!

I, like another reviewer said, found that the baking time was much too long for my oven.  About 7 minutes less would have been best.  These are good.  What lemon bar is bad?  I don't find them to be special.  If anything they are a bit sweet.  I like my lemon bars tarter.  I made these exactly as the recipe states.  I will make them again and use less sugar in the cookie crust, since I know that the tartness of the lemons can't be controlled.

I used a round spring form pan instead of a square pan. It's delicious! My daughter (who doesn't normally like lemon anything) says it's pretty good ~ so that's kind of a big deal right there.

I put the finished product in for 20 minutes, and by 17 it was brown and overdone. I hope that it tastes ok. But next time I will definitely put it in for a lot less, maybe 10 minutes.

Was anxious to try another of Chef John's recipes.  I followed the directions closely, but both the cookie layer and the lemon layer turned out way too brown.  I should have watched them more closely, but was trusting the chef's directions.  I may try this again but will really have to watch them.  I'm too embarrassed to take them along to the neighbor's house tonight.  They don't look very good.

The best lemon bars I've ever eaten. Super easy recipe. The shortbread crust was firm enough to hold the filling and didn't crumble. The filling was delicious and just the  right consistency and not runny like some recipes  I've tried. I will make this again!

I made this exactly to Chef John's recipe and it turned out exactly as Chef John said it would!  That doesn't happen to me very often. They are totally un-leave-alone- able. Will be making many more :o))

Great recipe! The bars were creamy on too and had a wonderful buttery short crust underneath. A beautiful yellow color from all that zest. I took one suggestion and added 1/4 tsp to each the filling and batter. I greased the pan and used parchment paper, which I greased and had not problem getting the bars out. I should've let it cool all the way before cutting (they'd look prettier), but we couldn't wait!

I almost gave up on this after making the crust because I thought I had done something wrong. Could not get the crust to stick very well to the pan so couldn't, get the holes pricked into it.  Looked  okay after the initial bake  so I went ahead and added the filling and finished baking it. IT came out of the oven and out of the pan perfect. Not sure why I was worried, as with every Chef John recipe I have made, no disappointment with this one - FABULOUS lemon goodness.

I followed the directions but doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan. I think using the baked goods  convection feature on my oven screwed up the custard, it was Not set at 25 minutes. Not sure how to salvage these without over browning them while firming up the curd.

I've never tasted a lemon bar before, so I haven't got anything to compare them with. But I loved them, have baked them twice no, so 5 stars it is.  I did find it a bit hard to get the bars out of the pan though, so the next time I lined with baking paper.

So sweetly lemony - not too sweet, mind you.  Per other reviewers I added 1/4 tsp baking powder to the crust as well as the filling.  This will be my "go to" lemon square recipe :)

These are the best lemon bars ever!  Simple to make, and I love the bits of lemon zest.  The crust is fantastic and the lemon is sweet and tart and sets up beautifully.  These are treats I bring to any party!

This is my go-to recipe for lemon bars now. They are just enough lemon and sweet. Last time, I pressed the crust down with a fork dipped in water and that worked better for me than using my fingers.

Cudos Chef John! I'm not a lemon desert person but my husband is. So I made them as a surprise, but I was the one that got a surprise because these were yum! I did add some lemon zest to the crust, but followed all the other directions. Will be a staple from now on! Thanks Chef John!!

Oh my gosh... This was sublime. The crunchy and salty shortbread pairs perfectly with the sweet and zingy lemon custard. I did not grease my pan enough because the side squares were tough to get out, but really, this recipe is flawless. I made these for my best friend as an end of the year gift because she is a lemon fanatic, and I am sure she will love them! Thank you so, so, soooo much, Chef John! Keep up the great work!!

I made no changes other than how I prepared base more as a pastry than as a cookie dough. Everyone who tried them really liked them & looked for  3'rds. And everyone also suggested they were a little too sweet. I will reduce sugar in the filling the next time.

These were so easy to make. I doubled the recipe for a 9 x 12 pan and didn't have to make changes. I made the crust in the food processor and it turned out so light and tasty. These bars are the perfect combination of sweet and sour

Definitely a keeper. I followed the recipe as written. Two fairly large lemons produced more than enough juice, but I was a little shy of the 1 tablespoon of lemon zest. It still came out with a wonderful, potent lemon flavor. Not too sweet, not too tart.

Lemon Bars have always been one of my favorite treats to make, but I've found one small addition that makes these even more incredibly delicious: I spread a mixture of two 8oz packages softened light cream cheese and 1/3 cup confectioners sugar over the top of the baked shortbread bottom, then poured the lemon custard over the top of the cream cheese layer; and continued with the final bake as suggested. 
Everyone Loves this cream cheese addition! They go fast!
Keep them tightly sealed in the refrigerator.

Honestly just follow the video, you won't be disappointed.  Best Lemon Squares yet.  Intense lemon flavour - make sure you use real lemons!  One thing I did do was line the pan with parchment paper, leaving a little hang over the edge so I could lift it out the squares to cut them.  They sliced beautifully. I did make the meringue and torched it  but prefer the powdered sugar instead.  Will be making these again for sure.

I am considered an excellent baker. While these bars were good they lacked the "wow" factor for me and my guests who came for Easter dinner. I will stick with my tried and true lemon squares recipe from an old Betty Crocker cookbook that always elicits rave reviews!

These bars were amazing ! I followed the recipe to a T, and everything was perfect. The lemon flavor was spot on, not too sweet or too tart. The crust was flaky and delicious. After I saw the recipe was only an 8x8 pan I decided to make a second batch, and I am glad I did. I brought this to Easter lunch and none were leftover. My new go to recipe for lemon bars

The flavor of the bars was okay, not great. I feel like the custard recipe should be doubled. I was disappointed at how flat the bars turned out. Also, I didn't measure my lemon zest so I may not have used a full 2 tablespoons, so the lack of lemony punch which I was promised may have been my fault but I feel that the amount of lemon juice is not enough. Overall, for my first lemon bar it's not terrible but compared to the lemon bar at my favorite bakery it is a total fail for me.

Okay, it definitely needs less time in the oven: 20 min + 20 min were more than enough. Next time I'll try 15 min + 20 min. I added coconut and cherries on top. Loved it. I was baking for our anniversary. My boyfriend really enjoyed it.

This was my first time and I was worried I had messed up somewhere in the middle, but it turned out great and people didn't believe I made them from scratch, but rather bought them from the store LOL.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Took it to a dinner party and it was a hit.  I served cool whip as an option.  Some really liked the cool whip others liked it plain.

I'm not normally a lemon bar person but my friend has a lemon tree and wanted to make them. After lots of research I decided to go with Chef John's recipe. We doubled it and made it in two 8x8" pans. They were phenomenal! The sugar crust on top is great, wonderful nice shortbread bottom. Could probably scale back the sugar on the lemon filling to about 3/4 cup.

I did what other reviewers suggested and used cold butter and cut it into the dough with my hands until crumbly. Then pressed down the dough into pans lined with foil.

I made these for my mother who loves lemon bars and she said they were the best she'd ever eaten.  High praise from a woman who is a wonderful cook herself.  I will definitely make these often and I wouldn't change a thing!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 t. baking powder to both the crust and the custard. I used 1-1/4 c. brown sugar instead of 2 c. white sugar in the custard. I also added about 3-4 T. lemon zest. I substituted coconut oil for butter. Crust took 25 mins. to cook.

These are the best lemon bars I have ever baked. I doubled the recipe my baking sheet was 18"x13" so I had to cut the baking time by about 5 minutes. They were thin but so tasty. I did not add the confectioners sugar on the first ones as I thought they tasted great just like that. The second one I made to give away and look prettier with the confectioners sugar. Thanks for the recipe. Followed it exactly (except for the baking pan).

I've never made anything but cookies before so this was exciting. I found it easier to just mix the butter and flower for the crust by hand and it worked great. The edges of my batch got a bit burned but I'm working with a 20+ year old oven. Mine didn't look super pretty but they tasted amazing. If I made more of the custard they would have been thicker but I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

I used chilled butter diced and mixed with the vanilla, sugar,  flour, and 1/4 tsp baking powder in the food processor. when packing into the pan, i used the bottom of a 1 cup measuring cup to press the bottom down good. no messy fingers.

This is an absolutely delectable recipe. I made this in a 9x9 pie tin  which worked very well. I love lemon. That being said this recipe was not overpowering nor was it understated. Just the right amount of lemon and sugar to make it not to sweet or lemony. The crust is soft and adds a good base for the lemon curd. When baked correctly the light sugar crust is a lovely light crunch which I love. I enjoy that this had three different textures and was not soggy in the slightest. This recipe is simple and perfect. This is a new go to lemon recipe when I have a lemon left over in the fridge.

Tastes great. Sometimes I try to do 50/50 between butter and veg oil and it still comes out ok. I also try to scale back on the sugar in the filling  about 25-50% and its still tasty. This recipe also works with any citrus fruit. I made this with oranges and it was great!

These are delicious, but ours looked really odd. The filling kind of sunk and ended up over the crust. So it get five points for taste, but only three for looks, averaging in a four.

Seemed like it would be complicated or difficult but not at all. Made exactly as recipe except I had to reduce cooking time on the crust. I didn't even put powdered sugar on it, me and my boys loved them. Ugly brownish top and all! Just what I was craving.

Great recipe. I adjust to make 30 portions and bake in a 9 x 13 pan. 6 eggs and to make measuring easier, I use a scale set to grams for the butter. Check with skewer because the bigger batch takes longer to cook (+- 20 minutes more). Another great recipe from chef John.

I strongly advise waiting for the lemon squares to cool a little before you cut them, but don't stick them in the fridge for too long for them to cool, otherwise they get too hard to cut. These lemon bars are a real crowd-pleaser.

I've made these a few times before and they were fantastic. My daughter made them today and we doubled the recipe... and they just aren't right. Don't get me wrong, they taste OK, but the recipe ingredients don't appear to be correct any more. It lists 2 Tbsps of flour twice, and doesn't list a cup of flour, however the first step references a cup of flour and butter. Same for the quantities of powdered sugar. 
(I know the directions don't double amounts when you double the serving size - just the ingredients, so that wasn't the issue.) 

The recipe isn't right as written now, I hope it can be corrected because the first few times I made them they were amazing.

These are the best lemon bars I've ever tasted!  I brought them to work and my coworkers couldn't get enough of them.  The shortbread was moist but crispy and the lemon was moist and chewy.  One trick I discovered, by accident, is that instead of using a zester, which I don't have, I used a regular grater, and added twice the amount of lemon peel -- like over a tablespoon or even more.  It causes the bars to be extra chewy and extra lemony.  Fabulous!!!

Same xperience....followed directions exactly. Lemon custard was excellent, came our perfect but crust was horrible, totally stuck to glass pan even though I'd oiled as noted, crust also fell apart so not real edible. Next time will try cutting the baking time for the crust in half and see if that helps some.

This recipe is an absolute beauty! It's a great recipe for beginners to join as it is super easy to make and it is almost impossible to screw up. Additionally, there is definitely no disappointing bites lemon bars is oozing with flavor in every single bite! The addition of the small amount of salt is a great one as it makes the shortbread portion extra delicious. Lastly, the tips infused in this recipe (such as poking the cookie with a fork to ensure that it bakes flatly) is a great addition by the chef!

Great job on the recipe! Looking forward to making this again!

Made this last night and it was frickin' AMAZING! It had the perfect balance of tart, sweet, and buttery goodness. I will be making a double batch next time! This will be the only recipe from now on. It's definitely a keeper! My family is already requesting another batch! Thanks Chef John!

They were delicious. I used self rising flour for everything requiring flour and it turned out great. The baking times were pretty exact for  my oven. I also used a little extra lemon juice and vanilla in the crust.

was too sweet and not lemony enough for my taste, but the crust was amazing! Will re-make but up the amount of lemon juice and lemon zest in the recipe.

These are simply the best! Easy to make and delicious. The crust is easy to make and really adds a lot to the fresh homemade taste. I generally don't change anything but sometimes add a little extra juice  for a touch more tang. I highly recommend fresh squeezed lemon juice. I prefer meyor they tend to be juicy and a touch sweeter.

I have made Chef John's Lemon Bars several times.  They are delightful.  I have made them for multiple occasions -  dessert, to take to the neighbors, and most recently for my son's school bake sale.  They are ALWAYS a hit and such a treat to eat!

Really nice, I would make again. Agree with another commentary about times as my base took 10 mins and my filling 15, but I am baking this here in the UK so maybe the average oven here is slightly different to the average US one.  Less time is just a perk if you ask me! Lovely, thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was the first time I have ever attempted these and I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan so there was a bit of guess work on the cooling times but they came out awesome....everything was easy to do and the flavor is terrific.....this will be on my holiday deserts list

Love it!  The crust made me nervous at first because it seemed darker than other crusts I have made, but holy fantastic!  Melt in your mouth perfection. I doubled the recipe and used two small lemons, so the juice ended up a little less than the required amount and the zest ended up more, can't say it mattered because first time I made them anyway and love extra citrus flavor.   My kids couldn't stay away from them and I kept cleaning their plates of the crust crumbs. Absolutely recommend.

These turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly except for adjusting the baking times for my oven. We all loved it, even my very picky 5 year old really liked it.

These turned out delicious!  I doubled the recipe, and baked in a 9x13 baking pan lined with greased tin foil.  They turned out perfect.  (I tried using parchment paper the first time, and the crust was not nearly as good).  They cut perfect once cooled.

Love this recipe and I have made it several times.  It makes the perfect lemon bars.  Today I substituted lime juice and zest since I had no lemon and they are just as yummy.  Thank you Chef John!

The first time I made these, the recipe turned out fine, but the shortbread to lemon ratio was way off, with the shortbread overpowering the lemon bars. The second time I made this I doubled the lemon filling, and that created the perfect ratio. 
When I made the meringue, I only put it on half of the bars, and left the other half plain. If you want enough meringue to go over all of the bars, I would add an extra egg white or two to get enough. I didn't have a kitchen torch, so I used the broiler in my oven, just keep a close eye on them as it only takes a few minutes to cook and burns quickly. 
 All in all, this is one of my favorite recipes and I've made it many times with great success.

I made this for  a harvest party and quadrupled the recipe in two 9" x 13" pans. I also did as others suggested and made the crust in my food processor, though I had to add another 1/2 stick of butter to each double batch. I made the mistake of not turning the two pans enough during cooking, so I ended up with some places being a little underdone with others being overcooked. High praise from harvesters!

Very good! I added a teaspoon of baking soda to the crust. (I meant to add one to the filling but I forgot. I accidentally melted the butter, but it turned out fine.) It's delicious right out of the oven. It hasn't had time to cool yet, but I'm sure that's wonderful as well!

Amended review: I've solved my problem of too much crust that sticks to the pan, and not enough lemon custard. I halved the shortbread recipe and used a small, 6 cup (approx. 9" x 3"), glass baking dish. I used butter flavored cooking spray, lined the dish with parchment paper - right up all sides, cutting slits to make square corners - and sprayed and floured that. I reduced baking time to 19 minutes. The whole thing lifted right out of the dish in one piece and I was able, for the first time, to cut neat little bite-size squares!
It's still utterly delicious but I'm able to serve it properly!

Anything as good as these lemon bars has to be rated 5 stars.  They are easy to make and evil delicious.  I wanted to eat the whole pan full.  They are way easier and just as lemony as lemon meringue pie.  Outstanding recipe.

Amazing and I made them Gluten free! Nobody could tell! I used gluten free all purpose flour. I cut back on the butter and substituted with a little coconut oil made for baking and cooking. Again...no one knew they were gluten free including my husband who says he can always tell gluten free foods. These were so flavorful and the crust was awesome!!!!! It was light and flaky. I may try to beef up the amount of lemon mixture because I also love that part but you can lose with this recipe. It's a crowd pleaser

I liked how this turned out! My only problem was poking the fork in the crust. The butter bits would stick to the fork and I had to throw out my first batch of crust because it became a big mess. The second time, I baked it for a bit and then poked the holes.

Delicious. Since I didnt have a lemon I used the bottled lemon juice instead of fresh squeezed and replaced the zest with lemon extract. I tasted it til I got the lemon flavor I wanted. I like it lemony ??. It turned out great. I will make it again.

Great lemon squares. I usually don't watch the videos but I did on this one and very glad I did. Chef John is totally entertaining in his videos and shows you exactly how things should look on each step of the recipe. The only thing was in my baking step, my custard was set but the top didn't have a thin white sugary crust like his did in the video. Other than that small detail they came out perfect and delicious!

These are beautiful.  Be sure to grease your pan well and don't over work your  crust. I had some sticking on the edges due to this, but it was my fault. I made these with my kids, and they loved making it.  The cleaning the knife trick in between cuts was really good. I will be making these again very soon. Thanks Chef John!

This is another one of Chef John's excellent recipes.  My husband rates very few recipes five stars, but this one he did.  I made it exactly as written and the results were perfect.

These were fantastic.  The directions were easy to follow.  I left the shortbread crust in the oven closer to 25 minutes to get it to a golden brown.  I will make this again.

Made it exactly as the recipe said and they were perfect. Pulled them out of the oven, left the house for 30 minutes, came back, and there were only two left. My family loved them.

They turned out great! I entered them in a work Bake Off for dessert bars and they got second place under some iced brownies. I think they were better than the brownies though!

The top of the custard turned a light brown vs in the recipe it says it is a white sugary crust (not sure why that is in there). Everything worked out perfectly and they were so gooey and yummy! Everyone was talking about them!

I tried this twice, following the instructions exactly, and both times the custard gets brown after only 10 minutes in the 350 degree oven. I do not get the white sugary top like the video says.

I only changed the flour, I used gluten free flour as opposed to the regular flour.  I don't see any difference in appearance or taste.  Will definitely make this one again !  Easy and usually have all ingredients on hand.  I also would say the baking time should be watched; depending on your oven, I only had to finish baking about 18 min before mine was finished baking.  Glad I checked, otherwise it would have been too done.

I ran out of sugar when I was whipping the eggs. Only had a half cup of sugar, but went ahead and finish them up.  I was surprised, they were great with just the half cup sugar.   The next time I make them I will only use 1/2 cup sugar with the eggs... who needs to eat all that sugar anyway.

I made these for my fiancée's family.. they were a hit.  The bars have a great balance of sweetness and fresh lemon flavor.  The custard is not too thick, and the bottom crust has a nice texture.  Highly recommended.

This was terrific and super easy.  Though I am all about scratch baking, I had been defaulting to a really good boxed mix for lemon bars because I wasn't wowed by any recipes. I decided to try again and am very pleased. They have a strong pure lemony taste and the texture of both the crust and the filling are perfect. I changed nothing in the ingredients. I do agree that they took a few minutes less time to cook than indicated. They were one of the first items devoured of a full cookie bar.

Did really well making these by following the directions.  Although, initially in spreading the crust it was very sticky and I had a hard time spreading it but then it finally it bonded. I also messed up (I forgot the two eggs) but I was able to add them at the last minute and the squares turn out pretty good. The test will be my daughter. I made them as a first surprise birthday present.

These were the tastiest & zestiest lemon bars I've ever eaten. I always loved the graham cracker crust; but no more! The shortbread crust is to die for. I love anything lemon; and the time spent making these were worth it! The top had a couple of bubbles and I didn't see a white crust...but then with powdered sugar on top it made no difference. YUM

Easter Sunday 2016--made in a 7x11 Pyrex with 1/3 whole wheat flour.  Think I will go back to the combined recipe I used in 2015 with the cream of tartar and possibly reduce or delete the whole wheat flour.

Delicious. The crust was too sticky and hard to spread around evenly was the only problem I had. I added extra lemon juice because I thought the filling only tasted like sugar at first. I would agree with other reviews that the baking times are too long, especially if you have a gas oven.

First time making these! I never even had lemon bars, but could imagine what they should taste like. Sometimes it is not a good thing to have a finished product in your head and THEN try to create it!

I figured I would try these and modify if they weren't what I wanted. They were GREAT! I did use a pastry blender for the crust...but not sure I had to with a shortbread. It did give a flaky type of shortbread crust though, rather than a hard cookie type. I may try the easier method next time just to see.

I also upped the lemon juice content. I simply tasted the mixture and decided I wanted mine a little lemony-er. I used 3 lemons and still one tablespoon zest. I was about 3/4 to 1 cup-ish worth (I just kept tasting until I liked it.) TIP! If you have tongs (like you might use for a bbq), you can squish your lemons in the middle of the arms of them and save your hands from squeezing! Let the leverage of the tongs help you!  

I also lined my pan with buttered parchment paper . I read reviews where people had them stick. The whole pan's worth lifted right out so I could cut perfect squares with the hot knife (I actually cut mine into smaller rectangular bars.)  The times listed were pretty accurate for me. I didn't get a brown crust--I just took it out when the top was completely set and porous looking (I just kept jiggling the pan in the oven near the end to see when it was firm.) I sifted the confectioner's sugar right out of the oven so it would stick. Beautiful presentation

I will make this recipe every time.  I doubled the recipe to make a larger batch and it worked out perfectly.  Next time I am going to quadruple the lemon layer for fun!

This is by far the best lemon bars I have ever had.  I love that the base is not really hard and it tastes so great with the lemon custard.  Frequently the custard tastes nice but the base is so solid it takes away from the delicate topping.  Not the case with this recipe.  I did use someone's suggestion about making the base in the food processor and it worked perfectly.  Tangy sweet lemon - what more could you ask for.  Thanks Chef John

Yummy!!! I've made this recipe 4 times so far, and it's just pure deliciousness. I have an older oven, so it took me 2 batches to get the timing down, but that's not a reflection on the recipe, just my ancient piece of junk oven.  If you like lemon meringue pie, then you have to try this! Thank you Chef John!

Next time use a bit less butter and reduce the cooking time for the crust. Increase the amount of flour by 50% in the custard; make sure the sugar fully dissolves; don't beat the custard too much with the mixer and let it stand for about 10 minutes to let the air bubbles escape. Consider using more zest.

I love this recipe.  I did a couple of changes though. I added some lemon zest to the crust and added some crushed walnuts also.  Pecans will work too.  Maybe next time I will double the amount for the custard.  Very tart and not to sweet.

If I could give these 10 stars I would! I ADORE lemon flavored baked goods but find most of them too sweet and not sour enough for my liking. These were perfection!!! I ate all of them in 3 days. It probably would've been faster but I was trying to savor the taste ?? I lined the pan with parchment paper so I wouldn't have any issues with sticking as I don't use anything nonstick. I also added a bit of lemon zest to the crust as other reviews suggested to give it a little more lemon kick. I only made them once because it can't be good for me to eat all them too often!

This was very tasty! I made 1 1/2 times the filling.And after reading someone's review ,substituted 3 tbls of the butter with coconut oil.(not melted)  It was the first time I ever used coconut oil in cooking and was pleasantly surprised by the subtle coconut flavor.

I was not into any lemon desserts until my wife asked me to make some lemon bars that she loves them. Since I am the baker in the family I decided to make them for her. I found this recipe and when I tasted these bars they were very delicious. I have made this several times.

I followed the recipe and only added some lemon zest sprinkled on the crust before baking. I took the bars to a friends home for dessert and they disappeared licklety split. Consensus was these bars are better than lemon meringue pie! I will defininitely be making these again......so easy!

I promised myself to never make cupcakes again. So I tried these. And they turned into perfect lemon cupcakes! Of course I did something wrong, but the cupcakes made me really happy even though I expected lemon bars!

We made these Lemon Bars this morning and they were fabulous. My wife felt like the crust was a little thick for the amount of lemon sauce. I thought they were perfect, but I love that butter crust. The taste of the lemon sauce was perfect. We followed the recipe to exactness and our crust turned out a little to brown, especially after the final cooking with the sauce. The edges were a little over done. When we pulled the finished product out of the oven we had kind of a brown bubbly top rather than a white sugar top as explained in the recipe, however after we dusted with the powdered sugar they looked great and tasted even better. I would give this a strong 5 Star.

I made this recipe for the holidays. My son and husband love citrus desserts but I do not like citrus at all. These were so delicious. I have made it 3 more times since then. Very easy recipe to follow.

This is by far the absolute best lemon square recipe EVER. Stop looking and make this one. You will not look again because this is the one to keep and keep making. I have made it twice, once with vanilla extract in crust as recipe states and once with almond extract. OMG!!! Lemon and almond, simply divine.. A WIN WIN recipe!!! YUMMO!!!

Best lemon bars I've ever had! They have plenty of lemon flavor and great texture IF you don't over bake them. The times stated were too long for my oven so watch it carefully the first time you make this recipe. I don't doubt that you will make it a second time!

Ok lemon bars but missing a strong contrast between sweet and tart. I made the best lemon bars recipe before this and the family decided it's our fav by far.

Made these today and I love them! I followed the recipe exactly except that I added just a little more lemon juice about 1/3 cup. Make sure to even out the bottom of the dough or else you'll have an uneven lemon bar with more dough than lemon custard filling!

Not too sweet, not too tart...just right! We made a double batch and I thought the crust was on the thick side, but overall this recipe is a winner. Will make these again. And again. And again!

Delicious. Used three eggs as opposed to 2 eggs and 1 yolk. Turned out delicious and the baking times were spot on! I'll definitely make again. Maybe I'll use two eggs next time.

These were delicious, but I had problems mixing the crust. I would suggest using melted butter instead of room temperature butter.

I don't make many deserts but I make this one semi regularly as people ask for it all the time. Perfect for taking to work for coworkers or other group occasions. *WARNING ADDICTIVE*

These were good, although not as tart as I expected. However, that's probably because I didn't have lemon zest. If you want a bit sweeter bar, leave that out and you won't be disappointed!

Awesome recipe. Thank you for posting. The ratio and taste is spot on. I tried another recipe on here called "the best lemon bar" and boy was that a lie; I should have used this recipe in the beginning.  I'll be using this recipe again for now on!

Perfect .... Chef John you are making  me into an impressive cook. My boyfriend has noticed and can't wait to see what's for dinner every night now. Now these bars are the perfect mix of sweet and sour. No need to change a thing. Will make them again absolutely !!  Deb

This was the best lemon bar we've ever tasted!! And on top of that - it's the first time I've ever made lemon bars! On the advice of another reviewer, I added half teaspoon more lemon zest and half a tablespoon more of lemon juice - from the crust, to the filling, to the clear recipe - this recipe truly earned my 5 star rating!

I had never made any lemon bars but my mom's were legendary. She's passed so I thought I would try my luck and this version looked easy. It was so easy and my husband took them to work and 2 co-workers said they were the best they had ever eaten. One of them said lemon bars were his favorite so to get "best ever" says it all. I doubled the recipe.

I just had my first taste of my first batch of these lemon bars and.... oh my goodness, they are GOOD. I'm so pleased with the results and how easy it was to make them (and I'm no master baker). I followed the exact recipe, no changes. I really can't imagine what would make these better. I will absolutely make these again and again!

Chef John had me @ "It's almost impossible to mess this up."  I had to make a dessert for our office Thanksgiving lunch.  They were a huge success.  It even made a couple of people fall off of their diet "wagons".  I took a suggestion from Ann and added lemon zest to the shortbread and I have to agree with the others, the cooking times were spot-on. Highly recommended.

I've made this twice, following the method exactly but with GF flour and margarine instead of butter. The first time, the topping didn't quite separate into the crust/curd properly but the second it did and was fantastic (just don't try stacking them in a container, even with baking paper!). Tasted great both times

Yum! These were so good and gone in a hurry.  I used salted butter because that's all I had but that was it for not following the recipe to a T.   I loved the crust, loved the filling.  All good.  I've been requested to make these this weekend and I'm sure I'm going to have to double or even triple this recipe.

This is my first time making lemon bars AND eating them.  I followed the recipe and it was absolutely delicious.  Sweet and sour with a great texture.  I plan to make more to gift this holiday season. I have tried many of Chef John's recipes and I have not been disappointed.  Enjoy!

Turned out great and very easy. That's an understatement!
Also tried with orange, lime and ruby red grapefruit.
Worked perfectly except need somehow to add more flavor to the grapefruit ones.
Definitely my go to lemon bar recipe from now on. Thanks, Chef John!

Add lemon zest to the crust
I thought the crust was a little too thick.  Next time use about 3/4 of the crust mixture

Best tasting and looking lemon bar I have ever made....Plus so easy. Love to make these and rich black bean brownies. The lemon bars served cold and the brownies warmed....one of each on a plate right after a rich soup and hearty brown/black bread meal. Tops of the meal nicely!!

Was delicious- tart, sweet and creamy. I added a little bit of lemon zest to the crust just because but other than that I made as directed. I thought a silicone spatula would work well for patting down the crust...it did not- use your fingers as directed. Making these bars again now...

I have made this a few times now and it is amazing every time. I do make the crust a little different from the rest of the suggestions. I keep the butter cold and pulse it with the dry ingredients in a food processor.  I get a consistently flaky crust this way. Also not that this is a change to the recipe but, when I doubled the recipe and made it in a 13x9 pan it came out better than ever. The crust  and filling layer were both thicker than usual, this just made the whole thing extra yummy.

I made the recipe just as  it is-this was one of our favorite treats my mom made.  They turned out exactly the same. YUMMMMM.  I love the buttery crust with the little tartness from the zest, a great combination.  Grammecakes

I slightly burned these lemon bars and they still came out amazing. I'm on my second try right now.. I think the oven-time in the recipe is a little too long.

I've made this recipe many times, and I love it. The only thing I change is that I use doTerra lemon oil instead of using lemon zest. The first time I made these I used zest, and it took forever...

Made these lemon bars for a family get -together.  In attendance, a pastry chef, two lemon bar fanatics and several other hardcore dessert lovers. They all raved that these were the best lemon bars they had ever tasted.  Not messing with perfection !

I made these last night! Everyone is in love with them. It was my first time making lemon bars too :-) Chef John's suggestions were great!

I used a teeny bit less sugar in the lemon curd and it balanced perfectly when i dusted the bars with confection sugar. 

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 baking dish.

I am immediately going to make even more. The demand is high haha

Chef John you have done it again!!! This is so easy to make and it came out great! My only problem was I did not have a pan the size specifications noted in the instructional video so my crust came out a little thin.  Other than that they tasted awesome. This is another Chef John masterpiece.

This was good. A little too sweet for my tastes though, and it was quite sticky on the teeth. Next time I would reduce the sugar by a 1/4 cup and add some more lemon zest.

First review ever for me, but I just had to!  I loved these lemon bars!!  Just made them tonight and they came out perfect!  It really is a perfect blend of sweet and tart with the buttery taste of the crust.  Delicious!  Since my oven often cooks faster, I had to take my crust out at 15 minutes and the custard at 20 1/2 minutes to avoid overcooking and burning.  I may try to add more lemon juice or zest next time since my hubby likes his lemon bars on the tart side.  Thank you, thank you for this wonderful recipe!  Really appreciated the clear and detailed instructions- they really helped.  Considerably easy to make and so yummy!

My kids LUV!!! These lemon bars. I tried Chef Jeff step by step one night. The lemon bars were gone faster then it took me to make them. So I told the kids id make some more. I did trying to cut corners ( I didn't want to go to the grocery store.) I used the lemon in a bottle and I omitted the powder sugar in the crust. Wow talk about a HUGE difference My Kids said Please don't change Chef Jeff Lemon bars lol. they don't taste right. So thanks for a quick and wonderful dessert.

I've been on the hunt for a great lemon bar/square recipe.  I've tried many and this one by far is perfection.  Delicate flaky crust and the perfect balance of tart and sweetness.  If you want a homerun, this one will hit it out of the park!  Thank you for sharing Chef John.

I just finished it but with no sugary top ;( maybe I overbaked it. I used brown sugar instead of white as well. ;( on the bright side, it smells delicious. Very impatient having to wait for it to cool! Can't wait to taste it!

So good!!!!!  My kids just begged for a third bar! My husband raved about them and then snuck off with his own third bar about a minute ago.  My "room temp" butter was probably a bit soft- was out on the counter all morning in Southern California- but otherwise I made absolutely no changes. The only thing I will change next time is to use both ovens and make two batches.  (I'm a little nervous about doubling the perfect recipe). Times were exactly right and with my liberal use of non-stick spray, they came out of the glass pan easily.

So delicious. I followed the recipe and these are truly delicious. Everyone I make them for absolutely loves them. I'm going to make them again, but alter the recipe a bit adding raspberries. Yum! Thank you for this recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly. I think the shortbread is perfect, but the  custard isn't tart enough for my personal taste! I will add more lemon & zest next time. If you like a sweeter custard, make the recipe as is.

The taste was excellent.   I would like it to be even more tangy... but this was fabulous.  I can always trust a Chef John recipe.... then it comes down to my own cooking skill.  I sometimes rush ahead and neglect exactly as explained... I get so excited to get to the finished product... sometimes I may even get a tad lazy in my rush...  I used the ingredients in the recipe to a "t" except I did put a pinch of salt in the lemon filling... I don't think it effected the final chemistry of the product.  I used my kitchen aid stand mixer to put everything together instead of a bowl and wooden spoon... is there any way to over mix any of the components?  I did think the final product was great... the crust was not to sweet. I would have liked the whole end product to have been taller with more lemon curd... did I do something wrong?  Chef John!

First lemon bar recipe I have tried. Turned out great! However, I would use less flour for the crust for a 8X8 frame. My crust was thicker then I like. All in all very good. The filling was perfection.

These are amazingly delicious. The crust was perfectly flaky and a great base for the tart lemon custard. It only took about 20 minutes for my crust and 20 minutes for the custard. I did have issues with the top of my custard browning, I may try a lower heat setting my next attempt. But overall, very delicious. I did sub 1/4 cup coconut oil in the crust, gave them a nice hint of coconut.

Very nice I've tried several lemon bar recipes over the past several months this is my favorite. Good balance of lemon tang and sweetness, not overly sweet like some other recipes.

The crust on these is awesome. I rarely use all purpose flour, so I subbed in 3/4 c white whole wheat flour and 1/4 c almond flour . . . so good! The end result was about 50% crust and 50% lemony goodness. I love lemon, so next time I will try one-and-a-halving the filling recipe (and baking a tad longer) to get a thicker layer of lemon. Might also add more lemon zest.

Delicious! I didn't change a thing.  The crust was a little crumbly but otherwise a great dish full of flavor and everyone in the house agreed. Note: I ended up using a spatula to press the crust in the baking dish.  I tried to use my fingers and the dough starting sticking to my wet fingers.  The custard set but, like another reviewer's comment, the thin white sugary crust did not develop on top.

My favorite bakery changed their lemon bars. Glad they did or I would  have not tried to make my own. These were better than any bakery.  Stuck to the recipe as is, the times are perfect.  So very good.

Cant wait to try it! My lemon tree is busting at the seems with lemons! I have resorted to setting them out on the road for passersby to take! So all the lemon recipes I can find are helpful.
The video is the best and his sense of humor was great!

It tasted pretty good overall, but when I baked the lemon filling, it did not get the white crispy top. Instead, it turned bubbly and brown. When I let it cool for quite a while, the filling sank to the bottom and the crust was at the top, and when I tried to cut it, it all crumbled into little pieces.

I like this recipe. Added a little more lemon juice and zest to the custard. Also added baking powder both to crust and filling as others suggested. I do not moisten my fingers to press down crust into pan as this gets very messy and most of the crust ends up on my fingers. Just press it down with dry fingers.  Don't make holes with fork otherwise crust comes up with fork. With the convection bake oven crust only takes about 15 minutes. Overall good recipe.

This recipe was easy to make. The crust turned out a little over done, but overall, they taste delicious. We doubled the vanilla. I highly recommend these for a tasty, but simple desert!

Very good I thought it would be to tart but with the crust and the powdered sugar it was perfect.

I did the recipe as stated, but pulsed cold butter into flour mixture for crust as another review suggested. Wow... what a great recipe! It's definitely a keeper.

Loved this recipe!! My top favorite dessert are lemon bars and this recipe was my first homemade version! I followed recipe exactly! Only thing I did different was doubled the crust because I love a thick cookie underneath the filling!

This recipe was wonderful! It is like Lemon Meringue Pie but with half the hassle. One thing I did to make baking a bit easier was instead greasing the baking pan I just lined it with wax paper. It just slid right out and was much easier to slice. Ensure to watch both crust and filling when baked as the times are subject to change (crust: 18 mins, custard: 20 mins).

I made this recipe for my Husband's 30th birthday since he isn't a fan of cake. Everyone loved it!!! The lemons I zested & squeezed were very sour but the sugar balanced it out perfectly for a delicious mouth puckering sweet & tart lemon custard topping!

These were really good. The crust wasn't crumbly, but rather soft and buttery, which made it nice and easy to press into the bottom of the pan. I didn't need to use water on my fingers either. I did not get that white crust on top of the custard, it turned light golden brown. Not ugly, but not like in the picture or description either.
The only thing I'll change next time is cut back on the sugar. The bars were awfully sweet.
I didn't grease the pan, I used non stick aluminum foil. The bottom of the bars didn't stick, so all I had to do was carefully separate the edges from the foil. Very easy.

My crust was never cookie crumble like, but still tasted great.  In the custard,  I think I expected more of the lemon flavor.  I wanted the lemon to really bite me!  It was great, but I think I want to keep searching for that special lemon bar recipe; however, in the meantime...this will certainly do!

Oh my... these are SINFULLY good! I followed the recipe, but I only had granulated sugar on hand, which I tried pulverizing with a mortar and pestle. They came out a little too sweet, but still oooey and gooey and with a wonderful crust!!!

Mmm-Mmmm! I loved the sturdy crust on this one. I'm going to be brave and half the sugar next time and see what happens. I found these a little too sweet. After reading other reviews I kept a close eye on the cooking time and the directed times worked perfect. Thanks for another one Chef John!

I love lemon bars, but had never made them before. These turned out perfectly on the first try! My only comment is that I had to reduce the bake time by a few minutes, but that might just be my oven.

My first batch was overcooked by following the listed baking times.  Second batch was improved by reduced times on crust and custard.  Also, the second shortbread batch I grated butter into flour prior to blending.  I liked the results.

Yum these are the best lemon bars I have ever made!!!! Crust is flaky and filling is just the right texture. I watched them closely while cooking both the crust and then again with the filling. Mine were done 7 minutes early on the crust and 5 minutes early with the filling.

This was the best lemon bar recipe I've tried, I used lemon juice since I didn't have fresh and It still turned out delicious. I also doubled the recipe and added a half tsp of baking soda to the lemon and cookie parts for added thickness. great!

These were great! Had to take them to work and share with co-workers so I wouldn't eat them all myself, everyone at work loved them. Perfect balance of sweetness and tartness.

This was a BIG hit at our house. The crust was flaky yet sturdy enough to hold up the filling. The filling sets up fairly firm. Holds together very well as finger foods. My youngest is a lemon square fanatic and she just couldn't get enough of these. These are excellent for company fare.

Had some lemon juice in my frig I had to use up before it expired, so found this recipe. I doubled the recipe & put into a 9x13 pan. I didn't have any lemon zest, so put in two extra tbls of lemon juice. Tasted awesome, but came out of the pan very crumbly & hard to get all of the crust out entirely. If not for that fact, would have given these 5 stars based upon their taste.

Super yummy, although I with the crust was a little less thick and the lemon filling had more. I think next time I'll adjust that myself.

These are absolutely fantastic!!  Just the perfect ratio of the crust and the lemon filling.  I made a batch 2 days ago, hubby told me I need to make another batch today.  Best part, I had free lemons from a co-worker.. made this even better!

Amazingly simple and delicious lemon bar recipe. The crust is buttery and the perfect texture and the lemon is tart and delicious. The only modification I made was to add a little bit more zest because I like them really tart.

I have never been a big lemon fan but I found myself with an excess of lemons and decided to make this desert.  Let's just say that Chef John changed my view of lemons forever!  These lemon bars are delightful and I would highly recommend this recipe to all my friends!

I have been tasked with bringing "my" lemon bars to Thanksgiving for at least five years.  I've used a Land O' Lakes inner-carton recipe for lemon bars which everyone loves and I've had since I don't know when.  However, I can tell just by reading the differences that Chef John's will be better in pretty much all respects than that great recipe.  Richer, and tart-er, in the right places.  I can't wait to bring this version! Through AllRecipes, Chef John brought me the best oven recipe on earth for BBQ Baby Back Ribs, so I trust him completely.  Still, I plan to make a test batch of these, "just in case!"  ;D  

PS:  They "passed the test" exactly as written, to the point that I'm bringing them today to Mother's Day!  They're perfect for a Spring garden party, which is what we're doing.  By the way, PRICKING THE CRUST before baking it was a key step that I'd never used on my former recipe; it makes a tremendous difference in the outcome!  
 
Thank you again, Chef!

Just a little snippet.. I like my lemon treats tart, like really lemony. So I reduce my lemon by almost half on the stove and cool.. They are so awesome! That's the only thing I did. I didn't try them without doing that, it's just what I always do, and they are THE BOMB!

I decided to make these on a whim...am I glad I did!! Best recipe for lemon bars ever!! The only bit I altered was using 3/4 cup sugar instead of a full cup. My friends and family  love whenever I make them! What are you waiting for? Go make them ASAP!

I agree with the other reviews; these are delicious.  They were easy to make and yes, the cooking times are spot on.  The crust tastes great and holds up really well for serving.  The custard portion is the perfect sweet-tart combination.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 and it they came out great.

Oh my goodness! I made them as set forth in the recipe and they were delicious! The timings given were spot on and the shortbread crust is awesome- flaky and very tasty! I can't wait for my son to try them. He loves most things lemon and these are to die for!!!  Great recipe!

I thought these were okay.  Not quite lemony enough for me and not really sweet either.

Delicious!  These are the best lemon bars I have ever eaten.  They have a strong lemon flavor and are easy to make.

Super easy and delicious. My crust layer took about 5 extra minutes to cook, but other than that, these went exactly as the instructions said.
