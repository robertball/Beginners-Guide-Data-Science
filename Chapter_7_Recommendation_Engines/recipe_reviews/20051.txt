I made a double batch of this for New Years and it went over really well.  Some people even ate with veggies.

This is really good.  Husband and kids like it too for a snack on crackers.  I do use green onions though instead of diced white or yellow onion.

I used reduced fat cream cheese, Buddig beef and green onions. After tasting it, I threw in another package of the Buddig beef and some homemade ranch dressing mix. It's a little bland without it. This was a great way for me to use make a great cracker spread for the boys this Sunday. NOTE: I used Kaukauna cheese spread.

This was very good.  I used Johnsonville mild Italian sausage instead of beef.  I would call this more of a spread than a dip.  It is too thick to dip chips into.  It's better used as a spread for bread or crackers.
