This was pretty good and easy to make. Next time I will mash some of the potatoes because my soup did not thicken. I did not have half and half so I used half heavy whipping cream and half regular milk. I also omitted the parsley and used fresh green onions. I did season it a bit more with salt and fresh cracked pepper.

Great recipe. But I ended up taking an immersion blender and blending the soup up a little bit. The potatoes were too large in the recipe.
