I'm going to base this on what this SHOULD have tasted like. I'm posting this in case anyone else is as ignorant as I. Cream of coconut comes in a version which apparently has loads of sugar added. Didn't realize until I tasted this soup which was SO over sweet. Hugely disappointed. Will try again another day!  Be sure to use coconut milk. Or if you can find cream of coconut be sure to read the label.

Lovely vegan recipe, took 2h, not 3h - I left the squash in the oven a little longer, as suggested in the tip, so the soup was ready to blend pretty soon. Used trader joe's spicy curry sauce and just one can of tj's light coconut milk.

I made this soup for my family, and it was outstanding.  Not only did it have complex flavor but made the house smell wonderful!  I have been searching for a soup such as this for quite a while.  I did make some modifications, simply because I didn't have the ingredients on hand.  I'll try to make it correctly the next time around.  The modifications I made included:  using cubed organic butternut squash from Costco (still browned a bit in oven), a regular yellow onion and a couple shallots instead of the "sweet" onions, Suki's curry sauce was used for the curry along with a bit of water, Gala instead of Granny Smith's, and dried cilantro instead of fresh.

I LOVE this recipe. The only thing I changed is using about 4-5 TBS of curry POWDER instead of the paste and I knocked it down to 1 can of coconut cream - just to lighten it up a little bit.  I also have served the left overs over brown rice and poached chicken breast...delicious!

This was so good i've made it twice it two weeks.

The first time I used Japanese Red Kuri squash and onion soup broth. But since i don't have an immersion blender, I roasted the squash til completely tender and soft (about an hour and 15) and ran it though the blender with some of the broth. 

The second time, I used butternut but i had forgotten to snag the apples at the store, and being the lazy person I am, I pulled out some chopped white guava from the freezer, thawed it and added it to a pan of carmelized onion to help deglaze the pan & cook the guava before running it through the blender with some broth.  Turned outI like it with guava better than apple

I still have a gallon of frozen guava so I'll be saving it for more soup!!

I made this in my Insta pot. I sautéed the onions and the garlic and then place the rest of the ingredients into my pot. I then set the cooker on manual 15 minutes high and then pressure release after 10 min. Super fast!

I'd totally make it again, although I found it didn't need to cook nearly as long as it says.

Made as directed, with only one exchange: I didn't have curry sauce, so I used 4 oz of curry paste.

TL;DR: cut recipe in 1/2 for 8 servings. Use coconut milk - not coconut cream, add Italian sausage for meat eaters.

First, this makes a HUGE VAT OF SOUP. My 10 qt stock pot was completely full. This is not 8 servings of soup. It is easily 16 to 20 servingsI used actual coconut cream. As another posted, coconut is very sweet, coconut cream is intensely sweet. (it's not necessarily added sugar, it's naturally sweet) So 2 jars of coconut cream makes for a very sweet soup. I like it, just be aware. Also, coconut cream, in temperatures of less than 80°F, is rock solid. Melt it in a hot water bath before adding to your soup or you will never get it out of your jar. 2 jars was way too much. Use one. This turned into a very very thick soup with 2 jars of coconut cream.  Since the directions are "pour coconut cream into the soup" I think the OP means coconut MILK.

Third: if you are in a mixed household, saute up some Italian sausage to mix into the soup for the meat eaters. It pairs beautifully.

Delicious! I had almost everything on hand without having to make a trip to the grocery store. The only thin I changed was that I used curry paste. I did not have curry sauce. Made this for my two vegetarian daughters. I am sure they are going to love it!

It was a huge hit and numerous guests asked for the recipe.  My husband who doesn’t like anything curry, raved about it. I definitely will make again however next time I’ll try cooking the squash fully and scooping out of skin.

This is the first time I've reviewed a recipe, because it's just that good! I made it almost exactly as written, with a few exceptions to accommodate what I had on hand as well as cutting the recipe in half. I used chicken stock, curry powder and coconut milk, and then garnished with hemp oil and coconut chips. So delicious!! I also had a really obscure ingredient in my pantry that I never use, but for perfectly in this recipe...coconut flavored white balsamic vinegar! A couple teaspoons amped up the coconut flavor while cutting the richness but didn't leave a hint of vinegar. The soup was amazing without it, but with it was outta this world!

Pro Tip: in any recipe always fry your curry powder or sauce in with the onions, after they are translucent, before adding the liquids. It brings out a lot of the flavors of the curry that would otherwise be missed!

Delicious!  I am on Weight Watchers Simple Start so I used Fage plain Greek yogurt  in place of the coconut milk. I used chicken broth instead of veggie.  I only had a 3.5 oz package of the Golden Curry.  I'll be making this again and will try it with the added curry.  0 WW points!!
