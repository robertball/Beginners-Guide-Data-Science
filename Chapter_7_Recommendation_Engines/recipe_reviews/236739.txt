I used the slow cooker for another corned beef recipe, so I put this one in a 225 degree oven all day, using a roasting pan that was sealed tightly with foil. I didn't add cabbage. I've been avoiding flavored liquid, like beer, for corned beef because I never liked the end result. I didn't know what to expect using beef stock and assumed the other recipe would be preferable. Nope; this was much, much better. This will be the only corned beef recipe I'm using from now on. It was delicious. I cut the final step to 1/2 hour because I got nervous that it would dry out; you can judge for yourself.

My husband requested this for St. Patty's Day.  I've never even eaten Corned Beef before, nonetheless prepared it.  This recipe was easy to follow, and unlike the "boiled dinner" I refused to eat as a child, this actually looked appetizing!  Even my two picky daughters loved it.  The only changes I made to the recipe were that I didn't have beef stock, so I substituted 4 beef bullion cubes and a Guinness beer with enough water to get within the recommended 2" of the top.  Also, I minced 12 cloves of garlic in with the olive oil before I brushed it on the meat and potatoes (prior to roasting.)  We will definitely be making this again!

I have been making corned beef for decades. I followed this recipe to the letter and ended up with a tough, dry(yes, dry., which I could not believe given the cooking method) piece of meat... I cannot think of anything I missed, but it did not turn out well for me.

It was okay.  I need to remember to soak a pre-corned beef, to get more of the salt out.

Great concept.  Of course, you do have to adjust the baking times, based on the size of your roast.   This turned out awesome!  I added carrots and did large 'rustic' cuts on the vegetables to prevent overcooking.   I did drizzle honey a couple times over the beef during the oven time.  Puts a nice glaze on the meat.  My wife was never a big corned beef fan.  Now she is, and I don't have any leftovers for hash!  Will be making again soon!

In a large pot, brown the beef brisket first on all sides to retain the flavor of the meat, add chopped onions and water to cover brisket. Boil on low for 3 hours with the condiment package that comes with it, then remove meat and set aside to cool to slice. While meat is cooling, add a can of corn beef for additional flavor and a can of beef broth.  Add the cabbage and cook for 45 minutes and then add the potatoes, cut bigger than bite size, so that they don't break apart in pot. We put the sliced beef brisket back in the pot the last 30 minutes.  When the potatoes are cooked, you are ready to enjoy a very tasty dish.

I choose this recipe to make this year and I really liked the taste the beef stock added to the cabbage and potatoes.  I also added the spice package included with the corned beef.  My only complaint was that the corned beef remained tough after roasting in the oven so I returned everything back to the crock pot until meat became tender, because I was afraid the meat would become too dry.
