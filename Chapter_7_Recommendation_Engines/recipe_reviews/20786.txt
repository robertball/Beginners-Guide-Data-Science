These were excellent after I tweaked the recipe a little (since others said it was bland). I doubled the amount of nutmeg and added the same amount of cinnamon.  I then added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and doubled up on the sugar as well.  I chopped up the apples instead of slices, to have a more "fritter" feel to them.  I also ended up adding a little more milk to the batter because they were coming out raw inside.  Once I did this they cooked all the way through very nicely.

Made these tonight for the family and everyone loved them. I added cinnamon to the batter & diced the apples. I put the diced apples in the microwave for 4 minutes to soften them up a bit, then added the cooked down apples & liquid to the batter. It was a perfect consistancy. Dropped them into the oil using 1/4 measuring cup. this made a good sized fritter. Thanks for a great recipe!

this recipe is AWESOME! i have my husband's coworkers taking shifts to run to my house and pick up fresh batches out of the skillet as i make them, it's an event in our house now. THANK YOU PAT! my kids adore these too. if you have trouble with the batter sticking, pat the apple slices dry with a paper towel first. i like a little cinnamon in the batter too, and if you dust these with powdered sugar then drizzle with caramel topping, you will have an absolutely heavenly treat! wish i could give it six stars!

Well... put me, my frydaddy, my 4 old, and my 2 year old against this recipe and we all came out alive, that says alot.   It was really easy, but took a while with my smaller frydaddy (only 3 dnuts at a time). Other than that it's a wonderful recipe, kids love it!  Thanks Pat!

I used Granny Smith apples and they didn't come out very sweet.  They were still very tart. If I try it again I may use different type of apples.  I also thought the batter didn't stick very well to the apples.  I followed the recipe directly and the batter was very thick and sticky (to my fingers, not the apples).

I didn't like this recipe at all.I thought the fritters were too greasy and the apples went mushy inside.

Wow, this recipe was so delicious! I was amazed how easy and quick they were to make!!  I did not have confectioners sugar, so I used a mixture of white sugar and cinnamon to dust the fritters. They turned out wonderfully!

Great and so easy!  I made these especially for my husband and friends, but even I loved them and I'm not an apple fan.  They were gone in a flash.  These would be great for fall.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I was trying to replicate the Apple Fritters that the convenience store chain, QuikTrip, used to have.  The ones they have now are just not the same.  This recipe came darn close with the couple of modifications I made.  As suggested, I doubled the nutmeg and added 1 tea. Cinnamon.  I also increased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  As suggested by another reviewer, I diced the apples and microwaved them for 4 minutes, then put them, liquid and all, into the batter and dropped the batter in 1/4 cupfuls into hot oil.  Instead of dusting with sugar when done, I made a glaze of 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 Tbsp. light corn syrup and 2 Tbsp. water, and drizzled that over the fritters.  It dries to a sweet, slightly hard and crunchy glaze on the fritter.  My husband says these are closer to the old QT fritters than what they have in the store now, but could be fried just a bit thinner and crispier.  Next time I'll add one more apple and see if that doesn't thin the cakey-ness down just a hair.  Great recipe!

Brilliant. What a finding! This recipe is REALLY GOOD. However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind:
- Coat apples with a thin layer of batter (shake off excess batter)
- Fry in medium heat 
- Be patient! If you don't, the apples will be golden on the outside but NOT tender from the inside.  
- Add cinnamon to powdered sugar for an extra dimension.
ENJOY!

Fried apple fritters, good, but as others said, the batter was kind of tasteless.  I even added cinnamon & nutmeg to the batter after reading others comments.  It really didn't help.  Perhaps adding sugar & cinnamon to the apples THEN dip in the batter, might work?  I'll try that next time!

YUM!  YUM!   YUM!
I cut this easy recipe in half...except for the amount of sugar...I accidently added the amount for the full recipe, but they were yummy! I changed the recipe a little. I used Empire  apples and cut them approx. 1/4 inch thick. I also added 1 cap full of vanilla extract. I used white powdered sugar to sprinkle on top. Just for the record...I didn't have a problem keeping the dough on the apples, as I have read from other people. As I dipped I fried...I tried dipping and then letting them sit...that didn't work. My husband LOVED them, and he is not one for cakes and donuts. He was eating them before I could sprinkle the sugar on them. I plan on making these often!

Great fritter recipe. Just changed a few things. I cut up the apples into big chunks and tossed them with cinnamon sugar before adding to the batter. I also increased the amount of sugar in the batter to 1/2 cup and added a teas. of vanilla. My boyfriend went crazy for them!

This recipe is great, and easy to make. My husband even helped out and they still came out good.There is one change I would make to the recipe. Add a Tbsp. of cinnamon to the batter for extra flavor. Thanks Pat!

AWESOME! I added a few changes...doubled the sugar, added 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of vanilla. Diced the apples as suggested in other reviews. microwaved them for a couple minutes. Used a spoon and dipped them into the oil. half way through I realized the batter would make a great doughnut so I ended up making lil doughnut balls just by dropping the batter into the oil and ending up making funnelcakes also by drizzling the batter into the oil over and over till it covers the top!!! YUMMY!

my children love these they call them apple doughnuts. this is almost the same recipe my grandmother taught me, the only thing that is different is she soaked the apple slices over night in bourbon or amaretto depending on what she had.

Great recipe!  I did make a few changes.  I only made half the recipe, and I didn't use apple rings.  I cut one medium-large apple into small chunks, and one banana into small chunks.  Split the batter in half and mixed them separately.  I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg, and as I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand, I added a little more white sugar to the batter.  They were excellent--we ate the banana ones first and I feared that the apple ones wouldn't be as good because I used an Ida Red (kind of mushy and flavorless compared to a baking apple like Granny Smith), but they were delicious, too. Can't wait to try it with peaches!  Thanks!

these came out just like the ones at our favorite apple orchard, I changed 2 things, first I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg in the batter and second I prepared a tray of cinnamon sugar to coat them in instead of powdered sugar, My kids loved them , I had to hide the so they didn't eat them all before my husband came home! one tip for those of you who had problems with them sticking: make sure tour oil is deep enough for the rings to float in it, the first ones I made stuck to the deep fryer basket, so I just lowered it and dropped them right into the oil, they floated and no more sticky mess, (except on hands but they are easily washable : )...) thanks alot for an excellent way to use up extra apples!!

This recipe was pretty good and easy to make. It fried well and the ending result was okay but it lacked flavor. I dusted it with cinnamon and powdered sugar and gave it a honey drizzle. After all that it was great. This recipe is a great base. I think it would be really good with a caramel drizzle

This was great!! I used bananas for the fruit and it turned out perfect though I didn't have nutmeg which would have probably given it that extra kick also I drizzled chocolate syrup instead of powdered sugar making this a great and super easy desert!!

Very yummy!  I added about 1 tsp cinnamon and a bit more sugar as I was using Granny Smith apples.  So far, I've only cooked about half the recipe (we're stuffed full of fritters!) and am going to refrigerate the rest for another morning.  I chopped the apples and added them directly to the batter.  Generous tablespoons seem to be a good size to cook quickly and thoroughly.  Any bigger and they still are gooey inside when they're done outside.

I, too, did as others posted and diced the apples, adding them directly to the batter, and pouring out with a measuring cup. Instead of dusting with confectioner's sugar though, I made it into a glaze and coated the fritters with that. Tastes much closer to the doughnut shop fritters that way, and that's what I wanted.

This is a good recipe to start with.  I doubled the nutmeg, added 2 tablespoons of cinnamon to the batter. And one tablespoon of each cinnamon & sugar to the apples (which I diced by the way), added a tablespoon of vanilla to the batter. I dumped about a 1/2 cup at time to the oil for a good size fritter & instead of sprinkling powdered sugar I added some milk to the powdered sugar to make a glazed, With these modifications this is a five star recipe.

I made this with a gluten free flour mix, soy milk and "flax eggs". This makes the recipe healthier, it's great for those with allergies and it really tasted great!

This recipe made great apple flapjes (Dutch apple fritters) for our new years celebration! Just added a little bit more milk since the batter was thick.

Great tasting batter. Had problems getting it to stick to one side of the apple. Tried both rings and slices, but the results were the same. Batter reminds me of funnel cake batter. Very good!! Batter was thick, so had to be careful to cook thouroughly when frying. If too much batter was applied, the outside would be golden, but the inside still had uncooked batter in it.

Wow..What an adventure this was.  I first made them according to recipe but had decided to make them and then put a brown sugar sauce over the top as several people had mentioned.  This was a disaster.  It made the Fritters soggy ....so I put them in the oven hoping to dry them out a bit...and basically ruined them.  Those that were not ruined...were not great.  I scapped the whole batch and started over..following the recipe to the letter..and the end result was a giant "so so" at best.  I will continue looking for a great recipe.

I thought these were pretty good. I made a couple changes: I took some other reviewer's advice and added 1T cinnamon and I made the brown sugar sauce from this site and used it as a dipping sauce. Wonderful!

Unbelievably DELICIOUS.   I halved the recipe since there are just two of us and it turned out perfect.  I did cube up my apples and put them in microwave for 2-3 minutes to precook them a little as one other person suggested and that made it great.  I just stirred the apples into the batter which came out great.   Have a deep fryer, but just put them in frypan with the bottom covered with canola oil and flipped them over like pancakes.  SUPERB RECIPE!!!!

I eat them every chance I get at the market.
They use what ever apple is in season at it's peek.
The bigger the apple the better...and I eat them with no sugar...just maple sirup and french vanilla ice cream. WOW...talk about tasty

this was great!  I used whole wheat pastry flour and I added some cinnamon to the batter.  Also I chopped the apples into chunks instead of the rings and used an ice cream scoop to drop them into the oil.  
I bet this basic recipe would work with clams, mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, etc.  the possibilities are endless!!!

I used 2 Braeburns chopped up instead of 4 and dropped them into the oil with a teaspoon and WOW!!  Super fantastic crispy fluffy sweet fritters that were soooooooooo good!!  I think if I had added the other 2 apples it would have been overkill on the apples.  This way it was almost donut like in texture.

We just made these for the first time! We followed the suggestions to double the nutmeg & sugar, and add cinnamon.  Didn't want to deep fry, so fried them up in a pan.  We used a tablespoon to drop in the oil and when they came out they looked like mini pancakes. We're having a Halloween party in a few weeks and plan to serve them as "Goblin Ears"... so excited!  THANKS

Did not like these at all.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of adding cinnamon, and they turned out limp, mushy, and rubbery.  (I did use a deep fryer and waited until the temp was correct.)  Definitely needs major tweaking--maybe buttermilk and baking soda instead of milk?  Anyway, I probably won't bother again.

This recipe was just alright for me. I was hoping for something more like the apple fritter donut I usually think of. These were good but not great. I cup up the apple instead of doing apple rings, which I did like.

We made a wicked mess making these!  And we made WAY too much, it took forever to deep fry in our small deep fryer.  If we made them again we would so cut the recipe in half!  We also peeled/cored/sliced/ and then diced our apple slices for the sake of using the machine, which also gave us that much more to deep fry.  Probably wasn't the best thing to do on our part!

I loved these. They were absolutely delicious.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and only cooked them in 1/2" of oil.  Also I didn't have a corer so I just sliced them.  I had extra batter left over and made little pancakes out of it!

This was so easy to make and very yummy!  I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the recipe, and it was perfect!  Not too sweet, either.  And iInstead of confectioner's sugar, I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar, and it added just the right amount of sweetness and flavor.  Delicious!  I also chopped the apples, cooked them in the microwave for 5 minutes before stirring them into the batter, and then scooped out 1/4 cup at a time to pour into the 4 cups of hot oil in a skillet.  Absolutely perfect!

DELICIOUS!  Mmmmmmm -- I used canned apple pie filling because I had no apples on hand.  AWESOME results!  The way to keep the batter from sticking to the basket - don't drop the batter in - lower it in.  As you pour a TBL of batter (best for bite size), don't lift the spoon out right away.  Let the batter form a crust and then release the rest of the fritter.  THIS is what works!

Thanks for a YUMMY treat!

Did not like this recipe, very bland, a waste of perfectly good apples, you may be able to play around with the recipe some, find some combination that works, but who has the time.  I just fried up the apple plain and sprinkled it with some sugar and spice and ate it like that.

I made these yesterday and my mother, brothers and I loved them. Next time I'm going to add some cinnamon and a tad more sugar to the mix. The recipe made it fast and easy to make. The end product was just a little greasy but after placing them on the paper towel it was smooth sailing and they were gone in a flash!

Would have added a photo but they went too fast.  They were awesome.. Just a few healthy tweaks...  I cut the apples in smaller bite size pieces, added a large hand full of sliced almonds,(though, I am sure any nut would be great), added some fresh ground cinnamon(for slower sugar absorption). After frying and powdering I squeezed a small amount of fresh lemon (helps to break down the oil in the body and adds a fresh flavor too)  and drizzled some local honey on them (helps build immunities to local pollens) ... My twins said these are a make again recipe!!!!

These were good. I didnt follow the recipe completely though. I ended up grating the apple and mixing it into the batter. I dropped by spoonfuls into the oil. I think that grating the apple made the batter too moist b/c the fritters were a little soggy on the inside. I might cut back on the liquid next time. wonderful flavor though!

Wonderful! I attempted to cut into rings, but they fell apart. So I chopped the apples into tiny pieces, mixed into the batter and dropped into the oil. Came out like a little doughnut. Was enjoyed by the whole family.

Great Recipe.  Didn't have nutmeg so added cinnamon instead. Chopped apples using food chopper and patted with paper towel to dry.  Mix into dough.  Used my small pampered chef cookie scoop to make small balls, came out perfect.  Large scoop - was still doughy on inside.  Will use again.

Good Recipe!!! I diced the apples as oposed to making rings. I gave it only four stars because it is slightly bland and I added some nutmeg and allspice. Very easy to follow :)

Great!! I made the apple as suggested, plus, I threw the leftovers in a homeade piping bag and squirted it into the hot oil, and made "funnel" cakes, turned out, surprisingly fandibulously delicous!! 5 stars easy

I tried the suggestion of cooking the diced apples in the micowavefor 4 mins.  I increased the sugar to 1/3 C and added more cinnamon (1 heaping t), a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  
I fried these up for my husband and he LOVED them.  I feel like I need to play with the spice ratio a bit more to give it a 5 but a very strong 4 recipe.  Thanks!

This is was very tasty, but I added more nutmeg and 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. I used another reviewer's idea and diced the apples innstead of making rings. Was messy to work with but worth the effort.

This is really good fresh. If it's not fresh, it will become really soggy, so make sure you adjust the recipe proportions correctly so that you won't have too many left overs.
Also, watch the amount of nutmeg you use. Slightly more than the called amount makes it a bit strong for my taste and slightly less leaves a feeling of something missing.

Good recipe not great. I used a bit more liquid like some others mentioned before so that it did cook easily for the whole fritter. I did add cinnamon and vanilla too. Overall, I will make again someday.

My sister made these and she did a wonderful job. I've never had fritters before, but my brother would always order them when we went maple sugaring and was happy to be reunited (our favorite place closed a few years ago). Eat warm with confectioner's sugar!

My family LOVED these!  Not sure how they lasted past the first day, but these were even better the day after.  I did learn to sprinkle the confectioners sugar (which I mixed with cinnamon) on just before eating otherwise the whiteness from the sugar disappeared before we ate them.  Thanks for the recipe!

My kids and I made this recipe and it was so easy, not only was it easy but we had no problem with the batter sticking like some others had stated, perhaps they did not follow directions as stated. We used the exact recipe and it was wonderful, will definitely make again! I have a bowl left over I will prob nuke them for a couple of seconds and they should be good as new.

m intolerant to wheat, so instead of using wheat flour, I used rice flour, and instead of milk I used hazelnut milk. It was great! I find that rice flour, when used in batter fries up lighter, more golden, and crunchier! Beware of sticking though! Unless you don't mind dealing with it use a non-stick pan. I will be making this recipe again. Thanks Pat!

Great recipe. BEST apples for frying are McIntosh. Maybe honey crisp as second.  I don’t bother peeling anymore, skin softens and you keep the nutrients. Very similar to Polish apple pancakes. We’re not a sweet fam, and with sprinkling of powdered sugar for serving , I only add a teaspoon of sugar. And if u omit the spices, its a more savory batter and the apple flavor is the only ingredient you Taste.

This was excellent. However I'm Glute Free eater only. Substituted the flour for Bobs Red Mill 1:1 Flour. I used 1 tsp more baking powder and fried them. Pretty darn good with cinnamon and sugar. They were fluffy!

I didn't like this recipe at all. The batter was kind of tasteless.
The fritters were too greasy and the apples went mushy inside.

I thought they were great, reminded me a lot of my mom's fritters growing up. If I could make any change I would add a little more nutmeg and/or cinnamon, and maybe a tad more sugar (but not much). And I prefer the whole apple slices to chopped apples -- that's a whole 'nother type of fritter.  This one is really like eating an apple in dough vs something with an apple taste (small pieces chopped up). Just my preference.

Base recipe is PERFECT!!! Finally a recipe that is light & fluffy: better than a  donut shop! I, as always mess with things- added 1/2 tsp Viet cinnamon, a very ripe small chopped pear right to the batter, a generous amount of double strength vanilla, & used fresh grated nutmeg (there is no substitute ;)!). Amazing, amazing- thank you!

These taste all right...I guess but entirely too much baking powder...these look nothing like the ones we get in this part of the country. I'm not going to throw them out because too much time and apples invested but the guys are going to laugh to see how these turned out...really disgusting and I usually never say anything like that. So sorry...just my opinion.

My boyfriend and I love to cook so we made these together.  Everyone is right on them being very bland.  The batter was also too thick.  We had to add more milk.  We also cut back on the baking powder to just a teaspoon.  Seasoned the batter with cinnamon and sugar to give it more taste.  It still needs a couple of extra tweaks to make this a five star recipe.

Really good, I couldnt figure out how to core the apples so I just cut them into chunks.  I also added some Cinnamon, of which I will add more to next time.  I think about 1 1/2 tablespoons will be good. As I fryed them I drained on a paper towel and then popped them in a casserole dish in the oven to keep them hot.  Oven should only be on 200 as you dont want to cook them just keep them warm.

The fritters were delicious. I did have a problem getting the batter to stay on the apple slices though. One thing we did different was to add cinnamon to the icing sugar that you dipped the fritters in.

These were A big hit with the whole family  I used slightly less sugar in the batter & sprinkled with the rest before serving instead of the confectioners sugar I also substituted 1 1/4 cups vanilla soymilk for the milk & cooked in a cast iron skillet
these were delicious

I followed Gr8typist's recommendations, and this was fantastic!  Also, I halved the recipe, and it was enough for 4 people.  Low and slow should be your mantra while frying these.  The recipe says 375, but 300-325 was hot enough.  Otherwise, they get overdone on the outside and you have batter inside.

This is very good and easy to make.  I would recommend only doing half of the recipe to start.  I used half and had 2 small apples and I still have more batter.  The batter clung to the apple rings very nicely.  I sprinkled with sugar/cinnamon.  I did not have any powered sugar.  Thanks!  Just what we were looking to try.
