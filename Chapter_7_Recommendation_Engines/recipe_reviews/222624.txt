This is an easy recipe.  I had never eaten green beans with sour cream, but it tasted good.  I served it with Tender Italian Baked Chicken from this site.

These sounded better than they were. The sour cream got gloppy when I added it to the hot green beans and it didn't look appetizing at all. I thought the taste was okay but my husband didn't like them at all. Thanks, I had fun making a new recipe.

These were okay. Nothing that stood out to me to where I would make them again.

So glad I stumbled on this recipe.  I made it with fresh tomatoes, and fresh green beans.  It was very tasty.  The sour cream went well with it.

Excellent and so easy. I made these for Thanksgiving dinner. The only change I made was I added some red pepper flakes because I didn't have any paprika. it was really good with the  added spiciness and the sour cream went so well with that. thanks for posting.

My family loved this recipe. Two of the children didn't like sour cream but still loved the dish without it.  My daughter said this was a keeper for my recipes book.
