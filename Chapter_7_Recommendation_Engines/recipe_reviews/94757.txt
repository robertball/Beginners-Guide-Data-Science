im a filipina living here right now in the united states. and yes you this dish is very popular in the philippines and goes really good with sweet and sour or just katchup. i even sometimes use ground beef or rice sticks noodles with chicken shrimp and veges..my husband always loved it whatever i stuffed in there as long as its seasoned well. you can also add raisins on it if u like for a little sweetess. and by the way you dont have to waste an egg, just use water to seal the wrapper...goes good too. and you can make a thick filling if you saute the filling first or just put thin raw filling. really good try it!!!

Great lumpia recipe! Easy to customize by adding the same quantities of your preferred veggies.  Makes more than enough for a crowd and the cooked lumpia freeze well for reheating later.  Just be sure that your oil temp is 375 or under or they wrappers will cook faster than the filling.

these are best when served with the sweet and spicy sauce! One of my first true filipino foods that I ever tried, and I am a picky eater! I know the woman that made them for me used different filling but its whatever you want to put in it!! Tasty!

I question not cooking the pork prior to rolling the lumpia. I have been making lumpia for years and alway cook the pork and vegatables prior to putting the filling in the wrappers.  That way, I ensure the pork is properly cooked and I don't have to cook it so long in the hot oil. Just long enough brown the wrapper.

These are fantastic! I omitted the MSG and kept everything the same.  I also cut the wrappers in half diagonally and wrapped it like that.  It still had plenty of wrapper.  I am going to be making these again and again.  My husband could not get enough of these.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Great recipe although I cooked the filling before using it in the lumpia to assure the pork was cooked.  This allowed me to use the color of the spring roll shell to tell me when the lumpia was done.

I already know how great these taste. I am so grateful you have this recipe as I used to search for it. My favorite aunt, Melanie used to make these for me as  little girl as a special treat. She passed away in 1991 and I have never forgotten this memory.

My wife makes this often since everybody always asks her to bring it to the parties. I would strongly recommend you use a filipino style of soy sauce. Datu Puti or Silver Swan brands (Available at most asian groceries). The difference is like night and day! When we run out and she uses another brand, it just doesn't taste as good.

This is what I use as the basis for my lumpias.  I omit the MSG and I always add some granulated garlic and red chili flakes to the filling mixture.

I made these and my mom and husband couldn't believe how great they turned out.  Mine were much too thick to be considered spring rolls which was my goal but they were delish! I deep fried them in my cool daddy for about 4-5 minutes.
