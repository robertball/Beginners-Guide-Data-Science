I made this cheesecake last week for an early Thanksgiving for the first time. It was very easy to make ( even for me) and it came out looking and tasting perfectly.

I got this recipe from my MIL and it was exactly the same as this one. I uploaded the picture since it didn't have one. This recipe is excellent and as you can see, very presentable to company. My husband was so happy I made it as it has been a favorite of his for years.

I accidentally added a 12 ounce can of evaporated milk instead of a 5 oz one, so I had to bake it for an extra half hour.  It was a bit too wet still, but it was sooo delicious. The sour cream topping makes it. I also used gingersnaps for the crust instead of the graham cracker crust.

I made this cheesecake with a gingersnap and pecan crust instead of graham crackers. Everyone loved it! Note: No sugar needed for the gingersnap crust.

My very first cheesecake! It was easy to follow, not too many steps. The sour cream topping made it very unique. It was a huge hit last Thanksgiving. My family asked me to make it again. Love it!

Great recipe. I did it last year as a beginner and it turned out great. Doing it again today. I'll post a photo later.
Give it a try yourself!
