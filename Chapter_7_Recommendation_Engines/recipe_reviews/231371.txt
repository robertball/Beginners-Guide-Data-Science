This was so good!! I didn't have many of the ingredients, but simple subs. Pork instead of lamb, no mint, canned tomatoes instead of fresh because it is winter and they are out of season. Figured canned was better than fresh at this time of the year. With the leftovers I added a little extra zucchini chopped up, some more tomatoes, and served it over rice. It was delicious and my no-veggie kids ate it up!

This was excellent! A bit labor-intensive, but it was worth it.  I had all ingredients except fresh mint leaves so I used dried mint instead.  I used homemade marinara sauce for the tomato sauce and lemon pepper panko crumbs for the bread crumbs.  I also toasted the pine nuts before adding them in.  I had more "filling" than my 2 medium-sized zucchini could accommodate, so I greased a small casserole dish and put the excess filling in it and baked it, too.  Would highly recommend this recipe.  It's a definite keeper for me!

Fantastic!!! This one is going in my keeper folder! I was looking for a recipe to use up some ground lamb I had purchased.   I didn't have access to any extra large zucchinis, so I bought 3 medium sized ones, about 8"-10" long. I only ended up using about half the meat mixture, so I definitely could have used a few more zucchinis, probably 6 total.  The only suggestion I'd make is to lower the heat to 400F, as the meat mixture started burning towards the end. Also, the bread crumbs and mozzarella weren't really combining well, so I'd just  put them on separately.  The mint really makes this dish. I'm looking forward to making this for company! Thanks, another great recipe, Larry!

This was excellent!  I went the Italian direction, based on the ingredients I had available.  Used chopped pecans (no walnuts on hand), parmesan instead of feta, and fresh basil.  Also used ground turkey.  Next time I hope to try it with ground lamb and original ingredients!

This was outstanding.  The flavors blended together for that Mediterranean taste.  The mint and feta!  I am going to try this in stuffed red peppers.

My husband and I loved this recipe. We're not fond of lamb, so I substituted ground beef. Instead of one large zucchini, I stuffed a small zucchini, a green pepper, and a small eggplant all sliced lengthwise. I scooped the eggplant as well as the zucchini to add to the stuffing. I added about a cup of cooked brown rice as well. I didn't add the mozzarella at the end, just sprinkled the breadcrumbs on for the last few minutes of baking. What a gorgeous presentation, and delicious meal! The fresh mint, pine nuts and feta were a great change from the traditional Italian style stuffed veggies.

Very good!  I did throw in a few extras however, peppers, carrots and olives. 
 While the presentation in the shell is attractive, the excess stuffing I cooked in a casserole dish tasted the same.  In the future I'd probably just cook it that way instead of searching for oversized zucchini.

Larry, this is DELICIOUS! You knocked this one out of the park. We literally sat at the table and were "mmmm, MMMMM, MMMM!!!"-ing throughout the meal . Made it exactly as written, no changes needed.

I didn't have a melon corer to take the zucchini flesh out but it worked perfectly fine. I had a giant zucchini (about 15in) so I cut it into 4 sections and held them together using toothpicks. I precooked it in the oven at 230°C for 15 minutes before putting the stuffing in. I then put it back in the oven for 20 minutes then sprinkled cheese & mint on top then cooked for further 5 minutes.

This was super yummy!!  I forgot pine nuts at the store so just left them out.  Our room mate is vegan so divided the recipe in half, put griller crumbles in her half and used Daiya mozzarella cheese for the top.  I felt more spices were in order so added a tiny bit of fennel, fresh rosemary & thyme.  Definitely keeping this in our favorites!

I had two giant zucchini, and a pound of ground lamb,  I didn’t weigh and measure as I went along, I threw all the pine-nuts I had on the fridge into it, and that seemed ok.  I used the last of a carton of panko breadcrumbs to use them up.  I’m moving next week, hence the urge to use up what I have.  
I didn’t have a lot of feta, so I diced some herby Halloumi to add to it.  
I love it.  My husband ate it, but will likely have meatloaf from now on while I eat the leftovers.

I’ve made this twice and I think next time I’ll skip stuffing the zucchini and slice 2-4 of them, cook all of the ingredients and pour into a casserole dish adding the bread crumbs and cheese to the whole thing. This can be made with a Mexican, Greek or Italian bent by changing spices and cheeses. Also mine was watery so maybe some tomato paste rather than the sauce to thicken it a little.

This was the stuffing I have been looking for years! I used the excess in a green pepper. The only addition I made was a tiny amount of cinnamon for that middle eastern mystique.

Average.  Too much zucchini and not enough "other stuff".  It sounded so good, that is why I tried the recipe.  I guess my hope of liking cooked zuchini is not going to happen (except in baked good items such as muffins or bread).  We had too many leftovers that did not get eaten.
