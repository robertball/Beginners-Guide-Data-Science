I forgot to mention that, if you like a glaze on your meatloaf, you can remove the bacon at the 40 min mark and add a BBQ glaze made from BBQ sauce, brown sugar, and vinegar.

Excellent meatloaf recipe! The only changes I made was to use regular breakfast sausage because that's what I had on hand. I'll try the sage kind next time, I'm sure that would add a nice flavor. Also, I line the bottom of the loaf pan with bread slices. They soak up all the fat, then you just throw the bread away when serving your meatloaf. It's a great tip I got from another reviewer. Thanks Jeffery for a delicious recipe, my whole family loved it!

Hubs and I loved this, tho' I did make a few changes that made this more appealing for us - I skipped the carrots as well as the sugar - can't even imagine how sweet that would have been and I knew that wouldn't work for us, tho' we're not fans of sweet/savory to begin with.  To fill in for the carrots I tossed in some chopped celery and green pepper. As for the sausage, I didn't have any breakfast sausage but I did have ground pork - that and a good shot of freshly ground pepper worked fine.  I made a half recipe, one loaf, for the two of us and used the entire package of the onion soup mix.  The best part of this meatloaf in my view was the barbeque sauce and the flavor it imparted - awesome good!  Then again, the bacon on top was pretty darn good too.  One final word for this - repeat.

I love meatloaf but I wanted to try something new because I am sick of the same old meals. This recipe was genius! I left out the sausage, bacon and brown sugar because I did nto have them available at the time and even still this was a wonderful dish. It makes a lot so I shared the leftovers with others who also raved about this tastey meal!

DELICIOUS! My mom hates anything with a BBQ flavor and even she had seconds.  I lightened it up quite a bit using 96/4 ground beef, turkey sausage, egg substitute, and turkey bacon.  The only thing that was missing were the extra calories!  I chopped the carrots very fine since my family *thinks* they don't like carrots (yessir, I'm a sneaky cook!) and I used 2 c. of finely ground rolled oats.  I think I'll have to add about a cup or so more to the extra amount I froze since the 1st loaf did fall apart; I'm thinking is due to the egg substitute.  A must-try for all you meatloaf fans who are looking for a twist to the "usual".

Thanks Jeff! I used a pound of 96% lean beef and a pound of 99% lean ground turkey.  I Omited the sausage and spiced it up with sage to make up some of the flavor loss.  To add back fat in a good way I used 5 tbsp of olive oil.  Left off the bacon and used 2cups oatmeal.  It was awsome!  Thanks again Jeff.

My family really enjoyed this dish...I sautee onions in bacon fat and omited the bacon slices...used 1 package of onion soup mix and added parsley, I also used less BBQ sauce (about 1/2 a bottle) as in the past I used the whole bottle and it made the dish too sweet.  Will make again!

What a great meatloaf! My husband and I both enjoyed this. It is quite the change from the traditional meatloaf, which we also like. I had no problem with the recipe. I substituted whole oats for rolled oats because that is what I had, and I used frozen carrots that I chopped up fine because I didn't have any fresh ones. It turned out perfect anyhow! We fed the inlaws and a friend with it as well, and had nothing but compliments. Thanks for sharing, Jeffery!

This was _okay_.  It was super crumbly (maybe I put too much or not enough oatmeal?).  It also did not have a knock-out flavor- though the flavor was not bad. Maybe I would use a hot Italian sausage next time.

I am NOT a cook, but this recipe was super easy and is now one of my absolute favorites. My husband is a very picky eater, and even HE enjoyed it. I left out the bacon and carrots just bc I did not have them already. About 5 minutes before the loaf was completely cooked, I drizzled BBQ over the top. It turned out better than I had even expected!!

This was very good.  I didn't have any sausage, and cut back on the recipe for 2 of us.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef, one onion, one cup of shredded carrots, a whole envelope of the onion soup mix, no brown sugar as others suggested, 2 eggs, about 3/4 cups of barbeque sauce and 1/2 cup of gluten free oats. A painted a little of the barbeque sauce on the top, but no bacon. It turned out very well, just sweet enough; very moist; and the carrots added a tiny bit of crunch.

Tasted very good. Thought recipe may have had more BBQ sauce than I would like. May cut back next time. Overall, a great tasting and moist meatloaf.

I made this for a few of my friends and every single person said it was the best meatloaf they have ever had!  The only thing that I did was use 2 large onions and not three onions.  And I removed the bacon and glazed the meatloaf with BBQ.  Huge success!

I did not care for the flavor of this oatmeal and it never did reach the right consistency, despite using a full 2 cups oatmeal. It was much too sweet and fell apart. I always rate recipes based on the ingredients and methods given, not on how I alter it. So based on the contents of this recipe, I have to give it 2 stars. I would not make it again and I don't understand what all the hubub is over this recipe!

This was wonderful!  Easy to put together and I like that it made two loaves. One for now and one for the freezer. I did substitute whole wheat bread crumbs for the oatmeal but kept everything else the same.  Moist and delicious. My husband loved it!

It is OK.  I don't think I am a fan of oatmeal as filler in meatloaf.  I think I will go back to breadcrumbs.  Just personal taste.

I used Jimmy Dean Hot  Sausage (1 lb instead of 3/4 lb), no carrots, no brown sugar, and I used 2 cups of bread crumbs instead of the oatmeal (gave it a finer texture). I used KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce, tried for a not so sweet sauce which is why I left out sugar and carrots. Texture was great and family gave it thumbs up, so it goes in the make again pile.

Made this with 1.5 lbs ground pork and a pound of ground round. Omitted the brown sugar and used about 2 Tblspns raw honey. 1 1/2 c. Oatmeal and 2 eggs. Since I made it in one big loaf I cooked it 90 mins. Cooked it as a special treat for my 88 yo father who hasn't had meatloaf since mom passed in 2001. Dad loved it and said it was the best meatloaf he's ever had! I was overjoyed and it brought tears to my eyes. Meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow with the leftovers! :)

Very satisfying. Only made three changes. First, I didn't use any sausage. I thought that would be too much meat. Second, I only used ~3/4s of a cup of barbecue sauce. I'm glad I did, because it came out very sweet. And lastly, I added a jalapeño.

Easy crowd pleaser.  Made it twice -  neither time did it become leftovers.  Sweet, smokey and dense.  I will make it again.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the recipe cooks up nicely as printed and my husband and 3 teen boys loved it. I, however, was not a fan of the sausage. You can really taste the sausage in it, so if you are not a fan of your meatloaf reminding you of breakfast food, this recipe might not be for you. But again, it cooks up nicely and my men all thought it was great! Just personal preferences here.

BBQ Oatmeal Meatloaf Haiku: "I'll forgive texture, because the taste was so good! Think it's a keeper." Husband and 8yo daughter loved the meatloaf on top, I liked the BBQ flavor throughout it, rather than as a glaze on top. It fell apart easily despite my letting it rest for 20 min. b4 slicing, and a crumbly meatloaf gives me the frownie face b/c then I can't turn leftovers into a sandwich. (And what leftovers there were the baby ate. The texture was spot-on for her!)
