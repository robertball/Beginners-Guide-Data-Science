Yum.. took these to church and everyone loved them.  I thought they might be too sweet, but they were fine.  Could make these with any cake/ nut combo for a new taste every time

Nowhere does the recipe tell you to bake the cake again.  Once it is baked for 25-30 minutes, you chop it up and blend it with a portion of the frosting.  You frost the top and refrigerate it to firm it up.

Unless the originators of the recipe say otherwise, I would assume that written recipe would be the correct one.  I can’t imagine rebaking for 30 minutes after putting on the cream cheese frosting. 5 star rating only because I couldn’t submit without a star rating

Okay, people; this isn't rocket science. Nobody bakes a cake after icing it. That said, I baked it the way I'd normally bake a cake, then iced it. Only change was I used vanilla instead of butter extract. Tasted just fine.

I don’t see where it says bake with frosting on top. I made these and frosted (mixed with half the cake) and refrigerated like the recipe states....

This is the craziest recipe I have ever read.  I can’t even imagine how to follow these directions.  Sorry, because I’d really like to try it.

For everyone saying that it doesn’t state to bake it after you frost it: you are correct,  if you follow the printed recipe. However, the video says to bake it after it’s frosted, which I assume is a mistake. 
I recommend everyone follow the printed recipe.

This is an awesome treat! I’ve made it 3 times so far, as directed, and it has been a hit every time. The only ingredient that I omitted because I couldn’t find it at my store was butter flavoring. So, once I make it with this ingredient it will likely have a 6 star rating!!! Love it, thank you for sharing!!!

Found the icing is way too sweet.  I would cut the sugar in half as it takes away from the filling.

I have a question. On the video it shows the cake being baked twice. In the recipe it is only baked once. Which is correct?
