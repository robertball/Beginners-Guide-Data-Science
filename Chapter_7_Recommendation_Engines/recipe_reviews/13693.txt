I grew up on this but we call it dressing. We do not stuff our turkey, instead this is served on the side. The only thing I do differently is air dry the bread for a few days on cookie sheets - not a few hours (turning several times to make sure both sides dry out completely). The bread is nice and dried out and the dressing does not get soggy. I also double the recipe using two loaves of bread (my family loves the leftovers on top of their turkey sandwiches). Because I double the recipe, I bake this in a roasting pan (and use a little cooking spray on the pan to ease cleanup). When you're making this, add a little broth at a time and stop when it seems right for your taste (if it's too dry then add more, but if it's nice and moist then stop). I have made this with poultry seasoning and I have also made it with sage - they are both very, very good and there is really not a huge difference in taste, so it's just personal preference. I have made several types of dressings and stuffings but always come back to this family favorite.

This is basically the same recipe handed down thru the years in my family but for 1 change. We also use 2 beaten eggs which help keep the stuffing together. And of course ours fits a 19 - 22 lbs turkey. My family looks forward to this stuffing each Thanksgiving as that is the only time I make it and a turkey.

Excellent stuffing!  I've made this stuffing for several years, experimenting a little each time.  I now add 2 Granny Smith apples - peeled, chopped and sauteed with the onion and celery; 1 cup chopped walnuts; and for a meat variety I fry up 1 pkg. of ground Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage with sage, drain fat, then add the sausage to the bread crumbs before adding broth.  The vegetables, apples and sausage will moisten the bread somewhat.  For beginners, add broth slowly while mixing the stuffing so bread does not become too wet or soggy. I usually use less than 1 can of chicken broth. (You can add any leftover broth to your gravy.) Family and friends devour this stuffing! Grandkids love it! UPDATE Nov.2008: I now include 1 small 6 oz. bag of craisins
with the above ingredients. Delicious.

This is exactly the recipe I use but with French Bread..not white bread...It gives the dressing much more substance and it holds together much better..:)

This stuffing recipe was a hit at our last Thanksgiving dinner.  My husband was skeptical (his mom's recipe is "the best" he says) but now he wants me to make this every year!!  Toasting the bread kept it from getting soggy and gummy like most recipes taste.  This is a great recipe!

My guests- americans and europeans- all liked this. However, I used both old french bread and sliced white bread - 1/2 and 1/2. I also used more poultry seasoning than it calls for and added some salt to bring out the flavors. In addition, I saute√©d the onion until almost caramelized - they were very golden -and added sliced mushrooms at that point. I then cooked them until the mushroom were cooked. It was a hit, but only after modifying it. I actually added bread as it was too soggy.

My first attempt at making dressing "from scratch".  What was I worried about?  This was so easy!  The kids loved helping me cut up the bread, which I did first.  Then we sprinkled a little onion and garlic powder on the cubes and toasted them in the oven.  I will add a little more broth next time but... I think that really all depends on if you like your dressing more on the moist or dry side.  I was quite proud of my first attempt!  Thanks!  Yummy!

This is just like my family's recipe that has been handed down through generations. The only difference is it is written in measurements!!  I was told by Grandma and Dad to add "enough broth to make it moist" or add 'a dash at a time until it tastes "right".'  I like to measure and this recipe makes it turn out perfectly.  Even Dad said it was better than his.
Tip - toast the bread very lightly, combine the night before with a little less broth and poultry seasoning than it calls for.  In the morning, toss it again and taste it.  Add a drizzle more broth if it is dry or a dash more poultry seasoning if needed. (the seasoning gets stronger as it sits overnight so don't overdo it) Also, the intensity of the seasoning depends on how old it is. Seasonings weaken over time. 
I suggest baking it covered in a casserole and uncovering it with about 15 min to go so it is a little browned and crisp on top.  And cut the onion and celery very fine.  That is key.  Enjoy.

This is a basic but very yummy stuffing.  I was specifically looking for one that would bake out of the bird (since we deep fry our turkey).  This works well but it is necessary to double the liquid.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth.

For my first Thanksgiving I wanted to woo everyone.  This stuffing was the HIT.  I used 1 box seasoned bread mix and 1/2 lb of dried white french bread and mixed in some leftover wild rice and just 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasoning and followed rest of directions. I didn't put it in the bird but rather on the side in a 9x18 pan and baked, it was crispy and soft at the same time.  Kudo's to the author on this one and Thanks for the great receipe.

First time I tried homemade stuffing and I was very impressed.  I made it in a casserole.  I didn't have the poultry seasoning, so I added some other seasonings.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is a great base - I used a pound of dried french bread and doubled the celery.  I used 1/3 c. of butter and added 2 tsp. of rosemary.  I also added 1 pound of pork sausage and used a little more chicken broth.  I had enough stuffing to stuff a 14 pound turkey and have enough for a 9x13 casserole dish.

Wonderful! I have a question, though. Has anyone ever made this dressing the day before serving? If so, please tell me how you stored it and reheated it. I only want to do it in advance if it still gives the same excellent results!!!

This is a classic!  Last year, instead of using Swanson's chicken broth in a can, I used Swanson's Chicken Stock in the resealable bottle and loved it. It has a richer flavor and really added a lot to the taste of the stuffing. I will never used the canned broth again. Tips: this is great with some apples diced and sauteed with the onion and celery, too. I always use more onion and celery than called for because it reduces in size when sauteed, and add a beaten egg or two (depending on the amount I am making) to help bind it all together. Also--if you can find it in the store, I recommend using Bell's seasoning in the little yellow box. This is the stuffing/dressing I grew up on. Yum!

Cut celery and onions the night before and put in fridge. Also made the chicken broth the night before.  (One chicken breast, one onion, one bell pepper, one bouillon cube, half bell pepper, two carrots and two stalks of celery in about six cups water as I don't really like canned broth). Plopped veggies in with the butter the next morning.  Did not have poultry seasoning, so used a pinch of each of thyme, sage, parsley, herb salt, and a bit of marjoram.  Stuffed the turkey, then put the rest into crock pot.  (Yes, I doubled the recipe to make sure there would be enough.  My family adores stuffing and dressing).  Fabulous.  Easy to adapt to taste.

Very similar to what I grew up on...since most of my family likes their stuffing moist and I like it browned and crisp, I add a scoop into muffin tins and get individual servings of crispy stuffing..delicious!

Great Recipe! I will admit that this was my first attempt to make stuffing WITHOUT Stovetop and I loved it! I dried the bread over night and added Sage. Remember to bake in oven covered if you like your stuffing moist and only uncover for the last 5-10 minutes if you want it a little less so. 

My husband and I both enjoyed it and I made extra to use in a Shepherds Pie. Delish! I will no longer be needing the assistance of Stovetop. This is much better!

This is the basic recipe that appeared on the back of the small tins of McCormick poultry seasoning probably 50 years ago. Before bar codes took up all the room. It's a classic.

Nice stuffing recipe.  Definately for turkey stuffing.  If making just for side...use 
more chicken stock.

This was a really good recipe.  Instead of letting the bread sit out for a couple of hours I taosted the bread.  I also used 1 tsp each of sage, oregano, and italian blend seasoning.  This combination of herbs adds great flavor.  I increased the butter to 1 cup. Make sure you coat each breadcrumb in the butter mixture.  I also added 1 small bell pepper finely chooped.  Mmm mmm good.

My first attempt at making "real" stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it...especially me! I will use this stuffing recipe from here on out. Who would have thought something so simple to make could be so delicious??? I had to double the recipe for the amount of guests I had and I changed two things: I cooked a pound Jimmy Dean sage flavored sausage and added that to the doubled recipe and it was fantastic! The other thing I changed was taking the advice from others and toasted the fresh bread cubes with onion and garlic powder in the oven. I did that the night before so the actual preparation the next day was even that much easier. A great big thanks to the person who submitted this recipe!!!

I first tried this recipe from allrecipes about 9 years ago when cooking my first big Christmas dinner. It is so tasty, and easy that I have never "branched out" into other types. I still use this same recipe! Now I use brown bread or my own homemade multigrain, I have used it in the bird and baked it in a casserole, I have used vegetable broth instead of chicken for a vegetarian friend, etc! It is an easy and versatile recipe that I have used many many times over the years.

How can something so simple and with just a few ingredients taste so good?! I cut my bread into cubes and dried it on cookie sheets over several days turning them several times to ensure all sides were completely dried,  as recommened by another reviewer. I omitted the salt and used Campbells double strength chicken broth. Adding the broth a bit at a time until just moist is crucial. It may look and feel like the stuffing will turn out too dry, but I assure you, somehow it works. I doubled the batch to serve some in the bird and some in a roasting pan, then tasted it to make sure it had the right amount of seasonings and adjusted it to my family's taste. It was delicious. The stuffing cooked in the roasting pan even tasted great cold the next day!

Delicious stuffing recipe! If your looking for a simple, meatless stuffing, this is the one. I used a good bakery bread, and sliced it myself at home. I also increased the chicken broth, probably to almost 2 cups since we like a moist stuffing. My family loved it, and this will be a mainstay! Thanks, Carlotta

For so few ingredients this is a very tasty stuffing. I did, however, need to add additional broth. I used homemade chicken stock and added about 2 cups worth. It went into a 9x13 baking pan just right.

I made this last Thanksgiving, looking for something a little less time consuming and quicker. My family loved it! My husband would rather have this than the traditional cornbread stuffing! He has already asked if I'm gonna make it again this year! PERFECT! However, I did not put the stuffing in the turkey.

Perfect! I used less chicken broth (about 3/4 cup), and I added some chopped mushrooms. The only thing I will change next time is to cut the celery smaller; I didn't care for the texture of large chunks of celery. Our Turkey Feast was a success, and this recipe was one of the best! Thanks! UPDATE: I keep coming back to this one! Came out perfect again this year, this time I changed nothing about the recipe. Definitely took closer to 40 minutes in a 9X13 pan.

This was some of the tastiest savoriest dressing I have ever fixed or eaten. Excellent recipe! I used pepperidge farm seasoned bread cubes country style with white and brown bread. I have never had regular bread dressing before, only southern cornbread dressing, and this is almost as good. I still prefer the cornbread texture, I guess because I was raised on it, but wow is this stuff ever tasty! Ny husband loved it and wants me to just add oysters next time for his favorite ultimate holiday dressing. THANKS!!!!

This is the recipe that my Mom used.  She always bought Wonder Stuffing bread which is made and sold at grocery stores over the holidays.   We use one stick of butter for every loaf used.  We also use low-sodium chicken broth since we are adding salt & pepper to the dish.    This dish is a classic at Thanksgiving and we all fight over the leftovers!

I have made this stuffing for years, passed down from my mother. 2 things that we do different is cook the liver from the turkey in boiling water, mince it, add that to the stuffing, perfect and I don't even like liver. I also add 1/2 Cup of chopped mushrooms, makes the stuffing moist.

This is the way my family has made stuffing for years! Only things different is we add sage to the mixture. Just remember to add broth SLOWLY, and mix, taste, season, as you go.If not for Thanksgiving dinner, we add different things for different flavors... such as sausage, mushrooms, oysters, bell peppers, depending on what main meat item we are fixing, even half the bread with cornbread. This is a great recipe that you cannot go wrong with.

Delicious! I made this to go with lemon chicken, and it was the best stuffing I've ever had. I used 1 tsp. poultry seasoning and 1 tsp. Essence to kick it up a notch. I also baked it in a casserole as suggested, and it turned out perfect! Definately a keeper!

Recipe is almost my family favorite...  But, after I cube the bread- I leave it out overnight on an edged cookie sheet to dry (usually 2 sheets)- and then in the morning I bake it for 1 hour or so on 225-250- to make almost croutons out of the cubes...  Also, when I saute the onion and celery, I add 1 pound of breakfast style sausage (the solid roll of  Jones freezer stuff works well or you can get it from the butcher's at the market)...

Delicious old-fashioned stuffing.  I halved the recipe as we had a small turkey.  I used about a 1/3 cup more broth and 1/2 tsp more of poultry seasoning and it turned out great--moist and flavorful.  Definitely is a keeper.

This is how we ALWAYS make our stuffing.  The only difference is that we make a sort of turkey giblet broth by heating the giblets in a 2 1/2 quart saucepan of water for about an hour, discard the giblets, and use the broth in place of the chicken broth.  This is so delicious!!

This is the best traditional style stuffing Ive ever made. I toasted the bread in the toaster before cutting it up for the stuffing, and I used sage, rosemary and tyme instead of poultry seasoning. The results were amazing.

Okay, this is a great recipe. I tweaked it a bit, and I'll tell you why: I like a really moist stuffing. As it is, this would be great for going into a bird because it would soak up additional juices. For just baking, though, I recommend adding a bit more moisture. I kept NEARLY everything the same, but I'm a Pennsylvania girl, and we make our stuffing with saffron. I used all wheat bread (a day-old loaf from the grocery store bakery) and I substituted the cup of chicken broth in this recipe with a cup of water that had been simmered with saffron strands on the stovetop. (Both the saffron threads and the water went in). I did use chicken broth but only enough to bring the mixture together. I spread it in the bottom of my buttered casserole dish and topped it with slices of butter. It will be absolutely DIVINE when I bake it for Thanksgiving on Thursday. Great recipe, Carlota.

Easy to prepare with flavorful results! I prepared the ingredients as written only I used all butter, adding chopped turkey giblets and liver and cooked this on the stove top. I used Love‚Äôs fresh bread, cubed, and low-sodium Swanson chicken broth to moisten the cubed bread. This needed just a little more Hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper, other than that, this was a moist, flavorful, fluffy and perfectly seasoned stuffing. I loved the fresh chopped celery. This was enough for the two of us including leftovers for tomorrow. I served this with, ‚ÄúEasy Herb Roasted Turkey,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSweet Potato Casserole II,‚Äù also from this website.

This is basically the same stuffing that my mother has made for our family on Thanksgiving for as long as I can remember.  She, however, also adds chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (she uses 1 bunch) when she's mixing everything together.  The parsley just gives the stuffing a wonderful, fresh flavor.  She also adds an egg to bind the stuffing together.  It's not Thanksgiving in our house unless we have this stuffing - so yummy!

I made this stuffing last year after doing an internet seach for "easy stuffing".  I needed to make an inexpensive stuffing to serve 200 people at a church Thanksgiving dinner.  This stuffing was the 1st thing we ran out of and everyone commented on how good the stuffing was.  I used the recipe again this year and made enough for 300 people (took me about 5 hours to chop and mix everything!).  Again, I got such great comments on this recipe that I thought I better give a review - it's great in large quantities and inexpensive, too.

this recipe is like a big hug from my mom, who has passed away---this is her recipe down to a 'T' and every year when i make it for Thanksgiving, I feel like she's there with me.  The stuffing is traditional, not fancy, and (to my way of thinking) perfect in its simplicity.  Thank you for this recipe!!

This is the same basic recipe that I use except for pre-seasoned bread (sage, turkey seasoning etc)and I also add roasted pecan pieces. This recipe is also great for pork, adding apple and  raisins or cranberries.  I always receive compliments.

Wonderful, simple, traditional recipe.  I always dry the bread out longer (like 1 or 2 days, flipping the bread).  Also, I add more broth-- it's a personal taste preference.  I prep it early in the morning and cook it in a casserole dish coated with cooking spray for 45 minutes at 350, while the turkey is resting.  I like it a bit crispy== 30 minutes would be fine.  You can tweak it with your own seasonings, but this is a perfect base and tastes wonderful as-is.

Best traditional stuffing recipe by far!  To save time I purchased whole wheat sourdough bread that was already cut into one inch pieces, toasted and seasoned from a farmers market (which was definitely the way to go).  I used Olde Bay Seasoning instead of poultry seasoning to add a little more flavor.  I was nervous about adding too much broth or not enough broth but really just used my judgement and it came out perfect.  I made this the night before and refrigerated in a covered stoneware casserole dish (that was sprayed very well with Pam) and baked once the Turkey was done.  I think making the night before gave the stuffing time to fully absorb the flavors.  This is a definite keeper for my Thanksgiving Day meal!

This a a very good recipe and almost like the one I have used for years. I don't add eggs to mine and it turned out wonderful with the 1 cup of broth. The only difference is that I put grated carrots in mine. The seasoning was just right. I've had it where you tasted the seasoning for hours after eating. Didn't care for that at all. Cooked covered in a buttered casserole dish. Removed the foil for the last 10 minutes. Will definitely make again!!

This is basically the same recipe my family has used for a very long time.  Only difference is we start with a roll of sage pork sausage, cook and crumble.  We toast the bread in the toaster and break it into pieces and also add a bit of sage along with the poultry seasoning.  Can't wait for Thanksgiving~!

I haven't even made this yet but I am sure it is one of the few recipes I was unable to get from my mom before she could no longer tell me.  I am going to bet I will make no changes to this one.  Mom did keep things good and simple.  Thank you so much.

As others have said... this is our traditional Thanksgiving stuffing. It is absolutely a NEVER-FAIL recipe. Even if you've never cooked a Thanksgiving dinner or made dressing/stuffing before ... this is the one you want. I always double the recipe because I always want a lot of it left over. But there usually isn't much. 

The only thing I do differently is that I use the long sticks of french bread and cut it into one in cubes. When it bakes it stays moist in the inside while it gets crispy on top. I also add a bit of fresh thyme (maybe 1 TBLS ... 2 TBLS if I double the recipe)

It's wonderful...absolutely the best.

I'm not a big fan of stuffing but my husband loves it.  After trying this recipe I now love stuffing.  This has such flavor!!  I did toast the bread cubes as suggested by others.  I added mushrooms to the onion and celery and an extra teaspoon of sage and thyme.  I placed the stuffing in the crockpot for about 2 1/2 hours.  Thank for sharing such a great recipe

This is a great recipe, very similar to my families standard recipe except I would add 2 teaspoons sage as well.  Great for the holidays.  Its on my menu this year for my vegetarian niece. (To stuff the turkey, my husband & his family prefer sausage be added.)

very good recipe and super easy! I tripled the recipe because my family loves stuffing and leftovers. I did't use triple the amount of butter because it was just not needed (nor healthy) and I used half the amount of vegetable stock to moisten. I put it all in my crockpot on high for two hours....it was delicious!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and it turned out perefect! I dried my bread overnight, however, and sliced it into cubes the next morning, and let them air dry until I started the recipe in the afternoon. I think that made the difference as far as being too moist. I look forward to experimenting with this recipe in the future. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is exactly how my mom taught me how to make stuffing! When I make it for recipes I use these exact ingredients to taste except I usually will subtitute a no sodium broth and add my own salt to taste. On Thanksgiving I modify this and just add an egg or two, some dried corn bread crumbs in a bag, and a can of chicken soup for extra flavor. This style of recipe, as is, is great for week night recipes calling for boxed stuffing, if you don't care for it. It works every time.

This was a great stuffing! I recently made it for my family and it was a huge hit! I tweaked it a liittle bit though. I only used 1  1/2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning and I used turkey broth instead. My family encouraged me to make this a tradition for the times we see each other. I will definitely be makingthis again!

My mother-in-law and her mother both asked for the recipe our first Thanksgiving and ask every year whether I'm making it!  Thank you!

I have never made stuffing before so I decided to try this particular recipe for Thanksgiving.  It was excellent, exactly like I expected it to taste.  I made two batches.  In the second batch, I cooked turkey sausage with the onion and celery and then followed the recipe as directed. There was nothing left.  Great recipe.

I have made this recipes a few times already and I suggest you to cover your casserole and bake for 15 minutes, then uncover and bake an additional 20 minutes. This way it will avoid getting dry.

Like many other reviewers have noted, this is exactly like our family receipe, which we all make but has never been written down!  TIP: For full flavor, stuffing needs to be cooked inside the turkey - to avoid the dangers of bacteria and the hassles of scraping stuffing out of a hot bird, line the cavity with a couple of layers of cheesecloth before inserting the stuffing, leaving the ends hanging outside the bird.  Roast as usual.  When the turkey is fully cooked and removed from the oven, simply pull the ends of the cheesecloth from the hot bird, cleanly and safely removing the stuffing!

I love this basic recipe, Carlota. The thing I do differently is to toast the bread.   I also like to add a cup and a half of cornflakes cereal,     granulated garlic, and a beaten egg. I use a cup of butter and I use  more broth, just eyeball the amount until it's moist.    Sometimes, I'll sautee some grated carrot with the celery and onions... or add mushrooms to the sautee. Gee... I  can hardly wait till Thanksgiving! Thanks for the post.

This is a good base recipe but if made as directed I can see how it would be very soggy. Here are the changes I made and it came out wonderful! I cut up the bread into cubes and dried them over night. I added about 2 tsp sage to make it taste a bit more festive. And I added about only 1/3 cup chicken broth, just sprinkle it over the breading, and then turn it over with a spoon and sprinkle a bit more. The finished product will be part crispy and part moist stuffing. Delicious!

This is how my mother and her mother all made 'dressing'.  The only addition is we use an egg or two slightly beaten to help hold it together.  This is truly a home classic.

This was the first stuffing that I made from scratch.  They were very easy and tasty!  The whole family loved them.  Basic but that's how I like my stuffing!

The stuffing was delicious.  The only thing i would change for the next time i make this recipe is adding more chicken broth.  It needed maybe 1/2 cup more.

I used a full loaf of homemade bread.  The three teenagers at the table said it was better than Stovetop AND Stouffers.  That's some high praise.

I baked some french bread and used this in place of the white bread. I cut up the pieces and roasted for a short time in the oven (just till they were a little brown). I cooked it in the crockpot and let it sit all morning. I used the celery and onion that I cooked in the cavity of the turkey which added it extra flavor. I got so many compliments on this stuffing after all was done. Use seasoning to your taste. Had to add quite a bit of salt and put some garlic in there as well. Came out amazing!!

This was my first attempt at making a traditional stuffing (though I do make couscous and herb stuffing when I roast a chicken) and I made it for Christmas lunch.  It was superb! It was so easy that I don't want to keep this recipe for special occasions, I will make this often to have with roast chicken or turkey.   The recipe as is was fantastic, but I am also looking forward to experimenting with some of the other additions that reviewers have mentioned (walnuts...mmm...)

perfect and super easy. i used the pepperage farm bagged stuffing, just to make it even easier. i like the simplicity of it. i have tried the sausage stuffings, the ones with nuts n cranberries... the apples. i LOVE this stuffing the best. stuffing is bread. not all the other jazzed up versions. this is the one. after 2 days, with all the leftovers, there is no more stuffing. even the left over mashed potatoes outlasted this! Thanks for a traditional, wonderful stuffing!

Very similar to the basic dressing I've made for years only I lie the bread out the night before or it sends to be a bit too soggy?  Also, I sprinkle the pepper, poultry seasoning and/or sage directly onto the broken bread not into the melted butter. I also omit the salt, unnecessary and its not good for you anyway. :)  I also find that the chicken broth is unnecessary if you're stuffing a turkey however it may be a good idea to use it if you're baking the stuffing in a separate pan.

This was just on OK recipe for my family until I did some adjustments.  Instead of air-drying the bread, I lightly toasted the bread - much quicker.  I used a 13 ounce loaf of white bread instead of the pound, reduced the unsalted butter to 1 stick (1/2 C), and increased the poultry seasoning to 2 1/2 teaspoons.  Since there were no amounts listed for the salt and pepper, I played with that too and came up with 1 teaspoon sea salt and 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper, which will give me a consistant product every time.  With the changes it now gets a 10 STAR rating in my family.

Excellent recipe. I added 1/2 c. more chicken broth and used 1 tsp. poultry seasoning and 1 tsp. sage instead of the 2 tsp. poultry seasoning. I also cut the celery down to 3 stalks and used half wheat bread, half white bread. I let the bread sit out over a day so it was nice and dry (rather than the 1-2 hours). It was a hit at our Thanksgiving! Thanks to the author.

I used the dry seasoned (with onion and sage) bread cubes instead of the white bread, chicken stock instead of chicken broth, used just one tsp of poultry seasoning instead of the two the recipe called for, kept to the recipe for the butter, onion, and celery, and I added fresh sage (the leaves of one stalk, chopped).  I needed maybe two cups worth of stock, but the stuffing was fluffy and the bread didn't stick together.  I thought it might be too salty at first, but it was fine after it was baked. 

I try not to vary too much from a recipe, especially the first time I make it, but I had to since I was using the bagged bread cubes that were seasoned rather than plain white bread.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is the stuffing I grew up on. Very traditional (NE Ohio) and VERY tasty. I did add extra veggies and used several types of bread, ex. sourdough, 7 grain and a "dark" bread.

I used frozen french bread I had sitting in the freezer (I forgot which brand).  Im glad I used the french bread because it didnt fall apart at all and soaked up the sauce quite nicely.  I didnt know that it would hold together so well so i cut it in big chunks.  Next time I will cut it smaller in size and use 1/4 of loaf instead of 1/2.  Ate it with roast beef since we dont eat turkey.  The flavor matched very well.

This is basically the recipe I have always used - I tweak it a little by using raisin bread (or you could just add raisins or dried cranberries for Thanksgiving), chopped walnuts and one or two beaten eggs (depending on the consistency).  A great basic recipe.

GREAT! Made for Christmas dinner and had one guest come back 3 times for more.  Instead of chicken broth I used giblet broth that I made by simmering the giblets in water with onion, celery and poultry seasoning.  Probably used several cups of it too.  This is a keeper!

Fabulous!  i cooked my turkey half way, and then stuffed it... i can't stand the thought of the stuffung inside a raw bird... use some of the drippings after it has cooked and it flavors the stuffing just as good... this stuffing was really good... just like mom's!

Yay!  I finally found a stuffing recipe just like my Moms!  She never did get around to writing it down for me but this is it - she never used eggs or meat in her stuffing or ever stuffed it in the bird.  I cubed the bread and let it dry out overnight.  I doubled the recipe and it fit just right in a 9x13 pan.  Also, I found 8oz of broth just fine even for a double batch, but I kept foil on until the last 10 or 15 minutes of baking so it could brown, but not get too crunchy.  I will be using this recipe for all future Thanksgivings!

Just like mom used to make, except my mom taught me to put a beaten egg in the mixture.  We like our stuffing a little on the soggy side so the egg makes it perfect.

This is almost exactly like the recipe I got from a Family Circle cookbook and have used for years. Delicious! The only difference is that I also add 1 large, chopped carrot. It adds a touch of sweetness and some festive color to the stuffing.

Great recipe! It was my first attempt at making homemade stuffing. I followed the recipe exactly. I have been nominated to make this every Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it!

Delicious!  I used mostly whole-wheat bread with a tiny bit of chewy sourdough.  I found 3/4 cup chicken broth sufficent; anymore would have been too much.  But one may need to use the whole amount depending on what type of bread they used, how dry it is, etc.  This is just like my mom's, but it has the addition of the chicken broth, which I really enjoyed.  I added a tiny bit of sage and thyme to get some extra flavor.  Make sure to add the leaves from your celery stalks!

This was my first time making homemade stuffing and it turned out surprisingly wonderful! I wanted a simple recipe, but I forgot I had maple sausage in the fridge that I wanted to use. I let French baguette cubes air overnight before I toasted the bread for several minutes the next morning. In addition, I simply fried the sausage with celery/onions and omitted the butter. I also opted to bake in a buttered casserole dish instead of the Turkey. The finished product was wonderful and tasty. It was the only thing my finicky 7-year-old nephew would eat on Thanksgiving Day

This is just like the recipe I got from my mom but had misplaced.  This uses 1/4 cup more butter, which in fact made this stuffing better.  I also added some chopped walnuts, maybe 1/2 cup, cause that's how I always made it. Delicious! NO leftovers :-)

This is an awesome recipe! I added some fresh, sliced mushrooms in addition to the celery and it turned out very well! It went well with our baked bird (although I did cook it separetly) and potatoes! Down-home cooking at its best! Even leftovers were tasty...almost better! Thanks Carlota!

I was amazed how much this tasted like the box kind.  We made it in the oven without the turkey.  We toasted the bread first and let it get pretty crusty from sitting out, but is still turned out soggy.  I like mine fluffy, but this was pretty heavy.  The taste was divine.  My three little boys had a great time tearing all that bread apart.  We will do this again when we have time, but I will probably use the box version for convienience.

My husband said this was the best stuffing he's ever had!  The only thing I did differently was I used 1/2 loaf of wheat bread and 1/2 loaf of white bread.  The color variation was very pretty in the outcome.  The only thing I regret is not making more! It's the only thing we don't have as leftovers after our Thanksgiving dinner.

Perfect, basic stuffing- just like my mom would make for Thanksgiving. I either buy the unseasoned bread cubes, or slice a loaf of bread into cubes.  I added a bit more poultry seasoning than it called for.  Also for thanksgiving, I add some of the cooked turkey giblets.  Bake in a corningware pan with a lid, then remove the lid the last few minutes to give it a little crisp.

Just like mom and grandma used to make.  My only change is that I cooked it in my slow cooker for 5 hours (2 hours on high, 3 on low).

I increased this recipe and made it for 35 people.  This was very easy to make (except for the chopping) and I got lots of compliments.  I added some chopped walnuts and dried cranberries for a little texture and sweetness, it was perfect.  I'll be making this one again

Very tasty! We were out of onions, so we had to use onion powder instead and used cornbread in place of the white bread. It was delicious! The kids weren't too crazy about it, but hey... they're kids. :o)

This is very good!! This year my sister in law decided she would make the turkey for Christmas...but didn't want to make the stuffing. I offered to do it, but didn't have a recipe and we have picky eaters, so I needed something that would please everyone...
I only added some sunflower seeds and didn't measure anything.  
The result?  Everyone loved it!!
I'm making it again tonight for supper and added some cranberries.

This was so easy, but had wonderful homemade flavor.  I think any kind of bread would be good.  I used just regular store-bought white bread.  Just don't foreget it's in the oven!

Sooooo good! Like another reviewer I judged how much broth to add in. (and taste testing helped too!) I used fresh buttermilk bread I dried our myself overnight. And I also used predried bread at  the store and the buttermilk bread was hands down the best tasting by far, both were really yummy but the texture in the buttermilk was to live for! only  good reviews were to be said by my family and friends!

I added cranberries as per a previous reviewer's suggestion. This was good. I also cut a large carrot up very small, boiled them, and added it. It brought color and taste. I used Pepperidge Farm white bread cut up and toasted. I would definitely make it this way again.

This stuffing was so good! Never made my own before, and this was a hit!  I found it a little dry, even after adding extra broth, but I believe I left it in the oven for a little too long.  Next time, I will remember to take it out on time.  I think i will add more broth too, I like stuffing super moist

I'm sorry, but I tried two variations of this...one as written and one with sausage, granny smith apples and walnuts as described in one of the other reviews and we had plenty of both versions left over. The one person who loved it (my husband) thought the sausage version was worth 5 stars. It may just be that the rest of our family isn't into bread stuffing? I won't be making this one again.

Thie was great.  I read the reviews and changed it up a bit as recommended.  I added 2 chopped granny smith apples and a cup of craisens ans a lb of sage sausage.  I think it would have been very plain without the additions.

The taste of this stuffing was good, but the texture was not.  I had never made dressing before and so didn't know that an egg or two should be used as a binder.  As it stands, this is really just moist bread with vegetables- everything is separate- there's no cohesion.

I too grew up having this dressing for our holiday dinners.  It went from great grandma, to gradma, to mom and on down the line.  Never once changing the recipe.  Nothing like good old nostalgic foods to bring back the memories of yesteryear.  The taste, look, and family comments are why I gave this recipe a 10.  I have never stopped using this recipe and gather that you won't either.  ?

This was a very simple and tasty recipe for "from scratch" stuffing. My family does cornbread stuffing by tradition so it was not exactly to our taste, BUT this is completely do-able AND BLOWS boxed stuffing mixes out of the water. Highly recommend.  Used "Montreal Chicken Rub" as the poultry seasoning because I was unable to find anything just called "poultry seasoning".

This recipe is very close to our family recipe, however, I've never made it outside the turkey before, nor have I had any exact measurements.  We always went by taste and how it looked!  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS GREAT RECIPE.  The stuffing came out perfect!  Even better than in the turkey.  I doubled the recipe and added 2 tsp salt (the buttered I used was unsalted).  I also added 2 tsp sage in addition to the 2 tsp poultry seasoning.  I ended up with two casseroles and topped each off with about 1 Tbs butter (cut in little chips) on top and then drizzled a little more chicken broth on top before placing (uncovered) in the oven.  A tip for the bread:  I put the bread (in single layers) on cookie sheets and jelly roll pans in a 225 degree convection oven and turned the bread over every 5 minutes for a total of 20 minutes.  It reached just the right amount of dryness.

OMG  This was so easy and fantasic... so much so that I am writing my first reveiw ever after using this site for several years.  I am an expat living in Belgium (hubby works at NATO) so I used frech baguette bread and what they call a "champagne loaf" cut it all up and let it dry for a couple of days.  Cooked it in my crock pot (ovens here are tiny) and added walnuts and 2 granny smith apples chopped up as one reviewer suggested.  It was absolutely fantastic.  One of my guests is a professional chef and she asked for the recipe!   Thank you for submitting this!

This is really close to what my mom used to make but she added a can of cream of mushroom soup and used dried bread cubes for stuffing and added any old bread she had.  It made it very moist and oh so yummy.

Just like mom makes. I think I like the seasonings more than most people so I used about 2 tablespoons (tripling the amount). It also took about 10 hours for the bread to get dry enough here in humid BC.

This is a great way to put those heels of bread loaves to use if you have a family that doesn't eat them.  I let them dry, break them into pieces, and store them in a plastic container until I have enough for stuffing.

This is a great recipe, however i did modify it a bit. I used whole wheat slices of bread instead of white bread, and in order to dry them out faster, I put them in the oven while the turkey was cooking (i do not stuff my turkeys). And instead of using 2 t. of poultry seasoning, I used 1 t. of sage and 1 t of poultry seasoning. I will def make this again!

very good basic recipe for stuffing. The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that i feel like it could be seasoned a little more, but other than that, a good recipe

this was a great easy recipe but i was a little upset that it came out tasting much like your everyday stovetop. the recipe called to only dry your bread for a few hours but i choose overnite... which i still didnt think was long enough and ended up burning my bread and had to buy unseasoned dried crutons on thanksgiving morning just to be able to produce a stuffing. it still turned out great though even with my mistake at hand. I would say do add more broth than the recipe called for. I used a little over two cups and it still was a little dry after cooking!

If you have never made homeade stuffing, make this.  I was skeptical having never made it but it was to die for.  So much better than StoveTop. I baked it the day before Thanksgiving.  Then on Thanksgiving day I took the juice from the turkey and added to the stuffing, then reheated.  Everyone loved it and I vowed to never make the box kind again.  Needed more seasoning then called for and I did use extra liquid because we like it more.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was virtually perfect.  The only thing I might change is adding a little more poultry seasoning.  But that's just a personal preference.

Good, easy, basic and inexpensive to make.  The stuffing in the turkey came out quite wet when I just air dried the bread on one try.  TIP: I "dried" the bread in the oven on four cookie sheets at 325*.  It was faster than waiting 1-2 hours for them to air dry and the stuffing wasn't soggy when the bird was done.

I also grew up on this recipe. After reading a few reviews, I thought I'd add this as well. My mom and I always add two eggs to the recipe and some sage. Stuff the turkey with this recipe and bake the rest in a glass pan sprayed with Pam. You have two different textures since the turkey dressing is moist and the one in the pan gets a nice crust on top (use a pastry brush with some egg white/butter)- we fight over the corner pieces!!! Best recipe ever. Happy Turkey day!

I make this same recipe except I add shredded carrots with the celery and onion to add alittle sweetness and instead of Chicken broth, I use veggie broth since I am a vegetarian.  Bell's poultry seasoning is the key to the flavor.  We cook a Quorn Vegetarian Roast with this stuffing which makes a great Vegetarian Thanksgiving option.

My mother made nearly the same recipe for our turkey except when you are cooking the celery and onions you add 1/2 pound of Bob Evans Sage flavored Sausage (The smell is awesome when it cooks!!!) and she stuffed it in the turkey.  My Hubby hates celery so I tried using apples instead of the celery but it was no where near the same so I probably will never eat this again but OHH the memories!

My hubby likes a simple stuffing (while I like stuffing with italian sausage). This is the winner in our household for the holidays. To save time and $$, I just buy the dried bread cubes already made for stuffing. Works great.

This recipe was so easy and fooled my grandmother who always makes homemade stuffing with pork.  She thought there was meat in the stuffing.  I put my in the oven in a casserole dish.  I didn't really measure everything (including the butter) and it still turned out wonderful.  I think the poulty seasoning really makes the difference.
On a note: I used wonderbread white bread and cut it up while it was still soft.  I placed it in a pyrex dish and covered it with saran wrap and left it on the counter.  Some cubes were harder and some softer but it worked out perfectly.  I ended up using more chicken stock than called for but I added a little at a time.
Super tasty!!!

Awesome stuffing! This has to be one of the best stuffings I've ever had. I would say that you don't need to add much salt to it though. I had added some salt, but I think the salt from the broth would have been enough.

Simple and delicious.  Try adding 1 pound of browned ground beef for a richer stuffing - rave reviews!  I also use French bread, because all that crust gives the stuffing a nice texture.

I do not know how to cook and I have never made any stuffing other than stove top, but this Thanksgiving I tried this recipe.  It was so easy and it came out perfect. My family couldn't believe I actually made it. I will definately use this one again.

This stuffing was perfect.  Even my "stuffing expert" Grandma was raving about it! This time I used dried bread cubes by toasting them in the oven and it was waaaaay better.  Perfectly moist and not soggy.  Yum yum yum!!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. It's a great, simple bread dressing that is flavorful, but not overly seasoned. I used a whole can of chicken broth, and baked it in a casserole. Fantastic! Thank you, Carlota.

This was my first attempt at stuffing from scratch and it got rave reviews from my family!  I took the advice of others and used half white and half wheat bread which I toasted and sprinkled with onion and garlic powder.  I also added a bit more chicken broth than was called for.  Thanks for the recipe - it will be a Thanksgiving standard for me!

I made this in the crockpot and it turned out great! I added 8oz of sliced fresh portabella mushrooms and saut√©ed them with the celery & onion.  Instead of baking I placed the mixture in a crockpot for 1hr on high and then an additional 3 hrs on low.

This stuffing is a big hit with the family at every holiday. I'm roped into making it every year.  One piece of advice: If you bake it instead of stuffing the turkey with it, bake it in pyrex glass baking pan.  If the stuffing is deep (i.e. in a dutch oven), it stays soggy. If the stuffing mix is spread out about 2-3 inches deep in a baking pan, it comes out just right. Check it at about 20-30 minutes to make sure it doesn't get too dry.

This is exactly how my Mum and Granny use to make their stuffing. I could always do without turkey, potatoes, etc at Christmas but give me a plate of stuffing and I am very happy. As I now live in the tropics, celery is not always available ( imported ) so when I am able to buy it, I chop and freeze. If I do not have enough celery, I substitute a local veg, christophene, which does the trick.  This is a wonderful recipe and I would not change a thing. Thank you Carlota for bringing back memories and saving me money now that I no longer buy Stove Top stuffing ( that too is imported and VERY VERY expensive.

Very good recipe. I did modify it a bit by buying stuffing cubes (both cornbread and regular), but used the basic overall recipe mix. Since I've been struggling with stuffing for a few years - everything just turned out wrong with it - I'm very happy to now have a reliable, good stuffing recipe! Thanks.

I don't like adding stuffing in the bird, so we make this as a side in a buttered casserole.  This recipe has great flavor, but I do add a beaten egg or two (that's what my Mom used to do)to help bind it together.

This is the same basic recipe I've been using for years. The only difference is that instead of leaving the bread out for a couple hours, I toast the bread cubes in the oven, in batches, to firm them up. This helps keep it from getting soggy. I also mix it up and use a combination of white bread, sourdough bread and sometimes french bread. I double the recipe and cook half of it by itself, and half inside the turkey. I think this year I'll use the crock pot for the non-turkey batch, to free up space in the oven.

This was my first time making stuffing from scratch and it turned out very tasty! What I did differently was make my own croutons (cut a loaf of French bread into cubes, toss in some melted butter/garlic powder/parsley, then bake for 10-15 mins), and I added mushrooms to the onion/celery mixture. I didn't have poultry seasoning or sage, but it still turned out pretty good. Will try it with sage next time, as it seems that sage is the main/more popular flavouring in stuffing!

SO TASTY! I had a lot of bread left over from previous meals so yesterday I just made bread cubes (tossed with a little butter/olive oil) out of them, then today I tried this recipe.  I did however cut down the butter to 1/2 cup (due to bread cubes already having some), 3tsp poultry seasoning, and had to add more chicken broth though. I may experiment with this and see if I can reduce the butter content and still have it taste good because WOW there is a lot of butter action in this!

This is basically the same recipe my mom always made when I was growing up. I love it because it is classic stuffing - none of the fancy stuff involving oysters or sausage or whatever. Basic and classic. Wonderful.

I made this recipe (for the first time ever) this Thanksgiving and it was delicious and perfect - it will be my go-to stuffing recipe from now on. It was easy to make and cooked up beautifully. I did a double batch, put half in my turkey, and baked the other half in a casserole dish in the oven.

I finally settled on this stuffing recipe...it was SO hard to choose!  I didn't want to "over do" the flavors and so many others seemed to have too much going on.  I made it as stated and then it was so easy that I got brave.  I ended up adding one chopped up Granny Smith apple (next time I'll add two), pecans (lots) and a pound of the Jimmy Dean sage sausage.  I used four baguette loaves of french bread, I used baguettes because I like the flavor that the crust provides and then I also threw in about half a loaf of homemade 1/2 whole wheat bread (although I didn't even notice it in the final product).  This was beyond delicious! My husband who is a Stovetop worshiper (we've only been married 3 months...don't worry, I'll convert him!) and he said that it was truly the best stuffing ever.  He said that the "extras" weren't extra at all and that they made the dish. Here I was thinking that I would shock his simple bacheloresque taste buds and he actually liked all of the flavors.  Hooray!  Thanks for the base recipe, it's a great kick off to add extras that you know that your family likes!

I have used this recipe for 34 years.However when the children were small they didn't like the celery or onions. So one year i took my cuisinart and blended them in an almost liquid. It was amazing--- same taste  and texture minus the celery and onions pieces. Tess

Have made a similar recipe for years handed down from my great-grandmother.  With a few exceptions (we use the giblets from the turkey) cook them with chicken broth and vegs.  Then we grind them with a blender and add the stuffing.  Also we always use sage.  This is so yummy.  My favorite side for the holidays.

I started making this a few years ago.  Last year I was asked to bring it to a family dinner at an in-law's.  It must have impressed folks because I was asked to bring "that yummy dressing" again this year. It's easy and can be used in or out of the bird.  Just adjust to the moistness you prefer by increasing or reducing the broth and add an egg or two if you like. It's versatile.  Go for it!

This has been in our family for 40 year or more.  We just keep throwing the heels of bread, bread that died out, uneaten toast, etc in a bag and then crumble or dice it up for thanksgiving stuffing.  We add enough broth to make it moist, go easy on the sage, it can taste bitter fast!  If in doubt, look at the ingredients in "poultry seasoning"  and use less, then add more of the ones on the label that you like the most.  We also use raisins in it for a sweet/salty combination.  Its usually a hit with everyone unless they are really the diehard cornbread/sausage/nuts type stuffing eaters-ugh.  I don't care for how heavy sausage stuffings can be and all the nut allergies make this easy.

So good! I dried the bread by baking the slices at 350 until lightly golden, then cut it up. Used a full 2 cups chopped celery and 2 cups chopped onion. Used veggie broth to make vegetarian, and added in a handful of chopped fresh parsley.

very good and much easier than i thought making stuffing would be. I used a loaf of homemade italian bread that i made 2 days before and had to use up. I would not use regular sandwich bread, it would be to soft and soggy.  I put this stuffing on top of a couple chicken breasts and cooked it in the oven and was a good simple dinner.

Easy and delicious. Made it to go along with a turkey breast for Xmas. Went with a little over a cup of chicken broth (like mine a little more together) but kept everything else the same; it made the house smell wonderful, and was a great competitor to my mother's in-bird stuffing recipe. She loved it!

I have never successfully made stuffing that didn't come out of a box - until I found this recipe!  It is easy and quick and it tastes fantastic!  I only changed one thing - I used 100% whole wheat bread instead of white.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I loved it!

Turned out exactly how I had imagined! I omitted celery and used sliced white bread. I used exactly the amount of broth the recipe called for and thought the consistency was perfect - not too moist, not too dry.

First time making stuffing, used Pepperidge Farms Homestyle White -- cut into cubes and dried overnight, then toasted for 10 mins or so in a 200 oven.  Combined all, put in my Pampered Chef round stone, refrigerated, then lightly covered with aluminum foil to bake for 35 mins.  Perfect.  Many, many compliments.  And soo easy.

Not to bad. Its the first time i have made stuffing and it was really easy.  I did however use less celery and poultry seasoning. I also added an egg to bind it together.  Would make again!

I veganized it by using "fake" chicken broth and vegan "butter" and added some garlic and mushrooms.  Other than that kept it the same and its great!

Very, very good. Easy enough to make and the kids helped. I found it a little salty from the broth though.

This was exactly what I was looking for, Simple yet classic. I made a couple additions added one cubed apple and about 1/4 cup craisins to the celery and onion and it was fantastic!  Everyone loved it.

I used whole wheat bread, one sweet onion and I added in a half cup of shredded carrot. I also used organic chicken broth. YUM. Great basic recipe to serve with Caramel Apple Pork Chops and you could really take this and bend it to make it whatever kind of stuffing you wanted from here. VERY simple.

Excellent!  Made stuffed, rolled turkey breast with this stuffing for Christmas dinner.  I air dried the italian bread for 2 days.  I did not have poultry seasoning so for seasoning just used fresh ground pepper, dried thyme, and a little (maybe 1/2 tsp of dried fennel seed).  I used unsalted butter and the chicken broth was 50% less sodium - didn't need to add any salt in the end.   Best Part.... I sauted the onion, celery and added the seasoning the night before and in the morning just had to heat up the mixture and add the bread and chicken broth.  I added a little more broth - maybe 1/4 cup more - till bread cubes maybe half soft and half still firm.  It was enough stuffing for two turkey breasts.  Rolled it up in the breasts.  Roasted turkey till middle 165 degrees. Came out perfect!  All loved it.   Will keep this recipe for sure.

Good basic recipe.  I used french bread, which gave it a light and delightful crispiness/chewiness that was just enough texture to make it interesting.  Might try adding some pear or cranberries next time to add a little pizazz.

i use a variation of a recipe like this each year, using broth from the boiled turkey neck and gizzards.  also i add sliced mushrooms and caramelize the veggies well in loads of melted butter.  this is the dish i take for lunch everyday so i'm sure to make lots extra.  stuffing with gravy and fresh whole cranberry sauce makes an excellent lunch, along with a little green bean casserole...i am thinking of making stuffing with brown bread this year.

This recipe is pretty close to the one I grew up with.  With the additions of chopped black olives, and  2 raw eggs.  It holds it together. Extra poultry seasonings and ground sage.  Sometimes I use cooked chopped giblets from the turkey and it's broth. (water I used to cook the giblets in).  Along with the chicken broth.   I use 2 packages of  dried stuffing mix you get at the grocery store. My favorite.

This was super! I made a couple of changes: I substituted some of the butter with more broth and used sage in place of the poultry seasoning because I didn't have any. Thanks for the recipe, Carlota! :)

This is the stuffing I grew up with and now make as an adult (I made it today!). I've never had a single person not like it. In fact, I've had a number of guests who claim to hate stuffing try a bite and they love it! Sometimes simple is better. I bake it in a separate dish, not in the bird.

This is similar to the stuffing my mother and grandmother used to make. They never used a recipe so I tried to adjust it to how I remember them doing it...This is what I did: I used Oat nut bread since that is what I had on hand and threw in a few hot dog buns from the freezer to make enough and then I toasted it all in the toaster and diced it. I sauted extra celery (6-8 stalks) and 1/2 onion in 1/2 cup butter. I threw in some canned chicken as well. I used 1 cup chicken broth and about 2 - 2 1/2 cups milk, and 3 eggs. (2 tsp. poultry seasoning is perfect) Instead of baking it, I sauted it in the rest of the butter in a large no stick pan over low to med.heat, covered, flipping it at least once taking care not to stir too much. It is sooo delicious my husband was upset that his stomach wouldn't hold more and can't wait for leftovers. note: I think the reason it takes more liquid is because the oat nut bread is very heavy and dense?? and I like it very moist, but not mush though. UPDATE: I always use homemade bread and it always turns out with my changes. Yummy! Try adding some craisins or sauted apples

Made this for Thanksgiving, and was alright. It was very easy to prepare, but does not taste like Mom's. If you are having larger crowds, you may want to increase the size a bit, tried to feed 11 but wasn't enough.

Excellent. Everyone devoured it. Didn't have celery so i added the white parts of some green onions instead. Also i used old old french loaf of bread and cubed accordingly. Didn't have poultry seasoning but i did have sage dried and some frozen fresh....Again this is an easy winner.

I made this stuffing on Thanksgiving and it was a hit!!  I used wheat bread, laid the bread out to dry and then cut into chunks and sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled on seasonings and baked them.  I did not use the poultry seasoning, just minced garlic and a spice mix.  I also added dried cranberries and cherries and mixed cubed apple with the onions and celery.  It was fantastic!!  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt at making stuffing from scratch!  It was such a hit for Thanksgiving. This is a recipe we will use over and over again!  One change I made, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, it added a rich flavor to the stuffing.

Amazing. My first attempt at from-scratch stuffing and I will never go back to the boxed stuff. I used a loaf of homemade wheat bread that I had in the freezer (it was 1¬Ω pounds) and followed the rest of the recipe, and I added around 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it fit perfectly. My stuffing came out a little crispy on top, but that's my fault. I meant to add a little broth as it was cooking. It was so excellent! Thanks for sharing, Carlota!

Yum!  Doubled the recipe & realized too late that I didn't have quite enough bread (1 1/2 loaf), oh well, couldn't tell, it was still fabulous!  Made the recipe otherwise as called for.  After it was all together and in the crock pot, I felt it was a little too dry, but simply added another 1/2 c. chicken broth and it was perfect.  Next time I will add sage & dried cranberries just to mix it up, and also, sage flavored ground sausage maybe too... a great recipe to be able to make little adjustments like that and have it still turn out amazing!

I was looking for a recipe similar to what my mom makes and this was really close. Not sure if I had too much bread but I did have to add more chicken broth to moisten the bread cubes. It turned out pretty well but was a little greasy tasting from the butter and didn't have enough seasoning for my taste. Next time I think I will increase the amount of poultry seasoning, decrease the butter, and it should be about perfect.  Thanks so much for posting this.

This was fabulous with variations. I doubled it, used almost 3 loaves of bakery bread - marble rye, cracked wheat and Italian. Also added the 16 oz Jimmy Dean Sage sausaged all cooked and drained. Added 2 beaten eggs. Probably used more poultry seasoning than the original called for, and I added some lemon pepper and a dash of garlic salt. About 2/3 of it stuffed a 21 pound turkey and the rest in a 1 1/2 quart greased casserole. This was so good, everyone LOVED it. By far the best stuffing/dressing I've ever made.

First time making stuffing. This was very easy to make! 4 stalks of celery is WAY to much. I used 1 1/2 stalks and might even cut back to 1 stalk next time. Otherwise, excellent recipe!!

Perfect! I used a multi grain bread and put half of the loaf out overnight and then used a few slices of fresh bread when I was putting it all together. Fabulous! I did not stuff turkey, just prepared in a casserole dish. Wonderful!

Really good, basic celery stuffing.  Use it every Thanksgiving with the turkey.  Tastes just like what my mom used to make when I was a kid.

Great traditional stuffing! The only change I made was to use french bread instead of white to give it more substance. I also added a little more broth, maybe a ladel full half way through baking. I made this again this thanksgiving and I can't rave about it enough! Everyone loved it! It's FANTASTIC!

excellent recipe, very simple. we brine our turkey so i decided to this out of the bird. due to lack of oven space i ended up putting it in a crock pot. i made it the night before and it looked like it dried out, so when it started to warm in the crock pot, i added more chicken broth and some drippings from my turkey. it was a total hit. i saw guests with seconds of just stuffing! go figure!

This is my go-to recipe for stuffing!  I always make more so I can stuff the bird and bake some on the side!
I usually make this with french bread and my extra addition is always 1 1/2 tsp summer savoury spice.

Last time I made this, I added smoked bacon to the dish that was cooked separate from the turkey.  Just dice up some bacon, cook it until it gets a bit crispy.  Transfer bacon to a plate with paper towel to drain the fat.  Then add to the mixture. 

Both versions were big hits at the dinner table!

This is the only stuffing I will be making from now on.  However, I couldn't rate it as "the best" b/c we added an extra cup of chicken broth before baking (it just seemed too dry with only one).

We varied this recipe a little bit.  I used 2 parts french bread and 1 part whole wheat bread, and I think that was a very good ratio.  In addition to the poultry seasoning, we added 4 fresh sage leaves, chopped fine, and cooked them with the celery and onion.  I made broth from the giblets of my turkey and used that for the broth.  I put mushrooms into the broth, but did not chop them up and add to the stuffing.  It gave a nice mushroom flavor, but none of the "mushroom chunks" that my husband hates.  =)  Then, once it was in the casserole dish, we sprinkled the top lightly with more poultry seasoning. We baked it for 45 minutes, covered with foil until the last 15 minutes.  When we pulled it out, the top was browned nicely, and the rest of it was moist, but not gummy/soggy.  This stuffing had a little bit too much celery for my taste, but it's called bread and CELERY stuffing, so there ya go.  The celery was still crisp in the end, and I didn't care for that.  I'll definitely make this recipe again, but I'll cut the celery in half, and I'll measure my broth out and boil the celery in the broth first to get it good and soft.  Ohter than that, I thought it was delicious, and I'll never use pre-packaged stuffing again!

This is the fifth Thanksgiving for which I've made this stuffing. I made it exactly as directed the first three years, and it was amazing every time. The only problem with it is that there are never any leftovers because everyone devours it!

Last year I added dried cranberries, and that was delicious. I just added dried cranberries and two Granny Smith apples (for a 20-serving batch,) and it's another hit! (I personally prefer it without the apples but with the cranberries, but my husband loves it with both. Either way, it's delicious. Thanks for this great recipe, it's definitely become a family favorite. 

I agree with all the other reviewers who said to only add the broth a bit at a time. I don't even measure it, I just add a bit and stir, add and stir, until the mixture is all coated but not soaked.

Great recipe if you love traditional stuffing like i do. I had Thanksgiving dinner at my house for the first time last year and worried that it wouldn't be as good as my mom's or aunt's, and everyone LOVED this stuffing. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is also the recipe I grew up with, although there are several things I do differently, I boil the giblets from the turkey and use the water from that, add some of the drippings from the turkey (cutting back on the butter)and simmer it with the celery, including the leaves better than parsly, seasonings and onions, maybe throw in some minced mushrooms. I also finely dice some of the giblets and throw those in, mainly the liver it's healthy and people rarely even notice its in there!

I was suprised such a simple recipe could be so good! I made it as described the first time, then the second time I used a complete box of Stove Top turkey stuffing in place of the bread. Both ways it was super good and easy, though I found the consistency better using the box stuffing. I will be using this recipe for this year's holidays!

I made this for Thangsgiving, and it turned out so well. I followed the recipe exactly except I made it vegetarian by using vegetable broth and baking it in a casserole with buttered foil on top. Really easy and really good!

My grandmother always made the best stuffing.  She never passed down her recipes but when i saw the ingredients to this recipe I thought it sounded a lot like hers. I was right!  This recipe took me back 30 years!  Delicious!  This has become my stuffing staple. Thank you!!

It was my first time making stuffing and it turned out great.  I used 1- 60% whole wheat baguette and 6 slices of white Wonder bread.  I cut up the bread and toasted it in the oven until dry.  I used more than 1 cup of broth and continued to check the stuffing in the oven for moisture, adding broth as needed. I also added mushrooms into the sautee. Great recipe, just as good/or better than packaged stuffing mix.

Unbelievable!  This was soooo easy and it went over BIG! My husband had been begging for dressing to go along with our organic roasted chicken and homemade cranberry sauce (yum), but I'd never made it before.  This recipe made me look like a gourmet cook and it is going in my keeper file.

CHANGES: We used whole wheat homemade bread and our homemade chicken broth.  It was awesome!

So simple yet so good! After years of making fancy and expensive stuffings for Thanksgiving I decided to go more simple this year. This dressing was the best of all my stuffings becasue of it's familiar and simple ingredients. Before placing in the casserole dish I kept seasoning with salt, pepper and poultry seasoning. I ended up putting much more seasoning in the dish than called for. The right amount of seasoning will make or brake this dish. Enjoy!

My first time making stuffing and it was a big hit!!
TIP: Cut your bread into cubes before it hardens. 
I let my bread air our for a day. I wanted to make sure it wasnt too soggy.
I used two loafs of fancy bread that walmart sells. One loaf of white and one of wheat. This gave it more texture and color. 
Lot's of people asked for the recipe. And it was so cheap to make. less than $10.00 to serve 20 people.

I left the bread out overnight.  It was perfectly delicious.  I put it all in the turkey.  I'm going to try just baking it in a casserole dish next time.  Make extra- it goes fast!!

This was my first time ever making my own dressing/stuffing.  Delicious! Bought the bread already dried and cubed at the Publix deli.  Comes in a 1 lb bag for the holidays.  Added 2 eggs beaten and a little less than 1/4 cup white vinegar to bind and give a an extra zing.  That was suggested by my sister in law who makes her own dressing every year.  I will use this basic begining and add to it as I get creative over the coming years.  Thank you!

This is how I make it.  I like to dry it out for much longer and use a combo of whole wheat and white for looks and taste.  Plus I double it atleast.  THis year I'm making the bread in my breadmaker.

I'm the most picky stuffing/dressing person.  Until this recipie, I only liked my aunt's.  I followed it for the most part, but tweaked amounts according to taste.  I did toast the bread as was suggested by another.  Excellent!  New family tradition!

Wow! I made this gluten free with Bette Hagman's pizza recipe. Yes, I know, it sounds a bit weird... But the pizza crust made a phenomenal bread and it was really quick and easy. I loved this recipe. I added celery seed to the poultry seasoning and it was fabulous. I don't think I'll ever search for a different stuffing recipe. This was amazing!!!

Perfect.  This is exactly what I was looking for, a traditional homemade stuffing.  I halved the recipe to serve 4, toasted the bread in the oven and, as per another review, just eyeballed the chicken stock. Cooked it in the oven with a turkey breast. Delicious.

I have used this recipe for several years now, and as I got it out for X-Mas I had to comment on how easy and tasty it is. If you are used to a stuffing with a little more zip, add sausage, cornbread, mushrooms -- really anything works!

We do the baked in an open roaster pan, everyone fights over the crisp top. Also make for new years with mashed potatoes, porkroast, &sauerkraut. Pile the potatoes & dressing and put your gravy overtop.  My grown children take my leftovers home to "snack" on.

My husband, who has always refused to eat stuffing because he hated it, couldn't get enough of this stuffing! He was eating it for breakfast! I couldn't fit all of it in the turkey so I microwaved the rest, which wasn't as good but still a hit. The house smelled great when I was preparing it. YUM

Excellent and simple recipe!  I made this with half white bread and half cornbread yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was a definite hit.  It is worth the effort to make from scratch than use the old crummy Stove Top.  Highly recommended!

This is the perfect recipe for a traditional, homestyle stuffing. I spent last Thankgiving outside the US and didn't have access to the box mix, so it was my first attempt making real stuffing. I used french bread cubes and it turned out even better than I expected. It also makes a great side dish for a comforting winter meal when you're in the mood for something nostalgic.

Not too shabby for traditional stuffing.  Tastes like the stuffing my grandmother used to make.  I'm not horribly fond of extremely flavorful and powerful stuffings.  I enjoy a more mellow taste, and this recipe did it.

I thought this recipe was perfect for hosting my very first Thanksgiving dinner.  It was short, simple, and to the point.  Instead of regular white bread, I used a loaf of French bread, and a loaf of sourdough bread, and toasted them ahead of time.  It all turned out really great, and the different flavors of bread gave it a unique twist.

Very good.  I made this the night before, chilled in fridge over night, and baked the time stated in casserole the next day.  Followed recipe exactly.

I have been using this recipe now for two years, and it is the best!  I like the fact that it is NOT salty as most purchased mixes are.  I also find that I can make this in the morning and save room in the oven by cooking it in the slow cooker, if you like a moist stuffing, this works great.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Carlota, it disappears quickly.

Positively delicious!!!!  This is the first time I've made stuffing that turned out worthy of eating...and this was so easy.  I followed the directions exactly, using some leftover white bread that I had made in my bread machine and some sweet harvest wheat bread that I had on hand.  The stuffing was so wonderful!!  In fact it was so good, that I started eating it before I even cooked it!!  YUM!

This was my first time not using a box stuffing, and I was thrilled with the outcome.  I did cut up two french bread loaves into cubes, brushed them with butter, and baked them until they toasted, and it had just a hint of crunch.  The taste was fabulous!!  My only complaint is it didn't make very much, definitely not 10 servings, but maybe my family just takes bigger portions!!  I'll double the recipe next time, because I will use this recipe every time I want to make stuffing!!  Good-bye Stove-top!!

This is the recipe that has been in my family ever since I can remember. We add sage to ours.  I am 25 and still remember being 4 and tearing up loaves and loaves of bread for moms stuffing.  This will always be a staple on my Thanksgiving table even if we decide to TRY other stuffings.  This is a sure thing.  Plus it is way better than boxed or bagged.  It is not the turkey I long for leftovers of days after thanksgiving it is this stuffing.

I usually do not use a recipe for my dressing:  this one was like what I always aim for but don't always hit when I don't measure.  I like to very lightly toast the bread, then let my 9 year old tear it up.

I had tons of white bread for some reason, so I decided to make this and use it up.  I didnt have time to let the bread cubes dry out as long as I should have, and wonder how much of a difference it made.  This was good, my husband said it was better than any of the quick stuffings you buy in a box.  Very easy, and definately would be easy to tweak per your families preferences.  Next time I might but some sausage and apple in it.

Looking at the short list of ingredients, I couldn't believe the rave reviews, but I tried it.  I ran out of time and had to bake dry a loaf of bread - next time I will make the effort to leave it out a day or less - I think it makes all the difference.  I baked it out of the turkey, and used mushrooms instead of onion (it gave it great flavor).  Great, great stuffing - I will make it again next year, thanks!  Two thumbs up from the boyfriend too (groaned in delight after the first bite)!!

Perfect stuffing recipe very similar to the one my grandma makes. The only difference is hers calls for 1 beaten egg to hold the stuffing together better, which I added. I made stuffing for our Thanksgiving dinner this year, and got several complements. Easy to make, tasty and reheats very well. Thanks for the great recipe.

Great stuffing recipe.  I'll definitely use it again.  Changed one thing a little bit....I cubed the bread and toasted in the oven til a little bit golden and then used 2-3 cups stock to moisten.   Out of all our leftovers this will be the first thing finished.

Very tasty, this is a good recipe that will please everyone. I used one half teaspoon additional poultry seasoning and doubled the chicken broth as was recomended by another review. It was the perfect consistency; not too mushy or crunchy. I also used pre-cut unseasoned bread cubes. I'll definately use this recipe for years to come.

I cut the bread into cubes before toasting it... makes for a nice final texture.  also I used herbes de provence instead of the poultry seasoning.  a big hit with my british housemates who always ask for "american-style stuffing."

Heels and leftover bread are best. The more dry and stale the bread, the better. I've used white, wheat, French, Italian, rye, and cornbread. All have turned out yummy. I've also tossed in chopped walnuts, chopped apples, cranberries, and sausage, depending on the type of bread I used.

My husband could not stop eating this stuffing.  It took about 3 days to dry out a fresh loaf of white bread, so 1-2 hours will just not do.  Also I used about 2 cups of chicken stock.  This served 5 adults just fine; but for a larger crowd I would certainly double this recipe.

Have been making this stuffing for Thanksgiving meal, for many years. It works with any kind of bread , even the bagged mix from the store.
I always double the broth( we like it quite moist) and add 1 beaten egg when the stuffing cools down a bit. That helps it hold together better when serving. Also, it can be made and baked a day ahead and reheated before serving.

I used pre-made stuffing croutons (a whole bag) and 1/2 a bag of the crumb stuffing. I doubled the veggies and added 2 cups of sauted mushrooms too. I did not double the dry poultry seasoning but instead added a tablespoon of chopped fresh sage, 1 t fresh chopped thyme and 1 t chopped fresh rosemary to the mix. Basically followed the method and in a couple of instances the advice of several reviewers (added eggs too cause gramma always did and needed additional broth too cause my bread was way dry). Came out like I remembered hers -it was yummy, thanks!

Great, simple recipe.  I've made this for several holidays and everyone has loved it.  I  love how simple it is and tastes delicious.  Mine has turned out perfect every time.  I usually let my bread sit out overnight with the seasoning, sometimes if I want a little more crunch I put the cubed bread in the oven and toast it for several minutes on 400 degrees.  I will even broil the last several minutes just at the end for a little crunchy crust on top.

Will be making this today.  It sounds like the traditional dressing I used to make. I am going to assume  that 4 'stalks' of celery really means  4 ribs.

I love stuffing and dressing!  I make this recipe each year with Ma Lipo's Apricot Glazed Turkey with Roasted Onion and Shallot gravy.  I use a 22 pound bird and end up with a little extra mixture left over and end up baking the extra to make dressing for those that want a dryer version.  If you like dressing with sausage this is not for you.  It is a classic bread and celery stuffing that tastes amazing.  The only thing I do differently is use a loaf of French or Italian bread and cube it the nights before so it's nice and dry then use homemade veggie stock.  Everything else stays the same and makes the most amazing stuffing.  Get's compliments every year.

This was my first time making stuffing and this recipe was so easy.  So simple and yet so delicious.  This one is a keeper.  :)

Love this!  I triple this and make it vegan by using Earths Best Organic Vegan Butter and homemade organic vegetable broth.

Very similar to our family recipe passed down from our ancestors from Germany. The only difference, saute some green peppers with the onion and celery. We don't use the butter but rather Crisco instead. My mother-in-law now uses my family recipe now.

This is a tried and true recipe. I save all the ends from sandwich loaves for this purpose. If you dry the bread in the oven at a low temp, it accelerates drying and prevents sogging.  I make my own stock with the poultry neck and giblets and the veggies in a rough cut.  I separate the veggies from the stock and finely chop them.  I also add chopped walnuts and finely chopped apples for an added twist.  Always a hit!

I've been using this recipe for the past year or so, but I had to make some changes, because on it's own it's only okay. I usually add 1-2 eggs, depending how much bread I use. I toast half of my bread cubes for some texture. I like to add extra seasonings to the poultry seasoning, sometimes rosemary, sometimes parsley, and sometimes thyme, and then sometimes all of them. This recipe is a good starting point, but I do think you need to expand upon it to make it a "wow" stuffing/dressing. I would recommend adding the broth/stock a little at a time to your liking. I like mine moist, but with eggs I never use a full 1 cup of broth.

This stuffing is great! I needed it fast so I cubed my bread and toasted it in 225 oven until completely crunchy.  The flavor and texture was wonderful.

The only thing I did differently was added two eggs after I added the bread cubes. Otherwise this recipe is perfect! It turned out amazing, my family loved it.

Delicious.  I baked my own white bread (Amish white bread on this website with only 1/4C sugar) and then let it harden a few days.  I then cut it into cubes and let it sit out another two nights before I made the stuffing.  I had to use a little more chicken stock than the recipe called for, but the recipe overall was close to perfect.  Thanks!

Homemade bread. That is key. Just did a dry run on this reciepe. I halved it and used homemade white bread that I had baked the day before. The slices had been drying overnight. I still used a full cup of chicken broth and it could have used more. Amazing!

Usually we stuff the turkey, but this year we tried it separate and the stuffing/dressing turned out fantastic!!  I needed to add more butter and stock next time (I used more bread) as it didn't stick together.  But still fantastic!

I used bagged bread cubes and doubled the recipe. Good thing I did because it was a huge hit. I was able to stuff the turkey full and still have a 9 x 11 dish. Will make again next year.

This is just about the same recipe I've used for over 40 years! The only difference is I use some sage and warm milk instead of the chicken broth. My family loves this stuffing wouldn't let me change this even if I wanted to!

I used wheat bread, extra butter, less celery, sage instead of poultry seasoning 2 cups of chicken broth. I added mushrooms and apples. I cooked it at 375 for 25 to 30 minutes.
 Yes I changed everything about this recipe and then came on to write a review about a recipe I do not even make.
 Come on people, rate the recipe. Make it as it says and then if it turns out like  let us know so we do not bother making it. If you stick to the recipe and it turns out good that is all we need to know.

Absolutely delicious. I never really liked stuffing before I had this recipe and the whole family agreed. I followed other readers' advice and added the package of Jimmy Dean sausage and a granny apple. Amazing.

This recipe worked great even when baking the stuffing on the stove top!
I was nervous because it was my first Thanksgiving to cook a dish I'd never made from scratch before AND I live abroad. However, it was a success. I was told that it tasted just like a recipe they'd eaten at home, made by someone who'd been making it for 30 years.

I thought this was good but I felt it needed more chicken broth and butter, once I added that it was very tasty.

Just made this today and it was delicious! I was looking for a recipe close to my mom's and this one looked very similar. I think it turned out even a little better. This one is a keeper!

My Mom made this as well....and it's the only recipe that my family consistantly loves.With a minor moderation......No chicken broth.....and I add diced mushrooms (adds moisture to the bread with little difference in flavor, so less fat... lol), and I add fresh herbs where possible, so some oregano, fresh savory , thyme etc.  My Mom's recipe was kick-butt, she used to save the bacon fat for a week or so (in the fridge) leading up to the preparation of stuffing....and instead of butter, she would add melted bacon fat! My God.......it was amazing. What flavour and so moist......so improvise and enjoy! Add a little of each, butter and  bacon drippings. What the heck! It's Thanksgiving!

This is a good "basic" stuffing recipe, but like many recipes I made my own little tweaks to it.  I cooked the neck & gizzards for about 45 min, in lightly salted water with a teaspoon of poultry seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon of chicken bouillon.  I then used that as the broth and took the meat from the neck and chopped it & the gizzards finely to add to the stuffing.  I also added a diced apple and 1 large egg beaten.  I cooked half in the bird and the other half in a casserole and it turned out great.  I've made a lot of stuffing recipes over the years, but this way is by far the best.

This is a great base recipe that I use all the time with slight modification.  Instead of poultry seasoning, I use Bell's.  It is a blend of Rosemary, oregano, sage, ginger, margoram, thyme and pepper.  I also use milk instead of chicken broth.  If you cook the stuffing in the bird, there is no need.  Excellent and making it right now as we speak!

Delicious and easy! I added poultry seasoning to the stuffing to give it that chicken flavor before I put it inside the chicken.

I no longer stuff my bird so I would have to call this "dressing". I've made so many versions of dressing over the years, w/ sausage, cornbread, apples, craisins, fresh herbs....Not only is this version the easiest but, in my opinion, the best. A classic!

This is very similar to the recipe I use all the time.  I usually double or triple it because DH loves stuffing.  Also I usually add green pepper to give it more flavor.  My mother used to make this recipe but added an egg to it so it could be sliced after it was cooked.  I never felt that was necessary so didn't do it.

this was my first attempt at baking stuffing, and have never had stuffing come out good from inside the bird, so i was a little nerves going into this, but i followed the recipie and it came out perfect.  I didnt get a chance to let my bread cubes dry so i baked them in the oven till crunchy.  other than that i followed the recipie as writen.  made it the day before thanksgiving and just threw it into the oven for about 20 min, heated up good. when adding the liquid some of the peices soaked up alot of  liquid wich kind of scared me but in the end it turned out with a nice balace of moisture .

Suffing from scratch has never been my friend, but I made this recipe for Thanksgiving for my very large & opinionated family. It turned out GREAT! Everyone said how much they loved it. It was also very easy to do and easy to make for a large crowd.

This was exactly what I was looking for! Came out of the turkey moist but not mushy even though I had limited time to dry out the bread. I doubled the recipe (27 lb. turkey!) and added a little bit of celery seed to bring out more of that celery flavor.

I made this to take to my Dad's house for Thanksgiving, and unwisely gave my husband a "test sample". He kept asking for more and more, saying we should just eat it ourselves and bring a container of Stove Top to dinner. He even asked if I would start making it on a regular basis, not just on holidays. He's kind of picky, so whenever he likes something it deserves a rave review. The only changes I made were to add a bit more poultry seasoning, some fresh garlic along with the veggies, and I topped the whole thing off with some Italian seasoned bread crumbs before baking. Delish, thanks! =)

tasted just like my mom's! I doubled the recipe, which overstuffed our 18lb turkey & left a little to be cooked on the side. I also added some thyme, marjoram, & additional sage.

This is an excellent old-fashioned stuffing recipe. If possible, stuff the turkey and bake any leftover in a casserole dish. When done, mix the two together. The only change I made was to add fresh parsley.

I've used this recipe many times over the years for our festive turkey dinners.  It's so easy my husband is even able to make it successfully!  Everyone raves about it.  I always add a little extra poultry seasoning and salt.  So yummy and moist!  It even keeps well if you choose to make it the evening before your big dinner - bake in the over the day of.

Whipped 2 eggs in cool broth. Added 2 diced chicken breasts boiled in broth. I made a slightly larger batch and used 49oz can of broth. Used french bread... more firm and better texture. Everyone loved it. Poultry seasoning makes the dish.

i don't really like stuffing, but i made it for thankgiving for my family, and i actually really, really liked this one.  i chopped the onions and the celery really fine, and my sister didn't even notice they were there (she's a picky eater).  because i baked it in a glass baking dish, if i make it again, i'll probably add a little more chicken broth because it was a little dry (maybe because it wasn't stuffed in a turkey).  but other than that, i thought it was awesome!

Made 2x the recipe and thought it was great, esp with gravy on it. I let the bread "dry" out for 2 days and highly recommend it, keeps it from getting soggy. A good standard stuffing for sure!

I will skip on buying the boxed stuffing and make it fresh.  The stuffing in the turkey came out with much more flavor than the one I baked on the side(too soggy the bread but I think I got carried away with adding too much liquids) so we ended up mixing both of them and it was GOOD.

Out of all the delicious varieties of food at Thanksgiving...turkey, pies, fruit, desserts, etc.. guess what was voted the favorite item at Thanksgiving in my family??? This stuffing was that good. It was moist without being soggy, and a great flavor. The only modifications I made were I used less onions, and added cream of celery soup instead of chicken broth...that made it less soggy and gave it an even more full celery flavor. I also let the bread dry out for several hours. I used it as a dressing instead of stuffing. Great recipe!!

This recipe is similar to what I use to stuff the turkey, but this was the first time I'd ever made it in a separate pan.  It was delicious!!  It's so much easier to prepare the stuffing separately that I may never stuff a turkey again!  I used leftover French bread, which is what I had on hand, and dried the cubes in the oven first, but otherwise followed the recipe.  This recipe will become a permanent addition to our holiday meals.

The stuffing smelled awesome, and was easily a five star recipe until Step 4.  I put in the oven at 350 degrees.  It started burning at twenty-eight minutes, and my oven usually runs cold.  Burnt stuffing is a pretty major recipe problem, which is why I am only giving this recipe 3 stars.  It could still be great stuffing, if you replaced Step 4 with the following: (1) make it Stevetop style--serve it warm after Step 3; or (2) turn the oven to 325 degrees and bake twenty to twenty five minutes.

This recipe was really good. I only made a couple changes. I used half wheat and half white french bread. I cut into small cubes and toasted on low in the oven for a couple hours to toast. I also added one granny smith apple, fresh sage, rosemary, thyme, and parsley. The taste was great but it didn't stick together that well. Next time I will try adding an egg or two. I made the mistake of adding the bread in an hour before I baked  to get it ready. The bread got soggy but that was my own fault, next time I won't mix in the bread until right before it goes in the oven.

We made this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving.  We didn't have poultry seasoning so we used a mix of dried oregano, basil and sage.  We also used sour dough and rye breads.  It was great.  Will definitely make again.

I added additional sage, rosemary and thyme (just a few shakes of each).  I also added 2 eggs and extra chicken broth.  The stuffing came out VERY moist.  Next time, I will only add 1 egg and stick with the broth amount listed in the recipe.  Wonderful flavor; good texture.

"I believe it's even better than my mom's!"  One of the best compliments a man can give his wife!  (Although he swears he'll never admit he said it if I tell on him!)  My first time ever making stuffing, and it will definitely not be my last!  This recipe was so easy, and so delicious...not just for Thanksgiving anymore!!

I Doubled this recipe, I used french bread, taosted it on my over & made it the day before just to save time> Before I put it in the oven I added a little broth from the turkey that was cooking in the oven (took the baster & sucked up some juice from the turkey & squirted it on the stuffing), cooked covered for 30 minutes & uncovered for 12. Simple & Delicious!

This is a great basic recipe ! Add Mushrooms and Apples for an authentic "Old World" variation !! Let your imagination wander to walnuts etc for flavor variations to suit any occasion . I've stuffed quail , turkey and had it on the side baked as a great side dish . Also ,,, I used Rye bread for extra flavor and texture

I have always made my stuffing like this.
It's really good when you fry up some Bob Evans sausage and add it to it.
I hope yoy'll try it, I know it will become a tradition!

1st time making stuffing/dressing. I threw my bread in the oven fo 5 min with my turkey to just speed up the drying out part but i might have made a mistake because i needed more chicken broth to make it moist- almost another whole cup. Tasted great!

My husband said this is better than his grandmother's recipe, and that is quite a compliment!! I will never go back to boxed stuffing. I neverr realized how easy home made stuffing was.  Definately a keeper!!

Family loved it.  Added sauted mushrooms.  Added more poultry seasoning.  First time I used chicken stock to moisten instead of eggs - good substitution.

The perfect traditional stuffing.  Everyone raves about it, and I have been asked for the recipe more than once.  It is easy to make, and is pretty good as is, although I add a bit more bread than the recipe calls for.

I had never made stuffing from scratch before so I gave this recipie a shot this past Christmas. The flavor was amazing!!! I only gave this four stars because it was very soggy in the crockpot so I ended up baking it in the oven for the last hour and it really helped!

This is a foolproof recipe.  Very simple and easy to make with excellent results every time.  For reheating, I add a bit of chicken broth over the top, put foil over and heat in oven for a few minutes.  Delicious and moist.

This was fantastic! The only thing was that I did leave the bread out overnight to get it a little more stale, which I'm glad I did. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. I got many compliments. Wonderful!

I made some adjustments so only started with 4 stars but it ends up great. I used whole wheat bread dried for a day. I added a little bit of chopped carrots and bell pepper to the celery mix.  After cooking I added 2 beaten eggs and some sunflower seeds.  I used 2 Tbspn of spices. For chicken broth I used a boullion cube and 8 oz water. Add slowly, stir and use it all. I baked for 30 min. in a pan covered with foil.

I had never been able to find a recipe for stuffing that I liked...until this one.  I made a loaf of bread, dried it out, and used all of the loaf. This was so perfect with Perfect Turkey esp.,
If you are not inclined to make your own bread, just buy a good quality bread, and let it dry out.  The spices, and the celery and onion amounts were just right. Got rave reviews on this from everyone.
When you add liquid the morning of, you need to add alot. If it doesn't seem right to you, picture to yourself, crunching down on a dried cube of bread, if you don't like what you imagine, add more liquid.  It'w worth it.

This is a great traditional recipe.  I went in search of something new, something that was different than my mom made, but it turns out that hers is the best and it is basically the same recipe as this one.  The only difference that I made was to the stuffing that didn't fit in the turkey I added dried cranberries.

I've been making this recipe for 3 years now and even my husband will tell you this is the best stuffing around.  I usually double this recipe and use one loaf of white bread and one loaf of wheat bread to give it a slight difference in appearance and flavor from your traditional stuffings.

Almost like Grandmas but she dried the bread and then dipped in water and squeezed till sticky, Added 2 eggs also. More work but so good. Also in place of pork sausage she fried hamburger, celery, onion, with the giblets she ground up in her grinder with sage seasoning and poultry seasoning.

I make this *every* year, for thanksgiving & christmas!  The only change for me is, I use toasted/buttered french bread, also I always add an extra bag of the premium, cubed stuffing mix (not stovetop!), & low sodium/garlic chicken stock.  Everyone loves this.

This was just like the recipe my grandma uses!  I used turkey broth from the gizzards/neck instead of chicken broth, and added a little sage, and toasted the bread.  It was WONDERFUL!  My first Thanksgiving dinner in my first apartment and the stuffing was PERFECT!

My boyfriend's favorite side is the stuffing, so I was a little nervous making it from scratch, but he loved it and so did everyone else.  I toasted the bread with a sprinkle of garlic powder and Mrs. Dash.

This is basically the stuffing I grew up on.  I never understood why folks put sausage or oysters or what-have-you into stuffing.  (Or why they called it dressing!)  My only addition is raisins.  This is my Thanksgiving stuffing, but we don't stuff the bird anymore - too many food-born illness risks.  So we make it on the side and nothing tastes better than this stuffing mixed with candied yams and mashed potatoes the day after Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the recipe - it's my forever-stuffing!

This stuffing generated the most 'wow' comments of all the foods we offered our guests this Thanksgiving.  We added a couple of things that made it even better -- our bread cubes we drizzled with olive oil, mixed with salt,pepper, poultry seasoning, thyme, and parsley, then toasted them till dry.  Second, we added one chopped Grany Smith apple, 1/4 cup golden raisins, and 1/3 cup toasted chopped walnuts before stuffing the bird. All the different flavors and textures make for a great bite of stuffing!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was the best dish on the table.  I cut up all the extra bread I had lying around the house and air dried it overnight.  I ended up with 22 cups of bread, so I doubled the recipe for the other ingredients.  I also added one diced Granny Smith apple and some fresh parsley.  I prepared it in the morning and chilled it in the fridge until the turkey was done.  Absolutely delicious!

I thought this was okay, as well as my other guests. My father said he likes old fashioned stuffing, which I thought this was, but he said it tasted nothing like old fashioned stuffing to him. Too much poultry seasoning for us as we don't like the sage taste very much, and we also had to add a bit more broth as other readers suggested. Used french bread too.

I used french bread per another review and I thought it was rather easy to make and I received good feedback.  I myself prefer cornbread stuffing but it was a good, easy way to go.

This is a very good, basic recipe that is easy to personalize according to your taste. I used bakery "farmstyle" white bread and added a touch more poultry seasoning and broth than is called for. My family enjoyed the simplicity.

Yes, this is just perfect.  I made this for our (Canadian) Thanksgiving dinner, and my brother couldn't get enough - he said it was the first time he actually ENJOYED stuffing.  This recipe is a holiday staple.  Thanks!

I never made my own dressing until now.
This dressing was fun and easy to make and was delicious.  No more stuffing in a box for me.

I love this stuffing! Tastes just like I remember from growing up. I began with the recipe, but have adjusted it and do it by memory and bascially taste. I have always used store bought bread cubes, but couldn't find any this time around. I will now be trying it tomorrow with white bread, after reading reviews, I wish I had french, but we'll see how it turns out.

For the large number of 5 star ratings on this recipe, I was disappointed with the result.  It was good, sure, but not spectacular like I expected.  I will make again if ever I do Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner, solely on the fact that the recipe is very easy to prepare.

Can't get any better than this. To me, this is the ultimate comfort food. My husband's family (who are Hawaiian and usually eats rice)ate this up and told me to make more next time! A classic recipe that can't go wrong.

Very good!  I grew up with Mrs. Cubbisons stuffing and this was the first recipe I tried from scratch.  My husband liked it and he is not a big stuffing fan.  I wont be needing the store bought stuff anymore.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving, instead of the usual handed down family recipe.  My son,37 years old, who does not enjoy stuffing, ate more stuffing than he did anything else and took leftovers home. I did add some chopped garlic to it.  I think we have a new family recipe to be handed down.  Thanks Carlota for sharing.

I used 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of celery salt in place of the celery because my husband doesnt like celery in dressing. I also added a little more chicken broth and poultry seasoning. Put ingredients together early Thanksgiving morning then put in fridge till it was time to bake. Delicious, will make again.

great basic approach to a stuffing recipe.  I made this two years ago..i added mushrooms. It was great.

You can easily work with this recipe and add/change ingredients...a great start.

I've been using this recipe for years!  I have never used chicken broth in mine, though.  I guess I like it as buttery as possible.  I always put some in the turkey and the rest in a casserole and bake it separately for those who don't like moister stuffing.  It's truly the best comfort food!

I love this stuffing!  I made it to go along side some chicken breasts I had made for dinner tonight and it was very. very good.  The best part about this recipe is that it is one of the very few stuffing recipes out there that doesn't require using eggs, and it works very well with chicken.  Yummy!

This recipe was awesome!!!  Every year my sisters-in-law and I cook for our families and the stuffing is always a cause for concern:)  This year we FINALLY managed to find a delicious recipe that our families raved about!!!  It's already in the family cookbook and we look forward to using it again.  Thanks Carlota for solving the stuffing dilema!
-The ever grateful Jardine sisters!

Easy & Tasty.  I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used the spices I had on hand - which enabled me to add more according to my tastes!  Very Good!  Thanks!

I'm revising my previous rating of a rather wet 4 stars to a perfect 5. This recipe has a fabulous flavor, maybe even better than my mom's, and I solved the wetness problem by learning to mix with my hands and not just a wooden spoon! It really does help. Even though the sensation of buttery fingers is still not one I'll treasure, this recipe IS one I'll treasure :)

This is just like my mom makes each year for Thanksgiving - although she doesn't really have a "recipe."  This has always been my favorite dish at Thanksgiving and now I can make it any time.  So inexepensive too!  No more need for Stove-Top Stuffing.

This is a wonderful basic recipe to start out with.  I had never made stuffing that didn't come out of a box and this was very easy.  I did make a few changes the second time I made this though.  I used a herb garlic loaf of bread that I made in the bread machine and I added more chicken broth because I thought that it was a little dry.  Excellent starting recipe for us beginners.  Thanks!

I ended up making three batches of this for different occasions over the thanksgiving week and it's great, a good basic recipe that you can add to or leave as is. i added sausage to it once and made it another time with a bag of stuffing mix instead of taosting my own bread it was still fine, but best with the toasted bread cubes. I will be making this again for Christmas!!

This was my very first stuffing from scratch and it came out great!  I loved that it was a simple, normal stuffing recipe, and so did everyone else!

This was much closer to the bread stuffing that my grandmother made, but I thought the poultry seasoning really overpowered it. Maybe I will cut down a bit next time. Otherwise, it is the closest thing to what my grandmother made.

This was very good.  I made some adjustments to suit my taste a little better.  I used half white bread and half cornbread, only 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning because I added other spices such as garlic powder, sage, thyme, savory, paprika and onion powder.  I just didn't like the idea of straight poultry seasoning.  Came out very good but I will increase the savory seasoning next time to 1 teaspoon instead of the 1/2 teaspoon that I used.  Thank you for the basic recipe because I so did not want store bought bread cubes this year, I just wanted EVERYTHING to be made from scratch and had never made stuffing from scratch before.  If I hadn't found this recipe, even though I did make personal changes, I probably would have ended up with store bought stuffing.  Thanks again!

Oh my gosh! I can't believe how good this was! I was making turkey for the first time, for my boyfriend's family. I was terrified! They loved the stuffing! Even his brother who hates stuffing ate some! I stuffed the turkey with it, and had some left over. It was a little too moist for my liking, but I baked the leftovers which was a bit crunchy. I mixed both together, and thank God! It came out perfect! Thanks Carlotta!

Everyone loved this dish at thanksgiving dinner. It's extremely simple and very tasty which helps when you've got homemade cornbread, pumpkin pie (from fresh pumpkins!), and the turkey to cook.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was fabulous -- just like my Mother used to make except I did it in a casserole and not in the turkey.  It was so moist.  Thanks.  Jan H.

I used leftover sourdough bread, didn‚Äôt dry it out beforehand because I wanted a more moist stuffing.  I baked it in a casserole dish instead of inside the turkey.  I Also added extra savoury  because I love more flavour.

I halved the bread and butter in this recipe, but the bread seemed dry after I mixed it in, so I added 1/4 of the butter back in, plus 1/4 extra broth. I wish I hadn't upped the butter, as this turned out just a bit too buttery, and it's easier, healthier, and 
more effective to moisten them with broth (half chicken juices, half chicken bone broth) instead.

This one is great , my wife loves it. Very easy to make. I make mine a little mushier than the picture shown by adding the broth until I get the consistency I want.  Just go easy on the broth so you don't get it too mushy.

A simple old fashioned stuffing recipe-certainly easy.  I tripled the recipe and added some cornbread.  Due to dietary restrictions I used margarine (butter would be great!) and vegetable broth.  I used 4 cups of vegetable broth for a tripled recipe so a bit more than called for.  The proportions seemed fine for the moisture.  Preliminary taste tests (before the baking) are very good.  I think I would increase the seasoning a bit next time but that is my personal taste.  This recipe lends to adding whatever you'd like (cranberries, apples, nuts, etc) but the basic recipe is good, too!

Didn't grow up on stuffing/ dressing.  Was hesitant to make  but my hubby had a craving;  found this very  well liked recipe,  followed video instructions and it was a hit.  Loving the varieties people have posted,  curious to try those!

Simple, classic stuffing like my dad used to make. Great as is, or adjust to personal preference. My dad was always the turkey and stuffing maker, but he passed several years ago. I have made this a few times now. It is as close as possible to his. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This is a great base to use as a point of departure.  There is nothing exotic or out of the ordinary, so this is a recipe  to use as a base for more interesting things.  Not a great recipe, but respect for what it is, a foundation.

I made this to mimic the Thanksgiving stuffing that my mother and grandmother made. It is good basic stuffing. I like to add (a lot of) garlic and an egg to hold it together well. It takes a bit of salt for this and I also add the chopped giblets because that‚Äôs what I prefer.

Have used this many times. Tastes just like my mom's. Have used different kinds of bread, stale bread and the dry stuff you buy bagged or boxed. You just have to adjust the amount of liquid to make it moist not soggy. Check for seasoning by frying up a spoonful and taste it. The first year I did Thanksgiving for my soon-to-be-husband & his grown children he told me not to make much stuffing because his family didn't care for it.  All I can say is not one spoonful was left of a double batch!

It was way too salty.  Would recommend cutting back on garlic salt and adding some poultry seasoning plus onion.   Will try again later with some modifications and see if I want to keep receipe.

This is the recipe for stuffing that my grandmother handed down to me. She never gave me exact portions so I turned to the internet for a little more exact guidance. I will always love this stuffing.

Flavor is good. Don't dump in all the stock, just pour in slowly and mix as you go till it's a bit sticky. I stuffed a handful into the neck of the turkey (not cavity, as per Jamie Oliver), the rest in a covered casserole dish (remove cover 5-10 mins before done).

Could eat the whole tray by myself. I am so happy with how this turned out. I made it on a whim with no planning, fortunately I had everything but poultry seasoning so I substituted for garlic & onion powders. I also added carrot and this was perfect!!!

It was very good.  Next time I would cut some of the butter and add a bit more celery and onion.  I used a combination of white bread and oatmeal bread, the white bread could have been a bit drier.  I didn't think I would like it but I did,  very much.

This was a good recipe for making an extra side of stuffing. I happened to use whole wheat bread (I hadn't left it out to air dry so I put the slices in my toaster set on minimum heat to dry it, but not toast it). I followed the recipe with the exception of the seasoning. As I did not have "poultry seasoning" I used 1/2 tsp. each of dried sage, thyme and marjoram. It was lovely, despite my mistake of covering it with tin foil, which made it quite moist, (as though it was steamed). I will make this again, and will make it a point not to cover it!

This worked out really well. It has the flavours of my Mom's stuffing without putting it in the bird. Cooked more even that way for me. And I added apple as that is part of my family recipe. Will make double next year.

This was delicious! I used Italian bakery bread and let it dry out overnight. I doubled the broth and I also added chopped and braised turkey giblets. It was the best stuffing we have ever tasted.

This is the best bread and celery dressing recipe ever. It rivals my aunt's recipe that I only know by approximate measurements. I use this one now.  Not for people on a low carb eating plan, but It's delicious!

I made as is, but also added chopped apple, parsley, and pecans.  I don't like stuffing, but my family said it was delicious!
I used stale french bread instead of white bread.

I followed this recipe (tore bread into bite sized pieces, placed on a baking sheet, and covered them overnight before using the next morning). I cooked mine in a dutch oven and it fooled my son into thinking I had stuffed the bird! Everyone loved it, especially me. I will be making this again!!

This is very similar to the recipe my mom always used. It isn't fancy but tastes great and is easy to prepare.

This needs the addition of mashed potatoes in the water they were cooked in, adding a couple of chicken cubes for flavor.  This is the way my Mom made this dressing, and her Mom before her.  It has been handed down for several years, and seasoned differently with each family  I use sage and poultry seasoning.....At any rate, this is a good dressing, and yes it is moist, but I wouldn't call it soggy.

Awesome stuffing! Everyone loved it and wished there was more! We added a bit of thyme for extra flavor, but followed everything else to a T. This will be a regular at Thanksgivings to come!

I doubled the recipe since we were feeding 10-12 people, time consuming to chop everything up, but well worth it.  Everyone ate it and we had leftovers which were enjoyed the next day. 
 Followed other reviews and added broth slowly at the end to keep from being too dry or too moist. Great, traditional, home made tasting stuffing just like mom always made.  Will definitely make this again!

A bit like sausage gravy, this is one of those recipes that highlights the virtues of simplicity.  I've made every kind of dressing out there and this is what we always come back to. The amount of liquid needed is going to depend on the type of bread you use and how dry it is. 

I prefer to make it the night before and let it sit. When I cook it, I keep it covered for 20 minutes to help distribute the moisture and then uncover to brown up the top a bit. The butter mixture is *just* enough. So much so that it may not be enough for you. I'd recommend upping it  by half.

This recipe is so reminiscent of my mother's dressing when I was a child. She always promised to write it down and never did, so I am very glad to have this  Because I live in a very humid country with lots of bugs, leaving bread out to air dry wasn't possible, so I put the slices in the oven on a low heat to dry them out. I used about 1.5 x the poultry seasoning and next time will use 2 x because I like it a bit more flavorful. I also used a half and half ratio of white and wheat bread. I needed to finish off the celery because it was going bad so it was probably 6 or 7 stalks of celery. I made this in a greased casserole dish.

I have made a version of this many times but it was stuffed. This was my first time baking a stuffing. This was just ok. I added 4 to 5 times the amount of poultry. I like my stuffing to look full of this seasoning and to taste like it too. It's a basic good starter to tweak as you please.

My husband loved it so much he said to never make stove top again. It was my first time making thanksgiving dinner at all, and without the guidance of my mother in law due to her passing in April. Also we live 1,000 miles away. I chose this recipe due to the ingredients reminded me of what I remember as a child helping my family cook. It was spot on and amazing. I let the bread air dry for 3 days and rotated a few times a day to ensure it was dry. He spices weren't overwhelming and stuffing was moist and not mush. I would absolutely recommend this. It was pretty easy too.

My go to stuffing/dressing.  I am not the best cook, but this recipe makes be look good.  I don't do much changing, maybe add/subtract  butter and/or chicken broth depending how wet /dry I want my stuffing/dressing.  Never going back to stovetop.  (I don't stuff my turkey, just eat it as a side)

This stuffing was delicious! I love cooking from scratch so I used my own bread, not store bought, but that was the only change from the recipe. My family really loved this stuffing and I am making it for Thanksgiving again.

I've been making this stuffing for several years for Thanksgiving. On a whim in the middle of summer decided to make it today.. it's so good we don't want to wait all year for stuffing! My whole family loves this recipe. It's the only stuffing I've ever made so I don't have anything to compare it to. But I love how easy it is to make and how tasty it is. IMHO it's perfect!

Made it for my large roast chicken tonight,  used 7 Sliced of whole grain bread from a medium sized loaf,  cut them into cubes, toasted them at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for a half an hour,  and added thyme,  basil, Tarragon,  pepper,  onion and garlic granules, and a bit of salt to the recipe instead of poultry seasoning!   IT WAS OUTSTANDING!

First of all I used butter. I rolled the cubed bread in the butter and cooked it at 350, turned them every few minutes until they were crispy.  Added everything but went light on the liquid ingredients. Stuffed the Chicken and everyone fought over the dressing, it was very flavorful!

Good and basic stuffing. I cook for my church group and like good old fashioned food like my Grandmother made. We are a " Street Church " in Vancouver's lower East Side and have very limited funding.

This was delicious.  The final product was a little dry...it didn't stick together at all...but very tasty. I'd say if you like your stuffing to be cohesive then add more liquid or an egg

Like many other viewers this was very close to a family recipe. I made the changes to make it a bit closer:  used one loaf  dried out white bread plus 1/2 bag pepperidge farm stuffing mix (roughly 6oz flavor of choice), added 1 egg to the bread mixture, used homemade chicken stock. I did saute the celery and onions first. I cooked it by preparing a roasting chicken and placing it in a large baking dish on "rack" of carrots, celery and onion. Around (not in) the bird I placed the stuffing  mixture (any extra can be baked separately in a smaller dish). Cooked acc to roasting chicken guide (based on size) with a bit extra time checking it every now and then for moisture level. The stuffing was amazing!!! So was the chicken ;)

I've never liked using regular white loaves for stuffing or bread puddings, but I had leftover challah to use which was also very rich and soft. I cut it into cubes and left them to air dry over night, but I wasn't satisfied they would hold so I baked the bread cubes at 250 for 20 minutes. Half butter and half margarine because I'm stingy with my butter, and followed the recipe exactly from there. I would suggest spooning the broth in slowly while you stir, because mine was very close to being too wet when I added the full cup of broth. Baked at 350 for 35 mins and it wasn't soggy but perfect. Wonderful basic stuffing/dressing recipe!

This was just like my Grandmothers. Followed recipe exactly. Except made 3 batches for large Thanksgiving group. Baked in two large casserole dishes. Turned out perfect. Will use the recipe from now on. Don't be afraid of the butter it came out delicious, light and moist. Not greasy.

I love this stuffing, and I've been making it for the past 4 years for Thanksgiving. I'm eating leftover stuffing as I'm writing this review! It always turns out delicious. I toast the bread in the oven first, until it just starts to turn a tiny bit golden, then take it out and cube it, and let it air dry for another hour or so. The amount of chicken broth you use is totally up to you and your tastes; I usually tend to add a little bit more, although the loaves of bread that I buy are quite large too.

Forgot to get Stovetop stuffing for our Thanksgiving feast, found this recipe, and will NEVER go back! Rave reviews from all family members! Added some green pepper to the sauteed veggies, used some multigrain bread with the white bread (dried in oven before cubing) and baked it in a casserole at 325 degrees with the ham. Crispy edges were delicious, middle was moist, flavor exceptional. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is similar to the stuffing my grandma used to make, which our family looked forward to every year.  For my crowd of 30 I tripled the recipe, except for the butter, using only a cup and didn't measure the chicken broth, just made it the consistency I remember Grandma's being.   Also boiled the turkey giblets and chopped them very fine to include in the stuffing.  Yum, even those that don't love stuffing thought this was great.

Quick and easy!  This fit the bill with minimal effort and ingredients.  I'd recommend adding the broth 2-3 tablespoons at a time and mixing each time to make sure none of the bread gets too soggy.  Will certainly make again!

This is a very simple recipe that is full of flavor. I added a little pinch more of sage and a handful of fresh cranberries. I cooked the celery, onion, butter and Bell's Seasoning for a bit. When the celery started to soften I tossed the cranberries in. Use caution because the fresh cranberries when they pop can cause a burn if your pan is too shallow. I actually used a stock pot and it worked great. If you use a bigger pot it is a lot easier to mix in the bread cubes but you have to watch the butter, celery in the beginning and stir a little more frequently. The first time I made this I used it to stuff chicken breasts. Delicious.

It's the middle of summer, but sometimes you just crave some fall-tasting comfort food, and this fit the bill! I don't like dry stuffing, so I gradually added the chicken broth (more like 1 3/4 cups) until it reached the moistness that I desired. I also considered that baking could dry it out. My long, French loaf produced a ton of bread cubes, so maybe that's why I had to add more broth, too. I also added some chopped mushrooms to the onions and celery while they were sauteeing. I transferred it to a sprayed 13x9 pan but would consider foil-ling the pan for easy clean-up the next time. I baked it, foil-covered, for 25 min; then removed the foil and baked for another 15 min. This is a nice, basic recipe that you add other things such as crumbled sausage, apples or cranberries. Thanks for the excellent recipe, Carlota! Bardzo dobzie (very good in Polish).

For both Thanksgiving and Christmas, I am required to make my mother-in-laws recipe of sausage stuffing. However, my father prefers stuffing/dressing without meat. I have tried quite a few recipes and all have been average. I found this recipe, decided to try it because of all the good reviews.  Only change was, our bakery sells French bread cut into cubes, and I used that instead of white bread. It was a huge hit. I will use this recipe from now on.

This was a super easy recipe. I have never made homemade stuffing before. I am amazed at how delicious and simple this was. I used fresh sage and thyme and adjusted the flavor with a sprinkle of poultry seasoning. I also used buttermilk bread and dried it out in the oven on the lowest setting. One review said to add the broth a little at a time till you achieve desired moistness. This proved to be an excellent suggestion.

Delicious and very simple.  I toasted the bread in the oven to dry it out.  I made turkey broth from the neck and gizzards, and used that along with some drippings from the roasting pan to flavor it.  Yum!

I followed the recipe closely and baked this in the oven. The only difference is that I dried the bread for a day. Next time I will probably use a little more poultry seasoning and 1/4 to 1/2 cup more broth.

We serve this every year. Vary using potato bread some years, adding stale corn bread in addition to white other times. Thyme is a great addition, as are the beaten eggs.

This is my go-to for Thanksgiving, and the closest thing I can find to what I grew up on. The key ingredient I add is cornbread, which gives the stuffing a little added sweetness. I just make a box of jiffy mix and use half the pan (once cooled). I cut back a little on the dry bread accordingly. I sub sage for poultry seasoning usually, but either works.

Just love this recipe -- easy enough to make for weekly meals -- occasionally I will add 1 lb ground chuck and just have a full lunch for work.  For the cubed bread, I use Brownberry Premium Stuffing (Herb Seasoned).  Very versatile -- or just darned good as written -- thank you!!!!

This turned out well.  I added mushrooms to the mix, and had to add a little more broth.  I would make it again.

This recipe is excellent! Instead of poultry seasoning I used savory, sage and black pepper. Savory is my favorite!

One word - SOURDOUGH! I used sourdough bread and this stuffing was AMAZING!! Yum! I also used unsalted butter and added the salt by hand. I grew up on nasty Stovetop stuffing, so I've never liked stuffing. Once I made this, I am a full fledged believer!! It's now my favorite part of Thanksgiving!

I followed recipe nearly exactly.  I was so glad I didnt have to use eggs as my son is severely allergic!  I wanted a little more color so instead of using 4 stalks celery, I used 3 and then I used about a half of a red pepper.  Nobody could believe I made it !  (I couldnt either !)  I WILL NEVER buy boxed stuffing again.  This is sooooo easy and quick to make.  You could add whatever spices you like.  I added just a little bit of thyme & sage.  Oh and I had leftover whole wheat bread and spelt bread which I make in my bread machine so I used a mix of it.  It didnt get soggy, which I was worried it would especially reading some reviews !  Awsome and perfect !  THANKS SO MUCH.

Delicious and easy. Should have Mae more for my Thanksgiving dinner. It was the first thing gone. I did double the liquid using chicken Better Than Bouillon, instead of broth.

This was so tasty!  We needed a vegetarian option for my brother at Thanksgiving and this worked out great!  We subbed the chicken broth for vegetable broth and cut up big chunks of 'TX toast.'  I put it in a casserole dish and baked in the oven rather than the turkey.  Tasted even better as leftovers!

Exactly what I was looking for! It was the perfect stuffing for our Thanksgiving dinner. The only complaint was that my guests ate so much of it, I don't have as much leftover ;-)

This got the BEST reviews on Thanksgiving by my company! My father in law (who won't touch stuffing) went back for seconds after I urged him to just "try" this dish!!! This recipe is a keeper and will forever be a staple at my table from now on!!!!  I did add 2 granny smith apples to the onion and celery mix and fried up jimmy Dean's breakfast sausage and added that as well. I could not ask for a better recipe! Many many thanks for this one Carlota!!!

Don't need to try it.  My daddy made this every Thanksgiving with the addition of sage and the beaten eggs.  And a little more poultry seasoning, I think.  The best was that what didn't fit in the turkey - triple the recipe! - got made into patties, each patty topped with a pecan, and baked in the oven.  Turkey and dressing and green bean casserole and sweet potato pie and even chocolate pie ended up as leftovers, but never the patties!

simply delicious!!  I didn't add as much broth as I stuffed the turkey with some and then baked the rest on the side.  It was just like my mom used to make and my first attempt at home made stuffing!  A keeper for sure!

I made this for Thanksgiving, & it was absolutely delicious! I probably added a bit more onion due to personal preference, but there were NO leftovers! (Much to my dismay!) I will double it next time. Oh, also used a 1 pound loaf of Wonder buttermilk bread, left out on a cookie sheet overnight into the next day. I kept turning the slices over to ensure even dryness. That's one step I would NOT change :) Enjoy!

This was the first attempt at making stuffing and it got rave reviews by all.  I actually made two versions one where I added a pound of sausage and one without.  The only thing I changed after reading some reviews was I used 1 tablespoon of poultry seasoning instead of 2.  I was told I am now in charge of stuffing every year.

I lost my mom's recipe, so I tried this one out.  It was great!  I made a broth from the giblets/neck and added a few tablespoons of the turkey stock as it cooked and used that instead of the canned broth.  I also added 1 egg & the meat from the neck & some giblets - because I know my mom added these to her recipe.

Make one pan of cornbread with sage in it and one more cup of broth.  Add it to this recipe and you will have Texas Dressing.

I've been making this stuffing for years, and I always get the thumbs down when I even dare to mention trying another stuffing recipe.  I also put a pound of mushrooms in this stuffing.  Soooo good!!

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and we loved this recipe. Used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and added some mushrooms in with the onion and celery as they were sauteing. Wonderful! I will be using this recipe every year!

This is a GREAT recipe for stuffing!  The only thing I added was a little bit of sage.  Because I cannot eat gluten, I used 1.5 loaves of the Udi white sandwich bread and it worked great!  (I removed the crust and toasted cubes in the oven to ensure they were dry enough.)  This was the star of our Thanksgiving meal this year!

i make less than a full recipe (it's only my husband and i with my mother in law on occasion).. 

***one tip i do for cutting up the the bread - makes it dry faster and more even - cut it into cubes while it is frozen (doing about 3-5 slices at a time).  you get wonderful cubes, and no mess.  
my oven has a "drying" feature too - 140 degrees and keep checking it.. 
i also mince sliced mushrooms in it..  

definitely a wonderful recipe.

Great dressing recipe. I used the prepackaged Herb bread crumbs and oregano (didn't have poultry seasoning). Going to make it for Thanksgiving. I had to try it out first, had never made stuffing before. Might add sausage (just a personal preference)

This was exactly what I was looking for!! Simple yet classic. I used almost 2 cups of chicken broth and it was moist and crisp on top. I have never been able to make a great stuffing yet but this is it! Thanks!

soooo tasty!  I halved the recipe, but only put maybe a 1/4 c. water in (no broth).  Fed 3 perfectly...we love stuffing!  I may try a little less water next time.  Mmmmmm......so good.

This stuffing was very good.  I had a turkey breast that came already roasted.  So I made this recipe put it in a 9X13 and baked it.  I also added one egg.  I found the poultry seasoning to be overwhelming, I would halve it when making it again.

I used a loaf of Panera sourdough bread which I cut into cubes, and let dry out for a day, and the flavor was amazing!  I added a little garlic and onion salt to the cubes before toasting them a bit (another reviewer's helpful suggestion). I also used sage instead of poultry seasoning. Thanks for a easy and delicious recipe!

I halved this recipe since I only had a half a loaf of bread. The taste was great but it was gummy and parts of it were kind of hard and stuck together. We still ate it and I will probably make it again but maybe I won't cook it for as long as I did and increase the liquid perhaps.

My husband is a die hard stovetop lover and declared this stuffing better!  Great way to use up stale bread.  I was in a time crunch, so I dried the bread out in the oven before adding to butter mixture.

Absolutely fabulous classic stuffing. I have made this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas for several years now and it is always a huge hit with my husband and my family. There are rarely any leftovers. I omit the celery because I don't really like celery and this is still fabulous. It is always moist and has wonderful flavor.

This looked nothing like the picture but was delicious.  Although a Southerner, my parents are Yanks, so I have NEVER had this dish before.  It was an easy, simple recipe.  I also added some grilled ground sausage to it.  Yum.

Made this stuffing with Jalape√±o bread instead of white and it gave it a wonderful Texas Kick!  This recipe is now a common one in our house, not just on holidays.

I double the recipe and use 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white bread.  This is simple to make and delicious.

This is just like the stuffing from my childhood.  I added a bit more broth (and I used veggie broth) though.  It was very simple to make and delicious.

This was my very first attempt at making home made stuffing.  I'm giving it five stars because my very picky husband loved it and asked that I make it again in the future.  Simple and easy to put together.  A definite keeper!

I made this Stuffing for my Thanksgiving dinner and it was the best stuffing I've ever had.  I used French Bread and followed the rest of directions to a tee.   The stuffing was still good for leftovers 2 days later.  Throw away that box stuffing.

I can't believe how much I loved this.  I never made homemade stuffing and was so convinced it wouldn't come out good that I bought stovetop as a back-up.  It was great.  Next year I will double the recipe and use a loaf of wheat in addition.
2nd year: I doubled it but made it in two batches.  one loaf white, one wheat.  sauteed the onion celery and a granny smith apple per batch. 1st toasted the bread in the oven at 225. last added 1/2 package of craisins per batch. put the whole bit in the deep 9x13 . overnight in fridge, took out a few hours ahead and baked 40 min.

This was my first time making stuffing. This recipe was very easy, and it tasted great! My Czech family really liked it. The night before I made it, I set out 10 pieces of white sandwich bread on a tray so they could dry out. I cut them into small cubes the next morning and left them out for a couple hours until I was ready to prepare the dish, then followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was really tasty- not too soggy and not too crunchy.

this was the first time i made homemade stuffing im a stove top kinda girl! but hubby really wanted homemade so i gave it a shot. i let my bread sit over night(i used a loaf of italian bread) and it was just perfect by the time i was ready to cube it. i added thyme and sage like other reviews said to do, and i ended up using 2 cups of broth because it wasnt moist enough with one. i think next time i will use more broth because i still had some pieces that just didnt get enough moisture. i think i would add some more spices too. but overall the dish was pretty yummy and a lot easier to make then i was thinking it would be.

This stuffing was a big hit at thanksgiving this year! I used whole wheat bread, because it was what we had. I also added some small black raisins and chopped pecans to half of the stuffing, and people really enjoyed that also.

I have a husband who is by far the pickiest eater in the world.  We had our first Thanksgiving at our house this year and he insisted on using Stove Top as the stuffing!  Well I was dead set against it and went about researching ideas for a delicious stuffing that both our guests and my husband would like.  I found this recipe with all of the positive responses and decided to try it.  While cooking the stuffing my husband complained he wasn't going to like it and even had the Stove Top out on the counter for easy emergency access!  When the stuffing was complete, I gave him a little sample before I stuffed the turkey and he loved it!!  I couldn't believe it.  I doubled the recipe because we had many guests so I stuffed the turkey and made a separate casserole.  The stuffing was a hit both ways!  Trust me, I'm not the best cook and I found this recipe easy and delicious.  It is by far my most treasured recipe and will be used at every Thanksgiving in the future.

Fantastic base recipe. I used french bread, a bit more broth, and added two beaten eggs (I like my stuffing to really stick together). I baked it the night before and then heated it up on the big day with some extra butter on top. It was great. Next time I may add some mushrooms.

Delish! I used half whole wheat bread and half cinnamon raisin bread and added 1/2 c. chopped carrots. It was very very good! A bit more cinnamony from the bread than I would have liked but I would still definitely make this again!

I tried this, and it was really good!  I used whole wheat bread instead of white and cooked it in a 250 degree oven for 30 minutes or so until it was stale.  That way  the bread wouldn't be too soggy.  I also used smart balance instead of butter, and cooked it in the oven as a dressing instead of stuffing.  If I would change anything for next time, maybe I'd use a little less butter/margarine, but overall this was a pretty hard to mess up recipe, and very tasty.

This recipe was very good, everyone really liked it. I'm giving it 5 stars because of this and it is easy to make, though it is a bit time consuming to cube all of the bread. I only used 2 celery stalks and I used the whole can of broth, plus half a can of cream of chicken soup- to give it more flavor. My texture didn't really vary, so I added a cup of boxed stuffing to make it more appealing. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I found it a little dry but I might have been a tad off with the bread measurements.  Flavor was great.  I didn't give it five stars because I did change it a little.  I add ground pork sausage (cause that's what my mom does) just for a little something extra in there and that makes it taste even better.  I would definitely use this recipe again.

My mother used to make stuffing just like this.  She knew the recipe by heart so I never could make it myself.  I did toast the bread and add extra sage.  Tastes even better the next day!!!

This was very good.  I had to add some extra salt.  Although it was good, I think I will keep looking for that "thanksgiving" traditional stuffing.

As with most everyone else the stuff was a hit!  I did add more chicken broth (1/4 cup).  The poultry season was perfect (everyone's different).  Toasted the bread - great suggestion. I add the suggested 2 apples.  Next year I'll add a few new suggestions: raisins, mushrooms & carrots.

Very good bread dressing.  I added two beaten eggs just like grandma always did.  Oh, and you must use turkey drippings for the best dressing.  The mixture has to be really wet (like a thick muffin batter).  Delicious!

Delish.  I used a bag of sage and celery flavored stuffing, instead of making my own cubes.  I also added a pound of chopped mushrooms to the celery and onion and butter.  I didn't exactly measure out the chicken broth, just kept adding, because we do like ours sticky.  I covered it with foil while baking, in an effort to help that out and still added more.  This is close to my homemade stuffing recipe, so maybe that's why I like it so much.  Nevertheless, it was a winner for us.

Awesome recipe! This was my first attempt to cooking without using boxed stuffing. I impressed my in-laws and their families with this amazing stuffing. It was the only dish that we didn't have leftovers. Thanks!

I made this for this past Thanksgiving's dinner - and did so with home-made bread (the italian herb bread recipe in the book that's packaged with a very popular bread machine). It was so yummy! 

I've been making this stuffing for years - but I have to admit, the home-made bread really put it over the top!

If you make this as a "casserole" (i.e., don't stick it in the turkey), you'll want to add extra broth or else the bread is REALLY crunchy. I only used 1/2 cup butter to save a few calories and it tasted just fine. Oh, and I followed other users' recommendations to use French bread and to toast it in the toaster oven at 200¬∞ before adding it to the veggies... I'll make this again to be sure!

Excellent! I halved the chick broth and replaced it with whole milk plus extra.  Gave it a creamy taste and brought out more flavor of the celery and onion.  Also used Bells seasoning 1 tsp.  Thanks!

This has got to be the most boring recipe I have ever made.  I don't know what everyone is talking about, "a bit more broth," I had to use nearly TRIPLE the broth to get it not be crunchy and forget the seasonings "as-is."  I had to TRIPLE the poultry seasoning and add 3 T each of sage, thyme and garlic before it was remotely decent.  Sorry, but save yourself the trouble if you like food with flavor.

This is SO easy and yummy! I used stale hot dog buns (any "bread" would work) and it turned out amazing! My family was thrilled not having to wait until Thanksgiving for turkey AND stuffing.  This one goes in our family book.

This was my first attempt at homemade stuffing, very basic recipe, and very delicious. I used a mixture of white, multi-grain, and pumpernickle breads instead of all white-gave a nice color also. I added a little bit of cranberries to the recipe at the end. Very tasty-will make again-thanks

This was great.  I added more broth than suggested, closer to 2 cups than one. (I eyeballed it).  I also used more of the spices than the recipe called for.  I baked it for 30 minutes covered and 15 uncovered.  It was perfect!

It's a very simple recipe and I had my doubts about it but the bowl was empty at the end of dinner. I was surprised.  My brother even wanted the recipe.  It was a smaller group of people than usual so I will have to double or triple it next time. I didn't stuff the turkey but baked it in a casserole dish.

I made it exactly as written except I added a whole can of chicken broth just because I didn't want to waste any after I opened it.

Definitely a good base, however, this recipe screams for more seasonings. Didn't need to even taste to come to that conclusion, but I did and then added garlic and onion powders and sage plus an egg. Again, this is a great place to start for an old fashioned non fussy type of stuffing which is what we prefer. Some sausage or even sauteed, chopped gizzards (if you like that) would go well in this stuffing. End result was delicious and I thank you Carlota for submitting.

After reading other reviews where some stated this recipe was bland, I made a few changes. I used a very heavy French bread, sliced mushrooms, and added a little crumbled rosemary, thyme leaves and white wine to the broth which I boiled for a few minutes. There was no stuffing left since everybody had second helpings.  Great flavor.

I do not have a Dutch oven and maybe that makes all the difference.  Mine was good but next time I will use less celery.  Also added more broth because I like a mushier texture. It was still not as mushy as I like it so I may just let the broth saturate the bread more before mixing in the veggies. Overall good.  Great as a spring board for new stuffing makers like myself. It seems like every family has their own secrets and will disover my own next time!!

This stuffing was delicious before I put it in the bird....but it was soggy when it came out.  Everyone else at the table liked it but I'm still gonna search for the one I like the best.

**I've made again (several times) and just bake it in a covered casserole dish for 30mins and uncovered for about 15mins at 350. The BEST dressing!

This is the only stuffing recipe I've ever liked (and I LOVE it).  I toast the bread in the oven with garlic powder and onion powder first, and I use a lot more broth than the recipe calls for.  Even though I dislike soggy stuffing, I practically double the broth because this is a very dry recipe.  I've tried this with some pretty wholesome wheat bread and it's just as good, by the way.

This was very yummy, although I got a tad bit chicken broth happy-I used the whole can and it turned out soggy, BUT it tasted so good that no one minded. Next time I'll be sure to follow the recipe exactly!

This stuffing is simple and tastes great! Sometimes, depending on the ingredients I have on hand, I will make it without the celery and other times without the broth - and with extra butter instead. It's fantastic like that also.

I thought this stuffing was just delicious!  I usually have to tweak recipes to get them just right, but not with this one.  It was wonderful, just like my Mom makes.  I added walnuts for my husband, but it was equally good without them.  Thanks so much!

This recipe is amazing!  So good.  I did toast the bread in the oven for a bit since it wasn't quite dry enough, and I added almost a whole can of chicken broth which made it a little too moist, but it was still great!  Can't mess this one up, it's a keeper!

This is a very good basic recipe.  Like every other cook, I made my own modifications.  Used bagged bread cubes, added 1 pound of sage sausage, and added extra chicken stock since the bread crumbs take more. Also added more spices to taste.  My kids and husband said it was tons better than last years (wait a minute...I think I have to hurt somebody now!).
