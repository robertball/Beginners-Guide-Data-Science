This was really dry and as the recipe did not specify what kind of beans (I used pinto) I ended up with a funky tangy taste... It wasn't an awful recipe but it wasn't great either... sorry!

I like the concept but changed it up quite a bit just based on what I had and the reviews - my husband and I loved it.  I used about 8 oz or so of shells (I cooked at 13.5 oz box but didn't need it all; probably used a little more than half just enough to be covered by the sauce). In a skillet I combined 2 cups of homemade pasta sauce (garlic, peppers, onions, tomatoes) with an extra can of diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup shredded parm, 1 cup edamame (peas would work too), a sprinkling of italian bread, crumbs, 2 tbs of lemon juice, and two cans of tuna plus salt/pepper/crushed red pepper to taste. I simmered for about 10 minutes, then combined with the shells and put into the baking dish. Covered with rest of parmasan and some more italian breadcrumbs; baked at 350 for 12 minutes until cheese was melted.

I'm sorry but I did not care for this recipe. The bread crumbs gave this dish a terrible taste.
