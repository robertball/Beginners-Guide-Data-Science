This is a really good salad recipe.  I used mayo instead of the french dressing and I added some garlic and onion powders just out of personal preference.  Nice cool summer supper.

I used a homemade low-calorie ranch dressing instead of french dressing and the garbanzo beans I used were organic. I chose to make lettuce wraps out of this salad. What I did was add some finely shredded lettuce to the salad, not as much that was called for, and I wrapped the salad in leaves of lettuce. This was tasty and quite filling. I think that this was made much better by using a homemade dressing. There's more than enough for two more lunches.

Very yummy!  I did not use cucumbers (don't like them) and added extra beans.  I used red wine vinaigrette dressing and LOVED the taste combination!  Thanks for the idea!

Much better than I expected.  I used tomatoes instead of cucumbers and 1000 island instead of French

This is good!  I used a homemade french dressing that has lemon juice in the recipe and it really brightened up the flavor.

This is a good salad! I skipped the cucumbers, as I didn't have any, but added some red onion. I actually ate it rolled up in the lettuce rather than tossed in it. Little salad burrito. Mmm.

I substituted chicken salad for tuna, mayo for french dressing, left out the cucumber (I don't like "crunchy things" in my chicken/tuna salads) and added a bit of cilantro. My husband and I liked this a lot, and he doesn't usually like chicken salad. The eggs seemed to make it creamy. Very tasty, will make again.

Very good and easy dish! I didn't have cucumbers so I used pickles and miracle whip instead of French dressing. I also topped it on spinach. Delicious.

This turned out wonderfully.  I cut up an apple and added about half of it.  Some Italian seasoning was added, too.  Instead of French dressing, I tried olive oil and red wine vinegar.  This was served on toast with lettuce.  I will make this again!

This is a great combination of different easy to find foods. I used lemon, salt, and pepper to avoid the extra fat and sugar. It came out delicious!

Fantastic loved it. Makes more without adding more tuna. Chickpeas add a pleasant flavour.

Do you licious. I play with it like all the other comments, but I feel that the most important things are the garbanzo beans, tuna, and cilantro.

Added celery and white onion, instead of lettuce, because I had them. Added salt & garlic  powder. It's quite good! You can put almost any normal veggie in it, & it would still be good. Hopefully the taste will get better in the frig tonight.
