Now your griiling! Desert on the grill is awesome and this is simply delicious. I went a step further. When plating the peaches, I used grilled pineapple slices as as base for the peach halves and fresh cilantro as garnish. The peach rests nicely in the cavity from the cored pineapple.

This dish had a very interesting  but delicious taste! I actually prepared this in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes. I turned the peaches over, cooked them for about 5 minutes more, then drizzled the sauce over the peaches added the blue cheese and broiled them until the sauce began to bubble.  I believe the flavors tasted much better after they cooled and sat for about 10 minutes.  Great Recipe!

check the sugar content against the peaches you use.  You may need to add more for tart peaches

This was excellent. Thanks to JDVMD, rather than use this as a dessert, I served it with lamb chops cooked on the grill.    I had only small peaches so for the two of us I used two whole peaches. One caveat - the recipe makes way too much glaze.  I hate to waste Balsamic vinegar - next time I'll make half the amount of glaze. My husband and I really enjoyed the flavor.   As another reviewer did, I baked the peaches further after sprinkling on the bleu cheese.  Kind of melds the flavors. I will definitely make this again for ourselves and for company.  Will even try it with fresh pears as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was delicious and easy to make!  I loved the blue cheese my wife did not, in the case of a non blue cheese fan I may substitute cream cheese.

I love this recipe.  I used port instead of the basalmic, because I didn't want to use up that much basalmic.  It was tasty!  They MUST be eaten right off the grill though.  Went to munch on one later that night and it was YUCKY!

Excellent! Made this tonight with some grilled filet mignon and a salad with blue cheese. Incredible flavors. I cannot wait to make this again. It was very quick to prepare and virtually no prep work. I could see trying to put these grilled peaches on top of a salad also. Went superb with a Sonoma cabernet (Gundlach-Bus????). Can't remember how to spell the name.

This dessert is super rich. I don't think there's any way one person can finish a whole half a peach - it's just soo rich. It does taste good, but I only got through two bites.

Very interesting blend of favors. I liked this, but my boyfriend seemed a little iffy about it. All we could tell his roommate was that it was good....but odd. Overall good taste, but not something I'd make very often, if even again.

This recipe was fantastic! I had these at a local restaurant and decided to make them at home and they were just as good! The only thing I changed was the cheese... I used goat cheese instead because that's what the restaurant does and served it over a bed of spring greens. I'm sure the blue cheese would be good as well. Maybe I'll do that next time. Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

This was a hit at an Italian-themed grill supper. I served it with both domestic and Italian gorgonzola. The domestic was easier to crumble onto the peaches, but the Italian was rich and creamy so we ate that on the side. Yes, the recipe makes more glaze than is needed for the peaches. But try it drizzled on cold chunks of watermelon with some fresh mint. Delicious! I'm sure I'll think of many more ways to use it.

My husband has been grilling the peaches for several years using almost the same recipe. He omits the white sugar and uses dark brown sugar instead. He stirs the brown sugar and balsamic vinegar in the sauce pan very slowly on a medium heat so it doesn't melt and turn into crystals. He just eye-balls it. He's looking for a slightly thick sauce. Not too runny. He grills the peaches. Then pours the sauce on them while still warm (on a plate) and sprinkles the crumbles of bleu cheese on it. He serves it up with pork chops.  He's very good at cooking outside on a gas grill, smoker, or with charcoal.  As a side note - if the peaches are done and the sauce is still cooking you can place a bowl over them like a dome and keep them warm.

Can we say "perfect flavor combination". The sweet, soft peach. The tangy of the vinegar and cheese was so flavorful. My daughter wanted Feta cheese on hers and said it was also wonderful. I stuck with the bleu cheese, oh my, so good.

Excellent recipe; in Italy we have a dessert like this, but instead to be grilled, peaches are baked: filled peaches with almonds.

FABulous!  I loved this.  I tried it with molasses and feta cheese, and it was SPECTACULAR.  Of course, its always hard to beat a cinnamon honey grilled peach, too.

These were delicious.  And really super easy if you buy balsamic glaze available at the grocery store.  No need then, to make your own as the recipe indicates.  These do have a tendency to stick to the grill, so prepare your grate with that in mind.  When I do these again, I'll back off on the cooking time just a bit so the peaches remain firm - you just want to heat them through on the second side.  I used feta, rather than blue cheese.  This is a great and somewhat different side dish for your next cookout.

I made these for a grilling event my company does every year, and there were none left five minutes after they came off the grill.  Everyone raved about them!  Made as written.

Edit:  Second time around added some crushed pecans to the blue cheese prior to filling and was even better.  :)

This recipe was a home run for me. I did tweak it a bit, I didn't realize that there were different kinds of peaches so I accidentally purchased *cling* peaches, and I couldn't get the centers out for the life of me. As a result, I had to slice my peaches in smaller chunks instead of using the halves. Also, I ran out of gas in my grill so I just cooked the peaches on my trusty stovetop griddle. That being said, the dish turned out fantastic. I tossed my cooked peach slices in the balsamic sauce and topped each serving with bleu cheese and my guests couldn't get enough. I plan to make this recipe again (the same way - no grilling needed) and serve it with fresh baby spinach and grilled chicken as a salad. I think it will be super!

The blue cheese on top made the recipe delicious! My husband did not like how much vinegar was on the peaches, so I would suggest adding each ingredient to your personal taste buds!

These were GOOD!  The Bleu Cheese lends a different flavor for sure.  I'll make these again.  I love the onset of Summer when I can once again grill fresh peaches and plums.  Now I'll have to try pears, too, as suggested by another reviewer.

Oh My Goodness!  Totally awesome.  I sell fruit and have really become weary of sweet fruit dishes, while there is sugar in this recipe, it is definitely not dessert dish.  I have made this with both blue cheese and gorganzola and we prefer the gorganzola.  Makes an awesome compliment to grilled fish.  Only flaw is the darn smell of the balsamic vinegar while it is reducing, I am not a vinegar fan at all (yet I love these peaches)!

We just made these with grilled pork (flavored with lots of pepper, salt and onion)...it was great! They compliment each other so well. We didn't try the blue cheese, but next time we will. Also, I would probably cut the glaze recipe in half next time, or let it reduce longer. We had quite a bit of extra sauce.

OUTSTANDING!  SPECTACULAR!  FABULOUS!  This was absolutely stunning!  I made the recipe even easier by using a balsamic glaze I got at Costco.  The blue cheese and the peaches complimented each other so well.  I served it with balsamic marinated pork tenderloin and all I can say is WOW!  This is going on my Easter dinner table for sure.  Thanks, Karen!

This was amazing! I did this with the large mushroom caps and with spicy pork sausage instead of with links....and this was amazing! Better than eating out! This is a new family classic for us!

These were very good! I had some very ripe peaches that needed to be used and wanted to try something different and these fit the bill perfectly. I loved the flavor of the sweet peaches with the blue cheese and balsamic reduction. I would totally make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've made this exactly as written and they were yummy. But I've also used pears, cooked them cut-side down in the balsamic for a few minutes (on the stove, when weather prohibited grilling), then served them filled with the cheese and walnuts and poured the balsamic on top. Delicious as well.

I made this with white peaches, didn't use any bleu cheese, and reduced the syrup amount by 1/4th but still had too much syrup. It was delicious. We cooked the halves for about 10 minutes total.

A half peach completely overpowers the meager amount of balsamic that will stay on after brushing--try slicing the peaches into wedges; this significantly improves the recipe.

We LOVE all the ingredients in this recipe AND love grilled fruit.  However, despite following this recipe to a T, the flavors just didn't complement one another.  Great presentation but it missed the mark on taste.

I baked the peaches in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees and flipped halfway through.  I didn't have peppercorns so I simmered the balsamic with whole cloves instead.  I drizzled the balsamic reduction over the cut side and broiled for 2-3 minutes, added the cheese and broiled for 1 more minute.  I let them stand for 5 minutes, drizzled with some honey and then ate them as a dessert.

I hesitate to rate this because I altered everthing, but I followed it in principle and would never rate anything less than 5 stars if I didn't follow it exactly.  I used nectarines, sliced them and sauted them in a 10 inch skillet for a few minutes over med. high heat in 1 tsp butter, 2 tsp sugar and 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar.  When they were nicely browned but still firm I served them with crumbled lemon Tilson cheese.  We loved it. Would grill them, weather permitting.  Thanks for the inspiration.

Yay! I've just discovered this year how much I love fruit with balsamic. My bleu cheese had gone a little TOO bleu, so I ended up omitting it this time and the peaches were still wonderful. Love the pepper (but it's a lot, so beware unless you are a pepper lover like me)! I look forward to trying them with the cheese soon. Thanks!!!

Wonderful.  Had Balsamic Glaze so cut some steps.  Had small Farmer's Market peaches, so 2 whole peaches apiece.  Just a touch of glaze needed and just a small sprinkling of blue cheese freshly crumbled.  Grilled inside, served with chicken, apple, craisins and pecans on bed of greens, with pomegranate dressing (courtesy of Wendy's).  YUM!

I had some left over blue cheese and so thought I would try this.  We were very sceptical, but it was a wonderful complement to a rib eye and potato salad tonight!  I would do it again for sure but increase the amount of peaches.  It definately could have worked for 6 instead of 2.

Easy to make, although I would probably suggest using a mild blue cheese.  I used a Maytag blue and it was too strong. I also used 2 halves per person as I doubled the recipe.

For people that are looking for something thats not over-poweringly sweet, this is it. It's different, but very good. I also recommend that you make it only if you like blue cheese. I used fresh peaches, and like another reviewer, cooked them in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, turned them over for 4, then put more balsamic mix on them and broiled them until the sauce was bubbling, maybe about 4-5 minutes. Then, I took them out and put the cheese on them. The peaches still end up very sweet, which is offset by the blue cheese, or gorganzola, which I used instead. I will make these again.

I think I did something wrong.  The flavors never seemed to blend together.  I will try again since I love the idea.  A previous poster was referring to Gunlach Bundschu, an awesome Sonoma winery.

We tried this out on friends and were surprised we ALL liked it. So much so that my husband and I made it again the next night! It's simple and different and delicious.  One minor hint, boiling the vinegar to make the glaze made our eyes water! I kept the leftover glaze and didn't have to go through that the second time around, so you may want to make extra and refrigerate for another time.

I really had my doubts about grilling fruit, but I am so glad i tried it finally...not only was it delicious the grilling changes the texture making the peaches sweeter and lighter (at least I thought)...scrumptious and soo easy perfect for those hard not perfect peaches that go on sale, but never ripen right...

Wish I could add more stars...I'd give it a 10!  This is so amazingly simple and really appeals to everyone's palate!  I prepared this one evening for my better half and the next evening, I was asked to prepare it for our dinner party of 8. WOW! Knowing our friends, some have issues with bleu cheese...so, I changed that one ingredient to fresh goat cheese.  It was so darn good.  I have also tried it with Feta cheese crumbles.  It's all good! Living in the Texas Hill Country with fresh Fredericksburg home grown peaches!  The perfect recipe for perfect summer night!!  Thank you for the recipe!

This is a keeper.  Our family loved it.  I made them in the oven as another poster mentioned.  I also put a pineapple slice under each peach to hold it in place as another poster recommended.  Thanks for a great recipe and great ideas from the other posters.

The sauce was tasty but too much in quantity for just two peaches.  There was enough for four peaches (eight halves).

Terrific! Leave out the sugar. This is a savory dessert. I sometimes omit the crumbled cheese and grill the peaches with a touch of fresh chopped rosemary and a splash of EVOO. This version is also good with a dollop of fresh whipped cream beside it. A great dessert with the last sips of your dinner wine.

I like to just very lightly dust them with sugar, the sugar will caramelize and give great grill marks for presentation.

This recipe missed the mark for us.  My husband took one bite and refused to finish.  We LOVE bleu cheese and are huge fans of balsamic, so I'm not sure why this left us disappointed.  I finished my peach and the remaining went into the garbage.  It was not enjoyable at all.

I added some brown sugar using a 'scant' amount of blue cheese to cut down on the richness just a bit.  This is very different but we enjoyed the taste!

I did not like this at all, too strong tasting. I would never concider it a desert. I love blue cheese but these were awful.

Never in a million years would I think of grilling peaches with sweetened vinegar and topping it all with blue cheese, but I sure am happy that you did! I love everything about this recipe - the mingling of flavors, the ease of preparation, and it's healthy to boot. Thanks so much for the post.

I made it per the recipe, but after tasting, found the blue cheese unnecessary. But then, I am not that fond of Blue cheese. I may try it with goat cheese next time.

These are excellent!  Easy to make just don't reduce the vinegar too much;  it thickens as it sits.  The first reduced balsamic vinegar I did had far too much pepper - next time I cut the black pepper in half and it was much better.  I didn't have any blue cheese so I substituted feta cheese and it was great.

This was very tasty.  The glaze didn't firm up for me very much.  And go light on the glaze, it can easily over power the peaches.  Grilled peaches for the win!  Also, I recommend a feta cheese or gorgonzola if you think your guests might not like a strong cheese like blue cheese.

I followed the recipe exactly except I halved the balsamic glaze per the other ratings. I also grilled a chicken breast. I plated  baby greens and spinach mix and topped the greens with a whole peach and chicken breast. I used a bit more balsamic vinaigrette and viola, a beautiful dinner. Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe is amazing!  I took the skin off the peaches and I used mascarpone cheese instead of the blue cheese it called for.  I've made it several times now and everyone loves it.

This recipe is completely worthy of peak of the season peaches! I make this multiple times during that month. Obviously blue cheese is one of those love/hate ingredients that I leave off for 1 family member.  You won't regret giving this dish a try.

Good basic recipe with lots of options for creativity. The recipe had more balsamic vinegar than I actually wanted to expend or needed, so I reduced it the second time that I used this recipe and added some honey and cinnamon to the glaze. Next time I plan to use port as my husband and another reviewer suggested. We love blue cheese, but it was a little strong with peaches, so next time I will add cream cheese as another reviewer suggested; or I will change it into a dessert by topping with vanilla or peach ice cream.

Loved this! My whole family did as well. I used brie instead of bleu cheese, family preference. I'm going to try this with pears putting a fig on top and do everything exactly the same as the recipe states....

We have made this twice, but since I don't like bleu cheese, there is never any on hand!  It's great without the cheese, though, because the glaze is great.  Maybe I'll try Feta next time.

This isn't as good a some are leading you to believe. The black pepper amount is too high and doesn't work that well with the balsamic. I was disappointed by this recipe.

This was an easy recipe to follow and impressed my dinner guests. I didn't realize how much vinegar was needed. I bought a 16 oz bottle and used most of it since I doubled the recipe; I made 4 whole peaches. I did cut the pepper down by half. After I cooked it, I put it through a sieve to catch the pepper. For some reason, the pepper I bought is big pieces and not really powdery.

I ended up only using half the glaze. I'm saving the leftover to use it for another day. We skipped the blue cheese and I topped them off with vanilla frozen yogurt since that's all I had in my freezer. It had such interesting and complex flavor and kept me going for more. One guest dunked a Madeline cookie in it. 

My little back story: my husband grilled these the same time as the dinner so I had to think of a way keeping them warm. I put them in my toaster oven on warm for about an hour and these things kept on cooking, they were so soft and gooey delicious! Word of caution, keep the temperature low because some of the peaches began to burn. I just peeled some of the crusty burned parts off but it was still so delicious! My husband recommended tossing in some brandy next time but I thought it was perfect the way it was.

Would recommend reducing glaze on the grill also as it has a strong odor while reducing.  Dessert was good but flavors didn't seem to blend as well as I would have liked.

Just made this as a side dish with dinner tonight and it was great, but gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it could be even easier, and also I think the cook time is too long and made the peaches a little mushy.  I used a pan grill (instead of a real grill) and sprayed with a little Pam.  Would have been better to cook maybe 3 minutes each side instead of what the instructions say, which I feel is too long.  

The flavors with the balsamic glaze (I used a store-bought one) and blue cheese crumbles are amazing, but maybe go a little light on the glaze to keep it from being too sweet.

Have made this recipe many times. Guests even request that we make it.  Have substituted nectarines, plums, & pineapple.  think I want to trey mangos next.
