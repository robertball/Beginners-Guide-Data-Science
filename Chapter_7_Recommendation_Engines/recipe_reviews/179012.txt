This recipe turned out great. I used chicken legs and chicken wings. The chicken was moist. I seasoned the chicken with pepper, seasoning salt, onion powder and garlic powder. I served this with corn and rice-a-roni.Delicious!!

I changed it up! I added a half can of cream of mushroom soup around the edges after I spooned on the cream of chicken, on top of the mushroom soup I added a big bag of frozen green beans, added pepper and 1/4 cup milk. So the green beans cooked for only a half an hour. I served it with some whole grain rice and had a hearty dinner!

I used this recipe with boneless chicken breast and it was delicious! Very juicy. I cooked some rotinni and mixed it with fresh parmesian cheese and the sauce with the chicken. It was a very good meal. i will fix it again!

Very, very good! Easy and yummy.. I used chicken legs without the skin. The only thing I changed was the time, I increased it just because the bone-in meat, to make sure. About 12-15 minutes more. Great recipe! Thank you! Monica.

This is a good recipe. I used cream of mushroom soup and I was worried about the soup burning so I baked the chicken in salt, pepper, and garlic powder and drizzled with butter for the first 30 mins. I added the soup, flipped the chicken and baked for the next 30. It was really moist and my husband liked it a lot. The only thing I would do next time is take the skin off.

A solid recipe that's fine all but itself. However, I couldn't resist kicking it up a notch. First I browned the chicken in a cast iron skillet, then topped it with 4 potatoes cut into chunks and coated in extra virgin olive oil and a few spices. I added about half a medium onion cut into slices and put the whole thing in the oven. In addition to the soup (I used cream of mushroom) I added a 4 oz. can of sliced mushrooms. It turned out great.

We had to go out before dinner, so I ended up just putting the soup in the bottom of a casserole dish, placing the chicken on top of the soup and then seasoning the chicken with Goya and garlic powder.  I threw it in the oven and set the timer for the oven to turn off in an hour.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  I will follow the recipe next time so I can give a true review.  :)

we make this dish (as written, without changes) all the time. The chicken is moist & the soup/sauce is very flavorful. Usually make it with rice (pouring the sauce over the rice). Great go-to dish.

5 stars as written but this is also a GREAT easy basic recipe that you can make to please anyone's tastes. I prefer the Cream of Chicken but my mother in law makes this with Cream of Mushrom and baby carrots (just boil the carrots to soften them first) and it's really good. I love making this with different blends of seasonings and it always turns out great (unless you accidently make it too salty because you grabbed garlic salt instead of garlic powder!! Won't make that mistake again!! LOL!) But this is definitely a must in my recipe box!!!

Always a delicious choice. Quick and easy. I like to add noodles, mashed potatoes, or rice to go with the chicken and gravy.

This reciple was pretty blah for me. Used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and added garlic powder and pepper while cooking and it just didn't do much.

This is a wonderful recipe. I added a package of dry onion soup mix to the cream of chicken and it really brought out the flavor and also made a good sauce to put on the potatoes.

It was okay... I prefer the chicken breasts I guess.  It was very moist though.

Good recipe. I used skinless breasts & thighs (about 3 pounds), saut√©ed 8 oz mushrooms in butter, garlic,  & soy sauce and added to the cream of mushroom soup. Baked the chicken at 350 for 20 min then added the mushroom sauce. Baked another 20 min. Served with brown rice. Raves from my 14 year old!

Made this tonight using leg quarters (seasoned with just salt and pepper) and Cream of Mushroom Soup...it was so good, juicy, and tender. Served with a side of candied yams and green beans, but should have added rice too as the sauce would have paired well with it. The whole family including 2 young picky kids loved it!
