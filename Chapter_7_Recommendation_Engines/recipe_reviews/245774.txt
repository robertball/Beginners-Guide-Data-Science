I'm so excited to have found this recipe! Couldn't find all the exact ingredients at my local grocery store, so I used regular spaghetti, pancetta (5 oz, as I doubled the recipe), and diced San Marzano tomatoes. I also left out the onion, as my husband doesn't like them. Oh my goodness, this was DELICIOUS! So much rich flavor, and surprisingly filling. Even my super picky three year old gobbled it up and asked for more. It's a winner!

Great flavors and easy to make!  I love the serving size for two, it was perfect.  This is a recipe that delivers a great range of flavors and in such a short amount of time.  Spaghetti may work for a substitution, but the Bucatini is the way to go!  Thank you Chef Carlo, we'll be making this again...and again!

This recipe was recommended to me by Buckwheat Queen and I am so glad she did. In honor of the earthquake victims in the region I used heart shaped pasta. This turned out perfect and will definitely be made again. I used an arrabbiata spicy seasoning mix instead of red peppers and bacon for the  guanciale.

Not sure why you would completely discard the garlic. makes sense to remove them to cook the pancetta so it doesnt burn, but it would make sense to add back with the tomatoes. Great dish.

I heard about this dish on NPR, in reference to the recent earthquake. My butcher didn't have guanciale, so I subbed pancetta. It turned out wonderfully, especially since I love crushed red pepper and put it in all of my red sauces. Oh, and I also donated $25.00 to Italy earthquake relief.

Great recipe... I made it exactly except for subbing pancetta since that all I could find at the market. It was really tasty and I would make it again!

Easy and delicious. I used pancetta and doubled the recipe. But, I used about 1/3 c olive oil. I'll definitely make again.
