It's hard to believe these are whole grain and low in fat!  I love how healthy these are!  My husband will love these for his mid morning snack.  I didn't have a few of the ingredients so I made some substitutions: I used coarsely ground oats for the wheat germ, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice plus milk to equal 1 cup for the buttermilk, and 1 cup regular chocolate chips for the 1/2 cup minis.  Then I added some raw sugar on top for some crunchiness.  Right out of the oven they stuck to the paper, so next time I will probably just grease the pan well and skip the paper liners.  I got 18 regular-size muffins out of this recipe.  And if you're wondering about the cinnamon, use it!  It's not a real dominant flavor, instead it just enhances the chocolate flavor.  Thanks for this recipe, I will likely use it again!

I made these nearly according to the instructions (I omitted the cinnamon and did not use any white sugar, I  believe I used agave nectar), and they came out dense and a bit chewy.  At first I wasn't sure why, but a few baking experiments (I bake a lot) helped me figure it out.  Flax seeds, ground, are an egg replacement.  They work wonderfully, but not understanding their properties and using too much is going to result in this heavier texture.  I recommend omitting the egg, and reducing the flax seeds to about 1 tbsp. (with 3 tbsp. water).  Make up about 3/4 cup with either whole wheat (finely ground) or whole spelt flour.  This should produce a lighter, fluffier muffin that is still healthy.  I am going to try to work with this recipe some more to see what I can come up with.  It's a good start, just misunderstands some ingredients.

These are great!!  I did not have flax seed so after some research decided to replace with whole wheat flour and thank goodness they worked out wonderfully with nice round tops!!  My son who is the pickiest eater on the planet with many food aversions, LOVES THESE!! And they are healthy.. By the way I went and bought the ground flax seed for when I make them next time.

OMG, these are FANTASTIC. I can't believe that they are full of whole wheat and hidden pumpkin. They are out of control delicious. UPDATE: Made them again last night, using bran instead of the wheat germ and they were just as delicious. These are hands-down my new favourite "healthy" muffins.

I just made these this afternoon. My family can't believe how delicious they are. They are extremely healthy. Instead of pumpkin puree I added 1 cup of apple sauce. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly...they cooked up between 10-15 minutes. thank you for the recipe it is wonderful!

AMAZING MUFFINS! I was craving chocolate muffins from Sweet Tomatoes, and so I was looking through recipes. I decided to try this one because I don't eat anything "unhealthy", so I don't use AP flour etc. I halved this recipe, used half brown & half evaporated cane sugar. Subbed buttermilk for 1/2 cup soymilk & 2 tsp. Apple cider vinegar. I also recommend people to get chocolate chips that have a 60%-70% cocoa content if you want that ooey gooey yummy chocoholic yummyness we all want sometimes. Just roughly chop them up and throw them in with the dry ingredients. I also used 1/3 of the cinnamon that was posted, and I think it made a difference in the batter. I also used greek yogurt instead of pumpkin puree, since I didn't have it on hand. I LOVE THIS RECIPE! :D

My oldest son and I made these together this morning. We both had a good ol' time. He made the recipe as is and was quite meticulous at making sure we measured the right amount and used the right ingredients. We didn't have mini-chips, so we used regular chocolate chips. I wisked the dry ingredients together until smooth, then tossed the chips in the dry. We added the combined wet ingredients and used the spatula to fold in the wet until everything was just moistened. That made a really fluffy muffin. My son thought the sugar crystals on the top were a great idea, so we sprinkled a little Sugar in the Raw on top of the muffins before baking. Really, REALLY good. Especially with a cup of hot coffee. All but three are gone. We really enjoyed these. I do think that when we make these again, I would cut back on the cinnamon just a bit.

Definitely the most delicious healthy muffin I've ever made. It isn't overly sweet, so the chocolate chips are definitely key.

Love these! Will be keeping a supply of these in the freezer.  Extremely picky toddler likes them and I don't feel bad letting him have these chocolate muffins for breakfast or snack because they're so healthful!

My kids are wild for these muffins -- they brag to their friends that their mom lets them have chocolate muffins for breakfast.  I usually tweak recipes after making them the first time but this one is great just as it is.  These are delicious muffins that I can feel good serving to everyone.  Many thanks to fiestaqueen for posting it!

Easy to make if you have the ingred. and pretty yummy for a healthy muffin. The adults who tasted these enjoyed them enough to eat more than one, but were warned they were healthy before trying. The little ones also enjoyed, but the teenagers did not like them. I would make again and share with those who appreciate the healthy ingredients. I did feel they were a tad dry and some of the little kids said they tasted like oatmeal.

Healthy, easy & the kids love 'em!  I made small changes in the recipe like other reviewers and found this recipe to be easy to play around with.  Don't think you can really mess it up.  They do taste "healthy"---good, chocolately, but "healthy."

I subbed ground oats for the wheat germ (didn't have any), kept everything the same except I didn't have choc chips.  I think they definately need the choc chips, not sweet enough without them.

FANTASTIC bread. I made it into two loafs instead of muffins and it is like thick chocolate cake that melts in your mouth. I didn't have pumpkin pure so I used mashed bananas instead and what goes better together than chocolate and bananas! To think this bread is on the healthy side compared to how good it is, is ridiculous! I highly recommend. My two loafs were devoured in less than an hour!

I have made this recipe several times now and love it!  However, I have modified it to make it better suit my husband's and my taste.  Main problem from the original recipe I found was being too dry and hard. Here is what I modified: double the butter milk and chocolate chips. I used mini muffin pan and baked them for 15 minutes, and they came out so tender and perfect!  Thank you for sharing the recipe :)

Just popped these out of the oven. First off I noticed since there is no oil they only needed to cook for about 15 minutes (my oven is accurate) good thing I checked them or they would have overcooked. Second, the flavor is pretty "blah". I made the recipe exactly as written, no changes except the cook time. I'm fairly shocked at the reviews calling these delicious, I notice many people changed the recipe so maybe that's what made them "delicious". For me, I made them as directed they are quite bland. I can't taste the cocoa at all so the only chocolate flavor you get is if you bite on a choc. chip. I do love that they are healthy and pretty moist so we will finish them up. Though after being on a calorie-conscious diet for several months I can think of other snacks that have alot more flavor for 237 calories or less.

so yummy! I made the following changes only because I did not have all the ingredients: did not have cocoa, used regular milk with tbs of cider vinegar, used a little extra ww flour, extra choc chips and about 3/4 cup brown sugar. a dash of pumpkin spice, and ground nutmeg-- these are oh so good!

Am I the only one who was surprised that there was not any salt in this recipe? Not looking at the recipe, I went to my cabinet and got out all my usual muffin ingredients - baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt. Double check - whaaaa? No salt? So I added some anyway, 1/2 tsp. I really think it helped bring out the sweetness a little more. I didn't have any pumpkin on hand, so I subbed banana baby food. :/ I wasn't going to let lack of pumpkin keep me from making this recipe. Everyone loved it, from the babies to the grandmas and everyone in the middle. The consistency was soooo good, almost fudgy. This is going in the recipe box for sure!
Edit: I made these again, this time with pumpkin. Now, I love me some pumpkin, no doubt. However, I have to say that I'll make it with banana next time. It added a depth of sweetness and flavor that rounded these muffins out. Still a great recipe!

I've made these twice now:  the first time I followed the recipe with the one exception of using a half cup of ground almond meal rather than wheat germ (simply preference).   They are pretty good for being a much healthier alternative to the normal chocolate muffin.  I wouldn't make them as stated again, though, since I like my less healthy muffins too much.  So, I changed up a few things and they still were a 3 star recipe in my book.  I appreciate the health-oriented recipe and will keep these in mind if I can talk myself into eating healthier......

Love these!  Fairly healthy and super tasty, even my 2 1/2 year old picky son gobbles them up.  My tip to people who had a dense muffin is to spoon the flour into the cup rather than scooping directly from the bag -- this compacts the flour and will lead to a more dense finished product.  You can also use a whole wheat pastry flour for a fluffier muffin.  Either way, they're excellent and I make them often.  Thanks!

I wonder by what definition makes this "healthy"?  It has wheat, which is found to not be so "healthy" by some. It has milk and eggs that some feel are not so healthy, it has 2 kinds of chocolate and it has sugar!  Does adding flax seed make it healthy?  I gave it a 4 cause it's not fair to give it less just because my opinion is different on "what is healthy".  Use applesauce instead of the milk.  That would cut that part at least.

I added about a half cup of white sugar....I know it kind of ruins the whole health factor, but it really makes it taste good! Awesome way to sneak good stuff into a naughty package!

Fantastic! Healthy! I didn't have any chocolate chips so I used some caramel bits I had. Great idea! This batter made about 12 large muffins and 12 mini muffins with a bit left over that I haven't made yet. Mini muffins took 15 minutes to bake. The large ones took 20 minutes. Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!!

These are deceivingly delicious! and like another reviewer (Larkspur - your dead on about the specks being annoying), the little bits were not visually appealing but the taste made up for it. I made them into mini muffins and took the to the office, no one was the wiser and they devoured them! :) Thanks for the recipe, definitely will make again!

Lots of nutrition packed in these! I love them..but weren't a hit with the kiddos.  I will definitely continue making them for myself however.  I do wish the calorie count was a little lower..might try lowering the sugar content some in the future.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yeah, yeah, I subbed more whole wheat flour for ground flax seed, left out the wheat germ, cocoa & chips.  'Still giving a good rating.  With those changes, I think it's a matter of preference than the actual recipe.  Huh?  :D  'Meaning I don't care for chocolate & pumpkin/spices together - so I didn't add them.  K?  :)  Review: Good muffins, not very spicy or all that pumpkin-y, but good.  Surprisingly moist.  'Added 1/2t salt.  'May make again upping & varying the spices, which is almost unheard of from me since I'm one of those "weirdos" that wants pumpkin pie, muffins, etc to taste like pumpkin not a "spice whatever" with pumpkin in it.

This was a tasty muffin, yet I would like to tweak it to make it more moist. I followed the recipe exactly, and I must say that the batter was easy to work with, and the muffins did not stick to my (greased) muffin pan.

These were awesome. My family couldn't get enough of them! I followed the recipe exactly with no substitutions. With the batter, I was able to fill 1 - 12 cup muffin tin AND a 24 cup mini muffin tin... which came in really hadny with my little ones.  The muffins turned out really moist. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  The only change I made was using wheat bran rather than wheat germ.  They taste like brownies with lots of moisture from the pumpkin (but a healthier texture than brownies).

This recipe is good as is but it is very adaptable. I have made it several times, my favorite way is substituting applesauce for the pumpkin puree and soy milk for the buttermilk. Very good!

these are absolutely delicious!!! I used wheat bran instead of germ and I love it. The pumpkin puree makes it nice and moist and they do satisfy the chocolate cravings.

We REALLY liked these. I added a bit more chocolate chips to make them a little sweeter, and one of the times I made them, I realized I was out of pumpkin. I threw in my baby's pureed pears and it worked fine! :) Thanks for sharing!!

Everyone loved these muffins, and no one could tell that they had ground flax seeds and wheat germ in them.  I was nervous about the amount of cinnamon the recipe called for, but it was perfect.

Yum! I didn't have any ground flax seed so I substituted white flour for it. Came out fine and the muffins were a big hit.

I thought that these were very good. Especially being fairly healthy. With the holidays coming up I did add a small festive twist by folding in andes peppermint crunch chips and then putting whipped frosting on top w/ a few additional peppermint chips for good measure! Yum. I also added one container of lowfat yoplait very vanilla yogurt to the recipe.

I have made these muffins twice now - and they are definitely worth all of the effort.  The first time I made them, they were for my son's 4th birthday party.  I was nervous about the texture being a bit too dense for passing as "cupcakes", so I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat.  I have always used apple sauce instead of pumpkin because I've never had any on hand.  The second time I made them, I even made the apple sauce from scratch!   These muffins are absolutely lovely.  I'm grateful to have it in my box!

These muffins were excellent!!!  My dad loved these and said they were a keeper.  I'm not the biggest fan of sweet chocolate muffins, so these were perfect.  Not too sweet and perfect for breakfast.  You can't taste the pumpkin either and they were dry and grainy from the flax and wheat germ.  The only difference I did was to add vinegar to skim milk instead of buttermilk.   Also 400 is probably way too high for most stoves.  Stick with 350!

Truly Irresistible!  These were so good I forgot they were healthy.  I didn't have choc. chips so I cut up semi sweet baking chocolate.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  This is a great find - thanks for posting!

Not as sweet as you would expect them to be with 1 cup of sugar. The pumpkin taste is completely hidden under the chocolate (so as you'd expect my two-year-old loved them). I substituted whole wheat flour for white without any problem.  Overall very tasty and a good combination of good-for-you and a chocolaty treat.

These were so good!!! I used 2 bananas instead of pumpkin and ground whole oats instead of wheat germ and did raw honey plus 1/2 Tblsp molasses  instead of brown sugar and added pinch of himalayan salt as other review mentioned to add salt.... they raised beautifully! I did add a few more choc chips... I wish I would have checked at 18-19 minutes instead of at 20mins..... mine cooked faster in my convection oven but were still oh so delicious!!!!! These will be a repeat!!!!

Delicious! Everyone in the family loves them! We subbed oat brand for wheat germ and used 3/4cup of pure maple syrup instead of brown sugar and they turned out fantastic. My 3 year old (who did most of the work himself) loves them. Thank you for the great recipe!

Super awesome - loved by my 5yr olds (both the making and eating), which says a lot :).  20 mins at 400 was perfect.  Didn't have buttermilk or wheat germ so upped flour and used regular milk ... not sure how they'd be different, but they were great made our way :).  Will definitely make again and again.

I wanted to bake something on a snowy day, and tried these. I really like them!   I used 2 very ripe bananas instead of pumpkin, and oatmeal instead of wheat germ because I didn't have any.  I also used a mixture of yogurt and milk instead of buttermilk.  I had to add about 1/2 cup water because the mixture seemed too dry.  Once I filled the 12 muffin cups, they looked way too full so I took a little scoop out of each one and filled a dozen mini-muffins.  The minis baked in 10 minutes, and the regular size were done in 18 minutes.  Both my husband and I enjoyed them.  They were nice and chocolatey and pretty moist. I thought they were plenty sweet.  I think next time I'll use smaller scoops and make 2 dozen, and add a few walnuts and another banana.  Now I can have chocolate cake for breakfast!

These are awesome! I was looking for an easy double chocolate muffin recipe that I could tweak to make healthier - this one is already tweaked! I did substitute some white flour for some of the whole wheat flour and some oil and applesauce for the pumpkin. Came out perfect!

Although the ingredients seemed a bit strange, I trusted the high reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using only 1/4 cup wheat germ cause that's all I had left. I don't understand how others reviewed this highly. These were flavorless and odd tasting.

These are great - they are exactly what the ingredients profess them to be; a chocolaty healthy(ish) muffin! I love that there is no oil in them, and lots of good heart healthy whole grains The mini chocolate chips are great to "discover" as you're enjoying the muffins. I followed ingredients exactly as written and baked 20 minutes and they came out great. Good for a breakfast treat or snack.

I used dark cocoa and sour cream instead of pumpkin (but will try pumpkin when I have some). These muffins are really yummy and really don't taste like they have all that good stuff in them... impressive! Oh, I also used only 1 tsp of cinnamon.

They’re dry and grainy and not super flavorful. I’m all for healthy, which is why I made them, but I’m disappointed and kind of frustrated I spent the time to make them. I was going to serve them to family, but I don’t really think they’ll go over very well.

This was a delicious recipe even after I tweaked it to use up the ingredients I had in the fridge. I used vanilla soy milk, to which I had added a tablespoon of vinegar, instead of buttermilk. Instead of pumpking puree I used pureed pears. Lastly, I used  a cup of regular sized chocolate chips instead of minis. Baked up moist and tasty - I'll be making these again!

Although I have eaten better chocolate muffins, I still gave this a 5 because of it's health factor. I didn't even realize there was no oil until after I baked it. I didn't have enough flax seed so I used 1/2 c. and upped the wheat germ to 3/4 c. I also opened a huge can of pumpkin so I threw in 1 c. of puree. I doubled the recipe and it turned out great. I finished baking in about 22 minutes or so.

Excellent! Mine turned out super dark and luscious looking, and they tasted even better. Very chocolatey, moist and soft. I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup for moisture, and used an extra 1/4 cup of mini chips. The calories were still very reasonable (well under 300 calories). The whole grain taste/texture shines through in a very good way; if you only like white flour, you might not appreciate that, but I find it lovely. They somehow taste healthy *and* indulgent, and the calorie total is fantastic for something so rich.

Delicious -- had to make a few subs -- whole oat flour in place of the whole wheat, almond milk and one Tbsp vinegar for the buttermilk -- also left out the egg (vegan), used Hershey's special dark cocoa and broken up Bakers Semi Sweet Chocolate -- I love chocolate!  Turned out perfectly.

I followed the recipe with high hopes, but these did not hit the mark.  They are not what I was hoping.  These are moist but grainy and the flavor is not all that great.

For how healthy these are, these brownies are awesome. I didn't have flax seed, so I used wheat germ instead. Watch out, these things are really fibrous! Might want to warn your friends, before they go eating 5 of these bad boys.

I was hesitant to make this because my family doesn't always like "healthy" tasting foods, but based on other reviews I gave it a shot. My 8-year-old was still pretty picky, but he ate most of one. He said it was "too chocolatey," believe it or not. I thought they were amazing. The cinnamon was perfect--not overwhelming; it seemed to complement the chocolate perfectly. The mini chocolate chips were a wonderful touch.

This nutritious version is great.  Mini chocolate chips give each bite a bit of sweetness.  I sprayed half the muffin cups lightly to keep these low fat muffins from sticking to the paper.  The other half did stick to the paper,  but taste wonderful - pumpkin cinnamon and full flavor are worth the calories.  Thank you for the recipe!

Really good! As it is the holiday season, I couldn't find a can of pumpkin to save my life - so, I used a 6 oz. jar of squash (baby food-"stage 3").  Instead of a full T. of cinnamon, used a T. of cinnamon/sugar.  My jr. high aged daughter isn't hungry before she catches the bus, but doesn't eat lunch until nearly 1 pm.  I've been searching for something she'll really like (and thus eat) as its not good to try to learn on an empty stomach.  With her love of chocolate, these will be perfect! (And she'll never know about all the 'good' stuff they include!)  A win-win recipe :)

This is awesome, truly awesome. I was a little scared of the cinnamon, as my 3 yr old said the dough burned her tongue, but once cooked, it was fine. I added 1/4 cup extra cocoa, and did the sugar in the raw sprinkles on top. Cooked about 18 minutes, and was great. Buttered out of the oven, was very delicious!! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Fiestaqueen!

These muffins are amazing good - taste good and full of nutritious ingredients.  My whole family loves them (including two young kids).  The pumpkin puree keeps them really moist even if you over bake them (I did that once).    The only thing you want to be careful is you don't want to serve these to those who do not like pumpkins because there is a taste of pumpkin in these muffins.  A lot of thanks to the recipe creator!

I'll start by saying I was a little scared... toasted my wheat germ (350* on a cookie sheet, stirring frequently, about five minutes)... used chocolate soy milk with apple cider vinegar in place of buttermilk... applesauce in place of pumpkin puree... only 1/2 cup brown sugar. My chocolate chips were big and gooey - fantastic. My only issue is they are a little dry. I would try more applesauce or a splash of veggie oil. Making them again very soon...

These muffins are good, but I wouldn't call them irresistible.  My kids and nieces took a couple bites, but didn't finish off their muffins.  For a healthy muffin, I'd rather make the makeover morning glory muffins.

These muffins are very tasty. Since I didn’t have buttermilk, I subbed 1 tbsp white vinegar in a measuring cup and filled the rest with milk and let it set for a few minutes. I also used regular chocolate chips chopped smaller because I didn’t have minis. And what the heck, I made them triple chocolate muffins by doubling the chocolate chips to 1 cup - the more chocolate the merrier, right? These baked up nicely in only 13 minutes. These were still moist and yummy the next day! Now this is one baked good I don’t feel too guilty about eating! Thanks for the great recipe.

5 stars for a healthy muffin, but maybe only 4 stars for a traditional muffin. My muffins cooked really quickly and were finished in 16 minutes. I didn't have mini choc chips so used regular sized. I do not recommend this tiny switch because the big chips were too sparse in the muffins. Also, I had to use whole wheat flour in place of wheat germ because I didn't have that on hand - this switch may have contributed to the shorter cooking time. Great for my chocolate cravings but I'm not sure kids would like these.

Very good muffins. I made them without any substitutions, and they were a little chewy.  I will try modifiying, but all in all very good.

I was very pleasantly surprised, never having worked with both wheat germ and flax seed, and in the same recipe with pumpkin.  The only change I made was baking this as a loaf instead of muffins. We enjoyed this and will have it again soon.

I'm eating these right now and I am speechless! Absolutely delicious. I made the recipe as is except I added a little less sugar and made a loaf instead of muffins. You would not know that these are healthier. My loaf doesn't have "flecks" in them like others mentioned. The picky kids love them which is a bonus. Will definitely be making these regularly. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious chocolate muffins!  I used jumbo muffin pans and cooked at 375 for 25-30 minutes.  I also added a cream cheese filling (8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla).  I will absolutely make these again!

These are pretty good considering how healthy they are, but they seem to be missing something.  I made them exactly as directed....I think next time I would double the chocolate chips or maybe top them with a glaze.  I guess they're not as sweet as I would like.

These muffins are really good.  The first time I made them with flax seeds and did not like them as well.  My kids would not eat them.  But I tried them again and ground the flax.  This time I could not keep my kids from them.  I also made them for a friend who needed snacks for a meeting she was having and everyone loved them.  She asked for the recipe.  They are wonderful, and work as a good breakfast as well as a snack.

I was very impressed when I saw this recipe. I thought the muffins were very tasty and I really enjoyed the cinnimon. I did make a small change, I didn't have pumkin puree so I cooked a small sweet potato and mashed it up. Next time I make this I think I might add some peanut butter.

These muffins are pretty good - but definitely healthy!  I and some of my kids liked them but others did not.  The batter is super thick and the muffins bake up the way they go in, which means they don't look very appetizing when they come out of the oven.  If we tried this again we would add a bit of oil or melted butter or extra milk to see if that helped the muffins cook up like regular muffins.  For a "healthy" muffin though these are not bad and I would probably make them again with those changes!

These muffins are pretty good! With no oil or butter, the whole wheat flour, wheat germ, flax & pumpkin purée, I was kinda wondering if these would be as rich or as sweet enough as I would like to satisfy my sweet tooth - or if they would taste "healthy". I am pleased to say that with the chocolate chips in it, it is sweet enough for me, and the flavor of the whole wheat flour, flax, and wheat germ does not overpower the muffin like I feared it might. I made the recipe as is (except using lactose-free milk + lemon juice = buttermilk). I would definitely make it again. They will taste great cut in half with margarine!

I was nervous about using the healthy ingredients but my kids ages 16, 15 and 11 have been begging me to make these again!  They were moist and very yummy!  I can feel good making them, knowing there are healthy ingredients!

I liked them for a an energy packed breakfast muffin but it wasn’t popular with my kids I think because of how dense they were. They had a protein bar density.

I forgot to add the cocoa powder to the mix and they were still SO good!  I did a little less than 1 Tbs of cinnamon, and used 1 cup of regular sized chocolate chips.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour.  Before I baked them, I sprinkled some Swedish Pearl Sugar on top for a nice crunch.  Make sure to check your muffins around 15 minutes!! Mine were done at that time.  I will definitely make these again -- with the cocoa powder next time ;-). UPDATE :: I made them with the cocoa powder and my kids and I both prefer the muffins without it.

Very yummy. I did substitute a few ingredients: banana for pumpkin, coconut palm sugar for regular sugar, almond flour for wheat germ and a fibre mix for the flax seed (from Costco called Ultimate Daily Cleanse made from ground flax seed, psyllium husks, inulin, and more). It was what I had on hand. The temperature might have been a bit hot for my oven as the muffins were done and starting to go too dark after only 15 minutes. Next time I'll try 375 degrees instead. But the flavours are lovely and just the right amt of sweetness for us. Hubby and I both enjoyed them and had 2 each straight out of the oven!

Great muffins, very chocolaty!  (my son says 'outstanding muffins!')   I used only 1/2 cup of sugar, and substituted the flax for almond flour & hemp as I was out of flax.   Cooked for 25 mins which seemed perfect.  Will definitely make these again.

Oh my goodness! I made this & it's impossible to eat just 1, or 2, or 3 in one sitting! I didn't have wheat germ, so I added brown rice flour in replacement of it, but I kept the recipe as is. Will be making it over & over & over! Love this chocolate muffin recipe!

I just made these today because my daughter have been lusting after the disgusting cafeteria ones.  They were a hit with the whole family! I had to make some changes with the ingredients I already had on hand. Used 1.5 cups ancient einkorn flour, half cup of ground flax and no wheat germ  (didn't have any) and 1/4 cup of vanilla protein powder and kept everything else exactly as written and they're soo delicious and moist. I will be making these regularly and keep them in the freezer to throw in my daughter's lunchbox. Next time I'll sub half erythritol to cut some of the sugar out as well. Oh I forgot to mention I used almond milk with some vinegar because I didn't have any buttermilk. Worked great!

My 5 year old and his friends LOVE these "healthier" chocolate muffins! I used whole wheat flour and flax seed like the recipe called for. I substituted oatmeal for the other main ingredient. It did not take the full 20 minutes to bake, i would check them with a toothpick after about 16 min in a 400° oven. I will definitely be making these again and again and again...

My picky teenage daughter eats these in the morning for  a quick breakfast. Lots of whole grains, and portable.
I think they don't taste very chocolatey, but she does, and that's fine by me. I would definitely use greased muffin tins and not the paper liners. The paper liners don't peel off well and that's a bit of a mess.

These tasted delicious but were not as moist as I thought they should be.   I added  1/2 tsp salt since there was no salt in the recipe.  When I make again I'll add more pumpkin or oil.

Reading somewhere that flax could be sbstituted for wheat germ, I added a LOT of flax. I got very dense muffins. So, add extra flour if you don't have wheat germ, but all that flax makes these dense! I will make them again before rating them...but as is, the taste is decicious, just need to fix the texture.

This recipe was okay... Considering how healthy they were, they weren't that bad. The pumpkin added a lot of moisture. I added double the chocolate chips to make them sweeter.

I really enjoyed this recipe! The first time making it, I didn't have the flax or wheat germ and just used xtra whl wht flour for flax and ground almonds for the wheat germ. I followed the suggestions of others and added about a 1/2c extra of both buttermilk and pumpkin to avoid dryness. I also increased choc chips to 3/4c and sprinkled sugar on top of the muffins. I read that they don't rise much so I didn't bother filling the muffins cup just half way--I filled them until they were rounded (using all my mix in just 12 muffins) This made perfect muffins that actually rised a good 1/2inch over the top of the cup. I would definetly recommend spraying the cups as this recipe doesn't have any fat and the muffins stick to the paper if you don't!

I have all the ingredients now and will be trying this recipe out again today as it is written with the exception of still adding extra buttermilk/pumpkin. I am also going to keep the chocolate chips at the recommended 1/2c as increasing them last time made my muffins seem too much like Otis Spunkmeyer (delicious but less healthy). I love the crackled appearance the sprinkled sugar gave the muffin tops---that technique is a keeper!

This was absolutely delicious!  I usually dont care for chocolate muffins.  Most sweet muffins taste like greasy cake to me.  But this was totally different not greasy at all with the perfect amount of sweet!  I made this exactly as the recipes states and it came out perfect.  It also made exactly as many muffins as the recipe states.  Thank you!!!

I absolutely love these muffins!  I made mine with a few changes for personal taste and what I had on hand but I am sure the original is very good too.  I used whole grain white flour for the flour, substituted instant oats for the wheat germ, added another 1 Tbsp of cocoa powder instead of the cinnamon, and used 1 cup of regular sized chocolate morsels instead of 1/2 cup of mini morsels. They are very moist, chewy, and decadent- will definately be making again. Thanks for the recipe!

These were wonderful and filling!  I made them for my daughter's kindergarten class and they all loved them.  The only changes I made was instead of flax seed I substituted wheat bran.  I also used milk with 2 tablespoons vinegar instead of buttermilk (I was out of white milk and used chocolate milk instead!).  My daughter is the pickiest eater and she loved them.

These are great! Just what I was looking for as a substitute for the chocolate muffins at the bakery that my kids love. They are a staple for us now. Have made with substitutions and turned out fine, but best with original recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These are WONDERFUL! I followed the recipe to the letter, except I added two tbsp of vegetable for a bit of unsaturated fat and better texture. They cooked up beautifully with nice round tops (a bit grainy looking, but that's alright). I used a quarter cup of wheat germ and a quarter cup of ground steel-cut oats instead of all wheat germ. The buttermilk and pumpkin make these rich and delicious, and the chocolate chips are just the extra kick of chocolate these need. They don't even need butter-- so yummy!! And secretly healthy! But watch it on how many you eat... my friends call these "regularity" muffins. :p

IF YOU LIKE THE HEALTHY TASTE THEN THESE ARE PERFECT. I ADDED DOUBLE THE CHOCOLATE CHIP IT ASKED BC IT NEEDED IT. I STILL ATE THEM BUT NEXT TIME I WILL TRY ADDED A FRUIT N NUTS FOR MORE FLAVOR.

surprisingly good!  i substituted flax with whole wheat flour and added some extra chocolate chips.  the recipe made about 1.5 dozen, which baked in about 18-20 minutes.  the texture is grittier than a regular chocolate muffin of course, but this is a great substitute when a chocolate crazing hits!  my toddler enjoyed these as well.  next time i'll try mashed banana instead of pumpkin.

My son who doesn't like anything healthy (really!!!), loves these muffins. After making them several times I told him they had healthy ingredients and he still asked me to make them again! I do double the amount of chocolate chips and use raw sugar. Otherwise I make as directed. Fabulous!

Good recipe. Used applesauce instead of pumpkin, omitted the cinnamon, used half the sugar, double the cocoa, a Tbsp of walnut oil, oats instead of wheat germ, and added some splenda. Turned out great for muffins-- not really to be used as a dessert. My kids loved them!!

These were very healthy and tasted good, but not great.  I think the addition of a small amount of salt would make these a 5-star recipe.

I only made one substitution - almond flour for the flax meal, since that's what I had.  These came out great!  Both picky sons and my picky husband say the recipe is a keeper.  I love having healthy breakfast options for them that they will actually eat!

Made without the chocolate chips (didn't have any) and ended up with 13 muffins.  It is dense, but I think the the texture is great. The nutritional benefits are awesome and an easy breakfast/snack.

I have to admit that I was a little nervous making these, but you never know until you try.  I couldn't find flax seed, so I used wheat bran instead.  Everything else I kept the same.  My kids knew that there was something different about them, but the important thing is that when I told them what was in them, they still continued to eat them.  If only all recipes with healthy ingredients could taste this good.

These are some of the best muffins I've made - healthy or otherwise. They were very moist with just the perfect amount of sweetness. The only change I made was replacing the pumpkin with 2 ripe bananas. Mine were done after exactly 22 minutes.

These muffins are wonderful, made them as written with one exception.  I substituted date sugar for 1/2 of the brown sugar.  I can't believe they're healthy.  My 1 1/2 and 4 year olds can't believe I'm letting them eat as many as they like.  Everyone's happy.

I accidentally added a full cup of pumpkin. But it didn't seem to matter. They were nice and moist. This recipe made exactly 36 mini muffins. They were perfect at 15 minutes. I did reduce the flax to 1/2 cup and the cinnamon to only 1 teaspoon. 1 tablespoon would have over-powered these.  I used toasted wheat germ because that is what I had and prefer. These had a nice chocolate flavor and considering how healthy they are, I would probably make these again but maybe add a some instant coffee to intensify the chocolate flavor.  I also made the chocolate muffins from the Fiber One cereal website. The recipes are amazingly similar. In comparing the two side by side, the Fiber One had better chocolate flavor but not as healthy.

I made these this morning....soooooo delicious & moist!  Very chocolatey too!!!  Even my husband likes them! ( I didn't tell him of all the good things in them of course, or I'm sure he wouldn't have liked them ! )  I have put the recipe in our favorites, and will definitely make them again and again!!

This was great.  I did not have any whole wheat flour at the time so I used all white flour, but it still came out great.  They have just the right amount of chocolate to sugar and the wheat germ gives them nice texture.

Great recipe.  A little drier that traditional muffins, so my 2nd batch, I added a 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/8 cup oil.  Also subtituted turbinado sugar for the brown sugar and sprinkled a little on top before baking. I think I will also try adding banana next time since canned pumpkin is scarce right now.

Tasty, but definitely had a different texture.  I am hoping that toasting the wheat germ next time I make these will fix that.  It was kind of like having bits of straw in my muffin!

Really good. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and stevia instead 1 cup brown sugar. Like other reviewers used ground oats instead of wheat germ & 1 cup of mini choc chips. Next time I'll add a mashed banana or some applesauce to make it a little moister. Great healthy snack for my 6yr old (and me.)

Yum!  Very "healthy tasting".  Loved the texture, but that's more of a personal preference.  My daughter loved them and devoured 3.  These will definitely go into our morning rotation!

Wow! These muffins were surprisingly good...I was unsure of how they would taste, with all the strange, healthy ingredients. I didn't tell my family what was in them until they had devoured them all...even the ones who HATE whole wheat with a vengeance really loved these muffins! I did notice that the wheat germ left little "flecks" in the muffin texture that was slightly annoying...it was the only thing that made these muffins seem "healthy." Even so, I consider any recipe that will get all members of my family to enjoy whole grain to be a success...thanks for sharing! I will definitely make these again!!!

Yum yum yum! I love chocolate, so double chocolate? Hey how can you go wrong. But I digress - these were awesome considering they had a lot of healthy ingredients in there. You really can't tell! The wheat germ did seem to give it a bit of a "crunch" here and there but it was good nonetheless! I made mine into mini muffins and adjusted the baking time accordingly. They were the perfect bite sized treats for an afternoon snack. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have everything the recipe called for so I ground some oats for the flax seed, used applesauce instead of the pumpkin, and unsweetened silk and vinegar for the buttermilk.  I think that was it.  Still, these we so good and next time I'll try to be a little more prepared. UPDATE- I used ground flax this time and the muffins were lighter and more tender.  I still used applesauce though.  Next fall I'll fill my freezer with pumpkin just for these muffins.

Okay these are completely fabulous.  They are rich and taste decadent and yet are low in fat and healthy.  I can't wait for my kids to try them, I don't think they'll know they are healthy.  LOL  I'll definitely be making these again and wouldn't mind at all if my kids were eating one every day.  Or me too for that matter!  Yum!
