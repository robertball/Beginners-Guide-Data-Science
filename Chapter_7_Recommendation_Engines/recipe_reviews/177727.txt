I usually wait until someone else tries and reviews a recipe, but since I had all the ingredients we decided to try this one.  It was flavorful.  We don't use Pace so I used a salsa that had a little heat to it and it was nice.  It had a nice crunch which offset the pasta.  It would also be good on rice instead of the noodles.  Both my husband and I gave this one four stars.  We also added parmesan cheese as a topping and we both agreed it made it better.  I will make it again and next time maybe try a few different vegies.

This was wonderful - We took it one step further and added onions, asparagus & zucchini to the mix - we cooked it along with the peppers & mushrooms.  It was wonderful.  I do suggest the medium or hot Picante - we used the mild and it was flavorful but not spicy in any way.

My three son's loved it so much they asked that I pack it for their lunch the next day! Honestly, I had to make substitutes because I didn't have all of the fresh ingredients but it worked. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (instead of fresh tomato) and a small can of canned mushrooms (instead of fresh). To make up for the lack of fresh ingredients, I added a little extra garlic powder and  basil. My family loved it - even with the on-hand substitutes. I also sauteed the shrimp in butter and southwestern seasoning a few days before. So I was actually using the recipe as a way to use up the shrimp. As I said before, it worked! And thankfully my family liked it. I will try it again without the subs!

YUMMY. This was really easy and fast to make. I used penne pasta, a can of mushrooms, frozen shrimp, a bag of frozen tri-peppers and onions and subbed parsley for the basil. The picante sauce I buy is hot, so this was nice and spicy and delish. This would be really good with sausage in it!! Thanks for the great recipe.
