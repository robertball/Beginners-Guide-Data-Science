These flavors went together so well! For my version, I added a bit more sugar and less than half of the oil. I used walnut oil instead of olive oil. Delicious & quick salad took me about 5 minutes to whip together.

Delicious! My family won't eat a thing that has curry in it. No problem, just means more for me! I, too, doubled the curry and sugar.Yum. Makes a great light but satisfying lunch. Thanks BHG!

I adore this salad. It's very easy to make, especially if you buy pre-washed baby spinach. We have nut allergies in the family, so I substitute toasted sunflower seeds instead. Delicious!

I prepared this salad for 20 people at a potluck.  It was wonderful.  I thought the recipe needed a little more flavor so I doubled the amounts of curry and sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp. of thyme leaf.   I toasted my pecans in the oven.  Even the men raved about it.

Yummy!  I added one tablespoon sugar and 1/2 tablespoon curry instead.  The curry is still very subtle.  Wonderful flavor.  Thanks for this easy recipe!
