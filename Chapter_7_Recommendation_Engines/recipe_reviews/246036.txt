The recipe listed is *NOT* cocoa tea.  Cocoa tea is cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove, with milk, and water.  You start with water and the spices, bring to a boil, then add grated cocoa and milk.  To thicken it and make it creamy, add flour.  After served in a cup, add sugar to taste - cocoa is naturally bitter.

I drink tea every morning, so I was glad to find something different using tea...This is definitely different, but I liked it! I used a vanilla flavored black tea, and that added a nice flavor to this. I would make this again. Thanks for sharing. :)
