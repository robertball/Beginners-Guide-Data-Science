This was Delicious !!!! I only had one cup of half-and-half so I used that and one cup of milk. I did not have pesto so I added a teaspoon of dried basil and a little extra garlic.I also used fresh asparagus rather then broccoli. I did not measure the shrimp or asparagus just threw a bunch of both in pan (I used frozen pre-cooked medium shrimp). This was awesome I will definately be making this again (with the asparagus). My husband really liked this and he is very picky - This recipe is great for quick weeknight meals yet also elegant enough to serve company. Thank you so much Robbie for sharing your recipe

"This is a winner"-these were my Husband's words.
I had no Broccoli, so I used pea pods instead.  That is the only change I made. We liked how the hot pepper sauce gave this rich creamy sauce a little kick.

Prepared this for my family last night and it was terrific.  I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream as other's suggested.  I also used snap pea pods which added a nice flavor to the dish.  Highly recommend.

This dish tastes like something you'd eat in a restaurant.  I didn't have pesto, so I added some fresh basil instead.  I also used only 1/2 of the amt. of heavy cream and then added milk, to cut down on some of the fat.  Very tasty, and simple to make.

We loved it!! I followed the recipe exactly (except I used pre-cooked shrimp) and I wouldn't change a thing. My 2 yr old even liked it! I'll definitely add this to my "use often" recipe box and I might also try it with grilled chicken instead of shrimp for an occasional change.

I kept the basic sauce for this recipe, but I added more veggies (mushrooms, baby peas and shallots) and I also devided the shrimp with lobster tails. The basic sauce is very good and hubby cleaned his plate. (also used penne instead of angel hair, only because I like the shape better). Will definately make again...already in the recipe box!

Right amount of pesto. Loved the worcestershire.  Similar to recipe angel hair pasta with garlic and shrimp, but better.

This is a wonderful recipe--no telling what this would cost in a restaurant!!  The first time I made this, I used cooked shrimp--I heated them by putting them in the pasta water for a minute or so, then added to the veggies.  I have also made it with left over chicken breast--diced up--toward the last.  EXCELLENT!!!  Love, love the recipe, but it does dirty up a lot of pans--but well worth it:)

Very good. Instead of pasta I used cheese filled Ravioli; instead of broccoli I had to use what I had... zucchini and yellow squash. Next time I'll use peas because I love the flavor they add this kind of recipe.

My daughter loved it...I did not have parmesan cheese, pesto sauce or hot pepper sauce, but I added basil.  It was delicious and she can't wait until I make it again!

This was not good.  I did modify it slightly.  Used 1 1/2 cups half and half and 1/2 milk.  I don't like pesto, so I used some basil as suggested in another review.  I had about 1 cup of fresh broccoli, so I also threw in some frozen peas.  I was VERY bland.  Could have used a bit more parmesan, but I will not make it again.

This was good, not great, and it was pretty easy, though it took 3 pans. Hubby really liked it, daughter and I were OK+.  Used asparagus, not broccoli, 1/2 tsp hot sauce (left NO HEAT), and added 1/2cup chopped red pepper. Probably will make again with some revisions to make it very good: less garlic, replace 1/2 of 1/2&1/2 with milk to reduce fat, add chopped red pepper, mushrooms & scallions, and will add some seasoning with kick. Then we'll see what happens.

Had some cooked shrimp left over from previous meal. Not liking shrimp that much,  I chose to use a pasta dish. This one was excellent. No major changes other than using half cream, half skim milk to bring down calories. Very tasty sauce - would actually make it again - with shrimp!

Simply delicious!  You don't need to change a thing!  This recipe is fancy enough for company, and is ideal as a fast and easy meal after working all day. The first time I made this I froze the leftovers, but I found that after reheating, too much of the sauce had been absorbed.  If I froze this recipe again, I would keep the pasta and sauce separate until serving.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I couldn't believe that I made it at home and it didn't come from a restaurant!  The only change I made is that I added some chopped onion and mushrooms while sauteing the broccoli - DELICIOUS!!!!!

I liked this recipe although next time I'm going to take a few steps to make this one a little on the healthier side.  I'm definitely going to steam the broccoli and stir fry the shrimp by itself.  With that said, I used a bag of frozen scallops, shrimp, and calamari which I purchased a Trader Joe's... it was excellent.  I would also recommend a thicker pasta as it was a little tough to toss correctly.

Good! I modified, of course.. I used all non-fat milk and it turned out ok, if you like non-fat things. I used frozen shrimp.. turned out fine. I will make it next time with a more bite-sized pasta.. penne?

Great recipe.  My hubby really liked it but we needed to add a little kick to ours.  Added about 1 tsp of red pepper flakes to the sauce while cooking and wow! It really made such a difference.

I have to agree with everyone else.  This is a fabulous dish.  I love spicy food, so I probably put more hotsauce in there than the recipe called for, and it was simply delicious!  

One tip:  If you're going to use frozen shrimp, either thaw them out beforehand or have some good heat going when you do that step.  My frozen shrimp were frozen in big clusters and full of ice (water), so it made a mess and took forever.  Also made the broccoli soggy from cooking too long (my fault though).

Very good...the sauce was perfect, I've made other alfredo based meals before and found the sauce too rich...I also only used half the suggested hot sauce and it was the right amount of spice for me.

A+!!! This is a restaurant quality recipe. I made it EXACTLY as written and we LOVED it. It is okay to experiment with other options but I find it ridiculous when others change the entire recipe and then rate it poorly. People, you are rating THIS recipe not your modified version. Recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks!!

My husband thought the sauce looked "snobby" when he first saw it, but boy, did he gobble it down!  This pasta sauce is absolutely delicious!  I'm pretty picky about giving 5's out, so you know it has to be good.  I did not add shrimp, because we dislike seafood, and the sauce tasted great anyway.  I paired this with the "Chicken with Garlic, Basil and Parsley" recipe from this site, and the meal was a big hit!

This dish was awesome.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I did modify it by using fresh asparagus rather than the broccoli.  I would definitely make it again with the asparagus.
