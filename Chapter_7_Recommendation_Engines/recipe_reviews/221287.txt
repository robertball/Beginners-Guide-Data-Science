This is my recipe, which was posted slightly differently than how it was submitted. A couple tips:

• you know an avocado is ripe when the skin is black, and there's a little "push" when you slightly squeeze it. Too much "push" and it's over-ripe; too little and it's not ready yet.

• the pit will fall out as you're peeling a ripe avocado... if you need a spoon to get it, the avocado's not ready yet.

• to keep the guacamole from turning brown, place plastic wrap directly on top of the finished dish, making sure to eliminate all air contact with the guacamole (it's exposure to the air that will turn it brown). When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and stir the dish with a fork.

• This is ALWAYS best at room temperature.

Made this last night for a party and everyone LOVED it. The only difference that I made was substituting lime juice for lemon, because I had limes on hand and no fresh lemons. I also would recommend keeping the pits in the bowl until it's time to serve so that it doesn't brown!

We tried this recipe with carne asada.  We used cherry tomatoes from the garden which added such flavor.  I used lime juice instead of lemon juice and it was fantastic!

Today is 02/05/2013 and I just made this recipe and realized I forgot the Lemon Juice but it was still great!  I like this version because it is natural, homemade and you can make this sodium free.  Plus, no buy buying the pre-packaged spices.

I made this recipe exactly according to the instructions listed and found the dish to be very, very tasty. It was easy to make, too. It does remind me of the guacamole served in most restaurants. Thank you, ellenmoriah, for submitting it. A new one for my recipe box.

Nice Trabajo!

This is a very good recipe for guacamole. I've never used yellow onion in guac before, and it was fine with it. I think my husband still prefers red onion though. I mixed it up according to the recipe, took my picture and tried it. I had to agree with another reviewer, that the only thing missing in this recipe is the cilantro. I made a half batch and added at least a tablespoon of cilantro. If you don't like cilantro, then you'll be fine with this as written, otherwise, the addition makes it the perfect guacamole for me.

You have to go with your instincts on this recipe as we don't like so much onion. So add ingredients to your discretion and the salt as you like too. I'm not giving the recipe less than 5 stars because we loved the flavor.

This guacamole was very good and got rave reviews at dinner last night.  I followed the recipe except for cutting it in half.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, ellenmoriah!

I made two batches. Recipe is better with half an onion (IMHO). I used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies and a lime rather then a lemon because I had the ingredients.  Simple, easy and yummy.  Can wait to share it tonight at a pot luck with friends! 
P.S. - I'm leaving the pits in the guacamole until I serve the dish.

I thought the hot sauce gave it a "store bought" taste, wouldn't add it again.

I think the amounts of lemon juice , tomato, and onion seem a little high, used a few dashes each of lime and lemon juice and still thought it was too much.

 I used some fresh Pico I'd already made (just tomato, onion, cilantro mixed to my taste) so I'm not sure of the amounts, but I'm sure I used a good amount less than the recipe calls for.

I added fresh minced jalapeno and habanero (1-4 Tablespoons to taste), garlic powder (I didn't measure- but be careful- only 1/2 tsp or so, start with less), and fresh cilantro (already in my Pico.)

Converted my husband - he doesn't like guac but now he does!  Fresh flavors.  5 stars as written.  I make it with either lemon or lime and now add a little cumin.  (For those of you that like cilantro and jalapeno in your guac - add it).

This is not the best guacamole I've ever had, but it is quite good and very easy to remember.  If you prefer the fresh tastes of the avocados and tomatoes to be forefront, this is the recipe for you.  That means the quality of the ingredients can make a big impact.  Farmer's market tomatoes may be the way to go.  I like a little more spice: more salt, garlic and some heat (some cayenne mixed into the lemon juice helps).  The lemon helps slow the browning, another bonus.  I usually half the recipe and keep it in an airtight container for use as a condiment through the week.  Thank you, Ellen!

I thought this was just ok. It didn't have a ton of flavor, and the lemon was quite strong.
