Thanks Curt! This chicken is GREAT! I had to cook it in the oven (400 degrees for one hour) due to rainy weather. I made it the night before my husband's and son's birthday party and we  reheated pieces on the grill, but it's even good cold. Everyone loved it.

This was very easy to make- mix up the marinade, and leave the chicken in the fridge while at work. Despite other reviews, I did not find this too salty. Yes-it does seem like a lot of salt when you see it in the marinade, but after the chicken is cooked, you'll be glad you put it in! Excellent, moist chicken with lots of flavor. I used bone in chicken breast, and baked in the oven. My husband and 2 year old ate this with no complaints!

Too bad there isn't a zero star rating. This is easily the saltiest chicken I have ever eaten. What a waste of perfectly good chicken. Horrible.

I thought this was awful. It may be a little better without all the salt.

I used boneless chicken breasts and completely omitted the salt (we are on a low sodium diet).  I marinated it for 9 hours them baked it in the marinade at 350 for 20 minutes then grilled it to add some color and smoky flavor.  It was moist, juicy and very tasty.  The family loved it and wanted to know what the recipe called for but I did not tell them the secret was Thousand Island dressing (out little secret) ;).  Thanks Curt!

I thought this was great and not too salty. I marinated my chicken parts overnight, then baked in a 400 degree oven for an hour. My 8 year old declared this to be the best chicken ever made!

I was slightly hesitant to try this recipe after seeing some of the negative reviews, but the recipe came out GREAT!!!  For six chicken breast halves, I used: 1 T. lemon juice, 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. pepper, 1 1/2 t. parsley, 1 T. or so pre-minced garlic, 3 T. thousand island dressing, and 1 c. water.  I marinated overnight in a Ziploc bag and baked for 35-40 minutes at 350°.  The original listed salt amount might have been too much, but keep in mind that the original recipe calls for a whole 4 lb. chicken!  This was so easy and had SO MUCH FLAVOR!!  I’m not the kind to have a standard set of recipes that I choose my dinners from (too many new things to cook and eat!!); however, there is a small handful of especially amazing dishes that get repeated in my house and Cassie’s Wishy Chicken has found a spot among them!!

Good but too salty, even though I cut it back to 3 tablespoons.  I skinned my chicken, and the skin may absorb salt (I also used lime instead of lemon and Annie's Green Goddess dressing instead of 1000 island).  Anyway, I will definitely make this super easy and adaptable recipe again, but I'll try it next with 1 tablespoon of salt.

My family loved this chicken.  My one suggestion is to have a drip pan under the bbq.  The next time I used my used my bbq I had a big flare up.  Another great idea for chicken!  Thanks for sharing!

I've never gone wrong with chicken with the help of this site.  Good solid chicken.  However, we're salt conscious so I did cut down on the salt...this was also important b/c I omitted the water.  I simply put the chicken in a gallon bag and filled it with the marinade.

This recipe inspired me. I followed the recipe with these changes: Only 1 tsp of salt (5 tablespoons has to be a typo), I used 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (i didn't have cloves), I added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, and no water. I covered my chicken breast with the sauce and baked it in the oven, covered with foil, at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Delicious!
