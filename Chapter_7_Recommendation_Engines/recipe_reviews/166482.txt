Beautiful, healthy & tasty.  For the dressing, I shake the following together in a medium sized glass jar:  garlic, lime juice, & salt in the amounts as written plus 3/4 c pineapple juice (instead of water), 1-2 T sugar (instead of 2T), 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, & 1 T olive oil. I let the dressing sit for 5-10 minutes to let the flavors mingle, then shake again and pour over the salsa. This would be fantastic in August with fresh, local peaches. Right now I used canned, drained peaches and pineapple (save the juice for the dressing), and it is a great, change-of-pace salsa for chips or with grilled chicken.

I make this all the time and it is definitely time consuming! Recently, I acquired a Ninja system and that has helped cut down on how long I spend chopping. Try to stick with fresh fruit and vegetables if you can! Or if you prefer canned tomatoes, get sodium/HFCS free. Sometimes canned tomatoes can taste... well... tinny. Also, I normally add a load of jalapeno but somehow forgot to put that on the recipe when I posted this. Serrano peppers work equally as well. Sub in a walla wall or vidalia onion for extra natural sweetness. The water is there to simply allow the flavors to all meld together. However, if your produce is really juicy you won't need it. So, you be the judge. If you don't have peaches, nectarines are awesome here!. A lot of people have said that this makes a lot and it does! However, at family functions I use the ENTIRE pineapple and an extra mango with about twice as much cilantro and twice the onion to make enough. It never lasts. Try it on your next fish tacos or blend some with a bit of olive oil and red wine vinegar to make a healthy salad dressing. (Goes great on grilled chicken too and I recently made this as a topping for el pastor).. HELPFUL HINT-- A little extra sugar and a bit of extra salt will up the flavor and help pull the juices out of the fruit if you don't have time to let this sit. Stir it a couple times an hour and press the fruit down into the juice. Seems silly, but it works

There was a LOT of dicing involved in making this. I hadn't noticed that it's set for 16 people. However, it was so YUMMY that even though there were only five of us eating it (one of which usually doesn't even like salsa), it was eaten until both big bags of chips were gone...and people we taking the little crumbs and scooping up what they could, lol. A big hit! :)

Wonderful dish!!! I used canned diced tomatoes, pineapple tidbits and a jalapeno for each batch. We canned it..Boil it for 10 minutes then put in jars..Put in a water bath for 15 minutes. A new favorite in my home!! Thank you.

DELICIOUS! I made this for a bridal shower and all the guests loved it. We are sending a copy in the thank you notes :)  All I added was a little hot sauce to spice it up a bit.

Wonderful salsa! I did take others advice and halved the amount of cilantro and I also only used about 1/2 cup of water because the mangos were very juicy. A lot of chopping but totally worth it!

I agree with the others that mentioned how they disliked the cilantro. This recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH of it. I think it is safe to say that the cilantro ruined what otherwise would have been a really good salsa. This recipe is good enough to make again, but next time I'll definitely keep the cilantro to a bare minimum. I wouldn't get rid of it completely because the cilantro does add flavor and kick to it, but because it is such a strong herb, the MOST I'll add next time is 1/5 cup, probably less.

I put the salsa over some salmon but I liked the salmon better without the salsa. Maybe the excessive amount of cilantro steered me away. It may have otherwise been really good. 

Keep note that this recipe is set to yield 16 servings, which I didn't realize until after I had made it. It makes a lot.

I also added only half an onion and I'm glad I did, especially because I'm not a big fan of using lots of onion. A small amount is okay, but I think a whole onion would have been too much

Tomorrow I plan on making the same recipe (but this time not using any cilantro) and adding it to what I currently have to weaken the intensity of the cilantro.

My advice is that if you're not sure about using the large amounts of a particular food that this recipe calls for (such as onion or cilantro), use only half of what the recipe calls for. See how you like it. If you think it needs more, add more. Be careful because once you add too much, there's no getting it out...

This was a real hit with my party.  I added a cup or so of rinsed/drained black beans from a can.   I first served it over Jerk Chicken breast.  Then I pureed the leftovers in a blender with some more Jalepenos to use with Tortilla chips.

Awesome salsa! Very filling with all the healthy ingredients I followed others advice by:
"For the dressing, I shake the following together in a medium sized glass jar: garlic, lime juice, & salt in the amounts as written plus 3/4 c pineapple juice (instead of water), 1-2 T sugar (instead of 2T), 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, & 1 T olive oil.

This salsa recipe was great, only I tweaked it a touch. I used small or roma tomatoes, so I probably tripled or quadrupled the number of tomatoes, the fruit was so sweet, I probably could have eliminated the sugar, but cut it down to 1Tbs., and I felt it needed a little more spice, so I added 1/4 cup chopped jalepenos from a jar-chopped into tiny pieces; which made it about a medium heat wise. I'm going to try freezing this, would like to can some if anyone has any ideas?

I thought the salsa was great and it was a huge hit in my house hold.  I served it to my family over BBQ chicken.  The chicken was based in a smokey bbq sauce then the salsa poured over it.  The recipe makes a lot of salsa, so I used it the following day as a dressing to a grilled salmon and bleu cheese salad... can you say... AWESOME!

Really great...received rave reviews from both men and women when taken to a gathering of friends over the weekend.  A little dash of cayenne adds a slightly spicy kick that is a nice compliment to the sweet and savory flavour.

Everyone in our family, from my 60 year-old mom to my 6 year-old son, LOVED this salsa. We put it on the Slow Cooker Carnitas last night for supper and it was so good. We weren't sure why the recipe called for water since there was plenty of liquid from the fruits and veggies we had. All in all an excellent recipe for salsa!

I really enjoyed this...I was looking for this exact kind of recipe.  I wanted to grill some teriyaki chicken smother it with cheese (monterey) and this salsa.   It was a great hit.  And the great thing is I have plenty left over for dipping for chips!  The only thing I did different is subsuit the mango for a touch of cantlaup.  I did not have any mango and i really don't care for it.  I also cut back on the bell peppers.  I was afraid it would over power.  Thanks a bunch for this recipe!!

Salsa was great, but I made some changes.  I omitted the peaches, used half the amount of tomato, omitted the sugar and water, but instead used some pineapple juice and about 1/4 cup of lime juice. I also added some black beans and a diced jalepeno.  I served it over grilled fish - fantastic!

I really didn't care for this salsa - it was missing something - It had way too much cilantro - no need to add sugar w/ all that fruit - i'm wondering if it would have been better w/ a little EVOO to cut the acidity a bit without adding sweetness.

All I can say is WOW! This was so yummy! I had a dinner party that was Mexican themed and served this as an appetizer, everyone loved it. It is so quick and easy to make. I was able to make it the day before. I didn't have any peaches but I had strawberries so I made the substitution and it still turned out great. I will be keeping this recipe forever.

Just check the serving size.  I also made the 16 servings.  Had about 20 people at the party and still had PLENTY left over.  It was delicious though!

Superb salsa! I used fresh everything and omitted the water. This is a large batch but it disappears fast - ate it with scallops in the evening, eggs in the morning and chips in the afternoon.

Delicious!!! This is just like the salsa in the jars at those fancy health stores. Better in my opinion! My husband and children love it. Even my husbands coworkers ask for him to bring some in. Lol.  I make this all the time all year. In winter months I use can pineapple & can peaches. Fresh is best but that is a great alternative to a quick homemade salsa. Especially when guest stop in unexpected. If I have any on hand and want to go spicy, I will add a jalapeño and a dash of hot sauce. I do omit the water. Great recipe a keeper in our family!!!!

MMMMMmmmmm!  The only changes I made were adding two jalapeno peppers for some heat, and (accidentally eating the red and yellow bell peppers ahead of time), I substituted two roasted (jarred) red peppers!  It resembled a favorite salsa of mine, the mango/peach salsa from Costco.  It was great!  I ate (a lot of) it on some tortilla chips, and my family ate it on some pork chops.  A little time-consuming, but will definitely make again!  OH!  I didn't add ANY water...the fresh fruit made it's own juice that was WONDERFUL!  It got much more onion-y sitting overnight, which was fine with me since I love onions, but those who don't might want to go easy on the onions.

it was a big hit with my friends...the onions were a bit much as was the cilantro and I omitted the water altogether as the salsa was already soupy enough without it. Also, I had to sub in canned peach halves because they are out of season, but I just made su to Darin them off as best I could and it was fine.

I thought this was okay, it was lacking something flavor wise.  I added some corn also.  I might make it again but with some changes.

I leave out the 3/4c of water and red/yellow bell peppers and add jalapeño and throw all of it in food processor.  It saves lots of time and you still get all the wonderful flavors!   I've made it a few times and the last time I substituted frozen mango and peaches that I let thaw a bit, and it's just as yummy!

We loved it! I made it for my husband over grilled chicken and baked salmon as well and it is delicious! I didn't add any sugar to it, because i thought the sugar from the fruits was enough; nor did I add any water. Also, i added about 2 1/2 serrano chilis to make it spicy and it was perfect! I've made it for several parties and it is gone by the end of the night!

Wow!  Awesome recipe.  I didnt have yellow peppers so I left them out.  The fruit I was using was perfectly ripe, so I didnt use the sugar either, but otherwise I did the recipe exactly as is and it rocks!!!

I wait until peaches are in season to make this.  I have a retirement party this weekend and it will be my first time making it this year.  I buy frozen mangos because I have no idea how to choose one and only eat them from a jar unless I am making this recipe.  Pineapples, tomatoes, and peppers are available year round. This recipe is spot on and fantastic IMHO.  Disappears first thing wherever I take it.

I don't understand how all these people will give this recipe 5 stars and then proceed to tell how they altered it. If you you have to alter the recipe then you obviously didn't like it as written. Be honest and give it the proper rating according to your thoughts. I for one, stuck to the recipe and loved it, thus the 5 stars!

This recipe makes an absolutely delicious salsa! It is good on and with so many things. I used the fruit juice that came from the fruit instead of water as called for, and reduced the cilantro to 1/2 cup. The easiest way to chop everything is by using a Vidalia Onion Chopper" purchased at Bed, Bath & Beyond. By using their 20% off coupon the cost is only $15. This is my favorite kitchen tool and chops way more than just onions! It not only saves time, everything it chops comes out about the same size, so my dishes are more visually appealing. After all, presentation is everything!

Didn't have pineapple but it was still good. I used to hate cilantro but purposely acquired a taste for it because it is so good for you, so now it didn't seem like that much in this recipe. Used extra garlic and no sugar which might not have been a good thing except health-wise.

I loved this recipe and tweaked it for my own satisfaction.  No peppers or onions, no pineapple or water half the amount of tomatoes, twice the amount of peaches and mangos, 2 jalapeños without seeds, orange juice, 1 tbsp of sugar, so delicious!  Served with Tostitos Round Tortilla Chips

Awesome!  I find it hard to stop eating this when I get started!  Very refreshing.  I like to use a red onion and snipped garlic chives for color.  I'm not wild about cilantro so I use dried and much less of it.  I don't find I need to add much sugar or water when the fruits are in season.

We were having trouble finding the mango in season when we went to make this recipe, and the peach I got wasn't ripe enough since we were trying to make it for a party that day, so we just used more pineapple, and it was a hit. It is a very mild sauce, and my husband added some extra spices to make it more spicy for himself. The next time we make it we plan to split it into two batches - a spicy and non-spicy batch.

I did not use garlic or peach. I added lemon juice and vinegar (about 2 Tbs each). I used canned pineapple tidbits with the juice, and canned diced tomato with the juice and omitted the water. Very tasty.

This has got to be my favorite all-time food. I personally don't like to add the garlic. I use all kinds of fruits and vegetables, but try not to use mushy fruits that won't last too long in the salad. A couple of good mangos are a must. This is the most delicious, healthy salad ever. I try to keep one in my refrigerator as often as I can. The only downside is that it takes some time to cut up all the ingredients.  It's definitely worth it!

I made this recipe for our Tuesday Family Dinner/ Game night, and I'll tell you- it was an absolute hit! My father(who is picky about salsa) actually texted me last night and asked if I could make it for the next game night! I followed the recipe, which is a good way to utilize fresh fruit that is getting too ripe, and I added in 1/2 can of tomato paste just to thicken it up a little bit, works like a charm! Definitely use fresh produce, if you can. like I mentioned, I had all the ingredients in my kitchen, and needed to use all of it before it went bad. I read another review that suggested pineapple juice instead of water, which I'll do on the next batch. Thanks for the great recipe!

I would highly recommend this salsa it was amazing and my family loved it. The only thing is it was hard to cut the mango small enough so I had to dice it in a blender. I would have thought the garlic clove might ruin it but it was a welcome surprise to the salsa.

I made this for a salsa competition at work and it won!  I did let them know it wasn't my original recipe and copied it ftom allrecipes.com.  To be honest, this is a time costuming recipe to make, especially cutting up the pineapple and mangos, so next time I'll do a shortcut with canned pineapple tidbits, and already cut-up fresh mango.  I left out the white sugar...it's really not necessary from all the fruit sugars, and I really didn't need to add water.  It was sooo good, I just wanted to eat spoon fulls of this stuff --no chips, no nothing, just salsa.  Just the right amount of sweetness vs heat.

Only needs half the sugar (if any, really) and I would add more heat to compliment the sweetness. Really big hit with all ages.

Loved the different flavors. Used Seasoned Salt instead of regular table salt. I used less cilantro, and wished I'd had more to use.  Didn't need ANY water at all. It produced it's own juice - WAY more than was needed.

This was very good.  A nice change from original tomato salsa.  I used all fresh ingredients and it was a hit.  It makes a large batch so you could probably cut it in half for groups of 8 people or less.

this review is really just for me, so I'll remember what i did. I'm sure it is great just the way it is printed. But what i was looking for at the time, i made these changes.
I only used mango and  peaches. The juice of a 1/2 lime, 1/2 cup sugar. 1/2 jalapeño, about 2 Tbsp of cilantro, 1/2 tsp garlic, and only 1/2 tsp salt.

I liked the recipe but I'm glad I read the reviews first. I cut the amount of cilantro in half, and if I'd thought about it I would have cut the salt in half too. I also only used one tablespoon of sugar. I doubled the pineapple and peaches to make up for the salty taste and that balanced it out nicely. I didn't need water, the juice from the fruit is plenty of liquid. This would be good on a wide variety of grilled meat dishes and also as a dip for chips. I'll definitely be making this often.

Pineapple is one of my favorite foods/flavor, and this salsa didn't disappoint! Using fresh fruits & vegetables makes this incredibly nutritious & delicious! ... After reading all the comments, I omitted the water and sugar and it was sweet & juicy as is.... Tried it w/chicken today and will serve it tomorrow as a side dish. Thanks for sharing!

I made it for a party and my guest loved it! Its a great summertime salsa. Its real light and super fresh. However I replaced the water with pineapple juice. Added extra salt and a few pickled jalapeños. The jalapeños didnt make it so spicy it was more of a flavor. Other wise, it was a hit

Loved it! All my coworkers (18) loved it too. I did not put as much onion as stated, felt a whole onion would be a little over powering. But every thing else was the same. Thanks for sharing this fresh salsa. I did have a thought that we may try adding a splash of hot sauce for a little zing next time.

I served this up with rice made in the rice cooker with coconut milk instead of water and chicken breast marinated in a sweet bourbon marinade. The combination was amazing! Perfect for a hot summer day (94 and humid)! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Mixed up a batch and it is in the fridge chilling.  Can't wait to try it. I like my salsa extra spicy, so I added a seeded and minced jalapeno to the mix. Also left out the sugar, as I am diabetic, and it was already plenty sweet for my taste.

Not bad. I left out the sugar (I am a diabetic) and I left out the cilantro (hate it with a passion). I used a red onion instead of a white. Good on top of cooked salmon (or any other fish). I also left out the salt when mixing it and salted it to taste after it was mixed and melded in the fridge (I don't normally use salt so just adding it blindly usually makes things too salty for me).
