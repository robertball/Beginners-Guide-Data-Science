Just made this! I made a few changes: I sauteed the onion, and and added some minced garlic too. I put a couple dashes of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, and put the loaves in a muffin tin :) I'm really, really happy with the results! The only problem I had was that I put a little too much of the sauce on top of the first tin load, so there wasn't enough for all of them. But they taste amaaaaaazing!!

So good...I always double it, so I put them on a baking sheet to cook. I would make them and freeze single ones in little containers for my widowed, elderly Mom to just thaw and warm.  She loved them.  She would also slice one and make a sandwich.

These are delicious meatloaves.  I must admit, however, that I've made them numerous times using another recipe on this site that uses the same ingredients with a little less sugar in the topping.  These are really delicious and easy to put together.  Thanks for the recipe!

Even my ground meat adverse kids love this meatloaf/meatball hybrid.  Our variation is to omit the onion; soak the oatmeal in milk for about an hour before adding to the meat; omit the mustard powder from the sauce and replace with about 1 Tbsp of steak sauce or oyster sauce.  Sometimes I make this with 1-1/4 pounds of meat and it still works.  I serve with brown rice and steamed broccoli.  One of the few meals that my entire family will eat without complaint.  These  just melt in your mouth!

This was a great meatloaf!  I wanted to make sure the sauce stuck so I added half at the beginning then half about 10 minutes before it was done.  It was so good and sweet!  Made some changes for my Paleo diet though, no oats, used almond meal.  Then for the brown sugar used 1/4 cup coconut sugar and 1/4 cup honey...worked nicely!  Ate it all up :)

I like the addition of oatmeal, that's new to me.  Here in Holland we use bread soaked in milk or breadcrumps.
I also added some garlic and thyme and a very tiny bit of clove which works wonderfull with beef.
I NEVER  use Sugar, there's already a large amount of it in the ketchup.
Everything in the western world, from sauces, drinks, prepacked meat or fish, the first thing you taste is Sugar..! 
Leave it out and enjoy the pure taste of the beef in the meat loaves.

This recipe is now a staple in my house.  So easy and my family loves them.  Rather than shape small loaves, I put the mixture in large muffin tins.  Makes 6 perfect portions.

This was published in Taste of Home as "L'il Cheddar Meat Loaves" in 1999 & is always a favorite at our house. It is an easy go to recipe since I always have these ingredients on hand.

My new go to meatloaf recipe! I doubled the recipe and made in traditional loaf pans because it was easier for feeding a bigger group. I accidentally added the ketchup , and dry mustard to the meat mixture...didn't read the recipe all the way through first... I thought it would be a mistake but it actually turned out great. The only substitution I made was in place of the brown sugar, I added a 1/4 cup of real maple syrup- I just usually use that or honey instead of sugar in most recipes.  I mixed a little  ketchup, mustard and maple syrup to glaze the top and baked at 375 for about an hour and a half. Turned out amazing:)!

Love this recipe!  Have used it for several years. Only thing I do different it omit the ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar. Instead I make a small divot in the top and add my favorite  barbecue sauce.

This recipe was delicious.  I did cut back on the brown sugar to make it less sweet, and my family absolutely loved it.

Found this a little sweet for our taste, but it's still a solid meatloaf recipe, although is very similar to another on this site. I like the idea of mini loaves. thanks stellaaa

Iit is moist and relatively light; however, the portion size is not realistic, at all. You can't feed 10 people with 1 lb of ground beef unless you are making a party dish. That said, I did not add the cheese and I am sure this would be 5 stars with that included. I don't, however, prefer to make food loaded with unnecessary fat and calories.  So, I try to make minor adjustments when I can. Next time, I may try adding some freshly grated parmesan cheese instead, and reducing the salt to make up for the saltier parmesan (and bc a little parmesan cheese goes a long way for flavor).
Unless the cheese adds that much flavor, I wondered if these would be bland without adding some seasoning or onions. Therefore, I took the advice of others and sauteed some onion, added some Italian seasoning, fresh cracked black pepper, and added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce. Also, I used regular, old fashioned oatmeal and let it soak in the milk for an hour, and did not taste the oatmeal whatsoever. I doubled the meat (used 1/2 chuck and 1/2 sirloin), 1 cup skim milk, and only 1 egg bc some said it was too wet. I thought mine was the perfect consistency with my changes. I formed it into 6 mini loaves and baked on a sheet pan. For the topping, I reduced the quantities a bit based on some comments, but I think it is personal preference of how sweet or savory you like it. I used 1/2 cup ketchup, 2 tbsp light brown sugar, and about 1- 1 1/2 tsp dijon mustard ins

The actual meatloaf was fine. I substituted Italian flavored breadcrumbs for the oatmeal. The sauce for the topping however proved to be too sweet. I'd reduce the amount of sugar by at least half and the amount of topping used by the same. I will try again.

This recipe is awesome and very easy. It is very flexible if you want to change the meat option to part gr turkey or a meatloaf mix. I get raves each time I have made it. I have also just made it as a whole meatloaf. It freezes well.

This is our favorite meatloaf recipe. I've been making it for years and it is so delicious. I usually double the recipe and and sub one pound of pork for one pound of beef. I also add bell pepper, and use prepared mustard instead of powdered.

Delicious! Held to the recipe except I added a few teaspoons of minced garlic, a couple dashes of soy sauce and some pepper.   The whole family loved it.  I’ll never make meatloaf any other way!

I used half the sugar, light old cheddar, a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I did, however, use muffin tins and I got 10 muffin sized loaves.  I believe this recipe serves 5. I liked it but found it a bit too moist. I might cut the milk back a bit next time.

ok, so I was totally skeptical about oats in meatballs but it  works incredibly. Here's what I changed. 1) add a pinch of cumin 2) small splash of Worcestershire sauce 3) decreased the topping measurements. 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 tbsp brown mustard (didnt have mustard powder) and maybe 1/4c ketchup. Then I used a muffin  tin for about 25mins. I ended up with a dz absolutely delicious mini meatloafs.

Excellent started recipe. Great foundation. I modified by adding a packet of French onion soup, green peppers, and japaleno peppers. I baked in mini bread pans making each loaf about 1/4 pound. Reduced amount of sugar in sauce and added Worcestershire  to it as well as to meat mixture.

This recipe is so easy and so good!  I made it the first time following the recipe exactly and it was good but I tweaked it a little the next time. I usse 1tablespoon onion powder instead of onion. I also added about 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg to the sauce and used only 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. I baked 45 minutes then remove each meatloaf to drain on paper towels before serving.  I make these often!

Easy to make.   I cooked it in an oversize muffin tin.  I used a thermometer for temp which is good because I only needed to cook it for 30 minutes.

My family loved this. I only put the glaze on half of the meatloaves, and they didn't choose to eat those. Just us I guess.

Delicious! I was out of onions so I substituted half a packet of onion soup mix instead. I also substituted barbecue sauce for the top, just because I had some to use up. Instead of shredding the cheese I cut it into cubes & put in the middle. We had some silicone cupcake liners (muffin size) so I used these for ease of cleanup. They worked great! We got 6 muffin sized servings. My husband said to put this on the regular rotation! Easy & delicious!!!

My family enjoyed the mini meat loaves, however, I thought the sauce was too sweet.  The next time I make it, I will cut back on the sugar.

I made this for 90 men at a shelter.  I baked them ahead and froze them, reheating them at serving time.  The men loved them, several having more than one.  This is great for large groups!

This turned out quite nice.  I didn't have any brown sugar so I used honey instead for the topping and it worked fine.  One thing though, 1 pound of mince just yielded 3 1/2 mini meat loafs.  Maybe my portions are big :-S

Definitely make it again.  It is a nice way to portion meatloaf and you don't have to worry about getting out of the pan and sliced.

A really good meatloaf base to use. My hubby loved it! I used the recipe mostly as stated on  the ratios.  My changes were that as I used italian bread crumbs instead of oatmeal and I cooked the onion before adding it in.  For the sauce, I added 2 tbsp of liquid beef boullion & some worcestershire sauce to the mixture which made it more savoury & smokey than sweet.   I didn't make them mini, just one meatloaf and it turned out fantastic!  Will make again for sure. Thanks for the great recipe!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars for simplicity and taste! Followed recipe exactly . Divided mixture into two "loaves" and baked at 350 for about 40 minutes.  Meat loaf was tender, juicy and flavorful!  Served with steamed broccoli and cauliflower mashed potatoes! Will definitely make again.

It was great.  I followed it to the T.  My husband is the worlds fussiest eater and he liked it.   Perfect recipe.  Next time I make it I'm going to have company over, it's that good.
