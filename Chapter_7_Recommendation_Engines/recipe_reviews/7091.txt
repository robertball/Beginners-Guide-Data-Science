I liked it, but was a little bland. I'm going to try with more cin. & sugar.  It does make a nice toast.

This is soooooooooo good!  The whole house smelled like a cinnamon roll while it baked.  For me the texture was wonderful and soft.  My daughter loved it too!  I heartily recommend this recipe.

This is good bread.  We like cinnamon toast, so this was great toasted, buttered, and sprinkled with sugar.  It was also good just to eat with a meal.

A few additions, as per other reviewers, and one of my own made this one of the best breads on the planet.  I added 1 extra tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 c sugar, and 3 tbsp golden raisins (that's all I had left) near the end of the kneading cycle of my breadmaker.  In addition, I threw in 1 whole large egg right on top of the flour before starting the dough cycle.  When the timer went off (1.5 hours later) I lifted the lid to find that hte dough had almost climbed out and was extremely moist.  I dumped the whole thing out on my well floured kneading surface and patted it around until it was covered in flour and would not stick to anything.  Halfed the dough, rolled it out and smeared on 1 tbsp butter, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp sugar to each half of the dough.  Rolled up and let rise for about 20 minutes before baking in a 350 degree oven for 15.  PERFECT! Delicious and moist.  Way better than that over priced dried up crud readily purchased at the store AND I can make it and store it in my freezer.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you ever so much!

I used only whole wheat flour, and I subbed honey for the sugar.  Great tasting bread, wonderful for tomato sandwiches!

Ehh...I wasn't impressed with this bread at all. It was edible, but not something I'd make again. Like the other reviewers, I thought it needed to be sweeter.

I used these ingredients: 1 1/8 cups of water at room temperature
2 tbs margarine or butter
2 tbs sugar
1 tsp salt
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup AP flour
2 1/2 tsp yeast
1 1/2 tbs cinnamon

It tastes great warm out of the bread maker!

I doubled the cinnamon and sugar, but it was still on the bland side. Can't add too much cinnamon though, because cinnamon will inhibit the yeast. The texture was perfect. Crust was soft. It's wonderful toasted with butter. I will try it again with a little tweaking. It's a very good basic recipe though.

It was good!  After reading the other reviews I decided to put a heaping 1/2 cup of sugar, reduce flour by 1/4 cup, and put a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon.  Cinnamon bread makes the best french toast too!  (Oh yeah....no raisins for us!)

just made this and it is wonderful and just what hubby and son asked for. It just came out of bread machine and it's half gone already. I followed the recipe exactly and used bread machine yeast. This is a perfect bread for us. They were bored with the plain bread recipe and wanted something a little more.  This is THE bread recipe from now one.

After reading the reviews that said this bread wasn't quite sweet enough on its own, I changed some things, and I thought it was a wonderful loaf!  For one, I used a lot more cinnamon than it called for (I didn't measure, though, so I don't know how much).  I also used the 1/4c sugar AND 1/4c Splenda to make it a bit sweeter.  I used applesauce (unsweetened) instead of the margarine.  GREAT texture, wonderful aroma and flavor.  I will definitely make this again :)

At the suggestion of other users I went ahead and added extra sugar and cinnamon, but it made little difference. It was so bland. I ended up slicing up the rest of the loaf and buttered each piece and sprinkled brown sugar on them and then toasted in the oven. That was yummy so not a complete loss.

This is pretty good bread with a few mods.  I took advice from others and added extra cinnamon (boosted it up to 1 tablespoon) and instead of sugar I added about 1/4 cup of honey and used quick rise yeast instead of regular.  I use the 'sweet' setting on the machine with a medium crust.  Few hours later, yum yum..

I added the extra cinnamon that so many raters said helped and the extra sugar..it was still NOT that great. Perhaps would be better as french toast or sandwich bread as other have stated. I just tried with some butter and was NOT impressed. Still looking for a recipe :/

Update: I cooked the bread a little longer (250 degree oven) than my bread machine did and the consistency was much better. For this reason I change my 2 star to a 3 star.

I thought it was very good. I love cinnamon so I put 2 tsp's in. I made it twice and found it made a difference with real butter the second time and my whole family just loved it and everyone wanted to make it.. It's become a weekly recipe in our house...Thank you so much for sharing this recipe...(((smiles)))

I didn't have any raisens and they were definitely missed.  I used butter and extra 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and added 1/16 cup of light brown sugar.  It was good toasted w/ butter, but otherwise, it seemed to be missing something, maybe just the raisens....????

I was surprised at how sticky the dough was, and was convinced that it was going to work, but I was pretty happy with the result. The cinnamon smelled much stronger than it tasted; so I will try what others suggest next time and add more (although I don't think more sugar is needed).

This was wonderful breakfast bread - perfect with a dollop of butter.  However, as recommended by other reviewers, I added more sugar and more cinnamon to up the flavor.

It really was just ok. However, my husband liked it.  I follow other users suggestions of increasing the sugar & cinnamon so I actually doubled it. I probably would make this again since my husband liked it.

Very good bread. Not too overly sweet or sugary, just right. I baked small 3 inch rolls and ended up having a bunch of people over after baking this and I ended up only eating one roll, but that should just show how good they are. They're nice and dense but still fluffy. Overall a successful recipe.

This bread was great but should go with something instead of eaten alone.  (I didn't read any reviews or suggestions before making it.) Also for my machine the loaf was too big. Next time I make it I will alter the recipe a bit and split the dough into 2.

We love this bread! I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead though and used quite a bit more cinnamon. I didn't measure it but it was probably a couple tablespoons. We ate half of it as soon as it was done and it was so yummy. I want to try it as french toast too, I think it will be really good.

I clearly added more cinnamon and sugar because I like the two ingredients. I needed to add a little bit more flour as well. I soaked the raisins in hot water for a little while before I added them to the bread machine. I also added a little bit of pure vanilla extract. On the sweet setting it did not rise or bake thoroughly. So I had to place it on bake setting afterwards in order to completely bake it.

Very tasty recipe with a few modifications.  I took several other comments on the recipe to heart saying that it needed more sugar and cinnamon.  So I doubled the cinnamon and sugar amounts.  I also soaked the raisins in a small amount of Capt. Morgan's Spiced Rum for an hour or so and added the raisins and rum to the recipe at the right time.

I added 2tsp. cinnamon, then added 1/3 cup of sugar instead. It went over the top of machine pan. Made a better bread. This is good bread for cinnamon french toast, with vanilla in the egg batter!! My kids loved it!!

An absolutely lovely cinnamon bread!  It isn't sweet like commercial cinnamon breads, but rather heavenly fragrant.  Excellent toasted with butter.  Works equally well for breakfast as with soups for supper.

variations:
Based on the comments of the other reviewers, I also added an extra tsp of cinnamon.

I only used 2 1/4 tsp of yeast. This is the exact recipe in my breadmaker book (with less yeast). I did the time delay so I didn't put in the raisins.

This was my first attempt at breadmaking, and it turned out great! We don't have a sweet setting, so I used rapid, and it turned out fine. I did double the cinnamon and add more sugar, as suggested. It's particularly good toasted with butter. In future though I would leave out the raisins, as I'm just not a big fan of raisins, and my son just picked them out anyway. I think the cinnamon could stand on its own.

I'm giving this recipe three stars because it makes great bread, but I think something in the recipe is flawed. As has happened to other reviewers, my bread rose far above what it was supposed to, almost to the point of coming out of the steam vent. When the sweet bread cycle finished, it was apparent that the center was still uncooked. My machine has a "bake only" cycle so I let it bake for another 30 minutes. This was the key. The bread came out cooked through and tasty. However, because of the previous near dough explosion, it was an ugly loaf that tore coming out of the pan. I think next time, I would decrease the yeast.

This bread is delicious!!!  In fact, I have to make another loaf for my father-in-law because we've all been raving about it!  It was a little "doughy"-tasting plain, but with melted butter on it, it was awesome!  My one glitch is that I forgot to add in the raisins, so I folded them in at the end just before baking, which didn't really work (some got very swollen and burnt in baking).  I intend to do it the "right" way next time around!

great breakfast bread.  I replaced 3/4 cup of flour with almond flour.  I threw in all ingredients the night before and the raisins chopped up, but kept the bread very moist and with a good flavor.  will make again.  thanks.

Mmmmmm - this smelled heavenly as it baked.  My bread machine doesn't have a "sweet" bread cycle, so I used the regular - but "quick" cycle and it turned out fine.  It did rise up almost to the top of the machine.  I used it to make a french toast casserole.

Yuck...this bread did not come out well at all.  The dough rose so high that it spilled out of the bucket of my machine and was gooey in the middle.  The little bit that did cook didnt even taste good even though I doubled the cinnamon as suggested.  Oh well...

This was my first bread machine loaf. Even though the center crust bubbled and collapsed while baking, I still liked the outcome---a soft, but dense cinnamon-flavored bread. This would go well smeared with butter/jam or made into French toast. If I were to eat it on its own, then I'd try to make it sweeter. (I did use 2 TSP cinnamon like the others.) Stored in a Ziplock bag, the bread stayed soft for a few days.

This is really yummy!  My family ate it right out of the bread machine; didn't even need to be toasted.  Perfectly sweetened.

This recipe is excellent! It tastes great! I did like the others and added 2 tsp. cinnamon. The more cinnamon the better!

I made this bread this morning, I followed the advise if other reviews and added an extra tsp of cinnamon...It turned out alright, it tasted great but seemed to fall apart...never had that problem before...but it still tasted really well!

Good morning bread.  Tastes better with butter.  I'll add more cinnamon next time.

Great bread for French toast!  It is certainly not a sweet bread, but the recipe never claimed to be.  It is a nice, plain bread with a little hint of  flavour.  We loved it!

Instead of  1 teaspoon of cinnamon I use 2 teaspoons also I used 1 2/3 cup of sugar.

This was so delicious! I added a little more sugar and tad more cinnamon like some people suggested. It was  perfect! Light and fluffy and perfect for making toast in the morning for breakfast.  I will be making this one again.

This was the best bread I have EVER made.  I substituted 1/2 c. brown sugar for the white and increased the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon.  I also added 1 c. of raisins.  I can't praise this bread enough.  It was fantastic!!!

The taste was a bit bland, and it fell in my machine.  The dough turned out more like a batter.

This turns out soft, but the cinnamon taste wasn't quite as strong as I would have liked. Next time I'll add a little more. All in all, though, I liked it, and I think it would be really good toasted.

My Family loves homemade breads,but this bread is one of a kind. I always add more cinnamon to everything I cook so that was not a big deal for me..
