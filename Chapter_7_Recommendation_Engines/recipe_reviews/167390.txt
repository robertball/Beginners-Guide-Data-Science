I am only giving this 1 star because of the overpowering lemon taste that the fish had.  It literally made my lips pucker.  My 11 year old daughter, who has a taste for strange foods, thought it was just right, so I guess if you like fish that tastes like LEMON, you might like it.  I had 2 1/4 lb. of catfish filets and used the juice of 5 lemons.  I did let the fish marinate a full 4 hours, but didn't put lemon slices on top.  If I make this again, I will just squeeze 1 lemon over the fish and let it marinate for 1 hour.  Using this method, I would predict this would be a 4 or 5 star recipe.  I didn't have lemon pepper or Creole seasoning so I used regular pepper, Mrs. Dash, garlic salt, paprika, parsley and a little red pepper.  I did have to broil it for more like 30 minutes, but my filets were pretty thick.

This is a good recipe for lemon pepper catfish.  I suggest using thin fillets and broiling them until slightly blackened.  I marinated for about an hour and will increase to two hours for a slightly stronger lemon flavor.

Way, WAY over seasoned.  The flavor was good (kind of an "everything but the kitchen sink" approach when it comes to seasoning...) but wow.  Just way too seasoning for that amount of fish.  The cooking method was great and the fish turned out well.  Using about 1/3 of the amount of seasoning called for would greatly improve this recipe.  Also, I left out the lemon peel and lemon slices and between the lemon pepper and lemon juice this was MORE than lemony enough- I'd recommend leaving them out as I did.

I loveddd it but I made some changes. I used lime because I didnâ€™t have any lemons also used garlic and Mrs. Dash. I let it sit for about an hour and a half and put it in a pan with the juice and it turned out amazing. Thank you for the recipe.

Very strong lemon flavor. In my opinion it does not need the lemon juice marination.

Definately over seasoned so I omitted a lot and just used lemon juice, sea salt, garlic, pepper, & TARRAGON. Marinated for an hour and a half and grilled on the BBQ with a mat. The flavor was awesome.

Reduce salt and use a non-garlic salt garlic-herb powder.  Otherwise good and will make again.

I duno, didn't really care for this maybe it was the catfish I used, or not even marinade time. May try it again in the future but no one in my family liked it.

It was beyond over-seasoned.

but the marinate was good enough with simple fresh garlic, thyme, cayenne and paprika was all it needed and garnished with freshly chopped green onions. All the other seasoning seemed overpowering and high in sodium. The general idea makes for a great meal. Loved it.
