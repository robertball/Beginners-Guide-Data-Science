This recipe was really good, when the cookies got out of the oven I put wooden sticks in them. When melting the caramel and dipping the cookie in the caramel the cookies slid of the stick, I had really bad difficulty getting the caramel on the cookies, rolling them in the pecans didn't work out so well. I managed to get them all done but it was not the easiest thing in the world, It definitely takes some patience.
