Awesome recipe. Doubled the recipe and added honey nut cherrios instead of rice crispies. I would definately use it again.

These cookies had a great flavor but the cereal makes these a little more chewy than I would like and they were also very crumbly and kept falling apart. I did substitute half of the white sugar for brown sugar and also added a half tsp of vanilla to give a little more depth to the flavor. I probably wont make this again.
