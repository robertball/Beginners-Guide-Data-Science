1.22.18  Answering question for last reviewer Cheryl:  This recipe was submitted with specific instructions for an Instant Pot, but Allrecipes edited it, so it could be used in all multi-cookers/pressure cookers.  So just follow the instructions/timing in the recipe *********** 9.2.17 I'm the submitter of this recipe, and the size of the onion was deleted when published.  FYI it should be a medium-sized onion.

This was an excellent meal Will surely make this over and over again. Instead of dry navy beans (didn't have at the time)I used the 15 Bean Soup. I did not use the seasoning packet that comes with the beans. I also added 4 cloves of garlic, minced.  What a great flavor.  A must make! Don't forget the corn bread.

Unbelievable recipe! This was my first recipe using my new Instant Pot. I was dubious about using dry beans, but really, they cook perfectly in the IP. I guess it's time to get rid of my Grandma's bean pot! The only change that we made was to add a few splashes of Worchestire sauce as we are nuts about it. Fabulous! Thanks for the great recipe!

I am a new owner of an instant pot. This is the second thing that I have made. My husband and I loved this soup, lots of flavor and easy to make. This soup is even better the next day.

Great soup!  The flavor was great.  I was skeptical of the pork and beans but Now, I will continue to do that.  I LOVE the consistency  and I was surprised how well seasoned it was.
I used an extra carrot and an extra stalk of celery just because we love them.  I think, next time, I will add in even more carrots because my husband can never get enough of them

An easy soup that had ham which my husband loved. I was getting in a rut making the same old thing. This soup was a delightful change and was so good on a cold day.

I just made this in my new Instant Pot.  I did everything exactly as specified in the recipe.  The Pork and Beans did indeed add a unique flavor to the soup.  And I bought the celery, onions and carrots pre-chopped so prep time was nil!  I will definitely make this again

9/19/17:  This was so easy to make, and it literally took about 5 minutes to throw everything into the InstantPot®! Great for a weeknight meal. I loved the addition of the can of pork and beans. Gave it a slightly sweet flavor. Will make again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really good soup and loved the flavor.  I would add a little extra broth next time since it came out really thick for me.

This soup is so simple but with a great flavor. I omitted adding the pork and beans can as my family doesn’t like sweet soups and the it was still delicious. So good for this cold weather.

My family loved it.  Since it was my first time ever cooking with dried beans I followed the recipe, other than increasing the spices.  This was a first for me in my new instant pot. I did 40 minutes because I didn't pre-soak.  It turned out perfectly!

Wow, this was so easy and delicious.  My husband and son demanded heaping bowls of seconds :-).  Only change was to omit the ham and use a 17 oz container of chopped tomatoes which is what I had on hand.

I didn't have canned tomatoes, so I used one 6 ounce can of tomato paste adn 8 ounces of water to replace. It was delicious right out of the pot -- I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow.

If you LOVE beans this is the soup for you.

Unfortunately for me I found the ratio of beans to soup to be more than 1:1, each spoonful is an endless sea of bean.

Next time I'm making this I'm cutting beans down to 1 cup and possibly doubling broth, ham, and vegetables.

This was actually quite good and extremely simple to make. I followed it almost exactly with exception of the diced tomatoes which doesn't interest me. It turned out fantastic and goes in my keeper column.

Extremely tasty! We live at altitude (6250’), so I checked Google and found that we needed to increase the cooking time by 20%, which meant 54 minutes instead of 45. I rounded it to 60 minutes and the beans were not done. Re-pressurized and went for another 15 minutes and it was close to perfect. We’ll probably just cook it for 90 minutes in the future. We did heat the ham and pork and beans prior to adding at the end. And my wife thinks adding another carrot and celery stalk would benefit the recipe as well!  One other suggestion!  Corn bread is a perfect accompaniment, and we tried, for the first time, Famous Dave’s Cornbread mix! You do have to add milk and an egg, but man, it is some of the best we’ve had out of a box!

Thanks, lutzflcat, for this super simple and super delicious recipe! Except for the fact that I made a double batch (with room to spare in the 8qt IP, by the way), I followed the ingredients and directions to the letter. It came out wonderfully. I think the ham you use is going to matter. Get a good hunk of real baked ham, not the little pre-cubed, processed stuff. A mug of this soup with salad and crusty rolls was perfect for a chilly autumn evening!

Excellent we used 1 1/2 cups of Black Forest Ham and a half of a large red onion were the only changes we made. Corn bread would have been nice. I did a quick pressure release after a 30 minute natural release. Turned out perfect.

Not sure why so many people rated this so high. For me, the beans never got soft. I increased the time to an hour but that didn't help. I finally poured the contents into my Dutch oven to finish off. Will not repeat.

Mom made a big pot of Navy Beans once a month. So, first thing to make with Instant Pot.  Did add a 1/4 cup of Worcestershire  Sauce.

This was very good. My family loved it. I did add some extra minced dried onion flakes, and some dry mustard. Delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I never would have thought of adding a can of baked beans....but it worked.

This was delicious!  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly.  Reminded me of my favorite childhood soup only so much better!

Easy and delicious.  I used a ham bone and added a little chopped jalapeno.

This turned out very bland. Next time I would add a bunch of garlic and some other seasonings. I ended up adding cumin and garlic powder, along with salt and pepper, to salvage my finished soup. It's a good base, it just needs more pizzazz.

Absolutely delicious! This was the first recipe I made in our new Insta Pot. Followed the recipe with no additions. Used the Soup setting, increasing time to 45 minutes. After it was done cooking and pressure released, turned the setting to sauté, added the cubed ham and pork & beans to the soup, then sautéed (without lid) for ~ 5 minutes to ensure they were heated thoroughly. 
Served with fresh-out-of-the-oven corn muffins made from a box mix (Buff Goldman’s Sweeter than Honey Cornbread and Muffin Mix, which was excellent!).  
We were both very impressed with the soup. Great flavor and super easy to make. It will definitely be on this winter’s comfort food rotation.

I followed the directions, but this turned out more like "beans" than "ham and bean soup". Kinda just tasted like pork and beans since no other seasonings were added beyond salt and pepper. I would have preferred less beans and more veggies.

This is really the first recipe I made in my new Instant Pot. I chose this recipe because it looked fairly easy. I liked that you didn't have to pre-soak the beans before putting in the pot. I forgot to buy a can of diced tomatoes so I cut up a small tomato and added a few tablespoons of spaghetti sauce. I also added a few spices. I let it cook for nearly 2 hours just to make sure the beans were nice and soft. Other than I made no major modifications.
