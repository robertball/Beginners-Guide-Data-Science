I made this with the following modifications:
1.  I seasoned the meat with pepper, salt and red wine, browned it, added the onions and some garlic, added beef broth here, and then let it cook on low for about 45 min or until very tender.
2. I used 1/2 baby bella mushrooms and 1/2 white mushrooms. 
3. I cooked my egg noodles with some beef broth added to the water. 

It turned out great!

We loved it.  The only thing I did different is use the Roasted Garlic cooking Creme instead of Original  and stirred the noodles right in the pan at the end both of which I would highly recommend.

I made this as written. It was very easy/quick and very good. Excellent for a weeknight meal. I would make it again. 
For those whose meat was tough: cook your steak to rare-medium rare. The longer your cook the meat, the tougher it will become.

Delicious!  I boiled the noodles in beef broth then added the cooked noodles to the skillet at the end.  My husband and I enjoyed it very much.

This was better than I thought it might be. After adding the Cooking Cream, I thought it would come out with too much of a cream cheese taste but it was nice.  I omitted the onions, because I don't like them, used canned mushrooms, and used more noodles and beef broth than the recipe called for.  Over all a very good dish and I will make again.

The flavor of this recipe was very good, but the beef came out really tough.

This was pretty good. Next time I make it I think I will use the Italian Cheese and Garlic or whatever it is though. It was good though. I also added some cloves of minced garlic to it. Mmm-mmm-mmm. Was good.

Yummy, but then put cream cheese on anything and it is yummy.  :)  I didn't have plain cream cheese so I used the garden vegetable one and it made it super tasty.

I only made one change to this recipe.  I cooked the steak on the medium side, instead of all the way through, since I knew it would cook more once added it back to the sauce for another 5 minutes.  The meat turned out very tender, so I'm glad I went that route.  Other than that, I followed it exactly and it was very good.  I will definitely be making this again.

Not bad, but not great either. I think I am just not a fan of the cooking creme...

Good and easy. Tweaked it a bit by using ground beef and left out the mushrooms. Family was happy.

This was a delicious quick meal.  The family loved it.  I changed it slightly by using beef tenderloin cut into strips and 1 tub of philadelphia garlic herb cooking cream and it turned out wonderful. I also liked that it was made in less than 30 minutes.  Family voted it as a "repeat" dish.

Tasty, easy, and fast. Like another who posted, I used the garlic flavored cream cheese. I also added a little more plain old cream cheese. Make sure you get a high quality sirloin if you want the meat to be tender.

The only thing I did different is use the Roasted Garlic cooking Creme instead of Original and I seasoned the meat/onions with Montreal Steak Seasoning, Pepper, Garlic Salt, and Lemon Pepper. I cooked more noodles as well.

This was excellent! I prepared it exactly as written. I really like the cooking creme, all the different flavors. They make preparing meals so easy.
