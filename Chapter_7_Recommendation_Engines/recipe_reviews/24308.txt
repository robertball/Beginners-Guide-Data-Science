This cheesecake turned out great!  The changes I made was to add one cup of eggnog & an extra tablespoon of rum.  I also added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust.  I wrapped the bottom of the springform pan with foil and baked it in a water-filled cookie pan.  I baked it for the time specified and it came out perfect with no cracks.  I followed what someone else said and I beat 1 cup whipping cream with 3 T powdered sugar and then I added 1 tsp. rum extract & 1 tsp. cinnamon.  It really added to the eggnog flavor.  Also, I microwaved the cream cheese and eggnog just until it was at room temp. and I mixed everything with my kitchenaid stand mixer and this worked very well.  I'll definitely be making this every year for the holidays!

This cheesecake is FANTASTIC. I used helpful suggestions from the other reviewers to make modifications, and here's my advice:
1. I scaled the recipe down to 11 servings so it used 2 pkgs of cream cheese. I used one pkg of full-fat cream cheese and one pkg of light, and it still tasted wonderfully rich. 
3. I added about 3/4 to 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the batter, subbed 3/4 tbsp of vanilla extract for the rum (I didn't have any rum on hand), and used 1 cup eggnog. 
4. MAKE THIS CHEESECAKE THE DAY BEFORE YOU NEED IT (I can't stress that enough; this recipe improves with time, and the flavor is much better the second day). 
5. If you're using a store-bought graham cracker crust, there will be more batter than you need to fill the crust, so look up a "crustless cheesecake" recipe and use those directions for baking the excess batter. 
6. Use a water bath (I just filled a cake pan with water and put it on the bottom rack of the oven, below the middle rack where the cheesecake was).
7. When it's finished cooking, turn off the heat, open the oven door a bit, and let it cool in there for a couple hours before refrigerating.

This recipe is fantastic - it's definitely going to be an Xmas staple from now on!

Excellent cheesecake! A great way to use leftover eggnog. I didn't have any rum, so I used vanilla extract instead - it still tasted as if alcohol had been added to it (DELICIOUS!). Since I didn't have a food processor big enough to fit the entire recipe, I used an electric beater. I made sure to beat the cream cheese mixture until very fluffy. It was so fluffy that I thought it would colapse after removing from the oven. To my surprise, it didn't. And, to give it a delicate flavor, I used crushed lady fingers in place of graham crakers. The final result was of a very light and creamy filling over a delicious crust. Perfect for making mini-sized cheesecakes (the kind that you can eat in 2 to 3 bites); a great addition to the finger-food menu of an elegant party.

This may be the best cheesecake I've ever made.  I brought this to our work holiday party and EVERYONE raved about it.  Not too sweet, great eggnog flavor.  I did a gingersnap crust instead of graham cracker and that complemented the nutmeg and eggnog beautifully and substituted vanilla extract for the rum.  It was very easy to make and the biggest hit I've had at a potluck since I made chocolate bread pudding 4 years ago.  Definitely a keeper for holiday desserts.

This is the most delicious cheesecake I've ever had.  I've made dozens of them, and people have started hiring me to bake them for their Christmas parties this year.  It always comes out perfectly, and is always a hit.  I use my KitchenAid mixer and let it mix for a good, long while until everything is smooth and creamy.  This recipe is to die for!

I made these cheesecake THREE times during December--that's how good it is.  Here are my modifications: (1) use gingersnaps for the crust.  Every time I made it, someone raved about the crust.  (2) Use 1 c. of eggnog, not 3/4 c.  Someone else recommended this and it works.  Use more nutmeg than a pinch.  (3) Use spiced rum if you have it.  And finally, when the recipe says "remove from oven and immediately loosen sides," do it.  The first time I did not, and it cracked heavily as it cooled.  I spread whipped cream over the top and no one ever knew.  But the next time, I ran a knife around the sides and it didn't crack at all.  Best if you can let it sit overnight.  Easy and absolutely great for holiday desserts.

This cheesecake had a great consistancy - not too heavy yet satisfying in the way only cheesecake can be.  I used the Pecan Caramel sauce from Eggnog Cheesecake I at this site - it has dark rum in it and was perfect.  I also added some spices ( 1/4 tsp each of ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon) to the crust.  I don't have a food processor, I just mixed the heck out of it with my stand mixer.

SO good!  The perfect elegant, yet not too challenging holiday dessert.  I had plenty of eggnog leftover from making my yearly eggnog Christmas cookies and wanted to make a cheesecake for a family Christmas celebration, so it made perfect sense.

I followed several different suggestions and made some minor adjustments to the original recipe.  I will admit, that although I've made enough cheesecakes that I would say I'm a fairly experienced cheesecake baker I have never prepared my batter in a food processor so I was a little nervous but since I already had the processor out to make my crust I thought I'd give it a go, and it worked out great, plus I didn't dirty up my mixer!  

The changes I made are as follows:
- for the crust I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- I upped the eggnog to 1 cup in the batter
- replaced the rum with 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
- added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg  to batter

Also, unlike many of the users I did not use a waterbath, nor have I ever.  The consistency was great and no cracks!

When I set out to find an unusual holiday cheesecake recipe, I stumbled upon this one, which seemed like one of the easiest. Not only was it relatively easy, it was one of the smoothest, richest cheesecakes I've ever tasted. The eggnog flavor lends itself very well to this classic dessert. In addition to an eggnog cheesecake, I used the basic recipe but substituted pure almond flavor for the rum and then swirled it with freshly grated ginger before baking. Both were superlative. Thanks for the great recipe.

Yum! This has to be one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made and I have made dozens!
I changed the recipes a bit by adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the graham crust. This gave it a slightly stronger flavor and really 'set off' the egg nog taste in the cheesecake itself.
If you are looking for a great holiday dessert...this is it!

Fantastic!  The only dessert at our dessert buffet to be completely gone.  My addition was decorating with rum flavored whipped cream (1C whipping cream + 3 Tbsp powdered sugar, whipped - then add 2 Tbsp rum and 1 tsp cinnamon).  Will do this again next year.

We made this cheesecake twice over the holidays and everyone who ate it loved it, even my picky 5 year old!  Creamy and decadent, the only alteration I could suggest would be adding a little nutmeg and cinnamon to the crust.

This was a great cheesecake!  I did change a few things, like the crust. I used crushed gingersnap cookies. And sometimes I add crushed pecans.  I also used Captain Morgan spiced rum instead of regular rum.  One cup of eggnog,  and I added way more than a pinch of nutmeg.  I also added a bit of allspice and cinnamon. It is suppose to be eggnog right?  This really is a perfect Christmas dessert! I promise everyone will rave!!

This is the BEST EVER & EASIEST CHEESECAKE. I Changed a little like I used Cinnamon Graham Crackers. And also couldn't find any eggnog after Christmas, so I made my own the Single serving recipe is at the bottom. Also messed up and made it Pink, made a mistake thought it was Vanilla Extract & it was red food coloring so already had the everything in the eggnog so, said its gonna be a Pink Cake. Hey, good for Valantine's Day or green for St. Patty's Day. And Also used 10in deep dish pie pan, didn't have Spring pan. I put a pan of water under the cake while it was cooking. Be will make all the time now that I know how to make eggnog here's the recipe by the way.
Single-Serving Eggnog 

3/4 cup cold whole milk 
1 egg, well beaten 
2 ounces chilled liquor (rum, bourbon, brandy) 
1 rounded teaspoon confectioners sugar 
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 
ground nutmeg 
In a small bowl, combine the milk, egg, liquor, sugar and vanilla. Whisk until well combined. Pour into chilled glass and sprinkle with nutmeg.

This is a good cheesecake.  It has good texture.  The trick is to beat the cream cheese and sugar a good 3 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  What would make this cheesecake great is to add more than just a pinch of nutmeg to the cream cheese mixture.  I would suggest adding up to 1 to 2 tsp. of nutmeg to really bring out the eggnog flavor.  When I made this, I used only 1/4 tsp. and ended up sprinkling nutmeg on top of each slice, which is good too!  I used Captain Morgan spiced rum.  Yum!

I didn't change a thing as far as ingredients go, what I did change was HOW I cooked it. 

I lightly sprayed the spring form pan with non stick baking oil (when the cheesecakes pull away from the pan as they cool, they may crack if they stick to the pan, so this helps a ton!) I set the oven to 325 and cooked it in a water bath (spring form pan is covered with two layers of tin foil, then placed inside a roasting pan which is filled with boiling water so that the water reaches at least half way up the spring form pan) for 55 minutes. After that I switched off the oven, cracked the oven door and let it cool inside the oven for an hour. Afterwards it cooled on the counter for another 45 minutes before I covered it and put it in the fridge. 

Ive read on multiple sites that its important to mix the cream cheese by itself a bit before blending in other ingredients. With a hand held beater, I mixed the cream cheese just long enough for it to be slightly smooth. The other ingredients are added, but the eggs need to be added last and once you do add the eggs only mix by hand. Beating too fast will create tiny air pockets in the mixture once the eggs are incorporated, which will then cause the cheesecake to rise while it cooks, and then fall when it cools. We don't want that! So gently fold in those eggs by hand!

I was really excited to try and make this, and read all the reviews/suggestions before I made it.  Next time I will bake it a little longer and I won’t use rum extract, but vanilla extract and cinnamon.

Scrumptous and rich, perfect for a holiday gathering!  Everyone loved it.    We had reduced fat cream cheese (neufchatel)and reduced fat eggnog in the house, so I used them. The cheesecake did not remotely taste reduced fat nor did it compromise the rich flavor. I also made sure the cream cheese was very soft and microwaved the eggnog for about 40 seconds to avoid the lumps another review mentioned. I used a hand mixer, which worked beautifully. I also added a dash of cinnamon, ginger and some vanilla extract. The rum adds depth and doesn't overwhelm the eggnog flavor at all. I also had a pre-made graham cracker crust, but a word of warning - it wasn't big enough, so I cooked the leftover in a pyrex bowl, which was still yummy. The cooking time took a bit longer than the recipe suggested. I put a bain marie (pan of water) in the oven with it, and there were no cracks at all. I would absolutely recommend this for a holiday dinner or gathering!

Delicious.  I made a few changes.  I used a different crust recipe: 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1 stick melted butter, 1/2 tsp cinnamon...it's more fattening but a much better crust.  I skipped the 10 minute crust baking step and instead put the crust in the fridge while I was assembling the rest of the cake.  I didn't have rum so I substituted vanilla extract like someone else suggested.  Follow the cooking instructions exactly, and DO NOT open the oven during baking, and your cheesecake will be perfect......DELICIOUS!!

One of the best cheesecakes I've ever had, and one of the best recipes I've ever found on this site. The cheesecake is creamy and rich and has a wonderful eggnog flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I also like to substitute Pecan Sandie Cookie crust (1.5 cup crushed cookies, 5 tbsp butter, and big dash of cinnamon and nutmeg) just to mix things up.

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made, as I was always kind of intimidated by making one.  We brought this to a New Year's Eve party and it was a HIT!  Everyone loved it, and I will be making more cheesecakes in the future.  I used one low-fat cream cheese and two regulars, and I also added 1 t. rum extract to the batter, as well as some cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust.  I used a water bath while baking, and it prevented any cracking in the top of the cheesecake.  I will definitely make this one again-- it was fantastic and a keeper.

Mmm good and very easy. I brought this to a work potluck and half vanished there. Took the rest to the gym and gave it to the personal trainers. They were into it not five minutes after I brought it in, moaning about how good it was. A definite keeper. I made a sauce on the side of caramel, toasted pecans and rum. Tasted great with or without the sauce. Do go heavier on the rum and nutmeg.

So good!  I tested this before Christmas to make sure it is good enough to serve a group, and it definitely is! I scaled the recipe for 11 people (cuts the cream cheese to 2 packages) and it fit in a prepared 10" graham crust perfectly. Baked like is was a pumpkin cheesecake, perfect timing! Used Southern Comfort vanilla eggnog to make it appeal to more people. Can top with leftover (homemade) cranberry sauce, chilled, to make it more festive. Absolutely delicious!

WOW!  This cheesecake is sooooo good!!!!  I followed another reviewer and added 1 cup of egg nog and an extra tablespoon of rum.  It was a HIT on New Years Eve!  People couldn't get over how creamy it was!  Usually cheesecake is heavy, but this was so creamy!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

I only had a 10" springform pan, so made an extra half-recipe of filling for this (didn't use quite all of that) due to my larger pan and a reviewer's comment advising that this doesn't come out as a deep cheesecake filling.  I also used gingersnaps for the crust, upped the eggnog from 3/4c to 1c, & increased the nutmeg to 1/2tsp. Baked with a pan of water in the bottom of the oven to help prevent cracks (only had one tiny one), and let sit in oven with door slightly propped open, after baking, for about one hour.  Drizzled this with Dulce de Leche (from this website).  Thanks for the recipe, Bill!

I have made this cheesecake 3 times and each time it gets better! I did use a bit more nutmeg in the recipe for more flavor as it goes very well with the eggnog and when I measure out the rum I am generous as well and the flavor has only improved. My dessert party guests loved it and my family too! This is definately a winner if you enjoy eggnog, although it is not overbearing at all. Great light and creamy cheesecake. Also, when the cake is done it will still be very light on top and feel jiggly but after cooling and removing the cake ring it reveals a brown rim and is completely cooked. Turns out great every time! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved this recipe.  I used almond extract instead of rum, increased the eggnog to 1 1/4 cup, and doubled the flour.  The Crust was Ginger Snaps and I made a caramel sauce for the top.  It was a hug hit.  Next time I'll make sure the eggnog is room temperature because once I added it cold to my cream cheese it was a bit lumpy, but still delicious.

WOW!!!!  This turned out to be the most perfect looking cheesecake I have ever baked.  The top was perfectly smooth, no cracks, no uneven baking...perfection.  The cheesecake is unbelievably creamy with just the right amount of eggnog flavor.  I do not usually drink eggnog, but I just had to taste this before taking it to the party (I almost didn't want to after tasting), and it is so good. This is the perfect Christmas cheesecake.

So yummy.  Next time I will use a little more eggnog, a little more rum extract, and a little more nutmeg, just to make the eggnog flavor a bit stronger. Also, I used nilla wafer crumbs to make the crust, it was the perfect crust!!

I made a lower fat version of this using splenda, lowfat egg nog and neufchatel cheese. There is nothing in the taste of it that said "reduced fat".

I also took other reviewers advice and used 1cup eggnog, 1/4 tsp nutmeg as well as cinnamon and ground ginger. It turned out perfect, and my "test group" devoured it in no time.

I did not have the same cook time problems as some of the other reviews. The time listed in the original recipe was perfect. 

A very satisfying holiday cheesecake!

This was incredible!  On Christmas Eve, I had waited too long to do my shopping and only had a 10 inch spring-form pan to work with.  I had 4 packages of cream cheese, so I used all 4 and increased my ingredients slightly to compensate- I added an extra egg, and extra tsp of rum, a little more nutmeg, an extra tsp of flour, and a full cup of egg nog instead of 3/4.  I was so sure that it wasn't going to turn out because the batter was really thin.

but to my surprise, it set beautifully.  The cake, because it was baked in a 10 inch instead of the 9 inch turned out a little thinner than I thought it would, but it didn't matter.  It was so rich and luscious that the smaller the better.  Everyone was begging for the recipe!  I'm sure that when cooked in the proper pan, and to the exact measurements, it would turn out just as lovely if not better!  This has become a holiday keeper.  Thank you Bill Sinclair!

This was easy to make and the teachers at the school were so impressed by the subtle flavor of eggnog.  I added homemade grand marnier cranberry jelly to the top after it cooled.  Very elegant to serve for a candle lit dinner.

Yummy!  I made 1/3 recipe, doubled the eggnog, subbed Brandy Extract for the rum, grated fresh nutmeg on top for garnish and baked in tartlet shells for a lovely addition to my Christmas Cookie selection.  I baked the leftover cheesecake in souffle cups sprayed with non-stick spray for 30 minutes at 325.  I'm going to make some more tomorrow!

Added a splash extrsa eggnog and pumpkin pie spice and then once crust baked sprinkled it with cinnamon. I didn't have rum either so I put in Kalua and oh man this stuff is great! Also made one with lady finger crst instead and one with pretzel crust. The pretzel crust was a clear winner at our party!

This is one of the best textured cheesecakes! 

I take a few shortcuts by using my Kitchen-aid mixer to beat the cream cheese mixture until very creamy and smooth. I also use an extra serving size premade crust if I'm in a rush.

For special occasions I frost the cooled cheesecake with: 1 tablespoon dark rum, a pinch of nutmeg mixed into 1 small carton of Cool Whip.

This is amazing!  The only change I made was to use 1 tbsp vanilla extract in place of the rum extract.  Baked in a water bath, and when time was up, turned the oven off, cracked the door, and let the cake cool completely before removing it.  Definitely cream the cream cheese and eggnog together for several minutes before adding everything else - it comes out sooooo smooth and silky!  Wonderful cheesecake.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family said this was great.  I used gingersnaps cookies for the crust.  When I baked the cheesecake, I baked it a 300 degrees and baked it in a water bath (a little water in the bottom of the cookie sheet, don't forget to wrap your cheesecake pan in foil at the bottom so the water doesn't get in). I had no cracks and the cake was so creamy and delicious.

This was delicious. I used light eggnog and it was a hit. Beware - the picture is deceptive. This cheesecake is not as thick, comes out much flatter. That being said, it is very rich and creamy. A small slice is all you need.

So good. For real eggnog flavor,  I also put nutmeg and cinnamon in the crust, and add1 whole cup of eggnog, upping the rum to 3 TB. I found out that one sleeve of graham crackers equals about a cup of crumbs, so I make the whole crust in the food processor, adding the nutmeg, cinnamon, and sugar and processing until fine crumbs. Then I melt the butter and add it to the processor, scraping the sides and  bottom down. This is an extremely easy and less messy way to make the crust. I have made this cheesecake three times, twice in my kitchen aid and once as directed in the processor.  For some reason, the one in the processor turned out quite flat (but still "good enough to sell" according to my friends). Every time I have used a water bath (though not always necessary in a cheesecake, it's my habit because I prefer super creamy cheesecakes that have an even consistency from the edges to the center compared to the New York style, which are generally not supposed to be made in a water bath) and followed the cooking times, adding perhaps 5 minutes at the end. Then, opening the door for an hour before fully cooling on the counter and refrigerating overnight.I made the mistake of using cold eggnog once- don't... Make sure every ingredient is room temp. I always whip my cheesecakes until very fluffy and then add the eggs last, so as not to over whip them, creating a rise and fall that could create cracks. Overcooking will do this too, but a water bath is very forgiving.

Absolutely amazing! I got rave reviews when I made this for Christmas. This will be my go-to recipe for cheesecake from now on...only thing I would recommend is not loosening the cheesecake from the ring immediately...my cheesecake had come out of the oven without any cracks and once I tried to remove the ring from the springform pan, I got a big crack, which was a dissapointment.  I used a water bath also, always makes a huge difference.

Just made this for a trial run for Thanksgiving and oh boy is this awesome!  Sooooo tasty and yummy!  I cheated and used a prepared graham cracker crust instead of using my springform pan, which always leaks!  I stuck to the recipe except for giving a few generous shakes of nutmeg instead of a pinch.  The ending result is so flavorful, I am very pleased with this recipe.  It definitely made the list for Thanksgiving dessert!  Thanks Bill :)

I have no idea what happened with this recipe but my cheesecake came out NOTHING like it was supposed to.  The center of the cake did not cook at all and I had it in their for an extra 40 minutes! There is nothing wrong with the oven and every other recipe I saw had the oven at an extra 25+ degrees for a longer period of time.  I did not tweak the recipe at all so I have no idea what went wrong.  Ruined my christmas desert!

Made this for company Christmas party.  I have made a lot of cheesecakes and this was the best I have ever made.  I made a thicker crust with 2 cups of graham crackers, a little extra butter and baked in a 10-inch spring form pan.  For the filling, I used a little over 1 cup of egg nog.  I baked with a water bath beside the cheescake, and let it rest in the oven for about an hour after turning the heat off and opening the door halfway.  Beautiful cake with slightly browned edges and no cracks.  This was the first time I had used the food processor- very easy and resulted in a very creamy cake.  I am making it again tomorrow!

Ok I am giving it 5 stars because it tastes fabulous and the texture is great.  However, I had problems with it cracking!  I wanted to make this and freeze it since we'll be out of town and then will have relatives in when we get back.  So I made it Tues night, and it was all cracked when it came out of the oven.   I was worried it wouldn't freeze well like that so i went ahead and dug into it and brought some to work.  I figured I beat the eggs in too long.  So, the next day, I tried it again, being more careful with the eggs.  It cracked just a little around the edges in the oven (and I took it out 14 minutes early!!) but as it cooled, it cracked all over the cheesecake again!!!  I am going to go ahead and freeze it though.  It won't be a very pretty cheesecake but it sure does taste good.  Anyone know what I am doing wrong, and why it keeps cracking on me?  I've made other cheesecakes and they did not crack.

this was very good but wasn't perfect. i needed more butter to hold the crust together. i baked it as directed but after 45 minutes it was still very soft in the middle so i baked it for about 10 minutes longer, until the edges browned a bit. after cooling for about 4 hours the middle was still like pudding. i served it with whipped cream to disguise the softness and got rave reviews from my family. i served it with candied pecans also. this is a great tasting cheesecake it just needs a few improvements which is fine by me. i will definitely try this one again only i will make the day before so it has longer to set in the fridge.

This came out great. This is the second cheesecake I've made with a springform pan and the first to come out good. I added a pecan topping from another recipe and it was one of the best cheesecakes I've had in a long time. 
Oh, I also used a 10" pan by mistake. But I think I'll keep using the 10".

I make cheesecakes a lot. The 250 degrees isn't high enough to cook through. This needs to be at least  325 degrees and for an hour. What a disappointment very soggy  and unedible for my Christmas dessert party.

This is a great recipe.  I made it this year for Christmas and will definitely make it again.  I didn't have a spring form pan so I reduced the recipe by 1/3 to accommodate a 9 inch crust.  Came out great but I will be buying the suggested pan because I think it will make a better presentation.  My family loved it.  Thanks!

Great recipe! A traditional recipe at Examiner.com (see link below) calls for 2 tsp of rum extract in lieu of the 2 tablespoons of rum for those wanting to go lighter on the rum. I also wouldn't serve it without either carmel topping or the traditional carmel rum sauce

I made this for a Progressive Dinner my neighborhood had.  It was a big hit!  Even people who said they weren't fans of eggnog enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe to a t and it was amazing.  The only bad thing was that my cheesecake cracked a little in the middle while cooling.  I later found out it was because I over- mixed the ingredients.  It was my first time making cheesecake so I wasn't really sure what I was doing.  Everyone still loved it.

great recipe.  Too bad the cooking instructions ruined it.  NO cheesecake will ever set if cooked as directed.  Bake it at 325 for at least 1.25 hrs.

This was delicious.  I added some cinnamon to the batter...and for the topping we used whipped cream with a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Everyone loved it.  I may add some rum next time!

BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!  The cooking time/temp makes this cheesecake amazing.  I made my crust with crushed cashews and graham crackers and added some nutmeg and cinnamon.  Just spectacular!

i used the non alcoholic southern comfort vanilla spice eggnog for this and left out the rum(didn't have any). it was good. i ended up adding way more eggnog and to me it still needed more after the pies were finished. this could be because of the flavor of eggnog i used. it was good & i'll make again

This was the first cheesecake recipe i've ever attempted, I was kind of scared to try one... afraid I wouldn't bake it correctly and it would come out too gooey or too rubbery, but using a water bath in the bottom of the oven helped a lot on keeping the temperature even. I finished mine with a sprinkling of cinnamon and whipped cream with white chocolate liqueur and it is AMAZING! Thanks for a great recipe and I recommend this to anyone who asks!

I really loved the filling.  I used imitation rum extract instead of buying a bottle of rum.  What is a pinch of nutmeg, really?  The thing I love the most about eggnog is the nutmeg, so I added at least ¼ tsp.   The plain graham cracker crust was a bit of a downer.  It didn’t have any flavor, not even a buttery taste.   I would prefer a dressier crust that compliments the eggnog flavor.

A holiday favorite!  I use Bill's recipe as a jumping off point, but I add a bit of nutmeg to the crust, omit the rum from the filling, and I add 1 tsp. of each cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling.

The second time I did use the cinnamon grahams and preferred that.  I am a professional baker and I will definitely be using this recipe in my shop!!   Anyway, it was marvelous!  Thanks!

Great cheesecake, but you can barely taste the eggnog, so in the end it tastes like a regular cheesecake with a hint of cinnamon. The friends I made this for love eggnog, so it was a little disappointing.

This cheesecake was FANTASTIC!!! I made it exactly the same as the recipe, except adding a little nutmeg and cinnamon to the crust. I took it to the small company I work for, and it was gone within 2 hours! I have been told I MUST make this again next year for sure. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

All the posts before this warned me about the cooking length being too short.  I left the cheesecake in the oven for about ten minutes longer, tearing my hair out and wringing my knuckles.  I guess opening the oven door often helps the process, because it came out perfectly.  Also, I ran out of rum extract after the first tablespoon, so I used half rum, half vanilla.

My whole family loved this cheesecake, even my sister-in-law who doesn't like eggnog!  This is probably the creamiest and smoothest cheesecake I've ever made, as well as one of the easiest.
I would recommend making it a day ahead if you can.  It was delicious the first day, but even better the second.

Fantastic recipe! I baked it 10 minutes at 425 and only 40 minutes at 250, and it was perfectly done. I have a convection oven, and things tend to bake faster. The texture was very smooth and light, and it tasted great. It didn't crack at all like most cheesecakes tend to do, so it looked very nice. This is probably the best cheesecake I've ever made. It actually tasted even better the next day!

Made this for a Christmas dessert and it was delicious! To make it gluten free, I added 1.5 TBSP of cornstarch (I mixed it with the rum before putting into cream cheese mixture) instead of the flour. I increased the eggnog to 1 cup and warmed it before adding to the other ingredients. I added 1 tsp of nutmeg instead of a pinch to the cake. In the crust, I added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. The cake turned out creamy and had a mild yet perfect eggnog flavor!

I make this Cheesecake every year, it's a Christmas tradition. The only thing I changed is once the cake is cooked I turn the oven off and leave it in there for an hour. Once I take it out of the oven I run a knife around the edge before removing the rim. I then make a stencil (usually a Christmas Tree) and use a mix of cinnamon and nutmeg to sprinkle the pattern on top of the cake.

I made this last year and am just going through all my recipes for the holidays again. I got a TON of rave reviews on this cheesecake. Everyone loved it and asked if it was store bought. I recommend if you want  a cheesecake that's amazing! From what I remember, I made no changes and stuck with the directions exactly as laid out.

This is an excellent recipe, the first time I made it everyone demolished it even though it came out a little flat.  Following the recommendations on the site I let the cream cheese soften, whipped that by itself first with a hand mixer.  Then folded in the eggnog which I allowed to warm to room temperature the result was a nice creamy batter.  I mixed the remaining ingredients by hand in a separate dish then folded that in to the batter, lastly I folded in the sugar resulting in a nice smooth and creamy batter.  I did not use any alcohol in mine and the flavor is excellent.  I will definitely be making this cheesecake again for Christmas and New Years.

This was a huge hit!! I just used a store-bought graham cracker crust to save on time, and it worked fine. I had too much filling for the crust through so I just sprayed a loaf pan and poured the rest of the filling in and made some crust-less cheesecake bars, which were also fantastic! I will make this every year for Christmas!!!

This was good. I used crushed gingersnaps for the crust. The only thing I didn't like it that is didn't set well in the middle... but that could be my fault? It did have a great flavor though and I followed the recipe to a T except for the crust.

This had good flavor, but never set up. I cooked it twice as long as recommended and it still had the texture of custard. I did cook it in a bath of water as recommended by a previous review, so that probably slowed the cooking time.

Wow!! Eggnog and cheesecake are two of my favorite holiday guilty-pleasures.  This cheesecake didn't disappoint.  My family gladly polished this cheesecake off. :) Will definitely make this part of my holiday menu again!

This is a great way to use up some of that holiday eggnog!  Recipe is easy and tastes great.  I always leave my cheesecake in the oven after it is done- just turn off the oven and leave it in there to cool.  No cracks and the center does not drop.  I would add more than a "pinch" of nutmeg to keep a nice "eggnog" flavor.

Baking time or temperature must be way off on this cheesecake because it took another hour in my oven before it looked like it was finished. Even then when we cut into it, it was so soft it all stuck to the knife. I have never had a cheesecake do this. I was apologized to my Christmas company for the poor presentation of the cheesecake, however they all liked the taste of it. I would make again but I would figure out a better temperature and time to bake the cheesecake.

I accidentally bought cinnamon graham crackers instead. It made all the difference and came out great! I would strongly suggest using cinnamon grahams instead of honey. Served with thin gingersnaps as a garnish :)

Just made this cheesecake....made it exactly as it states but with a water bath and cooked it longer. Didn't crack at all while cooking but when I took it out of the oven and released the pan, it got a small crack on the side... I'm hoping for now that's the only one, but it looks like it's setting up nicely. I will update later with more results...

After reading all of the reviews I was excited to make this.  The only change I made was to double the graham cracker crust as suggested by a review.  I baked it in a water bath, let it cool in the oven, refrigerated for over a day...Then was deeply disappointed to cut into it and find it wasn't done. (I bought an instant read thermometer today for the next cheesecake I'll make).  It was really soft and almost pudding like in the center although the outside looked fine.  The graham cracker crust was too thick..overpowering.  I'd recommend the original amount for the crust.  The eggnog flavor wasn't very strong..Probably won't make this again:{

This recipe has become a staple in my house.  Easy to make, a short list of ingredients, and really delicious.  I also make it substituting chocolate cookie crumbs for the graham cracker crumbs, and using Baileys Irish Cream instead of eggnog.  Thanks for sharing!

This is so easy and delicious!!!  I used a store bought crust to save time, but then got creative and made a chocolate mint crust for the rest of the batter.  These 'extras' were by far the best!!!  I just crushed thin mint cookies up and added 2 T butter melted, mixed and baked for 10 minutes.

I certainly think that putting the cream cheese through the food processor must be the key to an ultra smooth and creamy cheesecake! I made this for Christmas Eve two years ago and my brother in-law (huge cheesecake fan) said it was the best he'd ever had! I personally don't care for cheesecake but I enjoyed it as well. Yummy recipe,thank you!

This was one of the best cheesecakes I have made.  I used whiskey instead of rum because I did not have any.

This cheesecake was great.  I got rave reviews from the family on Christmas.  It was easy to make -- it didn't even crack!  The only thing I did different was added 1 tsp. of rum extract and 1 tsp. of vanilla extract instead of the rum.  Also, I served it with a cinnamon whipped cream.

I have made this cheesecake twice now and the second time I increased the size to 24 servings. I made the following changes and found it to be better tasting, but I still LOVE this recipe.  I used a butter cookie crust in place of the graham cracker crust.  I purchased Mother's Butter Cookies and omited the sugar needed in the crust.  In the cheesecake portion, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 C and I also found that the cake does need to bake longer, even the serving size for 16, than what is called for in the original recipe. However, I still think this is a great recipe!

Excellent! I put it in two ready-made graham cracker crusts and cut the 250 baking time to 30 minutes. Very easy this way! Thanks for posting it!

Very good and very easy, but both times I made this I needed to cook it longer (30 min or until the top browned a little and the middle was set).  Much better after cooled.  I used gingersnaps and cinnamon graham crackers for the crust.  Tonight we will eat it with candied pecans and cinnamon ice cream. Last time my I made it my boyfriend ate the whole thing in 3 days!!

I made this recipe for a get-together with friends I was going to. I don't have a spring form pan so I just filled two graham pie crusts and left some back home for my family. Everyone loved it! My Mom had some when it was still a bit warm and she really liked it a bit warm. My friend's Mom who won't eat carbs or anything high calorie even had a piece! I plan on making another one soon to use up some leftover eggnog.

I was looking for a simple eggnog cheesecake recipe for our family Christmas dinner. I made this one the night before and it got RAVE reviews from the already stuffed dinner party guests. Turned out amazing. I only made a few small changes - I doubled the crust and added more butter because I like a butterier crust and I added about 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and cinnamon to the crust as well. Baked in a bain Marie since that’s how I do all of my cheesecakes. I topped it with a whipped cream prepared with nutmeg, cinnamon, rum and a splash of eggnog piped in rosettes and then sifted a mixture of cinnamon and nutmeg over the top to make it look pretty. Show stopping look and flavour. Will absolutely make again.

Thank you to all of you whose reviews contained helpful hints. I made this for a Christmas party and it was a big hit. Since this was my first attempt at using a springform pan, I wanted to avoid obvious mistakes. I used a water bath on the grate below the cake to add moisture, used a full cup of eggnog, but otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly. I ran a knife around the edge after baking and then left it in the oven for a good hour with the door ajar. There was not one crack in it. The next day I brushed a tiny bit of light corn syrup on the top so some colored sprinkles would stick to it. It was a pretty thing to take to a party.

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit! Following some of the other suggestions, I increased the egg nog to 1 cup and used ginger snaps for the crust. I also added 1/2 t. nutmeg to the batter, but only because the egg nog I used wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. There was some cracking, so following another recommendation, I topped it with whipped cream made with 3 T.  powdered sugar, 2 T. rum and 1 t. cinnamon.  It was even better the second day.

Did you mean 350 vs 250 degrees?  Mine wouldn't set up. Rebaking at 350 as I write this.  Oh, and watch the nutmeg. I used fresh ground and maybe a pinch too much.

Didn't have plain rum, so I substituted Malibu and Amaretto. Cheesecake came out extremely fluffy and delicious.

WOW, this recipe deserves more than 5 stars. I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving, and for a New Year's Day party.  BIG HIT! First time I made it exactly as written, and it was great, second time I took the advice of reviewers and added more nutmeg to the batter, and added nutmeg and cinnamon to the  gram cracker crust it really brings out the flavor of the egg nog and rum. I  placed a pan of water underneath the cheesecake on a separate  rack to avoid cracks. Sounds skeptical using a food processor especially if you have a kitchen aid mixer but honestly it works  surprisingly well makes for a nice smooth batter. Have a cousin who is a chef at a 5 star restaurant thought this recipe was so good he asked for the recipe.  He said the only thing he would do different would be to double the recipe.  Thanks for Sharing!!  :)

Everyone loved this Cheese Cake, it was just right, no changes except a little extra on the rum.  I used Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, and added a pinch of Cayenne with the Nutmeg.  It was smooth and creamy with a hint of N.Y. style Cheese Cake, so it was firm.

OMG!!! This was amazing!!! It tastes like something you would get at a 5 star restaurant. I made 2 of them. I think I over cooked it, because one cracked. But it was still creamy and moist. 
I took someone else's advice and made a rum whip to go with it, and sprinkled a little cinnamon on top. Delish!!!

This turned out amazing the second time I made it.  The first time, I didn't let it sit in the oven long enough once the timer went off and the cheesecake centre was runny.   The second time I let it sit for about an hour with the oven door left open as it cooled and the centre set perfectly.  I have any rum or rum extract so I substituted it with 1 tsp of almond extract and 1 tsp of caramel extract. I also used crushed ginger cookies in the base in place of graham crumbs.  My friends face it rave reviews.  Definitely a keeper for Christmastime.

I used 24 mini graham cracker crusts. Baked 12 at a time at 325 for 20 minutes. At the 20 minute mark I turned the oven off, cracked open the oven door for 30 minutes, then removed to cooling rack for about 30 more minutes before placing into the refrigerator. DH and I split one and really liked the flavor. I'm taking them for Christmas Day dessert and will freeze any left over.

Update: I made this a second time and only baked for 15 minutes removed to a cooling rack while baking the final 12 minis. They turned out great and were a lot easier than my first try.  Sprinkled tops with cinnamon and sugar.

Like most, I added entire cup of eggnog.  I had no Rum so I substituted 1 tsp rum extract and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract.  I placed cake pan 3/4 full of water in bottom of oven while baking.  Used my Vitamix to mix all ingredients- worked great.   Used ginger snaps for crust rather than graham crackers.  When the center was firm, I turned oven off and let cake cool in oven.  No cracks.  Delicious!!!

I used a premade crust and no rum, I also didn't have any electric mixers so I melted the cream cheese and whisked it by hand! Turned out delicious. Next time I would use more egg nog (a cup rather than 3/4), some cinnamon, and probably use 2 light cream cheeses so I don't feel so guilty eating the whole thing ;) Definitely let it cool! It gets so much better as it sits...

I made this last night and everyone loved it!! It was the test cheesecake before the big event of Thanksgiving, which is tomorrow. I gave it a 4 stars because following the recipe is good, but if I'd have looked at some of the reviews I would have followed their instructions the first time. I am currently baking another one right now for tomorrow and am follow the instructions about the water bath and am hoping that it keeps the cheesecake from cracking!! I also am doing a parchment collar around the springform pan to keep the cake from sticking (it only did it slightly yesterday but since I'm presenting this at my in-laws I want it to lol as perfect as possible, lol) it worked well for everyone in my family since my grandmother and mom aren't big eggnog fans and my husband and grandfather are. For those who don't love eggnog it tasted like a creamy rich cheesecake with undertones of the eggnog, but my husband and grandfather said that the eggnog was definitely in the cheesecake. There's only 2 slices left and I backed the cheesecake at 10pm last night. My grandparents eat about 1/2 of the cake..."I just kept going back for a little slice and before I knew it we had eaten half of the cake! I'm sorry!!" Was my grandmas response this morning. Totally a new Thanksgiving Tradition in our house!!

The only two things I've changed was about 5 or 6 huge splashes of rum that i drank. Anyway, since I just bought a Kitchen Aid stand mixer, I used that rather dirtying up my prossesor. Yes there were tiny lumps of cream cheese but that's okay because it melts and works itself into the cake as it bakes.

My roommate is an EXTREMELY picky eggnog "connoisseur", and he stole all of my pieces. Enough said I think!
Followed the directions almost exactly, except I added a little more rum to taste.

I gave this recipe a try and it was absolutely great. I cannot stop eating it. I did a few minor changes for my liking. I added more nutmeg and rum than called for. I would recommend only two boxes of cream cheese. There was filling left over and the pie pan was filled. I did make the crust fill the pan though.  Thanks for the recipe

Great  recipe. I make my own coquito (coconut eggnog) with rum so I used a cup of that in place of the eggnogn and rum.

The filling is very good. You don't need to precook crust. Change the crust to 1 1/2  cups cracker 1/3 cup butter. Sugar ok. Use mixer not food processor for filling.

Very good cheesecake.  The cooking time seemed to be way off for me.  Next time I will bake it at a higher temperature instead of the 250 degrees the recipe suggests.

Had to bring a dessert for Christmas eve and decided on this one. Honestly, it was amazing. Not only was the flavor warm and subtle eggnog, it was the texture I loved most.  Just the perfect, classic cheesecake texture. Makes me want to  use eggnog for all my cheesecakes. I used a 10" spring form pan so I doubled the crust and made an extra 1/2 recipe of the filling. Still baked it for the same length of time and it was perfect. Used a water bath on rack underneath the cheesecake, and made it the day before as other reviews suggested. Added more spices to both crust and filling as well. Gonna do a vanilla version next.

Six years later and still a magnificant piece of art! Was very surprised based on studies of other recipes that you use the whole eggnog from a carton but it works marvelously. One thing I suggest is to try subbing flour with 1/3 T og whipping cream. I did it and boy was it immpressing! Also upped eggnog to a full cup and added one extra egg. Little more nutmeg for taste. What a great recipe it was all in all!!!
Lets keep this site alive with wonders like this one:)

This was great! Only change I made was adding about a full cup of egg nog and adding cinnamon on top to make it look pretty! Very good flavor. I also baked an extra 10 minutes and that was perfect, no cracks!

Prepared as written with substituting rum extract 2 tsp  for rum needed more flavor even with fresh nutmeg grated on top it needed vanilla and nutmeg / cardamon.
Texture was the problem ----did it in processor and it was like a soft pudding not the mouth feel of cheese cake nor softness of silk pie --1-2 minutes in processor or just use a whip on a mixer ---needs texture----
As for comments on being to flat --check pan size I have 4 sizes of spring molds most used is my 12" not the 9" as called for

I enjoyed this recipe. I made it in my blender, (It would be incredibly hard without) and I used low-fat cream cheese. It turned out a bit grainy, but with a good eggnog flavor. (I added about a tsp. of nutmeg and 1 cup eggnog. This is a really rich pie!!

Great recipe. I made a few adjustments that I would recommend if you want a little twist. I added a shot of Fireball Whiskey for a bit of a cinnamon flavor... try two if you want a bit more. I also used half Ladyfinger crumbs to add a bit of a different taste. We offered whip cream or candy cane ice cream as a topper. Everyone loved it.

Delicious with a great flavor and texture.  Did make a few minor changes.
Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and cinnamon to both the crust and the batter.
Used 1 cup eggnog
Used 4 tbsp butter in the crust
Make sure to use room temp cream cheese to avoid chunks when mixing. (I put mine in the microwave on defrost for a couple minutes to help it soften and that worked well)
I used a water bath in the oven to avoid cracks, but I don't know if this is necessary or not.  I've never tried it without using the water bath.  Cooked it exactly as recipe stated and it turned out perfect!  I used a 10 inch pan because thats the only size I had and it made 16 pieces. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this for a Christmas eve family gathering instead of my usual cheesecake and everyone loved it!  Definitely filling but has a great texture and the egg nog flavor comes through just right, although I think I'll add 3-4T rum next time to kick it up a bit.  I made my own graham cracker crust using 12 crushed cinnamon grahams, 1/2 tsp each nutmeg/cinnamon, 3T each white sugar/melted butter (no need to bake...just keep in fridge until butter sets).  I topped it with homemade whipped cream...1 cup heavy cream, 3T confectioner's sugar, 1T rum and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Keeping this one to make for New Year's and future holiday parties!

I have made this cheesecake twice now, just as written except for using 1tsp of rum extract instead of the actual rum. Made the batter in my food processor which did all the work. Comes out perfect, and is always the hit at the holiday party dinner. Also freezes without any problems and tastes just as good when thawed.  I plan to make again to have one on hand in the freezer.

My cheesecake is currently in the fridge finishing cooling, thus far has turned out great. I've never made anything but a no bake cheesecake but this was easy and wonderful. I did however cheat and use 2 store bought graham cracker crusts but the portions fit in both, and i also used vanilla instead of rum. Great recipe thanks for submitting it! :)

All I can say is "wow"! I don't like cheesecake but was ready to fight over this. To make a creamier cheesecake I always substitute 8 oz sour cream for 8 oz of the cream cheese; I did that but don't think that I needed to. It came out almost like a no-bake cheesecake. And the crust, as written, is very, very good. I wouldn't change a thing next time I make it. This has a very mellow, smooth eggnog flavor. I used an airplane sized bottle of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum.

I made this cheesecake for my family's Thanksgiving dinner and it was a HUGE hit! Very creamy, tasted just like delicious eggnog and baked up without any cracks. I baked it the night before so it had plenty of time to set up perfectly. My dad even helped himself to seconds, which he's never done before. Planning to make this for Christmas too!

I used gingersnaps from Trader Joes for the crust. Spectacular and a little spicy! I also used rum extract instead of rum. I made this twice last December, both times it received rave reviews. I am making it again this Christmas as well.

I have used this recipes many times since finding it just before Christmas.  This is my new go-to recipe for cheesecake.  You don't have to use the eggnog to be able to use this for any flavor!

Well, when I made this, I bought graham crackers and grounded them up the hard way... not doing that again. Also, when I did this recipe I didn't have any springform pans, so I used a regular pie pan - which pretty much work except I could've used some more crust base... also, I plan on using a tad more butter for my crust since most of it was still a bit loose. -- For the creamcheese filling, I used about 50% more eggnog, 2x rum, a dash of nutmeg instead of a pinch, and about the same with cinnamon (which I added) -- -- For the results, it turned out Absolutely AMAZING. I had SO much more creamcheese mix than I knew what to do with it, so I put as much as I could on it before throwing it in the oven... and the rest I stored away in a small butter bowl. It rose beautifully. The cake was light, creamy, fluffy, smooth, and just down right heavenly. -- And considering how I only had a single slice & any and all trace remains were nowhere to be found, I think my family thought the same.  -- Next time I will either use two pans, or I'll try and use a springform pan to see how well that'll work. -- Thank You Bill Sinclair!!!!

I have a difficulty rating this recipe, so I think 3 stars will be a common rating from my family. This was just a not bad cheesecake for us, but we didn`t enjoy it and didn`t love it as some other cheesecakes I made before. I love eggnog, but realized I didn`t enjoy eggnog flavor in the cheesecake. I had no problems with undone middle, I baked it for an hour. I think it depends on eggnog you are using (milk based eggnog, sweetened condensed milk based etc.). I have eggnog with sweetened condensed milk, so used less flour. Maybe it was the reason, we didn`t like the texture of this cheesecake, it literally melts in your mouth and it is very curdy. The taste was just nothing special too. But thanks for the recipe anyway.

This cheesecake is heavenly.  This recipe made two using purchased graham cracker crusts.  I followed the recipe exactly except added more than a pinch of nutmeg and sprinkled nutmeg on top of the cheesecakes before baking.  They look beautiful and taste even better.  Thank you Bill for submitting this recipe.

I have been making cheesecakes for many years but this one is by far the BEST cheesecake I've ever made. Baked it in a water bath. Turned off the oven after 50 minutes, opened the oven door and let it sit in there for an additional ten minutes or so. Turned out perfectly -lightly golden and no cracks! Tasted heavenly. Thank you for this recipe!

This is an excellent cheesecake but I did take advice from the other reviewers and used more eggnog (1 cup) and nutmeg (1/2 tsp) and I also used a gingersnap crust. Everyone at my Christmas party raved on and on!

I made this cheesecake for our Christmas Eve family get together. Everyone loved it. I don't like eggnog, but this had a better taste.  I found that it took longer to bake than recipe calls for, approx. 5-8 min. more.  I will definitely make it again.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I have made this 3 times now, and even the people that are hesitant about eggnog, still rave over it.   I follow the recipe to a "T" and it turns our wonderful every time.  Maybe a little less rum if you are feeding kids (there's not much in there but they swear they can taste it).

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was sooooo delicious!  Smooth, creamy, and flavorful.  My husband and I took a bite and were in cheesecake heaven. I'm making 3 today in preparation for Christmas.  I agree with adding a bit more eggnog if you really like the flavor (like we do).  I use cinnamon graham crackers for the crust but am trying one with a gingersnap crust.

Sounds yummy! I want to try this one. Has anyone tried using Coffee-Mate's Eggnog creamer instead of eggnog? I know that the flavor wouldn't be quite as strong but I am not a big fan of real eggnog and would not be able to use up the left overs. I do buy the creamer though.

Great cheesecake!  I used my leftover homemade eggnog, which had Everclear in it.  I made it for a New Year's Eve party that I was attending and when it came out of the oven, it was so flat that I almost decided to trash it.  I didn't have time to make something else, so I took it anyway.  The next day, I had several people call and ask for the recipe because they loved it!  Glad I didn't throw it away!

I used the whole package of graham crackers and forgot to measure. So increased the butter to 4 tablespoons just to be safe. I used 2 packages of reduced fat cream cheese and 1 regular cream cheese. I also used a light eggnog. Didn't seem to have any problems with these adjustments. This cheesecake had a good consistency and was super easy to put together with the food processor. I did add some spices (1/4 teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger) to the crust like other post have mentioned. Great eggnog flavor. My only complaint is that I wish it were a taller cheesecake. Mine only came out to be about an inch tall.

yummy, i put a little extra egg nog in, and didn't really taste it. In fact, there were many people who don't care for egg nog that tried it and liked it (going back for a second piece is always a good indicator). I'm not giving it 5 stars because I don't think that this recipe was "great"

This was an amazing cheesecake! I tweeked it a bit by using 1cup egg nog and a splash more rum ;). I ended up making mini cheesecakes instead of 1 large one. It was the hit of the night. I will most definately be making this again and again and again :)

Delicious. Made it for Christmas dinner and my parents loved it. I made 11 servings which called for exactly two packages of cream cheese and fit almost perfectly into one pie pan. I had a little left over that I mixed with pecans (yummy). I wish I would have whipped the cream cheese like some people suggested but I didn't have a food processor. Also, I think it could've used even more rum or vanilla extract (if that's what you would rather use). Next time I will make some sort of topping, perhaps with pecans or something. Didn't particularly need it but I think it would be good. I will definitely make this again! I may even try a vegan version someday.

WOW.  I did add a dash of nutmeg to the graham crackers, and I used 1 Tbsp of vanilla instead of the rum (we just aren't big fans of rum).  It came out truly fantastic.  My husband is still talking about how great it was.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  I made this recipe exactly as called for and everyone loved it.  The only change was that I found the baking time wasn't long enough in my oven and I let it bake for an extra 10 minutes just until it was set but still soft to the touch.  It did crack - next time I'll do the water bath - but I just covered the top with strawberries sprinkled with icing sugar which made it sort of Christmas-y.

Instead of adding the nutmeg to the recipe I added 1/2 tsp to the crust and then sprinkled pumpkin pie spice into the filling.  I also used 1 tablespoon dark rum instead of 2 T rum.

I make this every Christmas, and it's always a hit. I usually substitute 3 tsp rum extract for the actual rum, if I don't have any on hand. Be sure to do a water bath to avoid a cracked cake, and I find I can usually shorten the cooking time by about 4-5 minutes; this may be due to the water bath or my oven. Just don't overcook! You want the center to be set, but still a little soft. Thanks for this excellent recipe!

Taste was pretty good...used 1 c. eggnog, about 1/2 cinnamon graham crackers and 1/2 gingersnaps for the crust, added a couple dashes of nutmeg to both the crust and batter.  Cheesecake cracked, so I made a topping for it--8 oz. cool whip with a dash of vanilla, 2 tbl spiced rum, and a few dashes of nutmeg...this topping ended up being really sweet, which, unfortunately, made the tanginess of the cheesecake stand out...so I might add a tad more splenda (I didn't use real sugar) next time.  Used 2 fat free and 1 reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat egg nog, and the texture was still fabulously creamy.

What a great recipe! I took some other people's suggestions and added nutmeg and cinnamon to the rust. I also don't have a food processor big enough for the job so I just used room temp cream cheese and put some elbow grease into mixing it. I also baked it in a water bath, I just put foil around the bottom of the spring pan. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I'll definitely be making another one for Christmas.

I brought this to my work party and people loved it.  Foil coated the pan and I did not cook it in water and the cheesecake came out great.  I only cracked when I flipped it because I didn't wait for it to cool longer.  I also added ginger and cinnamon to the crust and it gave it a Christmas feel.  Also, it's pretty easy to make.

I made this cheesecake for a christmas party last year, (my first cheesecake I ever made), I couldn't believe how easy it was to make and how wonderful it tasted.  Friends are asking me to make it for the party again this year, this time I will be adding cinnamon & nutmeg in the crust.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I made this exact recipe for Christmas last year, and the ENTIRE thing was gone.  It was fantastic!  For a beginner cheesecake maker, it was really easy too!  I've already been told its a MUST on my table again this year!  Thanks so much for posting the recipe!

Good flavor though heavier than we prefer. To lighten it, I added 8 oz whipped cream to fold in before baking.  I also didn't have to bake it near as long as suggested in this recipe. I sprinkled alittle nutmeg on top for presentation only.  :o)

Best cheesecake I ever had.  Really could not taste the eggnog, I have to say, but it was delicious and creamy.  A big hit with a large extended family at Christmas.  I'll make this again.

I wish I could give this 10 stars. My boyfriend is still talking about how great it was.  I made it twice over the holiday season, both times to rave reviews. My roommate even wanted me to make one to take back home with her! :) This was a wonderful recipe. I did add 1/4 tsp each of ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon to the crust. Will be at our Christmas parties for years to come :) Thank you so much!

This was a big hit over Christmas with our guests. Very tasty, however it didn't seem to have enough of that Eggnog flavor for my liking. So next time I think I'd like to add more eggnog. I also used the recipe for the rum caramel sauce from the Eggnog Cheesecake II... it was yummy!

I added a little more eggnog and then made the extra batter into minitures in a cupcake pan, they were a huge hit at work.

AMAZING cheesecake! I cannot tell you how many of these I have made. I made it for Christmas this years, and ended up making one for each guest to bring home! It's rich, creamy and delicious. Also a plus, my brother HATES egg nog, but still loved the cheesecake. So it is really good for all your guests, even egg nog haters :]

The cheesecake was ABSOLUTELY excellent! Everyone at Christmas dinner loved it!  I followed some other people's recommendation and used an entire cup of eggnog.  The crust is fantastic and works well against the cheesecake.

My first attempt at cheesecake.  Very easy, and not too time consuming!  I did this the short cut method and used 1/2 recipe with a pre-made graham crust... didn't want to do a huge production my first attempt.  This turned out VERY good.  Got raves from my mother-in-law even.  May even try the full production next time I make it... but, I will definately make this in some way, shape, or form again!

YUMMO!!!  This is ABSOLUTELY the best cheesecake recipe I have ever made!!!  Thank you!  I will definitely make it again and again.  It doesn't have a very strong eggnog taste, but the creamy texture is out of this world.  We like DiSarono with our eggnog, so I used that instead of rum.

I've made my share of cheesecakes & I must say-this is by far the best cheesecake recipe I've ever come across! Would give it 10 stars if I could. My grandma, who never eats desserts, was blown away by this at Christmas.  Modifications: used a gingersnap cookie crust (since I had the food processor out, I figured why not grind up some cookies) and 2 teaspoons of imitation rum extract (on accident). Entire family DEVOURED it. Had to fight an uncle for the last sliver. Great recipe Bill!

This was divine!  I made it with 2/3 low fat cream cheese and 1/3 regular and it still tasted rich and creamy.  I also took another reviewer's suggestion and added come cinnamon and nutmeg to the graham cracker crust.  This has become a staple for Christmas dessert.

This recipe had a nice flavor; it wasn't as firm as I expected but everyone enjoyed it. I used a cinnamon graham cracker crust and thought that was a nice combination. It did crack when I loosened the sides of the spring form pan, so I just topped it with whipped topping and sprinkled nutmeg on top. To be honest, I thought it would be a little more elegant. I'm a great baker, and people always fight to take my desserts home with them; no one wanted to take this home, so I don't know that I would make it again. It didn't really have the consistency that I associate with cheesecake, too soft. It was nice, but not a knockout, and for Christmas, I want a knockout.

This cheesecake was AMAZING! My boyfriend is "not really a fan of cheesecake" and "just wanted to try a bite or two" but I had to fight his fork off of my cheesecake.
I used alcoholic eggnog (the kind you buy at the liquor store, that comes with bourbon in it) since that was all I had, and left out the rum... came out delicious. I agree with other users who recommended using cinnamon graham crackers, did that and it came out delicious. Also recommend giving it a light sprinkling of nutmeg just before putting it in the oven; makes it look pretty and more obviously eggnog

This was such a huge success! I took some suggestions and added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust, added an extra 1/4 cup eggnog, and made the filling in a food processor. It turned out so well! It firmed up perfectly and there were no cracks, and it was so incredibly smooth! I took it to work and my coworkers just devoured it. I've been getting compliments all day! I will definitely make this again!

I made this for a group of girlfriends who were coming over for a Christmas party.  I didn't have any rum on hand so I used amaretto instead.  Also used cinnamon graham crackers as suggested.  Many said this was the best cheesecake they ever had!  : )

This was easy and delicious. It received great reviews from my friends and family! I used the food processor and everything turned out well--but it split as it was cooling. I hated to do it, but I spread coolwhip on it so it would cover the huge crack, then ground a little fresh nutmeg on top. The coolwhip was barely noticeable and it was a lovely dessert.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was such a hit! I already plan to make it for Christmas as well. I did cheat and use a store bought crust and it was still wonderful. If you do that you will have some leftover mixture. I will see next time if I can stretch it into two crusts. This time I just baked the leftover mixture in a small casserole dish, so that we could taste it before bringing it to Thanksgiving. It was even delicious right out of the oven and warm. You may want to plan on making some mini cakes if you use the store bought crust. 
   I also just used my hand held mixer instead of a food processor. I just made sure to blend everything with a large spoon and once you add in the eggnog and eggs it is not too thick for a regular mixer. Great recipe!

I made this recipe and tried it out on the guys I work with  They absolutely loved it.  It's not as firm as i would have liked but you should be able to just cook it a little longer.  I didn't have any rum but it still turned out great.

Great cheesecake!  Your had better like eggnog before you make this one. I used fresh grated nutmeg and grated a little more over the top of the cake before serving. Very creamy texture. For the bakers that stated this did not taste like eggnog , I suggest using quality eggnog and fresh nutmeg.

Very good cheese cake.  I needed to bake it about 5 min more than recommended time.  I used an extra T. spoon of rum, an extra half pinch of nutmeg, quality commercially prepared eggnog and (my favorite adjustment)--special edition gingerbread graham crackers by honey maid.  It was well liked at our Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful. Rave reviews.  It's the first cheesecake I've ever tried to make that required baking and it's definately the best I've ever had. Spray the sides of the pan with vegetable spray before pouring in the filling to make removing the outer ring easier.  I didn't even try until I had transported the desert the following day and had no problems.

This is a 5 star cheesecake but I only gave it 4 stars because it just didn't take "eggnoggy" at all to me or my guests.  I followed the recipe to a t except I used a standup  mixer and extra nutmeg and baked with a water bath.  The water bath helped with the cracking but still had one big crack.

It tasted rich and delicious and I will certainly make again but was disappointed somewhat that it did not taste more like eggnog---next time I will follow another reviewers advice and add more eggnog.

Overall it was a delicious treat on our holiday day!!!!! Seasons Greetings and thanks for a good recipe!!!

This was the first cheesecake I ever made, and it turned out pretty well. I ended up increasing the eggnog by 1/4 cup, adding maybe 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg instead of a pinch, and baking 10 minutes longer with a bowl of water in the oven, and had no issues with cracks. Everyone who tried it seemed to like it (and several people said it was good with cherry topping). I personally thought the eggnog flavor didn't stand out as well as I would have liked, but I'm not sure how to improve it. I think it needs some sort of topping  to offset the cheesecake flavor, but I'm not a die hard fan of cheesecake, so that may just be me. Thanks for the recipe!

This is absolutely everything I hoped for! I have wanted to make an eggnog cheesecake for years and just found this recipe. Made it last night and couldn't wait till after Thanksgiving dinner to taste it. It is incredible! 

Anyone who loves eggnog has to make this. 

Thank you for this recipe.

Good cheesecake!  Very creamy and smooth ( I beat everything together with electric beaters) However we found it lacking in eggnog flavour for our Christmas dessert. Would make again

This recipe also make for great cupcakes for individual desserts!  i accidentally put a half tablespoon more of rum than the recipe asked for and was left with a runny cake after the specified time,  so beware if you add more liquid cook it longer.  absolutely wonderful and a new favorite!!!!! must try this easy to make cheesecake!!!

Good cheesecake however I increased the eggnog to 1 cup and I could taste litle clumps of the flour when it was finished.  Also I used grushed gingersnaps instead of gram crackers for the crust.

This cheesecake was delicious. It is very rich, so a little goes a long way. I loved the eggnog flavor and the fact that it is made with prepared eggnog. I topped it with whipped cream. It is a great Christmas dessert.

I have made two years in a row. The best I have ever made, the add of Cinnamon and Nutmeg in the crust is just right, it's like eating Eggnog. I will make it again and again.

This seemed to be a hit on Christmas Eve. I think the eggnog taste was too subtle - next time I would add a little more nog and rum. Tasted really good with fresh whipped cream and cinnamon sprinkle.

I made this last Christmas and it was fabulous.  This year I’m trying a different recipe for a cheesecake and I’m hoping that this one won’t be missed. 

The touch of eggnog added a lot to the flavor and even the non-cheesecake  lovers had a piece.  

Delicious!

Delicious! I did change mine a little  though. My father is gluten  intolerant, so instead of Graham crackers, I made gluten free gingersnaps and used a cup of those crushed. Turned out beautifully. I also supplemented gluten free flour for the all purpose flour in the filling. You couldn't even tell. Very good recipe!

It is wonderful.  I used 4 eggs and 3 Tablespoons of rum.  Instead of a pinch of nutmeg I gave a good shake and even grated fresh nutmeg.  Was great .

I followed the comment about cutting the recipe down to 11 but still use 1 cup (!) of eggnog. I love eggnog so went with it, but I personally had to bake for another 60 minutes for the cheesecake center to be barely firm to the touch (so total 1 hr 45 mins at 250 degrees). Idk what went wrong, maybe theres a better way to get it to cook.

But after that, it came out amazing and this is honestly the best cheesecake I've ever eaten.

Made this for the holidays some years ago.   Mom said it was by far the best cheesecake she has ever tasted.  She still talks about it, so I suppose she's hinting that I should make it again.  
This recipe is easy and it truly has "fine restaurant" appeal.

Added 1 cup of eggnog to increase eggnog flavor. Came out beautiful and delicious. Make sure to cream the cream cheese and sugar before adding other ingredients.

Decided to make this the night before a family gathering.Quick and easy recipe. Everyone loved it! Said it had enough egg nog flavor and just enough sweetness with a small kick of rum flavor. I followed others suggestions and used cup of egg nog. I used the rum and added 1/8 tsp vanilla. Funny thing is...I don't like cheesecake...lol. I tasted a small corner and liked the flavor, I just don't like eating all of that cream cheese at once. I also make a New York style cheesecake that everyone loves. A secret...I had reduced fat egg nog...no one seemed to care! :-)

It was okay, but it was not better than the sum of its parts. Honestly, I would probably rather have just a slice of regular cheesecake or a glass of eggnog.

Increased the eggnog as others suggested and increased the spices, could not taste any of it.  This cheesecake tasted like a regular ol cheesecake,  it also was under cooked, even adding 10 extra mins cook time.

Everyone loves this cheesecake! I started off a few years ago making just 1. This year I've already made 3 and have two more to make for the holidays. 

I'm getting the water bath down like some other reviews so that it doesn't crack but the cheesecake is delicious either way. I put just a bit more eggnog in than the recipe calls for but still less than a cup. And 4-6 tablespoons of a higher end rum. Absolutely amazing!

Like many of the other reviewers, I thought that the cheesecake needed a more 'eggnoggy' flavor .  I should have read more reviews before making it.  I plan to add vanilla and cinnamon, and a touch more nutmeg next time.   The cheesecake was very  attractive and true to the recipe's cooking instructions. I wouldn't change any of the basic ingredients in the recipe, except to amp up the background spices.

I like this recipe. I definitely felt the need to add more spices to the mix (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice). I suggest not taking the cake out of the springform pan immediately after removing it from the oven. The cake will fall and form big cracks on the top. I covered the cracks with an eggnog flavored topping, but next time I will just avoid them all together.

Hands down the best cheesecake I’ve ever made! I like the fact the filling is only halfway up the pan so you’re not stuffed. The only thing I will change the next go around is the crust. One cup of graham crackers was not enough. Maybe I’ll try 1.5 cups. And I used Markers Mark instead of rum.

I added less sugar in the crust (used sweet graham crackers), 5/8 cup sugar and 5/8 cup eggnog in the actual cheesecake itself, replaced the rum with vanilla and added a few dashes of cinnamon and cloves! Pretty good!

I made this with the changes others suggested; upped the eggnog to 1 cup and made a gingerbread crust. It gets raves every year! I also wrapped the bottom of the pan in tin foil and baked it in a cookie pan with a little water in it . When it was done I turned off the oven and left it in the oven with the door cracked until cooled. Refrigerated overnight in the pan because I didn't want the top to get mushed with tin foil (although when you put whipped cream on top you can't see any imperfections anyway) and came out perfect for Thanksgiving  meal the next afternoon.

Lovely cheesecake!  I did read the reviews & made a few adjustments.  I used ginger cookies for the base, plus some cinnamon & nutmeg with only 1/2 cup of sugar blended with the butter.  In the filling my only change was adding a full cup of egg nog, and again I put in half the sugar the recipe called for.

Used recipe as is..  found I had to cook a lot longer than suggested.  I think next time I will use a smaller spring pan (8”) so the cheesecake comes out taller.
Flavor was delicious.!

New holiday family favourite !  Followed recipe to the letter first time.  Beautiful!  On our second time we cut back the rum by half, used 1 full cup of nog rather than 3/4 , made the crust using ginger snap cookies rather than graham, then to top it off served it with a touch of warmed rum butter sauce on the side for our adult guests. Cooked perfectly both times, no cracks, I always use a bain-marie, very pleased with results.

I made this with a gluten free ginger snap crust, and substituted gluten free flour.  After the 10 minutes at 425, and 45 minutes at 250 it was still essentially cheesecake soup.  It took an additional 30 minutes to cook!!  Other than the gf flour substitution and crust type, I didn’t make any other changes. Why did mine take so much longer than the recipe called?!  My oven seems to cook everything else within normal recipe times. So this was quite odd. But it tasted good, and it got good reviews from my family.  I think I could have used more than just a pinch of nutmeg.

I also made the caramel pecan sauce for it-it was delicious.  My family ate the whole thing on X-Mas Eve, even the people who don't like eggnog loved it.  The Grandkids also loved it.

I didn’t add the rum. The flavor of the eggnog was slight but noticeable. It did crack when I opened the spring form pan as per the instructions. That did disappoint me as it effected how I wanted to present the finished cheesecake. I’ve gotten lots of positive reviews from friends and family.

I didn't have Rum so substituted Bourbon.  It was soooo creamy and yummy!  As suggested, cream the cream cheese by itself first until real creamy.  It makes a big difference, IMO. Thanks Bill.  This will be a tradition in my family for Christmas.

I didn't make any changes as I'd never made a cheese cake before; however, I did realize I needed to allow the cream cheese to soften longer than I did as it was a bear trying to mix! It turned out great everyone loved it and I will make it again!

My husband loves cheesecake. And during Christmastime, he drinks all the eggnog he can get.
Needless to say, this  combo of the two was a hit . 
I think he finished most of it himself in 3 Days!
Definitely will make again.

This was a big hit at my party. I used vanilla wafer crumbs instead of graham crackers crumbs for crust. Also added cinnamon to the crust. Used light eggnogg  & neufchâtel cream cheese, with a little extra rum! Very creamy!

My two favorite things came together in one delicious dish!! For those eggnog lovers with none on hand you can, as I did, add 2 tsp of vanilla extract 2 tsp of cinnamon then substitute the ¾ cup of eggnog with 1 cup heavy cream and add in an extra 3 egg yolks. Then, for an extra unique creaminess I take the 1 cup of sugar down to ¾ cup white sugar and toss in ¼ of light brown sugar. It comes out like a dream and mirrors the delicious Vanilla Spiced eggnog flavor that I love!

Awesome cheesecake and good instructions.  The first time I made it I just added a scant 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon to the graham crust and made sure I pressed it down firmly.  That little added suggestion by others made the base sing.  I upped the eggnog to 1 cup as per others and since we don't use alcohol I used 3/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp rum extract as a substitute.  I'm sure the rum is good also.  I didn't change any of the other ingredients except when I came to add the eggs I did this last and with a wooden spoon just gently folded them in.  Everyone loved this recipe and wanted more so 2 days later I have made another.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Made this for Christmas along with two others.  This was the strong favorite.  Delicious & easy to make.    I made it almost exactly as stated in the recipe but I put a bit of cinnamon in the crust & used a little more eggnog.  It came out perfect!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family thinks this is the best dessert ever!! Made it exactly as the recipe says and served with whipped cream. My food processor is too small to make it in so I used my hand mixer. Used the processor to crush the graham crackers.

Made this for Christmas and was disappointed!   NO flavor
of eggnog what so ever.......it was fine for just a regular
cheesecake, but nothing special!   I added chopped pecans
into crust ingredients which was a nice addition.
Will look for another "eggnog" recipe for the future........

I have made several cheesecakes over the years, thought this would be the perfect one for the holidays.  Made it according to directions.  I have to say the baking temp. & time was a little  scary to me.  To bake something at such a low temp & for that long ....just didn't seem right!  But I followed exactly.  It was one of the best & creamiest cheesecakes I have ever made!  Think I will consider baking all my cheesecakes like this.

I made it for Christmas Day and everyone raved about it.  Comments I heard were,  "creamy, delicious, just the right amount of sweet, yum, more please".   This recipe is a keeper.  I followed the recipe ingredients as published.  I also placed a pie plate with hot water on the shelf below the cheesecake  while it cooked instead of Bain-Marie (water bath) .  It looked professionally made.  Since eggnog is a seasonal item in stores I  searched and saved recipe so I can make it other times.

I made this recipe but changed it (because of tasting one made with Rum Chatta at TASTE OF MADISON in Madison, WI last fall.  I added 3/4 cups of rum chatta instead of eggnog, and made the crust of half crushed graham crackers and half crushed  cinnemon toast crunch cereal.  The I topped each slice with 3 whole pieces of cinnemon toast crunch cereal with about 3-4 drops of rum chatta on it.  WOW!!!

Hubby said it was one of  the best desserts he'd ever eaten.
I did not have any rum, so I added more eggnog to compensate for the liquid.  I used a store bought Graham cracker pie shell as I do not own a spring form pan.   It was incredible!!

This was delicious! It was a huge hit at Christmas. I didn't give it 5 stars because I made a few modifications so I don't know what it's like as written. I made the crust out of ginger snaps. Used about a cup and a half of crumbs and 4 tablespoons of butter. I added 3/4 tsp of cinnamon.  I used vanilla instead of rum. Following the suggestions of others I made the cheesecake the day before. Delicious!!

This is an exceptional cheesecake!  I'd never made one before thinking it was pretty hard to do but this was easy and delicious!  When I took it out of the oven, I loosened the spring form pan as instructed.  It immediately cracked, I mean seriously cracked, from the middle.  I did as another person suggested when it happened to her and whipped up some cream with a little creme fraiche so it would stand up nicely and crushed soft candy canes on to the top.  No one ever knew about the fissure!  Rave reviews!  I will make this again substituting different flavors.

This was my first time making a baked cheesecake and it turned out fantastic.  I only. Used 2 packages of creamed cheese and increased the Eggnog to 1 cup as well as adding cinnamon. I used digestive biscuits instead of graham crackers for the crumb because that's how we do cheesecake in England and I prefer it that way. My husband loved this cheesecake, he was really impressed.  I think it will be a Christmas staple every year from now on!

I liked the flavor of the cheesecake but I must have done something wrong.  The cheesecake never baked completely in the center.  When I sliced it, it looked like melting ice cream..... So very sad when it was served as dessert for Christmas dinner.

This was delicious! I was worried that the eggnog flavor would be too mild to notice, but this was not the case! I followed the recipe with just a couple of minor changes. I used a full of cup of eggnog (I wanted to make sure the flavor was there), and I used freshly grated nutmeg, about 1/4 teaspoon. The flavor and texture of the cheesecake were fantastic. I did make the cheesecake two days before it was to be eaten and I think this allowed the flavors of the eggnog, rum, and nutmeg to meld. The texture was creamy and smooth, not heavy and dense like a new york-style cheesecake. Everyone raved about it and there was a minor tussle of the last piece! LOL I will definitely make this again!

This was a good cheesecake but not great. It seemed too flat. I'll try a smaller pan next time. Used Trader Joe's eggnog (excellent) and poured myself a glass while the cake was baking. Nice way to pass an afternoon!  PdL

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  I don't even like cheesecake but I thought it was really good.  My nutmeg was stale so I also added ground cloves.  Not sure if it made a difference.  The taste of eggnog is not obvious, it just has a pleasant balance of sweet and cream cheese.  The advice to use a food processor is important to make it smooth.

I followed the instructions with the following exceptions.  I increased the egg nog to 1 cup and was generous with the nutmeg (freshly grated).  When "loosening the cheesecake from the pan," don't undo the latch on the springform pan!  This will crack the dessert.  What the recipe means is run a knife around the edges.  After the cheesecake has fully cooled, then remove the pan.  Also, don't cool too quickly (i.e. put it in the fridge too soon), or it will crack.

Tasted great. Cooked in 425 for ten minutes and then turned oven down to 250 just as recipe said to do. I also put a pan of water below on the lower rack after reading other reviews. After the set time, I turned the oven off and opened oven door. I let it sit in the oven like that for another 45 minutes. I didn't use a spring form pan. I just used a deep dish pie plate. The cheesecake did crack but it didn't matter because I smeared a thin layer of cool whip over the top and lightly sprinkled with nutmeg.  Changes in recipe I made were adding 1 1/4 cups of Prairie farms eggnog light,  three tablespoons of flour,  1/2 tsp of nutmeg,  and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. It was my first time making a cheesecake and I was really nervous, especially not using the special pan, but it turned out perfectly! Thank you for the recipe!!!

I don't like eggnog but this cheesecake was delicious.  I mixed with a mixer and poured into 2 premade graham cracker crusts.  I used rum extract (don't keep the real stuff in the house).  Very good!

Awsome taste. I added 1 pack extra of cream cheese, an extra egg, an extra 3 ounces of cream cheese, and 1 and a half cups off nog instead of the 3/4 cup. The idea of using a food processor for the cream cheese outstanding but as the cream cheese 8oz at a time so you don't over work your processor. The extra 3oz of cheese is good cause a lot of the cheese will stick to the sides. I also added extra fresh ground nutmeg on the top before putting in the oven. Absolutely delicious

Did not change anything,  would make again. The only problem was making the grandcracker  crust stick to the side of the spring pan.

I used chocolate wafers for the crust this added a richer flavor to go with the Eggnog.  A little extra eggnog for deeper flavor is also a good idea.  Rum or rum extract just enhances the undertone of the dessert.  remember the focus is on the Eggnog.  Only thing I would have like is a fluffier higher recipe.
I prefer a creamy constancy.

Unique tasting cheesecake,  it is good and I am sure the taste will vary by the brand of eggnog used. I used Southern Comfort traditional  flavor egg nog since I chose to use spice rum this time around.  I have to admit a couple of mistakes, but they did not impact how good the cake is. First, I left out the flour completely, this made for a more pudding like consistency the first day, but as another reviewer stated, this cheesecake tastes better the second day. It not only had more flavor but the cake took on the more traditional cheesecake consistency. Second, being a novice baker, I bought the pre-made graham cracker pie shells. There was enough filling for two store bought pie shells! I ran out and bought a second shell. Needless to say, apparently this is a hard recipe to mess up.

I didn't really make this (yet). I'm not a fan of rum so I'm wondering if I could substitute a couple teaspoons of vanilla and maybe increase the eggnog a little. Thanks.

This was my first attempt ever at making cheesecake and this recipe made it easy! The flavor was awesome and it looked great. My only issue was the crust was too crumbly for my taste; a lot of it fell off when I had to transfer it to a container for transporting. 

I made a few beginner errors that I will know to correct next time - leaving more time for it to cool, etc.  I will definitely make this again!

I love this cheesecake because it's so creamy.  However, it doesn't have a strong eggnog flavor.  I added one tsp of vanilla which is probably why it tasted like a vanilla cheesecake...but super delicious anyway.

First time I mixed cheesecake ingredients in a processor. The finished product came out really creamy. I didn't have graham cracker crumbs so I substituted processed ginger snap cookies and I used vanilla instead of rum. The alcohol in the egg nog that I used...Evan Williams...was plenty.

I give this cheesecake 4.5 stars.  I felt the flavor was lacking in the eggnog richness I had hoped for.  I made a gingersnap cookie crust instead of the graham cracker crust, and it was very good.  My husband loved this cheesecake.  It's best when it is very cold.

Made this cheesecake with the following changes  added 1 tbls bourbon baked at 325 for 60 min turned oven off and cracked the door open let sit in there for about 1 hour took out and cooled on rack the rest of the way then put in frig overnight. Left me with what turned out to be a creamy flavorful cheesecake with no crack at all so pretty had to post two pics.  With my changes I would rate a 10.

Made a Gluten Free version.  The only changes I made were 2 TBSP of corn starch vs. the flour since that works better as a substitute than GF flour for cheesecake.  Also I couldn't find GF Graham Crackers in the store, so I used crushed ginger snap cookies, which I think adds a lot more flavor than graham crackers anyway.  Also, instead of whipped cream, I used a simple 2 cups sour cream, 1/3 cup sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla on top and threw it back in the oven for 8 minutes to set.  One change I noted is that the cooking time wasn't enough.  I went a good 55 min after dropping to 250, plus the additional 8 minutes of time with the topping on.  I also put the water bath in a pan on the rack under the cheesecake vs. submersing the spring form pan.  Just as easy, less messy, and no chance of leaks.  I also lined the bottom and sides with parchment (Alton Brown shows this in a video).  No mess, no cracks and easier cleanup.  Excellent recipe and a real winner!

I made this cheesecake a few days ago and I thought it was absolutely delicious. I ate the whole thing myself! I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys cheesecake and the light, subtle flavor of eggnog.

**As a precursor, I live at 7,000 feet elevation. The following change may only help those baking at high elevation.**
I followed the directions exactly, except for the cooking time. After turning the oven down to 250 degrees, I fell asleep and woke up thirty minutes after I was supposed to have taken it out. I thought I had ruined it, but decided to wrap it up and try it the next morning. the consistency was perfect for a cheesecake and it was cooked all the way through. If you plan on making this recipe, I would definitely suggest baking it for an extra 30 - 40 minutes.

Also, as a side note, the graham cracker crust was only enough for a bottom crust, so if you like the back of your pie to have a crust too, I'd suggest using 1.5 cups of graham cracker crumbs.

I'm finding it hard to figure out what to rate this. I used 6 individual springform pans instead of a regular one and I usually have to make a cheesecake recipe once or twice before I get the cooking times converted right. A few of mine cracked quite a bit, which I usually never have problems with but that could be the pans I used. My biggest complaint was that I didn't get much eggnog taste. I even added a little more and an extra tablespoon of rum. I still rated it 4 stars because the flavor was really good. Even overcooked a little bit, it was super moist with great flavor, just not eggnog. Funny thing was, I tasted the batter before pouring and it was incredible, only leading to my final disappointment. I might try again with a different eggnog and see if that helps.

This was my first cheesecake from scratch.  I was worried but the family loved it.  A little sweet. Will cut down on some of the sugar next time.  Rum- added only 1 Tbsp. I think it should have cooked maybe 5 more minutes?  Very tasty though.

I make a different flavor of cheese cake every year for christmas!  When searching for this years flavor I stumbled upon this one and tried it!  So glad I did...amazing!  Only thing I did different was instead of using regular eggnog I used cinnamon eggnog...absolutely delicious!  My husband who doesn't like eggnog at all was disappointed I picked this as this years flavor...I asked him to sample the batter and he said "wow if the cheesecake is as good as that when it's done that is a winner for sure!"  Needless to say he loved the cheesecake too!  Merry Christmas!

Absolutely Fantastic!!! I only had a 10" spring form pan so i had to add a bit more graham crackers and butter (maybe 1/3 of a cup or so). I cooked it in the oven with the same instructions but for 40 min for the last part. Thanks for the Recipe!!!!

Excellent cheesecake, delicate taste of eggnog, smooth and delicious.  I made chocolate icing to spread on top (4 oz bitter sweet chocolate microwave for 1 min, then add 1/3 cup of whipping cream and microwave for another 1 min).  It was decadent but quite rich.

This cheesecake was really good.  However, it was not as creamy and fluffy as I would've liked it.  There's something missing.  I did up the egg nog to 1 cup and the rum to 4 tablespoons to give it more egg nog flavour.  I also replaced the crust with a gingersnap cookie crust.  Pairing the cheesecake with a nutmeg whipped cream was divine.

I would've given this recipe five stars, but I made it a second time, and now I'm torn. 

The first time, it worked great. (I added a little extra nutmeg to the crust and filling, and used a whole tiny airline bottle of dark rum.) The filling was smooth, fluffy and delicious. 

The second time, it didn't set. I had to put it back in the oven for another hour at 250, and after it cooled, it was UGLY. It had a huge dent in the center, and deep, canyonlike cracks. It looked like it had been hit with a meteor. And the crust... omg, gloppy goo. Still, it tasted great. I must have done something wrong the second time, but I can't imagine what that could have been. The worst part was, since the first one worked so beautifully, I had promised the second one to my husband for his office Christmas party. It just about killed me to send him off with a cheesecake that ugly. Really embarrassing.

I guess my point is, this is a wonderful cheesecake, but it might not be the best one to make "under pressure." Have a Plan B.

Awesome recipe. The eggnog can be substituted for so many things to make different flavors!

I made the recipe Exactly as listed, and my husband said it was the best one I made. I on the other hand was concerned it wasnt cooked enough. When I cut into it the centre was still slightly runny.

I made this with a gingersnap crust instead.  I should have cooked it longer...it was not cooked enough in the middle.  I topped with with whipped cream and cinnamon.  It seemed to need a little more flavor, maybe more rum?  :)

I liked this but it wasn't anything to write home about.  I would rather just have some eggnog and some regular cheesecake.  No need to combine them.

This was a very good Cheesecake.My whole
family liked it.I took the tip from one
reviewer,and added 1/4 teaspoon each of
cinnamon and Nutmeg,and sugar to the
Graham Cracker crust,and the mixture.
After I made the crust I just put it in
the freezer.The crust doesn't need to go
in the oven.Putting the crust in the oven
will get the crust into the mixture of
the cake.I didn't have any rum,so I added
1/4 cup Kahula and 1/2 cup Eggnog,to the
mixture.I also put a pan of water directely under the Cheesecake,to keep it from cracking.I couldn't taste the
Eggnog.I think the Kahula may have overrode it.I am going to try to make
another Eggnog Cheesecake,before all the
Eggnog leaves the stores.This recipe is
really to die for.

This was just so so for me and my husband. The flavor didn't wow us and we both love eggnog. I used cinnamon graham crackers, added nutmeg to the crust and added a bit more eggnog then called for. It was very creamy, but almost too much. Didn't set like any other cheesecake I have made before. I don't think I will be making this one again.

I can only do four stars because I was forced to make changes due to supermarket availability and holiday headache shopping. Overall this was great and disappeared. I had to use soy eggnog because all local stores were out of regular and this is all i could find, and was too stressed to go back to the store for rum when I found out I didn't have some like I thought I did. I substituted rum for vanilla extract like reviews suggested. The overall result it didn't set as well as it should (probably the soy) and didn't taste very eggnoggy in my opinion, and cracked worse than any cheesecake I've made previous, but as I stated earlier it disappeared. Would probably give it five stars if I had all the right ingredients.

ok..wont make again.  Taste and texture was ok...it might have to do with eggnog ...just not a big fan, so why was i making it anyway?  I did enjoy that the crust actually adhered to the cake and not the bottom of the pan.   If u like eggnog u will probably like this.  I used Pirate Rum.....great rum for baking has a very vanilla anise flavor.  I had a merry christmas anyway!  haha

Cheesecake had the consistency of a no-bake cheesecake. I have baked many cheesecakes before and have never had any turn out with the texture this one had. Baked exactly according to directions. Won't make again.

Used big mixer to mix ingredients, food processor wasnt big enough. Followed directions but cake still came out with a huge crack on top so I wrapped it up tightly with tin foil and let it sit in refrig overnight. Although it was very attractive looking it tasted great and everybody love it especially with some Redi Whip on top.

Eggnog flavor was masked, not very sweet, and required extra baking time with the oven set at 250.  Next time I will stick with my standard cheesecake recipe.
