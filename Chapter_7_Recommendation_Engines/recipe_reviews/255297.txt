Yes one dish protein and vegetables gluten-free but this would have been so much better and quicker as a stir-fry. 55 minutes in the oven plus the prep time is a bit long for a week night. Interesting flavor and I enjoyed the crunch of the cashews and the celery but putting the rice in a separate pot would have ensured it all cooked and a quick stir-fry would have kept the peppers nice and crunchy too. If I decide to stir-fry it I will thicken the sauce with a bit of arrowroot to keep it gluten-free. I prepared exactly as written including the cooking time and temperature except for one thing: I forgot to garnish with scallions because they did not appear in the ingredient list. They might have helped the appearance but I didn't miss the flavor.

I have to give this recipe top marks because it is one of the first gluten-free/dairy free recipes that I have tried. It was easy and yummy! I would double the rice to ensure there is enough food for 4 though. Everything was good. Peppers and celery stayed tasty. Spices mingled well. Cashews added separately was perfect. Going to cook it for friends who are gluten/dairy intolerant now. Thanks!!

This recipe is great, but in future I think I will add some more soy and some pineapple to the fluid mixture (I also added a bit of sesame oil) and marinate the chicken in it over night, as it didnâ€™t take on a lot of the flavor. The rice part is fantastic though.
