Cute recipe and a nice twist on the classic "Ants on a Log". I didn't have raspberry flavored cream cheese so I just mixed som light cream cheese with raspberry jam - YUMMY!

What a great idea.  It's so simple and yet I haven't heard of doing this before now.  My kids love dried cranberries and this will be frequently given at snack time now.  Thanks!

I made this with an afterschool group of primary elementary kids. We flavored our own low-fat cream cheese with strawberry fruit spread.  The kids loved the flavor - and making it themselves.

My local grocery store did not have raspberry cream cheese so I substituted strawberry.  Took them to a Memorial Day BBQ at the family's house.   They were reluctant at the start because we stuff celery with olives and cream cheese during the holiday season.   Easy to do, cute, delightfully cool on a hot day and very  tasty
