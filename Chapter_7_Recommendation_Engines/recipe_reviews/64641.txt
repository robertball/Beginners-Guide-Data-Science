Just made this with my Dad for the family tonight. VERY simple to make and VERY tasty. Left out the olives because I don't like them but definitely an amazing light entree dish. Also, I added grilled chicken and cut it in cubes and through it in the pasta dish after the pasta was warmed.

My family LOVES this salad!  I've made it at least 5 times and they always ask me to bring it to family dinners.  I do make a few changes though: 1. no olives (I don't like them).  2.  I don't bake it.  I'll cook the noodles and let them cool, mix everything together and refrigerate until we eat.

Good salad, I made exactly as written.  It is a recipe that you can tweak to your own tastes.  Next time I will use only about 10 oz of pasta with the same measurements of toppings, and fresh ground black pepper on top.  Overall, great recipe, thank you for the recipe!

Ugh, I should have not heated this. It was much better cold. Not going to make it again. I hardly ever give negative reviews here but we did not like this.

I made this and it had little flavor.  My suggestion would be to add a dressing on the side of 2 to 1 salsa & ranch.  No need to heat, serve cold with dressing.

It was not appealing or good. Warm avocado is not good and leftovers were terrible.
