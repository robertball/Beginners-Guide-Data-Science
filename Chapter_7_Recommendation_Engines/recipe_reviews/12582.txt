Great pie!!! Not to sweet, and really easy to make!  I covered the edges of the crust for the first 25 minutes.

This is the best!!  I had a similar recipe years ago from a great chocolate cookbook that I loaned my daughter (who has to have this for her birthday!) and SHE LOST IT!!    Found this and it's better than the original!!!  I don't use TO DIE FOR, but this IS!!  Everybody wants the recipe.

I had made a chocloate pecan pie several years ago.  I'd lost the recipe, but remembered how good it was.  This recipe was just what I was looking for.  Good chocolate flavor and very easy to make (even for those who don't normally make pies!)  

The only suggestion I have is to cover the pie with foil halfway through the baking time so the crust doesn't burn.

Quick tip: Use an aluminum pie shield or aluminum foil to cover the top during 1/2 the baking time.

This chocolate pecan pie is FABULOUS!! You gotta try it. It is great right out of the oven, but tastes even better the second day. It really hits the spot when you have to have something sweet & rich. Would give it 10 stars if I could!

I chopped the pecans up a little instead of using halves. Also, I only had bittersweet chocolate (recipe calls for unsweetened) but it worked out jolly good!

This is the best chocolate pecan pie around.  My family members ate it all up.  The unsweetend chocolate is a great touch.

Fabulous! I've made many a chocolate pecan pie before, but they all had chocolate chips. Melting the chocolate and mixing in gave the pie an incredibly rich flavor. I doubled the chocolate and was glad I did.

Only a four since I could not get the center to set - and ended up baking long enough to overbrown the edges. Next time I baked for an hour at 350 with foil over the edges for the last 30 minutes and it set up better without burning the edges. The flavor is wonderful, but next time I will try it with less butter and more sugar to make more of a true pecan pie with chocolate flavor. I think the 1/3 cup butter is just too much to allow the pie to set up properly.

As far as taste is concerned, this was a 5 star...BUT, I found that the directions were lacking.  You say to mix with a hand mixer, but for how long?  Till what consistency? I mixed it long enough for the batter to rise and be smooth, not really runny...when I stirred my pecans in like directed, they sank straight to the bottom.  So, I ended up putting in more pecan halves and poked at them with a toothpick until they went just ever so slightly below the surface and then baked as directed.  If I hadn't have done that, then it would have looked like a Chocolate Pie with a pecan surprise at the bottom, rather than looking like what it was supposed to be.  Other than that, like I said, it tasted brilliant but the directions are lacking too much for me to give this a five star!  If it was up to me, I would mix until well beaten and smooth.  Then I would pour pecan pieces in to just cover the batter, followed by the remainder of the batter.  I would then pour on the pecan halves and lightly poke them to just below surface level so that you can still see the pecans clearly and then bake.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I have been looking for an alternative to the super sweet gooey pecan pie that we all grew up with.  This is it.  I had so many raves that everyone asked if I had more. There are more out on this web site with milk chocolate and semi sweet but this with unsweetened is wonderful.

It really wasn't a bad pie. I guess I was disappointed because I was expecting a sticky, gooey pecan pie but with chocolate. The pie actually had more of a custard/pudding filling. Again, it was a good pie but the consistency isn't at all like traditional pecan pie.

This is a delicious-tasting pie. I adapted the recipe for a deep-dish pie so multiplied the recipe by 1 2/3, and used a combination of dark cocoa powder and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I used the 'Butter Flaky Pie Crust' recipe on this website for the crust. Since I was baking in a thick Le Creuset ceramic pie plate, my baking time was far longer at 1.5 hours! I covered it after 25 minutes in the oven because it was already quite brown and even then, the pecans around the edge of the crust, after covering, were borderline overbrowned. During baking, it puffed up beautifully to nearly 3 inches, and it still seemed a little soft in the centre when I turned off the oven, but I figured it would solidify as it cooled. The texture and taste of the pie was fabulous. As others have mentioned, there is a subtle yet distinct chocolate flavour. The next day when I sliced it, it had indeed solidified, although there was still a little tiny bit of liquid oozing out from the filling.

For the first time in quite a long time, my pie came out custardy rather than gooey.  The chocolate wasn't overdone at all (though I used semisweet chocolate instead of unsweetened), but was a nice extra note.  Great pecan pie, easy to make - a keeper.

I made this pie on Christmas Eve morning and it did not survive until dinner on Christmas day. My family ate it up and even the ones who don't eat pecan pie loved it. I happened to only have semi-sweet chocolate, but it worked great!

We loved this recipe. I made this one and a regular pecan pie for Thanksgiving. While both were great...us chocoholics fought over this one!  It has the perfect amount of chocolate for us, it didn't outshine the fact that it was a pecan pie, but you could definitely taste it.

Excellent flavor! This turned out very well. I was a little concerned when I cut into the pie and the chocolate had seperated from the pie filling a bit, but the flavor was amazing and I would definitely make again.

Fantastic!!! I was a little apprehensive trying a pecan pie, because most that I have tried before seemed a little too rich for my liking, or I've had trouble getting them to set up just right. Not this recipe!!! I followed the recipe to a T, to the point of a 25 mile round trip to the store to obtain unsweetened chocolate, when I discovered I only had semisweet.  I'm glad I did! As another reviewer commented, the chocolate was not overpowering, subtle is how I'd describe it. My filling came out the perfect consistency and the recipe seemed downright simple. I did cover my pie with tin foil after about 20 minutes of baking.  The only bad thing is....it lasted only one evening in this household of finicky eaters. I'll definitly do this again,and again and  soon!!!

This is a great tasting dessert.  Be aware that it is not super sweet like most pecan pies, and that it is more like a European style dessert.  Also, I found that the filling didn't fill the dish as much as I would have liked, so you might want to do 1 1/2 recipes or something to make more filling.  The filling for me baked into a nice layer-look with the pecans and chocolate toward the top and the syrupy-gel layer under that.  Altogether a wonderful dessert, that suited us well since we like less sweet desserts.  It felt like something from Germany!

This was a good pie, I used a Pillsbury crust - I love pecan pie & thought this would be the ultimate. It was good, but not "the best" or even great, just good.

this was such a wonderful twist to my mother's pecan pie, I could only ever eat a tiny bit of hers, but when you add the chocolate, especially if it's unsweetened it really helps take the too sweet edge of f a southern pecan pie. I fell in love with this recipe when I made it one year for Christmase and have used it ever since! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe it will hold a place in my recipe box for the long term!!

The first time I made this, it was good, but I made it in a 10" pie pan. The second time I made this I increased the recipe by roughly 1/3 and it was the best pie I have ever made--pecan or not.
I had to give the recipe to three people. I also always use more pecans when I do any pecan pie--about 1-1/2 or 2 times as much as it calls for.

Growing up I only had pecan pie a few times and I never really liked it but for some reason I really wanted to make a pecan pie this Thanksgiving.  So began my search for a pecan pie recipe that in theory sounded appealing. I came across this recipes and thought to myself hmmmm I like pecans and I love chocolate so how could this not be good.  And let me tell you I was not disappointed.  It came out perfect and it was so delicious!!!! Thanks for the great recipe.  :o)

This was yummy! I was looking for a chocolate pecan pie that contained no flour for my gluten intolerant mother-in-law. I made it with a gluten free crust. It was so easy to make! I did run into a few binds. First I found out we were out of butter, so I substituted 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce for that. Then I discovered we only had one egg left, so I used that, then shook together 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 6 tablespoons water in a tightly covered container for the rest. I used splenda instead of sugar because I'm calorie conscious. I also used semisweet chocolate because it's what I had. It was a little bit runny, but not bad and very tasty. Everyone liked it!

I have made this several times now and it is always a hit. I usually use brown instead of white sugar, and I cover my crust for the last half of a 60 minute bake at 350. That's what works best in my oven. The nuts always rise to the top during baking, so don't worry if they are laying at the bottom at first. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that is a family favorite now!!

This is my go-to recipe for Thanksgiving. It is requested every year. I also add some cinnamon and drizzle melted semi-sweet chocolate on top after it cools. Delicious!

If you love chocolate, you'll love this very rich chocolaty pie. Delightfully rich and good! One thin slice is all you need and your chocolate craving has been fulfilled.

Great! I made it for Thanksgiving and it got many compliments. Serve with real whip cream and it is wonderful. The only thing I will say is to either make in a torte pan or be sure to keep the sides of of your crust low because it doesn't rise a lot.

This was good, but not fantastic. The only thing I changed was using semi-sweet chocolate, everything else was the same. My opinion could also be skewed because I love regular pecan pie so much - probably shouldn't have messed with a good thing. Also, my cooking time took an extra 20-25 minutes - might be my British oven, but it seems to cook everything else alright.

Tastes like fudgy brownies with toasted pecans inside. Must have a glass of milk to go with it!

I followed the recipe exactly, without success. In order for the inside of the pie to be cooked completely, the top of the pie was overdone. I'm not sure what I did wrong. It tasted good, but I couldn't serve it to my guests.
