With some additions this was a big hit. I substituted some of the honey for maple syrup, added cinnamon, baked it much longer with no covering, basting from time to time, the last 15 minutes I added pecans and sprinkled with some brown sugar.

Not the greatest tasting sweet potatoes, but very easy to make.

After reading the reviews i decided to add cinnamon, brown sugar, and pecans to the dish.  All I can say is yummy!  This will get worked into the rotation of side dishes for sure.

very easy to make. I didn't have time to do exactly what the recipe said but I used canned sweet potatoes and then added the honey and other yummy components to it!

This recipe had some good flavor, although a little more butter than necessary.  We followed the recipe as instructed and found the flavor to be good...the sweet potatoes had enough flavor that the honey/butter just enhanced!  Will be making again soon!

I added the cinnamon and ginger as others suggested.  I also mixed in some pecans.  It took longer to cook than the 30 min. stated.  I finished it off in the microwave.  We loved the honey flavor.  Could do it with less butter.

I personally didn't eat this beacause I don't like sweet potatoes.  I made this for my parents and they seemed to like it.  I added ground ginger and cinnamon to it as well.  I sprinkled it on top before I baked it.  My dad told me you have to like sweet potatoes to enjoy this dish.  Try it...that's all I can say.

Simple side dish and very tasty. Also added some fresh grated ginger over the potatoes before popping them in the oven for some added flavor. Will make again.

I thought that these would be sweeter than they were. I added some brown sugar and enjoyed them alot more.

Did not care for it. Cook time took a little longer. I like them mashed better I guess. Thanks anyway but will not make them again.

These were pretty good.  I think I would like them better if they were cooked uncovered and a little crispy.

This recipe was awesome... I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans as was mentioned and everyone loved them!    And these were even better the next day... I blended up the leftovers and added them to some pancake batter for a delicious honey pecan sweet potatoe pancake treat!

This recipe had a nice flavor, with the addition of a little brown sugar and pecans one top for the last 15 minutes of baking.   Also, the serving size must be off on this or sweet potatoes on the east coast are much larger than other places.  I reduced the potatoes to 6, used half the butter the recipe calls for, and baked for 1 hours.  I served 14 adults and still have about 3 servings leftover.  Will make again but cut the potatoes down to 4 to serve the same number of people.

Yummy! I used sliced sweet potatoes from my grocer's meat department and added a cinnamon crumb topping. I served it in a small pumpkin shell I'd gutted for fresh pumpkin pie and my four year old has a new favorite food!

Really no taste at all- the canned stuff has more taste and a better texture, if easy is all you're looking for.  Need some spices- the honey isn't nearly enough to flavor.

Really good - this was enjoyed by a non-sweet potato lover. I served it with a grilled pork loin at a summer dinner party.

Sorry but nobody liked this AT ALL! Waaaay too much honey and not much of anything else. I even sprinkled cinnamon and ground ginger on them before putting them in the oven like other's suggested and that still didn't help. I definately will not be making these again.
