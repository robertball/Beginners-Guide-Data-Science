The brand / quality of ginger beer makes a big difference. With a 'spicy' to balanced ginger beer, I like to add a splash of simple syrup. I really like Bundaberg, or Seattle's Rachel's Ginger Beer. You can skip the syrup if you pick a sweeter ginger brew.

Fill your cocktail shaker with a handful of ice, pour in your favorite vodka, slice and squeeze the lime right in there, add the splash of simple syrup, and shake away. Pour the chilled / strained mix into your copper mug (but a glass timber can suffice), then top it with cold ginger beer and serve.

Very good balance of sweet, sour, spicy (and boozy)! Watch out though...they go down too easy!

Use premium Russian vodka, and there's your Moscow.  Deliciously dangerous.

My new favorite drink! If you like a ginger beer with lots of bite try fever tree ginger beer. It has cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. I also use the Tito's vodka.. it has a very smooth finish. Yum!

You don't have to chill the copper mugs, they'll get and keep cold when you fill them with ice cubes. I used the 1/2 cup (4 ounces) of Crabbie's Orginal Alcoholic Ginger Beer and all the other ingredients but added one more: 1 tsp of 'simple syrup' which I made by using a 1:1 ratio of water and sugar (1/4 cup water to 1/4 cup sugar or any equal amounts you choose) then microwaving in a glass bowl (NOT in the copper mugs!) 
 and stirring it to dissolve the sugar. The left over simple syrup should be sealed tightly and refrigerated to be used for other recipes within a week. Adding the sugar makes this a 5-star recipe as it tempers the sour/acid of the lime a bit.

We used Smirnoff Vodka and Not Your Father's Ginger Ale.  Wow, just wow.  These were very tasty and VERY potent (probably due to the fact that I accidentally got hard ginger ale instead of ginger beer).  The perfect recipe the new copper cups the hubs got for our 7th anniversary :)

It's good with blenheim ginger ale, if you don't have a ginger beer. I also enjoy it with Tito's vodka bc it has sweet finish and it's made in the US.

Not QUITE as tasty in paper cups as in copper mugs, but still a pretty great way to end the work week and kick off a weekend. We used Bundaberg ginger beer. It's wodka (with a W, as my grandpa would say) with a kick!

Wonderful cocktail!  I could only find Goya brand Jamaican style ginger beer, which is a bit spicy, but delightful.  Rather than use fresh lime juice, I use Rose's Lime Juice, which is sweet, and float it on top.  Served in my 30 year old roly poly copper tumblers!  Awesome!

I use different ginger beers, but I’ve found that one of the cheaper ones - Citadelle - is one of the best and has a nice amount of carbonation. I tend to substitute bourbon (Kentucky Mule) or rye in place of the vodka. You can use any liquor, really. Mezcal mules are great, too!

I added a tad of maple syrup. My local bar makes a version using vanilla vodka, and maple liquor-I want to replicate if I can. Still very yummy!

Do use freshly squeezed lime. Used Tito’s. Tried many ginger beers and liked Fentimen’s best. Fever Tree also nice.

Very good!  We had trouble finding ginger beer, so we made it with ginger ale instead.  The colder the better!  Goes down very easy!  Best summer drink that doesn't require a blender!

To make the Teton Mule - that's higher in kick than a Moscow Mule, add 4 drops of bitters to the lime juice.

High altitude kick!

Used Titos & fever tree beer  also which has a little more spice but it was tasty and these things can creep up on you.

Using Jamaican ginger beer made it particularly spicy and delicious. Quick to make, one serving at a time. Very original drink.

I made the Moscow Mule according to the recipe. This drink is a little too sweet for my taste but that is personal preference. If  ones likes drinks with carbonated beverages, I would recommend giving this a try!

Oooooh weeeee!!!! Dat gumbo wuz  gooood!!!!!  I make a chicken and sausage gumbo that is equally as good as this recipe that includes seafood. Made this for my son for his birthday and he loved it! Will definitely make this again!!! Thanks for sharing your family recipe! I look forward to having it tomorrow. It’s always better the next day and I can’t imagine it being any better than it already is. Be sure to make the roux dark as this is the secret to a good gumbo!

These are so easy and go down too easy. For those who said they goofed and got hard ginger beer...the only one like that is Crabbies! That is good but, not for this drink. Haha!

So. Good. I love lime juice and squeezed a whole lime into the drink (almost 2 oz), which is probably a horrible idea because now I'm going to continue gulping these down!
