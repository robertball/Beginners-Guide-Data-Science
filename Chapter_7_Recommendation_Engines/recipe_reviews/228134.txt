When I make this casserole, I use sour cream instead of mayonnaise and crushed Nacho Cheese Doritos. If you don't have the individual spices, taco seasoning works out great. I like to serve this with little bowls of chopped sides, like tomatoes, black olives, shredded lettuce, homemade salsa........

I replaced the mayo with 1/2 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt; the chili power and cumin with canned taco seasoning, taco sauce for the salsa, 1/2 pound ground beef in place of a pound, and used a mix of shredded "Mexican" cheese.  Slightly sauteed the onion when the beef was almost done, and added a can of nonfat refried beans to the sauce mixture.  We ate with diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce and sliced jalapeños on top.  It was yummy and pretty healthy (tortilla chips aside).  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for dinner last night and it was quite yummy! Used sour cream instead of mayo, and cayenne pepper in place of the cumin and chili powder. Pretty spicy but yummy and quick to put together.

Easy Taco Casserole Haiku: "Totally easy. Swapped sour cream for mayo. Served with lots of 'stuff.'" I don't think I wouldn't liked this nearly as much w/ mayo, so I used sour cream, along w/ a Mexi-blend of cheese, rather than the 2 different types called for. One bite of it by itself was "mmm tasty", but eating w/ cilantro, tomatoes, lettuce, and extra hot sauce? Taco-transcendent!

I thought I would try this recipe since it seemed an easy weeknight dinner. I followed the original recipe only adding sour cream on the side when served. My husband LOVED it! I enjoyed it as well and our 20 month old son gobbled it up! Definitely going to save this one in my 'favorites' folder to make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Made the recipe as written to see if I would have preferred it with sour cream, which I normally used, and I liked the creaminess better with the mayo. Excellent dish!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  Like other reviewers I used about 3 tablespoons of Taco Seasoning I from this site (minus the salt) instead of the chili powder and cumin to give it a little more flavor and heat.  I also used a light sour cream instead of mayonnaise and pepper jack cheese for the monterey Jack Cheese.  I forgot to cover it in foil and the cheese on top got a little overdone.  Next time i will cover it in foil until the last 10 minutes or so.  I served it with cornbread and it was delicious.

Husband loved it! I USED mayo; thought it gave extra flavor. No cumin, just chili powder. 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, a 15 oz. jar of mild salsa, cup of diced onion, and BBQ corn chips. It was quick and wonderful!

This recipe had my kids asking for more! I told myself that I would faithfully follow the recipe, then hedged a bit on the chili powder because I thought it might be too spicy and put in just over 1 tbsp.  I used mayo, even though I thought it sounded a little funny, but it turned out great.  I think I could have easily used the full allotment of chili powder because it was not spicy.  The mayo mixed with the other ingredients (I used Pace mild salsa) turned out to be a really nice tasting dish.  The chips on top stayed crunchy.  The cheese on top got really browned and crispy.  I added some more cheese when I took it out of the oven so that I had some oooey gooey cheese.  I served it with sour cream and everyone liked it!

I thought this recipe was great, I used hot Italian sausage meat rather than ground beef.  I also used Light Miracle Whip.  I have a very fussy bunch in my home, and they all loved it, and want it again.  If they request it be repeated then it will never rate less than 5 stars!

I have been making this for many years but always put in a can of whole kernel corn (drained of course) and use tomato sauce and salsa but no sour cream or mayo.  It is an easy crowd pleaser.

This was pretty good!  I will definitely make it again. My 6 year old twins thought it was a little spicy but still liked it okay.  My husband and I loved it.   The ground beef I use comes in 1-1/3 pound packages, so I used all of that, plus a can of black beans and about 8 oz of frozen spinach (because I sneak that into anything I can).  Since I added the beans and spinach I doubled the remaining ingredients and split it into two dishes and froze one, (omitting the last layer of chips and cheese... I'll add that when I thaw it). I  used mayo and plain yogurt, plus a little bit of garlic.  Super quick and easy!

I have to say that after reading several reviews for this recipe I decided that I would follow the recipe. I'm sure glad I did, the entire dish gotten eaten. My family loved it. I liked the mayonnaise, it gave it a nice flavor. We did use sour cream as a topping along with lettuce and tomatoes. I'm definitely making this again. I whipped it together in 10 minutes. I might try it with turkey instead of hamburger just to see if its just as good.

I have made this and liked it! I used the sour cream like others suggested. I am making it tonight and will use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo  since I was almost out of sour cream! I also used guacamole chips and put green chili(canned) on top of mixture before adding ground beef.

This was so yummy!! I used taco seasoning instead of the spices and used sour cream instead of mayo. I sauteed the onion with some chopped garlic and then added it to the meat after draining the grease. My hubby ate it plain and in a tortilla! It was so good and very easy! Thanks for posting!

Very much like the Beef Nacho Casserole from this site. I use sour cream and taco seasoning in place of the spices for a stronger taco flavor. My family likes this one.

This was okay. It is better if you add sour cream at the table. 
The texture was a bit thick and tacky.
I didn't like the flavour very much. But, to be fair, I don't like the flavour of taco meat (when I make tacos, I don't add seasoning to the meat), so I'm a bit biased.
The tortilla chips layered in were yummy.

I tweaked this also. I omitted the spices and just used taco seasoning. I used 1/4 cup sour cream instead of mayo, I also added a half can of refried beans. I used green onions and added tomatoes. Garnished with lettuce and avocados. Next time I will add chopped black olives.

I made it with the mayonnaise even though I was leery about it. I used a whole can of Ro-tel tomatoes and green chiles for the salsa and I cooked the onions in with the meat as I was browning it. I also added cut olives to the meat. DELICIOUS! The only problem I had was with the chips. They were chewy topped with the cheese. Next time I may pour enchilada sauce over the whole dish before I add the final layer of cheese and make them into an Easy Beef Enchilada Casserole. I topped with sour cheese and green onions too.

This turned out delicious! I changed things up by adding more meat, that I added the onions and some garlic while cooking. I used Taco Seasoning instead of Chili Powder and added a can of Mixed Chili Beans by Bush to the meat mixture. I also added a small can of Chopped Ortega chilies to the meat.
I sprinkled chopped green onions and sliced black olives to top off.
Served with sour cream, chopped Tomatoes and Cilantro!

I followed most of the directions, but added diced tomatoes with green chilies and doubled the sauce (it looked a little too dry, doubling the sauce made it so much better).  I'm not a fan of spicey food, but my family just loved it.  It's a definite keeper!

I had all the ingredients.  I made it exactly as the recipe states using Tostitos chunky medium salsa.  It was absolutely delicious, you don't need to change a thing.  I think it would be awesome with a layer of refried beans added.

Hard to beat this recipe for an easy weeknight meal! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and no one complained. I LIKED the mayo but will try it next time with sour cream.

I warmed in the microwave 15 oz. can of refried beans for less than a minute. When meat was mostly cooked I added the onion and cooked for a couple minutes then added the refried beans. once heated and all mixed good add taco seasoning mix instead of spices indicated. Added the mayo and salsa. I used a mix of Sharp Cheddar and Mexican 4-cheese. It was sooo good. We topped it with Pico De Galo on top.

My family enjoyed this!  The only changes I made were that I used ground turkey instead of beef, reduced fat sour cream instead of mayonnaise, and I added a can of refried beans to the meat mixture. It's yummy served with avocado slices and sour cream on top and a bed of shredded lettuce on the bottom.

This was sooo easy and tasty too.  Topped it with sour cream to cool off the chili powder some.  Hubby says he definitely wants it again.

I used diced tomatoes instead of salsa to make it a little less spicy for my kids, but I'm sure salsa would have been great too. I also made it without mayo OR sour cream for a lower fat version. It was still delicious! My 5-year old loved it.

I used sour cream instead of the mayonaise. Instead of the crushed corn chips, which are high in sodium, I used corn tortillas,5mg sodium each, cut into strips. i added low sodium canned chopped tomatoes instead of the salsa, and 4 oz can drained chili peppers. Yum! my hubby loved it!

I never write reviews, but this was a really great recipe. The prep was so simple and quick. I had all the ingredients on hand. I can never find anything that all 4 of my kids like, and they all loved this (even the one who doesn't like tacos)!

The cheese/corn chip topping was tough. Everything else was mediocre. Seriously, for the calories you are much better off going to taco bell for dinner. I can't imagine why this has gotten positive reviews.

This recipe gets high marks from us.  I wish I had this recipe back when my kids were little.  

A great quick meal to put together  when time is short.

Toppings:  I served it with chopped fresh kale, green onions and fresh tomatoes.

I made a few changes: I cooked the onion along with the ground turkey.  I made rice and added it to the meat mixture after I discarded the grease. I did not have the spices so I added an envelope of taco seasoning along with a can of diced tomatoes. Everything else I made according to recipe. It was very good!

I made a low carb version of this, swapping chips/tortillas and instead used bell pepper strips, sliced white mushrooms, green onion, and cauliflower florets. I also skipped the mayonnaise and used sour cream instead. My cheese was 2% cheddar-jack shreds. Very yummy and easy!

Sorry, but I did make alterations to it to extend.  I added saute onions, refried beans, and used tostitos thin crispy chips.  Easy, even without my personal changes.  Excellent recipe.

I substituted sour cream for mayo, which was a better ingredient for us. This is an easy recipe,  but there isn't much nutrition or substance to it.

I made this recipe as directed and wish I had read reviews first to make modifications. Next time I’ll mix hamburger with refried beans and use this as the base and not use tortilla chips at all. Will also top with crushed dorritos when serving.

Easy to make, and yummy!   I followed the recipe, using spicy nacho chips.  And I always add more cumin than the recipe calls for.

Very easy to make and delicious.  My husband does not like sour cream so this recipe is perfect.  You can add sour cream and salsa as a side with the dish.

I used 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning mix instead of the chilli powder and cumin.  It came out great and my kids  and husband loved it!  I didn't give it 5 starts because the tortilla chips came out soggy.  I'm not sure how to fix that problem.  It's definitely a keeper as it is so easy to make and everyone really liked it.  Next time I will double the recipe.

As written,  it was dry but flavor was really good. The second time I cooked the meat with a small diced onion, used sour cream in place of the mayo, less chili powder, a sprinkle of crushed red peppers and 1/2 cup chicken broth to loosen it up. I served it with diced tomatoes and sliced black olives. It was amazing! Thanks for the delicious starting point!

I don't like to rate a recipe if I have made changes to it,,,but I'm not a fan of Miracle whip, so like a lot of others I used sour cream instead, otherwise kept everything the same.. It was amazing. I definetly will make this again and again. Thank you.

This dish turned out amazing and me and my family and we LOVED it!! I also have some tips to share with you:     Instead of mayo, use sour cream, use Doritos instead of the taco chips, use taco mix instead of all those spices. I hoped these tips helped you have an amazing dish like mine!!

This dish was delicious!! I used a taco seasoning packet instead of the cumin. I also used sour cream instead of mayo. I also topped off each plate with some sour cream and shredded lettuce. I am very pleased at how this turned out. It was easy to make, took little time to prepare and bake and my whole family loved it! Will definitely be adding to my favorites!

Added more spices (onion & garlic powder, cayenne & black pepper, salt), hot sauce and Serrano peppers in ground beef mixture.  We love spicy, hot food, so I also used Monterey Jack with spicy peppers.  Due to other reviewers suggestion, I used sour cream in place of the mayo.  Topped with tomatoes, lettuce and homemade guacamole...yum!

The family loved it.  I wasn't a fan but it could be because I used reduced fat cheese and it just wasn't the same.  It felt too dry to me.

I made it with the given ingredients. I was skeptical about the Mayo, but I went with it anyway. It was a huge hit. My teenage boys asked to have it often. The only thing I did differently was that I only crushed half of the chips. I left the top layer of chips whole, and it was really good!

I doubled the recipe used crushed chips on the bottom added black beans and corn left out the mayo put more chips on top and covered with cheese. This was for a dinner at church and I served sour cream on the side for those to put on themselves. It was all eaten and they loved it.

I found this to be just ok. Hubby seemed to like it a bit more than I did. It  reminded me of soggy tacos, which I don't particularly care for. Served with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced green onions and sour cream. Sorry, don't think I'll be making this again.

I tend to be a lazy cook when hubby is away and tonight was no different.  Followed as directed except added powdered garlic and free handed the cheese, cumin and chili powder.  If I made it again, I would cook the onions first then add the meat to soften them a bit more.  The boys ate it up and got seconds.  I wouldn't cook this weekly but it's good for a quick meal.  I think it would be better with lettuce, black olives and guacamole on time.  It reminds me of really gooey, bad-for-you nachos.

I really liked this dish! Easy and tasty. I added some fresh cilantro to the onion, substituted taco seasoning for the chili powder and cumin. I also added a shot of Sriracha sauce to the salsa. I also just used Colby Jack cheese. Next time, I will try using sour cream or Greek yogurt in place of the mayonnaise. It was good, but a little oily. Otherwise, it turned out really well. Thanks!

A definite keeper! I couldn't decide between sour cream and mayo so used 1/2 and 1/2. We like spicy so I used a full package of hot taco seasoning mix and medium chunky salsa. To make it really taste like tacos, I crushed more Nacho Cheese Doritos and sprinkled them on top. YUM!

My family loved this recipe! I was going to sub sour cream for the mayonnaise, but after reading reviews, I decided to give it a  try.  So glad I did! The mayonnaise made it creamier, and seemed to bring out the flavors. Ima.so added a can of retried beans to the ground beef mixture and used half the chili powder because I had some little ones dining with us. It was perfect, the 18month old couldn't get enough.

This was really good.  Made as directed but next time will exchange mayo for sour cream as suggested by others.

This recipe was a hit for my family. I used sour cream instead of mayo. The kids requested I use Doritos next time and I agree. I think it'll add a little extra flavor. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I tried it before and it was delicious. Tonight I made it again however, I did ground turkey and only Monterey Cheese. So I hope it is just as good.  Thank you.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using ground turkey instead of the ground beef called for because it's what I had. My husband and both of our picky kids LOVED it! I'll definitely be making this again!

I swapped out the seasonings for taco seasoning, but kept everything else the same. It tasted great but the chips were chewy. I think needed more moisture. Wondering what I did wrong. :(

Easy to make.  I used mild salsa so I didn't get complaints from my daughter who hates spicy food.
Very good but you need to add a salad to make it a balanced meal.

My family loved this recipe. It is now becoming a weekly dinner.I did change the mayo to sour cream, and I am thinking of adding refried beans sometimes. I used home made salsa and added a small can of chopped chilies.

I've made this twice, once with mayo and the next time with sour cream.  Turned out wonderful both times but think we preferred the mayo over sour cream.  The mayo made it more tangy.  Awesome recipe, a definite keeper!  Thanks Charmed71 for sharing this one!

Quick easy and kids liked it. The mayo helps it not be too spicey, although I don't add the full amount of spices since we all like things on the mild side.

I made this recipe and my husband loved it.  I made a few changes - omitted the cumin, added a can of corn and a can of black beans, used a Mexican cheese blend instead of the jack cheese and used sour cream instead of mayo.  Served it with corn bread.  Very easy to make and one I will make again!

Made just as directed and it would have gotten only a mediocre review except that adding salsa (or taco sauce)on top when serving made it a really good everyday meal.  I would think about adding some beans or refried beans to it next time. The cheese on top hardened when reheated so put cheese only on the part you will for sure eat right away and then top the leftovers with the cheese before reheating.

This is awesome!!!!!  I was going to try this using sour cream as so many others suggested, however.....I'm a mayonnaise-a-holic and I figured what's 1/2 c. mayo as long as I'm using all that cheese.  I made it with the mayo and it was sooooo good.  Added extras, as I would on a regular taco and it's definitely a keeper.  I would rather make the recipe as listed first and then (if need be) make adjustments.  This is right on just the way it is.

I made this last night for dinner and it was a hit.  Thanks to those who suggested swapping sour cream for mayo.  I used low fat sour cream.  We actually had ground turkey seasoned with taco seasoning in the freezer, so I just used that.  I also added black beans which worked really well - probably my toddler's favorite part of the dish.
