This is a horrendous recipe.  The dough is runny, and starts to spread out instantly when placed on a cookie sheet.  Once in the oven, it continues to spread and the entire sheet is coated in the egg laden mess.  I wasted an entire evening trying to get this recipe to work out.

WHY did I not read the reviews first??  What a mess.  Dough was runny and made one big tray of mushy mess.  I even tried to salvage by making cookie bars and flipped "cookies" over to try and cook mushy bottom....

definatley not a recipe i'd want to make again or tell others to try. even after attempting to thicken up the dough so it wasn't so watery it still ended up running all over the baking sheet and tasting extreemly bland with an almost rubbery texture. perhaps the ingredents need to be altered, and i'd definatley not use the water if i were to do it over again.

I didn't read the reviews and just made the cookies- so as I was mixing the batter I didnt' like how it looked when i added the water. I just made another batch and left the 3/4 cup of water out completely. I think they turned out pretty well the second time around. I also substituted the chocolate chips for Andies mint chips. Awesome substitute.

Please do not waste your time on this.  I am very upset I never took the time to read the reviews before just grabbing and trying it.

This recipe is disgusting.  Way too much flour.  It's very runny and spreads all over the cookie sheet.  My cookies were burnt after only 10 minutes in the oven and they had a cake-like texture.  Definitely the worst cookies I have ever tasted.  Maybe the ingredients got mixed up somewhere.  Try another one!

I WAS kind of put off by how runny the batter was but in my opinion they turned out great.  I'm actually glad i didnt read the rating before i made them. They didnt burn, they stayed soft, they dont taste like flour and it didnt run all over the pan. They taste great and i actually think i'll use this recipe again :) Thanks :)

These CC cookies are delicious!!!! The batter is a little runny, and the cookie does spread out, but dont panic people...let them cool, and enjoy. They are the best!!!! If you are looking for a "CAKE" cookie, this is not it. This is, rather, a chewy/crisp cookie. This will be my regular cc cookie recipe from now on . Thanks for sharing!!

They were too watery and tasted only like flour. When they were in the oven they didn't cook properly and they only spread out in to a mess.

I'd thought that my lack of baking soda around the house at 10 o'clock at night would have been the reason for the pancakey look to the cookies... but I guess I didn't read the reviews before baking these :(

When I made this, I used 2 tsp vanilla and only 1/4 c water.  The batter was very runny, so I poured it all into shallow (1" deep) pan.  Then baked at 325 for about 14 minutes, turning after 7 minutes.  It came out like a cake.  Very spongy.  Not at all like a cookie.  I suggest smashing a banana and adding it to the batter (and maybe adjust other ingredients so it'll bake ok).  If you don't expect a cookie, then have some ice cream and/or a banana on hand to eat with a piece of this cake.

I, too, failed to read the reviews before making these. I was able to save them by adding another cup or so of flour and a dash of vanilla.

I can't honestly give this recipe any stars.  It was awful.  Batter was runny, even after adding more flour.  I wish I had read the reviews before attempting to make these.

Horrible! I didn't read the reviews just made the cookies. I was looking for a recipe that only called for 1/2 cup butter sincet that's all I had. I should have realized it was going to be runny with all the water but I made it anyway. I only made half the batch.

WHAT A MESS! The cookie dough wasn't even 'dough'. It was more like cake batter. I added probably about another 1/2 cup of flour and put them in the oven, hoping for the best. I looked at them half way through and was very displeased with how they were turning out. They barely even look like cookies...! All I can say is I hope they taste better than they look. Very disappointing. Most of them burned on the bottom and weren't even cooked thoroughly! What. A. Mess.
