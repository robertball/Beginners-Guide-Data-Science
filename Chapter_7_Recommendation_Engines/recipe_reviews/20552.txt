I made this for a big family get-together.  Everone loved it! It's great because it isn't too sweet or sour.  A suggessted shortcut, though: Dole makes orange and pineapple juice by the half gallon.  When I ran out of the original recipe, I used this instead and it tasted the same! I also added some cherries on top and a little bit of grenadine.

Great punch.  The instructions can use some help, though.  I imagine using a one-gallon container works well if you're ony freezing the punch for about eight hours.  I froze mine for about 18 hours, and it spilled all over my freezer.  When I checked on it after about eight or ten hours, it looked fine, though.  I let it thaw for about three hours, which wasn't quite long enough.  Four to five hours would probably be about right.  If you're only freezing it for eight hours, two hours for thawing is probably correct.  Basically, use a much larger container and add an hour or two onto the thawing time if you're going to freeze it for more than just overnight.

I made this for my son's birthday party.  I also made an extra batch, poured a decorative bundt pan full of the punch and froze it.  I put it in the punch bowl instead of ice, so the punch would not get watered down.  This is a great recipe!

I made this for a retirement ceremony recently. I work with mostly guys and they LOVED IT! It turned out great and was easy to make. I will definately make it again. Our Maintnenance Officer added that it would "accept a fifth of vodka quite nicely".

I served this punch at my 6 yr olds luau birthday party. I doubled the recipe and still did not have enough.  Everyone loved it and wanted more. I had a little trouble w/the fizz overflowing from the milk jug - but other than that it was easy to make and tasted great. I will make it again.

I loved this recipe!  We used it for the weddings of my daughter, my niece and my brother. It's versatile and easy to make before needed.  By changing the juice flavor, you change the color of the punch to coordiate with wedding colors!  It was beautiful and delicious.

Ridiculously sweet, but that's punch! The flavors were great and worked perfectly for a tropical-themed wedding reception food spread. Everyone really enjoyed this! I used ginger ale and sierra mist for the soda, making a really nice flavor combo. My sister suggested mixing in a can of tropical OJ concentrate (like orange-pine-banana, etc) but those are more expensive and the bride wanted to keep it lower cost. However, if you were doing a small batch or two, the flavor-twist OJ would be a great idea! I made a batch to test this and then frost the remainder in a bundt pan to use as the ice ring...I tossed in a few maraschino cherries for some eye-catching colors. Beautiful and tasty.

Very tasty! I changed it up a bit by using sugar-free 7-up to reduce some of the sugar. As you can see by the photo I submitted, I also added some color to it in the punch bowl with frozen orange slices and frozen pineapple rings with marachino cherries in the center that I froze together by glazing them with orange juice and letting set in the freezer for about an hour. And, for those who wanted some extra kick, I added champagne as I poured it into their cups. Yumm!

This punch tasted great, but the directions should say to leave some room in the gallon jug, otherwise it will expand and crack in the freezer.  This recipe was a big mess for me.  Also, it took more time than the recipe said for it to thaw and become slushy.

I liked this recipe as described, however, i have learned to make some minor adjustments. 
1. It's true... melting time is longer than indicated on the original recipe. Mix the concentrate and juice and store in seperate plastic containtainers. That way, you can add as your punch runs out. I add the cold soda at the very end. 

2. Ditto on the marachino cherries... adds texture and yummy pops of flavor

3. my "here's what was missing moment": one can of coconut creme. Yup, just throw it in with the juice concentrate and juice when freezing. It makes a world of difference and adds a totally new dimension in flavors. 

Enjoy!

Very tasty!  It also tastes just as delicous without freezing it- you can add an ice ring or ice cubes if you want to do something like a punch fountain.

This punch was exactly what I was looking for.  I didn't freeze it, and I added raspberry sherbet right before serving.  Everyone loved it.

I made this punch based on all the positive reviews.  I really have had better punchs and will go back to my old one.  This one seems to be missing something and it certainly does not melt sufficiently in 2 hours.  Maybe 4 hours would be better.

I made this punch for my son's 8th birthday.  IT WAS A HUGE HIT.  I made the alcoholic(added some rum to taste) and non-alcoholic versions.  Very Delicious.  I highly recommend it for hot summer BBQ's

I made this for Teacher Appreciation Week Luau lunch celebration and they loved it.  I put frozen pineapple chunks in the bottom of the punch bowl prior to putting the punch in it.  On top I put sliced oranges.  It was a big hit!

I made this for a luncheon, and it was a hit! I made it in a 1-gallon plastic pitcher. But, it needed a lot more than 2 hrs to start thaw! Nevertheless, I will definitely make this again.

I was looking to make punch but didn't have frozen concentrated lemonade, so I came upon this recipe.  I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this tasted.  My DH especially liked it.  I like how I don't have to add any additional sugar.  It is super convenient to make it in the milk jug too - great for transport.  I poured in half the pineapple juice, then the pop, then the rest of the ingredients to keep the fizz down (didn't eliminate the fizz but I didn't have it running over the top).  Thanks for the great recipe!

The key is to make this slushy. A 5-quart ice cream bucket works perfect for this recipe. It needs at least 3 hours to thaw, too, and then you may have to chop it up in the bowl (DO NOT leave ice chunks for serving--they are made of water). Next time I plan to try a couple stirrings of the mixture as it freezes. Really addicting! If only lemon-lime soda were a health food...sigh...

So simple, yet so good. I made this for my daughter's luau party and it was hands down, the one thing that guests not only raved about, but drank every last drop of. I only had enough ingredients to make the punch once, but I wish I would have doubled the recipe. This will be my go to punch recipe from now on!

Such an easy punch recipe! I reduced the recipe to a 1-1-1 ratio, meaning the large can pineapple juice to one can of orange juice concentrate to only one 2 liter bottle of lemon-lime soda (I used 7-up). The punch had a much tangier, "punchier" taste, and it wasn't quite so fizzy. My guests raved about the punch, and could not believe how simple it was! Any leftover punch kept well in the fridge for another couple days!

My daughter and her friends expect this punch at all her birthday parties for the last 3 years!  They love it.  I always make 2 batches or else we would run out.

Wonderful punch - used for a shower and had lots of compliments.  I made 4 batches, but put them in 5 qt. ice cream buckets, instead of gallon jugs, since it expands when it freezes.  Will use again.

I have made a version of this many times. I use 1 large can pineapple juice, 1 large can apple juice and 1 12 oz. can frozen lemonade concentrate plus 2 2 ltrs of Ginger ale.  Freeze the juices and lemonade in gallon freezer bags first, being sure all is sealed tightly (I double bag), then they will lay flat. Thaw slightly in punch bowl. Add both ginger ales and then you can mash to make slushy.

This was good!  We looked at the ready and prep time of 10 minutes and didn't notice the "freeze overnight" part.  So, 2 hours before our party we mixed the pineapple juice & OJ and mixed dry ice into it.  This would be yummy to add crushed pineapples with the juice and don't freeze the lemon-lime drink with it, but serve the slush over the soda!

yummy, I was looking for a recipe similar to this, although I suggst putting lots of ice in to keep it slushy while it is beig served, and peach sherbert would be best, I tried raspberry, and I thought it took something away from the luau taste of it, but still delicious!

This received rave reviews from my two daughters, aged 15 and 8.  We had bought fancy drinking glasses at the dollar store & needed something festive to fill them with, this drink was perfect.  A nice summer drink.

Super easy, took a tip from another on site recipe and froze it in heavy zip-lock freezer bags. Took up less freezer room and thawed more quickly.

I served this as a drink option for dessert-time when I was hosting a luau BBQ. It was a big hit! Extremely simple to make and very refreshing. I'm sure this idea works great with other flavors and can be spiked if you're looking for a punch with alcohol.

I made a big batch for a Luau and everyone loved it.  I did not freeze it because the frozen mixture would not go through the spout of my container.  Kids drank it straight and adults added rum.  Many asked for the recipe!  A hit for sure!

I made this, but used orange-flavored drink concentrate instead of real orange juice. I also didn't freeze it, I just put it over ice. It was super easy, really good, and easy to transport to the party location.

Served it at a pool party along side my strawberry lemonade.  The kids/adults preferred the strawberry lemonade BUT liked this one as well.  I did not use any can juice as I don't like the taste that the can gives it.  All bottle.  I also toasted coconut and lined the rim of the glasses with lime juice and roasted coconut.  Definitely was a hit.  For an adult party...consider mixing in some pineapple moonshine.  :)  OH!!!!  And I did NOT serve it slushy!  Just mixed it all together and it was perfect!!!!

This was super easy, and what I liked about it the most that  A) we could drink it outside in the heat and cool off after the pool. I don't drink alcohol, but some of my family members do. It since I made it for her Birthday, her husband had brought some  Malibu rum which she added to hers a little. She said it's just like her favorite drink ,but better.  So it's a win win.

I halved the recipe because I wasn't having a huge party.  This punch was OK.  I felt freezing it was more work than it was worth.  If I make it again, I'll tweak the ingredients a bit and just make sure everything is cold.

Turned out great. I didn't have a chance to freeze it but made it and poured it over ice. It was popular at brunch. I will definitely make this again. So easy.

This was very refreshing and a cinch to make.
 It was a hit at our Easter dinner.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Great flavor! The soda gives it a good kick. This would probably even make a great adult beverage.

Awesome and simple to make. I couldn't wait for it to freeze and then thaw, so I poured a glass before tossing it in the freezer. This would be really good with some vodka or rum. Can't wait to try it when it's more slushy! Thanks for sharing!

Takestoo long to thaw!  I mixed according to directions, and froze overnight (8 hours). I thawed my test gallon in the refrigerator for 3 hours; it was still a block of ice, so I thawed it on the counter... It was ten hours before it was really pourable! Second batch I froze overnight, then thawed in the refrigerator for 20 hours. It's been sitting out on the counter and still hasn't thawed.

Yummy! Sums up this punch in one word. I served it along with lasagna, pasta Alfredo and salad, and my guests kept saying how good it was. I thoroughly enjoyed this punch and will be making it again for other occasions. The only thing I changed was that I only used 1 liter of Sprite.
