My daughter LOVES these.  Different from traditional holiday cookies.  Nice bright flavor from lime in the icing.  Not overly sweet if the icing is drizzled and not poured on heavy.  The cookie holds together fairly well.  This will be a repeat at our home.

I only got about 9 avg sized cookies from the recipe as is. But they are delicious. I baked them a lot longer than 8 minutes but they never got very brown on top. Since I baked on parchment paper I was able to check the bottom of a few and knew they were done. The icing is the yummiest part. They were quick and easy to make.

This recipe is great! I dubled it but it was really runny so I added 4 T of coconut flour, and 1 T of powdered sugar.

I made these bc  I wanted to try another easy cookie recipe (brownie cookie recipe is my go-to and a love!) and something sweet, but not too sweet and these came out great! I used coconut oil and skipped the icing just bc I didn't have powdered sugar and didn't need more sugar.  Still really great treats with coffee and super quick! Will absolutely make these again. Thanks so much for the recipe!
