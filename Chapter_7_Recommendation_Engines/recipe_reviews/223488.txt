Remember those wonderful mustards in restaurants that make a sandwich taste incredible?  They use fine powdered mustards with water.  I sweetened the recipe with Splendid to enhance the flavor, reducing the dry bitterness. I also added a sprinkle of salt.  1/2 tsp vinegar helps preserve the homemade mustard, which begins to decline as soon as it is mixed.  Adding an acid such as vinegar or rice wine stops the reaction and preserves the sharp edge if you are not using up in one sitting.

Don't bother with the pepper and depending on your personal heat meter. I would say cut the recipe in half for a single use. But if you don't want it too strong use half the mustard and keep the rest the same. but as is the recipe is very close if not dead on what you get at the local Chinese place.

just learned this from my Mom-in-law earlier this week but I couldn't get her to find the ratio between water & mustard.  I left the pepper out & was still very pleased.

I make mine using just water and Chinese mustard powder. The hotter I want it the longer I let it set at room temperature. Once it has the bite I want I pop it in the fridge. Yum.

Who would of thought that two ingredients would make this hot mustard.  It tastes just like what's in the little packages but much more healthy.

Great recipie.  Closest to the real thing  I have ever had. Two things to try.  Use a plastic or wooden utensil to mix ingredients and leave it covered for at least 10 or 15 minutes before tasting.

This recipe is easy and pretty good, if you really want to kick it off, replace about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of water with Rice Vinegar. Gives it some tang and opens up the mustard for a fuller taste.

Wonderful!  It was just hubby and I so I just spooned about a tablespoon of ground mustard into bowl and then whisked in water until it reached the right consistency.  Husband went absolutely nuts over this stuff.  Thank you SO much for recipe!

I was surprised at how good this was! I'd say it's even better than you get at restaurants, and since you know what went into it, that's even better! I skipped the pepper but did add about a tsp of vinegar, as a reviewer suggested it would allow it to keep a bit longer. I found that adding a small amount of sugar helped to cut some of the bitterness. A definite keeper!

Iâ€™ve found that Chinese mustard has a weird aftertaste.  It I still not pleasant.  Any of the bottled mustard has this taste but not the packets.  When I made this mustard, it had the same unpleasant aftertaste.  When I made it, I used 2 tablespoons water and one tablespoon vinegar as another reviewer stated.  It was very bitter, so I added a pinch of sugar, and it solved the problem.  I can taste things to the extreme so others may not have this issue.  I hope the flavor lasts!

Just finished making this. It's awesome! I've been looking forever in the supermarket fur a hot Chinese style mustard but could never find anything g even close. I omitted the white pepper. It has PLENTY of heat without it. Exactly like the little containers they give you at the Chinese restaurant.

This tastes so much better than what comes in the packets with Chinese takeout.  It's closer to the hot mustard that's served at Chinese restaurants. Some people complained about the bland taste, but that's what I like about hot mustard. It adds heat without changing the flavor of the food.

I omitted the ground white pepper. I also let it stand at room temperature for 15 minutes like another reviewer suggested. I cooked up some egg rolls to eat with this and it was delicious!

This is SPOT on to what you get in the restaurant! I can't believe how simple it is, I always thought that mustard must have had some type of horseradish in it because it was so hot, but it turns out it's just powdered mustard and water.

perfect without the pepper, a little different with the pepper, thanks for sharing.
