This recipe worked out quite well. Toasted single layer of almonds in 300 degree oven for 20 minutes before placing in food processor. When processing, continued to add oil (may need more than recipe states) until reached desired consistency. Also added a touch of sea salt which enhanced the almond flavor.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but my tip on making this is to add some honey if the end product is too "dry" and so not so spreadable. The honey makes the almond butter a little sweet and that much more yummier! A great, healthy alternative to peanut butter!

This was so simple!  The hardest part was the clean-up.  I added the olive oil until it started to get creamy then, added 2 Tbs. honey.  I may never buy store bought nut butters again!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe isn't written terribly clearly, but it does make good almond butter. Wait until the ball stage to add oil then KEEP PROCESSING until you get the consistency you want. The natural oils release as it is processed, and it takes a long time. It's the same for other nut butters, but almond takes longer. If you do add honey (which I prefer) wait to add it at the end.

Good recipe but it I strongly recommend you replace the olive oil with almond oil or a neutral tasting oil such as canola or vegetable.   

1. No olive oil because it interferes with the almond taste which I suspect is the reason reviewers felt it needed honey.  
2. Lightly toast the almonds and let them cool before you make the butter.
3.  Save tons of money on almonds @ Sam's or Costco (3 pound bags) and store them in the freezer. 
4. Plan on processing this in 2 (or more) steps with a cool down period in between where you shut off the engine so that you don't burn out your food processor. My Cuisinart is a work horse, but I still had to do that.
5. I will freeze my very big batch of this in 1 pint canning jars.

Great recipe to customize to your liking.  I roasted the almonds in a 300 degree oven for 15 minutes and tossed about cup of flax seed on the almonds the last three minutes.  Creamed the dickens out of the flax and almonds in the food processor with a tablespoon or so of honey, a pinch of sea salt and as much EVOO as I needed to get to the consistency I wanted....maybe 2 or 3 tablespoons.  Yummy!

An excellent, healthy recipe. This was a perfect opportunity to break in my new Braun food processor. The taste is lovely. Not too creamy, and is a nice medium texture between creamy and crunchy peanut butter.
The store I get my nuts from was out of plain toasted almonds, so I substituted them with lime-toasted almonds, and my olive oil was extra-virgin Spanish. I also added half a tsp of unrefined sugar. The butter is sweet, slightly crunchy, with a slight tangy lime hint. A lovely recipe overall.

Great recipe! My niece has been telling me to try almond butter for a while now, and I am glad I did! I think it is a tad too oily, but I will just cut back on the olive oil next time! Great basic recipe! Thanks!

I tried this, but found more advice on another blog that explained with photos how long you have to grind the almonds before you get a true butter. If you stop as the recipe suggests here the mixture will be dry and somewhat bitter. If you go on another 5-8 minutes the almonds will warm a bit more and release much more oil. The whole thing becomes sweet and creamy and no additional oil is needed. Scrape the sides of the bowl every couple of minutes early on and then break up the big ball that forms a few times. Have patience you will be rewarded.

I like my almond butter raw, so did not toast the nuts. After the 1 cup of nuts were pulverized, I added 1 Tbsp of sunflower oil, which does not have a the heavy flavor or bitterness of olive oil. Continued processing for 2 more minutes or just until it clung together to form a crumbly paste, and NOT INTO A BALL. If you let it go that long, it becomes very doughy. This way looks more like wet sand granules.  It is still spreadable at this stage. If you like more oil, STIR IT IN BY HAND. Personally, I do not like a lot of oil because of the enormous calories, and when buying market products, even pour off the oily top; especially with peanut butter because they add so much. I stirred in some slivered almonds to make it crunchy. There is no bitterness and no added sugar or honey necessary.

Well, I'm not sure where to start.  Even with the addition of honey, it was too dry.  It made my (Cuisinart, not a bad brand) food processor overheat before I could fully process, after about 15 minutes of trying.  One serving is 8 grams, about half a tablespoon.  The taste is ok, nothing phenomenal.  I submitted a couple of pictures so that people could get an idea of the consistency.  I will not use this recipe again.

This recipe was a good base but it was way too dry!  I used one cup of dry roasted almonds, 4 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil & 3 tsp of honey.  It tastes very good and is spreadable.  Thanks for posting :)

I didn't use the olive oil at all.  The key in making almond butter is to process it in the food processor for a long time - at least 10 minutes in total.  I'd worked it a little bit, let it rest, and then work it some more so I didn't burn out the motor.  For a long time it was like a ball as some described.  Then almost instantaneously, the oils in the almonds came out, and I had a very smooth peanut butter!

This recipe is GREAT! I've been wanting to make a nut butter and heard how easy it was and how much healthier than store bought. My 3 year old, a somewhat picky kid has taken to peanut butter sandwiches and I thought I would try making it. It came out perfectly and the 3yo had a sandwich straight from the food processor and came back quickly for another sandwich. My chef of a daughter (she is 12) loved it and was amazed how easy it is. I added about a teaspoon of honey to sweeten it a little like other reviewers mentioned. Thanks Amy!

Simplicity is always the best! I like to use a bit of palm oil with my almond butter. Also, try mixing half blanched roasted almond with half natural roasted almonds when making almond butter. This gives a beautiful look and texture.

I'm rating this recipe as written. With my modifications, I think it's a 5 star recipe. I don't know if y'all realize, but adding the olive oil is completely unnecessary. If you keep processing the almonds past the ball stage (stopping periodically to scrape the sides of the bowl and break up the ball), the almonds release their oil and it becomes so smooth. No added oil necessary. I toasted the almonds first for 15 minutes in a 300 degree oven and then processed it. It can take 15-20 minutes of processing, but my cuisinart did it in 5.

With my blender I had to double the recipe to have it work. 1 cup was to small an amount to create the ball. Will try a few more times and may re-rate.

Mmm good. Finally something that makes celery tolerably! I roasted the almonds first, then processed the almonds with coconut oil, a packet of stevia and a dash or 2 of salt. ??

Tweaked the recipe by changing to canola oil (don't care for taste of olive oil) and sweetened with a VERY SMALL amount of honey, maybe a 1/4 tsp if that. Seasoned with a grind or two of sea salt. Agree that it needed a touch more oil so as the butter is not too crumbly.  Also toasted almonds before grinding. LOVE THIS  and will definitely make again. Thank you !

I find the easiest and least messy way to make almond butter is to use my ancient blender, you'll find your Mason jars screw right into the cutter base. This way when finished just put the lid on and all you have clean is the cutter base.  First grind a cup or so of almonds, you have to scrape the sides down a couple of times, then I add just a tsp of coconut oil and a tsp of honey and blend some more. Just let the almond butter cool down before twisting the cutter base off, it's HOT and builds up a pressure in the jar, so be careful.  I grind my coffee beans fresh every morning in the blender too, takes about 10-15 seconds.
Bon Appetito ...Shalom !

This was so easy. I left it on the crunchy side. So good.

I used coconut oil instead of olive and used almond shavings (toasted on the stove) because I didn't have any whole almonds. I suppose this would work with any nut and the proportions seem to be right on. Thanks a bunch for the idea!

I have made almond butter several times using different types of almonds.  I started to follow this recipe but used Dry Roasted & Salted Whole Almonds with 50% less salt. I took them time to chop them up to save my food processor. I processed them a minute at a time scrapping in between. I didn't have to add any oil, salt or honey!  I've learned that it's all about using the right nuts. Total time (including chopping) took 15 minutes.

Used my ninja food processor for this recipe. Added two tbs honey and one tbs maple syrup for my interpretation of perfect almond butter.

Thanks to all reviewers for recommending any oil but olive oil. I made this several times and I find it best to use coconut oil. Also, you need to wait until the almonds form a ball before adding the oil. I add no sugar but a little salt and some cocoa powder or I chop in a bit of dark chocolate.

Easy and it took less processing time than I expected. Added a little honey and a pinch of salt. Lots of "yums" all around the kitchen.
