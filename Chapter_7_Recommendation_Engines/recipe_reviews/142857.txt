"It's like a cross between food a bowel surgery."

Eat it before the bread dissolves. Brilliant.

Like a road accident of flavours. We used a chili sauce that was rich and had a hint of garlic. We also used three slices of bread and lightly toasted them all. We were apprehensive but both agreed it was surprisingly toothsome. The sandwich was more than the sum of its parts.

This was an AWESOME sandwich!!!!!!  I did only 3 slices of bread and 2 eggs, just cause I didn't think I could eat that much.  I was right, I was so full, but my gosh it was so good!  I wasn't sure if chili sauce meant some kind of hot sauce or the actual sweet chili sauce, but I did use a hot habanero pepper sauce and it was a great spicy contrast to the sweet chutney.  Will make this again for the husband definitely!!!

A must for all Red Dwarf fans!  I left the yolks a little soft, which really added to the overall flavour of the sandwich.  I definitely recommend toasting the bread lightly in a buttered saucepan.  And be sure to load on plenty of mango chutney and chili sauce.  We all agreed this was surprisingly tasty!

As a Red Dwarf fan, I've been wanting to make this sandwich for years.  Definitely requires toast, not the floppy bread they use on the actual show though.  We used a Korean sweet chili paste, and the mix of flavors was intense.  I'd have one every morning if I could!

Delicious! Another alternative (and a way to skip a few steps) grab some mango kuchela out of the import aisle of the grocery store. It's a Carribean preserve of mangos and green peppers and works so well with a little mayonaise or veganaise in place of the butter and multigrain bread.

The sandwich here is okay, but isn't really true to the the show.

Yummy! I served it on flaxseed toast with habenero mango chutney and a little bit of homemade mayonnaise. My partner and I were enchanted by the peculiar taste! Definitely a must-have (at least once in a lifetime) sandwich.

Been re-watching Red Dwarf and was inspired to give this a go. I toasted my three slices of white bread, fried three eggs, used mango chutney and classic Huy Fong rooster sriracha sauce. Good sandwich! Actually could have had more heat, so would add more chilli sauce (or a hotter one) next time.

I made this sandwich a number of times using 2 pieces of Doorstep bread and no butter, I didn't break the yolks but did use 3 fried eggs used the mango chutney to on the bread and chilli sauce on each egg, very nice, using Doorstep bread meant I had more time before it disolved, not much more though, very messy ??

Big fan of Red Dwarf. Have seen every episode. I tried this recipe, using a sweet mango chutney from the Indian "international" aisle of my local grocery store (Food Lion) and Siracha chili sauce. I liked the contrast of sweet-to-spicy but I wish I had gone more sparingly on the sweet chutney, or maybe purchased and used the alternative spicy chutney instead. I only used two eggs and two slices of bread.
