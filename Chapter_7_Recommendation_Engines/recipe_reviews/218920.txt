Just made this, and it's very good! It's basically a health-ed up version of Chex Muddy Buddies, with the chocolate/nut butter/powdered sugar combo. It's not as sweet, but it's definitely still a good treat. I used Wheat Chex for the healthy whole wheat, and it tastes very good with the chocolate coating. The cranberries add a nice flavor as well, and while I'm more or less indifferent to almond flavor, I like that this recipe is getting me to eat them since they're good for you. I didn't bother to buy almond butter, though - I just used Smart Balance peanut butter instead (less expensive! Sorry, Almond Board of California), and used a bit less so the PB flavor wouldn't overwhelm the rest of the ingredients. I might even cut it down further the next time I make this; I like a stronger chocolate flavor. The only other change I made was to skip the whole "shake together in a bag" step and simply stirred everything into the bowl with the melted chocolate mixture to coat it. Worked perfectly and reduced waste.
And to answer Karen's question - almond butter is basically like peanut butter; it's just made with almonds. It's not actual butter. If your grocery store doesn't have it in the same section as the peanut butter, you should be able to find some in the organic section, if your store has one. My Kroger carries several kinds of nut butters in its small organic section. But I honestly think peanut butter will work just as well if you can't find/don't want to buy almond butter.

This is really good, for a healthy alternative for the usual snack mix. Karen, almond butter is like peanut butter, but made with almonds instead.  I buy mine at Trader Joe's.

Meh, didn't have enough flavor in my opinion.  If I did it again I would double the sauce.
