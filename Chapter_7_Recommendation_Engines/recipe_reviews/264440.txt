I was staring in the fridge wondering what to make for dinner, and these ingredients were all available. Dinner was ready and being served in less than 30 mins!! Enjoyed the taste and the look of it - would make this for a dinner party! I used diced tomatoes instead of the crushed - a little more juice than it probably called for so I just cooked it a little longer.
