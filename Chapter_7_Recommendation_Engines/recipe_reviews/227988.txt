Yummy! Served it over spaghetti squash. I also added the jalapeño directly to the dish instead of using it as garnish.

Beautiful recipe.  I make this as well for my Egyptian husband and almost exactly how you do but I fry minced onion, garlic in ghee till golden and add my ground coriander to the fried mix then add into okra stew.  It's amazing.  I serve with home made wheat pita!

I like this recipe, it is very similar to a dish my Armenian friend makes, which he calls Cordish (spelling).  This recipe is a little bland for my taste as described here, but pleases the crowd well and is fairly simple to make.

I will be making this one frequently.  It's a very adaptable recipe.  If beef is pricey, you can use ground beef or other protein, or skip it all together.  
Can be made pretty quickly and eaten immediately.  No need to wait to let the flavors develop.  (Although I'm sure it will be even more amazing as leftovers.)
I served it over rice.  Would also be good over top of cornbread.
If you're a gumbo fan, I'm sure you'll like this too.

We enjoyed this recipe.  Very nice flavor.  We used chopped tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and water buffalo meat instead of beef.

Listen, I did add a couple of spices, celery & subbed low sodium chicken stock for water but honestly, it’s what immediately popped in my head, reading this recipe!! Browned lean ground beef, in separate skillet,sautéed a stalk of celery, onion & garlic in enameled pot, til crispy tender. Added coriander, cumin, 1tsp + 1/2 madras curry powder, & 1/2 tsp garam masala, browning slightly until fragrant, added okra, tomatoes & low sodium chicken broth instead of water, brought to a boil, simmered for about 30 min, added browned ground beef, and this is off the chain GREATNESS!

Omitted coriander due to personal preference.  My husband loved it and I liked it.  Will add to recipe box and make again in the future

It turned out pretty good, I used fresh okra. I felt it to be a little bland even after putting the jalepeno in the pot so I added some curry and that jazzed it up.
