thought this recipe was going to be good, but it was only mediocre. There's way too much chile flakes in this and the lime is too overpowering. needs more sugar to cut acidity.

Pretty good. I used green onions instead of yellow. Substituted sambal oelek for part of the red pepper flakes. Served over lettuce with no rice. Still not quite as good as what I've had in Thai restaurants.
