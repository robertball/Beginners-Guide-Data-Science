My entire family loved this recipe. I did make just a few changes though. Instead of cutting up the buns, I just opened them flat and layed them crust side up. I put the hot dogs in and then a layer of cheese over those. Then the chili and some more cheese. My buns didn't get to soggy at all, as a matter of fact, the bottom was just a little crispy and it was fantastic. Maybe because the crust was facing up, or the layer of cheese between the hot dogs and the chili? I did use two cans of chili though.This tastes just like it should and I will be making this for a long time to come. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Delicious & fun dinner idea!  My husband and I really enjoyed this. My children (11 & 5 yrs.) had mixed reviews.  They ate it, but their biggest criticism was the bread.  I guess they're purists (hot dogs ON buns, not the other way around, etc.).  I did use Hormel's low-fat Turkey Chili, and found that two cans would have been better than the one that I used.  Next time, instead of hot dog buns, I think I'll try using a prepared cornbread stuffing mix which would be crispier than the cut-up buns (although, I did lightly butter and toast them before adding the rest of the ingredients, but they still absorbed too much moisture from the chili than my kids liked).  Thanks for the idea, and I will be making this again. UPDATE ON 6/28/06:  WE HAVE TWEAKED THIS CHILI DOG CASSEROLE TO EVERYONE'S LIKING...LAYERED IN THIS ORDER:  2 OR 3 CANS OF HORMEL TURKEY CHILI W/O BEANS; 1 PACKAGE OF LOW FAT OR FAT FREE BEEF FRANKS CUT UP, DICED ONIONS, 1/2 PACKAGE LOW FAT SHREDDED CHEDDAR/MONTERAY JACK; 2 PREPARED PACKAGES OF JIFFY CORNBREAD MUFFIN BATTER SPREAD ON TOP, THEN FINISH W/ REMAINING CHEESE AND BAKE.  EVERYONE LOVES THIS, AND I THANK YOU FOR INSPIRING ME!  GREAT RECIPE IDEA!

I used whole wheat buns, kosher dogs, two cups of the Big Game Day Chili that I made the day before and used a 2% sharp cheddar. I didn't have any of it but my boys got a kick out of it. They loved that it was a new way to eat chili dogs. NOTE: This was so cheap to make that it should be illegal. I bought the hot dog buns off the clearance rack and everything else I already had on hand. Great for families who are stretching their food budget.

Very easy. We doubled the amount of chili on it, but we like 'em sloppy. Another trick to avoid soggy hot dog buns is to pop it under the broiler to quickly toast the buns before adding the chili and cheese.

This was a real family pleaser.It was very easy
to make.I used fritos in place of hotdog buns and
2 cans of chili per the suggestion of other 
reviewers.It would be very good for a Monday or
Friday night supper.I will be making this one
again!

This was good.  My 17 month old ate it without blinking.  I put my buns in the oven when I turned it one to preheat.  By the time the oven was hot, my buns were toasted perfectly.  I only made 1/2 a recipe.  I didn't think there was enough chili though and ended up using 2 10 oz cans of Hot Dog Chili.  It tasted pretty just like you would expect.  Next time I may preheat my chili though.  I found some of the center of my casserole didn't get very hot.  I also didn't think the buns got any soggier than if I was making a regular chili dog.  I will keep this recipe in mind for nights I need a quick meal.

My kids love this dish so much, I promised them I would serve it at my wedding.  Needless to say, it was a big hit!  I even attached the recipe to the thank you cards so everyone could enjoy it at home.  I enhanced the recipe by also adding crumbled corn chips on the top.  I have only two words for this recipe, mmm mmm!!!

This was sooooo good!  Changes I made: 2 cans 99% fat free Wolf brand turkey chili, fat free turkey dogs, 2% cheddar cheese, and I only used 6 of the hotdog buns (ran out of room).  Great low fat version.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

Great for a quick meal that's easy to put together. Does it show off expert cunlinary skills? Um, no. Is it a heart healthy meal? Definitely not. But after a long work day and late arrival home, I needed something I could get in the oven in minutes. My family ate it, and oldest DD proclaimed "I really like this!" I chopped up a whole package of hot dogs, tore up 6 buns, used 3 cans of chili and no onions (didn't feel like messing with it). I didn't measure the mustard, just squirted it on and then topped everything with the cheese. It baked for about 1/2 hour and was ready to eat! Definitely will be using this recipe again. Want to try it with leftover homemeade chili.

Something went askue in this recipe with the proportions!  The flavor was just ok....8 hot dog buns in a 9x13 pan need 3 CANS of chili, not one 15 oz.  One 15 oz. was barely enough to spread a smear over the top.  This then will feed a football team!  So if you're looking for around 4 servings, use 4 hd buns, 4 weiners, and one can of chili in an 8x8 dish.  For little kids or really hungry boys, this might be an ok recipe - but for myself, husband, and 13 year old daughter - we'll pass and buy a chili dog at Weinerschnitzel!!

I had to cut this recipe way back, as only Mr. Drew and Ty-Ty like hotdogs. Ash'ba'gash" and I look at them at say, "yeah, whatever". I liked the idea of the corn chips because the kids love topping their chili with them, but I did add one hot dog bun that I toasted. The wienie lovers thought this rocked Dana! Hey gal buds, please say a prayer as my bro is undergoing brain surgery tomorrow....thanks and xoxo

This is an awesome idea, however I think the soggy bread turned my son "the chili dog lover" off.  I used my own chili (I omitted the onion because it was in my chili), and used half bun half frito on the bottom.  I agree with other reviews that I should have just used the fritos.  Next time I'll go for the chili cheese fritos to add some kick!  Thanks for the idea Dana & Donna!!

These were really good.   We did what other suggested and toasted the buns a bit first and we omitted the onions.  They weren't as good the next day as leftovers (maybe cause the buns got soggy over night).  Thanks for the recipe

Here is what I did based on reviews:  I only used 4 hot dogs and buns and a smaller baking dish.  I used 1 can of chili, 1 tbsp. dried diced onions, and 1 cup cheese.  I left off the mustard due to personal preference.  I opened up the hot dog buns with the crust side up, per another reviewers suggestion.  Turned out pretty good!  Even one of my picky sons ate it.

My kids liked this one a lot.  I think I prefer the traditional way of making a chili dog myself.  It's not like this recie makes it any easier to make a chili dog.  I gave this a try because I made a big pot of chili for dinner a few nights before and I wanted to use up the left-overs and this sounded like a good way to do it.  Not  horrible but not an all time favorite either.  Might make it again if my kids request it.

This was the first thing I ever cooked! I picked it b/c not only is it easy, but it's something most people will enjoy and it's pretty fool proof. Well, I was right! I made it for my fiance and he LOVED it! It was a huge success! I'm making it again this weekend to take to my parents house so they can try it too! It's delicious, fast, and easy! Don't think it's "just" a chili dog. I was debating to cook it or not b/c it would be faster to just make chili dogs, but the way it is cooked makes it SO much better!

I am not a fan of canned chili therefore I used brick chili.  Canned chili to me is very runny.  And I used the hog dogs whole not cut up.  Nothing left in the pan.  Everybody loved it.  I have one grandson who doesn't like onion's so maybe next time I will make 2 one with onion's and one without.  Also used Pepper Jack Cheese for a little kick.  Will make many more times.  Nancy

I followed one reviewer's advice and toasted the buns in the oven before adding the rest of the stuff and it did not come out soggy. It was pretty good.

Not normally what I would make, only change was to use home made bread (honey wheat) instead of the hot dog buns. A little dry, will use 2 cans chili next time, but absolutely LOVED it! Thanks for the recipe, Dana.

I made this for my son and my husband last night.  They both loved it.  I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan - still needed a 15oz can of chili.  Mine was not soggy at all - I sliced the hotdog rolls on a slight diagonal and layed them in the bottom of the pan.  I then put a scant 1/2 c. colby jack shredded cheese mixture over the bread.  I used good quality Hebrew National all beef hotdogs and Denison chili.  Will add this to my "family favorites" list - thanks so much!

A 5-star when it came to how quick and easy, and a 5-star about how my 4 kids (ages 2-16) all LOVED it! I did put the open up the buns and put them crust side up in the pan and I did use two can's of chili.  I am the one who hates anything soggy and I have no complaint about this recipe-it rocks!   I told a few friends about it and had to make them copies of the recipe.  I am going to try to make it with chili with no beans, next time since that is the only part he didn't like.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Five stars for flavor alone!  I made this with 2 cans of chili and that was just right.  I also browned the hot dogs in a hot skillet for extra flavor.  The only thing about this recipe is that it really should only be an occasional treat because it's a high fat/cal dish.  Worth the try and will make again (in a few months)!

I first downloaded this recipe in 2001, and have used it too many times too count, and given the recipe to a lot of friends.  This is one of my favorite "comfort" food casseroles.  Thank you!

Found this recipe to be quick, easy, and hassle free allowing me to accomplish other things. Do not make my mistake and use other than pure beef hot dogs.

My family and I love this recipe. The only thing we do differently now is, instead of buns on the bottom, We fry some french- fries. Its awesome this way. You get chili dogs and chili cheese fries at the same time. Yummy!

Well, many times we end up eating part of our chili dogs with a fork so why not just make a casserole?!  I found this recipe and decided to try it because we had 1 leftover hamburger bun, a couple hot dog buns, and about 6 hot dogs and 2 brats.  I made this in an 8x8 pan because I was using leftovers and a smaller amount of buns than recommended.  I only had chili with no beans on hand so I used it with a can of chili beans for more filling.  My buns weren't soggy either.  They were soft on the chili side and firmer, almost crispy on the pan side.  I did warm up the hot dogs and leftover brats in the microwave before adding to the casserole dish and glad I did because I'm not sure they would have heated thoroughly enough for my liking.  I agree with other reviewers that if making in a 9x13 pan, more chili would be better.  It wasn't the prettiest of meals on the plate, but what do you expect from a chili dog casserole?

This is as close as you're going to get without making individual chili dogs. The bread nearest the bottom gets a little crunchy making a nice crust. I usually double the dogs and the chili. One package of buns is enough to carry it. We all like it. I would suggest however to reserve some "home made" chili and not using canned. It's a taste thing....

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! My family really enjoyed it and I look forward to making it again.  For those of you having trouble with soggy bread, you might want to reverse the layering of the ingredients like I did:  Chili first, then hotdogs, followed by onions, mustard, cheese, and bread last.  The moisture stays on the bottom, and the bread bakes up golden brown and delicious.

My husband and I loved this.  My son turned his nose up at it though.  Since I was only making it for 3 people, I used 3 hot dog buns and kept the other indgredients the same, except I used a little less cheese.  Will make again!

I used two cans of chili and instead of buns I used stale bread ends. It is so delicious. It is a favorite with my husband and his guy friends and is so easy to make with ingredients always on hand - a great last minute dinner.

I spread the mustard on the buns first and I didnt tear them up my buns were day old so no chance they would get soggy. I cut the cheese in half because its so pricey right now. This was a good weeknight dinner with a salad. Thanks

This is an easy, fun, simple supper. My kids I think would rather eat just a chili dog but my husband and myself thought it was good. I toasted my buns about 3 minutes in the broiler and cut the hot dogs in pieces! Would be better with homemade chili but used what I had on hand and it was just hormel!

I really enjoyed this but I made a few changes. I used prepared chicken stuffing on the bottom instead of hot dog buns. I used 6 oz but I would double that next time. I only used 4 turkey hot dogs and 1 1/2  cups of cheese. I used a 15 oz can of chilli which seemed like the perfect amount so if you use the original recipe, I would use more chilli. I also sprinkled garlic powder and garlic salt when it came out of the oven. My husband added red pepper flakes to his dish. All in all it was a really good dish.

I agree with the tip to broil your buns, get a little outside crisp on them before you start layering, yum. I  also altered my hotdogs a bit for Halloween, I made little "dead men" out of them and put them on top. I posted a pic. for you :)

This is the best and tastiest way to use leftovers!  I used hot dogs from a barbecue and old hot dog buns.  I left the hot dog buns sit overnight (they became stale) and I used Castleberry's Hot Dog Chili which is low cal but tasty.  My brother-in-law, a former Army Cook, prefers potato buns versus hot dog buns.  Either way, this is a great recipe.  Eye ball the ingredients and use more versus less hot dog chili.  This is a keeper!!!!

This was excellent - a huge hit with everyone!  I followed the recipe closely, but the actual items you use can affect the flavor. We use Hebrew National hot dogs, the 97% fat free, and the spicy beanless chili by Hormel (DH will not eat beans), oh and two cans of it.  For the buns I tried making my own using the Buttermilk Wheat Bread recipe that I make hamburger rolls from - they were a bit dense this time but that actually worked perfectly in this, they didn't get soggy and the bottoms got a little crispy which I really liked.  For the cheese - although I love cheddar, I had some Montery Jack to use up so I used half that and half sharp cheddar.  I did add the onion & mustard too, that's how I like my chili dogs anyway :) Everyone really loved this and we'll have this again!

This was really pretty good.  I didn't think one can of chili was enough, I used a beanless, so I added a can of light red kidney beans.  All I had on hand, chili beans would have been nice too, but it was still chili enough.  The juice from the beans, when added to the chili, made it easy to distribute over the casserole.  I opted against the mustard.  Chili dogs are so messy and you end up eating it with a fork anyways, so this is a good solution.  This was quick and easy and everyone liked it.

Thank you very much for the recipe - my family loved it!!!  I made a couple of changes to it. I omitted the mustard and buns. Added about 1/2 cup whipping cream to the chili before pouring it on the hotdogs, and sprinkled the whole dish w/ breadcrumbs and then the cheese. We served it w/ rice -- YUMMY!!!!!!

I give it a 3 and the kids give it a 5. I knew they would. I subbed the hot dog buns with tatter tots. (everyone loves tatter tots) And the rest I did as said. It's def a kid pleaser and a fun meal. Will prob only make once or twice a year since it's not healthy at all!!!! But it's nice to throw the rules out the window once and a while.

I made this last night and it was pretty good. This is the same ingredients that I use when making chili dogs, so its great to incorporate it into a casserole dish. Next time I will toast my buns first. They got a little soggy after baking. Also if you can get skyline brand(Cincinnati style) chili where you live, I highly recommend it for this. And dont use the canned, use the frozen, or make it yourself! The canned always leaves the chili with a tin flavor, yuck. Overall this was a super fast and easy meal. This can be very versatile by adding different ingredients to it. I think next time it would be good to add in some rotel tomatoes! Oh yeh, by the way, I added chili cheese fritos on top to give it some crunch.  They made the whole recipe!  I will make again for sure, thanks!

Chili dog you eat with a fork. Yum! This was okay and made for some savory hotdogs. I did make one change though I did not cut up the buns and hot dogs. I just filled the buns w/ the hot dogs and chili as you would any regular hot dog. Then I added additional chili on top, some onions, some shredded cheese and crumbed bacon. I put this all in the oven and baked and it was really good. I topped it all off with mustard.

I followed another review and changed the recipe a little.  I place 2 cans of chili on the bottom of a casserole dish, followed by a layer of hot dogs, a layer of cheddar cheese, then 2 packages of jiffy corn bread, finally finish with some additional cheese on top.  It is a really simple, quick Saturday lunch and my kids love it!

This was good and really easy. My youngest had 2 helpings so I was very pleased. This is great for those "I don't have time to cook" nights and it's cheaper (and simpler) than going to the drive-through.

I enjoyed making this recipe.  I tweeked it by putting the chili and onion on bottom of the pan then put the hot dogs and some cheese and then I broiled the buns til they were toasted.  Then I tore them up and set them on top and then topped it with more cheese.  VERY VERY TASTEY!  Everyone in the household loved it....Will make again.

Made this for a church potluck.  I used a full pack of buns and hotdogs, didn't want leftovers.  I thought it was a bit dry, will add more chili if I make it again.  Everyone seemed to like it.  I will probably make it again.

Made as is, I'd give this  4 stars. I made this with a cornbread top as suggested by others, but for me it was a big mistake. I didn't like the flavor at all.

Great idea. I would have gave it 5 stars but it was a little dry. Next time I will use 2 cans of chilli.

I have got to say this was easy and very good.  I toasted the buns first and used double the amount of chili.  Served it with onions and mustard on the side.  Yummy. I will make this again.

I agree with many posters that this could use a bit more chili.  Many people commented that the buns were "too hard".  I didn't find this to be true.  Some of it depends on what type of chili you're using and how you spread things over it.  I covered it completely with cheese, which I think prevented the buns from getting too hard.  The edges were a bit harder, but it reminded me of toasted buns, which I like.  I have made this several times, and will continue making it in the future.  After the first few times, I did start doing it in an 8x8 pan and halving the recipe, since it does make quite a bit.

I made this for my husband and I.  By the next day it was all gone.  The only thing I did different was used 19oz. of chili and covered the top with cheese until I could not see anything under the cheese.  I will be making this again soon.

This is SOOOO easy and SOOOO good.  I only tore up 6 buns because my pan was getting full.  I used 8 hot dogs, 2 - 15 oz cans of chili and topped it with cheese.  I left the onion and mustard off, those that wanted it added it later.  My buns were not soggy at all, they were a little crispy.  This makes ALOT of food and it is very filling.

This was fantastic!!! My husband and I gobbled this up.  We followed other suggestions and used 2 cans of Hormel (hot) Chili.  I also doubled the onions.  Putting the hot dog buns crust side up definitely kept them from getting soggy (they got pretty crisp on the underside).  Great recipe!!

My kids loved this.  It certainly does taste like a chili dog.  We did use some healthier ingredients such as whole wheat buns, low fat hot dogs, low fat cheese, and turkey chili.  The recipe was very kid friendly; my 8 year old made it almost all by himself and it was very quick.  As good as it was it wasn't 'awesome' hence the 4 stars.  We will have this every once in a while, when we are in need of a quick throw together dinner.

I tried this twice--the first time with chili beans and the second time with chili hot dog sauce.  Both times I made a half batch but used a whole can of the chili based upon previous reviews.  I really disliked it the first time with the beans because I didn't like the texture of the beans with the mushy bread.  The second time I realized that I just didn't like the taste of this all that much.  I definitely won't be trying it a third time.

We really enjoyed this simple meal. I left the hot dogs buns whole. I just split them open and then put them in the oven while it was pre-heating. I sprinkled a little cheese over the buns and  I then used good beef hot dogs and put a layer over the cheese. I used canned chili without beans and it was thick enough it didn't soak through to the buns. I served the onions and mustard on the side along with relish. The crunch of the onions was a perfect compliment. Will make this again. Very tasty and VERY easy!

AWESOME! my pickey 8 yr old said.  Well, four kids ate all but 1/3 of my 9x13 pan.  I did broil the buns first...I only used 5, and I did add 1/2 a bag of Frito Scoops (crunched up in big chunks), also I used two cans of chili (one spicy and one regular).  They loved it.  Thanks for the recipe Dana.

This is the easiest recipe I think I have ever put together, including grilled cheese sandwiches.  My family of picky boys just loved it - they consider hot dogs to be a food group unto their own.  I used leftover homemade chili instead of canned and it is a great used of less than fresh buns.  Left the onions out for everyone to garnish as they wish.  Definiately a keeper.  Will maybe try fries or fritos the next time I make this tasty family favorite.

My family and I thought this was just o.k.  Even though I toasted the buns ahead of time, they still got soggy during baking.  Perhaps that is because I used my own chili instead of the canned, which tends to be more pasty.  We will probably just make regular chili dogs in the future.

I made this a long time ago, and was going through my recipe box and though it had a 1 star rating, it said I hadn't ever written a review.  I remember this dish DISTINCTLY ...I made it for myself and my friend who are BOTH chili dog lovers.  I made it with my own homemade chili, NUTS what a waste...the buns were soggy, and I have an aversion to soggy food anyway, but the overall dish left much to be desired.  The mustard made it taste even stranger.  I thought that this would be a pretty decent recipe given the high reviews and the ease of preparation, boy I was sadly mistaken.  I will not make this again.

My kids loved it. This is a very easy recipe. I listened to some of the other reviews about the buns being mushy so i buttered then buns and toasted them in the oven before breaking them up and adding the hotdogs and chilli. I also left out the mustard just didn't sound appealing to me at the time(maybe next time). thanks!!!!

This turned out great. I didn't use the onions or mustard and all my picky eaters asked for more.

This recipe is very easy to make and the kids enjoyed it. After reading some of the previous reviews I decided to toast the buns before I put them in the dish so they would not get soggy and I addded 3 cans of chili.

This recipe was good, but a little salty. I used the fritos.... I loved the texture they added, but it was a little salty for my family. I will probably try it again though, maybe with the Honey bbq fritos or something?

My 5,4 & 1yo & hubby loved this dish. All of them had more then one serving. I made it with fritos instead of buns and served it with California Salad Bowl (from this site). I didn't like it at all, but chili dogs aren't my thing either. Good kids dish I think.

We didnt like this recipe very much. I tried it with the fritos, but I think that might have been worse. lol. sorry, I wont be making this again. the problem is that .... it is tolerable the minute  you take it out of the oven, but, if you have to re-heat it, it is nasty. my boyfriend hated it. my son, 3 years, wouldn't touch it. I thought it was okay, but I wouldn't make it again.

This recipe was pretty good. I didn't like it with the hot dog buns so next time I make it I am going to try Fritos as some have mentioned. Also not really a big onion fan but they weren't too bad in this recipe. This is a great quick fixer meal.

Definately not lowfat but my whole family liked it, even the picky eaters.  I followed previous suggestions and used two cans of chili.  I also made half with hot dog buns and half with fritos.  Both were good.  So easy my 10 year old son could make it. Even my brother-in-law liked the leftovers the next day.

Different style, I totally love this.  My kids loved it.  It is the first recipe that I have tryed on the internet and both kids ate and loved.  That is a thumbs up in my book.  I didn't have to cut up the two years food after the fact, because it is already done.  Great idea!!Thanks!!

It was easy and quick I made it before I went to work and put it in the fridge so that when my fiance got home he just had to put it in the oven.  I came home and everything tasted great.  My fiance ate about 4 serving sizes He loved it too.

I substituted corn chips for the hotdog buns. 
I found this much better for reheating the leftovers (If any). The Kids liked the "crunch" in every bite!

We loved it!  I made it for  Saturday lunch.  I halved the recipe as it is just my husband and I.  I used Castleberry's Hot Dog Chili Sauce.  It was a perfect blend of spicy and saucy!

Quick and easy and tastes good too!  I didn't make any changes.  I used Hormel chili with no beans.  The bottom of my casserole was crispy not soggy like I expected.  It was very good.  As I put it together I thought it was gonna need another can of chili but it was fine as is.

took this to a 4th of july bbq and it was a huge hit! everyone was asking for the recipe... best part was it is very kid friendly which is a major plus for family events.  i skipped out on using the buns and just used the fritos as suggested by other reviewers.  i also recommend using two cans of chili as well.  on top i sprinkled a mexican/taco blend of shredded cheese instead of the plain cheddar... sooo good!!!

I really wanted to like this recipe. My kids love hot dogs, so I was looking for something else to do with the and found this recipe. unfortunately it was a big salty mess. I I put the rolls down on the bottom, cut up the hot dogs and put them on top, 8 hot dogs cut up got lost on the bread, just didn't seem like enough, so I used 16 hot dogs. one can of chili didn't cover the dish, so I used 2. even the kids didn't like it, they just picked out the hot dog pieces.

If you like chili dogs, you'll love this. It's great because you really dont need to follow a recipe for it, just put whatever you like on a chili dog in a casserole dish and voila. So easy!

This was pretty tasty and I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs. I almost left off the mustard as it seemed odd, but I trusted the advice of other reviews and left it. I'm glad I did; it gave it an extra kick! This was an easy low cost meal that will get added into my rotation.

Halfed the recipe, used 3 toasted hot dog buns and 5 hot dogs. I tore the hot dog buns after toasting them and placed the crust side up according to the suggestions. Also i just added chopped onion to half because my husband is not a fan of onion. I did use the mustard and it tasted great. The recipe was ok. Next time i need to make some adjsutments because the bread was chewy and kind of hard. maybe just bake the hotsdogs an chili with mustard onions and cheese and serve with a piece of french bread or something. Or maybe just not toast the hotdog buns. Either way i will try it again sometime or another! Tahnks for sharing!!!

I made this today and the kids loved it.  I tweaked it a little bit.  I sautéed hot dogs in a skillet until browned and added diced onion to hot dogs and sautéed a little longer.  I doubled the chili as well.  I served ketchup,mustard, sour cream and diced pickles on the side for toppings of choice.  This is a keeper.

I made this for a 4th of July party and everyone loved it - to my surprise. I tore up the buns into bite sized pieces so that people didn't have to worry about cutting at all - also browned them a bit before putting hotdogs on top (on broil.) I added the mustard and it really added a nice tang. Instead of putting onions in (which I'll do next time) I served diced red onions for people to sprinkle on top. Will definitely make again - serves a lot of people and VERY easy to make.

I will be making this instead of chili dogs from now on. I was a little skeptical and honestly worried about the bun/hot dog/chili ratio but in the end it was perfect and I wouldn't change a thing.

Easier and less messy than the traditional chili dog.  I spiced up the chili with some hot sauce (Pico Pica) and used sharp cheddar cheese.  Loved it.

Made this for dinner tonight and the husband LOVED it.  I used the revised recipe with corn muffin mix instead of hot dog buns and it turned out really good.  It was especially yummy topped with ketchup and mustard.

This was excellent. I agree, toast your rolls first, and I'll use home made chili next time. It'll add more flavor. Everyone loved it. Will definately make again.

Really easy fun dish for the kids.  I did not have the sogginess that some other reviewers had.  Used Hormel chili w/o beans, and did not toast the bread beforehand.  Hubby loved it, so did the little ones!  Really good!

We made this last night for the Super Bowl.  Instead of hot dog buns, our bottom layer was crispy tater tots (crispy so they'd soak up some of the chili).  And, based on other reviews we used 2 cans of chili, one with beans and one without.  It was a hit and we only had one serving left over!  Thanks!

My husband just loved this! Toasting the bread seemed to work quite well as it wasn't soppy at all. Chili dogs have always been a favorite of my husbands and mine so we were just thrilled with this recipe! Thank you so very much for a new favorite! :)

This is a great "first day" recipe.  Meaning it tastes awesome the first day but it is so rich that eating seconds and eating it on the second day made me nauseous.

I would make a small batch!  Very tasty

This was hearty and yummy! Next time I'll add more chili (I used turkey chili) and I'll leave off the onions, they were too crunchy for me. I may also put a layer of chili under the buns since I think I would like the buns softer. But I will definitely make this again and again.

Simple, cheap, and my boyfriend thought this was awesome (he LOVES hot dogs, for whatever reason, I'm not sure). :) I didn't have any hotdog buns, so I used 3 whole wheat hamburger buns. Split them in half, left each side whole instead of tearing them up, and layed them in a casserole dish, stuck them under the broiler for about 5 minutes, flipped them over and broiled for another 5 or so. They were nice and crispy after this and held the crispiness even after the chili was added. I used 1 can of Hormel Chili that had Tabasco in it and spooned that onto each hamburger bun, covered with cheese and baked for 25 minutes, then added another layer of cheese for the last 5 minutes. Omitted the mustard and onion since my boyfriend isn't a fan of either, but the Tabasco in the chili made up for any lack of flavor. The hamburger buns worked perfectly because it designated portion size. My boyfriend thought this was great 'man-food', so I'll add it to my recipe box. Thanks!

This was pretty tasty.  Used all 10 hot dogs from the package and probably more chili (used homemade).  Forgot the mustard.  Had request for the recipe from a potluck, so that tells you it's a good one!

This was good.  Exactly what I expected.  I used more hotdogs than called for, 2 cans of chili, and only half the amount of bread.  And I put the mustard on the hot dog buns.  Not gourmet fare, but tasty.  I will make this again.

I made this using the suggestions in Deana Manfredi's review (first one below the recipe itself). Nice recipe for a busy-day supper and I made it when our three grandchildren were visiting. I think, however, that it would have been better if I had either A) used the hot dog buns, or B) used only one package of Jiffy mix. There was too much bread and too little meat mixture. Whether you decide to with the cornbread mix or the buns, do use at least two cans of chili, and do add cheese. I think adding some chopped dill pickles would have added something as well. Still, my grandkids liked and it was easy for me, so I'll probably make it again.

Great recipe.  Not as messy as eating an actual chili dog.  Easy to throw into tupperware for lunch at work.  I didn't mind that the bread got soggy.   Used two cans of chili.  My son ate it as leftovers two or three times, which he rarely eats leftowovers at all.

My boyfriend loved this casserole.  I liked it, but wouldn't be able to eat it once a week, and definitely wouldn't be able to eat it left over, the bread was like moosh. Like everyone else I used 2 cans of chili, and used 6 buns, 8 would have been too much.  If you're making this recipe for 3 or less people I recommend  halfing the recipe and putting it in a smaller dish, because it's definitely not something you'd like to eat left over.  This dish would be good to make a bunch of guys watching a football game or something.  It was a super easy recipe.

I made this last night, and it turned out really good. I liked it alot, and my boyfriend LOVED it. I cut the recipe in half for just the 2 of us, and used 4 hot dog buns, 5 beef franks, an 11 oz. can of Hormel hot dog sauce, some diced onions, and about a cup of sharp cheddar cheese. I layered everything in an 8x8 pyrex dish, and baked for 30 minutes. I left out the mustard for my boyfriend, but added some to my serving after it was baked. YUMMY! This is a great quick, easy, and CHEAP meal. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very tasty recipe. I used Hormel turkey chili, and turkey franks. Next time, I'll try lining the pan with toasted split buns instead of tearing them into pieces. I'll also thin the chili slightly to make it easier to spread uniformly.

Unsurprisingly, the key to this recipe is the dogs and chili you use. While I prefer this recipe to Chili Dog Casserole II, I didn't like the cheese weiners I used here as much as the smokey franks I used previously. Also, I didn't realize that the chili I bought for CDCI had beans in it, which I also didn't much care for. I will definitely make this again (so quick, cheap, easy and tasty) but I'll check out the Hormel chili that seems so popular with other reviewers. Thanks, Dana!

This is a good recipe to make something cool & yummy & easy....It is more filling than regular hot dogs w/ chili.... I used regular bread both times I made it. The first time the bread came out soggy; the second time I toasted the bread before hand & it came out crispy. Top with 1/2 chopped onion and a swirl of mustard....Yummy!

This was very good (for a easy/quick dish).  I used one can of Hormel Chili with no beans and two cans of Tony Packos hot dog sauce, mixed togther with the mustard.  I also used Deli style hot dogs (large and juicy) which are much better for this recipe than typical hotdogs.  Handcut and homemade french fries, with malt vinegar were a nice sidedish, reminding me of fairs and baseball games.

Nothing fancy but my husband who was dissapointed to hear what we were having for dinner (he doesn't like hot dogs) ate seconds because the bread and the chili kind of make the rest ok. 18 month year old liked it too. We just used some bread that was nearing its end intsead of hot dog buns.

This is a great and quick kids meal.  I break the buns up into very small pieces and let the whole thing sit for a while so the chili will soak into the bread.  I also give the kids ketchup to add to their plate because a couple of them REALLY like it that way.  
Letting the kids help make this recipe is probably what made it a hit- when they figured out it actually was hot dogs, just mixed up- they really liked it.

If you feel like hot dogs, this is it! Tastes just like a chili dog you eat with a fork! I didn't put in the onions until after so that everyone could put however much they wanted. I toasted the buns before I added everything else and they didn't get soggy. Plus I had Fritos at the table as well. Definately, make this again!

Wonderful teen (and husband) pleasing recipe, inexpensive, easy to throw together for a crowd, (when adjusted)and our kids can make it themselves! I added an extra can chili beans with the chili so it wouldn't be dry and cut the buns to just cover bottom of the pan I was using.

This recipe was horrible! My kids wouldn't eat it and they generally are good eaters. I doubled the chili because it looked too dry;that didn't help. I think if I was to make this again I would omit the buns entirely add salsa. The existing recipe was WAY too dry.

WHOA!  This recipe ROCKS!  Couple of suggestions:  I agree with the corn chip substitution and the two cans of chili.  I browned my hot dog pieces in butter with the onion then added the chili, some black beans and mustard and mixed together and heated through then poured it over the fritos.  Then topped off with the cheese.  WHOA!  NOT lowfat!  WHO CARES?

I tried this out tonight and the verdict is:  pretty good.  It was *much* richer than I had expected it to be, so there's lots of leftovers, but it will make a perfect lunch in the morning!  I think next time I'll use a combination of cheeses, as plain cheddar is too strong for my personal taste.  Definitely add a second can of chili - one can would have made it turn out extremely dry.  With 2 cans, it's perfect!

When I accidently left out the mustard in preparation, it was decided that might be
for the better as it could then be added by each individual's taste.

This is very economical and a real "kid pleaser".

1. What a great way to use stale hot dog buns!
2. Omitted the onions (onions turn my kids off).
3. I used a combination of jack & chedder cheese.
4. Used my own home made chili and I'm sure I had more than the called for amount.
5. Made this with my two finicky eaters and my friends two finicky eaters.  My daughter and her two sons had seconds - than never happens!  My four year old son had 4 helpings!  Incredible!!!

Great job Dana!

My family loved this recipe, I cooked this caserole 3 times the way the recipe shows and one time instead of hotdogs I used honey ham, to give a sweet and salty flavor it was great. My daughter is 2 and she wanted seconds, I cook this on a night when I am real tired because it is soo easy to make, thanx!

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my family. May take a little improvising at first (need more cheese or chili) to fit how you like it. 2009 UPDATE: We have now been making this for years, it has become a regular meal at our house, so much so that I think I am completely burnt out :-) Hubby insists that we have this once a month and we've just had our first of at least three children so I've got a while before I can retire this recipe :-) I've give this recipe to many coworkers who have now all incorporated it in their regular meals. WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!

i made this for dinner the other night. although i normally don't change a recipe until i 've tried it first (after reading reviews) i made a few changes. i  increased the onion to one whole onion, sliced. i also added 1 tsp garlic powder. i think next time i will use canned coney sauce instead of canned no bean chili and i will also not use a whole package of hot dog buns, maybe just 5 or 6 instead of 8.  although it looks strange, surprisingly it is very good. quick to put together and bake. i served with baked beans and chips and dip.

My only changes is I use 2 cans of  chili, and I never seem to use all the buns. I cut the buns in 1 inch pieces and layer them in the baking dish. It usually takes 5 or 6 buns to cover the entire dish. I also omit the onion, because I don't like onions on my hot dogs. It's delicious and easy, and a go to for us when we need a quick dinner.

I kicked up this recipe first i used small elbow pasta instead of the hot dog buns as my base. I used kielbasa along with Chirizo  marinated in sweet baby rays BBQ sauce with a couple of dashes of cayenne ( yes this will bring some heat) in place of just hot dogs topped that with a shallot and mozzarella cheese. Then the chilli  spooned that over the entire  dish then topped that with  half mustard half medium salsa  final topping of Monterrey jack/ Cheddar cheese.  A bit more adult and not for the squimish  when it comes to heat.

Tasted pretty good and was real simple to make.  I ended up using mozerella cheese instead and added ketchup as well.

I was looking for something to do with hot dog buns I needed to use up. This was good, and I usually eat my hot dog with a fork anyway lol. I halved it in a 9x9 pan. Three buns seemed like plenty. I also used 5 hot dogs, dried minced onion (more kiddo friendly), and 1 Can off Hormel chili. It was good and I’ll make it again, but next time I’ll cut up the buns in smaller pieces and maybe add another hot dog. It seemed to be a lot of bread. Oh and I added diced jalapeños and bacon bc that’s what we put on our hot dogs :) I also think it would be really good with chili cheese Fritos on top. Thanks for the recipe!

Toasted the buns while the oven was preheating. Used only four buns, four hot dogs and two cans of chili. This was a great tasting, easy dish to make with ingredients already on hand.

I love this little casserole.  Someone said the buns were soggy, but mine weren't soggy at all. But toasting them a little while pre-heating the oven isn't a bad idea. I made it once slicing the hot dogs to make 2 long pcs, and another cutting up the hot dogs. I think i prefer cutting them up. No need to use canned Tex. chili though.  Just cook up your ground meat (I use turkey) and add chili spices, or even a taco seasoning mix (love Trader Joe's). You can use a little tom. sauce or just add a little water after adding the spices to the cooked meat. But easy, sort of fun dish... and delicious!! I make it in a 9" x 9" baking dish... just cooking for 1 here, so it's probably 4 meals. Oh, and I use Mexican style shredded cheddar.

I was looking to change up the basic chili dinner and the concept of this casserole did not disappoint. I used homemade chili and instead of hot dog rolls, I made corn bread. I prepared the corn bread and baked it in a cast iron skillet until just before it was set. I then added the hot dogs (that I grilled), the condiments, the chili, and the cheese. I cooked the casserole until the cheese was melted and bubbling. The whole family loved it.

I liked the convenience but way too much buns, 4 buns covered the bottom of my 9 x 13, I had 2 cans of chili and ended up needing both for a full layer of chili and felt it needed more. The flavor was ok, not like a real chili dog.  The buns got soggy which I liked and the onions stayed almost raw, another plus in my book but don't think I'll make again. I am glad I tried though, thanks.

It was delicious! I made a few changes to make it healthier and tastier, as per several user reviews. I used whole wheat bread instead of hotdog buns, and I toasted them approximately halfway through before placing them in the casserole dish. I used five pieces of bread (four whole pieces and one torn apart to fill-in any remaining gaps in the casserole dish). I also used vegetarian chili, doubled the chili, used turkey dogs, and excluded onions.

I left out the onions, used 2 cans of chili, and mixed the mustard in with the chili, to distribute it more evenly.  I also substituted corn chips for the buns, as another reviewer had suggested.  Everyone who likes chili dogs will like this!

This is good, but I think some of the quantities are off.  Four buns covered the bottom of my pan, so I stopped there; I think 8 would have been way too many.  I also thought one can of chili didn't cover it enough, so I ended up adding another can.  I did make sure all the bun pieces were crust-side up, and they had a nice texture--slightly crispy on bottom, soft (but not soggy) elsewhere.

I was shocked by how good this was.  Took about 5 minutes to throw together and tasted great.  I used 2 cans of chilli instead of 1 since I had them.  Highly recommend giving this a try if you like chilli dogs.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night.  It turned out really good.  I took some advice from other reviews and tried them out.  I toasted my hot dog buns while preheating the oven, which seemed to really help out.  I also went on some other advice and used two cans of chili instead of one.  That gave the casserole better coverage.  I used Hormel chili.  It was a really easy recipe overall.  Quick and easy to prepare, not too long cook time, and was very tasty.  I'm sure I'll do this one again.

I made this last night for my boyfriend, but used tator tots instead of buns! It was fantastic and will definately make it again. I cooked tator tots until slightly browned and then added the rest of the ingredients as directed.I also used 8x8 instead of 13x9 and it was fine.

HA HA HA, I made this last night and my husband said I can never make this again because he nearly ate the entire 9 x 11 pan. I used 4 (buttered and toasted in the broiler) hot dog buns cut into bite size pieces, 8 deli dogs cut up into bite size pieces, 1- 38 oz. can of Stagg chili. I followed the directions as written and well it was really good. Needless to say I will make this again : )

this recipe was amazing! It was super easy and taste. I don't buy canned chill but I had some of my homemade chill in the freezer so I used that instead. I also omitted the onion and mustard because my chill has enough flavour already.

This is very good. My four year old loved it. However instead of using the canned chilli I used my mothers recipe for homemade hot dog sauce it was sooooo good. Even though it was good it is very high in sodium you can tell once you have finished eating it. Wouldn't make it that much but maybe for a special occasion or something like that.

I made this recipe the other night and did change a few things as some of the reviews suggested and it was delicious! I put the buns upside down so the crust was up, and added a layer of cheese over the dogs, then put the chili on.  I used Wolf Brand Chili, as it is not as watery and did not add the mustard.  Will definitely be making this again.  My husband loved it!!! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and daughter loved this recipe.  I did use two cans of chili.  I think 8 hot dog buns are a lot, I probably won't use that many again.  Next time I make it, I am going to try tator tots instead of buns.

This was not a hit at my house, my family asked me to never make this again, my kids could not even finish a serving.  The bread became soggy(I even toasted it before hand), the taste was dead on though.

This was good and my husband loved it.  I love mustard but for some rason do NOT like it in baked things so I will leave that out next time.  My bread on the bottom was fine.  The only major complaint I have is this isn't the least bit healthy for my kids.  Nexy time I think I will put corn it it.  Oh this would be perfect for a bbq!] party!

Big hit with 12 year old and hubby.  Both went back for seconds!  The buns to get a little crispy, but everyone seemed to like it.  I left off the mustard, not big mustard fans at my house.

This was a great recipe!  I loved it!  I only put onions on half b/c my kids don't like onions.  I also toasted the buns to cut down on soggyness.  My husband is not much of a hot dog eater, but to my surprise, he liked this.  The one thing he wants me to change is to save some of the toasted buns so he can use them separately to spoon it on.  And my oldests son requested more hot dogs to be put in next time.  All in all, very good.  Thanks for sharing!

This was better then I expected! I left out the mustard cause my husband doesn't like it. It needs 2 cans of chili one is definitely not enough. I also froze a head of time, thawed, then cooked & it still turned out good.

Such a simple idea!!  I am mad that I never thought of it!!  Thanks Dana for sharing this!!  It has become a favorite quick dinner at my house when everything else is running haywire, at least I know that I can get something quick and yummy on the table before the masses start getting crabby.  Thanks again for this simple, but tasty idea!!

I liked this dish, not enough to give it five stars my husband on the other hand ate just about the entire casserole all on his own, I had one scoop. I think it's safe to say he would give it five stars.

I enjoyed this for its simplicity and ease of preparation, as well as for the taste.  I only used 5 hot dog buns and toasted them in the oven while it preheated to prevent the sogginess others complained of.  I used 2 cans of chili - 1 wouldn't have been enough.  I also used the entire package of hot dogs and left out the onions (personal preference).  I will make this again.

I knew that coneys could somehow be made into a casserole. I tried using pasta but it didn't replicate the taste. Using toasted hot dog buns as the base did the trick. Also, the use of mustard and my favorite, Franks Hot Sauce, clinched it.

This is a really good kid-friendly recipe. If you use whole grain buns, low-fat cheese, low-fat chili it also can be pretty healthy. Thanks! And it's easy to make - always a plus!

This was good, and a nice way to change up coneys. To cut calories, I used only 5 buns, 97% fat free hot dogs, and only 1 cup of cheese. All mixed together, you really couldn't tell that I used lighter ingredients.

I've made this casserole 5-6 times now and my fiance and I love it.  The mustard really makes this dish.  It's perfect for sports get-togethers or just a night when you don't feel like cooking anything extravagant.  It couldn't be much easier!  Only thing I recommend is toasting the hot dog buns before layering them in the dish--helps them hold up a bit better after the chili covers them.

I was VERY surprised but this was really, really good.  My husband agreed.  The only change I made was turning the whole buns crust side up and toasting them a bit before I put the chili mixture on top.  I used Castleberry hotdog chili which isn't too great on its own but in this recipes was good.  I left off the mustard because I was skeptical but ended up adding it before serving...it really made the dish.

pretty good for a quick meal!! made with tater tots. I made less, 4 buns and 5 beef hot dogs, chili, onions and cheese, no mustard.  I was worried about the buns being soggy, but they were fine.  I will make this one again!

i made this out of desperation one night and now my husband won't stop obsessing.  since it has zero redeeming nutritional qualities i make it only once in awhile. i use half the amount of buns, dogs but entire can of chili - otherwise not enough chili to cover the top.

Wasn't impressed, basically just a chopped up chili dog...not horrible but don't see the point in a casserole.

This was just like eating a regular chili dog. The next time I made it I would probably add another can of chili as one can didn't seem like enough in my family.

Very good.  Did not use buns but topped with prepared Jiffy Mix.  Used canned chili, but I'm sure it would be even better with leftover homemade chili.

Made this for a Superbowl party.  It was okay.  Not the greatest and not a lot of flavor surprisingly.  I made it with the cornbread instead of the buns and doubled the amount of hotdogs the recipe calls for.  Didn't make anyone go "MMMMMM!" It was just okay.  The cornbread was lacking something.  I think next time I'll add chili powder and cumin in the cornbread for more flavor and maybe more mustard in the chili.  We love chili dogs, so this would be a great recipe if I could just figure out how to give it more "oomph!"

I like this recipe because it is cheap and very easy.  Due to what other reviewers said, I chose not to put the hot dog buns in the casserole because I didn't want to eat soggy bread.  Instead, after I cooked the casserole, I served it in hot dog buns.  I also cut the cheese in half because I didn't think so much was necessary.

I wasnt sure what to think when i made this, but was very pleasantly surprised. The torn up hot dog buns got a little crisp which was quite nice. I would make this again.

The Best. This is comfort food. I did toast the hot dog buns and chopped the onion really fine. So good. Can't wait to make again. Even the picky eaters ate it.

I just came across this and realized I never rated it over a month ago when I made it.  I had a large party where we had lots of leftover buns & hot dogs and this was perfect!  The kids really enjoyed this meal.  I did toast the buns for a bit in the oven before pouring on 2 cans of the hormel brand chili but otherwise followed the recipe.  It's not something I'd make frequently but we did enjoy it!

I loved this one, I also thought it had the right amount of chili. If you like soggy bread you might add more chili. But I liked some of the bread cruncy. Thanks I will be making this again.

This is a great recipe!  Everyone I have made it for has loved it!  It also works great to make a batch and freeze it.  To cook from frozen, I first thawed it and then cooked it per the directions.  Excellent!

Very easy recipe to personalize.  I cut up a bagette into chunks, browned in butter, chopped up 2 large all beef franks and sauted to crisp up, used homemade chili, the rest as the recipe said.  Very well received by adults.

This was great!  I modified it like others did.  I halfed the recipe and put in a 8x8, but used the whole can of chili.  I also toasted the buns while the oven warmed up.  My hubby does not like mustard so I just squirted some on my portion once it was on the plate.  YUMMY!

This was good I toasted the buns first made my own chili and used more hot dogs but next time I will just use 8.  The onions were a bit crunchy will leave off next time and put in a bowl on the table.

This was a great quick supper idea!  My family loved it.  I used chili w/out beans, and cooked the hot dogs first.  There was enough chil left over in the pan to make chili cheese fries!  Will put in the make again file.

This has become a staple in our house! Whenever I make chili I always make a pan of this with the leftovers. I've never added the onions or mustard, just use the chili as is. I also omit the hotdog buns and replace with a layer of Bisquick biscuits on the top, finished with some extra sprinkled cheese! Just great!

We thought this recipe was great!  I made chili the day before and we just used the leftovers.  I didn't put any mustard in (because I don't like it on my chili dogs), but my husband added some while he was eating it.  It was the same great taste as a chili dog without all the mess on your fingers!

What a fun meal! My 15 year old daughter made this for our family. Not the healthiest..but definately quick, easy and fun. My husband loves hot dogs and chili and always smothers it  with mustard..so we were sure he would like it..and he did. My daughter used a little less bun, a bit more hot dog, chili and cheese, but pretty much kept it the same as the recipe. She did place the buns in the oven while it preheated as someone suggested and the buns were not soggy at all. We will keep and use this one..thanks for the recipe.

my hubby and twins loved this. i liked it myself, quite a compliment considering i'm not too big on hot dogs. it was easy and all in one dish. seems less messy than the traditional chili dog. i tore up the buns into chunks, and added sliced jalapenos to one side of the dish. yum!

Loved the recipe, but would take out the mustard.  Didn't really do anything for the recipe, just the random bite, and then you taste it.  I really like the way that the crispy buns tasted!

I cannot believe how easy this recipe is.  I was worried the hot dog buns would be soggy but they were very crisp and delicious.  Thanks.

This was a pretty good recipe.  Like other reviewers have said, it definitely needs two cans of chili.  This is a great potluck recipe.

This is a great, quick weeknight recipe.  Not very healthy, unfortunately, but you can make it a little better for you by using fat-free franks and turkey chili.  I only used half the bread called for, and added two tablespoons of ketchup, which I drizzled over the top with the mustard.  I used colby/jack cheese because I didn't have any cheddar.  This was excellent and my family, hubby included, loved it.  I think I'll leave out the mustard over half the casserole next time to suit my picky six year old -- when she saw the mustard, she didn't want to eat anymore.  My 10 year old maintains that it's the best casserole she ever ate.

I made this for teenage boys, they loved it, I think next time i will toast the buns slightly before putting it together, a little crunch in there might be nice, thanks for sharing

4 stars because I modified it, using the instructions/modifications that Deana Manfredi listed below.  The kids LOVED it...the cornbread topping really gave it something special.  I don't think they/we would have liked it with any type of bread or buns on the bottom.  Thanks for the great idea though, never had thought of doing it in a casserole.  I also added a sprinkling of shredded cheese on top of the cornbread.

I agree with another reviewer on this recipe.  Seemed like a LOT of work for what tasted just like a chili dog.  Easier to make chili dogs and let each individual add their own ingredients to their liking...having said that....this recipe calls for WAY too much bread!  I used almost twice as many hot dogs just to make up the difference, and then I used 2 cans of chili.  Was good, but..it's still a chili dog! LOL  It's probably a good recipe to use for a football party or something then you don't have a whole bunch of individual bowls with condiments and then you have more space on your table for other foods.

I thought this was excellent.  Followed the advice of a previous reviewer and put the buns in the oven while it was preheating and that toasted them nicely.  They didn't get soggy either, but then I used quite a dry chili (I am vegetarian so I used a lentil-based vegetarian chili and vegetarian hot dogs).  I also left out the onions as there were already onions in the chili.  A really easy and scrumptious dinner!

Everyone I have shared this with LOVED IT ! Great for my picky hubby too!
I do change it up a little... I cut the hot dogs and fry them in a pan for a few minutes to give them a little more texture, and use 6 buns. I cook it a little longer for really crispy buns! Love it !

This was awesome!  I did use two cans of Hormel turkey chili with beans.  My sister-in-law laughed at me and said, "Why not just eat the chili dog??"  My three-year-old who will not eat chili dogs, gobbled this down and loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  Just had it leftover for lunch!  If you use stale hot dog buns, they don't get soggy.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

We decided to try this recipe because we had some leftover hot dog buns from our Memorial Day BBQ. This was very tasty and in my opinion, better than a chili dog because of the toasty buns and it was easier to eat with a fork. It was easy to make, quick and inexpensive. I used 5 hot dog buns, 5 hot dogs and 2 cans of Wolf brand chili w/o beans. I left out the mustard though because hubby doesn't like it. I used part colby jack and part sharp cheddar cheese. I didn't tear up the buns, but did slice the hot dogs up. Also, like some others suggested I put the buns crust side up and it wasn't soggy at all. We both really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again.

Chili Cheese Dogs!  Oh man, it doesn't get much better than that, does it?  I used two cartons of Stagg Chili with Beans.  YUM!  Next time, I am going to try this recipe with the tater tots instead of the hot dog rolls.  Mmm Mmm.

My fiance and I can't get enough of this meal! I've made it both with the buns face down and vice versa. Definitely helps the sogginess face down, but even face up, it's no different than a sloppy joe type sogginess. It's quick, easy, and easy on the wallet!

This was okay but nothing spectacular.  My boys didn't like it and DH thought it was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly and the hot dog buns weren't soggy like some had described.  It was quick and easy to make.  Probably a good idea for teenagers.

This tasted just like a chili dog.  My husband and I both enjoyed it. It was easy to make and quick.  I also took the advice of readers though and toasted the buns, otherwise they get a little soggy. Good recipe.

This was an ok recipe--I am not a huge fan of chili dogs but my husband is, and he wasn't really impressed.  However, it is quick and easy to make.

It was simple and good.  I would make it again.  Just like a Chili Cheese Dog.  I used 2 cans of chili instead of one.

I have to say this was just "ok". My husband and 7 yr old liked it, my 3 yr old barely ate any.  it  Followed the recipie, but toasted the buns first. Great idea, but it seemed to be missing something.

My family is very picky about what they eat, so I was hesitant to try anything new.  But this is just perfect, and it really is like eating a really big chili dog.  I loved it, will definitely make again!

I have always ment to rate this casserole, and never did. Today I am going to rate it. This is the 3rd or 4th time I've made this dish...........Every time it has been.........GREAT.  A hit with the whole family. It really does taste like a chili dog. It is a dish my family get a craving for and will ask for it. Very good. I have also passed it on to my sister-in-law. Her family loves it too........Good Job.....I also grew up in Flint, Michigan...Home to the Original Angelo's Coney Island......this casserole reminds me of eating coney's at Angelo's back when I was growing up and living and working in Flint......Try this casseroll....if you like coney's this is the casserole for you!!!!!

My kids liked this but my hubby and I thought it was just okay. I think the mustard ruined it for me. I usually like all this on my hot dogs but in the casserole it just tasted off. Weird huh? Maybe I will try again w/out mustard. It's a nice idea though.

Oh, this is a good one!  I followed previous advice and used two cans of Hormel chili and skipped the mustard.  This was awesome with ketchup drizzled on top when served.

This was really good...and a really good source of heartburn!  But, what great chili dog isn't?  I followed suggestions and toasted the buns first.  Used 2 cans of Hormel chili and it turned out perfectly.  My hubby wanted the leftovers for lunch the next day.

i made this for my husband and i using 4 hot dogs and 3 hot dog buns in an 8X8 casserole dish ... no mustard because i didn't have any, but i followed the rest of the recipe as it says, using hormel chili with beans. it came out quite well. tastes like a chili dog but with toasted buns which is yummy. i would give it 4 stars for taste but it gets an extra star because it's SO easy and SO quick to make!

This is the easiest thing in the world. My kids love helping me make it. Takes about 10 mins to make and then you are done. The  kids love eating this for leftovers at the end of the week which is also a plus.

We were very disappointed with this recipe. I expected it to be great since there were so many good reviews and all the ingredients we like. The taste wasn't that great and all I can really say about it is that it seemed like it was "too much". One or two mouthfuls is all I could handle. Maybe it was just too rich. I would not discourage anyone from trying it though, we just didn't like it ourselves.

This is super easy and quick to prepare!  It tastes just like a chili dog, but without the mess!  Like other people, I added 2 cans of chili but will probably use 3 cans next time.  I used about a cup of chopped onions and omitted the mustard. I thought there was a bit too much bun for me, so I'll use a little less next time.  I can't wait to make this one again!

I used 10 hotdog buns and 10 hot dogs, I also used 3 cups of cheese instead of 2. My husband even took this for lunch the following day!

My husband and son loved this. The whole pan was gone by the end of the night. We thought the only change we might make next time is to add a little more chili. We used 1 can hormel chili w/ beans and it could have used 2. The bread did not turn out soggy at all, in fact it seemed to toast up a bit. Very fun and easy!

I was a little skeptical, but this was really good.  I didn't know what to expect with the buns since there were conflicting reports.  I think the type of chili used might make a difference.  I used two cans of Hormel chili with beans and the buns did not get soggy.  In fact they came out like they had been toasted.

My husband, daughter (3 yrs old) and I loved this.  I used five buns and five dogs instead of the eight so I wouldn't have tons of leftovers.  Kept the chili, onion, mustard, and cheese the same.  Also used all veggie chili once instead of regular, still turned out great.

I didn't have buns, so I used toasted bread.  I also used fat-free franks, fat-free cheese, and turkey chili to reduce the calories.  This was an easy meal and a good taste, but I think I prefer regular chili dogs.

This was very much a "kid friendly" meal.  It is what it says it is...in a big glop.  Taste...it tasted like a chili dog.

I did not like this. The buns were hard. This did not mix well.  My 6 year old daughter took 1 bite and said I do not want this. The meal ended up in the garbadge disposal. Next time I will make chili dogs the old fashioned way.

We all liked this very much!!!  Definately easy after a long day.  Next time I think I will try cornbread instead of buns and maybe a little more chili.  Very good though, thank you.

I took some of the other reviewers advice and added more chili.  I think I overdid it because it was VERY soupy.  If I were to make it again I would definitely only use maybe a little more than the recipe calls for.

My whole family loved this recipe. I used a suggestion from another review and used Fritos instead of hot dog buns. It was a big hit!!Easy and quick to make.
