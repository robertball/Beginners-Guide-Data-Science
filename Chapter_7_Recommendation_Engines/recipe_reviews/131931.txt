I think this would have been boring if I made it as described.  With a few slight modifications it became a complete delight.

I used some diluted chicken broth (didn't have beef) instead of water.  Your liquid will cook down so you don't need to use the stock at full strength.

I used a smaller roast (1.5 pounds).  Added a splash of shiraz, a dash of worcestershire sauce, and about 2 tbsp of molasses at the same time as the stock.  Also, I added the celery tops and thin bits (don't throw out the leaves - they are good seasoning in stews and roasts).  When adding the potatoes, I also added a splash of soy sauce and about 1 tsp of tarragon flakes, and another tbsp of molasses.  At the end of the line, about 5 minutes before removing from the heat, I added a good splash of shiraz and a very healthy grind of fresh black pepper.  Don't put the pepper in too early as the recipe instructs, as you will cook the flavor out of it.

I cooked this recipe with a lid half on, and had to add about 1 cup of water halfway through.

This review is for mainly the method. I'd never braised a roast on the stove top before so I was very happy when my boneless shoulder roast came out very tender. We don't like our veggies too mushy so I didn't cook them with the roast. I just followed the recipe for the spices. Smelled great while cooking and the roast was tender.

I used beef stock instead of just water to give it more flavor.  This is a really great classic roast beef dinner.  I did leave out the turnips though, noone in my house will eat them.  But with the carrots and potatoes it was still great.  This is defenitly a new favorite!

This was the most aromatic and delicious dish I have ever made!  I did change a lot around, though, and am so happy that I did.  I also added beef stock, molasses, worcestershire and extremely healthy "splashes" of red wine.  I used a great deal of sea salt and fresh cracked pepper to season the roast.  Then, I chose to use 3 tbsp of olive oil and put a really hard sear on the beef so that all those yummy juices were sealed in.  I added the onion to the oil and cooked for about 4-5 minutes, then the garlic for about 2 minutes, so some nice carmelization could add texture and depth of flavor.  I used about 3 parts beef stock to 1 part water until I covered the roast, and then added some Worcestershire and a good dose of red wine (I used a Zinfandel).  Once it came to a boil and I reduced heat to a simmer, I also added 2 bay leaves and the stems from the fresh parsley that I add later in the recipe.  When I added the potatoes, I doused the stew in wine again.  And again when I added the carrots.  Once I turned off the heat, I chopped up from some fresh Italian parsley and basil and added them, along with salt and pepper.  Fresh herbs retain their flavor best if added at the end of cooking.  Finally, I removed the roast and tore it into chunks, then I added it all back to the pot and cooked another 10 minutes just to really add to the tenderness of the beef.  It was just so wonderful!!  In fact, I found myself in there picking at the potatoes again and it's 7am!  :)

We loved this method of cooking pot roast! The roast was tender and juicy. We took some of the tips like using beef broth to cover the roast and omitted the turnips. It is replacing our bake in oven bag method we have used for years. Thank you for posting this recipe

I followed the suggestion to substitute beef broth, and the recipe was very good. My roast was almost 4 pounds, but for some reason it cooked in less than 2 hours. Use a meat thermometer to check if the roast has reached the desired temperature, so you don't overcook it.

It was a nice change of pace rather than roasting in the oven or the slow cooker. I added boullion to the water, as well as worcestshire sauce, red wine, and a small can of tomato paste. I didn't even have to thicken the sauce since it was thick enough after cooking down the meat. My 3.25 lb. roast took about 1.5 hours to cook with the lid partially on, then another 30 minutes for the carrots and potatoes (the store didn't have any turnips). We really enjoyed it, and are looking forward to open face sandwiches and gravy tomorrow!

This rating is based on the cooking method only.  I make pot roast one way but will change the cooking method from the crockpot to slow cooking it in the oven.  I kept forgetting to put the roast on to cook because I was sick and distracted.  Finally, I thought of the stove top method and found this recipe to help me out.  I browned the pot roast as directed.  Seasoned it with salt and pepper and browning sauce.  Put a can of beef broth in the pot and simmered away.  I kept checking it the way I would if it was in the oven but I really didn't need to.  I never had to add any additional water.  It was so tender and the gravy was wonderful.  This will be my method from now on.

I took some ideas from DannyBoy and boy was this tasty!  I bought a 3 lb. English cut roast (the pull apart roast) which is my favorite.  I seasoned it good with salt & pepper and a spice blend called "Greek Seasoning" that we get at Walmart of all places!  It has several other spices in it and we love it on roasts.  I seared it in some canola oil for about 3 minutes on each side until it was nice and browned.  Then I added 6 cups of beef broth (4 regular and 2 low sodium) and 2 cups water.  I also added about 3/4 Cup of Sutter Home Cabernet, several shakes of Worchester sauce and a couple of good pours of Tamari (concentrated Soy sauce).  Lastly, one packet of onion soup mix. Then one red onion chopped, two onions cut in half and then sliced, 3 stalks of celery (with leaves included), 8 peeled and quartered potatoes and 2 large bunches of fresh carrots, peeled and sliced in 3" sections with the fat end cut in half.  I added all the veggies right in with the broth because we like the flavor of the broth to penetrate the veggies.  This was so delicious!  And the best part is when we were done eating we just let the pot come to room temp and stuck the whole pot in the fridge!  The next day we brought it out, heated it up and had another delicious meal without any additional pots to clean!  After the 2nd meal we used the rest of the meat for BBQ beef sandwiches and the broth for French Onion Soup and it was wonderful!!!  Nice way to get several great meals from one dish!

Made this as directed and was disappointed with how bland everything was.  The meat just tasted like boiled meat - the seasonings didn't penetrate the meat like other recipes I've tried.  Also, I don't think the vegetables spend enough time with the beef in this method.  They were lacking that yummy "infused" taste.  I have a friend who makes the best pot roast and she does it on the stove top, so I had high hopes for this recipe.  This was definitely the least enjoyable pot roast I've ever made.

Never made pot roast before, and never heard of making it on the stove top. But it was great! Very nice flavor. Meat was tender, vegs were soft. 
I did add some beef stock.

Very easy, meat was so tender it could be cut with a butter knife and vegetables were soft, the timing was right.  I followed the recipe as written and used water, and I thought the flavor was not as "beefy" or rich as it could be, next time I will follow review suggestions and try beef broth.  My husband enjoyed his meat with a horseradish mustard.

I always have made mine on the stovetop i place my roast in a paper bag and shake it in flour salt pepper paprika and garlic powder befor searing. I also use beef stock and water. Instead of red onion I use small whole white onions and instead of turnips I use parsnips. Carrits of course. Also I use celery  with the leafy parts. And sometimes I also add mushrooms. A bay leaf is a must. And lately I have been using rosemary as well. Then after roast is tender I take out the meat and veggies, place aside and  make a slurry of flour, herbs and milk. Bring the liquid in the pot to a boil and slowly add the milk and flour mixture in, stirring constantly. Once it has reached desired constancy I replace the meat and veggies lower heat and cook for another half hour. Yummm

We followed the recipe except we added some McCormick beef base to the water. The roast did not fall apart and there was not much flavor to it, or the veggies. There would have been even less flavor if we had not added the beef base. We will not be using this recipe again. Disappointing. How did some of you rate this as the BEST pot roast you have ever made?????

I have been making this recipe for years,  the only difference is I add one packet of Onion Soup Mix after I brown the roast as I'm adding the water.  You have to have this to get that roast flavor that's is so good. If I don't have that you must add beef bouillon cubes. I did add a splash of red wine today like others suggested so I can't wait to taste it tonight! I serve mine with Hawaiian butter rolls to soak up all the good broth. Yummm.

This is the way my mom always cooked pot roast, and the way I have always done it. I dredge the roast in flour seasoned with Zendher's All Purpose Seasoning before browning, and add beef bouillon cubes with the water. I toss in tiny pearl onions, baby red creamer potatoes, and baby carrots, for a delicious dinner that requires almost no effort but tastes wonderful!

I added a can of beef broth, a can of diced tomatoes (with juice), sliced mushrooms and diced celery.  I also added freshly ground pepper and season salt.  It's been simmering for a a few hours on a gas stove top.  I've never made a pot roast without my Crock Pot.  I used onions, mushrooms, celery, canned diced tomaotes, carrots  and yukon gold potaotes (quartered).  I added ALL veggies after I seared the meat, so all the flavors would infuse.  Will give star rating later, after I've tasted it. ; )

I browned this in butter first.  I omitted the  turnips & celery.  I added some beef boullion to the water.  It was really good.  It came out more moist than when I make it in the crock pot...I was surprised.

I read this receipe and thought it would be good but I noticed there was no tomato paste or tomato sauce or beef bouillon. So I added 2 cans of tomato paste, 1 can of sauce and some beef boulillon, and some spices, and what do you know it was great so I say it was a 5 star after all the extra stuff I added to this.

Totally foolproof.  I added beef bullion cubes to the water instead of broth.  Chuck roast (usually tough) came out so tender!  Oh and it only took an hour an a half total for a 2 lb roast.

I imagined this would be a little bland so I added some gravy mix and soy sauce. It had the perfect flavor. The meat was tough though. It may have just been the cut itself. I think this was an easy recipe and will try again but get my meat from a different place.

I must have done something wrong because this recipe was a total disappointment.  It was too watery, flavorless, and boring.  I followed it exactly and should have added spices, as well as some type of thickener.  Sorry -- not a hit.

I followed the directions exactly when I made it and both the roast and the vegetables were absolutely delicious. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is because there is no way to keep the roast covered with water because it kept floating to the top. Also it says 3 hours - It actually took double the time to cook.

good base. But with many tweeks. My mom makes her pot roast this way but with tomato sauce. Since I am on an acid and gluten free diet, i was looking for new ideas. I found this recipe, and followed a lot of folks advice. I sear in canola oil, then added copped onions, S&P, bay leaves,  beef stock,  onion soup mix ,soy sauce worceshire and even some gravy master and celery leaves ( always have them on hand) . Once the roast has cooked on a low temp for a few hours, like my mom, I take the meat out, continue to cook down the liquid. after the meat is cool enough to handle, I slice it, add it back and then add the veges. I just use potatoes and carrots at this point. Let if cook for another hour. Melt in your mouth.

I was interested when this turned up in my email, but this is NOT a pot roast, it is a pot boil......to roast you have just enough liquid to stop it burning, just keep an eye in it and add a little at a time......

I made this dish! I read a few reviews and had seen some encountered the bland taste while cooking the roast on stove top. I boiled my roast in broth. I followed the recipe step by step! I only substituted the water with broth. Now I would add water half way though but, not a whole lot. Once the roast was tender, I took a bite and you  can taste the broth in the roast. Very delicious.

My roast was a little smaller, about two pounds but I still cooked for the stated amount of time. Our family is not fond of turnip so I omitted that and doubled up on the carrots. I rolled the roast in flour before searing.  Just before putting the potatoes in I used an emersion blender to blend the onions and celery. I did add a good splash of wine as well. The one negative that I have is that the carrots were still crunchy and they weren't that large.  Thanks for sharing.

Good to see a pot roast cooked stove-top...just like Mom's.  I rarely use salt but did use Kosher salt and fresh pepper as a rub prior to browning along with rosemary and thyme (which I add to everything).  This came out just perfectly.  The gravy was great but tweaked a bit after cooking with sherry.  My mother never used canned broth; water always seemed to do.  And so water only worked great.  Interesting additions in other comments and am likely to try those.  Why not?  Pot roast is a slow cooking process; patience always makes it a hit.

Made this to night. Followed the recipe very close. My roast was only 2#, no parsnips, added some leftover Merlot, and a couple Tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce as mentioned by another poster. Tasted great! I made a grave with the drained liquid by adding 2cups of the juices in to the pot with 2 tablespoons of melted butter. I thickened it up with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water. Brought it all to a boil stirring all the time until the gravy was thick as I like. Whole meal was great!

I've made a similar pot roast many times.  One of the main differences is the way I season the meat before braising/browning.  I always season ahead of browning with salt, pepper and garlic (I.E. Tony Chacherie's) not only on the outside but also cut small slits in the meat and insert cloves of garlic and more seasoning.  Rarely use broth but if the braising didn't leave enough in the pot will add boullion cube(s) to the gravy.  Almost forgot, after braising, before adding water, remove meat and saute onions (and bell pepper) a bit before adding water/broth/wine).  Brings out the flavor a bit.

My grandmother and mother always used this recipe for their pot roast, and I still do it this way.   Some people thought I was nuts (until they tasted it).  I never covered the roast with water, just put in 1-2 cups, covered it and cooked it on extremely low heat for several hours (3-4).  You do have to check occasionally to be sure it doesn't go dry, adding water as needed.  Toward the end I remove the roast and vegetables and thicken the sauce.  Excellent recipe!!!

This is how my mother always cooked the roast with the exception she dusted the roast with flour before searing.  Made for a really good gravey.

I usually make my roast in the crock pot. I tried this, install of using just plain  water, I added the dry onion soup mix to the water. I did flour and brown the roast before cooking. Added the onion soup mix, subbed the turnips for whole mushrooms. No one in my home will eat turnips. It was pretty good,but I prefer my crockpot method to this one. The roast, even though it fell part easily, was still tough. When I do them in my crock pot, the Roast just melts in your mouth. I think slow cooking it makes the roast tender. Thanks, anyway!!

I brown as stated but add 1 package dry onion soup & 1 can or bottle of beer. This makes a rich savory pot roast. continue with veggies as described. You may need to thicken the juices with a cornstarch slurry at the end if you prefer a thicker gravy.

It was very delicious! Also, I loved that it was done within only 3 hours instead of much longer. I ran out of time to do my usual pot roast so I googled something that could be ready sooner. This recipe was a really nice surprise! I followed the basics of this recipe, but improvised small details like portions. For the broth, I used the premade ready to go chicken broth and diluted some water in it and powdered chicken broth. I used different spices and veggies also. I loved how the meat falls apart when forking the roast, mmmm. And yes, DO cover the pot.

This was a pretty standard recipe. It's not hearty, as far as pot roasts go. As another reviewer stated, the flavors did not meld together. The taste was standard, rather bland. I think I'll skip this one next time, but it was a meal that my family ate without complaint.

Great recipe to use as a guide/base. Perfect if you have never made a stove top pot roast before. As you see in the xomments there are many additiins you can make. I use demi glace, dried shitake mushroom powder from Fogwood Foods, fresh thyme, fresh basil, egyptian dried basil, vidalia onions and I roast my yukon potatoes first then add at the end. Also, i use local butter and purple moon merlot in the beginning. Killer dish no matter how you do it!

i cooked as the recipe stated. my roast was big so it took about 4 hours. i tasted the broth of this and ended up tweaking it before i served it. if i make this again ill use beef broth instead of water, up the garlic and use a bigger onion. it wasn't bad it just wasn't good.

I made this tonight and it came out delicious! I seared the 8.9lb bottom round in a pot withbutter and vegetable oil, as Julia Childs said everything is better with butter.Then I took it out and cooked 6 onions and 2 cloves of garlic once they were carmelized put roast back in pan filled. up with water to cover roast.I didnt have beef broth. I added 2 packets of lipton onion mix and McCormick's brown gravy mix, port wine halfway . I also seasoned with fresh nutmeg salt and pepper and worcestershire sauce and some ketchup yes I said ketchup. After 3hours added celey carrots and potatoes then 1hour later bage of frozen peas. I did thicken sauce with butter and flour balls.and dont forget another splash of port wine!

It definitely needs salt and could use some other seasonings not we really liked it other than that. It was easy enough so it was definitely worth making notes on adding a few more herbs and seasoning.

I wanted to use my slow cooker, but I got pressed for time so I needed to so it in the stovetop.  This recipe was pretty easy to follow, but I switched it up a bit.  After browning the roast, I removed it and sautéed my onions (I only had yellow) and some minced garlic (I use the jar stuff).  I added the roast back and used fat-free beef broth instead of water.  I added the potatoes after about and hour and a half, then the baby carrots about 1/2 hour after that. I let that go for another 1/2 hour before removing the roast and the veggies.  I thickened the sauce with a mixture of flour and cold water for a gravy and I stirred some horseradish into some sour cream for a sauce on the side.  I’m not generally much of a cook, so I’m pretty proud of this meal.

I honestly went through the reviews and did follow the recipe.  When I tasted the broth exactly how it was followed on the recipe I decided to add bay leaf, oregano and thyme along with chicken broth knorr. The moment I added those key ingredients to my roast I was in roast heaven. I haven't finished making the roast but by the flavors of adding key ingredients made it so yummy not to mention I added a small amount of liquid smoke and no flour.

Excellent and easy using a le creauset 7 qt Dutch oven, I
Used beef regular beef broth, 10 mini potatoes, 5 of each red and gold, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 1 packet McCormicks slow cooker savory pot roast seasoning, added 1 inch cut of celery, and fresh spices rosemary, oregano and time. Don’t forget to season the meat before the flour. Absolutely wonderful.

Fabulous recipe. i did use beef broth instead of water,  and added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Cooked for 2 hours, then added the potatoes , and carrots. Was so tender,  didn't even need a knife! Definitely a go to recipe.

I followed the directions and it wasn’t bad. The meat was tender but I found the gravy to be lacking in flavour. I’ll make it again because my husband liked it.

I  definitely enjoyed this, but I couldn't get a decent chuck roast. So instead I substituted a bottom round  roast and it was very good. The only thing I would  change next time, would be to leave out the turnips.

Useful note - handle chopping the turnips, potatoes, and carrots while the roast is cooking on that initial stretch.

I made the recipe as written, except I did add beef broth per other reviewers. The meat wasn't nearly as tender as expected, and I cooked it low for as long as the recipe said. There just wasn't much flavor. The potatoes were very bland, as well.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

Very tasty, easy to prepare. I used H.E.B. beef broth in lieu of water, no turnips. Other than this, recipe as is. Almost dislike saying it, but this stovetop recipe will replace my long-time slow-cooker recipe; my two preparations have been that good.

I make my  pot  roast slightly different, my family doesn't like turnips so I just use the carrots and potatoes. I add oregano and thyme(crushed leaves) and 1cup of warmed strong brewed coffee with a Knorr Beef cube dissolved in  the coffee. Old Navy cook's trick! Makes awesome gravy!!!

I would not add so much water.  Also, the turnips did not go well with the roast.  If I make again, I will skip the turnips and use a tomato based sauce instead of water

It was really delicious and very tender. I only had to add water once. The house smelled so good and I couldn't wait to eat it. I made gravy and had it over noodles.  Had left overs the next day with mashed potatoes.

Not sure how this happened but my nearly 3-lb roast was totally done in less than an hour despite me watching vigilantly to keep it at a simmer and now a boil.  I had to pull out the meat and let the veggies cook longer!  Also, while the roast was tasty it wasn't fork-tender and we ate it sliced instead of pulled apart.  Like many other reviewers, I used beef stock, a small can of tomato paste, and generous dashes of Worcestershire sauce and red wine vinegar.  I'll try this again sometime and really try to keep the temp low so it has a chance to tenderize and be permeated by the seasonings.

I am very pleased that I tried this dish.  In the past, I have tried to make pot roast on the stove top and it turned out an expensive tough, tasteless disappointment and a waste of time and effort.  This recipe along with the cooking instructions changed that outcome for me.  Thoroughly enjoyed making this dish and eating it.  However, I did make some adjustments because I wanted to use what ingredients and vegetables I have available.  Instead of turnips, I used the parsnips I had available and instead of red potatoes, I had golden yellow which I used instead of the red.  This turned out very good, especially since I don't know how the taste would change.  I know that parsnips are a sweet tasting root vegetable, while turnips a root vegetable too, are not as sweet and are mildly peppery, to me.  I believe red potatoes are suppose to be less starchy than the golden yellow.  The golden yellow potatoes did not cook apart following the recipe as it stands.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a basic, no fault, recipe. Plenty of room for variation. I often use a couple of bottles of Guinness Stout in place of water. Of course, the Stout must be taste tested before going into the pot. Red wine, another variation. Beef stock is good also. I add mushrooms with the carrots towards the end. More garlic and extra onions.

I cook pot roast similar to Trash.  But use chuck roast for meat.  Last time I tried a good veggie broth instead of beef broth., we really like that.  But all in all was good receipt, which we all like to change them for our family's taste.  Connie

This is basically my preferred method, except that I add a can of beef stock, an envelope of beef-onion soup mix, four cans of water, and whatever other root vegetables look good.  A stovetop Dutch oven does a nice job.

Yumm. This is just the way grandma used to make it.  I would add the carrots sooner than the recipe called for and if the result was not "beefy" tasting enough, I would add some "Better than Boullion" beef base.  One other thing is I like a little color on the veggies so I sear them in the oil with the meat and set them aside to add later back into the pot.
I make variations of this recipe four ways:  on the stove, in the oven, in the pressure cooker, and in the electric fry pan.

Don't think it needed all that water. I used maybe 2 cups. Carrots take longer to cook than potatoes and carrots. I put them in all at the same time  and cooked till carrots were tender. (about 30 minutes) Roast was very tender. I cook it this way all the time.

I've made pot roast on the stove top for many years.  I've never cooked the vegs. in with the roast.  I always serve mashed potatoes and various vegs.   If I don't have broth handy, I use
beef cubes for flavor.  I gave 4 stars because I always feel something is missing.

Sounds good-   I would substitute either a good Olive Oil or Grapeseed for the very tasty but seriously unhealthy Crisco-  I have made this basically- its very tasty- also substituted parsnips for turnips- they are sweeter
