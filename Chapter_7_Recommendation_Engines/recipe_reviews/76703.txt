This was good, and I love cinnamon and red hots; but I guess I am just used to regular flavored peanut brittle and prefer that.

Made this this evening. I did cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half, just in case. I really like it. It's a little different but makes an awesome addition to a candy tray. Thanks for the recipe.

I tried and was great the first time, the second time I followed the same receipe and the brittle hardened but the outside was sticky like sugar

It is a good variation of peanut brittle and came out beautifully. Not sure it really reminded me of red hots, but could definitely feel a little heat in there. It is good & I will make it again, though not as often as the original!

This never hardened and was more of a taffy consistency.  The length of time that it spends in the microwave is dependent on the wattage of the microwave.  Since you don't state what your wattage is, I don't know if mine is higher or lower than the one used in the recipe.

 

Let me add that I really did like the taste.

This does remind you somewhat of red hots.  This was a nice twist on peanut brittle to try for a change.

This wasn't a hit at our house. We both prefer regular peanut brittle. Thanks anyway.
