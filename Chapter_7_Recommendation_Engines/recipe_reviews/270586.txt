I made this for dinner last night. Amazing!  I changed It up a little. I used about four cups of chicken broth instead of the 10 oz the recipe suggested.  I added about 1/4 teaspoon of taco seasoning. We put shedded Mexican cheese and avocado over ours. Cannot wait to have it again.

Rich and creamy. I don’t have an insta pot cooked on stovetop. Came out perfect. I used chicken breast instead of thighs. Green onions and himalayan salt. Will make again!!

I followed the recipe exactly. I'm not a fan of really spicy foods and debated about using only half of the poblano but it was great. I removed the seeds and chopped it into pieces. I loved the soup but would give it 4.5 stars. It wasn't creamy enough for me. I reheated the leftover the next night in the IP on the Steam setting for 5 minutes which was longer than necessary, maybe 3 minutes. Before reheating, I mixed in about 1/2 cup of cooked rice and the soup was perfect!

I used chicken breast instead of thighs. I didn’t have  the pepper so I used a can of green chilies. I will make again.
