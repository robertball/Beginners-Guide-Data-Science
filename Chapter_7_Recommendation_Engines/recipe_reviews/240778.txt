I made this with a 1.5 lb tri tip and had plenty of rub left over.  I seared in a Dutch oven and transferred straight to oven. Tented as directed. Also through in some mushrooms and butter around roast. Cooked for 60 mins and it came out perfect. Medium well I would say. My kids are very picky and they loved it. Even got a complement from my husband and said it was very good. (I never cook steak because I ALWAYS over cook it). I never take the time to write reviews but felt that this recipe was well worth it.

Cooking for 60 minutes yielded a medium roast - 90 minutes would have been way too long.  We thought it was quite salty an too spicy for us.

This tritip recipe is a great substitute if you don't feel like bbqing outside. I added a tblsp. of olive oil, tsp. of worcestershire sauce and a tsp. of  liquid smoke to ingredients then rubbed on tritip and let it rest over nite in frig. It came out so juicey! I would recommend less baking time if you prefer your beef rare.

I made three different tri tips with three different marinades/rubs for my grandson's birthday and this was the clear winner. I grilled the tri tip on the bbq using indirect heat. Served with pinquito beans for that Santa Maria tri tip goodness.

Wow!  I served this tonight and everybody loved this tri-tip.  My friend, who's an excellent cook, identified it as Santa Maria and wanted the recipe.  I rubbed the roast with olive oil then rubbed in the spices, put it in a zip lock and refrigerated for about 36 hours, turning it a couple times.  I cooked a 3# roast  in a foil covered cast iron skillet 70 minutes, and it was well done, but tender.  Next time I'll try less time.  I had about 1/4 of the rub left and will use it on steak, it's excellent.

Great recipe, but take it out when medium-rare.  This is tending into the medium-well range.

This was the first time I made a tri tip and turned out great.  The only thing I would do next time is  after  putting the spices on,  I would let them obsorb into the meat about an hour before searing it.  I definitely will make it again.

I've made this a few times now and I LOVE it. I made it the oven when I decided to make it last minute, but I preferred it in the crock pot cooked on low for 8-10 hours.

My husband is tough to please when it comes to meat roasted in an oven... he prefers the grill.  But, he loved this recipe.  It was very easy to prepare and had great flavor... I will definitely make this one again.

Made this today for the first time. Love it! I also seasoned some chicken breast, seared it and finished it in the oven also. Will use this recipe again for sure.

Made this recipe exactly as directed and it came out delicious!! It was a little spicy for my family’s taste so next time we’ll put a little less cayenne but other than that we loved it.

I didn't have the beef bullion nor the cayenne pepper, so I used a meat season found in my moms kitchen. I had never  made a tri tip before,  so followed rest of directions and it came out great.  searing before baking really does make a difference.

Excellent! The meat is tender and flavorful.  I used garlic-pepper seasoning. Johnnies season salt and minced dried onions- otherwise followed the recipe!

This turned out to be one of the best Tri-tip roast I have ever made. I followed the recipe just as it was written and fell in love with the seasoning on the roast. My 7 year old grand son said "this is to die for". That is enough affirmation for me.
