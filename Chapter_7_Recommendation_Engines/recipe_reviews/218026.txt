Just served this to the family tonight...everyone loved it.  They said it was a variation on Shepherd's Pie.  I made mine with meatloaf mix instead of just beef...I will add ground lamb next time too.

I will put the dish under the broiler for a couple of minutes to crisp the bacon more...the bacon was cooked but not crisp (still very good though)

This needed more seasonings.  My husband said it was very bland but when I heated the leftovers and added some Italian Seasoning and other herbs, he ate three helpings.  Also an 8X8 would not hold everything.  I cut everything but ground beef and onion in half and the 8X8 was full.

Thank you for sharing your recipe Kitten.  We enjoyed it and will make again - it is a keeper!  I made just a few minor changes/additions.  I browned a pound of ground chuck and about two sausage patties in my cast iron dutch oven.  There was about 2 tablespoons of grease so I drained that off.  Then I layered everything as instructed.  In addition to the salt and pepper I sprinkled garlic salt and cayenne pepper between the layers.  I cut the bacon into bite-sized pieces and laid it on the top. I put the lid on the dutch oven and baked for 40 minutes, removed the lid and baked 20 more and then broiled the top for about 5.  What an economical and easy recipe - easy to prepare, bake and clean-up!

Then added tomato soup, worcestershire, a-1, can fiesta nacho soup, bacon bits, corn, beans, potatoes and a little salt to taste, mixed all together and poured into dish. Put grated cheese on top before putting in oven.

I made this tonight and it does remind me a lot of shepherds pie.  Because onions are an absolute no no in this house, (I love them, the hubby hates them), I have to substitute with onion powder.  I added garlic powder, onion powder seasoning salt, black pepper and some parsley flakes to the dish.  Also, I didn't layer it, I just mixed everything together in our big cast iron fry pan and stuck it in the oven for 40 minutes with the foil on it.  I removed the foil and stuck it back in for an additional 40 minutes.  It smelled so delicious cooking, a definite keeper.  I just love this site for recipes!!!!  Thank you, Kitten!

Even with my modifications this was bland, bland and bland.  I added garlic powder and green pepper to the ground beef mixture.  I figured this was just going to be dry so I added a can of reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup.  This really makes a ton so we have quite a lot left over.  I'm going to freeze it and make "garbage soup" from this site for another meal.

I wish I liked this but it was very bland.  My partner is finicky and had everything he liked so decided to make this for dinner.  I made this again but this time used can of cream or celery soup, doubled the hamburger amount and added a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I layered it like instructed using half the hamburger as the base and the rest of the hamburger after the corn layer.  Like suggested, I turned on the broiler to crisp the bacon.  This helped it out a lot.  A lot of work for a fair dish to serve.  Sorry!

Very tasty.  I like that it is relatively easy (took a while to chop onions and grate potatoes, so next time I'll use frozen hash browns and buy onions already chopped), but if you don't add a bunch of sauces and cheese, etc., it's fairly healthy.  Kind of like a soup in casserole form.  I might try adding some garlic and maybe some tomatoes or tomato paste next time.  But overall, I liked it.

I also had trouble fitting this recipe into an 8x8 pan -- had to cut back to fit it in my pan -- needs a very deep 8x8 or a larger pan for this recipe.  Also had trouble getting the bacon done and wound up frying it and putting it back on the casserole.  You could skip the bacon if you didn't want to mess with it or wanted to avoid the fat and it would still be tasty.  Didn't find it bland at all -- maybe the bland reviews didn't use enough salt?

I think this is really great for our farm family since we already have all the ingredients besides bacon. With that said it takes a lot of changes. Firstly I would brown the potatoes first, and chop the bacon before putting it on top. I also would remove the foil earlier since we like our bacon crispy. I also omitted the carrots since my hubby doesn't like them.

My family was very pleased! It was very flavorful and filling. I swapped the green beans for poblano peppers, and that added some extra flavor.  It was a hit!
