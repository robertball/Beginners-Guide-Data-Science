This was absolutely delicious!  I’m not always a halibut fan, so this was wonderful.  We made couple of minor changes - instead of water to the veggies, we used a little sherry and some canned milk.  We also added diced onion.

The presentation of this dish is beautiful and the taste is restaurant quality.  I did not care for the tarragon so I will omit it the next time. There is no mention of the spicy greens in the ingredient list but it is mentioned in the video.  That adds plenty of flavor and a little kick. I will only cook that fish three minutes on each side the next time.  Highly recommend!

This was such a fresh, tasty way to fix the halibut we caught in Alaska. I used what I had on hand, so only the generic white mushrooms. They worked fine. My corn was frozen sweet corn so I didn't add any water to the salsa. It turned out just fine. And finally, I didn't go outside into the rain to grill the fish; I stayed warm and dry inside, using my Jenn-Air electric grill. The grill marks were not as dark, but hey, what the heck? It still looked good and tasted awesome. My husband was very pleased with what I did to HIS fish!

I made this as directed and it was so delicious.  The fresh tarragon was a delightful treat.  This will be on my make-it-again list.

It was a gourmet Saturday night meal for us. I used fresh corn cut off the cob. I also reduced the amount of lemon - had a small one, still only used about 1 T and it had enough lemon flavor. We didn't have chanterelles so I bought and used Shiitake and it was fine. Also I think there was too much oil for the amount of mushrooms - poured some off after cooking them. I would substitute white wine or sherry for the water next time. All that said, it was flavorful, colorful and made a very nice healthy meal.

I make this all the time on my own without the recipe. Ii always use onions as well. I don’t care for the lemon juice flavor. The tarragon did add a little extra layer of flavor, but I had to use dried as there wasn’t any available. Used our Alaskan Halibut we caught and grilled it. It was very good, I cooked an extra 5 minutes as the filets I had were very thick!  Perfect other than the rain storm that hit right then and kept the grill a little cool for the best seat.

I used crimini mushrooms and they were fine.  
If I had to do it again, I would add a little bit of garlic in the vegetables.
