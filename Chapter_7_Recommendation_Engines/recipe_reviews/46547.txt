If it's too bland, throw some dry mustard in with the flour at the beginning and sprinkle some paprika on top after baking.

My kids ate this, so it automatically gets a higer mark from me.

I too must agree that the sauce alone was a bit bland. Don't know what the first reviewer meant about the dish not needing the milk and flour. That's how you start any cheese sauce. Anyway, I added garlic and onion powders and black pepper and it was still rather uninteresting so I thought about what it is that makes fondue so tasty. In my opinion it's the wine. With that addition it turned out nicely. Thanks Brenda for a good start!

I followed some of the advice of the other reviewers and used a little white wine. 1 1/2 c. milk and 1/2 c. white wine. I didn't add extra salt as I didn't want it too salty. I'll update how it was after we try it with dinner. EDITED: My family inhaled it, even my cauliflower-hating husband. It's a little bland, I might add some dry mustard next time.

Bland on it's own, but I added a bit of pepper, cayenne, mustard, and nutmeg and that turned it into a winner. It is saucy though and I might cut the sauce down by half next time. A nice warm comfort food for winter.

I made this to take to a cookout and it was great without any changes.  I'm also adding this recipe to my holiday dinner this year as well.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good, made a LOT of sauce, but I didn't mind - I served this with fresh snow peas and the sauce was great on the peas. I might even add snow peas to this recipe next time. I did add a bit of mustard to the sauce - adds a nice flavor.

I found this to be very bland and I even added diced onions, Worcestershire sauce and mustard! It didn't seem to need the flour and milk as this took away from the cheesiness.  Sorry, this one is just not a keeper.

Not as good as I was hoping for. Easy & really creamy, but very salty & bland. The leftovers need lots of hot sauce. I'm a sucker for easy recipes so I'll probably make again with grated onion and garlic.

Very good.  Probably made twice as much sauce as was actually needed.  I read the idea about dry mustard & paprika after the fact - I'm sure that would've really made it pop!

Very good!  It was a lot of sauce, but I like it like that.  It was a little bland, and that's after I added mustard to the sauce and sprinkled the top with cheese.  I'll have to try the wine next time.  I will definitely make this again!

An easy recipe to jazz up cauliflower.  I used half swiss and half cheddar (I didn't have enough swiss on hand).  There was LOTS of sauce, so this should satisfy all the cheese lovers out there.

We made this recipe for our Oktoberfest and it was a hit.  The students made the dish and everyone loved it.  Teachers were asking for the recipe the following day.  We topped it with bread crumbs to add texture and dotted it with a bit more butter.  It makes a lovely casserole.  Just cooked it myself at home.

This was good. I added some breadcumbs & additional cheese on top of the dish. It was slightly bland but it complimented the spicy lamb cutlets I made very well.

This has been a great recipe for our family because my father is on a low-salt diet for health reasons. We omit the salt in the recipe, and everyone (besides him) uses table salt to his/her own taste at the table. Swiss cheese is Dad's favorite low sodium cheese option for meals, and this allows a nice casserole/side alternative for a hot meal for him... instead of the go-to plain steamed veggie rut that low-sodium eaters often find themselves in. When making for other groups (who don't have the sodium concerns), I have made the recipe as stated... and have made it with other cheeses or combined cheeses.

My mother used to make this recipe almost exactly - except she used Colby cheese instead of Swiss cheese. Both versions are awesome!

Bland without herbs and the right amount of cheese!  6 ounces of good quality Swiss cheese and the addition of cooking of fresh cauliflower with salt - at least 2 tsps.  Slow Cook minced onion and then add garlic in olive oil or butter to caramelize. Don't brown! Then add fresh nutmeg, fresh ground pepper.  But if you want to add a couple of TBS to the onion/garlic... that may add more!

thought this looked too bland as well so sauteed some finely chopped onion in the butter and added very small pinch of red pepper, black pepper, parsley and mustard.  Also grabbed the beer out of hubby's hand and threw in a splash of that!  (didn't have any white wine for myself tonight, too bad!) Threw some crunchy noodles on top and broiled after baking as directed.  Great flavor but only gave 3 stars as I had to add so much.  Used cheddar and a touch of Romano that I had on hand.  Beer added a nice, subtle flavor (just use a dash) This would have been too mild for me otherwise.

The cream sauce is alot like the Cream Soup Base recipe on this site...  So, I excluded the salt in this recipe and substituted 2 cubes of chicken boullion and because my family likes pepper, I always add 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper as well.  For me, the trick to less "sauciness" is to let the cream base thicken over low heat.  Once it's thickened, I add the cauliflower and cheese and mix all ingredients with my hand mixer.  I thought the cheese and cauliflower are welcome companions!  Yummy!

I love cauliflower and when it is hot and covered with cheese - even better! I used 2 heads of cauliflower. For the sauce, I used about 2 tbsp. of olive oil inplace of the butter. I added chicken soup mix, onion powder and garlic powder to the sauce. Too bad I did not read the other reviews - but next time i will probably add mustard or mustard powder to give it a bit of a kick. I added shredded mozzerela cheese the last 2 minutes of baking time, so that the cheese would not burn.

I should have read the reviews. This made WAY too much sauce, and it was so bland and floury-tasting. I would have had to add a ton more cheese to make it how I'd like, and I just didn't think it would be worth it. Not recommended. Sorry.

This was good could have used something. I seasoned this with some ground mustard and some chicken boulion and served it with chicken courdon blue. Everyone said it was great. I only used about 3 0z of swiss cause that was all I had but it was still cheesy. I think I will make this again. Oh and my two year old year old had some and said Yum which is a good sign.

I don't normally enjoy cauliflower, but this was tasty. I seasoned the sauce with salt, pepper, garlic powder and ground mustard. I used a 6 oz bag of shredded swiss cheese, but next time I won't add the extra cheese cause that made the sauce almost too rich.

I loved this dish. I am not a huge swiss cheese fan so I was a bit worried but it came out fantastic. It was the perfect amount of sauce for the cauliflower. Everyone thought it was great.
