Very good combo of flavors! I like the spiciness, but I would recommend being careful with how much hot sauce you add, cuz it can get pretty hot pretty fast. I liked how tender the sweet potatoes got with boiling them, but roasting them would work too. Served it atop quinoa for a delicious meal.

Easy and full of flavor.  I used non-stick spray instead of the oil.  I served it over whole wheat pasta.  This dish is super duper healthy yet it doesn't taste boring!

This has become a favourite in our house, 3 times in 4 weeks. I used 1/2 tsp Tabasco for the hot sauce and added a little more Honey.  Turned out great.  We have had this with pasta and brown rice, both work well.

I'm the chef at a residential center responsible for feeding 40 people lunch and dinner, five days a week.  When I found this recipe, I thought it sounded really good.  So I made it for dinner tonight.    Let me say that there are now 41 people who agree that this is just plain *delicious*!!  A little sweetness, a little heat.  Most excellent!!    In fact, a dozen of our clients have asked for copies of the recipe.    Thank you, ArianeK!!

Delicious! This recipe was very flavorful and relatively easy to make. The only changes I made (completely based on personal preference, not because it needed something) were to add walnuts to the finished dish and also to pour some honey over the top of it when it's done -- that way you can really taste the sweet and spicy together!

This was pretty darn good.  I would have added more mango. Either use one very, very large mango or two medium-sized mangos. The mangos really add a nice flavor.  In addition, I think it'd be better to ROAST the sweet potatoes. I think boiling them zapped them of their wonderful flavor (not to mention NUTRIENTS) and made them a bit soggy.  I only gave it four stars because it wasn't something that was SO delicious that I just HAD to have a second helping! But it was extremely healthy and tasty, and it made for an easy weeknight meal.

This recipe was awesome! My husband and I LOVED it! Loved everything about it! The sweet with the spicy...it was just as good, if not better the next day for lunch! The only thing I did differently was roast the sweet potatoes (40mins/400*) in the oven. I think it actually helped the texture as the potatoes were a little crispy around the edges and held together after the sauce was added.

this was good but a very different flavor. I sauted up a green pepper and a sweet onion and added it which I though really added to the taste and texture. I used jar mango (not in season) and extra garlic but kept everything else the same.

This was a surprise...I couldn't imagine how this was going to work out, but I had everything on hand so I tried it - it has a great taste with some kick.  I would say it's almost like an American curry substitute.   I'm eating the dish by itself (and I didn't add chicken), because, like a previous reviewer, I can't see how I can add in more starch.  I'll keep checking back to see if I can find something else to put under it.  I think I'll try some asian noodles next time...

I would definately make again...loved the sweetness of the mango. I don't like foods too spicy so I left out some of the hot sauce.  I would have liked a bit more depth of flavor in the sauce... may play with ginger or curry next time.

I was worried that this may be a bit bland or too sweet and it turned out beautifully. Our hot sauce of choice was sriacha rooster sauce and I only used one tbls instead of three and it had a very nice warmth to it. I also baked the chicken instead of fry. Poured it over some soba noodles and it was great.

This is a great recipe.  I used  less hot sauce (I opted for sriracha), and added a little over half of a habanero pepper, which gave it a great kick that paired extremely well with the mango.  I recommend adding the pepper in parts and tasting as you go, as this pepper is SPICY!  I also felt like I needed some green in here, so I finished with some cilantro (I love this with spicy and citrus dishes) which gave the dish freshness and contrast.

This dish is fairly simple to prepare, though there's not much more flavor than the basic main ingredients: the chicken, potatoes, and mango. I'd suggest using more corn starch to thicken the sauce more.

Delicious!! Peeled, cubed, and oven roasted sweet potatoes ahead earlier in the day at 400Degree 35 min and they kept their shape nice. Refrigerated potatoes and then at dinner time the recipe was quite quick to put together. Didn't need rice or noodles.  1 Tablespoon of Corn Starch worked better.  Easy recipe to adjust to your likeness of sweet, hot, salty, or substitutions.  Thanks for sharing a real winner.

Great meal, Next time I will serve it on chow mein noodles. I increased the garlic, red pepper flakes and hot sauce. Next time I might add some pineapple too.

Very good, but probably better to cook the chicken in the sauce a bit longer rather than cook it plain. And probably worth putting over a starch only to absorb some juices.

This was delicious - I made it exactly as written, except I doubled the garlic and used mango honey from the Farmer's Market. It was the perfect heat and the flavours went so well together. My only complaint is that this is not 5 servings - there were 5 of us and pretty scant portions each. Regardless, this is being added to my dinner rotation - it got rave reviews from everyone who ate it! Served with white rice and a spinach salad on the side.

Very good, but a little too sweet.  I will make this again with the following changes: 1.  elk instead of chicken.  I think the flavor will stand up better to all the other flavors. 2. less honey.  sorry, just too sweet. 3. add fish sauce...maybe 1/2t. 4.  rice, not pasta.  pasta is wierd with this-it will be better with rice. One thing is that we usually eat medium salsa and like hot stuff...don't be scared of 3 T of hot sauce-I used 2 T of sambal oelek and should have used all 3T.    Other than that, healthy and yummy!

This was fantastic.  I did not boil sweet potatoes, I baked w/olive oil and salt instead as suggested.  This was restaurant quality.  Served over Jasmine rice.  Husband said "This is a keeper!"  Thanks for sharing!!

This was really good. I'm giving this a 4 because I think it does needs something with a little extra crunch and color (might try the asparagus as someone suggested) because the sweet potatoes and mango are so soft.  I'll probably try roasting the sweet potatoes too.  I toned down the spice a lot for my little guys, less than 1 Tbsp in the sauce and no pepper flakes, and then my husband and I added the spice at the table which worked well.  I used cayenne pepper sauce (Franks) because I figured sriracha would be too hot but I do think the sriracha would be perfect.  I used regular soy since that's what I had on hand, and I served it with couscous.  It was a big hit!

Very tasty and unique! I skipped the hot sauce since we don't keep any on hand, but I did add a few dashes of ginger for increased flavor. Served with the Garlic Lime Asparagus from this site. Will definitely make it again!

I thought this was incredible.  I cut down the spices a bit (2 tbls. of sriracha and some dashes of red pepper), and it was plenty spicy.  I thought it was quite beautiful too, not gray at all!  I'd serve this for guests anytime.

This was excellent! I never just make a recipe as is because I love to experiment, so I added some chopped fresh spinach, quartered grape tomatoes from my garden and a handful of chopped walnuts a minute or two before serving. And I made this with turkey breast, rather than chicken. Also, though I like spicy food, 3 T. of hot sauce + red pepper flakes seemed a bit much, so I used a bit under 1 T. hot sauce... delicious! Oh yes, I served it on red quinoa cooked in a little chicken broth.

This meal was delicious.  I substituted pineapple for mango & served it over wholewheat pasta.  You can make it as spicy as you like by adjusting the hot sauce.

Tastes good.  Pretty spicy.  I wouldn't serve it to company because it's unattractive.  It comes out looking kind of gray.

I had some mango to use up, so I decided to give this a try even though it seemed like a bit of a weird combination. I roasted the potatoes because I find boiling them kills their flavour. I also cut the hot sauce in half, otherwise I know I would have burned my mouth off. Finally, I only used about 8 ounces of chicken instead of the full pound and it was still plenty. It turned out pretty good and not weird at all. I'd make this again for sure.

I made it per recipe. I liked it fine. My friends, weren't all that thrilled w/it. I think because of the sweetness of it. Would I serve it again to friends, no; for me, again I liked it.

Made this as written, except used frozen mango cubes.  I may have also used a bit more tobasco...didn't exactly measure.  However, the end product was wonderful!  Served with brown rice and with a frozen "stir fry" vegetable medly along side.  I will make this many times, especially since I know the frozen mango works well.  It is so easy to have that in the freezer, instead on depending on availability of fresh mangos.

LOVED IT! We served it over rice. My kids were not crazy about it, but they don’t like oriental food.  We did us 1 cup of pineapple instead of the mango, because my husband does not like mango.   I will be making this often.  Next time I think I might add some green pepper and onion to it.

So yummy! A great recipe to play with too. The sweet potatoes are mild, so next time we're trying yams. I'm having fantasies of purple and orange yams, plantains and bell peppers. We put carrots in to round out the food groups, and I sliced a fresh tomato into it at the end. Wonderful. We used 1 1/2 tbsp of Sriracha hot sauce, and it was warm without burning. Definitely needed three x's the cornstarch, but that is up to how thick you want your sauce. I'd suggest adding the mango last just to heat it so it doesn't get mushy. Very tasty, we'll definitely be making it again :)

We really enjoyed this dish.  It was quick - one of those dishes where something else is simmering or cooling while you're prepping the next step.  The sauce reminds me of Chinese sweet and sour sauce.  I used 2 tbsps of hot sauce, no red pepper flakes, and deboned chicken thighs.  I also had to add 3 tsp of corn starch (w/ the accompanying 3 tbsp water) in order to get the sauce to reach a thicker consistency.  I didn't drain the chicken after transferring it to another dish.  If you like sweet and sour chicken, give this a try.  The mango provides a complimentary taste.  I might try yams next time.

This was an excellent recipe. Next time I will add some red pepper and scale back on the sweet potato. I served over rice and I liked it to soak up some of the sauce, but I didn't need all that starch.

Such a fun combination of fresh, sweet and spicy! I added some ginger to the mix. Instead of rice or pasta, I served it with some freshly baked biscuits.  My husband loved it, so I will definitely be making this again!

Wow! This was even better than I thought it would be!! I served it over brown rice and it was a hit with both my boyfriend and I. The only changes I made were I seasoned the sweet potato (I also added some red pepper, onion and cherry tomatoes) with cinnamon, cumin and ginger and then roasted it for 40 min and 400 degrees. I also didn't add any of the hot things as a matter of taste. I can't do spicy :s

I would give this 4-1/2 stars. . . It was a perfect blend of sweet & spice!  I goofed & already had diced fresh mango mixed with diced fresh tomatoes, so my version included tomatoes.  I also added a tad of onion cooked with the garlic.  I doubled the amount of garlic (we love it), and only used a few splashes hot sauce.  I did use a generation pinch of red pepper flakes.  I also added in a pinch of ground ginger & cumin.  It was very runny, but I didn't serve it over rice (didn't think I would need 2 carbs. . . potatoes & rice). . .I thought wrong. . . definitely serve over rice.  I may cut down the liquid slightly the next time I make it, but I will be making this again!  Thanks for submitting!

I used a package of firm tofu instead of chicken and used 1 cup of sweet potatoes instead of tow, and it was the perfect vegetarian dish! I served it over rice noodles and it was like I was in Thailand.  Other reviews are right though, be careful on the hot sauce...  it is really hot as directed.

my husband and i loved this dish!  It is super spicy, but the mango and sweet potato really bring the heat down.  Very flavorful!!  Try this if you are looking for something a little different that isn't difficult to make.

Yummy!  I used the tamari soy sauce, and it made it a bit too salty, but that is hard to avoid.  Maybe next time use half tamari, half low sodium soy sauce?  Served it on top of rice, it was a good blend of hot and sweet.  Hard to tell the difference between the sweet potato and the mango, but it all tasted good!

This is soo delicious!! quite spicy and I loved the mango in it. Sweet but saucy and delicious. Could serve as the main dish for dinner with rice or pasta and a salad. mmmm. Favourite thing so far. Would probably still be good with no hot sauce in it if it needed to be tamed down for some people.

Excellent combination of flavors-sweet, hot and a little spicy.  I always nuke/bake potatoes til almost done and continue cooking with the remaining ingredients.  Did not use the cornstarch to thicken and still was great.  Perhaps just a bit more seasoning on the chicken to bring it up a notch.  Thanks for a great dish we will enjoy again!

Totally enjoyed this chicken. I will be making this again. My husband and I love the sweet and heat in this recipe. I served it with brown rice and broccoli and I will now keep this recipe on hand when we feel like an Asian chicken meal.

I loved this dish. A couple of minor changes I made. I peeled and cubed the potatoes, then put them in microwave cooking bag and cooked for 3-4 minutes. This gave them a nice texture and intensified the flavor. I broiled the chicken breasts, let them sit, then sliced into bit-size pieces. These were the last item to be added as I hate over-cooked chicken. Everything else was followed as stated, except I added very little hot sauce as "mild" is my heat of choice:) A great easy recipe that I will definitely cook again.

Totally, totally boring.  Just a stir fry with mangoes.  There is a very disproportionate amount of meat to the sweet potatoes and mangoes, and the sauce is hardly any sauce at all.  I was initially extremely disappointed; however,  I saved it by adding a can of coconut milk, some cinnamon, and 2/3 cup of craisins.  I served that over jasmine rice and it turned out WAY awesome.  I would rate the end result a five star, but the original recipe was lame.

Pretty tasty! Unfortunately, I didn't have any sweet potatoes so I had to use yams. It still worked well! My only complaint is that it smells worse than it tastes! I was worried before I tried it, but once I did I was convinced.

I used baked sweet potatoes, decreased the amount of honey, and ended up adding a little salt as it was still too sweet. It turned out ok but not something I'd make again - the flavors just didn't work well together for us. Thanks anyway.

This was an intriguing and delicious dish. I used whole chicken pieces, so I cooked it for a lot longer both alone and once mixed with the other ingredients (if I'd do that again, I'd cook the sweet potato for half the time so it doesn't get mushy). I also added about 2 c. of chopped pumpkin along with the sweet potato, and used a sweet chili sauce instead of hot sauce. Since I used extra veggies, this was great all on it's own.

Very easy, and very tasty. I decreased the spice level quite a bit so my kids would eat it, adding sweet thai chili sauce to the dish (about 1 tbs) and made my own personal serving spicier with siracha. But I loved the flavors, and it was so much better the next day. A definite keeper.

Yum!  I didn't have tamari, so I used regular soy sauce and it came out fine.  I recommend  mixing the tamari, honey, water, and about 1/2 the hot sauce, taste it, and then add more hot sauce to your liking.  I only used about 1 1/2 T, and it was plenty hot. After making this a few times, I like to add more mango than stated.  To make it a little more colorful, I like to add onion, sweet red pepper, and fresh spinach.  I cook all this with the garlic. Served over brown rice cooked in coconut milk, and it was fantastic.

My whole family enjoyed this one, however, the sauce is very flavorful which sometimes is good but we felt it over powered the flavors of everything else in this dish.

This has become a family favorite. I don't serve it over anything, it's perfect as it is. I do, however, make a green vegetable to serve with it. Yum!

Satisfied my taste for sweet and husbands taste for heat. I used cooking spray instead of oil and added a diced red pepper, and used less hot sauce than called for. Topped with cilantro and served as a stew (no rice or noodles) it was a quick and healthy meal.

Very flavorful.  I did not add the full hot sauce measurment.  Thank goodness.  Its pretty hot.  Also did not do the penne.  The sweet potatos were starch enough.  I will definently make this again.

Really good and would make again. Agree with another review that this doesn't need the sweet potato. Husband and I thought maybe next time carrots or green beans instead. Also watch the amount of hot sauce you put in. We like Sirachi so I used that and only about 2 tsps. It was mildly warm.

So I was running low on food in the kitchen, and typed in "sweet potato" and "chicken" into allrecipes to see what magical recipe it would yield me... and this popped up. Awesome recipe! I didn't have 1/3 of the ingredients so I subbed a lot... here's the mods I made:  used Bruce's canned yams (1 big can), olive oil instead of veggie oil, 3 tblspoons soy sauce + 3 tblspoons worchestershire (great mod!) vs. all soy sauce, 1 chopped green pepper in lieu of hot sauce (which I cooked w/ the minced garlic), and 3/4 cup Goya mango puree/juice (1 can) reduced to thicken in place of the 3/4 of water AND the 1 ripe mango (killed 2 birds w/ 1 stone). Served over pine nut couscous... AWESOME! Super tasty and really easy to make. Also, I put some meat tenderizer and pepper on the chicken before cooking... would def make this again

This was very good. I didn't make any changes except that I used whatever soy sauce was in my house, not tamari. I will definitely be eating this again, and again, and again.

The soy sauce was WAY too overpowering, so much so that we couldn't eat much of it. This recipe was a big flop in my house, all of the flavors got lost so I can't say if there was enough mango or not. If you cut the soy sauce down, it might be an interesting meal but I agree that it needs something green and crunchy to add some variety to the visual and textural appeal.

I really liked this dish.  I cut down the spice to 1 Tbs. hot sauce and 1/8 tsp. red pepper flakes.  I think I will add some red bell pepper and maybe some green onions next time for a little crisp veggie texture.  I used reduced sodium tamari and thought the salt content was just right with that.

Loved it!  Even the ones in my family who don't eat mangoes likes it.  My hubby got seconds, and he is one who is really picky about texture.  I did double the sweet potatoes, and added an extra half of mango cause that's what I had on hand.  Cause my kids don't like spicy, I only put 1 tbsp of hot sauce and added a little honey to my daughter's plate.  I had some leftover rice which I served on the side, but good with or without.

It had potential based on the list of ingredients, but 6 tbs of tamari overpowered the other flavors and made the whole dish VERY salty.  I couldn't even finish it.  I would definitely cut back to 3 tbs of tamari if I made it again.  Also, it was plenty spicy using about a 1/3 of the hot sauce and a generous dash of pepper flakes.  It also could have used more mango and something green, like broccoli perhaps.  Not sure if I'll try making it again with modifications.

This was a fantastic dish! It is very spicy, but my family likes spicy food, so this was a hit with them. I served it over rice vermicelli that you can buy at Asian supermarkets. We will definitely make this one again and again.

I made this last night.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars only because there are better dishes out there.  It wasn't bad but did require a little more I think.  I added a sweet onion and broccoli, plus the additional corn starch as recommended.  I also roasted the potatoes in the oven.   I probably won't make it again, but it was something different to do at least once.  Served with a small bit of brown rice.

Awesome! We definitely felt the burn on this one, which my husband and I both LOVE. I used a different soy sauce but everything else was exact and it came out delicious. If you want a thick sauce, I suggest removing all the chicken, potatoes and mangoes, add the cornstarch to thicken then add ingredients back in. Poured over spaghetti. Cant wait to make it again!

When I made this I left out the red pepper flakes because I wasn't sure about how hot it might be because I was serving it to friends. Tasted it and had to let hubby taste right away.When I served it to friends that night it was a big hit! She wanted the recipe. It will now be part of my regular dishes

Something the entire family liked!  (A rare event.) Next time I would double the veggies/mango and the sauce.  Not enough sauce to flavor the pasta as well as I would like.  My daughter loves mango and sweet potatos - so she ate most of the veggies.  Besides, I like left overs for work and they ate EVERYTHING!

this was so so.  One of my daughters loved it, the other ate it, and the boys wouldn't touch it.  It wasn't my favorite but not my worst either.  To be fair, I was distracted while cooking and I cooked the potatoes too long, making them less firm and less eye appealing.  I'm going to try this again when it's not a work/school night and the kids are outside playing instead of under my feet.

I can see why others would give this 5 stars, but because of personal preference really, I can't. I thought it was much to spicy but then again I'm not big on hot things. I served it over pasta, but I think rice would have been better. I also added less hot sauce and extra honey but it was still too hot for me.

I thought that this recipe was good but the spice was a little overpowering as written. I used sriracha for the hot sauce and served over angel hair pasta. I like that it's healthy and I think that with a few adjustments it could be really good. Maybe some ginger or something and a little less sriracha.

I made the recipe as written, and while I found the sweet potatoes slightly overcooked, the overall result was great.  It tastes just like stir-fry, and even my fruit and veggie hating husband ate it up.

Was really, really good. I made this just for me, and veganized it. I replaced tofu for the chicken, and pressed for 10 minutes before hand. I used equal parts water and brown sugar in place of the honey, and used only 1/2 teaspoon of hot sauce and soy sauce. It turned out with the perfect sweetness and saltiness, but for those who like spicy it definitely could have used more. Overall great recipe and easy to make for one!

I added green bell pepper and onion, as another reviewer suggested, and used Vietnamese garlic chili sauce instead of regular hot sauce.  So yummy!

This turned out better than I expected - after the first bite I was still nervous - but it grew on me.  I used more garlic and decreased the honey and the hot sauce.  Next time I'll only use a little mango - the chunks were not my favorite.  Had this with naan and brown rice.  Yum!  My 2 year old enjoyed it too.

This recipe sounded really tasty when I read it, but I cooked it last night and was not very impressed.  It was okay, but I don't think I will be making it again.  It turned out a little blah for my taste.  I like lots of flavor and spice...it did have a little kick to it, but nothing to write home about.

Made this for Father's Day dinner. It was so yummy and way easier then I thought it would be.  I only added half the suggested amount of hot sauce (figured I could add more if needed) and it was just the right amount of heat for us. A very unique and different recipe!

I made this but I didn’t have chicken so I made it with pork!  It was delicious!  I also didn’t have hot sauce but I had Korean hot paste so I used that & it was perfect!  I’ll definitely make this again maybe I’ll try chicken next time.

I was actually on a quest to find a good asian sauce to serve with rice and chicken and this worked perfectly!  I have cut gluten, corn, and potatoes from my diet, so was thrilled to see the ingredient list as it is hard to find something with none of those items.  As I was mainly going for the sauce, I simmered the mango in the sauce until softened (doubled the mango to two) and then threw the sauce and mango in a blender.  Heavenly perfection!  I didn't use corn starch as I am avoiding, but the mango made the sauce nice and thick.

The flavors in this sounded so good, but I didn't want the pasta so I used 4 sweet potatoes which I cubed and roasted.   I cooked 8 boneless chicken thighs first, then set them aside.  Sauted the garlic, mango, and added a red bell pepper for 5 mins then poured in a combination of 1 1/2 cups water, 1/4 cup lite soy, 1/4 cup sweet soy, 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup chipotle tabasco, and 2 T sambal.  Thickened with cornstarch and served sauce over chicken and potatoes.  Sweet, savory, and nicely spicy.  Instant hit at my house

I liked this a lot. Used 1 teaspoon of coconut oil and browned tempeh for the chicken. Balanced the sweet to hot for my taste, added green pepper and served over quinoa. Nice easy vegan meal.

Great recipe!  I cooked the chicken in some grated ginger to begin with and didn't use as much hot sauce (and I'm glad about that!)  This has just the right amount of spice to it!  Can't wait to make it again!  I saw other users say they used cilantro, pineapple bits, and onion.  I may try that in the future.  I wonder what this would taste like over a bed of spinach?!

Roasted the sweet potatoes as reviewers recommended.  Doubled the recipe, but used only the 3 TBL hot sauce (used Tobasco) and eliminated the red pepper flakes.  It was still very hot.  Used low sodium regular soy sauce, which worked out well.  My friends loved this dish.

So, I like the idea, but the recipe as written is terrible. First, as others mentioned, it is way too salty. Perhaps it was supposed to read 6 teaspoons of tamari? I used only half of what was called for and it was barely edible. Also, the proportion of the meat to "veggies" was way off. I had to hunt around for pieces of non-meat. I also had to up the hot sauce (I used sriracha). 
To improve this, I would replace the mango and sweet potato with real vegetables, because with a sweet sauce, you barely notice them. Then, I would use 3 tablespoons of tamari and 1 tablespoon of fish sauce to add more complexity. I also only use boneless skinless thighs, as they stay more moist. 
I served it over quinoa, which was great, as there was lots of sauce (it was more like a stew than a stir-fry, which I liked about the recipe).

Turned out great! Family loved it. I didn't have soy sauce, used teriyaki sauce instead. Still tasted wonderful.

This is surprisingly good! I think it is more sweet than spicy but not overly so. The mix of mangoes and sweet potatoes with the sauce is very delightful. Serve with rice for sure!

Maybe I did it wrong... I just wasn't a fan of the sweet potatoes... The sauce was really good...  I'd make it again swapping pineapple for the sweet potatoes

We like this a lot but I wouldn't say it's the best or anything. Definitely very good thought and a keeper in our book.

I added and extra garlic because I love garlic! I also used 4 tablespoons of soy sauce instead of the 6 & it was AWESOME!
