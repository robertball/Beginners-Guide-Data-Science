I had seen this recipe advertised everywhere so I decided to finally give it a shot. This was a yummy and easy to make, great for a weeknight meal, especially if you are able to prepare it the night before. I used a whole jar of the mushroom tomato sauce and a small can of sliced mushrooms in with the tomato sauce layer. I also did not use the broiler, I just removed the foil and continued to let it bake instead.

I've made this lasagna often because it's so easy and tastes so good!  I've always followed the recipe closely, except I use whole wheat lasagna noodles and fresh mushrooms for added flavor.  No need to put under the broiler, just remove foil and bake until cheese is golden.

Easy and fairly quick (a good kid's meal).  Go ahead and place a layer of noodles out first and take the layering from there (easier to serve after it's baked!)

My husband and I both hate cottage cheese and/or ricotta in lasagna. This was such a great alternative that it is now /THE/ recipe in our house.

I made this yesterday and really liked it.  The only thing I added was a layer of fresh mushrooms.  I'll definitely make this again -- quick & easy & delicious!

I still added a carton of Ricotta cheese to the soup and milk mixture because I love Ricotta in Lasagna.  Also, used Traditional Prego sauce and added fresh mushrooms to the sauce instead.  If you love mushrooms, you must try this Lasagna!

This is by far the best lasagna recipe I've found. I added a cup of cottage cheese to the meat sauce, an extra layer of noodles on the bottom, and lots of extra cheese on top. YUMMY!

I made this the other evening for my boyfriend and I.  As I was putting it together I could see his face and he looked very worried!  I think the lack of Ricotta and addition of mushroom soup was the problem.  However, once it came out of the oven and he took the first bite he was won over. This is a lighter lasagna than typical but with all (or even more) of the taste.  I didn't have mushroom Italian sauce so used regular but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We just finished the leftovers and he is already asking when I will make it again!

This was a hit in the flavor department for sure.  My only complaint is that it came out too liquidy.  I think I should have baked it uncovered for the whole 30 minutes.

Ok.  I tried this recipe for the 1st time.  Although the taste was absolutely delicious, mine didn't come out as firm as I would have like it.  It was really soupy!  What did I do wrong???

This was easy and good! Pasta hating boyfriend liked it, too! :) Made it exactly as directed except used whole jar of sauce and used a mix of mozzerella & swiss. Will make this again; not only does it taste good, but tastes better than the effort that is required to make it!

Loved this! I added some ground Italian Sausage with the Ground Beef, cooked onions and garlic in the ground beef fat and added oregano to the meat/sauce mixture. This is a keeper!

This is a quick and delicious version of lasagne.  I have made it several times now and everyone just loves it.  I sometimes add more mushrooms, fresh or canned, whatever I have on hand.  Also use the whole jar of pasta sauce.

Very easy to make. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this lasagna, he had 4 pieces! I added sliced mushrooms to each soup layer as well as adding softened onions, chopped garlic and thyme to the soup mixture. I also had some gruyere cheese in the fridge so I substituted some of the shredded cheese for that. Turned out great!

I thought that this was delicious!  The only complaint I found with the meal came, "needs more salt."  I would suggest using a little garlic salt in with the beef and even giving the top a sprinkle of garlic salt between the oven and the broiler.  Once again, this was delicious and made a great (and easy!) meal!

Finally I got my household to try lasagna.  First I had to swear there was no hidden Ricotta(they hate it).  There were no leftovers.  Next time I may try nixing the meet and layer veggies instead.  I wonder if there's a way to use something like this in stuffed giant shells.  Thanks so much.

Great recipe - easy to make.  I added green peppers and mushrooms to the meat sauce mixture and used cheddar cheese as that is what I had on hand.  My husband loved it.  I had also put a layer of noodles on the bottom.

This was okay. Seemed to me missing something. Probably would not make again. I did add some garlic, onion and canned mushrooms to the meat mixture for some added flavor but was still kind of bland.
