Alas – if it weren’t for the fact that this is too heavy on the soy sauce this would have been a 5-star recipe.  (See the overly brown chicken in my photo!)  Seasonings otherwise delicious and spot on (except I used extra garlic and a pinch of ground ginger instead of fresh).  For flavor and color contrast I went a little skimpier on the broccoli and added red bell pepper strips, sliced sweet onion and sliced mushrooms.  This is a beautiful and deliciously flavored dish, one I’m certain to make again…with about half as much soy sauce.

As written, 3 1/2 stars.  With some simple changes, definitely a keeper!  It was fairly bland before changes were made.  Upped garlic to 2 tsp, sambal oelek to 2 tsp.  Added 1/4 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp sriracha, 2 tsp fish sauce, 2 tsp lemon juice, 1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and 2 packets of Splenda.  PERFECT!  Served over brown rice cooked in chicken broth.  This recipe would lend itself well to pretty much any stir fry veggie or meat.

Truth: I am a stir fry disaster. I always try to make great dishes, but the meat ends up rubbery and the vegetables end up overcooked. This recipe knocks it out of the park. My daughter is my ultimate critic, and she LOVED it. I made it almost exactly as written. I didn't have any sherry, so I used rice wine, and it was great. I love sherry, though, so next time I will use that. The chicken "marinade" does something magical to the meat that makes it melt in your mouth. I liked that the meat was sliced instead of cut into chunks. When I made the sauce, I did what lots of others recommended and kept the soy sauce the same, while doubling everything else. There were no leftovers. After everyone else was finished, my husband got up and spooned the last of it on his plate. (Needless to say, it was good.) I served it with jasmine rice, which I had sauteed with onion in a little bit of coconut oil before I added the water. Delicious! The slightly "coconutty" rice perfectly complemented the meal.

I did not have sambal oelek or sherry so just used soy sauce and oyster sauce and this turned out quite good.

Easy to make, I also doubled all wet ingredients except for Soy.  This made a good amount of sauce, and seemed fine on saltiness.  Very similar to what you will get at your local Chinese restaurant!  Yum!

I made this but used Shao Xing cooking wine. But I am sure Sherry would work too.  I did marinate my chicken in the the sauce for a while (4 hr.)  it was great!  Thanks.

I doubled the sauce except for the soy sauce and added some brown sugar. More than a keeper. Thinking of adding water chestnuts and shrimp in the future.

Terrific! I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. The chicken comes out so tender. I cut back on the soy sauce and the fish sauce and used Thai chili paste instead of sambal oelek and Rooster sauce to add zing. This one's a keeper. My husband liked it but thought it could use more sauce so next time I will add a little chicken broth

Super easy and delicious.  I used chicken tenders, broccoli, an onion and a red and yellow bell pepper.  Used low salt soy sauce and a dash of hoisin sauce.  Worked beautifully.

I just made it for Valentine's dinner, and my family enjoyed it. I used a couple less tablespoons of soy sauce; I also substituted hot sauce for the spicy element and added a little brown sugar based on another review I read. It came out great. I served it over white rice. It didn't take long at all. I'll be making this again.

I made significant changes based on ingredients on hand.  I splashed some olive oil in a large skillet.  and drizzled a small amount to the top of cooking chicken. Added green and red bell pepper and onion to the stir-fry. I added paprika, cayenne pepper, lemon pepper, black pepper, ground ginger, poultry seasoning and cornstarch in a small bowl (for seasoning and thickening) and sprinkled on cooking chicken.  I omitted oyster sauce and sherry and used less soy sauce than listed.  I did add a splash of worchestershire sauce with the soy sauce. Removed chicken and added broccoli florets.  Mixed the chicken back in the skillet and served with brown rice.  Yum on a budget.

My family loved this recipe.  The only change that we made was to use cooking white wine in place of the sherry because that is what i had.  Will be having this again.  We added jasmine rice and egg roles on side.

Delicious sauce. Easy to make with ingredients already in the pantry. I substituted the sherry for cider vinegar and a bit of brown sugar, and served it over white rice.

I made this recipe in conjunction with the Velveting Chicken Stir Fry recipe and it turned out delicious! The extra steps of the Velveting process were totally worth it and the Chicken and Broccoli recipe is easy and just like it was made in a Chinese restaurant.

I thought it was way too salty!  I appreciated the method however. The cornstarch on the chicken before cooking gave the end product the perfect shiny sauce. I’d eliminate at least 1 Tbls of soy sauce and add 1/2 tsp of sugar.

I was looking for a base recipe & this definitely came through for me! Not having all the ingredients, I winged it a lot. Since I only had 1 chicken breast I pretty much halved the ingredients going in the bowl with chicken. Didn't have sambal oelek, nor oyster sauce, & was thinking about substitutions for these, but just ended up omitting them. I went heavy on the minced garlic & the ginger, since I love these flavors.  Instead of broccoli, I used a frozen bag of Steamed Broccoli Stir-fry (broccoli florets/sugar snap peas/carrots/water chestnuts), which I undercooked in the microwave & added to the frying pan of sweet onions.  The short video was so helpful, too! Thanks for the original recipe, anemptyroad!  My family loved it!

I’m sure the recipe is great as written hence the four stars. I was at a client’s and he didn’t have a lot of the ingredients called for here. I ended up substituting the sherry for red wine vinegar and he didn’t have any sugar so I added a tablespoon or so of maple syrup as when I tasted the sauce it was quite salty and harsh. The end result was yummy and well received.

Was a bit salty for my taste. I’ll probably eliminate the salt at the end next time. Otherwise it was great.

This is my 'go to' recipe for this type of dish.  It's quite easy to cut back on the soy sauce if you find it to be too salty.  We don't salt our rice when we steam it so I don't find salt to be an issue.  It's easy to vary the veggies you use if you like.  I sometimes add mushrooms or red bell pepper for something different.  It's also good with some cashews stirred in at the end.

I didn't have any sambal olek, so I used some sriracha instead. I'm glad I had the oyster sauce on hand, because it was really the star of the sauce. It came out very delicious, and paired well with jasmine rice. Definitely making it again.

I used virgin coconut oil for the vegetable oil. Added sliced red pepper, sliced onions, sliced jalapeño, Sriracha, Thai fish sauce, low sodium soy sauce,  xtra chopped fresh ginger/garlic and at the end a handful of chopped basil (to give it a fresh herb/green Thai taste). I too loved the sliced chicken (instead of the normal chunks) and kept them meaty enough to stay moist (used those great organic free range Coleman chicken breasts from Costco-the best). I thought the corn starch added a great coating and since I use a heavy wok I work it so no burn or sticking? Long grain brown rice in the rice steamer. What a healthy delicious dinner! Thanks for the recipe!!

I used the same amount of mirin (rice wine). I was afraid that this recipe would end up being too salty, but it was not. It was a little bit salty by itself, but fine when served over rice. My preference was to use half the amount of sambal oelek; that did not alter the flavor of the dish. Due to the timing of how we cooked it, we needed to add a couple of tablespoons of water right before we served it. It's a very forgiving recipe. I will make this again.

This was very good. I used chicken tenderloins, which were very tender. I wanted to sweeten the sauce a bit, but am low-carbing it, so I added 2 packets of Splenda and 1/4 teaspoon of molasses. It was just right.

Just wondering if anyone has tried this with beef or pork as well as the chicken?

Thank you to all the reviewers who mentioned cutting the soy sauce. I cut it to a third, added brown sugar and it was fabulous. With the amount of soy called for in the recipe, though, it would have been way too overpowering.

Also, as another reviewer mentioned, did not add the corn starch to the marinade because I didn't want gluey, coated chicken. Added it to the sauce, which I pretty much doubled.

Very versatile recipe. I've made it with the broccoli, but also with snow peas and pineapple for a Thai flair. And if you  don't have sambal oelek use sriracha or any other hot sauce or chili paste. Works fine.

It turned out well, but a bit too salty. I would've cut back on the soy sauce or used a low-sodium soy sauce. I added a large stalk of celery sliced on the diagonal with the rest of the vegetables in step 2 -- turned out nice.

I enjoyed this - I made it exactly as written except I had to substitute Port Wine (which is sweet) for the Dry Sherry, and I added Shitake Mushrooms.  I thought it was odd that the Cornstarch is added to the chicken, but it worked.  There was NOT too much soy for my family's taste, although we didn't need to add any to the Stir Fry on top of the Rice on our plates, which we would normally do.  See my Pics!

This recipe has potential but it needs to be tweaked. And yes, I rated the 4-star on the original recipe. I inherently knew while making the dish that the flavors wouldn't balance well, everything in the sauce has a bitter undertone & the amount of soy sauce it calls for is twice what you need. I agree that some brown sugar would be a nice balance to the second sauce recipe (that you pour over the broccoli). Also, I added a TBS of cornstarch to the broccoli sauce which thickened it nicely. I wonder if the instructions for putting the cornstarch in the chicken base sauce was just a typo. All it did was make a gooey mess in the sauté pan. I did double the amount of broccoli sauce, you need to if you plan on serving this over rice.

Very good. But instead of soy sauce, I used Maggi, and since my husband and I like spicy, but my daughter and grandson don't, I added chili paste to my serving. I know I will be making this again.

I did a few changes, because I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I also put in some brown sugar and that gave it a little bit of sweet taste.  I also put in another Asian sweet and savor sauce because I didn't have oyster sauce.  I am actually happy not to have oyster sauce.  I just used frozen vegetables.  It came out very good.  I hope next time I remember how I did this.  :D
