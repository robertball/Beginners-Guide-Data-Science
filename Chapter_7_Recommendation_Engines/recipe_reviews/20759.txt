Delicious! I used this on chicken, but can't wait to try it on beef.  I used olive oil instead of veg. oil and low sodium soy sauce.  I also opted for minced garlic from the jar vs. garlic powder.  I pounded the chicken down to tenderize and to thin them out a bit before marinating them all day.  They soaked up most of the marinade.  I think using honey actually made the green onions stick better and I had no trouble with anything burning on the grill.  If you like this marinade, you'll love Unbelievable Chicken from this site.  UPDATE: I marinated sirloin steak with this marinade for 6 hours with the same modifications and it came out great.  This does work on beef or chicken!

Wow....this is some fantastic stuff!!! MY hubby, the "cook," was ready to call people and brag on me for creating this wonderful chicken.  I used about 8 tenders, and I had to adjust the recipe slightly.  I used cider vinegar instead of white, 1 1/2 tbs. of minced onion instead of green onion, 3 tbs. of brown sugar instead of the honey, and I didn't use the ginger.  Also, I only marinated for about 2 hrs.  Let me tell you....this was sooooo yummy!  I broiled in the oven and flipped them every few minutes at first, and then as they started to really caramelize I flipped every 1 1/2 minutes....about 9 minutes total.  Moist and flavorful!!!  Not at all salty...but, I suspect if you marinated for a long time...maybe that's when the soy would become overpowering. We can't say enough about this marinade....next is chicken legs!

Very good. I used this on boneless skinless chicken breasts, which I halved. I grilled them on foil for a few minutes to allow the chicken to cook without burning the outside (other reviewers mentioned the marinade burned easily). Then I put them directly on the grill until they were done. They turned out perfectly.

I made the marinade for beef with the intention of grilling it but at dinner time we felt like a stir fry....I stir fried the beef in a bit of oil, set it aside and stir fried some veggies, added a bit of the marinade (bring to a boil first to kill the germy things that may be in there) and served over rice. It may be the best stir fry we've ever had. Bye bye store boughy stir fry sauce!

This recipe is easy to prepare.  I also like the fact that the ingredients are readily available.  When I looked at the set of ingredients, though, I thought that it can still be improved.  Instead of using vegetable oil, I used olive oil because it has better aroma and it leaves a hint of flavor in ur dishes (rather than vegetable oil which can be bland for some people).  Likewise, I also increased the amount of honey in the recipe (or sugar).  I also used regular onions instead of green onions because the flavor or the onion bulb is stronger.  Feel free to add dried herbs and spices to taste. Squeeze in lemon juice.  Marinade it for 3 days before grilling, or broiling, or baking.

Very Moist!  I halved this recipe, used chicken tenders and used agave nectar in place of honey.  Only marinated for 1 hour and still had good flavor.   This was a nice, quick and used ingredients I had on hand.  Will use this again.

GREAT! Followed recipe to a tee...marinated both t-bone steaks and boneless chix breasts to grill out over the weekend.  Beef could've marinated longer, but the chicken was wonderful and flavorful.  Will use regularly, have ingredients on hand always.

I used this on pork chops.  It was so good.  The marinade is slightly sweet and really has a good flavor.  I didn't have any green onions, so I used just sliced regular onions.

Used this for lunch today.  Worked out wonderfully.  I agree with some other reviewers that the soy sauce was a bit strong.  I will use again with some tinkering.  Thank you for the post.

SO good! Last night I took two steaks and let them marinade over night. This morning I put the steaks and marinade in the crock pot on low for five hours! OHHH!! It was fantastic! My hubby and I agree that this will be made again!

Hokay, so normally I am terrible at making chicken -- baking, grilling, stovetop, you name it and I've botched it. The chicken always turned out dry and flavorless...that is, until I tried this recipe. 

I followed pretty much every single step to a "t", except the part about oil -- I've been trying to cook/eat healthier (otherwise I would've hauled my lazy bum over to the school cafeteria), and cut down the oil to 1/2 cup.

In a spurt of wannabe cooking creativity, I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup *DARK SESAME OIL*. After marinating my 2 lbs of chicken overnight and panicking because I thought I overused the sesame oil and it was gonna set my oven on fire (thankfully, smoke point of sesame oil is decently high, despite it not intended for baking), the chicken turned out AMAZING. Now I have enough chicken for 7 more meals, though I'll probably regain my frosh 15 thanks to this recipe. 

FYI -- I had enough marinade to use on 3 lbs of skinless chicken breasts.

7/11/2010: I used this marinade on venison kebobs and my husband said if I was rating this to give it 5 stars. Now if he says it's a five star that means it's real good! He told me twice while eating how much he likes this marinade. I can't wait to try it on steaks and chicken now! Definitely a keeper.  8/24/2010: Update - Since my last review I have tried this on chicken breasts and ribeyes and they were absolutely delicious. This is perfect for any cut of meat. I am thinking of trying it on pork now! This is now my go-to marinade recipe!

Good marinade that you can make with items you already have in your cabinet. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white and added some apple juice. This sweetened it a bit more. This was good. We used it on pork cultets and pork steaks.

This is bangin' hard.  I did not use ginger or the onion in mine, nor do I ever measure ANY ingredients with proper "instruments".  Always my eyeballs and heart.  Marin'd 6 chicken breasts for 18 hours with this shizzy and let me tell you it was off the hook!  This is Bomb.

Haven't tried it for beef yet, but it's the best marinade I have ever found for chicken! Takes a bit more prep time than opening a packet or bottle, but it is well worth it! Left overs are great for wraps or fajitas also.

I made this marinade exactly as submitted   except I minced vadalia onion and used it on sirloin tips bound for the grill.  The marinade was delicious with a slight bite thanks to the pepper and perfect amount of sweetness thanks to the honey.  I think I'll try adding some paprika next time to add just a touch of that smoke taste.

I didn't have soy sauce so I used a touch of teriyaki sauce. I only had time to marinade for 3 hours -- it was great, but would have been even better if I marinaded it over night! Served with veggies on the side and slaw.

This marinade is delicious with chicken.   It passed the taste test with the toughest critic in my house, my 3 year-old!  

It helps to use a meat hammer to tenderize the chicken breasts a bit before dropping them into the marinade.  They'll soak up more marinade that way since you've given the tenderization a kick start.  I also found that cutting the breasts up after using the meat hammer into small chunks works well in a stir fry.

Wonderful marinade! I used it for steak. Didn't have any green onions, so I used about 1.5 tsp of onion powder. I marinated for about 5 hours, then rinsed off the meat before broiling. (I've been burned with overpowering marinades before.) It was great - slightly sweet and tangy, not too soyish for me. I wanted to lick the plate when I was finished! Definitely a keeper.

I tried this marinade on chicken kabobs (chicken breast, peppers, onions, mushrooms on bamboo skewers.)  I marinated the kabobs about 8 hours which was just long enough.  I added some vegetable oil to the recipe so the kabobs wouldn't stick to the grill. The kabobs turned out just delicious!

Great recipe! I used it on chicken breasts and it was delicious. The taste was that of restaurant quality. Even the picky eater in my house loved them. I will definitely use this recipe again!
Thanks!

Delicious!  I accidentally marinated the chicken for 2 days but it was wonderful.  The chicken was so flavorful.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used this marinade with chicken for a stir fry.  Delicious!  I made the full recipe but only needed half for the three chicken breasts I used so put the other half in the fridge to use on the next thing I want to marinade! Thanks for the recipe!

I tasted it before marinating and I thought it was pretty oily and flat tasting... tried to 'amp' it up with some red pepper flakes and salt.  Marinated flank steak for almost 6 hours, couldn't really taste any of the marinade on the steak and it paled in comparison to the pepper/salt rub we did on the other flank steak.  Nobody commented on the flavor or asked for the recipe.  Keep looking...

Marinated chicken thighs for 2 days, and then grilled the thighs. Everyone RAVED about the marinade. Next time, I think I'd use fresh garlic instead of the powder (because I like a stronger garlic taste), but this is a great marinade as-is.

Wow! This marinade was great! I loved the taste and my family liked it so much they immediately asked when we could eat it again! I highly recommend this marinade as it gives chicken a somewhat tangy and delectable flavor!

I made the marinade slightly differently than above and it turned out AMAZING! I left out the ginger (I just don't care for it), substituted brown sugar for the honey, substituted minced onion for the chopped onion, substituted apple cider vinegar instead of white distilled, and substituted olive oil for vegetable oil (very minor changes all-in-all). I cut up chicken breast tenderloins into half-inch cubes and marinated for 7 hours. Then I put them in a baking dish and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. They were perfect! This marinade is an absolute keeper. My boyfriend raved about how delicious the chicken was! There were absolutely no leftovers. :)

I am eating less chicken and meat but I did have a small taste so that I can give an honest review.  It makes a great marinade for chicken but a little too sweet, next time I’ll use less honey.  My family loves it.

We used this with steak and  were not very fond of it - No flavor at all. I am not even going to try this with chicken since I already have a favorite. Marinated for 4 hours - grilled and steak was perfectly grilled - we just needed some flavor and had some a1 sauce with it. sorry but this one will go out of my cookbook....................

This is SERIOUSLY the BEST marinade EVER!

We usually don't have green onions on hand so we skip them, and we reduce the amount of honey or don't use it at all and it's always just the best.  I fall back on this when we have last minute guests and they always LOVE it.

I used red wine vinegar, worchershire sauce, brown sugar, and chopped garlic. I liked those flavors a lot and although I did not follow your recipe to a T I will next time in acception to the soy sauce because my boyfriend doesnt like soy at all. Thank you for giving such a great base to spark other ideas!!!!

I absolutely love this marinade! I made a few minor changes... I used balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, olive oil, and withheld the ginger (I didn't have any). The whole family liked the chicken I prepared and that almost never happens!

Easy marinade to throw together! Didn't have the white vinegar so I used red wine ving. I also didn't have a good four hours to wait so I pounded boneless skinless breasts thin - think cutlets - and let marinade for about an hour 1/2. grilled on each side about 5-7 minutes and YUM! Even my hubby decided it was tasty. He's so sick of chicken he never has anything good to say about it! LOoking forward to trying it on beef and pork :) Thanks!

I made this marinade to use on some chicken.  I didn't have enough soy sauce, so I used half soy and half teriyaki.  But this was the only change I made.  I thought this was absolutely delicious.  The pickiest eater in my family was the first to speak up and say 'This chicken is really nice, when are we having it again?'  To me, that is the highest praise ever so, needless to say, this is now going to be one of my most used recipes!

Made a triple batch of this for pork loin and grilled/smoked it on the grill. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, used garlic salt instead of garlic powder (but used only 1/3rd the amount). My company and wife couldn't stop raving about the flavor.

Absolutely super great to awsome. I found this recipe today and just happened to have some chicken thighs and legs.
Only extra thing I did was sprinle in a little 
lemon-pepper. Just Fantastic.

Used this on pork. Used olive oil in place of vegetable oil, but other than that, didn't change a thing. Next time I will marinate longer...I wanted the meat to have more of that flavor.

I can't believe I did not rate this delicious recipe and I've already made it about 5 times. I don't even measure I just add in more of the ingredients that I like the most which are a lot more cut up scallions, more honey, garlic powder, ginger & black pepper and it tastes even better!

I made this for my boyfriend and I tonight.  Not the best...We just didn't like it.  I think it was more out of preference.  Both of us were expecting it to be a little bit more flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly.  And unfortunately, it just didn't have the flavor we desired.

Wonderful recipe!  I've made this a half a dozen times over the summer.  I use it on chicken breasts cut into strips, let it marinade, put the chicken strips on skewers, then grill them.  Serve with a side of steamed rice, and it makes a wonderful meal.  Even my teenager, who hates marinades and sauces, loves this.

Very good!  Subbed fresh garlic for the powder.  Subbed olive oil for the vegetable oil and used just a couple of grinds of pepper.  Marinated 10 hours....  We really enjoyed this chicken.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tried this marinade on both beef and chicken for kabobs.  My first time making kabobs on the grill.  They turned out great.  The marinade was wonderful and I will be using it again.....and again......and again.  It's a keeper.  Thanks Allrecipes.

Wow this is good stuff!!  I followed most of the directions, except I put in Rice Vinegar.  I also didn't add the ginger.  I did marinate the chicken breast for 3 hours, which really got the great taste soaked in.  I want to try this on the steaks too!  Thanks again!

We love this for a chicken marinade.  Haven't tried it on beef yet, but look forward to this summer!

I tried injecting an 18 lb turkey with this marinade.  Guess what? I didn't like the meat wherever I injected it.  It was way too strong! So those parts will definitely go into soup. Probably won't try this baby again.

I thought this was excellent.  I marinated both turkey and beef (a fairly cheap cut) in it for about 6 hours.  Then we put them on skewers and grilled them on the BBQ.  Our guests raved about them.  I had leftover raw meat that I left in the marinade overnight and then cooked that meat in a skillet.  The meat was very tender and the flavor was still really good if not better than the night before.

I enjoyed the flavor of this, but it really flared up when I put it on the grill. When I make it again, I will let the meat drain a bit so it doesn't drip.

I know it says 'beef or chicken' but I used this marinade on port chops and it was great.  I didn't have any ginger but it was excellent anyway.  My daughter said it was the first time she ever felt the need to eat a second pork chop!

I used this for barbecued chicken breasts (boneless, skinless). I used 1 tsp each of minced ginger & garlic instead of the powders. The chicken turned out very savory and moist, and my guests ate it up. I'll definitely use this in the future.

This is a great recipe; it's very flavorful and really easy.  I used this on chicken.  I didn't use green onions, but rather 1/2 tsp. onion powder.  I boiled the remaining marinade and we ate it over our rice.  It was great!

Considering I only had about 2 hours to marinate this is had great flavor!  Since I eat Paleo I subbed out the soy sauce for coconut aminos and switched vegetable oil with olive oil.  Can't wait to try this when I have time to marinade over night!

I made 1/3 of this recipe for two large bone-in chicken breast halves, which looked to be an adequate amount.  I used fresh minced garlic instead of powder and omitted the ginger, as I'm not a fan.  I zapped this with my emersion blender to emulsify it and smooth it out, and I marinated the chicken for about 7 hours.  I had high hopes for this and it did smell wonderful while grilling, but Hubs and I were both disappointed.  There just wasn’t much flavor going on with this one.

LOVED THIS MARINADE.  Chose it over others because I had all ingredients in the pantry.  Used it with chicken. Didnt add as much garlic or ginger and used minced onions instead of green.  Marinated for 4 hours and the taste was subtle and yummy.  My family gobbled it all up, even my picky-eater daughter couldnt stop raving, she was just as surprised as I was that she enjoyed it.  Winner winner chicken dinner :)

I am trying this marinade out on flank steak today.  Before adding the meat, I tasted the marinade to see if it needed anything extra.  It was great, but I ended up adding 2 tsp. of minced garlic (from a jar) and it was even better.  Let's see how this turns out tonight.  Will update as soon as I try it.  Thanks soo much for the recipe.
UPDATE:  i stir fried the meat with 1/2 yellow onion sliced and fresh mushrooms.  I served it over brown rice and my family loved it.  The meat had a great flavor!

I prepared this as directed excluding the ginger because I don't care for it. Both my husband and I thought it was the best chicken marinade we've ever had (that wasn't BBQ) 

Definitely will make it again and have shared it with friends and family!

Marinated some chicken before my morning exercise so my fiancé and I could enjoy a tasty Sunday lunch! He loved it from the second he smelled the marinade. I did leave out the green onions because we didn't have any, and I reduced the amount of oil used. Grilled, our chicken was delicious!

Simple but tasty - came together easily with simple ingredients from around the kitchen.

As other users suggested, I subbed in olive oil for the vegetable oil, and used white wine vinegar.

The chicken breasts turned out beautifully on the BBQ!

A very flavorful and easy marinade!  I did not have honey for a sweetener so I used agave nectar.  Next time I'll try brown sugar.  Marinaded steaks and grilled.  My family loved it!  Thanks so much!

I used this on flank steaks and let it marinate for 48 hrs and it was amazing on the BBQ! I also used low sodium soy sauce since soy sauce is so salty.

I cut this recipe in half - there are only two of us here.  I did, though, make it as written except for the substitution of a tbls of dehydrated sweet onion for the green onion.  The filets are marinating and I don't know quite yet how this recipe will turn out - I can say, though, the marinade was delicious!  I'm quite optimistic!  Not too salty, not too sweet.  Quite tasty!  I'm sure I'll give it five stars when the steaks are done.

This marinade was fantastic and loved by everyone. I used regular sweet onions and marinated chicken breasts in a large plastic bag inserted into a bowl to get better coverage and easier to rotate them. I also baked them in the oven instead of grilling them. Next time I will not turn them so quickly because the marinade slid off a bit which required me to baste them in order to keep this delicious marinade covering the breasts. This is a must keep recipe! Without knowing the name of this marinade, my father excitedly said, "This would be great used with meatloaf!" Meatloaf is one of his favorite meals, so this was the ultimate compliment coming from him. Thank you soooo very much for this post. By the way, my youngest daughter who thinks onions are gross, absolutely couldn't stay away from the abundant onion filled marinade covering the chicken. Don't be afraid of overdoing the onions!

YUMMY!!  I followed the directions exactly and blended it with my stick blender.  That gave it a nice thick consistency and it stuck to the meat well during marinating.  I used it on flapp meat and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again and again - looking forward to trying it on chicken.  Thank you for this keeper!!!

Great! I agree with others, soy sauce is a little much. I grill chicken on tin foil and pour extra marinade over chicken to give extra flavor. I move chicken off the tin foil for the final few minutes to give the grilled flavor and look.

Amazing!  I substituted fresh pressed garlic and chopped white onion since I didn't have green onions, and it is terrific!  A real grilling staple around here.  I love using it on kabobs, because they are able to really soak up the flavor.

My entire family enjoyed this marinade.  We used it on boneless chicken breasts and they came out very flavorful.

My changes: I used rice wine vinegar instead of regular vinegar (more of an asian taste) and I forgot the ground black pepper.

Next time I think I'd let the meat marinade longer than 4 hours just because I'd like the taste to permiate the meat more!

I thought this was a very tasty marinade.  I let a top round marinate for about 6 hours and then grilled it.  My problem was that the meat was not very tender at all.  I know it's a tough cut but I was hoping for a little better.  Maybe an overnight marinating session was have been appropriate.  IT's probably fantastic on a rib-eye, though.

Love it!  I have searched for a tasty marinade that is not too soy-flavored and not too sweet--this fits the bill.  I had to substitute dehydrated onion for the green onion and apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar.  It was fantastic--a definite keeper!  And the chicken seemed so moist and tender.

I made this for 4th of July and everyone LOVED IT(including myself), because I was pressed for time I was only able too refrigerate it for 30 min, but what I did was that I BBQ the chicken with the marinade. It became a bit messy and sticky when it began to thicken, but the end result was perfection. 

That being said, the only problem/ complain that I had was when I made it a second time. The only thing I did differently was that I left it in the fridge for 5 hours before cooking it. The end result was not like the first time. To me it tasted weird, and not very plesant. It just had a bad flavor. I will definetly make this again, BUT like the first time.

All together it was great so it deserves 5 stars

This was very good, and the flavors are not overpowering. As others did, I used cider vinegar instead of white, 1 1/2T minced onion instead of green onions, and 3T brown sugar instead of honey, fresh garlic, no ginger, and olive oil. I marinated it for 45 min, and it was delicious. Maybe could marinate it for longer and still be good. This was great for chicken, but didn't have too much success with beef. I guess I just didn't like the flavor with beef as well. Great marinade!

Very flavorful.  Made this tonight with chicken, for a stirfry with bok choy, edamame and spring onions over brown basmati rice.  Wish I'd had some spare marinade for a little extra sauce, but the chicken was fantastic and not as sweet as I had feared.  I marinaded the chicken for about 7 hours before cooking.  

I used grated ginger root instead of powdered ginger, and minced fresh garlic instead of the powdered stuff too.  I substituted white wine vinegar for the plain version, but don't know if that makes much difference.  I didn't find the soy sauce made it too salty at all, it was just right for an Asian style dish.  Will definitely make again.

Mmm-mmm!  I loved this recipe.  It may very well be my new favorite for grilled chicken.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and onion powder instead of onions.  I used 1/2 reduced sodium soy and 1/2 regular soy and marinaded skinless, boneless chicken breasts for  about 36 hours then cooked them on the grill, basting with some marinade I had set aside.  They were so tasty I had nothing but chicken for dinner!  LOL  My boys ages 4 and 5 and DH loved it too.  Can't wait to try it with beef.  Thanks!

This marinade was delicious!  I always have all of these ingredients at home, so it's very convenient.  I marinated about three hours and then grilled the chicken.  We used them in fajitas, which was almost a shame since you couldn't taste the chicken as well with all the other ingredients.  This one is a keeper!

I followed as directed....omitting the ginger.  I marinated boneless chicken breasts all day and then grilled on the Foreman.  They were great, very moist with good flavor.  My teen raved about how good they were!  Thanks!

We really enjoyed this marinade.  I only had time to marinate the chicken breasts (pounded) in it for 2 or 3 hours, but the flavor still penetrated well.  I'll use this recipe again for sure.

We liked this marinade! I've used this on chicken and beef. I used olive oil, fresh garlic, and more spice. GREAT!

While I really enjoyed this marinade (I used it on chicken), The Boy did not. I mentioned before that he's picky though. I'll be using this recipe again though ~ he can have canned soup. Thanks Jana!

My sweetie really liked the recipe. I used what I had on hand, apple cider vinegar instead of distilled white, and extra garlic, but we always use a lot of garlic.  The boneless chicken breasts grilled up moist and tasty.  Sweet and saucy.

This was pretty good, I don't know if it was the cut of the meat or what,(thin top sirloin) it was a bit dry and a little to much soy sauce flavor. I would try again with a little tinkering.

I let this marinade overnight.  It's tasty, just didn't have quite enough flavor for me, so I will make it again with hot red peppers.

This is a wonderful chicken marinade- I found it very easy to throw together, and everyone loved it.  I used 1/2 of a regular chopped onion instead of the green onion b/c I didn't have any on hand.  We used it to grill chicken strips, but my husband suggested using it some stir-fry!  Mmm mm can't wait to try it!

I've made  this several times with chicken breasts.  I've found that even after a couple hours, the meat absorbs the flavor.  I did substitute coconut aminos for today the soy sauce, as my husband is allergic to soy.  I cut way back on the pepper too.  It's delicious!  Thanks for the lovely recipe.

Fabulous.  I, like some others, used minced garlic instead of powdered, and instead of honey I used brown sugar and (real) maple syrup.   I marinated for about 8 hours on beef Chuck and made skewers.  I poured remaining marinade on finished skewers...Outstanding.  Whole family loved it, will do again, thanks for the recipe.

The marinade was delicious however I’m giving it four  stars is because it was slightly too sweet.

Not too bad for a simple marinade. Used it on chicken. It's a little strong on the soy sauce side for me. I added a little bit of herbs to it as well. Marinaded the chicken for 2 days, and at some point between day 1 and 2, the marinade started separating.

I made this as written, marinated for 6 hrs and used it on beef. I found it rather bland and thin. The only thing I tasted was a small amount of sweetness. Maybe I’ll try this with chicken and see how it ‘ll come  out. THAnks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent marinade. I used a vacuum box to speed up the process on chicken, onion and red pepper kebabs. 
I just wonder how long the used marinade will keeb in an air tight jar.

Excellent marinade that truly works with most meats. I’ve used it with chicken breast, pork chops, and flank steak so far. I worried that the ginger would make it taste like an Asian dish, but it didn’t. The flavors all blend together beautifully. 

I usually double the recipe and keep it on hand in the fridge by storing it in a mason jar. I don’t know how long it’ll stay good, we typically use it within a week or so. 

It never fails that there are critical reviews that aren’t even reviewing this recipe. One of my favorites is the one that changes just about everything before it says to feel free to add your own spices to the marinade. It’s very easy to submit your own recipe to this site. Next time you create something new, submit it as a separate recipe. Let’s leave the review section for reviews of the actual posted recipe. 

Sorry for the rant, it’s just frustrating when you search for a recipe and have to weed through the reviews to see what is actually being reviewed.

Definitely a keeper. The only Change I made was I used 3 fresh squeezed oranges in the marinade. Marinated for 4 hours which was perfect. Grilled on the grill and it has such great flavor and so much. Will definitely try with others meats and will be my go to marinade.

We really liked this, however, I felt like it needed less oil and probably also a little less honey. I was looking for a little healthier option, so will probably go with about 1/3 of the oil next time and maybe 2/3 of the honey.

I made this marinade early this afternoon and put it on chicken breasts. Hubby grilled them for dinner. Because of the honey in the recipe, there were a few little burnt edges but even those burnt parts were yummy and the meat was very tender and juicy. My husband's only complaint was that he would have liked a little more sauce. Maybe next time I can cook up a bit of the marinade because he's a real dipper!.

Great marinade! Used apple cider vinegar and bottled minced garlic. Also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Excellent!

Used this recipe for beef and it was delicious. Didn't have white wine vinegar so used cider vinegar instead and it came out delicious!

I added sweet Thai chili sauce, red pepper flakes, fish sauce, sesame seeds, and I used onion powder instead of onions in this marinade.  I cut sirloin very thin, marinated several hours, sauteed a pile of veggies, sauteed beef separately and quickly. I tossed all this with brown rice Thai noodles. Also sprinkled sliced almonds over all. I had cilantro on the side. Just yummy!

This was a really good marinade. I used it to make a stir fry beef dish and it was very flavorful. I will definitely make this again and try it with chicken. I love that all the ingredients are usually on hand.

This is my FAVORITE marinade! And Ive tried just about every marinade out there! It makes me want to eat chicken every day :-) No changes needed, but a few times I did use a garlic favored rice vinegar instead of the vinegar called for and it turned out just as delicious.

Take three small/medium size BONELESS chicken breasts and poke several holes THROUGH each piece BEFORE marinading. Other than using olive oil instead of vegetable oil, recipe instructions were followed. Overnight marinading. With this recipe, you can grill without worry of drying out meat--and get an awesome restaurant style juicy taste. Once off the grill and onto a serving dish, seal chicken in aluminium foil for 15-30 minutes. I serve chicken thinly sliced, with fettuccine Alfredo or makes great chicken sandwiches.

I used a very thick cut of beef which was definitely a mistake, however I cut holes in it so the marinade could penetrate more. I grilled the steak, and the marinade made the meat fairly flavorful.

We liked this marinade a lot. I've only used it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts so far. I followed the recipe except I substituted cider vinegar for the white vinegar as one reviewer recommended. The half breasts were large so I halved them before marinating.

There was something off about this, although I followed the recipe exactly.  I think it was the ginger powder (ground ginger).  Next time I'll put in some fresh ginger instead of the powder.  If I make it again for my rib-eyes, then I'll edit this with the results.

Beef or Chicken Marinade Haiku: "Made this as written. On chicken, for a salad. Good, but just not great." Halved recipe but kept ratio of ingredients and everything the same (marinaded chicken tenderloins for 3 hrs. b4 putting on George Foreman for lunch, and serving on a salad) but wasn't as thrilled w/ this recipe; I always seems to fall back on AR's "Pretty Chicken Marinade" which is similar, but in my opinion just tastier.

Finally had a chance to make this after finding it over a year ago.  We used thin sliced chicken breast, so cooking time was adjusted to 30 minutes.  Used all ingredients and it was AWESOME!  We put it on top of a salad with a little lite sesame dressing.  Yum!

I used this the other night on chicken thighs.  I used foil on the grill to protect them from sticking as Flankadank recommended.  I also used olive oil, low sodium soy, and blue agave, as it was what I had on hand as Jillian suggested.   Great marinade for chicken and I'm trying it on beef tonight.  Hubby said, "This is a keeper recipe!"

Awesome marinade! I made this marinade with chicken breasts yesterday. I used olive oil instead of veg. oil and everything else stayed the same. I grilled them in the George Foreman grill. Chicken was nice and moist. My daughter and I both loved it. Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

Tried this on beef and chicken... and the chicken I just made is SO good. I've only had one bite and immediately came here to tell all of you how scrumptious this is! Had it marinading for about 24 before throwing it in the oven.

I used this recipe on chicken and made cut the chicken up into pieces for chicken kabobs. I ended up freezing this for a later time and it turned out amazing. I would definitely recommend this.

Very tasty and aromatic marinade.  Much better than the too-salty store-bought versions. Used in on chicken for grilling. Big hit!

Had everything except green onions. Marinated 4 chicken breasts overnight then cooked them on the bbq. Delish! I've got a whole chicken to marinate again tonight, will get some green onions on my way home. Feeling feisty, may get some whole hot peppers too!!

Yuuuuummy!  I followed this exactly except I only had rice vinegar, so I used that.  It's amazing!  I had leftover marinade so spooned some with the scallions onto my slice up chicken. Delish! Thanks Jana Ritz! This will be my new standard marinade.

Tasted great in the bowl, but we couldn't taste it on the meat. I used it for a tri-tip so maybe that wasn't the best cut of meat to use for it. We'll definitely try it again on a different cut of meat.

By far, this has to be the best we have ever used! These are our favorite indredients. We made beef kabobs with veggies. This recipe is sooo flavorful that we just wanted to eat it up right out of the bowl! (minus the raw meat!) I just made one adjustment, instead of using all veg oil I used olive as well. We were just so pleased with this marinade. The beef came out so tender and juicy that no restaurant we have ever been to has been this good! I also used a different marinade recipe for the veggies and that turned out spectacular also. (sweet sauce for vegetables)Thanks for sharing and making our tummies happy!

Fantastic! I used it on skinless chicken breasts that I halved. I heeded the advice on too much soy, so I halfed the amount and switched it out with a sesame dressing I bought from Trader Joes. I also used fresh ginger, and a bit of sweet yellow onion that I pulverized in the food processor. Oil was 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 vegetable oil. Just great. Would also consider it for a salad dressing. Marinate as long as possible, up to a couple days. Five stars from me. Honey makes it.

Made this with chicken that was then broiled and it was ok, not great. I think it's probably much better paired with beef. Will try again with beef, won't be making it for chicken again.

I was VERY impressed with this recipes. I was skeptical, especially after I prepared the ingredients so I only marinated half of the chicken in this marinade. I am so disappointed that I didn't marinate all of the chicken in this delicious marinade!!! Used olive oil instead of vegetable...Try this, it's worth it!

Very good. I added some finely chopped sweet red bell peppers for a little kick. On its own, very good. You really can't go wrong with ginger-soy combination. Variations could include molasses for honey, or even dark corn syrup. Some worcestershire sauce for beef. even liquid smoke.

Excellent taste and is so simple since it uses things that I have around the kitchen already.  I doubled the recipe and only put in 1 1/2 of the honey 'cause it was a little too sweet.

A great marinade. I had to make a small substitution (dried chives instead of green onions). I used this on grilled chicken breasts, and it was fabulous.

This is great stuff and easy to make too! I didn't have any ground ginger so I cut up fresh slices. I marinated boneless chicken breast in it over night  - delicious! Next time I will try adding some hot peppers into it for a kick.

This was awsome on chicken.  My husband loved it.  Best chicken we've had in a while.  I used fresh minced onion  instead of green onions and fresh minced garlic instead of poweder and blended it real well.  It was great.

this was really tasty.  I didn't have any ginger or green onions (I used dried onions instead) and it was still really good.  I think this is a pretty flexible marinade.  I also broiled my chicken breast because the weather isn't grilling weather quite yet. I did it for about 15 minutes flipping the chicken after 5 minutes twice, and then about every minute after that.  turned out moist and oh so tasty.

This was ok. I was hoping it would help to tenderize the meat and it really didnt. The flavor was ok, nothing to brag about. I probably wont make this again.

This is an awesome marinade.  We marinated boneless skinless thighs for 2 hrs and then grilled and they were awesome.  The only change I made was that I didn't add ginger.  Next time I'll probably marinade for close to 4 hrs.  Definitely a keeper!

It's good, if you like bland. This has no kick or anything special. Just very muted flavors. My two and six year old loved it, and so did my husband, but he's notorious for preferring bland food. He doesn't even like salt and pepper, so you know it's tasteless if he liked it! I'm using the leftover chicken breasts to make barbeque, you won't be able to taste this marinade anyway! I it was just me, i'd give it a 3, but it's still edible, just not what I was expecting or looking for.

This a great standby. I've used it often on Chicken, never yet on steak but can imagine it's equally as great.

I usually use fresh pressed garlic and chopped red onions, along with diced ginger, but it turns out great everytime. 

Yummy!

This recipe was easy and the final product was awesome.  My chicken breasts were tender and tasted great.  I did cooked them in a pan on a med heat first then I transferred to the oven to finish cooking. I also did what other reviewer suggested and boiled down the marinade stirring often and then poured over the chicken.  It was awesome.  I served with brown rice.  Thanks!

I used this marinade for boneless chicken breasts and turkey drum sticks, both cooked outside on the grill. They both turned out great and I wouldn't change anything.

This was delicious! I marinaded mine for about 5 hours, and it was very flavorful. I drained and reserved the marinade, browned the meat with some veggies and added noodles for a quick lo mein. I poured the reserved marniade over it and tossed it all together! Everything was so flavorful! I will definately keep using this marniade!

This is a great, easy recipe--everyone else who's reviewed it has detailed the changes/substitutions---I don't think you can mess it up as long as you have the key flavors, soy, ginger, honey, garlic.  I've used it twice-- the first time I prepared it the night before and left the sirloin tips marinating---about 17 hours--- the flavor and the tenderness was outstanding!  Husband and guests were raving...no left overs!  The second time I made it I let the sirloin tips marinade only about an hour (quick grill meal after work) and it was still quite good but not like the first time.  It's worth having the forethought to prepare the meat the night before---

I used this recipe with a thick top sirloin - it turned out fantastic. I marinaded the meat for about 30 hours. I made two steaks, so I used the leftovers for steak sandwiches. Sooooooo good.

The only thing I changed was to use 1 clove of fresh minced garlic, instead of the powder.  I also halved the recipe for four chicken breasts.  It was delicious!  I might reserve some extra marinade next time prior to marinating, boil it down, and toss with steamed broccoli for a side dish.  yum!

Tried this recipe for the first time today.  Was having company over for a cook out and wanted to add something to the hamburgers and hot dogs.  Used it with beef cubes on skewers.  The meat was very tender and tasty and only marinaded the meat for 2 hours. Will definately make again...maybe on chicken.

so easy and so delish!  i used boneless chix breasts which i'm always apprehensive about grilling --as they have a tendency to dry out...but this marinade made them so moist.  i used fresh garlic and rice vinegar.  used leftover chix in a salad --- delicious also!

I used chicken breast with this. I refrigerated it for 6 hours. After grilling it, we thought that the chicken came out very moist. It had good flavor, but we weren't "wowed" but it.

I thought this did awesome on the chicken! I didn't care for it on the steak though.  My hubby seemed to like it on both and so did the kids. I also omitted the ginger and used minced onions instead of green.  I will use this again for sure.  SuPer EaSy!

This was an amazing marinade!  I didn't do this recipe justice.  The meat (I used stew meat) only marinated for about 15-20 minutes because I didn't have enough time, but it still tasted fantastic!  I can only imagine how it would taste with the proper amount of time to marinate.

My wife and I love this recipe.  We find it easier to mix the marinade in the blender.  We make shish kabobs with it (don't marinade the chicken as long as the beef) and pour the marinade over the onions (raost a little in the oven first) and red and yellow peppers.

Each time we make it people comment on the flavor and ask for the recipe - which I hand over, of course.

A winner.

Very good! I did replace the distilled white vinegar with cider vinegar. Also added some red pepper flakes as suggested by Jana to spice it up. Marinated the chicken overnight. This will become a regular in our house - thanks Jana!

Excellent flavor. I marinated some beef ribs for 36 hours then baked them in the marinade. My son said it was the best meat he'd ever had.  We also drizzled the excess marinade/drippings over potatoes and they were YUM!

I used a London Broil and marinated it for 9 hours. It was better then unmarinated meat but nothing special.  It probably works better with chicken.

Tried this with pork and beef over the weekend with our new grill, and it was not nearly as good.  I'm going to stick with just using it for chicken in the future.
This was excellent!  I used it for chicken and also marinated some zuchini and yellow squash sliced thin.  We grilled it all up after marinating for two hours.  My entire family ate everything.  No leftovers.  I did use 1 1/2 teaspoons of onion powder in place of the green onions.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I will definitely use this again.

This is an awesome marinade! Everyone ranted and raved about the flavor. I marinaded chicken breasts for kabobs for 24 hours. They were so tender and moist after cooking. I did however add some garlic pepper and extra honey. Thanks for the wonderful addition to the recipe book.

I found this a delightful marinade. I had to make a few substitutions but it was fantastic. I used fresh garlic instead of the powder, taragon vinegar since I didn't have white vinegar and dried onion since I didn't have the green onions on hand. I can't wait to try it on other things! Thanks.
