We loved this versatile recipe. The star of the show for me is the bbq sauce paired with the slightly chewy thicker pizza crust. We made half with ham and pineapple and half with chicken and green peppers. Cheddar cheese melted nicely over the entire pizza and we cooked it on the BBQ I just lightly coated one side of the crust with olive oil first and grilled it for a few minutes on high and then flipped it over and assembled the pizza. Thanks Molly will make it again and again

We enjoyed this recipe. I made one with traditional "brown" BBQ sauce and one with yellow BBQ sauce. Both were very good.
