Good consistance but the use of flour makes it taste like cake batter.  Didn't use it on my cake.

Very good frosting! The only issue seems to be if you make it on a day that has high humidity, it won't set up. Thank you.

This tasted like flour no matter how much vanilla I added, and was greasy and sloppy.

This frosting is amazing, but it can be a bit tricky. First, you don't need cream, milk works fine, actually better because you have to cook it longer to get it to thicken.  That's one of the keys. Make sure to cook the flour / milk mixture long enough so as not to have that raw flour taste. Then you must cool it COMPLETELY. (I set mine in a bowl of ice and stir it until it's cool although if you plan ahead, you can just let it cool on it's own. Cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin.) Second, cream the butter and sugar very well. I like a little more vanilla. You can use regular granulated sugar or powdered sugar. Powdered sugar will make a sweeter frosting and granulated sugar will take a little longer to get the sugar dissolved into the butter. Third, when you first combine the butter mixture and the flour mixture together it will look weird and lumpy. Keep whipping it. You have to use an electric mixer for this, preferably one with a whisk attachment. You eventually will end up with the lightest, fluffiest, butteriest (I made up that word) frosting ever and it will so be worth the time and effort.

I had and lost this recipe years ago. It is devine with cocoa powder added. I refrigerate the flour mixture to cool it down.
