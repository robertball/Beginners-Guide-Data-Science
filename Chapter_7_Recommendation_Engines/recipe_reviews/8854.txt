I'm new to the site and a little confused as to the rating system. from what I can see, out of 50 reviews, 35 of them, or 70%, are for a DIFFERENT RECIPE that vaguely resembles the one that is published. Also, if you read the ones that actually rate this recipe, AS WRITTEN, it ends up getting about 2 3/4 stars. I'm glad that people get to rate their own creations (most of which are 5's. What a shock ;-)), but this rating system is highly suspect, especially when I'm looking for good, nutritious food to feed my gang.
Rate me disappointed!

This recipe was great!  I made some additions:  1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup cheese extra for the filling, marjoram, Mrs. Dash Table Blend, garlic powder, lemon garlic, 1/2 cup of onions that I sauteed with the chicken.  I steamed the broccoli. Once chicken and broccoli were done, I mixed EVERYTHING together, poured in 8 x 8 baking dish.  I sprinkled cheese (however much you want)on top and doubled the bread crumb mixture.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of broccoli.  This was soooooo good!

Well, after giving this recipe a second chance...I LOVED IT.  Per previous reviews, I added dashes of lemon pepper seasoning, season salt and a dash of garlic powder while coooking the chicken.  I also added a little more broccoli and a little more bread crumbs than what the recipe calls for.  I'm glad I didn't give up on this one, it was worth it.  Next time, I'm going to have to double the recipe so that everyone gets their fill. This recipe is worth trying...with some minor modifications.  SOOO cheesy and broccoli! YUM!

This was very good after I made some changes based on other reviews.  I steamed a 14 oz. bag of frozen broccoli florets instead of fresh.  My chicken was well seasoned when I boiled it.  I used the 98% FF soup. I added about 1/2+ cup sour cream, chicken boullion granules, salt, pepper, garlic powder.  I put at least 1/2 cup cheese in the casserole itself then another 1/2 cup on top.  I ended up just stirring the broccoli, chicken, cheese and soup mixture all up together before putting it in the dish.  I used buttered Ritz crackers on top.  It was yummy and still very easy and fast since I keep chopped, cooked chicken in the freezer all the time.  I'll make it again!!

I have to double this recipe each time I make it so we can have seconds, and leftovers!  This is the only way I can get my 17 month old son to eat broccoli.  I've never tried this with cream of broccoli soup, but use cream of mushroom instead.  I mix the soup, milk, black pepper, 1/2 tsp corriander, and 1 tsp garlic powder in a large bowl.  Then throw in the chicken, broccoli and some cheese to coat.  I use more chicken and cheese than called for, use crushed butter crackers instead of bread crumbs, and cook in a 9x13 dish. Thanks Terry!!!!

I definitely wanted to alter this recipe to add more flavor, because as-is, it looked like it was missing a lot.  I used Campbell's Chicken with Herbs soup intead of Cream of Broccoli, and added about 1/2 cup (maybe a little more) of sour cream, about a tablespoon of Mrs. Dash Original, about a tablespoon of McCormick Lemon & Herb Seasoning and about a teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  Per another review, I also added cheddar to the sauce and doubled the bread crumb mixture.  I served it over rice.  PERFECT!  Will make again and again!

This was a good place to start, but as written very bland. Made a quick fix to the sauce by adding white wine, lite mayo, lite sour cream, curry, garlic and onion powders and black pepper. Topped with fresh buttered bread crumbs and some parm. True comfort food and thanks!

Yummmmmm this is so delicious!!! I pan sauteed the chicken (which I seasoned with garlic powder, lemon pepper, and black pepper) with a whole onion in some olive oil. Once the onions caramelized and the chicken began to brown, I added my frozen broccoli to the skillet, reduced the heat and covered to let the veggies steam. After mixing together the soup and milk, I just poured it directly into the skillet, as well as the cheese. Once I let all of those flavors steep for a while, I put it all into a baking dish, topped with bread crumbs and then baked uncovered. Yep. This one's a keeper for life!!

Update:  You can use Healthy Request Soups & 2% milk cheeses as a great alternative.  This recipe is low fat/cal/carb as it is... but these changes are even better.  I noticed no change in taste.  Oh, and I made this today without baking it & have it in my frig for dinner later in the week. It's a great make-ahead dinner that bakes off beautifully. This is such a basic recipe, there are so many ways to enhance it depending on your tastes.  I add 2 tbsp of curry (and I don't even LIKE curry) and use mayo instead of the milk.  It's a great dish served over rice, my mother has made it for years and it's always been a family favorite.  You can use frozen broccoli in a pinch, or freshly steamed is even better.  As for the soup... I use whatever flavor I have in my cupboard.

Loved it! I made it a second time and added more broccoli and the 1/2 cup sour cream and cheese as a another emember suggested and enjoyed it even more. Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe.  I have made Chicken Divan before that require Mayo, and it was horrible. This meal was filling and delicious, without the overpowering taste of Mayo (we really hate mayo). My 2 kids (4yo and 11 month old) devoured this meal.  Absolutely delicious. This is the perfect last minute meal. I also tweaked this recipe: I used 1 pound package of frozen broccoli and cooked it according to the package. For the Chicken I seasoned it with Lemon Pepper Seasoning. I put both in an 8x8 baking dish. For the soup mixture, I used part milk and part sour cream.  I also added 1/4tsp Thyme, and a dash of garlic powder.  I then..combined the chicken, broccoli and soup...tossing it well.  then topped it with cheese and the breadcrumb mixture. The breadcrumbs were too mushy for me and I ended up using 1/4 cup bread crumbs to the 1 T melted butter. I also heated it for 20 minutes at 375 degrees.

I really liked this and will do it again.  However  I would like to make a comment.  Why not review the recipe as it is presented instead of making up a new recipe with all your own additions and then posting a review of that?  Honestly, if you want to create a recipe of your own do so, but please respect the author of the original.  I'm just sayin'

I love this recipe!! It is exactly what I have been looking for.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I added lots more cheese and cooked the broccoli longer (My son likes mushy broccoli...don't ask) This will be a regular on our menu!  Thank you!

This was my favorite dish that my mother, who passed away when I was 17, ever used to make for us. I never could find her recipe! So, this one looked promising, but when I first made it, following this recipe exactly, it turned out a little bland (reason for the 3 star rating). I took the advice of some other reviewers and tried this again, but cooked the chicken with minced garlic, generous garlic salt, rather than garlic powder, and fresh cracked pepper. Delicious! The soup I chose was Cream of Chicken and Mushroom (but I think most cooking soups would work...I would, however, avoid the Cream of Broccoli and vouch for something more flavorful.) and I mixed that with the milk and a little less than 1/3 C sour cream, as well as 1/2 cup cheese. I then sprinkled a bit more cracked pepper on top of the mixture, followed by a bit more cheese, and was not shy at all with the breadcrumbs (use Parmesan!), which I recommend a double dose of! This turned out FANTASTIC...just like my mom's - along with a few easily made changes, this is a great dish worth trying. I will double the recipe next time. Wish I had more leftovers!

This recipe turned out really well. I served it for dinner at my boyfriend's parents house and got a lot of compliments! I combined a couple of the recipes for chicken divan but used this one (well, more the reviews for this one) as a base. Here was my final recipe:

I doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9x13 baking dish at 400 for about 20 minutes.

Instead of fresh broccoli, I used 2 bags of frozen broccoli florets. 
I cooked 6 smaller chicken breasts in bite size pieces with garlic powder, paprika, and a little bit of salt.
I used 2 cans of condensed cream of chicken soup
2/3 c milk + 1 c sour cream
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (doubled for the bigger size but also double what the recipe called for!)
1 tsp lemon juice
2 tsp garlic powder

Then for the crumb topping I used a bout 1/3 c bread crumbs & then filled up to the 1/2 c mark with parmesan cheese, sprinkled some extra garlic powder into the topping and spread that over the top. I used the butter spray on top but melted butter mixed in would have been just as good.

There was a LOT of filling, but it was so good everyone was using it on the other side dishes. It was very good served over white rice to soak in some of the extra filling.

Made this last night, and it was a hit.  I can get my 2 year old to eat broccoli just about always, but surprisingly it's the Chicken I have a hard time getting her to eat.  She couldn't finish this fast enough.  :-)  I added some fresh garlic to the chicken when I cooked it up, and I also added pepper, poultry seasoning, and a cajan spice combo I had to the chicken as well.  I added a pinch of salt, pepper, garlic powder (love garlic in our family) and some spike to the brocoli before steaming it.  I didn't have any cream of broccoli, so I used cream of mushroom, and we didn't have any bread crumbs, so I decided to crumble up a piece of left over corn bread as a substatute.  IT WAS AWESOME!!  I would suggest doubling the cheese and I will definetly double the corn bread topping too.  :-)  It was great!  Thank you!!!!!

Really loved this recipe!  I have made it several times.  Followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was wonderful.  Since there was quite a bit of sauce, the second time I made it I decided to make it into a casserole and added 8 oz of egg noodles, increased the milk to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the mix and put it in a casserole dish and cooked at 350 for 20 min.  I've also subed ham (cubed) for the chicken and made ham, noodle, broccoli casserole!  Kids love it.

This is my go-to recipe when my evening is running late and I still have to make dinner.  I cook the chicken with some rosemary and thyme or lemon pepper or any herb/spice that hits my fancy.  The chicken needs a little something more than just being cooked.  I normally steam my broccoli in the microwave as opposed to boiling it.  I top off the dish with colby jack or mozzarella & freshly grated parmesan and panko bread crumbs.  My boyfriend loves this dish and will gobble up 3/4 of the recipe on his own :)

This recipe is great.  I did make some modifications as others suggested.  I steamed the broccoli, added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup onion, additional 1/2 cup shredded cheese, and garlic powder. I had a can of Tyson chicken and used that so I didn't have to cook the chicken (frozen anyway).  I mixed all the ingredients together and put in a 8x8 glass pan.  I had some Ritz crackers and used that for the topping with the butter mixed with it. It is fantastic and I will make again.

This is such a great recipe, in the respect that it is so easy to customize. Make it first, as written and then play with it going forward. Whether you use cream of broccoli or cream of chicken soup, whether you use fresh or frozen broccoli, milk instead of sour cream...it is still really good. The most important thing to do with this is to season all of your layers with what ever spices your family likes. It is a little bland as written, but I think that is on purpose, because you can use your spice rack accordingly. I seasoned with lemon pepper, seasoned salt (from Penzey's), and a little cajun spice. Also, I used a really good sharp cheddar and ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.

This was very good-and I usually don't like things made with condensed soup.  It was super fast and easy which I appreciated.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added salt, pepper, garlic powder, sauteed onions, and substituted the bread crumbs for Ritz crackers.  I also added a splash of red wine due to my own experience with cream soups.  Next time I will add some earthy mushrooms...more for the texture than anything.  My family positively devoured this.  My oldest asked for seconds (never happens) and my youngest got all the way to FOURTHS if that says anything about how good it is.

Why oh why haven't I written a review sooner? I make this probably once a month. I do make a few changes (just to the preference of my fam), and here they are: 1) I use either condensed cream of celery, or condensed cheddar cheese. It's already pretty broccoli-y, 2) DEFINITELY add some cooked penne pasta...it makes it so. much. better. 3) add spices for sure - my fam likes it spicy, so I add quite a few shakes of Franks or Sriracha, 4) top with grated parmesan cheese. SUPER fast and delicious recipe! Thanks for submitting :)

This dish was yummy. Steamed the broccoli and cut up a store-bought rotisserie chicken. Added sauteed onion and garlic, then threw in 1/2 teas. lemon pepper and 1/2 cup light sour cream as suggested. Used crushed potato chips instead of bread crumbs and Colby cheese instead of cheddar. Will make again.

This was very good and comforting. My family really enjoyed it. I would give it a 4.5 just because I wanted more sauce but that's easily fixed. I added some spices my family likes and instead of bread crumbs- french fried onions. Served with hot buttered Jasmine rice.
Thanks for sharing your recipe!

We love this and I make it often because it's such a family pleaser (yes all my guys love broccoli)... I make my own cream soup (AR's -Cream of soup) because of sensitvity to MSG but it's awesome! I add one tsp. of curry powder to my chicken sauce for a little Indian flare!  We serve it over white rice.  :)

With a few modifications, this is a five star dish. Added sour cream and shredded mexican cheese blend to the soup mixture- only had cream of chicken on hand. Omitted the cheese from the top. Served over rice- was a big hit with the family- everyone had seconds! great way to use leftover rotisserie chicken.

It's pretty hard to mess up Chicken Divan, but the thing I like about this recipe is that it uses cream of broccoli soup instead of other soups.  This I had never tried before and it was delicious!  I had to spice up my chicken so I added garlic powder, salt, pepper and a pinch of curry powder as I sauteed it in olive oil.  I added more fresh broccoli than the recipe calls for because that's my favorite part, and decided to bake bisquits on top instead of bread crumbs.  To do this I made up a batch of bisuit dough, cooked up the chicken divan in the oven for about 10 minutes, then as it was hot and bubbly, I took it out real quick, plopped some dough on top and stuck it back in the oven for another 11-15 minutes.  The bisquits turned out perfect, and weren't doughy at all!  I know the trick is to put it in once the chicken divan is hot and bubbly so it can kind-of cook the bottom of the bisquits.  YUM!

Add 1/2 cup sour cream to soup mixture and put garlic powder on the chicken. Substitute frozen broccoli for ease. Can use panko for the topping, but cover first and uncover the last 5 minutes.

This is my favorite "I'm really too tired to cook, but don't feel like takeout" recipe. Quick, easy and tastes great! I use stuffing mix on the top instead of the breadcrumbs.  Thanks!

Great and easy recipe but I did add a few ingredients to make it more tasty.  I used cream of mushroom soup mixed with 1/3 cup mayonnaise and 1/2 tsp curry.  Then I used a box of chicken stove top stuffing  on top of the cheddar cheese.  Not the healthiest recipe but very yummy!

This was ok but not that good.  It was so obvious that a can of soup was used.  Maybe good receipe for a biginner cook or someone who doen't have much time to cook.  My family didn't really care...

I did change this quite a bit as per other reviewers' suggestions, but it's a good base as written.  I added sour cream, onion powder, granulated garlic, lemon pepper, used leftover rotisserie chicken (which already has good seasoned flavor), more chicken, more soup (1/2 can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom in addition to the cream of broccoli), more milk to thin it a bit, and the biggest change of all -  cooked egg noodles, so it became a one-dish meal.  For the topping I used the butter/seasoned bread crumb topping and added grated parmesan, as I do for mac-n-cheese.  Makes a much tastier topping.  My 8 year old ate this with much less prodding than I usually have to do!

This recipe has had great reviews, but it just didn't work for us.  At 15 minutes, it hadn't even started to brown, so I had to cook it quite a bit longer to get something that even looked appealing.  The broccoli seemed disproportionate to the chicken...there was just too much broccoli IMO.  I drained the broccoli well, but it continued to release water while baking, so I would say I poured off at least another cup of liquid from the baking dish.  It did not have the creamy consistency that I expected.  I always prepare a recipe the way it's written the first time, but I see most of the reviewers made many changes.  It just may be a matter of taste preference on our part, but I don't think this is worth trying to tweak for us.

Made this last night as directed.  I thought it was okay but my family sure did not think it was a keeper.  :-(  Maybe I'll try again taking other reviewers suggestions of adding sour cream, etc.  Thank you anyway!

I ate a dish like this before so I decided to try to make it myself. I was disappointed because it was flavorless and runny. Next time I will have to add more seasonings and mix some extra cheese into the casserole itself instead of just on top. It also needs more breadcrumb topping.

Excellent comfort food.  I use 2 chicken breasts, and season them while cooking -- I like Montreal garlic chicken seasoning--.  I use one bunch of fresh broccoli, also seasoned.  I serve it over rice, and it is excellent stick-to-your-ribs food.

Tried this tonight, and it was fabulous. I changed it a little, using cream of chicken soup and adding some salt, garlic, and onion powder in the bread crumbs. I also pan-cooked the chicken in grapeseed oil with salt and pepper. Just the two of us almost demolished the entire thing, and we most decidedly WILL be eating this again. VERY tasty.

It had a little flavor but not enough very bland.

I added a can of Nacho Cheese Soup along with with the Cream of Broccoli soup,  Dash of garlic powder, onion powder. 4oz soft cream cheese and a can of Rottel (drained) for some extra zing.  And I added some extra sharp cheddar added to the soup mixes.

It was great when adjusted as such.  I though the Rottel might overpower the original dish but it did not as all.  Husband loved it.

Pretty tasty. I only gave 4 stars because I used leftover chicken. My husband won't eat broccoli so I put a can of mixed vegetables on one half and leftover broccoli on the other half. A quick and easy meal when you don't have a lot of time and you want to use up leftovers.

Very versatile recipe... Its very kids friendly but at the same time has a very sophisticated taste for adults. This is great for a quick meal, a meal to bring to someone, a church potluck, or just a weeknight dinner. I baked mine in a 9x13 in glass pan and it came out perfect. The only other thing i did different was add a little more milk to the soup to make the sauce go further since i put it into a bigger pan.

Tasty, but I made a couple of changes. I didn't have cream of broccoli soup in the house, so I used a cream of cheddar. It has more of a kick, so I decided to throw some green onion in as well. I also used garlic salt as I cooked the chicken.

my family absolutely loved this recipe! the flavors were really great. I used condensed cream of broccoli with cheese soup. I did not find just cream of broccoli without the cheese. the only thing i would do different next time is steam the broccoli instead of boiling it, because even thought i strained it, my casserole was still watery on the bottom.

Great recipe-- We added about 1.5 cups of rice to the recipe. Cook the rice and then put it in a casserole dish before the broccoli.... absorbs the flavor and slightly reduces the richness of the dish--- allowing for more servings and a slightly healthier meal!

Oh I loved this. Didn't change a thing....but next time I might add more breadcrumbs because they were soooo good. There are not many dishes that are better the next day....but this one is!! UPDATE: Ok so I made this again today but changed a few things. Instead of broccoli I used one can of green beans, one can of corn and one can of sweet peas. Everything else I kept the same but put a ton more breadcrumbs on top. It's perfect as written but it's also a good base recipe as well. Oh the possibilities.........

Absolutely excellent! I will definitely fix this one over and over again. It was universally loved by everyone who tried it. I did follow the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and added half a diced onion with the chicken while it cooked, half a cup of sour cream and an additional half cup of cheese to the sauce. Yummmm!!!

This was good and very easy if you have pre-cooked chicken.  As written, I'm giving five stars, but I did take the advice of other reviewers and spice it up with garlic powder, lemon pepper, onion powder and seasoned salt and that added some good flavor.  I will make this again.

I thought this was a great recipe.  We used cream of mushroom since we couldn't find cream of broccoli and added a little Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning to the breadcrumbs.  All we had to add was buttered wheat rolls and it made a delicious meal.

As with MOST recipes on this site (and others) I am appalled at the number of people who rate the recipe when they completely changed it from the original. We don't even know if the recipe is good or not because usually the changes were so drastic the original is completely obliterated. Why not just post your OWN recipe and let people rate it? ...oh because it will get changed to something else too!  So, my suggestion is: TRY the recipe as it's posted here THEN rate it. That is the ONLY way the rest of us who haven't tried it will know if it is worth the trouble.

I followed another reviewer and added sour cream and seasonings and used cream of chicken and mixed it altogether. Also doubled butter and bread crumbs. Came out so yummy

Following some of the other reviews I steamed the broccoli then cooked cut up chicken in garlic powder, poultry seasoning and roasted garlic seasoning (what I had on hand). I didn’t have any cream soups available – so made rue, added chicken billion powder, made a gravy with milk and almond milk – added a little sharp cheddar cheese too. Then combined chicken and broccoli to the sauce – put in a baking dish – topped with shredded cheddar and bread crumbs (did not add butter to bread crumbs – we don’t need extra calories!) baked at 350 for 10 minutes – this took a little less than an hour from beginning to end. My picky husband had two platefuls!

As other people have mentioned, this is a great base - here are the changes I made.  I used a condensed soup substitute recipe to control sodium, I used 1/2 lb broccoli and 1/2 lb cut red and yellow peppers for some colour, I added thyme to the sauce for flavour, and I added 1/2 cup grated cheddar to the sauce as well.  I also left off the crumbs, as my family is not keen on that.  I baked at 400F for 1/2 hour and it turned out great - even the fussy 5 year old ate it.

We liked this but found there was a fair amount of liquid in the bottom of the dish.  It may be due to an off brand of soup we had on hand. Followed another reviewers suggestion and used panko crumbs and some crushed french fried onions on top.  Delish! It's worth another try.

I give my rendition a 5 star.  I omitted the butter & crumbs.  I added 1/2 c. sour cream, garlic salt, ritz crackers, doubled the cheese, cream of chicken soup instead of broccoli.  Very good!

Very basic recipe.  I felt that it needed some more seasonings--especially the chicken.  I will make again but I will probably spice it up a bit.

I cooked 2 chicken breast steaks along with some sauteed onion and garlic, then chopped it up. I also used almond milk and didn't bother to mix the bread crumbs and butter before putting on top. Otherwise, I followed the recipe - very delicious!

My grocery store didn't carry Cream of Broccoli so I went with the Campbell's Broccoli soup instead. I normally make this recipe with 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom and it was a little drier than my normal recipe but still tasty. I could say to maybe use 1.5-2 cans of the soup + milk mixture if you want it more casserole-y.

for a healthier (lower calorie & fat) version I eliminate the bread crumbs and cheese and my family likes it just the same. A classic, easy dinner.

Uh.... well, see I have been telling my wife that some things need to be on hand like basil, beer and cream based soup. But when I went to try this recipe there was no soup in the house... and very little milk. Instead, I substituted a jar of Alfredo sauce and it turned out rather well. I sauteed the chicken pieces in butter with some garlic salt, a sprinkle of cayenne for a subtle nip, Montreal seasoning and those little skinny onion looking things. The fresh broccoli I steamed in the microwave. Instead of cracker crumbs I used the French onions and spread that over the cheddar. All in all it was surprisingly good. I had thought the Alfredo would be too dominant but when all was said and done the flavors were well balanced. Now I call it ABCD for Alfredo Broccoli Chicken Divan. I can't give it less than 5 stars since I didn't follow the recipe.... exactly.

Excellent! I followed the advice of other reviewers as well as my own inclinations. I pretty much doubled the recipe, but disproportionately increased the amount of broccoli and chicken because I knew we wanted a more hearty dish. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of skim milk to add some depth/flavor as well as increase the protein content (zero fat). I omit the butter altogether because I did not find it necessary. As others suggested, I added some seasoning to the chicken (I boiled it and sprinkled some Cookie's brand seasoning on after I drained the chicken). I used rice a roni wild grain rice pilaf on the bottom, and assembled it as instructed. I also added some Parmesan cheese to the top (and mixed cheddar both in with the soup as well as on top as suggested). In addition to seasoned Italian bread crumbs, I crunched up some whole wheat saltines in a bag to give the topping a little more crunch. We enjoyed every bite and will definitely make this again!

So yummy, what a great recipe. I used gluten free cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of broccoli. I also used gluten free bread crumbs. I followed Patty's suggestions (look under most helpful reviews) and I mixed everything together and put into the baking dish. Awesome dish!

I gave it 4 stars because I didn't think the sauce was enough for this recipe, so I added a can of table cream, a little more milk and cheese. Delicious! My husband said it was the best chicken meal I had ever made!

This recipe was great, my 1 year old who is going through the pick phase even ate it. I cooked closer to 2.5 cups of chicken and used frozen broccoli that I steamed. I also used Cream of Chicken soup. It worked out great. The only thing I had issue with was the bread crumb topping - it seemed to be too little and too paste-like. Next time I will either make more bread crumb topping or decrease the amount of butter mixed with the bread crumbs.

My Dh did not care for this at all.  And my kids weren't thrilled with it either.  I thought it was edible but not great.  Then my MIL came over the next day and sampled the almost untouched casserole in the fridge and she raved about it.  She thought it was absolutely delicious.  (This from a woman who makes everything from scratch, and yet I never see her eat anything but yogurt and fruit. So that she liked it was particularly noteworthy!) I gave the rest of the leftovers to my mom & dad and they also thought it was pretty good.  Therefore three stars because while I wasn't a fan, some that tried it were. YMMV!

Great recipe I made pretty much as written except added some onion and garlic to chicken while it was cooking and also added some fat free cream cheese to the cream of broccoli soup which was good except I think that I added a bit to much of the cream cheese made the recipe a little rich otherwise very good will make this again..

Good recipe.  If you want to add a little more flavor ... add a tablespoon of curry powder to the soup and milk mixture. I also add the cheese into that mixture.  Season the chicken with lemon pepper.

LOVED IT with a little alteration. THIS IS THE RECIPE I WAS LOOKING FOR!!!! Easy, fast, healthy, economical, and Delicious. I read the other comments so I altered it slightly. I added a tablespoon Parmasan cheese and  to the soup (Campbell's FAT FREE brocolli cheese that has nearly identical recipe on label)milk, and for the chicken I cooked two chicken breasts with 2 tablespoons chopped green pepper and some seasoning salt. I mixed half of the cheese in with the brocolli and chicken and mixed it all together. I also added one fourth cup Cooked instant Rice  and ONE SLIGHTLY BEATEN EGG to milk/soup mixture because  I was afraid I would end up with a runny soupy mess without these additions and my husband HATES sauces. It was a big hit. My husband who hates veggies and trying new things loved it. I had three helpings. I will definately use this again. I tried but couldn't find a chicken recipe I liked.

This was a great recipe.  I seasoned 4 chicken breasts with garlic salt and baked them at 350 for about 40 mins to start with.  Also, I didn't have bread crumbs, so I toasted some bread and crumbled it into the melted butter.  It turned out GREAT!  Husband RAVED and baby liked it too.  Thanks for sharing!

I ate it, but I was the only one. The cream of broccoli was too much. It may be better with cream of celery or cream of chicken. I'll give that a try next time.

This is a really good recipe.  I browned cubed chicken breasts with some onion and celery and added fresh mushroom at the very end of the browning time.  I used fresh buttered bread crumbs instead of dried bread crumbs as well as the cream of chicken soup instead of cream of broccoli.  Very yummy, can't wait to make it again.

This recipe gets 5 stars from me (and I don't hand them out easily!) because not only is this dish really delicious, it's reasonably healthy and super quick to make.  I cooked 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts with some seasoned salt and used that.  I also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce to my sauce .  The only change I will make next time is to add 1/2 cup milk (instead of 1/3) as I found the sauce a little too thick.  All in all, a really good, satisfying meal.

I used cream of potato soup since that's all I had on hand. I added an 8oz. block of softened cream cheese to the soup/milk mixture. I sprinkled some salt, pepper and chicken flavor instant bouillon (to taste) on the top instead of the bread crumbs.I have to say, this dish was exceptional! My kids loved it.  Next time I'll double the recipe so we can have leftovers.

I added some garlic salt and crushed red pepper and used cream of chicken instead of cream of brocolli.  I also added 2 more T of bread crumbs to the melted butter.  This recipe was really great.  I will definately make this again.

This recipe is awesome, I would highly recommend it because it's so quick and easy to make.  1.5 cups of cooked chicken turns out to be about 2 chicken breasts and for a pound of broccoli I used one big bunch from the grocery store.  The only change I made is that I added about 3T of breadcrumbs instead of one to give it a little more topping.  This recipe is not soggy whatsoever, it's very delicious

My husband LOVES this recipe, but I did change up things a little, it was a little too runny for us.
Instead of milk I used mayo, thickens it. I also used frozen broccoli (saves time) and I added almost a TSP of curry. If you're not a big broccoli fan like me, then you can use cream of chicken soup instead. 
Serve OVER stuffing and it's great!

This is SO easy!  You can make it early in the day and keep it in the fridge until ready to make!  We like to use more than the suggested amount of bread crumbs so that the entire top has a tiny bit of crunch! Tastes great!

Yummy, yummy.  This was very easy and everyone enjoyed it.  I didn't have cream of broccoli, so I substituted cream of celery and added some cheddar cheese soup.  It was delicious comfort food, served with rice.

As written it is bland and just boring. Adding sour cream to the soup mixture (about 8oz) along with some garlic and lots of pepper and subbing the bread crumbs for dried stuffing, it was fantastic. I also used swiss cheese instead. Everyone rating it 5 stars but making additions is ridiculous. Rate the recipe how it is listed and then add your tweaks. Don't rate your recipe. So as-is, it's bland. Won't make again.

We really enjoyed this! But I did add a 1/2 cup of sour cream, garlic powder, onion powder and poultry seasoning to the sauce. I also mixed the sauce with the chicken before adding it so my 9x9. As long as you have the chicken cooked ahead of time, it a super fast dish to make on a week night!

My 5 star rating comes from a mix of the original base recipe and what reviews suggested. First can I say my family LOVED this recipe. But we made a few changes..
1. Cooked chicken with chopped onions and seasonings (lemon pepper, garlic salt, etc)
2. Steamed broccoli (used frozen)
2.We mixed all called for ingrediants together in a bowl once everything was cooked, also adding 1/2 cup of mild shredded cheddar cheese and 1 cup of flavored stuffing mix (stove top), then stirred again and dumped into 8x8 pan.
3. Once in pan we smoothed it out using the back of the spoon and topped with cheese and then italian herb breadcrumbs. Our very last step was to drizzle melted butter over the breadcrumbs and then on its way to the oven it went.
Loved the slightly crunchy topping when it was finished and this was far from bland with my additions to flavor. Also please note my husband woke up the next morning and ate it for breakfast, so it must have been good.

My family loved it.  My 6 year old is very picky, but he ate every bite.  I boiled the broccoli with a chicken bouillon cube and a little garlic seasoning to add a little flavor, and topped with more cheese when it came out of the oven.  Definitely making this again.  Add homemade garlic cheddar biscuits and you will eat every bite.

I made this for dinner tonight and thought it was OK and not really repeat worthy. 3 stars at best.  My husband and son thought it was delicious.  Definitely needs more cheese and more seasoning (which I added). I will make this again for them but only when I'm not really hungry. should mention,  I keep cooked chicken on hand for using in recipes so this was EXTREMELY easy and quick to prepare.

This was very good. I did do a few mods to my liking. I added about 1 1/4 cup milk, a splash of sherry, pepper, cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Also, to thicken the soup mixture i added about 1/2 cup parm cheese. So yummy!!!

I made 3 tiny changes so that it would resemble an old friends recipe I once tried, frozen instead of fresh broccoli , cream of chicken soup in place of the cream of broccoli ( I love that rich creamy chicken flavor for comfort foods), and I used crushed ritz crackers in place of bread crumbs for another layer of richness. A small bowlful of this dish goes a long way as it is definitely a rich, filling dish. Pretty sure I ended up using about twice as much milk also to make sure it was super creamy =) Yummy!

YUM!  Since I totally forgot to thaw the frozen chicken, I cooked the chicken in the crockpot (low setting) combined with the cream of mushroom soup.  I added the broccoli to the mix for the last 20 minutes of cooking time, then combined everything (had to add another can of cream of mushroom soup along with the milk - it did thin out quite a bit) and baked it in the oven for 15 minutes.  It was fantastic!

I am currently 23 and a novice cook. This took 30 minutes to make and was so easy! really can't screw up unless it catches on fire. tastes very good. I used cream of mushroom because i didn't have creme of broccoli. Plenty of room in this dish to improvise or modify. great dish!!

I loved this followed recipe to the T except I used some leftover broccoli cheddar soup in place of the cream of broccoli.

When I say we love this dish, its an understatement. I replace the broccoli soup for cream of chicken and add a little sour cream. Its amazing and I love it!

I made this casserole for my husband one night (he loves broccoli) and it was a huge hit! Admittedly, I changed up the recipe a bit - Instead of condensed cream of broccoli soup, I added 1 can cream of chicken soup (what I had in my pantry), ½ block (4 oz.) cream cheese, ½ finely diced sweet yellow onion to the mixture with the chicken and broccoli, and topped it with Italian style panko bread crumbs for a different texture. Hubs said it was the best broccoli casserole he's ever had - thanks for posting this winner of a recipe!

This is awesome.  A great casserole without all the high carb noodles, and it's not too cheesy.  It's perfect.  I used cream of celery soup, and it was great (probably better than cr. of broccoli).  I also substituted the Quorn( meatless chicken chunks) for the chicken!  So I made a vegetarian dish that tasted like  real chicken!

Made this tonight and it was really good! I did use more bread crumbs than called for, and mixed a little more cheese in with the broccoli and chicken. I do agree that it could use a little more seasoning, and I think I may try cream of chicken soup next time instead. But a great recipe to build on to suit your personal taste!

Great recipe! We altered for more veggies/taste & for larger portion. First we sauteed about 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts cubed, 3 garlic cloves minced, 1/2 medium red onion diced, 1 1/2 c frozen corn, 3 c sliced portabello mushrooms, white pepper, seasoned salt together. Then added 1 1/2 lbs of frozen broccoli that we steamed to sautee a few min. Put sautee mix into 9x13 pan. In a separate bowl, mixed 2 cans of condensed fat free cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 c light sour cream, 3/4 c skim milk, 1 c shredded mild cheddar cheese & poured over sautee mix. In a separate bowl, melted 1/3 stick butter w/cornbread stuffing & added italian seasoning - mixed all together. Layered on top of dish & added one last layer of shredded mild cheddar cheese. Baked for 20 min at 450.

THis was good. My husband isn't a casserole guy- but said "for a casserole, it's good." and said I could make it again! ; ) I added a bit of cooked rice, as I just had leftovers... the recipe would be flexible. also used cream of mushroom as was all i had- and still was good.

Good but way too bland if you follow the original recipe. Needs some spices/more flavor. I added a ton of garlic and more cheese and skipped the bread crumbs (only because I forgot to add them and realized about half way through the cooking time). I used frozen broccoli (cooked) and it worked well.

I make something similar but use half broccoli and half cauliflower.  I combine the juice of one lemon with 3/4 cup mayo,  1 can Cream of Chicken soup , 1 Can Cream of Mushroom soup, undiluted.  I use 2-1/2 cups cubed chicken & cook in oil in lg pot, then add 1/4 cup white wine to deglaze, then add soup mixture & veggies. I put the cauliflower & broccoli florets in raw, but there's enuf sauce to cover them & cook for 1/2 hr - 45 min. in 13x9 casserole.  I add cheese the last 5 min., serve over rice.

Good starting recipe. I think it needs some tweaking though. I cubed chicken breasts and tossed in salt, pepper, and lemon pepper seasoning. I sauteed in a tb of oil. I cooked the broccoli on the stove then drained. I mixed a can of cream of mushroom, 1/3 cup milk and a couple sprinkles of pepper. I put the broccoli chicken together with the soup mixture then added about a half of a cup or a little more of shredded cheddar. Then I coated the top with a good amount of cheddar cheese and topped with about a quarter cup of crushed ritz cracker. IT was so delicious! I couldn't stop eating it. My husband loved it too.

This is good as written, but even better if you do one can of cream of broccoli, as well as one can of cream of chicken.  Also, I add in chopped cooked carrot and diced red peppers for more veggies.  Sometimes, exchange the chicken for leftover turkey also.

This is a great base for broccoli chicken divan. I suggest adding a can of cream of chicken soup along with the can of broccoli cheddar soup. Also add 1/2 cup sour cream. It needs an umph of flavor, so I marinated my chicken breasts in italian dressing for 8 hours before cooking and shredding, added 1/2 tsp cayenne, a cooked diced yellow onion, and 2 cooked and minced cloves of garlic.  Additional salt/pepper to taste and you are in business.

This was really good.The only changes I made was using cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup and I cooked my chicken first in a pan with some chopped onion and garlic, S&P. It was really tasty.

Pretty good, but probably would look for another recipe before making this again. A little bit too salty, and it lacked some sort of carb to anchor the dish. I could see serving with rice, I suppose. I served on toast, which was fine.

No knife work - a perfect busy day meal!  I lightly steamed frozen whole broccoli spears and used left over chopped turkey from my freezer.  Stirred everything together in a mixing bowl (used about 3/4C sour cream in lieu of milk), popped it in a greased casserole dish, and viola... a delicious comforting dinner in the blink of an eye.  A new work night favorite!

This is great!  My husband isn't a fan of broccoli, but he loved it in this dish.  I also added lemon pepper/garlic powder/seasoning salt, and some onion flakes when cooking the chicken.  Added sour cream and used cream of chicken soup because it's what I had.  Doubled the bread crumb/butter mixture, and it was perfect.

Absolutley delicious!! I did add some poultry seasoning to the chicken while cooking it.  I used fat free broccoli cheese soup with skim milk and fat free shredded cheddar cheese....a whole bag! I've been looking for a way to get myself to eat broccoli and this definitely is it.  Even my 9 year old licked her plate clean.

Loved this recipe! It was super easy and I made a few minor adjustments... I seasoned one package of chicken breasts with salt free lemon pepper seasoning and Mrs. Dash. I also used Healthy Request Cream of Mush. and about a 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream. Delicious! Will make again soon :)

Based on the fabulous reviews I was expecting a great meal, even with the modifications so many recommended this was still not my cup of tea.  Too bland and saucy.

This was really good. I made exactly as written. I grilled my chicken with a little salt and pepper before adding it. I will be making this again. Thanks!

My husband says this was the best chicken divan I've made. I didn't change anything enough to mention just a little seasoning that my family likes. Will make it again for sure and double the recipe.

Made this tonight for the first time.  Followed recipe exaclty except doubled everything and cooked in a 3 quart casserole dish.  My husband loved this but suggested next time to put frenches onion on top instead of bread crumbs - will try that the next time I make this.  Also, will add more cheese as we like thinks very cheesey.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was pretty bland and boring.  We followed the recipe as written.  It was a good hearty dish that filled us up, but my husband and I were just kinda disappointed with the flavor. We are willing to try this recipe again but we'll make changes to the spices!!

This was great!  I followed the other reviews and added sour cream and more bread crumbs.  I also sauted onion, celery, and mushrooms and added cream of mushroom soup.  It was a big hit.

Very Good, I added cooked onion with garlic and celery (about 1 cup cooked) on top of the chicken. I added onion & garlic powder, poultry seasoning, black pepper, and a little ground red pepper. I doubled the cheese and added a little extra breadcrumb. I served this over noodles. Delicious!!

Excellent with some modifications...I did what some others suggested....added onion flakes, garlic powder, sour cream, cream of broccoli and cheese soup, and then added a bit of cayenne pepper too.  I bought a rotisserie chicken and chopped up the meat.  Also used 2 packages frozen broccoli florets.  Extra cheese.  Used crushed Ritz crackers with the butter for topping.  Yum!

My family loved this.  I doubled the recipe & I added some steamed rice that I threw a few chicken bouillon cubes into.  I used a combination of cream of chicken/mushroom.  Definitely will make again - this was great.

I was looking for a recipe that I could whip up fast for my family and came across this.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the store and was able to get this in the oven super fast.  I followed the recipe exactly, but left out the melted butter.  This meal was prepped, cooked, and out of the oven within 30 minutes and it tasted really good.  My 14 month old daughter even enjoyed it and she turns her nose up at everything.  My only advice is to let it sit for several minutes once you take it out of the oven- it won't be as watery.

This dish is delicious! :) I used what I had on hand and based on the custom versions.  I used fresh, boneless, skinless chicken breast and cut them in cubes like the original recipe called for. I sauteed them with olive oil then sprinkled in some garlic powder, dried basil leaves, salt and pepper. I let it cook until they were all white and then added in the frozen broccoli (1lb). I turned off the stove and let the broccoli thaw in with the cooked chicken. Then, I put it in a baking dish.    Then, in a separate bowl, i mixed in a can of cream of mushroom and chicken soup, 1/3 cup of sour cream (all i had left) and the 1/3 cup milk. I sprinkled in some poultry seasoning and spread it all over the broccoli/chicken mix.   Added in the cheese and bread crumb/butter mix and baked as it called for in the recipe.   I partnered this dish with some biscuits and called it tuesday night special :) Thanks for sharing!!!! :)

This was very good and easy. I did use the suggestions offered and added some lemon pepper and sour cream, and doubled the recipe. This has also been very good leftover.  I plan on taking this to the next pot luck I go to.

May just not be a casserole person.  I like the ingredients separately ... Made mac & cheese on the bottom to increase kid appeal ... Topped with chow mein noodles instead ... Oh, well.

Just like the easy Campbell's recipes Mom used to make!  I altered the recipe just a bit and I'd make it the same way again...doubled the cheese and mixed all of the ingredients together.  Added 2 tsp garlic powder and 1 1/2 tbsp Monterey Chicken spice.  I skipped the butter and used whole wheat panko breadcrumbs.  Served with brown rice.  Fab!

Added some sour cream, used broccoli cheese soup, and 1/2&1/2, used a rotisserie chicken (shredded) and some garlic powder.  Lots of extra cheese in the filling and on top!  This was YUMMY!

This is a great one-dish dinner.  Just add some bread and you are set.  I followed the recipe as written, except I doubled the topping.  This was a hit with the kids and hubby, so it's a keeper for me!

Yum.  With an added 1/2 c. sour cream, extra cheese mixed in, and the chicken cooked with onion, garlic powder, Mrs. Dash, marjoram, and a squeeze of lemon juice, this was delightful.

Really really good!  I added a bit of the broccoli water to soup and milk mixture to give it a little more gravy.  I did mix altogether and baked as directed.  Will make this often!  Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe.

dissapointing - alot faster but a lot less flavor than expected - added 2 tbsp chopped garlic. Still need something, perhaps cherry tomatoes? Mushrooms?

This was so good.  I loved it with the cream of broccoli soup- really added flavor. I also added a can of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of sour cream and 2 tsp lemon juice.  Per other reviews, I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder while cooking it.  Very good and made great leftovers.

Really good but I did change it up. I added garlic, onions when pan frying the chicken. I also added pasta tot he boiling water with the broccoli because it didn't feel like a meal without it. I used cream of broccoli and cheese soup which I think is a must - added sour cream and some chili pepper flakes and VOILA - amazing dinner. The BF ater broccoli and loved it!!

Easy & awesome! I used frozen broccoli and microwaved it to warm it up. Instead of bread crumbs I crushed about a dozen Ritz crackers, doubled the amount of melted butter and drizzled it over the top. Yum!

Great comfort food and not calorie-laden. I usually double the soup/sauce mixture and add saute'd onions and/or mushrooms. Throw in some fresh herbs. I also used reduced sodium cream mushroom/cream chicken soup.

This was good, but kind of blah. It needed some spice. I added some garlic powder to it when I reheated it as leftovers and that helped alot. I think next time I'll include garlic powder and some chopped onion the next time I make this. I think I will also add some rice or noodles. This needed some "carbs" if you will. It didn't seem "casserole" enough without them. And, next time instead of putting the soup on top of the chicken and broccoli, I think I am going to stir it in to help distribute some flavor and creaminess. Otherwise, this was a great recipe that I definetely plan on making again!

ive made this dish twice and loved it both times. Very easy to make and little cleanup. Make sure you throw some garic powder and seasoning on chicken this will make the dish just a little bit tastier. I also used cream of mushroom soup with garlic. I added a little bit more bread crumbs than called for also and it made the dish hold together better. Overall this dish it really great!

This was good but I wasn't too fond of the cream of broccoli soup, think I would make it again and use cream of chicken instead.  Also, make sure you don't cook the broccoli too much before it bakes, it will turn to mush in the casserole.  Thanks for the recipe.

I did not expect this to taste that great but it really did.  I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it and I used cream of celery soup because I couldn't find broccoli.  I used frozen broccoli instead of fresh and it tasted fine.  I also added an extra half cup of cheddar cheese that I mixed in with the broccoli.

I butterflied a chicken breast and fried it in peanut oil. I used mozzerella cheese, and plain bread crumbs. I didn't like the cream of broccoli soup. If I make this again, I'll use another type of cream soup.

MMMmmm.  I could have this for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  I added more cheese, and a dash of garlic powder.  Instead of the broccoli soup I used cream of mushroom.  The fresh broccoli really made it.  Enjoy.

I followed the recipe and used left over roasted chicken from the store.  Soooo good and easy to make.  I may add some seasoning to the soup/milk mixture next time, but it still was good without it.  I made my kids eat it, but my husband and I loved it.

I used frozen chopped broccoli (I didn't have fresh), used 1 cup cheese and omitted the bread crumbs on top.  I also used some sour cream and less milk.  When I cooked my chicken I added some seasonings (fresh garlic & season salt).  Super tasty!  Will make again!

I gave this 4 stars because I changed it a bit, I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs I sauteed the chicken with oil garlic salt and itlyn seansoning. and I used a lot more cheese. The recipe was good but it was missing something and maybe there could be less of a broccoli taste I think next time ill either use a cream of chicken or cream of mushroom so it off sets from all the broccoli taste. Would make again

I took other reviews suggestion and used a box of Chicken flavored Rice-a-roni on the bottom of the pan.  I would NOT omit adding the rice.  It makes it a real casserole.  Since I added the rice I increased the pan size to a 9 by 13.  Also increased the amount of chicken to 3 chicken breasts since I was adding the rice.  Doubled the amount of breadcrumbs.  When cooking the chicken I seasoned it with a little cajun seasoning.  It was delicious.  I give it 5 stars.  My husband would have preferred more chicken and less broccoli flavor but I am not taking that into account since he is not that big of a fan of broccoli.  I plan on making this again and again.

I altered the reciped a bit.  I did not add extra Cheddar cheese and I used stuffing  mix as topping instead of bread crumbs. It turned out delicious and probably much less fattening than the original recipe.  It did not lost its richness, and I even used skim milk.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

This is a similar recipe to the side of the Cream of Broccoli can. I just made it and I made the following modifications: For the topping i used 3 heaping tbsp bread crumbs, a few good sprinkles of all purpose seasoning and a little under 2 tbsp melted butter, used what cheese i had laying around which was a mix of grated baby parmesan and havarti and mixed it all together (about 1 cup total cheese, maybe a little more). For the chicken i used the prepackaged cooked chicken strips and about 3/4 of a bag of frozen mixed veggies (green, yellow, and red all diff veg) - both were frozen so i put in the casserole dish, covered with plastic wrap and microwaved for about 4-5 min to thaw and heat & drained off excess water after. (that saves dirtying a pot and pan to cook veggies and chicken!) Mixed 1 can Cream of Broccoli&Cheddar soup and about 1/4 cup 5% Light Cream with the chicken and veg till fully  mixed.  Then sprinkled my cheese crumbly stuff evenly over top. This baked up perfectly - i put it at 350 for about 20 min, then another 7-9 min at 425 and it was perfectly bubbly and the crumble was browned. This was SO delicious - i could have eaten the whole casserole dish of it, but i stopped at half!

I've been using a similar recipe passed down by my mother. It's a family favorite!
Our recipe includes regular mayo in place of the milk, leftover fried chicken or crispy chicken strips, a splash of lemon juice & a dash of Curry powder in the sauce - no breadcrumbs....  Delish!

I could not find cream of broccoli anywhere so I used broccoli cheese instead.  It was really bland.  It just tasted like the soup only with axtra broccoli and a bit of chicken.

This is a super satisfying dish with some adjustments as recommended by other reviewers. I used cream of chicken in place of cream of broccoli; added 1/2 cup of nonfat sour cream; and sauteed chicken with garlic, 1/2 cup diced onion, 1 cup mushrooms, and poultry seasoning. For added texture I suggest seving over wild rice.  I will certainly make this dish again.

Healthy but very bland. Before making this you should have some ideas for spicing it up.

Fantastic recipe. I read all of the reviews and have the following helpful hints.  A lot of people said that it was bland and that may be because the recipe does not specify to season your chicken.  I sauteed some garlic and onions with my chicken and also seasoned the cutlets with lemon pepper, seasoning salt paprika and a little pepper.  I also didnt make this dish in a pie plate.  I mixed the broccoli (1.5 pounds) and chicken together and put it in a casserole dish and then made the dish as per the recipe. Instead of using breadcrumbs (we didnt have any) I used crushed Ritz crackers instead.  This was so tasty! Will definitely make again.  Thanks Terry!

This was really good ~ I added 1/4 tsp curry, 1/2 cup of sour cream and more cheese.  Very yummy.  It was a tad runny so I think I'll use less milk next time around.  Definitely a keeper!

When I went to the store to buy the ingredients for this, I could not find cream of broccoli soup, cause typically for that particular store which shall remain nameless (*cough walmart cough*) they didn't have it. They were out of stock. So instead, I grabbed broccoli cheddar as a substitute, and it added more flavor to it. It made it even better. So if you can't find that soup, want to sub for it, or just want better flavor, grab some broccoli cheddar. You won't be disappointed.

I made it exactly how the recipe was written and enjoyed it! I don't like when things are "over seasoned" as I grew up with things a little more on the bland side I guess.  I threw a few extra Panko crumbs on top to give it an extra little bit of crunch and ended up going back for seconds! A quick meal that's easy enough to throw together when you're in a rush like I was tonight; will definitely make again!

It was delish! I used the other reviewers recommendations and added 1/2 c. sour cream, extra cheese mixed in the chicken and broccoli, fresh ground pepper, and a tsp chicken bouillon. I would make it again!

Very tasty.  I used Cream of Mushroom instead of Broccoli Soup, and I added Mushrooms.  I used my cast iron grill to cook my chicken pieces, which I seasoned with Garlic &  Onion Salt.  I made my own bread crumbs from a premium bread, and it made a difference.  I am going to make my own Cream Sauce next time.

The only down side to this dish is that it didn't last that long in my house. My family demolished it! Lol very good, fast, and easy dish. I added sour cream and two 8 oz packs of cheddar cheese ( one mixed throughout and one as a topping ).

I really liked the taste, the speed and the healthiness of this recipe. I used a package of frozen broccoli, 3 frozen chicken breasts I microwaved and diced and used cream of chicken soup (because I didn't have cream of broccoli), and it turned out great.

Good recipe with some adjustments. I made a double recipe which filled a 9x13 pan nicely. I started by sautéing 16oz of mushrooms in pan. I set them aside and added an onion and a few cloves of garlic to the chicken. I seasoned that with black pepper, seasoning salt, and poultry seasoning to taste. When I mixed the soup and the milk , I added enough hot sauce to make the sauce tangy but not spicy. This dish definitely needed the flavor, adjust amount to taste.

I used the suggestions from some of the other reviewers and loved it. I enjoy getting the tips from others and often use them so it doesn't bother me when recipes are altered. This is a good and can be healthy dish if you use the healthy request soups and lower fat cheese.

This is a quick and easy recipe and my husband and I enjoyed it. I had to use cream of chicken soup since I didn't have cream of broccoli, but it was still excellent. I used chicken cut off a rotisserie chicken from Costco. I made more of the crumb mixture than the recipe called for so I could have a generous amount to sprinkle on top. I was glad I did, because the original amount would not have been enough. Delicious!

I made no changes as this is the first time I made it.  It was easy to make and really flavorful.  My family loved it!
I will make it again and because it can be so versatile I may add other spices or vegetables.

I have made this but without the condensed soup as a base. I always find it has a strange taste and too much salt. I make my own sauce with a little butter, milk, flour and chicken stock and season it with whatever I have around. You cannot go wrong, however, with chicken, broccoli and cheese in a  cream sauce.

Other than using cream of chicken soup (I had no cream of broccoli) and microwaving the broccoli instead of boiling it (the new pan I was using was taking too long to heat), I mostly followed the recipe.  However, because of the reviews saying it was bland, I did add minced and powdered garlic, but not convinced it was needed, as well as salt and pepper to the broccoli.  The dish was surprisingly excellent; I keep looking at the ingredients and am not at all sure why that is, but even my picky better half thought it was very very good!!!  Next time I will just mix the brocolli and chicken and sauce before putting in the pan and covering with cheese et al; I think it will look better and not likely to taste any different.

Pretty much followed the recipe. Used 3/4 lb chicken and Colby/jack cheese. We saw no reason to doctor it up - tastes fine as is. Of course this opinion comes from a beginner cook and his wife who is tired of cooking after 55 years of it. She thinks everything she doesn't have to cook tastes fine and I am biased.

I added sour cream and cheese to the filling mix and added some seasoning like Ms. Dash table blend and garlic powder. Doubled up on the breadcrumb mix and cheese for the top. TASTY!

I doubled this recipe. I used 1 can of broccoli soup and 1 can of condensed cheese soup. I added diced onions and fresh mushrooms. While cooking the chicken I seasoned it with onion powder, paprika and garlic powder with salt and pepper to taste. It came out delicious! Served over white rice.

This was pretty good, but I'd probably make a few tweeks including adding onions and maybe using broccoli cheddar soup instead of the cream of broccoli. Still everyone liked it, even my 2 year old!! Served with white rice.

I make this all the time.  Sometimes with broccoli and cream of broccoli soup.  Sometimes with plain and sweet potatoes cubed with cream of celery or cheddar soup.  Sometimes with mixed vegees and cream of chicken soup.   You can also use turkey instead of the chicken and use stove top stuffing instead of the crumbs. The possibilities are Endless!!!!!!

Delicious. Low fat Greek yogurt is a wonderful substitute for sour cream, and I used it in this recipe along with the soup. Garlic, paprika, and a little worcestershire sauce, gave it a nice kick. Also added a cup of rice from yesterday's take-out Chinese food. I put the rice on top of the chicken and broccoli before I added the sauce.

This was great as a base recipe, because it is just so simple and yet still tasty. I only changed what I did because I wanted to use ingredients that I already had on-hand. I followed the recipe exactly but made some substitutions. I used cream of chicken soup instead of the broccoli (I also added a little lemon-pepper and garlic powder to it) and I used mexican 4-cheese instead of cheddar. I also used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the store and cut that up. Thanks for a super easy and yummy recipe!

This was so tasty!  I changed a couple of things because of what I had on hand.  I didn't have a whole pound of broccoli so I threw in a can of green beans too and I didn't have bread crumbs so I put fried onions on top.  I also used cream of chicken soup because that's all I had.  We loved it!!  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Delicious, but bumping up the flavor is a must.  I followed some of the other suggestions, by adding crushed chicken bouillon cubes, and lemon pepper, and poultry seasoning to the chicken and that helped a lot!  Our store did not have cream of broccoli, so I got cream of cheesy broccoli and it worked well.  We also got a chicken that was pre-cooked (such as the ones from Costco or Smiths) and it was so juicy and tender.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is good with some changes like other mentioned. Needed a tad more flavor. I added a lot of extra cheese and a lot of extra bread crumb mixture. I also used cream of mushroom soup with the milk mixture and used Mrs. Dash to pre-season the chicken. Definitely need to double recipe for a family. Otherwise, was very good and easy breezy to make in a hurry :)

We loved this recipe, no leftovers!  I precooked the broccoli in the micro, drained the bag & was good to go.  I used a rotisserie chicken.  I don't like Cream of Broccoli soup so i used Cream of Mushroom, it was perfect.  I didn't add any extra spices as the cheese, chicken and soup had enough seasoning (salt anyway).  I will add pepper next time.  No major changes, can't wait to make it again!

Very good but did have to add lots of spices to it for DH's spicy palate but he loved it after doing that.  Used the parmesan topping instead of the bread crumbs to lighten the carb load.  Thanks for sharing.  Will definitely make again.  Super easy.

This took me back to my growing up years. My friend's mom used to make this and I loved it! I add about 1/2 cup mayo and a tsp. of dry mustard. I use cream of chicken soup because I can get a low sodium version (and cannot w/cream of broccoli). I double the cheese and in place of bread crumbs, I grate parmesan cheese on the top.

I love this recipe! I have made it several times in my house. I only make it slightly different. I add extra cheese and double the bread crumb mixture. I mix everything together (except bread crumb topping) before baking. This is delicious! I serve it over white rice.

Love this recipe! I make it all the time! Based on other reviews, I add garlic powder and pepper, without it's a little bland. For the chicken I usually buy 2 packages of the precooked, chicken chunks (near the cold meat section). Super simple and delicious!

This was excellent.  The only thing I would possibly change is just a tad more melted butter in the bread crumbs.  There wasn't quite enough to soak all the crumbs.  In the end I don't think it really mattered.  GF and I loved it.

This is so much better if you make your own sauce and avoid the glutinous can of soup. I used leftover turkey and added fresh steamed broccoli to it in a baking dish. I sautéed some onions in about 3T butter, added some flour to make a roux, then added about 3/4 cup chicken stock and about 1/2 cup cream and 1/4 cup dry sherry and about 3/4 cup grated cheddar as well as salt and pepper, then the bread crumbs that I sautéed in butter. It turned about very good.

This recipe is too bland as written.  I added a lot of ground pepper and the lemon pepper seasoning as well.  This is one of the all-time easiest meals I've ever made.  A note about the bread crumbs in butter:  you cant spread bread crumbs soaked in butter, it makes a big clump and it was WAY too short on amount.  I too threw in three times more un-buttered bread crumbs for the surface texture.  I would not do the butter in the crumbs again.

This was really good. My husband asked me to serve this again. This is also a fairly low carb recipe. A great alternative to high carb casseroles.

As recommended, I tweaked this recipe a bit. I sauteed a half of an onion in with the chicken.Also I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and around 1/4 cup of sour cream.I added minced garlic and a half of a bullion cube. Served with rice and everyone loved it!

I don't normally make changes to a recipe the first time I try it, but in this case I had to.  Apparently my grocery doesn't carry cream of broccoli soup, so I used broccoli cheese soup in its place. I noticed a lot of reviews said thiw was bland,but I ddidn't think so. Its not like you're adding a ton of spices, but some nights you want something simple, with simple flavors. I followed all other instructions,  and for the chicken I cubed 2 good sized boneless skinless breasts and quick cooked them in the skillet.  The only change I would recommend other than trying it with broccoli cheese soup (and adding a little more cheese on top, because who doesn't love cheese?) is to use a a bigger dish. When I measured out the broccoli, I knew immediately that this wasn't going to fit in my 9 inch pie pan, so I grabbed a 2 quart round casserole dish, and it fit perfectly.

Omg, this dish is phenomenal! Added more chicken, cheese, and broccoli than called for. Jazzed up the chicken with half a chopped onion and Paula Dean's house seasoning. Used half a can of cream of mushroom and half cream of broccoli. Followed the suggestion to add 1/2 cup of sour cream. Mixed everything in a big bowl, added cheese to the filling, seasoned to taste, then sprayed a 9x13 with Pam. Instead of breadcrumbs, crushed some Ritz crackers and mixed with melted butter. Not a big fan of breadcrumbs on casseroles...THIS was amaze. Served over rice with some sweet corn on the cob. I'm sure it would be great over egg noodles too! Will be adding this to the faves. Thanks for the great recipe! Next time I'll definitely double up! :)

Good base recipe.  I spiced it up by adding salt, pepper, and garlic salt on top on the broccoli and chicken.  Also added extra cheese, 1 cup instead of 1/2

This was a fantastic recipe!  My husband loved it so much, he made me post a review!  I followed others recommendations and seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper, garlic powder and seasoning salt.  I was out of milk and it was a rainy night so I didn't want to go out to the store, so I melted cream cheese and added enough water to make it milk consistency.  Yummy-definately a keeper!

Pretty good recipe. The chicken is what makes it or breaks it, not the cream of broccoli, so make sure it's well spiced!

Despite seasoning chicken with spices and garlic I still found it to be very bland. It tastes exactly like its made:broccoli, chicken and a can of soup dumped on top:(

I went to the store planning to duplicate this recipe.  However, I opted for Campbell's Broccoli Cheese soup instead of cream of broccoli.  All other ingredients were the same.  I did double the recipe size and used an 11 x 7 casserole dish.  Everyone loved it.  The broccoli was very tender, and with no added spices, the flavor was still very good. It was also very simple to make.  We will definitely have it again.

I made this tonight for the first time. As others in the review section stated, I tweaked it a bit. My fiance and I give it a 3.5/5 stars. It's good, just not great, but a good comfort food meal to make a couple times a year. I will probably not use all of the soup next time as it was pretty thick and rich. I served with white rice on the side and we mixed it in on our plates. I used: 8X8 Dish, Cooking Spray, 1 Frozen Steamfresh Bag of Broccoli (12 oz), 1.5 cups Largely Shredded Chicken from a Rotisserie Chicken, 1 (10.75 oz) can of Cream of Chicken and Mushroom Soup, 1/3 cup of Milk, 1/2 cup of Sour Cream, 1-1.5 cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese, 2 tbsp Melted Butter, 4 tbsp Dried Bread Crumbs, Onion Powder, Pepper, Weber Roasted Garlic and Herb Seasoning.

Directions
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and spray dish with cooking spray.
2. Pull 1.5 cups of chicken off rotisserie chicken.
3. Cook Broccoli in microwave for 5 minutes.
4. In a bowl, mix the soup, sour cream and milk.
5. Place Broccoli, Chicken, 3/4-1 cup of cheese in the dish. Heavily coat with the seasonings. Add the soup mixture and mix it all together.
6. Sprinkle 1/4-1/2 cup of cheese on the top.
4. Mix the melted butter with the bread crumbs, and sprinkle over the cheese.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 18 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly brown and broil for 1-2 minutes.

I always make recipes on here "as is" so I can give a fair assessment.  This was very good, but I only gave it 4 stars because I think it would be better with a couple changes.  Now I will say what I didn't like about it.  It had too much broccoli for my tastes. It seemed more like a broccoli casserole than a chicken one. Next time I would half the broccoli (I used frozen but cooked it a little before putting it all together).  I also wouldn't use the cream of broccoli soup, but maybe cream of chicken or mushroom instead. And I would add a half cup of sour cream.  Other than that, very good.

Yum! This was delicious! I doubled it, steamed the broccoli in the microwave, and used one can of cream of broccoli and one can of cream of chicken.  I put buttery ritz topping on half and season bread crumbs topping on the other half. I enjoyed the bread crumbs side the best.  I also added some cheese to the soup mixture and used perdue shortcuts chicken to make it more flavorful and easier. It was phenomenal and I will definitely make it again!

I was surprised at how good this was.  I made it ahead and kept it in the freezer to eat on a busy night.  It was a hit!  I used much less than the 1 pound of broccoli called for, though.  The bread crumbs were soggy -- I may just skip them next time

I made the recipe for 30 servings and got lots of compliments.  The only change I made was to use crushed crackers as a topping instead of bread crumbs.  I'm ready to make it again, but this time for my family so that I can have seconds!!

Yum!! Cooked the chicken with garlic and onion powder, thyme, oregano and salt of course. Also made it with cream of chicken and herbs soup as another reviewer suggested. Topped with panko bread crumbs. Was great as leftovers for lunch today.

I altered this recipe as well. I cooked my chicken in butter [down here in the south we LOVE us some butter ;)] with garlic and a hint of paprika.  I added a dash of garlic to my broccoli while it was boiling as well. I prepared more of the bread crumbs than called for (Just melted a wad of butter and mixed in the breadcrumbs (and added some basil and oregeno - just a dash) until the right consistency). I then mixed my chicken, broccoli, cream of broc, added a can of cream of mushroom, the 1/3 cup of milk, a handful of cheese, and half of my breadcrumbs. :) And followed the directions from there on out!

This recipe is very good and leaves room for additions, in a good way.  Next time I plan on adding some mushrooms or using cream of mushroom soup instead of broccoli, to change it up a little bit and keep the recipe fresh.

This was really good, I made changes based on other reviews.  I added chopped garlic, onion powder and curry powder to the chicken while sauteing it.  I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the soup mixture and put the shredded cheese onto the chicken with the soup mixture on top of that.  My kids devoured this!

It is very bland as is. So I added a little zip of white wine and a sprinkle of chicken stock, then instead of bread crumbs I use corn flakes mixed with the melted butter and topped with cheese. It makes the top more crunchy and tasty. And to make it stretch further, I mixed in cooked whole grain noodles before baking in the oven.

Its yummy! I used frozen cooked chicken strips that come in a bag and doubled everything to make in a 13X9 inch pan. For the breadcrumbs I used buttery crackers, my kids loved it!

my husband and i really enjoyed this;  i did make a few changes in the preparation, tho.  I didn't parboil the broccoli, just distributed the florets in a single layer on the bottom of the casserole dish;  on top of that i placed cooked chicken (leftover from a slow-cooker "roast" chicken that was not a success).  In a frying pan i sauteed one medium onion and a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, added those to the soup, cheese, and milk mixture, and poured it carefully over the top of the chicken / broccoli.  I forgot about the bread crumbs, and put shredded cheddar on top.  Baked for 25 minutes at 450*F then let it rest for 15 min.  It was lovely and a dish i will definitely make again!  Thanks!!

Great recipe.  I didn't realize until I started making it that it was only for a pie sized pan casserole so I doubled it and turned it into a 9 X 13 standard casserole dish (glass).  To prepare the chicken, I cut four boneless/skinless chicken breasts into bite size cubes and then sauteed them in a little butter, diced garlic and salt until just cooked through.  The only other thing I did that the recipe didn't call for is to quadruple the bread crumb topping just because I felt like I wanted more of a crunchy texture.  I did use panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs, again for that crunch factor.  Served with steamed rice as the recipe suggests.  It did create multiple dishes to wash between the steamer for the broccoli, skillet for chicken and then casserole dish and bowls for the bread crumb topping and to mix up the soup mixture.  I just tend to try to use recipes that use minimal dishes or that are one or two pot because I mostly cook during the busy work/school week.  Great recipe though and I will make it again.

I found this exact recipe off the back of my Campbell's Cream of Broccoli soup can. The only changes I made was I seasoned the chicken with some salt, garlic powder, pepper, oregano, and added chopped garlic to the pan when cooking the chicken. I then mixed the chicken, finely chopped broccoli, soup, and milk all together which helped de-glaze the pan and give the soup/sauce color. Then added this to a baking dish and sprinkled with the cheese & breadcrumbs. Served with white rice. A great way to get my toddler to eat her veggies! Will definitely make again :) Easy & delish!

Second time making this recipe. I love it. Our guest said it was the best dinner she had in a while! The only modifications I made were adding a can of cream of chicken soup, adding bacon (must!) and seasoning the chicken before cooking it.

Fabulous dish.  One change I made was to use panko instead of bread crumbs.  It gives it a tiny crunch!

I thought it was a pretty good weeknight option for a casserole.  I added a cup of brown rice to make it more of a meal.  It was great, we'll deffinitly make this again

This was awesome... I changed it up a little but have made it as written also. My recommendations would be to use Bear Creek cheesy broccoli soup mix made per directions on package and add a little cooked rice for a more hearty meal... or I've even placed the rice on my plate and served the broccoli chicken divan over it. Yum!!

SO GOOD.  And easy!  With the recommended changes this would be a 5!  I left out the butter and subbed the milk for low fat sour cream.  I also used frozen chopped broccoli instead of fresh.

It was a good recipe but i tweaked it for personal taste... i made my own cream of chicken soup base (milk, cornstarch, flour, onion powder, turmeric, chicken boullion) since i didn't have any cans on hand. i added 1/2 cup mayo and 1/4 tsp curry powder too. i mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering. it came out wonderful. i do think that it's not necessary to steam the broccoli, i think it made it too mushy and i only steamed it for 2 minutes then ran it under cold water. i will definitely make this again!

I used a cup less broccoli and added a cup of sliced carrots.  I also used a can of Cream of Chicken soup. I had some left over rotisserie chicken in the freezer and gave it a quick chop! The carrots add a lot of color which I liked. I will definitely make this again...didn't even have any to freeze for a quick bite later...

Looked delicious, but VERY bland even after seasoning the chicken before cooking.  If I made this again I would definitely be adding a few things to kick up the flavor.

This was very good.  I also made a couple of tweaks.  First I used shredded chicken.  I also added a 1/2 cup of sour cream as others suggested.  Instead of bread crumbs, I topped with French's fried onions.  I served this over rice.

Excellent recipe!!!  I made this last night, and my boyfriend and I both loved it.  The only thing I did was double the recipe, and made it in a 9x13 pan, and almost half the pan was eaten last night, by the two of us!!  Thank you for a wonderful dish.

The broccoli was not cooked long enough and there really just was nothing very flavorful. I added a little extra milk and it turned out very watery, but that's my fault.  It definitely needs some garlic, extra cheese, maybe two cans of soup, something.

kids and husband liked it.  Another easy side I have added to my family menu.  I used Cream of Chicken soup and all was great!  I didnt chop the brocolli after it wa steamed, kids loeved it anyway but will likely stock freezer with chopped brocolli.

A very good, easy recipe. I did spice it up with fresh thyme, sage and garlic.  My husband put a thumbs up on this one.

Great basic recipe. Double it, and use cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups. Add sauteed mushrooms. Mix in sour cream with the soup and milk; add extra cheese to this mixture, too. Increase buttered bread crumbs to half a cup.

It was a great recipe but I ended up pulling other flavors in with it.....I doubled the recipe but instead I used 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 cans of broccoli soup, and 2/3 cup of milk.  Then with the chicken I ended up putting 1 diced onion, 2 cloves of garlic (finely chopped) and put garlic pepper and seasoning salt for the flavor.  I also added 1 cup of cooked rice and left out the bread crumbs and just put 1 cup of cheese on top and it was wonderful!!!

I used 3 chicken breasts, a can of broccoli cheese soup, a can of cream of chicken soup, a can's worth of milk and 2-3 T of sour cream and mayo.  Used a whole block of cheddar chese and added 1/2 a package of cooked egg noodles.  Tops with a sleeve or so of Ritz and lots of butter.  Served with salad and bread.  Nice meal!

Subbing what I had on hand (cream of chicken soup & a different kind of cheese, colby+monteray) I can pretty much guess that this recipe is delicious and FLEXIBLE! My boyfriend loved it.

Great recipe! I altered it a bit, adding 3 chopped celery stalks and 1 can of chopped water chessnuts. I was making this for a larger group so I used 1 1/2 pounds broccoli and 1 1/2 pounds chicken.Also, substituted 1 can Healthy Choice cream of celery, 1 can Healthy Choice cream of chicken and increasing the milk to 2/3 cups, adding an extra can and milk because of the increased use of broccoli and chicken. It turned out great, and was delicious served with white rice. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight. Mostly followed the recipe.. Roasted my chicken with garlic salt, pepper and olive oil. I used 3 different types of cheese though. American: 1 slice. Cheddar: 1/2 c. And Monterey Jack: 1/2 c. Loved all 3 together:) I do find the dish to be a bit bland. I recommend adding 2 table spoons cream cheese to the soup/sauce mix. Maybe even a chicken flavoring? It's definitely missing something or else it would be a 5 star bc its easy and a dinner everyone will enjoy. 

Also, make sure to use a PIE dish!!! If not it could come out dry.

I love this dish and usually put a different spin on it  every time I make it. I cut about 3 chicken breast in cubes and saute with onions in olive oil. I season the chicken and simmer it in the spicy juices before mixing with the vegtables. I like to use green/yellow beans and baby carrots instead of broccoli.  Using a bowl, I mix the veggies and chicken and pour into casserole dish.  In a separate bowl I usually mix cream of chicken soup with half can of water and half can of milk.  I pour that over chicken and veggies and then stir it all in.  Top with Tex Mex blend of cheese and bread crumbs.  Yummy!  My household is full of picky eaters but they gobble this one up!  I think it is all in the spices you use.  I have also used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and that is delish as well!

After reading the other reviews I tweeked the recipe just a bit. I used two 10 oz pkg of steam in the bag broccoli florets. I had 1 cup of sour cream to the liquid mixture. Doubled the soup to two cans and doubled the milk. I used some garlic salt to season the broccoli after it was cooked. The chicken cutlets I used I roasted in the oven with salt and pepper. In addition I used about 2 cups + of sharp shredded chedder cheese. Mixed all the ingredients together and put into a baking dish. It was AWESOME!! Kids loved it!! This recipe is a keeper!!

I make this recipe all the time except I like to kick it up a notch. I actually use a store bought lemon pepper rotisserie chicken. I saute some onions & mushrooms & add some garlic powder for flavor. I like to add some carrots for color along with sour cream & extra cheese. I prefer cream of mushroom & chicken soup. I top it with lots of Progresso Italian Panko breadcrumbs which make it nice & crispy.

Delicious!  I tweaked the recipe of course, but it was great.  I used two chicken breasts, seasoned with montreal, garlic, red pepper and cooked them in a splash of lemon juice.  I only had a little broccoli so I used broccoli and asparagus.  I added another half cup of sharp white cheddar, and a spoon full of sour cream.  Fiance and I both loved it!

It was average as written. I think it does need more flavor to it. I had to pour on the salt and pepper! I will make it again with a few adjustments because it is so easy and quick.

Easy and good, but sort of bland. I thought a pie plate would be too shallow, so I used a deeper casserole dish. I served over rice with a side salad. I plan to make it again, but it needs seasoning.

I made this with leftover baked chicken. Its a challenge when it comes to leftovers, so imagine my surprise to come across a great recipe using chicken. I made one substitution and it was the breadcrumbs. I had a package of Texas Toast Garlic and Butter croutons and pulsed those in a mini food processor. I ended up with about a 1/2 cup crumbs and sprinkled over the cheese. There wasn't any need for added butter since it was part of the croutons, and the garlic also gave the dish some added flavor. Next time, I may add extra cheese and make it one cup instead of 1/2 cup. I would definitely take this to a family function or potluck. Two thumbs up!!

My husband loved this dish and we thought it was pretty healthy.  I used cream of mushroom soup (98% fat free) instead of cream of brocolli.  I also used 3 cups crushed corn flakes instead of the bread crumbs.  The corn flakes gave it a nice crunch.  The chicken was a little bland even though I sprinkled with garlic salt before cooking.  Next time I would add a few more spices.  Overall a pretty easy recipe and would be easy to double for a crowd.  I served with white rice.

Not too bad but next time, think I'll use cream of chicken or celery soup instead of the broccoli.

We LOVED this... I added it to my favorites :)  I didn't have fresh broccoli so I used frozen and I didn't have Cream of Broccoli so I used Cream of Chicken.  Still worked great!  Will make again and again!

Made this tonight and enjoyed it. I made a few modifications of my own such as using cream of chicken soup and adding some sauteed onions/shallots/mushrooms/garlic to the mixture before placing in the oven. Also, be VERY generous with whatever spices you have laying around. I cooked my chicken in a zip and steam bag with some lemon herb seasoning and then I added various seasonings to the soup/milk mixture (TJ's 21 seasoning salute, original chicken seasoning, garlic salt). I used panko on the top, stuck it in the oven for about 15 minutes, and served over white rice. Pretty yummy but not as moist as I would have liked it....we were definitely craving more sauce. Next time I would add an extra half can of soup and some extra milk and maybe a few dollops of sour cream as well. Overall, a quick yummy dinner that is very easy on the budget. Enjoy!

My wife added mushrooms & a can of mushroom soup; also added a total of 2/3 cup milk. Omitted the butter and bread crumbs. Overall, a pretty bland recipe that the kids tired of quickly. Nice texture, however. Not likely to make again.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was absolutely delicious!!! I only made a few changes: used condensed broccoli cheese soup instead of condensed cream of broccoli soup; used about 1 Cup skim milk; used canned chicken instead of cooking and cubing fresh chicken (huge time saver- just used a fork to break down the chunks of chicken); added onion powder; added celery salt; added garlic powder; I also omitted the melted butter and used Panko instead of the bread crumbs!!  I served it on top of white rice.  Very good and filling meal!!

My mom used to make this when I was younger. I made several changes.  In between the layers of broccoli and chicken I added a layer of sautéed mushrooms.  I used a can of condensed mushroom soup instead and mixed it with 1/3 cup of mayo instead of milk. I mixed the cheddar cheese in with the soup and mayo and added two dashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce.   Then I put the mayo, soup, and cheese mixture on top of the chicken.  Baked for 30min.  Crumbled the bread crumbs and butter on top.  Baked for 10 more min.  AMAZING

Husband and I love this! I use cream of chicken, skim milk, 2% cheddar cheese(more than the recipe calls for I'm sure:)) and store brand of French's fried onions instead of breadcrumbs. Oh, and also season chicken with salt and pepper before cooking. Yum comfort food!

This was very good and easy.  I did add more seasoning to it to give it more flavor. Also, instead of the bread crumbs I had cornbread casserole left over from the night before. I crumbled it up and sprinkled it on top of the cheese. YUMMY!!

This is a great recipe for a quick and easy dinner using things that I had on hand. I used cream of chicken soup (Healthy Request), 2% milk and Mexican shredded cheese.  After reading the other reviews I added pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and cajun spice. So, I overspiced it somewhat. I will definitely make this again.

Family all loved this.  The only thing is I would amend the recipe to read in instruction line 3 'Top with cooked chicken'.  Even though 'cooked' is in the ingredients in my book it should be in the directions more so.

We used swiss cheese instead of the cheddar and it was just as good.  Very simple easy casserole with few ingredients.  Perfect for a weeknight.

This is AWESOME.  I followed others advice and seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, added onions & 1/2 cup of sour cream. It fits perfectly in a 2 quart casserole dish.  I'd say this feeds approx 3-4 people.  Served biscuits with it.  You will not be dissapointed.

Great to do with left over chicken.  Next time I may omit the breadcrumb topping just because there is enough flavour and calories with out it.  I did add sour cream and sauteed onion as well. Also I used broccoli and cheese soup. Don't add any salt, the soup has plenty.  Served with rice, and the leftovers heated well in the micro next day.  I will make this again for sure, and may add more veggies and serve over penne pasta next time.

This recipe was a great and easy meal! I did follow other reviews while making this and added a few touches of my own. What I took from other reviews was to add the 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup extra cheese for the filling, and doubled the butter and bread crumb mixture. Otherwise I sauteed the chicken with olive oil and minced garlic and about a 1/2 cup of zesty italian dressing. I steamed the broccoli just enough to be extra crispy so it wasn't mushy after baking. I also used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. I mixed everything together and baked for about 17 minutes. The result was delicious!

I wanted something different, so I used Tuna instead of the Chicken, The soup I used was Cream of Chicken with Herbs. I added some garlic and dried minced onion. I also added some Parmesan cheese along with the cheddar. At the last minute, I decided to add the rice and save cleaning another pot. I added 1/2 cup brown rice and the water I used to cook the broccoli in, there was about 3/4 cup. It worked great for my family of three, My Dad had seconds!

this is amazing, one of my favorite meals now.  i tried it the first time exactly as the recipe states and it was still very good.  the next time though, i added in almost half an onion sauteed with the chicken, substituted mushroom soup for the broccoli soup and added in some cauliflower too and extra chicken and made a larger casserole.  it's a great quick and easy meal

The crust on this was excellent and the flavors combined very well.  I made this ahead of time and kept it in the fridge until I was ready to bake it.  The only drawback was I wish there was some sort of carb in the casserole.  Next time I will add in either pasta or rice to make it a full-meal.

I love this dish but I altered mine and it was a huge hit! I used Amy's Organic semi-condensed cream of mushroom soup. I added a few dollops of sour cream to the soup/milk sauce mixture. I also seasoned the chicken with fresh garlic, butter and onion and Emeril's seasoning. I also added a little more chicken (sort of doubled it) so I doubled the breadcrumbs/butter and added a tad more cheddar cheese than it calls for and sprinkled parmesan cheese as well. It was so delicious! What's great about this kind of dish is you can make it early in the afternoon before the family comes home and reheat it for dinner. It took me about 20 minutes to prep this! So easy.

Simple and quick!  Took the advice of others and cooked the chicken with onion and seasonings including garlic and tarragon.  I mixed in some sour cream with the milk and soup and a little fresh parmesan in the crumb topping.  Served it with noodles and rolls and it my son and husband loved it!  Thanks for an easy Monday night meal!

This recipe could not be easier or more delicious. After making it once, I was hooked. This is a new standby dish as i often have all the ingredients to make it. Try it, you will not be sorry.

This was so easy and very good. Can't beat it for a quick and easy dinner. I did cheat a little bit and added a cheddar broccoli soup instead the soup & cheese. Saved some time and was still delicious. Thanks.

Absolutely delicious (and easy!) crowd pleaser.  I wanted to make more the next day.  My family scarfed it down and there were no leftovers.  I will definitely be making this again.......soon. :)

I expected much more after reading the rave reviews!  This was bland.  I liked using the fresh broccoli, but it needed MUCH salt and pepper at the table.  I used a roasted chicken from the store as a shortcut which actually added some flavor in my opinion.  I wouldn't make again.

My husband and I thought this was ok but my 3 yr old and 1 yr old wouldn't even touch it. Made the changes to the chicken and added spices, garlic and onion and doubled the breadcrumb mixture. It would be ok for a side dish at my house but not as a meal.

This was great!  I put a little more bread crumbs and chicken than it called for. My husband was a little worried about the broccoli but he ended up loving it!

I am updating this to five stars.  It's so easy and quick, you can't beat that!  Adding seasoning to the chicken really boosts the flavor.  I bake or grill it with garlic powder and lemon pepper and add pepper to the soup mix with some lemon juice.  Really good!  I'll leave off the bread crumb topping next time. I don't think it adds much to the recipe.

This was very good!! I only give 4 stars though because I think it would have been very bland & boring from the ingredients given had I not spruced it up a bit! What I did was steam the broccoli for 5 minutes & then put it in the pie pan. Then stir fried the chicken with some onions in olive oil & put that in with the broccoli & stirred it up. Then in a separate bowl mixed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic because thats what I had on hand. I mixed it with the milk, 1/2 cup sour cream, sprinkled not measured some garlic powder, a little white wine & a small handful of cheese. Then I spread the sauce on top & covered in cheese & breadcrumbs....I left out mixing the butter in the breadcrumbs & I didn't miss it at all! I served over white rice with a side of garlic bread for a delicious meal!!!

Great quick, speedy dinner.  Didn't have cream of broccoli so I used mushroom and added a few mushrooms as well.  Husband loved it and we had some leftovers.  Excellent, simple meal.

Quick and easy I think I would rather mix everything toigether because the broccoli didn't get any of the good stuff at the bottom.  I added garlic salt/pepper as well for extra taste.

I thought it was good, but I think it could have used a bit less broccoli, some more cheese. It was super easy to make, and the ingredients are cheap. I'd probably make it again!

I really enjoy this dish.  It tends to be a little soupy, so we serve it over rice.  It's easy to season this recipe to your taste, or change up the vegetables depending on your preferences.  I especially like the low calorie count on this.  Even serving it up with rice, it comes in at less than 500 calories for a complete meal.  I will omit the butter and bread crumbs in the future though.  The topping doesn't add much, in my opinion.

This was very easy and much better than I expected. My only complaint would be that the soup sort of overpowered the dish. Next time I will not use the whole can.

Will definitely make again. Only changes I made were to use cream of chicken soup (I had it on hand), colby-jack cheese (also on hand), and I steamed the broccoli instead of boiling it. Very yum. Didn't find it too bland at all. I do want to try it with some curry powder another time, however, for something different.

This is fantastic! I add a 3/4 cup of cooked rice, and rather than using cream of broccoli soup, I use cream of mushroom or cream of chicken (or a mixture of both). Before adding the bread crumbs, which are just fine without the butter, I add a thin layer of more shredded Cheddar cheese.

Awesome! I had to sub with cream of celery because the store was out of cream of broccoli but it was still great! I also cooked up the chicken in garlic powder and parsley.  I recommend making more bread crumb topping than suggested, because it's yummy!

This was the first casserole type dish I've ever made and I loved it!  It's simple and easy to do even for a novice like me, although it does take some prep time.  I followed the other reviewers' advice of adding an extra 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to the coup mixture.  I've already made this dish twice!  I add some black beans in the mixture sometimes for extra protein.   Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good. I used broccoli cheese soup. It's the same recipe as on the back of the soup label. Make sure you drain the broccoli very well because I didn't and the bottom was all watery. It still tasted good though.

This is absolutely delicious.  I always add 1/2c. of sour cream, but I also add 1-2 tsp of currry as well.  My family loves it with the added zip the curry gives it.

A nice comfort food dish that you can easily modify to make more healthy without sacrificing taste. I used reduced fat/sodium cream of mushroom soup and reduced fat cheese. I also seasoned the chicken with some lemon pepper. I think you could probably add sliced carrots to this as well to increase the veggie content.

It was a good recipe. I was trying to find the best broccoli caserole recipe I could find and this did it. I made it without the chicken and added potatoes instead. Next time I will try it with the chicken. I also added sour cream and lots of more cheese. I actually cooked the sause separately and then added to the broccoli which was already cooked along with the potatoes. Oh, I also used maybe 1/2 cup of whipped cream and then stirred a little milk if needed. That made the sauce so much creamier. Please add some salt and pepper, as well as onion and garlic when cooking the broccoli, it will not be blend. Overall it was a great starting point for me.

I've been making this meal (minus the bread crumbs) for many years.  We've always loved it.  So alone, I think it's great.  However, I did take suggestions of others and added 1/2c sour cream, also mushrooms and onions.   Those additions plus the bread crumbs and butter made this meal fantastic!  Huge hit with my 16 year old son "That was SO good!!" he said, hesitantly, as to not insult mom's original meal - cute.  Thanks for sharing, everyone!

Delicious!! I made this for dinner tonight. I did, however, make a few changes- but only to make it more of a hotdish (yep, I'm from MN!). I used cream of mushroom soup because it's a staple in my cupboard and cream of broccoli isn't. I also didn't put the breadcrumbs on top. I actually forgot all about it but in the end I saved some calories. I added chopped onion, garlic powder and black pepper when sauteing the chicken. In addition to the cream of mushroom soup I added about 1/2 a cup of light sour cream- or a big spoonful. Lastly, I added about 2 cups of fully cooked brown rice. Mixed all of the ingredients together and baked for half an hour covered and took the lid off for the last 15 minutes. This was so creamy and delicious. I did not taste like something healthy, that's for sure! I would add lots more chicken next time- 1 1/2 cups wasn't quite enough. Over all, it was very very good and I'll definitely be making this again!

this was really good with a few tweaks. I added some fresh garlic, onions, and cauliflower to the mixture. I did not layer anything. I just mixed it all together.  Other changes included using 3 cheese bread crumbs, adding fat free sour cream, and using fat free soup. I baked it at 400 for half an hour. It was so good!

I of course made my own version of this, but used this as a base. I added some boiled potatoes chopped. I also seasoned the chicken (before cooking) with salt, pepper, paprika, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. I cooked this over high heat (like stir fry), I also added some chopped garlic at the end of the cooking for seasoning...and set it aside. I added shredded pepper jack/cheddar mix, since this is the only cheese I had. I made double the amount of bread crumb mix. On top of everything I added a sprinkle of paprika, and Italian Seasoning. YUM!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I enjoyed for supper, we had it to just try and change it up a little. It was good, but not the most flavorful cheesy dish ever. I was very creamy from the soup, in the future I would try adding spices of some sort. Not bad for a quick dinner though.

Good with the addition of sour cream, mushrooms, an onion and tons of basil, garlic and rosemary.  I could imagine that this would be very bland without taking some liberties with the core recipe.

A great recipe! I did add fresh sliced mushrooms before pouring the soup/milk mixture. Also, I cooked my chicken with garlic, salt and pepper. Made a great leftover dish too!

Very yummy and SO easy! The only thing I would suggest is definately adding some salt. I served it over rice but it would also taste great over baked potatoes. My husband loved it!

Pretty good concept; however, if I were to make this again, I would mix everything together, and maybe add pasta or rice.  The broccoli was bland with no seasoning.  I mixed the chicken in with the soup--which was mushroom soup instead of broccoli soup--and added sour cream as others suggested.  It also needed salt, pepper, and onion powder.  It was on the light side.  I like sauce and cheese.  Next time, I'll use more sauce and maybe even mix the cheese in with everything else.  Worth trying again.

very good I did follow some other's suggestions.  I pan fried the chicken in olive oil and added 1/2 an onion lemon juice fresh garlic salt and pepper and cooked until tender. I layered it on the bottom of the dish and then mixed cream of brocolli soup ad 1/2 cup of sour cream together added 1 pint of mushrooms and brocolli i layered that on top of the chicken covered w/cheese and bread crumbs served over brown rice. this recipe is great because you can easily substitute low fat ingdients w/out loosing flavor

I followed this recipe but increased the chicken broccoli because it's just a personal thing of not liking lots of sauce in my casseroles. I would add a few more spices next time but anything my stepson will eat leftovers of is worth putting in the monthly rotation! Thank you!

I will definately be making this again.  I did make a few changes for personal taste.  I added garlic powder while cooking the chicken, used frozen chopped Broccoli.. easier, and used one can of cream of onion soup instead of broccoli... family loves onions.  I put a slice of swiss cheese on my portion which was very yummy.  Served with a side of mashed potatoes.

Very Good!  I doubled the recipe so made a few mods based on reviews and what I had on hand.  I kept the broccoli the same doubled everything else.  I used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups and added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to it.  I used day old cornbread for the topping.  I just crumbled it up and put it on a baking sheet and put it in the oven while it was pre-heating to dry out a little.  I used more topping than called for since I wanted it to cover fairly well and I baked it in a 10x13 pan.  Easy recipe to adapt!

I used leftover chicken from a whole chicken. I did season it with lemon pepper, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. THe only thing I woul recommend is using frozen broccoli only if your going to soften it first. I've made recipes before where I just popped it in the oven but this time it wasn't soft even. Otherwise it was still great. Next time I'll try it with frsh broccoli.

This was very easy and good!  I baked 3 chicken breasts in the oven and then pulled it apart for use in the casserole.  Yum, the family loved it! You could also put french fried onions on top instead of the bread crumbs, I may try that next time!

This use to be my fav meal as a child. There are a few things that my mom did differently, however. She added curry to the cream of chicken and mayo and a splash of lemon juice. There were never bread crumbs but it is topped with cheese. YUM! The curry really adds that extra umph!

This was very tastey. I mixed the cheese in with the soup mixture, and used about 2 cups of cheese.Also instead of mixing the bread crumbs with butter, I just sprinkled about 1/2 cup on top. Will definitley make again.

I'm used to Chicken Divan made with Swiss cheese and wine, but this recipe was kid-friendly and pretty good.  Next time I'll make some adjustments based off other member's comments: add sour cream and more cheese.

This is a great meal for a working mom who needs a quick meal for the family!  My kids and husband loved it, we all had clean plates.  I made a few changes: used a 10oz. can of cooked chicken (makes it even quicker), added 1/2 c. sour cream, steamed the broccoli instead of boiling, and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of broccoli.  I also added a couple shakes of onion powder, pepper, and celery salt.  Mixed everything together in a big bowl then poured into an 8x8 baking dish, covered with more cheese, bread crumbs and sprayed the top with butter spray.  This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent as is. However, I would opt to use either fresh spinach or even frozen spinach the next time. The canned stuff, though it tasted all right, smelled/looks gross. Fresher is usually better. :)

I agree this is a good starter recipe and you can take it like it is or add your own twist to it to make it yours.  I used turkey cutlets cut into chunks and broccoli cheese soup.  I simply seasoned the turkey before cooking it, used heavy cream instead of milk and added a dash of curry.  I also cooked and combined everything in just one Dutch oven - barely any clean up! Gotta love that!

I have to admit, I didn't think this was going to turn out well.  It seemed easy enough so I thought I'd give it a try but it sounded a little dull.  I changed my mind after one bite.  It is so good.  I did cook the chicken with seasoning salt and onion powder for a little more flavor.  Other than that, I kept the recipe exactly the same and both my fiance and I thought it was excellent.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and liked it.  Tonight I decided to play with it a bit:  I had 3 cups of leftover chicken and used it all (I do use a long baking dish).  I added cream of celery soup to the cream of broccoli soup and milk.  I had about half a cup of corn niblets left in the fridge so I threw those in over the chicken layer.  I used a shredded cheddar-mozzarella mix over the top, plus a sprinkling of Reggiano parmesan. Finally, I was a bit generous with the butter and crumbs and mixed them until they were almost like a streusel in texture and put that over the top.  I baked it at 400 and waited until it was really nicely golden brown. Consequently, I just had two healthy portions of it and cleaned my plate.  I don't know how others will like this version, but oh, my, I think it is fantastic!

Good, but does need extra things added to it hence the lack of 5 star. Followed other reviewers. Added more bread crumbs, salt, pepper, seasoning mix, and garlic powder. More cheese too. Came out excellent and tasty!

Beyond delicious! I used a large can of chicken breast for convenience, it was quick, but didn't add much taste. I also added 1/3 reduced fat sour cream (which was an awesome suggestion!). I mixed the soup, sour cream, milk, and 2 % shredded sharp cheese in a large bowl, with garlic powder, onion powder, chicken boullion granules, and pepper. Tossed in the brocc and chicken, then added everything to the pan. Sprinkled with extra cheese.  Although I upped the breadcrumbs to 3 tbs it wasnt enough so next time I will use more. I think adding the sour cream made it a little runny, so next time I will use an extra ingredient to bulk it up

delicious! I did add a little more cheese due to personal preference. Also, might I suggest serving over rice so that it is a complete meal in and of itself.

This recipe was very good.  I did make a few changes.  I steamed the broccoli and sauteed the chicken with garlic salt and johnny's seasoning.  I used about three times the amount of cheese called for, used cream of chicken soup, added about 1/2 cup sour cream and mixed everything together. I put mixed cheese on top of the dish and used about twice the amount of bread crumbs (I crushed garlic and butter croutons for this).  The bread crumb topping really makes this recipe!

Great simple recipe. Here are the changes I meade.  First, I breaded (ital bread crumbs, parm cheese & seasoned salt) and sauteed the chicken in peanut oil.  Then chopped chicken into bite sized pieces.  Chopped then cooked the broccoli in sauteed garlic and butter. Poured COMushroom soup and milk mixture. Topped with cheddar cheese and buttered breadcrumbs.  Will definitely remake this recipe!!! I love the buttered bread crumb idea a lot better than crumbled crackers!

Great recipe and so easy to do.  I added about 3/4 cup sour cream as suggested in other reviews and it tasted great.  I didn't mix the butter and bread crumbs together, instead I sprinkled the bread crumbs and then ladled the melted butter over top.  I do suggest you use more brocoli than what is called for, it really cooks down.  You can make this ahead and then just add the soup mix and toppings when ready to bake.

I gave this four stars because it is a great base recipe. Like other reviewers, I added sour cream and cooking wine to the sauce. The presentation was beautiful, but I found that the finished product still needed a little bit of salt. WIth that being said I will make this again!

P.S. I also used ground chicken (cooked in garlic powder, black pepper, and Mrs. Dash seasoning) because its easier for me.

This recipe was delicious, I used stove top stuffing for the breadcrumbs for a little more flavor but this would be excellent with regular bread crumbs also.  My husband loved this recipe.

My family really loves this recipe; I use frozen chopped broccoli instead, (just add it frozen) and cook my chicken with black pepper and garlic powder.  I serve it over the frozen puff pastry  shells . . . so easy because they cook at the same temperature and almost the same amount of time.  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe!

I made this more into a casserole.  I shredded the seasoned chicken (with pepper and seasoning salt) after it was cooked with onion, garlic.  After reading some of the other reviews, I added Worchester sauce, 1/2 cup milk to the soup. I steamed 2 10 oz pkgs of frozen chopped broccolli instead of using fresh. I started the layering with egg noodles, just to make it an "all-in-one" meal.

I'll make this again, but probably do the following:

Add extra seasonings between the 'layers' of items.
Use condensed cheddar soup instead of broccoli soup.  (Just to see what happens)

This was such a great, easy and fast meal!!  But make sure to ADD lots of garlic powder and onion powder if you life flavor.  I also added a lot of crumbled ritz crackers to the top.  This was so good.  Thank you soooooo much for the recipe!!!

This was really good and filling.  The only thing I did differently was left off the breadcrumbs and didn't add salt.  I used leftover fajita chicken, so it didn't require any seasonings.  I tried it again using alfredo sauce instead of the cream soup (all I had on hand) and it tasted good that way, too.

I thought this was awesome but did make several additions which I found crucial. Along with 2 salted & peppered chicken breasts, I sauteed a diced white onion & 3 minced garlic cloves in olive oil (saute the chicken whole & slice when done to retain flavor/moistness). I quickly boiled 1 bag of frozen broccoli florets (just as good as fresh if cooking anyway), & used 1 can of cream of chicken soup plus 1 can of cream of asparagus soup (I happened to have this on-hand). To the sauce, I added both white pepper & garlic powder. I doubled the cheese, & also used Italian bread crumbs rather than plain. Serve over rice.

This was extremely tasty. I used boneless chicken thighs and baked them seasoned well with pepper,  seasoned salt, onion powder, and garlic salt.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead and added 1/2 cup of sour cream to my mixture.  Delicious!  I will double up on this recipe next time.

Very good!  I did make some changes -- When I cooked the chicken, I cooked it with 1 medium onion and garlic powder.  I doubled the sauce, so used 1 can of cream of chx soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup (both healthy request) and 2/3 cup of skim milk.  I also doubled the cheese and added 1/2 cup to the sauce.  Also to the sauce I added a splash of lemon juice and some fresh Parmesan cheese.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used 1/2 cup corn flake crumbs.  I cooked it in a 9x13 pan for 15 minutes at 450 and then 10 minutes at 350.  Served with rice.  Yummy!!!!

Yummy. We didn't have any milk (how does that happen?) I used Cream of Cheddar and Cream of Broccoli with a spoonful of sour cream to dump on top of rice, broccoli, and chicken. Nice comfort food that feels somewhat healthy.

This was delicious!  I used some leftover grilled chicken that I had already seasoned with chicken seasoning and garlic and I used fat free cheese in place of the shredded cheese.  I also added a dash of seasoned salt and garlic powder.  It turned out great-thanks for the recipe!

this is a staple in our home - def in our rotation! So easy and wins over the entire family, including my picky 3 year old and 5  year old!
I cooked my frozen chicken breasts in a crock pot with garlic salt, chicken broth and salt & pepper.  The chicken is amazingly tender cooked this way.  The last time I made this I did "shred" the chicken as someone recommended in another rating - I won't do it again - the casserole seemed too much like chicken salad.

I give this a 5 star but my hubby gives is a 3 hence the 4 stars.  If I could get my 2 little toddlers to sit down to eat, I'm sure they'd gobble it up. It is very tasty.  The sauce and cheese compliment both the brocolli and chicken.  And the bread crumbs are just the right amount of added crunch.  Great quick recipe for the family...thanks!

Love this recipe.  It is one of my families favorites. Try using one of the pre-roasted chickens from Costco.  It adds some great roasted flavor.  Also, I was in a pinch and had to use cream of chicken with garlic - MMMMM!  I never make it with the regular soup any more.

This was a very tasty recipe, easy to make, and a good way to get the husband to eat his broccoli.  Since I had to cook my chicken anyway, I went ahead and sauteed some onions with it and that added a lot of flavor to the dish.  I also used Panko instead of breadcrumbs to give it a nice, crunchy top.  I will definitely make this again.  Good comfort food!

My family and I didn't care much for this recipe. I drained the broccoli very well and it still ended up with quite a bit of liquid on the bottom.

This is one of the only meals from this site that I've made over and over again and been totally satisfied every time!  It's the perfect amount of effort after a long day of work, but it tastes good enough to make even when you aren't just trying to make something easy.  I have tried it with Cream of Celery and Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic, and the Celery is soooooooooo good!  It's the perfect flavor to set off the broccoli and the chicken and cheese.  I also salt the chicken cubes before pouring th other ingredients onto it so that it has some flavor of its own.  Perfect because you can really have this and not make anything else and still feel full and content!  I definitely recommend fresh broccoli instead of frozen, too.  It makes it taste like you put in a lot more effort!  Also, follow the advice to use at least double the bread crumb mixture, it adds a lot more texture and crunch.

Excellent!  Really yummy and easy to make.  I doubled the bread crumb/butter topping and more broccoli.  Served over rice cooked in chicken stock for a quick, satisfying meal.

I didn't like this recipe. I followed suggestions and cooked chicken with chopped garlic and a onion. I used cream of chicken soup because that was all I had. I added a bit of cayenne pepper for spiciness. I thought the sauce was clumpy and the dish lacked flavor. My spouse liked it more than I, which is why I will go with 2 starts.

This has become a weekly regular in our household.  I saute bite size chicken in Montreal Chicken seasoning, salt, pepper, and minced garlic.  I do not cook the broccoli beforehand.  I just chop it up and throw it in the casserole dish because I like my veggies a little crunchy.  Also, I omit the bread crumbs and cook it for 15 minutes and then add fried onions.  I let it cook for 5 more minutes.  The fried onions on top are sooo yummy!

Followed this recipe exactly using chicken from "Boiled Chicken" on this site. It was quick and tasted pretty good. Could use a bit more flavour, but not bad for a quick family dinner. Make sure you add lots of fresh ground pepper to the sauce.

This is an excellent recipe!  However, I made a couple changes!  Since I don't put this over rice or noodles I use about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs with a couple tlb of butter!  It really has a lot of texture that way and doesn't need anything else!  In order to cut down on calories I use 98% fat free cream of chicken!  In the past I've also used cheese & broccoli soup and that's great too!!!  Good way to get all your veggies in!

You definitely need to add some seasonings.  I had to add more cheese, it was not cheesy enough for me.  And I think it would be much better over rice.  I used cream of chicken instead of cream of broccoli.

This was a fantastic meal!  I did use the cheese of broccoli soup instead of the cream of broccoli for a more cheesy flavor. Also, we substituted sour cream for milk and added more cheese on top of the meal than what the recipe called for.  This is definitely a meal I will make again and will recommend this to friends and family.

Loved it. We didn't cook the broccoli first because we don't like mushy broccoli, and I would defanitely substitute mayo or sour cream for the milk. This one's going into the rotation.  Thanks!

This recipe was a big surprise!! I gave it four stars only because I ended up adding seasoning salt, lemon pepper, garlic powder, pepper and a couple dashes hot sause. With the changes I give it 5 stars. I do not think it would have been as good without the extra seasoning, but with, it was great!

I didn't have any leftover chicken, so I sautéed 2 chicken breasts with garlic, 1 medium onion and a dash of poultry seasoning.  I made this last night for a sick neighbor as well as us. It's a great size to make to give away.  Also I followed the recommendation to use some herb stuffing for topping…. This will be made in our house again. Thanks.

I cut back on the milk and added a tbsp of lite mayo to make it creamier.  I also added some black pepper and paprika to the soup mixture.  Italian bread crumbs added a good flavor.  This is a keeper and it's so simple!

I've made this recipe a few times.  I've used frozen broccoli instead of fresh, and grilled chicken instead of boiling.  I added more cheese, but that's because my family and I are big cheese eaters.

This recipe is very similar to my mom’s and it always reminds me of her.  It is a hit every time I make it for my husband and 16 month old son.

I cooked this last night and it turned out really well. I stuck to the base recipe, except for adding me bread crumbs to cover the whole thing and a bit more butter. If you dont mind making a recipe a bit more sinful, add an 8 ounce carton of sour cream to the chicken soup/milk mix.  You can also use crumbled up Ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs.

YUMMY, YUMMY.  I changed it a little.  I used cream of chicken soup and 1/3 cup of mayo instead of milk.  I also used 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  I also used leftover frozen broccoli, cauliflower, carrot combo instead of just broccoli.  I used 1 1/2 cup of crushed Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs mixed with 1/2 cup of melted margarine.

This is good & quick - perfect for left over chicken.  I increased the cheese & breadcrumbs and used frozen, chopped broccoli.  Next time I will increase the amount of chicken, too as my husband was still a little hungry after eating it.  Good recipe, thanks!

I played with this a bit and enjoyed.  It makes a good comfort food dish.  I used broccoli cheddar soup and because I was short on broccoli, I added some cooked pasta (al dente).  When I cooked the chicken I used lemon pepper, season salt, and some garlic powder (just dashes) for taste.  Was good.

Not sure about kid friendly rating because I don't have kids.  However, it was my mistake not do have doubled this receipe because my husband had helped himself to BIG helpings and it was almost gone.  Next time I'll just have to double the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Enlarged the amounts to make 6 servings, used cream of chicken bcs that's what I had, heavy cream instead of mild bcs I needed to use some up, and LUCKILY my leftover chicken was baked with crumbs!  So I repurposed them to this casserole.  Yummy!

Wow this is sooooo easy and so delicious. I’d say tweek it how ever you need too with what you have on hand. Recipes and life are not perfect each and every day right?  Good combo of ingredients and that’s what makes it good certainly not how it’s freaking rated.

I never use canned soup in any recipe.  It's easy to make your own sauce with chicken or beef broth, whipped cream cheese or heavy cream.

I used this recipe as a springboard.  Didn't have fresh or frozen broccoli, so I used some homemade broccoli soup I had in the freezer.  I steamed carrots to give it more veggie power.  I had a cup of leftover rice.  Mixed 1 1/2 cups shredded chicken, the carrots soup, and rice.  Microwaved it for 4-5 minutes to heat thru.  Mixed 3T of melted butter with 1 cup cornflake crumbs, spread it on top, and broiled it for 1-2 minutes, just to brown it up.  It was really good!  Would not have tried it w/o reading this recipe first.

I added some of Costco's Artichoke and Jalapeno dip to the soup mixture which added that extra cheese and a bit of a kick. I only steamed my broccoli for three minutes and think that was still too long, as it looked very well done and I like it with a bit of snap. I'll steam for two minutes next time.

It turned out really good. I don’t think the serving size for 6 fits. I had family 4, everyone wanted more I was still hungry. So next time I will double the serving size. Flavor was great!! Will be making again. I used shredded chicken instead of cube chicken.

Delish and super easy to make!

I should have dried the broccoli longer as it added some extra water, but it didn't hurt the taste at all.

Easy and really tasty.  It’s also easy to adapt to things you have.  It doesn’t change the basic recipe at all!  I used a steamable package of broccoli/cauliflower and 98% FF cream chicken soup, as I only had this.  I added garlic and onion powder, too.  I used Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar, also bread crumbs as directed.  It was beautiful and a definite repeat.

I made this and it was delicious. I used 1/2 can of cream of chicken with 1/3 cup whipping cream. It was plenty creamy and came out of the oven bubbling and toasted on top. We will definitely make this again. Perfect for left over rotisserie chicken.

Quick enough for a weeknight dinner and very tasty! I put 1 minced garlic clove & 4 chopped scallion stalks into a buttered pie plate with the broccoli, and doubled the amount of crispy bread crumbs on the top. I served it with jasmine rice on the side.

I made this as is, no adjustments. 
It tasted fine, but the quantities we're so off. A pound of broccoli and a cup and a half a chicken? It was basically just a bowl of broccoli. There wasn't enough 'sauce' and two tbs of breadcrumbs wasn't going to do anything to put a 'topping' on it.

I used chicken tenders which I browned first in a pan and chopped up. I also sauteed onions and celery in butter and added about a T worcestershire sauce, some cayenne and white pepper. I used both cream of chicken and cream of broccoli soup and a little milk. I used panko, shredded cheddar and butter for topping. it came out great

I doubled everything.  Used one can cream of broccoli one can cream of chicken and substituted one cup sour cream for the milk.  I used rotisserie chicken seasoned it with 1 teaspoon all seasoning spice, one teaspoon lemon pepper, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 3/4 cup chopped onion

This was a quick and easy weeknight dinner. I did make some adjustments. I sautéed t1.5 lbs chicken breast with an onion and two cloves of garlic, substituted cream of broccoli soup for cream of chicken and mushroom, used 1/3 cup milk and 1/2 cup sour cream like another reviewer suggested, doubled the amount of cheddar cheese, and mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl before putting it in an 8x8 casserole dish. I topped it with crushed Ritz crackers and parmesan cheese and served over rice. I thought it could've been a bit more flavorful so I will experiment with seasonings next time, but overall it was a satisfying, comforting meal.

My husband and I liked it, with a few changes. I did like another reviewer's suggestion which was mix it all together and put it in the casserole dish. (May I mention that I forgot to cook the broccoli? But it was great, it didn't get mushy.) I also found the need to use another can of creamed soup, I didn't want it to be too dry. And as for the topping, I used crushed Ritz crackers. That is usually my staple for a topping on a casserole.

Pretty bland. I even added onions to try to incorporate more flavor! Definitely would suggest seasoning the chicken before baking.

I love having a healthy casserole option. Just make sure you season however you like (chicken, broccoli, bread crumbs) and you’ll be happy with the results. My store was out of cream of broccoli so I used cream of celery. Think any cream soup would work just fine. I mixed all the ingredients (except bread crumbs/butter) together, then topped with a little more cheese and the bread crumb mixture. Wasn’t sure a pie plate would be large enough so I used a 2.5 qt. casserole dish. Honestly the only thing I would do differently next time is season a little more. Used salt, pepper, garlic, and parsley, tastes good just needs more.

I was worried about flavor because the recipe didn't call for any spices. It is actually very good and doesn't really taste like a low-calorie option. It was easy to make and baked in no time. I used frozen broccoli because that's what I had and it was fine. I'm on a 1200 calorie a day lifestyle and I could actually have to portions of this.

Thanks for the recipe. Only 2 changes- I used wine with chicken broth (1/2 cup) in place of the milk and I used crumbled Ritz crackers w/out the butter for the topping. Served with rice.

Tasted great with all the extra suggestions listed in the reviews. I used cream of chicken, cheese in mixture, lots of spices, and mixed it all together. I will make this again as even my two year old had seconds.

This was really good!! I used 2 cans of canned chicken instead of fresh chicken, and used cream of chicken soup instead of cr. of broccoli.  I also used a whole bag of cheese and garlic crouton , crushed, instead of bread crumbs.  Was really easy and fast. Next time double the recipe because it barely makes enough for 4.

I made this tonight.  My husband and I liked it and I will likely make it again.  Based on previous reviewers, I made the following changes to the original recipe:  I used Cream of Mushroom soup.  I also sauteed chopped shiitake mushrooms and 1/2 sweet onion and added that to the soup.  I added 1/2 tsp. seasoned salt, 1/4 tsp. pepper and 1 tsp dried thyme.  I mixed the soup, milk and seasonings in a bowl, along with the 1/2 c. shredded Cheddar cheese.  I poured that on top of the broccoli that I had steamed in the microwave for 3 minutes on high.  I added an additional 1/4 shredded cheese on top of the mixture and sprinkled the seasoned bread crumb and butter mixture over that.  I baked it in an 8" square Pyrex pan at 425 degrees for 16 minutes.    Changes I would make for the future would be to microwave the broccoli for an additional 30 seconds and add 1/2 cup cooked chicken.  To those who have been critical of people not rating the recipe as written, I strongly disagree.  It was clear to me in reading the recipe that there would not be enough flavor and that seasoning would be needed.  Why not benefit from the experience of other cooks and accept their recommendations?  It doesn't change the value of the original recipe.  I appreciate hearing the feedback from others as well as getting inspired to cook something new.  Thank you to the original poster and for everyone else to contributed to a nice recipe.

To make this recipe a more, low carb friendly took the advice of one of the other members and used chicken soup and mayo and omitted the milk.  I also added parmesan cheese and garlic to the soup/mayo mix.  This base recipe can go in so many tasty directions.

Thanks for posting!

This is a quick and perfect dinner. I've made this at least 10 times. One thing I did was put French's Fried Onions across the top instead of the buttered bread crumbs. Either way, this should become a staple in your house too.

Got my grandkids to eat and like broccoli. They don't like a heavy sauce, so there was no complaints. Excellent flavor and easy to make.

We eat this up over egg noodles or rice. Super easy recipe if you use frozen broccoli.

This was my favorite dinner growing up! I ask for it even now for my birthday dinner. My mom made it slightly different but this one is still good!

TIP: amazing when served with cranberry sauce!

I followed the instructions all the way but it lacks something.  It's a bit bland and the soup mixture needs to be doubled to give it enough to surround the chicken and broccoli.  Good starter recipe.

I made many of the modifications suggested in other reviews, and it was absolutely delicious!  For those of you complaining about other reviewers (who make modification suggestions and rate the recipe based on how it turned out with those modifications), you can always buy a recipe book off of Amazon or go to many of the other recipe websites which do not allow for this. What I love about Allrecipes.com is that I can glean from everyone else's experience and find the very best version of the recipe without having to make it multiple times. I always read the reviews, and use many of the suggestions. Thank you to everyone who shares your recipe modifications on here!!!

Read reviews & made a few changes. Used about 2 c shredded chicken from the freezer (11 oz), 1# fresh broccoli (steamed in microwave X 5 min), 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1 1/2 c sharp cheddar cheese (what I had), 1/2 c of milk & sour cream each, and added 1/2 t of onion powder, garlic powder, & little bit of rosemary, thyme, & parsley flakes plus ground pepper. Mixed it all & put in 9X13, added crushed ritz crackers on top. Covered with foil & cooked at 450 X 15 min. Then removed foil & broiled X 2 min to brown crackers. Served with white rice. It was a hit!

This recipe was excellent.  I did make a couple of changes based on other reviews though.  I used cream of mushroom soup because that's what I had on hand.  Also, a package of frozen broccoli in place of the fresh.  Crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  I served it over brown rice.

If I make it again, I will add more breadcrumbs and probably use marinated cooked chicken.  It was definitely easy.

I didn't intentionally make changes, but ultimately I did.  I didn't have cream of broccoli soup, so sub' cream of mushroom , had some left over steamed white rice, so added that on the bottom.  Recipe didn't call for any seasoning, but I added a little garlic powder, Italian seasoning, pepper and just a couple dashes of salt!  I think it improved the overall flavor. First time I've made this... It's my new leftover fav!  EVERYTHING except the can of soup was a leftover !  Sort of felt like I fed 4 people for the cost of the soup!  : )

Doubled the recipe and added a tad more cheese.  Used breadcrumbs on half and French's onions on the other....preferred the onions.  Next time will add cooked carrot slices and water chestnuts for a little extra crunch!

This is a dead easy recipe.  Have made it a few times with leftover rotisserie chicken.  I use frozen broccoli if fresh isn't good enough and don't need to cook it first, just drained any water.  Tasty and easy.

This wasn’t as good as I expected it to be. It was bland in taste and maybe adding pasta would give it more depth. There was just something missing for us.

I used this as the filling for a quiche, except I added a lot more cheese than the recipe required, and used Italian bread crumbs (since we didn't have any regular bread crumbs around). It was awesome, and my husband loved it!

I love this recipe! Made it tonight and followed the recipe pretty exact. My husband added some pepper when he was cooking the chicken, I used broccoli cheddar soup (as that's what we had in the house) and we used tex mex shredded cheese (again, that's what we had in the house). Very good! 

Next time I would add some onion/garlic when cooking the chicken to just add a little something extra. But otherwise I really enjoyed this recipe. Would definitely make it again.

Recipe was great with some mods due to availability. Cream of asparagus soup instead of broccoli, smacked in a random assortment of vegetables on top of the broccoli. Added a little bit more breadcrumb and cheese due to the shape of my cooking dish. Really simple to make using steamed frozen vegetables. Will definitely make this again.

I make this exactly like the recipe says and it is so delicious!  For my chicken, I use 2 pounds of chicken thighs boiled and deboned--I think the dark chicken meat gives it a richer flavor.  This also freezes well for future lunches or dinners!

Hubby and 17 year old both liked it. I thought it was decent too. Not  raving about it, but definitely decent. The flavors definitely blended more than I expected and did taste like a casserole vs. just broccoli with cheese. I would love some more crunch too it, and would probably double the bread crumbs next time. I also doubled the soup/milk because it didn't seem like it was going to be juicy enough and doubled the cheese too...we love cheese! Told my hubby I thought adding some water chestnuts for crunch would have been good. Celery might add a weird flavor, but I feel like water chestnuts have lots of crunch and a pretty mild flavor.

Soooo Good! I read a few comments and did what they suggested, sautéed onions with minced garlic, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne and mustard powder. I also put everything in a bowl together before putting in a dish. To be healthier I used low fat condensed chicken soup, light cheddar cheese and pano crumbs. And did double the crumb mixture and added cheese. I loved this and will defiantly make it again.

I made this last night and it was delicious! I had a bag of frozen broccoli with cauliflower. I never would have thought to use cauliflower in it, but it was very tasty! With frozen veggies, no need to cook them first! I omitted the butter and sprinkled seasoned bread crumbs on top. Easy, quick and delicious!

Switched brocoli soup for cream of celery.  Added fresh parsley to the soup and tex mex cheese instead of cheddar which added flavor.

I have made this a few times now and is my go to casserole. Only change I make is to season the chicken once it is in the casserole pan. I use 1 LARGE chicken breast which is about a pound precooked. I am sure there are a thousand things that could be done to alter recipe but for me, aside from salt, it works just fine as written.

I loved this recipe and I will absolutely make it again. The ONLY change I made was spicing up my chicken with garlic/onion powder, smoked paprika and chilli seasoning.

Excellent way to use rotisserie chicken leftovers!  Made the recipe as given except I didn't have broccoli soup and used mushroom instead.

It was easy & delicious, :) I only modified a couple of things, I sautéed the chicken breast in a little olive oil with some spices ( garlic, parsley, adobo, paprika, salt & pepper)  and a little white whine, than proceeded with written recipe

Pretty good recipes but I thought it lacked a bit of flavor.  Maybe  more salt and pepper and possibly a bit of garlic next time.

This is really good.

I don't care for reviews that change the ingredients.  They should post their own recipe if they want their own stage.  If you can't post a review based on the recipe submitted, then don't post!

Awesome!.  It is one of my regular favorites.  Whenever cooking chicken breasts, I always cook an extra one wrapped in foil.  Then I freeze, & save it with this recipe in mind.  Economical, nutritious & delicious.  No changes made.

My family enjoyed this.  After reading reviews I added sour cream, lemon pepper, roasted garlic powder, pepper, and a little salt to the soup mixture.  I doubled the bread crumb mixture and cooked it in a larger pan than called for.  Next time I'd definitely add sautéed onions and I like the idea of another reviewer for using the Chicken with Herb condensed soup rather than cream of broccoli, I think it would have been much more flavorful.

I make this all the time, but I use cream of mushroom soup.  I mix the soup with mayo, garlic and lemon juice.  Mixed all together and pour over the broccoli , chicken and rice...bake!  I love the bite of the lemon!

Since I needed to come up with a quick dinner, I used deli chicken, frozen broccoli and Cream of Chicken Soup.  I did add some Bell's Poultry Seasoning and seasoned salt to perk up the dish a bit.  In lieu of breadcrumbs, I used crushed salt-free potato chips.  Everything came from my fridge or pantry to create a very pleasing meal.

I thought it was pretty good. I followed recipe except I didn’t think 1batch would be enough for husband Work leftovers so I doubled but only had 1 can cream broccoli so I mixed with 1 can cream chicken since chicken was another main ingredient. I mixed in bowl together with milk before adding on top of chicken and broccoli. I make white rice to put casserole on top of. I thought it was a pretty good, easy weeknight meal. Will pass recipe along to others

This was a pleasant surprise! It was super tasty and super easy! I cooked my chicken cubes in salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and a dash of onion powder to add flavor. Also salted the mixture just a bit. It was perfect!

This recipe is DELICIOUS !!!  I made the following changes (based on prev reviews,,,, don't shoot me):  Cut two chicken breasts into cubes and fried in hot oil in pan until browned; seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper and garlic powder; steamed broccoli for 5 mins; did TWO cans of soup (either Crm of Broccoli or Crm of Chicken) into a bowl along with 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup milk. Layered a glass 9 x 13" baking dish with broccoli, then  chicken, then soup mixture, then another 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  Double the recipe for bread crumbs and sprinkle on top !!!  UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS !!!  Thank you for sharing this with us !!!

Only changes I made were to preparation involved cooking the broccoli in the microwave and chicken in large pieces and then using scissors to dice them both down into smaller pieces quickly. Added extra cheese. Delicious and simple enough.

This is a great recipe as is. But I'm going to add a note here about the cubed chicken. Not being one of those people completely changing the recipe! BUT! You need to season your chicken when you cook it. Don't buy precooked chicken, buy FRESH chicken and cook it in olive oil with ample seasoning. Nothing will ruin a dish like bland chicken. I used a premixed meat seasoning, but a basic blend of anything garlic, onion, salt and pepper will do it. 

Also I like to kinda shred/cut my chicken. Cubed chicken is too rough! Mess it up a bit when you're cutting it. Other than that, I made the recipe according to the instructions and loved it! Served it beside a little white rice. Fantastic meal.

w/o broccoli, which is really good so I decided to try this b/c of broccoli added to get the veggies. It's one of my favorite dishes.

I made this but I made a few changes to make it a little more filling!! I doubled the recipe and added brown rice. I didn't have cream of broccoli but I had cream of chicken and it was still delicious! I think I had too many breadcrumbs though, because the taste of them were a little overwhelming. But all in all excellent dish!!!

Double the recipe fits nicely into a 11x13 pan. A great way to use up leftover rotisserie chicken. I steamed the broccoli instead of boiling. Tasted delicious.

I sauted chicken in olive oil, seasoned with Montreal chicken, fresh tarragon, garlic powder, with onions, added broccoli,then sour cream,soup, milk and cheese.  This was a great starting point recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I love it. Of course I tweaked it using mayo and lemon juice in addition to cream of chicken soup and milk. But did everything else as original recipe stated. Great way to use up leftover chicken. It gets a high five from me.

I added rice, mushrooms, 2/3 cup of milk rather than 1/3,  a second can of soup, and squeeze of fresh lemon. I think next time I would fry up the mushrooms first as I didn't think they were cooked enough. It was great!

With the suggested modifications, this was absolutely delectable! I steamed 5 cups frozen broccoli and sautéed about 10 oz. seasoned chicken breast on the stove. Meanwhile, I mixed 1 cup cream of mushroom soup by Pacific (lower calorie), 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/3 cup 2% milk, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese, garlic salt, paprika, and onion powder to taste. Mixed in broccoli and chicken, topped with another 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup Ian's gluten free croutons. Makes about 4 servings at 300 calories per serving. Delicious!

As is, it's ok. I try to follow the recipe exactly the first time I try something. Next time I will try doctoring it up. It needs some kind of zip or tang, maybe mix a little mayo or sour cream in the soup/milk mixture.

Turned out great! Even the kids like it. May try with cheddar cheese soup next time for a different flavor. Would also be good with sour cream and some onion.

I was looking for something to do with leftover meat from a roasted chicken beside the usual chicken salad.  This was perfect.  After reading other reviews, I added some lemon pepper and curry powder.   I had all ingredients on hand except cream of broccoli soup.  I used what I had in the pantry which was cream of mushroom.   The result was delicious.

I didn't have cream of broccoli soup; so I used cream of chicken soup, and added some of the broccoli water/broth and chicken broth from cooking the chicken, to the soup.  I also added heavy cream instead of the milk and  Buttered the dish before adding the ingredients.   A keeper!

I made it exactly how the recipe instructed. It's a pet peeve of mine that people rate a recipe on here yet don't follow it. It was great. My children and I loved it. My only suggestion is to explain how to cook the chicken. It wasn't an issue for me, but it could have been an issue for a beginner since it wasn't explained in the written recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This came  out great.    Very easy to make and quick to bake.  Tasted great and I had to hold myself back from eating it all.  

The only changes I made were to include chicken breasts and skinless chicken thighs.  I lightly seasoned the meat too.  The next time I make this I think I will add a layer of cheese on top of the broccoli and then on top of the chicken.

This came out delicious. I only cooked for 2, so I made some changes. I eyed the broccoli and chicken, but left the rest per measurements. I cooked the chicken in a citrus olive oil from France, and topped it with herbs. It smelled amazing while cooking. When I was ready to put everything in the oven, I poured the chicken l over the broccoli instead of scooping, and just a little bit of the olive oil dripped out. The broccoli soaked it up and added some great flavor! Because I used less chicken I didn't cook it in the oven as long either, but if you go by the "bubbling" it should come out perfect. I'll definitely make this again!

I probably won't make this recipe again without changes.  I followed the original directions for the most part, but I did add 1/2 c. sour cream to the mix.  I thought there was too  much creamed broccoli flavor overpowering the dish and it was a bit mushy.   I would use cream of chicken soup and at least double the bread crumb topping if I tried it again.

Great recipe! I didn't have cream of broccoli so I used cream of chicken and I used both shredded cheddar and shredded mozzarella. Also instead of using a pie plate, I used a rectangle baking dish. So easy to make and it looked beautiful when done. Not to mentioned it tasted delicious!

I read some of the other reviews before I made this, so I made a couple changes as well. I added some sour cream, garlic powder, and lemon juice, in addition to the milk, to the sauce mixture. Other than that, I followed the directions and it turned out pretty good! My husband also enjoyed it, which was a plus. I'd say this is a keeper. I knocked off a star since I think the recipe as written would be kinda bland.

This was an easy dish to make and done in less than an hour. I took the advice of other readers and seasoned the chicken with garlic, season salt, and lemon pepper. It was flavorful and filling. I served it with a dinner salad.

I modified the recipe slightly to the soup mixture...by using Campbell's cream of chicken and mushroom, added 5 tablespoons of sour cream, and a little bit of garlic salt . Yummy!!!

My family liked this quite a bit and I will make it again. After reading reviews that stated the recipe was bland, I made the following changes. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, paprika and Italian seasoning before baking. I also used the Cream of chicken with herbs soup in place of cream of broccoli.

I'm giving this four stars because I felt the need to tweak the recipe to my own taste, but the idea is spot on. I added 2.5 cans of condensed soup and chose a mix of cream of broccoli, broccoli cheese, and cream of chicken. I'd say if the three, broccoli cheese was my favorite. I used the cream of chicken to go with the chicken I just cooked. I simply boiled the chicken, and added the soup/salt to taste with the rest of the dish. After I finished cooking, I felt like the dish needed more salt so I generously sprinkled before serving. I feel like it made a big difference so next time I'll be adding more salt to the meal before cooking.

The base recipe tasted good, quick and easy. However, I wanted a little more flavor with the chicken so while cooking it, I added probably a little less than a table spoon of hot sauce (sriracha) and a bit of tumeric, maybe about a teaspoon.

A good basic recipe to start, but I also added spices. Garlic powder for one. The chicken breast was grilled the day before with salt and pepper.  I also added mushrooms with the steamed broccoli since I love them.

I added the changes that Patty suggested.  Mine came out a little watery, but after sitting for a little mixed in better with the soup mixture.  My daughter loved it and said it was one of her favorites.

So easy and a great taste.  Very fast and the family loves it. My 9 year old son thought it was yummy. I will serve with a carb side dish next time. We were hungry later since I only served it with a Caesar side salad. I just added onion powder, pepper and garlic salt to the chicken while I cooked it

We did twice as many bread crumbs/butter. We added parmesan cheese on top. We seasoned the chicken chunks while cooking them and the broccoli after it was cooked and in the pie dish. Delicious and when you have the team work... That much more fun and quicker!

Fine for a quick meal but not very creamy.  I have another recipe that is creamier that I have been making for years.  This is fast and easy but not quite as good as my old, longer and more complicated recipe.

This is a great base to start with i added 1 dry ranch packet and sour cream to the sauce mix and I am on a low carb diet so instead of bread crumbs I added parmesan cheese with the melted butter to give the crunch on top and fresh chix breast sauted (cooked) with 1 fresh squeezed  lemon juice(from lemon) salt ,pepper.   Amazing !!!

I used 2 lbs chicken tenders, parboiled, and seasoned heavily with paprika, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic salt. Doubled the remaining ingredients to fit perfectly in a 9" x 13" baking dish, sprayed with Pam. Served atop rice. Very good.

I had to improvise; didn't have the broccoli soup and had to use chicken soup instead. But it worked out well. The food was delicious. No complaints from the family. Next time I'll make sure I have broccoli soup. See if they can tell the difference!

Excellent, with a few additions! I sauteed onions, celery, garlic with the chicken. Didn't have cream of broccoli soup so used cream of chicken. Will also try cream of mushroom next time. Omitted the bread crumb topping. Tasty dish. Thanks for your post.

This is a perfectly easy recipe that lends itself well to added spices to suit  your taste.  I tossed in a chopped jalapeno and since I couldn't find cumin in my spice cabinet, added a mild curry instead, plus salt and pepper.  I used sharp cheddar, too.  Normally when I cook, my husband says "It's OK."   This dish got a "This is good!"  I think next time I'll steam my broccoli as I find it easier to test it's done-ness, and I'll add a bit more chicken.  But this is a keeper.

This recipe was great!  Only thing I did additional was add kosher salt and pepper to season the chicken prior to cooking it.  Will definitely add to the rotation.

The recipe came out very well.  We thought that there was a little too much broccoli and we would probable reduce it less next time.

Yes i made a few changes but it was excellent - First, I doubled the broccoli and chicken - I mixed the soup (1 can cream of chicken) with cream cheese and sour cream (about 1/2c and 1/4c respectively- eyeball it) Blended with a little milk to create liquidity.  Left off the bread crumbs - a delicious fairly low carb dish that serves six easily.

I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of broccoli and garlic and cheese croutons (crushed) instead of bread crumbs. I'm a huge fan of cheese so I layered it after each addition to casserole. 
My Husband loved it!!

This is a simple recipe and tastes just great.  I made it last night and my family is requesting I make it again tonight.  That never happens.  

The only adjustment I will make the second time is to add more butter/bread crumbs as when baked, they are outstanding.

So tasty!  Made with leftover grilled chicken breasts.  Couldn't find cream of broccoli so used cheese broccoli soup.  Seasoned the fresh broccoli with seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning as I like things with lots of flavor. Also used Italian flavor Panko crumbs.  So easy and what a wonderful way to use your leftover chicken!!

Loved this recipe!  I usually come to AllRecipes looking for ideas for what I have in the house, so I made a few substitutions but will come back and make it as it's written in the future.  Nice recipe, whole family loved it.

This was an easy "pantry"  recipe, and our small family liked it very much. This was a night when we needed to use what was on hand. I used a large 13 oz. can of chicken breast, fresh head of broccoli, soup and shredded cheese I did add about 1/2 cup of sour cream, as other suggested. I seasoned with garlic pepper and a couple squirts (2 tsp) of Amore Herb Paste. Followed recipe aside from that. 
Not for company, but an easy quick dinner. Thanks much!

I've been making one close to this but I brown the chicken ( I use cutlets) in a little butter. The soup I use is cream of chicken to that I add 3/4 cup of mayonnaise half a lemon juiced1/2 tsp of curry. You put the browned chicken in a baking dish then the broccoli that has been steamed pour the sauce over the chicken. Then top with 3/4 cup of bread crumbs mixed with a teaspoon of butter and a cup of cheddar cheese.  Bake at 350 for 30 min yummy hot or cold.

My wife is gluten-free and since most cream soups have wheat, this doesn't work for us.  We made more of a cheese sauce and put this on top of garlic quinoa.  Great.

this is really good ! I didn't have broccoli so I substituted green beans and it turned out well. I think it's a good recipe that allows vegetable flexibility as well. l served it over rice. will make again ! thank you ?

This recipe turned out very yummy--a comfort dish for sure! I however, had to make some changes as I didn't have all the exact ingredients. I had a condensed potato soup, mozzarella cheese and corn flake crumbs to use instead. While cooking my chicken, I used salt, pepper and McCormick's Garlic and Herb seasoning. Even with my changes, the recipe was delicious and hearty. The ONLY thing I might add to the mix would be a chopped onion for a little extra flavor. My husband really enjoyed this dish as well. Thanks for the lovely dinner!

This was a great low carb meal for my family. I used cream of mushroom soup since I did not have any cream of broccoli or cream of chicken. I was good my husband even liked it. Next time I will use the right soup cause I think it would give a better flavor. Also I don't know what the breadcrumbs were for since when I mixed them with the butter they clumped up and didn't spread very well. Will not be using those next time.

I have made this recipe several times. I followed the recipe as written except I have tried cream of mush room soup and cream of broccoli soup and cream of chicken soup and they' all work out good. We love this recipe and never get tired of it. It is so easy! Leftovers freeze well too :)

Using what I had on  hand, I used frozen broccoli spears, cream of chicken soup and cheddar cheese crackers for the topping.  Added chopped garlic to the sauce.  This was amazing!  So easy and so good!  Husband loved it and we have enough for leftovers.  Will definitely make again ....

I have made many times but have changed up a bit.  Melt butter in you casserole dish in oven at 350, I use steam fresh broccoli flowerettes cooked.  Put them on mthe melted butter.  Next add 2 cups of chicken diced on top of the broccoli.  Mix  1 can of ccream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup 1cup of mayonaisse 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp or to taste of curry powder.  Pour mixture over the chicken.  Top with shredded cheddar cheese bake bakee for 25-30 minutes.  Absolutely delicious not lacking any flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it tasted great. I used leftover chicken from a roasted chicken I made over the weekend. Perfect recipe to transform the roasted chicken. Definitely a keeper!

I made exactly as the recipe. I did use tenderizer on the chicken  for 30 min before grilling it on my counter top grill.  Served it at a pot luck tonight and it was all eaten.

This was very good but, I did make some changes. I kind of combined it with Paula Deans recipe for Chicken Divan that I found posted online. Only because I felt this recipe needed a bit more to it. However, the basic is here and is a great starting point! I also added some whole wheat noodles so that I could have a starch without making a separate side. :0). Thanks so much for posting this. I found the dish to be very good!!!

I will definitely make this again! I also seasoned my chicken with garlic salt and used the cream of broccoli like the recipe called for.  I added sour cream since the reviews said to, but not sure it made a big difference.  Increased the cheese, served with rice and it was delicious!  Could go well with pasta too!

I just made this tonight and served it with a salad.  Delicious- followed recipe except I used Campbell's Cheddar Broccoli Soup, added a few sliced green onions and it was perfect.  Thought there would be leftovers- wrong!   I chose this recipe because it was quick and easy and I will make it again!!!

My husband and I thought it was really tasty.  I substituted Cream of Celery for Cream of Broccoli soup, which gave it a unique taste.  I also topped it with french onions instead of bread crumbs.  I'll make it again.

I basically combined this recipe with Mamaw's chicken casserole recipe to make a more full meal and its great! I cooked a cup (dry) of rice and added that and a can of cream of mushroom, doubled the chicken, cooked onions and celery, onion and garlic powder, lemon pepper, and skipped the breadcrumbs. Yes, this makes it hard to judge the original recipe but for a good casserole idea its great and not a big mystery what it may taste like.

I made this recipe to the T and it was bland. I read some reviews and made some changes to spruce it up and it still was a bit bland, although my husband said he liked it just fine. I must say, definitely double this recipe if you like to have leftovers, and add cheese to the mix and then additional cheese on top. I used the Ritz crackers and butter topping and almost tripled the amount required, but I still think it could have used more. (It was my favorite part actually).

Great recipe! Next time I'll probably add more soup and top with cheezit crackers or goldfish rather than the bread crumbs and cheddar cheese.

I made half of this recipe, freezing the other half of the broccoli soup to use in something else later.  The only changes I made to the recipe were to add the cheese to the soup/milk mixture, cut back on the butter, and used more panko.  I also lowered the oven temp to 350.  This had good flavor, but the broccoli really becomes overcooked, so I doubt I’ll make it again.

This was pretty good. I would give it a 3.5.  It just needed a little more flavor.  I added a little more broccoli and chicken and used cream of chicken soup because that is what I had.  I added some garlic powder and mixed everything together.  I don't think it matters, just personal preference. Used a square baking dish instead of a pie plate.  It was even better the next day.  I would make it again.  Maybe add some white wine to the sauce next time.

Made a couple changes--use 2 cans lite cream of chicken soup, 1/2 c. Mayo, 1 T. Lemon juice. Do not dilute soup. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. One minute before baking is complete, sprinkle with 1 can O&C onion pieces and bits. Bake one more minute. Voila! Fabulous-family favorite.

When I try a recipe I ask the family if they want it in the "rotation".  The verdict was yes! I made it EXACTLY as written, so if I want to lighten up on the amount of sauce, add more spices, and so forth I can, but we also like it as is. For a recipe with canned soup in it, it's quite tasty.

I made the recipe as written. Just wasn't anything special. If I were to make again I would use a different soup. (Cream of chicken) The broccoli flavor dominated the dish. Hubby wanted a full cup of cheese. Easy and quick to prepare.

This was pretty good, but like everyone else I made a few adjustments. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic and cooked it on the stove in some coconut oil. I used extra broccoli and two cans of soup, so I guess I kind of doubled it? I used one can of cheddar cheese soup and one can of cream of broccoli. I added 4 ounces of cream cheese to the soup/milk mix as well. I really liked it, but next time I will use three cans of soup.

Added 1/3 cup cream cheese to my homemade white sauce in place of the canned soup which I can't get here. The white sauce has 1/4 cup fine chopped onion sautéd.

I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chicken when cooking it and it probably could have used more. It was a little bland.  I would also add more cheese inside, but that will add to the calories.

This was good, but I think it needed doctored up a lot to fit our tastes.  I added in some chopped onions, garlic, sour cream, and some extra seasonings but it still was just okay for us.  I think it would be good with some cream of mushroom or chicken in place of the cream of broccoli soup mix.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this with modifications based on posted reviews and what I wanted to do.  Came out great and the family loved it!!  Definitely comfort food.  I added 1c onion, big scoop sour cream, 28oz. total broccoli, 2 cans soup total (condensed mushroom and condensed chicken) (I like this more creamy - better for noodle sauce), maybe 2+ tbsp Ms. Dash garlic and herb seasoning, 1 handful Velveeta shredded cheese to casserole, 1 handful sharp cheddar on top, 1/2 tube Ritz crackers on top.  Served with penne pasta per family member request.  Yum!

If you love broccoli then this is the recipe for you! It was creamy and heavy on the broccoli. I did not have leftovers.  Most of my family loved it but a few wanted more vegetable variety in it next time.

My wife and I really liked this dish. Very easy to make and a good way to get my teenagers to eat some broccoli . I did make some changes. Sautéed chicken breasts in white wine,garlic and seasonings. Used low sodium cream of chicken soup and did not mix bread crumbs with butter. Very tasty!

I really loved it..my kids not so much, and I have no idea. Definitely thought it would be something they loved, since they love all the components. Only thing I did extra was seasoned the chicken and sautéed an onion as well...everything else was exactly as written. I froze the mass amount of leftovers for myself since they wanted to be weirdos about it.

I made this with a handful of changes. First, I did not have a pie pan, so I used a 9-inch cast iron skillet instead. It worked fine. I also didn't have quite enough broccoli, so I added about 1/2 cup of chopped uncooked yellow squash before adding the chicken. It came out great, but I think it would have been better to mix the cheese in with the soup mix and stir everything together, so that the cheese would cook around all the veggies and chicken, instead of on top. We ended up with a situation where the cheese slid off each scoop in one stuck-together piece and wasn't integrated into the dish. Next time I will try preparing it a little different. Over all very good!

I doubled the recipe, it was delicious and really simple.  I used a cooked chicken that I picked up at the grocery store.  I probably tossed in more cheese, because my kids love cheese.

I added cooked chopped onion and mushrooms to it. I add onion to every thing.... I found it still needing more taste. I will make again as I had made it for company that really liked it. I will add some garlic and seasoning to it. 
Very quick and easy to make.

So good and so healthy (but doesn't taste healthy). I steamed the broccoli and made sure to break it up into smaller pieces beforehand. I also added a little extra cheddar cheese on top.

So simple and one of my families favorites! I mix everything and then top with cheese, I have also started using condensed broccoli cheese soup because it is what I always have on hand. This is one we make every other week. I usually serve with rice.

I used the Tyson Grilled and Ready Chicken Breast strips and cut them into cubes,  and it made this even easier to throw together. I did add pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to the cream of broccoli soup mixture -- just to add a little bit more flavor. This is the perfect meal to make on a busy week night, as it is quick to put together and it is very tasty!

I made it as follows:  sauted the chicken with garlic, onions, season salt, pepper and oregano.  Added 1/4 cup of sour cream, lots more cheese to the mixture, combined everything and placed into a greased 8x8 dish.  Topped with more cheese and lots more buttered panko breadcrumbs.

Made it exactly as the recipe dictates! It was good. A little bland so I'd add a few more spices to the chicken as it is cooking, I think. Would make again.

I made it pretty much as written except I substituted frozen broccoli which is not as good.   It was a quick easy recipe to make after a day of work but bland.  Adding additional salt helped but next time I make it I will use some of the suggestions given by others.

Easy enough for my husband to do and it didn't take him a long time. Used cream of chicken instead of celery. It lacked real substance though. Maybe he used too much cheese. The second time I made this, I used cream of broccoli and used 12 ounces of corn in addition to the broccoli. That gave it the good substance I was looking for the first time. It would be good to add cooked quinoa or rice too. I also used crumbled whole wheat Ritz crackers, no butter. Yum!

I tried this last night.  Even while preparing the ingredients it did not smell right.  I believe it was the cream of broccoli soup from Campbell’s.  Just about every recipe I have tried from Allrecipes have been great but this one was a bummer.

I've made a commitment to cook more and eat out less, so finding a recipe like this is a gold mine.  In less than 45 minutes, dinner was ready!  (Ease of prep led to the 5 star rating.). I followed the recipe as written, except  I seasoned my chicken prior to cooking.  I also used cream  of chicken soup instead of the cream of broccoli (I didn't have any).   The casserole turned out very well.  This recipe is going into a regular rotation at my house.

I did not hesitate to embellish the recipe with my experience in cooking. I used celery soup- gives another accent of flavour, added one small minced onion to the sou mixture. a bit ore crumbs and cheese and added tblsp fresh minced parsley. Made it more of a deep dish than a pie plate. 
Next time I may add some fresh sliced mushrooms. Served with rice. supper easy as I bought vacuumed packed cooked chicken breast from Costco that had a good roasted flavour. Should have added a bit seasoning and pepper. This can be easily increased in volume. If doing so use one can of celery and one can of cream of onion.

Used garlic powder, onion powder, Tony Chacere, added a little smoked Gouda to cheddar cheese.
Used broccoli cheese soup. Steamed broccoli 2 minutes in microwave. Mixed all with pasta, then baked. Amazing!!  Next time will mix with rice.

I made this 99% like the recipe  but added a teaspoon of instant onion and a dollop of mayonnaise. I used chicken from a rotisserie bird. My husband said I could make it again!

Family loved it. Really easy to make. I did not cook the chicken due to time restraints instead used a lemon pepper seasoned rotisserie chicken from Walmart; deboned and added to the recipe. I will double recipe next time to allow for seconds. Great recipe!

I made this with no changes to the original recipe. It was pretty good as is. 15 minutes was a little too much time in my oven. The breadcrumb mixture had started to scorch a tiny bit. I will definitely make this again.

This is a good basic recipe.  However, the original calls for a 1/2 tsp curry powder, which really adds dimension to the dish. Also, make it less fattening with lower fat/sodium soup, or make your own.

I love, love, love casseroles and this one could not be easier to throw together and was so delicious! Made it exactly as directed, served over white rice, and everyone in my house enjoyed it. There were no leftovers!  Definitely adding this one to the meal rotation.

I added bow tie pasta to this dish to make it a complete meal.  And I used rotisserie chicken and Italian bread crumbs.  It was wonderful and smelled "Divan" coming out of the oven.

Delicious. Sautéed garlic and a half an onion with the chicken. Addres 1 tsp lemon pepper, poultry seasoning, and Mrs.dash. When the chicken was almost cooked, I added the broccoli and let it steam for about ten minutes. Then I mixed cream of chicken soup, milk and 1/2 cup sour cream and mixed it in with the chicken/broccoli, put it in a baking pan and topped it with cheese and breadcrumbs. Easy and super yummy

We found this very salty, possibly because I used regular Cream of Broccoli Soup and we normally only use Healthy Choice Campbell's Soups as they are a bit healthier, but they didn't make a Cream of Broccoli in Healthy Choice.  I would either try a different soup next time with less salt or ???  We also used Ritz Crackers on the top, but DID NOT add the drizzle of butter.  The Ritz Crakers are salty, but I think they added a lot as compared to what bread crumbs would have.  I also added the 1/2 cup light sour cream that others suggested and a little more cheese.  Also I did use the fresh broccoli that the recipe called for and I don't think it would have been half as good with frozen.

This recipe is an amazing weeknight easy meal. I did make some substitutions because of what I had on hand. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of broccoli. I also pre-seasoned the chicken with a 1 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning, 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper which gave the casserole a nice flavor. I used a mixed bag of vegetables with broccoli as well. Family raved about it!

This is a classic dish and an ages-old recipe. It's great as is. When you alter the recipe by adding this and this, substituting this for that, and completely deleting, oh...I don't know...the broccoli because you prefer green beans, it changes the flavor profile and makes it AN ENTIRELY NEW RECIPE! So, upload your own darn recipe and call it your own instead of sabotaging someone else's.

This recipe was excellent!  I cut the recipe in half because we are trying to control our portion sizes.  I added a few tablespoons of  minced onion and a clove of minced garlic, sauteed for a minute or two, threw in the boiled broccoli and shredded cooked chicken, and added a little seasoning.  I mixed together the soup, milk, 2 oz. of shredded cheddar (2% reduced fat), and a couple of dashes of hot sauce.  Divided the mixture between two small (2 cup) casseroles /ramekins and sprinkled with panko crumbs mixed with a little light butter, then sprinkled 1 Tbsp. of grated Parmesean on top of each little casserole.  This came in under 500 calories, and reminded me that I can cook lighter dinners while still enjoying something creamy and cheesy!  My husband, who does not really care for broccoli, said, "This is really good!"

The casserole was delicious.  I used left over turkey instead of chicken.  The recipe said it was for 6 servings but my husband and I ate all but one serving which I had for lunch the next day. I will make it again.

I tried this recipe and it turned out really well! We didn't have Cream of Broccoli so I used Campbell's Cream of Celery. This was really simple to make and we had no left-overs after having this for lunch! I'm gonna try this recipe again with different variations. Maybe add some other veggies in the mix.

It was good, but after reading some of the reivews I made some changes.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead, increased to 2 cups of chicken, added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, added 1/3 cup greek yogurt.  I also sauteed some mushrooms and onions and put on top of chicken before adding sauce.  I also used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  I know I altered the recipe quite a bit, but the basic is good and I will make again with my alterations.

I've been making a version of this for years. First, I want to stress it's important not to overcook the broccoli. It cooks more in the oven. I've made this mistake and the broccoli gets mushy.  For those who like curry, I recommend adding 1 to 3 tablespoons of mild curry powder.  My family loves this.  And now my daughter makes it for her own family, including her 3 year old daughter.

Great dish for those random leftovers you have in your fridge! I mixed everything together using frozen steamed broccoli, leftover chicken and brown rice and i added a can of corn,1/2 cup of sour cream and all I had was a can of cream of chicken soup with herbs. I mixed in the shredded cheddar and added sautéed onions, garlic powder, cayenne, bacon and chive spice and S&P to taste. Doubled the breadcrumb recipe and it came out AWESOME!

This is a good dish, but it is bland. I added garlic, pepper,  more cheese, and Tony Chachere's More Spice Seasoning.

Excellent. As others suggested, I sprinkled lemon pepper, season salt and garlic powder over the dish before I poured the soup/milk mixture over it.

It was very bland for my family. I'm not a creative cook, so I usually try the recipes as they are written. I won't make it again without adding seasoning and crunch.

I made this recipe with some of the additions/changes suggested and one I added myself.  It was very good!  I used left over roast chicken, sauteed in butter to reheat along with onion and garlic.  I used Cr of Mushroom soup with 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar and 1/4 cup real bacon bits.  I put chicken mixture in casserole, topped with 1/2 soup mixture, added broccoli,rest of soup mixture, another 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar.  Topped with buttered unseasoned bread crumb(panko) and sprinkled with parmesean cheese.  The bacon was a wonderful flavor addition.  We will make this again.

I gave this recipe 3 stars for ease and speed of preparation, minimal ingredients and being novice cook friendly. I wish, however, that I could have given it only 2 1/2. For me it left a lot to be desired, mainly complexity of flavor. However I recognized that it had potential. The second time I made it I doctored it up quite a bit with various seasonings such as Garam masala, turmeric, onion & garlic powder, more cheese, Greek yogurt in lieu of milk, Worcestershire sauce, red wine and green peas. This brought it up to about 4/4 1/2 stars.

My family loves my modified version of this recipe and that's hard to do. I boiled the broccoli and when they were done, I put salt and butter to melt. While I cooked the meat with Mexican spices, I stirred the bread crumbs, cooking creme, and milk: two times more then it calls for. Then mixed everything in the cooking pan poared Parmesan cheese on top. And tada! Its done

I made changes to this recipe the first time I made it, but I loved it all the same. Instead of cream of broccoli I used broccoli and cheese soup. I also threw in a bad of egg noodles to give this a little more substance.I used more milk than the recipe requested because of how thick the soup was and it turned out pretty good. Leftovers for all!

This was a great go to recipe as I was hankering for Chicken Divan on a cold winter night.  I found a substitute recipe for the cream of mushroom soup which included  making my own chicken stock, thus making the base a lot healthier than canned soup. No mushrooms left but I added a pinch of onion powder to the liquid ingredients. My bread crumbs were seasoned too which added a bit of omph.  Traditionally it is a mild dish so cooks are free to jazz it up to their own liking. My husband who is not a broccoli or chicken breast liker, really liked this dish! The top was browned nicely and had a crunchy crust. I would make this one again. It's a great company or bring a meal to a friend type of dish. I liked that it called for using a pie pan!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. Next time add some more spices to intensify the flavor. I would make this again b/c it is pretty quick and it has a vegetable in it which is hard to get my husband to eat.

Pretty good! Quick & easy! I used cream of potato soup instead cause that's what I had. And doubled the bread crumbs (used panko). It's very good. I'd probably use 2 cans of soup and double the milk next time cause I'd like it moister. Good though!

I found this recipe to use up the last remaining frozen chicken breasts I had left from a bag and a can of cream of broccoli soup that had just expired.  I think it made a fast and easy week night meal that I will fix again.  Everyone seemed to like it.

What a treat! My hubby absolutely loved it! Cheesy broccoli goodness! The recipe looked a little bit bland, so I made a few changes to spruce it up! Instead of broccoli soup, I used cream of mushroom and garlic, I added a dash of onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper. Overall, it was a tasty dish. Will be keeping this recipe.

I JUST made this tonight for the first time, and I loved it , especially my husband, he couldn't stop eating it. I did cook the chicken in butter and garlic with chopped onions. Soo good and tender, other than that I followed every direction, this is a MUST dish. And it was super easy and quick! It looked better than it smelled, seriously.

Delicious comfort food with nutritious  broccoli! I added 1/3 cup sour cream as suggested by another reviewer as well as 1/2 of a chopped red pepper and a chopped chili pepper (minus seeds) before baking it to give it some extra flavor/heat for my preference. I mixed mine all together before baking it.  There are so many variations of added vegetables you could make with this recipe. It's worth saving.

This is delicious! My boyfriend had seconds and thirds! I added sour cream and used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I also added some Mrs. Dash table blend and lemon pepper to the chicken while cooking, and I added garlic powder to the mixture as well. So good!

My mother makes a dish very similar to this one, however she adds paprika to the sauce and sprinkles a bit on top. I would say she adds about a 1/2 tsp. I suppose it would depend on personal taste preferences. It's one of my favorite meals.

Very tasty. I followed the advice of others and added 1/2 cup of sour cream. I also added my own instinctual seasonings like onion powder, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and about a 1/2 cup of extra cheese. I decided to go with the cream of chicken soup rather than broccoli, and since it was a quick weeknight meal I went ahead and mixed in some cooked pasta so it was an all-in-one dish. My 5 year old son finished all of the leftovers single handedly, and it was a satisfying meal for my husband who was tired afterwork and just wanted some good eats and sleep. Goes great with garlic bread.

Easy easy easy.  I didn't have any cheddar, so I used what I had, Jalapino cheddar.  It kicked it up many notches in flavor.  Even my kids who don't like cheese or jalipino peppers loved it.  It gave it just enough spicy but lots of flavor.

This recipe did not go well with me. I made it exactly how the recipe stated plus 1/2 cup of sour cream that I mixed in. I also put in cream of chicken soup instead. It definitely had an odd flavor...and it didn't taste fresh at all. Guess it's just not my kind of dish

My family loves this dish, even one of my picky eaters. I serve it with rice or pasta. It is a bit salty for me, so I use the light cream if broccoli soup.

I like my broccoli a bit crunchy so I didn't precook it. Also omitted cheddar, bread, and butter. Sprinkled some shredded Parmesan cheese on top instead.

Easy and delicious. My family loves it! I made a little extra butter/breadcrumb topping to put on top of the cheese. Other than that just as written.

Very good.  Made the recipe as written except that I substituted broccoli cheese soup for the broccoli soup and in order to avoid the addition of melted butter just sprinkled some stuffing mix on top.  Will make again.

It was great!... Will make many times in the future.  Used cream of celery and cheese soup.  It was a good combination.  I seasoned the chicken with red pepper flakes and some curry.  This gave it some added flavor.

My family loves chicken divan with these changes. For a little tangy flavor I add 1/3 C. Mayonnaise, 1/2 tsp. curry powder and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice mixed with the cream of chicken soup and milk. I also mix the cheese with the soup instead of just sprinkling on top. I always serve with rice. Yum!

Very good! I followed a few of the suggestions. Added some onions and garlic power to the chicken. All I had was broccoli cheddar soup, worked great ! I added a few scoops of sour cream also. There are many possibilities with this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is fast, easy, and cost effective. I did cook my chicken with ms.dash, butter, pepper, and chill powder. I know it's crazy but I like using different spices. This recipe is very yummy. This is gonna go into my recipe book.

My kids and I loved this! Even my picky two year old ate her whole bowl! I followed other reviewers and added a half cup of sour cream. I also added garlic, and some Greek seasoning to the soup/milk mixture. I also cooked some chopped onions with the chicken and seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning. Yum yum

Made this the other night and the family loved it. A couple substitutions I made: used the broccoli cheddar soup because my son wanted it more cheesy. Then for the topping, I crushed herb seasoned croutons in a Ziploc bag instead of using just plain breadcrumbs. Great dish, will make again.

I have done this recipe for years. For the sauce, I use two cans of cream of chicken soup,1cup mayo, 1tsp lemon juice, 1/2-1tsp curry powder for a kick. I also top with cheddar cheese but I use crumbled crackers softened with melted butter to cover the top. I serve over rice and my family has loved it for years. Easy, easy, easy!

Not a bad recipe as is.  I had to use what was on hand, so I did make changes, hence the 3 stars.  For the soup, I used Campbells broccoli and cheese because that was what was in my cabinets.  I did add sour cream and doubled the cheese like many of the reviewers also did.  Still feel that the recipe needs something but am not sure what.  All in all, it was a quick and filling meal.

Tasty, easy and healthy!I absolutely love this recipe. I cooked the chicken the day before, came home from work, steamed the broccoli, threw it together and done cooking in 15 minutes!Looking at the nutritional information really sold me. Even not too much sodium considering there is condensed soup in the recipe. Thanks so much for sharing. It's perfect as it is.

This made for an easy supper. My husband hates casseroles but he asked me to fix this again. I think making sure not to overcook the broccoli is key. I added more bread crumbs than the recipe called for too.

Great recipe! I improvised a little. Used a rotisserie chicken, 2 bags frozen broccoli and combined cream of chicken soup with broccoli and cheese soup. Everyone loved it! Even my 2 year olds ate the broccoli.

This is very similar to my Mom's chicken divan which was standard fare back in the 70's - with one big difference. True Chicken Divan calls for 1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon of curry added to soup/milk mix. Several people commented it was bland so this will definitely add some zing; The curry is NOT overpowering but a good subtle taste.  My mom's original recipe also called for 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 cup milk (vs. 1/3).  The mayo makes the sauce a little more substantial. Enjoy!

I'm not a fan of broccoli to begin with but this was a great side. I served it with roasted chicken. My family enjoyed and it was easy.

Only addition was seasoned salt and garlic salt- otherwise followed to a T! My whole family loved it and I had no left overs from a double batch. I'm not sure why so many comments changed the recipe completely. Thanks!!

Easy.  Great to re purpose leftover chicken. Only deviation from written review,  is that I used probably a bit more chicken than called for,  1 can Campbell's broccoli cheese,  1 can cream of chicken,  a bit more milk to compensate for second can,  and bag of mixed veggies (broccoli,  cauliflower,  zucchini). Was delish. I made Brown rice and quinoa for side options.  Dev will make again.  Thank you

I used this as a base recipe for a casserole. I followed the ingredients and the instructions but mixed it all in with cooked pasta and baked. I did not have canned cream of soup so I made a cheese sauce on the stovetop and added it to the pasta mixture. I also added chopped spinach for more vegetables as well as seasoned the chicken. My kids don't like the crunchy topping so I did not use bread crumbs. Overall great comfort food and I would try it again with a canned soup.

We liked this casserole a lot.   I read the negative reviews on it and decided to try it anyway.  I think the negative folks expected it to be more than it was.  Face it, it is simply chicken, broccoli and cheese.  That is it.  It is not supposed to be the best dinner ever...  I stuck to the basic recipe and we enjoyed it as a nice hot lunch.  Easy leftovers, too.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you use FRESH broccoli.  The frozen stuff is most likely what made others complain of it being too watery or bland.  AND, do NOT over cook the broccoli before you add it to the casserole dish or it will be mushy, as another reviewer complained.  The second time I added canned mushrooms, substituted broccoli soup for half cream of chicken and half sour cream, and left out the milk.  To make it a 100% no-carb dish I will only use sour cream, heavy cream and Chardonnay white wine next time.  An easy make-ahead dinner!  Thank you

I'm giving this three stars because I altered it a bit to add more flavor.  I sauteed some onions in olive oil, then threw in the chicken with 2 cloves minced garlic.  I also didn't have any cream of mushroom soup, so I made my own cream soup base.  Finally, I added a little bit of white wine to the soup & milk mixture.  Not our favorite meal, but good and wholesome.

I stir fried the chicken, broccoli (with chili flakes) and added mushrooms, then I assembled the recipe using creme of mushroom (instead of creme of broccoli) and I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.

This was amazing, As others have said my 2 1/2 yr old LOVED it and she doesn't touch broccoli or chicken. I tweaked it a bit, mixed the chicken with the broccoli then added the sauce. Only thing different is to double the serving. I did 9 X 13 dish and it wasn't enough. Thanks

If it were sans chicken and meant to be a broccoli cheddar chowder type of thing that would work, with tons of doctoring up on the seasonings. However, it was not what I expected, my family enjoyed the garlic bread more than the food. Waste of time and ingredients, but thanks anyway.

This is so good and an easy way to use leftover chicken. My one year old loves it. I think it's good as written, but I usually add lemon pepper and garlic powder.

My husband loves this recipe.  I saute the chicken in Montreal Chicken Seasoning.  I use a mix bag of broccoli and cauliflower, frozen, because my husband's stomach doesn't like broccoli as much as he does.  And I double the bread crumb topping.

Made as is, but added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder for taste.  Great comfort food for a cold winter night.  Will make again!

This was a big hit in our house!  For only two of us and a toddler, we barely had any leftovers.  I used panko instead of regular bread crumbs.  I will probably add more cheese next time I make this at my husband's request, but overall this is a great recipe.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  I agree with others, it was a little bland.  Next time I will mix the broccoli and chicken with the soup before putting it in the baking dish.

Very easy and quick dinner to make when you're stuck for something. Used cream of mushroom soup, raw broccoli (prefer a bit of a crunch to my veggies), and 1 cup of 2% milk. I whisked the liquids together, added some lemon pepper, parsley and garlic powder. I then poured liquid over the raw broccoli and cooked chicken. I mixed it well then topped it off with a little gruyere cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs (did not add butter to breadcrumbs - no need as it browned perfectly). Will keep this dish in my household for those nights I need something quick and easy to make - thanks for sharing!

I needed to cook something big for a large church function so I adjusted the servings to 40 and it was amazing! This is a very filling and tasty meal. I didn't change a thing and won't the next time I use this recipe.

Worth trying again to modify it. Best idea to add the crackers on top but still needed something.  Kids liked, hubby so-so. Used the broccoli soup, maybe I'll try a different one.

This one is kid-friendly for sure! The only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is that, as someone who loves a lot of flavor, this was lacking a bit of zing for me. You could spice it up a bit with some herbs and salt, or even a bit of cayenne.

It was a bit bland but a nice recipe, I made a white wine sauce to replace the canned soup as I never use condensed canned soups due to the horrific sodium content.

This is a very good and flexible casserole.  Use whatever cream soup you have, fresh or frozen broccoli (I like florets), experiment with different spices.  I added some sauteed onion, and 1/2 cup sour cream, but it would have been fine without too.
Edit 12/2013: Made with left over turkey and added some rosemary - yummy.

I made this last night and followed the recommendations of several other reviewers. I added a couple tablespoons of sour cream as well as some garlic, onion powder and black pepper to the sauce to season it a bit. In addition, I doubled the amount of bread crumbs for the topping to cover it all. It tasted delicious!

Good recipe overall but some additions could make it great. I did season the chicken before I put it in the dish....but some seasoning on the broccoli could go a long ways. Also I didn't have cream of broccoli so I used broccoli cheese instead and I cut back on the cheese I put on top but next time I will put more cheese. This dish also needs to be served over rice or with something on the side to make it more of a meal.

First question: Does anyone have experience freezing this dish? We make this frequently seasoning chicken with Montreal Chicken seasoning and add shredded carrots, onion and garlic that I saute before mixing all the ingredients together. Top with a bit of chicken and double to crumb topping. My teen son practically eats the whole dish!

This recipe is a super simple way to make a delicious casserole! After reading some of the other reviews for this recipe and while I was making this dish, I did make a few adjustments: 
Used a little over a cup of cheese (half I put in the soup/milk mixture, half I saved for the top)
Mixed the chicken and half the cheese as noted above with the soup/milk mixture. It was easier to just pour it over the broccoli so it all mixed together better. 
Overall, it's a great recipe and I highly recommend it! but definitely add extra cheese!

This was just ok for me. I followed the recipe as written and was expecting a bit more based off of the good reviews, I mean, it was edible, but nothing amazing. I usually cook from scratch with fresh ingredients and herbs, so this felt very contrived and plain. The idea is great, but I would definitely alter this if I made it again.

Great recipe, whole family loves it. The only change I made was instead of bread crumbs, we use stuffing mix. That seems to add a little kick to the flavour that the family love.

This receipe was great. I made a couple of extra changes. Instead of cream of broccoli, I used cream of chichen. I added noodles and extra cheese. It was hit for dinner and request for the receipe!!!

SO tasty.  The only thing I would change is added some more bread crumbs.  Also used steamed bag broccoli and reduced fat soup.  Came out super awesome.

Great recipe!  My family loved it!  The only things I changed is that I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of broccoli and I used smashed ritz crackers in place of the bread crumbs and frozen broccoli instead of fresh. Turned out very yummy!

I made this with some changes and it was delicious! 

I substituted cream of celery soup and it was just as good if not better!  I added black pepper and green onion to the soup mixture.

Also, instead of bread crumbs I used about 10-12 crushed ritz crackers and sprinked paprika ontop.

MMM mmmm good!!

I followed the recipe but read some of the reviews and added a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  It was delicious.  Next time I won't add the sour cream though (you couldn't even notice it).

we call this "disguised broccoli casserole". Kids don't even realize how much broccoli they are eating! Great recipe. Use 1 cup of cheddar, bacon and more butter/bread crumbs. Definitely needs season salt, pinch of garlic powder, and pepper. Made two, one to give to family in need. Got great response. Will make again. Thanks for posting your recipe.

Made this the other night and my family and I were not impressed. I guess the taste was ok but there needed to be something more as far as the seasoning and an added ingredient for texture. For the most part it was like eating chicken and broccoli mush. I would suggest adding sliced potatoes or even rice to the recipe that may help. Won't be making this one again.

Really nice! I steamed frozen broccoli, sauteed onions and sliced Portabello mushrooms and threw it all together with sour cream and cream of mushroom soup. A little splash of white wine would really increase the richness but it was incredibly yummy just the way it is. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for dinner (with a few alterations) the other night and it was delicious! I used cream of mushroom, and added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar and 1/2 cup light sour cream to the mix. My husband, who is a fairly picky eater, had seconds. He just added some salt and pepper (something he puts on all of his food, lol).

Delicious! I took the advice of another and doubled the recipe, used LOTS of cheese (sprinkled on broccoli layer, and chicken layer and on top). Also, since I doubled the recipe, I used 1 can of cream of chicken and herbs along with 1 can of broccoli cheese soup, and added about 1/2 cup of sour cream (in addition to milk in recipe). I also used more bread crumbs. I will definitely make this again, the EXACT SAME WAY. My husband and my 2 year old couldn't get enough!

Pretty good meal. I have never made a casserole before and this one seemed easy enough. I did some of the modifications that I read about...seasoned & sauted the chicken, added low fat sour cream and  more milk. I also added some more pepper and salt although next time I will not add salt, the soup is salty enough. Also used Frenchs crispy onions on top instead of butter & crackers. It is missing a little kick so maybe I will add some hot sauce??? Easy & quick recipe-will definitely make again.

Delish!  Even my 8 year old who is not a "tree" fan loved this dish!  They all decided it was a make again for sure!  This is going into the new menu rotation!  I did add a bit more chicken, about 1/2 pound and also used adobo seasoning, salt and pepper to season my chicken.  I also doubled the sauce, using one can cream of broc and one can of cream of chicken.  I also used added a bit of sour cream and my cheese was velveeta(I don't know why I bought it and I am trying to use it up, we don't really eat it and it will go to waste).  It was delish!!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, but next time I will add quite a bit more salt. I substituted cream of mushroom for the cream of broccoli. I did salt the water I boiled the broccoli in and add a pinch of sea salt, but it was still very bland. Next time I will add two to three pinches of salt as well as pepper.

Very good. Used a little more broccoli than called for just because of personal preference. Also used frozen broccoli which saved on prep time. Would put everything in a 9x13 next time just for more surface area for the cheese...yummy!

This is very good if you season a bit more like other reviewers suggest.  It's even better the next day.

Pretty standard, easy to follow recipe. Definitely needs some spicing up, but it's a delicious foundation.

We had the left overs as wraps the next day, and they were actually better than the first day. 

I'm going to make this again.

Added sour cream. Also, I would use cream of chicken over cream of broccoli.

For what it was we thought it was pretty decent. I made some changes. I doubled the recipe to start, used one can Cheddar Cheese soup, one can Cream of Broccoli, and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sour cream, I did not cook the broccoli before hand, I also seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper while i cooked it. I mixed in some dried onions as well as French's fried onions and topped the whole thing with Cheddar Cheese and French's Fried Onions. Baked for about an hour at 400 and served over plain rice.

Very tastey! Tried as is, and it was great, but I tried some of the reviewer's suggestions the second time to try and make it amazing instead of great. I'd still rate it 5 stars without the modifications though. It is good both ways.  Added some seasoning to the chicken when it was cooking as per reviews - lemon pepper, seasoning salt and garlic powder. I also added 1 pkg of chicken pullion to the soup mixture which adds an amazing flavour. I added more cheddar cheese and doubled the bread crumbs. Very good!

This was a pretty good recipe. The best part was how easy it was to make. I used more chicken and less broccoli than asked. I figured the cream of broccoli soup would make up for the difference. I added 1/2 cup sour cream and seasonings per the recommendation of others. I also added 1/2 cup cheese to the mix. I steamed frozen broccoli and mixed everything together. Temperature and time in the oven were the same. I tried making my own bread crumbs by toasting bread and crumbling it. That didn't work too well. After eating it, I feel like it still needs more for the flavor. But, the recipe is well worth doing again.

Great recipe!!  I boiled my chx in broth, plus, and seasons, then tore it into pieces for the casserole.  I was short on milk, so I added sour cream like others suggested, it turned out delicious!!  And I used broccoli & chz soup.

My DH missed having lots more crust but still ate two big helpings.  Made 1/2 the recipe for the two of us, using more soup per other reviews.  I didn't have any dry bread crumbs so used crushed shredded wheat cereal....which was awesome btw.  Oh and instead of boiling chicken used torn pieces off the already roasted chicken from the market.  Will definitely make this over and over again.

I followed the recipe but added some spices to the chicken as it cooked, such as garlic powder and two others (can't remember!). I used a little bit more chicken and cheese. I liked it and my husband said it was good. My 15 yr old daughter didn't care for it that much but she ate it all! ;0)

The recipe is okay as listed.  I changed a few things (by reading other reviews) and still found it kind of bland.  I modified it as this:  steamed 1 pound of broccoli, combined 2 cups of cooked chicken and steamed broccoli to the cream of chicken soup, milk, and about 1/4 cup cheddar cheese, seasoned with garlic powder and a little poultry seasoning.  Once mixed, add that to your bakeware and top with about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese.  I spread 4 tablespoons of bread crumbs with 2 tablesppons butter on top.  Served over egg noodles (better than rice).  I will definitely make this again but I will add sour cream (didn't have it this time around) and some different spices.

Very yummy recipe! I used what I had on hand, and instead of just broccoli, I used a broccoli/cauliflower combination. I also cooked the chicken in a variety of spices and it came out wonderful. Definitely going to make this again!

Made it exactly as written. Disappointing. Not as good as I had hoped it would be. It wasn't horrible, it was just OK. Certainly nothing like the rave reviews posted. If I were to make it again I would probably have to do as others did in their reviews and add some extra seasonings to liven it up a bit. I do think it's worth trying again with some adjustments.

Love this idea! I altered the recipe, cooked the chicken in garlic, onion and pepper -- added cauliflower and corn fresh off the cob to the casserole and seasoned my breadcrumbs with herbs and parmesan as well.  I served with a side of jasmine rice.

Great recipe base and even better dish with some modification. I added garlic powder, black pepper, salt free lemon pepper seasoning and some seasoning salt to the chicken while browning on the stove. Near the end of the browning, I added onions for added depth of flavor and bit of sweetness. Frozen broccoli florets were added to the pan after the onions were fully browned, along with the soup, milk and half of the cheddar. I also added whole wheat egg noodles into the casserole for a little bit of carb induced happiness and it was PERFECT. My fiance ate the casserole for days after I made this and still asked for more after he finished it off!

I really liked this recipe and so did my family. with that said we were all kinda looking for a bit more from it. I had made it for a meal for us and ended up cooking some pasta to put this on top of. Turned out fabulously. Next time I will just mix the pasta in with the rest of it and bake.   Thanks for the great recipe.

Made as written, pretty bland. Maybe seasoning the chicken would have helped. I added more shredded cheese and some pepper when it was on my plate just to give it a bit of flavour.

I absolutely love this dish! It is soo simple and soo delicious! If you are pressed for time, this is a quick and cheesy meal or side dish. Yumm! The only thing that I did differently was use cream of chicken soup (that's all I had) and it worked wonderfully.

Good basic recipe you can alter to your likings.  It wasn't hearty enough for me. Would have been good with wild rice or hashbrowns, even more broccoli etc... Also, I hadded an onion and clove of garlic, and carrotts-great addition, and a blob or two of sourcream! and used broccoli cheese soup vs. cream of broccoli-had it on hand.

I served this over brown rice and my husband liked it alot!  I omitted the bread crumbs from the recipe because I was out and it turned out great still.  I wil definitely make this again only next time I will use reduced fat cream soup mix instead of the full fat version.

This was a good recipe.  I only had cream of chicken condensed soup so thats what I used and it came out wonderful.  I hate vegetables, but I've been trying to eat more and more of them so this is one dish that I'll be trying again...

This recipe delivered exactly what it said it would, a quick and easy chicken and broccoli dish that everyone loved!  It was so easy to prepare with ingredients I already had on hand.  I used frozen broccoli (what I had) and cooked it and then chopped it really fine so my 18mo. old twins would not notice it so much.  I had broccoli cheese soup on hand so I used that instead.  Other than those minor things, I did exactly what the recipe said.  We all really liked it and I will be making it again.  I also made some white rice to go along with it, cooked in chicken broth instead of water .  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I enjoyed this but my kids didn't care for it much. They love broccoli but this recipe seemed to be too much broccoli for them. I agree that it could use more chicken or even cream of chicken instead maybe.

I would have given this a higher score if my boyfriend had liked it more. I loved it, but he said this was the first of my recipes that he didn't want to have often, "it was okay." His complaint was that it tasted too soupy. I tried making it with cheddar brocolli soup instead and it was definitely better, but still a little weird.  I still think its a great recipe and I love that when I made it it lasted me the rest of the week in leftovers for lunch!

Kind of bland. Needs some spice to make it a 4 or 5 star recipe. Would add some pasta, peas and pepper. Maybe some other spices would help wake this up. Not bad but could be better.

I'm not going to rule out this recipe. It was a nice change of pace meal.  I did season the chicken well and added more cheese but it didn't have too much flavor and a little too runny.  I'm going to try condensed cheese soup and maybe a stuffing top.

my family loved this!  I added a little bit of curry to the soup and milk as well as some salt and pepper.  Also the next time I make it I might put more bread crumbs on the top.  Delicious!

This was a HIT in my house...it's very quick and easy...best of all, it's nice and healthy.  I didn't have cream of broccoli so I used cream of chicken instead...it still was incredible.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper for flavor.

My husband loves this recipe and it's so easy to throw together. Minor modifications for more flavor depth although I still need to add a little to the chicken part. I steamed the broccoli instead of boiling. Added 1/4C parmesan, 1/2tsp each oregano, onion powder and garlic powder and then 1 tsp parsley to the soup mix. Next time I'll add onions and garlic while the chicken is cooking and maybe that will help. Great overall recipe!

Awesome and easy.  My family of 4 loved it... no leftovers!  Instead of fresh broccoli, I used frozen (steamfresh - birds eye).  I also cooked it at 375 instead of 450 for about 30-35 mins so that it would be ready at the same time as the wild rice I made to go with it.  I will definitely make this again.

I used to make this years ago and lost my recipe; but his one is a bit easier and very good! I doubled it and took it to a football/playoff party - it was a hit!  I added some mustartd to the soup mixture  (used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken) as well as some garam marsala spice - to taste. And I used mayonaise instead of milk for a thicker sauce.   For the topping I crushed a mxture of Ritz crackers and French's Onions with the melted butter. Also added a lot more shreddded cheese. Very good!

I mixed the broccoli and chicken, put it at the bottom of the dish; I then sprinkled a layer of shreded cheese, then I smeared about 1/2 thick of sour cream on top of the cheese; then I put another layer of cheese, and added the bread crumbs. It was VERY good.

This was very good.  My husband had three servings.  Like others, I spiced it up a bit more and added sour cream.  Also, I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  THANKS Terri C.  I have a feeling that I will be making this a lot in the future.  It's so easy and delicious!!

Simple hearty and low carb. I think it would be better if u mix the chicken, broccoli, and sauce. My fam wont eat broccoli unless its covered in sauce. I also loved the fact that you can use almost any kind of cream soup. All I had was cream of mushroom and it tasted great.

Great quick meal! I made two dishes of this, one w/ cream of chkn only. The other dish had half can of cream of chkn and half can cream of mushrooms. Without even letting them know the difference  everyone commented on how better the mixed cream dish tasted.

A very good base. I added twice the amount of breadcrumbs and included 1 TBSP of Dijon mustard in the sauce.  Next time, some Tabasco and onion as well.

We changed this up a little bit upon a mistake made by my husband.  We were making this for thanksgiving and we were in a hurry to get the dishes done on time.  He mixed the cheese, soup, bread crumbs, milk, and melted butter I cooked the chicken with and put it on top of the broccoli and chicken.  We also doubled the recipe, so it wouldn't fit into a pie pan.  We ended up dividing it between two bread pans.  But, it was still really good.  I will make again.

this recipe was really good. I love broccoli and chicken more than any other food so i knew this would be something i would like. i didnt alter the recipe much just added a little more cheese. it was a little time consuming because i cut the chicken and broccoli myself but i will definitely make it again!

I made this with a can of chicken breast (the Costco/Kirkland brand) and served it over instant brown rice for a very quick meal (I did use fresh steamed broccoli, however).   Very tasty, especially considering the minimal effort.  It isn't 5 star/feed to company worthy, but definitely good for a quick week night meal.

I'll admit I changed the recipe pretty significantly by making my own cheese sauce (2 T each butter and flour, 1 1/2 cups of lowfat milk, 1/2 cup grated chedar, and I sauteed a little onion in the butter before adding the flour), but I try to avoid the funky fats and unnecessary salt in canned soups. I do use them occasionally but I happened to have some time on my hands the day I made this.  It was fantastic. I followed the advice of others and added more seasoning to the sauce, in my case a few drops of worcestershire, low-sodium soy sauce, a little chicken bouillion, and cayenne pepper. And I didn't skip the cheese and breadcrumbs on the top even though I made a cheese sauce. Terrific recipe, a keeper!

This came out great everyone loved it.  I did double the recipe and added sour cream (a half of a cup).  I also seasoned the chiken with seasoned salt.  Steamed my broccoli in garlic. I served it over egg noodles and it was a big hit!  Sorry I couldn't give it 5 stars, only because I added so many things on my own.. Thanks for the start though!

As mentioned before, it is a little on the bland side as prepared here, but a little bit of salt and an herb or two can help with that. We went with a little marjoram and oregano. Also, when cooking the chicken, we cooked it with garlic, salt, pepper, and a little bit of lemon juice. You can pretty much tweak it however you like and make it a five-star recipe for you!

The recipe as written is not good. I added some garlic and onion powder and it was still bland. Thanks anyway

I have NEVER given a review, and I joined up just to review this. YUM! I made some tweaks (pre seasoned the chicken with Mrs Dash and some ground oregano before cooking it, used a microwave bag of broccoli, added some Velveeta chunks to the mix).... I was doubtful about this, being a canned soup recipe...but WOW it is great! Thanks for a keeper!

I thought this was good, but not spectacular.  It's an easy dish to put together, but needs more "umpf."  I did add salt, pepper and garlic powder and ritz crackers instead of the breadcrumbs.

YUMMY! This was so GOOD! I did use reduced fat soup (and I used cream of chicken because I didn't have any cream of broccoli).  I also used 2% cheese.  I added some garlic powder, onion powder, Mrs. Dash and basil and sage as another reviewers suggested.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

I doubled everything and made it in a glass 9x13 pan.  Kids ages 5 and 9 loved it and even at lots of broccoli.  Hubs and I liked it also.  Very easy.

This turned out great.  Used  broccoli and cheese soup and ritz crackers and seasoned the chicken while it was cooking.  My 5yr old son loved it and actually cleaned his plate.

This recipe rocks! I am vegetarian so I use vegetarian chik chunks. I also used a little more cheese and waited to put the top cheese on until it was almost done baking. I made this recently for a family get together and everyone LOVED it! I have gotten many requests for this recipe.

Super easy to make! I add a bit more cheese because I love cheese probably more than I should and so does my family. The only thing I changed up was instead of bread crumbs I used stove top italian stuffing. It gives it a nice crunchy topping.

This was very good with modifications.  I boiled 4 chicken breasts and then cooked the broccoli in the chicken water.  Mixed the chicken, broccoli, milk, 1/2c sour cream, cream of mushroom soup, cheese, pepper, lemon pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and red pepper all together.  Placed it all in a pie plate and topped with bread crumbs and sprayed it with I can't believe it's not Butter.  I then baked it until bubbly and served over white rice.

almost too simple to make! great comfort food recipe :) I did as many others did and jazzed up the chicken for a little extra flavor.. I bought lemon pepper marinated chicken breasts, added a little bit of garlic, and a little splash of lemon juice over the broccoli! Delicious!

Made this last nite and both me and hubby really enjoyed it.  I had 2 slices and he ate the rest!  I dusted chicken with Accent before cooking it along w/ adding minced garlic.  I also dusted the broccoli w/ garlic powder while layering.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Added some sour cream, fried onions and two cloves of diced garlic.  Replaced the meat with soy chunks and the soup with cream of mushroom.  We loved it!

This is nice as something different in the dinner rotation.  I used fresh broccoli, but I don't think anyone would tell the difference if you used frozen.  Good dinner:)

This was wonderful and so easy.  I used 2 frozen chicken breasts which I had thawed then fried with a little oil and salt.  I used frozen broccoli florets which I pre-cooked.  I didn't have milk so addded a little water and had to use processed cheese since I was out of cheddar.  The processed cheese tasted good but made the casserole runny at first. It firmed up as it cooled. I crushed a handful of seasoned stuffing cubes and used it as bread crumbs.  Even with all the necessary changes because my cupboard was bare it was terrific.  I can't wait to actually follow the recipe.  Thanks Terry!

It tasted just like the Chicken Divan I used to have as a kid, though this turned out a tad too runny for me. I'll have to tweak it for my oven, but all in all, I was very pleased!

YUM! I love all the foods in this dish, so I'm a bit biased. It was very tasty though. It does need some spicing up, not sure with what, but I'll throw in some random items next time.

This was a deiciously simple dish and a great way to use leftover cooked chicken. Since I didn't have broccoli soup on hand, I substituted cream of mushroom and it worked well. For my taste, I added a bit of garlic powder too. This recipe has earned a place on my "regular" list.

Great basic recipe. I added cooked rice to the mixture, and cooked the chicken with garlic powder, seasoning salt, and lemon and pepper seasoning, as suggested. I also added fried onions which gave it a nice flavor since I didn't have time to chop onions (also suggested).

I was so nervous about this recipe, but it turned out great. I seasoned my chicken with pepper, garlic and onion powder and just enough cayenne pepper to give it a pop. My casserole was pretty liquidy, but I think I may have added too much milk. Next time I'll try using sour cream to see how that turns out. I mixed some cheese in with the chicken and broccoli as well. I used Ritz crackers rather than breadcrumbs. This is a good weeknight meal, quick, easy and tasty.

Great comfort food. Husband loved it. Next time will use more broccoli. I poached 2 chicken breasts and did not have milk so I substituted a splash of 1/2 and 1/2 and used about a quarter cup FF mayo (we like creamy). ALso used cream of chicken because that's what we had. Served over egg noodles. Very good and I will make it again!

This is surprisingly filling and a great way to get my husband to eat broccoli because if it's not DOUSED in cheese he has no interest. This recipe is just enough cheese to still taste the broccoli. Quick and easy meal that I will probably keep in my back pocket to make in a pinch.

I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream. I used Cream of Chicken soup as I do not care for mushrooms. It was so good. My husband and I ate every bite of it. I can't wait to make this again!

Reading the reviews, I seasoned 2 chicken breasts with seasoned salt, garlic powder, and lemon pepper.  I sauteed some frozen chopped onions (not sure how much). Then I placed the seasoned chicken on top the onions and put a lid on it.  I used cream of broccoli soup, mild cheddar cheese, and mayo for the mixture.  I layered the ingredients as suggested and top with cheese and buttered panko crumbs and cooked in the oven for 15 minutes.  Delicious. Next time I will try lemon juice and pepper.

Thanks for posting this recipe as I lost mine. I put in curry powder, lime juice (my tree had an abundance of limes) instead of lemon juice. I remembered these two ingredients from my lost recipe. I put in sour cream instead of milk like someone suggested. I put crushed potato chips on top. What I like about this recipe is it doesn't include mayonnaise- although I probably made it just as fattening with the sour cream and chips.

I was opening my can of soup and noticed that this was the identical recipe that was on the can.  

I cooked the chicken with onion, a bit of minced garlic and lemon pepper.  Added extra cheese (husband likes extra all the time) and doubled the crumb topping.

My 2 year old even ate it which is a change.

This is a pretty good dish. My husband wasn't too sure about it when he first saw it but was sold after trying it.  The chicken does need to be seasoned though.  Overall a good hearty meal.

This was very good, but I didn't like the canned soup. I'm going to try making this with homemade soup next time and hopefully that will make it taste even better.

Overall a pretty good recipe. I will probably make it again. I added the worcestershire sauce another review recommended and also cooked my cubed chicken with garlic and onion powder. I also used the cream of chix soup. My Fiance and I thought that the soup was just a little to thick and that was with adding 1 cup of milk. Next time i will only use 3/4 of the can of soup. The pancko bread crumbs added a great crunch!

I made this recipe for my family and the really liked it.  They only thing I did different was I did not add any additional cheese.  With the other contents it was creamy and cheesy enough.  I also added more bread crumbs.

Even my picky son liked.  Made a few changes, sauteed onions and garlic before tossing in chicken to quickly heat up.  Added 1/2 cup sour cream, Marjoram and Lawry's Seasoning to the liquid mixture.

This was totally delicious.  BUT, it's not nearly enough food for a family of four.  I would suggest doubling it unless you are using it as a side dish.  Also, I'm definitely going to add some rice to it next time for a complete meal.  Like others, I just mixed everything together prior to baking (including shredded cheese) and then dumped it in the pan.

This recipe was ok, but, if I made it again I would make some changes.  This dish was a little bland.  I would cook the chicken in garlic and use less brocolli.  I would mix the milk, soup, cheese, chicken and brocolli together before putting it in the dish to bake.  I would finish it by adding additional cheese on the top.

Fantastic! We loved this casserole! Baking it in a larger pan assured me some leftovers for lunches the next day! 

I replaced cream of broccoli with cream of chicken soup (no store-brand of cream of broccoli where I shop), and put 2 cups of cheese instead.

Definitely a new budget family meal on my shortlist!

I found this recipe and thought it was utterly gorgeous, I did make a few alterations as did other members, I added more broccoli to my liking I also added salt pepper marjorum and oregano, 1clove of garlic, also couldnt find broccoli soup so i used chicken instead, I doubled the amount of cheese and added half to the sauce, also added mushrooms, this recipe is so versatile you can adapt it to your liking.

This was ok but I think there was too much concentrated soup. It would have tasted better if it was thinned out alot more. Probably won't make this again.

I need something fast and easy.  I just made this for our friends and their grandchildren (who are very picky eaters!)  They all loved it...even the little one who normally won't eat chicken. I made a serving for 12.  Used frozen broccoli, precooked, drained and used paper towels to absorb excess water.  Used Tyson precooked chicken. Didn't have cream of broccoli soup so I substituted a can each of Healthy Request cheddar and cream of chicken soup. Added 1/2 cup low fat sour cream per another reviewer.  Children made "all gone" and so did the adults.  REALLY SIMPLE TO MAKE!

Great recipe! I cooked according to recipe but I would change some things next time. I would substitute the milk with sour cream. It turned out kind-of watery. I froze half and just cooked other half and it turned out great.

A good and quick mid-week dinner choice. I did some minor tweaking of course. Per others' suggestions I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream. I cheated and used Perdue shortcuts for the chicken which was a real time saver. I did use reduced fat cream of chicken soup in place of the cream of brocolli because I think it is less pungent, and I substituted crumbled ritz crackers for the bread crumbs - this was a nice change.  served it all over white rice and the whole family (kids included) enjoyed.

Perfect.  I used left-over turkey and cream of mushroom soup instead and it still turned out great.

I like this recipe. I've made it a couple of times now, and I prefer it using cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. I also add more breadcrumbs on top. It is easy to make and very filling.

Not difficult to make, and looks quite pretty when done. My husband and daughter both liked it, although my daughte said she would like it to be saucier. An easy meal when served with rice and a spinach, orange and strawnerry salad. Thanks.

Made this last night -- without the chicken. Wanted to make this more of a broccoli casserole and it turned out great. I also added some chopped onions while blanching the broccoli. I even had leftovers for breakfast!

I liked this recipe and modified it according to other people's suggestions.  I added cooked rice pilaf on the bottom, used cajun spice like a rub on the chicken and I used Campbell's Healthy Heart Cream of Chicken soup and skim milk to lighten it all up.  It still tasted salty, so next time, I'll try Rice Roni's Reduced Sodium Chicken rice and cut back on the cajun spice. I will put tin foil over the pan while in the oven for the bulk of the time to heat it through and then take the tin foil off to crisp the top before removing from the oven. I didn't do that this time and the cheese was dried/baked on rather than oozing through the dish. I'll definitely try this one again.

As per recipe and a few dashes of ground peppercorns, my family loved it. Good comfort food.  Did use boneless thighs instead of breasts and meat was very tender and tasty. Will try next time with suggestions of spices from other members.

big hit at our house. Sauteed the chicken w/ creole seasoning and garlic powder. Used homemade whole wheat bread crumbs. Doubled the cheese and the bread crumb mixture. Very easy. I think I will try frozen broc. next time to make it even easier

I also seasoned the chicken breasts beforehand with seasoned salt, and sauteed with some chopped onion and minced garlic.  I also doubled the recipe, and added 2 boxes of prepared chicken rice-a-roni mix to the bottom of a 9x13 pan to give it more body.  However, my soup mixture, to which I added 1/2 C. of sour cream as others suggested, didn't seem to penetrate the layers, rather mostly just sat on top where I poured it.  Don't know what I did wrong.  I will try it again, though, maybe as a smaller batch, because I didn't realize how much this would make! It did have a good flavor,however, and hubby liked it the way it was!

This recipe was delicious and my husband who balked at the dish after only looking at it loved it.  I sauteed the chicken (1lb chicken stir fry meat from breast) in extra virgin olive oil with 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion and garlic.  I seasoned the chicken with tons of Emeril's essence, salt and fresh ground black pepper.  The broccoli was put into hot water and put on the stove on high until softened, maybe 15 minutes - it never boiled. Then I drained and rinsed with cold water.  I added approx 1/4 cup sour cream to the sauce and seasoned with paprika, salt, pepper, and Emeril's essence.  I put way more cheese than the recipe called for - I covered the top of the 8x8 glass baking dish and doubled the bread crumb mixture and put on some extra dry breadcrumbs.  450 is WAY too hot - it will burn fast, so I turned it down to 375 for 15-20 minutes.  It was absolutely delicious over plain rice and made amazing leftovers.  Highly recommended with some changes!!!

I thought this was pretty good, but my husband that it was awesome! It was an aesthetically pleasing dish and very low budget. I used cream of mushroom soup since I did not have any cream of broccoli. Overall very good.

This was good. I followed some suggestions in the comments: I boosted the amount of crumb topping; I used smashed butter crackers instead of breadcrumbs; I increased the cheese; I used cream of mushroom soup; and I served it over white rice cooked with water and chicken broth. I probably overdid the cheese but oh well. This was yummy and I will make again.

The first time I made this recipe, it tasted a little bland.  Now I add a little more cheese and double the topping.  We never have leftovers!

This was really good and as other reviewers suggested I browned my chicken in a little olive oil with some chopped garlic and onion.  I also sprinkled with Mrs. Dash. My husband actually ate the broccoli with no complaint as it was cheesy enough to hide the taste, LOL!!!  I used the cream of broccoli soup the recipe calls for but I find that is easily interchangable with any cream soup of your choice.  The sauce was not runny or lumpy so don't know what some of the other reviewers did wrong, maybe not stirring the soup well enough with the milk? I will definetly make this again.

This was just ok. Mine turned out kind of runny. I'm not sure why. Also, a little bland. I even added some seasoning to the chicken and some fresh garlic to the soup mixture and I still wasn't impressed. I don't think I will make again.

I used pre-cooked chicken strips that I had in the freezer.  I also used fat free mushroom soup mix and monterey jack as substitutes.  I thought it was good that night for dinner, but it was very good the next day for lunch once the mixture got a chance to sit and blend.  Thanks!

This dish is so easy to make.  What I did was used 1 lb of frozen broccoli(instead of fresh) and cooked my chopped chicken breast together in a pan.  Than added everything but the cheese and bread crumbs and poured in my 9 inch pie plate.  Instead of using bread crumbs, I crushed corn flakes on top which I think tasted better than the bread crumbs.  The bread crumbs somewhat give it a gritty feeling when eating.  Very good recipe. Will definitely make again.  My 1 and 3 year old loved it. Thanks

My husband and I really liked this recipe! I was REALLY good! I added sour cream, garlic and pepper to the cream of mushroom ( i didn't have cream of Broccoli on hand) and it turned out fantastic over rice! I am definitely keeping this for the recipe box...it was so EASY too! I would highly recommend it! thank you!!

First of all I want to say not only did my husband and I love this but my 18 month old and very picky 4 year old did as well!!

I used fresh broccoli and 3 chicken breasts.  The only changes I really made were margarine instead of butter, fat free cheddar in stead of the full fat kind, and I sprinkled a little 2% Cheese(mexican Blend)on top because I was trying to finish the bag.  Turned out PERFECT!

This recipe was pretty good! I like the quickness of it. I would use more bread crumbs next time and I didn't have fresh broccoli so I used a bag of frozen. Also, I thought just plain cooked chicken was going to be - well kinda of plain so I cooked my chicken in lemon pepper and basil seasonings first, then added it. It definitely added a much yummier flavor I think. Thanks!

Quick & easy.  Used Cream of Mushroom instead of Broccoli and it turned out great.  Leftovers were just as good.

this was really awesome!!! i made a couple changes: i used a bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower mix (just added it frozen to bottom of pan) and then sauteed the chicken in italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and red pepper and then used a scoop of mayo, a scoop of sour cream and mixed that with 1 can broccoli cheese soup and poured (or "globbed") on top. I added the buttery bread crumbs, cheese, then i crumbled some bacon over that. my boyfriend and his best friend ate it all!! and they loved it! it was great fooling them into eating veggies! i would probably leave the chicken out next time because it got over cooked but i really will make this atleast once a week! super easy!

This was a great recipe with some modifications.  I did not cook the broccoli.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 can of the broccoli soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  Instead of using all milk I used half milk and half mayo.  I also sauteed the chicken with garlic and poultry seasoning as mentioned by others.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was quick and yummy.  We love cheese in our family, so I did add a cup of cheddar, but I think I will be adding even more next time.  And to make it quicker, I think that I will use precut frozen chicken cubes and heat them up somehow.

Simple comfort food.  I did change it up some only becuase I had to use what I had on hand.  I didn't have enough fresh broccoli so also added one package of frozen broccoli with cheese sauce. Used leftover grilled chicken.  For the sauce I used Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom but also added 6 oz. of Heinze HomeStyle Chicken Gravey and 4 oz. low fat sour cream.  I layered as recipe recommends but also added a layer of cheese before adding the sauce. Topped with double sage flavored stuffing mix.  So there was plenty of cheese, the sauce was creamy with lost of chicken flavor and crunch topping.

Pretty good quick supperand the kids ate it which was a big bonus.  I didn't have any cream of broccoli and since a previous rater suggested cheddar cheese soup, I tried it.  A bit too cheesey, so I'm looking forward to trying it as suggested.

This was impressively good.  I had some reservations but tasting this put all of them aside.  I followed some other directions about increasing the bread crumb topping and doubling the recipe and I'm glad I did.  We'll definitely be eating leftovers tomorrow.  This was fairly quick to make and had terrific flavor.

This was really, really good.  Instead of just broccoli, I used carrots as well.  For the chicken, I simply diced up some skinless boneless breasts that I had.  I made a little more crumb topping than the recipe called for because it didn't look like quite enough to me, but that's just my pickiness.  Easy recipe that's great for after work or any busy day.  Thanks!

Very good, I couldn;t get cream of broccoli soup, so I used cream of asparagus which was fine.  The sauce was a little runny, so next time I will put some flour in to thicken.

I've made this with cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of broccoli soup and actually prefer it with the cream of chicken.  My husband, who is not the biggest fan of casseroles, loved the version with the cream of chicken soup. My five year old loves it either way.  A GREAT recipe.

So easy and family-friendly. I didn't have any cooked chicken so I just threw 2 boneless breasts on the old Foreman grill. I topped w/ wheat germ and no butter and served over rice. Will definitely make again and again.

This is a very good and very easy chicken divan, and it was also a hit with the kids! I make it all the time!

Tasty, I added a bit more cheese and bread crumbs.  My husband and picky kids loved it! Thanks.

My whole family loved this. I did not have cream of broccoli soup on hand so I used cream of chicken, which was really good. Yummy Yummy Yummy! Thank you for sharing this recipe. =)

My whole family LOVED this recipe.  I doubled it and still didn't have any leftovers! I will definitely be making this more often.

I added some garlic salt and pepper to the chicken when I cooked it. It made this wonderful recipe even better.

When growing up my stepmother used to make this all the time.  It was my favorite back then, and I'm so glad to find the recipe here.

Very yummy. This is now my boyfriend's favourite dinner. I use tomato and courgette soup, and throw in some potatoes.
