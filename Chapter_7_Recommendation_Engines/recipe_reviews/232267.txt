These were a great twist on my typical homefries.  I loved the addition of the green onions, which I feel were a definite must.  The cheese adds the perfect touch.  A definite make again.

I made these at camp in the electric skillet.  I probably used more than 2 T of peanut oil, but it did impart a nice flavor.  They browned nicely.  The only thing is the potatoes with cheese (I fine shredded a block of cracker barrel vermont white cheddar) were better than the ones without so next time I'd add a little more.  Thanks for sharing!

These were awesome!   I made them as is, but had to sub canola oil for peanut oil.  With a garden full of jalapenos, this will definately see the dinner (and maybe breakfast) table at the LTH house again. THANKS for the recipe!
