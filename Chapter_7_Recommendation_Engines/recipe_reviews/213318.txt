Yummy!  This casserole is very good and the whole family ate it all up!!  I did make a couple changes, but only because we did not have green chiles or red peppers on hand.  So, I omitted those two ingredients, and used an entire can of black beans.  My only suggestion is that you mix the soup, water and spices together, then add the 'chunky' items.  For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to put the tortillas in to the bowl, then pile everything else on top....yeah, not so much

Great recipe. To help with people wanting a little more spice in this recipe. I substituted the chiles for a can of sliced jalepenos. Gave the recipe a great flavor and not an overpowering burn of a jalepeno.

I think the idea is great, but should be used with enchilada sauce instead of cream of chicken. It COMPLETELY changes the taste.. yum

It was ok... took about 35 Minutes to cook. More of the issue was the flavor. It is missing something and could use a little more spice.  It was very easy to make.  This also may be a dish that tastes better the next day.

My family loved this, not much leftover!  I made a couple of minor changes, used Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup instead of cream of chicken, fresh salsa instead of tomato paste, green pepper instead of red, and pintos instead of black beans.  This is one of those recipes you can play with, which I like. Delicious!

Very good! I love this recipe. I do make a small change. I saute an onion and green bell pepper in a pan with the spices, then I add the soup, water, chilies, paste, chicken, and cheese. At the end I stir in the tortillas then put in the casserole dish. So good, I could make it every week.

This was good.  I did improvise some b/c I didn't have the beans, so instead I put refried beans at bottom of casserole dish and instead of these seasonings I added taco seasoning.  And instead of tomato sauce I used a little enchilada sauce.  I also baked it a little longer and added a lot of cheese to the top.  Everyone loved it.  It reminded me of chicken enchiladas.
