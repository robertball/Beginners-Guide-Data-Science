Fast and yummy, but it does feel a little like "college food."
I enjoyed it and will make it again.

pretty good, but i used chicken instead of boca (cage free of course) and broccoli in place of mushrooms (i like mushrooms but had frozen broccoli to use up so what the heck). i flavored it up with curry, garam masala, cumin, and ginger (my fave 4), it turned out very well. next time ill add cashews!
