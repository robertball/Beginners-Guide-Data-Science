This is just perfect for a fast, easy meal and I'm so glad your recipe was accepted SG.  I only used the smaller can of veg all and also added just about 1/2 cup of thawed hash browns.  I used a 9" deep dish pie crust that I took out of the aluminum pan and plopped it on top.  Baked for 40 minutes.  thank you again SG!

I think this would be quite a bit better with some vegetables to round it out.

Oh my goodness!  I made this exactly as written, and it was fantastic!  I did add some sliced canned potatoes, and it really made it great.  This is going to be a staple in my house from now on!  I think next time, I will use some cream of mushroom with the cream of chicken, to give added flavor.  I also used a pie crust on the bottom, as well as the top, and it made it so much better.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken, and it was delicious.  GREAT RECIPE!!!  Thanks!

Brought to a potluck, and it was a hit! Modified by reducing to 1 bag of frozen peas & carrots instead of canned, adding 2 ribs of sliced celery just prior to baking, adding 1 cup of small diced Yukon gold potatoes (blanched), & adding 1/2 TBSP of cayenne pepper to the filling. Per other reviewers' suggestions, we added the bottom crust too.  Lightly brushed the top crust with egg beaters, and it turned out beautifully!

Very good and quick. I love any recipe that uses a deli chicken. They are only $4.99 at Kroger. Made this exactly to the recipe. One serving leftover and there were only 3 of us eating. Must have been good.

This was a great recipe. It's similar to another one I'v e tried, but the addition of the butter onions and flour and milk instead of just the cream soup made for a richer thicker sauce. I didn't have a ready made crust so I made the crust myself and did a bottom crust too! It was a little more work, especially since I hadn't done crust in about 15 yrs! Well worth it! Great pot pie!

This was surprisingly good for such a quick and easy meal. I made a couple of small changes since I'm a vegetarian and it still turned out great! Used more onion and light butter. Subbed a package of seitan pieces for the chicken, and a can of Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup for the cream of chicken. Used almond milk in place of regular. I can't eat canned vegetables, so I used one package of frozen mixed vegetables and one package of lima beans, both thawed. I also used reduced-fat refrigerated crescent rolls for a one-crust pie, because that's what I had on hand and also to save fat/calories. This turned out great. There was not much left at the end of the night! Will def make again. Excellent comfort food that can be made quickly after a long day at work!

I really enjoyed making this.  My family loved it; and my son asked for seconds!  Impressive! I would recommend a bottom crust, it was hard to take out of the dish.  Nonetheless, yummy.

Easy Peasy.  I am not a cook, but somehow I managed to make a meal that even my picky 12 year old devoured.  Thanks for the recipe, which will become a permanent fixture on our dinner rotation!

I just made this tonight and it was delicious.  My husband who usually is not that excited about my cooking went for thirds!  Even my very picky 6 year old liked it.  I modified it slightly by adding fresh veggies instead of canned (carrots and broccoli work really well) and I also added some thawed hash browns to the mix as someone else suggested.  Great and easy recipe and I will be making it again soon!

I have not tried it this way yet, but plan to do it next time. Have you considered replacing the skim milk with a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup?

Love, Love, Love this recipe
It is perfect just as written but second time I modified it for my fussy roommate. I used frozen green beans, carrots and corn for veggies. I put the whole mess in individual 24 oz. remikins, and then I topped it with  canned biscuits that I rolled out to cover the top. It was a huge success and the roommate LOVED it.

Wow!  This was so good.  I made it as directed but also sautéed 1/4 cup of celery with the onion.  Took reviewers suggestions and added garlic.  I also added one chicken bouillon and a 1/4 tsp of McCormicks Montreal Chicken seasoning.  Sooo good!!! Everyone went back for seconds!! I tried another recipe that had 999+ 5 stars and it was so bland!  This one is great!! Will definitely make it again!

Way easy, great flavor and consistency.  The only change I made was using my wife's crust.
This dish will be around for a while in our place.
We used left overs from our own roasted chicken instead of rotisserie.

My thanks to the author.

made this for my family and it wasn't quiet as good as my other recipe. I tweaked it just a bit, instead of using rotisserie chicken I used chicken thighs which is what my family prefers and then I doubled it which I am not sure I should have done because it made enough to feed a small army is what my husband said LOL.

I'm rating this a 4 because I made some changes. I didn't have any pie crusts on hand so I topped it with biscuits (from the Chicken Biscuit Pie recipe on this site). I'm not a fan of canned veggies, so I cooked some chopped potatoes and carrots, and used frozen green beans and corn. My whole family loved it!

GREAT recipe, ONLY change I made was to use 1 can of chicken, and muffin mix.
 Turned out fantastic.
  Guess I make an instant single guy's meal for date night!

I haven't made chicken pot pie in forever and this was not planned. I used canned cream of mushroom, adding a bunch of frozen veggies, and seasoned every layer of this recipe. I seasoned the chicken and sauce with fresh garlic, onion powder, and Italian seasoning. If I didn't it would have been bland. Very easy to follow and I made Deliciously Easy Garlic Herb Focaccia instead of pie dough.

I had leftover chicken and decided to try this quick recipe. I had no pie crust and didn't have time to make pastry so made E-Z Drop Biscuits from this site for a topping. Hubby raved about the meal. I only used part of the biscuit recipe for dumplings so added some shredded cheese and we had biscuits with the meal.  The prep time for both was only 20 minutes so this was a very quickly made meal. Bravo!

With a little tweaking of my own, it was delicious.  It seemed rather dry when I mixed everything together, so I added chicken stock until it was more creamy.  Instead of canned veggies, i precooked potatoes and carrots and celery and left out the peas, as I'm not a fan.  Also used premade crusts for a top and bottom.  Even my picky husband loved it.  Will definitely make it again.

My family lives this recipe! I found it very favorable and easy to prepare. I used fresh vegetables instead of canned or frozen but followed the amounts listed in the recipe. I used Cream of celery soup.

My cooking knowledge so far consists of microwaving things, but I'm trying to learn and this recipe was simple enough for me not to mess up! Definitely delicious. I added extra chicken because my friends are growing teen boys, but I think next time I'll add something like celery for a little more crunch too.

I really, really liked this recipe for the ease of pulling it together and how well it turned out. The only downside was it seemed to lack a little flavor "umph". I don't know if it was the condensed soup I was using or what. I am not a huge fan of canned veggies so I used frozen and also threw in some diced carrots I had in the frig (this recipe is so good!)

Otherwise it was delish! Next time (which will be soon) I am going to look up a scratch recipe and see what was used in way of spices.  I am alsp going to look at some of the other reviewers and see what they say for this recipe, I always get good insight from you folks. While I know this sounds like a negative review, it really isn't! I loved it! Just needed a little somethin' somethin'!

Delicious and easy to adapt to what you have in the pantry. I didn't have cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom. I added frozen mixed vegetables. It was awesome.

I've been making this recipe for years.  It is a family favorite.  I don't care for Veg-All so I substitute with frozen peas and corn, throw in a hand full of matchstick carrots and some pre-cooked mini tator tots and call it good!  To save on clean up, I cook the onion & make the sauce in my Dutch Oven.  I toss the meat & veggies in the Dutch Oven and mix well.  I top the mixture with the pie crust, cut slits and bake as directed.  Easy and Delicious!

I used 2 cups of thawed mixed veggies and some diced celery with onion powder and garlic powder and two pie crust, one on bottom and one on top. Baked for 25-30 min. Really easy and will definitely make again!

I made this recipe with leftovers from the Whole Chicken Slow Cooker recipe from this site and added in some of the leftover cut up onions, carrots and potatoes that I added to that recipe.  Instead of canned vegetables, I added one cup of frozen mixed vegetables and also 1/4 tsp. of poultry seasoning.   I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I used just one crust for the top and it was WONDERFUL!   I will definitely make this again!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it several times and even did a few adjustments (ex. cooked the chicken with a chili seasoning) and it comes out great every time! I love it and have even passed on the recipe to friends and family.  Definitely will be making again and again.

Was worried it would be thin and runny, it was not at all. It was very thick and hearty. I made individual small pies at a cup of filling per pie. Added a egg wash on top. and baked them for 35 minutes in the oven. Everyone loved them!

I liked it, though I made it with both a top and a bottom crust.  Next time, I'll do just the top crust, for the calorie count.

my kids loved this and keep asking me when I will be making it again. I even doubled the recipe so I would have two pies. The only change I made was like other people added crust to the bottom.

even My Kids Like it!!! Only thing I did different was instead of canned Vegtables (cause I was out) I used fresh Celery and carrots chopped. I liked how it didn't have a bottom crust and used 98% fat free cream of chicken, made it so it was not so rich and heavy. will definatly be making this again.
