This was a BIG hit!!! Even better the next day. I did make a few changes. I used a jar of mushroom gravy in place of the beef and added some sliced mushrooms at the same time as the veggies. Also I used 3 pouches of Betty Crocker instant Garlic Mashed Potatoes. My hubby really liked it and said "I could definately eat this again"

This recipe was a hit at a potluck with my friends.  I couldn't find the Simply Potatoes so I used instant.  I don't think they were as good as the other ones would've been, but no one noticed.  I added a half a bag of frozen peas and carrots to the mix too.  Delicious!

i was looking for a sheperds pie recipe and this one seemed to be the best.  i cooked it for 10 people at work and it was a big hit.  i added a few dashes of worchestersihre sauce and a small can of tomato paste.  i like ground beef and gravy mixes to be a little tomatoy, not like spaghetti sauce, but with that tomato flavor. i also melted some cheese on top.  i didnt broil it like it says for the last few minutes. my only problem was i ran out of potatos, buy an extra container. A++ recipe.

This was fantastic!!  Everyone told me "this is a do again" (how we rate new recipes).  I did make a couple changes based on what other posters suggested: 1/2 the thyme, cheese on top of the potatoes (prior to broiler), cream of celery soup, and a little extra salt and pepper.  Also, the store I shop at does not carry the Simply Potatoes mashed potatoes so I substituted them for another brand of refrigerated potatoes.  Very easy and cheap to make!

This was a very simple recipe.  I had everything on hand, and managed to throw it together fairly quickly.  I used herb and butter seasoned instant mashed potatoes, and took the advice from other reviewers and topped it with cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  I don't think I have ever had shepherd's pie without cheese on top.  When I make this next time I will cut down on the thyme (think I might have put a little more than recipe called for), and definitely add more salt and pepper. 
Overall I recommend this!

I had an adventure with this one; i bought diced tomatoes with garlic and onion accidentally instead of the plain. I used canned veggies instead of frozen. I used a packet gravy mix and I couldn't find the Simply Potatoes so I used instant, and surprisingly, everything came out great!

SO Easy and really turned out tasty.  Kids really loved it which is a bonus.
I used Heinz jarred beef gravy which I wasn't too sure about but tasted good.  I used garlic salt instead of thyme and I used garlic mashed potatoes. 

We will make this again.

I thought this recipe was okay. My kids and my husband really like it though. I used extra lean ground beef to cut down on the fat but I think it also maybe made it less flavorful. It was definitely easy to throw together.

This is a very good recipe for Shepherd's Pie. You can definitely taste the thyme pretty strongly. Next time I'll use just a bit less of it.

I used canned vegetables instead of frozen and added peas and carrots. I also added a small amount of cheese on top for a little extra flavor. I thought 1 tsp. of thyme was a bit too strong. Next time I'll only use 1/2 tsp. of thyme. Otherwise it was a great meal and my family and guests loved it. It made plenty for 5 (with leftovers)and I had enough to freeze for another meal.

Shepherd's Pie uses lamb, Cottage Pie uses beef, I used ground turkey and turkey gravy so I called it Gobbler Pie and it was delicious! I used a bag of mixed veggies, 3 cups (defrosted and drained overnight), and decreased the thyme to 1/2 tsp. since I didn't know how it would taste with ground turkey. I used Philadelphia Chive and Onion mashed potatoes which I microwaved for approximately 1 1/2 minutes to make it easier to spread.  The only downfall was I didn't have a long 2 quart baking dish so it was runny--it didn't look like the picture someone else posted.  I will definitely make it again but I will buy a long 2 qt baking dish my round dish did not work well.

It was super easy to make. My grandmother has been loosing weight so I thought this would be a great all in one meal to help. I did not add the tomatoes thou, used packaged brown gravy and Betty Crocker loaded mashed potatoes instead. I will be adding a few things next time I make it thou. Like garlic, mushrooms and bell pepper.

I needed a new shepherd's pie recipe and this one definitely fit the bill.  No one in my family likes onions so I omitted them, and I substituted green peas instead of the beans because I already had them on hand.  I think next time I'm going to add some fresh mushrooms to the mix.  My 7 year old son loved this recipe and asked if it could be added to the menu again soon.

Very good! Almost exactly like grandmas. We had plenty of left overs, that didn't last very long at all. I'll definitly make it again, and the best part is you can take veggies away, or sub in different ones. Makes a different dish everytime!

This is a very good recipe.  Comfort food...I made as recipe stated but added extra potatoes.  The only thing I would consider changing is maybe a little less thyme. Very kid friendly too.  : )

This was a great success! As usual, I made some changes, based on what I had on hand...I used regular 'ol instant potatoes w/some garlic powder, replaced the can of tomatoes with a can of cream of celery soup, and used frozen mixed veggies. This was quick and easy and even the picky kiddos liked it ("ooh, gross" changed to "hey, yummy" as soon as the first bite was taken)! I served this with homemade Easy-Peasy Crescent rolls (I just submitted the recipe today) and there was barely enough left for my hubby's lunch tomorrow. Hooray!

Simply amazing. I had some frozen ground beef and wanted to make a yummy dinner and stumbled on this recipe and so happy I did. So easy to make, will definitely make again! I used instant cheddar garlic mashed potatoes (because thats all I had) I also added some fresh celery. Really enjoyed this dinner.

I’ve made it only I used russet potatoes mashed with sour cream and spread a layer of it before putting the meat mixture. Then I spread the rest on the top with grated cheese. My husband can’t get enough of it, I have to make it for him and his brothers once a week

I always make a new recipe exactly as called for the first time through, so I made no changes or substitutions to this and it was pretty much a dud in my household. It was too soupy (yes I drained the grease and tomatoes) and the package of potatoes called for was nowhere near enough to adequately cover the top. Might try again with more potatoes and no tomatoes (my picky teen didn't appreciate them), or try a different recipe.

It was too much tomato for my liking. This is a fairly simple recipe so I !ay make it again. If I do I'll cut the tomato in half. Also, one review mentioned adding mushrooms. That would add a more hearty flavor.

We haven't ate it yet but I was tasting it through the cooking process and I thought it was delicious. Would be really easy with frozen/canned veggies and if I could have found the jarred beef gravy. I'd never heard of that so made my own brown gravy from the packets for it.
I tried it before and after the thyme and I think it might have tasted better without it, to be honest - but it's still really good. I guess it depends on what sort of gravies/potatoes etc you use. 
One thing I will say is, I cut this recipe to feed four people (about a pound burger), and I've ended up having to use an extra casserole dish and with enough food for probably 9 people, comfortably...and we're not lean eaters!

Yesterday I thought Shepherd's Pie was actually a pie. A coworker suggested I try it, and this recipe was great! I used canned vegetables and omitted the gravy because it just didn't sound good to me. I used a store brand butter & herb instant mashed potatoes, and added some garlic salt and pepper. I didn't broil it, and next time I plan on adding cheddar cheese to the top. My fiance and I loved it!
