Probably would add some red bell pepper slices the next time just for a little sweetness and color.  Very nice side dish and quick too!

I really like this recipe because 1) I love bok choy and 2) this is super easy.  I didn't have any Chinese Five Spice, so I used some soy sauce for flavor.  I also used peanut oil because that's all I had in the pantry (no butter - out of that, too.)  I really, really like the cashews in this, also.  Yummy and healthy - can't ask for much more!

We do a food co-op and got a head of bok choy and no idea how to prepare it.  This recipe gave a great, quick method to cook it, as well as enough description for me to cut/prep it easily.  I do not have Chinese five-spice, but added 2 T. Thai sweet chili sauce instead.  Wow!  I did add green peppers and omitted the onion; I think that would have been a bit much with the onion-y flavor of the bok choy.  My kids were not fans, but the hubby LOVED it. Thank you so much for a great starting point!

I made this as a low carb main dish. I substituted monk fruit sweetener for the sugar. Sauteed thin sliced sirloin first then added it back to the vegetables when the recipe was almost done.

I made my own Chinese 5 spice with 1/8 tsp of fennel seed, anise seed, clove, cinnamon, and coarse ground black pepper.  I also added a pinch of dried lemongrass. I added a carrot as well.

I bought bok choy on a whim at the grocery store but had never prepared it before.  I used this recipe mainly for an idea of the proportions of seasonings.  This was a hit for my family, and very easy to prepare, even with two distracting kids in the kitchen.  I use chinese five spice a lot in my cooking, and my whole family, even my three year old, enjoys the flavor.  I cooked two cubed chicken breasts in a skillet with oil, salt, pepper and five spice, then removed the chicken and most of the juice from the pan.  I then cooked the bok choy, onion, and one sliced red pepper that I needed to use up, according to this recipe, adding the chicken back to the pan after five minutes, and cooking everything together for 3 minutes.  I was a little worried that 8 minutes would be too long to cook the greens, but with the thicker stem, the sliced onion, and the red pepper, 8 minutes was perfect to get everything nice an cooked without being mushy.  I'll hang on to this recipe to refer to the oil/five spice/sugar ratio and cook times for future dinners.

Yum!  I haven't tried the Chinese 5 spice powder before.  It's really good and just the right flavor for the bok choy.  We added broccoli and carrots to our mix as I needed to use them up. The sugar was just the right touch too.  I was hesitant about that, and am glad I went ahead and used it. Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  Thank you very much for this recipe.  We'll be making it again.

Thanks for the awesome recipe! I needed a recipe for bok choy from a CSA box.The first recipe I tried was horrible and the bok choy bitter, so took a chance on this one. I didn't have enough bok choy so added a small head of napa cabbage also from the CSA box, so together about a 50/50 mix which made the  right amount called for in this recipe. The only other thing I had to change was to use slivered almonds instead of cashews since apparently hubby ate all the cashews:) Everything was very flavorful. The bok choy as not bitter as before, and the oil/butter was just enough to coat all the veggies, but not have them be too oily. The 5-spice powder really made all the difference. Fabulous taste! Definitely a keeper.

I’ve never cooked bok choy before and was looking for a simple recipe to try it with, I think I’ve found it here.  I did substitute a few ingredients to suit what I had on hand, olive oil for the grape seed oil, and instead of Chinese five spice and sugar, I used 2 tablespoons sweet Thai chili sauce. Very good. I’ll make this again. Thanks

This is quick, easy and versatile. I stick to the basic recipe but will add napa cabbage and walnuts in place of the cashews.I also use peanut oil not grapeseed. It also is good reheated in the microwave. Don't overcook.

I added tofu, red bell pepper and served over rice. Didn't have any grape seed oil, so I just used regular oil; also, didn't have chinese spice, so I used 1 tablespoon of soy sauce instead. Turned out great! And super tasty :)

This was pretty good. Nothing fantastic. Doubled the five spice powder. The cashews were a nice addition (I used peanuts)

Delicious recipe! I did use the Chinese Five Spice and added a bit of sesame oil as well. Will definitely make again.
If looking for Chinese Five Spice it can be ordered from penzeys.com , a wonderful fresh spice shop!

I did make substitutions because of what I had on hand--fish sauce, lime juice instead of Chinese 5 Spice, and almonds instead of cashews.  Easy and delicious.

Pretty good all in all.. i subbed hazelnuts (aka filbert) for the cashews, peanut oil for the grapeseed. For making 4 servings, my wife and I did it in, all by ourselves. Very tasty.
