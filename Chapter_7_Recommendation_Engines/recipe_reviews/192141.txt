3/29/11:  I really debated whether to review or not, especially since I plan to make these again as is, but decided to add my two cents before making this again and let pple decide whether or not to ignore me.  I adjusted the amount of rice vinegar up (to approx 1/4 c) and the amount of honey down (to 1 tbsp) and I felt that imparted the right amount of tart with sweet for myself.  Bf, however, was not impressed, so I'll make him the recipe as is.  To be fair, I'm not a sweet pickle fan--I'll eat them (I LOVE pickles) but I love dill--the more sour and tart, the better.  So, I have to say I wouldn't like the recipe as is.  Bf, however, may, so I will make it again to see what he thinks.  3/30/11:  I remade this dish adhering more closely to the recipe (I didn't measure--was too lazy).  I felt they were too sweet for me, but bf liked them.  He said they weren't too tart for him.  I think what people need to know is this:  he LOVES bread and butter pickles and isn't a huge fan of vinegar.  I think if you have similar tastes to bf, you will like these.  If you are more a dill pickle, tart fan, these won't do it for you.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried some delicious cucumbers in a tasty vinaigrette at a Chinese buffet and was really hoping this was the recipe, which it wasn't.  Not much flavor.

These are really good, and super quick.  To me, they're more sweet than sour - adjust the honey/vinegar mixture to your liking.
