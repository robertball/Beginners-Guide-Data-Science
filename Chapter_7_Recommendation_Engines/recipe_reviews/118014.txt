Because so many people commented that the rhubarb flavor was not that intense I made a little addition of my own.  I pureed about 3/4 c rhubarb and cooked it in a cup of simple syrup until gooey.  I cut the brown sugar down by half and added my rhubarb puree (cooled)right before the flour.  This helped amp up the rhubarb taste.

Oh my gosh! I never post reviews for anything, but I got SO many compliments on these I just had to come back here! I followed the recipe exactly and got cookies that looked just like the picture. They were delicious! People that don't like rhubarb and/or coconut even found them irrisistable. In fact, I just went out to the garden and grabbed a bunch more rhubarb and am going to double the recipe for even more cookies.  One tip: to completely stir in the final two ingredients, I ended up using my hands and kneading it like bread dough. That mixed everything together quite nicely!

Something new to do with rhubarb! I used 2 cups of frozen rhubarb, defrosted in the microwave, and added the juice left over in the bowl. I also added some chopped walnuts, and did not frost. Turned out really yummy and not too sweet.

Yummy!!  These cookies are a huge hit with my family, although I didn't use coconut as I didn't have any.  Some reviewers have said their cookies were flat; I suggest using cake flour if you're concerned about flat cookies, or just let them sit in the fridge for about one hour before baking.  Next time I will use larger chunks of rhubarb to get a more noticeable rhubarb flavour. I used 1/8" dice and will use maybe 1/2" next time.  Great with or without icing.  Thanks for a different and really nice way to use rhubarb!

These are really good, very soft. I love the addition of the coconut. I replaced half of the shortening with butter for more flavor. I chilled the dough before baking so they wouldn't spread out too much. I had some coconut left over, so I toasted it and sprinkled on top of the frosted cookies.

After reading everyone else's comments,  I altered the recipe by adding a splash of vanilla, omitting the coconut, and adding about 1 1/4 c. coarsely chopped pecans.  I used King Arthur all-purpose flour and I cut the fresh rhubarb, about 2 cups, into about 1/2" slices, based on what others had written about the lack of intensity in smaller sized pieces.  I used a teaspoon to pick up the dough, and then used my fingers to push each cookie together slightly, but not too much.  I tried not to flatten them before baking, and they all stayed rounded just like the original photo! (I cooled the cookie sheets as much as possible between baking and that always helps keep any cookies from flattening out from the retained heat of the cookie sheets.) I was very careful not to bake them longer than 13 minutes, which kept them soft.  I didn't frost them, but felt that the combination of tartness and sweetness was just right without any additional sweetness.  They were some of the best cookies I've ever made!

These are awesome cookies!  I did not add the coconut as my family does not like it.  They were crispy on the outside and soft inside, even great without the icing!  I will be making these again and again during rhubarb season!

We loved these cookies. I have never thought the rhubarb can be used to make cookies. As the previous reviewers, I can say that the rhubarb flavor wasn`t intense, but we loved the flavor. I didn`t make the frosting because wanted to decorate cookies by my own. This is a great recipe to use rhubarb not just for pies and cakes.

I have never heard of Rhubarb Cookies before so thought with all the good reviews I'd try them.  The only difference I made was add a little vanilla to the recipe.  PERFECT!  I'd make these again.  Very good.

These were great! A different way to use up the rhubarb. I only made a couple of small changes (added a tsp of vanilla and a little more rhubarb - 2 1/4 cups). Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Amazing!!!  I did cut the recipe in half, knowing that my kids wouldn't eat any (and 15 was more than enough for just my husband and me).  These are like little rhubarb cakes. I followed the recipe, taking the idea from Dianne to top the frosting with some toasted coconut.  I ran out of coconut, so a few didn't get any, and the ones with the coconut were much better.  This is a great recipe to use up some of that rhubarb.

Not a bad cookie.  Nice and tender.  I added pure lemon extract and omitted the vanilla in the frosting to give it a fresher taste.  They were a little too sweet otherwise for my taste.

A nice cookie with the same comfort value as an oatmeal cookie.  That being said, next time I will add nuts and/or another fruit.  The rhubarb just didn't come through.  I used less coconut so that didn't bring much flavor.  I also used 2 cups of defrosted rhubarb from the garden.  Very moist!

These cookies were good, but to amp up the rhubarb taste, I used the rhubarb jam from this site and substituted it for 1/4 cup of the "shortening" (I only use butter). I also made a powdered sugar/rhubarb jam icing for the top instead of the frosting. It turned out great!

What a fantastic way to use rhubarb!  I made these last night and froze them unfrosted for Father's Day.  They're so good without frosting, cakey and sweet-tart. The coconut surprised me but it works very well in the cookie.   I bought some more rhubarb today to make some more!

This recipe yielded 65 1-1/2" cookies (made balls about 1" round) .  I was totally, pleasantly surprised by the taste of the cookie dough!   And they're delicious once baked.  I was concerned because the dough was pretty dry before I added the rhubarb, but somehow it turned out perfectly!   I used butter because I don't have shortening.  The frosting is not needed, but I added a few drops of lemon oil to the frosting recipe, just cause I love lemons.  Seriously good recipe!

We had a little less than a cup of rhubarb from our CSA, so we halved the recipe and LOVED it!  My husband generally dislikes rhubarb, while my daughter and I love it - we all enjoyed the cookies, and though I would love to add more rhubarb, the non-rhubarb lovers can enjoy this also, which was fine with me.  :) ... Two years later, we're making this again with rhubarb from our own garden - definitely a keeper!

I really liked that the rhubarb takes a starring role in the flavor of these cookies.  They are pretty cake-y - almost like a muffin top, but very good.  After I made them I tried one before frosting it and decided to leave the frosting off.  I felt it was going to detract from the great rhubarb kick.  Very good!

I didn't use the frosting on these cookies, they don't need it.  I also didn't use the coconut because I didn't have enough.  I baked the first batch for 12 minutes and the rest for 15 as the rhubarb needed the extra cooking time.  I made the dough then refrigerated it for about a day.  When I got it out it had a bit more moisture in it from the rhubarb, so these are best to bake the same day.

WOW!!!  For me chocolate chip won't be ever the go to cookie. These are to die for. Then again anything you taste right out of the oven tastes heavenly. I loved this recipe. It makes more like 50 cookies if you use a small ice cream scooper which I recommend so the cookies don't go flat on you. But I did put them in the fridge for a bit before putting them in the oven. The first 20 I baked I added no coconut and they were good. The second with coconut were good too if you like coconut. But I guess I like the pure taste of rhubarb. I did put 2 cups of rhubarb and a bit more. I didn't frost them as I don't care for frosting although that's a good frosting recipe. The cookie itself is not too sweet so I'm sure they well be good with frosting too.

These cookies are amazingly yummy!  They are crisp on the outer edges but soft and chewy on the inside.  The rhubarb is soft and tart with the yummy sweetness of the brown sugar.  They are not too sweet by any means.  You cannot even taste the coconut really.  The only thing I did differently was used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and then 2 cups of  unbleached flour and instead of shortening I used coconut oil.  These cookies will definitely be something I make more often.  and with all kinds of other fruit too.  They are super yummy!

YUM! These are great without the icing (I didn't have any cream cheese) They taste like a really great oatmeal cookie. In fact, I wonder if you could add oatmeal if you increased something liquid as the batter is pretty dry.

What a great and different way to use  rhubarb!

I didn't know that rhubarb cookies existed and I am so glad I found this recipe. They are SO good! I love rhubarb, although I'm not fussy for coconut, but these are SERIOUSLY delicious. And so easy! I used margarine instead of shortening, upped the rhubarb to 2 cups (bigger chunks) and skipped the icing. An easy five stars!

I would have given this recipe five stars if ONLY the recipe suggested more rhubarb! 1.5 cups simply was not enough :( But the cookie itself was great.

My cookies were a little flatter than the orginally photo submitted for this recipe showed... but they taste outstanding! Moist and slightly chewy--a real treat! The frosting takes it over the top - may be a little too sweet for some. Overall, a great cookie! Fun way to use some rhubarb! I LOVE the use of brown sugar in this recipe! Prepared as directed, adding a splash of vanilla. YUM!

Very good but doubled the rhubbarb and slightly softened the rhubbard in the microwave and let cool before adding to mix.

Everyone I shared these cookies with loved them. I did not frost them. We enjoyed the tart flavor of the small pieces of rhubarb!! A great new way to use rhubarb.

These are very good cookies, just wish the rhubarb flavor was more intense.  I'll use the suggestions to leave the pieces bigger and maybe add a little extra next time.

I really like these cookies - it's nice making something different with rhubarb!  Mine turned out a little flat - look nothing like the picture.  Also, I can't imagine putting frosting on them!  They're so good plain and I think frosting would really take away from the taste of the cookie.  I think they taste like the best part of a rhubarb muffin - the top!  They're crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I could eat lots of these!!!

This recipe is a favorite with many people here. I do not use the cream cheese frosting though, instead I make Rhubarb Whoopi Pies out of them with my own whoopi pie filling. Scrumptious!!

These are awesome, I just finished making them. I added a little food coloring to frosting. My Husband has already had seconds. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I like the idea of rhubarb cookies because they are unique, I just wasn't thrilled with these.  I was skeptical of them, but I definitely think they are good.  I just don't think they are exceptional.  I would prefer other rhubarb desserts or other cookies better.

I've made these before and they are delicious!  They never last long in my house.  My only complaint is that they spread out and don't bake up very well.  I will still make them again, and again since they taste sooooo GOOD!

I loved these cookies, but I found the icing to be a touch too sweet. Next time I might forgo the icing or give it a very light coating.

These were very different then any cookie I've had. Good, but my family didn't really appreciate these.

Wonderful cookies!  I had some left over buttercream frosting that I used and that worked very well with these cookies.  Between my husband and step son, they were gone in 2 days!  Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies had a great flavor, you would like them even if you didn't like coconut or rhubarb.  Mine were pretty flat though, maybe I used too much fresh rhubarb.  I didn't end up frosting them because they were so flat and tender.  I will try them again and see if they are more cake like so I can frost them.
