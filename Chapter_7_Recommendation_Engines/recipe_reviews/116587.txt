My husband and daughter were adamant yesterday that they wanted pizza for dinner. I was equally adamant that as it's been raining nearly continuously for the past 3 days I was not going out to get the ingredients for their usual pizza. So I did a search and came up with this recipe to use ingredients I already had in. They are very glad I did. The proportions for the crust were perfect and the colour of the crust was lovely. With the topping I did leave out the olives due to personal preference. I also added in the onion and pepper to the meat before it was completely cooked to soften them a bit. I might add a little more hot pepper sauce into the topping next time. But otherwise this was perfection. Thankyou so much.

EXCELLENT! I mixed the dough in my bread machine and hat worked out great. To the dough I also added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. onion powder aong w/ the rest of the ingredients called for. For the meat mixture, after I drained the meat, I quickly sauteed the onion and green pepper in the same pan, just to start to soften them. I then added in a little minced garlic. I added the meat back in along w/ the mushrooms, green olives, a can of sliced black olives, the rest of the can of sauce, another 8oz. can of sauce (b/c it was a little too dry for me) and salt and pepper, to taste. This smelled amazing while it was baking and the taste was a wonderful mix of flavors. I like how you can pretty much customize this to your family's liking. I think I may add in some pepperoni in as well next time. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)
