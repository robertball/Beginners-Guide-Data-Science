I've been making this wonderful salad for a while,  with minor changes--I love and use Gala apples, omit onions, and add 'Craisins'. NO MIRACLE WHIP. Eat from bowl, wrapped in tortilla, or on bread!

Delicious!!  This tastes VERY similar to the chicken salad they make at Arby's, which is exactly what I was looking to duplicate - thanks!  As other reviewers mentioned, I left out the Miracle Whip and I just doubled the mayo instead.  Such a versatile recipe - leave out what you don't like or substitute with ingredients you do like.  You can't go wrong with this one, it's a keeper!

Just made this for my husbands lunch. Took the advice of another reviewer and used gala apples and added cranberries. replaced walnuts with pistacios. Put in 1/2 of small red onion and it's not overwhelming. This was delicious. I also used 10 Tbsp of olive oil mayo instead of using 5 miracle whip and 5 mayo. Will definitely make this again.

I made it without the Miracle Whip. The onion was a bit overwhelming for me and my hubby, so next time I will either cut the amount half or omit it all together.

Excellent!  I didn't have all the ingredients but it was awesome.  I had regular yogurt, so used more lemon juice, used sweet onions, red apples and no celery. OK I had to change it but the original recipe is a perfect standard to work from.  The yogurt was a healthy, delicious option.  Will make it again and with all the recipe ingredients.

So GOOD! I substituted almonds for the walnuts, craisins for the grapes (since I didn't have any) and left out the lemon juice. It's AMAZING!! This recipe will be in heavy rotation for sure!

Loved this!  Was a great summer lunch.  Had it over Hawian rolls.  Reminds me of the chicken salad summer sandwich from Wendy's.  Very good, I have already shared this with family.

Everyone loved it! I used a lemon pepper rotisserie chicken, omitted the red onions, & omitted the Miracle Whip (just added a little more mayo) as others suggested. For the yogurt, I used a Yoplait French vanilla single serving container. I will definitely be making it again.

I recently had chicken salad from a restaurant with apples & grapes and loved it so I wanted to try making it at home.  This recipe is really good.  I made a few adjustments for my own taste and pantry, I don't like celery so I used celery salt, went with gala apples instead of granny smith, used vanilla greek yogurt and cubed the chicken instead of shredding it.  With those substitutes it's a definite keeper recipe.  
The recipe made a ton so next time I'll half it but I would recommend!!

I had never tried chicken salad before, and had no real idea what to expect. I decided to try this recipe without changes, and WOW! This is an excellent dish, perfect for summertime meals and very family friendly. I will make this again, and again!

I tried this recipe and followed the directions exactly as was given.  It was delicious!  My husband commented on it several times and was very disappointed when he discovered it had all been eaten.  Definitely will make again!

Just made this cuz I had a whole rotisserie chicken I needed to use up. I didnt have enough lemon juice, nor the yogurt. However, I did substitute yogurt ranch dressing and cut back on the onion as others suggested.  I also added a bag of cranberries & honey glazed walnut mixture. Came out very good. Will definitely make this again, but will be sure to have all the ingredients!

I added  fresh  grated parmesan to the dressing.  I  like to make things  ahead of time, so I  made the dressing and  put it in a plastic bag overnight  with the cooked & cubed chicken.  Then right before I served it I added the fruit.  Sometimes I serve it over a bed of mixed greens and garnish with sliced  almonds.

Perfect for me....my husband likes more dressing....
If serving for guests (although my guests loved it as is) I may double the dressing as a side option .... I loved the dressing!,
The entire salad was a winner!!!

This is a great recipe, and easy to customize. I've never used Miracle Whip, so I sub Blue Plate. Almost never have yogurt, so I don't use it. Lime juice can be used if you don't have lemon. After making it a couple of times, you can judge the amounts you like up or down. Just make sure you don't forget the apples, grapes and walnuts--- and the chicken!

Read the reviews and there appeared to be an overwhelming opinion to omit the Miracle Whip so I did.  I picked up a few other ideas that seemed like excellent substitutions for my tastes so I omitted the onion, used Craisins instead of grapes, Gala apples and opted for glazed walnuts.  Super easy and the taste was fabulous.  I am definitely adding this recipe to my "go to" book.  This would be a fabulous salad to take as a "dish to pass" - eaten just as is, on a bed of lettuce or on any type of sandwich roll.

We did not used Granny Smith apples. We just used what we had . It still ended being a great salad. We also used not as much Walnuts. This recipe will remind you of that summer salad served at Arby's.

This recipe was the best I've ever tried! I added a few things of my own, such as a cup of crushed pineapple, and instead of Vanilla Yogurt, I used Coconut Vanilla Greek Yogurt. Turned out absolutely phenomenal. Thank you for the ideas!!

I spent a lot of time and money buying and preparing the ingredients to this salad. I was so excited to try it. Maybe it's the combo of mayo,vanilla yogurt and onions that give it a weird taste. I should've read the modifications in the other review.  :(

Loved the recipe. Used a fuji apple, breast meat from a rotisserie  chicken and all miracle whip, no mayo.  Next time I would use less onion or try green onions instead.

I've been making chicken salad for quite a while for my mom, who doesn't enjoy eating many things anymore. This is hands down the best- she loves it. I think it's the extra sweetness of the yogurt and the balance of simple flavors that really sets this recipe apart from the dozens i have tried. I make the recipe as written and agree with other reviewers that you wouldn't need the Miracle Whip if you didn't have it.

Great summer chicken salad. I make only one change...no miracle whip. In place of MW I used Avocado oil mayo. It reminds me a little of MW. 
I have made this several times. This I great with leftover rotisserie chicken. I also added about 2 Tbs tarragon. on another try I added 2 Tbs freeze dried basil. Make sure your herbs are not too old. 
Just a great recipe. Than you.

I'm always looking for ways to keep the pounds off and it's the simplest way, LOW CARB, LOW SUGAR, HIGH PROTEIN.  That's the answer to all those TV Ads trying to get your money. One more tip, don't buy Anything unless you Read the Back of the Lable. If you don't buy it, you can't eat it ??

This is awesome! I used all mayo instead of miracle whip as that's all we had on hand. The shredded chicken makes it so much better than using diced chicken.

This recipe is very versatile. I didn't have granny apples, so I used fuji apples. I substituted plain Greek yogurt since I had some on hand and used more grapes for added sweetness. I skipped the nuts since I was serving a crowd, but will add them next time when I make it for my family. I really like this recipe and will definitely make it again.

It was so good and I will make it again for sure. The only change I would make is to cut the apple pieces smaller then I did the first time. The dressing was light and so very good.

Just made this and it is delicious! No walnuts so added pecans. No red onions, so used vidalia. No miracle whip, no big deal! Delicious.

This recipe was soo good!! I made some alternations just because of my own taste-I used Greek yogurt and mayo for the dressing with a little sprinkle of sugar to sweeten it up! Left out the lemon and onion....and it is delicious!!

Made it for the dinner tonight.  My husband loves it. Quick and easy on a 97 degree day. I make my own vanilla yogurt and don't add the Miracle Whip. I also use grapes if on hand or just a handful of craisins. This is under my favorites for quick reference.

This is a wonderful chicken salad.  It taste just like Arby's Chicken Salad. I made it just exactly as posted the first time and had to take a benadryl.  I  am allergic to uncooked egg whites therefore I cant use Mayo or Miracle Whip. Instead I used 10 tablespoons of sour cream.  I also added Craisins,  1 small can of mushrooms, and artichoke hearts second time around.  Just amazing.

I like this recipe, but I don't use vanilla yogurt. I think the yogurt gives it a funny taste, so instead I substituted light sour cream. I am a huge fan of chicken salad and I will use this again.

Delicious. I didn't have any miracle whip so I added 1/4 tsp of dry mustard. I also set half of it aside and added curry.  I also omitted the nuts.  Both were delicious.

This was really good. I didn't use the onion though. Not a fan of them in something that is mostly sweet.

My go to chicken salad recipe now. Made over the holidays at parties and doing for football. LOVE it. Always a BIG hit. I make it as is, and I ONLY use green granny smith apples as the grapes and yogurt are sweet enough. After I prepare the salad, I split it in half and put walnuts in one half and no walnuts in the other half for non-nutters.  I fill finger rolls, wraps and also fill lettuce leaves to appeal to different appetites.  So delicous!

love this--either on toast or just on a plate; also have made it with just plain/nonfat greek yogurt for my daughter and she likes it that way.  Easy to make with what is on hand!
