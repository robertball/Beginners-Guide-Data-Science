These are fast, easy and a bake-sale hit! (Thanks & YUM!)
Timesaving Tip: Skip the extra step (and clean-up) of melting the chocolate chips. . .just spread an even layer of chips directly on the crust.

These were amazing. I liked this recipe because it didn't add anything unnecessary.  They taste just like smores.....soooo good.  I made two batches for a event, and I didn't bring home one single scrap.  I used mini chocolate chips, and it worked great, but going to try this time with melted chocolate.  Don't be tempted to use more chocolate than called for, it will through off the balance.  Yum...you won't be sorry.

These are very rich and tasty.  If you are eating them after they have cooled, there are much better after 30 seconds or so in the microwave so they are gooey.  Based on several comments, I tried cutting the amount of butter in the crust in half.  The crust did not harden, so I ended up with a bunch of graham cracker crumbs loose in the bottom of the pan when I cut up the bars.  Next time, I will try again with the full amount of butter indicated.

I made this recipe for my husband (who loves s'mores). I halved the recipe and used a 9x9 dish. It was fantastic warm and gooey out of the oven and really good cooled. My husband and I both prefer it warm so we nuke it for 20 seconds before eating. It was very quick and easy to make (only a few minutes of prep) even though I had to crush the crackers. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate and it was wonderful. I also added a little sugar to the graham cracker crumbs and butter mixture to make it a little sweeter.

YUMMM..My five year old daughter and I just finished these, so fun and so easy.  We just put the candy bars on the bottom layer, topped with marshmallows then graham cracker topping, but it all in the oven and baked.  No need to melt chocolate first.  These are good warm and gooey, can't wait till the kids get home from school to try!

These are really tasty bar cookies. I used a 12 ounce bag of milk choc chips instead of the candy bars, worked great. Definitely refrigerate pan before attempting to cut. I made these for a school function, and I had compliments from adults & children! The best comment I heard was "ohh, these look homemade, I want one of these"

my changes: 
-only 1 cup of butter 
-put the whole graham cracker mixture on the bottom (of a cookie sheet, needs to be a little deep)
-spread chocolate chips over and put it in the oven for 5 minutes to melt a little
-spread mini marshmallows over the top and cooked for the allotted 15 minutes. in retrospect i'll only do 10 as the marshmallows turned out too crispy/a little hard

these are super delicious and might even be better than the real thing

I made these just because I had everything on hand.  No regrets.  I haven't tried them cooled yet, but they are very tasty warm and gooey.  I followed the suggestion of a previous review and put chocolate chips directly on top of the crust without melting them first.  Worked out great and less mess to clean up.  Will make again.

These are great! Tasty and so easy. My kids and I made them last night for my son's birthday treat for school today. I added 1/3 cup of sugar to the graham cracker mix. There's a lot of butter and I think that I will cut back on butter the next time. We used a small (11 oz., I think) bag of milk chocolate chips layered over the crust (not melted), followed by 2-3 cups of mini marshmallows then the rest of the crust mix. It took about 20 minutes to bake, not 15- I kept them in until the marshmallow around the edges just began to brown. Let them cool and cut them. Covered them overnight and served them today and all the kids (and the teacher) LOVED them. There were soft and chewy. Will definitely make these many more times!!

These turned out very sweet, but still super tasty! I only had 1 cup of butter at my house, so I just used that. Per other reviews, the crust did turn out slightly crumbly, but this did get better the next day. I am not a huge fan of milk chocolate in dessert bars, so I used 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 white chocolate chips. I just sprinkled them on top without melting them and this turned out perfectly! Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely be using this again and again!

I love this recipe!! Do not use Pam or such, butter the pan. I made the crust and used milk chocolate pieces -- put it in oven until just almost melted [about 10 min]. took pan out and while hot, sprinkled main marshmallows and rest of crust on top. total time was about 15 minutes. my friend and I ate half the pan after it was cooled. But it is rich and soooooooooooooo good!  will definitely make again [and again]  my friend already asked when will she get more:)

Sweeet!  We combined milk choc. and semi sweet chips.   We used 1/2 cup butter (all we had) and just spooned it into a small dish.  I would add more butter if I had it but it wouldn't keep me from making the same if I was short.

Not sure why, but this didn't turn out for me. The graham crumbs were soggy instead of crisp. Otherwise, it tasted fine, but it had to be eaten with a fork!

These were OK, the graham crackers were really crumbly which made them hard to serve out of the pan on a tray. I think if I'm that hungry for smores I'll just make the real thing toasting the marshmallow over a candle  :-)

I halved the recipe and used semi-sweet chips. They're delicious but I think next time I will use milk chocolate. I think it just depends on preference. I prefer milk to semi-sweet so for me, I think milk would be better. Good recipe!

Pretty good, but I felt the crust was too buttery, and it didn't set too well.  Everyone else seemed to really like it though.

This is a really good dessert! People keep asking me to make it again.  I've made it with chocolate chips (both semisweet and milk) which is way easier.  I add a little bit more chocolate and marshmallows than the recipe calls for and it is fabulous.

I think there might be something off with the proportions in this recipe. There was a lot more butter than I needed and it made the graham crackers really soggy. I would say maybe half the amount of butter would suffice. 
The concept is good though; just needs a little tweaking.

These bars were so good.  However, next time I think I will reduce the amount of butter because the crust fell apart.

My nephew, who's 7, absolutely loved these!  I'm a big smores fan, so I had to try these.  I was a little worried about the greasiness when I was pressing it into the pan, but it helped to hold everything together.  I would definitely make these again!  Thanks for the recipe! :)

For some reason the graham crackers were very crumbly even using the amount of butter in the recipe, so was unable to cut and serve.  Tastes yummy, so using it as as a topping over ice cream.

Like other reviews suggested, I used 1 cup of butter.  I like extra chocolate chips and marshamallows so that's what I did.  It was so delicious!!!!

I changed a bit. I used 1 cup of butter, 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs, a bag of milk chocolate chips and 2 cups of mini marshmallows. Also, I baked for 10 minutes and put it under the broiler for a few minutes till browned. Delicious!

A great alternative for our Fourth of July celebration. I made it as is and it was a crowd-pleaser. In my opinion you definitely don't need to add more sugar to the crust. It is already very sweet.

A++++ everyone in my house gobbled this up (3 sons and a husband) and had seconds.  It was very rich and ooey gooey.  Very delicious!  I made as directed except laid 6 Hershey bars between the first layer of graham cracker crumbs and marshmallows.  It melted when cooked.  I prefer milk chocolate anyway(instead of traditional chocolate chips).  This recipe doesn't disappoint!!

Delicious - a HUGE hit with everyone who has tried them. To save time, just break the chocolate bars into sections and place them on top of the crust without melting them. The time in the oven will do fine.

I made this for my son's Boy Scout Code of Honor.  They loved it.  I did follow other reviewers and layered chocolate chips instead of melting.  After cooling I put it in the freezer to harden then cut into squares.  Will make again.

The crust didn't turn out at all--it was WAYYY too much crust, and it was crumbly. The rest of it technically turned out okay, but I felt that overall it was a fairly plain dessert. I'd rather have a regular s'more anyday. If I'm going to take the trouble to make any kind of pie, this one isn't worth it. Just not enough flavor, and not good enough to try again.

Just be careful not to burn the chocolate.  Also, just layering chocolate chips works too.

I liked it a lot all except there was a bit too much graham crackers, I think next time ill use only 3 cups of graham crackers. Other than that, really good! I would definitely put it in Tupperware though!

Thank You Whistle2000 for sharing this. I took them to a meeting and they were gone almost instantly.
I had 3 S'more kits in Que from the summer.I needed to use them before the graham crackers went stale. The kit included full size marshmallows, packs of graham crackers and of course HERSHEY bars. I appreciated that the crust used the actual measurement required instead of "a box of crumbs". 
I took some reviewers suggestions. 1. Just to use the candy bars whole, w/o worrying about chopping them up. (less time and work), and to broil the marshmallows a quick minute.
I made an error which I did remedy. I had the large marshmallows, and was planning on chopping them in the food processor. Please do not laugh at me. Most of you probably know that did NOT work.*G* I used the marshmallows as they were. The recipe states miniatures for good reason. That was not very smart because they did not blend in as they should have. To remedy this, when I took them out of the oven, I took a fork and squished them down. Then I put them back in the oven and broiled them to a toasty golden color. So you can use large marshmallows, but I would suggest taking the time to cut them in small pieces. 
Of course that comes back to the original recipe. This is why it was written as it is. AND I see no point in substituting margarine for the butter! (this is NOT what the recipe states). The real butter makes it so yummy.
I will make this recipe again, and get the tiny marshmallows...

This was a fantastic, easy dessert that tastes delicious. I love marshmallows, especially when roasted, and these smores bars evoke campfire memories. I pressed the graham cracker mixture into my pyrex pan, cooked it for a few minutes, sprinkled some mini dark chocolate chips on top, put it in the oven for two minutes, and then covered the mixture with marshmallows and crumbles of the graham cracker mixture. I couldn't wait, so I spooned some into a tea cup right out of the oven, but they taste great a few days later, too.

So good.  I used mini Hershey Bars and baked it all at once - no premelting.  I was in love with it and all my friends kids gobbled it up at a picnic.  Thanks!

It was delicious and a great snack to make for a party or just for yourself. I think there was a little too much graham cracker crumbs, though. I sprinkled less on the top the second time I made them.

Yummy. I made these with my five year old daughter and nine year old nephew. Needless to say they loved them. I didn't care too much for them at first but after sitting in the fridge for a couple days I tried them again and they were delish.
