I would give this  4 1/2 stars. It was good. LIke the reviews said, good way to hide spinach. I would call it Mexican Lasagna. It was good.

My husband was gushing with compliments when I made this for dinner last night. I made a few slight alterations, I used a 13 oz box of Rotini, added half an onion while my meat was browning, and used salsa instead of tomato paste (I forgot that ingredient when I went shopping). Overall, it was delicious. I baked two 8x8 pans and put one in the freezer for a quick fix meal. I've already given this recipe to a handful of people I loved it so much.

I really like this recipe and have made it several times; it's pretty much a Mexican ziti. I think that a full package of cream cheese is too much, it ends up taking over the dish. Perhaps that the amount of 'kick' other reviewers are complaining is lacking is due to the variety of picante sauces out there. If you uses a good salsa, this recipe turns out great.

Pretty darn good!  Family didn't like it as much but I thought it was great!  I think it was the spinach they didn't like much plus I used whole wheat penne.  ;)  I did add red, yellow and orange pepper to the meat mixture since I had them on hand.  YUM!

Followed recipe and it was a little bland for a "Southwest" dish.  Next time I think I will replace the spinach with green chili to give it more flavor.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! It even satisfied my finicky little brother. Of course I did add a few touches of my own. First of all, I didn't add the tomato sauce, or the entire can of tomato paste, I was afraid the pasta would turn out too sour. Also, I added some fresh basil leaves teh teh cream cheese and spinach mixture. Baking the olives turned out delicious as well. This is really a great recipe for an easy family dinner.

This was pretty tasty!  I'm not much of a recipe girl, so of course I fudged the ingredients a little.  I used tomato paste, diced tomatoes and less salsa than called for because that's all I had.  I also used fresh spinach and replaced a little cream cheese with some plain yogurt to cut a few calories.

Made as written, this is really blah. I ended up adding way more seasoning to the meat mixture - more garlic, cumin, some onion powder, and a heaped tbsp of Chipotle Pepper powder. This turned out ok, but nothing spectacular. Thanks anyway. Oh, and Merry Christmas everyone!

This recipe is very good as a base. I added lots of other ingredients. I omitted the tomato sauce and added extra picante. I added a can of chili beans with the liquid. I used macaroni noodles since thats all I had. In the ground beef I added onion and lots of minced garlic (i dont measure but about a Tbsp) and lots of black pepper. In the white sauce I used fresh basil, oregono and flat leaf parsley and about a tsp of garlic. It gave it an unexpected italian twist that I loved. My 7,6 and 4 year old all loved it. Like I said before you can do a lot to this recipe to make it your own.

My boys usually pick out all of the green things in our food, but I tried this and they loved it. My first grader wants to "marry it." I think the picante flavors cover the bitterness of the spinach.

I thought this was alright.  My 10 year old wasn't too impressed, but he doesn't like mexican food much.  I would have to say that the prep time for me was closer to30 minutes.

This was excellent with lots of flavor!!  It would be a great dish to serve families with children at a gathering.  I used salsa instead of picante sauce and added cilantro and fresh squeezed lime for serving. What a great way to eat spinach without tasting it!

This was pretty good, but I thought it lacked a little something (maybe the brand of picante I used).  I divided the casserole into two smaller pans, baked both, then froze one for another day.  Omitted the olives, but otherwise followed pretty much to the letter.  Thank you for sharing.

I can't put my finger on it, but we just really didn't care for this.  We like everything that goes into it but the finished product didn't impress.  Was very filling though.

WOW!  This was a great meal.  My whole family loved it.  I didn't have tomato paste, so I put a little more sauce in.  And no frozen spinach, but substituted with fresh and was great!  I definitely recommend trying this one!

Great recipe! The whole family liked it, even my 1 year old. I can't do lactose, so I substituted soy milk for the milk and tofu cream cheese for the cream cheese, and then added mozarrella on top instead of cheddar. Turned out delicious!

My husband loved this recipe, and I liked it okay...the spinach & picante flavor combination was a little weird for me!  It was a good hearty meal for a cold night, and not a bad way to get veggies, meat, and grains all in one dish.

It's kind of like Mexican Lasagna.  I used rotini instead of penne (it's what I had) and a 16 oz bag of frozen chopped spinach instead of 10 oz (again, its what I had) and the proportions turned out kind of weird.  There was a too much of the cream cheese filling and not enough of the pasta layer.  But it was good, I took it to a pot luck and it all got eaten.

Also, I added an onion to the ground beef while I was browning it.  I also added the spices to the meat while browning, to really bring out their flavor (esp. the cumin, I used whole seeds instead of ground).  I threw in some crushed red peppers for good measure and that gave it a nice kick.

This was so tasty!  I wasn't so sure when putting it all together.  I don't believe I've ever combined oregano, cumin, and chili powder in the same dish.  I love spinach, but wasn't sure how it would be in mexican dish, but this was really great.  I actually split it into two smaller pans, and have frozen one for later.  The smaller pan made plenty tonight for my toddler and myself (hubby missed dinner due to work), and lots of leftovers for later.  And, my 17 mo. old at all of it!  He loves zesty stuff.  I will keep an eye on it next time, as I think I did let it go a little too long (did the 30 min. as suggested).  That could be due to my crazy oven that is really about 25 degrees hotter than it should be!  :)  Great recipe, thanks so much for sharing!

This was a delicious and easy to make meal. I read other reviews and wondered if it would be bland, but I thought it was perfect. The only thing I did different was I used a 16 oz can of tomato sauce, and I used fresh spinach that I dampened, covered, and microwaved for about 45 seconds. Thanks for the recipe!

It wasn't all ingredients I had sitting in my cupboard, but it was worth going to the store.  I went all-out healthy - fat free kraft cheese, 93% lean ground beef, and whole wheat penne.  I used medium picante sauce, would use spicy next time.  Over all, a delicious, healthy, and unique-looking caserole.

This is a family favorite for us, the only thing I've changed is adding extra cheese on top and occasionally, I will use the hot picante for added spice (it is plenty spicy alone as I use the medium picante).  But sometimes the kids and hubby ask for extra spicy!

YUM!  I only made a few changes:  whole wheat pasta, salsa instead of picante (couldn't find it) and omitted the olives (not a fan) and it was excellent!! I love spinach but you can hardly taste it so it would probably be great for picky kids!

Not only tastes great, but is a super way to disguise spinach in a meal.
