I admit, at first I was alittle put off by the pumpkin, but I figured I'd try it.  I'm glad I did.  First, I did not have pumpkin soup, so I used canned pumpkin.  Second you shouldn't cook the noodles, that is why the other reviewer's was liquidy and you have to let it sit for the 10-15 minutes after cooking.  The pumpkin flavor was almost undetectable.  It's a great way to get some veggies in your kids and husband for that matter!

MY FAMILY REALLY ENJOYED THIS VERY EASY TO MAKE RECIPE. I HAD TO USE REAL PUMPKIN AS I COULD NOT OBTAIN A TIN OF PUMPKIN SOUP BUT I DO NOT THINK IT AFFECTED THE OUTCOME.

I swapped out the red sauce for a jar of alfredo and threw in some extra seasonings, seasoning salt, garlic & onion powder....it was wonderful. Oh and I to just used a can of pure pumpkin in place of the soup. I have already shared this recipe with others they loved it too!

I used real mashed pumpkin, then added water an milk to thin it out. My daughter who NEVER eats pumpkin didn't even notice the pumpkin and ate it all up! A great variation on the traditional lasagne, though it is not really any quicker to make.

This was completely delicious. To be fair, I made some changes - I used alfredo instead of red sauce, and I added zucchini and diced tomatoes between the layers. The flavors melded nicely, and it was warm and satisfying, a good mix of savory flavors plus enough veggies to feel good about it being a one-dish meal. Yummy!

I was frightened by the thought of pumpkin in my lasagna, but I had some left over pumpkin puree, as well as some lasagna noodles, so i figured--why not?!  I had complete success using caned pumpkin instead of the cream of pumpkin soup (subbed it evenly).  I also made a quick spaghetti sauce out of some tomato sauce and a few seasonings with help of this website.  I only had a mixed cheese blend on hand, and it worked wonderfully.  I left it covered for the first 30 min, then uncovered and let brown for the last 5.  This is a great way to sneak in some veggies on your kids.  It's not overly pumpkin-y, just enough to know that it's there.  My toddler ate this up, so it'll be on hand for future use!

My roommate didn't really like this, but he isn't a big pumpkin fan. Unlike other reviewers, I thought this did have a considerable pumpkin taste. I liked it a lot though; it was a unique take on a classic dish.

This was very easy to make and also quite tasty!  I cooked my lasagna noodles instead of adding them uncooked like the recipe suggested.  (Making them al dente is good - they won't be too hard or too chewy after baking.)  The one downfall of the lasagna is that it is rather liquidy when hot.  Also, the pumpkin flavor could have been more apparent.  (Most pumpkin soups are made with carrots too, which alters the 'true' flavor you are expecting.)  Try it once, atleast.  :)

Got rave reviews at our Halloween party. Wouldn't replace for ALL lasagna occasions, but definitely a great variation, especially for a cold fall night with a fresh mache salad with walnut and lemon viniagrette-- and a nice Pouilly Fume.

This was very yummy, I love pumpkin. Here in NZ cream of pumpkin soup is readily available (I don't know why it would only be in specialty supermarkets) and I was looking for some ideas to incorporate all of the cans I had of condensed pumpkin soup. Thanks for the recipe!

I really, really wanted to like this dish. But if you follow the directions you are going to be dissapointed, as I was. Honestly I really can only see kids enjoying this "lasagna" because it is so bland in taste. 1 can of pumpkin and 1 jar of sauce is not enough; came out very dry. If your going to attempt this dish I'd reccomend you only put a little cheese on top, and sprinkle the rest throughout, because otherwise, you end up with a layer of badly burnt cheese on top. I cooked mine for 25 minutes and the top layer was so burnt it couldn't be eaten. I added a LOT of spices to the chicken and sauce, but it still turned out very bland. Perhaps trading in the speghetti sauce for alfredo, adding some veggies, throwing in some ricotta chesse, and re-distributing the mozzarella cheese would make this recipie taste better, but after all those changes it's really not the same recipie anymore! I did end up eating this because I was starving by the time it was done..

This was really good. I had to use butternut squash soup but it turned out wonderful. Next time, I would not use the water and the soup as it was a bit runny. Definitely helps to let it set.

I omitted the chicken & instead made a mash of steamed pumpkin, sweet potato (kumara in New Zealand). Then mixed in some steamed broccoli.
Truly a pumpkin lasagna, yummy!

Very good!  Made with homemade pumpkin-puree (which is lighter in texture and taste than canned IMHO), and that way, I couldn't taste the pumpkin at all, neither could my husband (will likely work pumpkin into our tomato sauces often now! woohoo!).  Will probably try this recipe with canned pumpkin puree when we don't have pumpkins on hand, as we do not have access to canned pumpkin soup.  If there is a pumpkin flavor then, since my husband doesn't care for pumpkin, we'll cut back on the canned pumpkin a bit.  I'll try to remember to post here if that is the case.  //  Didn't have lasagna noodles in the pantry, but had extra manicotti on hand, so broke up the dry manicotti and layered the broken *dry* pieces in instead of the lasagna noodles.  Otherwise, made as written.  Will include spinach next time, but didn't have any on hand the first time we made this recipe. The recipe is on target in that the chicken should be chopped prior to cooking, IMHO.  My son cooked the chicken for me and left out that step, and the texture of chicken cooked then chopped is quite different, IMHO - FYI.  Anyway - Thanks for the great idea, Sarah - we'll be inspired by your pumpkin in red sauce often!  (now to ponder whether or not to try it in alfredo sauce as some reviewers did....... think, think, think....)

This is pretty good in my opinion.  Hubs was a little less enthusiastic, but he can be a bit picky about combined flavors.  He liked it better after topping with Parmesan cheese and garlic powder.  I have to agree with the one reviewer who felt this did have a pumpkin flavor, but I actually like it that way.  I didn't have lasagne noodles and didn't feel like making them, so we used egg noodles instead.  I also doubled this recipe, I guess, because I made enough for a 9x13 pan.  I used a pumpkin pasta sauce that we'd tried a few days earlier and was a bit bland for us on pasta.  I liked it in this.  I did add garlic, onion, and Italian seasoning to this.  If I'd had veggies to add I would've put those in as well, but all I have right now is lettuce.  I had to sub cheddar for mozzarella.  A creative combination and I'm planning on freezing most of the leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

Like many others I questioned how good this would be. Curiosity got the better of me & I'm glad it did. This is probably the best lasagna I've made to date. I did make my own bolognese sauce however & added chopped mushrooms & wine for additional flavor.

I made this for my 1-year old twins and they loved it (along with my husband and I). I used canned pumpkin instead of pumpkin soup and added a bunch of cinnamon, all spice, ground cloves, etc. mixed with 1 1/3 cup whole milk to make 2 cups of liquid. I also sprinkled uncooked bowtie pasta on top because I only made two layers and my husband likes 'crunch.' I sprinkled Asiago/Parmesan cheese on top and supper was quick, easy, and delicious!

I followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  The flavors blended wonderfully.  Definitely one of my favorites.  I made my own red sauce (used lots of fresh basil) and my own pumpkin cream soup.  Totally worth the effort.
