This sauce was pretty good. I will make this again but with some changes. More red wine, and less worchestershire sauce. I added extra garlic, and used olive oil instead of butter.

Good stuff. I cut back a little on the worcestershire and added a little more red wine, mixed everything but the rosemary togethert, hen soaked the peppercorns in the liquid for a couple of hours.  Deglazed the pan I'd used to sear my steaks with the mixture, then added the rosemary after it reduced. Thanks!

Flavor was good, if you could get around the 2-tablespoons of peppercorn.  I would try this recipe again, but would drastically reduce the amount of peppercorn or possibly use 1 tsp of plain black pepper.

Awesome! and gave me an idea for a spin on my own recipe, i added a bit more garlic and merlot and used soaked green peppercorns and lots of them instead of black, much softer and not as strong so i added a liitle bit of cracked black pepper. Removed my fillets from the pan and threw it together with the steak juices, 10 mins all done!

I will be fixing this again!  Do get fresh, good quality peppercorns!  Mine were cheap and old and didn't taste great compared to the ones in a friends's dish.  I would strained them out to leave the flavor but not the corn itself.  Oh, and don't put peppercorns in the garbage disposal - almost had to call a repair man!

Not good. This is not a sauce. This is a reduction of primeval elements. 1 garlic clove vs. 3 tbs of worcestershire sauce and a half pound of pepper???????

This was pretty good.  I used the recipe exactly as written and we thought it was missing something.  It needed heat and we thought the sauce could be thicker as well. I doubled the recipe and once cooked I removed the peppercorns as they were hard and a distraction.  In another pan I made a butter/flour roux then added back the liquid from the recipe.  To that we added about 1/3 cup Sriracha Sauce for some heat.  It only took a minute to thicken up and I added the mushrooms back in.  The sauce was savory, tangy with a little punch of heat and it held onto the mushrooms and steak perfectly.  I also used two 8oz containers of mushrooms.  The recipe is a good base and I will use it again with my changes as we all really enjoyed it.  Going to add shallots next time.....

did not care for this recipe at all. I should have realized it wouldn't meet my preferred creamy sauce taste.  Don't care for the wine reduction flavour.  Would probably be very good if that's your taste liking.  sorry...probably won't make this again

After reading some of the other reviews, I reduced the peppercorn to 1 tbsp, and reduced the Worcestershire sauce to 1 tbsp. and increased the wine to 1/2 cup (I used Cab since it was all I had).  I sauteed the mushrooms, garlic and Gardein Beefless Tips over high heat until "beef" was seared then added the liquid and reduced the liquid by half. Amazing flavor and super easy to prepare!

Reminded me of peppercorn steak I had in Germany at a castle while I was there waiting to come home after being sent there from Afghanistan. It was the first real thing I had been able to eat and keep down so this is very special to me. I too added cream to it because the sauce I had also had cream but everything else was the same. Thank you for bringing back excellent memories!!

I agree that the whole peppercorns were a bit much, but maybe soaking them would help.  Next time I plan to use cracked pepper.  Delicious, though!  Compliments all around the table.

I followed most of the suggestions- cut worcestershire in half, added a bit more wine- but still could have cut down on the vinegar.  Overall good recipe but needs some fine tuning for me.

The flavor of the sauce was excellent but the peppercorns were a bit much.  Added sliced portabellos instead and was incredible.

Recipe is way to acidic. Benefits from cutting back on the Worcester sauce, cutting out the Balsamic altogether and adding some cream to balance the acidity.

My husband and I loved this sauce.  We did it without mushrooms cause he doesn't like them, and it still was delicious.  I did increase to 1 cup of wine and only 1 tablespoon of worcestershire - that was just personal taste.  Great base recipe that you can do a lot to.

Just fantastic.  As others have mentioned, this is not really a sauce, but rather a reduction.  I've prepared this recipe five or six times but have reduced the amount of peppercorns to one tablespoon and actually have ground them up into a coarse texture.  I dice the rosemary as well.  After grilling the New York strips (medium rare) I slice the steaks into 1/4 inch strips then apply the 'sauce'.  This is my 'go to' recipe if I want to impress company.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought there were way too many peppercorns for the amount of sauce it made.  It had a good flavor but I prefer a thicker sauce and this wasnt it.  Wont make again.

Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and halved the amount of peppercorn and doubled the amount of merlot. I thought it was good. Not great, but worth trying again.

This sauce way to acidic for us. The first batch I made as written, then I added more wine, mushrooms and garlic. I added a tsp of sugar to even out the acids and finished with some butter.

Quite good and relatively easy.  I used 2 and a halfway tablespoons of peppercorns and only 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and increased the wine from 1/4 to 1/2

Excellent.  Yes, I used less vinegar/Worcestershire more cooking wine and a bit of cornstarch to thicken!

Sauce was very good. Loved the Rosemary and balsamic vinegar combination along with the wine.

Great sauce!  I reduced the amount of Worcestershire sauce to 1 tbsp, used 3 tbsp of salted butter, and next time will use ground peppercorns.  I was looking for a rich and bold merlot sauce and this was the (almost) perfect recipe!

Way too much pepper, not enough wine.  Idea was good and I will adapt it properly next time.

This sauce came out great for my skirt steaks but i added some more ingredients . I added heavy cream and although it came a bit watery i kept adding puffs of flour and mixing right away after each time i drop flour so it dont sticky to each other and form a dough like ball. It came more creamy and not as winey like this recipe . It had to much vinegar so the heavy cream helps out alot.

Needs more detailed directions as to when to turn over the steak, so it remains tender.

I tried this without advance planning, so had to go with ingredients I had on hand (canned mushrooms, cracked pepper, cabernet sauvignon instead of merlot) and it was still excellent! Thanks to other reviewers, I used only 1 Tbl of Worcestershire, and a little extra wine.  LOVED IT!
----------------
I have made this a lot since my first review - it's my husband's absolute favorite thing!  It is even better with fresh mushrooms, etc., but I still use cracked pepper by choice, because I prefer not to bite into whole peppercorns.  This recipe is very forgiving - almost any (not-too-sweet) red wine will work, and the measurements don't have to be precise.  You'd have to work hard to mess this up!

I used an 8 oz container of sliced mushrooms and 1/4 t. of dried rosemary instead of 1/2 t. of fresh rosemary.  The flavor of the mushrooms and sauce was great, but we picked around all the peppercorns.  Next time I'll probably just use 1 T. freshly ground black pepper and see how that goes.

We tried this and really liked it. I did change it up also. I used smoked garlic that I got at our farmers market and also after taking the steaks out of the pan I deglazed pan with the sauce. I wll try it with cream as suggested as that sound good too.

Sorry, followed this recipe exactly and I didn't care for it.
