I loved these and so did the family but I knew I would because I love crescent dough. My only plight is that I didn’t make enough. Lol. They’re so quick and easy. Definitely keeping this one.

Very easy, and extremely tasty. Eady to adjust and add-on. Do yourself a favor, and add this recipe to your collection.

I liked it, but it wasn't garlicky enough for me. I think it's a good recipe, though.

I diced 4 small basil leaves in place of the italian seasoning and mixed all together with the butter drizzling a tsp of the mixture on top of each round...yyuuuummm!

Super tasty - I made mine smaller since I thought I could keep halving the dough. Nice change to regular garlic toast.
