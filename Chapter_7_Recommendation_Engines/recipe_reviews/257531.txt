Quick and easy to make. Next time I think I'll add cream cheese to the cinnamon mixture and leave out the butter. So many possibilities.

These were awesome. Had a church Breakfast potluck.  First I used 1 8 oz brick of cream cheese. Split in half &  I used cinnamon with 2 Tbsp white sugar 4 oz cream cheese softened.  With the other 4 oz cream cheese I added 2 Tbsn white sugar & 1/3 cup strawberry jam.  Instead of nutmeg in with the egg mixture, I added 2 tsp vanilla extract & rolled out white decrusted (my own word!) bread - 2 store bought loaves worth.  Used 6 x-large eggs and had some leftover.  Made 42 rolls, which I cut in half to serve.  These were devoured!  Awesome recipe.
