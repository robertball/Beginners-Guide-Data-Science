I have made this recipe for several years. For extra flavor I use cream of chicken in the place of the mushroom soup. A little garlic salt and Italian seasoning make great improvements, also. I like this recipe mostly because it is quick and easy.

This was great!  Perfect for a base recipe. I added 2 chopped green onions and 3 cloves of pressed garlic to the soup after sauteing them, then added 2 tsp. or so of Italian herbs to the soup as well.  I let it simmer for about 15 minutes.  I used feta cheese instead of parmesan.  Thanks for the idea!

simple and tasted good. Not something for everyday consumption. I did add a bit of milk and sour cream to the soup just to thin it out a bit as well as a dash of pepper for color.

So good! My whole family, including my picky little boys, loved it. I used Cream of Mush with Roasted Garlic and added some Italian herbs, as suggested by others. I also did NOT add the pasta to the sauce, but rather served the sauce over the pasta. That way we have control over the sauce to pasta ratio and nothing is dry. Left over pasta may also be used for something else when we keep them separate.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good. I think with a little tweaking it could be much better though.

This was a fast and delicious recipe. Mine did not come out tasting like a can either! I used a whole box of farfalle pasta so it made alot. Next time I will add another cup of broccoli and a small can of mushrooms. Maybe I'll try the itlalian seasonings too like someone else suggested.

My husband liked it.  I thought it was edible, but didn't have much flavor and was really sticky.  I was difficult to get everything to mix together.  Both of my kids ate it, but neither made mention of it, which means that it was just okay.

I always try to start with the original recipe, unless it screams "change me!" or many other reviews make big changes. This is a very easy, basic and tasty recipe. It's also easy to tweak to your own desires and needs. I used leftover cooked elbows and steamed up some frozen broccoli, and the turkey was left over as well. Cleaned out the fridge and made a nice supper! I'll make this again.

Rather blah, even though I added 3 scallions.  I used regular Campbell's Mushroom soup and whole milk.

Good with leftover turkey. Could easily be kicked up  a notch by adding ingredients.

Good filling meal all by itself. Made it as is. In the future I will put in 2 cups of broccoli instead of one to give it a little more veggies.

This is a great basic recipe which can easily modified according to taste.  I like that it is quick and easy and the ingredients should already be in your pantry.

Turned out very dry and sticky.  No longer a fan of using cream of mushroom soup in an alfredo dish.
