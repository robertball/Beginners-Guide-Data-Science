AWESOME recipe! I added a 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper, because I was worried it wouldn't be hot enough... and it was the PERFECT amount of heat! I didn't put chicken in mine, but that's just from laziness and not wanting to cook it, and I recommend (if using pre-cooked sausage/shrimp) to use some olive oil when sautéing veggies, and I cooked it for 10 minutes with the tomatoes and everything thrown in, then added the already cooked shrimp and sausage in and let it simmer for just a few minutes. Outside of using precooked meat and adding some crushed red pepper, I followed everything and it was so good! Thank you very much for the recipe.

Made as written and my only complaint was that this was just a tad too spicy and salty. I think the Tony's should be cut back to one tablespoon and that would solve both issues. Other than that, this was perfect. Cooking the rice in broth makes all the difference in the world when it comes to flavor. Thanks for sharing Mandybelcanto!

6-21-2019 ~What a winner of a dish!  I don’t care for highly spicy foods, nor do Hubs’ sensitive innards, so I had to work with this a bit to limit the heat factor.  In addition to reducing the amount of Creole seasoning by half, I omitted the ground pepper and hot sauce altogether.  I liked the idea of dicing the sausage, as it spread its own heat more evenly!  The level of spice was perfect for me, but for Hubs it still was a little too much because of the andouille.  So, since andouille seems like kielbasa with a bit of red pepper flakes, those with spicy heat issues like his might want to just use kielbasa instead.  Scaling this to three servings made it impractical to use only portions of cans of both tomato sauce and diced tomatoes, so I simply used an entire can of petite diced tomatoes.  I cooked the chicken in strips (not shredded) with the sausage and didn’t add the shrimp until the last few minutes of cooking.  The finished dish, with the heat level adjustments, was simple perfection.  It has an appealing flavor with its trio of meats and Creole spice.  Creole comfort food!  Hubs, who generally won’t take anything to work for his lunch that he has to eat with a fork, happily took the leftovers  today.  Darn it.

The ingredients call for only 2 cups of broth yet the directions have us add 4 cups.  
Also,  15 minutes to cook shrimp will make them chewy.  I cooked them for only 7 minutes and they came out great.  Other than this,  great recipe.

Very good and easy to make.  Was really pleased with the way it turned out.  I did use a little red pepper and some smack your mama seasoning to kick up the heat just a little.

I chunked the chicken. Not crazy about shredded chicken. Did not add salt or pepper. Used less hot sauce than recipe called for. We loved how it turned out. Will definitely keep this in our favorites!

I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts because the meat is more tender. And I use red and green bell peppers. About two of them and I left out the green onion. Its absolutely awesome.

Made as written except I cubed up chicken tenders and cooked them in the pot after I browned the sausage. I added the green onions and shrimp the last 2-3 mins. of cooking.  Shrimp only need several mins. to cook. To me, it was spicy and salt. Next time I will decrease the cajun seasoning to 1 T and use reduced salt or no salt tomatoes, then add salt as needed. I might also use rice not cooked in chicken broth. Very good and easy.

I loved the ingredients, I changed the times on the cooking.  I cooked everything except the shrimp almost an hour at a simmer.  I should have gone with fine diced tomatoes.  I liked the sauce it developed though.  I peeled, deveined and halved the  shrimp and only cooked them for 5 minutes at simmer.  Delicious!  Ps. don't use brown rice.  It added too much nuttiness.  It is what I had.

I made it exactly as printed (except I chopped the chix instead of shredding) and it turned out great.  Served it to a party of 6 adults and there was plenty with leftovers to boot.  I added a little more hot sauce (Louisiana) to mine, but for a gulf coast crowd the seasoning is about right.  Will def make it again.

A new family favorite. Kielbasa instead of andouille helps to keep the spice down.

I made this exactly to the recipe and it is definitely spicy. It was ok for me but the family thought it was too hot. I'd recommend starting with 1/2 Tbsp of creole seasoning and add to taste. After making this on the stove I transferred it to a slow cooker on low for 4 hours. I'll definitely make this again. Very easy!
