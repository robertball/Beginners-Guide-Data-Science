Using honey is a great idea for sweet potatoes and we liked that. The only problem was the cardimon and ginger were a little overwhelming. The kids did not like it. In the future we would omit the cardimon and go easier on the ginger.

I think the key to this recipe is knowing your own tastes. (After reading the reviews) I used maybe 1 T. ginger and 1/2 t cardamom. It was very tasty but I expected there to be a bit more caramelization. Everyone liked it and it was not sickly sweet like marshmallow versions of this recipe.

This recipe got my attention last Thanksgiving, and will be definitely be served again this year.  Even my parents, who generally avoid any unusual dish, raved about these sweet potatoes.  I would advise anyone thinking of making this dish to gauge their own tolerance for ginger and cardamom and adjust the recipe amounts to taste - this recipe allows for quite a bit of personalization. I also agree with other reviewers: nutmeg is essential, as is fresh grated (not ground) ginger.

Exactly what I wanted! Not too sweet like the marshmallow ones and not mashed. It was all gone.  I actually sliced and baked in a casserole dish.

I used nutmeg instead of cardamom, still tasted great!  I added lots of honey as well, for sweetness.  Great recipe!

I had to modify the receipe for 15 people.  My cast iron frying pan was not large enough, I used a large roasting pan which worked as well.  They weren't crunchy, but the kids definately loved them.  They asked for them for Christmas. :)

This is a great holiday dish. Not to sweet either.
I would recommend parboiling the potato's and cutting back on the ginger in half and cardomom too. It can be a bit overwhelming. Overall it is an excellent combination of flavors and a nice change from the usual brown sugar and marshmallow ingredients

This recipe calls for WAY too many sweet potatoes. I used 6 and still found it to be a lot.
The potatoes should be boiled first to remove the skins and help with the cooking time.
I did this and THEN baked for the allotted time and they were JUST cooked.

Tasty dish though. The honey makes the dish.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a HUGE hit! I cut rounds and baked it in a casserole dish, which required cooking it about 15 min longer than stated for the sweet potatoes to be really tender the the juices to caramelize. I cut back the ginger and the cardamom by 1/3 because of other reviews, but when I make it again, and I will, I'll put the full amount in. A wonderful recipe and a great way to get away from that awful pile of goo that we were all raised on. Thanks Christine!

With sugar conscious people at the table I reduced the honey to about 3 Tbsp.  The result was a much more savory dish.  Agree about fresh ginger- makes a huge difference.  We did not find the cardamom to be too strong.  With no walnut oil on hand (is it just me?) I used veggie oil and a little water.  Also used a baking dash to bake it, and covered for the second 20 min.  It really steamed and softened the potatoes.  Great recipe! Will make this over and over!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Love cardamon and it goes so well with Sweet potatoes.  Took exactly 40 minutes in the oven - I cut the recipe back to 1 sweet potato for two of us.

This was delicious!  I did not have walnut oil (actually have never heard of it) so I used olive oil.  Added chopped walnuts and they were a fabulous addition.  Will definitely make again!

These are not bad.  I got mine to caramelize, but I had to leave them in the oven a lot longer than stated in order to do that.  I also only used 4 sweet potatoes--it's just the two of us, so 9 is a bit of overkill.  Very good, though, nice flavor.  I agree wtih others--use the amounts you think you can handle of the spices adn you'll be fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

How Yummy! One of the times I made this dish, I realized I ran out of cardamom, so I used coriander, which worked just as well. Sprinkle with some chopped roasted almonds for an added texture.

I made these for thanksgiving this year, and while they were ok, the ginger really overpowered the delicate flavor of the sweet potatoes and cardamon.  I will try them again, but will cut the ginger  at least in half, and maybe up the cardamon a little.  Something to start with, and much healthier than the standard candied sweet potatoes.

this was delicious even after I substituted the fresh ginger with the bottled. I didn't have any walnut oil, so I used regular oil but sauteed some walnuts in the oil until they were brown. I then added the honey and the powdered spices (plus the pepper) and poured that all over the cut up sweet potatoes. The time in the oven as stated by the recipe was perfect. LOVED IT.

Wow.  I finally got up the courage to bring a dish to my in-laws Easter dinner, and this was the best choice I could have made.  It was such a surprising recipe: sweet, tangy, aromatic.  At my husband's request, I cut back on the cardamom, but I think I would have been happy with the full amount.  I didn't have walnut oil, but canola ended up working just fine.  After baking, I mashed up the potatoes and transfered to a nice casserol dish.  As a final touch, I spooned a generous amount of the left-over honey mixture (from the bottom of the baking pan) over the potatoes.  It looked, smelled, and tasted divine. This is now a family favorite!

These turned out quite good.  They didn't caramelize until after the second 20 minute baking time, but were really good anyway.  I think I overdid the ginger a little, but still tasted good and different.  Didn't have any added fat, so were a low-fat food.  I think I'd make them again, as we love sweet potatoes, and this is a nice change from the usual ways of cooking them.

Substitute ground coriander for the cardamom if you like a more subtle flavor. A shot of lemon juice right before serving is awesome!

I couldn't get this to caramelize.  Could've been my technique, as I'm a genuine novice to cooking from scratch.  However, I may adapt the recipe and instead mash the potatoes, baking it as a casserole, perhaps with some brown sugar and crushed pecans on top.  I do so love the cardamom, though.

Ooooooooooohhhhh! If it has cardamom in it, chances are I'll be a fan, but these were fantastic! Definitely not your typical marshmallowy-cinnamony sweet potatoes, but not so over-the-top exotic that they can't be served at Thanksgiving or Christmas. They have a little bit of a kick, and while my dad and I can't get enough ginger, I usually cut it in half for the people in my family with more conservative palates. I make these for every big holiday get-together, and they're always a hit. It does take longer than 40 minutes to cook, though. Sometimes—if I can find them—I'll toss in some Okinawan sweet potatoes along with the regular ones (they're deep purple and have a mild chestnut flavor).

Ooooooooooohhhhh! If it has cardamom in it, chances are I'll be a fan, but these were fantastic! Definitely not your typical marshmallowy-cinnamony sweet potatoes, but not so over-the-top exotic that they can't be served at Thanksgiving or Christmas. They have a little bit of a kick, and while my dad and I can't get enough ginger, I usually cut it in half for the people in my family with more conservative palates. I make these for every big holiday get-together, and they're always a hit. It does take longer than 40 minutes to cook, though. Sometimes—if I can find them—I'll toss in some Okinawan sweet potatoes along with the regular ones (they're deep purple and have a mild chestnut flavor).

I really loved the flavours of these sweet potatoes...for one thing they were not overly sweet!  Not sure why but they did not carmelize for me?!  I did parboil 1st to cut down on cooking time in the oven.  While my turkey rested on the counter these cooked in the oven!  I will make them again and see if I can get them to carmelize!!

Would like them to come out on the crunchy side. They were mushy, but still tasty.

Don't need so much ginger root. Did not get crispy in oven, just mushy, but still very tasty.

These were good, but a little too sweet for me. The spices and honey masked the sweetness of sweet potatoes. Also, they stuck to the pan. I'd put foil down if I made them again.

The Ginger gave it a super good flavor.  I didn't have cardamom, but it was good even without it.  I added some brown sugar during the last 15 minutes of baking, and it tastes almost like baked apples only not so tart.
