This is a wonderful banana bread.  I did not have any flax seed meal, so made my own by putting flax seeds in the food processor.  Also added 2 teaspoons of banana extract. BUT there must be an error in the bake time, wondering whether this is a publishing error as after 25 minutes like the recipe states my cake was still total goo!  Had to cook for a total for 65 minutes.

Great recipe and super easy.  I baked mine in my bread machine using the quick breads setting and it came out beautifully.  This is now my official "go to" banana bread recipe.

I used only homemade self-rising flour and swapped out the walnuts for almonds. Came out lovely and sweet, with a nice caramelized crisp top. 
Second time around I wanted to make a bigger loaf so I used 3 small-medium bananas, 1 3/4 cup of self-rising flour (no flax meal), about 180 grams of butter, and a tsp of vanilla extract, added fresh blueberries and almonds, and I got a big 5x11 pan size loaf :)

I doubled the recipe and only added nuts to one of the loaves.  Creaming the butter and sugar to a very light consistency really makes a difference.  The added ground flax had this bread very rich and delicious.

I live in a small town and flaxseed meal is not available. It's great without it. I did change something. I doubled the recipe (without the flaxseed meal) and added another egg. Came out much fluffier and tastes great.

Turned out great! Didnâ€™t any meal so just increased the flour and added 1/2 cup pecans. I am making these for the family in cute little cardboard loaf pans four at a time for 45 minutes. Perfect!

Wow, so moist and soft banana nuts bread ever; absolutely delicious! My husband has diabetes, so we often use flax seeds for oatmeal in the morning. 
I missed "meal" part, so I added 1/4 cup of flax seeds, but it turned out so good.  I made a few changes only for diabetes friendly: substituted a cup of self-rise flour with half cup each of flour and almond powder, added only half cup + 1/8 cup of sugar. Baked in loaf pan for 50-55 minutes in my oven.
Thank you so much for your recipe!

I made a couple changes.  no flax (didn't have), doubled the recipe, used high altitude all purpose flour, (in Colorado), added 3 tsp. baking powder to the flour, 1 tsp. Ceylon cinnamon (nuts.com), and 1 tablespoon lavender (rubbed it between fingers first to release aroma) (   https://www.starwest-botanicals.com/category/lavender-flowers/
1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 coconut unsweetened  the house smells wonderful!

I don't know what I did, but this recipe came out awful.  I made muffins and they were flat (didn't rise at all), way too dense and chewy. They were almost wet looking when I took them out of the oven.  I did use flax seed instead of flax meal, as I didn't have meal, so that may have been it.  it seemed to me that the recipe needs to have baking powder to make them rise.  I think I will stick with my tried and true banana bread recipe.

Nothing to write home about as it is not unusual.  Two things, first, mix any dried fruits or nuts in a small amount of flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the bread, before mixing into the batter.  Second, people think that yellow bananas are ripe.  Sorry but they are not.  Wait until the skin becomes heavily speckled with brown spots and the banana is then nearly ripe.  A fully ripe fruit is when the entire skin is brown which means it contains lots of sugar and flavour.

To British Baker.  If you read the METHOD correctly, it gives the time of 1 hour for the Banana Bread  and 25 minutes if it is made into Muffins.
