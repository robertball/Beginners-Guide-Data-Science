I liked the concept of this recipe, however, I needed more flavor.  I added 1/4 cup of chopped red bell pepper for color to the onions and 4 cloves of garlic.  I mixed twice as much lemon zest with twice as much lemon juice and 1/2cup fat free chicken broth along with a T of french mustard.  I added the wine and broth to this mixture. I mixed 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch in the mixture at the end.  I added the pasta after that.   It was very good.

This was a big hit.  I did use previous recommendations to double the lemon juice and zest which it definitely needed.  I also did not use the onion but doubled the garlic.  I also used marinated artichokes, drained, instead of frozen, which also added to the flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  I think that next time I cook it I will add some cornstarch and make the sauce a bit thicker.  Also, I used the amount of linguine suggested, and it was way too much.
My famiily says it is a keeper.

I would like to point out that the recipe calls for 8 ounces of linguine, which IS half a normal sized package.  User error seems to be a real problem among many of these reviews.

Since so many people had an issue with the noodles, I made this with orzo pasta instead. When it was finished, I added some toasted pine nuts that really added a great bit of flavor. A little FETA cheese on top and this is now one of my favorite dishes.

Very sophicated dish, but my 4 year old loved it! A little bland, next time I think I'm going to add marinated artichoke hearts and capers.

This was just ok.  The regular recipe is bland and it took a lot of experimenting with seasonings to keep it from being a total loss.  The suggestions of red pepper flakes and pine nuts are probably helpful for this dish.

I followed the recipe as per and found the flavour was slight at best.  The second run included a much higher quality dry White wine, as well as fresh dill. I added approx half again the Lemon Juice, and voilà, success.  Also thickened the sauce so as it could be lighty poured over the food after plating.

Add a little more wine, lemon, and garlic and you have a great sauce for the pasta!

I doubled the lemon as recommended and added red pepper flakes, pine nuts, and 2T of butter - it was a definite winnner. I will make it again.

Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly and was happy with the outcome.  I may add a little extra garlic next time and maybe a dash of hot sauce. Thanks for an awesome was to use artichokes!

Quick and easy...a family-pleaser!  The flavors are light and nicely balanced.  I also added a bunch of spinach with the artichoke for a little more nutrition.  Eat this delicate meal...and treat yourself to dessert!

This was a really good recipe that needs a little tweaking. It was slightly bland so I recommend crushed red pepper flakes and more vegetables (green peppers, mushrooms, etc.) Overall I liked this recipe and will make it again!

A very good base sauce that can take lots of variations. I added more garlic like the other reviewers did and used marinated artichoke hearts because that's what I had on hand. Then I got a little crazy and threw in some mushrooms and tomatoes too. Came out great!

I thought this recipe was light and delicious, something not so full of cream and fat.  However, I did make some modifications.  I salted and peppered the shrimp before I cooked it so it would have more flavor.  I added 4 cloves of crushed garlic. I also only used 8 oz of pasta.  The recipe calls for a "package," but it's an 8 oz package, so I guess that's where people get confused.  But 1/2 a package is definitely enough!

This recipe was nice and light tasting, but it would have been very bland without some modifications. I added scallops with the shrimp and took others' suggestions to add more lemon juice, garlic, and crushed red pepper.

I used Angel Hair pasta and tossed all together.  I also used a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce and it was really yummy.  The lemon juice and white wine make it light and tangy.  Very good flavors.  I might add a little butter for flavor, but the recipe really is good as is.  I will make it again.

I added about 4T of butter since some said it was too dry... It had a light subtle taste.  On our plates I added more salt, pepper and some cayenne for kick!  Thanks

I do love the fact that this recipe is easy and healthy.  I will make it again, but it does need some adjustments. I've made this dish twice, and the first time I doubled the wine and lemon and it was way too lemony.  The following time I followed to recipe exactly and it was a bit dry and needed a little more sauce.  Next time I'll try adding marinated artichokes (as recommended before) and using a higher quality white wine.  The fresh parsley on top is excellent and I do love that.

I liked the flavors in this one, a nice light summer dinner.  Served it with steamed zuchinni, yum!  I do think that the wine needed to be reduced to around a bit over 1/4 cup, add a bit of cornstarch during the final minute of simmer, and I took the advice on adding the dried crushed chilis; very zesty!  Hubby loved it!  Thanks for a good recipe!

This was terrible!  I followed the recipe exactly, but it was very sour from the lemon and had a yucky texture.  Such a waste of expensive shrimp.

This was a very bland dish, although very light.  It tasted like sauce-less noodles.  I added capers which gave it some flavor.

My boyfriend and I really disliked this dish.  We both really enjoy the flavors that can be savored in good food, but the flavors in this pasta dish were extremely bland.  I added quite of bit of seasoning, both red pepper flakes and Emeril's Southwest Seasoning to make it tolerable.  I do agree that there was not enough sauce to warrant the large amount of pasta.  The consistency of the sauce was also very poor.  In theory this recipe should produce tasty results, but something about the dish isn't quite right.

Like someone else said, great concept.  This recipe needed a lot of changes.  The cooking time on shrimp is WAY to long.  It needed red pepper flakes to kick it up.  Otherwise great idea

One package of noodles was definetly too much.  Only use a half a package of noodles, or put a lot more sauce in it.  Otherwise it was very good.  I would like to try it again, but with fewer noodles.

Great recipe, but I thought there was too much pasta!  I cut back on that but thought the flavor was awesome!  Thank you for sharing a wonderful seafood recipe!

I should have read the reviews before I made this.  I agree the flavor is bland if you make recipe as is which why I give 2 stars.  I think if would be good with a creamy garlic or alfredo sauce.

Definitely needs a boost somewhere. I added paprika, chili powder, and cumin along with chopped sweet peppers and scallions. Also put extra wine in had a tendency to be a bit dry. Otherwise a fun tasty recipe when you spice it up a little.

I made this and it was great. Of course I changed it. I added 1 pkg of frozen artichokes after I let them thaw. Cooked them with the shrimp and added 1 large tomato chopped up in the  sauce. It was fantastic

I made changes!  Started with a nice large Vidalia onion and five cloves of garlic.  I did not add the shrimp until the end.  Added one cup of chicken broth, zest and juice of one large lemon,  cup and one half of white wine, and artichoke hearts in marinade.  Red pepper flakes and black pepper.  Juice of marinaded artichoke hearts.  Then shrimp.  It was delicious.  Oh, and half the box of linguine.

This turned into shrimp and asparagus fettuccine with mushrooms. I sautéed the onion, sliced mushrooms, and chopped asparagus in olive oil, seasoned well, added 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic, cooked another few minutes before adding the shrimp, wine and juice of one fat lemon, cooked until shrimp was pink throughout, then added cornstarch to thichen. Served it over the warm fettuccine with fresh parmesan and chopped fresh parsley. It made my girlfriend smile!

Made this recipe this past weekend and it was awesome.  I did add some cornstarch to thicken it up some.  Would definitely make this again as instructed.

I'd make it again! When I reheated the leftovers I sauteed some additional minced garlic and red pepper flakes, I liked it better with a little heat.

I used a jar of marinated artichokes and added a little Penzey's Florida Pepper which has lemon peel, orange peel, garlic and onion for a bit more flavor & zip and Penzey's reconstituted lemon peel. I splashed in a bit more lemon juice than it called for and my husband really liked it. The wine I used was a Sauvignon Blanc. We both liked it very much!
