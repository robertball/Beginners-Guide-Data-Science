This was a hit!  It wasn't what I thought it would be because I don't think the corn was the major player in this soup, but it was delightful nonetheless!  I use a bit extra tomato paste and I put some beef boullion in with the water to give it some extra flavor.  I will make this again and again!  Yum!

I wasnt too impressed the first time I made this recipe so I changed it up the 2nd time. I added 1 small jalapeno pepper, with seeds removed, changed cayenne to Cajun seasoning and used chicken broth instead of water (no beef broth in the house). It made it a little spicer but it works.

Awesome soup.  My hubby said best I have made.  I wanted it a little soupier, so I added more tomato paste and more water.  I also added beef bouillon and some cumin per another recommendation. Also used frozen corn.

Soup for the soul! I added cumin, 1/4 t. more cayenne, and a few leftover potatoes and carrots to add to the meatiness. Soup lovers, enjoy!

I used tomato sauce (15 oz.) instead of tomato paste, although next time, I'm going to use homeade canned tomatoes. I also used ground turkey (we don't eat red meat in this house). I also simplified a step, I ground the meat, onion, and garlic together and omitted the oil and an extra step. I used red pepper flakes and cumin, next time I'm adding some chili powder too. And lastly, I added 1 can of mixed veggies when I added the meat mixture. Love it and will make again w/ some additional changes. Thanks for a good basis to start from.

This was absolutely delicious. I used half beef broth and half water, and also used just one full can (6 oz) of tomato paste. I added 1/2 tsp of paprika.

This was one good soup! Only thing I added some sausage with it and it added something extra in taste and smell. I'm sure I'll  be making this again.

I liked it, but not having a green and red bell pepper I used Hungarian and Anaheim peppers. I also replaced the water with whey because I had some to use up. Good stuff, though!

WOW WOW WOW!!! I am not a fan of tomato soup so when I read that ½ way through making this I kind of freaked out. I added 4 bouillon cubes to make my water beef stock and OMG this is soooooo good nothing like tomato soup. I am cooking up some pasta to add to this because after trying it I decided pasta would be a great add in. Oh and I didn’t have cayenne pepper so I used ground red pepper. Also my hubby doesn’t like bell peppers so I didn’t add them and it is still GREAT!!!

Great Meal! I put my own spin on it. I added a little more water in order to make more servings. I used 2 lbs of ground turkey, 6 cups of corn and two cans of low sodium black beans. I also added some diced tomatoes and brown sugar. I just wanted that sweet and spicy taste. I call it Cajun Style Bumble Bee Soup. So Good over some white rice and you can't forget some Jiffy Corn Bread!

This was actually pretty great... better than I expected it to be. Instead of 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, I did 1 tsp. of Frank's Red Hot sauce plus just a pinch of cayenne. Then I added 1/4 tsp. oregano, 1/4 tsp. paprika and 1 tsp. dried parsley. I also did beef broth instead of water (which meant I didn't need the extra salt). 4 stars for the recipe as printed, but with the changes I'd say 5. I'm sure I'll make this again, as it's one of the better soup recipes I have tried on here in a long time.

Love this recipe, great success with all my friends. I add two cubes of broth in the water, which makes it a bit richer. I also use slighty less garlic, but add som extra chili. Serve it with hot bread and butter.

Okay soup - needs more tomato flavour though - the only real flavour coming through was the cayenne pepper and garlic.  I think next time I'll add an extra can of tomato paste or make it with beef broth instead of water.

I accidentally made some changes, but I like the way it came out so well that I'll probably make it that way again!  Our peppers had gone bad, so instead of the peppers we just used a whole 11 oz can of corn (about 1 1/2 cups) and a little extra ground beef.  I accidentally used double the cayenne, which my husband (who is insane) thinks was perfect, but was just a little too much for me;  should maybe use 1 1/2 times the amount if you like hot food.  It came out very thick and stewlike, great for a cold winter night!  Also a great way to use up lots of leftover tomato paste, which I always seem to have.

This is a great recipe.  I used a bag of fresh whole kernal corn and 3 cans of cream style. Substituted 1 can tomatoe paste and ceyenne pepper with 2 cans of rotel. I did not double the paste as it tends to cause a thick tomatoe foam at the top of the soup.
Great recipe!

The soup was pretty good.  However, there wasn't much soup.  It was too thick for my family. If I make it again I will add more water or some tomato sauce to try to make it more soupy.

A spicy robust soup - my husband and I both loved it.   I added half again of the cayenne and it was REALLY spicy.  Thank you, Maurice, from

Big hit with the family. For those that found it too spicy they had it with rice and that cut the "spicyness". Most loved it just as it is!

We eliminated the beef and made it vegetarian.  Slightly less of the cayenne on the second batch  that we doubled.  Wonderful to divide up for my husband who has little time for his lunch with his busy medical practice.  Perfect for his busy life and healthy lifestyle.  Highly recommend using fresh corn from the cob.

This was pretty good, although I had to add some salt to it for flavor.

This was very good, I was making jambalaya and had some leftover chicken and sausage so I used that instead of the ground beef. It made for a fantastic louisiana meal. So easy I will make this again definitely.
