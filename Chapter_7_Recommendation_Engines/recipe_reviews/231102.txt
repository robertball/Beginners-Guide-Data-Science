I didn't care much for this. The sour cream and yogurt came off as tasting like mayonnaise, which I really didn't want, once the mustard was added. There was also way too much of the dressing texture wise. Only changes I made was making 1/2 recipe, using a different lettuce, and I used the lemon juice but left out the rind so it wasn't too tart. The lettuce, mayo taste, and potatoes was just too much confusion for my taste buds. I can see others liking this though.
