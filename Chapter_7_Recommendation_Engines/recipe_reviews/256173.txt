4.20.19  Didn’t want to do the flaming brandy step (I’m not fearless), so I added it early to the chicken livers while they were cooking, allowing enough time for the alcohol to cook off and just leave the brandy flavor.  I also did not add the melted butter at the end (mostly for presentation concerns) and just garnished with some chopped parsley.  I had some caramelized onion on hand, so I did garnish/top some of the pate crostini with it, which by the way, was a  delicious variation.  The addition of the apple is a good one, as I think it tempers what often can be a somewhat harsh liver flavor…it works!  Nice spreading consistency, mellow flavor, creamy, good recipe!  Having pate-loving friends over tomorrow for Easter dinner, so I think they’re in for a treat.  Thanks for sharing.
