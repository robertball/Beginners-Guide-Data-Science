Oh this was perfect! Very simple to put together and bakes in 30 min. I used 2cans of tuna in water, fresh/chopped tomatoes, and a four cheese Alfredo. You could spice this in several different ways. Will make again.

I mixed the sundried tomatoes & Italian seasoning in a magic bullet and added button mushrooms that had been saut√©ed with garlic, lemon & some white wine.

Easy, fairly cheap and absolutely delicious! Love this! Totally adding to my recipe book. I substituted plain bread crumbs with Contandinas Italian herb flavored crumbs as well as added a pinch of oregano, basil & parsley.

This recipe is awesome. I made  two modifications. I did use two cans of tuna. And instead of peas and sun dried tomatoes I used frozen broccoli. (My son is a picky eater) Overall it was a hit!!

I wouldn't have thought to include sun-dried tomatoes in a tuna alfredo dish. It turns out it's delicious. This recipe is definitely worth repeating.

Delicious! I did what another reviewer suggested and added 2 cans of tuna in water. I also added a 1/4 tsp of red chili flakes, pepper, oregano, basil, and parsley.
