This is quite good and different! After reading the reviews i made some alterations. I only used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 because everyone was saying how sweet it was. Also, i added an extra half cup of eggnog, as everyone was saying it was too crumbly and dry. I cut it before it was fully finished hardening up to prevent any breakage as well. My boyfriend loved it and ate quite a few pieces. It is still super sweet even with only 2 cups of sugar. I might try 1 1/2 cups next time.  Tip: Make sure you put it in a 9x9 pan because it was way too thin in a 9x13.

Turned out hard and crumbly.  Should use a candy thermometer to cook to the correct stage.  Boiling for 6 minutes was much too long.

This fudge is amazing! I normally don't like fudge but this one is so, so good. I was a bit more liberal with cinnamon and nutmeg than the recipe indicated and I skipped lining the pan with foil and just sprayed it with Pam. Excellent and so easy!

I don't know what happened to this fudge but it was a complete disaster.  I followed the directions to the letter and it only came out as a dry, crumbly mess, the texture of granola.  Couldn't even bother spreading it in the pan.  It didn't burn so I don't know what happened.  I did half the recipe but that should not have made a difference.  Hope others have better luck.

Like several others here, my first attempt with this recipe was a disaster - the fudge was so grainy and hard I could hardly get it out of the saucepan. I was very disappointed.

I searched the net and found some other versions of this recipe and several stressed the importance of using regular, not low-fat eggnog - so I think that was my critical error. I tried it again with regular eggnog and a few other modifications I saw in other comments: 2 c. sugar, only 5 minutes on the second boil, 1/2 t. rum extract, and I used an 8 x 8 pan. 

It turned out perfect this time and I can't wait to serve it on Christmas Day!

I love eggnog, & I loved the flavor of this fudge!  It was great for Christmas-- I had more than 1 person tell me it was their favorite selection from my cookie plate.  But it did turn out a little grainy & too soft... although the recipe does not call for a candy thermometer, I would suggest using one anyway to get the best texture.

I cut the recipe in half and omitted the cinnamon (I've never had it in eggnog, so I figured it made sense to leave it out of eggnog fudge) and the almonds.
I followed the recipe, and even turned down the heat when it started to boil - but allowed it to keep boiling.  It still turned out rather hard.  Not need-to-use-a-hammer hard, but not the smooth, creamy consistancy that I look for in fudge.  As for the taste, it was good.  Tasted like eggnog and VERY sweet.

I was really excited when I saw this recipe, and I made it following the recipe exactly. It did not make much fudge, it was about 1/4 inch thick. But I thought I must have done something wrong so I made it again, and yet again it turned out really thin. 
The next time I modified the recipe slightly according to the many popular reviews of this recipe. However, it turned out soupy and inedible. 
I loved the taste of this recipe, so I AM going to give it 2 stars, but I'm really sorry that I can't give it more. After 3 tries I'm not going to make this again.

Liked the recipe, not the directions. Fudge has to be brought to temperature (138* for soft ball) or it won't set. I used the quantities but brought it to 138* before adding the last ingredients. Turned out perfect but needs more nutmeg, the primary flavoring for eggnog. I also sprinkled freshly grated nutmeg on top. Yes, it's sweet, it's supposed to be, it's CANDY. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last Christmas to give out to family in treat bags as gifts. Everyone loved it! I had quite a bit left over so what I didn't keep for myself I took to work with me. My tin was empty in no time! I will definitely be making this recipe again :)

My husband said it would be cool if I could make eggnog fudge (he loves eggnog). So I searched for the recipe & made it for him. He loves it. He also took some to work and they gobbled it up. I added 1/2 tsp Imitation Rum flavoring and it was yummy. I think I will skip the nuts next time- kinda out of place to me when the drink doesn't have nuts in it. Thanks.

I am an experienced fudge maker and gave this my best shot. It is delicious ( I followed the recipe's spice suggestions ) but the texture is a bit crumbly. I wonder if there is a way to combine this idea with a recipe using white chocolate as a base. If so, it could be a winner. I did add 1/2 C extra eggnog based on reviews. I wouldn't call it a disappointment, but maybe a work in progress.

This fudge definately tasted like eggnog! It smelled wonderfully festive while cooking. I added butterscotch chips instead of the white chocolate. Definitely went well with the nutmeg sprinkled on top.

I was very disappointed.  the flavor was good, but it set way to fast and ended up being very hard.  I followed the recipe exactly, I think I will find another recipe and have better luck. Thanks anways.

Terrific recipe!  I brought it to a gathering and it was a big hit.  Several people wanted the recipe.  I like the fact that you don't need a candy thermometer to make it.  My fudge turned out very soft and stayed that way.  Thanks for sharing!  Yum!

Cut sugar to 2 cups, use a 9x9 pan, and USE A CANDY THERMOMETER to get the mixture up to about 238 degrees (Farenheit) before adding the white chocolate and butter. Note that another review says 138, which must be a typo, as the soft ball stage needed for fudge is 235 - 240 degrees. It took a while for my white chocolate chips to melt, so I kept the pan on the warm burner to help. Took a few minutes of stirring, but they finally melted, and the fudge turned out beautifully. I did a light dusting of nutmeg over the top and it looks and tastes great! Next time I may add a touch more cinnamon and nutmeg, but I think it depends on how "pre-spiced" your eggnog is.

After attempting to make this recipe twice with no success, I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and boiled for 5 minutes instead of 6 and it turned out perfectly.  It's still sweet, so cut into small pieces.  Also, pour into an 8x8 inch pan; 9x13 is too thin.

This fudge is great. My only suggestion is to put it in a smaller pan, such as 8x8. There was not enough to fill the larger pan.

Even if you don't care for eggnog this is a winner.  But it does burn easy so grease that pan or you will be scrubbing your fingers to the bone to get the burned sugar off the bottom....even with constant stirring

Couldn't have asked for a more awesome eggnog fudge!  I only used 1 1/2 cups sugar and it was still wicked sweet, but awesome!  It also set perfectly at room temp overnight.

Ended up VERY unappealing. The recipe calls for too much spice for the tastes of everyone who tried it, and mine was both mushy and grainy. On the plus side, it was quick and cleanup was pretty easy.

I brought this fudge to a cookie exchange. I warned everyone because I am not the best cook. It went over really well. People who were not even the biggest fans of egg nog, like my roommate, liked it. It is really sweet and if your not closely watching it at all times, it can "burn" and get really hard when it cools. I made 8 batches of this fudge for my cookie exchange and 5 of them turned out ok. The first one really well and then progressivly got worse. It seemed like 6 minutes was too long, I did it more for like 4 -5 minutes and I agree with less sugar and possibly more eggnog ... but overall it is quick if you're only making one batch it is easy, you just have to watch it .. like a toddler!!

Disaster. I followed the recipe instructions but reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup based on other reviews regarding the sweetness. When I added the chips they would not melt. I had to put the pot over heat again and they still would not melt. I finally just poured it into the pan and after two hours it still had the consistency of jelly. I was so excited to try this. What a disappointment

This is yummy and easy.  I actually added 1 teaspoon of apple pie spice seasoning and 1 teaspon of nutmeg for the flavoring. I think you could season it however you like your eggnog.:)

This is a very different recipe.  It is great, especially if you like the flavor of eggnog.  I found it a tad too sweet, but then, it IS fudge!  Just cut it into very small pieces, since it is so rich!

AMAZING!!! This fudge is sooooo delicious! I made a batch to send to my husband stationed in Iraq for Christmas. I almost didn't send it, it was so good! I will have to make a batch to stay here :) Just a touch of eggnog. Yum!

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it! I also sent some over to my boyfriend's family and they haven't stopped talking about it. Everyone wants the recipe. Mine didn't turn out hard or crumbly at all--the texture was perfect and fudgy.

I made this fudge as I had leftover eggnog to use up.  I found this fudge overly sweet but it did have a nice flavor overall.  My 19 month old daughter did love the sweet taste a lot though.  Also I gave most of it to my neighbour and she said she could not stop picking at it and that she enjoyed the taste very much.  
Personally if it were just a tad less sweet, as I have eaten fudge that wasn't that sugary tasting.

LOVED this recipe.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of rum extract when stirring at the end - and it tasted great.  I will make this every year!

I absolutely love this fudge - it tastes like Christmas. 
My 15 year old daughter, on the other hand, 
didn't care for it at all.......more for the adults!!
It's very easy to prepare - I'm making it again today.

I like the twist to the original choclate fudge. Eggnog, not just for drinking, anymore.

IT WAS FANTASTIC! ...  And I was making this fudge into the New Year!!! 
Made a few tweeks...  1oz Rum (I also used brandy, but most prefered the rum) and made up the difference with Jack Daniels brand Egg Nog,  (used Southern Comfort brand also- didn't notice a taste difference, I prefer these brands over the traditional prepared egg nogs, both are non-alcoholic)-- increased the nutmeg and added a touch of cinnamon

If you like eggnog will love this fudge!  Based on other reviews I used only 2 cups of sugar and 1 1/4 cup of eggnog.  Before the 1st boil, set on a lower heat and make sure your sugar dissolves before boiling.  This makes the whole process easier.  During 2nd boil, DO NOT time it, use a candy thermometer and take to soft ball stage.  Timing is not accurate and could change due to temperature of heat setting or ingredients.  I put the chips in a separate bowl and poured boiled mixture over it and beat with beater.  I beat just until it started to thicken.  Fudge came out perfect!   I chose not to add nuts.  If you want to add them, after beating, stir them in. I make all of my fudge the same way.  And they all come out wonderfully.

As many others did, I added 1/2 cup of extra egg nog and ommitted a cup of sugar. I also added a little extra nutmeg. The flavor is fabulous!! It hasn't set yet but I couldn't resist!

I'm not sure what happened while making this..? I followed everything (apart from adding slightly less sugar as advised by previous posters. For some reason, mine has not set. It's still all wobbly and semi liquid despite having sat around for about 4 hours now. put in the fridge. this didn't help. now in the freezer. hoping it will solid up enough to cut and it can be a cold dessert...unless it turns back to ooze before I reach the dinner party. Good thing this was only my second desert and not main one.

When I tried making this, the flavor was really delicious but the texture was grainy and the fudge was too gooey/mushy to consider serving it.

I tried this recipe and like some others who commented, mine came out hard and crumbly. Sounds like a good recipe, if anyone has tips on what I should be doing or did wrong would be great. Would love to try it again.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, though it taste wonderful, this is not "fudge." I do not know what I did wrong, but like another reviewer, I would have to say it was more like a eggnog taffy candy.

This is a good fudge, but I wish the egg nog flavor was a bit stronger. It is very subtle.  People either really like this fudge or aren't crazy about it, there doesn't seem to be an in between.  I make mixed fudge boxes for presents and always include this one.  It is very sweet and different and generally gets good reviews. I wouldn't serve alone since it is sooo sweet, but it is a good compliment to other treats.

This fudge tastes great, but mine came out too dry.  Maybe I cooked it too long?  When I tried to cut it, it kind of crumbled.

Mine tasted pretty good but it was a little hard for fudge.  Some pieces cut nicely, and others just kind of broke into shattered pieces.  Maybe I cooked it too long?  I didn't want it to be too soft like other posters.  Also, make sure your pot is big enough, I used a sauce pan I always use for fudge and when I added the marshmallows it expanded, dripped over the side of the pan and made a big mess on the stove.  The flavor is good though, I might try it again.

Brought this to a family gathering and 1/2 the people loved it, the other 1/2 didn't care for it. Personally, one piece is enough to last me a lifetime.
