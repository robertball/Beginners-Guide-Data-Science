I love to experiment with making sushi at home, but the raw fish part makes me nervous.  This recipe let us have that velvety smooth texture we love in salmon sushi without the raw fish.   I only made 1/2 the batch listed and I was so amazed  at how easy it was and how much more rewarding serving my sushi felt.

This is remarkable! The pleasing buttery texture of lox with a tiny fraction of the effort. I did learn that the thickness of each piece is critical to the timing. A few slices were too thin and I left them in the brine one extra minute resulting in those pieces being a touch to salty.  Resting in the fridge overnight seems essential to me. It was a little to close to sashimi after only a couple hours. I can’t wait to try again. This time I’ll use a skinless filet to see if that isn’t all the simpler to get perfect quarter inch thick slices.

I was a bit skeptical to try this, but it turned very good. Next time I'll add more smoked paprika and maybe some liquid smoke to further infuse the smoked flavor.

Tried recipe as listed.  Sprinkled fresh dill on salmon before refrigerating.  A bit of lemon juice on it before serving is wonder.

Fantastic dish. I followed the recipe and added dried dill from the garden last year after the cure. Very nice.
