A tasty, hearty chili-like soup.  The spices were more subtle than I expected.  I could find no cardamom so used extra cinnamon, and my five-quart pot was nearly over-flowing, so I only used one can of cannellini beans.  Great for meatless days, health & creative source of protein.

We had this for dinner tonight and it is good.  My boyfriend, a MEAT FREAK, did not even add any meat to it since it is so protien heavy.  The seasoning was nice, but a little subtle.  I will probably increase the seasonings next time, but the good news is that there will be a next time.  Thanks for an easy and filling recipe.
