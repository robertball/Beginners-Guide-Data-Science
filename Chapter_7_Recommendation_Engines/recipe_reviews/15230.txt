This is a recipe that I received several years ago from a friend. It was then called "Garbage Dip". I have taken it to several parties and it has always been a great hit. Someone always asks me for the recipe. I usually double the recipe. Big dipper corn chips are the best with this salsa. Try it you will love it.

This is a wonderful combination of flavors. And a nice change from traditional salsa.

Wonderful dish to make a day ahead & take to a party.  My favorite way of doing things, so that I may focus on looking  beautiful before a party instead of cooking :)  I have made this a few times and people are ALWAYS asking for the recipe!

Easy to make and very yummy! Instead of using olive oil I purchased diced tomatoes that had olive oil and garlic already mixed-in. Still used garlic because I love it. Use Lawrey's Season Salt to give it that extra flavor.

We liked this recipe but thought it got a little too "juicy". Maybe need to drain the tomatoes a little or not add the red wine vinegar.

This was good and easy to make. I only made half of the recipe as it yields quite a bit and it was only for me to snack on. It didn't blow me away but I did eat it all up with corn chips and I could actually see this served over crostini as well. I really don't like the name of the recipe though. Mock Caviar?? Why? Because it is mostly black? Not all caviar is black and it definitely tastes nowhere near. I'd rather call it Olive Salsa as it is called in the description and more people might be willing to give it a try. Oh well. Like I said good over all but not something out of this world (at least for my taste).

We loved the "caviar" I made for Super Bowl! I Californized mine adding 1 - 15 oz. can pinto beans more garlic and onion cilantro and using fresh jalapeno instead of the green chilis. I was lazy so used about 12 oz. -3/4 of a bottle- of zesty Italian salad dressing. Yum!!

This one is a winner! I could eat the whole batch by myself! I highly recommend making it a day ahead so the flavors coagulate and fuse together.

I've been making this amazingly simple dip for over 10yrs. The first time I had this dip was at a potluck. I didn't know who made it to ask for the recipe. I just knew there were olives in it. I scoured the Internet and found this recipe I don't think it was on this site though.. Every time I make it I get compliments and requests for the recipe. it's a family favorite and now my daughters serve it up. The only thing I do a little different is I process everything in a mini chopper to make it a little finer so there aren't big chunks of tomato or chilies.

This is good but not great. It may be just my taste because others appear to really like it.

I have made this for every party I have had over several years and it is always a hit. When I have it left over I eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. I highly recommend it. I have been making this since 1996!
