I have not used this particular recipe but i bake a lemon pie thats the same idea.  If you're having problems with the pie not setting try using slightly less milk, and cool whip.  Also a tip if you're using a blender blend on a very low speed.  Beating with a wire whisk is best, but takes a very long time and wears out your arm.  Our blender has a wire whisk attachment which works best!!!  Hope this helps for all you guys who had a runny pie!!!  Also if it lacks the pumpkin pie taste just add a little more pumpkin spice than it calls for.  Play with the recipes for your taste :)

Good taste, but a bit light on the pumpkin flavor.  This pie was made with the graham cracker crust.  The filling is a bit too soft.  Even after chilling for 3 hours, this pie falls apart when cut.  It would really work better as a layered parfait instead of a pie.

We made this with our afterschool kids and they loved making and eating it.  We made it in individual pie shells and everyone had their own.  It was great and we plan to use it every year.

My daughter has a severe egg allergy and almost all pumpkin pie recipes have eggs.  This pie is a great option that the whole family will enjoy.

Very good!  Easy to put together.  It was a fluffier version of a traditional pumpkin pie.  I used a graham cracker crust and next time would like to try making the crust with half graham crackers, half ginger snaps.  I doubled the recipe to use the entire can of pumpkin puree and was glad I did.  Everyone enjoyed the pie and the fluffiness made you feel better about having dessert.  I topped with a thin layer of the whipped topping and sprinkled with cinnamon.

This recipie is very yummy and simple to make.  I made it last year and came to this site to find the recipie again cause I had lost it.  As the other review said it does tend to fall apart, but the taste and ease more than make up for the small mess.

I was a little confused by this recipe because there is no 3.4 oz box of instant pudding - the largest is 1.5 ounce...so that's what I used. I should have used two (1.5 oz) boxes because the pie did not firm up very well. Even so, it was WAY TOO SWEET. If I were to make this again, I'd add maybe 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the whipped cream - if any at all. But I will not be making this again.

I made this with a class of children, and they all loved it! We used a graham cracker crust instead of the regular pie crust - it was a hit from beginning to end.

i made this recipe once as written, and it was decent - not quite a pie, more like pudding in a crust. but for a quickie dessert it served it's purpose.  tonight i completely revamped it and it is so good with the modifications i made!! here's what i did: i increased the pumpkin and cool whip to 1 1/2 cups, nixed the cinnamon and increased the pumpkin pie spice to 1 tso. instead of a pie crust i crumbed about 10 gingerbread cookies in the bottom of a 9" square pan, and spread the pumpkin mixture on top. given the fact that i used sugar free / fat free pudding, lite cool whip, reduced fat gingersnaps, and skim milk, it's pretty light on calories for a dessert.  and delicious!! thanks!

This was great and really easy, I used a cracker/cookie type crust. I had to wing it on the pumpkin pie spice and ended up adding too much ginger, but actually everyone loved it that way and are begging me to make it again for Christmas!

This is quick and easy.  Kids liked it. Husband and  I did not care for it.  It needs more spices and could be a tad sweeter.  Texture is mushy.  But if you need something in a hurry that is easy than this is for you.

I've made this recipe a couple of times this fall and it's been wonderful every time.  Its so fast and easy, people have even asked for the recipe.  I do use a whole can of pumpkin and more cool whip and it has always turned out great.

Awesome recipe! I tried this once and wanted to make it myself. I used the called for vanilla pudding amount but used a full can of pumpkin puree. Also used about 1/2 of the tub of whipped cream. I got 1 full pie and 1 about 3/4 filled pie.

I love this pie.  I actually use lowfat ingredients and it still tastes great.  I made it for the future inlaws for Thanksgiving and they raved about it.  Even my boyfriend who doesn't like pumpkin pie liked it (as far as pumpkin pie goes).

This wasn't sweet enough to me.  The consistency was fine, but when I eat a creamy dessert like that, I am looking for "decadence"!  The presentation wasn't too pretty either.  We will finish off what's in the fridge though!

Great light flavor pumpkin pie! I actually made 6 mini pies. I melted some caramel sauce and spread it on bottom. I sprinkled a few pecans on top of the sauce. After filling; I topped with a few more chopped pecans.  When I served the pies, I put on whip cream and  drizzled a bit more caramel sauce. I used a fondant leaf for decorating each mini pie.

I don't know what everyone is raving about! This tastes gummy and "fake"... I'm sure it's due to the pudding mix. (and I should have known better, since I really only like things that are truly from scratch). I made  a spiced cookie in tartlet tins and piped in the filling once it firmed up in fridge. I had no problems with it being runny, it just tastes bad (to me... my husband liked it, but he'll eat anything I make). It's already 10:30 the night before thanksgiving... but I'm tempted to make a baked pumpkin pie once the flourless chocolate cake gets out of the oven....

If you cut down on the milk for this recepie, it works out great!  I usually just buy the premade graham crusts (tarts) and make this with my class at school.  Then, we pour the pie filling in and it makes a neat and easy fall treat for them--make aroung Halloween or Thanksgiving.

Made as described with 2 pkgs vanilla pudding mix no sugar except increased pumpkin to whole can of pumpkin, substituted no fat 1/2 and 1/2 cream, dashes of cinnamon, dash ginger and allspice as I had no pumpkin pie spice on hand and instead of cool whip added 4 oz. cream cheese.  Served the pie with cool whip on the side.
