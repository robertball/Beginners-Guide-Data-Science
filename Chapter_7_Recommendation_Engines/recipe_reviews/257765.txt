These were fantastic! I made the burgers into slider size. The only changes that I made were that I used fresh mozzarella and my own sauce that I had on hand. Thank you for the great recipe! It will definitely become a regular on my menu!

I made little sliders out of this recipe and they were a big hit. The footnotes mention using spaghetti sauce if you don't want to make the sauce and that is exactly what I did. Super simple!
