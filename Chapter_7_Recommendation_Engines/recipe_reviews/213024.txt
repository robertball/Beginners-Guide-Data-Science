I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday for my New Year's Day dinner.  I could only give it three stars--and I am being generous here--because the peas were not done, even after continued cooking for two extra hours.  By the time the peas were done, the tomatoes and other ingredients were overcooked.  Shouldn't the peas be soaked for at least three hours or so beforehand?  I definitely think this recipe is a winner and a keeper.  And I am going to make it again...after I find out/figure out how to fully cook the peas.  When that happens, I will give it the full five-star  rating that it so rightfully deserves.

Just made this for New Year's Day and it's great.  I made a couple of changes - I left out the fresh jalapeno and instead added a can of Original Rotel (still used 1 can diced tomatoes, too), and I added some chopped up ham.  Cut up and then cooked the bacon in the microwave, less mess than a skillet.  I put it in at 11:30pm and it cooked on low for 12 hours, the beans are the perfect tenderness.

Did not slow cook! ...Best peas ever after 3 days. My objective was more like a BEP soup of sorts. Did not want the peas to turn to mush. I was concerned about that with the leftovers if I slow cooked it.  User the base recipe but here's my modifications - Soaked peas overnight, drained. Begin on the stove top w/ a dutch oven or big pot.  Used leftover spiral ham from Turkeyday instead of bacon. 8c water, can of chicken stock, cut up jalapeno nacho slices, can of fire roasted tomatoes (held off on these till after the boil), and tyme in addtion to garlic and chili powder. Brought to boil, and then low simmer for 2-3 hours. The first day it did need a little minor seasoning w/ salt & pepper, but it had a little zip to it. 2nd day was really good. Finished the last bowl today and was wishing I have a 2nd bowl. Served with fresh cornbread.

This made a great New Year's Day dish, but would work well any time of year.  I added the "rest of the bacon" and used a large can of diced tomatoes.  The taste is great!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is phenomenal! To me, it is not the recipe provider's responsibility to teach people how to cook, but solely to share a great recipe with directions of how to prepare it. A person should already know how to soak and clean the peas before attempting a dish like this. I used spicy hot link sausages instead of bacon to flavor the peas, but next time I will try bacon as instructed. Also, I had jarred jalapeno's, so I chopped a few and threw them in. Since I am a fan of spiciness, I also added tobasco sauce which made for a great, highly flavored reddish colored juice along with the stewed tomatos for the peas to soak the flavor of. AWESOME!

I've used this recipe with a minor change. I also added two smoked ham hocks in it.  I did not use a slow cooker, but cooked it on the stove.  I also added thyme!  I let it cook for about 2 1/2 hours on a low simmer!  Came out perfect!

Cooked this today for a new years day lunch pot luck entry.  Every one loved it.  I didn't use the jalapeno because some people (not me) in my family don't like spicy foods.

Delicious! I make Black Eyed Peas every year for New Year's Day and this was by far better than what I usually do. I think this recipe will become a New Year's tradition.

I made this a little differently because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I used chopped sun dried tomatoes and cumin because I didn't have the canned tomatoes and chili powder (how did that happen?!), but it turned out great, especially the next day when the flavors melded. Thanks for the submission!

Awesome!  I added a bag of fresh collard greens and a can of Rotel b/c I didnt have jalapeno on hand.  It took a long time (8+ hrs) for my black eyed peas to cook even though I soaked them but I have read that the cooking time for BEPs can vary depending on the age of the dried beans.  Also, I have read that adding salt and acid (both present in canned tomatoes) can increase cooking time.  So, when I make this again I am going to try to cook the beans alone for a few hours before adding the other ingredients.  But seriously, this recipes is worth a couple practice runs!

Used the cooking method only with this recipe, combined with Tam's recipe on here. Happy New Year and thanks CB! I cooked longer, overnight in the crockpot. Put peas in about 9pm and they were done this morning.

I love this recipe!!  I have used it (with small changes) to cook dried black eyed peas and now dried cranberry beans!!  So good!  Next, kidney beans.  I used a 3 qt. sauce pan to brown 2 slices of bacon.  That helps the splatter problem.  Added the onion before the bacon was done.  Used Mexican style stewed tomatoes, garlic and chili powders, no jalapeno.  The peas did fine without soaking but I quick soaked the beans per the bag directions.  Slow cooked on High about 2 hours, then Low about 4.  So much flavor!!  With cornbread, a meal in itself!!

Of course I knew to soak. So I soaked in crock pot for 2hrs and cooked for 4. Total 6hours on low. Made with salted pork. Everything else the same. While family ate and loved. That's rare.

Every year we eat black eyed peas on New Years Day....and every year they are sooooo boring and difficult to choke down....EXCEPT this year!!!!  YUM YUM YUM!  I made a few adjustments, but the basic recipe for this was amazing.  I used a lot of bacon, canned black eyed peas, green chilies and some red chili paste.  Other than those modifications, and I made enough for a double batch......this recipe is worth keeping and I will now make these for my family throughout the year and not just on New Years...thanks to cbjc  for posting this recipe!

I simmered this in a stock pot since I don't have a slow cooker. I used Anaheim peppers instead of jalapeno because I had a lot of garden peppers to use up.  I also used the equivalent amount of a different type of bacon.  I soaked the peas the night before, which may not be necessary but its usually what I do. I would like to try this sometime with red beans or pinto beans.

First of all let me say this is the best and easiest black eyed pea recipe ever. I have yet to make peas from dried and have them turn out. I made this recipe for New Year's Day and served it on rice with cornbread  sticks. The recipe makes a lot more than we can eat so next time I will cut the recipe in half. Tonite I am  adding some of the leftovers to  make beef soup. It's  almost a chili.

I've been cooking for many, many years, so rarely can I not find some way to salvage a recipe. FYI, you will have to cook the peas at least 5 hours on high in order for them to get done. Even so, this recipe is simply not good, in my humble opinion. I'm glad that some people liked it, but I found it to be bland slop that I promptly flushed down the garbage disposal.

This is a great recipe for 1st time pea cookers.  The peas were nicely done and had a very nice aroma.  Instead of the diced tomatoes I used a 8oz can of roasted garlic tomato sauce and it wonderful.

This is a good way to spice up the peas. I used Rote in place  of diced tomatoes and left out the jalapeño. I also added some diced ham. Tasty!

We took the suggestion for adding rotel, and used a ham hock instead of bacon.  It was very good on a cold, gloomy New Year’s Day.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this recipe yesterday and followed it exactly, with the exception  of the diced tomatoes, which I was out of. I did not presoak the peas, so I extended the cooking time. The flavor was great, and I had never cooked peas like that before. Adding the bacon and the grease really added great flavor. Next time I'll make sure to have the diced tomatoes and just add them about the last hour of cooking.

I made this for our annual New Years Day lunch with friends. This was a huge hit. Even the southern ladies that have been eating black eye peas for years asked for the recipe.

Used this as the base for my recipe. Adapted it to suit my families taste, budget and to the cooking time of my slow cooker and it turned out great!  Would give a 5 Star if I had used the recipe as written. Thank you for sharing.

Love these, made them on the stove and they cooked in about 2 1/2 hours. I added chopped smoked summer sausage and a bay leaf. Delicious!

This was just what I was looking for to take to a New Year's dinner of roast pork and sauerkraut.  I substituted a can of Glory seasoned blackeyed peas for the dried peas, and canned diced green chilies for the jalapeño.  I included the bacon but not the bacon fat!  After frying the bacon, I discarded the drippings, added a little olive oil to the pan, and sauteed the onion and garlic until well done.  I also added a little fresh baby spinace for luck ("beans and greens"). It all went into the slow cooker on low for several hours.  Everyone loved it.

I loved it as a great base!  It would have been fine just like it is yet I knew when I read it that is was perfect to add a few of my favorites.  I tweeked it so I will share what I did in a new recipe.  Using canned black eyed peas makes this recipe go a little faster.

These are the most delicious black eyed peas I've ever had, and I'm a Southern girl who grew up eating BEP all my life! I only changed a few things. We had a bone and meat left over from our Christmas ham, so I didn't use bacon. But I will next time I cook this. Also, I used fresh thyme instead of dried, and added celery and bell peppers that I had left over in the fridge. I was surprised how well all the liquid cooked down! Having that amount of liquid helped to really blend all the flavor swell; and the celery, bell peppers, and onions simply disintegrated into the blend so that you don't see them, but can taste their flavoring. My husband and I adore these peas!! I'll be cooking this again in the near future!!!

I added to this by Clean and soak the peas overnight. I also substituted water with chicken stock and instead of bacon I slow cooked with ham hocks. Seasoning was great may have added a pinch more is so of each to taste.
