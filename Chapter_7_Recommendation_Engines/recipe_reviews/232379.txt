I did not have reduced fat peanut butter on hand--I used plain ol' Jif. I also did not have whole wheat pastry/bread flour, I used regular whole wheat flour. I did make muffins out of this recipe instead of one big loaf--I got eighteen medium sized muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350, they were done at 20 minutes. Nice, basic banana bread recipe that is lightly sweetened. We wished there was more peanut butter flavor but that can be easily solved next time by cutting back the bananas by a half cup and adding in more peanut butter.

Very tasty. I love the healthy ingredients. I made muffins instead of bread, which means less cook time.  I only had about one cup of bananas so I added applesauce and a few peach slices to make up the difference. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg. These are not the sweetest muffins, but my husband and I both enjoyed how well the flavors all came together. I would make this again.

Because of the only other review, I decided to add more peanut butter.  Somehow, I managed to get distracted and in the end added 3/4 c of peanut butter instead of 2 T plus a little more.  That was my fault.  I only had 1 1/2 c of banana so I think the extra peanut butter helped with that.  I also had no ww bread flour or ww pastry flour so I used 1 c of white cake flour and 1 c of regular ww flour but the recipe notes said that was okay for this recipe.  I also used regular crunchy peanut butter.  The batter seemed the right consistency going in the oven and smelled good.  It baked almost done in 60 minutes but since the middle was still gooey, I did as I always do with quick breads and turned off the oven and let it sit in there for a while to finish in the middle.  This did get the edges a little over done but the middle was cooked when I cut it.  Most of this went to work with the husband this morning for his coworkers.  I would say this is a decent banana bread but I doubt that I'd make it again.
