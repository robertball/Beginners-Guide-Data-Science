Delicious cake!  I will definitely make it again, but would add more cranberries next time.

I made this cake to bring to work, and everyone loved it!  I had no hazlenuts, so I used pecans, and I added more cranberries, but other than that , I wouldn't change a thing!  I usually make a "Jewish" coffee cake in a bundt or angel-food cake pan, so this was a niace change, both the pan and the cake!

Very nice coffee cake. Wasn't able to have any warm, which I believe is the best way to enjoy coffee cake, but this one sustained me all week for breakfasts.  Great for eating in the car, as there were very few crumbs.

The cake description says “...fine, cake-like texture and swirls of cinnamon sugar.”  Although moist, the cake itself was dense, and dark in color from all of the brown sugar, so you could not see any “swirls.”  The best way to describe the flavor is sort of like a spice cake.  I didn’t deviate from the recipe at all (and I did use cake flour), but I think both the cranberries and the hazelnuts need to be doubled.  I had a hard time finding hazelnuts, and when I did, they were very expensive.  If you have the same situation, IMO pecans would make a good substitution.  I checked at 70 minutes, and it already was a bit overdone.  I’d recommend you start checking at about 60-65 minutes, acknowledging that oven temps can vary greatly.  Don’t need to sound negative, it was good, but the texture and the appearance just weren't what I was expecting.

This was very good. I did change a few things just to cut back on the calories (used 1/2 cup fat-free milk and 1/4 cup fat-free half and half and didn't use of the topping it called for). I substituted fresh cranberries for the dried and used pecans instead of hazelnuts (leftover stuff from Christmas). I also only baked it for 45 min...this could have been due to my inconsistent oven though. Delicious!!!

Made it according to recipes. It came out a little too dry. Next time will keep it in the oven for shorter time.

Meh.  Came out "fine", but the components underwhelmed me.  There are too many other recipes to make this twice.
