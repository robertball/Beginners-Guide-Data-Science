Use a little less olive oil, and start with just 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, and 1/4 cup wine -- more can be added if you like..keep tossing spinach as it starts to wilt to keep combined with the mushrooms and onions, and sprinkle on some parmesean cheese just before serving....I will also add some diced and seeded Roma tomatoes at the very end before adding the cheese and serving.

Too much vinegar ... also, the ingredient order doesn't seem to work. Next time I'll add the wine early, let it simmer a bit, then add the spinach at the last minute with a splash of balsalmic - that way the spinach won't lose all its volume.

Restaurant quality sidedish, definitely a keeper!  Used 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 small onion (chopped), 3 cloves garlic (minced), 8  large mushrooms (sliced), 1/2 bag of spinach (not chopped), 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup white wine, s&p and no parsley.  It only took about 20 minutes to make, too! As per past reviews, I added the spinach last (after the vinegar and white wine had reduced), so that the greens wouldn't be overcooked.  Also, next time, I will use 2/3 bag of spinach as 1/2 a bag was just barely enough for 2 servings.

A different and very tasty way to serve spinach. 
The balsamic vinegar gives it an interesting taste. Even though I used all 4 tbsp. of olive oil as the  recipe indicates, I don't think all of it is really necessary. You could probably cut it in half without losing any flavor.

I am unfamiliar with Southern Italian cooking so I was curious and wanted to give this a shot.  I am, however, quite familiar with saut√©ing spinach with garlic and olive oil, so it was basically cooking it with the wine and even more so the vinegar, that was something different for me.  I was not prepared for just how much I would dislike this. First, even tho' I cooked the spinach at the end, after the wine and vinegar had cooked out, it was still overdone. Second, the wine and especially the balsamic vinegar, completely overtook the delicate flavor of the spinach with an unpleasant, overbearing tang.  I'm afraid it was completely unpalatable to me.

This was delicious.  We made it without mushrooms (I don't like them) and we didn't have white wine so we used a splash of white wine vinegar and some water.  I agree with the other posters who said you probably don't have to add quite that much olive oil.  We ate it with scallops and rice and it was wonderful!  Will definitely be making this one again.

Nice flavor. I made this as directed, except omitting the onion for no reason other than I didn't feel like chopping one. Next time, I would probably use more spinach and add it later in the process as it got a little overcooked for my taste. Good stuff, though. Thanks!

I really liked this, but my boyfriend wasn't crazy about the wine. It definitely adds a distinct flavor--it reminds me of the sauteed mushrooms you get in a nice restaurant. I was generous with the salt and pepper, and it definitely improved the flavor. The only change I'd make is to add more spinach.

I am always up for trying a new healthy side dish to go along with my main dish but i don't think this was it. I couldn't account for all the calories in a mediocre dish. It could have been my own flaw when cooking it, but i felt the wine and balsamic vinegar over powered the dish. I really love mushrooms and spinach but I couldn't taste them. i would be willing to try it again using half the wine, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

This was delicious, even though I had to omit the wine.  I think in the future I would add the spinach at the very end, as after the last bit of cooking the spinach became a little too overcooked for my tastes (I like it just barely wilted).  Still, this was delicious!

Love this recipie - I use a little less white wine, though. I make this all the time, especially with the Garlic Marinated Steaks.

I loved it! I've never cooked fresh spinach before and I followed the directions as is and it turned out great! The only thing I did different was cut the recipe in half and I forgot about the parsley.

I doubled this recipe and served it with Garlic herb pork tenderloin from this site. It was really good but it had to cook a long time for the balsamic vinegar to evaporate. I will make this again.

I love spinach and mushroom sautee. I am familiar with olive oil, garlic and white wine but the balsamic vinegar mixed in was completely different for me. I was game to try anything new. Thou I sometimes like the slightly stronger taste of vinegar (with other dishes) I know balsamic vinegar can overpower the taste of other ingredients with its "sweet and sour" complex flavors. I sauteed the mushrooms with about 2T of olive oil and red onions, garlic then added the white wine and let it cook down. I added almost 1/2 T of vinegar, to taste. The spinach was added last as it cooks down really fast. Hubs liked the flavor of balsamic vinegar but that is all he could taste-not the wine, spinach or mushrooms. I thought the taste was ok but I am glad that I did not add the full amount of vinegar, olive oil and white wine the recipe asks for as I am afraid it would have been much too overpowering for the spinach and mushroom. This balsamic vinegar gave the mushroom and spinach sautee a different taste. Then again you would have to like the "sweet and sour" flavor of balsamic vinegar. I also don't think you needed to add that much olive oil, white wine and/or balsamic vinegar. For myself I just eye-balled the amount and add to taste as I sautee. I finished this off with some seasoned Hawaiian sea salt, fresh ground black pepper and then garnished with fresh chopped italian flat leaf parsely. If I were to make this again I would cut back even more on the balsamic vinegar to 1/2 - 1 tsp.

I cut the olive oil in half to make it healthier and threw in some yellow and red bell for extra nutrition and color. Oh and I used baby spinach leaves so there was no need to chop. This is one I will definitely make again, thanks!

I thought this was fantastic prepared exactly as written.  I served it was Feta-crusted Salmon from this site and it made a marvelous combination.  However, as a word of caution, there is no camouflaging of flavors in this dish.  If you don't like spinach, mushrooms, or wine on its own, then you probably won't care for this.

I love this recipe! I usually eat it as a side dish, but last night I topped chicken parmeasean with it for a lovely take on an old favorite. I had to use red wine and that was different, but wonderful as well.

Yum! I performed a recipe search for a vegetarian main dish with spinach and mushrooms. This recipe was one that came up in the search. To make it a main dish I added a can of Great Northern Beans. I would have preferred cannellini beans but didn't have them. Next time I will try them instead. As suggested by several reviewers, I reduced the olive oil to about 2 tablespoons, the white white to 1/4 cup, and the balsamic vinegar to 1 tablespoon. I cooked the onions over a low heat to just caramelizing and then added the garlic (I doubled the garlic because we like extra garlic) to cook for a couple more minutes before adding the mushrooms. After a couple minutes I added the wine. I rinsed the beans and added them. Finally the last couple of minutes I added to spinach and cooked until wilted. I added a handful of halved grape tomatoes. Mixed it all together, turned off the heat and stirred in the vinegar. I served it over rotini. At the table I had fresh grated parmesan available. I will definitely make this again.

This was super. I am not a spinach lover. It is too bitter for me. I am trying to teach my kids to eat a variety of foods. I sometimes have to eat spinach to convince them that greens are their friends. I actually loved this! I used chicken broth instead of white wine because I forgot to buy wine. I also added a few red pepper flakes after tasting it and decided it needed a little more "something". I would make again!

Great way to use fresh spinach. I didn't bother chopping the spinach since it wilts down.  I did add 4 cloves of garlic :)

Great, easy recipe.  Based on other reviews I omitted the vinegar.  I also let the spinach cook down and added about a dozen whole grape tomatoes.

A great combination of flavors.  However, I did use only 1 Tbsp. olive oil.  I've already made this twice and will make again!

This recipe is amazing!! Everyone loves this and they are always asking for the recipe!I have made this several times now and will continue to make it. Definetly let it simmer for awhile after you add the wine though or you will have too much of the wine flavor when you eat it.

Oh my. I did make minor adjustments, but this was incredible. I added the wine (Chardonnay) a few minutes after the mushrooms to reduce. A few splashes of balsamic went in with the spinach at the very end, and I only cooked that long enough for the spinach to start to wilt.  We will absolutely make this again!

There was something wrong with the recipe. There was too much balsamic vinegar. 
I have some adjustments to it:
1. Only put 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. 
2. Add the balsamic to the mushrooms first, then add the wine.  Then reduce the wine and cook off the alcohol.
3. Add the spinach and mix it at the last moment. It is better to have the spinach relatively green and fresh instead of wilted
4. Add Parmesan Cheese and parsley in top as garnish.  The Parmesan adds flavor.

Fabulous!  I've made this about five times now.  I didn't change any ingredients but I did change the cooking method slightly.  I saute the onions, garlic and mushrooms in olive oil first, then add other liquid ingredients and simmer until reduced by half, then I add the spinach last, cover and turn off heat and let sit until wilted.  I serve over whole grain penne pasta and top with grated Parmesan as a meal.

We will definitely be making this again. My son dislikes cooked spinach and hates mushrooms, and even he liked this. The ingredient order worked just fine for me. I will, however, halve the liquid ingredients so that I don't wind up with as much on the bottom of the pan.

I've been lookn for haelthy dishes. I found this one and decided to try it. I read the reviews and found the very helpful.  I added may spinach after the white wine cooked down a bit and used the little bit of vinegar leftover in the measuring cup for a bit extra. Alittle sea salt and the pepper. It was very tasty. I ate it with coucous.   I made one serving and it was very filling. A recipe that I am going to use again. ALSO if you don't have time or can't chop onions(Ican't) I bought pre chopped onions and pre sliced portabelo mushrooms. This saved me time and my eyes didn't burn all night.    For quick and tastey this one is great. THANKS.

Definitely use less wine in this. I usually add some fresh cut up asparagus to it, if I have on hand. My family enjoys this recipe.This is a good basic recipe that can be enhanced to your liking.

I didn't follow this exactly. I added 8oz mushroom instead of 14. I put about 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar instead of white wine. I used 3 cloves of garlic. Lastly, I used a little less balsamic because of others' comments. The outcome was pretty tasty and I'll definitely make it again.

I did not have onions or mushrooms, so I substituted some onion powder and yellow/orange peppers.  It was tasty.  I do not typically eat cooked spinach, but this had a better flavor.  Like others I doubled the amount of spinach, 1/4 c wine, and added the spinach last.

I did not have the mushrooms to add to this recipe so I made it with out them. It was good. My wife and grandson loved it however. I think I would have gave it at least a four star if I hasd the mushrooms in the dish as the recipe called for. I think it would have have given it a more earthy taste that I like.

I used fresh lemon juice instead of balsamic vinegar, and frozen spinach instead of fresh. It came out great! I do recommend sauteeing the mushrooms first, put them into a bowl, then the onions and garlic, add them to the mushroom bowl, then cook the frozen spinach. When the spinach is hot add the mushrooms/onions/garlic back in, stir, add the white wine and lemon juice, cook to incorporate all the flavors, then add salat to taste.  Yum!

I must admit I had less spinach than called for, but after reading the reviews here I would probably add more than the recipe calls for, and add it at the VERY end, as mine got pretty soggy when done. This seems like a lot of work for a side dish and I will probably look for another recipe of this type. I did enjoy it though.

This is recipe is a very good recipe.  I saut√©ed 2 shallot in the olive oil, then added 1/4 cup white wine and 1 TBSP balsamic vinegar cooked to reduce the balsamic for about 3 minutes. Added the mushrooms first, then the spinach last with a slash more of the white wine, salt and pepper.  Great!

My husband nor I liked this recipe. I think we are simple eaters and prefer our spinach steamed and that is it.  I followed other readers advice and used only half the oil, and balsamic vinegar.  I used 1/3 cup white wine, and no salt.  The flavors just did not pop for us.  I can't think of a way to improve it either.  I think we are set in our ways as far as spinach is concerned.

I loved it.  A few of my guests loved and a few said it was just ok.  I guess it depends on your tastes.  I will make it again and I did not "tweak" anything

Turned out ok seems like there were plenty of mushrooms I will do half that next time. I agree with Honey and Bear Trapper to change thinks up a little.

Made minor changes; used a shallot instead of an onion for a more subtle flavor; used way less olive oil (about 1/2 what the recipe calls for) and I agree that adding the wine to simmer with the mushrooms for a bit before adding the spinach is the way to go to avoid over cooking the spinach.  It's a tasty side dish for any meal with beef/steak/pork etc.

I loved this recipe!  I was trying to use up some fresh spinach and some baby portabella mushrooms.  DELICIOUS!    I will be making this wonderful side dish when I prepare a nice mild fish or chicken.  Imagine it would go great with a nice pork roast as well.  I loved the tang I got from the balsamic vinegar and white wine.
This is the first time I have made my spinach this way as I usually saut√©' my spinach with garlic olive oil.    
I will continue to make my spinach as I have always done, but this is going into the mix of recipes that I prepare every day.

This is a very good recipe. As others mentioned, you can cut back on the olive oil and still have a tasty dish.

I really liked this recipe. It's really fast and tastes great to me. I didn't measure anything but, I'm pretty sure my ratios were right. I did led the wine and vinegar reduce into a sauce before adding the spinach, tho.

This was delicious and very easy to make although I did not quite put quite as much white wine as suggested because I only had a rather sweet white wine.    I served it on a bed of pasta with tomato sauce.  I think this is the kind of dish you can personalize to suit one's preferences.  I would certainly make it again.

Very good, the portobellos really give this dish a facelift. I personally ended up doubling the balsamic vinaigrette, because it felt it was a little bland. Will definitely be making again.

Enjoyed this dish a lot--big mushroom fan. This takes at least fifteen to twenty medium-sized mushrooms; 10 oz of spinach is a full bag. I think the vinegar and wine measurement worked. Made four medium side servings. Only change--spinach last as others suggest.

Super DELICIOUS!! 
We didn't have balsamic so I had to use red wine vinegar along with the white wine. The family totally loved this flavorful spinach that I'll definitely be making this again very soon, for lunch and dinner.

I followed the changes suggested about when to mix in the spinach and wine, as well as reducing the basalmic. Topped with parmesan, and it turned out very tasty!

I added some diced red pepper for color, some water chestnuts for texture and a scrambled egg and a dollop of mustard for taste and consistency. 
Very good, all in all, but still....it's spinach :)

This is definitely a keeper!  I did add Feta cheese at the end. It was just to tempting. I love the flavors of the vinegar and wine! I did reduce the olive oil in half due to I was using frozen spinach.
Wonderful dish!

Four and a half stars, my wife says.

I think it could be fine with slightly less balsamic, but she liked it as it was. We used some decent white wine. So thanks for a great new recipe!

This recipe was an instant hit for my entire family. I substituted the wine for apple juice and used 6 cloves of garlic instead of two. (We are garlic lovers). It is important to allow the vinegar time to reduce before you pour in the white wine, (or in my case apple juice) while stirring it constantly.This allows it time to intermingle with the garlic, onions,vegetables and pick up the flavors. I did this on high heat in a stir fry motion. ( I do a lot of Asian cooking). It doesn't take long to reduce this way. Then when the pan was good and hot I poured in the apple juice, watched it sizzle and brought it to a fast bubble while stirring - and then quickly reduced the temperature of the pan and brought it to a slow bubble and allowed it to reduce and thicken to a creamy sauce. Not runny. This dish is fast and I make it right before serving.

I am making this again tomorrow at the request of my children for Easter. My plan is to slightly caramelize the onions this time in bacon drippings and then add the garlic and saute the vegetables. I'll let you know how it goes!

Delicious, I made the recipe as the Most helpful Positive Reviewer, with less olive oil and less balsamic. I used Chardonnay a splash more, about 1/3 cup. I used jarred garlic in olive oil from California.  
Served with noodles and Italian style beef roast.  My husband is swooning, lucky me!

We thought this was OK. I reduced the balsamic vinegar and wine a bit. After the cooking was done, it just didn't look very appealing. Tasted better than it looked.

I would say it was average....had a little bit of a tangy taste.  Maybe it was the wine I used.  I would try it again, but maybe add some different seasonings.  Like an Italian blend...
