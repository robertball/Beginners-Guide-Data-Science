Absolutely delicious! After cutting into 3/4" cubes, I tossed with olive oil, chopped rosemary, a little balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. Roasting at 425 took much longer than the 10-20 minutes from the recipe - more like 35. Not only delicious, the intense ruby red color makes it a beautiful side dish.

I love roasting beets when you can get the all the beautiful varieties at the farmer's market. I used some deep red and pretty golden yellow beets. I skipped the whole mixing bowl part and just used 2 sheets of heavy duty foil - keeping the different colored beets separate. I drizzled the olive oil, thyme, and salt right onto the beet wedges and then enclosed the beets into foil packets, placed on a baking sheet and popped them in the oven. I rated only 4 stars because of the method.  I prefer to quarter the beets and roast them for longer (about an hour) instead of cubing them.  This way after they cool you can slice them for salads or cube them if desired.  Fantastic served with greens, goat cheese, toasted walnuts, and balsamic dressing.

I read somewhere that you just had to scrub the beets and no peeling required.  I did not want to turn on the oven so I cooked them on the grill in a tin roasting pan covered with foil for about 20 minutes. They got a little char on the bottoms but we ate them skin and all. They were delicious!

My husband loves beets. I do not like beets. I do, however, love my husband. I love him more than I dislike beets. So, I tried this recipe. He loved them. I have to say, I did not hate them. While it didn't convert me to a beet lover, it did make me (at least for tonight) a beet eater. :) Thanks for sharing!

Instead of Thyme, I used grated orange peel.  It was delicious.  I hate having to handle the beets so I wore latex gloves.  I can see myself roasting the beets with Winter squash or sweet potatoes.  This is so earty and basic.  I just ate them as the entire meal with some browned butter on top.  You can do things like that when you live alone...no husband asking where is the meat? Just beets and some crusty bread.

Yummy! Got some beets in a CSA and didn't know what to do with them.  This was so simple and converted a whole family who had never had/didn't like beets.  We just quartered them, because ours were so small.  The MAIN thing is that we LEFT THE SKINS ON.... and they were GOOD!  The skin added a crunchy texture; it was a lot like a potato skin.  I will definitely keep doing them this way.  I might experiment with the seasonings just for fun, but the thyme + sea salt was very good.

My 2 1/2 yr. old loves these things! I was a little leery about using thyme after reading the reviews so I cut the amount in half and you couldn't even taste it,just gave a nice flavor to the beets. I also bake mine for 30 min. in a 400 degree oven so my fire alarm doesn't go off:)Just a note: make sure you allow one large beet or two small ones per person or you won't have enough. They usually reduce about a quarter to a third in size.

I added aged balsamic vinegar, and a tiny piece of butter on each 1/8" slice.  Had to roast for full 20 minutes.  Added crumbled Gorgonzola cheese to the top.  OMG, so delicious!

I substituted dried basil instead of using thyme....the whole family loved it. Most members had never had beets aside from pickled beets, I believe I've converted them all this thanksgiving.

What a very simple, easy, and delicious way to Roast (a Big Bunch) of my Fresh Beets (from my Winter CSA).  I wore Neo-prene Gloves, seriously some of you complained about the Red Beet Juice in your Comments, to handle, peel and chop them.  I also used Blood Orange Fused Olive Oil and the Dried Thyme (it didn't take much to Toss around the Beets).  I cooked them for 25 minutes, please remember that when someone writes a Recipe (and gives you a cooking time) you are suppose to start checking them at 10 minutes and they could take 20 minutes (or longer) to cook based on your Oven (and how small you make your cubes).

I thought the thyme was a big mistake, so even though this recipe would work without it, the recipe as it stands isn't very good.

I omitted the thyme (purely because I forgot about it), roasted for about 20 minutes and these were wonderful!  I have had beets but haven't cooked them before, and will definitely use this recipe again next time I am cooking beets.

I boiled the beets for 8 minutes before cutting them into cubes to make the cooking time faster. From past experience I had to cook the beets in the oven 40-45 minutes. I also used fresh thyme.

I cook a lot with beets as I am originally from Russia/Ukraine. Beets take long time to bake and 10-20 min is not enough for them. Of course it also depends what variety of beets you use. Small size red beets are harder and take very long time to bake up to 1 hour, big size red sugar beets are softer and sweeter, they might take from 30 min to 45 min, also depends how thick you cut them.  Try using dry basil, dry dill and dry garlic. Beets love garlic....;)  Bake them in NuWave jet oven and beets will cook much faster, plus they will bake on both sides, without any turning and will be more crispy. Yummmmm.

I was already a fan of roasted beets, but had never made them myself. They came out deliciously, but I felt like something was missing. Couldn't quite place it. It's still very good and I'll make them again. For those commenting about the cook time, I think it will depend on a)the age of the beet and b) the size of the squares. I made mine into very small squares and it was cooked in 25 minutes.

I  modified the recipe a bit.  I used even amounts of a sweet potatoes and beets.  I know a lot of people stated they didn't like the thyme, but with the addition of the potatoes it was excellent.  My skeptical husband really liked them.  I will definitely be making again.

Basically I followed the recipe provided but used more beets  - so glad I did because this is delicious!  The roasting - which took about 30 minutes in a preheated oven - brings out the sweetness of the beets - it's like a whole new vegetable.  Thanks for the recipe.

I needed a quick way to roast beets for a salad and this was it.  I used basil instead of thyme because of the abundance of that herb in my garden.  Next time I'll try another one.  I tossed the beets with lettuce, fresh feta, and a handful of walnuts.  I also used some of them for a snack!

Added basil and minimized thyme. Cut in slices like photo not chunks and cooks quicker.

This was a hit with my family. My teen daughter really liked them and that's a huge success. I cut the slices fairly thin instead of cubes. Followed the recipe as well as adding a bit of red wine vinegar. Once cooked I mixed in some fresh chopped parsley and crumbled feta cheese. My daughter ate the beets and left the rest. Hubby and I loved it all. Will make again for sure.

Prefer mine sliced VERY thin, tossed with just a touch of olive oil, chopped fresh rosemary, S&P.  Convection roast on 375 for about 17 minutes.  They are Beet Chips and are amazing by themselves, in salads, and would be great with a little cheese thrown on at end to melt in.  Beets are GREAT for high blood pressure, so eat up!!

This is my new comfort food! The beets came in my monthly Farm Fresh Box delivery and I'm so glad I learned of them. We loved the earthy tones of this dish. I used avocado oil instead of  olive oil.  This was a lovely side for the Basil-Garlic Grilled Pork Chops also found on Allrecipes. A nice addition would be to sprinkle with Feta before serving.

Fantastic recipe for beets.  We used red beets and just sliced them, about 1/4 in thick, no peeling, just a good wash.  All the kids gobbled them up and waned to know when we were having more.

5.27.18  The first time I had roasted gold beets was in Portland, Oregon many years ago.  After one bite,  my husband who was a beet hater, turned into a gold beet lover.  Gold beets always were a hard thing to find in the Tampa Bay area for a long time, but that’s not the case any more.  Yes, they’re still expensive, but worth every penny.  I had four smallish beets, and the only change I’ll make in the future is to reduce the oil to 1 Tbsp because they were a bit on the oily side.  I sliced the beets with my mandolin (was easier than cubing), and they were perfectly cooked, and super sweet in 12 minutes.  I can see these beets making another appearance at the dinner table very soon.

Wow, what a great way to make beets! I followed the recipe as written the only difference was it’s 20+ minutes of cooking. Very easy cleanup! This is a keeper.

I added leftover veggies from the fridge (1 carrot, 1 sweet potato, and some corn), and sprinkled it with rosemary and basil. Oh, and I sauteed them in pumpkin seed oil, which gave them a wonderful flavor. Will make it again for sure!

Made with coconut oil and mixed with cubed butternut squash. I didn't measure the Thyme but just sprinkled enough to coat all the veggies evenly. My family LOVED this! And it's so healthy to boot. The Thyme is anti-inflammatory and with coconut oil, low-histamine friendly. Very tasty.

Hubs said five stars and I thought three so four it is. I had fresh thyme so I went with that, otherwise I made exactly as written.  I found the timing off, mine took closer to 30 minutes. After tasting the cooked beets I added a balsamic reduction and called it a warm beet salad. I will probably make this again but a much lower temp.

This was delicious and oh so simple!!! 
I used both golden beets and ruby red beets.  I chose to slice mine rather than dice.  I skipped the thyme and replaced it with ground black pepper.  Baked at 425 for 30 minutes. MMMMMM!

I cut my dice to a true 3/4" as listed and it took nearly an hour at 425 and they got scorched on one side. They were getting softer on the outside in the high heat but were still hard just under the outside.

Recently discovered I love beets, so this was my first time cooking them. The only olive oil we have at home right now is lemon infused, so I used that. Also chopped up several sprigs of fresh rosemary. So good! I know I'll do it again. Had no idea it was so easy.

Loved this recipe! I wasn't sure how to even start making beets but this was a great starter recipe! Quick, easy, and delicious. I added fresh mushrooms to the mix and tossed it with the thyme, sea salt, and added pepper and a tiny bit of chopped onions. It was awesome!! Thanks for sharing

I like this recipe quite a lot, I tossed my beets in some canola oil (I was out of olive so I substituted) and put in about 1/2 tsp. of rosemary and 1/2 tsp. of ground thyme along with a sprinkling of salt.  I put them in the oven at 400 degrees and baked them for 45 minutes.  Tasted great.

This recipe inspired me to stay from my usual roasting method - wrapping whole in foil with oil and herbs. I cut the beets into 1 - 1 1/2 in. pieces, tossed them with herbs de pro and, blood orange infused evoo and salt. Roasted them at 400 for 30 min then at 425 for 5 min to get the extra crust. They turned out great! I have leftover horseradish dipping sauce from yesterday's roasted artichokes so I will try my beets with that as well :)

It's so easy and quick.  I put it atop a bed of quinoa with curried vegetables and added the  greens on the side.  Delicious!

I substituted butter for the oil to get the whole family to try it. It turned out delicious. I was still the only one who liked it but my family is hard to get to like beets. I have no doubt that this would taste delicious using olive oil too. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was my first attempt at beets. They came out great. They are not something I would crave but I would not turn them down either. Great simple recipe!

Very easy recipe and mild flavoring that doesn't take away from the beet.

I enjoyed this tasty dish using rosemary instead of thyme (as I had none).  Unfortunately, I remain the only beet fan in my household.  
This will have to be added to my "lunch alone" rotation along with my beloved roasted parsnips.

I never knew beets were so delectable! I'm trying to add variety and consumption of vegetables. I didn't have thyme, so I just sprinkled some red beets with sea salt. I also used safflower oil. This was super easy, delicious, and since beets usually come with their greens still attached, I'll have two vegetable dishes.
