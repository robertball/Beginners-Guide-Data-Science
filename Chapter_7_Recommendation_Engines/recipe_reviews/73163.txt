I don't know about it being southern, but with a couple changes it was great.  I didn't do the bread and cheese part, I just served it as soup.  I added a little worchestershire sauce and some garlic powder for flavor, and that instantly made a huge difference.  I chopped portobello mushrooms into good sized pieces and the flavor was delicious.  I'll definitely make again.  It's hard to believe that this was so quick.

Great recipe,but I found it better to fry the mushrooms in the butter,then add the flour to make a roux,and then add other liquids.Frying the mushrooms brings out more of the flavour than just boiling it,apart from that? Faultless.

I used the same ingredients - just in a slightly different order: I sauted the mushrooms, onions (and some garlic) in the butter.  I then added the broth, cream and milk (reserving a few TBLS to mix with the flour).  Brought to a boil and then added the flour/milk mix to thicken - reducing the heat and stirring well.  Once ready to serve - I added some cooked crumbled bacon and sprinkled some cheese over each bowl.  Served with french bread on the side.  Awesome and easy meal with simple ingrediants.  A keeper recipe for sure!!

Super good mushroom soup! I didn't add the bread or cheese because the soup was really good on it's own. My daughter thought she wouldn't like fresh mushroom soup but we gobbled it up in one day! We had canned mushroom soup the next day and she realized how much better the fresh mushroom soup had been. The whole family asked for it again.

DITTO to Quilterfan! This was just packed full of deeeelicious flavor!  Amazing for how fast, and easy it was to prepare! I used fat free half and half in place of the heavy cream, my milk was 2%, and I added about 1 cup extra mushrooms. I toasted French bread slices, and it was pure "soul food" when served. This soup is fit for any occasion from fancy frills to down home relaxing! About the only warning I'll give you is to DOUBLE THIS RECIPE! My daughter and I inhaled all 4 servings..rotf!  Thanks for sharing this one SouthernGirl3!!

This was great!  My fav mushroom soup I've tried so far.  I added 3 cups of mushrooms and rough chopped half of them and used the food processor for the rest.

This is a really good soup. I doubled the recipe so we had enough for 2 days.  I sauteed the onions and mushrooms and also I added 4 garlic cloves to them. Then I added the chicken broth and followed the recipe from there. We ate it with some french bread toasted in the oven and it was delicious.

This soup is absolute delicious, smooth and creamy.  The only change I made was to add just a tiny trace of freshly ground nutmeg.  Thank you for sharing this great dish.  It is a keeper which I will definitely plan on making again.

Rich, satisfying and comforting!  This soup is really quite good and simple enough to make.  I did add three small chopped shallots in place of regular onions and slightly sauted them with the mushrooms before adding the chicken stock, but other than that, I followed the recipe and I thought it was really good. I am curious though about the "Southern" part.  Maybe the buttered toast and cheese on top makes it Southern?  In any case, it's for sure worth trying at least once!  Thanks for sharing!

it's a good basic recipe, I made it like the recipe said and found it ok. I made it againbut this time i used beef broth instead of chicken broth, added 1/2 tsp. of ground cummin, 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, 1 bay leaf, and 2 Tbl. of worchester sauce. i think these changes really improved this soup

I took the advice to saute the vegetables with garlic and made the double batch. This is a wonderful tasting soup! I would use it for my 'cooking with' soup too (simmering my meats in this soup) so I'll keep extra on hand! I do think the chicken broth made it a little chickeny - I'll use beef stock next time.

This was the greatest Mushroom soup I've ever had.  I made it to put in a "gourmet" tuna casserole.  It was so good I almost didn't want to put it in the casserole just so I could eat it by itself.  I ended up cutting just a little out of the casserole so I could enjoy the soup in it's entirety.

Fabulous!!!  I made a few teaks simply because I like to do that and I didn't have chicken broth, so I used half and half instead of the other liquids, added 3 tbsp of powdered chicken bouillon, and white wine.  This was by FAR the very best mushroom soup I have tasted in my life and my husband would agree.  I will use this recipe again and recommend to others!  I am sure it would be equally as good without any changes.

This was really good soup and so easy to prepare.  I followed the recommendations of "dreginek" though added about a half cup of extra mushrooms and included two tablespoons of minced garlic.  I served it with crusty bread.  Very good!

Used half white and half shitake mushrooms, little more than two cups.  Sauteed onions for a couple of minutes, then added mushrooms, then added two cloves of pressed garlic at the end.  Added about 1/4 C. of whole-wheat flour to absorb the butter. Stir and cook for a couple of minutes.  Added 2 C. water with chicken bouillon.  Stir and let thicken some.  Added 2 C. fat-free half and half  Stir and let thicken until you like the consistency.   Add salt and pepper. (It will need it.)  I served it with toasted pita bread.  YUM.

I made this soup last night - it wasn't quite what I was looking for, but my husband loved it. I took some of the advice and sauteed the mushrooms, onions and garlic beforehand. It turned out alright, it just wasn't the really creamy soup I had been craving. It was really salty, even though I didn't add any as the recipe suggested. That being sad, it was still better than some of the mushroom soup I've been served in restruants!

This is the first time I had ever made homemade cream of mushroom soup. This is how I changed the preparation - I saute'd the chopped onions and mushrooms and  then added the milk and chicken stock.  This recipe will be shared with all my family and friends.  YUM

My husband couldn't believe I made it!!  I did not make the toast or add cheese, just out of laziness.  It was great!

this recipe is fantastic, it's easy for anyone to make. It's my first ever soup i've made and it was very delicious! The only thing i did differently was to add garlic. Didn't have the toast as used fresh mushrooms from the field and they were very meaty. Would recomend this recipe for beginners!

We loved this soup.  I added a small amount of finely chopped carrots and celery and it was luscious!

i like this recipe and i have used it couple of time now.  my kids like it so much the i put left overs on the stove and had to do something before heating it up.  My daughter told me she heated it up and a few minutes later I went into the kitchen to help myself to a bowl of soup and the pot was in the sink, EMPTY! I had made a double batch because the first time I made it wasn't enough.  Guess I will try and triple it next time.

This is a great recipe! I did not use the bread or cheese and added slices of carrots. I used garlic salt and garlic powder towards the end, with a few hints of cayenne pepper. I didn't have heavy cream and the soup was VERY thin. By all means use the heavy cream!

I changed a couple of times (don't worry, I kept all the ingredients the same, sans the bread/cheese part). I saute the onion/mushroom instead. Made a roux using the butter/flour, didn't let it simmer for 15 minutes, just added a little cornstarch to help it thicken. Than I added in the milk and cream [I substituted evaporated milk though] and let it cook for 5 minutes on low heat. Nice and simple :D

We had a pint of mushrooms we needed to use or lose, so I tried this recipe.  I thought this was very good, quick and easy.  We happened to have every ingredient on hand too, which saved us another trip to the store.  I ate it again the next day without any bread and a hearty helping of grated cheddar.  It was a great lunch at work!  I might even like it better without the bread, so consider it optional IMHO.

********** 10 STARS! All the ingredients blend together extremely well. The only thing I did differently was using Half and Half instead of heavy cream like another poster. I swear my husband finished his bowl in 1 minute. It's simple to make with a flavor that makes it seem like you've been making it all day. I think next time we'll use more mushrooms, just because we love them and try french bread like the other poster. Absolutely yummy! Recommend everyone thinking about making this recipe to do it! You won't be disappointed. One more thing, this was the first time seeing a dish like this (with the bread I mean). Already planning to take it to the in-laws.

I followed other reviewers' suggestion to fry the mushrooms and onions to bring out more flavor.  I adjusted the seasonings after doubling the recipe.  I added 2 Tbl. Worstershire sauce, a liberal hand with dry beef bouillon, and a bit of chicken bouillon, too.  A sprinkle of onion powder and a few shakes of the parsley bottle.  Yummy!  Will make again.

I was looking for a recipe to resemble the Mushroom Soup we used to order when we lived in Westland, Michigan. Well, I finally found it. How delicious. I used a comment I found on another cooks rate it comment, and sauteed the mushrooms and onions first before adding the other ingredients. I also added a splash of white wine which was also suggested. Perfection! My husband was so happy to enjoy this soup again.

OMG!  I have been trying mushroom soup recipes and this is the first that gave that perfect flavour.  I read the reviews first, and started by sauteeing the onion and 3 garlic cloves in the butter, adding the flour (to avoid lumps later).  I also substituted for veggie broth (personal preference).  Kept all else the same, without adding cheese.  The soup is superb!

I looked through the reviews and pulled ideas from several. I added Worcestershire and fresh garlic and bacon. I had smoked turkey stock left from my Thanksgiving turkey and used it. My husband said he didn't think he disserved such a great soup. Enough said.

This was yummy and a big hit with the family.  I sautéed the mushrooms with butter and a splash of wine and passed on the bread crumbs.  Can't really fathom what they would have added to this delicious soup.  I will definitely keep this in my recipe rotation - especially now that's officially autumn again.  I think next time I will use a couple of different types of mushrooms to add layers of flavor.  You know you've got a winner when you're asked, "why don't you make that mushroom soup again".  Enjoy!

This is perfect mushroom soup. I've been looking for a good recipe to use instead of the canned glop.  Preparation is very simple and quick.  The only substitution was to use 1 cup fat free milk and 1 cup half-n-half for the milk and cream in the recipe.  It came out creamy and smooth.  I also used white pepper instead of black.

It was pretty good but I forgotten the milk! No wonder something is missing :) I didnt follow the exact method but sauté the mushroom and onions with butter first. I even added some garlic before adding in the liquid and flour last. Prefer it to be thicker and creamier. Any tips? 
Oh yeah...I did add pastry puff on top and bake it as well.

This was so awesome I even surprised myself. As per another review, I also used garlic powder and worchestshire sauce, which I believe is the key ingredient. I cooked the onion first before simmering in the broth. Since my husband wasn't ready for dinner yet, I think I cooked it a lot longer than sugested but I kept tasting it as I waited and it seemed to get better the longer I cooked it. I didn't put the bread and cheese on top but I did add shredded/cooked sausage links but I'm sure it's just as good without it.

Easy and delicious!!

I did without the bread but just added croutons and shredded cheese to each individual bowl of soup!

Very lovely and easy to make!
