I'm giving it five stars even though I had to alter it slightly to use what I had on hand. The change was minor - I prepared as listed, subbing a can of RoTel for green chilies - and then transferred to a 9x13 baking dish, topped with cheese  and baked at 350 until the cheese bubbled (as suggested). I'm glad I took a chance on this simple little one review dish!

It was a little greasy; would cut the olive oil to 1T next time. To jazz it up a little, added a small, diced red onion to the sausage and potatos, then added a chopped green pepper, a crushed clove of garlic, subbing a diced jalepeno for the chiles, plus about a half cup of frozen corn.  One cup of cheese was just right to finish it off.  Really good meal.

Nice and easy dinner that went over great with the kids.  I doubled the recipe with the exception of the green chilies.  I was a afraid they would be overpowering, but at half what was called for, they were't all that noticeable.  Next time I will use more.  I baked it in the oven, so I could "fix it and forget it."  I took about 45 minutes for the potatoes to get tender (but, keep in mind I doubled the recipe).

I love how simple the recipes is. I slices red potatoes with the skin, added garlic, green pepper slices, red onion and only one can of green chilis. I also used Johnsonville Irish O'garlic sausage.

My kids loved. Ate all plus seconds. I added a bit of red peper flakes to my plate to give it a bit of a kick. I loved it. Easy way to eat healthy and delicious!

My family of 6 loves this dish!  It is quick, easy, uses few ingredients, and provides an option to get out of our chicken-beef-chicken rut!

Really yummy, but I omitted the oil, since the sausage produces it's own oil, it seems to be enough. Super easy!  Very filling!

Very Greasy!  Maybe it was the green chilis I used but they whole casserole had an odd taste.  I like the smoked beef sausage but even that  didn't taste good.
