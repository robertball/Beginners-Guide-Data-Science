The marinade is really good,  You can cut up the tenderloin into kabob sizes and marinate in the frig for about two hours.  Put on bamboo skewers with veggies of your choice and turn as needed on a medium temp grill. It should take about 20 minutes--160 on the center piece of the pork on the kabob.

AWESOME!  Just made this grilled pork recipe last week and am making it again today for the family. We all liked it even our youngest 1.5 yr old. I used pork Chops, and left out the honey. It was still great! There was 1 pork chop left over and my hubby claimed it for in his lunch the next day. Thank you for a super great recipe. We will definitely be making this again!

Delicious marinade with a wonderful Asian flair! I cut the recipe in half and used low sodium soy sauce, 1/4 tsp. of powdered ginger along with one Tbsp. of sesame oil.  I used this on thick cut pork chops that I pierced with a fork and put into a ziploc bag along with the marinade.  I let everything go overnight - didn't bother reserving marinade for basting as the flavor really came through due to the long marinade time.  Overall, very tasty!

Awesome mixture of flavors! I assisted my ten year old with making this as her first real attempt at cooking and man were we blown away! The combo of the cinnamon and cayenne pepper was dead on for pork. Our only change was the cooking method, we oven baked the tenderloin and glazed it with the sauce. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!

This is so easy & good - nice Japanese style pork.  Use a thin teriyaki sauce, like Kikkoman; not the thick ones like Yoshida.  Then the other flavors come out.  Marinated over nite & was very moist.  Not sure about the cooking method?  I ended up alternating closing/opening bbq lid - cooked close to 30 minutes??  Excellent!

This was the BEST pork tenderloin I have EVER tasted!!!!!!! I only had 5 hours so I cut a 4 lb roast into 1 inch thick chops and marinated in double amount of marinade.

This recipe is fine, but not any more special than a bottled teriyaki marinade, in my opinion.  We did not care too much for the cinnamon.

Amazing flavor in this marinade!  I adjusted a few things right away.  I don't like pre-made teriyaki sauces, so I used a little extra soy sauce ( 1/2 cup) and brown sugar (5 tbsp), and 1/5 cup of heavy pineapple.  I also do not like garlic cloves, so I just left that out.  I don't like to grill, so I bake it wrapped in foil and basting regularly at 375 degrees F.  I made this recipe for 3 grown men, who devoured it without hardly saying a word besides "Mmmm".

This was incredible!  I only made one tenderloin since there were just three of us at home tonight.  Followed the recipe to a t otherwise.  It did take a little longer than directed to grill but I figured it would vary based on meat weight and grill temperature.  I really liked the cinnamon in this recipe, thought it gave it a unique flavor.  Will definately make again!

The only thing that I didn't add were the Ginger Root and the ground cinnamon (I just don't like either :-) and the recipe still tured out really yummy! I'll definitly make it again.

Just made this and it was awesome!  I can't believe how tender and juicy they were.  I didn't have any ginger but stilled tasted awesome.  I did marinate the full 8 hours which I would recommend. Thank You!!!

YUM! The entire family loved this pork recipe. We also used the marinade to baste zucchini slices that we then grilled, as well. My only problem was getting the heat right with my grill. It started way too hot, and was burning the sugary marinade to a blackened crisp!

Really good.  Kids ended up not having dinner that night so only prepared one of the tenderloins.  On the second night (the well-marinated) other tenderloin morphed into pork stir fry.  Chopped into bite size pieces, and lightly, very lightly coated with flour before cooking in a TBSP oil.  Added a little siracha sauce and brown sugar to the orignal sauce, browned the pork really well, and stirred in the  sauce.  Simmered for 10 minutes.  Garnish with sesame seeds and cilantro.  Serve with rice.

This is very easy. The meat turned out tender. Just seems to need something else. I would recommend giving this a try, but we like some other tenderloin recipes better.

Served this last night and it was a hit.  The pork was tender and the sauce was great.  Easy recipe to use, if you cant marinate overnight a half hour in the freezer works.

This was a very simple and very tasty recipe. We have made it several times and followed the recipe to the letter. Every time it came out great. My only advice is to make sure you get a good pork tender-loin.

I love this recipe. I haven't had teriyaki sauce on hand so have just used the soy and it is very good. I own a Traeger grill and use it to grill the pork - I also use a temperature probe so I know when it hits 145. One of the only ways I have found to grill pork without it turning into pork jerky - everyone eats it up!

The best marinade for pork I've ever had!  I did not add the teriaki sauce as suggested.

These looked gorgeous, but we were very disapointed in the taste.  Something very odd about it.  Don't know which ingredient caused it, but we didn't care for it.  Sorry.

I made a scaled version of this for two boneless pork loin chops.  EXCELLENT!  The marinade is a snap to put together and uses ingredients I always keep on hand.  What I liked in particular about the marinade is that it had some body to it and wasn’t too thin, which resulted in nice “cling” when basting the chops.  Easy and flavorful, which is right up my alley!  Thank you Betsy Carrington!

Loved this!  Lots of compliments.  I took a pork loin and sliced into thin steaks and then cut those into tenders and marinated them overnight.  I then threaded snake like on a skewer and grilled them (they grill very fast!).  Served once with a fresh pineapple salsa and another time with a coconut rice.  A new favorite grilling recipe!

I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter and let it marinate overnight in the fridge. The flavor was really great, especially with using some mesquite chips on the grill. I'll make it again soon!

Great recipe!  I used the honey, teriyaki sauce and the rest of the ingredients(used ground ginger in place of fresh), omitting soy sauce and brown sugar and it was sweet enough without adding the brown sugar.   Mmmmmm.  Yummy!  I cooked the pork tenderloin til almost done then started brushing the meat with leftover sauce(sauce that I had reserved and not from the marinade).  I will make this again.  Thank you.

Excellent!  I only had 2 hours to marinade the pork so I cut the tenderloin into 1 1/2" cubes and marinaded them in a bowl.  I added some hoisin sauce to the mixture for a little more flavor and cut the soy sauce in half.  I put the pork on skewers with a chunk of pineapple between each piece and cooked on my charcoal grill along with some vegetable kabobs and served with Parmesan couscous.  My wife and two kids loved this!  Our new pork favorite!

Very good and very easy to prepare.  My whole family enjoyed these grilled pork tenderloins.  I did boil the leftover marinade and served as a sauce to go with them.  I served them with the Confetti Rice from this site.

This was good, but I don't think I measured carefully enough - there was a bit too much of a cinnamon taste.  I will try it again though and update my review then!

Excellent!  I only marinated it for about 4 hours and it was still very moist and flavorful.

This was delicious! I didn't have any terryaki sauce but I don't think you'd really need it. We invited neighbors for dinner and they just loved it. I sent a copy of the recipe home with them. They said they had never had pork loin before & were defiantly going to make this. Thanks for a great recipe.

Exceptional Recipe.  I was surprised that is really did not have a strong asian flavor to it as I thought it would.  Just tangy, a little sweet and very moist.

I tried this recipe out on my family and it was a huge hit.  We have never had pork loin on the grill so tender and juicy, not to mention delicious. I'm planning a luau for 60 and this is definitely on the menu!

this is the best! I did make a change for my husband who cant have sugar - I left out the brown sugar and teriyaki sauce -- and this was still great! we had pork left over and a little bit of sauce so i cut up the leftovers and  put them in the sauce to soak up even more of the wonderful taste -- had it the next day on a sandwich and it was great again. We will make this again!!!!!
