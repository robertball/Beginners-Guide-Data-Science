Very easy and great recipe.  A little bit spicy so next time I'll use 1/2 tablespoon of pepper.

This was quick and easy to make. I used canned chicken instead of tuna and a blend of cheddar cheese and mozzarella and it was excellent, everyone loved it.   It is very spicy but we love spicy food.  If you don't like a lot of black pepper you should cut the amount in half.

This is a QUICK recipe for nights when you don't feel like cooking! My husband loved it. I left out the peppers since I didn't have any, but it was still delicious and creamy.

It was great ,but like the other review said it was spicy. I also added more cheese... but I really thought that the taste had too much going on.

Very goos recipe, I used half the pepper and added some garlic. I did not have green peppers so I just used a 1/2 cup of onions. I also mixed some cheese in with the tuna. I used half the liquid and the same the same amount of meat and it came out Delicious and rich :-)

My husband's favorite meal is tuna casserole (I don't like it) so he tried this and gave it 3 stars.  I cut back on the salt and pepper (because 1 tbsp. seemed like a lot) and he still commented that it was too spicy.  My son tried it and then had leftovers from the other night.  With the exception of cutting back on the salt/pepper, I made the recipe as printed.  I will go back to using my regular recipe for tuna casserole.

Yummy!  I used a bit too much pepper and replaced the green peppers with peas.  Good switch.

We caught a Yellow Fin and had a pound leftover  after the first cooking.  We decided to make a casserole but didn't have a recipe.  We found this one and added on to it. It came out better than expected!
I made a few changes that turned out good:
*  I used 1 cup of nonfat milk and 1/2 cup regular milk because that was what I had on hand.
* I cut the salt and pepper by half and added about 1 1/2 teaspoon of Bay Seasoning and about a teaspoon of dried onion flakes.
*  I mixed all the cheese (the 1 1/2 cups in the recipe) into the casserole instead of spreading it on top.
*  A few minutes prior to taking it out of the oven, I sprinkled  an extra handful of shredded Monterrey Jack Cheese  on top.  I also melted about 1/4 cup butter and mixed in Panco Bread Crumbs seasoned with garlic flakes. I sprinkled this over the top and baked about 5-7 minutes longer until the crumb topping started to get golden brown.
My husband initially told me he probably wouldn't eat the fish casserole, but it turned out so good that he tried it and liked it.
Everyone ate it, even the picky eaters!

It's really very good but watch the pepper! It calls for a tablespoon and I used only a half tablespoon. Still pretty strong. Maybe it is supposed to be a teaspoon! I would make it again!

Family thought it was a good dinner and everyone finished their plates. The only problem is the recipe calls for entirely too much pepper and a little heavy on the salt, too. I recognized this immediately and only put in 1/2 T. pepper and 2 tsp. salt, yet that seemed a tad much, as well. I salt my pasta water well and didn't feel the need to really add more salt later, and I wouldn't go more than 1 tsp. pepper, maybe even a smidge less. We have made this more than once and will keep it in the rotation for a quick and easy home cooked meal.

Quick and easy! Loved this recipe and so did my family. No one likes tuna  buy myself and I was craving a tuna casserole...but gave in to chicken and this did the trick. As usual, I didn't have all the recommended ingredients but I followed the directions substituting Chicken for Tuna, green chilies for bell pepper... left everything else the same...will definitely make it again!
