I made these and immediately froze them (wrapped in wax paper and then put in freezer bag). I pulled them out, left them in the fridge overnight to defrost and then heated them in the over at 250 for about 35 minutes. They were great. Didn't taste like they had been frozen at all.

This is a great recipe.  I fixed it for dinner instead of lunches. I used sundried tomato & basil tortillas.  They turned out delicious!  And it's very fast too.  This is a keeper for me.  Thanks! :)

We made these and thought they were wonderful! I used a can of diced tomatoes & green chilis (drained) instead of salsa, and added a small can of corn, and some sour cream. They were so delicious and super easy to make. My husband wanted to eat the mixture right out of the pan! Definately a good break from meat now and then.

I've been making these basic burritos for a long time (except w/rice too), and they are always good! Also good w/cheddar, and sometimes I add 1/2 can of corn OR 1/2 can or white beans.

This is a good bag lunch recipe... easy, healthy, tasty, filling... just what I am always looking for. And it can be easily adjusted to your taste.  I filled my tortillas full, so it only made 3 for me (!), and I also added fresh spinach leaves and cut back on the cheese, eating these cold for lunch.  The quality of these would depend largely on the quality of your salsa, and you could also perk them up with your faves (extra veggies, lettuce, tomato, cilantro... I'll be trying some variations).

These were good! I made them exactly as directed, but I found I only had enough for about 5 burritos. I think I used tortillas a little larger than called for. definitely good stuff, and just spicy enough (i used medium, chunky salsa). i added finely chopped onions, both to the bean mix as it cooked and to the final product. I recommend adding whatever veggies you have around too; I made them again last night and added some black-eyed peas and corn that I had leftover, and they were even better!

People don't believe me when I tell them how easy it is to make these.  Pace Medium Picante Sauce is my favorite salsa to use for this.  If you have any leftover chicken it's also really good shredded on top of this.

Awesome!  We made these tonight for the first time, and it took hardly any time at all before dinner was ready.  I made mine with spinach herb tortillas, and my husband used regular ones.  Instead of making several small burritos, we each made a large one, and they were fantastic!  We used organic, fat free black beans and El Paso Garden Peppers salsa (although that gives the mixture a bit of a sweet taste).  We also added low fat sour cream to the mixture to make it creamier and used plenty of cheese.  The result was a wonderful mixture of flavors that we have officially deemed better than our favorite local hip burrito cafe that we're always raving about.  Thanks for such a great time-saving and healthy recipe!

I'm always looking for new recipes using beans. These are quick, easy, healthy, and delicious. Use whole wheat tortillas and reduced fat cheese to make it healthier.

brilliant! great for quick dinners. Not great for my kids who aren't into spicy but me and my husband lvoed them. I substituted in hotsauce instead of chili powder (I was out of c.p!) but you can't really go wrong woth these if you like spicy food

This was great for a quick lunch idea when I had a pot full of beans and no new ideas.  Can't wait to try it out for school lunches, thanks!
update:
tried it out for lunch.  And it came out really nasty.  The wrap fell apart and the whole thing ended up as a soggy warm mess.  It seems like a good idea though if you can keep it nice and cold and not rip the tortilla

Thank goodness I doubled the recipe because we loved these! I used a medium salsa, whole wheat tortillas, added a dab of sour cream to each burrito, and used extra sharp cheddar cheese in place of the Monterey Jack.  My daughter requested I make these again before she had even finished her first burrito.

Unbelievably simple, and fantastic!!  I used a medium chunky salsa and had some rice on the side.  My husband wanted a little bit of meat with his so I seasoned some ground beef with taco seasoning for him.  It ended up being a burrito bar with each of us choosing our own filling.  We even topped some with enchilada sauce and cheese and heated in the microwave.  Great recipe - just what we've been looking for!!  Thank you!

Absolutely great! Can't wait to mix it up and try it with different salsas. I added seasoning each day to mix up the flavors, and I like the idea of adding a can of corn. May add some peppers and other fresh veggies as well.

These were delicious and quick. I made my own salsa ahead of time which I think added a lot to the burritos. I also cooked some frozen corn in the microwave and dumped it into the bean mixture a minute or two before serving.

I made these burritos for dinner for our family of 7. I quadrupled the recipe because of the previous comments regarding the amount rendered. I also used two cans of corn and several plops of sour cream. The result was SO GOOD and at the end of the meal the pan was completely scraped clean! This will certainly be a repeat for us.

I cannot express how easy this recipe is! I've been searching for recipes that are simple to teach my hubby how to cook, and this recipe is both simple and delish! I took the advice of another poster and added rice to the mixture- to compensate for the added rice, I just added a touch more salsa, and water. Everything tasted wonderful! My hubby couldn't get over how good it tasted. This will definitely be a go-to recipe on busy nights!

My boyfriend will eat just about anything but RARELY asks for it again and AGAIN. He keeps asking for these. They are convenient because he works very late and loves to grab them straight from the fridge. I add sweet corn and extra chili every time at a minimum. They are GREAT!  Oh and I love them too ^_^

Quick, easy and tasty.  No leftovers with this recipe.  Lots of room for versatility too.  Next time I will experiment with adding other ingredients of like corn, perhaps some rice to balance grains and legumes.  I left out the chili because of the tastes of those I was serving.  Had lots of compliments and for such an easy recipe.

Quick and easy, and pretty tasty too.  Great for taking along for lunch.  I make it in advance then I re-heat the 'insides' in the microwave at work. I toss it on the shell with some cheese and I'm set!

These were good.  I expected them to be a little too salsa flavored, but they weren't.  I added a spoon full of sour cream to the mixture to moisten it up a little, and also put spanish rice and green onions in the burrito.   We didn't make any sides with it, but we ate it all between 2 of us, so 8 servings seems a little far fetched.

These turned out great!  I cheated a bit and used a slow cooker plus I added chicken & a can of corn.  I put nearly everything into the slow cooker before I went to work then put the mixture into tortillas when I got home and topped with cheese.  Yum!!!!

The salsa just gave this a weird flavor. Next time I will try using canned, diced tomatoes with the chili seasoning already in them. Way too much cumin & chili powder for my tastes.

I'm not big on hot-spicy food, so I cut the chili pepper down to 1 teaspoon and the burritos came out awesome. After assembling the burritos I brushed them with olive oil and baked them for 15 minutes at 400 degrees.  It was quick, easy, economical and a nice change from meat.  I'm going to try making a mini version to freeze for a filling snack option.

I wasn't very impressed by these.  I thought that the recipe called for too much salsa, which overpowered the taste of the beans and made them runny.

A good recipe.  Very easy provided you have everything you need in the house.  We don't usually keep salsa in the house, which means I have to run out to the store, but the actually cooking is very simple and fast.

Pretty good and really easy.  I usually use 2 - 3 cans of black beans and add more salsa/spices to taste.  I eat the bean mixture with whole wheat tortillas and a little cheese.  I would give this recipe about 3 1/2 - 4 stars based on taste alone but when ease and health are considered, my rating is 5 stars.

EASY AND DELISH! Two of my favorite words when cooking! I threw in a can of corn to stretch the recipe a little, otherwise I followed the recipe! We ate them warm with some shredded cheese and sour cream. My boyfriend ate them cold for lunch the next day and said they were great that way too! Thanks for the recipe! I will make this one again!

I made these as directed, but with double the cheese.  I liked them, as did my co-workers, but my SO who is from Mexico didn't care for them much, and I was so hopeful that they would work out better for his lunches!  The salsa I used was Santa Fe brand "Chunky Chunky Salsa" - Medium heat, which I thought had a great consistency for this recipe and was not runny at all.  I would most likely make them again for my own lunches or as an appetizer using 6" tortilla. Next time I will also lightly grill the tortilla for a less doughy or pasty consistency and cut back on the cumin because I felt it overpowered the other flavors.

I'm really excited about finding this recipe.  Talk about a quick, easy and good meal!  I didn't use the full amount of cumin and chili powder simply because I knew it would be too much for our taste.  You could vary this by using any number of different additions.

Instead of using salsa, I used a can of diced tomatoes. I also nixed the chili powder in exchange for a teaspoon of cayenne-yum!

I first saw this recipe years ago on this site and it has become a staple in my household.  I just adjust the spice level to the tastes of whomever I am serving it to.  And I always use chedder cheese, and usually serve it with a salad. Yummy!

I normally take a salad to lunch everyday, but that can get pretty boring after awhile.  I really enjoyed these for a change-up, and they were easy to make ahead of time.  If you like it spicy, throw a few jarred jalepenos in each burrito for a crispy texture and some heat.

It was alright. My husband and I didn't enjoy the black bean flavor so much. We found it too strong. Not the flavor we are used to. It was quick and easy though, so we may try using refried beans and hope for results that we like better.

Great recipe to make when short on time. I did add a small can of corn after mashing the beans. My six year old (who would tell you he does not care for beans) loved it. Made this for our weekly meatless dinner and it was a hit. There are three of us, and there were no leftovers.

I really like the simplicity of this recipe.  I made it on a lazy Sunday.  Added leftover taco meat, a can of chorizo flavored pinto beans, and garlic salt.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing.

I was down to my last bit of salsa, so used it up plus a can of chili ready diced tomatoes. My picky eater didn't like it, but everyone else gobbled it up. I served it with Mexican style grated cheese mix, chopped lettuce and sour cream. Thank you for the quick, easy and tasty recipe.

I often make a batch of these burritos and freeze them. Very tasty and filling. My husband loves the one-handed lunch while working and gets tired of sandwiches every day. Just pull them out of the freezer the night before and defrost in the fridge and you're done!

I like that these are a quick go to for a tasty afterschool snack.  They are easy to make.  Next time I'm going to add a can of corn and maybe some crushed red pepper for a little kick.

So simple, yet so delicious! I added sour cream, extra chili powder and cumin, corn, and taco sauce.  I also grilled the burritos on my george foreman to seal them up.  They were so easy to make, and I had all the ingredients on hand.  Whenever I get a tbell craving, I'll just make these instead!

I made this by the book the first time.  The second time, I added a can of pinto beans in addition to the black beans, which helped give it a better texture when mashed.  I also only used 1/4 cup of salsa plus some fresh onions. Just eh, but a good quick dinner.

Great recipe!  I didn't have chili powder so I used sofrito (2 tbsp) and added leftover meatballs from another dish. I also used an 8 ounce block of velvet cheese that I cubes up and melted into the mixture during the last 4 minutes. I warmed the tortillas While the filling cooked. It came out great! It was just my husband and I and we were full after two small burritos each. We have another whole meal of it to which I am going to add some white beans and hot sauce to, as suggested. I came home during my lunch break from classes to cook this and it was fast, easy, and delicious!   My husband loved it too!

Easy and delicious!  I added a small can of corn and used hot Margaritas salsa - I think next time I might use mild or medium, because with the cumin & chili powder as well it was a bit TOO spicy for me.

Definitely good lunch food.  Really easy and quick to make in the morning before work while the coffee is brewing.  I warmed it up in the microwave for 15 seconds and am definitely pleased with it.  I used pinto beans instead of black beans.  I just like them better.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  I wasn't big on the salsa/chili powder taste.  It seemed too overpowering.  I'd add some other stuff that I might like and sour cream.  I'd probably do less salsa next time. I haven't made this since the first time.

I am a vegetarian. But the rest of my family isn't; so I added cooked ground turkey, sour cream, diced avocados and used wheat tortillas. My family loved these. They asked me to make them again the following day for lunch.

This was my first attempt at any sort of burrito, but they were really good. I used the recipe as more of a base. The only thing I added was hamburger. I browned it first and added the cumin and chili powder. Then I added the beans and fresh salsa. Very yummy.

This recipe certainly is quick and healthy.  I did top it with sour cream because I had some in the fridge.  It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but has a nice kick (I used medium salsa).  I'm curious how it would be with made with chilli beans and omitting some or all of the spices.

I used Tostitos chunky Salsa and Bush's Black Beans.

The meal was easy and quick.  My 2.5 year old wouldn't eat it and we felt it was missing something.  It needs some more flavor.  I might try it again with some additions.

Quick and tasty. I added 1/2 a bag of frozen corn for taste and texture. I also warmed up the tortillas on a skillet until golden-brown to soften the tortillas up a bit. But great recipe overall. Definitely a keeper.

Very tasty and quick and easy.  It's great for my bean loving high schooler's lunches.  I pureed Pace Medium Picante to get rid of any chunky stuff and substitued Cheddar cheese which was what I had already shredded.

These were quite tasty.  They were very quick and are a great meal to throw together on a busy night.  To me, they are not "company worthy" which is why I didn't give it a five but for an on the fly meal they are great!

Great! Super-easy, and tasty. I threw in a bit of red onion and cayenne pepper as well, and topped the tortillas with sour cream and diced tomato as well.

As a single parent of a newborn, I am always looking for good tasting, healthy and quick meals because they are hard to find. This recipe takes the cake. The leftovers made wonderful work lunches. Thanks!

These were really good and very easy.  It makes a nice, healthy alternative to PBJ.  Do make sure to drain well.  I didn't do a good job and mine were really runny -- totally my own fault, not the recipe.

This was an interesting alternative to the traditional beef/ refried bean burrito.  I added ground beef to the mixture.  The flavor wasn't great, though.  I will probably make this again with the same ingredients, but adding some other spices to give it the needed kick.

I thought these were wonderful. They are so easy and fast to make. Since the rest of my family is not vegetarian, I need quick meals to prepare for me. I did use less chili powder, only because I am not fond of real spicy food. Otherwise, I followed it exactly. I did serve it with sour cream. Thanks so much Lori for a great, simple, tasty recipe.

I LOVE this recipe!!  Very quick and easy. . . I omitted the cumin and it tasted even better!  Make sure the salsa is chunky otherwise it can be very messy.

Wow!  So good and so fast and easy.  Definately will be used a lot in my home. I particularly like the fact that they can be wrapped, put in refrigerator and eaten cold the next day (Yummy.  They're great to make ahead to take for lunch!! Thanks, Lori
