This is an excellent recipe! Very tasty and extremley simple - yet people think you spent forever making it. I sliced my mushrooms before marinating for less mess. Also, I marninate for several hours for a wonderful robust flavor.

A great main dish, and good as a side with a few changes.

We substituted yellow mustard, olives (for tomato and onion), ketchup (for tomato sauce) and parmesan. We also reduced the amount of salad greens and mushrooms to make it a side dish.

The dressing / marinade was excellent, even with our substitutions. A different seasoning for the Cajun would make a less spicy recipe, if you like. One half a mushroom per person was excellent, and red lettuce with napa cabbage worked as greens, though romaine might be best. It went well with roast potatoes and chicken with a beet soup, adding variety to the meal.

This is a classy, flavorful salad that will satisfy meat-eaters and vegetarians alike.

It was a little time consuming but totally worth it.  What an awesome recipe.  Serve it either as a main dish or with a blackened chicken breast for a (moderately) healthy dinner.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  We substituded black beans and gorgonzola cheese and it was very good!  It is quite spicy and very filling.

This salad was a big hit when I made it at a dinner party. My modifications were to skip the white beans and use feta cheese instead of blue cheese.

This was a great salad. I used it while I was on a low carb diet. It's good with or without the dressing.

This was pretty good, but really spicy.  I couldn't find the stone-ground mustard so we used ground mustard (spice section).  The next time I will cut the cajun seasoning in half and the ground mustard in half.  We also cooked the mushrooms 4 minutes each side.  We only used a 5 oz bag of assorted gourmet salad greens.  16 cups is way too much for 4 people.

My 5 year-old son & I made this for Christmas eve dinner.  Each family member makes something special so it accompanied lamb and spanakopita.  It was easy enough for a 5 year-old but sophisticated enough to hold it's own in the "flavor-wars" of other grown-up palettes!  Used extra dijon mustard as we had no other mustard and butter beans as no one wanted to make another run to the store.  Used romaine lettuce as a platform and added cajun seasoning by common sense--would've used more if there were less little people at the table.  Cooked the HUGE mushrooms longer than directed until done--again common sense.  Absolutely scrumptious--it stole the show!

This was my first time using Portobellos. It turned out really well! I marinated the shrooms for about 2 hours. We didn't use any dressing (not even extra marinade) because the shrooms had a lot of marinade on them.

The flavour was fantastic but it should be scalled down to a side salad.  By the end it had lost it's appeal.

We really liked this but my husband thought there was a little too much vinegar taste. Next time, I will reduce it. Also, the tomato and red onion really didn't add that much and I will leave them. I made this as a side salad. Big mistake. This is a meal by itself. We were so full and satisfied afterward that the two different recipes I made for pork chops didn't get the same attention. Definite gourmet flavor. Expect a lot of time to go into it but well worth the effort.

The only reason why I logged back on tonight to the computer was to post a review for this salad...this was the best salad I have had since the last time I went out to a gourmet resteraunt here in Napa Valley.  In fact, I wouldn't even call it a salad.  It was a meal in itself.  My husband, who usually wont eat anything thats green wolfed it down in no time flat and has requested it be made again tomorrow night!  I forgot to put the blue cheese and I left the tomatoes out and even then, it was excellent!  

My new favorite recipe!!
