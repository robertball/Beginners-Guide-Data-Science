I wasn't crazy about using tinned beef nor deli beef so I shredded part of the left-over Christmas roast beef in the blender.  I cut down the amount of the dry onion soup mix (thanks to another reviewer) and added a few tablespoons of fresh ground horseradish.  Yum!

i made this and it was okay not great but okay. i actually took it away from my husband and tweaked it after a few bites. i added finely chopped onion, hot sauce, a handfull of shredded cheese and crushed cracker crumbs on the top. i baked it at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes to melt the cheese. after that it was ALOT better. I know I changed the recipe entirely but it was a good starting point. served with wheat thins. it was all gone.

This was pretty good. A tad too salty. Don't add all the onion soup mix at once, start with half and then add more if you think it needs it. Also, I hate chipped beef so I just used some from the deli. Much better!

my husband loves this one, though I think it's too salty.  We buy 2 of the 6oz carl budding beefs and just cut it up with shears.  Also its easier if you mix the cream cheese and sour cream first, then the onion mix, then add the beef.  This one is best made the day before to allow the onion mix to soften (there are onion flakes).

We liked it thought I probably would only make it again if I had leftover roast like I did here.

Delicious & Super fast! I added 2 tsp. of horseradish sauce since I Love it with beef. I served it with the raisin rosemary crackers I get from Trader Joe's. The sweet n salty is terrific with this dip! Thank you Joyce, this is one to remember;;)
