My mother used to make this delicious dessert as long as 40 years ago when I was a child.  It has always been one of my favorites, and until I found it on your website it was one I was afraid I would never be able to locate again.  We consumed it many times with no ill result regardless of the raw egg ingredient.

You are getting 2 stars for effort other wise the recipe is not a banana split pie to me. For a banana split pie to even be called as such it would need more than just bananas, whipped cream and chocolate with nuts. It needs strawberries, pineapples and sweet old school butter cookies. If you ever want to learn how to make it right, let me know.

This recipe was quick and easy to make and tasted exactly how I remembered from my childhood when my mom would make it for me!  It was great!

Luckily for me, my husband is the cook around here. I can't really cook all that well, and baking is not really my thing either. This recipe though, was SO easy! I even have a hard time with the simplest things but THIS, seriously, was so easy and fast. My husband LOVED it too! Thanks so much for the recipe :) It was the perfect desert!

This recipe was okay. It was very much like a banana split but there are better pies out there. It was very dense and I didn't like the fact that it had raw eggs in it. Also, I think any banana split pie needs a chocolate pie crust.. by the time you modify this recipe to be good, it wouldn't resemble the original at all.

I use a jumbo egg and I mix the vanilla at the end so the pie gets firm. Using fresh lemon tastes better but don't use too much or it adds to much lemon to the pie and it will not get firm.  My mom has made this for years and it was from 1968 Pillsbury bakeoff.  Our family loves this pie!!!
