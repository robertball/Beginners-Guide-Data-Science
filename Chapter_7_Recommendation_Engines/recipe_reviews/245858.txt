Ohmigosh, my family LOVED this!  I doubled the recipe and used sausage and ground beef. I like to brown the meat in a separate pan on the stove so that I can drain the meat in a colander before I put it in the pressure cooker (I want my family to eat less grease.) I have one of those 10 qt Power Pressure Cookers from the infomercials. I put all the incredients except the cheeses into the pressure cooker and I used chicken broth (it's what I had in the pantry) to make sure the dry pasta was covered with liquid and stirred it all together.  Then I set the cooker for 8 minutes on the "Risotto Setting" and made sure to release the valve and not let it sit on "keep warm" to long so that the pasta didn't get soggy.  I stirred in the cheeses, which melted right away, and served.  This will be a family favorite for sure.

Update 10/24/2016:
Ok, I noticed all the reviews that said this recipe was bland and my family actually laughed out loud when I told them that, so I set out to find out what I was doing differently here other than the sausage.  I realized that instead of using boring old "Stewed Tomatoes" I use a can of Rotel brand diced tomatoes in this recipe.  I think it really punches up the flavor, especially against the ricotta cheese.  Hopefully that helps some of y'all that are looking for something more interesting, because this is a super easy meal and I love making it on weekdays.  It's also great for leftovers.

This was my first "whole meal" in my new pressure cooker (cooked rice the day before, but that was it) and it turned out fantastically! I was thrilled!

We found it very tasty. I used ground moose meat because that's what we have in the freezer, and I actually used 2lbs of meat as I had to feed 7 for dinner. The onion I used was also very large. I had a larger can of tomato sauce than what was called for, but since you had to cover with water anyway, I just threw the whole thing in there as part of the liquid. Also, I very often put more garlic in a recipe than what is stated, and this was no exception - I think I used 4 or 5 cloves (it was a bit older, so it needed some help. ;)

It cooked up to perfection in my 6 qt Instant Pot set manually to high pressure and 7 minutes (since the meat was doubled). I wish I could say that 7 minutes is the magic number, but my pot didn't seal the first time and I threw it on again for another 5 minutes. I basically stirred in the ricotta cheese and served - we all put our own bit of grated mozza cheese on top. So delicious! We are all looking forward to having this again sometime soon!

This was my "teach myself how to use my pressure cooker" recipe, so I played around a bit. I  didn't find it bland, but then I also added all my seasoning to the meat as I browned it, and I used more than called for. I saw one reviewer used Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Since the meat cooked down so much the first time, the second time I used double the amount, equal part beef and sausage. I also used tomato paste instead of stewed tomatos, just because I never liked chunks of tomato in my sauce, this is probably why I didn't find it thin as some others said. I have since made it several times, sometimes with the spinach and sometimes without. (Some in my family don't like spinach) When leaving  out the spinach, I had to cut back on salt, it seems the spinach needs it more than the rest of the dish. Once I even used frozen broccoli florets instead of the spinach, worked great and tasted really good. Now that I have mastered my pressure cooker, time to find more recipes!

It was pretty easy to throw together. I'm still adjusting to my pressure cooker so it took a little longer to cook. It was a bit bland so I added more garlic salt and seasonings but in the end it was tasty! I'll definitely be making this again!

This was a great way to provide a hearty meal quickly. I used a whole onion and cooked it with my meat. For sauce, I used some homemade spaghetti sauce (30 ounces) that I added a can of tomato paste to. I upped the seasonings - probably tripled and added some crushed red pepper. Instead of frozen spinach, I used about four or five ounces of fresh. I used a box of whole grain pasta which took longer to cook. As others suggested, I used broth instead of water. It was probably about 3 1/2 cups of water. After pressure cooking, I added cottage cheese as that is what I had on hand. I was concerned about the amount of water remaining, but realized that the pasta would soak it up as it finished cooking. I stirred in probably two cups of mozzarella just before serving.

Easy recipe. It came out a little watery for my taste, so I added a jar of pasta sauce to thicken it up. I put the pressure cooker lid on for 5 minutes without turning the pressure cooker back on to heat the sauce. It came out perfect and is just as good leftover.

I simmered sauce on the stove first and then mixed remaining ingredients.   Needs some more spices / seasonings.   I would also add some broth to make it juicier if I bake it again.    Not bad start tho.

The only thing I did different in the recipe was added more of the stewed tomatoes and more cottage cheese than listed.  It was so yummy, will be making a lot of this in the future.  Thank you.

This was very good! I did have to change some things because I have a very small Instant Pot, so I cut back on some of the ingredients and used Italian Sausage, like many people suggested and I did not add the spinach. It was one of the best recipes from this website I have ever found.

We liked this, but it was a bigger hit with toddlers. They LOVED it probably for the same reason we thought it was just ok - since it was somewhat bland. We'll try more seasoning and perhaps italian sausage next time. Recommend fresh spinach, since we used frozen and it was not as tasty. This was our very first Instant Pot recipe and it was very easy, though getting to know our Instant Pot took longer.

After reading other reviews I added 5 garlic cloves, doubled the seasoning and used more salt and pepper - still a bit bland but would make it again as it was easy  using the pressure cooker. I used ground turkey (which probably didn't help with the flavour) instead of beef and added chicken stock instead of the water.

This was really good. After reading the other reviews, I decided to add sausage and some additional seasoning. I added extra garlic, salt, Sweet Basil, pepper, and a little cumin. I don't have a pressure cooker, so I cooked it on the stovetop, but it was so good. My son is eating his third helping now.

Do not “add water to cover.” Way too much water that didn’t evaporate in the pressure cooker and basically made it a soup. No flavor whatsoever.

I made changes based on prior reviews as I think the original recipe would have been to bland for my taste. I used chorizo sausage, doubled the herbs, 5 cloves garlic, used leftover homemade marinara sauce, added 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, box of pasta was 12 ounces.   This was quite tasty, a bit of a kick and very quick to make without all the fuss. Also made it ahead of time and added the cheeses just prior to serving.

I did not make changes (other than I always add seasonings like salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, etc. to my ground beef when I’m browning it). 
It smelled great and my son really liked it and wanted seconds. So that means it’s the bomb.com. Lol!
I am doing a special diet right now so I couldn’t eat it. So I took a bite just to taste it and I thought it was good. It does taste like lasagna to me. 
I will make this again and do recommend it. The only thing negative I might say is that the noodles may be too mushy for some.

I agree with many of the reviewers saying it was a little bland. I used marinara sauce instead of canned tomato sauce, I put extra oregano, Italian seasoning and garlic but I still found it just a touch bland. I added more garlic salt after the fact. I think next time I would probably triple the spices,  use chicken broth like others mentioned and use more like four or five cloves of garlic instead of just one. I liked the easy clean up tho and I will probably make this again with a few tweaks.

We marked it down to 4 servings instead of 8. I'm sure glad we did, it was a lot of leftovers. There was enough there for 8 servings, al together . But other then the large amount of food, it was absolutely amazing. Just make sure to make to garlic bread with it, to give another texture to the mix.

May make again. I forget to thaw the spinach, so I didn't add that. Then I couldn't find my mozzarella. I did add a can of sliced olives. Still needed salt, though.

I have been trying recipes with my new instant pot. This was the first using pasta. The pasta was good, and so easy to cook with the other ingredients.
I thought the dish needed more flavor. It was very messy too. Every fork full had long tiling strings of cheese. Naming it lasagna seems to be just wrong.

I will make this again, but I will add more flavoring and more cheese next time. It seemed rather bland to me.

So easy to make and a very big winner with my 3 fussy monsters. I did however change the pasta to gluten free as my youngest monster can’t eat it. Will be making this again

I didn't like it. I didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted spaghetti sauce, even so it lacked flavor.  I didn't like the consistency of the cheese mixed in. I prefer it layered in the regular lasagne recipe

Fantastic!  This is my first time to write a review in 10 years or so - so you know I was impressed!  I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef because that's what I'm used to.  And I may have added slightly more of the cheeses at the end!  Super simple for such a great meal.  My husband still misses the traditional lasagna method of layering - but said this tasted just as good as my regular!

I whipped this together in less than 30 minutes! I love the fact that I can do everything in one pot! Because I prefer more flavor, I did make some adjustments in the seasonings used and used chicken stock to barely cover everything in the pot once the noodles were added. I then cooked for 8 minutes on high pressure and used the quick release method. We used gemelli noodles for a little extra chew and it was delicious. Other than seasoning, the method was straight forward and easy to follow.

I just started cooking with the instapot. This was the third recipe I have tried from All Recipes for the instapot. I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef. I was not super impressed with this recipe as the pasta was a little over cooked and I had trouble getting the mozzarella to melt on top. I will probably not make it again.

I used canned tomato sauce instead of the guidelines to make it here; Useful if you have all of those ingredients. My pressure cooker doesn't seem to like something about the process and I kept getting an error that it didn't have enough water. Not sure why. Not the recipe's fault. Stopped the process twice and the second time around I figured it was done enough. All in all, pretty good, just needs salt. I have lunch for the rest of the week now.

Had to look back at other reviews and added red pepper flakes to spice up. Will make again using hot sausage but was good. Love using my pressure cooker.

Added seasoning though the recipe didn't call for it. Very bland. Next time I will season more heavily.

This was pretty good. Nice, easy and fast meal all in one pot. I did saute the onions, garlic and spices first before adding and cooking the ground beef. I also used Italian stewed tomatoes. My grandkids loved it and I will make again

This was the first thing I made in my pressure cooker and it was fantastic!

Super easy to make and took around 10 minutes worth of prep and another 20-30 minutes of cooking. In all truth and fairness I was amazed at how quickly it came out. When the alarm on the cooker went off, I thought there was no way it was done.

Makes for FANTASTIC leftovers. Add about 1/4-1/2 cup of water to it and then microwave for round 4 minutes. Every bit as good as the day I made it.

tasted like Chef Boyarde despite using italian sausage. Will be adding more fennel seeds, oregano, salt, pepper, basil, tomatoes/tomato paste...  Maybe we'll pour it into a casserole dish and broil up the cheese on top?  Maybe too much pasta and ricotta??? Good luck if you try it!

This is absolutely amazing!! I'm made two batches, one with spinach and one without. My boys (7,11, &12) ate the one with spinach and said you couldn't even taste it ?? I could taste it but I also used fresh spinach. Instead of ricotta I used cottage cheese because I had it on hand. We will never eat stouffers again! ?? Also, put as little water as possible, mine ended up a little watery ??. It still delicious!

It was bland.

(Update - it looks like someone heavily edited my review and removed an entire paragraph. I never received feedback or a notification that it was being edited so this might have been a technical error. Adding in my comments again below.)

I wish I had read the other reviews before making this. Most of the 5-star reviews are from people who heavily modified the recipe (such as using sausage instead of beef, or adding lots of garlic, salt, veggies, etc). As written, this recipe is very bland and looked nothing at all like the photo.

it was a little bland so I added salt and a 6oz can of tomato paste. I think it would be better with sausage rather than just plain ground beef.
