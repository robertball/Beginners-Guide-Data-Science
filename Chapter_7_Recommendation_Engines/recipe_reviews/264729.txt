Love this although I had to tweak it a bit for health reasons. (Chol & Carbs) Here is my version: 

2 cups frozen tropical fruit. (140 Cal), (0 g fat), (0 g sat fat), (0 mg chol), (32 g carbs), (12 g sugar, on the high side but doable)
1 cup sugar free silk almond coconut milk. (35 Cal), (0 g fat), (0 g sat fat), (0 mg chol), (1 g carbs,), (0 g sugar)
1/2 cup Trop50. (50 Cal), (0 g fat), (0 g sat fat), (13 g carbs), (10 g sugar)
Two squirts liquid stevia. 

Put all ingredients in mixer. ( I have a little bullet so I had to let the fruit thaw a little and I had to do two batches, well worth it!!) Will definitely make it again, and again.

Enjoy!!
