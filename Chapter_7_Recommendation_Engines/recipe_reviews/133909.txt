Very good recipe! Tastes just like the ones we get from our local asian market. I filled mine with a sweet coconut mixture to make chinese cocktail buns, very yummy:3 for anyone who is looking to cut down on a bit of work, i experimented and put all the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough cycle and it rose beautifully! The order i did it in: warm milk, oil(i used canola), eggs, sugar, salt, bread flour, and lastly the yeast (i accidentally added in the 2 tsp of water to the dough that was meant for the egg wash:P it didn't hurt anything).. then i let my bread machine do its thing:) after it was done kneading i let it sit in the machine for about 2 hours. After i filled and placed my rolls on the baking sheet i let them sit in the oven for an hour (for the first 20 mins i put a bowl of boiling water under the bread then took it out and let the rolls sit in the oven for the remaining 40 mins). I used a honey wash for a bit of a sweet glaze:) Turned out sweet, soft, and so so yummy! Thank you for the recipe!!!

I have made this recipe twice.  No more pizza pops in out house.  The kids love the sweet dough and we put pizza toppings inside.  We divide the recipe into 13 and is gives them a nice size for their lunches.  I cheat a bit and add all the ingredients into my bread maker.  I use instant yeast and mix with a third of the flour.  Make sure the milk is quite warm mix in the sugar.  Top with dry ingredients, make a small hole and pour in the oil, egg, and water.  You might have to add a bit of water while this mixing process, my bread machine makes a loud clicking sound. I don't know how many rules I've broken by using the bread maker, but it works for me.   We will be making this recipe lots.  Thanks for sharing.

My family loves Chinese Pork Buns, and this dough was PERFECT to make them at home. Follow this recipe, and you'll have great pork (or beef, or chicken, or veggie) buns too! The only thing I recommend is in step 1 to add the eggs, oil, and salt BEFORE the flour (or at least at the same time by making a well in the flour), as it is difficult to mix otherwise. I find that two hours is usually plenty for the first rise, and for my oven the final baking is usually only 20 minutes. These are so great, and wonderfully non-messy to eat. Enjoy!

Followed the instructions exactly and turned out great. Mine took just under 4 hours for the dough to rise to a light and airy consistency. Baked as above instructions informed and made them into original sweet buns that i topped with coconut and almond slivers; tasted amazing! I still have some more dough that I am going to fill with some red bean paste.

I stumbled upon this recipe while searching for a sweet dough recipe to use for cinnamon rolls. The "cross between a bread and pastry dough" in the description caught my eye, so I whipped up a batch, omitting the sesame seeds & egg-wash step at the end of the recipe (naturally!). I was not disappointed!! My rolls turned out marvelous. Perfect taste and texture. I will be using this dough for cinnamon buns from now on. Thanks   for the great recipe.

Not sweet at all!!! I would add less salt (1/2 tsp), more sugar, less yeast!!! but overall a nice recipe!
nice texture, nice rise, a little "yeasty"
I would probably only use egg for the wash; water makes them hard.

Love this bread!  Proofed and mixed in the mixer with a dough hook.  I did add the liquid ingredients and the eggs before adding flour to the mixer.  I was worried at how wet the dough felt after mixing, but it came together nicely.  Great texture and flavor.  Cooked this at 300' for 25 min in the convection oven filled with italian chicken and sauce.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have time to stuff my meat mixture in these so I made them into dinner rolls with the meat on the side.  Everyone loved them.  I will make these again but maybe decrease the salt by 1/2 tsp.  These were really easy and really tasty!

I just tried making this dough recipe with my breadmaker. It works splendidly. I put all the liquid, oil, salt and sugar into the pan before the flour. Then I add the dried yeast last. OMG! I am so gonna keep this recipe! Thanks. Been looking for this for a long time. I added 2 tsp of caster sugar to the egg wash. I brushed the buns with the egg wash twice so it got pretty dark in color after baking. Will brush once only next time. Hubby loved the taste of the bun with chinese bbq pork for filling!
Will upload pic in a while.

This is a really good recipe. I was multi-tasking, so I put all of the ingredients in the bread machine in the order of the recipe, save that I put the flour in last. The dough rose beautifully and I used a chicken/ cabbage/carrot filling, flavored with Chinese five spice, garlic and green onions. The egg wash made them beautifully golden. This was very easy and very tasty. We will use this again! 

Thank you for the recipe!

Really good instructions. I tried it tonight and it was a hit for the family, I even have some left over (freezer.) I used my bread machine and changed only two things, I used 3c bread flour and no seeds. Well put together. 4 stars and 2 thumbs up. Thanks

this recipe had potential, but there wasn't enough sugar and mine came out to be very doughy. these were really fun to make though.
Also I would add less salt

I have been looking for soft sweet buns for so long and at last I have found it. I halved the recipe and did not glaze them (no more eggs). Other than that, I kept to the letter and it is the best bun recipe that turned out so well!

First time making yeast rolls and didn't do well. It would have been nice if it was more detailed on the process to get it to rise. Not fun. Not tasty.

I made these buns with bbq pork filling. I am thinking about using my bread maker to knead and rise the dough next time. I'll update this when I see how that turns out. This recipe is easy to follow unlike other recipes for chinese sweet buns AND you don't need any special equipment really. They were super delicious too and I will make again for sure!

I made this in my bread machine and it came out perfectly.  My kids loved it.  I will make it again using more sugar and make little cinnamon rolls with it. The dough was very pliable and easy to work with.  You could use this dough for many purposes.  I made a filling of ground beef and veggies with an asian peanut sauce.  These went fast.

Very good recipe. It was tasty and just like the ones from the market. I am learning to make breads, so the next time, I will not be so concerned about the folding of them. Not as light and puffy, as I had hoped, probably because I had too much dough on the bottom..... overall very tasty!

Pretty good flavor but slightly heavier texture than our local Chinese bakery. I used the dough to make 8 Chinese style hot dog buns which my daughter loves and had enough dough remaining for a few buns (3) stuffed with the last leftover short rib I had on hand and then made 3 knotted rolls when I ran out of hot dogs and short rib.  Now I can save myself a ton of money since I don't have to buy them at the bakery! 

I followed the recipe exactly and it felt dry when I was rolling it out so next time I will watch the dough more closely and keep it tackier.  I know the ambient temperature and humidity affect dough but now I have a better idea of how it should look and feel. I will make this again very soon.

I used this dough to make sausage buns and cream cheese buns. Turned out perfect. I did reduce the salt by 1/2tsp and substituted part of the vegetable oil with butter. When mixing, I put the sugar, milk and yeast into the mixing bowl to activate the yeast, then after that I added eggs, flour and finally butter/vege oil, in stages, in that order.
