With my alterations I give this recipe 5 stars for its tasty, earthy, comfort food appeal! I cooked 1 cup of white long grain rice with 2 cups of chicken broth in a separate pan so I could add it to my ground beef mixture. I did not have pork sausage, but I'm sure it would be wonderful in this dish. I also added onions, celery, dried sage, 2 cloves of garlic, and rosemary to the meat for a savory taste. Once the squash was cooked, I spooned the rice and meat mixture into the wells, then topped each with some grated colby jack cheese. It turned out beautifully and was very tasty. My husband, who doesn't even like acorn squash, ate two servings! See my photo of this lovely autumn dish!

I really liked this.  I tweaked it a little to suit my caloric preferences.  Ground turkey instead of pork/beef.  Eliminated the oil, not necessary for the meat or squash.  Diced tomato instead of cheese.  Also, I dont have a microwave, so I baked the squash @ 375 for 40 minutes, then another 20 with the stuffing.  A great, healthy, delicous meal.

the squash is bitter, but add a teaspoon of brown sugar to the bottom before you add your sausage to it. It will make all the difference in the world.

I just used sausage, no hamburger.  I also added mushrooms to the onion mixture.  Hubby said he could eat it every night - LOVED it.

I found the basic recipe on the bland side.  I might have used the rong sausage.  The there are several seasoning posibilityto try.

Enjoyed the savory take on the acorn squash. Didn't have sausage on hand, but spiced up some ground pork with sage, a little cayenne, and salt and pepper. Imagine the filling would have been even better with pre-made sausage.

I'm surprised so many people liked this recipe. I do a lot of cooking and I've got to say that these tastes just did not go together. Although the filling was good on it's own, the sweetness of the squash tasted awful with the spices and cheese. My boyfriend couldn't even finish it, and that's saying something. Sorry, I've got to give this a thumbs-down!

Very tasty! Its nice to find a good recipe that isn't a sweet one.  I didn't have pork or ground beef, I used ground turkey.  Next time I will be sure to have the pork on hand, I think it would be even better!

I use veggie beef and it's good. Not the most exciting thing you can do with an acorn squash, but decent and quick.

This was surprisingly very good.  I prebaked the squash in the oven for 40 minutes at 375 degrees.  Added mushrooms, canned tomatoes, and a bit of the following spices: Cayenne Pepper, Celery Seed, & Rosemary to the meat.  Delicious!

This was WON-DER-FUL.  Used ground pork (not sausage).  Probably would add some rosemary, etc. next time for a little more flavor, but still was great.  The savory filling with the sweet squash was excellent.

I made a few changes so I can't rate the recipe as written but it has proven to be a base for a successful dinner.  If you have time I recommend baking the squash open faced, seeded, with water in the bottom of a pan and covered with foil for 50 minutes. The squash came out so tender. Then I rubbed brown sugar on the inside of the squash. For the meat I only had hamburger so I sauted that with onion, cumin, tarragon, and celery seed. You can play with the spices in the meat mixture to make it savory. I put the meat mixture in the squash, covered with foil, and baked for another 25 minutes. This was OH SO GOOD!

make it your own!  so versatile - just use what you've got.  I grow patty pan and zucchini in my garden.  I use brown rice, ground beef, onion, veggies (cut up squash that you cut out), pasta sauce and top with cheese. Perfect!

It needed more cheese than what it called for but my picky husband requested it for the 2nd time this month! I used ground pork instead of sausage for less fat and it was really good.

Just made it today and uploaded a photo.  It was much better than I expected.  The flesh of the squash went perfectly with the sausage stuffing mixture.  We will make it again for sure!

A delicious dish, and a really nice presentation too.  
I usually make it with just sausage, and use shredded cheese both mixed in and sprinkled on top.

I liked it; my wife thought it was OK, not good enough to make again. I baked the squash at 375 for an hour rather than microwave it. Then stuffed it and finished baking at 350 per directions. I used shredded cheese rather than cubes and it mixed in quite well. It's definitely a relatively easy dish to make and all you need other than a side of bread or rolls.

I, too, cut this recipe in half to serve only two. It was delicious! I followed dianev’s modifications and am glad I did - lots of savory flavor. I added rice, too. Next time I will experiment with adding some red pepper and/or tomatoes as well. I was worried the stuffing would be too bland, but with the savory spices and some salt, the stuffing was excellent. A great way to use acorn squash!

This is good and it was quite easy!  I baked my squash in the microwave for 10 minutes with a little water in the bottom in the baking dish rather than using the plastic wrap.  I used ground turkey and added a little quinoa (1/2 cup uncooked) to round it out.  I also added sage, thyme, and parsley to the other seasonings.  Very filling.

I'll make it again, but I made a lot of changes. I used all sage pork sausage and used a full pound. I'm a low carber, so I didn't completely drain the fat from the sausage after browning. I used a HUGE acorn squash and cut it in thirds. I didn't put cheese into the filling, rather I put shredded cheddar on top of each third during the last few minutes of baking.  It is yummy, and it was nice to find a recipe that didn't have bread crumbs or rice in it, neither of which I can eat.  This maxes out my carbs for the day, so I cut the servings in half. What a great dinner treat on days when you are at just a few carbs consumed for the day! And if you must eat carbs, what better source than acorn squash? Healthy - and delicious.

I made this tonight with a few additions. I browned the onions and garlic in olive oil then added the beef Hamburg. When it was browned I added 1 cup of cooked rice, a pinch of cayenne and Tex mex cheese as that was all I had on hand. I also had some homemade spaghetti sauce and added a tablespoon of it to each portion. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.

My first time ever for Acorn Squash. Very palatable. I used an Herb & Sea Salt gift from my daughter for the salt. (white pepper, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, bay leaf, sage, parsley and rosemary) Very aromatic.  No onion on hand so used leek. Don't be afraid to try something new with this recipe. I'll be making again.

A great dinner recipe! The flavors blended well for a savory mouthful in every bite. Only change was swapping oven time for microwave time...not a big fan of the microwave.

I made these for dinner the other night and they were great!!!
My son had went back for seconds.  I basically followed the recipe with some small changes. First I cooked the acorn halves face down on a greased cookie sheet with a sea salt, fresh pepper and garlic powder, I cooked them at 375 for about 45 - 50 min, till soft and getting brown on the edges.  while this was cooking I made the filling basically following the recipe as stated, the only changes I made was to use a large sweet onion, 4 cloves of garlic ( I was making 6 halves)
I also added shredded three cheddar cheese and some sour cream to the mix.  I added salt and pepper some ground sage and a little cayenne pepper, tasted and adjusted the seasonings. I let the filling cool slightly then loaded the squash and sprinkled a little bit of the shredded cheese on top, cooked for 15-20 as stated and then hit it with the broiler to get brown on top.  My family loved it I served it with saute'd  mushrooms, salad and french bread.  Thank you so much for your wonderful recipe, I loved the savory sweet combo of this dish!

Loved this... I also used ground turkey, and sautéed the garlic and onion first, then added the meat. I liked adding the cheese (used both cheddar and mozzarella) into this mix, became nicely melted. Friends we had over were quite impressed, they couldn't believe how good it tasted!

We used ground pork for the meat (left out the ground beef), grated 1/2 an apple and added green onions in the skillet after the meat was browned and the onions were cooked. The apples complimented the pork well!

As with most things on AllRecipes, tweaks were made for what I had on hand and personal preference. I added quinoa (made 1/4 cup raw quinoa in a rice cooker with 1/2 cup water), substituted 1/4 lb ground turkey for the ground beef, kept the 1/4 lb pork sausage (hot), and used pepper jack cheese on top. I didn't use oil when cooking the meat, instead adding a splash of water and apple cider for liquid. Turned out AMAZING! Glad I found this recipe, for a meatier version of stuffed squash!

Absolutely delicious! I had a couple apple bourbon brats left, so I chopped one finely and added to skillet after the hamburger and onion was done instead of using raw sausage. The possibilities are endless with this, cant wait to try with rice, yum, what a keeper, thanks!

Love this recipe - great comfort food for the fall/winter time!  For 2 squashes (4 halves), I used a full pound of ground turkey and 1/2 lb of ground pork.  I also used more shredded cheese.  Delish!

My husband and I both really loved this and my husband is a bit of a food snob and hard to please.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated (I actually made the mixture earlier in the day and stuck it in the fridge) and it was great.  Only "issue" I found was that I wish the squash had more room to hold more of the filling, we had some left over but there just wasn't enough room for anymore.  I also found that 10mins in the microwave was plenty.

Very good if you like acorn squash. I did add a bit of brown sugar to the squash as other reviewers suggested.  The squash was sweet and the filling was spicy. I liked the combo but my hubby didn't care for it.

I didn't use hamburger, just the sausage and I added mushrooms. To spice it up more I added chopped poblano and red pepper.  I would definetly make this again.  Nice fall dinner, yum.

I used this recipe as a guideline but made some changes. I used sage sausage and italian flavored sausage, chopped up some cabbage, celery and sweet onion added some garlic and shallots along with some different seasoning I had in my cupboard. I didn't have any cubed/block cheese, so I just used shredded cheddar and mozzerella cheese.  My husband LOVED it!!!  I will definitely be making this one again!
