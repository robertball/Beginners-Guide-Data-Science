I have been making Chicken Marsala this way for at least 25 years and it is the most simple and delicious recipe.  Do try it, you will not be disappointed.  I will add that I use  Sweet Marsala as opposed to the Dry Marsala and use more crushed garlic.

Also, you can place the cooked chicken breasts into a baking pan and then top with the sauce and place in the oven, covered, for approxiamtely 20 minutes at 325 degrees; an alternative to the stove top method.

Made this for the 1st time tonite. Didn't need the whole cup of flour, maybe 1/2? 

I didn't have any white rice, so I doubled the gravy and served on a platter of egg noodles.

I was multi-tasking, so I went with one of the reviewers suggestions and put in a baking dish in the oven for 25 mins. I Don't Think I'll do that again. While the chicken Was Tender and flavorful, it caused the breading to have a slightly "Wet/Rubbery" texture. Next time, I'll try the original skillet method.

This is just me nit-picking tho. The recipe is Definately a Keeper!

I made this last night.  It was very good, and I'll make it again but change a few things.  A cup of flour was way too much, I'll try a half next time.  And there wasn't enough liquid - I'll double or maybe triple the liquids next time.  Thanks for the recipe - easy and tasty.

simple and easy and tasty! While not the most gourmet version possible, this recipe certainly made this dish easy enough for a busy weeknight, which I loved. I did not need the whole 1 C of flour. Two words of caution when making this recipe. 1. cut your chicken breasts thinly - I had to flip my thicker breasts several times, which caused them to lose their coating. 2. I used canned broth, and even though it was reduced sodium, I'm glad I tasted the sauce before salting to taste - otherwise it would have been too salty for me.

I have tried other Marsala recipes from this site and I haven't liked any of them.  This one is so simple and was amazing.  Restaurant quality! I followed the recipe exactly except for the fact that I cut it in half for just my husband and I.  I made it even easier and used 90 second microwaved brown rice.  I served it with green beans.  Awesome!

I just made this with a few adjustments for what I had on hand... I had leftover Jasimine rice, so I used that, just warmed it up and I did not have Marsala wine on hand so I used Chenin Blanc wine...this was SO delicious and my 12 year old asked me to make this a keeper, so I think I will continue to make it the same way. Very good!!!

I loved that the chicken was tender and not dry, but didn't care for the sauce. The sauce was lacking flavor and, my husband and I both thought it was too "winey."  I'm going to try it again using a bit less wine, more chicken stock and some ground mustard, parsley and garlic powder with a splash of whole milk. Other recipes use a bit of ground mustard and garlic powder so maybe that will give it more depth of flavor. I did serve it with angel hair pasta, which we liked. White rice plays hell with my Type 1 Diabetic husband but for some reason, he handles a bit on angel hair better.

Wonderful! Chicken marsala is one of my favorite dishes at Olive Garden and this this recipe just about nails it! I've made it twice now, and can't wait to make it again. The only thing I would change is the salt. There's enough salt in the chicken stock to satisfy my family's taste, so I don't use it to season the mushrooms or the flour.

Moist and Tasty!  I used canned mushrooms for lack of fresh. When I prepare this dish again I will most likely double up on the mushrooms, butter, and wet ingredients  ingredients so that there is more sauce.

This recipe will keep you at the stove for a while, but it's worth every minute invested.

This was good. Next time I'll double or triple the liquid ingredients for the sauce.  Also, a 1/2 cup of flour is plenty to bread the chicken.

Delicious!  I didn’t change a thing. The chicken was tender and flavorful.  The only thing I would do differently is perhaps double the Marsala sauce.  There wasn’t enough of it!

This was easy and really good.  One cup flour is too much. We garnished with chopped scallions and used a generic sweet red wine. My 22 y/o son made it. Whole family loved it.

Didn’t have wine so I used red wine vinegar and a tablespoon of sugar and a little more chicken broth. Not bad.

I added a shallot with my garlic and used fresh chopped spinach instead of parsley. I cut up my chicken into large bite size pieces as well. 
All in all, it was pretty good! I will be making it again for sure!

The chicken, mushrooms, and sauce came out absolutely amazing. I doubled the sauce and would even consider doing more next time. I was not, however, a big fan of this dish over rice. I would highly recommend making it with with pasta for a 5 star meal.

This is a fantastic and simple recipe.  I doubled the sauce because I like to let it condense down a bit to increase the flavours and allow it to thicken.  I sauteed sliced onions before the mushrooms and garlic.  I seasoned the chicken before dredging in flour.  I also added a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme.  I served it over mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce.  Add a green veggie and your plate looks like it's from a restaurant.  This is definitely a keeper!

Very tasty dish. I concur with another review that if you're using the amount of chicken recommended (I cut the breasts in half horizontally to create the thin cutlets), use half the amount of flour. Keep the seasonings the same. Also, the sauce does not get very thick without some help. I used about 1-2 tbsps Wondra flour mixed with chicken stock then mixed into the sauce base to thicken to your liking. Otherwise, it was quite good!

Really good and easy! I doubled the recipe and was concerned that just doubling the sauce would change timing but it didn't. Once the sauce cooks a bit in the end, it just comes together! Just keep an eye on it.

A rating based on taste alone would receive 5 stars; however, the sauce never thickened up for me. I used 3 large chicken breasts, sliced thinly width-wise to make 6 thin chicken breasts (instead of pounding) and had to make the chicken in two batches because my pan was just barely too small. If I made this again, I would make MORE sauce, add a cornstarch slurry (and boil the sauce) to thicken it up, before adding the chicken back in.

Excellent! I'd been craving chicken marsala for awhile and then I just happened upon the recipe. I didn't think it'd be as good as I'd had before, so I put it off. I cooked it tonight, coincidentally, on a night I was in a dinner contest for best looking meal. I won!! I won with the people who ate it, too. Winner!

Made this tonight and it was good but not a lot of flavor for the chicken and no extra sauce when serving.  I’ll definitely make again but with a few changes such as less flour and more broth

I am a big fan of chicken and mushrooms, especially when they are together in a dish, so I was excited to try this recipe! I added extra mushrooms to the recipe because of my love for them. I'm not a big fan of white rice on it's own but it really added some extra substance to this dish. I did cook the dish without the Marsala wine, and I thought it turned out fine. I noticed that some people in their reviews said that they preferred it without the taste of the wine anyway, so I figured it would be fine to omit from the recipe. I liked the way the sauce tasted and I definitely plan on making this again.

It was all right. The texture and breading were great, but the seasoning is a little left to be desired. I would also do something to the sauce too as it was a little underwhelming.

Overall the flavor was great and I will definitely make this one again!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and doubled the wine & chicken stock.  That ended up being way too much liquid so I had to boil it down which took a lot longer.  Next time, I'm just going to follow the recipe as is.

Really delicious.  I doubled the sauce ingredients as well as the mushrooms though so that everyone could have a generous amount of sauce and I substituted egg noodles for rice.  Everyone loved it.

Made this last night! Turned out very good. I followed receipe almost to the T. I added more garlic and oregano than called for, used less flour and doubled the liquid. Will for sure make this again. It’s simple, tasty and elegant looking.

I tried the the recipe it came out nicely and I'll definitely try it again but I'll cut down on the Marsala wine a bit or maybe try more garlic to offset the sweetness. Also I feel of you aren't using Marsala Wine and a nice brand NOT the stuff that says cooking wine then you really aren't getting the flavor thats meant for this recipe. Any other wine won't do it justice, sure it'll taste fine but I suggest using Marsala wine first to see the difference.

I substituted angel hair pasta for the rice.  I used a lemon infused olive oil to coat the pasta before topping with the sauce.   To extend the sauce I increased the amount of stock, butter, and Marsala wine.  It was absolutely delicious.

This is a great recipe with good instructions.  

I cut the chicken into cubes because it's easier to manage and portion.  The flour coating is very light and cutting the chicken allows it to better absorb the flavors.   I used 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and salt per recipe and made a double portion for my family of 4.    I thought it was perfect, but was told that it needed more salt and less pepper.

I cook on a gas stove and kept the flame on high to more quickly thicken the sauce.  It has a nice savory flavor.

Very goood, only thing is I would add double amount of marsala wine and chicken broth in order for more gravy sauce to mix with the chicken and the rice.

My family really enjoyed this.  I sliced the breast in half rather than pounding.  We all agreed it needed a lot more mushrooms.  I did add milk and a little cornstarch.  The sauce did not get thick on its own.  My chicken would have been way over cooked.  Good recipe with some tweaking.

Sauce was tasty, did as others suggested and doubled. The chicken was tender but needed just another little something, maybe a bit more  salt next time. Served over noodles with peas. Worth a try, I will make again. Love an easy clean-up

I have always disliked Marsala for some reason. 

I decided to give this recipe a try. 

I used "Holland House Cook Wine Marsala". 

This is a light red cooking wine , rather than white. 

It made the recipe. 

I have made it three times now and each time it is delicious.

Added fresh green onions and a little dried parsley.  Used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth as well as  same amount of the Marsala Wine.  It was delicious but still could have used more sauce.  Will make this again, but increase the sauce more than I did.   My husband absolutely loved it.

This was very good. I doubled the sauce and added 2 TBL cornstarch to 1/2 cup of cold water, to add to the sauce BEFORE putting the chicken back in. It thickened up nicely.

Overall a very tasty dish!  However a couple of things to note: First of all you certainly do not need 1 cup of flour to dredge the chicken.  I used about 1/2 of that.  Also, at the time you add the cooked breasts to the mushroom, broth & wine, you will need to thicken it a bit.  I did not and had to take out the chicken and make a roux to thicken up the gravy.  If you can figure out how to coat the chicken with more flour, perhaps it would have worked.

This dish looks nothing like the photo when it's done. The sauce is not milky like this, it's very much thin and wine colored. If you try to cook it down, btw, you will overcook the chicken. I'm disappointed.

I have to say that the end product looks nothing like the picture.  The sauce looks creamy like it has some half & half and there appears to be some parsley on it.  None of this appears in the ingredients.  I haven't eaten it yet so perhaps it will taste good

LOVE will add onions next time, It will add more flavor.  I added the rice at the end to the pan instead of putting on top, and think I might even through a bit of Feta in at the end.  It was so yum and will add but a fab start!!!

I made this for my wife on Valentine's Day and we had an amazing dinner thanks to this recipe! So simple. It turned out great!

Next time I would add a bit more mushroom. They came out so flavorful that I was a little sad there wasn't any left. I also took a small wedge of lemon and lightly squeezed some lemon juice over the top of the chicken. The little bit of lemon really compliments the flavors in the chicken if you ask me :-) But to each his own!

Very good recipe! Instead of white rice, I served with Spaghetti Squash Saute (from this website), steamed broccoli, and a garden salad. I was nervous about using a medium sweet Marsala wine (Taylor New York Brand), but the Marsala sauce was perfect. Do not rush it and give the sauce time to reduce and thicken! As another reviewer noted, 1 cup of flour was too much (we had 4 large chicken breasts we halved and pounded). I added a little oregano to the flour as a friend suggested, which was excellent. Also, next time I would rather fry in a little olive oil instead of butter. If you are making a large batch, the residual butter is going to brown or burn. I ended up switching pans and using olive oil after cooking the 3rd breast. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This was tasty. And easy. Double the liquid for extra gravy. Could even triple.

Loved it and so simple. Didn't think the sauce would thicken but it did. I was just impatient. Thanks for a great recipe that I will use again and again.

This was so simple to make, I didn't think it would be great, but I was wrong.  This dish is delicious!!  Because I had lots of potatoes, I made mashed potatoes instead of rice.  my husband loves putting a little gravy on his potatoes.  Simple but delicious!  I will call on this recipe many more times, I'm sure.

So easy,  will make again.. Halved the recipe for two of us, but needed more sauce to pour over the rice.  Also added garlic  powder to the flour mixture because we love garlic.   One of my new "go to" recipes.

wow, what a great and easy dish.  I'm not a mushroom fan so had no clue what type of mushroom to buy - ended up with a portabella and everyone liked it.  Did not alter recipe and will definitely make it again.  We served it over pasta and it was a huge hit.

After reading the reviews I made a few changes.  I only cooked the chicken for 5 minutes on each side.  I doubled the wine and chicken broth and thickened it with a little flour.  I will also add more mushrooms the next time.  I really enjoyed it and will make it again. Thanks tdonoso

I doubled the recipe (serving 7 people) but otherwise prepared the dish as written, aside from needing more butter and oil than called for to cook the chicken (in a cast-iron skillet). We served this over basmati rice and there were no leftovers.

Next time I will follow other reviewers' recommendations to double the wet ingredients, as we would all have liked more sauce. Will definitely make this again.
