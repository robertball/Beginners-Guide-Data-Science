This was a very good recipe. I had read the reviews about it being a little dry so I added a 1/2 cup more eggnog and a packet of vanilla instant pudding to the mix. It did the trick! It was so moist, everyone loved it! Will make this a Chriatmas treat from now on! Thanks!

I LOVE THIS BREAD! I have made it in mini-muffins, regular muffins, mini loaves and regular loaves. I have added many different flavorings in stead of the rum flavoring. I have made coconut eggnog bread, orange eggnong bread, (tastes like a creamsicle!), lemon, chocolate, maple, butter. The possibilities are endless. After Christmas I buy eggnog (when it goes on sale) I then separate it into 1 cup measurements. I freeze them so I can make this bread in the middle of summer. It dosen't change the flavor or texture of the eggnog. This is an awesome bread and will be making it many times. I also use pumpkin pie spice instead of just nutmeg, It's really good that way too. It does dry out quickly, but all that means it that you have to eat more of it!

The best "holiday" quick bread! Cream butter with sugar and add 3 tablespoons
oil to improve moisture. A very soft almost cake like bread. 
My 3 yr. old son loves this bread as well as the whole family. Very easy
to make.

I took the advice from other reviewers and added a small package of vanilla pudding, increased the egg nog to 1 1/3 cup, and used 2 T. of real rum. The bread was delicous. It has more of a pound cake consistency than a bread. I'll be making this every Christmas from now on.

This bread rocks.  I doubled the nutmeg (heavy on the nutmeg when I drink eggnog) and it turned out great.  This is a BIG hit during Christmas season.

Update:  found an Eggnog Glaze to add to this bread if desired.  Eggnog Glaze:  2 c confec sugar, 2 T butter (softened), 1 t vanilla, 3+ T eggnog.

In med bowl mix all glaze ingred except eggnog.  Add in 3T (or more) eggnog until glaze reaches desired consistency.   With butter knife apply over completely cooled loaf.  (see pic I've uploaded to this recipe page with the glaze on it)

The problem with this recipe is not in the ingredients, but in the directions. For those complaining that the bread was too dry and too dense, the problem occurs in your mixing stage. You need to cream the butter with the sugar first, this is very important in incorporating air into the mixture. The leavening agent can only enhance air that is already in the batter, it cannot create much "new air". Sugar is hygroscopic and absorbs a lot of water, by creaming the butter with the sugar, you coat the sugar with fats, preventing the sugar from stealing water from rest of the batter - this is why you have a dry bread. Also, I see some people saying they should add baking soda to enhance the recipe, don't do this. You don't have anything acidic to neutralize the baking soda, therefore you cannot create CO2. For those complaining it was bland, have you used freshly grated nutmeg? Ground nutmeg is very bitter and loses its volatile oils very quickly thus losing flavour.

Great eggnog flavor; very moist. I did not hink it needed any glaze. Do make these changes: 2C eggnog ; 1/2 butter & 1/2 oil instead of butter only; 1/2 t. nutmeg; 1 box INSTANT vanilla pudding (added dry).

Wow!  This is so good; it will be become a new holiday staple. Extremely flavorable and VERY moist.   After reading through a lot of reviews and combining various ideas, here were my modifications:
*  Increased eggnog to 1-1/2 cups
*  Used 3 Tbl dark rum instead of the extract
*  Increased vanilla to 2 tsp.
*  Instead of 1/2 c butter, I used 1/4 c butter plus 1/4 cup oil
*  Doubled the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.
*  Added 1 packet (from 3.4 oz box) of vanilla pudding powder and sifted it in with the flour.
*  I creamed the sugar, oil & butter until it was light and fluffy before adding the eggs, etc.  I added the eggs one at a time, mixing between eggs.
*  Added a glaze - it came out very thick like a frosting, but melted into a nice glaze when spread on the hot bread.  I used 1/2 c powdered sugar, 1-1/2 tsp butter, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1-1/2 Tbl eggnog and 1-1/2 tsp rum.  (Note: it made a plenty of glaze for a thin layer.)  After the bread came out of the oven I let it sit for about 5 minutes, then poked some holes in it with a cake tester and spread a thin layer of the glaze on top. 

I got 4 full mini loaves out of this.  I left a little bit of room when filling the pans to allow room for the glaze, and they came out nice and rounded on top.  

Can not tell you how delicious and moist and flavorful this is!  It's fairly sweet with the glaze, so it's filling.  But we thought the glaze added great flavor.

With the previous notes about it being dry, I added 3 tbsps. oil.  That did the trick.  Very moist and yummy.

This is one of my favorite holiday recipes.  The original recipe I used had no extracts or nutmeg in it and has a cup of drained, whole maraschino cherries and a half cup of chopped nuts.  I drizzle the cooled loaves with a glaze made of eggnog and powdered sugar, and if I'm giving it away, I decorate the glazed top with a cluster or two of halved cherries (rinsed and patted dry)(cut side down) and green candied cherries cut into slivers to resemble leaves arranged in threes around the cherries.  I have also seen these loaves made in clean, greased cans (15 to 18 oz) and the domed top decorated as described above. (Remove from can by using a can opener on the bottom.)

This is a really good recipe. I did add a small box of vanilla pudding and I increased the eggnog to 1 1/3 c. I baked it 55min but I think I should have taken it out at 50min since the edges are crunchy - not burnt - but crunchy. I added a glaze to the top and I am glad I did because it really adds to the flavor of the bread. For my glaze I mixed 1c of powdered sugar and added rum extract and eggnog until I liked the consistency and flavor I liked. I will make this again but bake it a little less. I added a picture with the glaze :-)

I made about 10 of these for people I work with.  The only change I made was using Spiced Rum instead of Rum extract, because I did not have the rum extract.  Waiting to hear from them, but I would definitely give it 4 stars, great Christmas morning with coffee.

GREAT recipe!  Per earlier reviews, I used only 2c of flour, and added 1/3c of sour cream--perfect!  Ended up moist, golden brown, holding its shape really well...be sure to grease the pan well--it can stick a bit..and may not take as much time to bake. Thanks!

the flavor of the bread is actually very good, but it's a rather dry bread.  I think if I make this again I'll try poking a lot of holes in the loaf and adding a kind of glaze (made with rum of course!), and wrapping it in foil for a few days.

I can not say enough good things about this bread!!...However, I did change some things about this recipe (because so many people complained that it was dry).  I added an extra 1/2 c eggnog, decreased the flour to 2 cups, added 1 small box instant vanilla pudding mix to the batter, and used 1/4 c butter + 1/4 c oil instead of the whole 1/2 c butter.  I creamed the butter, sugar and oil until they were very fluffy before I added the rest of the ingredients.  Also, I did not have any rum extract, so I just used 2-3 tbs of the real stuff instead ;)  The finished product turned out to be very moist and sooooo yummy! I made a delicious eggnog glaze to go on top, which realllllly adds to this bread.    Glaze: 1c confectioners' sugar, then mix in eggnog and rum until you reach your desired consistency and taste (add a healthy amount of rum, you will be happy that you did).    The glaze and this bread together were amazing! Next time I might try a flavored eggnog and see how it turns out :~)

Love love love this. I suspected that whisking softened butter into that liquid mixture would result in little lumps of unincorporated butter (it did), and I feared this would result in funky-textured bread with holes and greasy spots, but it’s perfect – perfect balance of dense and fluffy, and it’s perfectly moist. I didn’t have eggnog on hand, so I substituted a half-and-half mixture of milk and cream, since the eggnog doesn’t contribute much in the way of flavor anyway; the bread’s flavor comes from the rum extract and nutmeg. In fact, I'd suggest this swap to anyone getting dry results; mine really is fantastically moist. The bread wasn't overly sweet, which I loved, and I suspect using eggnog would've made it sweeter. Definitely a keeper.

This bread has been quite popular with my friends and family! My changes: I added the pkg of vanilla pudding, increased the eggnog by 1/3cup, and subbed oil for the butter. That made for a nice, moist loaf. I also added one 10 oz jar of maraschino cherries; drained and chopped, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Stir 1/4 cup of the flour with the cherries and nuts before adding them to the batter. That will help keep them from sinking to the bottom of the pan. If you like eggnog flavor, up the nutmeg a bit, or use freshly grated for a great flavor boost! We make a lot of mini loaves for gift giving. This is one for the recipe box, and we will use it over and over. Thanks!

This recipe as directed is worth 3 stars.  I got it to 5 stars by using these ingredients with my basic poundcake technique instead.  Cream the butter and sugar, alternate adding the eggs & eggnog with the dry ingredients, ending with liquids.  Its very yummy with dried cranberries or dried cherries added. I also used spiced rum, about 1/2 cup.

Delicious!  I made several loaves for Christmas gifts and everyone loved them.  I actually preferred the taste when I used light egg nog.  Definately made my list of "must makes" during the holidays.

Yum!  Made 4 small loaves, baked at 350 for about 45 mins or so (kept adding 3 mins, lost track of how many times.) :) Per other reviews, used 1 1/2 cups egg nog, doubled the nutmeg, and added a box of vanilla pudding.  Used the glaze on the cooled loaves, but only made 1/2 & it was plenty - used 1 c powdered sugar, 1 T butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract & about 1/4 cup egg nog (give or take depending on consistency.)  Next time, I may glaze them when they are still warm, and poke holes in the top first to let the glaze seep into the bread.

I first made this bread about 4 years ago after finding the recipe on Allrecipes.com.  My family now is positive that it is a tradition going back many years!  I use about 1/3 of a cup of spiced rum in it to add more rum flavor to the eggnog.

Great recipe!!  I used vanilla spice eggnog, omitted the rum extract because I didn't have it, added vanilla pudding dry mix and increased the eggnog a bit.  Awesome!

This is like an eggnog pound cake - it is just fabulous!!!  I followed the recipe, but added a glaze made with powdered sugar, rum extract, and nutmeg.  Wonderful bread to have during the holidays.

Delicious recipe! I added 1/4 cup of buttermilk- this made a beautiful, moist bread with a very nice texture. I also added the "drunken cranberries" (dried cranberries soaked in rum) and that really added a festive touch. If you enjoy your bread sweeter, more like cake, drizzle with a simple butter, rum, and powder sugar frosting. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

The bread was pretty good; however, it was a little on the dry side.

I loved this, the eggnog flavor is wonderful.  I added the extra eggnog and extra nutmeg like some of the others here.  It was easy and delicious.

Used black walnut extract instead of rum extract because I don't like that flavor in baked goods. Suggest creaming the butter and sugar first, then adding eggs, eggnog, extract and sugar.

Really yummy! First I made a few adjustments to this recipe. I used 1 and 1/2cups of the premixed holiday nog (rum already in it) and only 2 cups of flour. I also added  a 1/4 cup of a powdered egg nog (like hot chocolate) I already had in the cupboard. It may be kind hard to find but a tsp of egg nog flavoring would work too. This bread turned out so moist and I the strong rum flavor the holiday nog gave it. I cut the loaf into small cubes and dipped them in vanilla almond bark. They are like homemade rum/nog petit fours! So good! Also they taste expensive ;-).
*please note if you do not like the taste of rum this version is not for you. The holiday nog has a higher rum content and adds quite a bit of rum flavor.

We made this recipe last night, but made a few changes that were suggested by other reviewers. We added 1/2 cup more eggnog, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg,2 Tbsp real dark rum, and a packet of vanilla pudding mix. It tasted really good-not to sweet, and stayed moist. We are definitely going to make a couple more loaves, but we have decided to add even a bit more nutmeg. We also decided if we were to give as gifts or to put on a baking tray we would probably add a nice glaze with eggnog, and nutmeg!

Excellent - after we changed a few things... the first batch was a little flat and dry, but the flavor was wonderful. So, we added more baking powder and more butter... used real rum instead of extract. We have made MANY batches this Christmas... given many away for gifts (only to have them come back begging to know how we made it!) My sister and I thought we would try another batch soon and maybe add MACADAMIAS and possibly white choc. chips !?!? Yummy.

This was good but the eggnog taste wasn't very strong in the bread.  I did use 1 1/3 cup eggnog and a small packet of instant vanilla pudding.  I also topped with the eggnog frosting/glaze - we liked that.  Not sure if I'll make again or not.

I made several of the suggested changes to this recipe (decreased sugar to 3/4 cup, used 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil, decreased flour to 2 cups, used 1 tbsp. of spiced rum and increased nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.).  It turned out great with a nice, subtle eggnog flavor (not too overpowering) and very moist.  Next time, I will decrease the sugar further to 1/2 cup as it's still a little too sweet for me (the egg nog alone is pretty sweet).  Baked in 3 mini loaf pans for 35 minutes.

Awesome eggnog bread with modifications.  My office ate up the loaf in less than 45 minutes this morning.  I added a box of vanilla pudding mix (only had sugar free on hand and used that), extra half cup of eggnog, used 2 cups of flour, 3 tsp rum extract, 2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  It was incredibly moist and flavorful this way.

Following previous reviews, I made these changes:  increased sugar (to 1 1/3 c) & nutmeg (to 1/2 tsp), dropped flour to 2c, added 2 Tblsp veggie oil plus a splash of vanilla.  Used 3 tsp real rum, rather than extract.  Made 3 3x5 pans ~ had perfect eggnog flavor (which improved over a few days) but was a bit dry.  My picky kindergartener couldn't get enough of it, however!  I would make this again but tinker around a bit more with the ingredients.

Excellent bread!  Did add 1/4 cup more eggnog as suggested by others.  Also added 1/2 to 2/3 cup chopped pecans.
  The recipe made enough batter for 4 mini loaves which baked done in 30 minutes.  The second time, it was baked in two 8" x 3 3/4" x 2 3/8" pans and were baked for about 50 - 55 minutes.
  Will try the suggestion of adding cranberries to this the next time it is made.  
  Definitely a keeper.  Thank You, Bev.

This recipe is perfect for Christmas gift giving.  I usually add a cup of fresh cranberries, which really makes it ideal for the holiday season.  Now, friends are disappointed if they DON'T receive it!

LOVED this bread!  After reading the other suggestions I did increase the egg nog to 1 1/2 cups and I used 2 Tbsp of Bacardi's white rum instead of the extract.  It was so moist and delicious.  It was more like a pound cake, sweet enough for a dessert.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Made this as muffins and it came out better. I tried the bread first and it got very crusty and dry.  I did all the ingredients as listed but then added the package of vanilla pudding based on other reviewers. I did not use oil. I also added a tad more rum and nutmeg since I like the taste. I made it with 1 1/2 c of eggnog since adding the pudding added more mix so needed to add more liquid. I did use the hand mixer because the butter chunks were too big by hand. Baked in muffin tins for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. It made 23-24 muffins

I read other reviewers, and this didn't come out dry at all. Very addictive. I used a soy milk based egg nog and it was great, ate up within 24 hours.

Great Christmas recipe but blend the butter with the sugar first until fluffy, then add the eggs and liquids... won't have any lumps and the bread will be moist and tender.

The original recipe is a bit dry, as others have stated so I tried it again with the mods suggested and got a great texture and taste, perfect for snacking.  And then we turned the first loaf into sensationally delish french toast with strawberry sauce!

This recipe was amazing! I made it for my family to use up some eggnog and it was gone within the first night. I'm about to make it again since my mom went out and bought more eggnog so I could make some more! I followed other reviewer's tips and added two tablespoons of canola oil; it came out wonderfully dense and moist. I also doubled the nutmeg and used a tablespoon of rum instead of the rum-flavored extract.

This was so easy to put together!

I used a cup of the Easiest Eggnog from
this site in this recipe. Everything
went together so well. This recipe made
one big loaf. It was done in about an hour, give or take, but I had to put
a piece of tented foil over the top so the bread wouldn't burn on top. After it had cooled, I made a quick vanilla-rum glaze and drizzled it over the top to really make it extra tasty. This reminds me somewhat of the pound cake that my grandmother used to make when I was a kid. It would make a great gift bread or breakfast bread. I like this bread. So did my kids and husband.

This is such an easy recipe for such a yummy bread. The last time I made it, I was out of rum extract so I just left it out and used more vanilla and it was still just as good. This is one of those recipes you would have to work hard at to mess up because, it comes out good each time.

This recipe is wonderful! I have a litre of eggnog left in my fridge that I need to get rid of so I thought I'd try out this recipe. The only thing I did differently was make muffins instead of a loaf. I also used more eggnog but it still wasn't as eggnog-y as I would have liked so I mixed together eggnog and icing sugar to glaze over the muffins. Delicious!

I modified the recipe some, and it was great!  Very flavorful from the minute it came out of the oven.  My modifications - used canola oil in place of butter, used 2 cups flour, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tbsp rum (not extract).  I also followed a more traditional method - cream fat & sugar, add eggs individual.  Sift together dry ingredients.  Add flavorings then alternate dry ingredients with eggnog.

After reading the experience others had with this recipe, I worried about a texture problem.  I believe that adding oil is not necessarily the answer for a dry texture. But I love eggnog so I gave this a try. I followed the recipe exactly except that I added 1/4 cup buttermilk to the ingredient list. The bread came out dense, moist and flavorful. Next time, I will add a bit more buttermilk, as the batter could be thinned more. Thanks to the previous reviewers for the heads-up about the texture.

What a great way to use up left over egg nog. This bread is delicious!  I increased the amount of rum extract to 1 tbsp, and used 1 tsp of nutmeg.  This gave the loaf more flavour, and tasted even more like egg nog.  Thanks Bev for a recipe I will no doubt use often.

Very good bread.  We made and gave out several during the holidays, and everyone seemed to enjoy them.

I did like the flavor but thought it was much too dry for our liking. Will change some things to make it more moist next time.  But I certainly don't know what people are raving about this one for.

I make this recipe every year and give mini loaves as gifts. I did not change any ingredients and it always turns out perfectly. Technique is very important. Cream the butter and sugar first. Works best if the butter is very soft - room temp. Instructions say "stir just enough to moisten." Do not over stir. That will affect the texture. Definitely do not over bake. I only use unsalted butter. Just a taste preference. Butter has a definite flavor when baking, so if you substitute with other fats, the rum extract may seem too strong.

Loved this recipe! I had some leftover eggnog from the holidays that I didn't want to go to waste and found this recipe. It had a great flavor and was very moist. Next time I might cut back on the rum extract a little because it was pretty strong. I also added a glaze over the top which definitely sealed in the moisture. 

The glaze recipe is: 2 cups of confectioners sugar and 6 tablespoons of eggnog. I would recommend adding the eggnog in gradually so the glaze does not get too liquidy.

After reading the reviews I used dark rum instead of extract and added 2 T of oil and an extra 1/2 cup of eggnog.  I had light eggnog on hand and followed the cake-making method of creaming the butter and sugar and then adding the eggs, one at a time, then the extract and rum.  The flour and eggnog were added in alternating parts and I ended up with enough batter for my two 6-cup bundt pans.  A very moist and delicious cake resulted so I'm not going to call this a bread.  It is not overly sweet but the idea of an eggnog glaze sounds wonderful and I'll try that next time.  I think it would also make a lovely base for a trifle or even a holiday version of tiramisu.  I'll make it every time I have leftover eggnog from now on.

Pretty good!  I substituted a few things.  Used half a cup of sugar, 1/4 oil 1/4 butter (in place of 1/2 cup melted butter), used Silk Soy Milk Eggnog, and whole wheat flour, and it still came out yum! :D

When I first tried this I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but the more I ate the more I liked it. I finished off two loaves practically by myself. lol. I did follow other reviews and added oil and about half a cup more eggnog. Delish!

I followed the most of the recipe except added 2 tbsp.  canola/veg oil and subbed 1/4 cup bourbon for rum extract. The result was nicely moist bread and rich--like pound cake!

This was the first time I had made this recipe. Only I made a few minor changes to add more flavour. I tried adding 3 teaspoons of rum extract, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. It was full of all the flavours and was delicious. I also followed somebody elses comment on adding 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil to make it more moist and it worked. I created my own butter rum eggnog glaze to drizzle on top and it was delicious. I am hoping to post the recipe and share it with everyone!

I followed other recommendations. 2 cups flour 1 1/2 cups eggnog No rum 1/2 cup white sugar (1 is too sweet) 3/4 cup butter 1 tbsp canola oil 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg I followed the recipe for the rest. It turns out like a pound cake, no hint of eggnog at all! But it is still tasty and moist.

This bread is so yummy and super simple.  I almost have it memorized I have made it so many times this holiday season.  My husband loves it and I made about 5 loaves for the freezer before eggnog went away.    The only things I did was add a package of sugar-free, fat-free vanilla pudding to the dry ingredients and instead of the butter I used 1/4cup canola oil and 1/4cup applesauce.  I also only use about 3/4cup sugar.  Always takes 60 minutes in my oven.

I loved this bread so much I bought a bunch of eggnog on sale after Christmas and froze it so I wouldn't have to wait a whole year to make this again.  It was to die for!  I wasn't sure if the eggnog flavor would come through in a baked good, but it was very flavorful and delicious.  The first time I made it, I went ahead and added the 3 T oil some suggested, but I think it actually came out TOO moist that way and the bottom sort of condensed on itself, if that makes sense.  The second time I made it I went with the way it is written, and found it much better.  Perhaps in a dry climate or in the summer it might need the oil, but a winter day in CA didn't need it. I am sooooo adding this to my baked good gift baskets next year!!

This bread is delicious and perfect for the holidays!  I took this to the office, and it was gone in 30 minutes!  Following the advice of other reviewers, I made a few changes - used 1 1/3 cups eggnog, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 3 tsp. actual rum, added 2 tbl vegetable oil, and reduced flour to 2 cups.  It came out perfectly!

After reading a bunch of reviews, I made the following changes -  1/4 C Butter & 1/4 C Canola oil for 1/2 cup butter, used 3 tsp of dark rum instead of extract, added 1/2 more egg nog & a dash more vanilla.  Be sure to cream butter & sugar before you add rest of wet ingredients.  I've made 15 small loaves this season & everyone has loved it.  The longer it sits the better it tastes.  Unfortunately, I've only tasted a few slices but plan on changing that once this last batch comes out of the oven.  Enjoy!

Good bread. Very dense like pound cake. The eggnog flavor could be a little stronger for my taste.  I will make it again though - just think I will add a little extra nutmeg, rum, and eggnog.

excellent flavor. I don't know why I didn't listen to the other reviewers as I normally do, because they were right, it's a little dry, but I'm not offended, it tasted awesome. If you don't like things too sweet, there's no need for glaze at all, and you may consider cutting down on the sugar.

Bread is delicious - but had to bake 1 hr 20 mins. to bake middle.   At 55 min., put a foil "tent" over to prevent crust from burning.  Have made it 4 times now.  Used 9 x 5 pan once, then tried 8.5 x 4.5 pan - still took 1 hr. 20 min.  May try smaller loaf pans the next time.

This was delicious! I coated with powdered sugar icing. Couldn't find rum extract, so I added a couple of tablespoons of rum. Our holiday guests loved it.

I was very disappointed in this bread.  It was dry, and flavorless.  I even added the 3 TBS of oil that other reviewers suggested to help with the dryness, and I don't feel it helped.  If I were to make this again, I think I would double the amount of nutmeg called for, and I don't know what to do to make it less dry.  Maybe add more eggnog??

This bread is awesome! I too made a few modifications. As suggested by other reviewers I used pudding mix and 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil. I used butterscotch schnapps instead of rum and sprinkled the top of the bread with nutmeg before baking. Will be making for years to come. Thanks Bev!

Pretty  good, but like the others, I added another 1/2 cup of eggnog, some cinnamon, did half butter, half coconut oil, and instead of all flour, I used half regular flour and half brown rice flour. Also omitted the rum essence and used extra vanilla extract. Added unsweetened coconut flakes and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Very moist and subtly decadent.

This was absolutely amazing!  Everyone loved this bread and it was the first to disappear from holiday trays, including chocolate-dipped cookies!    I froze the loaves and took them out as needed.  The tops of the thawed loaves were a little gooey so I pressed them into turbinado sugar and this gave a lovely crunch to the tops of the slices.    Perfect, just perfect!

I took advise from several reviews. Do add the pudding mix and a 1/2 cup more eggnog. I also threw in a teaspood of cinnamon. Try cutting it in half (length wise), rub inside with spiced rum and then glaze with eggnog frosting/glaze. Makes a nice pound cake.

Rated a 4 because, it does need some moisture added.  It is very good!!  I added 3 tablespoons of oil and 1/2 cup more of eggnog.  I also put a eggnog glaze on it.  Everyone loves it.  Thanks!

I could not get this recipe to work out! Followed the recipe exactly twice. I added some baking soda on the third try to get it to raise up a little in the center, but it was so dry I ended up throwing that batch away also.  I love eggnog and think this would be a great treat, can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

This is really good. I did not have any rum extract, so I substituted for rum;(1 Tsp Rum Extract= 3 TBSP of Rum) It has the right blend of ingredients and a nice hint of a spiked eggnog drink in a bite! ;)

SOOO good!  I followed the suggestion to increase eggnog to 1.5 cups and add a small packet of vanilla pudding.  I made muffins (12, but they were big) and they baked for 27 min.  UPDATE:  I did not cream the butter and sugar first and my muffins were ugly!  Definitely cream your butter and sugar.

I loved this recipe with a couple of adjustments.  Increased eggnog to 1 1/3 c., used 2 T. rum instead of extract and added the vanilla pudding packet that another reviewer suggested.  This was excellent and almost resembled a nice pound cake, with it's consistency.

First let me say this tasted pretty good.  I followed the suggestion of others by increasing the eggnog to 1 1/3 c but didn't change anything else.  It wasn't very sweet and it was very moist and dense.  I think that may have been what confused me most.  It had the same density and moistness of a pound cake but it wasn't sweet like one.  I think I'll try to morph this into more of a pound cake but I do want to add my husband doesn't like stuff that is too sweet and he devoured this (which he never does).

Made this just before Christmas and got some mixed reviews. Those that love eggnog in my famly devoured it; others complained that it was too heavy. I think if you're an eggnog fan you'll enjoy it.

This bread was a big hit at a holiday party.  Based on the other reviews, I added an extra 1/4 cup of eggnog and 2tbs of oil to combat the dryness.  I also used cinnamon flavored eggnog.  Great recipe!

Delicious!  I did add vanilla instant pudding mix and more nutmeg and just an 1/8cup more eggnog but 1/2 cup more was too much!  Baked for 40-45 mins using 3- (mini) 3x5 pans.  I will keep making this recipe every Christmas from now on!

Very Good, moist bread.  I made one loaf, and six muffin tops.  This bread is great toasted.  Only 4 stars because it didn't really taste as much like eggnog as I would have hoped. Also, I used fresh grated nutmeg and a shot (or two) of rum instead of rum extract. Oh, and added about 1/4 more of eggnog. Happy Baking!

This bread was all right.  I did have a little flavor of eggnog.  I added a little extra oil, and it wasn't too dry, but not as moist as I would have liked.  I may add more nutmed to get a stronger egg-nog flavor.  Very thick and heavy bread, My husband said it was like eating a pound cake.  My family liked it, but nit exactly what I am looking for.  I may or maynot make this bread again, I will decide next christmas!

Great tasting and easy to make.  My daughter loved it.  I used the oil but it still came out kind of on the dry side but I think that was my fault.  I am trying to get used to a new gas oven, I am surprised I didn't burn it.  I will make this recipe again.

I followed the suggestion of adding an extra half cup of egg nog and a small box of vanilla cook and serve pudding (I didn't do instant).  It came out perfect!  It stayed moist even after being cut, and got race reviews from everyone who tried it!  a double batch made 8 or 9 mini loaves.

I made this recipe last night adding 1/2 extra eggnog and packet of pudding as suggested.  I wanted to make small 5 X 3 loaves.  The recipe suggest that you can make 3 of them, but with the additional ingredients I would suggest 4.  They rose much higher than they should out of the pans and did not present well.  Also it took much longer to bake them than the suggested baking time for a small loaf.

As it is written it is four stars. I always use an extra half of a cup of eggnog and at least one of the following add ins. Try adding any or all of these:  a box of instant vanilla pudding mix, a half cup of milk chocolate chips, a cup of unsweetened shredded coconut, double the vanilla extract or double the nutmeg. I always buy the nog with the rum already in it but extract works fine.Also, I prefer to make with coconut oil instead of butter.

Really nice loaf and quite easy to make. I took the advice of other reviewers and added an extra 1/2 cup of egg nog and vanilla instant pudding. Turned out quite well! It also seemed to taste better after a couple days in the fridge. Only thing I was just a little disapponted about is that it could still have a stronger egg nog flavour. I'll probably use 2 cups next time plus extra nutmeg. All in all though, it was extremely well received by the family and guests!

i loved it with most of the changes i made.
For each loaf i melted the butter and added 3TB veg oil. upped the rum to 2TB and added 1/2t baking soda.  So all the wet into a bowl (except for the eggnog) sifted all dry in another.  Beat the wet for a minute. then alternated the flour mix with the eggnog. I had a double batch so 2 9x5 pans about 47-50 mins @ 350.  I then melted 1/4C butter in a saucepan and added 1/2C sugar and 1/4C both OJ and triple sec.  When bread was finished let them cool for 5 mins then i poured this over the TWO breads while still in the pans.  I did poke some holes in the breads too.  Let it cool for about 30 mins and turned them out.  That will keep em moist.

Used the last of my light eggnog on this today! Turned out very good with the help of others reviews. I creamed 1/4C. butter with the sugar, vanilla, eggs & eggnog (added an additional 1/2C. eggnog). Streamed in 1/4C. canola oil. Added my sifted ingredients which included a small package of instant vanilla pudding. I didn't use any rum or rum extract, still turned out great! I ended up needing 4 mini loaf pans & I did use a simple thin glaze of powdered sugar & a little eggnog. Very moist & delicious!

This recipe is very good! I realized after I'd started that my bottle of rum extract was empty, so I used 2 tsp. Bacardi instead. That was the only substitution I made. I made 3 small loaves. I have no idea why people are complaining that this bread is dry, unless they over-baked it. Mine was very moist.  It does take a lot longer to bake than expected, though. Thanks for the recipe!
EDIT 1/2/16:  I have made this recipe twice more, and I am convinced that the people who say the bread is dry are overbaking it. Every time, the bread has been very moist. Make the recipe AS WRITTEN, folks. It doesn't need a thing, I promise.
EDIT AGAIN 12/14/17:  I solved the issue of the little clumps of butter suspended in the egg/sugar mixture. Just use standard procedure - cream butter and sugar, add eggs and rum extract, then alternate mixing in flour/nutmeg/baking powder with the egg nog.

I used the ingredients as listed, but I creamed the butter and sugar together, blended in the wet ingredients, then whisked together the dry ingredients in a separate bowl, and mixed the wet and dry ingredients together. Instead of loaves, I made 12 large muffins. They were perfectly done in 20 minutes and not dry at all; maybe because they don't have to bake nearly as long as loaves. They tasted great and had a texture more like a light cake than a muffin.

I wanted to love this, but it turn out as good as I'd hoped.  I had to bake it for 1hr and 15 min.  It was really hard/crunchy on the outside and hard to cut through.

The flavor of this bread is very good but you need to add something extra ti make it moist.  I would suggest 1/2 c of plain Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup of extra sugar.

I would have rated this recipe higher had it been clearer about the order of adding ingredients. Be sure to CREAM THE BUTTER AND SUGAR TOGETHER before adding the other wet ingredients to the batter! Otherwise, it will be very difficult to incorporate the butter into the wet mixture. I added the butter last, because it came last in the list of wet ingredients. The bread had little craters inside, where tiny pieces of butter had been trapped, then melted. The texture was a little dry and rubbery. The butter welled up at the top of the pan and set off my smoke alarm. I should have known better.

This sweet bread/cake recipe is great and easy to make. OK, I took the other reviewers advice about the dryness.  I didn't like all the fat from the butter and oil(as some said to do), so I used 1/2 c soften butter and 1/2 c light sour cream.  I didn't have any dry vanilla pudding so I couldn't do that.  I didn't have any rum extract so I left that out too.  I upped the nutmeg to 1/2 T and the eggnog to 1 1/2 cups.  This sweet bread, almost cake like, turned out DELISH!!  I didn't have loaf pans, so I used my square brownie pan, only took 24 min to cook.  I also added red and green sprinkles to make the mini cakes more festive.  I also added choc. chips to some and coconut.  I also did some w/ a caramel syrup swirl w/ a caramel kiss hidden in the middle.

OK, so I tried this recipe adding in the vanilla pudding mix, and made them into cupcakes so I could take them to work. Not one complaint, everyone loved it, and were asking me for the recipe, of course I directed them to all recipes. Thank you so much for a terrific recipe. The cupcakes were cooked for 20 minutes, filled 3/4 of the way, and it came out moist and perfect. Topped with powdered sugar....Delicious.

This bread was a hit in my household!  I had read the reviews about it being a little dry so I added a 1/2 cup more eggnog and a packet of vanilla instant pudding to the mix ( as per someone else's recipe "tweek" ) and it came out beautifully!

This came out very moist and flavorful. Made exactly as recipe calls for except I accidentally added about 2 T more of butter. For the next time I will probably cut back or eliminate the nutmeg since i'm not a big fan of the flavor. Next time I'll prob increase the rum. I used the real stuff not extract. Very good recipe! EASY

This bread is fantastic! I always, always read reviews for any recipe I find online and I followed everyone's suggestions for keeping this a moist bread. I used 2 cup of flour, a packet of vanilla instant pudding,  1 1/4 cup eggnog, and I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil for good measure. In addition to a loaf, this recipe made 4 "cupcakes" for me, my husband, my son, and my daughter and I coated those with an eggnog glaze that a previous reviewer suggested. I used a little bit of cream cheese in the glaze as well and the consistency was more of an icing that glaze, which I prefer. I needed to cook this for 55 min for the middle to set fully and at that point the sides and top were starting to burn. May try the "tenting" method next time. Tasted delicious nonetheless, this one is a keeper! Now that it passed the "family test", it's on to making this for friends and coworkers!

What an awesome idea! I made these at Christmas time and just now got around to reviewing it. Very tasty bread and just perfect for the holidays! I baked them as directed and then when they came out brushed them lightly with melted butter and sprinkled them with a mixture of sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg. SO GOOD!

I make this into muffins instead of a loaf. To avoid it being dry, as others have experienced, I use 1/2 a cup of veg oil instead of butter, and add a banana or two. My kids LOVE them.

Delicious and very moist.  I tweaked only a little. Instead of butter, I used applesauce.  And I used one egg instead of two.  I baked it for 600 mins and let it stand for 10 then served it.  My daughter dislikes breads but with this one she took a huge chunk.  It went fast.  I will make it again.

I loved this bread and so did my family. I brought it over for Christmas and it was devoured. In reading other reviews I creamed the butter with the sugar and added 3 tbs of vegetable oil to make it more moist. It worked perfectly. I made large loaves and mini loaves and both were divine.

used small packet of instant vanilla, added maybe 1tbsp vege oil (healthy dash to be specific) and 1/2 cup extra egg nog. otherwise, made as written. Had to cook longer because of the extra liquid, maybe a total of 60 minutes (started w/40, went 5 minutes more, 5 more, 4 more, etc)Smelled like choc. chip cookies while baking (now i have to make cc cookies for a disappointed hubby). Turned out moist and flavorful. I could taste the egg nog so I wasn't sure if hubby would like, but he seemed to enjoy it.

The bread was good, maybe it was the brand of eggnog I used but it didn't taste very much like eggnog even though I doubled the eggnog. I also added double nutmeg and some cinnamon. The bread was moist, probably due to the extra eggnog. My kids liked it, so I'll probably make it again.

Very good and pretty quick to whip up. I made this in my bread maker and it turned out really moist with a 1/2 cup more eggnog in the mix. My family really loves it but it is so very sweet they would only take one piece of it a day.

Not that good...It might have been better if I used completely melted butter rather than just softened.  The butter did not mix well.  Also this bread does not taste much like eggnog.  In addition, I added extra nutmeg and even some cinnamon and we could hardly tell that there were spices present.  This is a little bland for me.

Really yummy bread, and very simple to make. I added a little cinnamon because I just love cinnamon. Also, mine turned out a little dry, even with adding a couple extra tablespoons of oil. But other reviewers commented that it got better after a couple days, so I'll try another bite tomorrow...and the next day... And next time I bake it, I'll add a little more moisture somehow...maybe oil or a bit more egg nog.

I had high hopes for this, but it was pretty bland--tasted like yellow cake to me (which is good but not when you're expecting a quick bread). It doesn't keep very well either.

I took the advice of some of the other cooks and used 1/2 oil and 1/2 butter and added a small box of instant vanilla pudding.  My family loved it.

Was a bit dry, but it was really good if you dip it in milk or eggnog when eating it.  Didn't read through all the comments before I tried it.  I'm going ot have to try it again next year, making the changes other people suggested.

Wow, this turned out great!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and only vanilla for flavour.  I am amazed at how well the cake baked.  My husband had his piece with peanut butter.  Great late night snack.

read all the review,excellent
made following changes as per reviews
2 cups of flour
1/2 t fresh grated nutmeg
1 1/4 cup eggnog
1/3 cup sour cream
very moist, will make again, next time I will try the instant pudding to see if any better. I didn't have any on hand.  My husband doen't want me to make any changes.  I made 3 mini loafs cooked for 35 minutes.  The pans were the dark ones, so I placed it on a cookie sheet, because it cooks faster.

I was excited for this bread because it is SO different.  I thought it came out bad, didn't taste that great and was very pound cake like.  I would not make it again.

I poured 1 1/3 c.eggnog then filled the measure cup with oil to the 1 1/2 c. mark. It came out exceptional!  Very moist and very much like pound cake.  To 1/2 of the batter I added ground walnuts and that was very well received too.

As others suggested I cut the flour to 2 c, increased the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp and I ended up using 1/2 TBSP of rum extract. Almost too dense and sweet to consider it "bread".

I LOVED this bread! The rest of the family thought it was just ok that is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5+. I used 1/4 c coconut rum, extra nutmeg, vanilla and 1&1/3 c eggnog. Increased baking time because of the extra liquid. Will make again and it will be ALL MINE!

I followed the advice of others and used 1 1/3 c. eggnog, 2 c. flour and I used a whole teaspoon of nutmeg.  It turned out really nice.  Very mild tasting - not an overwhelming eggnog flavor.  But I did enjoy it.  I will be making this and pumpkin bread to give away as christmas gifts.

Per reviews, I added 3 tbp of canola oil. I also doubled the nutmeg & still thought it needed more (I like the taste of nutmeg w/ my nog). The batter was quite thick but that might have been due to the eggnog I used (Braum's...the best store bought nog in the world!) so I thinned it out just a bit w/ some milk. I did bake mine in the little loafs so that I could share my goodies. Thanks for a tasty bread Bev!

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars as it was very heavy and dense-good but very heavy. Maybe it was the cook and not the recipe. I made two loaves as recipe directed with no changes. Cooled bread, sliced and drizzled caramel glaze over slices and took to church. They ate it all with compliments, but i think i wouldn't make again as recipe directs. Next time i will try some of the other reviewers suggestions.

This recipe is very good.  I incorporated the changes everyone else made in their reviews below, and the recipe makes a yummy pound cake-type bread.  I added extra nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice, but I would add even more next time.

I wanted to make this recipe "as is" even after reading the reviews.  It turned out a little dry.  I also couldn't taste the eggnog flavor like I was hoping I would.  It's been sitting in my kitchen for 5 days and there's still half a loaf left.  Not a good sign.  Next time I will try adding oil and increasing the eggnog.

wonderful holiday bread! the eggnog flavor is pronounced enough to satisfy me, but subtle enough that it's not overpowering. i added a bit more nutmeg (about 1/2 tsp total). i was hoping -- correctly, it turns out -- that the bread tops would be chewy and slightly crisp, and wanted extra tops, so i baked in 2 8x5" loaf pans, giving 2 shorter loaves. with 2 pans, i baked it for 35 minutes, and it came out perfectly.

I have been making this quick bread for years during the holidays.  I always add more nutmeg and just a little bit more rum extract.  This year I substituted butter flavor Crisco for the butter.  Came out beautiful and tasted great.  I look forward to "eggnog" season to make this easy tradition!

I have tried baking both muffins and bread and both were fabulous.  I did not sprinkle sugar on top as I thought it was sweet enough by itself.  Did not change a thing to the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

not sure if I did something wrong, but this recipe was way too bland.  We could not really taste the eggnog or rum (I used real rum instead of extract)  It had the texture and taste of a plain pound cake.  I'm not sure what I could do to boose the flavour, but I might try to play with it some.  As it stands, only worth a 3 star, sorry.

Oh my lordy that was so yummy!  I had never had eggnog bread before, and that was amazing!  We decided to get a jump start on the holiday baking, and we froze the majority of the batch, it freezed and thaws well.  It was moist and rich and delicious!  The only thing we added to it was a splash of vanilla, and 2TB of actual Rum...151.  Wow!  It was great, will definately make again!

This was perfect. It had the right balance of eggnog and sweetness. Reminded me of the Starbucks eggnog muffins. Yumm!

As with other reviewers...I wanted to use up leftover eggnog and this is a fantastic way to use it up!!!  This is really good stuff.  I served it sliced & slighty toasted with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce...very, very good!  Thank you!

Keeping in mind all the discussion on moistness, I tried the following: increased the eggnog by 1/4 cup and decreased the flour by 1/4 cup.  I used dark rum and 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I got a moist spongy loaf that didn't taste at all like eggnog. It wasn't bad, just not what I was hoping for.  I'll keep working on it because I think there is hope here for something really good.

After years of making this bread and constantly trying to improve the dryness, because I love the flavor, nothing worked. I finally added the pudding and that really helped. But the eggnog flavor isn't as strong. So I suggest increasing the nutmeg.  Making it in mini loaf pans seems to also be more dry. This bread freezes well for make ahead gift giving and I really love it toasted. I have also cooked this in a small bundt pan for fancier presentation and making it more like a cake. I add dried cranberries that have been soaked in rum overnight.

The recipe is missing something. The nutmeg flavor did not stand out nor did the rum. Perhaps it could have been enhanced by drizzling with rum or rum flavored frosting. Otherwise it had a nice texture.

Love this bread.  I too added almost a 1/4 cup of oil and cut it down to 2 cups of flour.  It was perfectly moist.

This is yummy!  It smells and tastes like eggnog.  I lightly toasted it then spread with a touch of butter for a nice breakfast with tea.  If you like eggnog, definitely try this!

This bread was very tasty, but dry as many people said. I fixed it by reducing the flour to 2 cups, increasing the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp, and adding 1 Tbsp of oil. It needed about 10 minutes of extra baking time, but it came out perfectly moist and delicious!

I made this with leftover Eggnog at Christmas time and it was very good.  I took the advice of adding 3 T. oil to the bread.  It had a somewhat crumbly texture, but tasted just like eggnog in bread form.  Very good.

This is a great recipe!  I was up late last night baking four batches to hand out at the office as holiday treats!  It takes very few ingredients and so is easy to whip up.  I baked several small loaves and two large.  The smaller seemed to always turn out with the best color and texture.  The large ones got a little tough on the outside although I tried not to overhandle the dough.  I also made a batch using low fat eggnog which made the bread a little dry.  But other than that, the little loaves turned out wonderfully and I have gotten several compliments today.  Thanks!!

This recipe is a nice change to holiday treats.  I brought this to a potluck and was a hit.  I creamed the sugar with the butter first before adding the rest of the ingredients.  This makes for even moisture throughout the bread.

Very good.  Probably would be even better with regular flour.  All I had was rice flour, so I had to add 4 1/2 tsps of xantham gum.  A little risky, but it worked and the flavor was good.  Probably didn’t rise as much, but would make a good, basically gluten free version if you needed it.

Added extra 1/3 cup Eggnog, Dark Rum instead Rum Extract, about 3 tbsp. oil, instant French Vanilla pudding.  With changes it was a nice moist eggnog pound cake. I baked it for 65 minutes.

Yes, I am one of those people who did not make the recipe "as is" first. I added 1/2 c more of the egg nog and a small packet of vanilla pudding to the dry ingredients.  It was a lot of batter for the the loaf pan I used, so I had to cook it longer than expected before the toothpick came out clean, and it was slightly dark brown on the bottom, but boy was the flavor ever good inside!  I couldn't wait for it to cool completely, had to have the end slice.  Very flavorful and moist.  Cannot wait to have some in the morning. Next time, I will use two pans.  Thankfully, I'll have time to make more since egg nog will be in the markets for a while more.

Delicious! will make great holiday gifts for neighbors and friends. I did make some changes after reading reviews, I used dark rum 2T as I didn't have the extract, used a package of instant pudding and doubled the nutmeg.

I followed the recipe pretty closely and did the suggestion of creaming the butter and sugar together. It baked well and smelled great! After the bread cooled, I had a taste. Nice flavor and texture but I could tell it was dry. Even though I wrapped it and kept it airtight, it was very dry the next morning. Disappointing.

This bread does have a lot of great flavor but as many have stated, it is a bit on the dry side. I even followed the suggestions of mixing the butter and sugar first and I also added 3 TB of oil.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  This bread is more like a pound cake in texture and where I could see this being really great is cut into cubes and used in a chocolate fondue as you generally need dense dippers.  I could also see this being a really great french toast which is what I plan to do with with tomorrow. Certainly a good recipe for the holidays and I think I'll try a few other modifications others mention.  The glaze thing?  This cake already has a whole cup of sugar, not sure that's the best way moisten it!

YUMMY!! Added 3 tbsp oil and 1 tsp vanilla  to egg mixture, Brushed with eggnog  glaze {2 times}.  Once after coming out of oven then once about ten minutes into  it cooling. Using  brush much easier and looks better than with knife, also slit small holes{unnoticeable} in top of loaves so it could seep throough. Glaze:  2c. powder sugar,1 tsp vanilla,and 2 1/2 tbsp melted   butter. Mix together by hand then  add in 4 tbsp eggnog and continue adding eggnog until desired consistency. I ,think oil helped to prevent dryness other reviews  complained of, did not need pudding mix.  This recipe made 6 mini loaves baked for 45 minutes. Loved it!! Forgot to mention, cream the butter with the sugar.

The only change I made was to omit the rum extract (I didn't have any) and added cinnamon (which I add to almost every baked good). ;) But, it is very good. It tastes a little like a pound cake; but, it is good.

These are great to make into little loaves or muffins as gifts, as well as a big loaf.  I read all the reviews and made the following changes.  This is the second time I've made this, so I adjusted things a bit from the first time out.  To make the bread more moist, I used 1 1/2 cups of egg nog, and added 2 TBSP of oil.  I also added an instant vanilla pudding packet.  Instead of rum extract, I used spiced rum (3 TBSP), and I also doubled the nutmeg and also added 2 Teaspn of pumpkin pie spice.  Those were my ingredient changes, otherwise I followed the recipe. (I creamed the sugar and butter together first), and then followed the rest of the recipe.  The suggestion of a glaze sounded wonderful, so I tried one glaze recipe the first time, but I like the one I used the second time better, so here it is.   2 cups powdered sugar, 1 teaspn vanilla, 3 TBLSP of egg nog, 2 TBLSP softened butter, and then I kept adding spiced rum until I got the consistency I wanted (about 3 TBLSP).   What can I say...I love the flavor the rum adds to the bread.  Anyways, I know I strayed from the recipe a bit, but I did follow it very closely.  When you are going to put all the work into baking something, I like to read a lot of reviews so I'm not disappointed with the final product.  But I never would have tried this recipe, had I not discovered it on here, so I give the recipe 4 stars, because I'm sure the recipe on its own is great with the exception of the dryness and low spice flavors that folk

I love this bread.  I think the flavor is great.  Even my dad raved about it.  He can be a hard sell, so if he liked it, it must be good.  I've made with rum extract and just rum when I was out of extract.  I also add about two more ounces of eggnog because so many people complained about dryness.

This was dry and rather bland even after adding extra liquid, oil, extract and spice. Would be greatly improved with a flavored simple syrup poured over baked cake or with an eggnog cream cheese orange zest frosting on top.

This is not so much a review as to tell you how I modified this so that it WORKS. It just didn't read right to me and the reviews confirmed this for me. Instead: Use 1/2 cup sugar not 1 cup. Use melted butter not softened butter. Use 2 cups flour not 2 1/4 cups. Resulted in light and moist and perfectly sweet loaf. Try it!

This bread was awesome! Easy enough for anyone to make and tasted delicious. I did add a packet of instant vanilla pudding mix and about a half cup of extra eggnog. It's a lot like a pound cake/loaf. I did add a frosting on top after it was completely cool: 1 C powdered sugar, 3 Tb eggnog, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 rum extract and 1/8 nutmeg. Definitely keep wrapped up in tin foil so it doesn't dry out!

This was a good little bread.  But, I couldn't taste the eggnog or
the rum flavoring.   Next time maybe more on both.

This is excellent!  I first creamed the butter and sugar, then added the wet ingredients, including real rum, followed by adding the dry, sifted ingredients, doubling the nutmeg as others suggested.  The cake was very moist without adding the instant pudding.  My only change for next time is to increase the real rum to 2 Tbsp.

We really like this eggnog quick bread.  I did not make any adjustments to the ingredients; but based on some of the comments about being too dry, I did take the suggestion to cream the butter and sugar together before adding the rest of the wet ingredients.  I also used an electric mixer to combine the wet ingredients in order to infuse a bit of air into the mixture.  After baking and cooling, I made a powdered sugar/eggnog glaze for it.  I poked holes in the bread and let the glaze soak in and then frosted the top of the loaf.  The texture of the bread was moist and just as we like it.  The eggnog flavor was nice and mild, and the glaze gave the bread a perfect sweetness.  I will definitely make it again!

Good flavor but dry!  Will try  to make again with a few changes from the original recipe.  Maybe more eggnog and 1/4 less flour.

I found it to be a bit dry but it still tasted good and I'm going to give it another try.  It would be good in a trifle.

I added 1/3 cup more eggnog as suggested and a package of instant vanilla pudding.  I cooked it 40 minutes and though it was good, the pudding was...well pudding like!.  In fact I turned it over on a wire rack for a minute and the pudding leaked out.  What did I do wrong?

Saw this recipe today and decided to make it. After reading some of the reviews about it being a bit dry I added a few tablespoons of oil and a  1/2 cup more eggnog.  It turned out great!   It's so easy to make. Thank you for the recipe!

I tried this for with half the recipe, but after I put it in the oven and licked the bowl I realized I need to make another one in just a few days. It was good, and it smelled so nice in the kitchen.

Made as written minus rum extract. Added 1 1/2 t vanilla and 1/2 t cinnamon and a splash more eggnog. I used Shamrock Farm's low fat eggnog. Was delicious. Husband said to add it to the list of holiday baking favorites! I made it the next holiday season with Southern Comfort Vanilla Spice eggnog. This brand gave little flavor to the bread and it was very dry. Maybe the brand of eggnog effects the outcome of flavor and moisture of the bread.

I made several changes to recipe by another  reviewer. 
I added 5 tablespoons of vegetable oil to make it more more moist and doubled the imitation rum extract for flavour.
Used a electric mixer for the moist ingredient, but then combined in the dry ingredients by hand. It took about 1 hour for the bread to bake and cake trestle to come out clean. 
It sure smells wonderful. A. Very good eggnog make a big difference.

I only made this to use up eggnog that I didn't care to drink. I followed the advice to add vanilla pudding and use more eggnog etc.  Overall, the taste was nothing special to make again.  And now I know to not buy eggnog since I didn't care to drink it either!

EASY FLAVOURLESS.  I was a little disappointed in this.
Yes it's fast to get together, but you still want something at the end even if time was short. Just to plain, and no real spice or eggnog flavor.

This is really delicious. I used 3 tbsp of spiced rum instead of the extract. It is on the sweeter side so most definitely a dessert. I baked mine in a 9x5 loaf pan and it baked up in 55 minutes. If I make it again I would reduce sugar to 3/4 cup and double the nutmeg. This would be beautiful as a gift with a spiced rum glaze. 
I love how this loaf baked up fluffy, and high.

I made this with some of the suggested changes--1 1/3 c. eggnog, small instant vanilla pudding added with dry ingredients, left out the rum extract and used 2 t. vanilla.  In step 2, cream the butter and sugar first.  I made the three small loaves.  This was very moist and tasted great.  I made the glaze: 2 c. powdered sugar, 2 T. softened butter, 1 t. vanilla.  Mix, then add about 3 T. eggnog, mix.  However, the bread was so good it was not really needed.

I had leftover eggnog from Christmas, and needed an idea  what to do with it. I found this recipe and decided to use it...seemed simple and quick. It was! And it turned out wonderful. I doubled the recipe, for a total yield of two 9x5 loaf pans, and two mini loaf pans. I increased the eggnog (per suggestions) to 3 cups for the double recipe, and I increased my eggs to a total a five in the double recipe. Also, for fun, I sprinkled a light layer of brown sugar over the top of each loaf, which gave the bread a crusty outside, but a soft inside. All in all, a delicious recipe----it will go in my recipe book and be used again. Thank you!!

This is a great way to use up all of that eggnog! I served this with cinnamon honey butter (also from this site). Without the butter, the bread was pretty good (the butter definitely kicked it up a notch). After reading so many reviews of how the recipe, as written, produced a dry bread, I doubled the amount of eggnog. I think if I had not done that, the bread would have been dry. Otherwise, this is a really good recipe that can be made better based on your taste and some small modifications.

I made the same changes the first reviewer made-added an extra half cup eggnog and a pkg of instant vanilla pudding. I creamed the butter and sugar very well first, then proceeded with the recipe. It is great- almost pound cake like- served with freshly whipped cream and berries. The eggnog whipped cream on this site could be something to try too. Perhaps I will try cupcakes also. The glaze sounds interesting for those.

Delicious bread.  I added the vanilla pudding as suggested by other reviewers, but still thought it was a tad dry.  It really does taste like eggnog, though.  I will increase the nutmeg next time, and I like the idea of poking holes in the bread so rum glaze can soak in.

I followed  others suggestions and added the vanilla pudding and extra eggnog (total 1 1/2 cups). It came out more like a pound cake than a bread.  It was delicious , dense , and moist! I will definitely be pinning this to make next year!

I made this recipe in mini loaves; I have made numerous recipes in mini loaves, and always cook them 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes. This recipe took 40 minutes, and the bottoms were almost burnt in order to get the middle to cook through.  Plus, the loaves rose unnaturally in the center, rather than a nicely rounded top.

Tasted pretty good! I made 2 batches:  one plain, the other with pecans & white chocolate chip.  Both were topped with powdered sugar! I did add 1tsp of cinnamon & 1 teaspoon of nutmeg.

Really good. Would be good with cinnamon on top. I used 3/4 of the amount of sugar and it was sweet enough! I plan to make this again!

This was delicious.  I didn't have any rum extract so I used spiced rum.  Wonderful.  That was the only difference and I'm making it again and bringing it to work.  The first one I had to eat myself just to make sure everyone would like it.  ^-^

Very easy recipe. Followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the egg nog to 1 1/2 cups and added a packet of instant vanilla pudding. I also used real rum as well. Very tasty especially the next day. Made great gifts, and people commented how much they liked it.

I added an extra half cup of eggnog and 2 tsps. of bourbon instead of rum.  It has great flavor, but still seems a bit dry - which is crazy because the batter seemed too wet.  I am wrapping it in wax paper for a day or two and see if that helps with the moisture thing.  It is delicious though!

I didn't have vanilla pudding mix, so I used chocolate! It's moist and delicious!! Took other reviewer's suggestions and did 2 C eggnog, 1/2 butter 1/2 veg oil. I made the glaze suggested by another reviewer and honestly, the bread would be great alone but now that I've put this glaze together it's going on!!! YUMMO!

So yummy, and I even used light egg nog and egg beaters! I would just go a little light on the rum flavor unless you REALLY like it.

This bread would probably earn itself a full 5 stars next time, but for now it just doesn't quite cut it. I followed the recipe exactly, and the imitation rum ruins it. I'm not sure how real rum would change baking consistencies and such, but I think it's worth figuring it out. The imitation stuff leaves such an awful taste in your mouth that you no longer want to eat anymore!! It's truly horrible! If not for that, I think I would love this. The consistency is nice, and it was moist. Just one bump in the road to figure out.

I had a carton of eggnog to use before going bad.  I set out to find 3 recipes to use it up.  I started with this quick bread and moved on to pancakes.  This bread is ok made as written.  Everyone who made this had a different variation as their way to make it.  I made as written and baked it in 3 mini loaves for 35 minutes.  The taste was good…….a little dry as far as quick breads go.  My family actually liked it toasted best with a little butter.  I would try this recipe again, but I would tweak it using some of the suggestions from other reviewers.

I made this recipe a couple of weeks before Christmas 2012. Froze it and took it out just before Christmas. It was good but we had so much good food that we couldn't enjoy and eat everything. Try to make it another time when not over whelmed with other food.

This was really delicious and everyone LOVED it!!  I don't feel like the egg nog flavor would've been as obvious had I not used 2 cups like suggested in other comments. I also used the oil (5 tbsp butter & 3 tbsp oil) and the vanilla pudding (big box) and did not use the rum extract (I just didn't have any - I think it would've been yummy).  One thing - I think with all of the extras I had to bake it longer than the recipe called for which I don't think anyone mentioned. I believe I ended up cooking it for 80 minutes.  I can hardly wait to make this for Christmas next year!!

Made it first using real rum instead of extract otherwise as written and found it to be too dry.  Second time I tried using vanilla pudding mix added as well as extra eggnog, it was more dense but still kind of dry.

As others suggested, I added the pudding mix, increased eggnog, and added 2 T. oil.   I also add a cinnamon and sugar sprinkle to the top before putting it in the oven which I love -the top is crunchy and sweet.

I had bought a brand of eggnog I didn't like, but I didn't want to waste it!  So glad I found this recipe!  I used about 3/4 cup extra eggnog since the other reviews said it could be dry, just enough so the consistency of the batter looked like what I'm used to seeing and I made muffins and mini loaves.  They came out perfect!  I am going to make another batch for my christmas party and mix a little eggnog and powdered sugar for frosting and make glazed cupcakes with some festive sprinkles.

Did some ppl use yellow food coloring in theirs?  B/c mine did not turn out looking like the picture.  I did alter my recipe, but I rated based on taste alone, which should not change.  What did was my cooking time.  I did muffins, and they took a lot longer than normal.  In total, it took me close to half an hour to finish baking.  It's partly due to the fact that I doubled the liquid (2c of eggnog) and used half oil for the butter...and also, how I kept on taking them out to check.  I think the alteration also made the product a little spongier.  The taste was fine, but nothing that bowled me over.  If I were to make it again, I would add only half a cup more of eggnog at most.  Other alterations were increasing the nutmeg to half a teaspoon, and using pudding mix.

Update:  The ppl at work gobbled them up.  So I added one more star.

I tried this recipe and reviews, but didnt have any pudding on hand but I did increase the eggnog and added the oil.  It took about 1hr 10 min to cook, leaving a real  thick crust (which we dont like) and it was dry and crumbly.  I am looking for a more dense creamy recipe for this.

Yummy way to use up leftover eggnog after Christmas!  I used about 1/4 c. real rum instead of extract.  I also threw in a bit of ground flax seed to add some nutrition.

Ended up having to cook for an hr and 20 min.  Checked it every 5 min after the first 50 min, just didn't seem to want to cook.  Edges  started to turn crispy.  Served it for a family dinner and everyone enjoyed it.

First of all, I'm not a fan of eggnog, but was intrigued by this bread. It's very good! Slightly sweet, nice & moist. I made mini loaves to put in Christmas gift baskets & everyone really liked it, including me! I'll definately make it again!

Not a very strong eggnog taste, but a good way to use of stuff that's on its way out.

This recipe is awesome if you like eggnog. The only alteration I would make is to bake it longer, depending on the pan size.

Recipe was a little dry but will a nice, subtle eggnog / nutmeg flavor. Will try again with more eggs or applesauce or something to see if that helps make the cake more moist.

This was pretty good.  Not my favorite of quick breads, but was definitely a good use for leftover eggnog.  I used applesauce in place of butter to cut down on the fat and left out the rum extract, since I didn't have any.

The taste is wonderful. Even the batter was delicious. I added 1/3 c chopped pecans & a little extra nutmeg. I would have given it 5 stars but I had trouble with the cooking time/temp. At the stated temp, 50 minutes wasn't enough. By the time my toothpick came out clean, the crust of my bread was almost burned. I used the 9.5" loaf pan. Can someone figure out what the correct temp and time are?

This is the exact same recipe as the other Eggnog Quick Bread listed on this site.
My mini-cakes tasted like snickerdoodles but that might be because I used 1/2 c. of pumpkin pie spice eggnog & 1/2 c. reg. eggnogg. They do seem a bit dry though & more cake-like texture than I was expecting from a quick bread. I think I'll add a little oil next time to try to moisten it up a bit.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I don't like eggnog but I gave it a try.  Not bad.  Everyone else stated it was good.  Did not come out dry as some people said.  I baked mine for about 50 mins.

I love this bread. I make it every Christmas. I always add a little extra nutmeg (at 1/4 t extra) and sometimes 1/2 t cinnamon as well. I think next time I will add pudding to increase the moistness as others have mentioned.

I made this bread for Xams gifts.
Turned out GREAT! As some others said it was dry, needed pudding, oil etc. Didn't find that the case, has 1/2 cup of butter already. Good just as is. If it's dry you probably baked it too long!!

I added pudding mix and a little more eggnog.  It was good after being refrigerated, but nothing I would crave.  It also took forever to bake.

I had high hopes for this one, but was a bit disappointed.  It was almost too rich to eat; more of it wasn't eaten than was.  I would recommend planning to eat the entire loaf the day you make it, as leftovers don't age well.

Just "OK" for our family - husband liked it well enough but I found that I pitched the last third of the loaf.  Maybe we're not big eggnog fans?  Won't make it again - too many other better quick bread recipes out there.

Wonderful bread.  Did add a couple of tablespoons of oil as others suggested and it was moist, but on the dryer side of quick breads.  Tasty!

I tripled this recipe & baked in seasonal miniloaf pans for my husband's coworkers.  It was a big hit.  I added the suggested cooking oil & vanilla pudding, increased the nutmeg & rum, glazed it with an eggnog, confectionary sugar mixture.  The result was a perfectly moist & yummy Christmas gift that didn't break our budget.

Ok, after reading some other reviews I came up with this amazing recipe:  add an extra 1/3 cup eggnog, use 1T rum, 5 and 1/2 T butter, only 2 cups flour (i used 1/2 whole wheat), and then add two very ripe bananas.  Makes a deliciously moist banana eggnog bread-lots of flavor!!  Will be making this regularily!

This is a delicious "pound cake" not a bread.  Wonderful with coffee.  I baked mine longer than what was indicated though and it still wasn't quite done in the middle.  Can't figure out why.  I definitely will make this again.  Next time I'll try a glaze on it and add some rum soaked cranberries as others mentioned.

I liked this, especially toasted and buttered but my fiance didn't care for it too much.  I think it would make awesome french toast but haven't tried it yet.

Tasty but nothing spectacular.  Based on prior reviews, I used real rum, 1/2 c sugar + 1/4 c splenda, and 1 1/4 cups eggnog.  It was still a tad on the dry side.  But it definitely tasted like eggnog.

The first time I made this bread I forgot the 1/2 cup of butter which made the bread very dense and not that good.  When I realized my mistake and made it again it came out wonderfully with a very nice eggnog flavor.  My husband said he would prefer a glaze over it instead of the powdered sugar.  This recipe is a keeper!

Very tasty and festive. I added some decorations to the top and the kids loved it. (Even my 5 yr old who doesn't care for egg nog). I baked it a bit longer than recipe called for since it wasn't completely done in the middle. If you are looking for cake, you won't find it with this recipe. This is a good bread that holds together well and is quite filling. I had it for breakfast a couple of times. Very satisfying!

I had tried an eggnog bread some time ago, and was wanting to make some myself when I saw this recipe. Good, but not spectacular. Nice w/a cup of coffee, but a bit dry -- perhaps I over-baked it. Was out of rum extract, so used a slug of real rum. Gave it a good hint of rum flavor. Not sure I'll make this recipe again, but loved the concept -- eggnog is so tasty!

This was a terrific recipe.  I used spiced rum because I didn't have rum extract in the house.  You can definitely smell the eggnog, but it tastes like a really rich pound cake.  Fantastic!

I used Custard Nog instead of Eggnog. It has a wonderful pound cake texture, and great taste. 
Served to other family members. Great reviews from them also.
