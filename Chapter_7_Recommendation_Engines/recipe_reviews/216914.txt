I noticed after putting the chimichangas in the oven that I was supposed to use corn tortillas. Woops, I used flour. I Cooked the recipe the exact same way, but I did have to take them out around 8 or 9 minutes because of the flour tortillas. Turned out fabulous. I also had no green chilis so I used part of a can of Rotel. Love the ground beef mixture. Tastes great!

Yummy! Instead of taco seasoning mix I just used some ancho chile powder, cumin, garlic & onion powders, and black pepper. I was kinda hesistant about the vinegar, but it added a nice tang! I didn't do the whole dipping in margarine thing - just heated the tortillas in the microwave to make them pliable, wrapped them up, then sprayed with cooking spray before popping them in the oven. They bake up crispy but without the added calories. Thanks! :)

this was a really yummy meal (we had it with salad). It works a lot better with 1tbsp taco seasoning and a few whole chopped tomatoes in the beef mixture to give it some freshness! very quick and easy too

This was a nice change up from our regular taco night.  Prepared as directed with the exception of omitting the chilies for my children and cutting the vinegar in half.  Also, since I doubled the recipe, I made half of the chimichangas with flour tortillas and half with corn tortillas.  I really preferred the corn tortillas.  On a side note, if you do make both flour and corn chimis, you will have to cook them separately because the flour chimis do tend to crisp up faster by about five minutes.  Great recipe that will be worked into the weekly rotation.  Thank you for sharing!

Just a tip ... I always pre fry my corn tortillas for a few seconds (don't over cook them!)and then place them on a paper towel to drain.  This makes them pliable and easy to work with without them falling apart.  Hope this helps :)

These were FANTASTIC! The absolute ONLY thing I changed was I used flour tortillas since that was all I had so I had to bake for about 8-9 mins instead of the whole 15. DO NOT change anything about this recipe. It is perfect.

I have been making these for the last several months!!! Very delcious and so simple!!! My only variation has been omitting the vinegar and I definitely use flour tortillas over the corn, as traditionally, flour tortillas are used for chimichangas. Thank you for this tasty recipe!! ;))Much healthier and easier than frying! I will say I have also used this recipe with chicken instead of beef, great results, as well!

The ingredients go well together. However, the tortillas need to be either hard-fried and soaked to soft or soft and soaked well. It took two packages of corn tortillas to figure this out! Otherwise, the torts end up broken and in pieces.
Because I goofed up the torts the first time, my kids made super nachos with the meat mixture...not all bad!

I made this for my family tonight, and everyone loved it. I also make my own taco seasoning mix. I added some sliced black olives, and instead of soaking corn tortillas in butter, I used large flour tortillas, brushed on a little e.v.o.o. added a thin layer of spicy refried beans, then the meat mixture and baked them for about 10 min to brown and crisp up the tortillas. I topped them with a little shredded cheese, sour cream, and my own made guacamole. Absolutely delicious.

These tasted great! However, as another reviewer said, getting those corn tortillas soft was MUCH harder than the recipe led on. After ruining several when they tore apart, I finally added more butter and turned the heat up more. They finally got soft. I also couldn't fit a whole 1/3 cup in each one and still close it all the way. I ended up using less in each. But, once I got it figured out, my husband & I loved eating them!

Loved this recipe! It was very easy and delicious. I keep a book of recipes that are my daughters favorite. She said "Mom, add this to my recipe book!" I did use flour tortillas instead of corn. Doesn't take as long to cook and we don't like corn tortillas. Added a bit more taco seasoning. Thanks!

I was skeptical at first, but I can see how these would easily become a family favorite.  They are wonderful with a flavor that leans more on the authentic side.  I couldn’t get enough!  Unfortunately, all I could find were small tortillas and all they wanted to do was fall apart.  I ended up microwaving them for a few seconds to help soften them and then I dipped in margarine.  It helped a little, but I guess I should just learn how to make my own.

Man o' man these were so yummy! I made adjustments based on what I had on hand: used ground turkey, 1T homemade taco seasoning (chili pwdr, dry mince onion, cumin, oregano, paprika, salt, pepper), couple ounces green chile enchilada sauce, 1 tsp vinegar, only bout 1/2C cheese, about 3T of butter. 

Served with salsa and sour cream over a bed of lettuce. So so so good!

I made this for my hubby. He liked it. I made everything the same except for I didn't use the green chilies because I forgot to get them when I went to the grocery store. So I used some salsa instead and it was good. I also added green peppers and took out the oregano because I didn't think that went with this mixture. This recipe is how I basically season my ground beef when I made tacos or nachos anyway. The only thing that was different was adding the sour cream. I use taco seasoning sometimes but this time I used cumin and chili powder to taste. I love to cook and every recipe I use it as a base and go off script and do my own thing but this one didn't need much tweaking.

Thought this was great! Used two lbs ground beef, flour tortillas, half a can of the peppers (we don't like heat) a full pack of seasoning mix and doubled the rest of the ingredients. I made them by pan frying the bundles after I brushed them with melted margarine, then put them in the oven for 10 minutes. I did some as the recipe stated and others with refried beans and cheese along with the meat mixture. Really good recipe!

We tried both corn tortillas and flour. My husband liked the corn and I like the flour. I'll add more cheese next time and add some corn and black beans. We just wanna see if it'll make it better. But we did like this recipe.

We liked this one a lot :) Definitely use FLOUR tortillas, as chimis are not made with corn tortillas. Anyway, this was very easy and I appreciated the baking over frying because, well, I was lazy today and didn't want to stand over the stove in 90 deg weather! We need 1-1/2 lbs of ground beef to feed us, so I just ended up using the whole pkg of taco seasoning and I only had fresh jalapenos which we like better than canned. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so good! I would have awarded five stars had I not had to tweak it. I do believe the prep time, 15 minutes, is off, as well. Using only 1/3 cup of filling per tortilla was not enough. After I wrapped a few, I reopened and added almost twice as much filling. 

To prep all the ingredients, cook the beef, and stuff the tortillas took at least 25 minutes and I am not a slow cook. 

I did leave out the vinegar as other reviews reported it gave an odd taste to the dish, substituted 2 jalapenos for the green chilies and used flour, not corn, tortillas as that was all I had. 

I love the fact that this dish is baked, not fried. The chimis baked up nice and crisp within 10 minutes. Not one opened up while baking. 

I will definitely make this dish again. Thanks for sharing it!

These were very good.  Made them for dinner tonight and the family gobbled them up.  I did use flour tortillas rather than corn (just my preference).  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you.

Perfect. I took the advice of others and added one tablespoon of seasoning (although I made my own) and added just a couple tablespoons of salsa in with the beef. 

I made the tortillas as described below as well as just using the meat with chips and all the normal mexican toppings (guac, sour cream, salsa, etc). Both are wonderful.

This was a GREAT recipe.  We made a few changes to it, but nothing too significant. 
The only issue I had was with the tortillas...after putting them in the butter, they seemed to fall apart a bit.  Just be careful with that, otherwise it was a hit!

These were really good.  I love oregano, but my husband, not so much, so next time I will have to use much less.  I substituted butter for the margarine because that was all I had.  Hubby also thought the filling was dry, so I might add some of his favorite "jar salsa" next time also.  But personally, I liked them just the way they are.  Mine were browned/done in considerably less time than is written.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used shredded meat leftover from a pot roast. Cooked them in my AIR FRYER for 8 minutes at 400F and they were golden, crispy, puffed up and perfect. You could flip them and cook 1 minute more to crisp up the bottoms if desired, but they're so good who wants to wait an extra minute ;)  These are a new family favorite, hubby is already requesting I make them again!

Yuck!  The outside was not crisp and it made the inside mushy.  Would be better as a taco filling. The meat mixture was good.

I used 6.5" soft corn tortillas. Tried to soften more in margarine. Put 1/3 cup of meat in the center but even though I softened the tortilla it broke and I could not create the enclosed envelope. So I must have not softened them enough.  On the second one because of the problem I had with the first one I softened a 6.5" tortilla in margarine, laid it flat, put the meat in the center, flattened the meat so it was about 1" thick,  and kept the meat about 1" from the edge, soaked a 2nd tortilla and put it on top. 450 Degrees is to hot as they smoke. So I lowered the temp to 400 and let them cook for 15 to 20 min. I did not put the chilis in because my wife is allergic to them so I put some pickled sliced jalapenos  on top the meat before I put the top tortilla on They were excellent and super tasty. I am gong to make them again but not going to try to fold them into a envelope unless for some reason I have the large tortillas and want to use them up.

Liked by the whole family.  Top with cheese, sour cream, and salsa.  Perhaps add more tex-mex cheese inside.  Don't over-cook.

Excellent! I followed this recipe as written with the only addition of adding a red pepper and I did use flour tortillas instead of the corn. I fried the tortillas in real butter. Filled up with delicious meat and baked about 20 minutes. They turned out nice and crispy! Served with a delicious Spanish rice recipe from this site! Having leftovers tonite!!

Great recipe, but I tweaked it. Sauteed onions in small pan prior to adding meat. Meat I bought was packaged shredded beef from the store. Also added chili powder, salt, and pepper to the mixture, but I left out the vinegar. Cooked in over until very light gold before then frying them. Added cheese to the top to finish. My family absolutely loved it and if you double the recipe, then you have leftovers!

My kids loved this, even the kids who absolutely hates flour tortillas. I did use flour tortillas and they crisped up perfectly without over cooking. I added taco sauce to the top after cooking and a big spoonful of salsa and served it with Southwestern Rice (I'll be honest, it was a Steamfresh bag of premade rice) Everyone asked me to make it again!

This was great! I didn't have sour cream, so I used cream cheese for the filling. It was a great, quick, easy meal and so much healthier baked. Next time I'll probably use chicken or steak inside and make sure to have alllll the fixins for it. Also, I will add the cheese to top it off and pop it back in the oven for a few minutes to let it melt on top. I think with a little work it could be one of the best recipes yet. My family loved it! PS We topped them with green enchilada sauce, cilantro, cheese, green onions, & tomatoes. Yummmm

Modified for LACTOSE INTOLERANT peeps. (not yelling, sorry). Turned out great btw. Used yogurt instead of sour cream, fake cheese, and butter instead of plastic. The butter is really only used to coat the tortilla (flour is what works) and man was that stuff was crispy melt-in-your-mouth. Lime juice instead of vinegar, Chili powder and Cumin instead of taco seasoning, crushed red pepper instead of green chillies. baked for like 10min.  (OK so if you are REALLY sensitive to Lactose you might want to use margarine and idk if yogurt works for you. does for me)

SO yeah, I guess I changed it up a bit. But the essence is still there. Think I would have added more onion (only used about 1/2 onion), beans and some other veggie to it because it was a whole lot of beef baby! I rolled mine up nice and fat like one of Chipotle's fat child-sized burritos. 
So good. My boyfriend snagged some and was SUPER jealous.

Have a pic but it's on my dead phone. message me if you want to see.

This was really good!  I followed the recipe down to the letter except I used ground elk instead of beef, so I'm sure it was a bit healthier.  Ended up cooking it more like 20+ minutes because I like things crispy. Served it on top of a bed of homemade Spanish rice with sour cream and avocado chunks, delicious!

Not bad--given I subbed taco seasoning with a can of Hormel Hot flavored chili (no beans) and used mild Rotel tomatoes/chilis. Also, add oregano, garlic and any other spices you choose AFTER you drain browned beef, so you don't lose them. I also took the tip on using PAM on the baking sheet and made the chimis there, spraying the tops after I folded them all. Cut baking time in half for Flour tortillas. I need more practice folding burrito size tortillas. I personally liked my first time with this dish ( 3-stars). No complaints from my picky family earns the 4th star.

We loved this recipe.  I did not add the vinegar because it felt weird to do so.  I did add a little salsa as when I tasted it I felt it needed some tomato (as some other reviewers did as well).  I also used flour tortillas.  Shoot, maybe I shouldn't have reviewed this, seeing as I now realize I made a few changes.  Oh well, anyway this was so good!  My bundles turned out crispy.  I dipped mine in sour cream and salsa.  Oh my!  Both my husband and I felt these tasted even better the next day.  (but were not as crispy- but it didn't matter).  I plan on making over and over.  Oh, and I decided I like the filling as a dip for tortilla chips or as nachos.

Really really great!! I used Mission Soft Taco flour tortillas, (they come in a bag with purple trim), cause they're my favorite cause they are really thin and soft and taste great. The Chimichangas turned out great, though I left the chilis out, used less Oregano,  and added taco sauce, and Cilantro. Everyone loved them!

These were delicious and crispy! Used 10 inch flour tortillas and baked about 9 minutes. The vinegar was strong so next time we will use less but they were definitely a keeper!! Top with sour cream and salsa and enjoy!

I used flour tortillas and added just a little jalapeño juice for flavor. My picky eaters ate them up! I’m a happy mom.

Excellent, quick and easy recipe.  I also used flour tortillas and citrus instead of vinegar. They were amazing! Everyone loved them and want to know when I will be making them again.  Next time I think I will substitute shredded chicken for the beef.  Thank you again for a great recipe!

These were a HUGE hit with my family of 6 and  my parents. I did use 1 Tablespoon taco seasoning.  Will likely add more next time. Didn't have the chiles on hand but half my family doesn't like spicy food. I made a double batch of ground beef and used the same recipe to make chicken chimis since I prefer those.   They were also very tasty! I used rotisserie chicken. The chimis were almost better the next day since they crisped up even more when reheated in the oven. I used La Banderita brand low carb whole wheat flour tortillas.  I was told to make these again soon. I might try freezing one to see how they hold up. This would be a great item to have in my freezer for our busy schedules. 
Thanks for a great recipe!

I used ground turkey and pretty much a whole packet of taco seasoning in addition to the original recipe.  After they are done add salsa, cheese, cilantro sour cream, and scallions! Amazing dish.

The only thing I did different was added jalapeños and black olives to the meat mixture. Also, when almost done, removed from the oven and deep fried for a few minutes!

I like making these they're easy and you can use what you have on hand. Chicken, pork, hamburger, and even left over pot roast, this last go around l used over size tortillas and added refried beans along with pulled pork.

Loved this recipe but made two changes. My wife likes flour tortillas so I used those and instead of margarine I used Olive Oil for a little healthier dish.  Can out surprisingly great!

This recipe is good. I didn't have green chillies and corn tortillas so I used flour tortillas and omitted the green chillies. Tasted nice but I think I did not add enough salt to mine. I used the remnant tortillas to make chips with the Corn Tortilla Chips recipe of this site since I had remnant butter. I also had some Traditional Mexican Guacamole also from a recipe of this site. Needless to say it was DELICIOUS!

This was good.  My corn tortillas fell apart; they were not pliable.  I didn't realize I needed to fry them briefly to make them pliable.  Dipping them in the butter for a few seconds did not work.  Would probably be easier to use flour tortillas, but maybe not as tasty.

This has now become a favorite! We did both flour and corn tortillas - both very good but cooking times are slightly different (~5min), and will depend on your oven. 
We eat a lot of wild game and I made these with ground elk (much leaner than beef), but I am looking forward to trying this with chicken as well.  I used a chopped, fresh jalapeño pepper rather than canned green chilies and it was great. I served them with topping options of fresh chopped pico de gallo, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.
It’s just my husband and I at home now, and we ended up with two trays (doubled recipe) and realized these make great leftovers and a very nice quick dinner option for nights we work late! We’ll definitely be making these again!!

These were surprisingly good! Definitely not too spicy, even for the kids. I just sprayed the (flour) tortillas with cooking oil before baking, rather than dealing with the melted margarine. Not as good as deep-fried, but a nice option for a weeknight. Fast, too.

Doubled the recipe and used blended corn/flour  tortillas- these tasted like they were deep fried.  Very yummy!

I agree that the recipe as written needs a little more spice. I served my first try with salsa at the table and will try to bake them the next time with salsa on top or spiced tomatoes in the filling.

As written I think this recipe is only a 2 or a 3. I thought it was very bland, and I even used a little
more taco seasoning than the recipe called for. I think this recipe would be great doctored up with some more seasoning and spice though!

Had to learn how to properly soften the corn tortillas to roll them without breaking, but got the hang of it.  Since I can't eat much deep fried food, baked chimichangas was a great option.  My husband and I both loved them!

Very good. Will definitely make this again. The only substitution I made was flour tortillas instead of corn. Served them with sour cream, diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, and salsa. Yum!

It was a little dry. I will try it again with a litle less time in the oven. I used flour tortillas instead of corn so I'll try with corn next time. It was very easy and quick so I think it will be fine with some modifications.

Excellent turnout meal!  Used heated in microwave flour tortillas for a easy rolling .Used cooking spray and baked 9min until crispiness as other reviewers recommended. Served with salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese and salad on the side for individual choice.

So I thought I had had corn tortillas but I ended up using some flour ones in an old El Paso enchiladas kit I had on hand. Yes I had to cut short the cooking time and they weren’t bid enough for the recipe .But still delish. Will make agin with corn tortillas.

I always manage to mess up lol! The meat came out PERFECT, love the flavor and will use this recipe even for regular crunchy tacos. However, I realized about half way through that the tortillas I bought were going to be much too tiny. I think mine were 4 inch size (street taco size). I ended up toasting the tortillas and making chalupas. Still great!

These were good. I had both white corn and yellow corn tortillas, and had the problem with the yellow corn tortillas falling apart, as others did. Mine were also too small to make envelopes, so instead I tucked the torn pieces of yellow corn tortillas into the ends to hold the filling in, and that worked. My oven tends to run a little low, so they didn't crisp up as much as I would like. Next time I will turn up the heat a bit more and leave them in longer. I would definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful recipe! That being said, I replaced the hamburger with fresh shredded chicken breast. I also made my own low sodium taco seasoning mix (from my DASH cookbook). This will be a regular meal in our home!

We liked them. But toppings of chopped green onions, chopped tomatoes, taco sauce and lots of sour cream made them very good. Could use salsa, but fresh chopped tomato is good to add freshness.

Very good! I thought it needed a little something more, but I can't quite pinpoint what...I ran out of shells so I took a croissant roll package and wrapped the remaining meat in in two triangles put together to form a rectangle! It was delicious!

I took suggestions from modified recipes... Used flour tortillas, added chili, garlic, and onion powders ( just a little sprinkle), and used jalapeños rather than chilies. I also added some sirracha  to the meat mixture. It was excellent! Restaurant style excellent! Will definitely add this one to supplement taco night sometimes. Thank you for the recipe! Would have given it 5 stars if I didn't make so many changes.

I followed the recipe to a T and it was very bland. After all the ingredients, I thought it still tastes like plain ground beef. The corn tortillas didn't work out very well for me either, coming out overly crispy. I would recommend adding a lot more Taco seasoning as well as salt and pepper to the beef and bake for a shorter time.

My family loved this. My husband said it was the best he has ever had and he eats chimighangas whenever we go to a Mexican restaurant.  A few changes, I did not use vinegar or chiles. Used flour tortillas and put cheese on top instead of mixing into meat mixture. I also finely cut up a jalapeño with
 seeds removed and put those in meat mixture before putting in tortilla.  Will DEFINATELY cook again and I will not be experimenting with any other chimichanga recipes.

I accidentally used a whole package if taco seasoning and didn't even notice until I went to make it the next time. I also used flour tortillas. Everything else I left the same. Whole family raved about it and asked when I was making it again! Thank you for sharing.

My chimichangas turned out delicious but the one thing I didn't like was using corn tortillas. They kept breaking when I was folding them. Next time I will use flour tortillas. Other than that, they turned out very good.

The meat for this was outstanding, I thought.  Had never heard of adding vinegar to cooked ground beef before!  I used large flour tortillas instead of corn since I've always known chimichangas to be made with flour.  Was able to make 7 good-sized chimis with flour tortillas.  They worked out perfectly, no falling apart.  However, I've made similar recipes using corn tortillas and the trick to sturdy corn tortillas is to fry each one for about 30 seconds, as stated in this recipe also, so they are pliable but not wimpy-soft.  I also had to use plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream - worked like a charm.  When reheating, use toaster oven or pan-fry on low heat to recapture outside crisp.

The meat mixture is phenomenal. The corn tortillas take FOREVER!! And fall apart a lot. I'll try this again using flour.

I made this last night, it was excellent. I thought it would not be crispy, but, it was. My family loved it. I will be making this again. One note to add on here, instead of cooking it in the oven for 15 minutes, I would cut the baking time down to 8-10. The bottom of the Chimi was a little too dark.

So so meal.  The meat was not at all flavorful and I had to switch to flour tortillas after the corn kept falling apart.  Unfortunately my family did not like it so I will not be making it again

I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't do much for me.  I didn't think it was worth the effort - in the end it just tasted like a really plain taco to me and took twice as long as a typical taco dinner.  Next time I will stick with the ground beef enchilada recipe on here.

I thought this was delicious!  I added black olives to the hambuerger mixture also.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn.  They worked out fine.  I also just used butter spray on both sides of the tortilla before filling and baking, instead of warming in margarine in pan.  Turned out excellent.

The recipe is very tasty. For those who think it comes out "super hard", this is probably because you were not checking your food as it was baking. Do not blame this recipe!

Amazing dish---I used flour tortillas instead of corn and only baked it for half the time they were crispy and lightly browned by the time they were done. Also substituted green peppers instead of the green chiles to make it a milder taste. And left out the vinegar because I didn't have any. Some of your might think it is too bland this way but we loved it.

My family loves this meal!  I would have given 5 stars, but the amount of spice isn't even close to how much you need.  For a pound of meat, use at least 3 or 4 tablespoons!  Or, better yet, create your own spice blend.

Once I opened the package of taco seasoning, I decided to use the whole thing. I also used flour tortillas as our family doesn't like the corn. Just a swipe of olive oil on the outer side of the tortilla makes it nice and crispy. HUGE hit! Nice and spicy with a little 'after burn'.

These came out very good, I used flour tortillas so seven minutes in the oven was plenty. The meat was flavorful but I expected more of a kick, it's good that it isn't spicy as my daughter could enjoy it and my boyfriend loved it with hot sauce. I kept expecting a bit more of a taste, but I didn't have sour cream on hand while cooking and used a different cheese so I'm not going to gauge the taste on the actual recipe. I also didn't have a clove of garlic so I added minced, wasn't entirely sure on the amount, so I didn't include this in my rating. It still was good and my family loved it.

This turned into a sloppy mess.  The tortillas were supposed to crisp up in the oven but never did.  Luckily the ingredients tasted good anyway, but I won't make this again.

My family (husband and 4 young children) really liked these. I would say- good but not great.   I only had 5 1/2 inch corn tortillas, so they were hard to close up securely for the oven.  The filling is very tasty.  To improve them, I would certainly use the 7 inch corn tortillas- BUT with more than 1/4 cup filling to make these more hearty.

Very good, and VERY easy.  Did use 1 can Rotel in place of green chilies.  Used flour tortillas, and used canola oil in place of margarine.  Family loved this.  Will make again.  Thanks.

i found this recipe on allrecipes' new recipe spinner app for android.  it sounded very simple to make.  and it was!  we've never had chimichangas before so i didn't know what they were supposed to taste like. i'd give it 5 stars for the concept!!!  i used flour tortillas.  they baked up so beautifully, crunchy and yet fluffy.  i plan to use this method to make a variety of "hot pockets".  

unfortunately none of us cared for the filling at all, which is why i felt i had to reduce it to 3 stars. 

thanks for a great recipe base!

These were really good.  I followed the recipe as it was written except I used quite a bit more taco seasoning (like a 4TBS).  And I used reduced fat sour cream.  Super Yummy!!!!!!!

This recipe is awesome!! I used flour tortillas instead of corn and I only had to do a quick dip in the butter and rolled them - they came out sooo crispy! I didn't use any chillies but I used hot salsa instead. These were a big hit with my boyfriend! :)

The meat filling was delicious, but I had problems with the corn tortillas breaking apart.

i did flour tortillas.. and instead of puttiing in butter, I just put it over my gas stove, and heated them up like that.. Kind of dry.. but good.
