I've had a few Korean bulkoki recipes. This one is a keeper. Forgot the pears and still was excellent. Served with edamame and jasmine rice. Wow the sauce was delicious

This is NOT traditional Bulgogi and did not enjoy at all.  I will stick to another recipe on here.  Nothing about it did I like.  Followed recipe to a "T"

This turned out great. The only thing I would change next time is to double the sauce because we like it saucy. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!
