Excellent cookie!  It's a lot of trouble, but I developed a system that seemed to work for me.  I put the parcels of dough in the freezer for a while, then was able to better shape them into round rather than square logs.  I kept them in the freezer for a while longer and rolled them in the colored sugar.  That also helped to round them.  I returned them to the freezer for a while longer, then just brought out enough to cut for one cookie sheet.  They were easy to slice, pretty much retained their shape, and didn't stick to the knife blade.  While one sheet was in the oven I prepared the next one, and by the time it was ready to go into the oven, the dough was soft enough that I could easily tweak the shape if necessary.  
I used chopped pecans on top, and they added a wonderful toasted nut flavor.  I used purchased colored sugar because I wanted the large crystals.  One thing I noticed that no other reviewer seems to have mentioned is that the sugar caramelized a little and added an extra dimension of flavor and crunch.  Definitely a good addition to any Christmas cookie tray.

A costly cookie, but completely worth it! I have never made cream cheese cookies before, and I am so impressed by the moistness of this cookie. I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar, and rolled the cookies in a mixture of crushed pecans and white sugar before cutting, and skipped the extra pecan ontop. I used parchment paper instead of foil in the oven aswell.
I cut the cookies a bit wider, so I had a smaller yield, but these cookies were so moist and yummy, and cooked perfectly in 20 minutes! I will make these cookies again and again.

These cookies are my holiday favorites.  I have been baking them at Christmas every year for about ten years now.  They have a great flavor and look festive on the cookie tray. Be careful not to overbake them - - very lightly browned is perfect for a slightly chewy, cheesecake taste.

These were delicious and they kept their shape well.  Instead of circles, we shaped the logs into squares before we cut them.  We already have enough round cookies.  Also, they were much better when we are careful not to overbake them.  They stay soft and delicious when they're only very lightly browned.

Yummy!  Very delicate cheesecakey kind of taste.  

Just one note - my oven is a bit hotter than most, so the bottoms are a bit black.  Starting at 10 minutes, keep y our eye on them to make sure that the cookies don't burn!

These cookies are yummy! I didn't let them sit overnight or wrap them, I just dropped them onto a cookie sheet (after a few minutes in the freezer) and pushed the sprinkles down on the top of them.  I thought they were prettier this way, I didn't have to wait til the next day to finish them and they tasted just great!

I've been looking for a cream cheese based recipes since my sister lost hers.  I think this is as good if not better.  I loved it with the pecans but might add chopped red and green candied cherries next time for color.

These cookies were great!  Everyone loved them and they weren't difficult to make.  The only problem I had was that my pecans kept falling off.  I also made a batch with almonds instead of pecans and these were also wonderful.

I love this recipe.  These cookies are wonderful.  Last year was the first for making them and I am about to make more.  I put sprinkles on the outside and when I rolled dough flat and covered with sprinkles then rolled into rolls.  Made the pinwheel effect.  I also put m&m's in the center when they were cut!!

These cookies are not only yummy, but very pretty! I love that you don't have to scoop them to make cookies. For some reason cutting logs is easier for me. It also allows me to make the dough and then bake when I want or need to.  For putting the dough in the freezer - instead of foil I used waxed paper and dumped the dough in and loosely rolled it and then twisted up the sized to squeeze in the gaps. Kinda like taffy. This worked great and they came out almost perfectly round.  I also found I only needed to bake these 12-13 minutes. You don't want to over bake them as they brown and aren't as pretty.

This recipe tasted bland, like something was definitely missing.  It took a lot of time and trouble and I was disappointed with the results.  I recommend skipping the red and green sugar crystals.  Dip the cookies in powdered sugar.  They taste very similar to sandtarts, but were too bland without something like powdered sugar.

This is a great cookie recipe, and easy to prepare.  I found that putting the colored sugar into a large zipper bag and then dropping the whole roll in to coat it worked best.  Also, make sure to push the pecan into the dough a bit on top so that it will stay put.  I used my KitchenAid mixer to cream the sugar and cream cheese, I think it would be a bit difficult by hand.  Also, doubling the recipe fills the kitchenaid bowl to the brim......

This is a great cookie recipe.  The flavor is perfect.  Not too sweet and I love the crunch that the nuts give it.  They were easy to make too.  They go perfect with a cup of coffee or cocoa.  Thanks!

These are wonderful tastey cookies and fairly easy to make. If you like an uncomplicated buttery cookie these are for you. Those who said they were bland must like cookies with all kinds of spices in them. The only thing I did differently was to make the dough and refigerate it overnight in a covered bowl. The next day I divided the dough into four portions and rolled each into a log shape using wax paper. Then I rolled the logs in the colored sugar and rolled each log in foil, placed them back in the fridge to firm back up. An hour later they were ready to slice and bake. Thanks DeeDee. This is a keeper!

giving 5 stars for the cookie potential i've made an orange  butter cookie very similar to this without the cream cheese. i can't wait to try this version. one hint that i do; when making your log; put your colored sugar on a piece of waxed paper. form a cookie  log with your hands and then lengthen the log by rolling in the sugar. twist the ends of the waxed paper with the roll inside and refrigerate or freeze until ready to use. mary

Loved this recipe as it goes great with warm drinks, and I love a good warm drink and cookie! though these are fantastic by themselves. Reminds me of a sugar cookie or short bread cookie. The cream cheese gives them something just a slight bit richer, as do the nuts.  I love the colorful sprinkles. My family thought the green ones looked like zucchini slices hehe. so they are now called zucchini cookies.

This recipe is not sweet.  I altered the recipe and added 1 1/2 cups of sugar to make it sweeter.  I also added 2 eggs and 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder.  I refrigerated the cookie mixture for 15 minutes before rolling into small balls.  It was a real treat for adults but the children did not seem to enjoy them at all.

These are good cookies that have a nice cream cheese flavor as long as you don't overbake them.  I left out the pecans because of personal preference but all the other ingredients were the same.  The bake time listed is way too long for 1/4 inch cookies.  10 minutes was perfect.

These cookies are amazing!  I never put the large pecan on each cookie and they still turn out incredible.  They're a huge hit every year.  Just watch them in the oven - they don't get very brown so don't just eyeball them, be sure to set a timer to know when to take them out.

These cookies were a breeze! Each year I am involved in a cookie exchange and have to make about 12-15 dozen. These were so simple and easy do-aheads! I added crushed peppermint to some as well! Very good!

These were easy to make and looked very pretty.  However... we thought they were very dull - just not a lot of flavor.  I do think I will try them again and maybe add some lemon flavoring.  I am giving them this many stars because they looked beautiful on my cookie tray at Christmas.

Excellent holiday cookies.  Not really for kids.....we added them to the sugar and gingerbread men cookies and the adults seemed to have appreciated them.   More of a shortbread cookie, but with that hint of cream cheese flavoring.  I loved them.     I think the only problem we had was keeping the pecan nut set on top to stay on.  Otherwise this is an easy and tasty cookie.

Delicious and easy to make for beginners (like me lol).

I used Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks (I am not vegan though, just curious what stuff tastes like.) instead of butter/margarine and it still tasted good.

I didn't care much for the pecans, so I only put one on top of each cookie. They stay on the cookie pretty well as long as you push it in deep enough onto the cookie dough

They would probably taste even better if dried strawberries/blueberries were substituted for the pecans.

Not very exciting.  They do taste good, but the dough was very hard to work with, It was way to soft and sticky even after refridgerating overnight.  They were hard to roll, hard to cut and didn"t come out looking very good.  The colors and pecans do make them look festive.  They were not a big hit.  I probably won't make them again.

These are delicious cookies! The only thing I changed was to use 1 tablespoon of vanilla. The dough is no harder to work with than other roll type cookies. I refrigerated the dough for about an hour, then divided it into the 4 rolls and put the sugar on wax paper and coated the dough. Rolled the logs tightly in the wax paper and chilled overnight. These will make a wonderful addition to my give away cookie platters. Thank you!

i love these cookies! They are delious! I made a few ajustments and used butter flavored crisco instead of the butter to do this use 1 stick crisco and add 6 tbsp of water. i also did not add the nuts on top just in the cookie itself and rolled it in choclate sprinkles.

These are rather a flat tasting cookie.  Maybe appealing to someone drinking coffee but definitely not a keeper with the grandchildren or husband.

They are pretty cookies, however, I agree, they did taste like flour.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I didn't use the nuts, but these still looked really cute, and since they were uniform in size they fit better into storage containers. My boyfriend loved them, I thought they were missing something... sugar? vanilla? salt? frosting? A little bland, but still a great Christmas recipe.

I didn't bother with cutting, or adding the sprinkles, or chilling the dough over night. Instead, I added a lot of cocoa and made them into chocolate cheesecake type of cookies and dropped them on the tray. Turned out excellently!!

These were really good, but you have to refrigerate them for a long time.  I had them in there for about 9 hours and it still wasn't long enough.  The first batch looked really sloppy and disfigured!  So with the rest of them I sliced the rolls and then molded the cookies with my hands to make nice circles.  Then I dipped the tops of the cookies in the colored sugar and the ugly batch got dipped in chocolate.  Yummy!

We like everything less sweet, so we were attracted by the criticism that this recipes wasn't "sweet enough". We omitted the nuts, replaced sugar with honey and added little white chocolate and dried cranberry (no sprinkles). Used this recipe for Valentine's Day and shaped them into hearts. They kept shape nicely and were delicious. I noticed they seemed to take a long time to brown, and then seemed to suddenly brown quickly at the end. I've tried many cream cheese cookies recipes, and this is the best I've found.

These cookies might need to be outlawed around here. Biggest hit I have ever made. And I froze some on a whim and they worked fine 3 weeks later. If you like shortbread you will love them. If not then you will find them too bland.

A very nice looking Christmas cookie but seemed to lack a little bit of flavor.  My husband really like them though but I found the effort it took to make them (not a big fan of the two day process) wasn't worth the taste for me.

These are as beautiful as they are yummy! I will make these every year. They take a bit of time, although they aren't difficult. Kids may not like them because of the nuts, but adults will love them.

Very good. Almost like a shortbread. I had enough baking done with nuts, so instead I used chopped red and green candied cherries. Next time I will double the amount to 1 cup.

I found this recipe over 10 years now, This site was called CookieRecipe.com at that time. I have made them every year at Christmas time and LOVE them! This year I made the dough on Sunday evening knowing I would busy during the work week and just made them 2 days later and they turned out beautifully. Excellent cookie!

nice balance of sweet cream cheese and salty pecans (only used 1/3 cup pecans) Cream cheese is a bit subtle but still YUMMY.
Rolling dough in parchment paper seems to work better.  Had trouble getting sugar to stick - next time i will try coating it before i chill it while it is still soft.

This is an easy recipe to make and I liked the fact I didn't have to bake them the same day. I'm glad I read the reviews because the day I baked them they were hard and the taste was disappointing, but the second day...yummy...they are delicious and soft. I will definitely make them again.

After reading other reviews, I added 1 teaspoon  of cinnamon. Another commenter said they set the dough in the freezer for a few minutes then dropped it on the prepared cookie sheet. I did that as well then sprayed the bottom of a glass with Pam, dipped into a mixture of colored sugar and remaining chopped pecan, and flattened the cookies. It is necessary to dip the glass in the sugar mixture before flattening each cookie. I will make these again.

For anyone who thought this was a bland cookie recipe try this! Better than alfajores in my opinion.
I think this is an excellent recipe! I made sandwich cookies and they were awesome! I rolled the dough out about 1/4 inch thick and cut it with my square cookie cutter. I was able to make more than 40 cookies. I then filled them with dulce de leche! Yum! They looked beautiful too! Don't forget to dust them with powdered sugar! pretty pretty pretty!
Thanks for this awesome recipe!

So easy to do and tastes soooo good.  Everyone loves them.  Have made the dough and left it in the refrigerator several days (because I got too busy to make the cookies the next day), and they still turned out terrific!  Highly recommend.

I made this cookies for the first time for my Cookie platter. Was looking for a different type of cookie... and I found it.
They taste so good and have nice flavor. The sugar crystalizes on the cookie and gives it a nice little crunch but the middles are nice and soft. 
Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I gave these cookies 3 stars because they did look beautiful but they tasted plain and boring. you could taste a little bit of the cream cheese but that was the only flavor. I didn't like the texture either it was not chewy or cakey it was just different. My husband said they tasted like malt o meal.

Delicious!  Didn't change recipe at all and turned out perfectly.  Used serated knife to cut dough. Didn't have a problem at all and I only refrigerated for 2 hours.  Will be a staple recipe throughout the year.

Because earlier reviewers reported these as being a bit bland, I added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the mix. They smelled wonderful baking and are very tasty and pretty. A nice addition to the Christmas cookie tray!

Eh...these we're ok.  I didn't top with the pecan and only refridgerated for 3 hours, but I don't think that was the problem.  The dough was still easy to work with I just don't think they're very flavorful.  Look pretty though for a christmas gift tray, but I probably won't make again.

These cookies are great!!!  I made them square like somebody suggested on the comments, but I did not place the pecan on top.  I did use the sugar crystal wish gave it the right amount of sweetens.

I made these cookies and everyone seemed to enjoy them.  I thought they tasted much better the next day rather than right out of the oven for some reason.  I brought them to the staff room and the rest of the teachers helped make them disappear quickly.  The only thing I didn't do was put the pecan halves on top.  I also baked them right on the aluminum foil rather than on the cookie sheet and they were still delicious.  I think next time I will try putting the pecan halves on top of the cookies.

My mother made fantastic Christmas cookies, so my brother and I are cookie connoisseurs. This is my first attempt to follow in mom's footsteps. And my first batch of Cream Cheese Christmas cookies are so-so. Not bad. Not great. My next batch will be with peppermint chips, but I'm stumped what else to do to make them baffo. Your suggestions are much appreciated. Wish me luck and Merry Christmas to each one of you. I always adjust a recipe with your comments.

This is a recipe I got from my Mom as I was heading for marriage. I've been making these cookies since the late 1970's. My children have grown up and still ask for them at Christmas. Only difference is I use chopped walnuts.

So quick and easy to make.  I followed another reviews advice and sprinkled sugar on wax paper and rolled the dough out before putting in fridge or freezer.   Then take the rolls and put in freezer  for just a little while. So easy to slice  at this point.   Looks so pretty on cookie trays along with other cookies. And taste so good. I did not place pecans on top they were great as is.

Good cookie that is not too sweet yet not too bland. I placed the colored sugar in a ziplock bag instead of rolling. Will add them to yearly cookie list.

Saw these and had to try them.  The dough was delicious and I could have eaten it that way.  The dough was still sticky after 15 minutes in the fridge so I put it in the freezer for 10.  that made it easier to roll in the foil.

I made half the cookies 24 hours later and they turned out great. As another reviewer stated the sugar on it made it crunchy and yummy.  My husband thought the sugar made it too sweet so I will try it out with less sprinkled sugar.
I will definitely make them again.

loved these cookies!! I had been baking all day so to find one that required overnight time in the fridge was just fine. Mix was easy, followed the other reviewers suggestions to really cream the butter and cream cheese with the sugar very fluffy. Found the dough a tad bland ( you can taste it , no eggs.) so added a few drops of lemon extract but that did not do it so added a few drops of almond extract and that was it for me. Rolled them in the sugar crystals right away before the fridge and the sugar stayed on very well.
Great recipe as is just adjust  to your personal taste.
I also noted the difficulty with holding the pecan  on top so I brushed the tops with a tiny bit of milk and since my kitchen was warm from baking already the dough had softened , a little  pressure when placing the nuts did the job. I also got the added bonus of the tops had a little shine. very pretty cookies and not so overly sweet. 
Thanks to the reviewer that mentioned her kids called them cucumber cookies, I chuckled as I made the green ones , they do look a bit like cucumber slices.
Also since they soften a bit sitting after cutting you can reform them to be more regular in shape and round them out or square them as you please. This made 8 dozen cookies for me a  very easy way to make a lot of cookies!!
By the way I used unsalted butter, the recipe did not specify, will try salted butter next time just to see.

Thanks for posting  Dee Dee!!

I found this recipe in a magazine 20 years ago and made these delicious cookies every Christmas - with rave reviews.  But sadly I lost the recipe about 6 years back.  Sweet Christmas - now I can make these tasty cookies for 2016!

Baked for 15minutes, any longer the cookies would have been crunchy on the bottom.  Not my favorite cookie.

These are easy, look nice and a good basic cookie. I added a full tsp of vanilla and found they needed to bake 15-16 minutes, just as the recipe instructed.  They weren't over done or too brown.

Don't forget to line the cookie sheet with foil or parchment paper. Epic fail if you don't! Taste good  but can not give this batch as gifts :-0

Lovely cookies.  Only change I made was using waxed paper instead of aluminum foil.  Much easier to work with than foil. I skipped the 'chill before shaping into rolls' step by using wax paper. Mixer to fridge in 10 minutes.

I've been making these for years without the nuts or refrigeration. Use a cookie press or roll into balls and press a chocolate chip in the top, bake as directed. Perfect holiday cookie

I used 1/2 cup chopped almonds instead of the pecans.  Also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract and skipped the nut on top.  These were very good.   I will definitely make them again!

Yes they lack a bit of flavor though they would be as delish as they look.

Hit of my holiday sweet table! Everyone from my 3 year old granddaughter to my 80 year old father in law loved these cookies. They are a bit of work, but so worth it. This cookie isn't real sweet like a lot of cookies and not as rich as one might think given amount the cream cheese and butter in them.

I love these cookies....almost taste like the ones my mother makes every year for Christmas.  I didnt keep the dough in the fridge over night just rolled into logs and stuck in the freezer for one hour.  I added 1 1/2c of sugar and 1 tablespoon of Vanilla Extract.......Delish.  I love these so much.

They were delicious and very pretty. It was actually easy to make them. I made the dough and left it in the freezer for 10-15 min. Then I rolled it into 4 logs, rolled them in red sugar, wrapped them in foil and left them in the fridge for about 2 hours. Will make them again!! Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I thought these cookies were good but not anything to get yipped up about.  I found them kind of messy to make. I will make them again now that I know what to expect and will rerate it if I have better luck.
