7.16.16  As I always do with smoothies/shakes that have oatmeal, I always put that ingredient into the blender first, and give it a good whirl to grind it up.  Blueberries and strawberries are very complementary fruits, but the oatmeal flavor shares equally with the fruit.  Didn’t have vanilla and honey yogurt, so I just used low fat Cabot’s vanilla Greek yogurt and added some honey to the blender.  Today I enjoyed this as a breakfast smoothie.

Just made it.  Very good.  Will definitely make it again.  I didn't have Greet yogurt, just vanilla.  I added a teaspoon of honey.  I only put in 1/2 a cup of ice.  Also, the sugar definitely has to be lessened.  Next time I'll use just 1/3 cup.  If it's still too sweet, I'll try a 1/4 cup the next time.

This is delicious. I only had plain yogurt but it was still great. Blending the oatmeal first was a brilliant idea.

I used Bear Naked Triple Berry granola instead of oats n cut everything in 1/2 to fit in my single cup blender attachment (Ninja) tasted great. Better than tropical smoothie's!
