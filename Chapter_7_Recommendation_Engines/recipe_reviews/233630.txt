7.19.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233630/poppin-jalapeno-blackberry-pie/ ... As Sue's Cooking Today suggested - with my blueberry surplus - I subbed with blues.  My jalapenos weren't very hot & I left them in.  The heat factor increases as it sits.  Although I liked it, I think if I were going for hot & sweet, I'd prefer crushed red pepper flakes rather than jalapeno pepper flavor hot.  It's good though.

This is not the best pie crust recipe in the world, but it is edible.  The filling is pretty delicious though.  That little bite of jalapeno combined with the sweetness of the blackberries and sugar is unexpected and delightful.  I did chop one slice of jalapeno into tiny little cubes and leave it in the filling.  Good stuff!
