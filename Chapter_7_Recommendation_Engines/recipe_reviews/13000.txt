THE BEST!!! Absolutely wonderful. I made it the first time using the full amount of wine that the recipe called for and found it a bit strong but still had a to die for taste. My fiance was hooked. He asked me to make it 3 more times in a 2 week period! I found if you cut the wine in 1/2 it is perfect. So easy and just so good. Serve with some crusty sourdough and eat in front of the fire ... Heaven!

I love this recipe! I have made it for my family several times and my in-laws request it over and over. They love it. I double the amount of crab and add Old Bay seasoning.

I made this bisque for the first course of a formal sit down dinner.  Everyone loved it, & people asked for the recipe.  I used approx. 2lbs of fresh lump crabmeat instead of canned & also ran the hand/food processor through it.  I would use a low sodium soup though, it does have that condensed/sodium soup taste.  But, overall very good & I'll make it again.

This soup was very good, but I did listen to others about the wine.  I added a 1/2 cup while the soup ingredients were warming and then not quite another 1/2 cup at the end when the directions said to add the wine.  I cup of wine was plenty!  I also sauteed some shallots first and then started the rest of the directions.  Our only complaint was that it was too thin.  Will probably use a little less milk next time, but there will certainly be a next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Added 1/2 cup of wine along with the milk/cream and let that cook down a bit.  Then added the other 1/2 cup of wine with the crab meat.  It was perfect.  This is a must keep in our house.

I added extra crabmeat, but used the same amount of wine in the recipie.  I thought it needed less wine.  Next time, I'll use half.  This is a nice easy soup when you don't have time to make it from scratch.

Very nice, my family enjoyed it. The only change I'd make is: I only added 1 cup of wine, and I had to let it cook down a bit, as the aroma nearly knocked me and my fiance over. Other than that, it was a wonderful New Year's day dish!

this was a very simple soup to make, yet very good. I made it as a double recipe and instead of cream of asparugus (couldnt find it) we used cream of shrimp and celery instead. we also used more crab. also, we put about 2t of Old Bay seasoning by way of other reveiwers. This gave the soup a semi-spicy flavor. In general it was a very good soup. My motehr LOVED it!

Wow! Pleasantly surprised with this one! I will admit I was a little nervous because I was using lump crab meat and fresh shrimp but needed something very quick and easy so I decided to give it a try. My entire family is sooo happy I did! I added a couple of things to this to make it go a little further (needed to feed 7) and it really worked out great. I added a can of low sodium cream of potato soup, and a 1/2 pound shrimp (just added the shrimp with the crab and followed directions.) To compensate for the extra soup, I added 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream (used in place of light cream). I also followed other reviews and backed down on the wine. I used approx. 3/4 cup and it was perfect for us. Sprinkled a little Old Bay Seasoning and green onions right before serving and everyone raved & asked for seconds. This will be a regular here. Thanks for sharing!

I used only 1/2 cup of white wine and 1 1/2 cup milk and this recipe still came out runny! I just feel kind of sick to my stomach after eating it. It was so watery I felt like I was drinking a crab-flavored beverage.

You know, I posted this recipe ages ago. Sorry, folks, this is the first time I've read the reviews. Gosh darn, your're all right! It's 1/2 a cup of wine, or 1 cup if you're a fan. Use 1 1/2 cups if your feeling a bit feisty. Of course, that should still leave you plenty for the dinner table.  :)

This recipe is fantastic! I could not believe what a great tasting bisque this turned out to be because it was sooooo easy to make! The only thing I did a little differently, was to only put in 1 cup of wine and I did that only a couple minutes before serving. I will use this recipe very often.

This was wonderful! I made it last night for my boyfriend and I, and it was delicious! I used crab and clams, and also cut the amount of wine in half. Plus I added some garlic powder and some paprika to give it a bit more zing, and it was soooo yummy!!!

I used chicken broth instead of the wine which I do in all of my recipes. It had a good flavor to it but as another reviewer said, it kind of made me sick to my stomach. Won't be making this again, sorry.

Wow!  I made serveral modifications to this recipe, but it turned out DELICIOUS!  While I was cooking the soup/milk/cream, I sauteed a medium sized yellow onion with 3 large cloves of garlic in about 2 TBSP of butter.  I added the onions and garlic before the crabmeat.  I also added a can of clams and a can of salad shrimp, though I'm sure the recipe would have been great as crab-only too.  The recipe didn't really have any spices, so I also added about 1/2 teaspoon each of Old Bay Seasoning, fresh parsley and fresh dill from my garden.  My husband and I LOVED this soup! Will make again and again!!!

Everything tasted fine until I added the wine. I only added less than 1 cup but it still was too strong...one of my guests took one sip and didn't want any more. I had to force myself to finish my half bowl. This recipe should be changed to add only 1/2 cup of wine.

Decent for a quick soup with a homemade taste.  Rather salty, though, even after taking the advice of other reviewers and using low-sodium soups.  

I tried it as written and also with one can of a cream-based soup (usually cream of celery, just a personal preference) and a can of tomato soup.  I might try it with a little tomato sauce rather than soup next time, to thin it out a bit -- a bisque should be creamy, as this is, but not quite as thick as mine came out.

An interesting variation: use one small can each of crabmeat, clams, and baby (salad) shrimp for a seafood combination.  If you're set on a crab soup, don't do it, but I enjoyed it.

Let me start by saying that I have *never* written a negative review on this site, but I feel one is in order here.  

I should have known better than to try a recipe that starts with condensed soups, but I was in a hurry.  It was bland, tasted "unfresh" and my partner looked at me with a "REALLY???" expression on her face....even after I doctored it with garlic, shallots and Parmesan cheese. 

To the reviewer who said this tasted like "restaurant quality", they are right.....it tasted like a concentrated blob that someone added milk to. Sorry, but I will not make again or recommend it.

This is a very impressive soup for a hearty and quick meal!  I had left over blue claw crab meat and shrimp from another recipe and didn't want it to go to waste.  I made this in just minutes and it was delicious.  Changes (to accomodate the contents of my fridge), I did use real crab meat and probably twice as much.  I added approx 1/4 cup of chopped shrimp.  I used 1 cup of light cream instead of 1 1/4 cups of milk.  I like my bisque spicy so I added cayenne pepper and red curry to taste.  Yum!  My husband and guests loved it!

The first bite was good but by the fifth we had to throw it out.  Disappointing and a true waste of good crab meat.

I try to read the reviews first...I missed the comments about how thin this turns out. I only used 1/2 cup of wine and I had to thicken it up and add 4x the seafood the recipe called for to get anywhere near the consistency I consider a bisque to be. Thank you for the post but I don't think I will try this again.

The first time I made this I made it with wine and I hated it.  The second time I took out the wine completely, added a package of imitation crab (along with the recipe's can of crab meat), garnsihed with parsley, and served with toasted sourdough slices.  YUM!  It is quick, easy, and always turns out great.

I made this bisque using canned crabmeat, salad shrimp, and some canned clams. I also used half the amount of wine in the recipe. WOW!! It is a fabulous rich-tasting soup, like something from a fine seafood restaurant but so easy!!  Tastes even better the nex day.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks!!!

My 13 year old daughter and I liked this a lot and decided it's a keeper.  We did alter a little and added some fresh mushrooms and green onion.  We used both clams and lump crab.  My daughter didn't care for the clams so next time we do crab and shrimp or lobster or maybe scallops.

I would look for a stronger seafood flavor in a seafood bisque, but it was very good. I used lobster tails, and it was rich and filling!  Nice addition to a holiday meal.

I'm totally addicted to this easy bisque! 
Like others, I used only 3/4 c. the wine but I think I might use a whole cup next time. 
I added a few dashes of cayenne for a slight spice.
I wanted my soup to be pink instead of white, so I added 8 oz of tomato sauce and it was fabulous. I think it made the flavor of the soup even better.

Super easy & delicious!!! I use my own homemade asparagus soup and also add about 1 T tomato paste. Have made several times and will continue to use this recipe. Thank you very much.

This is an amazingly simple, and amazingly good soup.  So easy to pull together at the last minute, but everyone swears it tastes like homemade!

I really thought this sounded to easy to be good, but it's really a treat. I used cream of potato since I did not have cream of asparagus, I used 2% milk and 1/2 & 1/2, it was a little thin so I used some cornstarch to thicken it. I did use 1 cup of vouvray - 1/2 cup with the soup and other 1/2 at the end. I also added a little of Old Bay, Garlic, Cayenne Pepper & butter.  My picky hubby Loves it and he's not a big lover of wine in soup.

Bisque is delicious. I also used Sherry wine instead of white which I enjoyed even more. I also cooked mussels in the bisque for another incredible dish.

Really good and so quick. I sauteed a chopped shallot in a pat of butter to start, used skim milk to cut the fat, just a splash of half and half, and added dried tarragon and lots of freshly ground pepper. We all had seconds.

I have made this twice within the last week, once for company and once for just us.  Used imitation crab and no wine and different seasonings the second time and it was just as good---really easy to flavor the way you would like to.

I made this for Valentine's Day for my husband. I did cut down on the wine like other's suggested.   We both liked it, but it just wasn't WOW good.  Good enough, but I wouldn't make it to entertain with.  It might be better with scallops or lobster, I used canned crab, maybe that was the problem.

Absolutely AMAZING!!! I only used 1 cup of wine but also added cream of potato soup, clams, and crabmeat! I doctor everything i make so I added my own seasonings like old Bay, cajun seasoning,  and pepper! Will definitely make this over and over again!!!

This was a pretty good recipe and it's quick and easy to make. I used the lump crabmeat out the can and reduced the wine to 1/2 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup the second time around. I've made this recipe a good 7 times already.

I had high hopes but unfortunately was not impressed by the recipe. I added old bay seasoning like other reviewers suggested and I still didn't feel there was enough flavor.

This soup is a hit with my family and guests. Tastes like what you get in a restaurant. I substitute tomato soup for the celery soup. I also sometimes add a can of mini shrimp or whatever other seafood I may have on hand. Works great. A little sherry can be used as well.

Fabulous, homemade-tasting soup!!  My husband and all attendees of our super bowl party loved it!  Per the other reviews, I did half the amount of wine.  Thanks so much for sharing the wonderful recipe.
