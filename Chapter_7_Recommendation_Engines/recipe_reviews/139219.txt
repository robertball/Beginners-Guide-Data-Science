I doubled the amount of garlic right away.  While these were marinating, I made myself a margarita.  My son and husband loved the skewers, daughter didn't care for them, and I loved my margarita a lot more, I'm afraid.  I found the meat to be too sweet, and needed an extra shake of garlic salt once they were done.  I would've given it 3 stars, but like I said, my boys loved it.

Fantastic recipe - the steak really picked up  the flavor of the marinade.  I soaked the bamboo skewers for 30 minutes in the marinade as well prior to threading them.

I followed the recipe except for the peppers.  The marinade gave the meat a nice limey flavor.  This was a welcome change from more traditional grilling marinades.  I will definately make these again.

Easy & tasty! I also skipped the peppers in this recipe only because I'm the only one that likes them and I marinated them overnight.

The first time I tried this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was OK. The second time I tweaked it to my tastes and it was very good. I omitted the sugar, minced 8 large garlic cloves, added a pinch of black pepper and a tablespoon of red pepper flakes, then marinated it at room temp for 2 hours. Delicious!

My family really liked this meat. It was very easy to make, and I liked that it didn't have to marinate for hours or days. Thanks!

Yummy, but I'd add a decent amount of lime juice to make sure it has that lime flavor.

I've been using nearly this same exact recipe for YEARS to make my margarita chicken wings but I always add a quarter cup of high end tequila to it. Really helps the marinade penetrate and all the alcohol burns away during cooking. Also if you peel some lime into the marinade its extra limey. All in what you like.

I've made this recipe several times now and we've used pork and chicken in it too. Easy and excellent. I'd like to try the strawberry margarita mix with chicken and see what happens...

Okay, I tweaked the recipe right away.  I added tequila to the recipe and I included chicken kabobs as well.  The beef was really good but I admit the chicken seasoned and absorbed the marinate much better. I also did veggie kabobs and they were great also.  PLEASE use 1/4 cup of tequila you will be much happier with the end result.

We made the minor tweaks mentioned by previous reviewers - increased the garlic, added pepper and red pepper flakes, omitted the sugar, added lime juice and lime zest, and soaked the skewers in the margarita mix. We also used top sirloin. However, family members felt the lime taste didn't fit with the beef. Sorry - not a keeper.

Husband states very good though not superb.  He's a little spoiled by some other recipes from this site.  Nontheless I will make this again when in the mood for skewers.  Added 2 tbsp lime juice and some minced garlic.  Followed another reviewer's suggestion of marinating the bamboo skewers in the marinade.  We liked small dipping bowls of the marinade on the side.  Served with chilled sliced tomatoes drizzled with a little blue cheese dressing.  More sides would have been too much.  Will experiment with this marinade with chicken and with pork.

Great recipe, YUM! . Added the 1/4 Tequila, great idea! The meat turns out a little tough if you over cook it (so be careful)..Marinating it longer may help too, next time I will. Cooking veggies on separate skewer than meat is a good idea. Thanks for sharing

Just a wonderful new Kabob. 2 more cloves of garlic and I'll have it to our taste.  Wonderful!  We invested in ss skewers several years ago and that's the answer to fixing Kabobs.

I made it per the recipe less the sugar, only because I think the margarita mix is sweet enough.  I marinated the meat for about 2 hours.  It was really good, but I think it could have been even better if it was left in the marinade overnight.  The flavor was great, just not quite strong enough in my opinion.  But I'm definitely going to try it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Big nope for us. I probably didn't marinate the meat long enough but the taste came out somewhere between bland and blah. Made separate batches of steak and chicken. Neither were a hit. I did add some tequila as per other reviews but it  seemed to have left a bit of an unpleasant after-taste.

I didn’t add the extra sugar, and I added the teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I marinared the beef for 2-1/2 hours.  It turned out well.  My husband loved it, said that I could make it every week!

Very delicious, husband like them too. The only thing I did was add extra garlic and didn’t make with mushrooms.  Soaked skewers in water for 30 minutes prior to grilling and assembling

I marinated the meat with the salt, garlic, etc. I then put the mushrooms on a skewer, bell peppers on a skewer and onions on a skewer. I basted the veggies with the marinade a couple of times while it all sat. Oh, I added 1.5  limes to the mix, as I like limes and two chopped up jalapenos.

Made this dish just like the recipe said. The kabobs were delicious! I let my ingredients marinade all day in the refrigerator and when I skewered them up I put the vegetables on separate skewers. I will definitely make these again!

Surprisingly good flavor. I recommend using a better cut of beef for this.

I did some of the additions - tequila, lime juice and extra garlic.  I would say it was o.k. - nothing special.

We tried it as written  Great!  Yet we added a 1/4 cup of lime juice to the left over marinade in the slip lock bag,  and used this little dab to brush the skewers.

Very tasty.  We enjoyed this twist on beef skewers.  As others recommended I added tequila to the marinade.
