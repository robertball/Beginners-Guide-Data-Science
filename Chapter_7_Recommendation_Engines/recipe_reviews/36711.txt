Of the many burgers we consumed this past holiday weekend - this was a favorite. I prepared these ahead of time to take with us up north. I did fry up a couple slices of bacon, cooled and then crumbled into the beef mix. I also added a dash of all-season salt. I'm not sure if refrigerating helped them "stick" better or not but we had VERY few problems with them holding together on the grill. These were great! The added bacon (and ofcourse the onions) added a great twist. Thanks!

Excellent tasting burgers!  The consistency was perfect to keep them from falling apart when cooking.  I didn't have cast iron pans so I used my nonstick and they still turned out great!  I will definitely make these burgers again.

My husband, like so many others, loves burgers and his response to this recipe was, "It's okay."  It is something different to do with hamburg but, really, it's just mini-meatloaf on a bun.  Think I'll stick to my old standard of burgers topped with a nest of caramelized onions.  It's easier than fussing with the egg white, etc.

This was excellent! I am trying to cook healthier for my family. My husband hates onions, but like French onion soup. I made the recipe according to the directions except I added a can of mushrooms in and then topped them with a slice of Provolone. Not as healthy as the original, but the Provolone was not even necessary since the burgers were excellent. I normally add a lot of spice and seasonings and I didn't at all, I followed it exactly except for adding the mushrooms. Full of flavor and taste.  This recipe is definately a keeper and we will be making it again for sure!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I wasn't sure about the "bleu cheese sauce", but it was good.  I will make it again but next time I will grill it!

Super recipe!  The burgers were super juicy and easy to make.  I only used 1 cup of chopped onion, and sauteed them in olive oil.  This is going to be a regular in my house; move over lipton onion soup mix!

My hubby could eat burgers every night of the week! Although he's perfectly happy with the frozen hockey pucks he buys for himself, I decided to treat him with a "real" burger. Me being me, added more seasonings, however, words cannot describe how excited he was over this recipe....pathetic isn't it?

I love burgers and I love onions.  These were good but some of the patties did not stay together at all-don't know what I did/didn't do-but I will make again and try to find a way to keep them all intact.

The burgers kinda fell apart when I was flipping them.  Maybe next time I'll add some bread crumbs.

These were OK. A bit too much like meatloaf (which I hate with a passion) to suit my tastes, but my family enjoyed them. Good recipe for kids that like onions.

Prepared these in advance and brought them to a cook-out last night.  I doubled the recipe, shaped the patties and stored them in Tupperware's stacking burger rounds.  The egg-whites seemed to make these burgers somewhat difficult to form as it was quite wet.  I was tempted to use breadcrumbs or something to make the mixture easier to handle.  But, I didn't.  Storing the pre-formed burgers in the fridge might have helped.  They grilled well on the gas grill.  Excellent recipe!  Everyone raved over them, and they were especially great with the bleu cheese dressing.  Did need a sprinkling of salt, too. My husband was skeptical... "Why can't we just have regular burgers?  All day, I've looked forward to a regular burger...  Yada, yada, yada".  Anyway, HE was the biggest FAN!  He kept telling everyone how awesome they were! Thanks!

Big hit with my husband even without using the dressing and just using regular ketchup.  I make up a batch and keep them in the freezer for when someone wants a quick burger.

Yummy recipe. I added some BBQ sauce to the meat mixture before I formed the patties. I also sprinkled in some Montreal Steak Spice which added a nice flavour :)

Pretty good, would make again, but if you cut down the recipe just for two, dont use a whole egg, it makes the mix too wet.

Made this for dinner last night. Wasn't too impressed. They tasted rather bland even though I added Italian seasoned bread crumbs. My husband makes better hamburgers than this. Will not make again.

Good flavor and very moist.   The kids weren't too crazy about the onion chunks but mom and dad were happy!

I made this for dinner last night.  They were absolutely delicious.  My husband and I loved them.  The only thing I didn't use was the blue cheese dressing.  The only problem I had was that it made my house kind of smokey.  Yummy recipe!

These were really good!  I added some basil, thyme and garlic powder and left out the egg.  I will be making these again!

Tasty and not too oniony like I thought they would be. Although the onion did make them a little hard to keep from crumbling, but we loved them. 
I serve these with cheddar cheese on top and no bun!

These burgers were pretty good.  I had a hard time getting them to stick together, but I think this is operator error and not a problem with the recipe.

I used the whole egg so it would give the meat mixture better consistency.  These were really good-I can't wait to make these on the grill.

Delicious, flavorful burgers for people who love onions. They were kind of loose and moist, but they held together on the grill.

I usually don't 'cook light' because the taste is just not there, as I found with this recipe.  I will just continue to cook the 'fat' way and just eat smaller portions.  If I am going to cook, which I love to do, I am going to make it good.
