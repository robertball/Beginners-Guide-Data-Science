Wowza! I was looking for a new recipe to try with some chicken breasts and used the ingredients search tool. I didn't have to look far at all when I came across this recipe. Having a detailed video to watch is always a nice bonus . . . and your helpful tips are always appreciated!
I loved that this recipe had few ingredients but maximum flavour, and a neat method to "glue" the nuts to the chicken! The family really enjoyed it!! The only thing I might try differently next time is to cut the chicken breasts in 2 or 3 pieces before coating (which will likely require double the coating ingredients). Looking forward to making this again!

This recipe was recommended to me on YouTube and it's the one that introduced me to Chef John.  I've made it more than once and it's really good. I also like the jokes and now I'm a big Chef John fan.

Did not refrigerate. Did pound the chicken because the breasts were so large. Chicken was super moist and tasty. My husband said it was a hit!

This chicken recipe was delicious and the sauce was great. I added some butter to the sauce with finely chopped, almost grated walnuts to add some thickness and flavor. I will defiantly be making again. *I didn't refrigerate cause I didn't have time*
