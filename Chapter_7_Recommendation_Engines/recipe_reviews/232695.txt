The batter was too thick so it didn't spread well in the pan. They were thicker than I expected. I only had large curd cottage cheese, and that wasn't the best thing to use. Next time I will add use small curd and see if it spreads better, and I will add some cinnamon and vanilla next time. This is a great recipe though if you are watching your carb intake.

I didn't want to wait 1 hr to dry out cottage cheese so I did what I do when a recipe calls for dried out spinach. I placed it in a hand towel and twisted until all excess moisture is gone! Scrape off the towel into the bowl. The pancakes turned out great!

I was really pleased with these!  I was craving pancakes and these hit the spot.  Plus, if you're like me, I had all of these items on hand in my kitchen.  I have made them twice.  I have added a few items each time - some chopped nuts, some banana, some berries... it's a fun basic low carb batter to experiment with...

awesome  recipe.  I  added a 1/4 tsp baking powder to make them fluffier, turned out great. If you like cinnamon add a shake or two.

Wow! I couldn't believe how little flour goes into these! I followed the recipe but: didn't drain the cottage cheese  (lazy), added spices  (cinnamon, vanilla,  cardamom), added baking powder as suggested by other reviews,  2 tablespoons of ground flax seed,  and subbed raspberries for blueberries because they needed to be used up.  

overall, I loved it and will make again,  but will cut down on the salt because my cottage cheese probably added enough.  

served with jam.

The first time I made this somehow I totally missed step number one about drying out the cottage cheese.  The pancakes turned out fine so if you don't have time don't let that stop you.  I just now made them again, the same way, but this time I decided to make a savory version by adding chopped parsley, onions and a little parmesan.

These turned out great!  Like others I was too lazy to strain the cottage cheese and I did add 1/2 tsp baking powder. These were a big hit in my low carb house.

I'd make it again, but I probably wouldn't buy cottage cheese for the sole purpose of making these. It was good though and next time I make them I want to banana. To me this tasted something like a french toast/pancake combination, and it was a bit tricky to cook. The first one I made looked done but was  a soggy custardy mess on the inside. I turned the temp down to medium low and it took a while to cook, but when it finished it was good. I did decide to make a few adjustments after reading other reviews and realizing it wouldn't affect the end result to much. I made these in the blender, first blending the cottage cheese (which I forgot to drain) till it was smooth. Then added the eggs, and because this was my first time making these I had to make a decision to add 3, or just 2 incase I didn't like it and wanted to make reg pancakes. I went with 2 since I realized I had extra liquid from the undrained cheese. Then I added everything else in and blended in the lowest setting till combined.  It seemed to liquidy, I think blending the cottage cheese till smooth changed the consistency and it want drained so there's that too,  so I mixed in a bit more  flour, maybe somewhere between 1/2 and 1/3 cup. Oh, I also used coconut oil instead of butter because I am, shockingly, almost out of butter.

Great recipe for low carb - I added a tablespoon ground flax seed, 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla or maple flavoring and one and 1/2 tsp baking powder to make fluffy - I also did not drain the cottage cheese - yum - Thanks Karynin

These are very tender and I think the blueberries made a big difference.   They are a little eggy compared to a crepe or pancake.   Overall these were well received.

I wanted this to be keto friendly so I used whole milk ricotta cheese and almond flour. They turned out great. And the macros were perfect for keto diet. Next time I will add a little bit of vanilla and cinnamon for flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe!?

Been experimenting and I like it better with ricotta cheese. Also added a little vanilla. I also don't drain the cheese.

You need a lot more flour for these to hold together!  Give it one start because I had to modify it to a point of no return

These turned out delicious and perfectly fluffy! I added 1/2 teaspoon of white sugar because I didn’t add the blueberries and this adds a little sweet for the perfect pancakes

Turned out very runny so I had to add flour.  I will try blending the cheese first to make it smoother as well.  We added bananas and vanilla. They tasted food, just thinner than expected.

Great recipe! Didn’t have time to drain the cottage cheese but i don’t think that mattered much. Recommend spraying the spatula with cooking spray. They can be tricky to flip.

These were good, I added a bit of coconut flour to thicken the batter more and they turned out better 2nd time. The batter should be a little thicker than regular pancake batter before frying. I fried in coconut oil and topped with raw organic honey. I plan to these make again.

I'll try it again, but next time I'll actually strain the cottage cheese and drop it by the spoonfuls like it said.  Stuck terribly to the skillet, too, when I broke it up into smaller pieces to flip.

Pretty good. Does need to cook quite a while at 350 degrees to overcome the moisture, even w/ straining the cottage cheese (which I like as a great source of low fat protein). Added a few blueberries for sure (adding to the moisture). A dash of cinnamon and couple drops of vanilla helped the flavor as well. Will fix again.

These were good.  Turned out good.  A bit flat but I didn't care.  Taste is somewhat blah but based on the ingredients this wasn't a huge surprise.  I added a bit of vanilla.  A person could add more depending on what you wanted to use them for.  Overall they were a great low carb option.
