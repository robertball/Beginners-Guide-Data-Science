It's helpful to whisk the miso paste and rice wine vinegar together to a smooth consistency before adding the remaining ingredients ... And I recommend adding the sesame seeds to the salad, not to the dressing.

KEEPER! My hubby loved this! I did not change a thing and it is spot on - delicious. Miso paste can be found in the refrigerated section of any Asian Market. I served this with Miso Glazed Skirt Steak - this site and grilled pineapple spears and steamed sugar snap peas. Perfect dinner!

decrease the 1 1/2 tablespoons of Miso Paste to a more manageable taste and this can be a very nice dressing....personally I think it should be 2 tsp....:-)

This dressing taste better on the second day and beyond. Next time I will decrease the amount of miso by 1/2 tsp.  I added  a 1/2 tsp of peanut butter because I wanted that peanut taste. I will make again.

This recipe is amazing!  I just love it.  I triple it so that it blends better in my Vitamix.  I dont care for the ginger minced, prefer it much finer.

This was easy to make and delicious. I am trying to replicate a dressing that I had at a restaurant, and this is not quite it, but it is still good, and I would make it again. Thanks!

I make this often. I like to add juice from a a nice wedge of fresh lemon. It really makes the difference and tastes sweet and lighter. I didn't have any lime juice but will try that later too!

This is the best miso dressing I've ever made. I didn't see my unseasoned rice wine vinegar so used my seasoned one. It still came out great. Of course when I put the seasoned vinegar up this huge bottle of unseasoned was staring me right in the face.

Perfect!!  Didn't change ingredients. I did use my immersion blender to mix all ingredients except sesame seeds.  I stirred the seeds in after.  I made it for use on salmon tacos, worked our nicely.  THANKS!!

I doubled the recipe to have more for the week. I also used a ginger grater to get more juice out of the root. I then minced some for texture. I left out the sesame seeds because I didn't have any.

Delicious! I made 4 times the recipe. My family likes their dressing on the tart side, so instead of 5 Tbl. of honey, I only used 3 Tbl. This recipe is a keeper!

I used a small amount of lemon juice because I didn’t have any lime juice. I also wanted to avoid oil, so I substituted it for one tsp of crushed sesame seeds. It was so good! I can’t wait to make it again, so thank you for a great recipe!

I don’t cook very much, but sometimes I’ll go to a Japanese restaurant just to get the avocado salad with this dressing on it. I finally asked the sushi chef what was in it and he said “miso paste and vinegar “so I searched for a recipe with those ingredients, bought some miso paste and sesame oil and made this in five minutes. I drizzled some over an avocado and it’s perfect! I am so happy!

No changes to the dressing. Did not have oranges. My salad, this time, was greens, purple cabbage, jicima, avocado, black sesame seeds, tomato, red yellow and orange bell pepper topped with sliced grilled chicken breast.

Throw it all in a vitamix. No need for chopping. Perfect. Exactly the dressing I was hoping for. I made the dressing x10 and worked well. Kept well for a couple weeks

This recipe is a good base - I personally loved it but found it to strong for many people & children - so I modified it so it is milder - I added good quality olive oil, & a paste of ( ground sesame seeds and ground pine nuts ground in my coffee grinder ) - you have to blend in the ground seeds & nuts  but it adds a creamy texture - less salty ( I used roasted sesame see oil as well)  - not sure if that was meant by the person who created this great idea...

Thought this was a great Chinese style dressing and not  fattening with the lack of much oil.   I was a little heavy handed with the ginger, but still tasty with lots of flavors.   Will keep this in my Asian recipes file for further uses.  I used it on mixed greens  with toasted almonds and fresh grapefruit slices.
Thanks for sharing..........

I left out the honey an added 2 tablespoons of gluten free soy sauce and some garlic powder. Mixed it in the magic bullet. Next time I will add a small clove of fresh garlic.  Also,  I did not add sesame seeds.
