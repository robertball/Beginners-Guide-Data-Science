This is one of my favorite ways to eat asparagus. I do add one clove of minced garlic to the mix before I roast the asparagus. This is also just as good cold.

What is not to like?  Asparagus and balsamic were just meant to go together.  I fine dusting of Parmesan cheese would be great with this.  I roasted on a sheet pan, at 400 for 10 minutes.  Perfect!

I had been craving asparagus lately.  I found this recipe and just had to try it!  It was sooooooo good!  Even my 15 y.o. son who normally won't eat asparagus enjoyed it this way and had a generous helping!  I think that speaks highly of any recipe when someone is able to enjoy eating something they normally don't like. I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!! xoxoxoxoxoxoxo

I gave this 5 stars for ease of preparation and great taste.  I dusted it with a  little garlic powder, and sprayed it with olive oil rather than drizzle the oil.  Everyone at the table had seconds and there was none left at the end of the meal.  Thanks for the great & simple recipe!

I made this for Easter dinner. Several family members raved. I did add garlic per others' suggestions. I will make this again.

Such a simple and great way to prepare asparagus. I always add a couple of cloves of chopped garlic along with the oil and S&P. I drizzle some balsamic on the asparagus for the last 5 min of cooking, and then add a bit of extra thick balsamic when I serve it - either the fancy thick expensive stuff, or I make a quick stovetop reduction with a tiny sprinkle of sugar on top. Always a favourite!

Asparagus was on sale and in season at the grocery store yeah! This recipe was very good and oh so easy. I hadn't thought about putting balsalmic on asparagus but it was really good. I sprinkled some dried cranberries and pine nuts and tossed with the asparagus prior to baking just to jazz it up. Roasting with these additions turned out really nice. I think the olive oil was a little heavy and I think next time I'll use just 1 Tblsp. I also used a sheet pan suggested by another reviewer. I will make this again.

This was amazing just the way it is. I used a blend of La Vecchia Dispensa's 10 and 16 year Balsamic drizzled over the top. Yum! Thanks for the recipe, much better than boiling the asparagus.

This is the first time trying asparagus and the first recipe I have tried and it turned out great. I am now a big asparagus fan and I will be defiantly doing this recipe again in the near future.

My 7 year old son begged me to review this asparagus b/c he LOVED IT!!!!  Yummy.  I baked for 8-9 minutes and that was plenty so it had a little crispness still.  A huge amt of asparagus was gone between the 3 of us.

Excellent! I also added some parmesan after the balsamic. My husband and I both LOVED it (and he's not big on asparagus). My daughter is the only one who wouldn't it, but she's only 1.5yrs and doesn't like green foods right now.

Easy and quick with ingredients that I usually have on hand. I cut the oil back to one tablespoon and roasted mine with fresh garlic for ten minutes as they were small. I added a few tablespoons of toasted pine nuts before serving for some extra crunch. I served this with pan seared salmon and Mushroom Orzo, also from this site.

Oven temp was a bit high . Had to watch closely . Marinated mine in a ziplock and added minced garlic !! (rather than sprinkling balsamic on at the end) I also drizzled more at the end !!!!!
 I love asparagus in general , but this really did not have the normal asparagus taste at all . So, if you have someone who is not crazy about it , they probably would go for it !!!! This will be a regular for me !!

03.17.17 ~ Not our traditional St. Patrick's Day meal - but roasted asparagus, meatloaf and baked potato did hit the spot.  This recipe comes together very quickly and I like that I can scale it back for two people with no leftovers.

So simple and so delicious!  Thanks Gemini26!   I added a sprinkling of garlic powder, and cooked mine for about so min. bc they were really skinny, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. You should try this one. It's a keeper!

Fantastic. It's the only way I can get my non-asparagus loving husband to eat this healthy veggie. I cut the cooking time since we like  them al dente (so the spears still have a nice crunch), but the roasted flavor comes thru.

Would make again.  Only made a half recipe, added 2 cloves garlic chopped thin and tossed.  Baked for 8 mins then added balsamic and baked for 2 more.  Came out nice and crunchy with good flavor and family enjoyed.  I used a small pyrex roasting pan so not sure if that made the difference as I saw others say it came out mushy.

Pretty much the only way I'll prep asparagus now. It was still crisp and flavorful plus it's very quick and easy to throw together!

Thanks, great, easy way to cook delicious asparagus. 8 minutes was perfect for my bunch. Nice beside steak & a glass of Valpolicello wine.

We became so used to soy sauce on our asparagus that this was a welcomed change.  It's especially good when it's grilled on the barbie. This is now our go to asparagus recipe. Thanks for the great idea.

I tried this recipe today in a much smaller amount. If you like mushy, stringy asparagus, this is for you. I was looking more for a firm texture. I cooked it for the minimum it called for, and did not care for it at all. had the texture been better, the flavor would be fine. I added garlic powder too,as reviewers suggested,  and skipped the balsamic since it was already so mushy, and as I said, I basically was only using the recipe for the cook time. I will try steaming it next time. Based on what I was hoping for, I wouldn't give this any more than one star.

It was good but I think next time I'd add some garlic while roasting and/or add some soy sauce along with the vinegar. The balsamic wasn't quite strong enough on its own for me so I might also try a balsamic reduction.
