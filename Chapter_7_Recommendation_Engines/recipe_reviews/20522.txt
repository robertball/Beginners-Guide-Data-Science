I just love eatin' them lil' rodents.  My  SKWERL still had nuts in his cheeks.  We called it skwerl almondine.  That was some fancy eatin'..  8/2919, I reviewed this 6 years ago, but now a few other have and I still laugh and laugh.  The picture posted had me in tears.

I browned the meat in a little 5w30 first just to get a little sear on it. When I was done I had dinner and an oil change!
