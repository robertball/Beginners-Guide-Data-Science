People said it was a little plain on its own so my sister and I decided to add some jalepenos, salt and pepper. Well we wanted to make 48 of them, which equals two packs of the pilsbury dough.... we had to buy four packs cause my brother ate the first pack, and the rest of the family ate the second one! When we brought it to the party, it was gone within the hour and we got a million compliments!!!

These are easy and quick to make for a party.  They are delicious warm, but loose their appeal when they are not.  If you need to transport these to a party, put them in a container so that they can be re-warmed in a conventional oven.

Pretty good, and an interesting use for crescent roll dough.  We were having an "appetizer" theme gathering over the holidays, so the bottoms of these got quite burnt, but probably just because we were so busy preparing everything else.  I'd try them again!

Very easy to make and the tasting. One tip  -- put them in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes; makes cutting them so much easier.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were nothing exciting.  Will not make again.
