Wow-what a surprise. I don't (didn't) even like sweet potatoes but I loved this dish. My husband loved it as well. The only changes I made was that I added some red onion to it about half way through cooking in the oven and I omitted the mushrooms, although I am sure my husband would have loved to have had them. Also, it only took about 20-25 min in the oven. Maybe I cut the potatoes pieces smaller-I don't know. But just as long as you watch it and stir it up every 7-10 min it turns out great! It also may have made a diff that I cooked it in a cast iron skillet that I just transferred to the oven. However you do it, you are sure to love it. I will for sure make this again (soon) You could easily scale it to any serving amount you want. It would be a great pot luck dish as well. You should try this!

I really enjoyed this. I cut my potatoes rather small, and heated my baking dish in the oven while it was pre-heating as I wanted to hurry along the baking process. I halved the recipe and added about a 1/4 of an onion, sliced and also used fresh parmesan.  I only baked it for 30 minutes, but next time will cut the veggies larger and bake for the full hour as the best part of the dish was the crunchy little pieces!
UPDATE:
I did make this again cubing the potatoes rather than dicing them and baked for 1 hr. We really liked it better the first time with the more bite sized pieces, the shorter cooking time was also better for us and the zucchini since it was over cooked this time. I also had used yams the first time rather than sweet potato and I also liked that better.  Still love the recipe, though.  The kids (a picky 5 and skeptical 3 yr old) like the meal too!

Delicious, we will definitely be having this again.  We are not fans of mushrooms, so I substituted dicesred bell pepper.  The combination of colors made it look as good as it tasted.  Thankyou Chefbound

This recipe was awesome. My husband is usually not a casserole lover but he raved about it. The only thing I added was a diced onion and some minced garlic cloves. It was delicious and the house smelled wonderful while it was baking. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe. Will definitely be making this again.

This was very good! I know I will be making this again. We made it a vegetarian meal, so no chicken. We didn't have mushrooms, and I don't like them anyway, so I omitted those too. However, I do think the mushrooms would have enhanced the taste, and hubby convinced me to include them next time. Cooked for a little less than an hour, with the potatoes and zucchini cubed about 1/4" big (used our chopper, so all the pieces were the same size). I did have to add salt to taste, once on my plate, but that may be because the bread crumbs I used were not seasoned. We still enjoyed it though.

I thought this was an excellent and unusual recipe.  My husband doesn't like mushrooms, so I took the tip to substitute red pepper.  We also added some chopped up onions, real garlic and extra breadcrumbs.  We made 1/2 a recipe, and it still fed 3 people with a little leftover.    I would recommend this and will definitely be making it again, thanks for the great recipe!

I was skeptical but this was delicious! I halved (wish I hadn't) the recipe and only added some chicken seasoning to the chicken before cooking. So good, my husband wanted it a night later!

Simple, easy, and has the added advantage of being able to combine several leftover fridge ingredients along with canned stuff you keep in the pantry on hand. Tasty with the addition of some fresh veggies!

This dish is amazing. We don't exactly love zucchini so I used my slap and chop and cut them very fine. Also used gluten free crutons and left the chicken on the side to add if desired.  This is amazing!

I'm sorry, but I really didn't like this recipe. I tried it, but it just didn't make my taste buds dance. Will try making it again only minusing a few things and adding a few things. Do love the fact that it is all fresh veggies.

I've never made this recipe to the letter I've always modified it - and I must say that I LOVE it with the modifications.  
First, I use only butternut squash, sweet potatoes and mushrooms for vegetables.  I peel the squash and potatoes and cut to a uniform bite size.  This is key as you're roasting everything.  I cook the two chicken breasts and cut to a similar size.  Mix these four ingredients together and season; 2t garlic salt, 1/4t each salt and pepper.
Second, I take the bread crumb, oil, and parmesan mix and make it half again - so there is 3/4 c of each bread crumbs and parmesan, and 1/4+ oil.  I think this takes this casserole to the next level.  

You need to know that this will be hard to fit into a 9x13 but as it cooks it all cooks down, just be careful while mixing and you'll be so glad in the end!  I don't think this needs the zuchinni or red potato.  I think that the zuchinni would be mush by the end of the roasting time and red potatoes are bland carbs that you don't need here.

I tweaked this recipe a bit, but it made a lot more than four servings!  I used half the mushrooms and chopped up a green bell pepper that I added along with the zucchini, etc.  Next time I would add some diced onions to the chicken as well. I cooked the chicken in a large oven safe skillet, so no need to transfer to a baking dish once the veggies are added.

We really enjoyed this! I used leftover rotisserie chicken. I sautéed 1/3 cup onions in the oil with the mushrooms and substituted 1/4 cup almond flour for the breadcrumbs to make the recipe grain free. I only baked it for 35 minutes - perhaps I had cut my potatoes smaller than others. Thanks for the recipe!

Versatile, bkz you can adjust vegetables to what you have on hand. I used onions instead of mushrooms. Also cut the potatoes smaller so it would cook in under an hour. I reduced the ingredients slightly because they seemed like a lot for the four of us.

This was really tasty. My husband is not a big veggie fan but he went back for seconds. I swapped out a couple of the vegetables to use up the fresh produce I had on hand, and I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs so I used stuffing mix crushed with a rolling pin. Otherwise I followed the recipe and will definitely be making again.

Made it almost exactly as recipe and it was a big hit. Tastes even better the next day. I added a little white wine about half way through as I thought it was maybe a bit dry. Will be a regular dish in our house now.

I didn't add the red potatoes. I thought it was delicious and everyone liked it. The flavor was great! Check the potatoes frequently and take it out as soon as they get soft enough - you don't want it to get too mushy. I think I baked it about 45 minutes.

We loved this recipe & will be making it again. I did not have mushrooms so used red peppers as suggested in the reviews. I added a pinch of crushed red pepper to give a hint of a kick. I also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder & used half summer squash along with the zucchini. I made a portion of the recipe vegetarian for my daughter who is allergic to chicken - she loved it too!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Very good as written. I did use a little more bread crumbs and added basil and oregano but I believe in hind sight did not need any extra.

I had a lot of veggies from my co-op delivery so I incorporated them into the recipe.  I didn't have sweet potatoes, and I'm sure that would have been good.  I started with the potatoes and put them in the oven to start cooking while I prepared the rest.  I used canned mushrooms,chicken, yellow squash, tomatoes, a couple green and one red hot pepper.  I was going to steam some kale as a side, but decided to add that in at the very end.  I liked the parmesan and bread crumbs (used gluten free).  I'll try this again with the sweet potatoes.

This was yummy.  I wanted to make it a little healthier, so I used 6 oz of Greek yogurt instead of the 1/4 of olive oil.  I had quite a few extra vegetables that I needed to use, so I added a leek, a bell pepper, and 1/2 an onion.  I only used the other vegetables I had on hand.  It turned out great.  I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe is incredible! I did a full cup of seasoned breadcrumbs instead of using parmesan cheese to keep this dish dairy free! This is yummy fresh and awesome reheated, too!!!

This was so good! I thought it would be a bit bland but decided to try it anyway.  I made it as listed except I added a dash of Mrs. Dash but I think it would have still been great without.  My husband loved it as well.  Such a great way to get veggies in as. I did add a few carrots and only 1 sweet potato as my son would not have liked the other veggies (but loves carrots).  I used a box of turkey flavored stuffing which is what I assumed was seasoned bread crumbs.

When I started making this I wasn't too sure about it, but it turned out great! I didn't cut everything into cubes, I sliced everything thinnish. Its got a sweet taste to it, I think it needs something to contrast, though I don't really know what. Will be making again.

I loved this!  Left out the mushrooms and potatoes because I didn't have either of those.  Did have sweet potatoes and I used yellow squash too.  Mine was cooked in about 45 minutes.  Really delicious!

This has become a go-to recipe for our family. Nice to find a casserole with no dairy (we omit the parm). Of note, we had a child come over for dinner, I had added some broccoli too, and he said, I don't like sweet potatoes, I don't like broccoli, I don't like zucchini. So I said, well try it and leave what you don't like.
His plate was empty by the end of dinner!

Great but don't put in sweet potatoes, they trump the other flavors.
