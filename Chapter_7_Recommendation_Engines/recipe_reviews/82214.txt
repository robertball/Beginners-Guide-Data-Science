The dish was very good although I thought there were a few too many steps into preparing it and the amount of carrots and zucchini seemed to be alot for 1 lb of pasta.  So instead of boiling 1 pound of carrots and setting them aside I stir-fried 2 zucchini, 1/2lb of carrots and garlic all together then I followed the rest of the recipe and I added a 1/4 cup of cooking wine to give it a boost. It came out very good there were no complaints, not even from my fussy 14 year old that won't eat carrots!

Good dish; makes good leftovers. I undercooked the carrots and zucchini slightly so that they were not mush after being added to the skillet the 2nd time and I'm glad I did so.  Also, I seasoned the chix with lemon pepper before browning. Next time I will add the parmesan to the plate instead of the skillet, because it did not melt into the broth.

Good main dish, with lots of taste.  My only complaint would have to be the sauce.  Firstly, it did not need so much butter (neither did my hips!).  Secondly, I just didn't get the chicken broth as the sauce. The parmesan cheese wasn't enough to thicken the sauce, so I poured about 3/4 of the sauce over the pasta mixture, tossed, and served with a slotted spoon, thereby draining most of the sauce back into the pan, instead of on our plates.  The kids loved it, but I had so much left over "sauce" (broth) that I just tossed (wasted) it.  I added the parmesan, and some extra shredded cheddar-jack to attempt to thicken it.  All in all, it was very tasty, but I need to figure out a healthy way to thicken the sauce, and decrease the butter.

This recipe was really good and healthy. Next time I make it, I'll probably boil the pasta in the chicken broth with garlic instead of using it as a sauce. I did end up wasting a lot of the sauce (I didn't want it too soupy). That's my only suggestion. Overall, very good!!

This was delicious.  I did change a couple of things.  I roasted the zucchini spread with olive oil and garlic in the oven first (the grill would also be great).  In the sauce, I replaced the water with white wine and added a little cornstarch to thicken.  Overall, great flavor but I'm not sure it would have been as flavorful without the wine.

This recipe made SO much food!!!! Way more than expected.    I made some changes... I added onions, browned the chicken by itself with salt, pepper and garlic and then kind of stir fried all the veggies... I didn't use as much of the garlic, probably 8 cloves worth instead of 12.    I used some corn starch to thicken the "sauce" though it didn't thicken much but it's ok since I didn't use as much water, therefore it coated the pasta without leaving a mess at the bottom.    The cheese did not melt into the sauce, it globbed together.  I had to fish it out and then add Parmesan as a topping instead.    I used the full amount of carrots but couldn't even fit the full amount of zucchini in the large, deep skillet I had!  That's a heck of a lot of veggies...  I had to cook things in stages and add it to a humongous bowl afterward, to toss everything together.      Next time I will definitely halve the recipe.    5/6 people in my family liked it.    I served this food with honey-yogurt berry salad and a green salad to make a filling but low fat meal.

Wonderful flavor!  I added corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up.  Less butter can be used in the sauce to make it a bit lighter.  The parmesan cheese might be better sprinkled on top because it didn't completely melt in the sauce and was clumpy.   With these changes, I'll definitely make it again.

This is a good dish.  I did not have parmesan cheese on hand so I used mozzarella instead and it tasted good.

What a great dish! So simple and light and very satisfying! No need to boil the carrots in a seperate pot; soften them in the pan before adding the zucchini and go from there. thank you!

We found the sauce very watery although it tasted good. Try adding something to thicken it up. Also melting cheese into boiling broth seems weird. It might be better just on top.

This was good, but I modified the recipe using reviewers comments. I didn't boil the carrots, I sauteed them with the zucchini and garlic. I also added cornstarch to my sauce, and subbed in white wine in place of the water, so the sauce really clung to the food.

Excellent flavor, though I had to change a few things that did not make sense.  There was way too much liquid so had to boil down the broth and finally the added cheese thickened the sauce.  I also cut in half the amount of pasta as it overwhelmed the veggies.  Great recipe and easy to modify to your taste with the addition or subtraction of other veggies!

I didn't make the sauce because my kids prefer an olive oil sauce ( i know plain). I added frozen peas and a yellow squash. I make this a lot with whatever veggies I have and leftover baked chicken and whatever pasta I have on hand.

Definitely a make again. It's only not 5 star because it didn't have a 'wow' factor. And the sauce needed thickening. I used 1 c broth and thickened with corn starch. I don't know if I used as much garlic because I use jarred/minced garlic. I added 1 tsp. to saute the veggies, 4 tsp to the sauce. And I only had thin spaghetti, so I just cut it up. Not soupy at all with thickened sauce. Thanks for the recipe :)

This was a great recipe. I didn't use quite as much garlic though.  I also substituted the bow ties for Whole wheat pasta to boost the protein. My kids really enjoyed it and had no idea it was good for them!

i liked the end product but think as-is the sauce would have been watery and all that butter was not worth the calories to me.. i cut this down to 2 servings and used a small potato instead of the pasta.. left out the butter and used my own homemade broth, no water.. used 2 packets' worth of bouillon (2 tsp) to compensate for the butter.. i did a quick stir fry first, simmered everything in the sauce, then thickened the sauce with a cornstarch slurry, and sprinkled parm over it (doubt it was the entire amount).. wish i would have had parsley in the fridge as i think it would have added a nice brightness to the dish.. this is exactly what i was looking for.. ty for the recipe

This was a hit at my house, but I made revisions based on other reviews. Boiled a 12-oz box of farfalle, drained & set aside.  Used 3/4 cup white wine and 1 cup water with 1 chicken boullion cube.  Added to the sauteed chicken & allowed it to simmer (covered) for 10 minutes.  Sauteed zucchini chunks, sliced red onion, 1/2-lb boiled baby carrots, 8 oz of quartered mushrooms in butter and garlic.  Scooped chicken out of the juice & added to the cooked vegetables.  Mixed 1 Tspn flour with 1/2 cup sour cream, and blended into boiling chicken liquid, whisking until thickened.  Blended the farfalle into the sauce, then added chicken & vegetables.  Sprinkled with parmesean cheese.  Yum!
