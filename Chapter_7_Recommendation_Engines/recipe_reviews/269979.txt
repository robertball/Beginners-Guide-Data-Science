3.30.19  I just knew this was going to be good, and I wasn't wrong.  By all means, remove the chops from the pot after cooking is complete,  and thicken the juices for an an awesome gravy/sauce.  Apple juice and dry onion soup mix, what's not to like here, just knew it would be outstanding?  I used boneless chops that were about 3/4" thick and threw in a few chunked gold yukon potatoes that cooked up beautifully.  The only deviation from the recipe was that I seared the chops right at the beginning using the Saut√© function for about 2 minutes per side just to get some color (for better eye appeal/presentation) and certainly would do that again.  Very nice, tasty, and very easy dinner.

Chops tasted great, but were a bit tough. I think that may have been my fault, though. Though I did not substitute or leave anything out, I bought bone-in traditional chops one would use for frying instead of boneless. And, I wasn't sure about laying them in apple juice so I put them on a trinket with the juice under the chops. My wife told me if I'd set them in the juice it would have tenderized them. So, next time, I leave out the trinket and use boneless chops. Again, the taste was really, really good!

I made this recipe. I didn't love it. I'm new to the IP community. And, I need to try this one, again. I didn't follow the direction, completely, which changed the outcome. 

The chops were tasty. I will give this one another try.

I made it once, and substituted cranberry juice.  It was great.
The only problem was I cooked it too long and it was a teensie bit dry.  But so good that I am trying again tonight, with cranberry juice, and less time.  This is a great recipe!!  Thanks!

Very Good will make again 
I did change it slightly.  I used a crock pot.  Made 6  chops. Only used 2 Tbsp butter.  At the end I removed the chops and thickened the liquid with some flour.  I then put the chops back for another 20 min.  Served over white rice.  
Delicious

Simple recipe that turned out amazing!  I browned my pork chops on saute mode in instant pot.  As I did not have apple juice on hand I used cranberry juice.  I did everything else according to recipe and it turned out so wonderful!  Took the pork chops out and made a gravy with the juices left behind and served with mashed potatoes and green beans... YUM!

I'm new to Instant Pot cooking and realizing that if you have fatty meat you need to separate the juices at the end of cooking and before making gravy. I poured the liquid into my fat separator and then stirred it back in with cornstarch to thicken it a bit.  I also made my own onion soup mix with recipe below.  Nice taste.

Mine did not make a gravy but the juice was very good.  I substituted cranberry juice since I didn't have apple juice.  I will use cranberry juice again, it is awesome.  I also added big chunks of carrots so I had a veggie, as well.

This was pretty good and a great recipe for anyone just starting to use their instant pot. I think that if i were to try this again I might make the soup mix that way I can control the seasoning. Overall 5 stars for ease of the recipe and 3.5 for taste.
