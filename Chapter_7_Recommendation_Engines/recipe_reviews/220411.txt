This is one of my favorite frostings to use on summer cakes, like Poke Cake. It's easy to make and frosts like a dream. Sometimes, I'll even throw in some food coloring for a colored frosting or a teaspoon of Kool Aid for a slightly flavored frosting.

I don't like icing/frosting, but I can "stand" light, airy versions that aren't too sweet.  Needing to frost cupcakes for guests, we made this recipe as directed, and again with chocolate pudding and a tad of Kahlua.  Yum.  This just became my go to frosting.

Excellent recipe, followed as directed and it was fabulous.  Did add food coloring for my son's bday cupcakes, yellow might not have been to masculine.  Also 1 8 oz tub of whipped topping is 3 cups so no  need to measure.

YUM!  I love this recipe!  Light and creamy whipped frosting.  I add three tablespoons of cocoa powder along with the vanilla pudding step and it tastes like chocolate ice cream!

This recipe is perfection.  It is easy to put together and tastes fantastic.  Love the light, creamy flavor and smooth mousse texture.  I made this using vanilla pudding mix exactly as the original recipe is written.  I then used it with the Heavenly White Cake recipe here topped off with fresh strawberries (dry them after washing).  I used it as a filling between layers of the cake, then frosted the outside of the cake, and piped little flowers all around the strawberries.  I was surprised how nicely the delicate piped flowers turned out.  The frosting holds up well at room temperature.  I decorated the cake and had it on display for 2 and a half hours with no change in it's appearance or texture.  I also piped this frosting on cupcakes for my son's kindergarten birthday party.  The children sucked the frosting right off the cupcakes and they declared it tasted like vanilla ice cream.  It was a hit with everyone!

I was skeptical to try this but it got such great reviews decided to go with it. My biggest concern was how long it would hold up. I made cupcakes for my granddaughters birthday.Seven hours later they still looked great.She only likes whipped cream frosting and she really liked it.I normally don't like whipped cream frosting and I liked it along with everyone else.I did freeze the bowl and whisk first.I whipped it a longer than the recipe called for. I ended up with stiff peaks. after folding in the Cool Whip it got lumpy.turned the mixer back on whipped it about fifteen seconds more. Perfect.I will be using this recipe a lot. I also will be trying other flavors of pudding.Thanks Sweettreats

My husband, all my friends and I all love this frosting.  I use chocolate pudding to add some chocolate flavor.  We all fight over who gets to eat what's left in the bowl, if there is any!

Oh. My. Gosh. This is the best frosting. EVER! I loved it! I made it exactly as written but with a chocolate pudding mix instead of a vanilla for a cake on Mother's day. It's so simple and easy to make and takes no time at all. It is not overly sweet either, just right! I have a chocolate cake in the oven right now for Father's day, and I'm thinking of making it with the white chocolate pudding mix. I'm thinking of all of the wonderful flavors that can be made: lemon pudding for a lemon frosting on a lemon cake, and even pistachio pudding - that would probably go good with a chocolate cake. There's also coconut cream, banana cream, butterscotch, and even in the fall there's pumpkin spice... the possibilities are endless! Thank you so much for this recipe!

I've made this a few of times, one carrot cake with a butterscotch pudding - really great. Made the vanilla version for a white cake with raspberry jam topping cake - the inside frosting filling I mixed with the jam/jelly and fresh raspberries, then the OH SO white frosting with fresh raspberries on top - disappeared QUICKLY (I got an itsty bitsy piece!) UPDATE - this also is EXCELLENT on tiramisu, on final frosting. I found a Hershey white chocolate pudding - amazing flavor. This frosting holds up with a cake to 'take' to a gathering. The tiramisu frosting recipe Tiramisu Layer Cake on this site – that frosting is delicate, not portable. When finishing my written ‘touches’ on adaptations – I’ll add to blog I have on this site if you are interested.

Great recipe for light frosting that pipes well, just make sure it's cold.  I mix the pudding and milk together with a whisk to get the lumps out, then add the whipping cream.  It can be colored too!

Made as directed except substituted heavy cream in lieu of Cool Whip. 2 cups of heavy cream converts to 3 cups whipped.  If using whipping cream, it doubles in volume. Frosting tastes great and held up very well.  This is a keeper for all future frostings.

I'm a fan of reviewing recipes as exactly stated, so I will say that this is an amazing and easy "frosting." I get so tired of making buttercreams because of the overload of sugar and its density. Today was my second time making this and I added orange extract (could also squeeze an orange and grate the peel in too) and it gave it an extra hint of flavor. Yummy!!

Pretty delicious. Except I would beat the whipped cream in with the rest until a cheese cake texture. Folding doesnt exactly work with this very well.made it lumpy.

Excellent!!!  This is my favorite frosting, and there are ohhh so many flavor options.  Example I used another members chocolate cake recipe and turned it into a white chocolate cake, then I used this frosting and instead of vanilla flavored instant pudding I used Pistachio on a white chocolate cake....came out wonderful.  I used the original recipe on a regular chocolate cake for my friends birthday and she loved it....Thank U!

Wow! This recipe was so easy and turned out delicious! It really made a decent amount too! I will be using this for all future "whipped" frosting needs! I plan to also try making it with pumpkin and chocolate pudding for various flavors. :) Perfect! Thanks!!

Finger licking good! Substituted vanilla pudding for cheesecake pudding.    Decided to attempt for non-box cake. Found a recipe for three layer super chocolate Blackout cake, which is waiting to be Assembled.

I just made this yesterday to bring to work today, and it is amazing.  Rave reviews.  I used a box of lemon pudding and omitted the vanilla extract so it wouldn't muddy the flavor.  The texture and the sweetness level is perfect.  I frosted the cake at about 6pm, refrigerated overnight, and it's now been sitting out for about 3 hours with no texture or flavor issues.  Will make again, many times.

This has become everyone's favorite frosting and is requested for every cake now! I've never liked the heavier buttercream, and the versatility of this recipe is great. I can mix in any flavor of pudding to compliment whatever cake I'm making and if you add food coloring to the heavy cream mixture before whipping it's very easy to tint! People can't believe how easy a homemade frosting can be and it's even sturdy enough to stand up to decorations for my Easter Bunny cake!

i'm only giving 4 stars because I made changes to this recipe. I omitted the frozen whipped cream as I didn't think it was necessary. I just used 3 cups heavy whipping cream. I also changed the vanilla pudding to white chocolate pudding as someone suggested. I also added 1/4 powdered sugar for a little sweetness. Overall, this is a great basic recipe.

I love this recipe!  Frosting that isn't  sweet.  The only change I made was less cool whip.  I have also made it with Chocolate pudding mix, chocolate cake, chocolate chips on top and drizzled with chocolate syrup.  A chocoholics dream.  Love it!!

I used this recipe as a frosting for a cheesecake I had made for my niece's birthday. I recommend this to anyone who likes pudding. It has a pudding taste to it. Also, it is great for cake icing and filling, piping borders, writing messages, vines and leaves. I consider this a medium to thin icing consistency. However it is not adviseable to use this icing for piping roses, figure piping and or stringworks. You need a stiffer consistency for that. Overall, it tastes great! My family loves it! I would definitely use this recipe again!

I loved this frosting. I made a chocolate version and added 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder as one of the reviews suggested. I made a 3 layer cake and did not have enough to frost and fill the cake, so I then proceeded to make a whipped cream with 2 cups whipping cream, 2 tablespoons cocoa and 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa to add to the half of the mixture that was left after filling the cake. I liked it much better after adding all of that fresh whipped cream. The recipe itself was great and tasted like chocolate ice cream, but when I make it again, I will def. initially add the 3 full cups of whipping cream, 5 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa and keep the rest of the recipe as is. Thanks so much! I loved it!!!

It was really good. I made a few substitutes and alterations so that might explain the tiny chunks. Other than that, it tasted great. I will defiantly try this recipe again again.

Really good for those who don't like super sweet things! This recipe was perfect for a cake I made my mother and she cannot stand sweet things very much but she loved this!

I messed up this recipe as I didn't whip it enough, so there weren't soft peaks when I used it, it was more liquidy. I'm sure the frosting would've been better if I had done it right. But I frosted over my mistake and the cake turned out to be awesome!

Made this to go on top of the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe from the site. My entire family loved it. Most of us prefer a less sweet frosting & this one pleased all. It's heartier than a plain whipped icing, pipes well, holds up well when cake is set out. This has made it's way to my go to frosting & I can't wait to experiment with pudding flavors.

The flavor is great! The problem is the pudding doesn’t dissolve in the cream and milk so I end up with tiny lumps in the otherwise wonderful frosting. I’ve tried whisking it in before whipping, sifting it in, haven’t been able to figure it out. Others must have a solution because I don’t see anyone else mention this issue. I’d love to know the trick!

I only needed to frost cupcakes (24) so only put in 1 cup of cool whip but everything else the same and still had left over frosting, made it thick but very easy to spread. I love the taste! what a nice easy recipe. With all the new flavors of puddings this is very versatile!

THE ABSOLUTE BEST.... Made for my son's birthday to frost a half yellow, half chocolate cake. Was delicious on both, easy to make. Colored with gel food coloring and held up no problem,  even worked great in decorating bag. Most importantly EVERYONE loved the flavor. New family favorite.

It was okay. I really wanted it to taste more like whipped cream rather than vanilla pudding. Not bad, but not phenomenal

This will be my new go-to recipe for frosting.  So light and good.  I thought I did something wrong because it became very thick as soon as I starting mixing, but was fine after folding in the cool whip.  I used chocolate pudding with 3 T. cocoa powder and it was great.

I followed another users review, sarah, and added 3 tablespoons of unsweetened coco powder along with the pudding mix and it tasted amazing. I didn't have to worry about forming soft mounds either because after just a few mixes it came together alright. Made more than enough for the 2 layer cake I had made. It doesn't freeze, so it can be hard to apply more than 1 generous amount.

I made it exactly as written, it was perfect for my Black Forest cake. Buttercream frosting is too heavy and whipped cream sloughs off the cake. Kids loved it (surprise) as did my husband. I will definitely use again, possibly with chocolate pudding next time.

I made this exactly as written and as I was frosting the cake it turned into liquid and oozed off the cake.  I whipped until peaks.  I even refrigerated for an hour before frosting.  Not sure what I did wrong.  It tasted good though.

I used this recipe for chocolate frosting and used chocolate pudding. It was the perfect texture although I used only 2 cups of cool whip. It needed a bit more of a chocolate flavor. I may try adding some cocoa powder next time.

For the ones who do not like sugary frosting, this is perfect. It's not too sweet, and it is very creamy. I used light cream instead and skipped the milk. I also used white chocolate pudding instead. It came out great.

Very good!  Made this for a kids' party (on chocolate cake), and everyone liked it.  My brother even liked it, and he normally will not eat the frosting.

My husband made this for one of our twins' first birthday cakes.  The cake was red velvet and this went with it perfectly.  He said he added a tiny bit more vanilla to the mix.  Everyone really liked it and the babies did too!  :)
