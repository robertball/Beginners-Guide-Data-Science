I loved this recipe. The last time I made Lebkuchen it was with my German mother. She passed away years ago and I couldn't find her recipe. I searched for one that sounded the same and this was it. When I made it, it was exactly like hers. Even my kids loved it and thought it was her recipe. Thanks so much!!

I loved making these cookies.  My whole kitchen smelled like Christmas.  Very good with a strong cup of coffee.

Having been stationed in Germany many years ago, I fell in love with lebkuchen.  I have tried many recipes over the years and this is one of the better ones.  I did not change a thing and am quite happy with the results.  Thank you for this recipe and a chance at bringing back some very pleasant memories.

I had the ingredients mixed together, but I wasn't able to make it back to baking until 3 days later, after which the cookies were like dense breads with a ginger snap taste. They tasted fine, but not at all the texture of real Lebkuchen (I lived in Germany for 6 years). It could have been the 3 day wait. I am a little skeptical about trying it again. The way mine turned out would be good dunked in tea.
