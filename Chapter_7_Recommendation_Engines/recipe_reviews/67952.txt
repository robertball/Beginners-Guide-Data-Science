EXCELLENT! 
I would have never in my entire life thought that I'd EVER eat a brussels sprout. They're cute to look at, but OMG the stench of cruciferous veggies cooking just makes me gag. Plus I'm not into "mushy middles" (I think reviewers called it "creamy"). But I did want to try this recipe due to all the rave reviews. And now, I want to THANK the person who posted this fabulous recipe! My husband and I LOVED every morsel! I did do 2 changes: 1- we halved them, so that we wouldn't get "mushy middles", lol. And, I read somewhere that if you remove the "choke" that's at the bottom of the sprout (inside), the brussel sprout will not be bitter. Voila! it worked! These yummmy, salty, nutty, crunchy, carmelized brussel sprouts were SO good. No bitterness whatsoever! The super dark carmelized parts of the roasted bsprouts were the best! LUVVVVV this recipe, and will make over and over again! HUGE thanks!!

Yum! This is my favorite way to make brussels sprouts. I first had them prepared this way at a restaurant in downtown NYC around the corner from where I lived--absolutely addictive, and when I moved from that neighborhood I came up with my own version similar to this recipe. The only difference is that I sprinkle a few cloves of minced garlic on top as the sprouts roast, which is delicious--the roasted garlic is sweet and compliments the sprouts without overpowering them. Also, I usually parboil the sprouts first (for 2 minutes).  This draws out bitterness, and cuts down on roasting time (25 minutes to nicely blackened).

I make roasted sprouts frequently, however there is NO WAY this recipe could possibly yield anything other than over cooked sprouts!!!!  Try roasting at 425 for FIFTEEN MINUTES!!!  You'll love them!

I’ve been a member here for years and have never left a review, but this simple recipe has changed that right now.  I’ve roasted cauliflower before ---have been experimenting with roasting veggies lately, but let me tell you this was better than any roasted vegetable I’ve ever had.  It’s so simple too it’s ridiculous!  I bought a bag of fresh Brussels sprouts.  I took off the ends ---small leaves come off when you take off the ends.  ~Word of advice do NOT omit those small leaves . . . they turn into deliciousness in your mouth.  I cut only the big Brussels sprouts in half, but next time ----I will cut them all in half.  I tossed them and the fallen leaves into a bowl with liberal oil, liberal sea salt and fresh cracked pepper and placed the halves face down on my cookie sheet.  As it’s cooking the small leaves will turn dark and roast first ---don’t be alarmed . . . those will be wonderful.  I took them out of the oven when they were done and tasted a small leaf first.  That’s why I’m writing this.  The concept of roasting is so simple, it’s not really a recipe, but the taste that this vegetable yields . . . it’s at the top of the list of any vegetable I’ve ever had.  We’re carb-free/low carb so I served this with a shoulder roast ----one of the best meals hands down since I can remember.  Hope this review has helped someone out there decide to try it.  Remember ---half all of them face down and toss in those fallen leaves . . . you won’t regret it.

I thought these were mediocre...just edible, and certainly not memorable or great. I did not care for the "mushy" or "creamy" interior others found so appealing, nor the overroasted exterior. Also, I don't know how you could roast these as long as the recipe indicates without making them little burnt charcoal briquettes...15-20 minutes was more like it.  I found the look of them unappealing too--much prefer the bright color of simply steamed or sauteed brussels sprouts. Hubby liked them better than I did, tho' he might have just wanted to be nice. (After all, he did leave most of them on his plate) Final word: Always read the lowest rated reviews as well as the highest.

Delicious. We have this once a week. I don't cook it for the full 30 minutes--just long enough for the outer leaves to turn brown/crispy, about 15 minutes. So easy, so delicious. Sometimes I sprinkle balsamic vinegar on top.

I was really really surprise about these, I love brussel sprouts and needed a new way to try them. This was the BOMB!!!!. I followed the recipe with the exception of cook time and temp. Make sure you used the kosher salt no other, I could tell it would  make a difference, also I cooked mine on 375 degrees and for 30 mins until they were dark brown not black, they also reheat very well. Give this one a try. Update!!!! I'm hitting the store tonight for fresh brussels sprouts, This recipe is really ADDICTIVED!!!!. I cook these all the time, this time I decided to use the garlic as others have stated as I really love garlic. Let me say they were still good, but I think much better just following the recipe as stated. I still can't get enough!!!.

I've tried braising; I've tried boiling; I've tried sauteing. Roasting, I know now, is by far the best.  I left it in longer than I felt comfortable as I watched some brussels sprouts turn dark brown and a few turned black. I'm glad I did, as the darker ones turned out better, with a complex outside and a soft, melty interior.  (The lighter ones didn't have as good insides.)  A nice combination of sweet and salty, and an easy recipe too.

These were delicious.  I cut them into quarters because I wanted small bites.  The cooking time was shortened to about 30 minutes because of this.

This is really, really wonderful.  I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  I will make this again and again -- and not just for the holidays!  They really do reheat well, so don't be afraid to prepare them ahead and time and then just reheat them.

Roasting veggies always gives them more flavor -- and you don't have to add tons of herbs and spices to get it.  I skipped mixing everything in the bag.  I just scattered them on a baking sheet, drizzled with oil, sprinkled with S&P and tossed with my hands.  I let mine get good and brown and they were sensational.  P.S.  I wholeheartedly disagree with the people who think that the roasting time is too long (there's at least two on the first page, and it doesn't appear that either one of them even tried it.  They both just say it's impossible).  I roasted my sprouts for about forty minutes and they were not mushy inside, they were not overcooked, and they were certainly not "charcoal briquettes."  The recipe clearly states to reduce your oven temperature to prevent burning.  The point of this recipe is to slow-roast your spouts.  That's where the flavor comes from -- the SLOWroasting.

I am a Personal Chef. I am always looking for simple recipes for vegetables that are tasty and really make the vegetables shine. I made this recipe for my clients. I cut the sprouts in half before roasting. I added 3-4 cloves of minced garlic after the sprouts had been roasted.I made sure that the sprouts were a deep, deep brown, almost black.    My client told me her and her husband polished off this dish in one night. She said she could have eaten it by herself for dinner. They absolutely loved this dish and have ordered more! Well, thank you for this recipe! My clients were well pleased and that is what keeps my business going. Thanks again!

I have NEVER, EVER, EVER, eaten a brussel sprout that I liked.  Sauteed, boiled, herbed and salted up, cheesed up..and YUCK! No thanks.  I thought nothing would change my mind......until NOW!  These were AWESOME!  and creamy yet not mushy. I highly recommend you form your own opion on these.  I was not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised! Oh, I made this recipe exactly as written.  Change nothing!

i was worried to try these since i had to use frozen because my store didnt have any fresh(out of season). i am glad that i did. i bought a 1 lb bag, left them whole, and didn't bother to thaw. i just snipped off the top of the bag, dumped the olive oil and salt in, secured w/ a twist tie, then tossed to coat in the bag they came in. baked for about 25 mins, while shaking every 5 mins or so, and they turned out perfectly. i will definately make these again. next time i will try to get the fresh again to see if there is a huge difference. i served them w/ potato dumplings and pork medallions w/ dijon sauce(both from this site).

I can NOT believe how much I love this recipe. Fantastic. I am not a picky eater, but have never tried brussel sprouts, despite much urging. These were SO tasty. The ones I didn't eat that night I ate cold, right out of the refrigerator. I microwaved them in some water for about 8 minutes, before browning them in the oven. I've been craving them ever since.

I always hated Brussels sprouts, even after I had grown up and learned how to cook all of the strong flavored vegis I disliked as a child, properly. Until that is, I tried oven roasting Brussels sprouts like this! This method yields a wonderful roasty toasty flavored vegetable with great texture! I usually cut them in half before tossing with oil, salt & pepper, and only roast for 20mins, simple and delicious! If you still dislike Brussels sprouts or have kids who do, try this recipe and I can almost guarantee you'll make converts of anyone and everyone who tries them!

This is THE ABSOLUTE BEST way to prepare brussels sprouts!  I used frozen baby sprouts that I steamed in the microwave for 2 minutes first, then sliced in half.  I roasted them in a mixture of olive oil and butter in a cast iron skillet.  No extra spices, just a little salt and pepper - I will never make them any other way.

Wow, I really went wrong with this recipe. I followed the instructions to cook sprouts to the "darkest brown" and found them to be way, way overdone. They were cooking fast, so I turned down the oven temp early on. Still, they were quite well done in less than the time called for in the recipe. Very lightly roasted, they might have been fine. But cooked according to these directions, I found them to be horribly overcooked. They had an intriguing, nutty flavor that might be ok on its own, but was completely overpowering with my menu of salisbury steak and mashed red potatoes. I'll try roasted brussels sprouts again, using exactly the same technique of tossing with salt, pepper, and olive oil -- but I'll forget the instruction to cook til blackened. Instead, I'll lightly roast and and remove from the oven while they still have some green.

I've been roasting my sprouts (and most every other veggie, too!) for years, and even those who say they hate brussels sprouts like them this way.  It's best in my opinion to cut them in half, drizzle the pan with oil, place the sprouts on the pan, then drizzle them with oil, also.  Kosher salt really does work best, and roast them  until you think they look burned on bottom!  Really!  You want them to be a very, very dark brown.  They are so mild and sweet this way.

This recipe taught me a lesson... read the bad reviews as well as the good ones! I made these exactly as directed and what a disappointment! DH and I love brussel sprouts, but these were inedible! They just tasted burnt... there was no sweet taste to them... we'll stick with our other recipes. Sorry :(

This really is the best! I never had brussels sprouts before, but now I can't get enough.  I use sea salt instead of kosher salt, and frozen brussels sprouts, and that works great for me. Easy and delicious.

I just don't get it. I like brussel sprouts and I thought this was horrible. Followed recipe exactly. It tasted and SMELLED like what it was: Burnt Brussel Sprouts! After re-reading the reviews I'm convinced that only those who normally dislike brussel sprouts like this receipe.

Let me start of by saying...I hate brussels sprouts!  I've never liked them, no matter how they were cooked.  My family, on the other hand, loves them.  I'm always looking for new ways to cook them that aren't boring, and decided to try this.  The smell while they were cooking was a little unappealing, to say the least...lol.  When they were finished (and I had to force myself to leave them in the oven while they were getting browner and browner), my hubby talked me into trying a small bite.  WOW!!!  I'm a brussels sprouts convert.  I will eat them made like this any day.  Sorry for the long review, but I was totally shocked at how good these were.  Try them and see for yourself!  *Update* :  Even better with a little garlic powder sprinkled on!

We eat these like candy.  I cut them in half, coat with oil (Wegman's Basting Oil), and toss with Spike seasoning blend.  Delicious!

I will never boil another brussel sprout! Roasting is the only way to go. The first time I made them I had that moment of panic as the smoke started, and I was scared I was burning them to death! But be brave and let them roast away! The black ones are definitely the best. I've tried this method now with other vegetables - asparagus and leeks also come out great. Thank you for passing on such a simple but satisfying recipe!

Surprisingly yummy and addictive!  Unless you have a great kitchen vent fan, be ready to have your house smell like brussel sprouts for quite a while afterward!

Not everyone likes Brussels Sprouts but this way of preparing them just might change their minds. My family really enjoyed them and even went back for seconds. I added fresh Parmesan cheese before serving which gave it an extra nice flavor. I will be making these for Christmas dinner especially for my son-in-law. It's his favorite vegetable.

I have been making this recipe ever since i saw it in Ina Gartner's Barefoot Contessa recipe book.  It is simple, healthy and delicious.  Every time I've served it to guests it becomes the way they prepare brussel sprouts from here on out! The key is to not fear the deep brown color (they're still bright and moist on the inside) and to use lots of olive oil and sea salt.

Super Yum!  My 12 year old daughter told me this is the only way she'll eat brussel sprouts from now on. :)  And everyone's right. The darker the tastier!

The longer you let this marinade, the better it becomes. I put this whole recipe in a gallon size ziploc bag and left it for about 2 hours. It really makes a difference! The second time I made this, I only marinated for about 30 minutes and the sprouts didn't quite have the same salty, crunchy taste to them as the first batch.

These are absolutely delicious! 400 for 15-20 minutes and shake 'em around a bit (depending on preference-dark brown  and crunchy is best for us).  Oil just to coat and give some shine for crisping/roasting, salt and pepper to taste (we like 'em a bit salty).  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THESE!

We grew brussels sprouts in the garden this year, just for Thanksgiving. I've never liked them, but my folks do. My sprouts were on the small side so it only took 30 minutes to be a nice roasty brown. I was totally shocked to discover how sweet and delicious roasted brussels sprouts are! I did not use as much salt as called for (I did use Kosher but not as much) because we need to watch the sodium.

Odd-looking, to be sure, but  really tasty. I had an  mix of sizes, so the  big ones didn't get quite as sweet and tasty, but still very good.

This is a simple and very tasty recipe which succeeds because of the contrasts in textures and flavors.  We loved the contrasts: crunchy, salty outer leaves and creamy, subtley sweet sprouts.  

I used a jelly roll pan (raised edge) and stirred the sprouts with a wooden spoon instead of shaking the pan.  Clean-up was easy.

I will definitely make this again!

I crave these! I made them for Thanksgiving last year and have been making them every few weeks ever since. The first time you make them you will worry that you are burning them, but just have faith because they are supposed to be dark golden brown on the outside and warm and tender on the inside. I use a chunky sea salt and lots of freshly cracked black pepper. Yum! Everyone in my family will eat these, even if they don't typically like brussels sprouts!

These were the bomb! We grew them this year and was tired of steamed with butter. I quartered the largest ones we had to make them cook faster and get more browned areas; tossed with garlic flavored olive oil, Weber seasoned salt and Lawry's seasoned pepper. Spread on foil lined baking sheet - 15 minutes at 400 deg. in the convection oven and they were nicely blackened and tasted out of this world. Even the husband who admitted he isn't that crazy about sprouts LOVED these and wants them again. Wish I had thought to snap a picture before we devoured them!

Brussel sprouts?  YUCK - or so I used to think before making this recipe.  The mere mention of the word Brussels sprouts brought back childhood nightmares of having these at dinner!  Well, if my mom had made them this way I would not have missed on 3 decades of enjoyment!  These are GREAT!  The huba AND all 5 of the kids liked them.  Yeah - a kid approved vegetable!  Imagine!  Dont be afraid to roast them until dark.  That is the best part.  In fact next time I make these I will slice the large ones in half to get move of that roasted flavor in each proportinate bite.  I did add 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp chopped garlic and 3 tbsp Italian salad dressing with a few shakes of crushed red pepper.  Did not change anything else.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe and reintroducing me to sprouts!  Yum!

I put off making this recipe because I couldn't see how it could possibly be better than my normal recipe for brussels sprouts.  Boy, was I wrong.  These smelled so good while cooking that it was all I could do not to open the oven halfway through and devour them all.  But I waited until they were done and it was worth it because they were unbelievably delicious.  They do not resemble in any way the brussels sprouts we all know and hate.  They are crisp and nutty on the outside while the inside just melts away in your mouth.  Crazy but true - these brussels sprouts are better than french fries.

This recipe is so fantastic and simple!  I bought two packages of brussel sprouts from trader joes, cut the grey stems off, halved only the big ones, and threw em in the oven for 35 minutes and they were PERFECT.  The halved brussels were crispy on the cut side, the whole ones were browned on the outside, and the middle was soft but not too soft.  And they're still great as leftovers.  Excellent recipe!

Any recipe that can make me like Brussel Sprouts deserves 5 stars. I used a clay roasting pan and seasoned the sprouts with vegetable oil, sea salt and pepper and kept an eye on them as the oven was very hot. A big hit with the entire family.

Ok I'm still not a big fan of brussels sprouts. This gets 4 stars because I did at least eat them, the household loved them. I did make one change and added  roasted coriander to the short list of ingredients. I loved the bits of really crispy ones.

OMG - why have I not eaten brussel sprouts before?  These were wonderful! We halved all the sprouts after cutting off the ends and added butter and a little lemon for tang.  The "charred" sprouts were so very yummy and tasty. One dinner guest who has been eating sprouts his whole life said these were the best he'd ever eaten! We are so excited to have another veggie in our rotation! To help cut down on smell when cooking, set out 1 cup of fresh white vinegar on counter before putting these in oven.  My mom has done this for years with stinky veggies (cabbage/broccoli, etc). and it really works!

This is the first time I have ever made or eaten brussels sprouts and I was not disappointed!  I left them whole and roasted them for about 35 minutes.  They were pefect!  Crispy on the outside and tender in the middle.  We'll definitely be eating more of these!

Sorry, this one was not for us. The brussel sprouts came out tasting burnt instead of nutty or sweet.

We are needing more strictly vegetable recipes, so I was excited to find this one. I used really fresh, young Brussels sprouts, and made it exactly like the recipe, only adding some crushed garlic on top, as suggested in reviews. I literally set the timer for 7 min, and shook the pan/stirred at that interval. After 4 intervals, I roasted another 4-5 minutes. The sprouts were perfect - some outer leaves were crisp, and there was even browning/blackening. Unlike one reviewer, I found the look very appetizing. And the taste was amazing! I doubt I will ever make Brussels sprouts another way anymore. And yes, I went back and bought more sprouts to do again the next day!!

Not bad.  We enjoyed them, but not as much as some other recipes we've tried from this site. I found them a wee bit salty, but overall the flavor was good.  We are brussel sprout fans.

These were great!  When i told my husband what I was making, he scrunched up his nose and said cautiously..."whhhhy?".  They were SO good.  My husband was amazed how good they were, and was *disappointed* when they were gone.  I can't believe I made Brussels Sprouts, and that they were good!  This is what i did:  I cut off the bottoms little bit, pealed off the top 1-2 leaves, and cut them in half.  Put them in a plastic bag and tossed with olive oil, S&P.  Put into the oven on some parchment paper, and baked for about 20-25 min on 425-450 degrees.  Turn them 2-3 times while baking.  They're done when they started to darken.  Try one and make sure they're tender before taking them out of the oven.

We love roasted vegetables and we love brussel sprouts so we waited with watering mouths after reading all the great reviews.  What a big disppointment, they tasted like burned sprouts, and we didn't even let them get to the black stage.  Back to steaming for us.

They were absolutely delicious Jaq, thank you!  I read many reviews and was afraid they would be burnt on the outside and mushy on the inside. I decided to turn the heat down, then up again and I shouldn't do that. The second time I cooked them I followed the directions, although I didn't cook them as long as suggested because I  prefer firmer vegetables. As it turned out, I loved the slightly charred taste. Mine were not mushy, burnt and most of all, not mediocre. Check some of the photos and see how they all look like they are cooked just a little different, according to everyone's personal taste. I will never cook them any other way, unless it would be to cook them on a hot grill. Yum!

Like others have mentioned, you don't need to roast these near as long as the recipe states.  What I do is cut the sprouts in half, remove the cores/chokes, toss in oil as stated and roast for 10-15 minutes.  At this point you will see the outer leaves starting to brown nicely.  I then use a spoon to smoosh the sprouts which separates them nicely, then go another 10 minutes or so, which allows all of the sprouts to get nicely roasted, not just the outer leaves.  Since there isn't much to this recipe, you can't really mess up any of the details, so I gave it 2 stars.

I LOVE brussell sprouts. this is a wonderful way to make them. But, if you are short on time use all the same ingredients and add sliced shallots. Soften the shallots in oil in skillet on stove top over med. flame. Add in halved brussell sprouts and cover for a few minutes. Add in about 1/4 cup water then cover again for about 2-3 minutes. Remove lid to let any excess moisture evaporate.  PERFECT for when you are in a rush.

I cut the Brussels Sprouts in half to get even flavor on the inside.  We were not impressed but had to try it with all the rave reviews.  Why not just marinade 'cut in half' Brussels Sprouts in Italian dressing then roast to 'lightly' browned?  Am going to try it that way.

I know this doesn't need another raving review, but these were seriously good.  I love cabbage in all forms.  Brussel sprouts not so much....could never get past the bitterness of them.  Now?  Woohoo, these are great and so very easy.  My sprouts were a little large, so I trimmed the bottoms, removed a few outer leaves, and cut them in half.  While roasting, I turned them with tongs a few times.  They were so good!  Hubby liked them, too, so a win-win.  Thanks for this one!!

These were just perfect!  I never would have thought to make them like this.  Simple and so flavorful!  Only thing I changed was putting them on a pizza pan with a lip on it so they wouldn't roll around.  Thanks so much for sharing.
Christmas 2012 update:  I took a chance cutting kitchen time using 3 bags of frozen, thawed brussel sprouts.  Used the same amount of oil, Kosher salt and 1 t. coarse ground pepper.  I put them in a 9x15" casserole dish in a 375 degree oven so I could serve it right from there.  Set the timer for 10 minutes, shaking the pan back and forth 3 times for a total of 30 minutes.  These are just to die for!

My husband loves brussel sprouts and I ...tolerate... them. This recipe is good even to me, and it is a cinch to make. My oven may run a little hot, plus my husband likes them a little crunchy, but the first time I tried this, I thought they were a little overcooked. So, I did not cook them as long as suggested the second time, maybe 20-25 minutes.  I added a tad more salt and pepper than the recipe, and I definitely turned them every five minutes to avoid burning. They were tasty, and tasty is a word I've never used in reference to brussel sprouts before.

Excellent way to prepare fresh brussel sprouts. I've made them this way many times and always find it enjoyable. Try a variation by amply sprinkling thyme or rosemary on the sprouts before roasting.

Who-da thunk it? I haven't eatin a Brussel Sprout in 40 years! Simple, and an outstanding side. I might toy a little with the seasoning next time, but that is not to say that these were any less than excellent. Thanks for this one!

This is the best brussel sprout recipe I have tried. I love the texture, and they are so easy to prepare. I didn't even bother with the plastic bag. I just put the cleaned brussel sprouts in a baking pan, put the oil, salt and pepper on them, tossed them around until they were all coated, and popped them in the oven! They also reheat beautifully in the microwave. Husband loved them too!

These were good ~ not great!  I think I had high expectations from reading the other reviews.  At first they taste like burnt Brussel Sprouts then it kinda grows on you.  Sorry ... but I probably won't make them again.

THANK YOU to JAQATAC!  These were absolutely delicious!  I loved them!!  I followed the directions EXACTLY, to the letter.

Personally, and this is just my opinion and taste, but 400, for 45 minutes is a bit too long.  I like darkened and a little crispy, but for me, it's a little too crispy.  I will definitely be making these again, for sure!  I'll just do it on a little lower temp, maybe 345 for 30 minutes.  Also, cutting a lemon in half and squirting a bit on these, before baking, adds a subtle zesty kick.  A few sprinkles of parmesan cheese, before baking, also adds a nice taste!  Again, GREAT RECIPE!  I loved it and highly recommend it.

This recipe is fantastic.  Simple, easy, non-complicated and it highlights the flavor and texture of really good brussels sprouts.  It doesn't mask their flavor with bacon or other strong flavors.  It's so easy to toss together and pop in the hot oven along with whatever else you're roasting.  Simple and perfect!  

If you don't like brussels sprouts you've probably never had them cooked well and from fresh.  Fresh sprouts, properly trimmed, and cooked like this are a whole different experience than frozen or canned and boiled to smithereens.

Tip:  Do like the directions say and TRIM the woody base off and REMOVE the outer leaves.  Trimming the sprouts really does make a difference!

I never knew brussel sprouts could be so good! And my 4-year-old daughter absolutely loves them.  Never imagined a kid begging for brussel sprouts :-)

This  was the best recipe for cooking Brussels sprouts that I have tried. The only thing I added were whole cloves of garlic. They came out nicely browned like the sprouts.

LOVED IT!!! I will not eat brussels sprouts, but made this for our Christmas dinner as a surprise for my husband. I tried one, just because of the other reviews on here (and they smelled so good). I will be making these again; even I loved them.

Never made brussel sprouts before. This recipe along w/other user reviews was my intro.   Followed recipe but after trimming cut brussel sprouts in half and also added 1 teaspoon garlic powder and some thinly sliced onion.   When finished baking seeing the blackened veggies had me in a panic but they weren't burnt tasting at all just nice and crispy on the outside and nice and tender on the inside. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS this recipe is a keeper. THANK YOU!

These were fantastic. I used a stalk of fresh Brussels sprouts which I estimated to be about 2 lbs. I noticed some bad reviews from cooks that used frozen sprouts, I don't think this recipe is okay for anything but fresh sprouts.  Like others reviewers, I cut the sprouts in half and only roasted about 30 minutes. Not bitter or mushy.

I love cabbage, but never really gave brussel sprouts a fair chance. I made this, and it is my husbands and my new favorite side dish. We are making it for Thanksgiving this year. I use frozen brussels, and I took the advice of others and boiled them for about 5 minutes, and then season them (just in a large bowl, not a resealable bag) and roast them. I haven't gotten a chance to roast them for the full time yet, and I pull them out when my husband gets home so we can eat right away, and he has gotten home earlier than I expected. But I have roasted them for no less than 20 minutes with great results.

These turned out so bad! I think it is because I used frozen brussel sprouts, but the recipe doesn't indicate that fresh ones are necessary. All I know is that these came out horribly salty. Maybe it was because I used frozen and not fresh, I don't know. But I will not be using this recipe again.

Deee-licious! I actually do like Brussels sprouts, but I had them roasted at a fancy restaurant a few months back and they were the best I'd ever had, so I came on here looking for a recipe to duplicate it.  This was it!! I followed recipe exactly is, except I cut them in half.  They were perfect, crunchy, and an amazing sweet/salty taste.  Don't be afraid of the blackened bits...they taste the best!  Thanks for the recipe!

I served this tonight and everyone wanted more.  I cut the sprouts in half, crushed 2 cloves of garlic to mix with the olive oil, salt and pepper.  I cooked at 375 for 30 minutes and they turned out perfectly.  The outside leaves were browned and beautifully carmelized and the inside was soft but not mushy.  My fiance was so disappointed that he couldn't have more, and my picky daughter ate all of hers and loved them as well.  We will definitely be making these again and again.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is a technique I love to do, and is SO YUMMY!  I, however, halve the sprouts, add garlic powder along with salt/pepper, cut back on the oil, and adjust the cook time to 30 minutes at 375 degrees to keep the sprouts from getting too mushy, like other reviewers (I tack on a couple of minutes under the broiler in the end for extra crispies, if needed).  Because of these modifications, I gave it 4 stars...  But it is really a to-die-for way of preparing brussel sprouts (even if you think you don't like them).  Gets rave reviews.

These are amazing. My husband who claimed brussels sprouts were the worst food ever loves them. He asks for them and gets excited about this recipe every time I make it. The kids love it to!! I like to add some chopped onion and roughly chopped fresh garlic to mine.

WOW.  These are great.  I have made them a few times and have served them to confirmed brussel sprout haters and they went back for seconds. The last time I made them I followed the suggestion and used a higher temperture and shorter cooking time.  Thanks for the tip - the house didn't get so smelly.

I loved it, but family didn't care for the soft inside of the brussel sprouts. They commented on the "mushiness" just like some other reviews. I will try one more time and quarter the sprouts to get more surface area to brown. They did love the taste of the outside however.

We've never eaten brussel sprouts before and I was always hesitant b/c I've heard people saying they are not good..but these were AWESOME!!!!!  So easy to make and so delicious....The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is b/c we found the inside to be tasteless...next time I will slice them in half, season and then put them in the oven.  We also tried these on the barbeque and were really good too....

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME...I was out of plastic zipper bags(how did that happen????) so I poured the oil/salt/pepper in the pan and shook it up...worked equally as well. These are the best, I have been craving them for a week since I had them last...this is definately a favorite!!

I thought this was delicious as printed, but my partner did not care for these until I started roasting them in butter.  I make them often because this is an easy and delicious way to prepare brussel sprouts.  I  use frozen sprouts, and they turn out just fine.

Really nice flavour.  I cooked them at 375 for about 25 minutes and they were amazing.  I also added some chopped garlic when I tossed them with the oil and seasoning.  My kids actually fought over who got the last one!

Brussels Sprouts are such a great vegetable and super healthy for you too! I agree that roasted is the best way to go, I have been cooking these for years now.  My changes to them to really have "wow" worthy are as follows.  First, after you trim them slice them in half, they will cook much better this way. Second, swap coarse sea salt for the Kosher salt, I always salt to taste.  I suggest roasting for 30 to 35 min on 375, 400 is a bit high.  Once the Brussels are roasted to your liking, toss them with a bit of masala wine then add a bit of fresh grated good quality white cheddar cheese.  They are phenomenal this way! Oooops, I almost forgot, I also throw in about three garlic cloves for added flavor when roasting.

Amazing for Kids! My son is 9 and made this his "favorite" dish....especially requests it above all others hand down! ....  he even selects the sprouts at the store when shopping with me. 
Not only is it delicious, but SUPER simple to make - and healthy too!

Oh my god. I've never eaten Brussel sprouts in my life, but I bought a bag of frozen Brussel sprouts on a whim just because I saw them. I found this recipe, cut the Brussel sprouts in half, removed the v-shaped "choke" based on the top review, and baked away. Soooooo delicious. Now, I've never had the misfortune of tasting bitter and "yucky" Brussel sprouts before, but I can say that this recipe is simple and yields mouth-watering results. Excited to show this recipe to my parents, because I don't think they've eaten Brussel sprouts either! (Just not something that comes around much in our Indian cuisine, I guess).  Thanks a bunch!

I never write reviews and to be honest until this recipe, I couldn't stand brussel sprouts. I bet I've made this 20 times now and have made others who were like......Um, No Thank You ask for the recipe. Just thinking about them makes me want to make them. Thank You for a awesome recipe

I just made them tonight to accompany my bbq pork t-loin strips and baked potatoes.  I added onions along side the Brussels, which I like to top my baked potato with.  These lil veggies are so caramelized and tasty.  I will definitely make them more often, maybe add some cauli along side. I did cheat a little by adding a couple tablespoons of butter right at the end.  Out of this world deliciousness! Thank you!

YUM !! 

I like traditionally prepared (steamed) Brussels Sprouts after a fashion, but roasted is a whole 'nother story. I made a garlic / EVOO / butter sauce and was in culinary nirvana. I'll never be an herbivore, but this is one of the few veggie dishes which I will choose over meat at intervals.

Absolutely delicious! 

I made them as they were the first time and ended up really, really liking them. The caramelization on the outside made these addictive! The second time around, I did a couple of things differently. I blanched them in hot water before shocking them in ice water. Then I halved them so there's more surface area for them to get more caramelization. Not only til then did I coat them in the olive oil, salt and pepper. I only had to broil them in the oven at 425 F for about 10-12 more mins after that and they were perfect.

Also, while they are delicious as they are, they're also delicious with a drizzling of balsamic reduction. So yummy!

AMAZING!  I have always loved roasted brussel sprouts, but this recipe takes the flavor to a new level.  I did NOT throw away the small leaves, as they were wonderful as they roasted.  I cooked about 2 pounds of these little green balls of heaven, and have already consumed about half of the whole batch as I wrote this.  :)  Enjoy!!!

Oh my!!!  These are fantastic.  I went 30 years without ever trying a Brussel Sprout. Had them at Philly's #1 restaurant Vetri a few months ago and I am ADDICTED! This recipe was so great and SO EASY and fast.  Just tailor the cook time to how well done you like them, I like them burnt!

This is one of my favorite ways to eat Brussel Sprouts. One thing I add to mine is a little parmesan cheese and garlic powder! It is so good even the left overs are good cold right out of the fridge. You'll want to line your pan with foil too for easy clean up.

I've been making this for some time with a few changes. I cut the brussel sprouts in half and add a goodly amount of minced garlic.  I also cut the temp. to 350 degrees and cook for 15-20 min.

I've made Brussels sprouts this way for a couple of years......best discovery ever!  Two things I do differently.  I cut them in half, such that each half has some of the stem end.  This allows more of the surface area to caramelize, which makes them even better!  Adjust the cooking time as needed.  I also skip the step of placing them in a plastic bag.  Instead, I just place them on a big roasting pan, pour on the oil, and toss them right on the pan......works great.

Very good side-dish option. Cut brussek sprouts in half. Trim the ends as much as possible. Add a touch of garlic. They come out caramelized and so tasty! I add bacon bits to them in the end. On my Christmas menu it goes!

I am glad that I tried the recipe as I had never had brussels sprouts before.  The recipe was okay but I found out that I am not a fan of brussel sprouts.  I think others will like the recipe a lot as it had a lot of flavor...just not for me.

The people who like these the most seem to be the ones that don't actually like brussels sprouts.  By the time these finish cooking, they don't even really even RESEMBLE brussels sprouts!  I'll stick to boiling or sauteing - I like my brussels sprouts to be GREEN, not BLACK!

My very very picky husband, who has always hated Brussels sprouts actually LIKED these!  This really is a miracle!  I thought some of them were a bit too dark and tasted kind of burnt, but I want to make this recipe again and see if I can get the timing just right.  I don't think the recipe was at fault.

Wonderful!  I love Brussels Sprouts but usually just steam or boil them.  This recipes is so easy and is really delicious.  I took an earlier reviewer's advice and par-boiled them for a couple of minutes then cut them in half to shorten the roasting time.  Thank you for another great addition to my recipe box!!

The hardest part of this for me was finding Brussels sprouts in our local market. The classic seasoning, the rash of rave reviews in recent days, the natural sweet roast-y yum of veggies, all made this a fun recipe to make. It is by far the most palatable presentation of Brussels sprouts I've ever encountered. I veered slightly from "as written" by halving the sprouts and throwing in some garlic cloves to roast alongside.

Can't believe i forgot to rate this b4! Tried this recipe about 6 months back, and hubby announced he wouldn't have them any other way. The burnt/crispy parts are best- i halve them as well. Fresh or frozen work- in Alaska, we take what we can get ;) All 3 kids looove them and ask for them, so what could be better than that?! Thank you so very much!!

Amazing!... coming from someone who NEVER liked brussels sprouts!  I had to incorporate more veggies into my daily diet and was looking for foods that I could eat an unlimited amount.  Brussels sprouts were one of them, so I gave this recipe a try.  I think the trick is the high oven temp and letting them brown to such a dark color that they almost look burnt.  They turned out so crispy and yummy!  I ended up using McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning instead of the recommended salt and pepper.

Wow...these were awesome.  My six year old was negotiating for the last few.  This was her first time trying brussel sprouts so I did not want to turn her off to them.  I did do a few alterations after reading other reviews.  I parboiled these for a scant 2 minutes (brought a pot of water to boil and cooked for 2 minutes). After draining them I put them in the sealed plastic bag, but I also added 2 crushed garlic.  Unbelievably delicious...try them, you won't regret it!

These were AMAZING!  I double this recipe and I used the same recipe for carrots.  The carrots needed to cook about 10mins longer, but it all turned out just awesome!  I made them for Thanksgiving dinner (for 30) as a non-cheese loaded/non-canned cream soup loaded side.  Everyone was so happy that I made them, and everyone absolutely LOVED it!  Even the picky ones!  Oh yeah, The next day, I ate them cold right out of the fridge, and they were so good, I couldn't stop eating them long enough to warm them up!  :D

This is exactly how I prepare brussells sprouts always.. with one minor exception, I do halve them. Depending on my mood, I'll vary it as the possibilities really are endless. Sometimes add chopped garlic, sometimes bacon & onion, sometimes a splash or two of balsamic vinegar. Perfect!

These were AMAZING!! I cut the sprouts in half before tossing in the bag. I was a little short on time so instead of oven roasting, I decided to pan sear them and WOW I am so glad I did...OUT OF THIS WORLD! They cooked faster, browned beautifully & did not dry out at all. I only wish I had made twice as many.  Will be a weekly event on my stovetop from now on...thanks so much for sharing this gem!

This was outstanding.  I made it with both brussel sprouts and broccoli, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar, and it was delectable.

LOVE THIS!  Who would of thought brussel sprouts could actually be good.  I'm not kidding, I crave this recipe!  I've made it 3 times this past month.  SUPER easy.  I use frozen sprouts- right from the bag- no defrosting.  Bake on 350 for about 45-60 minutes.  You really can't overcook them, but I wouldn't pull them out too early.  It's true the darker they are the better!  Also use Kosher salt- I think it makes it better than reg salt.  TRY THESE!!

I thawed frozen brussels sprouts to make this, and they turned out wonderful.  Definitely my new favorite way to make sprouts. UPDATE: I have made this with both frozen and fresh sprouts, always a hit. Tonight I had a friend over who is on a sodium restricted diet, and so made these with regular Mrs. Dash instead of salt & pepper.  Tasted wonderful!

I had an abundance of frozen packaged brussels sprouts in my freezer, so used them for this recipe.  I didn't thaw the sprouts and simply followed the recipe.  They turned out tender and crispy in all the right places.  Delicious!

This was so easy to throw together and tasted wonderful, with a delicate crispy crust and soft inside. Even my husband, who normally shuns Brussels sprouts liked these.

This is almost exactly how I cook my brussel sprouts, except I also add some dashes of sesame oil.  It gives it a nice nutty taste.  People who normally don't like brussel sprouts just LOVE it after they eat this version.  They nickname it "popcorn  sprouts!"

These are quite good. We are brussell sprout fans at my house, and these were an interesting change from just steaming them. I added cayenne and garlic powder though - I don't eat anything that doesn't haev garlic and a kick. Thanks!

recently i have been reading a lot about nutrition, and to my dismay, i read that brussel sprouts are very good for you, so i decided to buck up, and give them another try, but this time, i would find a recipe for them. 
well, this was it!! the flavour is so mellow, and the salt gives it that great seasoned flavour. they are soft on the inside, crispy and blackened on the outside, and have made me a believer in the brussel sprout for the first time ever! i did add a bit more salt, but that is just a personal choice. thanks for a great recipe. i have eat sprouts on a regular basis now. thanks!!

I had to update my review on this because we have made this quite a bit since the first time (when I didn't make ENOUGH!). We LOVE brussel sprouts this way and make it as often as we can! My husband calls these "popcorn sprouts", because they are so good that you can just sit and eat them like popcorn. Great!

very tastey and I hate brussell sprouts.  I make this at least once a month. I use about half the salt and pepper and instead of oil I use a cooking spray to reduce fat. It works wonderfully and is the perfect combination of salt to veggie ratio.

I made this (using a pint of sprouts) as an experiment before offering to anyone else - and ATE the WHOLE THING myself in one sitting! *grins*  I think I would use less pepper next time as the pepper flavor seemed to permeate the sprouts while the salt pretty much stayed on the outside.  Will definitely make again - and this time I'll share! This is definitely a VERY NICE change of pace.

I used frozen sprouts and I added onion powder to the mix.  These turn out great every time.  The first time my Niece tried them she could not stop sneaking them before the rest of the dinner was done.

I made the recipe exactly as written but for I cut the sprouts in half.  The result was wonderful.   I served them at Sunday dinner  with meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and honey glazed carrots.  I would definitely make again.

I make this exact recipe, however, I cut the Brussels in half before roasting. No need to waste a plastic bag, just use a bowl. 400° is good. Place flat side down on a cookie sheet, parchment is helpful. Once Brussels are deep brown on the bottom, (about 10-12 min) flip them. Roast until soft and brown. (about 10 min) Probably a darker brown then ya might think. Melts in ur mouth. The key is slicing them in half!

I rated this recipe 5 stars because before using this recipe I hated brussels sprouts; and, I loved them after making them with this recipe. The combination of salt, pepper and olive oil combined with the tender crunchiness of the roasted sprouts really works well together! I definitely had to check on them every 5 minutes because the smaller brussels sprouts cooked up faster than the larger ones.

I love these brussel sprouts and I did add a little minced garlic like a few others did...i cut off the very hard tip and halved them and  coating them like the recipe says...I put them in the countertop oven... with in 10-15 min they were toasty brown and delicous... for sure a recipe that you have to keep an eye on to not burn them... but in 10 min you have a wonderful dish...

Oh man, am I glad a friend referred me to this recipe!  I've never liked Brussels sprouts because they always tasted bitter to me.  But after trying them roasted like this, it's my favorite veggie!  We eat them about twice a week now.  Even my pickiest eater requests them.  My only change is that I pull off some of the outer leaves to add to the pan.  Those little leaves get so crunchy, it's like eating deliciously healthy chips!  Love, love, love it!!!  And don't be worried about the oven time--it's perfect--or I might even leave them in a tiny bit longer.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have never been a big brussels sprouts fan, but these are amazing.  I add some minced garlic, and I watch so that they don't get TOO overdone, but they do get dark and deliciously caramelized.  Thank you!

This is an awesome recipe. I made it slightly different but both ways are really good. I added red onion, garlic salt and balsamic vinegar- I'm not sure if that's considered a different recipe? But both ways are delicious - who every said it would just be over cooked mush hasn't tried it. Very good and easy to make.

Very good recipe!  We really like brussel sprouts, but this recipe was even better, because it took out some of the bitterness.  I panicked when they started turning so brown, but should not have.  The browner/blackish they get, the better they are!  Could have used a little more salt and maybe some garlic.  Will definitely make again!

This made me like brussel sprouts... Growing up, my mom would make frozen brussel sprouts and I used to choke them down :) Fresh roasted brussel sprouts are lovely. I also add some balsamic vinegar to them to help further cut the bitter flavor.

I have made these several times and this recipe has turned me from someone who shuddered at the thought of brussel sprouts into someone who actually likes them. I prep these exactly as recipe says then make sure they are in a single layer on cookie sheet. I turn them only once when half the baking time has past.  Delicious.

These were wonderful!! I have always liked brussel sprouts but was looking for a new way to prepare them and this rocks. I live alone and made this thinking I'd have leftovers but that's not going to happen b/c I ate them all in one sitting. Someone else commented that they had to go out for more sprouts to make them again and if it was more than 12° outside here in Wisconsin, I'd do the same. I did slice them in half, as someone else suggested, and had no problem with "mushy" centers. I do think the cooking time was a little long (but sometimes I think my oven cooks a little hot). They were just brown at 30 mins., but pretty black at 45. OK by me; I like a little char, but next time I may only go with 35-40 mins. Thanks to whoever posted this!

OMG, will never put them in water again!  I just took the pan out of the oven, made one pound bag of fresh sprouts, and I ate half of them already!  If you use parchment paper on your pan it's really easy to shake them, and to clean up when finished,  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This recipe is fabulous. I'd never tried using fresh Brussels sprouts before, but I could eat these for a meal. They are great just the way you posted the recipe, don't know why people always have to post what they do different to make it "better"....then it's not your recipe anymore. This is my new favorite veggie.

I have been making these for a long time. My whole family- kids included- devour them. Even friends who don't like them will eat these. First, this is a great recipe to tweak and make your own though you don't have to- we all have our cooking styles. Feel free, to put on more spices, we love seasoned salt and garlic powder. I also roast garlic in with the sprouts. The main thing, I feel it helps for bitterness, blanch your fresh sprouts in whatever broth you prefer, for about 5 minutes before you roast. I have never had a bitter or mushy sprout with this recipe, I bake for about 30 minutes. So easy , good for you and delicious. Don't try this recipe with frozen sprouts unless you decrease the cook time. Frozen sprouts are almost always mushy. Thanks for sharing- we love it!

I had my sprouts in for 30 minutes, rotating every 7 minutes, and they turned out perfect!  Some had dark crispy edges but they weren't burnt at all, just even more flavorful.

May still not be for everyone, but I feel like this is the best way to eat brussel sprouts. Cooking time still may vary. You want to roast them until they almost look burnt and a little crispy on the outside.

Yes, I did, and LOVE it but instead of roasting them whole, I cut them in half because I was running late with dinner.
It was ready in half an hour.
I also added some string beans - ummm, ummm, ummm...tasted like they were coated with sugar. DELICIOUS!

Ha... I did this before I even read this recipe (as an experiment). I roast yukon gold potatoes and baby carrots this same way except adding some fresh rosemary, so you can throw them all in the oven together (be sure to line the baking sheet with tin foil for easy cleanup!) and roast away. Then you have an easy, delicious, filling and healthy side to go with most anything or even alone.

 I give 3 stars because the oven time listed is way too long.

I have never liked Brussels sprouts until I made this recipe.  My husband loved them too.  I used a seasoned salt and garlic pepper. I also followed some other reviewers and baked at 375 for 30 minutes.

My husband and 17 year old don't care for brussels sprouts, so I usually only cook them for myself. I decided to try this recipe and they gobbled them up! A teaspoon of salt sounds like an awful lot to me. Initially I followed the recipe other than the salt. They were delicious. Now I cut mine in half and score the stem end, then mix them with olive oil, garlic powder and onion powder. Once they're on the cookie sheet, I lightly sprinkle them with garlic salt and black pepper. I start with them cut side up, then flip them over halfway through cooking. It takes 20-30 minutes with them cut, depending how big the sprouts are. I love the outer leaves that fall off and get crispy, yum. This recipe is delicious as is, but you can season to your own taste!

Just had this tonight. Normally, I just heat frozen Brussels sprouts in the microwave for a quick side of veg. 
But we were already having leftovers so I decided to make this.
Still used the frozen sprouts (1 lb.), thawed them slightly in the microwave for 3 minutes, sliced them in half, placed them on a baking sheet with a liberal glug of olive oil, salt and pepper, mixed it well with my hands and then placed them all flat side down. Roasted them for 40 minutes, turning about halfway through. They got deeply caramelized, dark brown with some blackening and a very crispy outside with a tender inside, sweet, yet salty
and very moist - almost a creamy texture. . The interest was in the texture ~ both crispy and soft at once. Followed the recipe almost exactly, except for the prep. No need to add anything else but what the recipe calls for. For those who don't like things "well-done", lessen the roasting time or lower the temp. But done as instructed, these were just so delicious! My roommate didn't realize they were Brussels sprouts ~ thought they were potatoes at first. He told me to NEVER make them any other way ever again. Excellent recipe.
Thank you!! *Update ~ had them again tonight....just sooooo good!*

Really nice!  I had 18 brussel sprouts I was given that I needed to use & to tell the truth I was a bit sceptical about whether these would be nice & was doing them for the first time ever with company over.  I actually put these in a re-sealable bag with the oil & salt 24 hours before & left in the fridge in the bag.  I then took them out & roasted them in a oven full of other food on 200C for about 30-35 mins.  I had several guests ask me if a had stir-fried them to make them so nice & they couldn't believe I had roasted them.  They also couldn't believe they only had salt, pepper & oil on them - absolutely yummy!  One of my guests said she has only every tasted nice Brussels sprouts once before, but now this makes it twice.

Roasting Brussels Sprouts is the ideal way to prepare and eat them. Outstanding flavor and texture (unlike boiling) and roasting creates a visually appealing dish as well. Sprouts can be cut in half or roasted with other veggies too.

I love that such a simple recipe could get almost 2,000 reviews.  I can' remember the last time i had Brussels sprouts, although i love most vegetables. Probably goes back many years to a Mom who wasn't much of a cook and probably served them boiled and mushy. I saw them at the store the other day and  wondered why i never buy them. So i did and looked for a way to cook them. These were very good i did cut them in half, and i loved the way the loose leafs browned and got crunchy. Next time i think i will tear off more leafs. Again simple is great.

I made this for the first time. Since I was in a hurry (starving), I didn't read the recipe carefully and cut the brussel sprouts in half and then followed the recipe. I subbed expeller-pressed (takes the coconut flavor out) coconut oil for the olive oil. It was awesome!  Way better than cooking them in water. The centers were as done as the outside. Cutting them in half greatly reduced the cook time. This will become a staple recipe for me. Thanks for providing it!

We love these Brussels sprouts.  Growing up I hated them, I kept hearing people talk about roasted Brussels sprouts, so I tried them. I've been making these for two years!  Always a hit with guests. Better than candy.

I HATE brussels sprouts...have my entire life, until I found this recipe.  I did as another suggested and parboiled them for 2 minutes, shocked in ice water, then halved before tossing.  I did add a touch of garlic powder (was out of raw garlic) and used coarse sea salt and OMG I almost ate the entire pan!  (I only cooked for 25 min since I had done the parboiling)

Absolutely delicious, and I hated brussels sprouts prior to making these. The burnt pieces were the best. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Yes, it is delicious as writtten. However, I brought it to a friend's house and the smell in my car, her house, and my house when I returned home was overwhelming. I don't think I can do that to innocent bystanders again.

Great side dish!  This was so simple to put together, yet tasted so good it even got my husband's approval and his idea of veggies is either corn or peas...  There's something about the roasting process that makes this simple side dish absolutely wonderful.  I opted to use roasted garlic infused olive oil and roasted the brussels sprouts at 425 for approximately 20 minutes.  This is a definite keeper!

These were the best brussel sprouts I've ever had! I halved the sprouts and microwaved for 2-3 minutes, then coated them in the oil+seasoning+garlic powder. Also, I roasted these in 425 degree oven for 15-20 minutes (depends on the amount you cook, you should look inside the oven frequently). I can eat the whole stalk full of these!

Best way to get your green veg EVER. My husband and I already liked brussel sprouts, but I was feeling kinda blah about steaming them every time. This recipe is the way to go - we never have left overs brussel sprouts this way because we keep snacking at them the rest of the night. They are nutty and delicious this way. We usually go for one dish wonders for dinner, but whenever we don't this is our go to side dish.

This is such a simple recipe, but the brussel sprouts were amazing! We loved it. They almost melt in your mouth. You would think they might have a burnt flavour to them, being so dark, but they don't and they were not bitter at all. This is how we will be cooking them from now on. So yummy!

These are not the lunch lady's Brussel Sprouts from school!  Who knew they could be so tastey?  For a nice twist I borrowed from an area restaurant, try adding a few toasted walnut pieces, a little garlic, a touch of orange zest, and some parsely. Yum!

Very salty--I would cut down on the salt but otherwise delicious and easy.  30 minutes was too long for mine so be sure to check and toss to prevent burning.

I thought the amount of salt was too much.  The first time I reduced it to 1/2 and decided they needed more salt so the second time I prepared the sprouts I used 1 tsp. as recommended.  I did add Balsalmic Vinegar for extra taste.  I also cut the core out so they would not have a bitter taste and cut them in half.  I will always prepare and eat Brussel Sprouts this way.  Thank you for the recipe.

I've been told by a chef friend not to season with salt until they're done, that way the salt doesn't pull the moisture out of the sprouts while they're roasting. Other tasty add-ons to this recipe: squeeze fresh lemon juice over them after roasting, drizzle a little balsamic vinegar, sprinkle some fresh parmesan over top. They're delicious with just salt and pepper as well.

Yummy. Haven't had brussels sprouts since I could recall, but my mom says I've had them and liked them so maybe I shouldn't be surprised that I liked these?! Anyway, these are definitely best just out of the oven. They lost some of the nice crispness after being refrigerated, although they were still good as leftovers. I made them in a glass dish so that may have affected the time, but I definitely had to bake more than the 15 minutes that some reviews have suggested. Just pay attention based on your pan/oven!

This is a surprisingly easy and yummy way to make brussels sprouts. Let's be honest people, these still taste like a vegetable, but the simple preparation makes them quite bearable. I cut my brussels in half, because I can't handle an entire mouthful at once, and I thought that helped cut down the cook time. My 4 year old daughter would even eat them, as long as there was sufficient salt on her piece. :)

Thought these were delicious! Added one clove of garlic before roasting them. Cooked for 30 minutes occasionally removing the loose parts of the sprouts if they had fallen off while cooking bc those pieces usually turned black, but still tasty! Will definitely be making these often

I cooked these for 15 minutes at 425 as one reviewer suggested, but I think it would have turned out better cooking them longer!  Very tasty especially the ones that were a little more cooked.  Next time I will follow the authors directions!

Thanks for the recipe JAQATAC

We loved these!  Put them in the oven at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes - until just tender inside.  Honestly, I loved the outside "shell" pieces which fell off of the brussels sprouts - turned out crispy and tasty - may actually peel the layers off next time on a small batch for eating!

I am giving this 5 stars for potential and great "bones"! I was confused by some of the reviews which said they only needed 30 minutes in the oven at a high temperature. Mine were nowhere near brown and crunchy and carmelized, but my extended family loved them! There were only 3 sprouts left in the pan! I am calling this a success and will definitely do this again (although, maybe not on Thanksgiving because the oven is needed for so many other things! My bad!).

Sprouts accumulate a gas and to avoid this remove the  tough outer leaves and aftr trimming stem cut a X about one sixteenth deep on the stem. I have been roasting sprouts for years with many variations, reduce salt and add some curry powder. In some kitchens the sous chef will steam them for about five minutes before roasting.

This is the first time I have ever made or eaten brussel sprouts and I loved this recipe.  Super easy and tasty too.  I really liked the crunchy yet chewy outer leaves.  I will make this again.  My husband (who I'll admit is not a picky eater) had thirds.  My 8 year old son said they were too salty.

I do the same thing, only we place the olive oil, brussells and seasoning in a dutch oven on low and from the frozen bag, they cook up very roasted and rich with no added water. Thanks for sharing!

I have been looking for a good way to prepare brussel sprouts since we get tired of the same veggies over and over again. This was terrific. Next time I will cut them in half to get more crispiness since that is what we like.

Cook until their brown/black. My 8 yr. old grandson came in tried them (gasp from us) and he proceeded to eat the leftovers. He said "Who knew these crispy black leaves would taste so good"
So Easy ! So Good !

I have been making this recipe for years.. my hubby (who used to say he HATED Brussel Sprouts) and two sons love this, as do I!  I also add a splash or two of Lemon Juice....  I can eat these up like they are CANDY!  The brown, carmelized outsides are just fabulous and tasty.  We love these, and how easy it is to make?  It can't be beat....  wonderful dish.

Wow!! These are awesome! I followed the directions exactly the first time. The second time I only used 3/4 t. kosher salt and I think I liked that better. Now I love brussel sprouts!! Definitely cook until brown on outside. Thank you!

Thought these were more tolerable than most. I cut out the sprout like was suggested (I think it made it less bitter) and cut them in half which made them not mushy at all.

I keep hearing that brussels sprouts cooked this way are so wonderful and don't have that yucky brussels sprouts taste, but I found them just passable, in no way marvelous. My kids wouldn't eat them, despite posts claiming that kids like them. My kids are open to such things, by the way, they love lima beans for example.

My family loved these!  I made the mistake of pulling them out of the oven because I thought they were burning.  I'll leave them in longer next time because the brown/black parts are the best!  My husband hates vegetables and he loved these.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe didn't turn me into a fan, unfortunately. I would have given this recipe three stars but my husband raved about them.  He ate the whole lot of them and would have eaten more. He was delighted with them.  I used frozen Brussels Sprouts, sliced in half as some suggested.  Looks like I'll be making these again for my husband. I'll rate again if I change my opinion!

Took these to a work holiday party, mostly bc I wanted to give them another shot.  I'm not a sprouts fan, but maybe I just haven't tried them the right way.  They sure stunk up my house, and they're still not my favorite, but they were better than other times I tried them.  And I didn't bring home any leftovers, so other people must have liked them!

Husband's Birthday Dinner tonight, looking for healthy and unique ideas and came upon this one. SO GLAD!! The roasting brings out the sweetness of the brussel sprouts. He is gonna love them I know, I've been sampling....:) Also added a dash of balsalmic vinegar in the last 15 minutes of cooking, cuz I love the way it adds to the salty/sweetness of this recipe.

Wow!  My new favorite way to make Brussels sprouts, and a lot healthier than the way I usually make them.  The recipe is perfect as is.  Just had to add my comments because our family enjoyed them so much.

I first fried some center-cut thick-sliced bacon and saved the grease to saute' half of a red onion, half of a spanish onion and one shallot just for a few minutes.  I tossed the bacon and onions with the brussel sprouts (I didn't need to add more olive oil) and roasted them.  It was very delicious.  The dark brown pieces of brussel sprout were so tasty.

Just made these. Like other reviewers I cut the sprouts in half. Not sure how many pounds of Brussels sprouts I used but I thought I had prepared too much for the two of us to finish at dinner. Not so. These did not make it to the table. We ate them straight from the pan. Thanks for a great new favorite.

Delicious! I roasted them for 15 minutes at 425 as recommended by another user - perfectly roasted! I used sea salt and added a bit more black pepper to taste. I also cut them in half and flipped them over (instead of shaking them around) twice during roasting (at the five minute and ten minute mark). To top them off I sprinkled sliced almonds over the batch before serving. I had "Almond Accents" roasted garlic caesar flavored almond slices on hand for a salad and they worked  well. I will try plain sliced almonds next time but these were yummy if you want more salt and a bit of garlic flavor.

I could not stop stealing these out of the dish while everything else finished cooking. I made two little changes. I use coconut oil instead of olive in most things as I did in this recipe and I added three cloves of garlic, oh, and I cut them in half. I agree with others that the little blackened leaves are the best part.

these are great! Mine were getting a little to black in the hot oven, so I finished them off on the stove within a lidded pan. I like mine soft but not too black. Yummy.

My husband and I loved these. Made the recipe 'to the letter', but I cut them in half.  The only thing I would add next time is onion and garlic powder to give them even more flavor.

delicious! I'd never had brussel sprouts before. They seem to have a bad rep for being bitter. But these were anything but bitter. They were pleasantly mild and even sweet/creamy in flavor. I made the following changes: quarter/remove the choke, add a sprinkle of garlic powder, par-cooked in the microwave until slightly tender. Then I roasted just to get the color and the carmelization flavor. My husband and I really enjoyed them and will make then again!

these are very tasty little morsels of health, the flavour was great. I did halve some of the larger sprouts so they would cook evenly.  Cook time was fine,  I have a convection oven cooked 25 minutes and shook frequently so they did not burn. I will make these again, with some choped garlic and parmesean cheese sprinkled at the end

This was excellent and simple.  I was surprised that the crispier brussel sprouts were the tastiest.  I put just a little touch of minced garlic in with mine like a few reviews suggested, but I think they would be tasty with or without this addition.

Loved this!  This can be done with any veggie and comes out great.   I have two  adults in my family who HATE and will NOT eat Brussels for ANY reason )   --both tasted these and said that "if i have to eat this--this is the best way to fix them".     So even if you hate Brussels--give this one a try.  Who knows you might change your mind! I added crushed garlic and heated it with oil -so the flavors would mix.  I also used frozen sprouts (can't seem to find fresh).

wow, these were so good!  my husband and i loved them.  i usually just pan fry brussel spouts (after cutting in half and blanching for a min in the microwave) to get them a little cruchy, but wow, roasted in the oven is now going to be the way i do it.  Especially now that summer is coming to an end and i can stand to have my oven on!  i did turn up the temp a little to speed it up. also the little leaves that fell off and got brown and crispy were like little chips... i'd like to try making a whole batch of just the chips sometime, they were so good!

Recipe is delicious as written!  I used coarse sea salt and olive oil infused with garlic flavor and the brussel sprouts came out very flavorful.  I roasted for 30 mins, shaking the pan every so often (no regularity), and they turned out just browned.

I also find these addictive, I could eat them every week. And if you melt 1/4 c. butter and squeeze a half lemon in it and pour on right before you serve they are even better! For less calories just the lemon.

Amazing! I used garlic salt and olive oil, roasted them in our countertop oven and voila! When I took them out, I sprinkled a bit of Parmesan Cheese. The olive oil helped the cheese stick to the sprouts creating this delicious, decadent coating on them. That complemented with the crunchiness and sweetness of the sprouts made for an awesome dish.  I had it twice this week and just thinking about it them is making me hungry for more!

Delicious! It took an hour of cooking to get them to be even a little brown, so I'm not sure why other reviewers thought 30-45 minutes was too long. I guess you just have to keep an eye on them and figure out the correct amount of time for your oven. Perhaps mine had trouble browning because I par-boiled them for several minutes first, as another reviewer recommended for getting rid of the bitter taste. Next time, I will not par-boil.

I never liked brussels sprouts till a friend recommended I tried roasting them and now I'm in love.  I pretty much follow this recipe and they are incredible with a delicious nutty flavor.  Sometimes I cut them in half to add a crispy crunch to them.  So good!

So simple - so delicious!  I couldn't get enough of these!  Even my DH liked them, and trust me - that's astonishing!  I cut the sprounts in half and roasted for 20 minutes at 375 (which was perfect).  Everything else was "as is".  Will be making this a lot!

Oh yeah - this is the best... even for B.S. haters. Instead of putting them in an oven, I just sauté them until the halved side is golden brown. Flip them and brown the just a little on the other side. Take them off the burner, add salt and pepper... DONE! Try using a little lemon juice or balsamic vinegar... wowie!!

I LOVE roasted vegetables!  I've been making them for a long time.  In a big bowl I put in chunk cut potatoes, carrots, brussel sprouts (bigger ones cut in half), sweet potatoes or winter squash, fresh small onions (bigger than pearl, smaller than a small regular onion), and I mix it all up with a good drizzling of olive oil and spices (any kind you like, one of my fav's is rosemary and garlic).  I preheat the oven with my ungreased cookie sheet in it, then when the oven is ready, I pour the veggies on the hot sheet and they sizzle, I roast for about 25 minutes, THEN stir (too soon and you'll lose a lot of the browning edges, they'll stick to the pan and the veggies will fall apart when mixing up), once they are set enough, I mix them up and cook another 20-25 mins.  These are a HUGE hit no matter where I take them.  Remember, if you add celery or any tender veggie, put them in about 1/2 way through the cooking process so they aren't over done.  I always cook 2 cookie sheets full, they are great as leftovers to use as a side dish in a second meal later in the week.  And I always chunk cut my veggies, not tiny pieces.  YUM-MEE :o)

these are the best I have ever had. When boiled they tend to be bitter, but roasting them really brings out the yummy flavors. Thank you for a great recipe.

I've been making my brussel sprouts like this for a while now (since my cousin told me).  I cut up asparagus and mix in with the bs's.  Any kind of coursely ground salt works especially well.  I give them a stir from time to time.  If the sprouts are big cut them in half.  I agree with the reviewer who says they pick them out of the pan before they even get to the table.  They are amazing!
Just wanted to say something of an update.  Add a little brown sugar and balsamic glaze.  Excellent.

This is basically Martha Stewart's recipe I have been making for years.  As it can take some time to get them carmelized in the oven, I sometimes steam them first in the microwave in a little water just until they are fork tender and then follow the recipe.  My family loves them and they are a holiday favorite at my house.

I love this recipe, I make it all the time, however, I generally staem the brussels a little before I bake them, just to make them a bit softer, especially if my grandmother is coming over, and I top them with parmesan cheese before baking too.

These are good. I like the simple seasoning on them. I added some baby squash for the last 15 minutes. My sprouts could have used a little more time, but I got impatient and the rest of our dinner was ready - will cook about 10 minutes longer next time. Thanks!

This turned out really really good. I used a salt substitute to lower the sodium content. I finished them with a light thai dressing! mmmm Definitely need to parboil them before hand to soften them up.

Oh my gosh! I have roasted just about every other vegetable out there, but have never tried roasting brussels sprouts. I don't know why, since they are one of my favorites. These were excellent! Like another reviewer, I added some minced garlic and I roasted at 375 degrees for about 30mins - just til nicely browned - not black. I love the way the outer leaves get crispy. It's almost like eating candy, but with a little salty bite to it. My mother and husband, who don't love brussels like I do, raved about these. My husband was even sharing this recipe with the guys he works with in a millwork shop! Thank you for sharing your simple yet delicious recipe, JAQATAC.

People who say they hate brussels sprouts have probably only had them boiled or drenched in some kind of sauce, but for these little guys, the less you do to them the better! I have been sautee-ing b.s.'s for years, but I thought I'd give roasting a try. I followed the recipe, except I like to cut them in half and notch out the tough, cone shaped pithy center with a sharp knife. This makes them bite-sized and reduces cooking time to about 22-25 minutes. Yum!

I also sprinkle balsamic vinegar on top too! Yum!
Last time I made these, I added peeled cloves of Elephant Garlic to the mix....oh my! Great!

My family LOVED this dish.  People, I don't think you understand how BIG this is--my KIDS ate it and asked me to make it again!  This is huge!  So simple, so good, so healthy.  This will be a regular in our house in the future.  Who knew, brussels sprouts every week instead of once a year.

We love veggies in this house.  DO NOT FOLLOW THE COOKING INSTRUCTIONS.  Most people halved them or precooked them or turned the oven temp down.  I didn't and was left with Brussels sprouts that were charred on the outside and pretty raw on the inside.  I used baby-sized sprouts so I didn't think they would need to be halved.  Wrong.  I'm so disappointed because I love roasted Brussels sprouts but this just did not work for me.  :(

Since I'm in my 30s,  I decided to take it upon myself to try brussels sprouts for the first time. I used fresh ones. I added one large, thinly-sliced garlic clove to this recipe, keeping the sprouts on top of the garlic while roasting so the garlic wouldn't burn. Slightly bitter taste on the outside may be due to the garlic, but I can't be sure, since I never tasted them before! Left them in for 45 minutes. Had it for a simple lunch, with pasta sprinkled with Parmesan. Pretty good... good enough to give them another go.

Yum...a very good alternative to just steaming them.  I did not use fresh brussel sprouts (they were too pricey in the store), I just used frozen, and they came out fine.  I also was out of olive oil and used regular vegetable oil.  My daughter and I enjoyed them very much!  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely FANTABULOUS! I made these for Thanksgiving dinner and they were a huge hit. We made 2 lbs. and the sprouts were gone by the end of dinner - with only four of us!

The only change we made was to add about 2 tbs. of roasted garlic. I also let the sprouts 'marinade' in the bag for awhile.

These were excellent when brown and crispy, but next time I'm going to try taking them out sooner for a different texture.

The best! Try it, you'll love these...

Purty darn good.  Even the "boys" that don't like brussel sprouts wanted more.  We skipped the plastic bag part and just seasoned and rolled them around in the roasting pan, using hands to toss and coat if needed.  Works with either fresh or frozen.  We cut the larger ones in half the first time, 2nd time we cut all of them in half as my friend likes to dip hers in melted butter and when they're cut in half they grab a bit more butter.  SHE is not worried about cholesterol, obviously!  We make this all the time now.

Excellent flavor! The smell isnt so good.. but the outcoem is wonderful.
My husband always requests theese.
A great high fiber food for those who watch our waist lines!
hint: sprinkle a little lemon zest on them before roasting... gives them a fresh new taste. Or add a pinch of garlic to them.

I am one of those people who don't generally like brussels sprouts, but I had half a box in the freezer to use up. I nuked them for 1 minute, ran them under cold water, patted them dry, and followed the recipe exactly (for the amount of sprouts I had). They turned out great!

Yum, yum, yum!!! I cooked them at 450 (misread it!) and they turned out fabulous.  Brown and a little crunchy on the outside and creamy and tender on the inside.  I also threw in some radishes, too.  They came out nice and soft - almost like a turnip.

I loved putting the oil, salt, and pepper on the brussels sprouts before.  I did not cook these for 45 minutes.  I waited until they looked crispy at the edges and it was perfect!

Very good!  This is now my go-to way of preparing brussel sprouts.  I cook on 400 and shake the pan every 5 minutes.  Mine take 30 minutes to cook.

This has become my best side dish.  Even my wife, who is my strongest critic actually said that this was her favorite.  I followed the recipe with no changes.

Oven roasting is the best way to cook sprouts, IMO. I cut all of them in half and placed them on a cookie sheet cut side down.  Towards the end I sprinkled with garlic powder, and added crumbled bacon.

Super Delicious.  I  halved the brussels sprouts and cooked them at 375 for about 25 minutes.  I turned them up to 425 for the last 5 minutes or so.

Who knew brussels sprouts could taste so good? I am 52 and had NEVER touched a brussels sprout until a friend talked me into trying some "roasted" ones from a food truck here in Austin a few years back, and I could not believe they were the same veggie that our sitter had boiled and fed to my unsuspecting toddler sons 20 years ago. Just walking into her house and smelling the stank of boiling brussels sprouts was enough for me to write them off of my veggie list for good. But, call me older and wiser, they are now a frequent go-to, as I try to improve my eating habits and lower my risk of cancer as I age. These make a PERFECT side dish to evening protein. If you've never tried them (like me), give this recipe a try. And then, if you've never had asparagus (that you liked), try the similar recipe where you oil, salt, and pepper it and then put shaved parmesan cheese over it before baking and you'll have TWO awesome, healthy, delicious veggie sides to serve!

I'm not much for Brussel sprouts, but in an attempt to be healthier I bought a bag on a whim.  These were surprisingly good! I baked mine for even longer than stated, and hubby commented on the tiny little leaves that fell off while turning on the pan that they tasted like sprout chips.  yum!

I really liked this simple recipe.  I have never been a fan of brussel sprouts, but I bought them because my fiance is a huge fan and I decided to see if I could warm up to them.  I roasted them until they were blackened on the outside, and they were perfect.  I will definitely eat them again if I make them this way.

I did 30 minutes at 400 -- after tasting, I probably could have let it go another 5-10 minutes.  Very, very good flavor... I could pop them like candy.  Would love to try something that brings a different flavor accent to the party, but salt and pepper and the pure taste of the sprouts is good too!

These turned out great! No charcoal briquettes here. I just checked them every 5-7 minutes and took them out when they were dark brown. Everyone in the family loved them including my picky 7-year-old!

OMG excellent!!!!  I made these with frozen baby brussel sprouts and they turned out fantastic.  After partially thawing in the microwave I followed the recipe.  The only suggestion would be to cut down on the salt a bit.  Other than that, they were great.  I let them rest for 5 or so minutes while I finished the rest of dinner prep.  They had a slight salty crust to them; held their shape & didn't turn to mush but were very tender.  Highly recommend this recipe, definitely a keeper.

When I think of Brussels Sprout I remember the stringy thin veggie I disliked when I was younger.  Then I was at a local venue called Hyde, in Hollywood, and they had these Brussels sprouts on the menu and I laughed... the waitress was saying they were amazing so I tried them, and when they arrived I was shocked to see they were not at all like I remembered.  They were delicious!  Since I already had an All Recipes profile, I knew what my next recipe search would be... Brussels Sprouts, of course!  I found this recipe and decided to get creative with it and here is what I did.  Bought an Organic 3 lb box of Brussels Sprouts from Whole Foods, same measure of salt (kept smaller amount for low sodium), pepper (did not increase amount due to jalapeno and garlic being added), Organic Olive Oil (increased amount to 6 table spoons with larger serving), diced up half a jalapeno and 2 cloves of garlic and mixed them all up in the plastic zip lock bag, let it sit in bag for 10 mins and then placed them on the tin foil lined baking pan.  Had the oven preheated to 400 degrees F (204 C).  Every 5 mins I turned them just like this recipe calls for but learned that 15 minutes, I reduced heat to 325 as they were already brown.  Cooked them for another 10 minutes turning them every 5 minutes and OMG, they are INCREDIBLE!  Not too spicy or garlicky... just the right amount of zing, better than the ones I had at Hyde in Hollywood, probably because I made them with extra Love and Care!  Enjoy!

I liked the idea of shaking it up in a bag but besides salt and olive oil, I added garlic, red pepper flakes, and lemon pepper seasoning. I cooked it according to the directions. It took about 30 min with shaking the pan every 5 min. Turned out really good! Really nice flavor

I made this for the first time last weekend. I've made it two more times since then, it's that good! I halved the sprouts which helped some of the outer leaves come off in the roasting process, and cooked them at 400 for about 40 or 45 minutes, stirring every eight minutes or so. You definitely want some of the loose outer leaves in there because those are the best part! You want them dark and crunchy, they will look burned but they are so good. I added garlic once and it was good but not necessary.

OMG!  Made these for supper tonight and they were just amazing!  I followed the recipe as written except I cut each brussel sprout in half which cuts down on the roasting time.  I roasted them for about 25-30 minutes.

Excellent - but cook less @ 400 (35 minutes max).  Otherwise, reduce heat.  Add more olive oil to keep moist, stir frequently (especially when you smell burnt!), and add garlic powder in addition to the S&P first.  Enjoy!

What kid likes brussel sprouts? Mine, apparently. These have to be pretty amazing if my kids request them weekly for dinner! This recipe is now my "go to" method for preparing Brussel Sprouts. Thank you so much for sharing!

Roasted Brussels Sprouts are amazingly delicious. For ease of preparation, I dump all the ingredients onto a baking sheet and toss to coat. Shaking the pan every few minutes is essential for even browning. YUM, right out of the oven.

This is a great recipe!  I had never served brussels sprouts until I tried these and now they are a tradition in our family for every party, especially Thanksgiving and St. Patrick's Day.  Time needed for cooking depends on the size of the brussels sprouts.  I always cut mine in half so the outer leaves are crusty (like potato chips!) and the insides are so deliciously soft. I sometimes use garlis salt. We serve them as an appetizer.

OH. MY. WORD. I would have never in my wildest dreams thought we'd like brussel sprouts and even my husband who has been Mr. Peas & Corn loved them. I will definately making these again. Great low carb side dish. I had half of them gone before my steak was off the grill!

I love Brussels sprouts to begin with but these are to die for!
The way they caramelize is absolutely scrumptious!

Tried it today for lunch. Wow it was great! I don't use olive oil so used coconut oil. Followed the rest of the recipe just like it was listed.  Next time I probably will cut them in half so I can have more of the great flavor! Going to stock up when their on sale and make big batches and freeze!

If you're going to make Brussels sprouts, this is the way to do it!  The easier way to go, is to get a deep casserole dish, forget the plastic bag, just put in the oil and Brussels sprouts and stir well, adding the salt and pepper after they are well coated.  Then, every 10 minutes or so, stir them again.  A little trick I learned, when they are done, turn the oven off and leave them sit in there until they cool down a little, if you have the time.  This will give them a nice brown color all over, and a really delicious flavor!

I thought they were good, but my teenage boys and husband thought the boiling method we usually do is still better. Worth a try b/c they were good to me, but not really any better than boiling.

Delicious!  My family loved these!  I followed the recipe and roasted them and they came out perfect.  I had to roast them for about 45 minutes to get them to the soft tendency I wanted.  Will def. make again and again.

I had never tried Brussels Sprouts before but now I'm a fan! And so is my husband who is not a veggie person! Skipped the whole bag process and just cut them in half and mixed them in a bowl, added pieces of garlic, onion and spices as recommended by other reviewers and roasted them for 30 minutes while covered with foil. A better alternative to chips and "you can't eat just one"

Up until now, the only Brussels sprouts I have had had been my mom's as a kid. Thanks to that, I happily went 20+ years avoiding them. Then my nutritionist told me to have more vegetables from the cabbage family after I did some blood work. Saw this recipe and thought what the heck. Glad I did! Perfect as is or you can play with different seasonings. I do the 45 minutes with the 7 minute shake. Don't several times and always worked out great.

I love brussel sprouts, so I enjoyed making these. I added some garlic and cooked for about 20 minutes per one review. They needed more time in the oven, but I plan on making them again.

These are sooo yummy. I put foil over them for the first 20 minutes and then tossed them around a few times while the foil was off. I love browned outer layers. Why did " the most helpful critical review not even make the sprouts? I can't stand that.

These were amazing. I finally got my husband to try Brussels sprouts, and he was not disappointed! As written, the cook time is far too long. I took other reviewer's suggestions - I cut them in half and baked at 425 degrees for 8 minutes. Then I flipped them and cooked at 400 degrees for another 8 minutes. They were perfectly done. The crispy brown-black outsides definitely made this dish! We will make this over and over again.

I made these for dinner and my husband was in love! I really liked them too. I do fresh broccoli the same way. Delish!

Loved these! And believe it or not, so did the kids. This is saying a LOT, because my son does not eat anything green. I served this with steak and pineapple, and these were the very first thing he ate. I did half them prior to roasting and added a small amount of garlic. I almost wish I had left them in a little longer (I took them out after about 20-25 minutes) because the ones that were darker were so much better and melty and sweet!

This is a simple and tasty side dish. I halved the sprouts and cooked at 400 for 40 minutes and they turned out perfect.

I make these pretty much the same way, but I add minced garlic and (if I have it on hand) chopped bacon as well. I usually roast them on 500 for about ten minutes in the beginning, then reduce the heat to 400. I also cover the sprouts with tin foil, take them out and shake them around every ten minutes or so, and in the last ten minutes of cooking will remove the tin foil top to let them brown a bit more. I'd give five stars if I didn't make some minor additions/adjustments to the existing recipe.

These are really yummy, with a couple of changes!  First, we halve ours, because we don't care for mushy centers.  Second, we only roast in the oven for 15-20 minutes.

My boyfriend loved these! I liked them too, but didn't get to eat many cause he ate almost all of them. I added some minced garlic that I had on hand,if you do that make sure to add after sprouts have been cooking awhile, so you dont burn the garlic. I didn't know and it burned it up. Still tasty though!

Even my brussel sprout hating husband loved this recipe!  I've put the sprouts in a foil packet and then cook them on our grill, turning occasionally. I've also started with frozen brussel sprouts, too, just cooking them longer, depending on what else is cooking on the grill.

Smoky flavoring was excellent.  Loved this recipe, and you have to stay on top of shaking the pan every 5 minutes so they cook evenly.  The only change I did was adding garlic and I will definitely be making this again!

My husband loves Brussel Sprouts, so I thought I would try roasting them ( we love roasted Asparagus ).  I read alot of the reviews and set my oven at 425 and roasted for 20 mins.  I did cut my Sprouts in half and added some minced garlic.  I thought they were alittle dry..and both hubby and I agree that adding some crumbled bacon would be a good add.  I'll try this recipe again, with a few of my own personal tweeks.

So I tried this recipe due to there having 1,500 reviews and 4 1/2 stars, but I was VERY disappointed.. What a waste of brussel sprouts. Please don't make the same mistake I did. I even added garlic because a lot of people said it was good to add garlic. I'll stick to boiling or steaming!

I have never liked brussels sprouts and don't eat them. I read how good they are for you and tried this recipe. Absolutely fabulous. I only has sea salt but they turned out fantastic. I cust the larger ones in half and didn't add the fallen leaves which I regret because the little well done leaves where VERY tasty. I will be making this on a regular basis. Thank you!!!

Very good.  Even got my husband to eat a couple.  I didn't want to heat the house up though so I started them in the microwave and then put under the broiler.  Could also use a grill basket for outdoors.  Also, I nixed the salt and added onion powder, garlic powder, and a few shakes of parmesan cheese.

I cut them in half and still had a mushy center with a crispy, burnt outside.  The brussel sprout taste was thankfully overwhelmed by the burnt taste, but I would be embarrassed to make these for anyone other than my husband.  They look and taste unappetizing.

Very easy to make and perfect!   I fried  peppered bacon and mushrooms, added the sprouts for about 5 minutes then threw the whole thing in the over for 20 minutes.  

Yummy.  Reheats very well.

When I followed the original recipe cooking time they were totally burnt through and through.  Decided to try again by cutting them in half and then cooking for 20 minutes (start checking at 15).
  
With changes in cooking time they were delicious!

Holy cow.  I was skeptical, as the recipe seemed too easy.  But, hey, don't mess with a good thing!  These are outstanding.  My Brussels sprouts were huge, so I halved them.  I cooked them at 400 for about 15 minutes, then another 10 minutes at 375.  Delish.  Yum.  Now I just need to get more Brussels sprouts...

Only giving 4 stars because I'd found a similar recipe a few years ago, only it called for red grapes (halved) and fresh thyme in addition to OO and S+P. I liked the added flavors, even had a few people eating them that otherwise would not!

i actually created an account just to comment on how awesome these were. i have never had brussel sprouts before, but i kept picking them off the pan when i went to shake them, eating the fallen leaves. even my incredibly picky 5 year old liked the crunchy darkest parts. i do suggest cutting in half. We thought they tasted similar to french fried onions. wonderful! try it

These thangs are nummy in my tummy. I'd never thought of mixing them in a Ziploc bag. You could also add half as much garlic as you do black pepper. So, if it's 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, then add 1/4 teaspoon of garlic. Most yummy. Pretty much any word ending in 'ummy' can be used to describe this. Except gummy. Or bummy. Or mummy. You know what, only nummy, tummy, and yummy.

Really good!  We debated 4 vs 5 stars.

There's a lot of discussion in these reviews about how long to roast.  If you follow the recipe timing, you'll end up with really dark, delicious sprouts, practically black.  If you want green sprouts, like what's shown in the picture above, you'll need to roast less time (and what's the point of that??).

First time I've ever eaten brussels sprouts! A friend recommended this method and they were good, but I think for my taste they needed more. I didn't get the sweeetness out of them. I would eat them again if served this way though!

Easy, easy, easy! The brussel sprouts cooked a little faster than 45 minutes. I was done about 20-25 minutes.
We've never liked brussel sprouts, but now we've roasted them this a several times and even picky hubby gives it the thumbs up.
Now I have a new veggie to put in the rotation.

I'm rating these for my hubby.  He loved these.  I do think that the next time I do these for him that I will just put what he will eat in a small bowl and toss them with the oil, salt, and pepper.  So much got lost in the bag it seemed like a waste.  But whatever keeps him happy I'm willing to make!  Thanks for this method of cooking.  I use those same ingredients on many things I make!

Excellent!  I quarter the brussel sprouts and did the rest exactly as the recipe instructs.  They were fabulous and yes, the crispy leaves were the best!  One of our new favorites!!!

Crazy.  This is now one of my favorite recipes.  I look forward to leaving the office and roasting brussel sprouts soon as I get home.  What happened to me?  Ben and Jerry's used to come to mind...now brussel sprouts? Go figure. This recipe literally makes veggies into candy.

I've never had brussell sprouts because as a kid I was told it tasted horrible.  I finally decided to try this recipe and I was truly and pleasantly surprised.  They were so delicious!  I added minced garlic as suggested by other reviewers.  They don't look very pretty because I roasted them until they turned black but don't let that fool you.  I loved it!  Very easy recipe and a keeper :-)

easy to do and who knew roasted brussels sprouts would be so yummy! Next time will add fresh garlic and maybe a mixture of real butter and olive oil.

I'm pretty sure I would have eaten this even as a kid if I had known about it sooner!  

One quick change.  I substituted a tablespoon of butter for the 3rd tablespoon of olive oil.  I love butter!  Also the fact that my girlfriend and I are garlic lovers, we added a tablespoon of fresh minced garlic cloves. Its AMAZING!

So delicious!  I have been preparing brussel sprouts for years all wrong until I found this wonderful recipe.  Baking them instead of boiling will bring out its rich flavour.  I had the leftovers cold the next day and they were still very good.

I took this to a church pot luck, it was the first dish to run out.  I added a little extra olive oil (1 tbsp) and I cut the brussell sprouts in half lengthwise(goes further).  I just emailed my friend from church this recipe she asked for! What a great way to get your veggies!

Delicious and SUPER easy! I've had my eye on this recipe for some time. I can't BELIEVE I waited so long to try it!!! Being that I am the only one who likes brussel sprouts in my family, I made these for myself. All I can say is WOW! Other than scaling everything slightly (my grocer doesn't sell brussel sprouts in bulk so I had to purchase a 1 lb. bag of them) and adding a little more EVOO / seasoning than called for, I made no changes. I used my stoneware jellyroll pan to roast everything in and think this worked very well (there was plenty of room to flip my brussel sprouts for even browning). It took 28 minutes (i.e. 4 intervals of 7 minutes) for my sprouts to cook to a beautiful, golden brown color. They were slightly sweet, a bit soft (but not mushy) and perfectly roasted! Not wanting to waste the leaves, I roasted them as well, and while they were not bad, I could do without them next time. NOTE: Be sure to cut off the stem end of your sprouts and remove the outer, yellow leaves (both impart bitterness). I also find that cutting the larger sprouts in half ensures even cooking... otherwise, your small ones will overcook while your larger ones will be just right. :) Thanks for sharing, JAQATAC. These were the BOMB! :-)

This recipe was a big hit with my wife who "doesn't like Brussels sprouts."   On my second attempt, I cut back on the salt a little, which I liked better.

TIP:  Buy your sprouts still on the stalk if at all possible.  I'm not a "fresh freak" about everything, but I've found there is a big difference with sprouts.  They are not easy to find on the stalk, but if you have a Trader Joe's in your area, they often carry them in that form.  "Fresh" but not still on the stalk, they aren't as sweet and a little bitter.  Frozen, forget about it, you'll have a soggy mess.

I did slice sprouts in half but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and these were absolutely delicious! My family likes brussels sprouts anyway, but this was a pleasant change from the typical way we serve brussels sprouts.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This is a really good base recipe (with turning the heat down to 375) but so much depends on the size of the sprouts. I had a crazy assortment of sizes and the small ones cooked up great in 30 mins, but the larger ones weren't done so I had to put them back in (at 350 so they didn't burn too much). if they are not cooked all the way, they are not that good, but fully done? YUM! Also, I think adding some shallots and toasted nuts would MAKE this dish something extra special.

I think this is a good recipe. My version is to turn up the oven to 425* , and when the have blackened/caramelized then take them out and sprinkle generously with grated Parmesan. I have used...fresh grated, Kraft brand in the dry container, and pre-grated from the deli. The Parmesan adds a buttery nutty flavor that is worth trying.

Pretty good!  Waaaay better than boiling!  We just cut the big ones in 1/2 and put a 'x' on the bottom of the stem.  Biggest tip:  Don't rush it.  let them get dark brown and crispy.  If the kids will eat them - you know it is good!  Happy Thanksgiving!  **Update**Sprinkle & toss with some white balsamic as they came out of the oven - Delish!

I love brussels sprouts---especially the cuteness factor---and was thinking of trying this for Thanksgiving. Last night, I decided to do a test run, and didn't really care for it, even though I also love things that are salty and crunchy. I found them overcooked, although I took them out after 30 minutes. I think even if I'd cooked them for a shorter time at higher heat, it wouldn't have appealed to me. I'm glad others like it, though.

BTW-I think one of the reasons people don't like b-sprouts is that to cook them through, they have to be cooked too long. To address this, I usually halve or quarter the little dears and steam them only briefly until they turn a beautiful green. Another option is to cut an X into them from the bottom so the heat can get into them. This preserves the shape, if you want, while allowing them to cook quickly. 

I found a recipe in a ladies' magazine many years ago that's another great option for making b-sprout lovers out of former haters. I don't remember the exact proportions, but here's the gist: Cook a bunch of bacon (1/2 lb?) until crisp. Crumble the bacon and save the drippings. Slice up or chop a red onion.  Cook the onion s-l-o-w-l-y in the bacon fat until the onion caramelizes. Meanwhile, steam some b-sprouts until bright green. Stir in the sprouts into the onion mixture until just heated through, then add the crumbled bacon, season to taste, and serve. (Maybe caraway seeds in it, too?) Very festive, and, to me, irresistible.

I absolutely adore this recipe, but like most others, I tweak it a bit.  Used about 1 T olive oil, then another 2 T of melted butter, added 1 T garlic powder, 3 T white wine, 2 T spicy brown mustard, then the salt, pepper, and a dash of white wine vinegar.  I'm sure it's delicious with just the 3 ingredients, but mine were spectacular.  I also cooked them less than the time indicated, and they still turned out nice and brown/ caramelized.

Excellent! My boyfriend and I hadn't ever eaten brussels sprouts, but after trying this recipe, we've decided its a keeper and we'll definitely be eating this on the regular! And at $5 a bag at Costco, we can make enough to last for two meals.  It is such a refreshing choice over the standard of broccoli and spinach we usually opt for as our side vegetable - we prefer to eat it with steak or by itself as a snack. Healthy, nutritious, and delicious!

I have said it many times, roasting is the best way to have veggies, and this is no exception!  My husband who does not like Brussels sprouts actually ate this!  You can tweak the spices to your liking, or make it as written and you can't go wrong!  Just measure your salt; roasting emphasizes the saltiness.

I made this exactly as the recipe indicates (doesn't happen often!) and can NOT recommend enough.  So simple, so healthy, so delicious.  It reheats well and actually a cold one (or 7) as a snack is wonderful.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!

I have a new love for brussel sprouts!  I keep this recipe as-is, but just cut the brussel sprouts in half so there is even more of the browned goodness!  I may also try garlic next time.

I discovered Roasted Brussels Sprouts about a year ago.  Until then I hated them!  YUM!YUM! I also add onion cut in eights and sometimes califlower.  Almost any vegetable can be roasted this way and it brings out the sweetness of the veg.  I also half or quarter the sprouts.

This is how i typically cook brussel sprouts.  I halve them first and then bake them for 20-30 minutes tossing 2-3 times.

These were excellent.  I used a one pound bag of frozen sprouts, completely thawed.  I only used 2 tbsp. of oil since it was not the 1.5 pounds called for in the recipe.  Otherwise I followed the original recipe exactly, turning the sprouts every 5 minutes.  Once the stray leaves were blackened and the sides of the sprouts were dark, I took them out.  About 20-25 minutes. YUMMY!

A great way to do brussels sprouts!  Make sure they get really dark brown. The best ones didn't have any green left on the outside. To make it more of a meal I also added whole garlic cloves and green beans. When I had about 20 minutes left I added cherry tomatoes and put some cod in too. A simple and yummy dinner!

Oh my goodness! These were soooo good! I did add a little garlic powder (garlics good in everything) and I add a little spray butter to all my veggies before eating them... I will only be making my fresh brussel sprouts this way from now on, I'm a little excited to try asparagas this way. You have to try it if you haven't before, you might even get people who don't like sprouts to eat it...

We enjoyed this recipe.  In particular, my husband liked the "brussel sprout chips", really crispy leaves that had fallen off the heads as I tossed them during cooking.

I love these. Quick and easy to make. I use FRESH brussel sprouts and chop them in  half for better/evenly roasting.  instead of shaking the pan (never really works for me) I just quickly flip them over. I also line the baking sheet with foil to protect the baking sheet. Otherwise, great wonderful recipe:-)

A simple and great tasting way to make brussel sprouts.  My husband and I have come to enjoy these a lot - I've now made them several times.  I typically use some garlic salt and/or an asian season blend that includes salt, pepper, garlic, etc in addition to salt/pepper.  Very simple and always well liked.  Lots of different variations that you can try as far as seasonings.  Throw them in the oven and forget them.  It's all good!

Never had brussels sprouts until I discovered this recipe.  Not a bad first taste to a vegetable that has such a negative stigma attached to it.  Roasting is definitely the way to go.

awsom I make these all the time but of course I add some extra things to our taste, like garlic powder or garlic fresh added the last 10 or 15 min. sometimes I use garlic in olive oil from a jar, onion power or better yet fresh chopped onions has to be large chunks or it will just burn to death ..just keep an eye on all . I also some times toss in some carrots & potatoes. my brother hates me when I come over and cook for his children and with with recipe I am banned from his house. they refuse to eat veggies but when I made these brussels sprouts they could not believe there eyes the kids actually fought over them and ate them ALL before I could get them on the dinner plates try these for your veggie haters

I'm a brussels sprouts fan but sometimes don't like how strong they can be. The roasting process seems to take that strong taste away. My favorite part are the outer leaves that get really brown and crunchy. I also like to add fresh chopped rosemary before roasting.

These are AWESOME! I have never liked Brussels Sprouts, when I was young, thought I would die when my mother made me eat them. I have been married for almost 24 years and this is the first time I made them. My family was in awe, even my 17 year old who turned his nose up when I told him what we were having, loved them! Try this recipe!

I have to start by saying I did not do the original recipe.  I had the steam bag brussel sprouts.  I steamed them in the microwave for half the time while the oven was heating up.  Took them out, opened the bag and seasoned them per this recipe. Put them in the oven for a few minutes to broil and get roasted and caramel colored.  They were easy and delicious and much easier than dealing with fresh sprouts especially when they are not in season.  I will try them fresh, but this is a great recipe and works well on the frozen steamed bag veggies.

Shockingly delicious. This recipe offered a great middle ground between soft insides and still firm sprouts. I did edit the recipe a tad. I cut the bottoms off the sprouts enough that the small outside leaves fell off then I cut the whole sprout in half. Those crispy little baby leaves were my favorite part! Instead of 400 degrees, I did mine at 350 for 20 minutes. The smaller sprouts turned out tender with a nice roasted outside, and the bigger srpouts kept their beautiful green color held a little more firmness. All in all, this is by far my favorite way to cook brussels sprouts! Even if you don't normally like brussels sprouts, give this recipe a try; it won't disappoint!

Normally, I love any roasted vegetables, but these just didn't do it for me.  I think I will continue to cook these in the more traditional manor.

I would say that making them "almost black" is not a good idea.  I usually cut large ones in half and roast for about 20 minutes at 400 degrees

Tasty! I cut the sprouts in half and cooked at 400 for 20 minutes. I did not remove the core, that would be way too time consuming. Not bitter at all. Next time I plan to add quartered onions. I would like to add some garlic, but worry that it would burn at 400?

I like brussels sprouts to begin with, so I thought this was just a nice new way to prepare them. I felt like they could have cooked for a little longer at a lower temperature, as there were parts that were a little tough and chewy.

Roasted brussel sprouts help me stay on my diet.  They are a great snack.  I tried using the Frozen ones and they worked out great.  Sometimes I add garlic powder and smoked paprika.

This is great - sprouts do NOT taste bitter, which is a problem with other recipes I've tried. It's fast and easy. Flavor reminds me a bit of kale chips. So good.

Best brussel sprouts ever! My husband and I cannot stop raving about this recipe. We are constantly buying more brussels! Olive oil works nicer than canola. After that, we stopped trying different oils and just made sure we had olive oil on hand!

I love this recipe!  I love brussel sprouts roasted better than boiled.  When I want more variety, I add chunks of butternut squash, sweet potatoes, carrots, apples, etc. and bake it altogether with the olive oil, salt and pepper in the oven on a cookie sheet.  Makes a very healthy vegetarian dinner or side dish.    Once you start cooking with fresh vegetables, you won't want to go back to those frozen overcooked plastic microwave in the bags which are so unhealthy for you.  Those bags are convenient, but peeling some fresh vegetables and roasting them, you will be glad that you did because the flavor is so much better.

Very tasty, however I added bacon pieces with  shallots sauteed in bacon fat. Tossed with the sprouts and finally drizzled maple syrup over all.  A definite "make again" recipe.

These were good. I made these for the brussel prout fearing folks at my feast. They did enjoy them. However, I have a better recipe and will most likely opt to make that one over this one. Definitely were tasty though.

I followed a lot of the advice in the comments - added some garlic and roasted for 20 minutes at 425 degrees. They were pretty good! And incredibly simple.

Brussel sprout skeptic no more.  THIS was the hit at Thanksgiving this year.  I have ruined more brussel sprouts than insects in the past.  Thought that it was too simple to be so good.....so wrong! Thank you for the recipe.

Tastes great and easy too.  I added fresh garlic and mushrooms (cut in half) to the bag. Mixed well and baked.  When I read that the brussel sprouts could be a snack to munch on, I thought what a crazy idea.  Now I understand.  It is really easy to just pop them in your mouth and chew.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this at Thanksgiving...at first everyone was "oh know not those smelly things" and by the end of dinner everyone wanted the recipe and the leftovers.  I also like these cold the day after.  Absolutely cannot get enough of them!!  Delish!

This is such a wonderful way to eat brussel sprouts, roasting vegetables is my favorite! Thank you for such a scrumptious recipe!

I brought these to Thanksgiving and every sprout was eaten! I got so many compliments and the recipe was easy. I deviated from the recipe in one way: I cut the sprouts in half. This prevented the "creamy" center that previous comments mentioned.

Liked the texture but the flavor was unremarkable.  A good starting point for brussel sprouts that could be adapted in many ways.

These were the best brussel sprouts ever! They were sweet and crispy on the outside, and soft and dilicious on the inside. I read the reviews and almost added garlic (I love garlic) but didn't. I am so glad I did not change it! Perfect the way it was!

Very good, simple.  we make these all the time and the family never gets tired of them.  I think the kosher salt is a must - not table salt.  I will sometimes add a few slices of chopped bacon to give it a smoky favor ( may want to reduce oil or add cooked bacon near the end of the cooking time).   Sometimes I will add a clove of chopped garlic.     I just love this simple recipe!

I never, in my wildest dreams thought that I would ever love brussel sprouts! This recipe has changed how I look at the most disliked vegetable ever. The only ingredient I would add is granulated garlic which kicks up the taste a bit. Thank you a bunch for this insight!

So good even my 18-month old was eating them! I cut mine in half, and they turned out great; some of the outer leaves fell off and ended up being very crispy and very tasty! The end result is very aesthetic as well.

Not a fan.  Haven't had brussel sprouts in years, but used to love them.  With all the great reviews, I had high hopes, but the seemed a little dry and yet not quite done.  Cooked them the 45 minutes, and they were relatively small for brussel sprouts.

yummy!  I did what other reviewers did and cut them in half to cut down the cooking time.  It was a great and easy recipe!  My husband who insists he hates Brussels sprouts ate them up! (I told him they weren't brussels sprouts, and I called them baby cabbages instead!)

This was a very simple recipe and quite good (if you like brussel sprouts). I blanched the raw sprouts for a few minutes before adding the oil and seasonings. I found it a little difficult to get an even cook with the pan shaking though. Next time I may turn on the broiler at the end to get a little more of a crispy finish.

these were good but nothing spectacular.  an hour is entirely too long for roasting these, by the time my hour was up i had some pretty dark spots.  ill stick with steaming and dousing them in butter and salt.. might do it again but certainly not for an hour.

I admit, I was skeptical because of some of the reviews, but after 25-30 minutes in a 425 degree oven, these little guys were awesome!  My super picky veggie hating husband even liked them!  Very happy to add a new veggie to the rotation.  Thank you for this recipe!

I'm back. I justed tasted the dish. It's yummy!!! Next time I'll use less salt. It's not authors fault. I didn't have kosher salt so I put sea salt, but my grinder wasn't working properly and whole rocks of salt fell in the mix. Other than that it's perfect.

These are wonderful if you follow the recipe and shake them often to ensure even charring. I used 1/4 tsp of Kosher salt and they were salty enough for our taste. Thanks for the new idea for preparing them.

Superb! I halved mine and cooked them for 30 minutes. Probably could have left them in there a little longer as some of the larger ones could have been a little softer. Sprinkled a little extra salt on top when they were done... Perfection!

Brussels Sprouts. Who knew?!? So good, so easy - I don't even measure or waste a plastic bag. Just thaw frozen sprouts, cut in half, cut off ends (if large), drizzle some oil, salt and pepper - done. Great with many entrees.

I only gave it four stars because I modified the recipe a bit.  I marinated the brussel sprouts in Wegmans basting oil rather than just olive oil.  I added some salt and fresh ground pepper as well.  My husband and I loved these.

Excellent!  I didn't do anything different except add some garlic powder, and I only used 1/2 teaspoon salt.  I roasted them for about 20 min, and they were perfect.  I will definitely be making these again. My picky husband gave them a 10.

I love this recipe!  After 20 minutes of roasting if you add dried fruit (raisins or cranberries) and chopped nuts (hazelnuts or walnuts) it adds a sweet flavor.  My mom loved these and she hates Brussels sprouts!

I honestly don't like brussel sprouts but I like to try new recipes and ways to incorporate variety into my diet.  I have to admit these were actually pretty good and I would make them again.  The recipe was very easy, I didn't measure anything...I hardly ever measure.  Thank you for the recipe.

Another triumph!  My boyfriend requested brussels sprouts and I was a bit hesitant because of the sprouts reputation.  He loved these so much I've fixed them twice and he always gets into them before I serve dinner.

I have made these numerous times, and they are simply delicious! So sweet and tender, this recipe really brings out the flavor in sprouts. This time, I used frozen Brussels sprouts because I didn't have any fresh, and this turned out with wonderful results. Sometimes I toss in some baby carrots too, and the flavors of the two together is wonderful! Thanks for sharing :)

Excellent!  I cut them in half before roasting & added fresh minced garlic.  They were perfect at 425 for 25 minutes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I usually steam my brussels sprouts, so I really enjoyed the variety here. Mine turned a little more bitter than when steaming, but still a good flavor.

This recipe is excellent.  For my personal flavoring, i prefer to add lemon juice, garlic, cracked black pepper, and sea salt instead of kosher.  I let it marinade for a few minutes before baking.  This is a crowd pleaser everytime, even with people who claim they've never liked brussel sprouts!

awesome.  Cut them in half to reduce the roasting time and threw out all the leaves that fell off.  BIG MISTAKE! The crispy salty leaves were the best part!  Definitely will make again.

We loved these! I have never liked brussel sprouts until I tried this recipe. They are amazing. I used a bag of frozen brussel sprouts that I thawed in the fridge that day and it worked just the same. They came out so tender, the melted in your mouth.

This is one of my favorite veggie recipes. I roast them for only 20-30 minutes, though -- the charring that occurs is really yummy, but you don't want them to totally burn or turn to mush. I also usually cut the sprouts in half...sometimes they're really big. Definitely keep your eye on them and shake the pan or stir them around a bit every 10 minutes.  For some real fun, throw in a little garlic powder, Adobo seasoning, cumin, or other favorite spices. I've also made this with whole cloves of garlic and cherry or grape tomatoes tossed in. The tomatoes pop open and make a nice little sauce. The garlic turns nice and soft and sweet. And the smell while it's cooking will drive you nuts!

These were amazing! I love the ease and simplicity of roasted vegetables, but I had no idea brussels sprouts would carmelize so beautifully. The only thing I did differently was to use California style garlic salt because I didn't have any kosher salt. I didn't set the timer on the oven and I actually left them in ten minutes longer than I originally intended - they were very dark and charred-looking and I thought I'd overcooked them but the crispy little outer leaves were the best part! I didn't mind the mushy insides but I think next time I would halve them just to get more of that delicious blackened crispiness. I literally ate every last little charred bit that was left in the pan! Thank you for this incredibly easy and delicious recipe!

This recipe is outstanding.  My only additions were a splash of balsamic vinegar to finish them off and a dash of grated parmesan.  Delish!  Definitely will be making this a regular for meals at our house!  Thanks for a keeper!

I tried another recipe for roasted brussel sprouts on this site that i liked much better; this one was just a bit too simple.  I will look for the other next time, I think it had rosemary and balsamic vinegar!  Thanks anyways just too plain; I'm not a huge fan of the bitter taste in brussel sprouts either!

This was an amazing dish!  I have prepared it the last two Thanksgivings and made the mistake the first year of not cooking it long enough.  I think the key to this dish is to cook it long enough until the sprouts are tender and browned.  My son in law even tried this and had seconds.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Wow, this recipe is so good.  I just recently realized that brussel sprouts could be wonderful if prepared properly.  Like others, I also cut the core and halved the sprouts.  I chopped pancetta into pieces and added them in the bag as well to add some flavor.  I cut down on the salt due to the added pancetta.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My favorite brussel sprouts recipe!  I love brussel sprouts but it's so hard to find a great recipe for them and this one is perfect because it's (1) super-easy; (2) yields a delicious final product.  Make sure you check on them every fifteen minutes or so just to give the baking sheet a shake so they don't stick to the pan.  Love it!

I loathe brussel sprouts but try to give them a go every once and awhile.  I actually ate these, which is a first!!! So def 5*, although I don't think I will ever make them again...not the recipes fault, more my quest to love brussel sprouts is over.  I concede defeat.

I HATE Brussels Sprouts so having said that I was at Whole Foods in Portland, ME last month and walked into the prepared foods section when they were giving sample tastings of roasted Brussels Sprouts. I was hesitant at first but after I tasted it, no joke I was won over. So I decided to try this recipe out to see if I could replicate what I tasted. I did, this recipe is fool-proof and now I can say that thanks to this recipe I finally found a way to enjoy Brussels Sprouts!  Update!: If you love garlic try this, take a spoonful of garlic paste (you can buy it ready made at the Indian grocer's or make it at home by putting fresh cloves of peeled garlic in the blender and a bit of water), a few rashers or bacon which have been cut into teeny tiny pieces  and mix it with everything else in the ziplock bag - Heaven!

even when the directions are followed, the sprouts burned in spots, ruining any chance of a good taste. Better to find another alternate to steaming than this Roasted B. Sprouts recipe.

I have never been a fan of brussel sprouts, but my husband loves them.  After using this recipe, though, I buy them as often as I can and prepare them this way.  Be sure to adjust the quantity of olive oil, salt and pepper if using a smaller amount of sprouts.  I buy one package (9 oz) and reduce oil to 1 T, salt to 1/2 tsp and pepper to 1/4 or so.  Very tasty!!!

OH....my....god! The last time I had brussels sprouts (it was years ago), I vowed to never have them again. The name alone would bring a shutter and cringe. However, I thought I would try this recipe out..it sounded good. AND it is!!!! I know that some people did like it, but I loved loved loved it. I can't wait to make a much more sizable batch, now that the initial trial is over. I baked the sprouts in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 min with my french bread, then just left the sprouts in there to continue cooking till the oven wasn't warm anymore. Wonderful. Thank you!

The great thing about this recipe is how flexible it is.  It tastes great as is, but even better with other spices like dry basil, parsley, or even Italian bread crumbs. I like to experiment with these, but will revert to the original later.

I've never eaten brussels sprouts before, so after reading some of the reviews I cut some in half and left others whole.  The soft insides of the whole ones didn't bother or wow me.  The ones that I'd cut in half had more of the carmelized flavor, and were easier to eat because of the smaller size, so in the future I'll probably cut them all in half.  I also shook a clove's worth of minced garlic with the oil, salt, and pepper.  I didn't have kosher salt, so I used regular, and it was fine, but given that some folks have sworn by the kosher, I'll try that in the future to see if I can taste the difference.

I'm on the fence.  I liked these better the next day, cold.  Mine were perfectly dark, almost black.  I liked the carmelized outside and the slightly sweet, creamy middle.  It made for a unique combination.  I would not characterize them as mushy as some reviewers did, just creamy.  They are simple as pie to make, but boy did my kitchen smoke up every time I opened the oven door to shake the pan.  My husband only picked at them, so I probably wouldn't make them again, but I can see why lots of folks loved them.

There is no way to make a mistake with this one! Instead of a bag, I put the ingredients in a tupperware and shook it around.  I did 357 degrees instead of 400 degrees for 1/2 pound of brussel sprouts, and it took 30 minutes. I did some of them whole and some split in half.  I like the ones cut in half better because you get more of that nice carmelized/burnt taste. I also didn't have any kosher salt, so used sea salt which worked fine. I am not a kitchen person and these turned out great!

These were so good! This is now my favorite way to eat brussels sprouts! This recipe is so easy, and the end result is delicious! The Brussels sprouts almost "caramelize" and the salt and pepper give them a terrific sweet, salty, spicy taste. I ate almost all of them myself, because they were so good! I will definitely make these again!

These are very good when you first start to eat them. They also do not make your kitchen smell appealing. I would only make these again for a brussels sprouts lover, not for my own tastes.

Well. We love brussel sprouts.  A lot. However, we were so disappointed by this recipe.  My husband wouldn't even touch them....and that's saying something.  I'm sure it's gotten rave reviews for a reason, but not in our kitchen.

Don't pull them out of the oven too soon - make sure they get nice and dark.

This was a very easy and delicious side dish. You have to watch it carefully because it does tend to burn the stray leaves that are in the pan. I didn't have to cook it as long as it suggested. I do this same thing with winter veggies, red onions, cauliflower, eggplant, broccoli, squash and peppers...mix together with a little oil, sea salt and pepper and then bake. Turn every 15 mins. or so. Delicious

My friend, Lin, told me about this recipe for roasted brussels sprouts.  She said it was delicious and boy, was she ever right!  These were divine!  My husband was all ready to hate these as he is not a brussels sprout fan.  He gobbled them right up.  I had a theme going with tonight's dinner: blackened catfish and these "blackened" brussels sprouts.  I roasted them at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, and I did sprinkle them with garlic powder with about 10 minutes to go.  If you always thought you hated brussels sprouts, give this recipe a go....you will be surprised, trust me!

Brussels Sprouts taste GREAT this way!! I love the texture of them when they are roasted, too. I used regular salt (because I didn't have kosher salt) and also mixed in a few cloves of sliced fresh garlic (as another reviewer suggested). I tossed the ingredients directly in the baking dish, instead of in a plastic bag. The sprouts came out great! Soooo tasty and tender and full of flavor. I am going to share this method with others in my family who aren't keen on Brussels Sprouts, yet, because I think it's because they haven't tried them roasted. Thanks for the recipe!! We really enjoyed it!

These were the best!! I par-boiled for 2 minutes then cooled and put in the ziploc bag with the oil and spices. I cooked for about 20 minutes at 400. I will use tinfoil on my pan next time since I had to throw the pan away!I soaked it for 2 days and couldn't get the black off.

First time trying Brussels sprouts. They were okay. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of them. This is a good recipe, tho. I make my asparugus like this. But on 400 for 6 to 8 minutes, shaking them a bit once half way thru.

I make these for my picky boyfriend and he loves them.  I usually cut them into quarters and rub them between my hands to loosen the leaves. I flip them in a nonstick pan if I don't feel like heating up the oven.  Try them with some garlic and a handful of pine nuts. If my vegetable hating boyfriend will eat them, its a winner. YUM!

OK yesterday I made brussel sprouts roasted with nothing on them to go the healthy route...BIG MISTAKE.  Today I made this and it completely changed my mind to not hate brussel sprouts for life :-).
I used red wine for vinegar and added a few splashes of balsamic when I added in the sprouts.  The onions were so delicious and made the sprouts enjoyable.  It got only 4 stars because it will never be in me to rate a brussel sprout recipe 5. But this is the recipe to go with in my future sprout making.  Will try it with brocolli and asparagus as well!  That might get the five star.

I make a recipe like this often and I add garlic to the sprouts when they are cooking.  The garlic softens and becomes very sweet along with the sprouts. Yum!

This is the only way my family will eat brussels sprouts. We omit the pepper. The longer they bake, the more they take on a sweet nutty flavor.

Excellent recipe.  Coming from someone who didn't like brussel sprouts, if they only tasted like this, I would have been a fan sooner! They were not bitter at all.  The roasting really brings out the sweetness in them.  I did put minced garlic on, but it really got charred from the roasting.  Next time I will use garlic powder on them after they come out from the oven.  Other than that, I wish I had made more.

This was great!!! I made these in a conventional oven at 400 degrees, this way I could keep an eye on them so they didn't overbrown and also so that I could toss them from time to time. Brussel sprouts are delicious and I will definitely make these again!

I've never had brussel sprouts before, so I don't have anything to compare to. This recipe tasted like roasted bitter cabbage to me. My guess is that brussel sprouts just have that taste, because it's hard to mess up food just by roasting it. It looked nice, and smelled good, but my family did not like it.

I had never had brussels sprouts so I was looking for an easy dish to see what they taste like. They are great this way! I used a spiced pepper, and I didn't have kosher salt so just used regular.

Well, it's official -- I'm an addict.  I crave these things.  My favorite part is the outer leaves that fall off and get really black and crunchy.  (If you're conscientious about stirring, you can get them at just the right moment.)  The next step will be me buying Brussels sprouts on the street corner.  It's embarrassing, really...

Best brussels sprouts that I have ever had. All guests at the table agreed even those who initially said 'brussel sprouts...ewww' I put a tad too much salt, but that was my fault.

I made these last night and my husband LOVED them.  Every bite would make him exlaim, "These are SO good!".  I followed the recipe exactly.  I also thought they were good, but I haven't had brussel sprouts before, so I guess I didn't appreciate how bad they can sometimes turn out and that these turned out great.  They were so flavorful and tasted as though there were lots of ingredients (even though it was just oil, salt and pepper).  Will make again!

Very good! This was only the second time I have had brussel sprouts and I thought this was very good. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and cut them into quarters and cooked them for a shorter time. I also ended up having to stir them pretty frequently so that they weren't shriveled up burnt. I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the pan during roasting, I also did add a little extra kosher salt at the end as well as a little smart squeeze (butter substitute to keep it as healthy as possible), a little lemon juice, and a little garlic paste. These brussel sprouts were tender and roasted at the same time. Thanks!

My wife made these for me. I hate brussels sprouts. I didn't enjoy this recipes. They weren't bad, the flavor on the outside was actually quite nice, but inside was still that nasty Brussels flavor. My wife had never had brussels sprouts and she ate all hers but didn't seem to enjoy it. She said they were too salty.

I've NEVER liked brussels sprouts....HATED them no matter how they were cooked. I'm amazed that this one recipe clicked - loved it. I grew up with mom's burnt toast - so I like the charred effect this recipe provides. I read a LOT of different brussels sprout recipes plus nearly all the reviews for this recipe: I followed some suggestions and used both butter and EVOO, kosher salt, coarse ground pepper. I had clarified butter to dip the sprouts into once cooked, but didn't need it. Just be aware of the charring factor - a taste I really love, but not for everyone.

As a person that thought that Brussels Sprouts were "just OK", I LOVED this recipe! I made these last night, and I am already craving them again. I thought mine were done, so I turned off the oven and I let them sit in there to keep warm while I made the rest of my dinner. When I took them out, they had gotten blacker and I was kind of nervous that I ruined them, but they were excellent. Don't worry if they turn black-they're awesome!

Growing up, the brussel sprouts my parents made me eat tasted like there were  vitamins dissolved in them.  So, anything is a step up from that.  These sprouts are almonst too good to be true, great flavor, and wonderful texture.  I also added red onion wedges towards the end of cooking time.

I'm giving this 5 stars, but my oddball hubby thought these didn't even taste like Brussels sprouts, so he didn't care for them.  I'm thinking that the LESS they taste like Brussels sprouts, the BETTER!  Sweet and yummy.

I never had brussels sprouts before and so I didn't know what to expect. It was delicious. The flavor of the outside of the brussels sprouts was great and it was a perfect side dish! Thank you for your contribution!

This recipe is fabulous!  The blackened texture is delicious...I was expecting a burnt taste, but it was packed full of flavor.  My entire family loved it (even my picky 5 year old) and have already asked when we're having it again.  I can see this becoming a family favorite in no time!  I don't know that I'll ever fix brussels sprouts any other way again!

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!  I wrapped large 2" diameter sprouts in tin foil and placed them on the grill. Grilled enclosed for 15 minutes and were blackened and wonderful. Favorite vegetable and will make all summer.

There's a trick to this recipe. I sliced approx. 10 sprouts in half lengthwise and added a fair amount of salt, pepper and olive oil in a freezer bag. They cooked in about 30 minutes at 200 Degrees Celcius and were PERFECT! I mean they tasted like potato chips! My younger brother said they were very salty and because I ate them all the first time around, I made more with less salt, less pepper,less oil. What a mistake. They were still lovely, but the best way to enjoy these is to make sure they are well salted to taste, with pepper and enough oil. Cook for less time and not so hot. Delicious. By the way, did I mention I ate like a kilogram of these? LOL.

Salt + pepper + oil + high heat = DELICIOUS.  You can use this same method with cauliflower florettes.  Thank you, Jaqatac; your mom's a genius.

I've used both fresh and thawed brussel sprouts and both turn out equally good. They are an excellent side dish.  It's true that it's good even the next day.  The heavy 'browning' seems to take away the strong 'brussel' taste and make it very palatable for picky eaters.  Thanks!

Looking for a side dish that is concurrently easy and delicious?  Roasted Brussels Sprouts is the ticket.  Wow, who knew that vegetables could taste so good.  After preparing this, I can now proclaim that brussels sprouts are the most underrated vegetable in town.  I prefer fresh when possible, but I used frozen today--and they were excellent.  Here's a tip that some folks might find  useful: I used a large bowl instead of a resealable plastic bag.  The bowl process worked clean and smooth for me--better than I imagined the bag might be.  I just poured the olive oil and kosher salt into the bowl and worked the sprouts with my hands.  


Enjoy!

Great recipe! I've never liked brussel sprouts until I used this extremely easy-to-make version. Since then, I've made it with dinners I've cooked for family and friend gatherings. There's so little effort needed that it's easy to include on a menu with other items that do require more attention.

I love Brussels sprouts and didn't think I'd like this, but I'm so tired of just steamed so I had to try it.  They were excellent!  No charred taste, but simultaneously sweet & salty. I had serious doubts about eating them cold from the fridge the next day though.  Still excellent!  My poor family doesn't know what they're missing.  None of them like Brussels sprouts and won't even try one.  Yeah me!

This recipe was so delicious! The only thing different was I cut the asparagus in half to avoid having them be mushy in the middle, and I also added garlic salt! This was the 1st time my family ate brussel sprouts and we all loved them including my picky kids :)

Wow, really a simple recipe, but with delicious results.  As others have done, I cut the bottoms off, then cut each sprout in half. In a ziplock, I placed 3 T EVOO -- but 1/2 Garlic EVOO. Added sea salt and freshly ground pepper -- mixed it up a bit, then dumped in the sprouts. I actually let them "marinate" while I was prepping other items for dinner. Then I sprayed a baking sheet with Pam and placed each sprout cut-side down (a must). Roasted them for 1/2 hour  -- and they were beautifully caramelized, extra crispy top skins and totally delicious. Thank you JAQATAC!

Awesome. I cooked them a little lower  temp 375 for a little longer but it was great!  I ate them and skipped the dinner I made to go with them. Next time I’ll try some sprinkled bacon. I plan on doing this for Christmas. It might be my new favorite.

I tripled the recipe because it was for a potluck dinner. Good thing! I came home with only a few left over. I added a step. I put the sprouts in a baggie of kosher salt, pepper and olive oil for about 4hrs before roasting them. It allowed the flavor to soak in. Everyone loved them.

These were simple and yummy! I bought a stalk of Brussels sprouts at a farmers market for something different and was looking for a recipe to make with them. Decided on this one and no regrets.

These are great. Half em like other people recommend and make sure they get that char. 

Update:
After having these maybe twice a week for more than a month, I highly recommend these. Also, I don't half them any more, like other people mention they are delicious whole.

This is a great recipe, but please do not follow step #2 to "place  in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal tightly, and shake to coat." You can do this in any large bowl and stir with a wooden spoon to coat. With the large issues we have in this country with plastic overuse, using a large plastic bag to do this task is simply not necessary. Reduce, reuse, recycle!!!

Following other reviewers’ suggestions, I halved the sprouts and cut off the bottoms prior to tossing in the bag. I also added a touch of lime juice. We tasted it just out of the oven and had to stop ourselves so there’d be some left for others for dinner. Thank you for this easy recipe.

I crave this recipe!  I love how easy it is to make, and I've made it probably a dozen times.  I keep a stock pile of Brussels sprouts on hand at all times for when a craving strikes!  I like to let it cook in the background while I make the rest of the meal.

I slice the Brussels sprouts in half and cook them at 475 instead of 400 in a 13 x 9 Pyrex dish, covering with tin foil to help keep them moist.  Like the recipe says, I shake the dish every 5 to 7 minutes and wait until they are brown with a bit of black on the outside.  My husband loves it.  I love it.  Two big thumbs up.

Definitely cut in half !  I also quartered garlic and included with the Brussels as I LOVE roasted garlic!.. I used a 400 degree oven and laid my Brussels and garlic on it flat side down on parchment paper.   Time in oven for me was 25 minutes. Oh. My. Gosh.  I could literally eat this every single day of my life !

This is a great and easy recipe, please dont waste a plastic bag, you just need to put everything in a bowl and toss with a large spoon.  And consider adding bacon, and or minced fresh garlic or shallot.    When you pull them out of the oven you can add a good quality parmesan reggiano cheese and stir.  Yum.

'm single, never was a good cook. Ate what was quick which led me to fatty and sugary foods. I'm on a journey now for healthier and darn easy recipes (til I get better at it). This recipe was my first effort because it foot the bill. First time I have ever eaten brussels sprouts. Reminded me too much of cauliflower and a couple of other veggies I don't like, so I never tried it. But, I followed this recipe and surprisingly LOVED it! I could microwave leftovers for a snack, too. Now I will expand on brussels sprouts recipes and try other healthy food recipes as well. Wish me healthier on my journey.

Roasted a whole stalk of spouts. Delicious! However, I brushed olive oil and seasonings, adding lemon zest, rather than using wasteful plastic bag.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!   I had a pound of frozen brussels sprouts (eight servings according to the package) on hand; I didn't change any of the ingredients except that I didn't use any pepper.  I sprinkled some nutritional yeast on top of the brussels sprouts then popped it into the convection oven. I baked them at 380°F for 40-45 min.  Perfect!  My husband said that the brussels sprouts are not bad; they're different.  He's never really been a fan of brussels sprouts but he liked this recipe.  The brussels sprouts went well with the fried chicken, noodles, and the pan gravy made from the leftover olive oil and pan drippings.

These are absolutely delicious! I can't remember exactly how long they were in the oven at 400 degrees, but these things are addictive. I made these with fresh brussels sprouts that we grew in our garden. YUM!! Best method ever for making brussels sprouts!

I added smoked sausage, onions diced, and a garlic clove. I baked for 30 mins at 400, and 15 at 350.
All sprouts are really tender and delicious, sausage adds an extra spice!

After following the recipe the first time, we thought these had more oil than we prefer.  I now spray the pan with olive oil spray and after adding and seasoning the sprouts, spray a little more on top and toss.  We like the simple seasoning in this recipe and sometimes drizzle balsamic vinegar before serving.

Did about six, halved and removed choke.  Placed face down on same pan as roasted potatoes.  Drizzled olive oil and sea salt.  Baked 20 at 450 and flipped for 10 more.  Very good.

Like many, I'm not a BS fan; that is until now....followed recipe pretty closely except for 4 small changes. Since I am only cooking for 2 of us older folks (77-83) used only half a pound, put them in  a 10" iron skillet, (easier to flip them). For a little added touch, found that Kroger's brand, Harvest Pumpkin Vinaigrette; is a wonderful dipping sauce, Enjoy all!!! Oops, also ROASTED them in convection oven at 400 degrees F.

I LOVE this recipe and so does everyone when I make it!  I use flavor-infused olive oil (like Chipotle or herb) and don't add as much salt (because I don't use a lot anyway).  I NEVER have leftovers!  Easy to double and even triple the recipe, although I usually just make multiple batches so I can use different oils each time.

I have never made or eaten Brussel Sprouts before, mostly because of their bad rep. I bought a pack of fresh halved sprouts, washed them and dumped them in a gallon bag, followed directions and BAM! They were done, and so surprisingly good! Sweet, nutty, soft, warm... a great fall side. The only reason I probably won’t make these again is because the sprouts apparently attract some serious worms. I cut out a ton of bad spots and found some uninvited guests for dinner. I recommend you get halved sprouts so you can see inside before you cook.

Made this for family, I do not care for brussel sprouts, but I enjoyed these and all the family bragged about them and wanted the recipe which I printed and gave to them.  I had to cook for less time than the menu called for so they would not burn.  Great recipe.

I was super excited to try this recipe. My mouth watered just reading the reviews. I cut the brussel sprouts in half as the thought of soft middles was not appealing to me. I placed in the oven for 30 minutes. I resisted taking them out early despite them getting blacker and blacker. When my husband first saw them he gave me a snicker. I told him, "just wait, they are supposed to taste awesome." My kids looked at me like I was crazy placing a plate with what looked like little black chars on their plate. Everyone tried them and everyone agreed- thumbs down. Husband said the flavor was o.k. but he just couldn't get over the burnt texture. I wanted to like it, but it was a thumbs down from my three kids and husband.

So simple but also very good.  The blackened sprouts taste delicious.  I cut the sprouts in half which cooks the middle better I suspect.  I mixed the ingredients in a bowl rather than use up a plastic bag, seemed to work fine.  I served over white rice, was a great combination.  I am really glad to discover this recipe!

Roasted for 35 min but should have left it for 45. Still very good. I drizzled a balsamic honey reduction on top and added aioli on the side.

400 deg for 40 was perfect.  Reduce the salt by half...since you're eating healthy anyway.

I've made this recipe many times over the years. I empty two frozen bags of brussel sprouts into a Ziploc bag, coat with olive oil, salt, and pepper. I shake up the bag and spread out the contents onto a baking sheet lined with release foil. 400 degrees, 40 minutes and presto... deliciousness! (And very little clean up!) I've shared this recipe with many friends. It's perfect!

There are other great comments for tweaking this recipe to ones personal tastes, but I will share just my addition of sprinkling some quality balsamic vinegar over the top a few minutes before they are done and coating them with Parmesan cheese.

These were AMAZING!!! I cut salt just because I don't like salty. Added a few cloves of minced garlic in the last 7 minutes, just because I love garlic. Simple, healthy, and delicious!!!! Thanks for a great recipe. Oh, BTW, what I didn't eat last night I have been snacking on all day right out of the fridge!!!! Soooo good!!!

OMG I cannot get enough of these. From someone who isn't a huge fan of brussels sprouts, I have to say, it's because every other time I've had them they've been made WRONG. The only thing I did different was cut the brussels in half, chop the bottoms off (to reduce bitterness), and add a clove of minced garlic. So so so good and they store so well! I meal prep for the week and these did not lose any flavour by the end of the week. I highly recommend.

I used two 12 oz bags of plain frozen Brussels sprouts. I added one Tbsp of balsamic vinegar and one Tbsp of minced garlic to the shaker bag, before placing the sprouts in the oven. Other than those tweaks I followed the recipe. This makes the best Brussels sprouts ever!

Just used salt and oil. I had to lower the oven temp to 350 toward the middle of the time so they didn't get too brown/burned, but good other than that. My oven might be a little off.
Reheated in the oven next day and burned them, so be careful doing that if you're gonna oven reheat them.

I made this tonight and it was delicious.  I cut off the stems, which made the sprouts taste better.  I roasted at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and added other vegetables to the mix and everything came out perfect.  I will make this recipe again and again.

This is really the only way I'll eat brussels sprouts. Let the outer skins get nice and toasty, so they're almost like burnt paper. Soooo good like that!

Took advice from other reviews and only cooked it about 15-20 mins (watched for it to turn brown-black on parts). It turned out perfect. I made it for Christmas dinner and got the sprouts ready in a baggie until it was time for it. Super easy and delicious!

I've made these several times, and really like them (if you can honestly say you like Brussel sprouts)........my daughter served them roasted with a honey and sirracha sauce (that's not the right spelling, but I hope you get the idea---spicy pepper).  Those were amazing---sweet and spicy, added to the roasted taste.

These were delicious! I made one change: cut the sprouts in half and baked them for 25-30 minutes at 400 degrees. They  came out still mostly green with some brown spots and perfect texture - crispy outside and soft inside, but not mushy. The best part were the outside leaves that came off in the bag and cooked to delicious crispy brown flakes. So good! I can't imagine cooking them to be all brown/almost black though - that seems like they would get too burnt. I thought they were perfect with the alteration.

First off let me say that I don't like Brussels sprouts, but I am trying to eat healthier so I wanted to try this recipe as a way to get some good healthy veggies into my diet.  Eating these little guys any other way would be a no star or 1 star so this getting a three star from me is huge.  I did add a splash of balsamic vinegar and a dash of red pepper flakes which I think added even more to these little guys.  I cooked the full 40 minutes turning about every 8-10 minutes and about half way though reduced the temp to 350 to finish up.  I will be making this again as it is a good way to get some healthy veggies in your diet and for Brussels sprouts they were tasty.

Fantastic!!!  I did make a couple changes, after reading thru the reviews.... I roasted at 425 degrees for 15, maybe 20 minutes.  Wonderful!  I just finished the leftovers for lunch, and I WANT MORE!!!!!!  Funny how I never used to like brussels sprouts!

I think this is a solid recipe with a few tweaks: 

1. I lowered the bake time from 45 mins to 25 mins. This allowed for the brussel sprouts to roast without being burnt or brown.

2. I cut them in half and baked them face down.

3. I added about 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to add a bit of a kick in the flavor

I never cared for brussels sprouts growing up, but my wife makes a version similar to this that is just delicious. The main differences are (1) a higher temp  and shorter baking time -- usually 425 at 15 min, and cutting the sprouts in half lengthwise so that they cook through quicker.

Chop a couple of strips of raw bacon and sprinkle on top while it's roasting.  Then drizzle a little balsamic vinegar. Much better flavor!!

I have made this several times now and have found it to be easy and sprouts come out sweet, with none of the traditional issues of eating Brussels Sprouts.  Tonight I made a minor change I only used 1/4 of the sprouts and included cauliflower,  and potatoes,  just  for a change.  Big hit. Will continue to roast my sprouts both ways!

Love this recipe.  Of course because I am on a sodium reduced diet, I simply don't add any salt.  I also keep a bread bag on hand to make these.  I pop them in a bread bag with olive oil to do the shaking part.  Sometimes I put pepper on them before roasting, and sometimes not.  They are delicious both ways,  I couldn't believe how sweet they are. They are NOTHING like the yucky boiled brussels sprouts that nearly everyone hates.  :-)

First time I made these I made them as recipe instructed but I cut the sprouts in to halves. They came out borderline burnt but the ones that weren't were extremely good. I thought they tasted so good that I should just work on tweaking the cooking time and temp. The third time I made them was the charm. I cooked them at 375 for approximately 15-20 minutes. That's what worked for me. I also added golden raisins and walnuts for the last 5 or 6 minutes of roasting. I absolutely love brussel sprouts made this way. So delicious!

I was so skeptical because I usually like a honey glaze or mustard, etc. on my roasted brussel sprouts. These were so simple and easy to make, didn't require pre-boiling and came out perfectly roasted in about 35-40 mins. Make sure to shake the tray every 5-10 mins or so as instructed to ensure even browning. They are delicious!

Super simple.  Super tasty.  Caution:  Don't taste for seasoning until ready to serve.  Otherwise you'll keep tasting them and they'll never make it to the table!!

Tip: Lining your sheet pan with foil makes for easier clean up, however if you use stoneware or bare sheet pan, you'll get a crisper and more roasted bottom.  It'll be worth the extra dish to wash.

I absolutely love these but I'm puzzled by the cooking time. Mine were perfect at 12 min! Dark, with some black leaves and not crunchy…perfect. I know all ovens are different, but I'd watch them and not trust the 30 min recommended time!

We LOVE these Roasted Brussels Sprouts!!!  We've made it a lot, usually add a bit of garlic -our fav-, but it's tasty either way...  I usually cut them in quarters because we like them bite-sized and also, they cook a lot faster.   We fight for the burnt pieces, they're the best ;)

Great. I added a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice to bag. And sprinkled roasted pine nuts to the cooked sprouts for extra flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I like Brussels Sprouts any way I can get them.  But this is my go-to recipe.  I cook them for 30 minutes starting at 375.  I shake the pan every 10 minutes to roll them around and reduce the temperature 10 degrees each time.  Thats what works for my oven for the perfect sprouts for my family.

I made a couple changes after readings the reviews. I cut them in half, chopped of the end -the bitter part someone said. And I added minced garlic.  I also only roasted for about 20 minutes (I had califlower roasting on other half of the pan)   and it was delicious! I have never eaten Brussel sprouts before (can't see my dad liking them!) So I knew I was experimenting and hoped it went well. I am now a lover of Brussel sprouts. I may cooked a bit longer to see what it does....I really loved the leaves that came off and we're done a bit more. Yummy!!

Meh. Just okay. I love brussels sprouts but this did not do it for me. They were overcooked and the only flavor was on the outer leaves that were roasted. This looked better than it was. The sprouts were bland and needed something. Maybe if I had cut them in halves they would have had more flavor overall? My husband tried one, but he isn't a fan of brussels sprouts so gave this one a thumbs down. Sorry for a poor review, but it wasn't my thing. I enjoyed trying out a fun new recipe though, so thanks JAQATAC for sharing!

When I was a kid I HATED brussel sprouts.  This recipe was really good with just a few tweaks.  I added fresh minced garlic and cooked them about 50 minutes.  Crunchy on the outside and DELISH!!!

This is the first time I made roasted Brussel sprouts. I love these and I will definitely make it again and again. My daughter who never likes Brussel sprouts actually likes these. It's a keeper!

For straight ahead roasted BS, this is it. It also happens to be an effective way to roast most vegetables. I do recommend keeping a close eye on time to not turn vegetables into coal.

Not usually a fan of brussel sprouts but these were delicious! The brussel sprouts are crispy and salty on the outside, yet creamy on the inside.

We L-O-V-E brussels sprouts.  Usually I steam or panfry with a smidge of butter and salt; so this was a twist.  They were good and the crunchy thin outside leaves were a treat.  A bit nutty in flavor but I think we prefer them steamed.

Eating these yummy Brussels sprouts right now and just had to write my first ever review. I used fresh and followed the recipe  except I cooked them at 375* for 45 minutes.  I also used sea salt and only one 1/2 tsp of the salt.  They are delicious. I love Brussel Sprouts and have always steamed them. These roasted ones were delicious! I wanted to try them reheated but have eaten them all. 
Yummmmmmmmm!

So simple and so delicious!

I actually went to Trader Joe's and bought their frozen brussels sprouts and just thawed them in the fridge over night.  I did end up having to cook them slightly longer, but they turned out great!  I didn't do any trimming or anything to them.  Just cooked as is.

I wanted to try a different side dish for Thanksgiving this year and came upon this recipe.  I think I had only had brussels sprouts once before and it was not a great experience.  But with all of the rave reviews, I decided to give this a try.  I followed another poster's advice about leaving the sprouts in the bag with the olive oil, salt, and pepper for a few hours.  Wow!  This was the dish I kept going back for out of all of the delicious Thanksgiving spread.  The best part is it's so easy.  I will be making these often.

We loved this recipe.  It's been a long time since I have served brussels and now it will happen far more often.  This is an easy recipe and fun.  Fun because your guests will be reluctant and then delighted to be served  a blackened vegetable.

I usually steam my brussels sprouts.  After trying this recipe I will be making them this way from now on.  So delicious!!  I thought I would be overcooking them and would have charred little black sprouts when the time was done, but I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  So good!

These are amazing!  My husband and I LOVE brussel sprouts.  I did make a few changes.  I added about 1/3 cup parmesan cheese, a tablespoon of minced garlic, 3 tbsp. bacon bits, a little more pepper - coarse ground.  It's like eating candy! I didn't think they were at all overdone at the suggested temp and time.  The roasting brings out the flavor.

Having never consumed a Brussel sprout in my life, I decided I had better find a highly rated recipe.  This was delicious!  I was worried about bitterness but this was not a problem with this recipe.  It was easy and so yummy!  I also sliced the sprouts in half and added a few cloves of garlic.

I think the recipe was great! I don't know if I would keep the oven on 350 the whole time though (may be my oven) - but the Kosher Salt made a whole lot of difference!!! Will make again!

Its soooo good! This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write a review. The recipe is just fine by itself, however I did mince garlic and  added crushed red pepper during the roasting process... Once it was done roasting, I added goat cheese and sprinkled a balsamic reduction over top to mimmic a dish I had once at a restaurant. Amazing.

Weather too hot to roast in oven, so cut them in half and tossed them together with olive oil, sea salt, and about 6 whole cloves of peeled garlic.  Put in pie tin, and roasted over 2 right grill burners at lowest setting for 15 min @ approx 350 degrees.  (Left 2 burners on med.)  Grill cover closed.  Stir every 5 min or so.  After 15 min, put my steaks on the 2 left med burners.  Took steaks off after 8 min, left veggies in covered grill over low heat another 5 min while steaks rested.

Made a reduction of 1/4 c balsamic vinegar & 1 T. Sherry.  YUMMY over brussels sprouts and the whole garlic cloves!!!

My Brussels sprouts were tender, browned but NOT burnt, some more brown than others.  (Even my PICKY son loved it!)  Key is keeping an eye on the roasting, until tenderness is where you want it.  This is a great option to heating up the house when weather is still warm out.

This is our favorite way to make brussel sprouts. Sometimes I add 3 or 4 chopped cloves of garlic when cooking and toss them with some freshly grated Parmesan cheese just before serving.

I too would never ever eat a brussel sprout, my family only boiled and they were so bitter, having tried this roasting method it wonderful flavor, as a lover of garlic I add frest garlic diced(depending on how you love garlic) which also gets sweeter when roasted I am now a lover of brussel sprouts.!!!1

The pickiest eaters in our family liked these; the others loved these. I had been trying to recreate a recipe for maple caramelized sprouts from a restaurant with no luck until I tried this recipe, using equal parts olive oil and pure maple syrup, along with the salt and pepper for the marinade and some extra for a dipping sauce. I grilled them, but will definitely oven roast in the winter months. The videos helped.  Printed off extra copies of this recipe, I know I will need them....I will be serving this to everyone!

Holy smokes these are delicious and addictive.  I finally found my brussel sprout recipe! Extremely easy!
I made this a second time and realized its better with a light olive oil and really browned, almost black sprouts.

Like other reviewers, I too baked these at 425 degrees for only 15 minutes and they turned out wonderfully!  I kept the oil and seasoning the same and just rolled the sprouts around on a bowl with them before pouring them out onto a baking sheet. To ensure even cooking, I took the "lazy approach" and just baked them for 7-1/2 min on the middle rack and then switched them to the bottom rack for the other 7-1/2 min.  Terrific taste!

Never had brussels sprouts, so really can't compare this to other recipes, but don't need to after trying this recipe. Excellent! Very easy and quite tasty, my favorite part, the super crispy leaves that fell off the sprout. Thank you for a simple and tasty recipe.

Eh.  This was okay but not nearly as good as I had hoped given all the rave reviews.  The outer dark leaves were delicious and oddly reminiscent of roasted pumpkin seeds, but the insides were just not very good.  Maybe next time I'll try cutting them into halves or quarters so more of the sprout can get seasoned and browned.

This is so simple yet so amazing. I was never a hug fan of Brussels Sprouts before this. I roast my broccoli like this now too and it is delish! Sometimes I add a little garlic powder for funzies!

These are very good. I added some minced garlic into the bag with the olive olive and I thin that gave it a nice additional flavor.

I was very surprised at how good these were using so few ingredients. I did use frozen sprouts and partially defrosted them (in their packaging just left them in the sink)I did end up cooking them longer 45 minutes and then another 15 lowering the oven to 300 since the hubby was home later than expected. They were not mushy as you would expect and can only attribute them to their partially frozen state. Hope this extra info helps someone out there.

This is one of my favorite vegetables to roast and this was a great recipe find.  I did change the oil to either grapeseed or avocado; they are high heat oils and it brings the flavor of the brussel sprouts even more. 
UPDATE: My favorite side dish to make but this time I roasted a bulb of garlic along side of the brussel sprouts. When they were done, I took the roasted garlic (after discarding the skins) and combined the garlic & sprouts.  Just before serving, drizzled balsamic glaze (Monini) all over the top while steaming hot...WOW!

absolutely delicious!!  I converted my 60 year old father, a lifelong brussel sprout hater with this dish, he loves them.  Also, my 2 year old son craves this dish. (You should see the clearly impressed and approving looks I get from other parents in the grocery store when they hear my outspoken little toddler loudly begging that mommy buy him brussel sprouts!)

Delicious!  I made it basically as written, though I did cut the sprouts in half.  I covered the baking sheet with aluminum foil for easier cleanup.  Instead of plain kosher salt, I used a sea salt/lemon pepper combination that I had on hand.  My 18 year old, who doesn't like veggies, had eaten more than a serving before the bowl made it to the table.  The 11 year old wasn't a fan, though.

These were great! I sliced them in half and reduced baking time to 25 min. I was afraid the blackening would result in burnt flavor, but surprisingly it didn't. They were sweet and salty with a small after taste of the sprout. Definitely a keeper.

I always read the reviews before choosing a recipe (that's what I love about allrecipes!). The only thing I did differently the first time I used this recipe was to add some minced garlic. I was concerned about the baking time due to some of the reviews, but we loved the results! At 30 minutes I checked the color and ended up leaving the sprouts in for about 8 more minutes to get those dark, roasted markings. They were not overcooked, in fact, they still had some nice fresh green color. Great recipe! Just use your own judgment and check the color, pulling them out sooner if necessary. They are great hot or room temp, so no worries about timing with the rest of the meal.

These were amazing!  I did alter the time/temp slightly.  I cooked at 400 for the first 15 minutes, then went down to 350 for an additional 15-20 minutes to accommodate something else I was making.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use a little bit less salt.  Maybe an 1/8 tsp next time.

Great recipe! The only "impovement" I suggest: first, after trimming, boil them for 3-5 minuts. Then you will have to bake them for not more than 25 minutes.

I've always eaten brussel sprouts, but never loved them, until now!  

The browner they are, the tastier they are!! Don't throw those little leaves that fall off out.  They turn dark brown and become crispy like potato chips and those are the best part of the dish.  My husband & I fight over who's going to get them.

Thanks for posting this recipe.  It's quick, easy & delicious.

Just as good as what they serve in fine restaurants.  Crispy on the outside, but still soft on the inside. I browned them the full 45 minutes.  I thought the shaking every 5-7 minutes would be annoying, but it only takes a second and you don't have to take them out of the oven.  My husband is not a huge fan of brussels sprouts, but he went back for seconds!  I prefer it with regular fine sea salt, not kosher salt. It didn't get as crispy on the outside with the kosher salt.

This is a great simple recipe with flavorful results. Depending on my mood and as a garlic lover, I will also add it to the mix to provide additional dimension.

I loved this recipe and so did my family. I only made two small variations. I halved the Brussels sprouts so that it wouldn't take long and I also mixed in some red pepper flakes so that they could be spicy.  It was delicious. Will be making them often.

Followed the recipe exactly. Results: Very brown, but they don't taste overcooked. Good flavor and texture. Used premium Olive Oil, french salt and fresh pepper.

Who would have thought so easy could be so good.  They were eaten.  No leftovers in sight.  This will be a regular item on the menu.

It may be my fault but by trying to get them brown and roasted looking, they became dry and no longer tender.

I halve the brussels, add lots of bacon grease instead of olive oil. Awesome way to eat this veggie. Thank you.

Roasted sprouts and served with the Allrecipes recipe of the day-  Lemon Chicken. oMG! Great combo, lemony flavor went well with the chicken, mushrooms and sauce. Could not have gotten a better meal at our best restaurant in town!

I thought it was very tasty.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I found it time-consuming to have to turn/toss the brussels sprouts so often.

Excellent. I have a friend who hates cabbage with a passion and calls brussel sprouts "baby cabbages". When I made these at first he refused to eat them, then relented and in the end said "Hey, these aren't bad". Tweaked a little: 1) Cut them in half 2) Used some garlic powder 3) Baked on parchment paper/cookie sheet and mid way through, placed another cookie sheet on top and flipped the whole thing. 4) Bake until golden brown, not black. They came our a little crunchy and very flavorful.

Without even knowing this recipe existed, I created my own version..sauté them in olive oil to save time and I put salt, pepper, garlic pepper and basil while its sautéing. When done, I sprinkle Parmesan cheese. Amazing!!!!

They would have been better if they weren't so salty!  I followed as stated but they were way too salty. I'll make again but cut back on the salt next time.

This is a good, basic, how-to-roast brussel sprouts recipe which was exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted to combine asparagus and the brussel sprouts for a veggie melange for dinner one night.  Sometimes one veggie offering is boring--a mixture can add interest.  What I did though to speed up the roasting time was to cut the sprouts in half and then proceeded with the recipe as written.  Because they were cut in half, the roasting time was only 20 minutes (and I added the asparagus, also drizzled with olive oil, s & p at the 10 minute mark for another 10 minutes).

Awesome.  Easy to make, better when halved and roasted with flat side down.  Definitely keep in the little leaves that fall off, they get nice and crispy.

This recipe is great, the only way I will make brussels sprout, they are the best when they are baked for at least 40 minutes. Someone suggested 15 minutes, started out that way but so much better when roasted 40 min and they turn crisp and crunchy. Only way my family will eat sprouts.

I didn't go exactly how this was written...I went by another poster's suggestion to bump up the oven temp to 425 and roast for about 15 minutes only.  Came out perfectly!  I also used sea salt instead of kosher salt.  Yum!

Like another poster suggested, I roasted these at 425 for a much shorter time, and they came out great! (Disclaimer: This was in a convection-like oven, so it actually took even less than 15 minutes and left the outsides very crispy!)

So easy! I love ordering roasted brussels sprouts at steakhouses and the deli section of Whole Foods and know I can replicate the flavor at home with little effort. I was a little aggressive with my salt, so I'll definitely take time to measure next time. I also oven roasted the brussels sprouts whole, but next time I want to try cutting the sprouts in half to have more surface area roasted in the oven.

This is so easy and so tasty I don't see how any Brussels sprout lover couldn't love it.  I cooked mine a bit long because I like the toasty flavor when they get a bit charred, but that's just my personal preference.  Totally a go-to in our house!

WOW!! After reading several reviews I wanted to stay as true to the recipe so I could compare, but I did change a couple things. I only set the oven to 400 degrees only because of something else I cooked that required that temp. I parbroiled the cut halves of fresh brussel sprouts (and leaves that fell off)  for about a min if that, let them cool a tad in strainer.. oiled a baking pan, placed them cut side down, sprinkled leaves all over and then added oven-baked (not totally cooked) pieces of bacon. YUM! Sprinkled on some sea salt. Cooked for 15 mins, stirred it up a little and cooked for another 15 mins. WOW!! That about sums it up. Try it!

Slice in half lengthwise and place cut-down on cookie sheet.   Be sure to include the leaves that fall off -- they turn into wonderful little chips.

This recipe was ridiculously good.  I made a few changes since my husband hates brussel sprouts I didn't think he'd eat them as is.  I halved the brussel sprouts, added some chopped red onion, one clove of garlic and about 3 slices of thin sliced pancetta.  My husband still didn't eat it but that's fine since it means more for me.  I loved it!

I love roasted sprouts! I never do them this long, 20 minutes is usually sufficient. Add a bit of garlic powder and parsley flakes, very yummy!

This is my second time making this recipe.  I have always roasted them for 15-20 minutes until just done.  These are totally delicious and different, and I added the 2 cloves of crushed garlic recommended by another reviewer.  Heaven!

The only thing this recipe is missing is LEMON JUICE. Trust me. It makes it even more delicious. Garlic is a great addition as well. I love the use of kosher salt in this recipe. As for the time in the oven: it just depends on the kind you are using. When using the large sprouts fresh off the stalk, 30 to 45 minutes is perfect. I used frozen sprouts this time, the kind that comes in little cardboard boxes in the frozen section. It took a bit longer than 45 minutes, even though the sprouts were small. It is definitely worth it to cook it long enough to brown a bit, as it develops a caramel-like flavor. It's worth making more than you will eat because it's especially delicious when cold! It's a delicious side dish and the leftovers are a great healthy snack.

Fantastic.  I put the sprouts in a cast iron skillet and cooked in the oven for 25 minutes with a little extra olive oil.  I put a handful of shredded parmesan cheese on top before eating.

Today I noticed as I was getting the garden ready for the upcoming season  there were actually sprouts growing from last year (note: it’s April 1st and I’m in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 6).  Who knew?   I couldn’t have picked a better recipe to try.  This was fabulous.

Maybe it's not fair for me to review this since I don't like brussel sprouts in general, but since I know they are healthy I was trying to find a tasty recipe.  This was not it.  Sorry!  :(

I had never cooked brussel sprouts before, and found this recipe right away - I only wanted to make a small amount, so I cut off the brown bottoms, stuck a handful or two in a ziplock bag, eyeballed some olive oil, salt, and pepper, shook it around, and stuck it in the oven. While it did seem to take at least 45 minutes, I let them get nearly black - and they were DELICIOUS. I will be making these again tomorrow!!! SO easy, so yummy!

Love this recipe!  Even my grandkids eat these sprouts.  The confusion about how long to cook the sprouts is totally dependent on the size, age of the sprouts.  Old and large take the full 45 minutes.

This is my favorite way to eat brussels sprouts.  It is like eating little garlic wonders of love!  I prefer to blanch my brussels sprouts in salted water first for 1-2 minutes and then roast in the oven.  I find it cuts the cooking time in half and ensure the brussels sprouts are cooked through.  It also helps to eliminate any bitterness.  I do the same thing with broccoli and cauliflower.

These were so delicious and the preparation could not be easier. The only way you could mess up this recipe is if you didn't watch them in the oven and let them burn. Some of the salty, crispy outer leaves tasted like popcorn to me. I let them get nice and caramelized and they were fork tender after about 45 minutes.

These were delicious.  I skipped the plastic bag step and just put 1 tbsp oil in the pan with the sprouts.  If the pan is sufficiently roomy, the sprouts get coated with oil easily as they roll around when you shake the pan.  Then I lift one edge of the pan and roll them all to one side for a thorough salt & peppering before I shake the pan again to spread them out and then pop them in the oven.  If you'd like to use bacon drippings or another solid fat instead of olive oil, just add it to the pan in the oven while you preheat.

I love this way of preparing Brussels sprouts. For me, the darker on the outside, the better. I bypass the baggie and prepare the pan with some evoo. Then I put the sprouts on the pan, coat with a small amount of evoo and add a little kosher salt. I do try shaking the pan at least twice during cooking to insure uniform cooking.

We've had a tradition in our family for over 40 years that everyone had to eat at least one brussel sprout at Christmas - a tradition that I carried forward from when I was growing up (not sure how/why it was started).  As my husband is the only one that likes them, the children and I would pinch our noses and force one sprout down every year.  At Christmas this year I made this recipe (as written) and we couldn't get enough of them.  We went through the entire 1 1/2 pounds and were wishing there were more.  In fact, my daughter has prepared them again since Christmas for her family; and my husband and I had them again last night.  Who would have known - Delicious!

I have never been a fan of brussel sprouts, my mother ruined them for me as a child by making a monthly dinner of liver and onions and boiled brussel sprouts for my father, who clearly must have had his taste buds ruined in a tragic accident before I was born. Anyway, this dish has made me a convert. I followed the recipe and threw in some sliced onions to the mix just to see what happens. Oh my goodness, those crispy carmalized bits were so very tasty. Brussel sprouts have once again earned a place at my table, though I don't think liver and onions ever will.

Very simple and delicious! I added garlic, like other reviewers suggested, and increased the flavor a bit. I squeezed part of a lemon on top afterwards.

This, for me, is the perfect way to prepare Brussels sprouts. It's easy and flexible. I cut the sprouts in half, which cut the roasting time down to about 20 minutes. I also finished off the dish with toasted sliced almonds and some fresh lime juice.

After trimming the outer leaves, cutting the bottoms off and slicing them in half, I soaked my sprouts in a bowl of salted water for an hour (I'd heard this is helpful removing some of the bitterness associated with brussels sprouts). I then parboiled them for a couple minutes, strained the water out and made sure they were dry. Tossed in a few splashes of garlic-infused olive oil, sprinkling of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, these were great! I roasted them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cut sides down, so the outer leaves would get crispy and carmelized. I popped them in along with my stuffing that was already baking at 325. The leaves still browned and crisped up nicely after 20 minutes. I'll continue roasting my sprouts instead of any other method of preparation.

My friend is not a vegetable person, but she actually said she couldn't believe how good these tasted. If you knew her track record with veggies, you would understand how monumental that comment was. I just tossed the sprouts with a few drizzles of olive oil right in the pan, and roasted them for 20 minutes because I prefer them only mildly browned. If you cut them in half, you get more surface area for things to get roasty and delicious. I also put some shredded parmesan on top, which got all crispy... definitely the best way to make these!

Wow! These were actually really good. I remember trying brussels sprouts when I was young and absolutely hating them. Now I think I'll be making them pretty often. My Dad picked up a giant stalk of the things on his annual grocery visit, and I wasn't very enthusiastic about them. I decided to try this recipe and I'm very glad I did. The texture was just perfect- not too mushy or too hard, just as a vegetable should be. They were salty and had crispy outer leaves. I added two cloves minced garlic, a slice of bacon crumbled into pieces, and roasted them for exactly a half hour, shaking them pretty often. My Dad and my brother liked them very much and so did I. Thanks for the awesome, healthy dish!

The best way to eat brussel sprouts! I roast these in a glass dish in the oven on 375 for 20 minutes, turn the brussel sprouts every 6 or 7 minutes. Must add some minced garlic too. So yummy and healthy!

I read reviews and only cooked them a little over 15 minutes based on reviews. Normally we would not eat brussels sprouts because we don't like them.  However, several friends said to prepare them this way and we would like them.  Well, we tried them and still don't like them.  Roasting them made them edible, which was better than other methods but we would not make this again.

Fantastic! My favorite way to prepare this super food to date. I like adding some garlic powder into spice mix for added flavor and reduced roasting time to 25 minutes so the sprouts don't get super black.

Super easy and delicious. I cut them in half and in quarters if they are bigger. This will cut down on the cooking time and there will be no mushy brussels sprouts. I made some today my 8 year old loves them!

this recipe was SO GOOD that i had to come back to it to leave a review after i already had closed the page.   as a cook you must continually be reminded that sometimes, SIMPLE = BETTER.  there are 3 ingredients to this recipe and wow is all i can say.  the combination of olive oil, salt, and pepper mixed with the soft but crispy leafiness of the sprout is something that makes you pause in the middle of your kitchen, and think to yourself, WOW.  this is the kind of thing that put me here to begin with!

Eh. I followed somebody else' suggestion to halve them and it didn't turn out so good. What happened is when you trim the bottoms, the leaves fall off and then those individual leaves burn to a crisp. So I pulled them out after 25 minutes, but the whole ones were not quite done. Next time I'll know better.

FANTASTIC!!!!  I cannot believe how simple, yet delicious this recipe is.  This is by far the best recipe that I have ever used to make brussel spouts.  This is a great side dish, or just a great snack.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I will make these again & again.

I cut them lengthwise (the stem ends can taste bitter if you cut them widthwise) & marinated in a baggie overnight.  YUM!!!  Will be making this one again!

I feel that this is the best way to eat brussel sprouts.  very simply dish to put together on a busy day.  I did not make any changes, except I did keep an eye out just in case of over roasting.

Great way to make brussel sprouts! I cut them in half but otherwise followed the recipe and these came out great. Mine were nicely browned and not overdone or mushy at all.

I cut the sprouts in half, tossed in a bowl with oil, salt, and pepper, and baked for probably 25-30 minutes, checking and shaking every 5 minutes.  The loose leaves that got crispy and brown were the yummiest (my kids agreed that they tasted like chips), but the whole thing was delicious!

Oh My!  I hadn't eaten Brussel Sprouts since I was a child - never particularly liked them and it must have been the way they were cooked.  Anyway, when I saw this recipe, I thought it worth trying because my husband has periodically asked for them.   Only one word:  DELICIOUS!!
I roasted them at 425 degrees for about 18 minutes.  If they don't get eaten right away, they warm up nicely in the microwave.  Thanks for providing this great recipe!

These were great with the help of others' suggestions.  I did temp at 425 and roasted them for about 15 minutes.  I also cut them in half and cored them.  Everything else I followed recipe.  My husband, who "hates" Brussels sprouts, said they were great, had seconds and told me that if I want to make them again he would be happy to eat them.  Thanks for the recipe and the suggestions!

The basics on this are good, but definitely need to zest it up with some onion and garlic powder, pepper, etc.

Cut sprouts in half if they are large; otherwise the cooking time will be much longer.  

Also, definitely add minced garlic!!

Never had brussels sprouts before and had always seen the typical shows of kids dipicting them as gross and disgusting. But my four year old saw them in a grocery store and said she wanted to try them. We try to encourage her to try new things and if she sees something she would like to try we get it. From common fruits and veggies to stuff we have never tried or in some cases even heard of if she asks we get them and try to learn how to eat them. So I bought half a pound and proceeded to hunt up a quick and easy recipe. I happened upon this one and the review to cut them in half and now I'm hooked. My whole family loves them! I can never make enough and there are never leftovers! Even if you hate brussels sprouts I would reccomend giving this a try! I hate mushy veggies a toothless person could eat. So I always take mine out when they are just getting tender but still have a little curnch to them. Great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing it!

LOVE LOVE this recipe. I usually don't need to put it in for as long as the recipe states though. Just keep an eye on them so that its not overly blackened. This is the only way I like brussel sprouts!

Love it! I never thought I'd eat brussel sprouts ever, but this recipe was so easy to make that I had to at least try making it and I'm so glad I did. I baked it at 425F between 20-25 until I saw some dark brown crispy leaves. Will definitely be making these again and again.

My husband raves about these and begs me to make them again and again. They are terrific. I like to cut mine in half and love the leaves that fall off and turn crispy brown. Warning: they are so good I ate way to many and ended up with a belly ache, lol.

These were good but they still taste like brussels sprouts.  They taste like any roasted veggie, a little charred, which I like as a change from steamed or sauteed.

I usually pan fry brussels , but this sounds just as good. I used to hate them, until I found burning them a little and cooking them in REAL butter until a knife passes easily makes the bitterness go away! Brown=better! :)

My husband loves brussels sprouts and these were delicious. The loose leaves turned very dark but they were sooo good, nice and crispy. I did start the oven at 425 for about 15 minutes then turned it down to 400 for another 15 or 20 minutes.

fantastic way to prepare brussel sprouts that doesn't require butter or bacon!  i made with olive oil and cavendar's greek seasoning blend.  next time i will cut in half because i like the outsides best -- especially the little burnt crispy leaves that stuck to the cookie sheet.  YUM.

loved it, especially for its simplicity and ease in prep. we buy our sprouts prebagged from Costco so all you need to do is dump in the oo and seasonings and dump them out on a tray.

Just cooked up this recipe... and it is worth every star!  It's fast and easy AND my son likes it.  He's 6 yrs. old and like most kids, he does not like to eat the things that are good for him.  Great job and THANK YOU for posting it!

Awesome..  Added chopped fresh garlic to the bag.  My wife and I are both not huge bsprout fans but these came out great.  What a way to force vegetables down with pleasure. Did something similar with beets as well.

I have never been a fan of Brussels sprouts but I really love this version.  I cut the stems off and cut in half then added a medium sized clove of garlic as suggested by other reviewers.  Also cut in half to ensure they cooked through.   I baked at 400 for 15 minutes then shook and cooked about 5 more minutes.    Could have maybe cooked a few minutes longer as the burnt looking pieces were surprisingly the best.  I think they would have been better with a little shaved parmesan on top - will try that next time.   A great way to prepare these!

So delicious!  I've never been a fan of Brussels sprouts because, well, they're bitter and gross. Even with all the butter in the world, my boiled or microwaved sprouts had to be choked down. I had no idea that ROASTING really makes that big of a difference!! I followed the advice of another reviewer and "cored" the sprouts (which I think means cutting out the little thing in the middle/center on each one), and it seemed to make a real difference. I will definitely be making these again! Thanks!!

Yum! Tried it the way it was written the first time and I have converted my husband and son who swore they would never eat brussels sprouts. They now ask for them. I now cut mine in half and boiled for a few minutes first to cut down bitterness. I also added some garlic and pancetta.

we loved them!  I halved and quartered the sprouts, which I think was a good idea, there was more flavor.  Also, make sure you shake the pan every 5 minutes, it only took about 20 minutes total cooking time to come out perfect!

These were so much better than when I steam them. Much more flavor. I received a lot of compliments at Christmas dinner. I actually ran out. 1.5 pounds did not go far. We did have to pick off a few of the outer leaves because they became crispy when blackened.

I followed the recipe, but stopped the roasting after 25 minutes as they were already brown/black. The insides were soft and sweet, but I definitely didn't care for the outsides. They just gave them a charred, unpleasant flavor. I'll try a different way to cook them next time.

The best way to cook Brussels sprouts ever. Follow the directions about watching the temp and time ....apparently some reviewers didn't read the directions. This does matter. 
Try this recipe and you will love Brussels sprouts.

I was inspired by Top Chef.  One of the chef roasted brussel sprouts.  It looked delicious and he won the challenge.  I needed to incorporate more veggies into my diet and decided, why not?  This is an excellent way to cook brussel sprouts.  Add the minced garlic as a reviewer had suggested, and sea salt or kosher salt makes the difference.  I was worried about the browning but it really does give it an overall great flavor.  I also went with cutting them in quarters to let them cook quicker.  This is my new favorite veggie.

Fabulous! Always looking for new ways to prepare vegetables and this won all six members of the family. Its simple and tasty. I microwaved the sprouts first (to cut down roasting time) and added minced garlic to toss and shake, shake, shake...pour on tray and roast!

I just came across this as I have cauliflower, carrots, potatoes with the skin on and broccoli in the oven roasting them the same way. So you can do any veggie this way. It is so healthy and easy.

Great recipe. Roasting seems to bring out the flavor of the sprouts. I added balsamic vinegar, lowered the heat to 350 and cooked for 45 minutes.

I made these two nights ago. I too did not care for the mushy middles, and I did halve them. But whoever said keep the leaves that fall off... I'm so glad I paid attention. They were the BEST and I've been craving them for days! I would compare them a little to a fried green tomato taste. I want to buy a bag of the loose leaves and roast them. Haha.

Let them get (near) black - it carmalizes the skin so it is chewy and flavorful (not burned tasting), it is so good. I cook it more or less to the temp and time of the recipe, letting some get real dark, and other stay a lighter brown. The dark ones are always the best.

I added a pinch of garlic powder, Italian herbs, and freshly grated Parmesan Reggiano. The whole platter disappeared, and the kids asked for more. 

A great side dish with roasted chicken.

Perfect! My kids and husband request this all the time, so I had to add brussel sprouts to my garden. I would recommend cutting them in half before coating with oil mixture to prevent mushy middles. Also if you are a garlic lover add minced garlic to the bag as well. Wonderful!

I have eaten brussel sprouts before but never prepared them.  I am so glad I came upon this recipe.  I also did further research on how to prepared them and found that creating a slit at the end will help them cook evenly.  I halved mine, created a quarter inch slit at the end, added garlic and onion powder in the bag, and it was a hit.  What a great way to create a healthy side dish.

Made these tonight and they were delicious. I baked them in olive and white truffle oil. I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of onion and garlic powders. In  the end I added cheese just because I love cheese. Delicious!

I have to give this five stars because for the first  time ever in my 35 years i actually liked Brussels. My husband and i enjoyed the roasted flavor  without any musyness. I halved these before I flavored and roasted. These will be made over and over again at our house.

These were different...I still gave them 4 stars because I can see how others would like them. The texture was great; however, I did not care for the burnt taste and even though I used about 1/2 of the salt the recipe called for I still thought they were quite salty.

Soooo simple yet absolutely delicious! My sprouts were ready in 25 minutes at 400 degrees.  They are definitely best immediately out of the oven.  Once they start cooling down, they are not as crispy and good.

Wonderful simple recipe! I do think they turn out better in a clay baker vs. a glass baker. I have cut them in half and kept them whole, either way is great. I have added fresh garlic pieces and that is great too! I never dreamed that I would love brussel sprouts! Even my picky husband loves this recipe.

This is the first time I have cooked and eaten brussel sprouts and I have to say these were delicious!!  I don't care for overcook veggies so I took the recommendation of other reviews and cooked them at 425 for 15 minutes.  They were still a bit too soft for my liking so I will still cook a less time on my next attempt. I also added minced garlic because I think it makes veggies even tastier.  Thank you for this recipe, I will be definitely be using again and again!!

Delish!  I like brussel sprouts, but hadn't found an easy and simple way to make them that added some flavor while keeping them savory vs. sweet. I cut the sprouts in half and roasted at 400 for 15 minutes (shaking the pan every 5 min.) and then down to 350 for 5 more minutes and they were perfect.  Easy and yummy - I'm looking forward to leftovers tonight!

followed Corrina's review and advice by baking at 425 for 15 minutes and they were perfect. Not overdone and evenly baked.  Drizzled olive oil. Added fresh black pepper, sea salt, garlic powder and they were delicious!

This is so delicious that I now buy my brussel sprouts at costco! And this is coming from a girl who didn't even like brussel sprouts before.

The recipe is tasty as is, but I usually substitue Johnny's  Garlic Bread Seasoning for the salt and pepper.

I never had them before and I thought it was Da-Lish. I added garlic and cut them in half and cut out the chokes as suggested. I left them in the oven on 375 for about 20 min ( I was only making 10) and then turned it up to 400 for 15 - 20 min more. They came out great.

There were fine, but didn't thrill me. I shared them with a co-worker the next day who thought they were awesome..... so that just proves that everyone likes something different. Give the recipe a try and you might be one of the people who enjoys them.

This recipe is SO simple and so tasty! I cut the brussel sprouts in half and added cut red potatoes.. since the cook time & temperature are basically the same. What an awesome combo! I will definitely make these again.

I've made these multiple times now. My boyfriend had never eaten a brussel sprout in his life,but I made these and now he's always suggesting them! We're going out of town tomorrow and was actually kind of hoping he would've suggested them tonight!

This was amazingly delicious and so simple.  My family was fighting over who could have the last spoonful.  I am definitely incorporating this into our regular dinner menus!  I only regret I've gone so long before discovering this easy, yummy recipe.

Tried this one for dinner tonight. I added 3 crushed cloves of garlic as others have mentioned, and this was fabulous! I cut the brussels sprouts in half, and turned them over after 15 minutes, to cook for another 15 minutes.

Delicious!  This was the first time I'd ever eaten brussel sprouts, so I wasn't sure I would like them, but they were very tasty and easy to prepare.  It's nice being able to add a healthy recipe to my collection.

This recipe is so good and easy.  To save a ziploc bag, I just threw all the ingredients into a big bowl and tossed them with my hands.  They came out perfectly.  I also totally disagree with the reviews that say that this yields overcooked brussel sprouts; I baked for 35-40 minutes at 400F and they came out perfectly.

This is a really wonderful recipe the only thing I add and have added for a few years is garlic.  Just add a few cloves of fresh garlic and this gets people who would never touch brussel sprouts thinking they are the best thing in the world.

20-25 minutes is about all it takes to roast these.  I like to coat mine with italian salad dressing before roasting.  5 minutes before they are done, I pull them out of the oven, sprinkle them with seasoned bread crumbs, drizzle a little melted butter, then put them back in to finish.

Good, but I prefer to pan fry with a little EVOO and lots of butter.  Add some garlic to the fry a couple of minutes before you take them off and enjoy!

These Brussels sprouts are wonderful!  I'd always made them following this recipe exactly but recently I changed it up a little bit.  I now use sesame oil instead of olive oil and add a clove of pressed garlic and several dashes of balsamic vinegar to the bag before shaking.  Very tasty!!!

not to knock the recipe, but i agree with hotter, faster method.  shaking the pan every 5-7 minutes is too meticulous for me.  400 - 425 degrees.  10-15 minutes.  

everyone agrees at the end of the day.  oven-roasted brussels sprouts are dope.

A-. Very good. For ease, I also parboiled for approx 3-5 minutes beforehand to ensure tenderness. I also mixed in some cayenne pepper in the salt/black pepper mix for a kick but only a little bit. And also roasted with big chunks of white onion sliced, potatoes (fingerlings sliced small) and chunks of carrots. Very good and at 375 degrees for about 40 mins, cooks all at about the same time. Yummers!

As someone who grew up with a garden in their back yard (and brussels sprouts were grown every year), I thought that I had had brussels sprouts every way imaginable....but no, and this was one of the best ways that I have had them ever!  I made them tonight for dinner and even though they had all these amazing reviews I wondered how such a simple recipe could be so good.  After I made and ate them, I had to comment because they were sooooo good!  Probably the best preparation for brussels sprouts that I have ever tasted!  And very easy which makes it even better!  :)

These were delicious! Never liked brussel sprouts before, but these were great! Baking is def. the way to go, as it helps them to cook thoroughly in the middle and helps them to melt like butter.

Never roasted brussels before....these are GREAT!  However, I had my oven at 350 while a ham was warming and they turned out just fine and cooked just as fast....I fear they'd have burned at 400.  I prefer this to steamed brussels any day.

Never been a big brussels sprouts fan, but these are great and they ARE addictive!  I could eat them every couple of days. I usually cut the big ones in half and leave the smalls ones whole because I like mine to be a little brown on the outside. Give them a try.....you may be surprised how much you like them.

These could not be more tasty! I do alter it to omit the oil and spray them with a butter cooking spray but the hot oven and the time listed in the original recipe is right on...at least for my stove. I can't stop eating them! They are especially good with a drizzle of good balsalmic vinegar - either while they are hot or after cooling. Yum!

Roasting takes these babies to a whole new level.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I'm glad I did because they are fantastic.  Nutritious, delicious, and so easy to prepare.  All I have to say is "Welcome to the family, tasty little sprout receipe!"

These turned out really well actually. I cooked them most of the way in the microwave, then sauteed them in a pan with the salt/pepper/basil mixture and olive oil instead of butter and they were perfect.

Easy, delicious and nutritious!  I added 1/2 an onion (thinly sliced) then roasted at 375 on convection for about 35 minutes, until outsides were just about charred. I also added a few dashes of Balsamic for the last 10 minutes of cook time. Absolutely perfect!

These were fabulous!  Actually roasted until they were blackened and crispy on outside and had the 'creamy' texture inside.  Added some lemon zest to brighten flavor a bit.  My husband didn't recognize the taste as brussel sprouts.  We both enjoyed thoroughly and will make again.

It was a good basic recipe for the sprouts but it was missing something.  A friend recommended to throw in some balsamic so I'll try that next time.

Tasted great, but I was put off by the almost black look. Just not appetizing looking. Wish there were a way to get the roasted flavor without making them look burnt.

This recipe is outstanding. The only thing my mom does to make it better is that she adds real bacon bits (she cooks the bacon and crushes it -- no jarred bacon bits). I'm sure she throws in some garlic in some manner.

Dee-lish. I followed the suggestion to halve the sprouts before cooking them as well as to cut out the "choke" at the bottom, and they turned out great. You do have to keep shaking them to keep them from burning, and I didn't leave them in the entire time called for -- these definitely need to be attended to. But we thought they were marvelous!

These are very good and much better than boiling.  It was my first time to use fresh instead of frozen.  I roasted earlier in the day, then reheated for 10 minutes or so before serving.

The best Brussels sprouts I've ever had!  This was the first time I've ever made fresh sprouts.  I am so spoiled now! It will be hard for me to go back to frozen.  I only had to roast these for 30 minutes.  They were delicious! The roasting brings out the sprouts' natural sweetness, and there was basically no bitterness that you often get with frozen sprouts.  So yummy and eye-appealing on my Thanksgiving table!

This recipe is simple and tasty. I cook mine a little longer to obtain a little charred flavor. Everyone enjoyed them when I made it last year and I"ll make them again this Holiday season. I didn't have Kosher salt so I used Sea Salt and it turned out fine.

These turned out great.  I got some brussels sprouts given to me, and I wanted to find a way to use them that wouldn't gross me out!  This tasted great, and my 7 year old couldn't stop shoving them in her mouth!  Thanks for the great recipe!

A different way to cook brussels to be sure. They smelled awful while cooking and the taste out of the oven was not bad. But the next day, Wow! I was eating them COLD out of the fridge! I will be making these again.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I followed it to a tee, twice, and each time they got burned beyond belief. The second time I lessened the time a little bit, and I could actually taste them, but still too burned to be called edible.

The best way I have to make brussel sprouts.   The high heat seems to mellow the bitterness that I normally taste when I make these.  Don't worry that they turn dark.   I prepare asperagus the same way.

First, a disclaimer, I am a habitual snitcher.... I taste everything in the various stages of preparedness (except brownie batter - I go straight to the batter with a BIG spoon, no "snitching" there). So I put the sprouts - mine were exceptionally large, so I quartered them - in the bag with the oil and seasonings.  Then I tasted.  oh, they were sooo good!  I probably ate a good third of them like that.  They were sweet and salty and I love the flavor of good EVOO. Then I cooked them.  My 8-yo son said they tasted better cooked (I had made all the kids try them raw, they were so good), but he didn't eat more than the one; my 6-yo daughter and I liked them better raw; my 3-yo girl threw them up both ways, and dh wouldn't touch them at all. So my final rating is, good recipe, just don't cook them!---------edit: I have changed my mind.  This is the BEST way to eat brussel sprouts.  There is just no comparison.  Except, I stand by my admonition to just eat them raw.  I have been making a quart ziploc of these every week, and snack on them through the day - they get better the longer they sit in the marinade; I eat them for dinner when the rest of family is having carrot or cucumber sticks; 2 of my children snitch them out of the fridge when I am not looking.  And if I really want to cook them, so the rest of the family will eat them, they are already marinated.  All around, a happy happy recipe :)

The last time I had Brussels Sprouts was about 25 years ago. I was little and my Mom told me they tasted like candy. They didn't. Fast forward 25 years later. I'm on an elimination diet and in the 'it's OK to eat me' list is Brussels Sprouts. I decided to try this recipe based on the reviews of others (especially those who thought they hated Brussels Sprouts).  The recipe is OK. There was only a faint taste of the sprouts - that's because they were close to incinerated. I took someone else's suggestion and halved them and only roasted them for 30 minutes. They tasted just like the onions that get burned when I do a roast. They tasted over roasted and undistinguishable.  Meh - won't make this again. And no, these didn't taste like candy either.

Hello Sprouts!  I started a diet and have done great and just needed to introduce more veggies, gave it a Try, and what a flavor.  My grandmother was right, it is NOT that you don't like vegetables, you just don't like the way they were prepared.  I did not use salt because of the diet so I seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  What everyone says is TRUE the toasted leaves YUMMY,  the roasted brussels are just so delicious WHO KNEW???

These were excellent! Very easy to prepare and extremely tasty. I used frozen Brussels sprouts and they did just fine. I parboiled them first like one reviewer suggested, which decreased the roasting time. I will be making these regularly from now on.

I thought these were wonderful!!! I normally hate brussel sprouts. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5  is because they were too salty. I will add much less salt next time. I did do what another reviewer did and halved then and cut out the bitter parts. What I really loved when they roasted on the baking sheet small leaves feel off and they were so crunchy and yummy. reminded me of flashed fried spinach. My husband brought he leftovers to lunch and he had people raving abot them also and asking for the recipe. SO whoever posted this thanks and I can't believe I'll mbe adding brussle sprouts to the menu more often.

When I was a kid I hated brussels sprouts, but I LOVED these!!  I made about 1/2 the recipe for the two of us.  I didn't use nearly as much oil, maybe  1/2 T. and that was plenty.  Lots of course salt and seasoned pepper.  And I also added a clove of minced garlic.  I roasted mine for about 35 minutes, shaking the pan every 10 minutes.  WONDERFUL!!

This is my favorite recipe for brussel sprouts also.  The only thing I do differently is that I halve them and then prepare them as above, rounded side down on baking sheet.  Delicious!!!

I can't remember how I stumbled upon this recipe, but I sure am glad I did!  This is is one of the easiest and tastiest recipes I've found in a long time.  JAQATAC is correct - they taste a bit sweet and salty at the same time!  I honestly think I could eat the entire dish in one sitting.  They're that good.  (I have 4 pounds of them roasting in the oven as we speak, because they've been requested for a family get-together!)  Throw all the misconceptions about Brussels sprouts out the window and give this recipe a try.  This certainly puts the frozen Brussels sprouts to shame.

I have made this only once and was dissappointed.  My sprouts burnt in the oven and I followed the recipe to the "T".  I will try one more time before I kick the recipe.  I hope they are better the second time around because I love sprouts.

I thought this was awesome, but my family prefers them boiled or steamed with butter and lemon.  I like this way much better, and since my family wouldn't eat much, I got to enjoy almost the whole dish by myself - yummy!

I really liked this.  Cut back on the oil a little because I am watching my diet.  These are great cold the next day too.

These are amazing! I cut them in 1/2 and added garlic as they roasted. Let me just say I really don't like brussel sprouts but only 1/4 of them made it to the table because I secretly ate the rest!

These are just wonderful... a bit of kosher salt and it really is a great side dish. You get crisp from the leaves, and a lovely buttery taste from the centers.

So good! I'll be making this all the time. I had no idea Brussels Sprouts could taste good.  I used more olive oil than the recipe calls for. I also added 2 cloves of garlic, and probably should have cut down the salt becuase of that. But my goodness, this is a new favorite for me!

Very good!  I also added some fresh chopped garlic that I had left from the main dish, but that was the only change I made. My boyfriend loved them, too--even though he "can't stand" Brussels Sprouts.  I used the leftovers as a salad topper for my lunch the next day--very filling!

These are very good. I added 1 clove of minced garlic to the bag and a sprinkle of parm cheese. I cut the bigger sprouts in half as suggested and timmed them for 20min. They were not done so I would roast them the full time but maybe half the bigger ones if you don't like that creamy middle. Everyone said they were great (even those who normally do not like sprouts).

I make these at least once a week. Best to use baby brussels, they only take 30 min or so.  Shaking the sprouts with oil s&p in a bag helps keep oil quantity down.

thanks JAQATAC, this was a great way to try these for the first time.  I was going to roast them with other veggies, but ran out of time so I just did the brussel sprouts and I'm glad I did, it gave me the chance to just taste this wonderful veggie alone. Next time I'm going to try it with frozen and see they come out just as good.

I have never had brussel sprouts in my life but I'm trying to eat more veg so I decided to try them. I really liked them although I burnt the alitttle after about 25 mins. For the ones that did not burn I would have given them 5 stars but my husband din't like them at all, and the cooking time was way to long.

So simple and sooooooo delicious!  If the Brussels sprouts are large, I like to cut them in half.  The longer you roast them the better.  They get all dark and carmelized.  So yummy!

These are very simple, but I love them. This is absolutely my favorite way to eat brussles sprouts. I've even left them in a bit longer, and they've gotten brown and crispy on the outside and stayed soft inside. Could almost satisfy your fried food craving.

This is my favorite way to prepare brussels sprouts!  Even my boyfriend ate them and he supposively doesn't like them.  I only shook the pan 2x during cooking and i didn't  get any burning.  Thanks for the recipe, I use it quite often.

Awesome! For my first time ever eating brussels sprouts these were terrific! The leaves that fall off turn into crunchy yummy chips. I'm going to make a batch like this to see if my 2 & 3 yr old will eat them.

These are the best brussels sprouts ever! Not bitter at all, for those of you that were worried about that. They melt in your mouth, absolutely delicious. I do roast them longer, but only because the dark brown parts are the very best part, and I like them to all taste like the very best part! I have added garlic, both fresh and powder, and they're also delicious that way too! I have some in the oven right now, and I can't wait to eat 'em. Enjoy!!!

These were great brussel sprouts.  My children even loved them and they were even better the next day cold!

It is a good way to have carmelized brussel sprouts but need to make some adjustments.  I slice mine in half and roast cut side down and cook for 20 min at 350 or until dark brown.  I've also prepared this in a frying pan with the same results.

I have never been a big fan of brussels sprouts.  This recipe has quickly changed that!  I made them for Thanksgiving and there were no left overs.  I did remove the chokes to keep them from being bitter, and used a little Garlic and Herb seasoning.  They were delicious.

These were easy and a good way to use brussel sprouts from the farmers market.  Not spectacular, but good, will make again.

I have always been a bit leery of brussel sprouts...since it was the holiday season, I decided to give them a shot. We parboiled the brussel sprouts after removing any yellowish or loose leaves for 2 minutes, tossed them in a ziploc with the rest of ingredients and then onto a cookie sheet. Added some chopped garlic to them as well. Cooked 25 minutes at 400 F. Tasted good and my husband who loves brussel sprouts said these were the best he'd ever had!

These were a very delicious way to cook brussel sprouts. The outsides were a little crunchy but the insides were soft and delicious. Baking these made the house smell really good too!

I love these.  I make them the same way, except I cut them in half and put them cut side down on a cookie sheet.  I even throw the leaves that come off after cutting them on the sheet too.  They get crispy.   I made these for my bf who hated brussel sprouts...he loves them now!

Like some others, I halved my brussel sprouts and cut off the bottoms.  I also cooked mine at 375 for half an hour.  This recipe is super delicious.

This was okay but I didn't get the WOW factor others seemed to. Next time I would use a variety of veggies and definitly cut the sprouts in half so they get tender.

Perfect! I love brussels sprouts but my husband isn't too fond of them. I've been trying for quite some time to find a brussels sprouts receipt he likes. This is it! He actually cleaned his plate.   I kept a good eye on the sprouts to make sure they weren't getting too dark, but also added a splash of water every so often to keep them moist. That really seemed to help.  Will definitely make this again - thanks for posting it. Sometimes the most simple recipes are the best!

I have never had brussels sprouts before (my family never liked them) but this recipe was simple and fantastic!  I want to eat these all of the time.  Letting them brown gave them a sort of steak-ish flavor with a delicious buttery center.  I just threw a bag of the frozen sprouts on a pan and mixed some chopped garlic and the oil/salt on the pan with my hands and mixed them up every few minutes as the directions state.  I even cooked mine for less time (I just wanted some browned parts, not completely blackened).  Perfect!

I was looking for a recipe with brussel sprouts without using butter - since I'm trying to cut down on unnecessary fat (and in the past I would drown my sprouts in butter and salt).  Found this and love it.  I really like the crispy leaves.  I added 3 cloves of minced garlic - and it was a good addition.

Trust me, 5 star ratings do not come easily from me, but this dish was perfect.  I served them for Easter and they were a huge hit.  I couldn't stop popping then in my mouth.  Even my picky daughhter ate her entire serving, which is a true triumph for me.  I really liked the leaves that fell off the sprouts and got a little burnt and crunchy...so good!  I think the recipe with directions and cooking times was perfect.

These are delicious! I thought that with the basic ingredients these would taste like plain old brussels sprouts, but the roasting really brings out a wonderful flavor! Thanks for sharing a new way to make them.

YUMMY!! I followed the directions exactly the first time I tried this recipe. It was awesome! The second time I added some grape tomatoes becuase they were just sitting the fridge. This was a GREAT addition. PS...I never liked brussel sprouts until this recipe! Thanks!

I love brussels sprouts, but these just didn't do it for me. I was so excited to try this recipe because of all of the rave reviews, but was sadly disappointed. They were just okay. A little bitter as well.

Don't cook for 45 min, this only took about 15-20 min to cook.  Use less salt...(I used sea salt instead of kosher.

These are awesome!  I used a bag of frozen brussels sprouts and boiled them on the stove for about 5 minutes.  I cut the fat by spraying the cookie sheet with cooking spray and then spraying again after I put the brussels sprouts on the cookie sheet.  I put salt and pepper on them and put them in the oven.  Delicious and so healthy!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were good, but nothing to cry home about. I liked that they didn't smell while they were cooking. The flavor is lacking something.

Fantastic!  I am a huge fan of brussel sprouts and usually eat them with balsalmic vinegar and olive oil on them, but these were awesome!  Very simple. I did par-boil them a minute or two before, then roasted them 20-25 minutes.  Thank you for this simple, yet wonderful recipe!

Pretty darn good.  I cook these in an electric skillet, which allows the shell to get crispy, while the insides are soft.  Delicious.

I love this recipe for sprouts. I sometimes mix it up a little by adding balsamic vinegar in with the oil. Excellent taste! Even the finicky eaters have their share. Also, you can easily speed the cookingtime by partially steaming the sprouts prior to dressing them and popping them in the oven.

I followed the one review and boiled the sprouts 2 minutes prior to cooking. i added about a half teaspoon of minced galric and a splash of lemon juice. These are actually good hot and even better the next day.  An A+

Our whole family enjoyed these!  When prepping, save the little leaves that fall off and cook them with the rest.  That was our 5 year old's favorite part because they become crispy little 'chips.'

Excellent method for brussels sprouts.  I also have made green beans and asparagus using this hight-heat roasting technique and it adds sweetness to anything.  YUM!  I followed others' suggestions and halved most of my sprouts.  These were delish.

I make these all the time. I roast them at a much higher temperature though about 450. I drizzle olive oil on them and sprinkle them with garlic powder (fresh garlic burns at such a high temp)onion powder, salt, and pepper. These are awesome. The time does vary quite a lot though. It depends on if you use fresh ones or frozen and the size. Right now fresh ones are too expensive so I use frozen ones.

The sprouts were okay - a bit too much pepper for our tastes. But they weren't anything to write home about, and I won't be making them again.

Excellent.  Cooked exactly as directions states.  Even my husband who eats no vegetables tried and liked.  These were also good heated up the next day. *update* sprinkle with balsamic vinegar before eating very yummy!

Roasted veggies are always my favorite... Brussel Sprouts are no exception.  The only thing I would do differently is to slice each sprout in half.  I find the flavors are a bit more intense with the salt, pepper, and oil penetrating the many layers of the sprout, in addition to decreasing the cooking time. Sometimes the best recipes are also the simplest as is the case with this.  Roast away!

This recipe was AWESOME!  I only cooked 9 sprouts to try this so it only took about 20 minutes to cook.  After the first 20 minutes, I turned off the heat and let them sit in the oven another 10 minutes, shaking the baking sheet every 5 minutes.  The entire household loved them.

How can something so simple be THIS good??  It's like eating candy.  I don't even like brussel sprouts but its all I had for dinner tonight.  Just kept popping them in my mouth.  Be sure to toss them like the directions say - that's important.  YUM YUM!

Very good.  I accidentally gave the incorrect rating for this recipe in place of the one for a different brussels sprouts dish.  This is a WONDERFUL recipe and one that I followed exactly.  It met with raves and a demand to go back to the kitchen and make some more!
It is a good meal on its own as well as being an unusual way to present a side dish.  I recommend it to anyone who likes sprouts and bleu cheese!

These turned out great! Roasting veggies just gives them a fantastic flavor. I didn't have kosher salt on hand so I used the same measurements in sea salt & it turned out just fine. However, I should have followed the other reviewer's suggestions and blanched them in boiling water for a couple minutes as the brussels sprouts are a tad bitter. Great recipe to make ahead and just reheat in the oven for a party! I cannot believe my family actually ate them!!!

One of my favorite veggie dishes.  After I trim the ends, I slice in half.  Just toss in olive oil, pop in the oven and roast along with your main dish (meat).

So good!! DH wanted Brussels sprouts for so long, and bought some, then had me hop on here to find a recipe. I picked this one because we had everything and it was super easy. They turned out great, even though I forgot to shake the pan/turn them. =( But they were really good!

Served these at Thanksgiving for 14 people - everyone loved them, even my husband, a confirmed brussels sprouts hater! They were a little salty to my taste, but I don't add much salt - everyone else thought the salt was fine. Since time was short, I added 1/2 tsp. powdered garlic to the bag before shaking instead of fresh minced garlic - turned out great.

This recipe was really good! I used this on Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit, everyone could not get enough of it.  I used this recipe on green beans as well and they also turned out wonderfully, except they do not need to roast as long, so keep an eye on them.

Very tasty.  I cut some of them in half and left others whole to compare the two, and I can't decide what I like best.  I did add garlic and wish I hadn't used quite so much (two cloves).  I tried drizzling with a little balsamic after cooking, and think that next time I'll add it before roasting. It would probably caramelize beautifully.

Surprisingly good!  We don't care much for brussel sprouts, but this is a great way to get hubby to eat them.  The charred skins are very tasty.  Thanks!

Makes for tasty sprouts!  Halved the sprouts because they were large, which caused them to cook much quicker and become a bit crispy (I like them that way, though others may not).  I think 30 min. is definitely sufficient.  I also added in some garlic powder into the mixture.  Didn't have kosher salt, but table salt seemed to do the trick.

DELICIOUS!!!  So simple to make and wonderful too!  I used frozen brussel sprouts and salt and granulated garlic.  I cooked for about 40 minutes and it was super.  This is the way I'm going to have them from now on ~ I highly recommend trying this :)

WOW! Excellent recipe. I left the sprouts in for the whole 45 minutes and they turned out crunchy and soft on the inside. I used fresh ones and next time I will try with frozen and see how they taste. When I trimmed them, I made sure to leave most of the ends intact so, the leaves wouldn't fall apart. Thanks, for a great recipe!

These are excellent.  My new favorite way to make brussel sprouts.  I followed the recipe exactly, but since I had large brussel sprouts I cut them all in half.  I will make these again for sure.  Thanks!!

This is a good, quick and easy recipe.  I followed the direction of other reviewers and set the temperature at 375.  Next time I won't leave the brussel sprouts in for very long because I don't like the flavor when they get dark brown.

I pretty much HATED brussel sprouts until I tried this recipe!  Now that I've found this recipe, I have to have them at least once a week, and my family is lucky if any are left to serve at meal time (they usually get thinned out by the cook before they make it)!  As an other user suggested, I cut them in half first to cut down on cooking time.  Highly recommended!

If a few leaves come loose while you're trimming, shake and bake them with the rest!  If you've ever had the Crispy Spinach at China Grill in NYC, they become the brussels sprouts version. hummm...

Boiling for a few minutes worked great and it only took about 25 minutes to roast.  

And all the stuff you could add!  Prosciutto
Pine nuts
Balsamic vinegar
Parmesan
Garlic halves (add 7-10 min before finishing the roast)

YUM!  My husband says a dollop of butter would have been better (what isn't better with butter???:), but we both enjoyed them as a very simple and healthy side dish.  I used a bag of frozen b/s, and microwaved them til they were thawed but not hot, then added the other stuff and roasted for a little less time.  We ate them with the French Chicken in Vinegar with Pepper Spiked Polenta.  The chicken wasn't as good as the entire meal...or the sprouts.  We'll make the sprouts alot for many different meals in the future.

I started a diet and could eat many different kinds of vegetables, so I thought I'd try brussels sprouts (for the very first time) and not knowing how to make them I came here to look up recipes and found this one - and WHAT A DELICIOUS RECIPE!!! The darker the sprouts are the better they taste - they are even good as left overs! I will DEFINITELY make these again!

I added minced garlic to the olive oil.This was a nice change from steamed brussels sprouts! This reminded me of fried cabbage. I like how the roasting took away the bitter edge that brussels sprouts tend to have.

My family is definitely NOT vege eaters!  My daughter saw brussel sprouts at farmers market and asked if we could try them.  I had never eaten them and never wanted to.  My husband thought they were horrible.  I bought them becaused she asked and browsed for a recipe.  AMAZINGLY they were good!  I added garlic as some suggested.  Next time I will use a tad less salt and let them get a bit more black.  I think the secret is to let them get black.  I have found a new vegetable for my family.  THANK YOU.

LOVED this - I made it with frozen brussel sprouts, added garlic and also placed fresh carrots on the baking dish - I am in heaven!

WOW! Cut an X in bases of larger sprouts then waited patiently for them to char. Great and simple!

These things were surprisingly tasty!  I was shocked when my husband (who doesn't like to eat veggies) suggested that we try brussels sprouts.  I tried this one since it was so simple and easy, and they turned out GREAT.  Pleasantly surprised!  I cut my sprouts in half so that they cook faster and I get more of the yummy charring.

Words cannot express just how much I loathed Brussel Sprouts. Having made this dish yesterday, I can't say I'm a convert, but they were at least edible. Thanks.

I haven't had brussel sprouts in many years, and my husband said he used to gag on them.  But he went back for more!  Very good, made just as instructed.  Now, if only my little ones agreed...

For brussels sprouts, this is a great recipe.  I actually enjoy them.  I did eye ball the salt instead of being more exact and they were a bit salty so next time I'm actually going to pull out a teaspoon to be sure.

Six stars.  I use frozen, and I crave this at times and can eat almost a whole bag for dinner with nothing else.  If you sort of like brussels sprouts, you will love them this way.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and all of us brussel sprout lovers were in heaven. I had my mom try it who does not like brussel sprouts and she didn't like them so that didn't change like it did for other non brussel sprout lovers but they they were a 5 star to me! Yummy!

As a kid brussel sprouts was maybe a once-a-year disguise with some cream or cheese kinda dish.  Now I love simple steamed brussel sprouts once or twice a week!  However, this simple roasting meathod could get adults and kids alike to eat sprouts everyday!

This is my favorite way to prepare brussel sprouts. Do not be dismayed if some of the leaves turn black and crispy - these are little, salty treats-like a brussel sprout chip!

Possibly the best recipe I've ever found on allrecipes.com, and I've tried a lot of them! I never thought I'd be addicted to a vegetable, but I'm hooked! This is my new absolute favorite way to eat brussel sprouts. I'm not sure I can ever go back to my old recipes again!

These are delicious. My 9 yr old daughter who hated Brussels sprouts before absolutely loves them prepared this way. If you like dice some garlic and add it to the Brussels sprouts when roasting....either way they are delicious.

Very good. I added freshly ground black pepper and cayenne pepper (my boyfriend and I like spicy foods) and kept to the recipe.  It was very good, the center was creamy.  I used frozen brussel sprouts, but I made sure to steam them for 5 minutes prior to following the recipe.  I didn't need to cut them in half as they appear to shrink somewhat during the cooking process.  Also, I'm a huge fan of the toaster oven and used that--they were very, very good!

I recieved brussels sprouts in my organic veg box and wasn't sure what to do with them. I'm was not a big fan but I am now. They are fantastic and soooo easy. I added some fresh lemon juice. I also cut them in half for quicker roasting. I suggest letting them get nice and brown. When you think they are done, give them a minute more.

5 stars for both ease and flavor.  What makes it even easier is to line the baking dish with parchment paper.  No cleanup!

Very nice. I used frozen sprouts so next time I will use fresh. A true test is if my husband likes them (he always whines when we have sprouts) and he said they were pretty good. The caramelized bits are a nice surprise. Can't wait for the summer when I can throw them in the grill pan on the BBQ

Who knew??  I always avoided brussel sprouts as the one veggie I really didn't like.  These were awesome!  One of my daughters, took a look at the burnt crispy edges and sighed and said "why couldn't you just boil them" (she likes them like that - bluck...LOL). Then took a bite, her face lit up and she declared them "awesome"!

Who would have thunk it....a really great way to prepare sprouts. I don't mind them boiled, but this will certainly be the way I prepare them from now on. The roasting brings out flavors we've never experienced previously. Followed recipe exactly, and it's so easy to prepare. Thanks so much jaqatac!

These were amazing!!!  My husband typically wont eat brussel sprouts unless they are covered in cheese sauce.  But he tried these and loved them.  I will never make brussel sprouts any other way.  One tip:  I cut the sprouts in half and this decreases the amount of time it takes for them to cook by almost half.  Definitely let them get a little dark - adds to the flavor.

I used frozen (thawed) brussels sprouts because of availability. They cooked well with the potatoes I roasted with them (cooked for about 40 min). Reheated with no problem. Will make again.

Delicious!  I don't particulary care for brussels sprouts, but I thought these were wonderful.  Roasting with the kosher salt gave them lots of nutty flavor.  Even my skeptical husband, who prefers his sprouts boiled (blech) devoured them.  I'll def. make these again.

Ehhh.. they were just okay.  And, that's coming from the number one fan of brussels sprouts!  I was expecting to be 'wowed', but sorry to say, no wow factor here.  I like brussels sprouts done on my George Foreman grill far better.

GREAT recipe for brussel sprouts! Thanks for sharing. Delicious the way the recipe calls for, but I think next time I might add some more seasonings like garlic and onion powder in with the salt and pepper.

Love this recipe!  So simple to make and so good - almost crispy on the outside and soft and yummy inside.  The only change I made is to add some garlic powder to the oil and seasonings.  Will make this again and again.

After making these with Hawaiian spareribs, I will never make boiled broccoli again.  These brussels sprouts were absolutely awesome.  I've decided that roasting is going to be my new hobby.  I'm going to roast every veggie I can get my hands on.  Yum yum yum.

I had slightly less than the 1.5 lbs of brussel sprouts called for but didn't decrease the other ingredients.  They were tasty but a bit too salty.  I also sliced the larger sprouts in half and that worked well.

Pretty good.  Definitely the only way brussel sprouts should be served.  I also tossed in baby carrots & red onion with the brussel sprouts.  It is was really tasty & colorful with the 2 other vegetables added.

My husband and I do not like brussel sprouts and we both actually enjoyed these. Very good. during cooking, some outer leaves fell off and browned. These were crunchy and tasty; a nice complement to the dish.

Works exactly as instructions read, a rarity. Truly a healthy and delicious way to enjoy brussels sprouts! Excellent. I'd add that it works best with smaller brussels sprouts - the outer leaves have the flavor and they often come off when attempting to bite or cut the sprout. Bite sized sprouts are better!

I added garlic. I'm not sure what the point was of specifically using Kosher salt. I feel it was a waste of money to have bought a box just for this recipe. I'm not a big fan of over-cooked potato chips, but I do see why folks said the brussels sprouts were like chips. These were just okay. I never would have thought to roast brussels sprouts so it was a nice change. My husband liked them well enough, but my son and I only got through them by dipping them in ranch dressing.

I was amazed at how good these are! Brussel Sprouts are not a big favorite in our house, but these have won everyone over. I doubt I will make them any other way. Really, Really good. Thanks for the post.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  These are crispy on the outside, soft and almost creamy on the inside, and a nice blend of salty/sweet.  I like  "Caramelized Brussels Sprouts with Pistachios" (from this site) a bit better, but that recipe is more work than this one.  Thanks for the recipe!

I asked my sister-in-law what her favorite veggie was and she said brussel sprouts. Well I had no idea how to prepare this vegetable so I came to allrecipes.com. I read the recipe to my s-i-l and she said it sounded good. So I figured she would be the only one eating these so I only made half the recipe. Well that was a huge mistake!! Everyone in the family was eating these things as if they were popcorn. There was not one brussel sprout left. I highly recommend this recipe. I even ate a few!!

Amazing. Simply Amazing. I cannot do this dish justice by describing it in words, except to say that I will definitely be making this again (soon). I cannot *stand* brussel sprouts, but started a new kick today to try veggies that I previously did not like, one of which were BS. This recipe definitely made me a BS convert!!! Don't read anymore - just make these! I can't stop eating 'em :)

These were fantastic!  We like brussel sprouts to begin with, but one reviewer was right, sort of salty, sweet, like potato chips....had vinegar on the table for those who wanted it. Yum

This is the perfect way to cook brussels sprouts - sweet and caramelized on the outside, tender on the inside.  I'll never steam them again!

I love brussels sprouts any way, shape, or form, but this takes them to a new level.  Really other than steamed or boiled, what is there to do with them?  I must also say that I had some brussels sprouts that most folks would have tossed in the garbage.  The leaves had yellowed, and I'm sure they would have been too unappetizing if steamed.  It's true, the browner, the better. The outside leaves kind of tasted like potato chips.  lol  That salty, crunchy taste was delicious, yet they are so creamy soft and sweet on the inside.  I used a little less EVOO and they were fine.  Just remember to shake every 5 min or so.  I didn't bother putting them in a bag.  Just threw them in the pan, added the salt and fresh cracked pepper, drizzled with the EVOO and shook them around to coat.  Couldn't be any easier to make and I could eat them like popcorn!  (or potato chips)  Thanks for this great recipe.

I just recently started eating brussel sprouts because hubby loves them and this is the second recipe I tried. The first one was pretty good, but these are delicious! I served them along side stuffed pork loin chops and received rave reviews!
I do think I over cooked them just a little, as I took the midpoint on cook time. My oven has a mind of its own so at times it's hard to judge! 
I initially contemplated adding some garlic or other seasonings but am glad I didn't. This recipe was great just as is!
This has definatly earned a spot in our favorite recipe file!

This is the only way I make brussel sprouts. Sometimes, if I am in a time crunch, I put them under the broiler (just be careful to go sparingly on the olive oil) instead of in the oven. In the broiler, it only takes 10 minutes at most. Also, near the end of the cooking time, I throw some pine nuts in with them. This toasts the pine nuts nicely and adds a nice extra nutty flavor.

I love Brussels Sprouts any way they can be made!  Made these for Thanksgiving and they were delicious!  Didn't have Kosher salt, so I used regular table salt and should have cut back a little, they were a little salty.  I think with the larger grain salt they would have been better.  But everyone loved them!

Made these for our Thanksgiving family potluck and they were delicious, but did make a few changes, combining them with another roasted brussel sprouts recipe I found in WW magazine. I added a chopped onion, and ended up using more olive oil than called for to prevent them from getting too dry. My other recipe suggested adding some chicken broth to keep them moist, which I'll try next time to keep the oil content down. They took at least the full 45 mins, and I did end up turning the heat down some. It is vital to stir them often, but they roasted nicely on my Pampered Chef stoneware pan -- no sticking at all. The onion was a nice addition as it carmelized along with the brussel sprouts. All in all, turned out great --not pretty, but had a wonderful smoky, mild sweetness, much more mellow than simply steaming or boiling them. They were a big hit, esp. w/my husband. Will definitely make them again.

These were so delicious.  Brown and crispy on the outside yet soft and scrumptious on the inside.  I don't think I will eat brussels sprouts any other way after trying this recipe.

Breathtaking brussles sprouts! Even hummy (who don't eat brussles sprouts) love to eat these brussles sprouts. I cook the brussles sprouts for a long long time (1h15m) to make nice & krispi.. Sometime I cut bussle in half & sprinkle curry powder to. Simply unbelivable!!!!

I found out that I don't like Brussel sprouts very much, but it isn't this recipe's fault.  The outer few layers were delish, and I peeled and ate them all, but I nor my husband could take the middle part of the sprout.  But if I liked Brussel sprouts, I can say this would've been very good.

I overcooked mine and they turned black but were still delicious.  You can peel off the dark leaves, and it's still tender insdie. I ate my charred pieces though, and it was great!  Thanks for the simple but delicious take on brussel sprouts!!

Wonderful!  I'm sure this is the most healthy brussels sprouts recipe that I have cooked since you pour nothing down the drain.  Great leftover food.  Next time will "blacken" a bit more.

Didn't convert my 14 year old, but she eats lima's, broccoli, and peas so I don't complain!

I used the wrong kind of salt I guess.  I used sea salt and found these too salty for me.  If I took off the outer leaf tho' it was great.  I just hung out by the oven and ate and ate!!  I want to try them again with a bit of garlic instead.

Very easy and a different option to serving them, more flavor then steaming them.  My mom dosen't like Brussel Sprouts and had me make green beans for her but she tasted the brussel sprouts and said they were great.

This is a truly wonderful recipe.  Why weren't they prepared this way when I was growing up?!  Much better than the traditional boiled sprouts.  I am a garlic lover, so I toss mine with minced garlic and sesame seeds before I bake them.  Try them... you'll like them!

I grew up hating brussels sprouts, but Oh Mama!!! These don't taste like brussels sprouts. These are delicious. I could eat them every week. Happily husband and sons don't like them, so more for me!!! ;-)

I was surprised I didn't enjoy this recipe more. All the amazing reviews were very misleading. I love sprouts but not this way. Very easy to make but not to easy to love.

Loved this. I like sprouts anyway but this took the cake! Like everyone else I couldn't get enough. Once I ran out and went and bought more and I am cooking them right now. Just as good cold!

Only tried this recipe because of the other positive reviews. Everyone was correct - I didn't make them dark brown at first - eased my way into it.
Crave these just like others said!
Keep thinking I'll try another recipe for brussel sprouts but never do!!

I couldn't stand brussel sprouts---until this recipe. These are soooo yummy. I cooked them until they were golden brown and they were crunchy and sweet on the outside nice and soft on the inside. I ate the whole pound myself!! I plan to use this recipe again and again!.

My kids flipped over these! Such a nice change from the usual steamed sprouts and we loved the fact that they were all black and crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside. Thanks for a great recipe!

I must admit I was surprised at this recipe  I am an admitted "sprout lover" but I wasn't prepared for the unusual flavor of these.  I loved them.  I couldn't stop eating them.  I kept going back to the fridge to grab 1 or 2 to snack on.  The rest of the family looked at them and turned their noses up (they are not the most attractive side dish!)....all the better because I had them all to myself.  I ate the whole 1-1/2 lbs within 24 hours.

This is a good recipe for sprouts lovers, but not likely to win converts among people who don't like sprouts to begin with.  I'd recommend removing the browned outer leaves before serving this dish (an extra step not mentioned in the recipe) because it's not an attractive dish otherwise and those burned leaves make the sprouts taste charred.

Pretty good. Not nearly as life-altering as I'd hoped based on the reviews of other - they still definitely taste like brussels sprouts. I tried this one hoping to show my boyfriend that brussels sprouts can be good, but it didn't fly for him.  I liked them though.

I just made these. They were fantastic and I've never had brussel sprouts before! I only made a few as a test and I don't think I roasted them long enough but they were still great. I will definately make this again very, very soon.

This was great ! We bought some fresh brussel sprouts at our local Farmers Market. I made them for dinner two nights in a row. My husband loved them too. I am going to share this recipe with friends and family. As a rule Brussel sprouts are kind of boring, not any longer..

Very good. I might try to experiment with more seasoning, but the simple salt and pepper was good.  They do look a little scary when they're done, so I wouldn't try to convince a sprouts-phobe to try them (my husband foolishly left them all for me!).

I was making brats for my son for dinner and I made the brussels sprouts, along with seasoned fries, as the sides for my son. The fries called for a 450 oven for 30 mins total, so I put the brussels sprouts on the lower rack and the fries on the upper rack. The sheet pan for the fries protected the sprouts from becoming burned, although there were a few charred pieces, which adds so much to the yumminess of this recipe. My 17-yr-old son ate them up! I made the recipe exactly (except for the temperature) and added a little garlic powder, too. So good!

This is the second time I tried this recipe. The brussel sprouts are overcooked but otherwise very tasty. In this era of planetary disasters waiting to happen, I swamped the ziplock bag for a large bowl. Just add the same ingredients and toss the sprouts around a little. The end result is the same and you won't have a dirty single use plastic bag that can only be put in the landfill! Please try this and change the recipe to eliminate the plastic bag! Thank you

This dish was fabulous!!!  I tossed the sprouts with the oil, salt and pepper and put them directly in an enameled cast iron pan to roast. I really like to char the sprouts so I didn't stir them during cook time. The flavor was amazing.  I cooked for 45 which was a little too long because they were a bit on the mushy side. Next time I'll do 35 minutes.

What is it with blackened vegetables? Roasting only seems to work well with certain veg, have never managed edible sprouts or broccoli. Detest the burnt flavor.

Excellent! As written. I've avoided these for nearly all of my life. This recipe is terrific as written or add a little garlic & herb seasoning. I leave the brussel sprouts dry before tossing them with the olive oil, salt & pepper. I also cut them in half.

absolutely horrible.   Burnt and nasty.  Cant get taste out of my mouth.  I love Brussels sprouts, I should have went with my gut.  I knew this was going to over cook and burn them but I wanted to try the recipe as it calls for.   HORRIBLE!!!!!!

There are more environmentally friendly ways to mix up the ingredients than using a plastic bag. I recommend a recipe edit to swap out the plastic bag step for another alternative.

Give it a try, even if you don't particularly care for brussel sprouts! This recipe was delicious and foolproof. I didn't have much time so I only had about 25 mins to roast them (but I actually preferred it this way over the charred option).  Even my 9 yr old son loved them.. I am making them again tonite!

I roasted a mix of sprouts and potatoes.  I used a Tuscan seasoning to the salt and pepper.  Use a good olive oil.  Sprinkle with finely chopped Italian parsley.

I found this recipe a few years ago and have made it often ever since...I LOVE LOVE LOVE these little jewels when they come out of the oven!  They are great hot but also really yummy right out of the fridge!  I always make enough to have some leftover  just for me, that I can snack on the next day when no one else is around!

Good flavor overall, but still pretty strong-tasting for someone who doesn’t like brussel sprouts much.  Cooked exactly as directed. Very tender & very easy to fix.

I've been making sprouts this way since I ran across the recipe a few years ago and have so loved how the sprouts come out

Last night I had some leftover smoked, nova style salmon that I needed to use up. I took small slices of the salmon and rolled them and tucked them between the sprouts, this was done after I prepared the sprouts with the oil, salt and pepper. Popped it all in the oven and roasted per the recipe instructions.  Was so totally awesome.

So easy!  The best way to prepare and enjoy Brussels sprouts.
I cut them in half.  I put them into the oven at 325 degrees on top rack as I had 2 other dishes in the oven.  They were cooked perfectly in about 45 minutes.

400° is too hot for olive oil! The smoking point for olive oil is about 350°+, so cook this lower or use a different oil.

Great, however, unless you want them to be Chernobyl Sprouts you gonna need to back off on that 45 minutes at 400F!  It only takes 20 to 25 minutes to get them to a nice toasty brown and well done condition.  Changes I made in addition to the time at temp was to slice them in half and add some parmesan cheese after coating them with EVO and some melted butter.  They are a great side dish with steaks, crab cakes, you name it.

We love Brussels sprouts. This did nothing for my family. I didn’t like the charred taste on the outside and really didn’t like the mushy interior. It would have been fine if the cook time was cut in half.

I've tried them substituting different oils, once with truffle oil and once with walnut oil. I like them both. They add an earthy taste to the sprouts.

I made this last night, more or less exactly as specified. It was simple, as advertised, but also very good. I disagree with the critical comment that claimed it yields over cooked sprouts. I think they were perfect. But maybe go on the low end of the cooking time, just to be sure. 
I wish I had taken a picture because they looked as good as they tasted.

I added 2 tsp ground Ginger root and 1/2 tsp minced Garlic and only 1/2 the salt.  Also I used 2 frozen 12 oz bags of brussel sprouts thawed and increased baking time by 15 mins. Went great with our Thanksgiving Ham. This is a Great recipe.

I love, love, love roasted veggies of any kind. These are especially good. I had larger ones, cut them in half and only cooked them about 20+ minutes. No mushy middle that some complained about.  I plan to make these an after dinner snack in place of chips.

I fried up some bacon for breakfast and instead of roasting olive oil I used the bacon grease, and some chopped onion,  I crumbled up the bacon and put it on the sprout as soon as they come out of the oven since it was cooked in the morning. yummy side dish!

Cut the sprouts in half. Cut the salt to one third of what the recipe called for, and the pepper to half. I liked the result. Cooked it less time than this recipe called for.

Loved this recipe.  My husband recently had quintuple bypass surgery & must be on a heart healthy diet.  I used salt-free seasoning & fresh pepper-delicious!  Also added a tiny amount of balsamic vinegar.  Definitely a keeper!

Love these! I roast for only 30 minutes and that seems to be about right.  I also halve them - unless they are really small to begin with.  Confession - I love eating them cold out of the refrigerator the next day!

Yes! This was REALLY good and exactly what I was looking for. My mom use to make something similar growing up and I’ve been trying to find a recipe that was a replica. This tastes just like it! It is cheesy deliciousness!! I remember my mom use to put crushed cornflakes on top so I did the same and it gave it a nice crunch. I went by the video which suggested doing 1/2 Mayo and 1/2 sour cream. Next time I’ll omit the salt. The other ingredients had enough and it was slightly too salty. Other than that, this one is a keeper!!

I made and it is delicious. Everyone I serve it to loves it. You can spritz some balsamic vinigar on it before serving, or  I like  to put mix them with quinua or cool them and mix them in a green salad.

Excellent.  My sprouts were kind of small so 45 minutes may have been too long to cook,  I love them charred though.  If you don't , start checking after 25 minutes.  Absolutely delicious!

I just made these and I love them!! I did boil them a little beforehand for quicker oven time since I didn’t have that much time on my hands. They turned out so well! Crispy and salty on the outside, softer (but not mushy) and a hint of sweet on the inside. Flavors complement each other so well!!

I typically sauté brussel sprouts and wasn’t sure I’d like roasting them but they turned out delicious.  A very easy and quick way to make my favorite veggie!

This is how I’ve been preparing brussel sprouts for a few years. I first had them prepared like this at a friends restaurant and thought they were excellent. As others have mentioned, I also add a little minced garlic to mine and I will occasionally sprinkle with fresh grated Parmesan cheese as soon as they are out of the oven.

This recipe is a delicious addition to any meal!  My family loves brussel sprouts.  I did not have fresh brussel sprouts so I used organic frozen brussel sprouts.  I would not advise using frozen sprouts in this recipe.  It was very soggy.  I can't wait for some fresh brussel sprouts to be back in season!

This has become our favorite veggie.    We do par boil or microwave for 1-2 minutes before roasting for 20 minutes.   We usually finish with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar

These are AMAZING!! They are the ONLY way any of my family (including myself) will eat Brussels sprouts. I do find that using frozen instead of fresh cuts cooking time way down and they are much more tender. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Simply roasted brussel sprouts are the best but this time I tossed the sprouts in browned butter (with a touch of lemon juice) after roasting. Lovely flavor, no leftovers!

I used sea salt and also sprinkled on a little garlic salt.  I forgot the pine nuts at first, and sprinkled them on 1/2 way through the baking time.  I left them in for 50 minutes, and they were pretty crispy… almost looked burnt.  But.. it turned out GREAT!!  My husband even had 2nd helpings, and he doesn't like brussel sprouts!

These are amazing! I made them exactly as the recipe states. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. My husband hated Brussels sprouts until now, but he loves these.  I can never have leftovers! Even my picky 14 year old daughter who balks at almost all green food likes them! Thank you for sharing!

I don’t know what people were saying about it coming out mushy and burnt. I cooked them at 400 for 31 minutes and shook them around about 15 minutes in and they turned out perfect. Also I threw some chopped onion coated in oil and did what another reviewer suggested and sprinkled minced garlic over the top. They came out Just a little golden brown but not too much and the texture was amazing not too crunchy and not mushy at all. Thanks for this great recipe

I did not have the Brussels covered the first 8 min and then when got it out of the oven noticed it looked very dry. I covered with the foil and baked covered for the rest of the time. I removed it out of the oven a couple of more times to shake it up for even coating. It cooked through with slightly darkened  spots on the sides just like it shows on the picture. The taste was amazing!

my husband SWORE he was going to HATE them! Flat out refused to eat them! He said they were gross and they stink. Hes only had them once in his life and they were boiled. I tried to tell him this would be a different experience, I received an adamant and emphatic NO. So I did what any wife would do.... I gave him the silent treatment lol. He fixed his own plate and to my surprise, it had roasted brussel sprouts on it. The next day I asked him what did he think? He tried his best to hide that smirk, but it peaked out anyway and he admitted that he really liked them! Wife 1, husband 0. Needless to say, this will be on the menu from now on lol

First time I have ever roasted  brussels sprouts. Cooked them for my parents who cannot have salt so I substituted California pepper (from Penzey's) for the herbs. Cut them in half but only cut off the hard end. Cooked them at the recommended temp but they were done in about 20 minutes. So good! Nutty and naturally sweet - my folks loved them and there were none left over.

I added garlic, rosemary and paprika to the mix. The brussel sprouts came out spectacular. They had a slight crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. A great dish for appetizers. Very delicious

I didn't make any changes and were loved how they turned out! My favorite thing about this recipe is how quick and easy it is to prepare! The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly and the simplicity of only 3 ingredients allows you to. actually taste and enjoy the flavor of the sprouts! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

To make this dish was obvious when making Brussels sprouts in the oven, but I made it just a little bit better. I added one other ingredient - peeled, and sliced organic chestnuts. The aroma during this time of year, fall and winter, is a welcoming one. I also added a bit (2 cloves) of minced garlic.

Followed directions with the additional suggestions of adding minced garlic. They're ok. Nothing special. Certainly not worth the 5 stars so many gave the recipe.

I made it as stated - knowing that I always screw up brussel sprouts. We had a divided opinion. I didn't like it, had an odd bitter after-flavor - and my other half loved it. I'm going to leave this one as a split decision.

I make these every Christmas and my family loves them!! Every now and then I will soak the sprouts in some red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar for a few hours to kick up the taste and very often I use butter instead of olive oil to get a richer flavor, however you do it roasting sprouts is the best!!!

Followed directions, except added 1 Tbs. of Tony's Spice and Herb seasoning and 2 Tbs. of minced garlic to the bag seems shook vigorously, then baked for 35 minutes. This turned out so yummy!! My husband, son, and I ate every bite and my son usually hates brussel sprouts.

I did not know how simple this would be.  Thanks Allrecipes for the help in finding new and wonderful recipes.  After years of getting the magazine, and saving dozens of recipes on line, I'm truly enjoying actually cooking.  Never would have found many of them, if not for Allrecipes.  Thanks, WascallyE

My family loved this and roasting brings out such good flavors.  I made this as written, but would also add a bit of garlic next time and sprinkle with grated parmesan or romano cheese just before removing from the oven.  Also, I did cut the larger ones in half to make sure they all cooked evenly.

I am glad I read the reviews. I roasted them at 425 for 15 minutes and shook the pan a couple of times. I also added some garlic salt they turned out very well :) Perfect combo of crunch

So easy to make and very tasty! My brussel sprouts were small so I left them whole. Had they been larger I MAY have halved them. I didn't find them mushy at all. Oven temps vary, convection,  or non-convection, and times vary. I did mine at 375 for 20 mins.

I've made a similar version except I also take a couple yams , peel them, and then cube into 1/2" cubes.  Cut the sprouts in half and toss both in EVO spread out on baking sheet, sprinkle with kosher salt and cracked black pepper.  Bake at 400 for 20-30 min

I made this recipe using fresh brussel sprouts and I trimmed off the ends and took off the ugly parts of the lettuce. I put it in a gallon bag with some kosher salt, pepper and roasted garlic and let it sit for about an hour or two then I slapped it in an 9 by 13 pan at 400 degrees added a little bit more kosher salt and cooked it / recipe. It came out perfect tasty we loved it we are spicy people so we added cayenne pepper while the Sprout's were resting in the bag waiting to be roasted. They turned out perfect this is a great recipe and it's in my favorites so I know that we will be using it again and again. Thank you very much!

I had some cauliflower that needed to be used so threw that in too.  While it was cooking I thought it smelled awful so pulled it out and let it cool for a minute then tasted a small piece and could not stop eating it.

Will definitely make again although I need to dial in the oven time. I removed the stems and parboiled for 3 mins first. Then cooked for about 25 mins on 350, 15 mins on 400 due to having multiple dishes in the oven at the same time. They still weren't perfectly crispy like I would have liked, but that was due more to my impatience and having the rest of the meal ready to go.

I have made these several times and they have always been good. Roasting times vary with the size of the sprouts and the pan used...just watch them and use your judgment.

I add a different vegetable with the Brussels sprouts each time. Almost always sweet potatoes, sometimes radishes, cauliflower, apples or tomatoes, raisins, walnuts - the combinations are endless.

They had to cook longer than I had expected so they were not done at the same time as my meal but when they were cooked....delicious!   We really enjoyed them!

We liked them so much that  this will be a side dish for Thanksgiving this year!

I've never eaten or cooked Brussels Sprouts until I saw this recipe and decided to try something new.  I LOVED IT!   I've now made this dish 3 times as a side dish to my meals and save the rest for snacking or reheat for the next day's meal.  Try it you'll like it!  I promise!  Yum!

I will definitely make this recipe again and again.  I noticed I was losing a lot of goodness in my Ziploc bag, so I started using a bowl.  That way I can drizzle what's left in the bowl over my Brussels sprouts before they go in the oven.

Made exactly except that I had some chopped garlic left over from another recipe so I added it. Lip-smacking good! Thanks for this simple treat! I didn't shake the pan; I used a long plastic serving utensil (silicon would be better) to stir every five minutes, because I used my lower oven, and shaking the pan was just not easy for me.

Delicious! However, next time I will either only cook for 30m at 400 degrees or 45m at 375. 45m at 400 charred them too much. Otherwise - easy and delicious, perfect combo~

4 Stars because it needs some garlic and herb seasoning. I get my garlic and herb seasoning from a (somewhat) local Amish community store. However, Mrs. Dash would be a fine substitute.

This is so easy to make.  And delicious.  I didn't have Kosher salt, so I used regular salt, and by accident put in too much.  Also, I sprinkled garlic on the sprouts before roasting them.  They were really good, but next time I'll use less salt and wil use fresh minced garlic.

This is a great easy side dish! My husband and I love brussel sprouts and we’re excited to try this! It did not disappoint. Great texture (not mushy) and the flavor was great. My hubs really liked the crispy outer leaf chips.

I find this recipe to be just right.  I added cubed potatoes and a sprinkle of garlic powder.  They were fork-tender at 35 minutes.

Way too salty! I had bought HUGE Brussel Sprouts (each one the size of your palm) found this recipe and decided to give it a shot. I quartered them and put them in the bag with the oil, S&P and some garlic. Cooked them for about 30 minutes. When I read to shake them every 5-7 minutes I was flabbergasted! That's not easy, especially with my particular health problems. So I just turned them about 3 times. I did taste the sweet and salty right off - but the salty was overpowering. I may try again with a lot less salt and some parmesan cheese as was suggested on here. Also might try the 425 for 15 minutes as also was suggested.

I love brussels sprouts...hence the 5 stars.  I made the recipe with 1 tblsp of olive oil for 1# of brussels sprouts; then used an EVOO spray for a little extra coating, some ground sea salt and no pepper.  Were fine for me as I didn't want all the extra oil. Yum!  Also, roasted the discarded leaves as another person mentioned; loved the crunchy bits.  After roasting for about 35 minutes at 400 degrees (in my toaster oven!) I squeezed some lemon on top.  I will definitely be making these again, easy and tasty.

Amazing! Love when the outside is black and burned and the inside is soft, tender, and moist. Substitute with toasted sesame seed oil though. It'll give it greater flavor. Also am thinking about soaking it in water, or at least putting a really thin layer of water at the bottom of the tray, so the brussel sprouts won't be as dry.

As a child I hated brussel sprouts. My mother either boiled or burnt everything we ate... As an adult, I was recently introduced to this style of making them.... I love them.

This was my first time making sprouts and they turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly. They did turn out a bit too salty for me. Maybe next time I will cut the salt in half.

These were absolutely delicious. I picked up Brussel sprouts because they looked fresh and wonderful at the grocery store and got home and found this recipe. Amazing! Didn’t know they could taste this good. Thank you!

turned out yummy.... I used frozen bag of sprouts. Just opened bag, poured in olive oil, sprinkled some garlic salt and pepper, and shake, shake, shake. Then poured out on to baking pan. Spaced them out because if they are to close they will steam and turn mushy. While in oven I turned them every few min so the sides could crisp. And voila!  serve... to a happy family.

Delish!  Preheated oven to 425. I cut off the stems and  halved them to cut down the cook time. To kick up the flavor I added 3 fresh garlic cloves, and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  Baked for 18 mins. Will make again!

I'd never had Brussels sprouts in my life until recently. I can only assume my parents/grandparents didn't like them, but I like them very much! This is the first recipe I tried and it was pretty good! Sometimes simple is best! I cut them in half and roasted them at the called for temp for 30 minutes and they were just barely too overdone for me. I like the char, but this was a bit too much. Maybe 25 min? I don't want to have to monkey with the temp during cooking. After they came out I thought they lacked something so I added a touch of lemon pepper. I will be making these again.

My family loved these, however, I did add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter to the olive oil, some dried onion flakes and about 1 teaspoon of sugar..so they caramelized a little bit. Yum!

Tasted over-cooked and slightly burned, probably only needs to bake for half of the time.  I can imagine that it would be a delicious recipe if roasted for only 20 or so minutes.

I made 2 eight ounce bags of roasted brussels sprouts tonight, the first bag to try, and to see how the family liked them.  We ALL liked them, my 12 yr old son even exclaiming to his friends gaming on-line,  " my dad made a vegetable that I finally really like"!
Easy to make, and not a lot of ingredients to screw up, LOL !

This is the best way to make them!! I did make one change...I love garlic ..so I added 4-5 garlic cloves, that I used my garlic press with, into the ziplock bag. My kids absolutely love these and actually ask for me to make them! The sea salt is a must!

we really loved this but made some major changes like others did.. baked the brussels sprouts (which we halved) for 15 minutes at 425.. and subbed bacon fat for olive oil.. definitely not low in calories but it was very tasty.. ty for the beginning of a delicious side dish

My husband didn't think he liked brussell sprouts but now I think we have both found a new side dish! They turned out pretty good, although I will be making a few minor changes next time.

These are so good and super easy to make. Like a deliciously healthy snack. Next time I am going to try sprinkling a little balsamic vinegar on them before I take them out the oven.

I made this, added only 1/2 tsp fresh minced garlic, cooked as directed, it was very good.  All the whiners who dumped on this recipe seem snobbish or picky eaters or both.

I had about 1 pound of sprouts, and cut back the oil to 2 T.  I should have cut the salt back. I did end up roasting for 30 minutes, but start checking at 15 minutes. 

I HATED Brussel Sprouts as a kid. My mom would boil them to tasteless mush. Roasted, they taste like veggie candy. You can try roasting lots of other veggies. Just add oil, S&P.

A simple, yet very tasty recipe. I used my own garlic infused olive oil, salt, freshly ground pepper and a little mango balsemic vinigar drizzled over the top, then toss gently until well coated. Then roast per directions. A great side dish, and even my daughter, who doesnt like brussels sprouts, loved them!  The mango balsemic adds just a hint of sweetness to the wonderful taste of this vegitable...

My family already loves roasted brussel sprouts but this recipe is so easy, I'll make them more often.  My only change is that I split the sprouts in half and blanched them in hot salty water before roasting. It takes away the strong smell and makes them tender.  The cooking time was the same.

I made this recipe as a healthy option for Thanksgiving. I though it was pretty good but didn't get much positive feedback from others at the table. The flavor was a tad bitter still, but enjoyed the blackened crispy edges. Maybe I need to just tweak the recipe a little.

This recipe was really good! The first time I made it it was perfect! The second time it came out too bland and in my opinion a bit too burnt. Ironically, the second time I followed the directions better, and it turned out, in my opinion, worse. The one thing that I changed in both of them was that I coated the brussels sprouts with the olive oil and salt and pepper with a brush instead of throwing them all in the bag and mixing them that way, and they turned out fine. It was a lot less messy too!

Loved it!!! Only ever had Brussels sprouts one other time and hated them. This recipe popped up on the main feed and I thought they looked so yummy!! I saw the high reviews and just had to give it a try. Well my husband and I both loved them and can’t wait to make again. Followed the recipe exactly and mine turned out browned in spots and the loose leaves that had fallen off were blackened. Loooved the crispy black leaves! Idk why people complain and say this is too long to cook them. Mine weren’t completely brown or black. They were perfectly roasted. Will make many times!

Loved these! I had a bag of frozen brussels sprouts and looked at the instructions on how to cook them. I always do the same thing, stovetop, so I thought I'd try the oven roasting. Mine were already in the oven when I came across this recipe, and it's the same! I just added garlic powder with the salt and pepper. I probably roasted them for about 35-40 min to get the nice browning. SO delicious this way! I like to have them with a little good quality balsamic vinegar on the side. This may just be my new favorite way of cooking brussels sprouts!

Easy to make. I sliced these in half (long way) before seasoning.  This allowed more of the moisture from inside the vegetable to escape and help with crossing. Adding garlic and onion to the seasoning also added nice flavor. 

Even the teenagers went back for seconds!

I was hoping this would help me like brussels sprouts, but it turns out they still taste like brussels sprouts--and I still don't like them. These were edible, but also seemed too salty. If I were to make this again I would cut the salt to 3/4 tsp, but I'll probably try something else instead.

I cut them in half and roasted on a foil-lined sheet.  Loved the idea of shaking them in a resealable plastic bag to coat.

I’ve had roasted sprouts before and liked them, but these were better!  I’m sure it was the plastic bag massage that made the difference. Like kale chips they benefited from having the oil, salt and pepper eased into the leaves, and a split sprout has all those wonderful nooks and crannies. It didn’t take mine quite as long as suggested here to get them to that crunchy dark brown crispness, but like anything else, you just have to watch them as you do the turning. And they really ARE better when they get that dark.

OK I made this just as the recipe described. I love steamed Brussel Sprouts and thought I tried this as something different. I cooked the sprouts in the oven until they had a brownish almost slightly burnt look as some of the pictures look. The sprouts were cooked, a little squishy , which I didn't mind. But I think the sprouts were over-cooked according to the recipe. If I tried this over again I would par-boil first then brown a little in the oven. Some people commented on making the sprouts turn black, I'd didn't like it that well done.

I would make this again although I would change up my seasoning a bit. I'd like to see it with some onion, garlic and maybe a few herbs. I would also caution anyone making this not to go too far on the salt and pepper before cooking. Both turned out too strong for me. I had upped the salt but not the pepper. I'm glad I didn't up the pepper. It would have been inedible.

My SIL is doing low carb so I made this and it is addictively yummy - more like a chip than a veggie. Even my veggie averse hubby loved it. I believe it is the kosher salt that knocks it out of the park.

Fantastic! I did add some garlic like many other posters, and I took if from 425 to 350 for about 10 min in the middle. The garlic has a tendency to burn...

This was the 3rd time in my life ever eating brussel sprouts and the 1st time making them. They were so easy to make and sooo good! My husband loved them as well! I didn't measure how much salt I put on there, but I may have added just a pinch more than the recipe called for. It really all just depends on your taste.

I was very skeptical. I've eaten one Brussels sprout in my life and thought I was going to die before I got it chewed enough to swallow. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating slightly. I started out by only using a half pound. Still used the same amount of olive oil and seasoned to taste with pink himalayan salt and pepper. I didn't have kosher salt and I'm not fond of it. Convection baked at 375°for 10 minutes then turned the sprouts over. (I halved the larger ones before baking also) then baked for another 5 minutes and sampled one. I think I might just like them now. I'm personally not fond of the burnt taste of the leaves that had fallen off so I didn't bake the sprouts any longer. I posted a pic for reference. The sprouts have a nice dark brownness where they lay on the pan. The inside is not mushy but is tender. There is that sweetness all are posting about and nutty flavor. A slight cabbage flavor but not prominently noticeable. So, all in all, I am glad I tried this. I believe everyone has their own liking of doneness. If you're trying this for the first time, start small. Taste the sprouts as they're cooking. You be the judge on when there done. After all, YOU are the one eating them & know what you or your family likes. Like many have done, I am going to try different seasonings & maybe some parmesan.

I made these exactly as per the recipe. I made them the day before Thanksgiving so I could reheat them with sweet potatos for dinner the next day.  OMG, they were the worst tasting things I have ever made....I was so embarrassed, and thankful I'd made lots of sweet potatos too!  The sprouts were bitter and the dark brown outsides were tough!  I won't be making these again.

If I could give this zero stars I would.  They tasted horrible!!  I cooked it for a dinner party, and all my guests had to throw it out.  I will stick with my normal recipe that includes bacon.

This is always a huge hit at family gatherings.  Dad cannot have added salt so I substitute Garlic and Herb seasoning and it's delicious. People can add their own salt if desired but everyone loves it as prepared for dad.

This is good just as it is. But for variety, I tried adding subbing garlic salt for the salt, a cup of chopped green onions and a teaspoon of dried thyme. That was good too.

Excessive salt. Next time I'll use less, but they do caramel nicely with the olive oil toss.

I did not make any changes. The brussel sprouts were amazing! My husband and very picky sons loved them. I was barely able to put them in a serving dish before 1/2 were eaten right off the pan. I was going to submit a picture on the pan, but had to take one in a bowl because there wasn't enough left to photograph.

I halved them then par boiled them with the kosher salt for 7 minutes. Shocked them in cold water. Next I shook the oil, pepper and a touch more of kosher salt mixture with the sprouts. Finally, put them on a cookie sheet and placing in a preheated oven at 425 for 20 minutes.
I've never had this vegetable and I plan on keeping this recipe with my changes of course.

A new holiday feast staple. It was tough to move away from our traditional sprouts in lemon pepper butter but nothing ventured, nothing gained
I cut them in half and that worked well.  Popped them in the oven when I pulled the turkey so the timing works well (like to wrap the bird and let it sit for an hour). I wanted to add a sprinkle of lemon juice but forgot. Next time. Everyone loved them. Great recipe. Thanx

I've made this a couple of times before  and its always a big hit.  I made a big dish of these and by the time I got to them there were only 2 left. The only thing I did was reduce the heat to 375 because I had other dishes that needed to be roasted at the same time. The temperature was perfect and the sprouts browned nicely all over.  I'll never do them any other way again.  Great recipe.

These were fantastic! My wife was a skeptic. She loves BS, but never this way. She ended up eating all the leftovers!

Two tweaks... leave out the salt, it's doesn't need it. And I added some minced garlic, a heaping teaspoon, to the mix. Added a nice zest!

I roasted for 15 minutes at 410 since I think my oven is a little slow, and then flipped them over and roasted for another 10 mins. At that time they were dark brown on two sides and a knife slipped easily into the center. No black spots and not as evenly browned as turning every five minutes but sure tasted good!

I thought the cooking time was too long. However I did cut my brussels sprouts in half to make them easier for eating. I would've stopped cooking these after about 20 minutes maybe less. I cooked them for 30 the way she suggested, and they were a little mushy on the inside.

SUPER easy recipe that is very flavorful. I'd suggest cutting the sprouts in half for slightly faster cook times (also, the oil gets down into the nooks and crannies this way...delicious). I do cook at a lower temp (350) for this reason. I will also adjust the time depending on how many I'm cooking. Basically, start the "poke" test after 15-20 minutes (everyone has their own preferred level of doneness).

I will make this again and again! The texture and flavor with the browning and crispy leaves that fell off while turning were perfect. I think I may have taken them out a little before the suggested time because  I had cut them in half in hopes of reducing the cooking time.

This was a really nice way to make brussel sprouts. My husband had bad experiences with them as a child and swore he wouldn't like them but he had to admit that they actually tasted good. I was hesitant to try this recipe at first because there are so few ingredients that I didn't know how it could possibly make them taste good but I was surprised. These are lovely! Thank you for the recipe. It will make us eat these little guys more often.

Loved this recipe.   Brussels sprouts are my new go to veggie.  I've been tinkering with this recipe - cut the Brussels sprouts in half and only roasted for about half an hour.  Let them cool and added them to salads.  Seriously beefs up a salad.  I keep a container in the fridge for my fam to snack on.

I split the difference between 30 and 45 minutes and roasted for 38 minutes at 400 degrees, The center of the sprouts was mush. I'd cut it to 25-35 minutes.

Very tasty.  Halved the sprouts.  Needed a little more seasoning - might try a little garlic salt/pepper next time.

Made these for last night's dinner, and they were great! I did the mixture, popped them in the oven for 15 minutes, flipped them and did another 15, and then pulled the brussel sprouts out, added a bit of Parmesan cheese (1/4 cup) on top, and then put it back in for another 5 minutes to let the cheese melt. My dad loves brussel sprouts and these blew him away!!I tweaked the recipe by adding a bit of red pepper and more black pepper, along with the Parmesan cheese. However next time, will replace kosher salt with sea salt, it was a little salty for my taste.

My oven is hot...so these were as dark as I'd want them in the end...but after 10 minutes.  Turned it down to 400 and by the end, the centers were too mushy.  I prefer them roasted and dark but still a little crisp.  Hot and short...someone else suggested 425 for 15 minutes and I'm gonna try that next.

Yum!  I never used to like brussels sprouts, but I'm coming around the more I try them. This was a very simple way to prepare them.  I hate mushy vegetables, so I took the advice of someone who said to roast at 425 for 15 minutes. That sounded about right to me, and it was!  I noticed that the smaller sprouts were perfection all the way through while the larger ones were more firm in the middle. In the future I'd try to buy them of a more uniform size, though it wasn't that big a problem. I used a good quality olive oil and a coarse sea salt, which gave them a nice little crunch here and there.

This was absolutely the best way to cook Brussel Sprouts  in my opinion. Have a daughter who absolutely loves Brussel sprouts and I've been looking for the best way to prepare them. I removed the loose leaves and the stem, tossed them in the olive oil, seasoned and baked. Did not turn them as suggested and they seemed to roast evenly.
Big hit and my new way to cook this vegetable.

This was super easy and delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I thought it was a bit too salty for my taste.  I will definitely be making this again, but I will cut the amount of salt to a 1/2 tsp.

I've baked Brussels sprouts before, just winging it. Since this recipe sounded easy, I determined to try it.  However, since some prior efforts resulted in what looked like charcoal briquettes, reducing the temp 25 degrees seemed wise. Turned out great! What I need to do now is figure a way to cook bacon at the same time and infuse the sprouts with that great flavor

I do not like brussel sprouts, but my husband does. However,  this recipe has changed my mind. Followed it as written. I did change the serving amount as I wasn't sure if I would like them so that put my cooking time off a little. Two thumbs up from hubby.  Definitely will make again.

This is awesome, but I didn't roast them that long.  If you want them quicker, saute them in butter cut in half til they are as brown as you like them. Salt and pepper to taste. Yum!

This recipe was so simple and the sprouts came out very tasty.  I cut mine in half like someone else mentioned in their review just to get more of the seasoning on more of the sprout.  They looked and tasted even better than when I had them like this at Red Lobster last summer.

Wasn't as flavorful as I expected.  The blackened outer leaves tasted burned.

This recipe is very yummy. I add some additional seasonings (garlic powder, lemon pepper) and cut them in half to prevent mushy insides. I cook them at 375 until they begin to brown (about 30 min) and then crank up the heat for a few minutes to get them a little crisper.

These turned out perfect. The only thing extra was I soaked the Brussels sprouts in cold water for an hour beforehand. I also added lots of garlic. We love garlic. Otherwise followed the recipe and they were great!

Just made it cut them in half and the only extra thing I added was red chili flakes and it was great.  Maybe next time I'll add some garlic.

I have not had brussel sprouts for probably 60 years. They are good for, so decided we had to try. This recipe looked promising. It was okay. I cut them in half, roasted for about thirty minutes. Just okay. I might make these again, but will also keep looking.

Definitely a new favorite.  I halved the sprouts, didn't trim up the bottoms, brushed the bottom of the pan with olive oil as well and put the face down.  With them halved, it cut back on the roasting time - I did 20 minutes at 400 and turned it up to 425 for 5-10 minutes.

I made this for the first time today, but it won't be the  last. I made it with some other reviewers suggestions. I halved the sprouts and added garlic powder and baked at a lower temp (375) for 30 mins as they were small both in size and number. Absolutely delicious. Fresh Brussels sprouts will be a staple in my house from now on.

I followed the recipe, which is pretty straightforward, but my sprouts were very charred.  I will use this method again but probably turn down the temp to 375.

Yum, yum, yum!    I didn't like Brussels Sprouts until recently, and this was my first attempt at making them for myself.   They were so good --- I just kept eating them!   I followed the recipe but did not have kosher salt, so I used a combination of table salt and canning salt.  Still very good!   I cooked them in my toaster oven somewhere between 375 and 400 degrees for 30 minutes and they were perfect.  Will make these again!

Cut them in half. And, I read somewhere that if you remove the "choke" that's at the bottom of the sprout (inside), the brussel sprout will not be bitter.

These turned out perfect! I followed the recipe. Since I was using a countertop convection oven, I had to reduce the heat down to 350 pretty quick, and they reached the desired deep brown color in about 35 minutes. The recipe does say to reduce the heat as needed, so I don't think of that as a change. Even my husband, who dislikes vegetables as a rule, admitted that he never thought he would ever say he liked Brussels Sprouts, but after trying this dish he enjoyed it!

I'm not a huge brussel sprout person but decided to give this a try, and I loved them. They were a huge hit and didn't last very long. I took the suggestion to add some garlic and it added a great flavour. I left them whole and cooked them at 375 for about 25mins. Shaking them every 5 mins or so. They were still a bit crunchy but yet soft. Oh and to the person that said to leave the little leaves in that fall off....that was a great call. People were fighting to get the little crispy leaves. I will definitely make these again.

The whole family loved this side dish. I made mine with carrots at 400 for 15-20 mins. It was so Yum! You can substitute avocado oil or the olive oil if on the Paleo diet or just cause. Just as yummy!

Added spice de Provencal to the mix and will definitely make it again.  It was a hit with my non-vegetable loving kids!

Very good, but just a little too salty. Then next time, I will cut the salt and possibly the pepper in half.

Update: I cut the salt in half the very next day and these were amazing!

I looked at several recipes for Brussels sprouts before choosing this one, I chose well!  They were amazing! Perfectly cooked and the brownest crunchy leaves were the best.  The only thing I changed was adding pine nuts to the pan, just because I had some and thought they might be a good addition.  They were also delish, but the sprouts didn't need any help. Thanks for the awesome recipe.  I converted 3 twenty-somethings who had never tried them into fans!

excellent. I cut the brussel sprouts in 1/2 so they would cook a little quicker.

Awesome.....but 6 Brussel sprouts wasn't nearly enough especially if they are small.  I made 24 and doubled the butter and garlic. The wife and I easily devoured 12 each.  The garlic is the magic ingredient in this dish.  Delicious.

I was never a huge fan of brussel sprouts but this was straight up easy and delicious. Replacing kale chips as my new healthy snack, satisfying both salty and sweet.

I make this dish all the time! My family fights over who gets the last serving. Like others, the key to the flavor is fresh crushed garlic! Don't leave that out. Also, the more they brown the tastier they are. Enjoy!!!

The original cooking time was a bit long for me (I halved the sprouts), so they were a bit soft, but I will certainly do this again and shorten the cooking time.

Made it for our Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it. I added a little cranberry pear balsamic vinegar just for fun, and it was a lovely addition. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Safe to say, there were no leftovers!

Great alternative to boring, traditional boiled brussel sprouts. Added a squeeze of lemon but otherwise kept it as simple as it is.

Brown sprouts taste really bad . The cooking time on this is way of. I love sprouts but they need to be lovely and green. I agree with Corrina. Follow the suggestion of roasting  for 15  minutes. Garlic is good as well but only if you like garlic of course.

Pretty good - but the times are way off. I only cooked for 20 minutes tops, and they were tender, almost mushy in the middle. Would be better with some flavor like balsamic vinegar.

Simple and delicious.  I added minced garlic in addition to the other seasonings and roasted for 25 minutes.  They were cooked but not browned.  My family prefers them green.

A big bone of contention to the folks putting these recipes together. I HATE plastic bags and those who use them for one use and then throw into the landfill. How about placing everything into a large mixing bowl and then TOSS gently! I've read numerous recipes and they ALL suggest using a "sealable plastic bag" to mix the ingredients. Please, just use a mixing bowl! OR keep ONE plastic bag in a drawer JUST for this purpose.

I made a half cookie sheet of the brussels sprouts & the other half with carrots.  I mixed both veggies with EVOO, salt & pepper on the pan, plus added a generous amount of minced garlic.  I kept each vegetable on separate sides of the pan but baked the two together.  I cooked them 25 minutes when they were tender and roasted so the brussels sprouts were dark on the outside.  I will be making this recipe again, thanks.

This was great!  Little salty for me but good overall.  I reduced the salt and used roasted garlic infused olive oil the second time.  Tweeked to my taste, I loved it.

I never liked brussel sprouts until I tried this recipe.  I've made it several times mostly as a side dish during the holidays and occasionally I add chopped garlic when I have it

Loved these! Cut them in half and cut out the stem part. Put in ziplock back smith Kosher salt and olive oil and shake. Place on sheet flat side down and cook per recipe. These were fantastic!

These were fine.  I had hoped for a brussels sprout recipe that would turn me into a sprout lover, but no.   On a good note, there was none of the smell while roasting that I normally get with steaming.

Tried this tonight since my oven was already cooking something at 400°. They came out great, very tasty. Would like to sprinkle seasoning on them, but can't decide what I'd use. I cut them in half, too.

So delicious!!!  I have been wanting to make roasted brussel sprouts for a few years now and this Thanksgiving I finally did it.  I used very expensive extra virgin olive oil, kosher salt, and Italian seasonings.  When finished, they have a slightly sweet, nutty, and slightly salty taste.  Very different taste than when they are steamed.  The brussel sprouts turned out so good that my daughter asked me to roast a second batch that she would take in her "care package" back to university.  Do not deprive yourselves.  Make this recipe!

This are really yummy. However, I found 30-45 minutes to be entirely too long. I think mine were done after about 20 minutes. And even a few were just a bit too dark. You MUST keep and eye on these little guys. I will definitely be making these again.

Will never understand why some reviewers give 5 stars to a recipe after changing it. That said, this recipe is a good place to start. Roasting  them at 425 degrees for 15-to-20 minutes (depending on size) is plenty of time. Also, because we enjoy fresh ground salt and pepper after food is cooked, the salt and pepper was reduced to 1/4 teaspoon each. Yummy!

These were fabulous! I cooked the small leaves as another reviewer suggested and am I ever glad I did. They were almost the best part! I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make again. Thanks for a new incredible way to cook Brussel sprouts!

My family really liked these brussels sprouts.  I followed advice and cut them in half and placed cut side down on the baking sheet and turned them over after a few minutes.  We love sprouts and these are especially good.  Give them a try.

This is requested at the family Thanksgiving dinner ever since I added something 'green' as a side dish several years ago. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese at the end of cooking one year, but everyone agreed, just roast per the instructions is the way to go.

I used 6 chicken breasts. I doubled the marinade, added 3 garlic cloves minced, 1 Tbsp Italian Seasoning, 1 Tbsp Adobo seasoning. Grilled them on high 3 minutes, flipped and turned down to medium for 4 minutes.

Honestly, they did not turn out as yummy as I thought they would. Seasoning was great but the cook method was not my favorite. I have only cooked these one other way,  the Laura Vitale way. If you follow her instructions to the "T" you will not be disappointed!

Super easy & really delicious.  You can add different spices for different tastes.  I cooked them a little less than the time listed so they weren't quite so crispy (but I like crispy)!

Yum - very popular with the kids!  Our were done in about 30 minutes.  Increased heat to 425 the last 10 minutes, as it was baking with something else, and that was probably a bad idea as they blackened much more quickly once the heat went up, and I wasn't watching them closely.  400 the entire time is probably the way to go.  Try sea salt or kosher next time, as I just used regular, and that flavor kind of got lost.

450 F for15-20 min., or broil them to your liking. I don't like them blackened, just crisp.

I just put the sprouts in a pan along with olive oil and bake.  You do have to move them around every 7-10 minutes or so.  They come out great.  I don't use any salt, pepper, etc.

I quartered the brussells sprouts, to enjoy more roasted goodness!  I HATE brussells sprouts... I thought!  These are totally yummy!   I did add more salt when done (as recipe states)... finishing touch!

Delicious! I used butter instead of olive oil and added 1/3 cup of sliced onion and it turned out beautifully!  I roasted my spouts for 40 minutes.  Next time I would probably cut back the cooking time to 30-35 minutes.  They didn't seem too overcooked, but I think they would be more tender if cooked a bit less.

This has quickly become one of my favorite side dish recipes. It's easy, fast, and healthy...but mostly, delicious! I have never really considered brussel sprouts  much of a side, but now I buy them every time I get a chance because of this recipe!

I am no chef. After reading the reviews I added  a garlic clove and pinch of brown sugar. My husband and young daughter both stated this is their "new favorite!" I cooked at 425 for 5 minutes and 400 for 15. They were soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. I have to say they are my "new fave". Thank you to the original chef who shared this fantastic recipe and made it easy for me to add something healthy to our meal.

I added tiny pieces of garlic and a squeeze of fresh lemon. I roasted them at 375 for half an hour on a strip of foil. They looked just like the ones pictured -- nicely browned but not burned. The amount of salt required in the recipe is a bit much, I think. Oddly, I missed the sweet taste mentioned by others. I felt a bit of sugar might have enhanced the dish. I will not make them again because my husband ( who has never liked brussel sprouts) hated them.

I ended up making this for a dinner party and ended up using previously frozen sprouts.  I thawed them out and cooked them according to the directions given and they turned out wonderfully.

My wife at all the leftovers as a snack, so I was kind of bummed about that.

The sprouts will get nice and dark and crispy on the outside, almost a little bit caramelized. The insides are juicy and tender. 

I added onion powder and garlic powder for more flavor.

This recipe convinced me that Brussels Sprouts aren't that bad after all!  Thought I'd give them one more try before declaring them as a food I don't like and this recipe won me over.

Super fast prep and such an easy recipe.  I find that soaking the Brussels sprouts in lightly salted water for about 30 minutes prior to seasoning and baking keeps the sprouts from drying out in the oven.  Great recipe and this is one a staple in our household!

I did not care for this recipe. They were dry, chewy and/or burned and bitter. We're going to keep looking for a method for preparing them.

Brussel sprouts aren't usually a thing at our house, but this simple dish was very pleasing. I was unfortunately and suprisingly unable to find fresh brussel sprouts at my local grocery store, so I had no other choice but to use frozen and they were still great. I would have liked to halve them so the insides would brown too, but as they were frozen solid I didn't bother. As soon as I can get my hands on some fresh ones I'm making this delicious dish again.

I was skeptical. So few ingredients and such good reviews? These are amazing. I have now also done the exact thing with cabbage and potatoes(cut like friench fires) and they are equally amazing.

We are lucky enough to live in a town that closes two blocks of Main Street every Sunday  ten months of each year for the local farmers market. You get to hand pick your own product before purchasing . This recipe is a snap when the sprouts are all the same size and shape. Buying bagged produce is a -shoot....Frozen is marginally better. As for this recipe, I do cut the sprouts in half and shake the pan every five minutes or so until the y reach desired degree of blackness is reached. Otherwise I pretty much follow this recipe.

One of my kids favorite vegetable side dish. I'd made as is and it overbrowned by the time it was cooked through.
I started then parboiling the Brussels sprouts for couple of minutes and cutting the big ones in half. And I only roast for 20 minutes, stirring  after the 1st 10 minutes.

This was a very good recipe for sprouts. I remember eating them as a kid and loving them, but I don't know how mom made them. This was a very good replacement. The only change I made was replacing some of the oil for bacon grease. It just add that bit of flavor especially since I pared it with ham. Everyone loved them and that is a feat. I will make this again, and more often!

I cut the sprouts in half and threw in the loose leaves. Some were still bitter but wow, sprouts made this way are so much better. My husband even tasted it and said "This is not as bad as I thought." I may try cutting out the core as other reviewers mentioned to cut down the bitterness.

If the main course require a different oven temperature, you can make the Brussels sprouts ahead of time, bake them for 40 minutes and then warm them in the microwave when the main dish was ready.

If you're not sure you like brussel sprouts you will definitely want to try this recipe.  If you do like brussel sprouts, you will LOVE them cooked this way.  
I didn't change a thing and they were so very easy to roast.

Apparently I made this recipe a while back and didn't like it, but I guess I forgot, and I made it again. This time, I was very happy with the results, perhaps because I chopped up some fresh garlic and tossed it on top? That really gave these sprouts a nice flavor. I cooked them for about 35 minutes. They were a bit blackened on the outside and just soft enough in the center. Delicious!

I never thought I would ever love brussels! I'm giving it 5 stars for the method of tossing w/oil and roasting. Depending on taste, add more/less oil, salt, pepper. Depending on size, slice or quarter the sprouts. This is my new fave side dish! (We like things with a bit of char). If you like em steamed- make em that way and don't give a low rating!

This was so easy and really good. I had smaller brussel sprouts and they probably should have cooked for 30 or 35 minutes instead of 40 but they were fine.

I will definitely make these again. The only thing I changed was the amount of brussel sprouts. My local store only sold them by the pound, so I used a pound instead of a pound and a half, but delicious!!

Simple and delicious. In the last 5 minutes of roasting, I added a knob of butter, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a sprinkling of parmesan. Another alternative is to add finely chopped bacon 2 or 3 streaky rashers) and a tablespoon or so of sour cream or creme fraiche.

Great simple recipe!

Edit...
I have made this recipe for my family more than 5 times. Once you put your sprouts into the 1 gallon ziplock bag with oil, sprinkle salt, pepper and lots of  mccormicks Montreal Steak seasoning. Shake and cook for 40 mins. PERFECTION!!!!!!

Super simple and a serving of 4 was eaten by 2! Well 1 1/2 because one party was a 2 year old ?? I made this in a toaster oven on 450 in a glass pan and I think it took about 25 mins.

My husband who has never liked Brussel sprouts in his life loved this recipe and said that he can eat it like this every time. I kept everything the same and added fresh cut garlic to the mix. It was so delicious.

Absolutely delicious!! This was my first time making brussel sprouts so a I was a bit nervous, but they came out perfectly! Salty, sweet, and tender, and the recipe is so easy!  just make sure you get those outer leaves off before, definitely will make this again!

you can do this on a stove top as well. I heat olive oil and throw brussel sprouts in and add 1/4 cup water and put a lid on. When the water is all evaporated, i open the lid and lower the heat and cook through-shaking the pan to prevent sticking or burning.. Done in 15 minutes. Add salt and pepper at the end. ;)

I added sliced onion and garlic, can also cook in a pressure cooker or slow cook or you can slice the brussels sprouts thin and stir fry.

Made a small pan (not everyone is a fan of the Brussel Sprout) of these for Thanksgiving just to keep with family tradition.  I have come to like Brussel Sprouts as an adult and it doesn't get any easier to prepare than this recipe.  And this recipe is not only easy but delicious.  Need to adjust the cook time depending on the volume and your oven temp.  I will definitely make these again.

I am NOT a fan of the brussels sprout! Unless they're roasted and these are amazing! I've made them twice. First time I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful. Second time I experimented and used bacon vinaigrette salad dressing, a little salt, and some black pepper - delish! I think these are my new favorite veg :)

I came into this recipe expecting little, I mean, how much flavor could you really get out of Brussels sprouts.  The first bite though, yum.

Pretty basic and simple. Gave it only four because I actually think this recipe is better if you slice the sprouts in HALF. I made it both ways and the halves were much better since you get more of that brown crunchy yumminess.

my first time enjoying brusssel sprouts!! I've made them several different ways, and always been disapointed. I only cooked them for 30 minutes, and reduced the temp about half way through to prevent them from over browning. Delicious!

I'm not a vegetable eater, so my five star rating is not for myself.    I have never had Brussel sprouts, but love cabbage, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Still don't like them.  But my children, and husband loved them.  The recipe is simple and quick.  I did drizzled the EVOO directly on the sprouts after cutting the sprouts in half and seasoning with Salt, Pepper,and a Sazon Vegetable seasoning packet.  They asked for seconds.  Will have to make this again.

For a simple way to add variety, I used coconut oil in place of the olive oil. It adds a little lightness to the flavor.

The sprouts were way over cooked. I should have taken them out after 20 minutes max. I did 30 and they were mushy.

My fiancé and I haven't had BSs since we were little. He was a little hesitant when I said this would be our side last night. All I had was frozen BSs from Trader Joes, so I soaked them in warm water to thaw and then followed this recipe but added some garlic salt as well. To our surprise, they were really great! I'm excited to try to make them different ways next!

I followed the recipe exactly, but thought they were way too salty. I will make them again using half the salt. I did love the texture of the roasted brussel sprouts, but had to peel the outer part off because of the saltiness.

I've never been a huge fan of sprouts unless my wife cooked them in a pound of bacon - because, bacon. 

I wanted to find some method that would yield edible sprouts without all the fat. I saw this one and the huge amount of ratings and was like, wow, that looks too easy to be that good. Well, guess what - it was  good!

I made sure to cut away most of the base (I heard that makes them bitter) and cut them in half. Also heard not to exclude any of the misc leaves that fell off, that they would make very tasty crunchy bits. Oh boy, did they!

Came out so good, my wife and two young ones (6,7) loved them! I did cook them at 425 for 15 minutes and they were perfect. Also added a few cloves of crushed garlic. So good.  Only giving it a 4 because of the alterations.

I've always resorted to the frozen, steamable kind, because I had no idea what to do with them. I took the advice of others and cut them in half, and they were absolutely perfect. Even my son who won't even look at most vegetables liked them. They are definitely worth a try!

The charred bits on top gave the sprouts a bitter taste. And there was not much of a flavor in the center of the sprouts.

Turned out great. Soft on the inside, charred on the outside. You definitely don't have to add any more salt. The teaspoon is plenty. Might even consider a bit less.

I like to sprinkle lemon juice and some garlic powder on the sprouts prior to roasting. This is a very good and simple recipe! However, I have had better sprouts roasting them at lower temperatures.

I waited until my picky family was out of town to make these, and I am glad I did it! I followed the recipe exactly, and to my taste, they were WAT TOO SALTY. Next time I will salt them when they're done. Very tasty! And it is true what other reviewers say - the burnt leaves are the best!

I have always hated brussel sprouts ever since I was a kid. In an effort to add some healthier recipies to our menu, I forced myself to make this recipe. I was very impressed. Not only was it edible, it was actually delicious. Sure beats the microwave recipe my mom used. Kids even enjoyed them. Will make again often.

These were excellent!!  Prep was super easy and the salt and pepper lended the perfect amount of seasoning!  I used very small sprouts, so I reduced the cooking time to 15 minutes, which ended up being perfect!

I've never eaten a Brussels sprout but I made these for my dad for Xmas dinner.  I did follow another reviewers advice and cored and halved my sprouts. They were really good! Much better than I thought. My mom (who hates them) said it was the best sprout she had ever eaten.

I've had brussels sprouts boiled and roasted, and enjoy both methods. This recipe is very easy to make and we liked them this way. I usually make them when hosting Thanksgiving dinner and there are never any left...and we host for 40 people!

Great flavor! I added 2 cloves fresh minced garlic. Also the meat I was cooking was in at 425 degrees, so I roasted the sprouts for 20 minutes, turning halfway through for even cooking.

I think this is the same way these are prepared at Whole Foods. I often go during lunch and get a half pound of these to eat at my desk at work. When I make them at home, I just cut them in half, spray the bottom of a baking sheet with olive oil cooking spray, then top the sprouts with more spray, and good salt, then bake at like 375 for about 20 minutes. A little lighter with the spray, but either way these are a delicious way to get in something super healthy.

Delicious!  I used a 12 oz package of brussels sprouts and drizzled them with Tuscan herb infused olive oil just enough to lightly coat then sprinkled kosher salt. They only took 20-25 minutes in my convection oven on 350.  Olive oil and salt work like magic to bring out the flavors in vegetables.  I prepare most of my vegetables as above or in a saute pan. Don't overcook - vegetables are best tender but crisp.

I followed this easy recipe except I made ahead and left the sprouts in a baggie with the salt, pepper & oil.  Left them in oven longer and some turned really brown.  My entire family raved about the sprouts and some never would eat them before.  This one is a keeper!

Excellent and simple recipe! I had medium to large brussels sprouts, so cut them in half first ,and then baked at 375 for 30 minutes in a convention oven, tossing occasionally. Turned out brown and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Next time I will reduce the salt a tad, and toss everything in a casserole dish inside of using a plastic bag (the plastic bag did a good job but seemed wasteful). Thanks for sharing your family recipe!

If you don't like Brussels sprouts, you might want to try this recipe. My mother burned the sprouts the only time she made them and I swore off them until my sister made this recipe. So delicious and tender. It doesn't smell bad, it smells DELISH!!! A family favorite.

Easy and fantastic.  However, if anyone in your family has 'texture' issues...they might dislike it.  The inside of the sprout was a little mushy.  Delicious but mushy.

Second time I've made these.  I like them and personally, I think the time given to cook is reasonable.  Keep an eye on them at the 30 minute mark and see if you even want to cook them any further. I've pulled them out at 20 minutes and left them for 40, edible each time with different done-ness of course.

These are incredibly delicious! I've made them twice already, one time whole and the second time cut in halves. I actually preferred them cut, I felt like it packed more of a flavor punch and made them less mushy on the inside. They cooked a bit faster as well...30min instead of 45min. I will never make them any other way.

These sprouts were delicious even though I have not been a brussel sprouts fan in the past.  I didn't use all the time to cook them as they were tender long before 30 minutes.  They were crispy on the outside with a great flavor and tender on the inside.  I wasn't sure how they would taste so cooked only half what the recipe called for, and my daughter wanted to know if I had more.  We will be using this recipe again.  Super easy and super tasty.

Great recipe!  Easy to make and delicious. I only turned 3 times. I cooked in a toaster over (on oven setting) because my oven was already in use for turkey that had to be cooked at lower setting.

I've made this recipe dozens of times.  But I make one small change... I blanch them first.  I also like to cut them in half if some are really large, you want them to all cook at the same speed.   I never thought I'd like brussel sprouts, but I tried them roasted and they're fantastic.   I like to blanch them for a few minutes first, before roasting.  (I don't like them crunchy inside - but I love them roasted and just turning brown... or even a bit brown on the outside).  The little brown crunchy pieces left over in the pan are like delicious little chips that are irresistible!   And left-over sprouts are just as good and I can make a meal out of them!!  Lots of people who say they don't like brussel sprouts end up liking them prepared this way.  

I like to roast all my veggies this way now!!  Small baby potatoes are fantastic this way.  Asparagus is as well, but I don't blanch either one.  Blanching the sprouts helps to remove the bitterness in the center if it's not cooked all the way through.  Make sure you lay foil down on the pan and spray it with cooking spray.  Then don't forget to stir them half way through.  This is a great way to do veggies!!

You can't go wrong with sprouts, olive oil and spices. I actually cut my sprouts in halves so they would soak up the spices more and I did 375 degrees for 30 minutes, flipping them over at 15 minutes. Enjoy! They are a great side dish.

I am absolutely amazed at how good these brussels sprouts came out. The only ingredient I changed was instead of kosher salt I used garlic salt. I also halved them and roasted them face down for 40 minutes - I never once shook the pan or moved them at all and they came out absolutely amazing. Definitely worth waiting until they're really browned. Oh! And all the leaves that fell off came out amazing! I wish I hadn't thrown out most of the fallen leaves because those, while burnt looking, came out tasting unbelievably good. Can't wait to make these again.

LOVE roasted brussels sprouts!  So simple yet so yummy.  And yes, they are even good cold out of the refrigerator!  I don't roast them for 45 minutes though, I will do about 20 - 25 minutes on 400-425.  Mmmmm....

I make these all the time and they are so delicious.  At the holidays or when having company right before serving pour about 2 tablespoons of balsamic glaze (cream) over.  Pop back in the oven for about 1 minute.  Amazing

I made them exactly as described. Mine were a bit bland. They need something else, I'll need to add something extra next time and see if we like them more.

I usually set the oven to 425 or even 450. Just check on them after about ten minutes and turn them as needed. If you really want people to love brussels sprouts, cook them with a couple of slices of bacon in the same pan, then crumble the bacon up and mix with the brussels sprouts. It's easy and delicious.

This is simple and delicious.  I let them marinate in the ziplock bag with olive oil, pepper, truffle salt, and minced garlic for a couple of hours.   Thanks so much.

I feel foolish admitting this, but I have been calling them Brussel sprouts (LOL). If nothing else, I did learn that Brussels is plural, and more awkward to say followed by "sprouts".

This recipe is basically what I use for any vegetables that I roast, and I roast a lot, so it wasn't anything unique in that regard. I had never made Brussels sprouts before, and I really don't know why.  Prepping them was the hardest part, and I ended up cutting them all in half after trimming . I don't use a plastic bag, just throw them in a bowl and mix everything together. I also roasted these at 350 (using convection roast setting on my oven) for approximately 30 minutes. They were cooked nicely as well as very tasty. This is a great way to roast almost any vegetable!

One suggestion is to open all the windows while you make this. It is fantastic but it sets off the smoke detectors in my house.

the pork was incredibly tasty but the gravy a little too sweet. I would probably cut the sugar all together and add more salt. I cooked it on high for 4.5 hours and my veggies didn't get as soft as I wanted, so I'll try it on low for 8 hours next time (I added chopped carrots and potatoes along with the onion). super delicious for everyone and good with roasted Brussels sprouts too :)

This is my go-to recipe for Brussels sprouts. Instead of sticking them in a ziplock bag, I put olive oil on the baking sheet, put the Brussels sprouts on it, shake up the tray to get the olive oil on all sides of the Brussels sprouts, then topped with salt and pepper. Turns out just as tummy and you don't have to mess with an oily ziploc bag.

OMG SO GOOOOOD!!! This is the first year I tried cutting the sprouts in half and I think it made them much crispier and tastier. This does, however, require some adjustment to the cooking time/temp. I cooked mine for about 20-25 minutes at 425. Just make sure you cook them until they are well browned.

I made it exactly as the recipe states.  There was  a tad too much pepper for my taste, so I'll make it next time with less.  And maybe cook for a shorter time - I've seen other comments about higher temps and shorter time.  I may experiment with that too.  This was my first time trying to roast the sprouts (I actually love them just steamed) so I wasn't sure what to expect.

After 30 minutes at 400 these things were black. All over, not just in some spots here or there like in the photo. So we had to peel off the charred outside leaves and with them went the seasoning. The insides were edible but nothing special.

Never in a million years would I have ever dreamed I would have found a way to make this nightmare of a food from my childhood that I was forced to eat something I would actually enjoy.  However, I  followed recipe exactly, although I did cut them in half and also added some portabello mushrooms as some suggest, and not only did I LOVE them, but my skeptical family did also.  This will become a healthy staple at our house!

I loved these-- made a couple of changes though. Used walnut oil instead of olive oil, and roasted them on the grill in a basket rather than in the oven.  Really good!

Followed to a 'T'  my sprouts were a little mushy though. Seems 40 mins was too long for us. We all ate them anyway...no leftovers. Will make again but will also decrease cooking time. 
Thanks!

This was excellent! Prior to trying this recipe, I've only had Brussel sprouts a couple times and never cared for them. But these changed my mind! The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of minced garlic. Other than that, I followed the recipe.

I didn't like brussel sprouts before trying this, but they are so good with this recipe. Note I halved the brussel sprouts and baked only until they started to brown. I also added garlic. Super yummy!

This was my first time cooking and eat Brussel Sprouts, and this recipe was great. I actually cooked mine in a 375 degree oven due to them being smaller in size I didn't want them to burn or over cook. I did exactly as recipe asked and it turned out great. Just need to stir them up every 5 minutes to make sure none get too roasted/browned on one side.

This came out really good!  I had frozen sprouts do I let them defrost. I took them out of the bag and added the olive oil to the bag (just one tbsp since I only had 12 oz of sprouts).  Next I mixed the salt,pepper and added a pinch of red pepper.  I added these to the bag with the sprouts and shook then baked as directed.  We will make again for sure!

Great, easy recipe.  I cut the sprouts in half.  I roasted for less than 1/2 hour - they were perfect after about 20 minutes.  I think you just have to keep an eye on them until they are at the texture you like.  RAVES at my family Easter.  Still couldn't get my kids to go for them, but everyone else loved them.

I make these all the time either for myself or for guests. As others suggest, cook them at a bit lower of a temperature and cook them until they're brown and a bit crispy. You won't regret it. All of the bitterness goes away after the long roasting process. I also cut mine in half, as suggested. Just salt, pepper, and olive oil is all you need to bring out the nutty sweetness of the sprouts. Enjoy!

I do this quite often, sometimes I add chunky cut, olive oiled, red onion for the last 15 minutes, or, fresh whole mushrooms, also, this works well with a good lemon pepper seasoning, one without salt added, ala Spice Sage's !

I have been making my Brussels Sprouts this way for many many years!!!  I actually cut the Brussels Sprouts in half to fourths, depending on their size before putting them in the Ziplock plastic bag & adding the EVOO, Salt, & Pepper.   I have also sprinkled Parmesanover the Brussels Sprouts after roasting them & also have sprinkled Crushed Red Pepper on them before.  These are definitely the best way to make Brussels Sprouts.   Even my sons love them this way!!!

Not bad, but roasting in an oven makes it difficult to get the right result. Sweet Wife does them stovetop in a 15" iron skillet. I prefer to use my favorite wok. Both do well, making sure that the outer leaves are browned, and the inner portion steamed. Done properly, the dish is outstanding. And yes, they are sweet little cabbages... after withholding tax. (Ha!) If you like this, try frying chopped cabbage and enjoy.

If you want over cooked mushy Brussels sprouts then cook it as shown. If you want a perfectly cooked Brussels sprouts, read other reviews and cook it for 20 minutes on 400. Cut it in half and peel off some leaves to have good crispy chips-like Brussels sprouts. Yum yum!

These were so easy to make and gone in record time.  My hubby said, "where's the cheese sauce"?  After taking one of these little gems, they were gone in no time.  No leftovers for my lunch tomorrow.  Will definitely make again.  I did sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on top.

With this recipe I finally got my two girls and wife to all eat Brussels Sprouts and, what's more, like them! Seriously, this recipe hits it spot-on. I followed the recipe exactly and the results were amazing. Even if you don't think that you'd like Brussels Sprouts, give this recipe a try and I think that you'll be pleasantly surprised. And, if you like this veggie, you'll love this recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I noticed the smaller sprouts were the best if you're not normally a fan.  Beware though, my house smelled awful for about 24 hours before finally diminishing.  It is amazing they smell so bad but taste so good!

As I was buying fresh sprouts for this, I realized that I have never bought fresh - always frozen.  Whoa mama......what a difference!  I like frozen, but LOVE fresh!  When these came out of the oven I couldn't leave them alone.  Some of the ouside leaves get a little crispy.  So good! Very addictive!  Next time I might only use 2T of oil though.  I think the same end product could be achieved.  Never roasted veggies before.  I'm for sure going to be makeing this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

Making brussels sprouts this way is certainly a change! They taste like completely different vegetables. My husband and I love these.

This recipe is a family reunion favorite. Crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside. (As my sister-in-law says)
I also do my asparagus like this. Delish

Very simple and delicious. I added a few sprinkles of Herbamare when they were fresh out of the oven just to make these veggies even more tasty.

I thought it was decent, not wonderful. I didn't cook it for the full 45 minutes and I did turn the oven down a little halfway through. I want to par boil it next time to try and cut down on the bitterness. My kids did like the "chips" though(the little crunchy leaves).

I only used 2 Tablespoons of olive oil and just eyeballed the salt & pepper. I have a small oven- so only cooked 21 minutes, shaking the dickens outta them every 7 minutes. They came out great- amazingly good tasting. My 16 y/o kid loved them too. Can't say enough- try this out!

My friends used to swear up and down that they hated brussels sprouts, until they tried this recipe. These are delicious! I learned the trick is to roast them until they are very dark brown--almost burnt--to get a rich, almost sweet flavor.

They came out a little rough around the edges. Maybe cut down on the cooking time and use butter instead of oil.

I used a flavored olive oil and added thin sliced garlic, as well as cooking a bit shorter like many others have recommended. Turned out great! 
I have to add that  I have I loved Brussels sprouts since I was a child but my Mom let us choose how to eat "strange" vegetables. I would pull off the outer leaves and eat them, then discard the rest (which Mom probably ate)! Let your kids eat new foods how they want and they may try more things!

After cooking for 40 minutes (plus turning every 7 minutes!) we found that all the outer leaves were burnt and the insides were still quite crunchy. The flavor wasn't good at all, unless we removed those leaves. The next day for lunch I peeled the dark parts off and warmed in the microwave and they were better. Disappointed.

Add chopped fresh garlic for wonderful sweet and smokey flavor.  Note:Cut the cooking time in at least half if you halve your brussel sprouts, which I recommend as doing so increases the flavor.

Although these tasted better than the Brussels sprouts I was forced to eat as a child, based on the reviews I think I was expecting some sort of Brussels sprouts miracle of the palate which just did not happen. I'm not a big salt fan (and rarely add it to my food after the fact), but to me 1 teaspoon was not enough, but I didn't have any kosher salt (or know what it was for that matter) so I used sea salt. But, all in all I would probably cook them again. 

Update: 10/25/15 I now add fresh minced garlic and I can't stop eating them!!!

My family loves the simple taste of brussel sprouts but this recipe adds a little pizaz to a family favorite without masking the great taste of the vegetable.  It also helps to avoid overcooking them as it often times happens when boiling them.

I roasted them for 30 minutes - they were still rather crunchy - better wait until they turned dark as the recipe says.

I did this, but since I'm on a low salt diet, I used lemon pepper instead of salt and pepper, I highly recommend. Also, I didn't cook it as long, but everyone's oven is different.

These brussel sprouts were tasty however I think I may substitute the olive oil for thick bacon cut into chunks.

First time I've tried making Brussels sprouts and the taste was awesome!  I remember eating the ones my mother made and hated the bitter taste and hardness of them.  These are soft with just enough bitterness to the flavor.  Next time, I will half the salt, but otherwise, a great recipe.

I just made this for my family tonight.  My 10 yr old daughter really enjoyed it.  The little crispy leaves that fell off were very good.  My husband and I liked those the best.  My son, 8 1/2, didn't like it, but oh well.  He is picky these days.  I will watch the salt next time.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank-you!

I have used this recipe numerous time and it's a family fav! The only change I made was to cut the salt to a 1/2 teaspoon (and I love salt....). Found a whole teaspoon was a bit too much. Brussels sprouts became a new staple at my house and this recipe is the reason!

Just made this for my wife.During the prep she reminded me to score the bottoms of the sprouts so as to get rid of their natural bitterness.I followed the recipe and have to say I'm now a Brussel Sprout
devotee.They are delicious done this way.Don't forget to 'score' them.

After reading the reviews I chose to roast for only 30 min. They turned out great...I ate them like candy! Although, I believe they would of tasted even better the full length that the original recipe recommends. I think the key to this recipe is making sure you stir/shake the sprouts every 7-10 minutes. They are easy to make but do require attention. Really tasty and easy recipe thanks for sharing!!

Very tasty...I always walk by brussels sprouts at the grocery store and don't buy them because I didn't know how to cook them. This recipe solved my brussels sprout deprivation. The only t to the ingredients was 1/arlic powder. My husband and 5 years old daughter love it. A great addition to my recipes.

The only way to cook brussel sprouts!  It doesn't take the full 30 min in my oven, so watch them. But do let them get black on some parts, that's the best tasting part!

I roasted for only 25 minutes and they still tasted burnt on the outside and mushy in the middle.

This recipe was awesome. got tired of the same old steamed brussel sprouts and have not really tried roasting veggies before but this recipe was so easy! I also cooked them to dark brown and everyone loved them! Wouldn't change a thing!

Great.  Added three minced cloves of garlic to the sprouts.  Halved the sprouts.  Only used two tablespoons of EVOO.

OMG these were absolutely AMAZING!!!!!  I now love Brussels sprouts and can't wait to make them again.

I used frozen because it's all I had.  I thawed them, halved them (read reviews and didn't want them soggy) Put them in a bag, drizzled olive oil, sprinked just a BIT of salt and garlic powder, and baked as directed.  My boyfriend and I RAVED over them.  I never thought I'd crave Brussels sprouts, but these changed my mind.  I had them as a side dish but I could easily eat them as a meal by themselves.

Make these, you won't be sorry!

First time trying this recipe and I normally mess up the first time.  These were so good!  Don't worry if they look a little burned, their soft and flavorful.

These were excellent and that's saying a lot coming from someone who hasn't had a Brussel Sprout since she was a kid. Couldn't stand 'em, but hubby loves 'em so I followed this recipe, except put them in a pan with some cut up potatoes. A little olive oil, salt and pepper and popped them on the grill (Big Green Egg) for about 30 minutes. They came out delicious. I gave them four stars only because I still am not fond of Brussel Sprouts, but at least this way, I will actually eat them! Pretty tasty.

We love Brussels sprouts in out house and these were worth fighting over!  First I couldn't resist eating one every time I checked them and second my son was mad that we left him so few!  
Followed recipe as written but maybe roasted them a little less time.

Excellent !!  I have had Brussel Sprouts just about any way they can be made, but this way and on the grill are the best by far.  I shortened the time, but that is all I changed.

I will use this recipe again and again.  I followed the directions exactly although I did halve the sprouts. I cooked at a slightly lower temp because I was cooking something else at the same time.  I learned from another reviewer not to discard  the little leaves that fall off. They are delicious! I wouldn't have believed it but I did eat the leftovers cold and straight  from the fridge.  Yum!

Honestly couldnt find anything wrong with this recipe. Its very straight to the point brussel sprouts. I may add garlic the next time I make it but following these directions (35 mins in the oven Id say) they were pretty perfect and nicely seasoned.

Yummy! I'd never thought of roasting brussel sprouts but after reading all the positive reviews, I thought I'd give this recipe a try. WOW! My son was skeptical when I told him we were going to try this, but he loved it as much as I do! I roasted them a bit longer than I should have - the outsides were all blackened - but the combination of the crispy outside and the creamy inside was to die for! This is another family favorite now :)

My new favorite vegetable!  I followed this recipe just as it is and discovered a vegetable that I thought I didn't like.  I used fresh sprouts and I did par boil them for 2 minutes as someone suggested.  Everyone loved them!

Pretty good stuff. I like them steamed also but can usually eat only 5 or 6 because of the bitterness. These were not bitter at all and my 6 year old son who seems to be allergic to vegetables actually liked them.

Simple and easy. The only way I eat or prepre Brussels sprouts is by roasting them.  You can always add pancetta nd other foods to them for a more wow factor. This recipe is the root of most Brussels recipes.

**EDIT:  I've made these again and again and have found that covering the halved spouts with tinfoil and cooking them at 450 degrees on the very top rack for 20 minutes, give them a little shake, and back in the oven uncovered on the top rack for another 10 minutes makes perfectly cooked, carmalized spouts!! I also cut the oil down to about 2 tbsps. EDIT**


I made this as directed and I did not end up with delicious caramelized nuggets :(  Mine were dry and not tender (or maybe not fully cooked) on the inside.  I did cut the spouts in half as many suggested.  I might make this again and take the advise of another to smoosh the spouts toward the end of cooking to separate them and allow them to completely roast, not just the outer leaves.  Thanks for the post!

Great - for a change stir in after 20 mins of cooking - chopped, cooked bacon bits and 1/4 c apple cider vinegar mixed with 1Tablespoon of brown sugar.  Delicious.

The last time I had brussel sprouts was 30 years ago - boiled and  disgusting. I'll never forget that flavor - ugh. Friends convinced me to try them this way - and I felt after 3 decades I should give 'em another shot. I bought five (yes, only 5) sprouts expecting the worst. Can I tell you - following this recipe, BRUSSEL SPROUTS ARE OUTSTANDING. My tween daughters asked for more! Even my anti-veg hubby liked them. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. This is a simple and delicious recipe, and brussel sprouts will now have a place on our Christmas table!

It doesn't get any simpler or better than this! I cleaned and cut them in quarters, the small ones in half and they were ready in 30 minutes. I did back the temp off to 350 because we just like them lightly browned. I doubt I will ever bake in a dish again. Thank you!

We absolutely love this recipe. Like many, my childhood memories of Brussels sprouts are not pretty. These, though, are nutty, complex, and delicious. The only change I made was to add some whole garlic cloves to roast with the vegetables. They added a nice layer of flavor and interest to the dish. (I also used garlic grape seed oil.) This has become a holiday favorite for our family. Thank you to the poster!

I love this recipe. We add crispy bacon to the mixture and then add pine nuts during the last 10 minutes of roasting. A Thanksgiving staple in our house.

Not sure how long I had this in the oven total.  I took the pan out after 20 minutes according to some reviewers' suggestions, and the sprouts were too hard.  Put them back in the oven, but forgot to set the timer.  When I took them out they were black on the outside and I was ready to throw them, but I thought, what the heck, I'll try one.  Glad I did!  Delicious with the carmelization on the outside and so tender on the inside!  Only thing was they were too salty, I would definitely use maybe only 1/2 tsp salt next time.

Love it!!! Not a fan of B. S. But these are delicious. I did it today for the second time. I did some changes to try it different. I use butter instead of olive oil, add garlic and add some lime at time of serving. Super  wow ! Yum yum !

Crunchy and crispy.  Great flavor.  Wonderful way to serve as side dish or garnish.  Easy and quick to make, but you must watch them closely while they cook so they don't burn.

I am so surprised that I like these. Ever since I was a kid I hated Brussels sprouts. What kid actually likes them?? But my husband loves them so I would make them for him & suffer the smell of them steaming & try not to gag while he ate them. That is until I roasted them. Wow, what a difference! Roasting these little babies adds such a nutty flavor. I am a convert! My husband thanks you!

This is a great way to enjoy Brussel Sprouts!  Just follow the recipe as submitted.  I like to marinade them first overnight however, in a 50/50 ratio blend of milk/corn likker!

WOW! What a simple yet delicious way to prepare Brussels sprouts.  I will FOREVER prepare them this way.  I did make a few alterations:  washed, trimmed and halved sprouts AND used home grown broccoli then sprinkled 1 tsp of sea salt over both and let sit for approx. 10 mins.  Then placed in a large bowl and put in olive oil, ground pepper, and minced garlic- about 3 cloves.  Put on a foil-lined pan and baked for approx. 25-30 mins.  Sooooo..... good!!!

Thought it was a little too much salt (I did use regular though as I did not have kosher on hand). May cut back next time. Otherwise, easy and delicious. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

I was never a fan of brussels sprouts till these. I take sure to v-cut into the stem, removing the extra. These things are fabulous and my kids are constantly bugging me to make them. These are now a monthly purchase so I can make them at least once a month!

Just made this. I love Brussels sprouts so I'll pretty much like any cooking method. 
Not sure why others say cook for 15 mins. I halved the sprouts yet still cooked for 35 mins and some were still a little crunchy. 
This recipe was ok. I'd probably cook them like this again as it's easy, but it wouldn't be my preferred method. Shortly steaming, then sauteeing with bacon and red wine vinegar is much tastier.

I'm sorry, I didn't care for these. I made these exactly as stated, but the came out dry, crunchy on the outside, and very overcooked. Flavor was OK, but I couldn't get past the texture.

delicious. I too parboiled the trimmed brussels sprouts for 2-3 minutes, quick drain/shake to remove majority of water. Then I added them to a bowl with oil, peppered&seasoned salt, tossed the sprouts until coated, put them in the broiler pan in the oven, added maybe 1/8 teaspoon of kosher salt on top before baking 20 minutes on 350. I stirred, increased temp of oven to 400F, baked for about 10 more minutes. perfect! And still the beautiful bright green due to the parboiling. Easy recipe you can walk away from and not worry about burning or stirring every 5 minutes.

These were too done for my liking. Not enough flavor my liking either. I would add more salt, and probably follow another reviewer's suggestion to add crushed garlic at the end. I also wouldn't add the black pepper until the end. If you're new to cooking bruseel sprouts, read a bunch of reviews. Wish I would've followed the advice not to cook quite so long.

The person that said all you're going to get baking them this low for that long is burnt brussel sprouts is right. The inside is done & the outside is burnt. I wont be using this recipe again, Im going to have to peel the outsides off.

Always hated Brussels sprouts until I had them roasted with OJ. Try adding 2-3 TBL frozen orange concentrate to this recipe. Yummmm! You will have to shake them and check them for burning (the sugar in the OJ will burn and blacken). Also try covering with aluminum foil for 20 min or so and then uncover the rest of the time for browning.

My husband has always hated brussel sprouts and I'm desperate to get him to eat more veggies other than potatoes, mushrooms and corn. This recipe did the trick, thank you! Made and baked as directed but added some minced garlic and cut the sprouts in half. In an attempt to make them more appetizing for hubby, I threw breadcrumbs over the sprouts about 10 mins before they were done and though it's not necessary, the crumbs added another texture to the already delish sprouts.

These turned out so yummy, even people who say they don't like brussel sprouts would like these! I substituted garlic salt for kosher salt.  The loose leaves turned out kind of like kale chips, but tastier. I am VERY pleased!!

Tried to half the recipe and I think it just didn't convert well for my first attempt at making sprouts. I will not give up hope though! I halved mine because of another recipe I saw and they turned out a little over-seasoned. All in all, the Brussel sprout flavor was good; I think I can do better with the seasonings next time.

My husband and I liked these better than sauteeing them with minced garlic. I had a bad experience eating brussel sprouts that had been cooked for hours in a stew (=really, really unpleasant taste/texture). I haven't bothered trying them since. My husband grew up eating them & enjoyed them so I finally mustered the courage to try them again. First we tried sauteeing them with garlic, and it was okay, but I wasn't able to eat more than one. I tried this recipe- I cooked them for about 12 minutes at 375, then lowered it to 325 (worried they may burn without cooking the inside), but after my total cooking time had been about 25 minutes and they were very firm in the center, I upped the temp to 375 again and after a total cook time of about 35 minutes they were done. I did NOT cook them to a dark brown/black. I cooked them until they were a nice brown (more than golden) on at least 2 sides (I was shaking the pan every 10 minutes). They were very good. The little leaves that had fallen off & blackened had a very strong tasted & a crunch. I could see how this taste may be appealing on the entire batch, but it would have been overpowering in my opinion, which is why I chose not to cook the whole batch to that color. I was very happy with how they turned out and ate about a dozen of them. The inside was soft enough to be enjoyable, but definitely not mush. I think the key to this recipe will be finding just the right temp and time for each family's tastes. Will make it again!

I loved this concept! But I did add a few things as they just seemed to fit! I added 5 slices of bacon, but up in bite sized pieces, 8oz Crimini Mushrooms and about 2-1/2 tsp of minced garlic and a 1/4c of parmesan cheee. And added everything else that the poster of this recipe added. Cooked at 400 for 30 mins, turning veggies about every 5-7 mins, getting them to the slightly brown, with a hint of black stage. They were yummy!!!

Excellent starter recipe to add your own twists and flair to!  I added dried rosemary and minced garlic, It was aromatic and so flavorful!  Yummy!  will make this again very soon, cause the picky kids even loved it, usually the words brussel sprouts brings a chorus of moans and groans!!!!

I made these for my family after stopping by the Farmer's Market on the way and picking up some fresh ones! My son says they have the perfect blend of seasoning! This is his 2nd time in life having them! My husband says the crispiness gave it a different texture, but he loves them! We paired them with grilled pork chops. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought "no way could such a simple recipe be that great", so I made brussel sprouts for the first time for my family.  OMG- gone in seconds!  I did bake til almost black and they were awesome!  Brussel sprouts are now on my weekly shopping list.  Thank you to whoever posted this great recipe.

Love Brussels Sprouts, love this recipe. Tried this using slightly thawed frozen sprouts (always have in freezer) and everyone really enjoyed them. Have roasted fresh asparagus many times and never thought about doing the same with Brussels Sprouts.  Will be making these again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe! I love the slightly charred texture of the sprouts. If you are short on time or want them to be done faster, cut the sprouts in half before you cook them.

Delicious and easy!  Used a 12 oz frozen bag of sprouts and used 2 1/2 teaspoons lemon grapeseed oil instead of olive oil and added 2 cloves minced garlic to the top of the sprouts before baking.  Only took 30 min with frozen sprouts

As suggested by another reviewer, I cut the brussels in half and reduced the cooking time. Much better than plain old boiled brussel sprouts.

It was too salty for me.  I usually omit or halve salt from recipes but I was scared this time...I mean everyone is supposed to hate brussel sprouts, right?  Still, I was pleasantly surprised!  I will make this again the next time I find them on sale. I was scared of the creamy/mushy middles and halved mine.  I wish I had not.  The larger halves were the tastiest.  The combination of creamy and robust/nutty was the best.  I also added a clove of garlic as many reviewers suggested and was pleased with that.  Several people suggested removing the choke.  Upon google image searching I discovered it was bigger than I would have guessed so search it yourself or do a good strong V cut in it.  Mine looked like Pac-man :-)

I detest Brussels sprouts.  This recipe made them edible and enjoyable, to a point. The darker the outside, the better, for those of us who do not like Brussels sprouts.  I place mine on a rack and don't bother with shaking the pan, because I'm lazy.  I'm so pleased I tried this recipe. Thank you for posting it.  Replace oil with garlic butter, or garlic oil for a different flavor.  Be sure whatever you add can take the heat, I'm not sure any herbs would work, for example.  One could toss them into an herb butter afterwards, and parm cheese, for example.

delicious and simple.  good advice to check them frequently....mine were done in a much shorter time, and were certainly not mushy.  I'll probably change up spices so I can make them more often without getting tired of them.

I have nothing to compare this recipe because I have never had brussel sprouts...I prepared them with chopped garlic and sprinkled parmesan cheese along with sea salt, and roasted for 20 minutes in a 425 degree oven (as another reviewer suggested)...There was no odorous smell as other reviewers stated. The sprouts turned out well, I think...much like little cabbages with a nice salty caramelized coat....the burnt-like shavings that fall off are like chips...yummy...Very easy side dish!

I decided to be a grown up and try brussel sprouts using this recipe. I didn't love them, but I didn't hate them either. The main reason I won't be making brussel sprouts again is because I didn't care for the way they made my house smell for two days! 

Like one of the other reviewers, I cut the sprouts in half before roasting.  This cut down on the baking time by about 15 minutes, and it helped to brown the bottoms.

Thank you for the recipe, I've never gotten these right before & it's an excellent base recipe. Per reviews I halved the sprouts & blanched for 2 min. in water w/ Lawry's seasoned salt, before roasting added 2 cloves of chopped garlic & a small onion sliced thin, roasted 20 min. I have never seen my 1 year old son eat so many vegetables & am floored that Brussels sprouts are what he finally picked to chow down on!

I'm giving this recipe five stars.  I had never had brussel sprouts before, and I found these very good.  I agree that you need to follow the instructions and get them dark.  Even the extra leaves which fall off can be thrown on the tray.  I don't think I would want sea salt with these like some people said.  I will probably try a little garlic next time just to see how it is, but I would definitely recommend trying the recipe as is first.  Very good :)

These were amazing. This was my first time roasting brussel sprouts and it won't be my last.  After reading reviews I decided to cook it according to the time on the recipe and I'm glad that I did.  I also added fresh chopped garlic along with the olive oil and salt & pepper.

We loved these!  Brussels sprouts get so wonderfully sweet and camamelized when you roast them.  I cut mine in half so they were done at about 20 minutes.  They had lovely color and flavor, and there were no leftovers  :)

Tonight was my first time cooking brussel sprouts, but not my last!  This recipe was fantastic, and my 7 year old even ate them.  I quartered them before preparing, which made them perfectly bite-sized.  I cooked them for 20 minutes and they were perfect.

This is pretty much how I do all my vegetables. It's good and easy, but this recipe has you cooking the sprouts way too long. Roast 15-20 minutes, so they are not mushy.

Never tried brussel sprouts before and I was surprised that I really liked it.  I decided to cook bacon with garlic and creole seasoning to add to the brussel sprouts for extra flavor.

This would get five stars with my modifications.  I added fresh minced garlic and chopped onions.  Then when they were starting to get tender I added crushed red pepper flakes, italian bread crumbs, dried parmesan cheese, and fresh lemon juice.  The lemon juice put it over the top.

Crispy and brown on the outside, creamy and silky on the inside.. yum! We recently tried a frozen steamer packet of Brussel sprouts but it was not good at all. I wanted to give them one last chance so tried this recipe - delicious. Will definitely be going into our rotation.

Liked this recipe a lot!  Liked the ease of using the bag to mix/toss all the ingredients.  I added a little nutmeg which I thought, mixed with the salt, gave a nice salty-sweet taste.

Ok.. I will be the first to admit I never had brussel sprouts before but trying to learn to like new vegetables.  They were ok.  Didn't like the brown/black leaves at all like others did.  Won't be making again.. not sure brussel sprouts will make our list again.

Holy smokes, was this recipe great! I can remember slimy, stinky boiled Brussels sprouts as a kid...it has probably been 30 years since I ventured to try them. But desperation for more veggie options that my kids will eat led me here. SO easy, and SO yummy! Only changes I made was to use garlic infused olive oil, because that's what I had on hand, and add a half of a small onion, sliced thinly. I love them, the lids loved them...so, there you go!  My daughter even helped cook them, and has claimed these as her new "specialty"!

Brussels sprouts have always been one of my favorite vegetables...but now this is the ONLY way I will ever make them. SO DELICIOUS. Sometimes I mix it up by adding a bit of minced garlic :)

I never liked Brussels Sprouts until I tried this recipe. They are now my favorite vegetable! This is so easy and so flavorful. When cooking for two I cut back to 10 to 12 Brussels Sprouts, 2 Tbsp. olive oil, 1/2 tsp. regular salt or sea salt, and 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. coarsely ground black pepper and roast for 30 minutes in preheated oven, turning every 5 to 7 minutes with a tongs.

Everyone always cringes at the sound of the word "brussels sprouts!"  So, I had to try them! I decided to try several new recipes for our Christmas dinner...and these were a BIG HIT with everyone! ...even my 8 and 11 year olds loved them and had seconds!  I added parmesan cheese to them (after baking), and ended up only turning them 1 time, during the 35 min that they baked. I followed the advice of an on-line chef - after you cut them in  half, put a slit (1/4inch or so) in the stem. This helps the stem cook more evenly, since it's thicker than the rest of the little cabbage).  Bon Appetite!

I'd never tried Brussels sprouts before this recipe, and oh my GOD am i a convert. These have become my favorite vegetable and i can eat pounds of them. I've since tried them prepared other ways and while they're still good, this is the absolute best.
 After having prepared them according to this recipe a few times, i found i really enjoy adding garlic salt after they've roasted. Also, i like to cut the larger ones in half to get more carmelized surface area. These are in the oven right now, for the umpteenth time since i discovered this recipe two years ago, and i cannot _wait_.
SO DELICIOUS.

Followed the directions exactly -- delicious! I would probably bake it for a few minutes less since I didn't have a large amount of Brussels sprouts.

LOVE THIS RECIPE! I added crushed garlic to give it a little more flavor but it was fantastic. I've tried boiled, fried, steamed and never ever enjoyed the flavor of brussel sprouts; I love this recipe.... My toddler even ate them up!

These were very good - I'll definitely make them again!  I added some minced garlic and two strips of cut up bacon & popped them in the oven.  During the last five minutes, I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top.  Be sure to shake the pan often, so the don't stick.

It is so gratifying to have something so easy and simple be so good.  Believe it!  This is the most delicious (and least smelly) way to cook Brussels sprouts.  I thought I didn't care for them, but this made a devoted Brussels sprouts eater out of me!  Puh-lease try it.  I eat them off if the roasting pan and they hardly make it to the table.

Have made this recipe many times,always add some minced garlic-and when I want to kick it up a notch- I add sliced almonds for the last 5 or 6 minutes, and toss with 1 tablespoon Balsamic vinegar,1 teaspoon lemon juice and lemon zest just before serving. I don't really rely on the cooking times in the recipe as it depends on what I'm roasting in the oven for dinner and adapt the time for that temp. Every time I make these, I buy more sprouts per person and still never manage to have any leftovers!!

These were a big hit at my potluck dinner with friends. Even the person who said he always tries brussels sprouts but never had any he liked loved these! It was shocking even to me how good they were because they were so easy to make.

I love this recipe! My boyfriend told me the only vegetable he didn't like was brussels sprouts. I made this for him and now he can't get enough. I've never tried adding garlic, but why mess with perfection? And they are great the next day. Easy, tastes great. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are one of my favorite treats. It's best to let them get crispy & black on the outside, creamy on the inside. I also added garlic.

Delicious! I cut my sprouts in half, used olive oil, sea salt and fresh pepper. A little crispy, browned and tender. Loved these!

I discovered this reccipe, though, from a different source, about a year and a half ago. My husband, who hates brussel sprouts, even loves this recipe. It is the only way he will eat them. My kids, ages 4, 5, and 7, love this recipe as well, and finish off every bit that I serve them. These taste really good hot or cold in my opinion.

The only way I'd ever eaten brussels sprouts was swimming in cheese sauce. Alas, health needs have dictated that we find another way to enjoy them! So I thought this would be a nice beginning place, and it was!  My oven was too hot, so the outer leaves got too toasted, but inside, yummy!  We'll do this again, because there was no bitterness, just good flavor!  I might add some other spices or herbs to it next time, for variation. But I'm really shocked that someone would give a bad review without trying it first. Not cool.

These sprouts are really delicious! The sprouts I had were pretty small though, so after 15 Min. roasting, they were done.

I tried this recipe as a last desperate attempt to add brussels sprouts to my new healthy 'lifestyle plan'(aka diet). They are amazing! I actually crave these and have them at least a couple times a week. Salty & crispy balls of deliciousness!

egh. . . mediocre at best. I was able to eat them and so was my husband, but they sat on my children's plate -- didn't move. Not sure what, but they were definitely missing something.

I never in my wildest dreams did I think I would write a review, saying that I loved the Roasted Brussel Sprouts. I've never liked them. Not even a big fan of cabbage. When roasted this way, they get a crunchy outside, that reminded me of eating an egg roll. Very good. My husband even ate 5 of them and said that he'd eat them, if I made them again. He's always hated Brussels Sprouts. My teen even ate a few, but really isn't interested in having them again. I'm making them again and I think I might try the garlic suggestion, next time.

I would give this 5 stars, but since I added one ingredient, I'd have to bet this is only a 4 "as is." I added a handful of whole, peeled garlic cloves (probably 15-20 cloves) and it was perfect! My husband has never even liked Brussels sprouts and I caught him taking seconds and then putting the left overs in his container for lunch! Kids loved them too, though they have even liked them steamed. I will make this again, but will always add the garlic. Thanks!

Fabulous. I use sea salt instead of kosher and add a little fresh grated parmesan just after I take them out of the oven. Even my four year old son eats them.

I made this as directed. I did add a touch of crushed garlic.  I had never had brussel sprouts before.  I felt they came out good.  I see room for adding more flavor in the future; so i would play with other seasonings next time.  I did see where the "mushy insides" may not please some.  The next time i will try cutting them in half.  I did use frozen sprouts.  I would make these again. ;)

I despise Brussels sprouts, but these were caramelly good. I did as another reviewer suggested and cut off the bottoms, then sliced them in half. These were a hit with my family too!

These are excellent! This is the only way I do brussel sprouts anymore. The rest of the family would not eat steamed brussels but they sure do love these! Thanks for converting them! I even sometimes mix in other veggies like carrots. They roast nicely together and so pretty.

This was a super easy and delicious way to prepare brussels sprouts.  I had previously only attempted brussels once before with disastrous results--but decided to try again because I'm trying to get away from the 'usual suspects' vegetables that I'm always preparing.  I think it also made a difference that I looked up how to trim the sprouts first, as I wasn't doing it correctly before.

This was yummy. Served to the boyfriend who had never had it before and he was asking for more! I cut off the ends (to reduce bitterness) and also added some garlic. Will make again!

These were delicious.  I took a couple raters' advice and halved the brussels sprouts.  This was great but it made a big pain of flipping them.  Can't think of an easier way to do that, however.  I am a true NOVICE in the kitchen!

Bacon, onions and garlic really add to this dish.  Make sure you don't make it in advance since the sprouts will continue to further brown (oxidize?) and look unappetizing.  Fresh from the oven they look great though.

YUMPTIOUS! I followed another posters suggestion and added a clove of minced garlic to give a bit more pizzazz. Great nutty roasted flavor!

My first time eating and cooking brussels sprouts and it turned great! I cut them all in half before cooking just to make it easier to cook. I cooked them for 30 minutes and some parts turned out almost burnt - but I think I liked it that way. I threw in any leftover green leaves that fell off and they turned into crispy chips in the end, which was a nice extra surprise. They were all pretty salty but that I was my own fault since I didn't account for the fact that I had less brussels sprouts than the recipe called for. I will be making this again for sure!

Several of the reviews I read were from people who previously didn't care too much for Brussels sprouts but were a fan of this recipe.  I can understand that because I thought that roasting them gave them a mellower taste, so by all means, try this recipe if you're not already a big fan of Brussels sprouts.  However, I am in the other camp of people that absolutely LOVES the stronger tang of steamed Brussels sprouts with a drizzle of butter and a sprinkle of salt.  That will remain my go-to method.

Roasting is the best way to cook vegetable and now it is my only way.  These are wonderful and we eat them all the time.

AMAZING, EASY - and now the only way I cook my brussels! I also added chopped white onion, sesame seeds and black pepper. I mix it up the day before and leave in the fridge just for convenience. Occasionally I add chopped bacon (which I cook separately in the microwave, and stir in 5 mins before end of cooking time).

I really, really LOVE this recipe! Sometimes I will have just this for supper if my husband is working and the kids had to eat early! I definitely only put them in for about 15 minutes though as I find they get overcooked at 30 minutes.

I was skeptical about this, but super surprised at how good it was! I added a little bit of hot pepper flakes, basil with the olive oil. I also followed other advice and halved the sprouts. I love how crunchy the outer parts get. Great recipe!

My family and I loved these!  I have never liked brussel sprouts but someone suggested I try them roasted. Feeling adventurous one day, I came across this recipe and it do not disappoint.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer to par boil them for a few minutes first.  I also used white pepper instead of black and did add minced garlic. Delish!

Very tasty.  Added smashed garlic cloves and should have added some bacon.  Would like to half them for next time for easier eating.  Mental note for next time but delicious.

Just made these and they are delightful. I liberally used the olive oil and put my own touch on it by using a middle eastern spice called za'atar.

My favorite way to make brussel sprouts I do leave them in a little long to really brown and if there big cut them in half. Before cooking toss them in a bowl with the oil, salt and pepper let it sit for awhile so they have time to soak up the flavor

This is a great recipe. It is really easy to execute and it made my fiancee think twice about turning his nose up to brussels sprouts again! I did boiling them for 2 minutes like many suggested and they took about 30 minutes in the oven. I did add some fresh minced garlic to them for a little added flavor but it was not overpowering. I paired this with chicken marsala and it turned out wonderful!

Great recipe! I chop my sprouts in half, so I flip them every 10 min. and after 35 min they are done. I also mix in a few cloves of chopped garlic and it makes it eve yummier.

I’ve eaten Brussels sprouts with enthusiasm for a long time and think they’re terrific roasted, but I add a splash of balsamic vinegar, which helps them blacken and gives them a sweet tang.

I read another review that kicked it up to 425 for 15 minutes and started there. I ended up going for 25 minutes because I wanted mine more brown. I used sea salt instead of kosher. And I used basil infused olive oil instead of standard olive oil. And this was just awesome! I actually started cutting the Brussels because I was going to initially pan fry them. But In the midst of doing that I found this recipe. So half of my Brussels sprouts were cut into lengthwise quarters. And what I found out was that the leaves, when separated from the sprout, tasted like chips! So awesome. This was very good. I would do this again and again!!

The outer leaves are dry and chewy but the insides are nice.  Sorry, but I prefer steamed and like to taste the brussel sprouts.

I very much enjoyed this recipe and so did my husband. I was actually very nervous because I did as others had suggested and read all the worst reviews as well as the really good ones. I think it's just a matter of taste. The Kosher salt is a must! Do not forget to rotate them so they darken on all sides. They are mushy on the inside which I wasn't use to but like I said, I very much enjoyed it. I will be making this again. My husband really loved the texture and the flavour. He said the darken leaves were very enjoyable. On another note, I did not leave them in the oven for 45 minutes. In fact, they were pretty much done after about 20 minutes. I think Dark brown is the idea colour and not black.  But in summary, AWESOME

I liked this as a basic recipe.  I gave it four stars because I only put them in for the lowest time (30 mins) and they still burned a bit too much.  Also, I thought they could use a bit more flavoring, like garlic or something.

The leaves from the brussel sprouts make great brussel sprout "chips"!  My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough.  I added garlic and we devoured them!  He even bragged about my brussel sprouts at work the next day!

Super yummy!  I never thought brussel sprouts could taste so good!  I cut mine in half and cut the cooking time down to 40 minutes - so melt in your mouth good.

I enjoyed this as written but I found whole sprouts bitter. So the second time I made it I cut off the ends, cut in half and took out the core (with the tip of a vegetable peeler). Watch them so they are just brown with a little black, it's easy to overbake these. Also I found 1 tsp salt way too much, so I cut it to 1/2 tsp. I love cooking fresh vegetables and I am already planning on making these again.

I have, over many decades, choked down the brussel sprout dishes people swore I would adore.  Sorry... My genetics make me taste that bitter vial flavor that their tongues seem unable to sense.

I got a bag of veggies... it included about 25 sprouts.  I didnt want to be an  so I looked for a recipe and tried this one.  Fully expecting to want to die, I tried one..... then another... then another....

Are they my favorite thing in the world?  No, but, WOW.... simple, healthy and I ENJOYED it.  So much so that I _may_ buy sprouts again...  Either way, I DO know how I am going to "help out in the kitchen" next time I see somebody about to make a vial brussel sprout casserole -- 30 minutes with me and that will be the best casserole in the world :-)....

p.s.  I did use 2-3x the pepper recommended and would do that again.

p.p.s.  when you make it, make sure there are several or more lose leaves.... the "brussel sprout chips" are really good.

DELICIOUS! I have never been too fond of Brussels sprouts, but this has absolutely changed my mind. The recipe was simple, easy and delicious. Even my fiance (who hates Brussels sprouts) admitted to loving these and gobbling up the leftovers. Tastes like a tiny baked potato bursting with flavor and texture. I didn't change a thing.

First time that I can remember in my 32 years of life that I have prepared or eaten brussel sprouts and I have to aday they were pretty good.  I think next time I will 1) add garlic and 2) cut them in have.  Thanks for the recipe!

I couldn't make it the way this is stated. I am greatful for the idea. I did what the recipe called for ingredients wise but changed it up for my taste. I layered brussels in a bowl that I cut in 1/2. With each layer I sprinkled (good) EVOO and Kohser salt and fresh pepper. When I was done with that I gave it a good folding so I was sure every little gem had something on it, at that point, plastic wrap  over the bowl and into the frig for a couple of hrs. When I baked them I put them face down on cookie sheet lined with foil for 20 min. at the same temp on the recipe. For my taste they were excellent BUT even better the next couple of days. Also, a little freshly graded parmesan was delish!

Experience: not much, still learning to cook after decades.

This recipe worked great.  I used sprouts taht I pulled from the stalk, one full stalk ... if that is what you call it.  Changed roasting temperature to 250 F as i put them in the oven with a beef roast already cooking.  Sprouts took a little longer but were delicious.

Best Brussels Sprouts I've ever had. I made enough for 12 servings in a crowd of 7 adults where only my Mum likes brussel sprouts. The dish was bare halfway through the meal. I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil. Highly recommended. I'll be using this recipe over and over again. It's a keeper.

I made this recipe for the first time last night (using a pork loin roast) and it is one of the best recipes I've ever made in the slow cooker. I followed the recipe exactly - the gravy was amazing. I served it with mashed potatoes and a green salad. It's even "company worthy"!  It will definitely go to the top od my 'favorites' list.

This is the only way I make brussel sprouts but I crispy fry a few pieces of bacon, and then crumble them onto the brussel sprouts when they are almost done.  I also add a little bit of brown sugar so the sprouts aren't quite so bitter.

Love this recipe!!! Even my kids will eat them. I made them this year at Thanksgiving for the first time, went over great. Baked them and then placed them in a crockpot to keep them warm while dinner finished.YUM

Yum!! My five year old and three year old had Brussels sprouts for the first time today and they LOVED them! They called them treats and trust me they have had sweets.  It was pretty much the only thing they wanted to eat for dinner. I never would have said that growing up with boiled sprouts. Delicious!  Try it!

I don't know where these have been most of my life, but it's a household favorite for us now.  The only difference is we add a bit of garlic powder to the seasoning process.  Those brown/blackened leaves taste almost like potato chips!  Great side dish for almost any meal.

absolutely wonderful, I can't say more. I couldn't stop popping them in my mouth will make again for sure the only thing I changed was I squeezed fresh lemon on them just before I took them out of the oven.  Do make sure you watch them and turn them often,

i grew up hating brussels sprouts. seriously hating them. my husband finally talked me into tasting roasted brussels sprouts at a local resaraunt. OMG that was heaven, tried to get that at home. this is the clostest. i did 3 things different
1. cut them in 1/2 lengthwise, put flat side down first
2. add parmesan cheese to the sea or kosher salt and oil blend
3. cook 20 min or until browned to your liking then turn over for 20 more or till done. 
groovey!

I followed this recipe exactly, turning down the heat through the roasting process.  I was so disappointed in the horrible burnt looking mess that I served my brussel-hating family.  They LOVED it.  My husband could not believe how simple it was to make.  Total keeper...

These were the most delicious brussels sprouts!  I minced a clove of garlic as per other people's suggestions, and that seemed to work well.  I will definitely make this again.

These are delicious.  My father doesn't like brussel sprouts and asked for seconds of these.  Another friend tried them and says she will probably never boil them again.  I cut an x in the bottom of the sprouts to make sure they can get more marinade.

I hate brussels sprouts, or at least I did. They were always bitter and chewy. My husband loves them and he also loves slightly burnt food so when I saw that the brussels should be roasted to brownish black I though it was perfect for him. However, I found these to be slightly crispy, creamy, and sweet. I wanted to eat them like popcorn. I love brussels now, thanks to this recipe. I added some garlic powder, but I probably would have been just as happy without.

Delicious!  Easy to prepare. Since there was only my husband and myself, I made 1 lb. thinking that would be plenty. They were so good that we ate every one of them and could easily have eaten more!  This is definitely a keeper!

This was my first ever brussels sprouts experience.  Perhaps that's why I only rated this recipe two stars: I don't think I care for brussels sprouts in general.  I'm going to give them another go, either with this recipe or another.

I sprinkled some bacon on top and it was nice.  Gave it sort of a smokey depth that worked well with the Salt and buttery texture of the sprouts.

I used a sesame oil/olive oil combo and par boiled these so they we're only in the oven 15 min. When finished I tossed somes toasted sesame seeds before serving.  I also used frozen sprouts, fresh selection was not good.

I might have left them in for too long. I would have preferred more juice than crunch. Other than that small slip on my part, I never thought to roast brussels sprouts. Great idea overall. Might go back to boiling with just a bit of salt, though. Keep it simple(r) and juicier.

This was my first time cooking brussel sprouts they turned out absolutely great.  I took a few other reviewers advice and cut them in half adding a bit of paprika with the olive oil, salt, and pepper.  
Cook time was about 30 minutes and they were simple and tasty, my boyfriend loved them.

This recipe is simple and is easy to add your own twist to it.  I plan on using this as my base for cooking brussel sprouts.

Would definitely make again!  I would save some of the salt the recipe calls for and add it at the end if necessary.  This recipe is also on the food network's website as one of Ina Garten's recipes.  Very tasty when you eat the bottom first, taking some of the leaves with it, and eaten upwards from there.  Center is a nice sweet compliment to the salty, roasted outsides.

These were excellent!!  The only change I made was to add garlic and onion powder.  I don't think I will make them any other way again.

Do not knock the Brussels sprout till you try it like this. Simple and delicious. I like a little crunch on the outside and I hate soggy veggies ... so I usually halve them and reduce cooking time to 20 minutes.

Great recipe.  I ended up cutting them in half.  Soaked them in some chicken broth for a few min and then tossed w/ PAM, salt and pepper.  Then roasted as directed.  Delicious and moist but still got the brown crisp outsides.  mmm.

I wanted so much to like this recipe.  I've never been a fan of brussels sprouts, but I love roasted vegetables and I thought this might change my mind. I followed the recipe as written, except they were done after about 25 minutes, and I did sprinkle some balsamic vinegar on the sprouts.  I kind of liked them, but not as much as I'd hoped.  But I'll try them again...maybe add some honey or something else sweet to take off that bitter edge.

I followed the recipe, taking them out of the oven after 20 minutes.  The smaller ones were dark and tasted burnt.  The bigger ones just had a weird consistency and a taste to match.  I think I'll stick to boiling mine in milk and sugar.

These are delicious.  I never cared for the over cooked gray matter that my mother claimed were brussels sprouts but this simple preparation has changed my mind.  I have made this at least 5 times in the last month.  I didn't cook them quite as long as indicated.  I have found them best when they are bright green with some browning.

AWESOME!! The only thing I did different was after they were done I put them in a bowl and sprayed some "I Can't Believe Its not Butter" spray all over them and tossed them a little, they were delicious.  Went very well with some grilled pork chops and a baked potato.

The outside of these were crispy and salty, which was good.  But the inside was all mush.  Husband liked them, but the girls spit them out.  I tolerated them, but would not make them again.

I only rated this a 3 because my taste buds didn't really love them. I didn't hate them, either. Just would rather have them the normal way I cook them, I suppose. This method was new to me and I felt they were too dry for my liking.

I wanted to love these, since I like brussels sprouts. They were just OK. The middle was mushy, which I did not like. They were not bitter, which was good. The outside had a good flavor.

45 minutes! Only reason to cook them so long is if you are cooking something else for a long time.
Cut them in half and roast at 425 for 15 minutes, stirring every 4-5 minutes.  Toss with more olive oil and some lemon juice and for heat some crushed red pepper.
Optionally-- sprinkle with lots of sweet paprika before roasting.

This was excellent. If you like brussels sprouts, you'll like them even better like this. However, they still taste like brussels sprouts so it won't win over any dedicated brussels sprout haters, but it may push some on the fencers to the other side! Thanks for posting, I never would have thought of roasting them without this post. BTW, I halved mine before roasting.

I have made my sprouts like this for a while now.  The only thing I do differently is I slice mine in half, so the cook faster.  And cook mine for 10 min. this flip and cook for a few more mins.  And for a bit more indugence drizzle a smidge of  melted butter when serving.

Love roasted brussels sprouts, As a change of pace I like to take several slices of BACON and cut them into 1/2 inch pieces and mix with the sprouts before roasting. I have also used bacon fat instead of olive oil to coat. I always save the bacon drippings in a jar and put into the freezer great for other uses, especially for making gravy

Didn't care for the dark roasted exterior which made it taste vaguely burnt, nor the mushy interior. It was sort of like eating mashed potatoes with a vague burnt brussel sprout flavor. My husband however, who normally can't stand brussel sprouts because of bitterness, says he'd give it 3 stars- specifically *because* the strong brussel sprout flavor was gone.

The sprouts were mushy on the inside, and didn't have a ton of flavor. Perhaps cooking them for a shorter time would help.

We had these for the first time tonight as a side with the marinated pork chops recipe and they were amazing! I must say I liked them before boiled but I love them roasted. Don't think I will go back after these. I used frozen brussels sprouts and and as suggested by other reviewers I boiled them for 5 minutes before following through with the recipe. Next time I will try fresh brussels sprouts just to taste the difference. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was wonderful!  We have NEVER had Brussels Sprouts before and thought we should try it the pure way before adding other things to them. No need! These were delicious.  I followed other reviewers and changed the oven to 350 and time to 20 min.  Halved and took out the hearts and now I'm craving more!

I seriously had my doubts about this one, but wow, I am glad I was wrong. They were crispy and brown. The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of four is that I cooked it for less time. I popped them in for 15 minutes. The leftovers are not so good so be sure to savor them when they are hot.

The sprout lovers at Christmas dinner loved them.  The likers enjoyed them & the haters still didn't touch them.  Roasting did not get rid of the bitter taste, but the salt, pepper & olive oil mixture on the surface was fantastic!

WHO KNEW??  My husband said he likedd brussel sprouts when I asked him what veggie he'd like to have for the Xmas meal.  I found this recipe and read the rave reviews and I was inspired.  Soooo delicious and soooo easy.  I think it's the kosher salt that makes it so good (and the olive oil of course).  Will make again and again.  Thanks!!

I made one change to the recipe.  I quarter the sprouts (you could also half).  I still roast them for 30 minutes, flipping 1/2 way through.  They brown nicely and turn out crispy and yummy.  My family's favorite.

I baked these at 350 degrees for an hour due to the chicken I was cooking as well.  I loved the crispy outer leaves.  This will be my go to recipe for brussel sprouts.

I was hesitant to let them brown, but the browned part was the best part (sweet, crunchy, and delish). I'm afraid we are still searching for our regular Brussels Spouts dish, as we all tried to like this one but didn't.

Never liked brussel sprouts until I tried this recipe.  I think 1 teaspoon salt is about right for the optimum taste. Roasting removes most of the bitter aftertaste and makes them softer.  Might try garlic powder as one other reviewer said, but looks like this is something that's fine the way it is.

YUMMY! My mother originally made these for me and I scrunched my nose up before trying them since I don't care for brussels sprouts; little did I know how wonderful they would be until the first bite - don't knock it till you try it!

Yummy!  We've always microwaved brussels sprouts before, but if I'll definitely do it this way in the future if I have the time :)  I used frozen ones, let them thaw part way (would have let them thaw all the way if I'd had time!), and cut the bigger ones in half.  Roasted them for about 35 minutes.  They didn't get super dark brown in that time, but the rest of dinner was ready and they were kind of browned.  One random one actually had a crispy brown leaf.  My fiance got that one and said it was good, but he thought it would be overwhelming if they were all like that.  He liked the whole ones best, while I preferred the halved ones- the insides were so creamy, like other reviewers described.  Definitely going to make this one frequently!

I had my doubts about this recipe, especially with the mixed reviews, but there is a constant battle in my house over brussel sprouts.  I love them and my husband can't stand them.  I decided to give this recipe a shot and OMG!  These were delicious and the best part was hearing my husband say I could make brussels sprouts anytime as long as I made them this way.  The cooking time is approximate, but as long as you keep an eye on them you can't go wrong.  Really easy and soooo good.

you definately need to cut the whole entire end off otherwise its too bitter.  Great flavor otherwise.  The outer leaves have such a crisp texture you could almost make a whole new recipe just following the directions except seperate all the leaves to make a healthier version of chips. Just an idea, might even try it myself.

This was sooo good I used frozen Brussels sprouts, I cut the sprouts in half and followed the directions they were perfect. I can't beleive I've never tried them before but will use this recipe again. Thanks to the recipe submiter as well as those on the recipe exchange who suggested this to me :-)

Scrumptious!! I first tried these at Christmas and they were delicious. Made then again this week and I'm adding it to my permanent rotation.  Excellent recipe for these vegetables. Taste equally delicious cold from the fridge.

not to shabby.  I never thought I would be seeking out brussels sprouts after a bad experience with them as a child.  I wish they came out with a crispier outer layer...but still very tasty! I will make this again for sure.

I'll make this again.  It was my first taste of brusslesprouts and they were tasty.  Made as stated other than I halved them and cut off the little stem.  I also used coarse salt.  Very flavorful.

First timer with Brussels Sprouts, I have been missing out.  These were almost rich tasting.  Felt I was eating something that I should feel guilty over.  I added some garlic powder to them.  I have made them 2 times now, I have reduced the salt each time and will reduce it more next time, for my next.  I may try added some sort of good cheese sometime too.  Very Good Find!

Bf and I somehow managed to make it through life without trying brussel sprouts.  Ever.  He decided to buy some at Costco the other night, though, so I had to figure out some way of making them.  RE to the rescue!  I got some recommendations on this recipe so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Brussel sprouts are a pain to trim, or at least they were for me.  I got advice on that to, so I removed the green outer leaves, cut off the stem, and cut into the bottom like a cross hair.  Then I proceeded with the recipe.  Final verdict:  bf really likes them.  I'm not so thrilled.  They weren't bitter, which is what I was afraid of (I don't like bitter at all), but they just reminded me of baby cabbages.  They were kind of chewy and soft--not my thing.  Since bf was a fan, though, I'm rating it based on what he thought.  Doesn't seem like I'd be a huge fan of these no matter how they are cooked, simply bc they don't seem to be my thing.  He added salt to them, so the kosher salt wasn't really enough, and I agree.  I even added garlic powder but I think they need a tad more seasoning to be 5 stars for the bf.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!!!  My husband won't eat brussel sprouts but had three helpings.  These are also good cold.  I was roasting some meat at 350 so put   the sprouts in earlier and roasted until browned.  They turned out just fine.

This was Wonderful!  My husband loves brussell sprouts and I was sick of just boiling them when I tried this recipe.  Now he always wants them roasted.  I also added a bit of garlic powder one night and that was also very good.

Awesome recipe...My husband loved them even though he never liked brussels sprouts... I've read the reviews before I made this and took the advice of one of them and sliced  brussels sprouts in half. They turned out delicious.Next time I will try making them whole just to see the difference. Thanks for the wonderfull recipe.

These sprouts are great.  My husband and I love them.  We make sure to slice them into halves as we are not great fans of the creamy middles.  My husband used to throw brussel sprouts in his college lunch room.  NO MORE!  He just simply asks for MORE on his plate.  I did add just a touch of minced garlic.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I tossed with 1 tbsp oil, 1 tbsp Italian salad dressing, 1 tbsp minced garlic and pepper, roasted 20 minutes until brown, gobbled up by everyone, including kids, I agree much tastier than boiled or steamed.

I made this recipe last night for my fiance and I. We both loved it. He doesn't typically enjoy brussel sprouts and was pleasantly surprised. Me- I couldn't stop eating them before our other food was finished. What a nice flavor, crispy outside and softer/savory inside. I did cut them in half and roast them that way- giving a very nice roast/crisp to them, which we enjoy (and probably cut back on cooking time). Do be sure to turn them every 5-10 minutes for a more even cook. I used sea salt instead of kosher. I know my boss makes a variation of these stove top too. She cuts them, cooks in pan with spices (tarragon, etc.) then steams in same pot until done- and still ends with a nice crisp to them. Enjoy this super-easy recipe and share with all brussel sprout skeptics!

Yes, my kids ate them!  I don't think I've had brussels sprouts since high school and it wasn't a good experience.  This year 2010 I decided I would begin to introduce "new" foods into our family diets and I gave this one a try.  I was pleasantly surprised!!  This is a fantastic recipe and my kids loved them.  With the first bite, they said it was delicious.  I made this exactly as recipe states and they were delicious!!!!  I can now say this will be a part of our "diets" in the future.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful.  Cut sprouts in half and added a little garlic salt on top.  Only took 20 minutes to cook.

I like brussels sprouts boiled or steamed much better.  These were really try and not very flavorful.  I might try again at a lower temp so they don't try out so much.  Also thought this brought out the bitterness of brussels sprouts more.

I hated, hated, hated brussels sprouts growing up. My dad would boil them-yuck! Finally, after 20 years of rebellion, I decided to give them another try! I am so glad I did. I did make some changes to this recipe-first, I cut the sprouts in half and took off half the leaves to have more darkened, crunchy pieces. I then doused them in salt, olive oil and 3 TBSP of chopped garlic, threw them on a baking pan and roasted for 30 minutes or so, turning them 2-3 times during cooking. Delish!

I echo the comments of everyone else- this recipe made me enjoy Brussels Sprouts for the first time in my life! I cut them in half and roasted them for Christmas dinner- they were the first vegetable (of seven I served) cleaned out and each of my 14 guests asked for the recipe. I will ALWAYS make them using this method from now on. Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe!

You can also put olive oil, salt, garlic and pepper in a frying pan and brown these babies!  After they are done put them in a bowl and toss in a little bit of Fresh shredded parmesean cheese.  YUM-O

I liked these, but I would not cook them until they're almost black, as the recipe states.  I cooked them for a shorter amount of time, until they were lightly browned.  I liked the texture & taste.

Never had brussel sprouts before and these were great.  THe more I ate, the more I liked them.  The only difference I made was I added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the bag when shaking them up.  Perfect!

I've made them this way for years. My husband grew up hating brussel sprouts until I made them this way for him. I also add garlic sometimes. This is also how I convinced my husband to eat asparagus. Works for those too :)

I have never had brussels sprouts but bought them on a whim today. Knowing the bad rap that they have and that people say they taste like cabbage, which I dislike, I was very nervous about this recipe. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious these are though!  Super yummy!  I added about a clove and a half of garlic and a little sliver of butter and halved them so they would cook better, as some suggested.  Definitely a keeper and I don't think I'll try them any other way!

I added garlic for more flavor.  The outside of the brussel sprouts were very tasty, but we didn't like the inside.  I think we just may not be brussel sprout fans.  I've tried several recipes and can't find one we love.

I took these to my Church Potluck last nite.  There were raves!  I was worried that cooking them that dark would not be tasty, but was I wrong.  Loved the flavor. I did take the advise of some and half them before roasting.

Had fresh carrots and beets to use, too, so peeled, cut into chunks, and roasted along with the sprouts.  Made a for a beautifully colorful and yummy dish brought to an early family Thanksgiving dinner, and it was gobbled up in no time, even by the children!

Love Brussels sprouts so I was intrigued by this recipe. I only cooked mine for 30 minutes and they were a tad over done.  But still excellent. They tasted sort of salty, sweet, and caramelized all at the same time.

I got brussels sprouts in my CSA box.  I hate brussels sprouts, but didn't want to waste them.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut them in half before roasting.  I was shocked - they were pretty good.  I think next time I would roast them a little longer, since mine didn't get really brown.  I would recommend this to any brussels sprouts-haters.

I cut these into halves or quarters depending on how big they are. I also added a little bit of balsamic and garlic powder (didn't have any fresh). My favorite parts are the little leaves that fall off and get crispy - mmmm, good!

I made the mistake of halving my sprouts and they were too dry inside. Toss any loose leaves as they burn to a black crisp in the oven. I also added some chopped garlic.

Minus the lingering smell of cooking them (the curse of most cabbage dishes...), these were excellent! Being someone that only sort of likes brussel sprouts, the "burnt" black leaves were the best part (looks weird and overdone but tastes really good).  Will be making again, definitely.

I myself don't eat Brussell Sprouts, but I made these for my fathers birthday and he and my mother love them. I made mine a little darker than in the pictures and with the salt and oil they didn't taste burnt at all. Thank you so much for the great recipe!

First time ever with brussels sprouts - some of the outside leaves that fell off where awesome when I took them off the pan, but the sprouts themselves, not so much. No really sure what people are talking about when they say the inside was creamy - not on mine. Cooked them for 30 minutes and they were starting to get rather dark, so I believe they were cooked long enough. My neighbor said I should have scored the bottoms, if, and thats a big if, I try them again I will score to see if the insides get cooked a bit more. My kids wouldn't eat them, and my hubby, who loves veggies, left some on the plate.

These are DELICIOUS done exactly like the recipe states!  Yes, it may seem long, but it is great!  I tend to crank my oven up to 410 degrees Fahrenheit and bake them for approximately 35 minutes.  They will be quite brown when done, but my husband and I really love them!!

This was my first time attempting to cook a brussel sprout. I will admit to not trying them due to their bad reputation. We followed the recipe, but added a bit of minced garlic and then roasted them on the grill in a foil packet.  They were delicious. We will definately be making these again. They were a bit black and crunchy on the outside, but the inside was soft and reminded me of cooked cauliflower.   Great method, made our family brussel sprout eaters! Thanks!

These were pretty good since I don't normally care for brussel sprouts. Hubby suggested a little garlic added to them next time (He's the real reason I fixed them)

So friggin' good.  I ended up using only 1 tablespoon of oil.  Also roasted about 15 cloves garlic along side with it.  Smoky, nutty outside made the flavor.

Amazing!  Just make sure you cook them until they are almost black on the outside...that is when they are the best! We've cooked these numerous times now and they always turn out delicious -- this is the only way I cook brussel sprouts now!

I have always loved bussels sprouts, but got tired of just steaming or boiling them.  This recipe makes them tender and adds such a wonderful flavor.  I added chopped garlic as well and that was the best part.

These were yummy. One of the few times I have had brussels sprouts and liked them. I parboiled them for 2-3 minutes and then roasted them with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and kosher salt and pepper. Next time I'll cut back on the olive oil. I used 1/2 T for one pound and they didn't even need that much

This is delicious as is. I've been trying to cut back on expenses and I used to buy these at the gourmet market for about $5 for about 8-10 (sold by weight). Since I started using this recipe I've been making them at home. My in-laws can't believe my husband actually eats Brussels Sprouts now. He doesn't eat a lot, but he eats a handful and that's a start!  I let them roast for about 45-60 minutes

I love this recipe, it is my new favorite way to do brussel sprouts.  It's so tasty and nutty, I overcooked them one time and they still were good.

I love roasted brussel sprouts!   The flavor is so great when they are roasted.  I cut a small X in the stems before roasting so they cook even.

I totally messed up and accidentally put one TABLESPOON of kosher salt instead of one TEASPOON. To balance this, I added some garlic, a tiny bit of white wine and less then have a lemon of lemon juice. It turned out better than I thought it would, considering my dumb mistake. After 45 minutes they still weren't blackened, but I took them out anyway. Next time I make them I'm going to do it strictly by the recipe and see how I do. Though they came out tasty and my boyfriend actually loved them. He wants me to make them the same way again. I'm just curious as to if they'll be better done the right way.

These are SO good! I think they are better when they have cooled down a little rather than straight out of the oven. They are even good out of the refrigerator! I first tried this recipe two days ago and I made it again tonight because I can't get enough. The second time I made it I skipped the bag step and just stirred all the ingredients up in a 9 x 13 pan.

I was very skeptical of the long cooking time, but these came out great! They really are great a little charred. I halved them and cooked for about 30 minutes. These are sooooo much better than steamed or boiled Brussels sprouts, which can be soggy and bitter. The roasted flavor was wonderfully complex, almost sweet! This really jazzes up a healthy vegetable!

I've never eaten Brussel Sprouts, but I'm trying to eat more veggies and try new ones.  They smelled good while cooking.   I don't know what they usually taste like, but I ate about 6 of these and couldn't choke anymore down.

I absoltely love this recipe! I learned this about a year ago, and ever since I have added my own twist. I add sliced onion and a few cloves of garlic to the brussel sprouts, coat in olive oil, and then coat in italian bread crumbs. DELICIOUS!! :)

I halved this recipe, but I should have paid more attention to the salt;  I though I had reduced the kosher salt, which I use frequently, but this came out way way too salty.  Brussels sprouts are one of my favorite vegetables, but I think I'll stick with good old steamed sprouts.

Ok this recipe is great. Turned out better then I thought it would. I was not able to get fresh and had to use frozen was the only change I made. The outside just had a little crispness to it and the inside was done. Will be making again.

The best and only way to enjoy Brussels Sprouts!  Have been making these for a while and every time I do, they're a hit!  The hubby and kids will even eat them!  Funny that they sell them prepared in a swanky store nearby for lots of $$$....too easy to pay for someone else to make them.  By the way, I also add garlic when roasting these.  Yummy!!!

Fantastic!  I was never that fond of brussels sprouts before.  Now I'm hooked on these.  Made these last night with Mushroom Stuffed Chicken Rollups (also found on this site) and cous cous.  Flavors complimented eachother pretty well.  The brussels sprouts tasted almost nutty.  This is so easy and tasty it's being put in the normal rotation!

This was my first attempt at brussel sprouts. I cut them in half and added pinenuts and a little garlic. They were pretty good but I wish they had a little more flavor. Next time I will put some thyme or rosemary in them...maybe even both!

I followed the recipe exactly (except that I cut the brussel sprouts in half first) and found these to be surprisingly good.  I've made them for several holiday dinners and other reviewers are correct, they actually do tasted better when they turn brown on the edges.  I would give this recipe 5 stars, except that some of the tasters found the roasted sprouts a tad dry.

I loved this recipe! Didn't change a thing and I  couldn't stop eating them. My 12 year old son will even eat them cooked like this. Thanks :)

I had really high hopes for this recipe because of all the rave reviews. I love Brussel's Sprouts any way they come, but this way, not so much. I found that they were a litle on the bitter side and too salty. I may have done something wrong, but next time I'll just stick to boiling them with salt and butter.

One of my favorite ways to eat brussel sprouts.  I add 1-2 tablespoons of pine nuts for the last 20 minutes of roasting.

I made this as a side dish for family for Christmas. They were delicious! Two people who don't even like brussels sprouts said that they were pretty good. Definately how I will be preparing them in the winter time. Thank you!

I only tried this because of the rating. I was skeptical, but these are so delicious. My family loves them and they used to hate brussel sprouts. I roast them till almost black and the outer leaves are crunchy like potato chips. I can't say enough about how good these are. Like other reviewers, they have both a sweet and salt flavor at the same time! THESE ARE AWESOME!

I love eating brussel sprouts this way.  As recommended by others, I chopped my brussel sprouts in half before roasting with some roasted garlic-flavored olive oil.  I also checked on them every 6-8 minutes and shook them around so they would crisp up nicely on the outside.  Fantastic.

I only gave this 5 stars because there wasn't a 10 star option!  I am addicted to these.  I make them at least twice a week.  One thing I do differently though.  I can't seem to find the small sprouts, so I cut them into halves and for the really big ones I quarter them.  I cook them at a 350 to get them tender and them I turn up the heat at the end because I LOVE the little crispy leaves.  By far my favorite veggie recipe.

I have made these every week for the last 5 weeks! You will not believe the flavor until you try them for yourself! I did cut of the ends, added a little minced garlic, and that's all. My husband and even been eating them and the only vegtables he eats are green beans and corn.

these brussel sprouts have become a CRAZE among my friends and family. I ve never seen people so excited over a vegetable before. Roast these suckers  till the outside leaves are almost black and lots of salt (ground salt is the best). I ve also thrown in a little rosemary and garlic. Great with beer!

This recipe is SO good!  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  My sister, who is somewhat of a gourmet cook, LOVED the way these brussel sprouts turned out.  The guys did not care too muck for them but all the women loved them.  I prepared this exactly as written, no changes.  I let them cook for approximately 25-30 minutes in the oven until mostly blackened.  I was a bit skeptical until I tasted them.  If you want a bit of gourmet, then this is the recipe for you!! SO simple and easy!

I MADE THIS FOR THANKSGIVING AND EVERYONE COULD NOT STOP EATING IT.  IT CAME OUT EXACTLY LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO.  SWEET AND SALTY AT THE SAME TIME.  PEOPLE WHO NORMALLY DO NOT EAT BRUSSEL SPROUTS COULD NOT STOP EATING IT AND IT WAS REALLY EASY.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DISH.

What a great way to make brussels sprouts! I also use this as a base and add pancetta and onions for a slightly different taste sometimes.

A nice alternative to the "usual" brussels sprouts of the past.

UPDATE ! REALLY good way to prepare asparagus too but far less time than it takes to prepare the brussel sprouts...I love brussel sprouts but this is by far the best!  What ever makes this so good (its so simple) I do not know but they are great!

My husband has stated many times that he hates Brussels Sprouts but he enjoyed these!  They were the best ones I've ever had (and the only ones I've ever liked).  I did add minced garlic in the mix.  I also highly suggest lining the pan with aluminum foil.  A few spots were extremely hard to clean.

Wow.  I strongly dislike brussels sprouts, but my hubby and kids love them, so I've been trying to find a way to prepare them so I could eat too.  This was great!  I can only stand the very small ones, but that's more than none!!  P.S. I cut them in half to mellow the flavor (for myself).  Also, I prefer them a tad blackened - though it doesn't seem to make a difference for the rest of my family.

I can't personally give any brussel sprout recipe 5 stars because I just can't seem to develop a taste for them.  These, however, I will make again.  As far as brussel sprouts go these are the best I've had.

I loved it but the family didn't so much. I guess it is someithing that you have to have a taste for. I know that it really simmered the bitter taste down a bit. I almost didn't even taste like brussels sprouts

I love these burssels sprouts and so did everyone who ate them. My daughter (30+) teased about them looking like they were burnt but as soon as she got home she call for recipe. They had a great taste and were not strong at all. Ty.

This was so good, I'll make this again for sure. I added a splash of red wine vinegar into the bowl before I put them in a glass pyrex. I also added fresh chopped garlic and whole cashews. Pine nuts would be a good addition as well. This was awesome right out of the oven, but I don't think the leftovers would be so great.

I know this recipe doesn't need another review but it's soooo good I just had to add my opinion.  My husband loves brussels sprouts but I don't.  I fixed these for him and ended up eating nearly the whole plate by myself.  I made these exactly as the recipe states and they are perfect.  I especially love the crunchy leaves that blacken and fall off.  Yummy!  I make this at least twice a month.

So good and so simple. I like to sprinkle mine with a bit of lemon pepper, rather than just plain black pepper. Even my husband will eat them when done this way.

I love this recipe.. I omit the salt (because I have high blood pressure).  I use Mrs. Dash table blend about half way through the cooking, I sprinkle some parmesan cheese (the kind you sprinkle on pizza) all over the brussel sprouts.

These are AWESOME, I'm having some tonight and can't wait.  They are almost buttery in taste and texture, and the little burnt bits are so tasty.  I only wish brussels sprouts weren't so darn expensive so I could have these more often...

I have to admit, I was a little skeptical because this recipe was so very simple. It turned out delicious. I added minced garlic as suggested and used garlic sea salt because I didn't have kosher salt on hand. The sprouts turned out great and tasted wonderful. Thanks for a simple and delicious way to prepare brussel sprouts.

I rate this 4 vs. 5 stars because I'm still not a sprouts convert. That said, however, this recipe was really quite good. The carmelization was lovely and next time I think I might "help" a few leaves "fall" off because they crisp up wonderfully. Those who have compared it to crispy spinach are dead on. I will definitely try this again.

I make this every two weeks or so -- my husband and I love them!!!!  I made a batch recently using garlic salt and regular salt instead of sea/kosher salt -- sadly, I ruined $6 of the most gorgeous sprouts.

YUM!!! My husband goes crazy when we smells these roasting in the oven! So healthy and delicious and easily paired with any main course. I add a couple of garlic cloves (minced) to the mixture. I make this recipe all the time and often include other ingredients like potatoes and carrots. Simply divine!

It was hard to rate this because I just don't know if I like brussle sprouts (I don't recall eating them before) so how do I know if I just don't like them or if I didn't like this recipe?  My husband liked them and I thought they were pretty bitter.  I did, however, enjoy the blackened leaves.  I followed the recipe exactly (except no pepper-hate pepper) and I halved the sprouts based on a prior review.  I think I'll try again and parboil as some reviewers suggested to see if that eliminates some of the bitterness (and so I can find out if I do/don't like brussel sprouts!).

Like so many of the other reviewers, my kids ate these up when they've never liked brussels sprouts before. The best part is the darkened leaves! I cut the sprouts in half to save cooking time (they took about 25 minutes). Delicious!

Wow. . . who knew that brussel sprouts could be eaten without making a crazy face?  I am NOT a brussel sprouts liker, but this recipe really does take out the bitterness.  It's a keeper!

Yum! Yum!  Love the crispy leaves that fall off.  Wish they would cook quicker as I can't wait to eat them.  They are great cold as a snack also!

First time trying brussel sprouts! I've now made them twice in two weeks using this recipe. First time I didn't boil them, 2nd time based on other reviews I did boil for two minutes which did serve to remove quite a bit of bitterness. The best part for me was the crispy random leaves that cooked with  it so I think next time I'll go one step further and maybe cut the sprouts in half and loosen up the leaves. Tasty and very simple recipe!

Loved it! I also added some balsamic vinegar, pepper and garlic powder before roasting. Then sprinkled some parmesian cheese on the sprouts before serving. This was soooo good and easy. Im loving roasting!

I made these brussel sprouts for Thanksgiving.  They were very tasty and we had no leftovers.  They were a bit oily though.  We won't be making these again because my daughter could not stand the smell.  But if it weren't for that, I would definitely make them as a side dish on a regular basis (with a bit less oil this time)

I've been trying a lot of new things with veggies lately and I have decided to give brussels sprouts another try. I hated them as a kid and never touched them as an adult. I take it all back. These were amazing. The only substitution I made was butter for olive oil (I ran out of olive oil). These were so tasty. Even my husband (who had as much expectations as I did) was a fan and wants me to make them again.

These Brussels Sprouts are AMAZING!!! I prepared them for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved them.  Many thought they hated brussels sprouts.  Since Christmas, I prepare these about once a week--sometimes they're my dinner.  Other reviewers are right, they're addictive!

These turned out well but I had to explain to my guests (inlaws) that I didn't burn the sprouts, they were supposed to look that way.  But they were well received and everyone liked them, including me!

Wow!!!!  These are so good!  I actually never liked brussel sprouts and haven't eaten one in over 20 years.  I decided recently I wanted to try brussel sprouts again and chose this recipe.  I now love brussel sprouts (at least made this way)!  My boyfriend loves this recipe also.  We have made this recipe three or four times in the past couple weeks!  It is that good!  The only alteration I make is to add a clove of garlic.  Great recipe!  I never thought I would like brussel sprouts.  Thanks!

Amazing!!!  The best Brussels sprouts I've ever had!  You really should cook them until they're nearly black.  The caramelization is incredible.  We will make these again and again.

My husband and I searched and searched to find a recipe for brussels sprouts that would make our kids like them, and ever since we found this one it's the only way we'll make them. In the summer time we'll prepare them this same way, only on the grill. Delicious.

Bravo!  I make these all the time now.

Every now and again after I bake bacon instead of frying, I'll roll the sprouts in the leftover bacon grease and roast them in that.  Not the healthiest recipe but amazingly yummy.

Sooo YUM!  Made as dircted. Next time I will probably use garlic oil and change it up a bit.   I roasted them until they were blackened and they were PERFECT!!  So mushy yummy inside and crispy on the out.  Even the boyfriend who wasn't a huge sprout fan raved about them (hehe snuck 'em into this diet now!!)

These are great! I found the same recipe on the foodnetwork site and tried that one. It was great! I was out of olive oil, so I used butter the first time, and they were great! I made it a second time with olive oil and a little it of butter and they were delicious! This is definitely something I'll be making very often. I cut mine in half before I mix them with the seasonings and oil.

Super easy. The hardest part was cleaning the pan-next time I will use the foil!!!! and a tad less salt. BUT! Even with that extra tad of salt...We still loved them. BUT! I really love little Brussels sprouts, and I think that is the key.

Super easy to make. I kept them in till they were dark brown all over and they were great.

I have always liked brussels sprouts. (Well OK....after I was all grown up!) After making this recipe I LOVE them!

Delicious. You must use the kosher salt it make a real difference. I found the brussell sprouts tasted better the next day. I made the one day; then warmed them up the next day for a dinner. They tasted better the next day then the day I made them Fabulous recipe. THANKS

Roasted veggies is the way to go.  We especially like the roasted brussels sprouts.  I added onions to this too cause we love onions.  My boyfriend thought this was the best dish we made for Tday and all recipes were from this site!  These are also yummy cold!

I tried this recipes on a whim because I was tired of the same old vegetables.  Three days later I was getting pretty tired of the smell of brussels sprouts in the house.  Tasty, but they'll hang around a while!

For 32 years, I thought I hated Brussels sprouts.  My boyfriend always loved them, so I decided to try this recipe, and I am converted!  Absolutely delicious and easy.  I look forward to Brussels sprout season now.

I liked these, but wasn't really convinced until I added just a squeeze of lemon juice after removing from the oven.  It really added a little zip that was missing.  And those other reviewers were right - those "burnt" looking leave were pretty tasty!  I sampled one right out of the oven and it tasted like a fresh, crisp potato chip of all things!  Unfortunately they didn't stay crisp once I served them, but still tasted good.  I halved my somewhat smallish sprouts and since I had something else in the oven, baked them at 350 for 30 minutes and they were perfectly done.

These were really good!  My 9 year old daughter who hates brussels sprouts, finished them off and asked if I would make them again sometime.  I did think they were a little salty, so next time, I will cut down on the salt just a little.

I cooked just as the recipe stated and they did not turn out.  I think next time I will leave in for longer and trim the sprouts better.  It was my first time eating Brussel Sprouts, so it could just be I dont like them.  I will try again to see!

Very good!  I really loved these!  I rated it 5 stars, because although I thought they were fantastic....I like brussel sprouts,...and my kids still wouldn't eat them.  My husband did eat a few however and said he would eat them again if I made them.  Better than he expected.  Usually if I serve brussel sprouts I serve w/ a cheese sauce for everyone else.  But, I thought they were amazing, I ate most of them myself and i will definitely make them again.  I bet they would be amazing w/ a burnt butter/balsalmic vinegar sauce!  Thanks for the recipe!

This should be the first recipe on the list! I am thankful I read on for a healthier recipe. So many had cheese and bacon, etc. What's the point in eating a vegetable then?  LOL. Anyway...THANK YOU for a great recipe. Even my husband asked for the leftovers to be in his lunch tomorrow. The only change for us will be a little LESS SALT next time.

I love brussels sprouts and have had them many ways.  I just picked up 2lbs. of fresh ones at my local Costco today and wanted to try a new recipe.  I'm so happy I tried this one!  This is a keeper and not only delicious but quick and so easy to do.  I followed the recipe exactly which is hard for me to do as I almost always add either garlic or more or less of something but decided to try without garlic after reading a review when one person said they tried it with and without and liked it better without and they too were garlic fans.  Sometimes, the easy simple ways are the best.  These were very tender and had a great almost bbq/charcoal flavor, I can't put my finger on it, but it was really great.

I make these at least once a week. I love them, even cold the next day they are great. Works best if you chop off the bottoms and half them. Only cook for 30-35 minutes, turn off the heat, then leave them in the oven for 10 more minutes, keeping an eye on them. My husband eats them off the stove before I can get them on the plate. YUM.

My husband loves brussels sprouts.  They are on my list of 'would not care if I NEVER saw this veggie again' list.  So, today I try this recipe, roasting them in a pan on the gas rills while I was cooking ribs for Farther's Day.  Brussel Sprouts are now on my list of great-tasting veggies.  Thanks!

I thought these were pretty good, and I don't normally like Brussels sprouts.  I thought they were less bitter than the boiled kind.  My husband, who loves Brussels sprouts, did not like these much.  Go figure...thus, only 3 stars from us.

These are pretty good- I thought the outer part was kind of bitter, but not bad. Maybe a little lemon juice and/or parmesan? My husband liked them, so that's saying something!

Roasting is way underrated! This recipe bring out the actual flavors of the sprout. In one word... yummy! Crispy leaves on the outide and the natural sweetness still left on the inside. We love 'em with a little bit of butter. They are excellent, even the next day as leftovers.

These were very good and so simple! I loved the contrasting textures of the crunchy outside and the creamy inside. It's delicious as is, but it would be fun to experiment with some vinegar- or soy-sauce-based dipping sauces. These are also surprisingly filling.

These were just alright. I dont think the brussel sprouts I used were very fresh- maybe thats why I found them to taste somewhat bitter.

Most of my friends hate brussel sprouts, and I've never tasted it before.  So I decided to bought some and roasted it with this recipe.  Tastes great!  I followed some of the reviews and added some garlic powder too.  Its really really good! I don't understand why my friends hate them. LOL.

Delicious!  I roast most of my vegetables now.  This just proves how the flavors are enhanced by roasting.  More dimension than just boiling.  Just check on your brussel sprouts after 15 minutes.  If you don't like them too brown, take them out sooner. My husband likes them barely cooked and I like them really roasted so I take out half at 15 minutes and leave the rest in for another 15 minutes.

I bought some fresh brussel sprouts on a whim at the grocery store today.  I was a little leery of this recipe- after all, how could something so simple be so good?  Well, I found out.  The sprouts were delicious with just enough seasoning to accent, not overpower, the sprouts.  I nearly ate all of them myself.  I would definitely make this again!

These were actually pretty good. I added a bit more table salt and that seemed to help flavoring. I will make this again, just not quite sure what to add to it to make more flavorable. Thanks for the recipe.

These were good but not great, so I gave them 4 stars.  They are worth making, though, and simple.

I love brussel sprouts and these were really good. I kind of like them steamed better, but this was a nice change from the ordinary way I make them. I have never met a brussel sprout I didn't like.

These taste exactly as I would expect - like salty, browned/burnt brussels sprouts. The inside remains somewhat dry and flavorless. The basic idea of roasting these remains a good one, and I'll try again with some variations. Thanks.

I did a quick sautee in a skillet first then put in the oven.  I can't believe how much I liked this.  I normally dislike brussels sprouts and I found myself eating a lot of this. Thanx.

These are the best brussel sprouts ever. Just reminds me that simple is usually best.  And a note-I was dubious about letting them get to dark, but the darker they get the better they taste. Yum!

I was never a big brussel sprout fan, but these are awesome.  They weren't too too salty, but you probably could cut the salt in half and still have them taste great.

Wow, these were fabulous! The darker the better. Next time I'll use half the salt--they tasted fine, but I think they'd still be great with less, too.

I had never tried Brussels Sprouts before, and I'm quite confident this was the way to go.  These are so suprisingly good, and it couldn't be easier to prepare.  They are salty and crispy on the outside, while creamy, sweet and nutty inside.  My husband and I called hese vegan creampuffs.  You must try this recipe!

I usually like plain steamed or boiled Brussels sprouts with salt, but from now on, this is the only way to eat Brussels sprouts! I didn't change a thing, except my salt was Hawaiian sea salt instead of Kosher, and my super-hot oven had them done in less than 30 minutes.  I only fixed seven, but wished I had 17!

Delicious, easy and cold leftovers are great.  I,too, added a little balsamic vinegar 5 minutes before removing from oven.  I also didn't let them get too blackened. Will definitely make these again.  Thanks

These are fantastic. I am new to FRESH brussel sprouts, having always eaten the frozen ones.  Wow, these are great. I've made this recipe twice & the bigger ones taste the best, the smaller ones can get a little bitter. You will no longer find frozen sprouts in my freezer.

We made these for Christmas dinner at my Sister's house.  We used fresh brussel sprouts.  We all found them way too crunchy although the flavor was good.  Brussel Sprouts are my favorite veggie so I will try again only will pre cook Sprouts first.  I HATE crunchy veggies but others who like crunchy veggies even found these too crunchy.

This is the first time I've had brussel sprouts, and they were very good. I halved the recipe and drizzled the olive oil over top of them and sprinkled salt on them right in the baking dish, and they came out flaky brown. They reminded me somewhat of cauliflower, and were all gone by the end of dinner.
