I've been making this receipe for about 10 years.  I have change it quite considerably.  I used chicken cutlets (not a huge fan of pork) that I cut into small pieces.  Two packs of salsa seasonings.  Shake the chicken in bag w/ the seasonings and lightly brown chicken in skillet.  I 'dump' 3 jars of salsa (Old el paso) into chicken and a whole jar of peach preserves.  Let it simmer until hot - 10 min.  I serve it w/ rice (or egg noodles) - I have more than enough sauce to spoon over the rice to serve as a side.  It will feed about 6 people.  Reheats excellently.

VERY easy meal to make; I didn't have peach preserves, so I mixed a can of peaches (with their juice) and 1/4 cup sugar in a sauce pan, brought it to a boil and let it reduce down, mashing the peaches as they cooked.  Added a bit more than 4 Tablespoons of the peaches to the salsa mixture; made it all the more spicy sweet.  I served it with black beans and rice.  Between huge bites, my husband declared this was better than anything he's had in a restaurant.  Thanks for helping to make me look so good!

This dish is fantastic!  I bought a jar of Newman's own peach salsa instead of combining regular salsa with fruit preserves and it came out delicious!  Served with a side of black beans....will be making this one weekly!

This has quickly turned into one of my favorite dinner recipes. The easy to delicious ratio is fantastic. I like a little less salsa and a little more peach flavor, so I use 2/3 c. salsa and 5 tablespoons peach preserves. I also like to add a chopped green pepper to the mix for some added flavor and healthfulness.

I just made this for my wife and two girls. I love it when I hear, "Dad, may I have some more?" This recipe is simple and wonderful tasting. It wasn't without some changes, however, some intentional and some not. The intentional change was using can peaches, adding a bit of sugar, and boiling them down, as another reviewer suggested. The unintentional change was that after I seasoned my pork cubes with the taco seasoning, I got ahead of myself and added the salsa before I browned the pork. What else could I do but cook it anyway. I kept it over a medium heat, add the peaches a few minutes before serving and it was excellent. This recipe will go very well with chicken. I have to make a dish for my wife's Christmas party this year and this one will probably be eat.

I'd give this a 10.  Simple and easy.  I had taken out about 1 1/2 lbs of pork cubes from the freezer so I used the full package of Taco seasoning but needed some more which I didn't have on hand.  I had some rib seasoning leftover from the week-end (1 tablespoon of cumin, 1 tablespoon chili powerder, 1 tablespoon of paprika) so I added that.  It was perfect - right amount of heat!  Since I was using more meat I did use 2 cups of salsa and 8 tablespoons of peach preserves.  I served it over spanish rice.  There were only the two of us and we had to stop ourselves from eating the entire serving.  My guy already claimed the leftovers for lunch.  Thanks submitter.

I had a jar of home made apricot-pineapple preserves on hand, so I used that.  It was dee-licious!  I make my own taco seasoning (I believe there is one on this site too), which results in less salt and no preservatives added to your recipe.  Will become a regular dish here. Thanks.

What an easy and very tasty entree!  I have made it a couple of times, and has been a hit!  I even had a friend over who didn't have dinner, and she had the last pork chop, and fell in love - she thought I had slaved over dinner (little did she know)

Delicious!!  The portioning is fairly small, so if you're big eater like us, you may want to increase the portion by 50%.

This was SO simple and tasty.  I used apricot preserves because that is what I had, and it was delicious.  I also used boneless pork chops which I cubed.  Served this over rice with veggies.

I love this site... No peach jam... Make your own...you can learn from so many people's comments... I had taken chicken drum sticks out to try a different recipe .... Only to realize I did not have all the ingredients to make it... But I did have all the stuff to make this with my chicken... Thanks to other comments on making your own peach preservatives... It was fantastic... Can hardly wait to make it with pork next time....

About 8 years ago I was reading a forum on web and someone asked for help fixing something quick and easy for dinner.  The question was "what is your 'go to' recipe?  I have to admit if I had not read this and been intrigued, I would never have tried it which is odd because I'm not a cautious cook!  I have changed it up using many different preserves (apricot is good and so is pineapple) and any salsa will do; you can make it mild or really give it a kick.  My cousin has made it many times with chicken and served to his church group!  It's good with any type of pasta, noodle or rice.

This is very similar to a Weight Watcher recipe that I've been making for quite some time.  The WW version calls for low-sugar apricot preserves and a half package of low sodium taco seasoning.  It is delicious and won a Golden Spoon Award many years ago.

Perfect! Looking for something different and hit the jackpot!!  Easy is an understatement with the availability of ingredients and quick to prepare. The peach preserves give it a surprise slight hint of sweetness and the taco seasoning was right on target. I made this for 3 adults and 3 GK's from 8 to 15. DH got up this AM and wanted to know if there was enough left over for him to take to work for his lunch.  Well, yeah, but I was looking forward to having it for MY lunch.  I conceded defeat, lovingly. ChristyJ, thank you.  I look forward to doing this again!!  Six thumbs up!!

This turned out really well! I did not have peach preserves, so I used fresh peaches and some sugar and mashed them while they reduced. I also made my own taco seasoning, and somehow did not have salsa so I used a can of Rotel with lime and cilantro. I served it with beans and rice!

This was absolutely amazing.  I used apricot instead of peach preserves as someone had.  I also added one green pepper and one red pepper chopped as well as a large chopped onion.  I would definitely make this again.

I really like this recipe, I have been making it for several years now, and can't belive I have not rated it yet. The best thing about this recipe is you can adjust the heat, use mild or hot on your salsa, or even hot taco seasoning. I have also been out of peach preserves and used apricot, not much diffrence in the end.

One of my favorite quick and easy meals. I use chicken or pork for the meat and it turns out equally good. Also, apricot or preach preserves works perfectly. When browning the meat  I find coconut oil gives it a wonder flavor. Served over brown rice and you have a healthy, delicious meal that everyone seems to enjoy!  GreT recipe

This recipe is easy, fast and delicious.  You can subsitute chicken for the pork for a change of pace.I also use hot salsa which gives it a nice kick.

I used the exact same ingredients, but I put it in my slow cooker (4-6 hrs on high or 8-10 on low). This is great! It tastes just like my husband's family pork burrito recipe, but way easier! I didn't taste much of the peach or sweetness, so I think I will up the amount the next time I made this. Thanks!!!

I found a small pork tenderloin(approx.3/4#) in the freezer and decided to try this recipe. I only had 2/3 cup of Paul Newman's med. salsa so I used 3 Tbsp.peach preserves and half of the package of taco seasoning. This was fantastic. I can't wait to try it with chicken. I served it with white rice and green beans I also thicken it slightly with cornstarch.

Fantastic recipe!!  First, I used a kitchen scissors to cut any large peach pieces up.  Also, I doubled the peach preserves - because I used "hot" salsa and wanted a sweeter taste.  I served it over white rice.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is a new favorite of mine. I use it for chicken or pork and I add corn, black beans a little extra cumin with fresh cilantro on top and it is just fantastic!

My family really likes this easy one pot dish!   I have made it multiple  times over several years.  The longer you cook the pork the better it becomes. You can also use apricot preserves instead of peach .
I serve it over rice.  A keeper

Love it!  I happen to have some homemade South Carolina peach preserves ( made from recipe on this site), so that made it even better!  I use medium salsa, just the right amount of heat for me!  This recipe can be modified in many ways to make it even better, can't wait to make it again!  Read all reviews to get some ideas!

This was good enough to eat once but nobody in my family is interested in having it again. The flavors were a contradiction and too strong.

I really liked the flavors in this recipe (the sauce is delicious for all its simplicity) but had a few issues. First, it made way too much sauce for the amount of pork. It would have been far better with more pork and perhaps some broccoli or other vegetables. Also, the servings appear to be off. Unless you aren't very hungry, this dish would not be enough to serve six people. 
I will make this again but with more pork and vegetables. I added a 1/4 teaspoon of salt to offset the sweetness of the preserves.

I followed the recipe using mild salsa and mild taco seasoning. I served it over white rice. I like the concept, but found the taco seasoning completely overpowering. It was way too spicy, so we couldn't appreciate the sweet. I'd make it again with major adjustments...either my own spice blend or far less seasoning from a packet. It is an inexpensive dish, though, and easy to make, so I really like that!

I had more pork than anticipated (cut into small chunks, of course), I used approximately 3 cups of salsa, about 3 tablespoons of chile paste and a squirt or two of Saracha sauce (my boyfriend absolutely LOVES spicy food). Then used up 2 small containers of peach preserve as opposed to 4 tablespoons for that balance of sweet and spicy. OH! I also used a homemade taco seasoning mix (since we didn't have any)
We served this over rice, and I will definitely be making this again.

I have been making this dish for a very long time.  One of the first things I ever made when I was first married, 21 years ago.  It was delicious then and still is now.  Now my kids (18, 15, 15) love it and request it often!

This was really good and very easy to make. I had to get the peach preserves because I normally don't keep that in the pantry, but this is a great anytime meal with items you would already have on hand. Thanks for this recipe! This will be in our regular rotation from now on.

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.  It's easy, delicious, and so quick.  I used a pork tenderloin and the meat came out perfectly.  My only complaint is that it tasted a little too much like jarred salsa, so next time I will add some more peach preserves.  Overall, I was impressed.

Easy and awesome!  I cook it at the fire house and they eat it up.  At home I cook it in a crockpot and I use fresh peaches.  But as written, it is wonderful.

Positively YUMMY!! I was skeptical, even while cooking it.  How good could it be.? It was great. Just the right blend of spicy kick and sweet. I love cooking things with common ingrediants and things which cook up quickly for a good week night supper. I used taco seasoning in a packet from Trader Joe's, salsa with black beans and corn and boneless pork cultets which I kept whole.  I served the pork and sauce over rice with green beans on the side. It presented nicely and was gobbled up by my husband and teenage picky eater son. I had seasoning left over so next time I'll try bigger boneless chicken breast and increase the sauce to see how this works. This is a definite keeper!!  Thanks!

This was a really flavorful pork dish.  My husband said the best pork dish he has ever had.  I used one jar of Trader Joe's Peach Salsa because I didn't have any preserves.  I will be making this again. Thanks!

Tastes great and so easy to make.  I added spinach to give it a little color, but it turned out too watery.  Next time will cook spinach separately then mix in just before serving.  We had it with pita bread and it was really yummy.

This was very good! I was unsure of the idea of peaches and salsa, but my fears were assuaged the second I took a bite. If anything, I would up the ratio of peach preserves to salsa, just for a bit more sweetness to temper the heat. I plan on putting this in regular rotation!

I followed the recipe except for using chicken breasts.  Served with brown rice and broccoli.  Tastes great on its own but I tried crumbling a little cotija cheese on top and definitely recommend it.  It wasn't  as sweet as I expected but it was great and I will definitely make again.   Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this lots of times and its one of my family's favorites.  My daughter don't like pork but when I say I am making this she makes sure she gets a plate of it.  I have also used apricot preserves when I was out of the peach.  A very tasteful dish indeed

We added fresh peach slices to this and used mango salsa and it turned out great!

I'm always looking for low-calorie meals. Weightwatcher point-wise this figures to about 3 pts. If you serve it over sticky rice you can add 4 more.
I was impressed with this the first time I cooked it. The second time I substituted peach/mango salsa for the salsa and peach preserves.
I read a comment from islandprincess where she uses chicken in lieu of pork. That sounds like a good change of pace too.
In any case, I like the recipe.

It is my go to quick meal and I LOVE it! We have made it for large groups (larger than our family of 7) and when it was just the 2 of us. What's great about it besides the flavor and simplicity of it, is the flexibility of it. You can make it as spicy as you want it, as peachy as you want it, as thick or saucy as you want it. The amount of taco seasoning is up to you, the temperature of the salsa is up to you and the amount of sweetness is up to you. I don't even know the true amounts from the recipe, I just open a packet of seasoning, a jar of our favorite black bean & corn salsa and then add about 1/2 a jar of peach preserves. I've tried it over pork and chicken, both very good. I've only ever served it over rice and it's still yummy the next day, if there's any left! Try it, you'll be surprised!

Made this tonight and my Hubby's only complaint was that I didn't make enough rice to go with it.  This recipe is wonderful!   The kids are all out tonight so luckily we will have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I made this exactly as printed and my family and I thought it was really good.  I served it over rice and black beans.  I only gave it 4 stars because I would like to know what kind of salsa was used(like an example of a brand).  I ended up using a peach-pineapple salsa because the peach jam I found (and only one store carried it) didn't have any flavor.  I'm going to have to go to a local fruit orchard and get some REAL peach preserves and try this again.  But it was SO quick and easy.  Once I find the right brand of salsa and preserves, we will be eating this alot more often.

And I saw some people not give this very good reviews because it was too spicy but I used a mild taco seasoning and a mild salsa.  It had no bite to it at all, in fact is wasn't spicy enough for me so I chopped up some jalapeno and sprinkled it on top of mine so my kids could have mild and I could have spicy.

Thanks for a quick and filling meal!

Put taco seasoning in zip lock bag and shook it like a Shake N Bake.  Did not have peach preserves but instead had Harry and David (home made) onion pepper relish and substituted and it was delicious!

This is the top choice of my family for all the things I make! And best part, its super easy! I always chop the meat and mix it with the taco seasoning so it has more of a chance to soak in the flavor! I also change up the kinds of salsa I use!

This one needs a little work. I always make the recipe as written before I make adjustments. This really needs some salt, pepper, maybe a dash of cumin and a sour cream topping. If i make this again I will serve it with black beans and rice. This time I had it with just brown rice and that wasn't enough.

Super easy and tasty recipe! I used 3 pork chops, as that is what I had on hand and used a bit more of the peach preserves as well for a more fruity flavor. Will make again, but will probably double the amount of sauce since it tasted great over brown rice.

Easy and delicious. Everyone in my family likes this -- my sometimes-picky husband, my often-picky toddler, and myself. I serve it with black beans and brown rice. Still trying to find the best salsa to use (I did not think the smokiness of a chipotle-style mixed well with the peach flavor at all). For those who like it, a dollop of sour cream with each serving is divine.

Very good recipe! Like many others, I used a jar of peach & mango salsa and I also mixed in a couple cans of black beans (next time I think I will try pinto beans instead). Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe the other night. Because of a supper-hour commitment, I made up the pork (loin) and the sauce earlier then cooked it after it was in the fridge about 2 hours.WOW! Perfect out of the recipe box - I will not change a thing. My wife, who shuns "spicy" foods, loved it too.

Awesome...everyone loved it, although there was only enough for 3 of us.  No leftovers.  I, too, did not have peach preserves and used a single serve cup of fruit w/ juice and a couple of tablespoons of sugar and simmered on stove and then added salsa.  Serve w/ a dolup of sour cream.. Wonder, quick and easy.

This was just okay.  However, I think that the taste can easily vary based upon the salsa that you choose, so I'm planning on giving it another chance since so many other reviewers really liked it.  I used 1.5 lb pork loin with one package of taco seasoning, which seemed like a good balance, and, the meat was very tender. I think that I may try this again with a different salsa.  I just used Pace chunky.  Perhaps a chipotle salsa would be better.

This was pretty good, it had a different flavor but in a good way. I'm always trying to find different good recipes for pork. I'll make this again, but I don't know if it will be a regular meal here.

This is so good and easy.  After seasoning and browning the pork (I cut pork chops into cubes), I combined the ingredients in a small crockpot for a couple of hours.  My husband does not especially like pork.  However, when he tasted it he said, "I'll never want pork chops again.  This is great."  I served it over white rice.  Even our 12-year-old son had seconds!
