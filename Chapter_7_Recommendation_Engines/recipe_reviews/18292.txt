Changed things up a bit here. Marinated about a pound of fresh asparagus in a ziploc for about 20 minutes with olive oil, balsamic vinagrette, garlic (from the jar) and shallots. Grilled on low for about 12 minutes. Sprinkled with a little kosher salt. Easy & so yummy!

I did tons of shortcuts on this recipe and I don't think it mattered one bit as to the outcome. I toasted some French baquette slices. Pluse some minced garlic in the olive oil and brushed the top of the bread. For the asparagus, I marinated in some bottled balsamic vinegarette and then grilled. I love grilled asparagus. Next time, I might put some cheese on the toasts and then add the asparagus.

This recipe worked well served at room temp. I boiled the asparagus the night before, tossed it in a plastic bag with the dressing and let it sit until the next night in the fridge. I simply let the asparagus come to room temp in the bag, plated it up and set it on the dinner table. I used the dressing left in the plastic bag to dress a simple salad. Everything was superb!!!

This took me a bit longer to make than I had expected, but it was wonderful. Everyone thought this was the best asparagus they had ever tasted!

This was a great way to do asparagus with the following modifications: 2tbsps of EVOO with 1 tbsp of both balsamic and red wine vinegars. I also omitted the bread (better to fill up on extra veggies). Thnaks for the recipie.

This is kind of a funny little recipe. The marinade/dressing is wonderfull with both the asparagus and the garlic bread, but you're sort of left wondering why you are making both of them and what their connection is to one another - until you start eating it. Then it all make a weird kind of sense. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I doubled the marinade sauce and cooked it on the grill in a rectangle cake pan and they turned out great.

I've made this several times, without the toast, and it is very good!  The only problem is fighting everyone off from eating them before they hit the grill!

Yummy!  I let the aspargus marinate overnight and also increased the vinegars to 1 tablespoon each and then added some garlic to the vinaigrette.  A nice, light flavor to complement the asparagus and not take over the meal.  I didn't even do the bread and garlic spread, though...can't wait to try that!

The asparagus part was good, the bread was ok. Most likely will make without the bread next time.

This was so yummy!  I did this in my grill pan inside.  The flavor in this is so awesome and I was so shocked how much I loved the asparagus served over bread!  Of course the garlic spread was great and full of flavor!  I am making this one again soon ;)

I only made the asparagus with the balsamic vinaigrette.  It was fabulous!  The flavor was wonderful.  I would like the try the whole recipe at some point but was in a bit of a hurry so just made the asparagus dish. Yummy!

This definitely isn't something you can just throw together for a quick dinner (next time I'll roast the garlic and prepare the marinade ahead of time).  But, it was AMAZING!  I'll definitely be making it again.

This is a great recipe! I make asparagus all the time and it's hard to find spices and seasonings that compliment it well. This is great. I made it once with the bread and every time after that just with the asparagus since everyone I cook for shuns the extra carbs. I pour the remaining marinade(warmed in the microwave) on the grilled spears right be before I serve them.

This is a recipe I will use a lot this summer for summer grilling! I did the garlic on the barbecue while I had other stuff cooking in double-lined foil packets and olive oil. When I did the asparagus I put them in foil packets on the grill, I don't have a veggie basket and I didn't want them falling in because I used skinny asparagus. They were done to perfection in less than 10 minutes--those suckers cook fast!

Will make 1 more attempt.  Problems: didn't read Ready In time or expect a minute veggie to take 1+ hr, cold asperagus while toasting bread, don't understand if aperagus is served on bread or how the bread comes in.  Bread was good despite cold garlic spread.  Asperagus, cold, limp, blackened left much to be desired.

I was a little lazy and didn't actually make the vinaigrette.  I just used a balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing.  Asparagus turned out great and loved by the entire family.

We love roasted garlic and balsamic vinegar so I was excited to try this recipe and am reviewing the asparagus only. While we enjoyed  the asparagus neither of us could detect any of the other flavours. My asparagus were a little smaller so I grilled them for a total of six minutes.
