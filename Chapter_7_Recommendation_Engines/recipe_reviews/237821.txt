My daughter was learning to cook, and chose this recipe. The proportions are ridiculous - nothing but oil, and really unappetizing.

2.5.16  Enjoyed this for lunch today on a salad of romaine, arugula, red cabbage, and fresh orange segments (only wish I'd had some fresh strawberries).  It just doesn't get much easier than this to whip up a nice vinaigrette.  It emulsifies well, has a very good balance of sweet-tart, and would be good on just about any fruit salad combo, as well.  I definitely would make this again.
