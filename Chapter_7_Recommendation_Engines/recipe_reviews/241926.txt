Made it this morning for breakfast for six teenagers and they gobbled it up. Luckily, there were two servings left, so I was able to get a taste. Its very good and was ready after 45 minutes baking. I used linked sausage, cut to bite sizes since I didn't have loose sausage on hand. Will be making again!

This is very good!  I used quick grits because that is what I had on hand so it did not take the full 20 minutes for them to thicken.  Next time I would reduce the fluid just a tiny bit (maybe 1/8 of  a cup) as I think they would set better if using quick grits.  This would also be fantastic with ham or bacon too or any combination of meats.  In the future, I may add a tiny bit of cheese to the top the last few minutes of baking.
I will definitely make this again.  It was a huge hit with my family.

Followed recipe as described. The grits/cheese mixture was great as I was making and I thought the finished product would be delicious. But the downside for me was the 1/2 cup of butter. I think the most needed would be 1-2 tbsp. When finished, the butter made the casserole runny and the taste way too rich. I'll try again, but next time with little or no added butter.

This is such a delicious way to make grits! All of the ingredients are perfectly balanced! I did add a touch of salt while cooking the grits and saved a bit of cheese to top the casserole. Baked perfectly in 45 minutes for me. Will be making this again! Would be great for company and brunch!

I made this recipe for my bible stud class and it was a huge hit. The casserole was very tasty, good texture and a hearty meal by itself. Very easy to make and I like being able to make ahead the night before actually cooking the dish. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is a great breakfast or brunch pot luck dish.  I've made it for work twice and everyone loves it.  I also add a touch of salt to the grits and sprinkle some cheese on top.  I like things a bit spicy so I either use hot sausage or add a little cayenne when I mix in the sausage.

We have had this every Christmas morning for the last 20 years - our sons expect it. I do use turkey sausage crumbles to save cleaning a skillet, and I add a tsp of dry mustard.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I couldn't find the stone ground grits so I just used the 2 1/2 minute quick grits.  So good.

Absolutely delicious and a huge hit for an office pitch-in.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Although some have commented on too much butter, grits and butter go together and it seemed just right to all of us.  Highly recommend!

I made this for a "breakfast for supper" meal. Very tasty! It made a larger batch than I expected, so plenty of leftovers. I was out of peppers, so I didn't add those, but I did add a chopped onion, which I cooked up with the sausage. I cooked the sausage in a 9-inch cast iron skillet, and then carefully added the cooked grits, cheese, and eggs to the pan and baked it in that instead of in a casserole dish, which saved a little on cleaning.

I loved finding an egg casserole that didn't use bread. I was a little concerned because none of my family members like grits but they all loved this and requested it again. I thought I had cheddar cheese on hand but ended up having to use a mixture of various shredded cheeses. Next time I will try using just cheddar, but the mix of cheeses was fabulous also.

I've had this recipe for now on 30 years. It never fails to be a hit. I would make it on Sunday for brunch then the rest if the week all my kids had to do was cut a slice warm in microwave and breakfast was On!

SO GOOD!!  Not too eggy like a lot of egg casseroles are. Next time I would add onion.
It says it takes 15 minutes to make, but the grits need to cook for 20. Plan on 30 minutes to make.
