This is my recipe, so let me add this to what I originally posted.  Ground bison emits a "juice" that isn't familiar to me with other ground meats. I don't know what it is. I DO know that I skim it away from the meatloaf and once that's done, it doesn't appear again... not even during reheating.  For those of you who've added to the recipe, I suspect the additions altered the chemistry. If the results were tasty, excellent! If not, you might want to try this recipe as posted, and alter it later, once you know what the original tastes like.   The quick summary is the ground bison behaves differently when baked than ground beef. I should have mentioned this in my original posting of the recipe. Sorry 'bout that.

Very good, I made them into mini-meatloaves, using a muffin tin. I'm impatient and don't like to have to wait the 1 1/2 hours to eat!

I ended up making this with half ground buffalo and half ground beef (didn't pay attention when taking it out of the freezer). I added some fresh garlic, and, like others, diced up the canned tomatoes a little more finely. The only other change I made was to mix some prepared English mustard with the ketchup. Although it crumbled when I cut into it, this was a very tasty meatloaf. Nice and moist too. Thanks!

Because Im "eating healthy" i modified this a bit and it still came out great. I used whole wheat breadcrumbs I (have also used a whole wheat pita all ground up before as well) and eggbeaters. I used 1/3 cup crushed tomatoes because I dont like tomato chunks and only 1/4 onion. Also I didnt add any salt. This was great and it stuck to my plan.

This is the first time I've cooked bison. This is an easy recipe that calls for few ingredients and tastes great. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe.  I used all antelope instead of buffalo.  I doubled the recipe but only used 1 can of diced tomatoes.  I didn't have mustard powder so I used a tablespoon of regular mustard.  It was good... the only thing I would do different is chop the the onions and tomatoes smaller.

WOOOOWWWW This is one of the best meatloafs!  Its simple, so you dont think it will be good, but its amazing.  Doesnt taste like buffalo at all.  My husband HATES bison/buffalo and I didnt tell him it was buffalo until AFTER he had devoured the entire pan, includng the planned leftovers.  He was amazed.  I will be making this many many times to come.  Might make a good burger patty too, albeit crumbly.  Oh, and you do have to drain off the grease but its no big deal.  I topped mine with Ketchup mixed with worcestershire and brown sugar.  Fantastic.

So moist!  We love the addition of the canned tomatoes, but do take the time to chop them smaller- some of the pieces were quite large! I used whole grain crackers in place of the bread, and added some flax and wheat germ.

I have to say this is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted. My fiance' made this for me and I think the only thing she did differently was to use bay leaves in it somehow. (I'm no cook and not one to get on a computer to make a review) But this is gooood.

I had never tasted buffalo meat before, but I found it in the grocery stores meat department and decided to try it.  I had no recipes so I search Allrecipes and found this one.  I am so glad I did!  This has to be the easiest meatloaf I have ever made.  The ingredient list is so simple, but the taste is out of this world!  Try this recipe you will not be disappointed!  I did substitute 1/3 cup oats for the sliced bread as I did not have multigrain bread and reduced the mustard powder to 1/2 teaspoon.   I will make this recipe again and again!

Delicious! I didn't have any mustard powder to hand, so added some standard yellow mustard (about 1 Tbsp); also, instead of a slice of bread, added about 1/3 c. plain breadcrumbs. Cooking time of 1.5 hrs was perfect - the adults and the 2-year-old gobbled it up in no time.

ok, i intended to make this exactly as written, but- OOPS!- i screwed up! i wasn't paying attention and added a whole can of diced tomatoes. i quickly scrambled and threw in extra breadcrumbs (as i didn't have multigrain bread) and hoped for the best. My hubby and kids ate it all, and begged for more asap! thanks so much for the recipe, and know it is fairly foolproof!

A solid recipe.  I did add 2 oz crumbled blue cheese to the mix, and increased the baking temp to 400 degrees for an hour, still let sit for 10 mins.  We enjoyed the flavor of this meatloaf and will definitely be making this again.

This was EXCELLENT, the best meatloaf I have ever made! The buffalo meat gave this meatloaf a sweet sort of flavor... usually in meatloaf I use brown sugar, but this time it wasn't needed. I would use just a pinch less of salt, but I think I am sensitive to salt as most foods seem salty to me. For this recipe I also dumped a can of tomato soup over the top before baking, and I put in about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. My whole family raved, this is my new go-to recipe for meatloaf!!

Great as is - Have made it several times with no changes to the recipe and it's a favorite.  Be careful not to bake for too long, the buffalo dries out easily.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe but instead of baking it in the oven I cooked it in the crockpot on low for 8 hours.   It did have the watery juice and I drained that off twice.  I was worried it my end up being dry, but it wasn't at all! My family loved it!  It stayed so moist and the all the leftovers were eaten!

I was excited to try buffalo I have made meatloaf with moose before.  This was the best meatloaf i have ever had. I was worried about how it would hold together being so lean but it held together just fine. The only change i made was instead of the bread i used 1/4 cup italian bread crumbs.  After dinner my boyfriend told me that he gets excited to come home at night to see what I have made...Cant wait to make this again!!!

This is the best meatloaf that I have made in a long time.  I decided to make the meatloaf in muffin cups.  Very moist and suprisingly flavorful.  Instead of the diced tomatoes I used crushed and I added green peppers.  Loved it!!  I also experienced the "juice" but I just drained it out.  Didn't effect the flavor.

This was sooo good- I don't even like meatloaf, but this had lots of good flavor to it.  I accidently mixed the ketchup in the meatloaf and then squirted it all over the top- I think it made it have a lot of flavor.  I'm going to make this again.

This is the best meatloaf ever!  I had never used buffalo meat before and wanted to try it.   There was a review earlier that said to drain off the fat before you finished cooking it then cook some more and then this was a very helpful suggestion!  This was the perfect recipe.  My family loved it!  I have made it several times and will add it to my favorites!!

OMG!!! This was awesome. We have heard that bison was better for you and we've had burgers and they were ok but NOTHING like this!! I did NOT tell my family it was bison until after they told me it was the best meatloaf ever. They won't lie cause they don't want something made over and over if they don't like it, :-). I HIGHLY recommend trying this recipe. I did it ALMOST exactly. It seems a little to running before I put it in the pan so I added another piece of bread crumbed up. It was perfect! Thank you SOOOO much. I would have NEVER thought of using bison in meatloaf and now I'm gonna end up using it in tacos, burgers and anything else calling for ground beef. :-D

I have a freezer full of bison, so I'm quite familiar with it. Ground bison is significantly less fatty than ground beef. That must be considered when using in any recipe, although bison can be substituted for beef in any recipe. It's ALWAYS better! As for the 'juice' mentioned in the author's post, I've never experienced that. I typically find that the only 'juice' I have is made up of the ingredients I've added. The bison I get from Niobrara Valley Bison is so lean that I sometimes add olive oil if I"m going to grill burgers. I can't say enough about switching from beef to bison. Rarely do I do anything with beef anymore.

I simply had to review this meatloaf. I had been given some ground buffalo that I had no idea what to do with, had been told so much about it and how different it was from ground beef and bla bla bla. I decided to try a meatloaf and found this recipe. The only change I made was adding garlic, as it's a favorite for my family, and this meatloaf was incredible! It was moist, full of flavor, and amazing! I'd give it 10 stars if I could, thank you so much for what promises to be a family fave!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Was tempted to do the worcesteshire (we love that flavor), but I usually try to make recipes as published the first time.  Seriously, would not change a thing.  Thanks for sharing!

I used regular ol' ground beef for this recipe and only used half an onion which was still too much for my 4 and 5 year old boys...though I thought it was pretty tasty!

This was good. Didn't have the canned tomatoes so we just skipped that part.  It could have used a little more flavor, so I'll experiment next time, but I will use this recipe again!

This was great the only problem I had was it was waaay watery. I don;t know if it was from the canned tomatoes or what. Also I didn't use a whole onion and I added 1/4 C of brown sugar to the ketchup. other than that it was delcious!

Followed the recipe exactly. It's a nice meatloaf. I like the tomatoes in it. Good idea. I didn't have trouble like other reviewers slicing it. Some said it crumbled, mine sliced like normal meatloaf. I also didn't have the "juice" the submitter talked about in her review. It all came out status quo. I must say though, if you've not had buffalo before, the texture looks a bit like cat food. Tastes pretty good though. I didn't find it gamey at all. Thanks for sharing ellenmoriah.

This was great! The only changes I made were using 1/4 dried quinoa cooked for 8 minutes in 1/2 cup water in lieu of breadcrumbs. I put meatloaf in bread pan and after 60 mins, I took out of the oven, drained liquid, and continued cooking. It was yummy and very healthy. Served alongside roasted brussel sprouts! My toddler loved it, too :-)

This was fabulous! My kids loved it. I used a can of petite diced tomatoes and finely diced the onions, as another reviewer recommended. I added 2 pcs of whole grain bread, instead of 1. Very moist, cooked quickly in my convection oven. Will definately make again! Thanks for the recipe!

So simple, yet delicious!  I cooked the meatloaf in a muffin tin which allowed me to easily freeze the leftovers.  The buffalo meat results in a sweeter and very moist meat with much less fat unlike beef.  I LOVED IT!

Very tasty meatloaf. Even my picky 3 year old loved it! I didn't have diced tomatoes so I used cut up stewed Italian tomatoes and also added some Worcestshire sauce to it. Excellent - will definitely make again.

This was really good. I did drain the tomatoes but I still found there was liquid in the pan when the loaf was done. Could have partly been fat (I used ground beef). I just poured it out, the loaf was unaffected by that liquid. It was super good and really moist because of all the tomatoes. I also put a sprinkle of caraway seed in mine which was nice.

We've eaten buffalo/bison for about 10 years. It's about the same price as ground beef, but sweeter. I have eliminated the problem of the funky juices by learning from Julia Child. Always dry your meat. I put several pieces of paper towel in a colander and allow the meat to lose all of that moisture. I also add Worcestershire Sauce and for 2 lbs. of bison I add some tomato paste, a can of small diced tomatoes, a small onion, egg, etc. Bison is one of the best meats out there. Hope this helps someone. Hearty Appetite!!

This was absolutely delicious.  My package of ground buffalo contained 1.25 pounds.  I used two slices of bread, one can of drained rotel tomatoes and I added two cloves of minced garlic -- otherwise, all measurements were exactly as in recipe, although I only baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  It sliced up beautifully and everyone enjoyed it!  This will be my go-to recipe for cooking ground buffalo from now on.

This was my first time making meatloaf and it was absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves so I would have meals for the week. When I took this for lunch, my coworker asked me what smelled so good. I'm definitely this one again and again and again :)

huge hit in our family! I accidentily forgot to drain the tomatoes so I added 1 cup of quick oats to help soak up the juice, and a second egg to help the oats bind to the meatloaf. I also diced a green pepper and added it because I didn't want it to go to waste. This recipe made a huge meatloaf, enough to comfortably serve 8. Serious bargain meal with great flavor.

The is the best meatloaf I have had. SO much flavor. I did vary a bit...

I substituted diced tomatoes for roasted red peppers. I added about a tablespoon of olive oil and I added about a tablespoon of (fresh) rosemary. YUM, YUM, YUM

I used rotel tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes.  I also added red pepper and tossed some Pensey's alpeppo pepper on top.  Fantastic.

this was pretty good, but a little dry - probably because bison has basically no fat. i made a couple of very small changes: i used double fiber whole wheat bread (it was what i had), and i made it into four individual loaves (easier leftovers.) i will probably give it a little bit of spicing up when i make it again.

I followed the recipe as written only I microwaved the meatloaf in a tupperware microwavable dish for 20 minutes, let it set for 5 minutes.  I put the ketchup on it after It came out of the microwave.   It was delicious and I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a great bison recipe.

Mushrooms and v8 instead of diced tomatoes, a little garlic and barbecue seasoning. Used sage dressing mix for bread. We liked it!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had.  I am not a big fan of meatloaf but I had some ground bison so I decided to try this. Wow was I surprised!  I will make this again!

Yum!! Juicy and delicious.  I made the recipe exactly as written, except that I baked it in muffin tins (as someone else suggested) for 25 min.  I even won over my skeptical husband.  My picky 8 year old ate it in a bun and called it a cheese burger.  He even asked for seconds, which he never does.

This is easy, and amazing.  I didn't have, of all things, canned tomatoes, so I drained a 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes and chilis, and used that instead.  It was fantastic. The slight sweet taste of the ketchup was marvelous against the spice of the Rotel.  I baked it in my microwave convection oven, 30 minutes at 350 and 25 at 325.  Perfect.  I will definitely make this again.

We absolutely loved this!  We are a meat and potatoes type couple, but we're always trying to find ways to eat more healthy and try something new.  We were thrilled that our local butcher had/has buffalo on hand and we're happy to now throw this in the mix for dinner!  Thanks again!!

I'd never cooked with buffalo before - this was the perfect starter recipe!
Combining a bunch of other recipes here:
Substituted quick oats (like Mom!) for bread, spicy brown mustard instead of powdered, and just a sprinkle of salt.
Cooked in mini loaf pans for 45 minutes.
It crumbled instead of sliced. I didn't care. :)
Thank you, Ellen!

I substituted ground bison with ground venison. It turned out great. It was flavorful without overpowering the wild meat taste.

This was really good! The only change I made was to use panko breadcrumbs instead of a piece of bread.  Mine didn't cut into slices like a regular meatloaf, it kind of all crumbled up.  To be honest, it looked like dog food on the plate, but it was yummy, and 3 of us ate the whole loaf!

We loved this! To be honest my husband and I had to literally STOP ourselves from going back for more! We eat very healthy for the most part and this was a great dinner. Also Buffalo meat is high in amino acids & very low in fat!!Because my husband is allergic to wheat I substituted about 1.5 cups of crispy brown rice cereal for the bread, and I used only 1/2 t. salt. Added a chopped red pepper I had on hand and topped it with the ketchup with some brown sugar and a dab of spicy red pepper sauce. It did not hold together very well (because of the rice cereal substitute I had to use) but it was NO problem! I formed it as well as I could and placed it in the pan. It cut pretty well...and it was DELICIOUS! I will make this 1x a week during the colder months!
