I made a few substitutions but my husband really enjoyed the end result!  To reduce the fat and sodium content, I made my own spicy pork sausage using a recipe submitted by Erika on AllRecipes.com and used Northern White Beans instead of butter beans (which my hub doesn't care for).  The recipe was easy to "lighten up" by purchasing low-fat, low-sodium canned baked beans and low-sodium BBQ sauce.  To further reduce the fat, I simply browned the meats, then drained, and rinsed with really hot tap water before turning back into the skillet.  The best part was, my hub had two helpings and never noticed a thing missing!  Thanks for a keeper.

This was even better than I thought it would be!  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  The sausage and baked beans added a sweetness to the meal that I really liked.  My husband put cheese and tortilla chips on top to make nachos.  I served it with Golden Sweet Cornbread found on allrecipes.  Perfect Super Bowl meal!

This wouldn't be one I'd serve to company (obviously) but overall this was cheap, quick and easy, and tasted good... three attributes that I generally look for in new recipes.  I served this with Paula Deen's Corn Casserole.  Everything was very filling, and in my estimation this dish would make for a kid friendly dinner.  I did not use butter beans, I used great northern beans.  I will keep this one in my file for those instances where I'm trying to stretch a dinner out with a not so elastic budget.

My mother called this recipe "Hobo Casserole"  she only used baked beans, ground beef, wor, ketchup, onions,and handful of minute rice.  We always knew it was close to payday when we had this, because money was tight!

Really good recipe! When I make this again, I'll saute the onion and garlic in with the beef and sausage, then drain off the grease.  It wasn't easy to cook the onion in a dry pan without grease.

My husband just made this for me.   I tastes like someone cleaned out their cabinets and tossed a bunch of random ingredients into a pot and called it a recipe.

Mmmmm.  This will warm you up on a chilly day.  Great flavor.  Used a spicy BBQ sauce for more heat, though it mellowed after sitting a day or so.

I recently made these beans for a family reunion. There was not a bite left, and several people asked for the recipe. Will definitely make it again!

I made this for my son's birthday party with the family.  It was very good and there wasn't a drop left over!  I used ground turkey because we don't normally eat ground beef.  (No one even noticed!)  I cooked as directed with everything else.  The only other change I made was that I transferred everything into a baking dish and placed in the oven at 375 for about 30 min. to finish it off instead of the stove top.
