It was real good!  I went with 1 can cream of mushroom and  one can of cream of chicken.  I wanted to use canned green beans instead.  I used three drained cans.  If you like them real creamy, this was the right amount but I could have easily added another can into the mix.  Very easy!  Enjoy!

Tried this for potluck at work and it came out great!  Used Jackie's alterations with one can each cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup, along with 4 cans of green beans (drained) - just the right amount of sauce w/o being too soupy. I also added about 1 t soy sauce and a dash of garlic to the recipe.  Freshly grated parmesan added a nice flavor.  Cooked on LOW about 5 hours.  This dish was a real hit and so easy.  I will definitely be making this one again and again.  Thanks Hollus2!

I was hesitant about doing a green bean casserole in a crock pot, but this was amazing!  I follow the recipe, except for adding some soy sauce to it.  I even added a tiny bit of Italian seasoning like she said in her comments.  I received many compliments on this recipe, everyone went back for seconds and thirds.  I also used extra fine frozen green beans.  I think they created the perfect texture.  
This recipe is perfect!

This is a good recipe. I initially made with four cans of drained green beans and 2 soup as listed, and thought it was too soupy. I was making for a big work potluck so added 2 more cans of green beans and 1 more cream of mushroom and this time just a splash of milk. Potluck attendees ate the entire crock pot full and I got a lot of compliments. I used a bit of chopped fresh garlic and worcestershire sauce and would make this again for sure - using less milk than called for. A winner!

This was great and everyone at thanksgiving agreed (even the picky eaters)! I made some changes based on comments. I used frozen french cut green beans but I THAWED them first and then drained off all the water so the end result wouldn't be too soupy. I used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken. Went with whole milk - only 1/2 cup and used freshly grated parm. Also added one minced garlic clove. 4 hours on low was plenty of time to heat everything through. It was the absolute perfect consistency and so delicious!

I've made this a few times for holidays and my guests loved it each time as did I!  The first time I made it as is and it was very, very good.  I made a few changes and the most recent ones were the best for our taste.  I added sautéed Baby Bella mushrooms s(about 1 cup sliced) along with about 1/2 cup of chopped onions.  I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup, added 1/2 t onion and 1/2 t garlic powder, 1 t Italian seasoning (as was recommended by others, and omitted the salt.  I also added an additional 1/2 cup parmesan cheese at the very end.  To be honest, I will probably not add the fried onions next time and add additional sautéed onions.  We only had 5 people for dinner and there was very little left over.  Great recipe and very easy!!!

This is a great version of a classic recipe! It's one of my favorite dishes for the holidays and I love that this makes so much. The parmesan cheese is a nice touch and doing this in the slow cooker frees up space in the oven for other yummy dishes!

Made this to carry to Easter dinner, I fried some bacon ends and added a few baby bella mushrooms to the mix with 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken. The crockpot was emptied and liked by all. I will use the two cans of cr of chicken soup next time though because it is a bit more moist.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner - a traditional side dish for our family.  It was good, but if I make it again in the crock pot, I'm cutting back on the soup and/or milk, (and will probably switch back to the traditional mushroom soup rather than the cream of chicken) as it was far more liquid-y than the regular oven baked version.  I did add Worcestershire sauce and extra parmesan.  Overall, it was good, but unless I'm short on oven space, I'll probably go back to the traditional oven recipe.

I was playing with the quantities because I had already bought four-12 oz. bags of French Cut Frozen Green Beans. I added two cans of Campbell's Cream of Chicken Soup and approximately two cups of milk. I only had 1/2 a cup of Parm. Cheese total. I did not add the 1/2 cup of Crispy Onions at the beginning of cooking - instead liberally sprinkled Onion Powder and some Granulated Garlic and mixed well!
This came out GREAT - but too soupy - or too much liquid, which was my fault. At the end of the 5 hour cook time, I used a slotted spoon to take the green beans out of my "soup" and put the green beans in a 13X9 Pyrex and then added Crispy Onions on top and put the whole thing under the broiler for 1 minute. Next time, I will ease up on my milk and it will be perfect! They tasted amazing and NO ONE noticed that it was Cream of Chicken soup and not Cream of Mushroom. Thanks for the recipe. It really helped with Christmas Eve dinner in that I only have one oven! Adding to my Recipe Box!

This was PERFECT for Thanksgiving. We make Green bean casserole for the holidays but we needed our stove space along with our oven space for the turkey and other sides so using the crock pot was the BEST idea ever. I did tweak it a bit. Instead of two bags of green beans, I used one 24 ounce bag of the frozen green beans, and I also used instead of the two cans of cream of chicken and milk I used the Progresso creamy mushroom soup and due to the soup being a creamier kind then the condensed I left out the milk. I kept the rest of the ingredients, and I also added onion powder and garlic powder. It was PERFECT, when it was ready to come out we had a little bit of it to tide us over until the turkey was done, and my mother and I decided while I have a green bean casserole recipe for the rest of the year, THIS one will be our permanent holiday casserole recipe.

Thank you so much for this recipe! My mom is 76 years old and still lives alone ( for now) she stopped cooking and would only eat cereal and sandwiches. We of course take food to her as well. But I bought her a small crock pot and have been teaching her easy recipes. I downsized the recipe to suit her slow cooker. We added some cubed chicken so she would have a complete meal. She loved it!!!! Thank you bunches for the smile on my mom's face. She cooked it by herelf :)

I made this last night for my fiancé. She didn't think a green bean casserole could be made in a crock pot. I let it cook all day, came home to it, sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top and threw it in the oven for a few minutes while our chicken cooked. The cheese crisped up and it was a great topping in addition to the french-fried onions. The only thing I would change is the amount of salt. Mine was a tad salty but the next time I cook it, I will definitely tone it down a little. Great recipe!

I saw all the great reviews so I had to give it a try.  I made it for a Thanksgiving potluck at work.  Two others brought a green bean casserole.  This one was gone in twelve minutes.  It fed a lot of people but it was the go-to casserole today.
I will make it again and for this years family Thanksgiving meal.

This recipe is so much better than the traditional green bean casserole.  I never cared for green beans with soy sauce (traditional recipe) but I love the parmesan cheese in this recipe.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Prepared it on Thanksgiving Day and it was a hit with everyone.  Cooking this recipe in the crockpot frees up the oven. By starting it early in the day I could forget about it and concentrate on other dishes I was preparing. Thanks so much.

Just as good, if not better, than the oven method.  I used 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom.  I only had about 1/4 cup of cheese, but it still tasted great.  I let it cook for 5 hours total (on low), with the lid cracked during the last hour, because it looked too soupy.

I love green bean casserole, but next time I would probably try baking it instead of using the slow cooker. I would also double the green beans and use 1/3 of the cream of chicken.

Ditto, I looked for a slow cooker recipe and this was the one that I found. I also used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom. I substituted the milk with heavy whipping cream (c'mon its Thanksgiving), as well as Lawry's seasoned salt for plain salt. Lastly, for some extra flavor, I cooked up 4 slices of bacon and added them, along with a tablespoon of bacon grease. I searched for a slow cooker recipe because it was easier to transport and keep fresh and hot for a work potluck. This was perfect.

Subbed cream of chicken soup with 2 cans cream of mushroom, making it vegetarian. Wonderful recipe and it's nice not having to use the oven for one more dish on Thanksgiving!

This was delicious and super easy to make. I used three 12oz bags of frozen beans and added onion powder and Italian seasonings per other reviews. The crock pot was literally scraped empty at a potluck of 30+ guests. Should have doubled the recipe??

The best green bean casserole my family and I have ever had! And I was so glad there was no last minute work! I just took the lid off of the cooker and sprinkled more onions on top, and it was ready. No fuss! There is usually a lot of this casserole left over, but not this time. It was a hit!

I don’t think this tastes as good as the traditional recipe with canned green beans but if you are in need of oven space it is ALMOST just as good.  I doubled the recipe for a large gathering and it fit nicely in a 6 quart crockpot.  Initially I thought it would be too full, but it cooked down considerably.   I think it is necessary to have frozen green beans instead of canned for the crockpot so it doesn’t get mushy or soupy.  And mine turned out the perfect consistency with the recipe written as is.  There is NOT too much milk and I don’t know how anyone would suggest that unless they altered the recipe by using canned beans.  I did use half mushroom soup and half chicken soup.  I did add a few teaspoons of soy sauce.  I will DEFINITELY make this again any time I want oven space or to prepare a dish well in advance!  I also found it better to cook on HIGH for 4 hours instead of low, stirring every now and then, and adding the onions on top at the end when serving.

eh... it was ok. I liked how easy it was, but based on the reviews I added more soy sauce. I think fresh green beans would be best with this but I didn't have time to cook them.

I was asked to bring this to my husband's family's get-together, and panicked when our oven broke.  Luckily I found this recipe. Although I had worries about this turning out soggy, it didn't.  It was perfect.  I just brought the extra french fried onions along to the hosts' home, popped it in their oven for a few minutes and served.  It was a hit!

I made this twice to check it out for Thanksgiving.  Definitely going to make it on the big day.  I was looking for a new and interesting way to make green beans and this is it.  Very good and easy to make on a busy cooking day.  Goes in the crock pot and forget it while you make everything else.  YUM!

This is an amazing recipe!  I have made it several times, and I add one thing:  Roasted Chestnuts!  They're the ones from Costco, and I slice them into halves or thirds and put them in at the beginning.  It adds a unique, rich-testing element.

This was yummy and a nice dish to bring to Thanksgiving to not hog precious oven space.  I used French cut frozen green beans.  Next time I might toast of the French fried onions as they got soggy immediately.

We had limited oven space this Christmas so I gave this a try. It went really well. Only change was 1 can of chicken and 1 can of mushroom. Otherwise followed the recipe given. Cheese added a nice flavor. Thanks!

I'm not much for green Bean casseroles but had to make one for a Christmas dinner for 30. Tried this one.  Easy to make but the cream of chicken soup just did nothing for it. Only about half of the batch was eaten. Didn't really see many going back for seconds.  Like I said easy to make but not to my liking.

Great way to save oven space. This dish is a family tradition, and this version got great reviews. for Thanksgiving. I used 32 oz. frozen cut beans as called for but used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, plus 7 or 8 fresh mushrooms, sliced and half a fresh onion, chopped. Cooked on low for about 6 hours and left the lid off after adding the French's onion rings, as suggested by some readers. I won't bother using oven again as this was just as good!

I made this for a work potluck since I didn't want to fuss with warming up a casserole dish and WOW it was so good! My coworkers scraped the crockpot clean and were raving. I did make some of the recommendations that were mention due to my personal preference. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. And I used three cans of cut green beans, drained. Cooked for 3 hours on high. Topped crispy onions 20 minutes before serving. It was AWESOME. Thank you for the crazy good recipe!

I was pressed into throwing Thanksgiving dinner together due to a death in the family.  I made this in the interest of time, needing oven space and trying to help a grieving family.  It was great.  I made no changes.  I used a cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup because that's what I had.  We fed 14 people, which was more than enough with all the other food.  When we  heated leftovers, I added more fried onion and baked it.  Even yummier!

I created and altered recipe based off of others reviews. I used 4 cans of green beans with no salt added, 1 can cream of chicken soup, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 tsp of garlic powder and soy sauce, and 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese with the onions. I added the rest of the onions on top 1/2 hour before the casserole was done cooking. There was only one spoonful left in the crock pot.  I will make this again but I may try frozen beans.

I made this but when I got all my stuff to put it together, I didn't have but on can of soup.  So I made a white gravy for the other can.  Don't do that.  It was too bland.  Everyone liked it but I didnt.  It really would have been good if I had the 2 soups.

This is the first rating I've given on this site. Made the recipe exactly as described. I had a mountain of fresh green beans from the garden and was looking for a way to get those used up. This recipe was the perfect way. Everybody loved it but a couple people thought that swapping out one can of cream of chicken with one can of cream of celery would add an additional level to the flavor.  Great recipe!

Cook time is way too long. Luckily I made another batch that my oven knocked out in 30 minutes. The recipe itself is good. Watch out for that cook time.

Very handy when you are having a large crowd for dinner and only have one oven.  I used the recipe as is and everyone loved it!  Thank you.

This is so easy and great!  I am not that fond of a strong onion taste in anything and used half shoestring potatoes & half French-fried onions.  I always use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom for my oven version.  The parm was a surprising addition that everyone loved.

This was absolutely delicious and saved me time and space in the kitchen to cook this in a crockpot.  I will do this everytime from now on.

I made the recipe as it was written.  It seemed like a good idea on Thanksgiving when my oven was being used for the turkey.  I was disappointed with the flavor and texture.  It was too soupy.  It was not good and I don't plan on making it again. Making the green bean casserole the traditional way is much better.

Absolutely delicious.  I halved the recipe for my husband and myself.  I wanted to try it out before making it for Oscar night.  Otherwise I followed the recipe with the edition of 1/2 tsp. onion powder, garlic powder and Italian seasoning as others suggested. A keeper for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for a church pot luck and it was a hit.  I stayed right with the ingredients as I do the first time with every recipe as to be able to truly rate the recipe.  The only thing I did different was I baked it instead of crock pot.  I think this helped with the runnyness. No need to cut back on milk this way.  The reason for the 4 is that I could see it being runny if in a crock pot due to it being closed top and frozen beans...to much water and also I would have liked just a little more flavor.  The chicken soup thought made me wonder a little but it worked.  Next time I'll probably add some onion powder like many had mentioned doing in former reviews.

This dish is so bland and flavorless, it might be the worst thing I ever tasted. The green beans are overcooked, the texture is soupy, even the crispy onions do nothing to save this tasteless mess. Tossed it!

I’ve never made this in the crockpot and it’s so much easier! I didn’t have two cans of cream of chicken soup, but I did have a can of cream of mushroom. One can of each, mix it up and it is awesome! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made 4lbs of fresh green beans for Easter Dinner. Added Italian seasoning mix, Worcestershire Sauce & fresh mushrooms in addition to the recipe. I used Cream of Chicken & Mushroom Soup (the combined flavor). Great depth of flavor & delicious! Served 15 adults & a few young children with enough left over for people to take home in their doggie bags & leaving us about a serving & a half left. Will definitely be my go-to recipe for Green Bean casserole!

Taste was great.  It was a bit watery after cooking but seemed to thicken overnight.  Went with Cream of Mushroom soup to keep it vegetarian.

Made this for Thanksgiving and the family really liked it. The two year old went back for thirds.  Very easy and the crock pot was very convenient.  Would make again, and I added soy sauce and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.

A very easy recipe to make.  The slow cooker is the only way to go with this recipe.  you add the ingredients, put it into the cooker set it to low and forget about it.  Comes out perfect.

You can also use different varieties of soup too, like mushroom, or celery, etc.  Gives it a little different flavor

Made without any changes. The vegetable dish came out very good. It was nice that I was able to mix everything up,  stick it in a crockpot and leave it until I was ready to serve.   Would probably add a bit more seasoning next time - and I definetly will make again

Very good! I cut the recipe in half (there are only three of us for Thanksgiving this year),  and used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. I also cut the cooking time down by an hour and a half. The only problem is they came out a little mushy. We have a very tiny oven here in Miami, so using the crock pot is a great idea to save space!

I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. I like to use French style green beans. I will definitely do this again. Great way to free up the oven space. The liners work great!

This was great at Thanksgiving, because I needed my pots and bowls for other things. I used 2 big cans of green beans (only because I had already purchased them) and I used mushroom soup because I already had that too. This was soooo good. And super easy so I had time for everything else. Thank you!

5 hours was way too long on low for this dish. Maybe 2-3 hours would have been perfect.

This was very good.  However, I did not use a large enough crockpot so was only able to put in 1 bag of green beans.  I will make this again.

I did 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of mushroom. Right before serving, I added crispy bacon crumbled up and stirred everything. Then added other half of fried onions. Everyone liked it.

This was a really good and simple recipe to make for my Thanksgiving Dinner.  The only change I made was using fresh green beans trimmed and snapped.  I boiled them first until Al Dente and then placed them in the Crock-Pot with diced onions, garlic and the rest of the ingredients listed.  Worked perfectly because my oven was being used cooking other dishes for dinner.

Made a double batch for Thanksgiving.  Taste great but definitely way too soupy. I'll try it again but will cut the soup added in half

very good. was extremely nervous about adding the parmesan cheese to a classic but once it was all said and done I didn't really notice it. I did notice it when I tasted it about 2 hours before being done. I used 4 cans of French green beans drained, 2 cans cream of mushroom and the rest the same. will definitely do crock pot method again. adding to my favs. thanks!

I did 6 cans of french cut green bean and 2 cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  I sauteed 1 lb baby bella mushrooms and added 1 cup hand grated parm cheese half mixed in and half on top.  I also added 1 tbsp soy sauce, 3/4 cup milk,  few dashes of italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.  I did a total of 6oz of fried onions spit as the recipe recommends.   It was good.

I make this sort of recipe, my changes are chicken broth instead of creamy soup and a half pound of fried hamburger

This is served .on either white or brown rice and I like to add soy sauce for a touch of saltiness.

My MIL found this in a women's magazine from the 50's or 60's. Its a great go - to weekday dinner.

Excellent! I love that I can have green bean casserole without taking up oven space/time... When you're making Sunday dinner for a crowd, that oven becomes valuable real estate! ;) I use cream of mushroom soup and add a pinch or two of garlic power and a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and it's a smash hit every time! :)

I attempted to make this gluten free by just skipping the french friend onions.  I had them on the side for my non-GF friends to top after serving.  I found that it was too watery... I'm guessing that's because I didn't add the onions during the main cook cycle (the breading would have absorbed water & starched the whole thing up).  So next time I will try by not adding the extra milk, just use the condensed soup straight up.

I only used the recipe as a guide for using my slow cooker. I used cut, whole, canned green beans, added a table spoon of Worcestershire sauce and a 1/8th tsp of onion powder. Also, I didn't add the parmesan cheese. It was wonderful.

Big hit at both family gathering and work pitch in.  The parmesan cheese adds a nice touch to the flavor.  Good twist to an old favorite.

So easy, and tasty, great for potlucks and family gatherings.  Made it twice, once for a potluck  and then again for the family.  Added a little more liquid than the recipe calls for as well as a little more Parmesan cheese.  Also some Herbes de Provence.

I needed a slow cooker recipe for Thanksgiving and this was perfect.  I used 1 can cream chicken and 1 can cream mushroom with 5 cans of French style green beans.  Because everyone said it turned out runny I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and added 2 tsp of soy sauce. Instead of topping with onions I used 2 cups crushed cornflakes with melted butter divided and put 1/2 in with the green beans and 1/2 on top about 20 min before serving.  My crockpot tends to be hot so I also reduced the heating time to 2 hours.

SO GOOD AND EASY. Doesn't get any better than "throw everything in the crockpot and turn on". I'd recommend adding more pepper than the recipes calls for, but I love me some black pepper.

This was delicious! I had to use the mushroom soup to please my traditional family, but very eager to try the original version posted. Tilting the lid at the end takes care of any excess sauce-- adding the onion ring topper when ready to serve.  Awesome leftovers!!

I made this for our Christmas lunch at work, and it was a so delicious.  I had to run back to save the last few servings for my daughter because it was almost gone.  Last time I made green bean casserole in oven (another recipe), it turned up dry, therefore, crockpot is the best way to go with this recipe.  Very easy to make.
