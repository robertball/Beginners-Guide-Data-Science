I used arugula rather than spinach (I had everything else on hand), and that was the only major change I made.  The olive oil I used was lemon olive oil, and I used leftover beer butt chicken rather than grilled.  I toasted the pine nuts (put them in a pan on stovetop in low heat until barely browned).  We thought this was delicious.  The only thing I would worry about would be that there wasn't enough of that wonderful dressing.  I'm not sure because I made such a small batch and we didn't even eat all of that, but I would want a little more dressing than it called for, so maybe a recipe and a half of that?  It'd be good on any other salad, so that would work for me!  Thanks for a great salad, EMILIEWASMYEVE!

This was the perfect recipe to use up a few things in the fridge.  I used more pasta and less spinach, left out the chicken and made only half the dressing.  Very Good.

I have made this a dozen times and everyone always loves it and asks for the recipe. I use farfalle instead of orzo and I leave out the chicken because I typically serve it as a side dish to some other protein. Tastes best when made the night before, really let’s the dressing sink in! Best pasta salad ever!

I made this almost exactly as written and my family and myself loved it.  The only thing I left out was the sugar to to diabetes.  Great recipe that keeps well as leftovers.

Wow, a delicious salad!  I thought the amount of balsamic vinegar would make the dressing too strong, but I added it to taste and the favors were just right.  I ate this for 3 days straight!

Made as written except I didn't add the pine nuts. The dressing is very good, although I was the only one who used it. The rest of the gang ate this without.
