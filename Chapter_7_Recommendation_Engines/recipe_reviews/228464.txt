I tried this one as part of a challenge and glad that I did! I used Farro that I got from the missing ingredient site here in Canada and followed the steps pretty much to the letter... but did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the sugar in the final step. This has a very nice taste and you only need to serve a small amount as it is very rich. The whip cream balances the flavors and the almonds add a nice texture. Fresh raspberries added anther dimension and some color to the presentation.

This recipe is great! Everyone thought that my mother-in-law made it at our Slava. My daughter loves it... It's a dessert that I don't feel bad giving her.

Easy to make clear directions. My mother used to spend hours making this. Got many compliments on a taste.
