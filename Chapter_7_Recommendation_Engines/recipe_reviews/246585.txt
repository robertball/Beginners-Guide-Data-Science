I loved this recipe.  I made three batches for a birthday party.  I didn't use the lemon in the frosting, but made a basic cream cheese frosting and they were a huge hit!  I was concerned that the shredded carrots would overpower the dish because it looked like a ton, but they cook down perfectly so the recipe is correct.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on!

Delicious and easy. We used the zest from 1 lemon instead of the lemon extract and it was really good.

I loved this recipe, instead of making the frosting I used a can of cream cheese frosting and added the lemon juice to it, and it turned out great.

These cupcakes were delicious. I made them exactly but didn't make the frosting because I had cream cheese frosting leftover from another recipe. They were very easy to make.

I am only rating the cupcakes as I didn't make the frosting. Everyone loved them. I didn't have the McCormick brand products but I did have Mexican vanilla and went with that. These cupcakes are very flavourful and moist. Thanks!!

I substituted vanilla in for the lemon in the frosting, but the cupcakes were delicious! Just the right amount of spice.

To improve this recipe, soak 1/2 c currants in hot water prior to pre-heating oven, then drain and add these and 1 c chopped walnuts to processed carrots (make sure you process 1 lb carrots yourself so they will have a lot of moisture to contribute to the recipe) prior to combining these with dry ingredients. Replace 1 c of ap flour with 1 c of ww flour, and replace 1c granulated sugar with 1 c (packed) dk brown sugar. Your cup cakes will be denser, and more moist than the original recipe.  Bake in a 325F oven for 30 minutes.

I cut back on the oil by about 1/8 of a cup. I was a little worried that these would be dense by the  gummy look of the batter. I did use Red Mill pastry flour. I will review this again next time I make it. The flavor was great but I like a little more intense. The frosting was nice, but I didn't make it lemony.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Very good but a little to oily for my taste, I will definitely use this recipe again but cut down on the oil, and perhaps add some raisins and walnuts, but very good flavor.

These are really easy and straightforward to make, and they're pretty tasty! The only thing I changed was that I didn't put lemon in the frosting. Also, I made them without a mixer or anything, so to all the 20-somethings with understocked kitchens, this recipe is very doable.

It made 24 cupcakes and enough frosting to frost 36 cup cakes.  I think the only thing to make it better would be to add lemon juice and lemon zest to the cream cheese frosting. But it was REALLY good.

Great recipe - enjoyed the lemon addition to the cream cheese frosting. Easy to make and works well to half the recipe if only wanting to make one dozen instead of two. Definitely recommend this for anyone who loves carrot cake, but wants to switch it up a bit.
