2.12.20 ..'Made a 9x5 loaf rather than minis.  I decreased sugar to 1c in the bread part & felt it could still be reduced.  The cream cheese part is on the dry side & quite a bit of it.   I like the idea of this better than the result.

This bread is amazing. I made it in pretty Christmas glass pans and gave them to co workers it was a big hit. Will definitely make it again.
