This makes for a lovely summer lunch!  I added an extra red bell pepper, and had to use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I also decreased the pasta by half, and next time I will add even more vegetables.  (I like to have at least 50/50 pasta/vegetables, if not more veg than pasta).

This recipe was excellent.  I also added some chopped toamatoes just before adding the white wine.  To finish it off I sprinkled on some finely shredded mozzarella and some fresh grated romano.  A great taste of summer any time of year!!

Very yummy! I substituted green pepper for the red pepper and I used baby corn instead of carrots (only because I had the baby corn but not the carrots). I also added mushrooms since I love them! :) My only suggestion would be to not use as much pasta as required. I made this for myself and one other person and used MORE than the suggested amount of vegetables but I did use one full pound of pasta. However, when it came time to serve it seemed like the veggies got lost in all the pasta! But other than that, I can't wait to make it again!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish, but next time I will try doubling the spices as it was a bit bland.  Other than that, it was good and contained tons of veggies.

I used a smaller pasta and added 1 lb of asparagus. I also put a lid on the veggies while they were cooking to steam them a bit. This left me with more juice in the bottom and it was very nice on the pasta.

Great recipe that you can adjust to suit your taste.  I subbed some leftover broccoli for the zuchini and added salt to taste.  Can't wait to try it with strips of chicken sauted with the veggies.  As expected, my kiddo took one look and requested that her linguine be served plain.  Oh well, her loss.  Thanks for sharing!

If your husband insists on protein in his meal, he will not like this recipe. I enjoyed it!

this is something that there will be many variations as to which veggies you add. I think with a little tweaking it can be made to be a 4-5 star meal.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I usually prefer a little sauce on pasta, but this was very healthy.

The only pain was chopping the veggies...otherwise, this recipe is now one of my all time favorite!!!  It even tastes good as leftovers right out of the refridgerator.  Next time I'll try it with chicken.

I would definitely make again.  The only change I made was to use fresh linguini that you can buy nowadays.  Didn't have any angel hair on hand and the fresh takes only two minutes to cook.  Next time I might an extra carrot.  I also added a teaspoon of oregano.  Thank You for the recipe
