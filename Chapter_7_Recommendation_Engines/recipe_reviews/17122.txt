A wonderfully creative twist and addition to basic Mexican cuisine! This is one creative cook to think of using large pasta shells in a Mexican dish! My hat go off to you, Grannycancook! I did follow the advise that quite a few had in using taco seasoning in place of the chili powder and salt. I used an envelope to 1 lb ground turkey. Also added 1/2 tsp minced garlic and 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilis (Rotel brand). Instead of taco sauce I substituted red enchilada sauce (28 oz) pouring a thin layer on the bottom of the baking dish before filling with a layer of the stuffed pasta shells and pouring rest of sauce to cover the shells. Once they were baked I topped with chopped fresh cilantro, sliced black olives, sliced green onions and fresh diced tomatoes. For sides I served refried beans covered with enchilada sauce and melted Mexican blend cheese and Lime Cilantro Rice following recipe from this web site. Excellent, excellent meal!

Fantastic! I did use Neufatchel cheese and a little more than called for. I also added a few more spices. Topped with black olives, diced tomatoes, and sour cream (as mentioned in the introduction), as well as chopped cilantro. I did spread some taco sauce on the bottom of the dish, as I was afraid of the shells drying out during baking. I stuffed the shells early in the day, refrigerated, then let them sit on the counter to warm up a bit while the oven preheated. Turned out great. We loved these, thank you! :)

Yummy!  I tweeked the recipe just a little.  I substituted a package of taco seasoning for the salt and chili powder and I used speghetti sauce instead of taco sauce.  I thought that it could use about twice as much sauce as the recipe calls for.  It just didnt seem like there was quite enough to go around.  This is the perfect recipe  for the crumbs at the bottom of the bag of chips.  My bag was about half full but I tipped it to the side and got the crumbs out of the bottom so I didnt have to use any of the "good" chips.

We loved this and it was better the next day. I didn't have taco sauce so I whizzed salsa in the processor and I added a little cayenne pepper (I like things spicy). One thing I would do next time is to pour a little sauce on the bottom of the casserole. We found the shells got a little crispy. I mixed the cheeses and (I substituted corn chips) corn chips together then sprinkled over casserole. My daughter suggested that this would be good even without the shells. Will defiantly make again and again.

An excellent quickie!! I left out the chips and used manicotti tubes instead of shells. Then I topped with a layer of refried beans, shredded lettuce, and shredded cheese just before serving.

I'm giving this 4 stars based on the concept.  I changed some things to add flavor because I knew it would be too bland for us as is.  I used 4 oz cream cheese and added 1 tsp each of oregano, cumin and cayenne to the chili powder.  I also replaced the taco sauce with salsa, slightly covering the bottom of the pan as well to prevent drying and sticking.  I omitted the crumbled chips.  Next time I will also add refried beans and olives.  It was really good with the kicked up flavor!

I subbed a bit because I stubbornly refuse to measure ingredients.  I used the full 8 oz of cream cheese, ground turkey and threw a can of rotele in with the meat.  This gave me enough stuffing for the full box of shells.  The entire family really enjoyed this dish and I'll definitely add it to the rotation.  Thanks!

I cooked this recipe as is.  It easy to prepare and didn't take long to clean up.  Everyone ate this meal but all went overboard on the sour cream and salsa because there wasn't much flavor.  We eat a lot of Mexican & spicy foods and expected some flavor which this did not have.  I didn't really like the cruncy tortilla chips, they were distracting.  The taste just doesn't justify the high calories/choloestrol, etc. in this recipe for me.

We liked this.  I did use taco seasoning in the meat mixture.  I think it had great flavor.  I added a thin layer of salsa to the bottom of my 13x9 so that the shells wouldn't stick and it was great!

Suggestions: I used double the taco sauce.  Also it seems very important to soften the cream cheese before adding it to the ground beef.
It was very yummy and kids will love it.  My daughter enjoyed helping me stuff the shells, this pasta shape is great for kids to work with.

This made a very tasty dish.  I made a few changes per other reviews - used 2 lbs ground beef, no salt or chili powder - I used two packages taco seasoning mix, one box of shells, no butter, used enchilada sauce (2) one mild and one hot, 1 package cheddar cheese and 1 package Monterey Jack cheese.  I divided the shells into two 8 x 8 size disposable pans.  I used the mild sauce for one dish and the hot sauce for the other.  I spooned the sauce on the bottom of both pans prior to adding the shells and spooned the remainder of the sauce on top.  I served the shells with crushed tortilla chips, diced onions, sliced black olives and sour cream on the side.  YUM.....

Thank you for sharing this recipe. Like many others I added some herbs and spices to kick up the flavor, but the basic premise deserves 5 stars. I agree the the Tortilla chips are distracting, so try this: Place Chips is food processor with a squirt of lime juice, 1/8 tsp Sugar and a dallop or two of Sour cream and keep adding Water 1tsp at a time while you pulse until it becomes a "Mash" this will create a "Psuedo Masa" to spread in the shell before stuffing it! This little tweak gives it a subtle depth of flavor.

I made this dish for a group of H.S. Soccer players (pre-game pasta dinner). I wanted something different from the usual spaghetti dishes! It was a huge hit! I made just a couple small changes...used 6 oz of cream cheese, subbed a packet of Taco seasoning for the salt & chili powder, no butter. Made extra shells in case some shells split (that was smart of me). Like other reviewers suggested, I put about a 1/4 cup of the taco sauce on the bottom of the dish, then added the stuffed shells and the rest sauce on top. Covered with foil and refrigerated overnight. Before baking, I removed the foil and added approx 1 cup salsa...about a tablespoon on top of each shell. Put the foil back on and popped into the oven. I had to allow and extra 15-20 minute cooking time since the dish was cold. Then I removed foil, & followed the rest of instructions. This dish is going to the next potluck dinner!!

AWESOME!!! I've been making these for yrs., but w/ slightly different ingredients, measurements & cooking times. I 1st stumbled upon this recipe in my TOH Quick Cooking cookbook. I've since passed this on to many who are in need of a prepared meal (hint: this is PERFECT for new moms / ill friends). The only difference b/t how I make my shells & grannycancook's recipe is that I use 2 lb. meat (lean beef or turkey, depending on what I have handy), an 8 oz. block of cream cheese (reduced-fat is OK), 2 packets of taco seasoning (I like to use reduced-sodium seasoning), nacho flavored Doritos instead of tortilla chips (the 100 calorie packs are great!) & reduced-fat Mexican-blend cheese. I make 24 shells & divide them b/t 2 8-in. baking pans (one of which I have spread w/ 1 c. salsa). I always brown my meat, drain it & add my taco seasoning following the directions on the pkg. I then add my cream cheese, stir until melted & cool for ~ an hr. (this helps "solidify" for easy scooping). I proceed as directed, but bake for 30 min. covered / 15 min. uncovered (after adding cheese / chips). When the craving strikes, I take my extra shells out of the freezer the day b4 I plan to prepare them, spread salsa in my baking dish (move the shells to do this) & bake as directed. Topped w/ olives, green onion, tomato & sour cream, these really DO mimic a taco! Served w/ lime cilantro rice (ENSeeber) & a "Southwest-style" tossed salad, this is an EXCELLENT meal. Thanks for sharing, granny! :-)

This was really, really, really good.  This is what I did: First, line a 13x9 pan with parchment paper. Second, take a large can of Medium Enchilada Sauce and a small can of Hot Enchilada Sauce and mix them together. Pour some of the sauce into the bottom of the pan, covering it. Note, for the chicken: I used chicken tenders, sliced them very thin, cooked them in a pan sprayed with pam/or store brand. Add Chicken Taco Seasoning and water according to the seasoning packet. Cook until the water is gone. Cook the large/jumbo shells to an al dente texture. I found the pasta at Walmart. When done, stuff the chicken mixture into the shells. Sprinkle the inside top with a Mexican Cheese Mix Blend. Place the shells, open side up, side by side in the baking pan. Spoon some sauce and sprinkle more cheese over the pasta. Place in oven for about 20 minutes. Remove from oven, sprinkle on crushed tortilla chips to lightly cover the pasta and sprinkle lightly with cheese. Bake for another 15 minutes. It's really, really good. I did deviate some from the original recipe after reading reviews. This is definitely worth keeping and doing again. ***Note: I don't like cream cheese and by using a Mexican Taco Cheese blend, I didn't have to buy 2 or 3 different types of cheese.

This is a good recipe, the first time I saw it was in a Taste of Home magazine many years ago (so not original with this cook).  It's a favorite of my husband and son!  I use a package of taco seasoning mix with my ground beef--it adds more flavor.

I cheated.  I hate heating the house up in the summer with the oven. So... While the shells cooked I made the meat filling and used a small saucepan to heat up my salsa.  Then I arranged everything in a glass pie plate that fits in my microwave.  I topped with the cheese mixture and microwaved for about 3-5 minutes, enough to melt the cheese.  Then topped with tortilla strips I had made from old corn tortillas, sour cream and chopped avocado.  It was delicious.

I have been making this for years, always a hit! Try corn chips instead of tortilla chips for a crunchier topping.

Really liked this one!  Instead of tossing the shells in butter though, I used lime juice.  Gave it a nice flavor and was healthier.  I used ground turkey and also opted for a packet of taco seasoning instead of the chili powder.  I mixed some cilantro into the meat mixture as well.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!  Here are the edits I made in the dish...  1.  I used a Taco Seasoning Packet instead of the salt and chili powder, plus it adds even more flavor.  2.  I used 8 oz of fat-free cream cheese (because we LOVE cream cheese) (just make sure you allow it to simmer long enough for the majority of the cc to melt)  3.  I didn't measure the taco sauce out, I bought Ortega Medium and just put as much on as I wanted, but wished I'd put the entire bottle over the dish instead of only 3/4.  4.  Instead of Cheddar and Monterey cheeses, I used 2.5 cups of Harris Teeter's Mexican Cheese Taco Blend (with added spices) (Sorry I don't remember the exact name of the cheese but it's the only one with added spices, purple bag!)  Flavor is INCREDIBLE!!!  5.  For Tortillas I used Multigrain Tostitos (love the flavor of these) and should have added more, definitely 2 cups should suffice!
And just an fyi, having leftovers for lunch the next day are definitely a must as well!  The flavors are EVEN better the day after...  Thank you so much for this recipe, we'll be sure to make it again and again!!!

I have been making this once a week since I found the recipe.  My hubby thinks he has died and gone to heaven.  Sometimes I add or subtract different things depending on what I have on hand.  If you haven't tried the pre-flavored Southwestern Cream Cheese from Philadelphia, it is really good.  I almost always use enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Last time, in place of the ground beef, I used leftover cooked chicken, shredded; then used green enchilada sauce.  TO DIE FOR!  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

This recipe was really good!!  :)  I used taco seasoning in the ground beef mixture instead of the chili powder and onions.  I also used taco sauce but per other reviews I think I might try enchilada sauce next time.  Definitely different and we will be making this again!

We loved this and it was better the next day. I didn't have taco sauce so I whizzed salsa in the processor and I added a little cayenne pepper (I like things spicy). One thing I would do next time is to pour a little sauce on the bottom of the casserole. We found the shells got a little crispy. I mixed the cheeses and (I subtitled corn chips) corn chips together then sprinkled over casserole. My daughter suggested that this would be good even without the shells. Will defiantly make again and again.

I add about 1/2-3/4 Cup of onion to the meat mix, plus black olives.  This is the perfect recipe for a buffet table. Just have plenty, they go fast.

A good solid 4-Star recipe.   I put some refried beans in with the ground beef mixture and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder. Hey, if the wife says it's a keeper, then it is something I will do again. I think I'll use some pepper jack cheese instead of the Monterey jack...... I like the extra kick...... Maybe even some jalapeno pieces with the beef mixture.

OMG!!!!!!! This dish was amazing. Honestly, I'm not huge taco fan, but these were awesome, Very easy, and quick to make. I made a few changes: I used ground turkey, whipped cream cheese which made it creamier, I used McCormick taco seasonings (mild & hot) seasoning in the packages, and I used Texas Tortilla strips chipotle & cheddar flavor, found where croutons are. This will be prepared again, especially on a winters night. Thanks for this great meal!!!!

This has been a fave recipe for years from my Favorite Brand Names Cookbook. I use mild taco sauce and then have medium or hot salsa on hand, as I'm a spicy wimp, lol! Also have sour cream and chopped scallions or chives avail. I usually bake in glass 9x13 so just spray with Pam. Often serve with side garden salad. Nice change to tacos. :)

Like many others, I used taco seasoning in place of the salt and the chili powder. I used probably about a tablespoon of Taco Seasoning I from this site...next time I'll use more. It needed a bit more kick. I loved the cream cheese in the ground beef mixture. The flavor it added was spectacular. Instead of taco sauce, I used enchilada sauce. Overall very creative and tasty dish. Thanks grannycancook!

Yummy! My friend and I made this for dinner tonight, and it turned out to be superb! We doubled the recipe and omitted the cream cheese since she didn't like that. This recipe is very easy to follow, and we didn't run into any trouble making this! We served it with some italian bread that we topped with a little bit of butter and some cheese. This is fantastic for mexican food lovers!

These were awesome!  I used a can of enchilada sauce, and poured just enough in the bottom of the baking dish to cover, and the rest over the stuffed shells.  I didn't have any tortilla chips, but I don't think this dish was missing anything.  I'll definitely be making these again!

I thought this would be a variation on lasagna or tacos but really isn't.  It is different twist on both and we really liked it.  I did change some things - I did not use the cream cheese and made my own taco seasoning with chili powder, cumin and oregano.  I pureed medium salsa and used that instead of enchilada sauce.  I sprinkled black olives on just before serving and piped the sour cream on then too.  I have requests to make this again soon.

Everyone in my house loved this!  I have two children who are always very picky.  And two adults with different heath needs and this was a hit with everyone.  I used ground turkey and used my own blend of taco seasonings instead of just chili powder.  This is the first recipe I've made from All Recipes that was good enough to warrant an review.  I've been a member since 2010.

I made these last night and we really enjoyed them.  I made alterations to the recipe as many reviewers suggested.  I basically browned my meat, adding taco seasoning with a little water to help work in the seasoning; then I mixed in the cream cheese.  I skipped the butter on the shells, as I didn’t think it was necessary.  When it was time to stuff the shells, my meat mixture looked a little dry, so I added about 1/4 cup of salsa (instead of the taco sauce) to moisten it up.  I also threw in some shredded cheddar.  I was basically making 1/3 of this recipe for the two of us, but only got 5 shells.  Had I used all 6 shells, they would have been pretty skimpy.  I, too, put a thin layer of salsa on the bottom of my baking dish.  I baked this covered for about 25 minutes and just added the cheese (I used all cheddar) when plating.  I served this on a bed of romaine and garnished with grape tomatoes, black olives, green onion tops, and sour cream.  I served the tortilla chips on the side.  My version turned out to be a taco salad of sorts.  This was fun to try!  Thank you!

I knew when I decided to make this that I would adjust the recipe.  It is a great idea, but I can't imagine it would have lots of "taco" flavor as written.  I added a package of taco seasoning mix, a can of diced green chiles, and half an onion to my ground beef mixture (along with the cream cheese).  Instead of just using just taco sauce on the top, I mixed with with a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  The end result was quite tasty.

Not worth all the effort.  A lot of prep and the dish was low on taste and I found myself trying to doctor the recipe too much with jalapenos, extra sour cream, etc.  Just go for regular tacos or a taco cassarole

Absolutely delicious dish!  I did make a few changes after reading the reviews.  First, since we didn't have ground beef, I used ground chicken.  I omitted the salt and chili powder and instead added in an envelope of taco seasoning and some cilantro to the cooked chicken to add extra flavor to the filling.  Also, I put a jar of Pace chunky salsa in the bottom of my baking dish to prevent the shells from drying out.  Used a can of red enchilada sauce to pour over the shells.  I also used one cup of shredded mexican cheese blend and one cup of shredded pepper jack.  The shells came out fantastic and we served them with shredded lettuce, sour cream and black olives.  Even my picky kids loved them.  Will definately make again!

Quite good but needs some modification. I used light cream cheese and sour cream. I cut out the butter as well as the salt. You also only need 1 and a half cups of cheese instead of two cups. We also added some fresh tomato and sweet pepper to the meat to add some more nutrients. After these changes the recipe was delicious and healthier!

My hubby and I cooked this last night and we were sooo pleased with the results. This dish is awesome to say the least. I will say that we left out the crushed tortilla chips and we actually added fresh cilantro to the final product. We will definitely make this one again.

Very quick and very easy - boyfriend loved it! I used taco seasoning instead of just chili powder & salt - add more chili powder to taste. Don't think 2 tbs of butter was necessary. Used Doritos instead of Tortilla Chips.

what a great and original idea!  i had to make several adaptations due to what i had on hand when i decided to make this last minute, but it still turned out wonderfully.  i didn't have jumbo shells, so i made the sauce and ended up tossing it with rotini pasta.  i also added in about a cup of tomato sauce, and didn't add the tortilla chips or sour cream on top.  my kids weren't especially impressed, but my husband devoured it, and really enjoyed the leftovers the next day too.  thanks!

These were really good. The only reason is gets a 4 star is because of the modifications I made after reading other reviews. I browned the ground beef, added taco seasoning (recipe from AL) added cream cheese and salsa. Put salsa on bottom of pan and on top of shells. Next time I will use taco sauce, but everyone loved it. Thanks for recipe.

What a wonderful meal!  Loved everything about this......the taste of the filling, the ease of filling the shells, the toppings, and being able to eat the "taco" with a fork!  This makes a nice meal for company - and it's something different - something I'm always looking for.  Thanks grannycancook for sharing this recipe.

I am so glad I found this recipe, my mom used to make these all the time. Once I moved out I missed having them, but now I can make them myself! I did make some modifications to it and added an extra ounce of cream cheese to the meat. I also only had enough meat mixture to make ten shells. I would double the meat mixture next time to fill 18-20 shells. Overall, past those couple modifications, it is a great recipe and I will be making it again!

Yummy!! I did make a few changes based on other reviews, I cooked the onions with the meat, and used taco seasoning in place of the chilli powder and I added a little bit of the taco sauce in the meat mixture. I coated the bottom of the dish with taco sauce, and I poured it over the top as well. My fiance, who is very picky, gobbled it up!!

Really yummy.  WE liked this better than the "original" stuffed pasta shells with ricotta and red sauce.  I used red enchilada sauce to cover the bottom of the pan and poured a bit over the shells before baking.  They were a hit.

I would think you could easily freeze this by making it without the cheese and tortilla chips-then add those back after reheating the dish.Then top with the sour cream as the recipe states. Save the last step of the recipe for later.

This recipe just didn't do it for my family.  My son & I both ended up having a bowl of cereal for dinner.  The flavors just didn't seem to mix well.  I also thought it was a bit dry.  Sorry.

These are so pretty and rather tasty as well.  ..but I made quite a few changes.  I only used 1 pound of ground beef because that is how I package my meat... and I can't seem to brown ground beef without onion (ever).  I used 4 ounces of cream cheese and an envelope of taco seasoning in lieu of the salt and chili powder.  I added a can of Ro-tel (drained) to the meat mixture and let the meat mixture sit for about an hour before stuffing the shells.  I put about a cup of bottled salsa down in the pan before adding the stuffed shells and used almost all of a 10 ounce can of enchilada sauce for the top.  I cooked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 15.  This is really odd but I did not use all of the cheese...maybe 1 1/2 cups worth and only about a cup of the tortilla chips which I almost left out based on other reviews but I'm glad I didn't.  I prettied it up with some chopped cilantro after cooking.  Very pretty presentation served with Chef John's Spicy Spanish-Style Rice.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I put 1/4 of the shells in a separate pan and cooked them without the taco sauce because a few of the kids don't like sauce. I did not toss the shells in butter and used more seasoning than called for. I also ended up using more cream cheese,

I rated this 5 stars with my modifications!!!  I used taco seasoning instead of the salt and chili powder. I ommited the butter, definitely didn't need it.  I added diced petite tomatoes, green chilis, and refried beans to the meat mixture. I didn't use the crushed tortilla chips either.  I used an entire box of jumbo shells, because the meat mixture definitely makes enough for TWO 9 X 13 pans.  I froze the other for later!  VERY YUMMY and I will be making it again!!!!

Loved these! I was a little leary of the cream cheese, but it was wonderful.  I forgot to top with sour cream when serving, but we sure didn't miss it.  I also ended up with about 24 shells filled, so I used a bit more taco sauce (I actually used half taco sauce, half salsa) when covering the shells before baking.

We enjoyed this recipe a lot!  I made a few minor tweaks.  I used ground chuck and added about 1/4 cup of chopped onions and about 1/2 t. of garlic powder.  I used 1/2 cup of  hot taco sauce and 1/2 cup of mild.  I did not add the cheese tortilla chips to the recipe.  Served on a bed of mixed salad greens along with cheese tortilla  chips.  Easy recipe which has been in my recipe box for several months and will remain as a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I really thought we would enjoy these but we didn't. They were certainly easy to put together. We don't care for cumin so I subbed Taco seasoning as did a lot of other reviewers. Other than that I made them as written. I really don't know what it lacked for us but they just weren't what we expected.

When I made this I did not have the patience to stuff the shells so I made it more of a casserole. I did not use the chilli powder, instead I used taco seasoning to taste. I cooked everything exactly as the recipe stated but my shells were medium so I mixed them in with the meat mix and poured it all in the casserole pan. Made it less time and energy but still tasted great!

Great recipe Granny.  Used taco seasoning in meat and added green chilis.  I have made this with shells,  rolled in lasagna noodles and also with softened corn tortilas for enchiladas.  Is always a hit either way.  Thanks for the idea.

I thought this was really delicious.  Ground beef & cream cheese make a wonderful combo.  What made this nice for my family is I have a couple picky eaters who don't usually do mexican because of the heat and because of the chunks (onions, pepper, etc).  However, this could be omitted from the base recipe & added later (my husband put some salsa on top).

These looked so fun and I finally had some extra time to make them.  Next time I make them, I'll do it to use up left-over taco meat rather than making both meat and pasta then baking it too.  I'm also going to try mixing up some salsa and tomato paste for the taco sauce and see how that turns out.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was pretty good.  My husband and I both enjoyed it and it was nice to have something a bit different from ordinary tacos.  It did, however, taste almost exactly like tacos and my husband and I both concluded that for all of the extra effort this recipe requires it just isn't worth it.

These were phenomenal.  I used shredded chicken as the meat, and used 3 ounces of onion and chive cream cheese spread instead of regular cream cheese.  The result was creamy and flavorful.  We WILL be making these again.

These were pretty good! I made some changes to the recipe: used 1 package of taco seasoning in place of chili powder and salt; used manicotti shells because the store didn't have jumbo shells available; used a 28oz. can of marinara sauce instead of the taco sauce (this was plenty - 1 cup is not enough!); used 1 bag (2 cups) of shredded Mexican Blend cheese; and I didn't include the tortilla chips. Topped with sour cream and served with refried beans and Spanish rice. This was enough to feed 4 adults plus have leftovers the next day - all for around $15. A cheap, quick and easy weeknight dinner!

No too bad, but the next time I make it I will add some additional seasoning to the meat. It was a little bland and it seriously needed some spice to it.

Thanks for the idea!  used old el paso taco mix for extra flavor and the mexican blend cheese by sargento topped off with crushed tostito chips and jalepanos.  will make again for football games for the gang.

Yumm! I knew right when I saw this that I would love it.  I swapped the salt and chili powder for McCormick's hot taco seasoning, and added diced tomatoes with green chiles. I prepared this before work, and stuck the pan in the fridge so when I got home I could just toss it in the oven! Worked out GREAT.  I served it with a side of beans, topped with red enchi sauce as suggested.  I topped the taco pasta shells with sour cream and cilantro, very very good. :D

In order to make this vegetarian for my son, i used Boca crumbles in place of the ground beef. I also used Small shells instead of large and this is more like a hamburger helper type dish but WAAAY better. My son really loved this dish. We put thinly sliced cabbage, diced roma tomatoes, green onions, guacamole and sour cream on the top--chips on the side, not mixed in. We definitely loved this and will definitely make over again. Did I saw it was Quick too?? i made the crumbles and the sauce in one pan and boiled the little shells in another pan. once both were cooked, i drained the water from the pasta and threw into the pan with the crumbles. stirred well and placed on the plates with the toppings i mentioned above and the shredded cheeses. Freezer to table about 25 minutes

These were a hit! I didn't change anything other than mixing some of the taco sauce in with the meat and cream cheese mixture. I also spread some taco sauce on the bottom of the pan before placing the shells down. Very good!

Really good.  Did change up a few things.  Instead of chili powder, I used a packet of taco seasoning.  Next time too I'll probably use a low sodium taco seasoning.  Instead of taco sauce I used a can of red enchilada sauce - poured a little in the pan to coat it, then poured the rest over the shells.  All in all, turned out pretty good.  Will definitely be making this again.

These were delicious!  I added chopped onion in the beef mixture (may add peppers next time) & used taco seasoning in the beef.  I didn't have any tortilla chips on hand so I omitted those.  I mixed the sour cream with the taco sauce to make it a little creamier & milder.  A whole box of pasta shells made 2 small casserole dishes - I froze one for later.  My picky DH even loved these.  UPDATE: I make these all the time & usually add a can of black beans to make more filling, freeze on a cookie sheet (no sauce) then throwing in a freezer bag.  I just pull out how many I need & let thaw during the day before baking.  I always have these on hand in the freezer for quick dinners.

I love this and my kids love it too! I did use taco seasoning instead of the salt and chili powder. I also added shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream with some olives after they were plated for  my kids. They really taste like tacos that way!

Yummmmmy! These shell are fantastic and so easy to make! I followed the recipe as written, but topped with onions, black olives, and spicier salsa.  You could easily add or omit this recipe to your taste! Definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic.  I added sauteed onions and garlic to the meat and topped with enchilada sauce (we didn't have taco sauce and I hate going to the store for one ingredient).  It turned out awesome!  The creamy meat mixture was the best.

Awesome. Great idea, pretty simple and I found this pleased all of my family. Those who are adventurous liked the idea of something different, those  that are picky were happy because the flavors are familiar. All in all, an absolute winner.

These were just ok for us.  If I make them again I will add more spices as they just didn't seem to us to have much flavor.  I will also add more taco sauce and maybe fewer chips.  They were a little on the dry side.  Love the concept and enjoyed trying a new dish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was a great jumping off point for me. I did make my own additions. I was making a double recipe so I used 2 lbs ground beef and 8 oz cream cheese. Then I drained a can of black beans and slightly mashed them (some were still whole). Then I added garlic powder, cumin and about 1/2 cup of taco sauce. With the remaining 1.5 cups of taco sauce I added a can of enchilada sauce. I dipped each shell in the sauce to give it flavor and keep it from getting too dry during cooking. I took others' advice and put some sauce on the bottom. Filled the already dipped shells, covered in cheese and then added black olives at the end. I meant to serve it with sour cream but forgot about it and they were still awesome. The only change I would make next time is maybe cooking some chopped onions with the beef or putting sliced green onions on top right out of the oven.  Will use this one again! My family loved it and the other family I made it for also loved theirs.

We loved these!  They were a great compromise between my husband's love of mexican and my love of pasta.  I followed some other reviewer's advice and cooked the ground beef with about 2 tablespoons of the Taco Seasoning I from this site, a diced onion and a can of green chilis. I added about 4 oz of cream cheese and followed the shell stuffing directions per recipe. I did put taco sauce on the bottom of the pan and I think it helped keep them moist. I topped them with a mild corn and black bean salsa and cheese and baked covered per directions and then uncovered for about 5 minutes to let the cheese melt.  We put sour cream, hot sauce, diced avocado, black olives and diced tomatoes on top and it was delicious.  I think you could use whatever you have in your pantry and make this dish a hit!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site...and it takes a really great recipe for me to say that. I took others advice and added taco seasoning to the beef, before adding the cream cheese. I also used 1/2 an onion when browning the beef. I melted the butter and added the taco sauce to it to line the pan instead of using the sauce for the top of the shells. I filled the shells with the beef mixture and then added a can of of Rotel on top. Lastly, for the cheeses, I used a mixture of shredded chedder and spanish cheese. Amazing! A little time consuming of a dish, but definately worth making.

This was a yummy dish!  We used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and salt, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Next time I think we'll skip the crushed chips - I don't know that they added a whole lot.  We served this with Mexican-style rice and salad.

Made this tonight and it was great.  The only things I changed was I had salsa instead of taco sauce and I used pico de gio as a topping.  Next time I will leave off the chips.  We loved it.  I will be making this again.

According to my husband, this was great.  I did tweak it a bit, instead of stuffing shells, I used rotelle pasta and what I did was:  Prepared the meat as per the instructions(I used 2 lbs of meat and about 6 oz cream cheese and 1 1/2 tsp Chili powder), mixed the cooked pasta (1 lb or a little less, depending on how much pasta you want) with the meat, and I also added a can of Rotelle Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilis.  Poured the taco sauce (used about 16 oz) over the meat/pasta, added the crushed tortillas and then topped off the casserole dish (9 x 13) with mexican cheese and baked for about 15 minutes.  Yummy!

This was too salty,    considering the ingredients, the filling would be better on a taco shell than a pasta shell,  so I would skip the pasta, chips, and all that trouble assembling it.

This is excellent!  I took the advice of several reviewers and to the hamburger added taco seasoning instead of chili powder and salt, a can of RoTel tomatoes w/ green chilis, and 8oz of cream cheese. And instead of taco sauce, I used red enchilada sauce. I served this with Lime Tostidos crushed on top, shredded lettuce, sour cream and a little taco sauce. Yummy!!  My husband loved it. A keeper.

A fun twist; taco seasoning and more spice does this recipe very well.  Unfortunately, I overcooked the shells just a bit so I'll be giving this another try soon. yum!

Most definitely use taco seasoning when cooking your meat. I can't imagine the recipe without doing that. Also, you must put salsa in the bottom of your dish. My shells were still a little dry. But a very good recipe.

Serve w/ olives, like the picture shows! Better if you use more sauce - mix some tomato sauce w/ taco sauce, if it's too spicy for you.

My family loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I think I will put a little sour cream into the meat mixture for another layer of flavor.

You have to try these!  They are soooooo good. We used ground Chicken but followed everything else to a T.  You might want to have a little extra sauce.  I would eat these once a week.  Served with a green salad.  YUM

I liked the idea of this, but just wasn't overly impressed after making them. I followed the recipe exactly, but mine came out slightly bland and somewhat dry. If I make again, I'll be changing up the recipe to incorporate more flavor and more creaminess.

Tried this out, and it was very good.  Used Catelli express cook canneloni shells, as the market didn't have the jumbo shells.  Had to increase the first bake time as a result. Will increase the amount of cream cheese, and use medium spice taco sauce next time.

We love this concept.  I tweaked it to suit us by using chicken instead of beef.  I added garlic and onion and red pepper flakes and used low fat cream cheese.  I also did as another reviewer did and used lime juice instead of butter to coat the shells.  I also used salsa instead of taco sauce.  Next time I will try it with refried beans and spanish rice for our meatless dinner night.

HOLY BUCKETS!  This was amazing!  My husband could not say enough about it.  "Oh my gosh!" followed every bite he took.  I used turkey rather than beef and lite cream cheese.  Also reduced the amount of shredded cheese because 2 cups seemed like too much.  A total keeper! THANKS GRANNY!

I didn't really love this, and I love most things taco.  For me pasta with taco just doesn't mesh.  I'd love to experiment with this to get a rice based dish.

Exceeded my expectations!  I added a can of black beans to the mixture and used salsa instead of sauce to coat the bottom of the pan prior to adding the shells.  It was a wonderful meal.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was WONDERFUL! I only had 1Lb of ground beef, so I cooked it with the seasonings and it was wonderful. I will try using taco seasoning next time, just to test it out, but it is delicious just the way it is. I don't know if I wasn't putting enough meat in mine or not, but it took about 22 shells to use it all up, so make extra shells if you aren't completely loading the shells up=) THANKS SO MUCH FOR A WONDERFUL RECIPE! My hubby is so happy that we have another favorite, lol=)

This is the BEST recipe for my little boy to help make and to eat.  Since it's a mix of Italian and Mexican, I take softened butter, mix in chopped green onions and spread this on french bread that I then broil until golden brown and serve with the casserole.  Oh yummm.

I made this vegetarian by using one package on the frozen crumbles sold in stores, and adding in 4 oz. sliced olves and 8 oz. sweet corn to increase flavor. It was fairly good if not overwhelming. Definitely worth making, though more casserole-ish than I expected.

These were really good, and in our regular rotation for family dinner nights. I add another ounce of cream cheese to make it really creamy, and a touch less water for the taco seasoning to avoid the greasy mess. We also wait to put the cheese on until the last minute of cook time so it doesn't dry out and looks better visually!

I basically followed the recipe but used taco seasoning instead of salt and chili pepper and  enchilada sauce to coat the pan and I added some on top of the shells. I didn't use the chips but I added guacamole as a topping along with tomatoes and green onion.

Pretty good, I used Taco Season instead of chili power.  I cooked double the amount of shells and stuffed them with refried black beans, cream cheese, and taco seasoning....it was awesome.

I have made this dish many times now, and my family loves it.  I've added a pinch of cilantro before, and also made it with packaged taco seasoning in the meat.  I always have some guacamole as well on the side to top it with.  It's always good!

This is delicious (the hubby said this is now in his top 10)! I also used taco seasoning as others mentioned, left out the butter, and mixed in a 16 ounce container of 2% cottage cheese to stretch the filling out further.  I was able to make about 36 fully stuffed shells this way. The cottage cheese made the filling a little watery - I might cook it down a little more next time. The cream cheese gives it a little tang (used half a block that was leftover from something else). What a great way to use up taco meat!  Also works great with turkey (that's all I had on hand).

Such a great alternative! I add chopped green bell pepper, onion and fresh garlic with the meat as I am cooking. I also use a taco seasoning packet and top with Fritos. I find they keep their crunch better than tortilla chips. I cook cilantro lime rice as the side. Such a good compliment to each other.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I needed to use up my jumbo shells I made from earlier in the week. Just a tip: the cold dry shells were much easier to stuff this time around. I will be cooking my shells in advance and refrigderating them beforehand from now on. It didn't seem to affect the cooking time by much. Just a few minor changes: used a little more cream cheese than called for, used enchilada sauce instead, taco seasoning packet and omitted the chips. We will def make again. Thanks!

I added a thin layer of refried beans on the bottom of the 9X13.  This kept the shells in place.  One of my favorite meals!

This is a new favorite in our house! I think this is a great make-ahead dish and it's easy to modify to suit your tastes.  I used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and salt and also used ground turkey. I added garlic powder to the meat while browning and added a splash of water to the taco seasoning.  Instead of taco sauce, I used half a small can of Rotel mild chiles and tomatoes to add to the dish before adding the shells and then used the rest of the can over the top along with some marinara sauce (I also skipped buttering the shells).  Added some black olives to the top before adding the cheeses. This was very tasty! So glad to have leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Love it! I make this all the time. I make taco seasoning from this site and use that instead of the suggested spices. I also use salsa instead of taco sauce and the full block of cream cheese. Bake for 15 minutes. Quick and easy. For 1 lb. of beef, I use 10 shells. Yummy!

We LOVED it!!!!  I used taco seasoning, doubled the cream cheese, and used hot taco sauce. I  put a cup of taco sauce in the bottom if the baking dish and this kept them from drying out. I don't agree when people say its wrong to rate a recipe a five when you change it because I just altered it to OUR personal tastes but am sure the original recipe would be a five, too. We will definitely be adding this to our repertoire!

Something different! The whole family loved this, I sprinkled crushed Doritos on top and served with all the usual taco toppings.

Made this for the family and they LOVED IT! The only things I changed were 1) cooking the ground beef in taco seasoning instead of using the chili powder, and 2) not using taco sauce, just 'cause I didn't have any. The real appeal of this one is being able to add whatever toppings you like on top of it - sour cream, lettuce, tomato, salsa, olives, etc. I'll be making this on again!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is a great basic recipe.  I did change a few things, however.  I used packaged taco seasoning mix instead of the salt and chili powder.  Also, because my guy will not eat cream cheese, I used re-fried beans instead.  It helped hold the mixture together, and it was very tasty!  The cheese I used was a shredded Mexican-blend.

Never made (or heard of) this twost on tacos. It was easy and good though. Everyone enjoyed it.   I did add black beans (which I try to do whenever I think I can get away with it and it really added a nice texture.). Would make again.

I added more cream cheese and even added taco seasoning to the ground beef for extra flavor! Also, learned that you need more taco sauce than it calls for so I just supplemented with salsa.

I added all the same seasonings that I use for tacos instead of just the chili powder and salt.   I also added onions and jalapenos to the meat.  The taco sauce was also very bland so I ended up adding a bunch of seasonings to that as well.  Enchilada sauce would have been a better choice than the taco sauce.  I think I will stick to tortillas instead of stuffing shells with taco meat.

I was surprised by how good this was. I confess to a few changes, since we like our foods well seasoned . . . In addition to the chili powder, I used garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, paprika, and oregano. I added these same spices to a jar of tomato sauce in lieu of the taco sauce. And I added at least one cup of salsa, as well (put some on top and some on bottom). I almost omitted the chips but am glad I didn't . . . The flavor and crunch added a lot to the dish. We ate this with avocados, green onions, and sliced olives.

I used 1 lb ground beef with 1 packet of taco seasoning (leaving out the water the packet directs) and still used 3 oz cream cheese. I added a bit of milk in the mixture as I found it to be a little dry looking. I didn't use the salt or chili powder. I still used 18 pasta shells but eliminated the melted butter - I just left the shells in a bit of water to keep them from sticking. I also used more taco sauce. I see the chips and sour cream as optional and topped my taco shells with diced fresh tomatoes and green onions.

The taste is not bad, however, it's not really different than regular tacos but is much more time consuming and requires more ingredients. Probably won't make again.

Everyone in my family loved and ate this delish dish! I do my meat:onions, 2lb gr beef, some chop celery, some green onions, some garlic, cilantro, salt. added 4oz cream cheese. stuffed the cooked shells - btw, I undercooked, and kids not too happy but they ate them... I put pam, then enchilada sauce on the bottom(did not like this myself - next time will put pureed salsa on bottom)filled shells and set them in, salsa on top.  Followed the rest, minus chips, which I didn't have on hand. Everyone raved. I, picky patty that I am, loved them. THis is going on the list!

Basic recipe probably deserves the 5 stars but like many reviewers I made major changes and am delighted with my changes for health and economy sake.  I used ground venison (leaner) used homemade taco season instead of salt and chili powder (lower sodium) EVOO instead of butter, homemade red enchilado sauce instead of taco sauce (lower sodium and less expensive) and added a few sliced black olives, green onions and a tomato diced for toppings.  We loved it.  I see many other possibilities for this concept!

Very good, although I made some changes. I used one packet of taco seasoning in place of the chili powder and salt, used 16 oz of taco sauce and some Franks Red Hot sauce to spice it up. Also the store I went to did not have large shells so I bought medium shells and just mixed everything together and topped with cheese and Fritos, will definitely make again!

Way too dry and I used 2 cups of sauce. Would not make these again.

This is a really good recipe. I didn't think any of the individual components sounded nasty, but was a bit leery about mixing them all together--but it worked out even better than I hoped for. On another note, this freezes like a dream. Had leftovers the first time I made it and popped them into the freezer. Had them a month later on one of those "I don't want to cook" nights and the only addition I made was to add a few more crushed Doritos on top for fresh crunch! Exactly as delicious as the first time--even with cream cheese inside!

Really good! I had a hard time stuffing the shells, and mine turned more into a layered casserole. It was still so tasty! Husband loved it!

I added a can of Rotel(original diced tomatoes with chilies) and one teaspoon Cumin to the ground beef, and omitted the tortilla chips topping and salt.

Ok.  I'm still heating up the leftovers!  Sooo good.  I served with a side of Spanish rice that was so easy to make from Allrecipes' (the one using a cup of salsa).  Only thing is recipe say 1 (3 oz) box of cream cheese.  Well any real 'foodie' will tell you it doesn't actually come in a 3 oz box but an 8 oz. one and I needed all 8 after trying to cut it according to marked measurement on inside packaging.  It was still very good.

This was a really good idea! Even my one year old loved it! I made a couple of changes, Like a lot of other people I switched the Chili powder for a packet of taco seasoning, and I put hot taco sauce on 1/3 of the shells, med on some, and then none on some for my baby so it wasnt to spicy. I also cooked onions with the meat. I will def make again!

This went over well with hubby and 1 out of 5 kids. He is my taste tester and loves to try stuff. I am sure I will make it again.  One alteration I made was to substitute taco spices for the chili powder.

I had found this recipe in one of my cookbooks and fell in love with it after making it the first time. I use cream cheese with chives and almost always top them with green onions, it brings out the already great flavor even more. This recipe and chicken stuffed shells are favorites among our friends when we have dinner. 5 stars!

These are absolutely delicious!  I'm going to try to add some more veggies in place of the meat next time and make it a little healthier.  I used salsa i/o taco sauce, I just prefer salsa.

So yummy. Used ground turkey instead, taco seasoning, enchilada sauce, and added corn, peppers and diced tomatoes to the filling. I put it on the table and my 4 year old blurted out "I hate it!" He quickly changed his mind with the first bite. Never have had such a positive reaction from him with something other than PBJ.

Delicious and what a great idea!  The little crushed tortilla chips are genius and perfect to give it that crunch and true taco feel.  These are actually REALLY easy to make!  My whole family gobbled them up!  Thanks!

Used my co-workers as guniea pigs today. Nothing left but a little sauce in the bottom of the pan! Huge hit. I doubled the recipe and used one packet of taco seasoning instead of just the chili powder for seasoning. Will make it for the family next week.

Good flavors, but a little dry. Maybe will try again with additional tomatoes or taco sauce added for more moisture.

Dry, dry, dry...I made these with extra cream cheese, and topped off with even more taco sauce, but the end result was not flavorful enough and dry.  It could possibly be good with a can of rotel, or some salsa underneath, or on top--something.  As is, I would not make again, sorry.

I made this dish for my family as a culinary project, and it was absolutely incredible. Even though we tweaked it a bit, due to my family not liking Cream cheese and sour cream. we added the jar cheese instead of cream cheese and taco seasoning instead of chili powder :)

This recipe was a great family meal.  The only thing I would suggest is that the first time I made it, it was a little dry.  The second time I doubled the taco sauce you pour on top and it was much better.

This was a huge hit with my family.  I used more taco sauce and more cream cheese in the meat.  It had a wonderful flavor and I can't wait to make it again!  I did end up using 22 shells instead of 18.  It is a little messy when stuffing the shells, but so worth the mess!  This would be fun to do with kids who like "hands on" cooking fun.  I wanted to send a picture but the family didn't want to wait while I looked for the camera!  There were only three shells left for my lunch the next day! Yum!  I may have to double the recipe for the next time.  And there will be a next time really soon!

I'm so glad we tried these.  They are the best.  I made two minor revisions.  I used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and I also put some taco sauce in the bottom of the pan.  Definitely a keeper and a great dish to serve for company.

These were awesome! My kids absolutely loved them (which is rare for my picky eaters.)  I seasoned the beef with taco seasoning as some others suggested and topped with fresh cilantro along with the cheese and chips.  Thank you- what a great and fun dinner!

I loved this, my husband thought it was just ok.  I did make some changes.  First time I just added a lot more taco sauce, he thought it was too strong so 2nd time I used part tomato sauce and part taco sauce.  I also use more cream cheese than called for and used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder.  Overall we do like this, he liked it better the 2nd time with the changes I made...we will continue to make it

YUMMMM!!! That's what my family thinks! Well, honestly after I made some mods... I read the other reviews and added a lil something of my own.. I used gr. turkey, 1/2 tube of pork chorizo saus, Taco Seasoning 1 from this site, more taco sauce and some on the bottom of the dish, butter and EVOO on the pasta. After the meat was cooked and seasoned I added onion, garlic and rotel.  Topped during the last 15 mins of cook time the cheese, chips, tomatoes, green onion, cilantro, olives. Put the shells on a bed of shredded lettuce and topped with sour cream...YUMMM!!! Next time I make this I will make a casserole using elbow mac noodles instead of the shells...we aren't crazy about the thick pasta taste, it's a lil much.  Thanks for the recipe, I loved it! Will def make again!!

This was great even the kids who say that they don't like pasta (pfft whatever lol) ate it. I too coated the bottom of the pan with taco sauce and I'm glad I did because they still stuck slightly.

We love this recipe and  I have had to pass it along several times.  We made more of a meal with it byputting the shells on a bed of lettuce,tomatoes,shredded onions,making it similar to a taco salad.

I thought these tasted great, but just weren't worth the effort to put them together. I would maybe make them again, but in the form of a lasagna and just spread the meat filling between the noodles.

A very nice change and easier to make than I thought.    Next time I'm going to bake these in a muffin pan using wonton skins instead of the pasta shells.

yummmmmmmm! What a great twist on tacos! They're the perfect size, just put a little sour cream on top and pop the whole thing in your mouth! The boyfriend and I gobbled these up. (recipe made as-is)

Honestly, this recipe deserves 5 stars for pure genius.  I mostly followed the recipe but did a few things differently:  I used taco seasoning packet instead of salt/chili powder for the ground beef, 1 added 1 can of refried beans to the ground beef mixture, no butter on the pasta, I mixed 1 cup taco sauce with 1 cup marinara sauce and put some sauce on the baking dish before adding the pasta.   SO GOOD!  My guests LOVED this pasta dish!

sooooooo good! i made these for girls' night with my fellow female grad students, and it received rave reviews!  i made a few changes to suit my preferences. i started with about 1/2 an onion and a clove of garlic, then added the beef. as per other reviewers' suggestions, i used taco seasoning (1 package) instead of chili powder and salt. low-fat cream cheese was all we had on hand, and it worked beautifully. i also spread taco sauce (from taco bell) on the bottom of the pan, did not toss the pasta in butter (just rinsed it in cold water), and poured salsa over the top rather than taco sauce. also, i only used 1 cup of cheese (mexican blend). i served it with fresh diced tomatoes, chopped cilantro and sour cream. yum yum yum! can't wait to make it for the mr. :)

I've been making this recipe for over 15 years.  I use low fat chive & onion cream chz.  I also use Bison instead of hamburger.  Have used turkey before as well.  Bison is the family favorite.  I also omit the salt if I'm using tortilla chips.  I make this for new moms or families that need a dinner and every time have been asked to share the recipe.

A very tasty change from your traditional Italian style stuffed shells. I did use taco seasoning and added a can of diced tomatoes with chiles. I put black olives on one quarter for my own taste. You could get quite creative with this simple yet satisfying recipe. The next time I make this I do two, one mild and one for those of us who like it hot.

I would try doubling the taco sauce next time to make it a little more moiste. Other than that, my family loved it! We decided to make a whole "bar" out of it, adding salsa, chopped lettuce, and such to top it off.

I loved this!!! It looked and tasted amazing. I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and I increased the cream cheese to 4 0z. I also left out the crushed chips and added more taco sauce. This is a new favourite in our house!

My family absolutely loves these.  The first time I made them, I didn't have any ground beef, so I chopped a cheap round steak into small pieces.  I also used taco seasoning and salsa on the bottom.  Omitted the tortilla chips.  Now we actually treat them just like tacos and have a plate with lettuce, tomato, and chopped onion to garnish.  YUMMY!

For the work that this recipe requires, the taste really isn't worth the effort. I followed some of the other reviews on this site and used 8 oz of cream cheese, which was WAY too much. 3-4 oz. is plenty. I also used taco seasoning instead of the spices that were called for. I added 2/3 of a cup of water with the seasoning. I also added chopped onion, cilantro and garlic to the meat mixture. I used enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and then topped the shells with the taco sauce as the recipe states. I served these with spicy refried beans and Mexican rice. They were decent and maybe okay for a weekend meal, but they just took too much time for a weeknight. I doubt I will make them again.

What a fantastic idea! Combining my 2 loves: Mexican and Pasta! I used salsa since taco sauce here comes in tiny jars so that wouldn't be very economic. I also topped with sour cream, green onions and minced jalapeños - so so so good, I ate the leftovers for breakfast!

The recipe as is is ok...I added a can of diced tomatoes to add moisture while the shells were cooking.  I think it needs more to the filling, maybe onions and peppers or something to give it more flavor and texture.  Good idea, will try again, with changes.

My guys loved this.  A great football game day choice.  I used 8 oz cream cheese and double the beef, so it worked out just right.  Would cut back on the salt next time, as the torillas add some as well as the salsa - yes, used salsa instead of taco sauce and it was delicious!  Also added onions to the beef while it was browning.

Yummy. My husband really liked this creative idea. This could really be dressed up many ways. Next time, I'll add black olives and green chile peppers to the topping.

Made this last night and it was really good!  I would agree with the reviewer that it needs twice as much taco sauce than called for - will remember that next time.  And there WILL be a next time!  :)
UPDATE: Ok - so I used a whole 16 oz. bottle of taco sauce. I always have too much meat mixture for the shells, so I arranged/ topped the rest on and around the shells. Also used a combo of crushed regular and cool ranch Doritos. We topped it with light sour cream before eating. Yum!

I left the tortilla chips out of the recipe and added pico de gallo. This was one of the best new recipes yet. I think they should rename it to taco manacotti! Two great things combined.

Very neat idea and different!  I made this for a bridal shower and it was definitely a hit and everyone seemed very intrigued by them.  I will say that they seemed very bland, though, so I'm going to try them again tonight and try to pump up the flavor a little.  Maybe more taco seasoning and some cayenne pepper.

When My husband said "you can make this again" I know I have a good one. It was very tasty and all I did was cut in half but it could have been juicier so next time I will add more sauce but even at that it was very good.

Really great, but I did need to add some flavor to the meat and I am glad I did! Added some chopped onions and garlic as well as some taco seasoning. Substituted Neufchatel for the cream cheese, and ground turkey for the ground beef. Instead of butter I tossed the shells in olive oil. The end result was incredible. I scarfed the leftovers today for lunch and wish I had more for dinner. =)

ok..i started out following the recipe exact..but not enough flavor for us. So to 2 pounds of ground beef i added 8 oz cream cheese, 1 packet of taco seasoning, 3 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 2 tsp of cumin. this filled 30 jumbo shells. I used chunky salsa and put a little on the bottom of the pan so the shells didn't stick. Very good and will be added to our recipe rotation. Thanks for sharing!

What a great recipe! After reading comments I used taco seasoning and a bit more cream cheese and taco sauce. It turned out so delicious, I will be making this again!

I've been making this dish for about 10 years now.  It's a family favorite that has never gotten old!  We like our food pretty spicy, though, so I usually add crushed red pepper flakes to ours.

VERY DELICIOUS. i also as others suggested used a taco seasoning package instead of spices. added to ground beef with the cream cheese. did not use the crumbled chips because i had none on hand. but did serve it with sour cream and additional salsa. everyone loved it.

Unbelievably good! I thought these sounded like they would be alright, but this recipe exceeded my expectations and then some!  I used a pound of ground bison, sauteed some onion and garlic with it,  and added some cumin along with the chili powder.  I added about another ounce of cream cheese, as the mixture seemed to need it, and naturally I forgot to get taco sauce, so I just used salsa instead, putting a bit on the bottom of the baking dish so the shells wouldn't dry out while baking.   Delicious! Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe!

I will make this again.  My kids loved it and they rarely like anything I cook.  Next time I think I will use the suggestion of the taco seasoning in place of the spices to give it an extra kick.

I browned the beef with diced onion and flavored it with a taco seasoning packet to make it easier on myself.  Next time I won't toss the shells in butter, I don't think it added anything to the flavor and it was very messy to stuff them once they were coated with the butter.  I also put a layer of salsa in the bottom of the pan for extra flavor and to prevent them from drying out.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe, our young children ate it but they didn't like it as much as we did.

***I did make it a day ahead and refrigerated it for ease of baking at the end of the day.  I added about 15 minutes to the cook time (covered with foil) and it turned out great!

These are so fun.  I used garden vegetable cream cheese and substituted enchilada sauce for the taco sauce.  Always a favorite at my house.

Disappointing. I was excited to try this recipe but it ended up with the family hating it. I made no modifications to the recipe spite other review recommendations. Italian and Mexican food don’t mix well together. Pasta shells tasting the place of taco shells is the only thing not mix UCSB about this recipe. Having tortilla chips on top, it leaves one to wonder why if the pasta was to replace the taco shell. The shells turned out dry on the bottoms. Will not make again.

I did add extra cheese on top, but next time I'd make a couple other changes.  I thought as the recipe goes it was a bit dry.  I would increase the liquid. more taco sauce or even diced tomatoes, and I would decrease the tortilla chips.

Very boring as is. I would make it again, but would definitely add more flavor with onions and taco seasoning in the meat.  Would probably use salsa with the taco sauce as well.

I took people's advice and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder as well as throwing a can of rotel tomatoes in with the meat mixture.  I also put salsa in addition to taco sauce on top of the shells.  Obviously I have no idea how the original would turn out, but the way I ended up doing it had plenty of flavor and was delicious! Will definitely make it again.

Wow, this was so good we couldn't wait long enough to take a photo. Beware these are highly addictive, and actually very easy to make.  Skip on the rice and pair with a salad (with Doritos)  so you can have extra room for more shells! I'm semi vegetarian so I made shells with beans only, and ended up enjoying the beef filled shells even more. My advice is get creative with your fillings, next time we plan to mix the beef and beans together before filling the shells, adding a jalapeño and cheese inside. Can't wait to make this recipe again.

This was awesome!! I used a bit more cream cheese, and substituted chili powder for taco seasoning since I was out of chili powder.  Also added onion and cilantro into meat after it was cooked and drained.

This recipe was SO delicious and pretty easy to make. We didn't add onions or black olives. We used a lot of cheese and a medium taco sauce! In the future I may use a spicier sauce for more flavor and add tomatoes and/or avocado. Will definitely be making this again and again!

I tried this recipe today.  And, let me say it was great!  I did use the taco seasoning as suggested by others.  I also added a can of refried beans and a can of Rotel tomatos with green chilis.  Can't wait to make again when guests come over.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, and a good starting point.  I'm not sure why people rated it poorly when there is ample time to make adjustments.  It's not like something that you toss in the crock pot and can't taste.  Anyway.  I omitted the salt, added a package of taco seasoning and some cumin and oregano to suit our tastes, put in 4oz cream cheese, and added some of the shredded to the meat mix.  No butter, just threw them in some cold water to stop the cooking and keep them separated.  I didn't have taco sauce so I put salsa in the blender and added some enchilada sauce.  I thought they were really good.  The 2 year old didn't care for them but the hubby and I liked them.  Next time I will omit the chips during cooking, they got kinda soggy.  This is something I would make ahead a bunch at a time and freeze for my crazy days.  A good meal that is quick, different, and tasty.  Thanks!

Love it! I tweaked as well subbing turkey meat most times. But I've also used diced chicken and chorizo - all times delish.

I usually double the recipe and I made a few changes to the recipe: I use taco seasoning instead of chili seasoning and I top with a can of tomatoes and chiles as well as the taco sauce. I also use any 3 random bags of cheese (mexican, taco, monterrey, cheddar, colby jack). I have found it doesn't matter which cheeses I use it is always a HUGE hit!!!

Love this recipe. My husband isnt much of a fan of cream cheese. He said it was an okay dish. Well until he starts cookin he's going to get what I like and thats Mexican food and cream cheese! I also premade this to take to a family members house and put it in the oven when I arrived. This would be a great dish for working parents that can prepair this the night before and put it in the fridge. Then when they get home throw it in the oven.

Fifty stars!!!!!!!! It is delicious!!!!!!! We make it again and again and again.  I homeschool and am teaching my three daughters to cook.  They have to pick a recipe of something new and make it.  My oldest daughter after searching and searching picked this one out of the ones that come in the email daily and put into a recipe file.  She followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Every member of the family enjoyed this and asked for it to be made again.  Now it is in our rotation, since we make this all the time.  I prefer this to traditional tacos in the hard or soft shell.  For the next get together we attend I will definately make this so more people may enjoy your recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing this delicious dish!!

I took note of the many suggestions, and this is one of those recipes that actually turned out "Wow" first try!  

After a 1/2 dozen batches, my tweaks include mixing 1 pkg reduced-sodium taco seasoning, 2 tsp minced garlic (love it), 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes & chilies, and light cream cheese into browned turkey.  Toss cooked shells in lime juice instead of butter.  I use 28 oz. green (prefer over red) enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce (served w/ green salsa to match).  Top w/ reduced-fat Mexican blend cheese.  

Finally, I mix 1 tbsp each lime juice and fresh chopped cilatro (and lime zest if I feel exotic) into 1 boil-in bag of cooked rice -- goes like a dream on the side!

No kidding, I now get cheers when I just say I'm going shopping for the ingredients for this recipe.

this was such a creative twist on tacos + stuffed shells! very easy to make, but i give it 4 stars because making it the first time, it lacked taco flavor. the second time around i added in taco seasoning to the meat & cream cheese mixture. i also recommend softening the cream cheese before adding it in with the ground beef. it isn't necessary to coat the shells in butter, so i also skipped that the second time around and they still came out great. another recommendation i would make (based on taste preferences) is to add some diced tomatos, olives, green onion, etc... to top them off. great twist on tacos and good, creative recipe!

I gave this 3 stars based on the original recipe.  However, I found that it wasn't "taco-y" enough so I have done the same as others and used taco seasoning in place of salt and chili powder.  I also added a can of black/pinto beans and a few kernels of frozen corn. We also used pepper jack cheese.  Yum!! The kids love it, and with the changes I rate it a 5!!

I doubled the recipe and made it for a casual dinner party. I used cream cheese that has onions in it and taco seasoning rather than chili powder. I had it all assembled before the guests arrived and just popped it in the oven when the time was right. Our guests raved about how good it was. This is a keeper!

Good, but not great.  Not worth the effort of stuffing the shells, which wanted to break apart.

Very good...made a couple minor changes.  Used taco seasoning instead of the salt and chili powder and used Quessea cheese instead of the monterey jack.  Turned out great and even my pickiest eater in the house devoured them.

This recipe is AMAZING! My husband and I enjoyed this so much, we will definitely be having this again VERY soon! The only thing I did differently was add taco seasoning to the meat, as well as Rotel. Other than that I left the recipe alone. I was so suprised at how good the shells tasted with the filling! Probably my favorite recipe I've found on this site. Definitely recommend!!

I made this tonight for my Husband and I. I agree with some previous comments that the meat needs a little more seasoning. Otherwise I think this recipe was a yummy addition to our expanding newlywed menu :)

In a word: YUM!   I make this all the time now,  it's one of those craveable recipes you can't get enough of.   Sometimes I use a packet of Taco Seasoning instead of the chili powder.

Turned out very yummy. I added refried beans in each shell, and also sprinkled some taco seasoning over the cheese. Also used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. 5 stars with modifications!

This was good and I will make it again, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  I also used taco seasoning, but in addition to the chili pepper and salt, not instead of.  I also added some garlic and cumin to the meat to help boost the flavor.  Lastly, before adding the cream cheese, I added one can of diced tomato and green chile to the meat.  I used a store bought taco sauce, which was ok, but it needed more than the 1 cup suggested.  I topped it with light sour cream, which brought out a lot of the flavors.  All around it was a hearty and satisfying meal, but it could have used a little extra punch in the flavor department.

I made this last night for dinner.  I usually like quick and easy on a weeknight and this was more involved than I had anticipated.  It was good but there were some things I didn't care for.  The recipe doesn't say to drain the ground beef after cooking it but I always do, but when you add the seasoning and the cream cheese it was very dry, there was nothing to "simmer"  so I kept adding water, a little at a time to moisten it. I also felt it needed something else so I did add some of the cheese to the ground beef mixture. After thinking about it, I should have used the taco sauce for more flavor.  I finished the recipe as stated but I didnt like the crushed tortilla chips on the top, it looked like a mess when it came out of the oven.  I could have just served these shells with the chips on the side and melted the cheese in the microwave.  My 11yo son loved it, I thought it was good and my husband thought it was so so.  I probably won't make again because it was time consuming and didn't yeild great results.

Fantastic!  I made this exactly as the recipes states.  It was so delicious.  The cream cheese added to the meat gives this dish the perfect amount of richness.  This will be a regular on our dinner table.

This was fabulous. I too, like other reviewers, used taco seasoning vs. chili powder. It was a bit dry, so next time, I will water down the taco sauce a bit. This was a fun twist on traditional shells. We loved it! Will definitely make again :) Thanks for sharing.

Loved this recipe.  My young adult boys love Mexican and Italian food - what a great way to combine the two.  I used salsa, but other than that, I cooked it as dircted.  Yummy!

Very good!! I got thumbs up all the way around the table tonight! I used taco seasoning in the beef instead of the chili powder and salt, and omitted the butter (just rinse pasta in cold water). Served with all the normal taco fixings so everyone could prepare their own, and it was a big hit. We will definitely be making "taco shells" again :)

This is an awesome new take on tacos! I would never have thought to use cream cheese but it really makes this recipe special. My husband was a huge fan of this. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used a packet of taco seasoning in place of the chili powder and salt, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This will definitely be going in our weekly rotation! Thanks!

Super delish!  I used enchilada sauce, and added olives, green onions, and cilantro.  I also added a can of refried beans and shredded chicken.  Will definitely make again.

I had to adjust and use canneloni as my local store was out of the Jumbo sheels. I found the tubed pasta hard to stuff and they came apart easily. The  rest of the recipe was great. I'll use Fritos for a better taste the next time. I will also try using a large Wonton wrapper baked in a muffin pan.

I had to come back and change my review...the next day, I thought it was awesome!  

It was okay...I used ground turkey and didn't have the tortilla chips (forgot).  I might make again but omit the cream cheese and prepare it like you do regular tacos (taco seasoning).

These are awesome!! My daughter, who is a picky eater, even ate them and took leftovers to school for lunch:)
The only thing I did different was instead of taco sauce I used some marinara over the top. Only because my husband doesn't like spicy foods.
This will definitely become a staple meal in our home.

Pretty good. Needed to add extra sour cream, used taco seasoning instead of chili powder and salt, and will add tomato, cilantro, green onions next time.

Wow. As other reviewers have stated, I did substitute the chili powder with taco seasoning (Taco Bell brand). Also, I did not use as much sour cream. For the toppings, I did use diced tomatoes and a very small amount of finely chopped olives.

Very simple and pretty delicious! I added slightly more cream cheese (5 oz) and added a little bit of (1/2 tsp) cayenne pepper to spice up the meat. I followed the recipe to a "T" aside from that. Really great would make again!

This was a great idea. After reading a few reviews I too made a few changes. I added Rotel with habanero peppers and a packet of taco seasoning to the meat (I used ground turkey). I also used medium salsa over the top of the shells instead of taco sauce. I added some to the bottom of the baking dishing to prevent sticking as well. These few additions made it quite spicy and flavorful! When topped with sour cream and black olives it was delicious!

This was great! BUT it does not turn out like the picture at all. It is more like a casarole dish. Make sure you butter the baking dish! I also want to try mancotti pasta instead of the shells. For a famliy with kids who always want tacos or pizza only, this was a win-win.

kids enjoyed.  My only reservation was the thought of a taco in a pasta shell....texture.  Tasted fine, using taco seasoning and Enchalida sauce.  Also a must is chopped onion and garlic to the meat when browning.   Will make again some day....?

It was a hit. I did half salsa and half taco sauce. I did as most other reviewers did and just used taco seasoning with 4 oz of cream cheese. I also browned the meat with garlic and onion. I added about a cup of black beans to the meat mixture too! Yummy, i think next time I will try it with enchilada sauce instead.

I really liked these!! I would use more cream cheese as other reviews have said, and soften it first. I used salsa instead. They were delicious...though, didn't seem like a fast recipe. I did the whole box of shells and was glad I did. To find 18 that were whole was a close call, but I bought generic. Maybe that was it.

My family really enjoyed this. Didn't have Jack, so only used cheddar. Didn't have prepared salsa, but did have some garden tomatoes and Thai peppers, so zipped those up in the food processor, put a little on bottom and poured the rest over the top. 

We do have one non-meat eater in the house, so I made a similar filling for a second pan out of taco-seasoned lentils - also added about 1:1 ratio of lentil to meat in that mixture to stretch it and give some texture. 

For the amount of assembly, I would probably double it next time so there would be leftovers - and if I was in a hurry, may opt for a casserole style dish with smaller pasta. 

I agree with others that this got better after sitting awhile - really brouht out the taco in it. 

Nice idea! Thank you!

I gave this 4 stars because I made some modifications. I sprinkled the ground beef with cumin. We used the new santa fe cooking cream cheese - awesome! Leave out the salt. I used more taco sauce to line the bottom of the pan and then to ensure all the noodles were covered. I used the Sargento Artesian blend Mexican cheese!  Delicious!  Almost the best meal ever. My youngest asked if I could make this 100 times! :)

I made this the first time using my family as guinea pigs.  They devoured it!  I decided to take it to a covered dish dinner at church, and it was a hit.  I had several requests for the recipe.  I used fat free versions of the ingredients, and it was still good.  Coating the cooked shells with butter before baking was a critical step in keeping these moist...don't skip it!

These were really good. I made them using taco seasoning and added a little water and let simmer. I am not much of a meat eater so I only had one shell and I though it was pretty tasty. My stepdaughter and husband loved it and it was pretty easy to make.

I followed the recipe except I added a spoonful of black beans at the bottom of each shell.  The whole family enjoyed it- I used spicy taco sauce on 1/2 and mild on the other so all would be happy. 

My son heated up leftovers the next day in the toaster oven using the "toast" setting.  He said it was fast and made it into yummy, crispy finger food.  So there's the 11 year old's tip.

I am always looking for something new to try, glad that this was one that I did! It was great change to the regular Tex/Mex cuisine. I added sauce in the bottm of pan as others suggested and put in a few Jalpenos for the bite! It was a great meal and will be made many more times, Thanks!

My family loves tacos so I wanted to try something different. My family loved these tacos in Pasta Shells and mine came out perfect. It takes a little more effort to make these than regular tacos but it is worth the effort and additional ingredients.

Yummy!!  I love the crunch of the tortilla chips!  I used HOT taco seasoning mix instead of the chili powder to add some heat.  I also used ground turkey instead of the beef.  I was delicious!!

Wonderful concept, but it would have been bland without additional spices. I put 2 T of medium hot chili powder, 2 t oregano, 2 t cayenne, 1 t salt, 2 t garlic powder and 2 t onion powder. used 2.5 cans of meijer red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. 1 can for layer underneath shells and 1.5 cans for on top of shells. I used lean ground turkey (1 lb) and a full package of fat free cream cheese and it only made enough to stuff about 13 shells so next time I will double the meat and use 2 full pkgs cream cheese. topped with chopped fresh cilantro, chopped tomatoes, sour cream and chopped green onion and served with fat free re fried beans . I also made this before I went to work, popped in my fridge and when I got home I took out of fridge and preheated the oven. Easy dinner! and delicious :]

I was expecting the meat to taste more like a taco. It didn't taste like a taco at all with the cream cheese mixed in. If I make again I will omit the cream cheese and add taco seasoning. My kids weren't really impressed with this one. They complained it was too creamy tasting.

These were very good. To me it was a little time consuming. I used a little more meat and cream cheese because 3 oz just didn't seem like it would be enough to bring the mixture together. I would say I used about 5 oz give or take. I brown my meat with taco seasoning, green chilies, and onions. I used a 16 oz jar of original Ortega brand taco sauce and it was more than enough. Next time I may only use 12 oz. Be sure to pour a little in the bottom of the pan before placing the shells in. This recipe is simple, good, and economical!

Made two changes:  used refried beans instead of ground beef (I'm a vegetarian) and used taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  Really cool idea and easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Overall this was a good dish with a couple of changes.  My substitutions were: ground turkey for the ground beef, reduced sodium taco seasoning for the chili powder and salt, and red enchilada sauce for the butter.  Some other changes / suggestions: line the 9 X 13 dish with foil for easy clean up, definitely use a little taco sauce (the green was my favorite) on the bottom to prevent the shells from drying out, use the tortilla chips that have a touch of lime, and add some crumbled queso fresco when serving (I did cut back a bit on the Cheddar and Monterey).  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good, and I can be picky.  I did change it.  Instead of chili powder I did reduced sodium taco seasoning like suggested.  I added a can of Rotel and a dollop of sour cream in the meat.  I also did a dash of garlic powder and sauteed onions in the meat.  Very good!  I also baked for less than 25 minutes so the noodles wouldn't dry. Parts still did and of course that is the first thing hubby commented on.  But then he sd it was pretty good.

Followed others advise and used taco seasoing for the meat instead of using chili. Everything else, I kept the same. The family loved them..Since I doubled the recipe..we had plenty of leftovers. Just as good, if not better, the next day warmed up in the Micro. Thanks for sharing!

These were very good...I added 1/4 C black beans to the filling. I used red enchilada sauce and taco seasoning as many of the other reviewers had suggested. I don't think it needed a full 15 minutes after the cheese was added because the pasta shells did get crispy. I would definitely make again-my whole familiy enjoyed this.

A very nice change of pace from tacos, burritos and traditional Italian stuffed shells. I used regular taco seasoning since I had a packet. I served with corn and refried beans. It received an immediate "this is good" from someone who never comments on anything!

Simply amazing and easy. I did do a few things differently, I added about 1/4 cup of chopped green pepper and red onions, and a small can of green chilies right before adding the cream cheese. I was unaware that I did not have any chili powered but I did have Cumin, Paprika, and Cayenne powers and they really added a kick to the dish! This dish is very light and tasty. I highly recommend this if are looking for something different!

This was such a wonderful change from all the rest of the Taco type recipes! WE LOVE IT!! I didn't have chili powder so I used a half package of Taco Bell Fajita seasoning mix, other than that I stuck with the original recipe. My husband already told me WE WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN!

Enjoyed this very much! Make a couple extra shells in case some fall apart during boiling if you care that they're all in shell form.

Very good...I added more chili powder and taco seasoning. I also found that it wasn't enough to feed a family of 5, so I did 2 lbs of meat and 2 dishes. For my kids who freak out over red sauce, I used a different sauce on the 2nd dish: cream of chicken soup (undiluted) mixed with a small container of sour cream. Put a little on the bottom of the dish, spooned the rest over the shells. ALL of us liked this version best, but enjoyed it the other way as well.

Very good recipe! I used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder also and mixed some salsa in with the meat mixture and it was delish!! Serving size is 6 but I only got 3 out of it. Probably because my boyfriend had seconds. I definitely will make again.

This turned out great!  Before I had even sat down to eat my friends were saying how awesome it was. I poured some sauce in the bottom of the dish as others suggested and it worked out well!  Will definitely be making this again and again.

I was a little skeptical of these, but they turned out very well. We eat a lot of tacos so this was a fun way to eat tacos in a little different style!

My kids love this meal- we also use this for our regular Taco filling and as a dip.  Our only change was to decrease the amount of cream cheese.  The kids are even making this one!

My husband loved these.  I made them as reviewer "Stacy" suggested---I froze leftovers and they cooked up very nicely after being frozen.  Husband is asking for these again as he loved them so much.  Thank you grannycancook....

I used taco seasoning like other reviews suggested and it was successful.  I also paired this with some cilantro lime rice and refried beans.  My husband loved the pasta shells!

Taste great and feeds a lot!  I gave three stars because the original recipe leaves a little to the imagination.  I added a ton more taco sauce than suggested and would recommend adding green chilies to the mix.  For a quicker and easier prep just make as if it's a ziti bake and you don't have to fill shells.

This is a great recipe, that can be easily modified to suit people wants (or in my case what I had on hand)...I made them with these modifications: vegetarian fake ground “beef” (morning star), manicotti instead of shells, Mexican Chez mix, and for the sauce I did half the dish pure tom sauce and the other a canned enchilada sauce; also, added black olives & lettuce to the topping. The pasta tasted really good, was not that fond of the sauces I used (not recipes fault). Will def. make again trying a diff taco sauce.

This is one of my son's favorites! The filling is great, I don't change a thing then I let everyone add their own favorite taco toppings. It's super easy and can be made ahead of time.

Super simple and VERY kid friendly.I did use taco seasoning as i was out of chili powder and i threw in a (15 oz) can crushed tomtato with green chilies into the meat mixture and 1 clove garlic and a small sweet onion.My kids do not like raw onions and this way i can sneak in some extras :) But they and i love this meal.Served with a side salad and chocolate pudding.Super easy kid friendly meal with no leftovers.I will put this in my meal rotation.Thanks :)

I used ground turkey, 3 oz. of my Zesty Ranch Dip in place of the cream cheese, D's Famous salsa and a good dose of Bill Echol's taco seasoning (minus the salt). I also used a 2% cheese. My boys inhaled this and I was able to eat them with less guilt. Great with a hearty side salad. With the creamy dip stirred inside, there was really no need for the extra sour cream.

This was really good although it tasted more like an enchilada casserole than a taco. I added the crushed chips to the cheese and sprinkled it on together. The chips got slightly soft but still had a crunch...yummy.

We love this.  If you like tacos and pasta, it's a perfect match.  I usually substitute taco seasoning for the spices in the meat.  I have batches of taco meat premade/frozen...so it's quick to defrost premade taco meat, then nuke the cream cheese.  I don't use 1 c of taco sauce either, I just squirt some on the shells and follow the rest of the recipe.  I like to serve them topped with shredded lettuce and salsa.

Loved this recipe! I used 4oz cream cheese, one can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, 1lb of ground turkey, and one envelope of taco seasoning in place of the chili powder/salt. I also spread a thin layer of taco sauce on the bottom of the dish to help keep the noodles moist. Thanks to all the previous reviewers who left such great tips. This turned out fantastic! My husband loved it and we will definitely be making it again! :-)

Boyfriend loved it and said we needed to add it to the recipe folder. I also used enchilada sauce, like other reviewers said. i put some on the bottom and some on top. And of course, cause I love cheese, I covered them in cheese. I omitted the crushed chips.

I was skeptical at first, but they turned out great with a minor change. I used taco seasoning instead of chili powder because it sounded too bland. Overall, a good quick meal that freezes really well.

SO YUMMY! I didn't have any taco sauce, so I just put half a can of petite cut tomatoes with garlic and olive oil over top of the shells with some tex mex seasoning.  It was so good.  I'm definately going to make this again!!

They were okay.  I was disappointed, as the ingredients sounded mouth-watering.  We all ate them, but not sure we'll make again.  Taco seasoning, as others have said, would probably be better than the chili powder.  I did put a whole stick (8oz) of cream cheese, but still "meh".

My only changes are: I added sauteed onions to the beef, browned the beef and added chopped tom. I used 4oz of cream chez, a taco seasoning packet and I didn't have taco sauce so I just poured some green salsa. But some kind of red sauce should be used (my shells lacked that nice red color that is pictured). And the tortilla chips are neccesary because it gives it a much needed crunch. VERY TASTY DISH!!!!!

I had tacos in pasta shells years ago when a friend made it. Her recipe was amazing. I lost the recipe and have been looking for a replacement ever since. This was "OK". I made it as is and it just seemed to be missing something. Next time I attempt this recipe, I think I will add way more toppings and work on the filling.

I used 2 lbs. ground beef and was glad I did.  I used all of it.  For this amount I added 1 8oz. block of light cream cheese and subbed homemade taco seasoning and lots of fresh ground pepper instead of just chili powder.  The filling was yummy but a little on the rich side.  I poured a little red enchilada sauce and some picante sauce on the bottom of the pan and then also drizzled a little over the top.  Topped with chopped green onions.  I baked covered with foil and at the end of baking time, removed the foil, topped with shredded jack and cheddar and sliced olives.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that it is a somewhat greasy dish.  Even though I drained off all the grease from the meat there was a bit pooling at the bottom of the dish.  The kids loved it though.

Very good idea! I did change things up a bit. For the meat, I added taco seasoning to the meat with the cream cheese. I baked it according to the recipe with taco sauce. (also i didn't have taco sauce to I Googled it to make it homemade, and was very easy!) When they were done I topped it with green onion, olives, and then sprinkled the cheese on top. Brought the temperature down so the cheese slowly melted. On the side I had a small salad of iceberg lettuce and tomato.I didn't use the sour cream because the meat was creamy enough with the cream cheese.

Pretty good as written.  Next time I will try adding more cream cheese and some chopped jalapenos and tomatoes.  I think this would be popular at a pot-luck because the concept is unusual but it tastes good.  Makes good leftovers, too.

Taste was below average. Effort was well above average. Verdict: not worth it. There's probably a reason the Italians use ricotta in their shell filling. The cream cheese took forever to melt into the beef mixture.

We loved this.  We used 8oz cream cheese as well as many of the viewers.  We also diced up some peppers really small and added it to the meat mixture.  We then used an Enchilada Sauce from Allrecipes posted by Anna Marie.  That was toooo die for.  We changed the serving size of her sauce to 6 servings.  It was perfect.  Then topped with lettuce, tomato, black olives and sour cream.  We might try using Doritoes on the top next time instead of the tortilla chips.

These were good.  Different way to make stuffed shells.  I'll definitely make them again.  I did use 1/2 a packet of "Ortega" taco seasoning instead of the chili powder.  Thanks for the recipe!

We enjoyed this.  I replaced the taco sauce with two jars of Newman's mild salsa.  The crunch of the tortilla chips is essential.

I seldom give 5 stars but this one works on several levels: it's a different and unique presentation, has great flavor and is reasonably simple to make. After reading several suggestions in the reviews I subbed a pkg of taco seasoning for the salt/ chili powder, enchilada sauce for the taco sauce, added a can of Rotel, and skipped the sour cream. preparing it earlier in the day made it easier to visit with our friends before the final cook. Oh - and a few ounces of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the baking dish DOES keep everything from sticking!!! Try it.

Great recipe. I accidentaly used taco seasoning instead of taco sauce. I think it turned out fine with it. My husband has already asked that I make again sometime soon.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! My husband even loved it. I took the suggestion of others and used Lawry's Taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and salt, when adding the taco seasoning I add a little water to dillute the taco seasoning. The meat, cream cheese mixture soaked it right up so it wasn't runny. I also added 3 large cloves of minced garlic and green onion to the meat mixture. Topped it with sour cream and cilantro.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers.  This recipe will become a regular in our home. Thanks for sharing this one.

I loved this recipe! I'm a very picky eater so i did without the sour cream and cream cheese. I added taco mix to the ground beef and mixed in a handful of cheddar cheese. Then i added lettuce after i baked it. This recipe was awesome even without all the extra ingredients. Must try! Will be making this again and soon!

Great dish! I used 1 & a half T. of taco seasoning instead of chili powder & 4 oz. of cream cheese(will use all 8 oz. next time). Will also use some garlic & chopped onions in the beef. Will expand beef (& adjust other amounts of ingredients) to at least 1 & a half to 2 pounds to be able to use whole box of shells. Neighbors had a taste, & it got rave reviews.  Yummy!

I sprayed the dish with cooking spray and had no problems with sticking. I used elbow noodles instead of shells and mixed the meat with the noodles and pressed into the 9x13 baking dish.  Poured enough taco sauce to cover the mixture.  I would do this again but add some onion and green pepper.   We didn't think the left-overs were that good but liked it the first day.

Our family loved it. It was pretty easy and i love one dish meals for our busy family. Husband loved it and he is a picky eater. I didnt have shells so i just mixed it all together with cooked penne pasta and it was delicious.  Tastes just like a taco. I used the taco seasoning I recipe from this site and i toasted up strips of soft tortilla shells for the chips.  Will make often. Can use either ground turkey or beef. Cant wait to make it for a picnic.

I've used a recipe very similar to this one.  The only difference is that you add a packet of taco seasoning to the gound beef.  Can't imagine the dish without.  Also, I didn't have Taco Sauce so I used red Enchilada sauce instead.  SO YUMMY!!!  I will use Enchilada sauce from now on.  My husband loves this dish.  Great for packing in lunches the next day.  Delish!

Yummy dish!  I did lighten up this recipe a bit buy using ground turkey, light cream cheese and sour cream, along with 2% cheddar/pepper jack cheese.  I took other's advice and added salsa to the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking, taco seasoning, and omitted the chips completely.  Topped them with a few black olives and on each shell I added a sliced jalapeño pepper!  Everyone raved and I will surely make this again!

Our family loves these.  I admit they are a little dry compared to most of the saucier recipes we eat but I usually add a little extra sauce on the shells after baking.

Pretty tasty dish!  The meat was a little dry (not too bad though), next time I might try adding some taco sauce (or perhaps salsa) to the meat mixture before filling the shells.  Definitely a keeper!  Maybe some fresh jalenpenos on top would give it a little extra kick.
Thanks for a great dish!

Because I initially thought the meat mixture was rather bland, I added half an enchilada seasoning packet, and also some garlic powder. I also used Cool Ranch-flavored Doritos for the topping. Oh, I found that 8oz ground beef was enough to completely stuff 5 jumbo pasta shells. This ended up being really delicious. Thanks, grannycancook!

These were really good!  I came across this recipe as a comprimise.  One of us wanted tacos, one didn't.  My boyfriend was a bit leery of the recipe, but thoroughly enjoyed it once prepared.  I used a taco seasoning packet instead of chili powder.  I poured salsa onto bottom of baking dish and drizzled both taco sauce and salsa over the stuffed shells.  I used crushed corn chips on top of the cheese.  Next time, per request, I will add more cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I also found this recipe in one of my cookbooks...I've made this several times and it is a HUGE hit, EVERYONE loves it.  So much so that I'm really shocked there were some bad reviews.  We even fight over the leftovers the next day.  DELICIOUS!

Edible, seems I've eaten many more traditional mexican dishes that taste a lot like this did. The shells just gave it an odd look, and frightened off the children.

This was a BIG hit with my family...they say they prefer this to the "traditional" tacos & tacos are one of their favorites!  I used a package of taco seasoning instead of the chili powder.  My picky daughter, who hates leftovers, even heated it up the next day.  Thanks!

My family reaaly liked this.  I did make several modifications, though. I cooked the meat with taco seasoning as suggested.  Then instead of taking the time to stuff pasta shells, I layered meat and cheese with cooked ziti in a casserole dish.  To insure it wouldn't turn out dry, I layered in generic tomato based pasta sauce that I added a bunch of cumin and chili powder to.  I omitted the chips, but served with sour cream.  I was surprised how yummy this was. Pasta doesn't seem like it would go with tex-mex.  But this is good.

My husband I loved this dish. He was a bit nervous about it before I made it...and so was I! In the end, we really enjoyed it. I'm glad that I heeded the advice from some people that had made it before. I used taco seasoning and garlic powder insead of taco sauce, and to lighten it up, I used reduced fat cream cheese. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and I added a can of Rotel tomoatoes with green chiles to the turkey mixture. So, I guess that I made a few changes, but the granny's got the right idea! :)

I did not care for this meal at all. I didn't like the combination of taco sauce with the pasta shells. Thanks, but I will stick to spaghetti sauce next time.

I first got this recipe about 10 years ago and made it frequently as it was a favorite, but then I lost the recipe and was so excited to be able to find it here.  

This is so easy to make.  I prefer it without the chips on top, but other than that, I will make this quite a bit.

What a great idea!  I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner.  A new and tasty way to have our Mexican food fix.  I did add more chili powder, some garlic powder, minced onion and a little cumin, as I do my regular taco meat.  Will make this often.  Thank you granny!

These were VERY good, and oh so quick and easy to prepare!  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and also served it with salsa, sour cream and homemade gaucamole on the side for toppings.  It was very well received by my whole family.  I will be making this dish again and again...

I have made this a few times and it is always nice. I soften onion with the meat (or veggie meat) with jalapeno then and add garlic....I use a good amount of taco seasoning, cumin and chili powder. Add a bit of broth(chicken or veg) and simmer for thirty minutes or so before adding the (limited) cheese...cottage and whatever I have seems to do well...never used cream cheese out of preference. I add a variety of toppings to the stuffed shells...cilantro, onion, olives, avocado, sour cream, queso or pico,...whatever you like! Thankyou!

I did a few things different, I only boiled the pasta for the minimum of 8 minutes so the shells held their shape, I used a packet of taco seasoning instead of the salt/chili powder, I also added a can of diced tomatoes w/green chili’s to the meat mixture. I spread salsa on the bottom of the pan before I placed the shells in. Topped with crushed chips and cheese.

My family loved this. I used only the listed ingredients but sort of doubled the recipe. 2lbs of beef and 6oz of cream cheese was enough to fill 32 jumbo shells. I put some sauce on the bottom so it didn't stick. I forgot the toppings but it was delicious anyway. So easy!

Excellent recipe! The cream cheese in the scrambled meat was new to me but my granddaughters, brother and I all loved it. I used 2/3 instead of 1/3 of the cream cheese block. 4 stars because, being a Mexican food lover, I knew that just chili powder was no where near enough spice so I added cumin and garlic powder (I only use California garlic powder because I like the colors in it and the heavier grit) and some salt. I didn't have enough red taco sauce so I combined red and green.  I didn't measure the cheeses, just covered the dish... a lot! I served this with refried beans and a chopped salad topped with canned Mexi-corn.  Next time I will try this in lettuce cups to lighten it up....SO delish!

Clever and delicious recipe!  I did tweak this to add my own spin.  I added diced onions and green pepper to the beef mixture and drained the grease off before adding the cream cheese.  I used 'El Pato' in place of the taco sauce and added a couple tablespoons to the beef mixture along with a sprinkle of cumin.  I didn't have the recommended cheeses, so I subbed a mix of pepper jack and cheddar.  Definitely going in the rotation of regular dinners.  Thanks!

For those who  are confused by all of the alterations to this recipe noted in the reviews, MAKE IT AS LISTED. This dish is fabulous as written. Glad I did. Hubby loved this one and so did I.

Made this as is, and had made it before and couldnt remember where I had found it, but am glad I found it again. Next time I make it, I think I'll use taco seasoning instead of the salt and chili powder and add onions to the ground beef as it cooks. Fresh tomatoes and shredded lettuce on top would be good also!

Added salsa to the bottom of the pan as suggested by others and shells didn't stick. Great recipe made quickly but eaten over a long period of time great days later :)

I had medium shells on hand so made more of a taco casserole.  I added onion powder for some additional flavor and salsa instead of taco seasoning.  This is a great base recipe that allows for substitutions based on what's in the pantry and fridge.

Used the 1 cup of taco sauce and mixed with one can red enchilada after reading reviews. You definitely need the lettuce, fresh chopped tomatoes,  black olives, and sour cream to make dish more refreshing and not so heavy.

My family loved this!!  They ate every bite and asked for more!  I made right by the recipe except I used Mild Taco seasoning instead of chili powder and I didn't have any chips to put on top , but no one missed them. We used sour cream and black olives for toppings. Will totally be making this again. Was a perfect supper. All I added was a salad :-)

Yes, I do not add the salt to the water while cooking the shells nor did I add 1 tsp salt to the recipe.  Did not mix the shells with butter either.  With all the cheeses, and the commercial sauces there is enough salt, in my opinion.  Also I did not use the tortilla chips.  I have made this several times and I use whatever tomato sauce I have available.  The  last time I added a chopped onion under the sauce which I liked when cooked.  It's a great recipe!

Really liked this one.  Great base recipe but made a few changes.  I used a packet of taco seasoning mix (followed directions on back) and small onion with the meat when browning for more flavor.   I used sour cream and chive cream cheese instead of plain.  Instead of a cup of sauce I used 1 - 16 oz salsa jar.  I poured some in with meat once  browned,  poured a small amount on bottom of baking dish so they don't stick leaving the rest for the topping. I had a little trouble with my chips getting a little to brown so I would put them on with about 10 minutes left.  In the end I topped with sour cream, black olives, green onion, fresh tomato and a little cilantro once shells were out of oven.  Delicious.   Great leftovers also.

I love this recipe!  I made it last night and it disappeared in minutes.  This dish makes me feel like a kid again.  My college age daughter told me it was summer camp food...this made me happy!  The only thing I changed was the chips...we like to kick it up with ranch dorritos!

I'm not much of a cook so initially I will follow a recipe exactly.  I didn't know whether to re-cover or not after adding cheese and chips so I opted for laying the foil over the pan and it came out just fine.  I do think that  next time, and I will make it again, that I'll leave the foil off.  Also the very last line in the directions stated to add sour cream and onions.  Onions?  Nothing mentioned about onions  anywhere.  Besides those two small issues, I found it easy and tasty.

Made his last night -- delicious!  had enough for two meals, so I froze the second one, without topping it with the crushed chips and cheese.  will add them when we eat it. (Don't believe the chips and cheese would freeze very well).  Great family meal.

I love the idea of taco in a pasta shell, I followed the recipe for the most part. Many reviewers mentioned it was a bit bland. So I added a can of drained Rotel to the hamburger mixture as well as some green onions and substituted taco seasoning where it called for chili powder.  I also used olive oil to prevent the pasta from sticking instead of butter. Lastly I put enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan as well as on top of the stuffed shells instead of taco sauce, and didn't add the crushed tortilla chips. My husband really liked the end result. I will make this again.

Made this spur of the moment and didn't have a lot of the stuff we usually put in tacos, but this still came out pretty good. Didn't have taco seasoning, which would have been preferable, but doubled the chili powder. Used a bit more cream cheese than called for, too. Used crushed taco shells instead of chips. Genius to think of putting this all in pasta shells. Overall, I would do this again, but with better planning.

I thought this was good, but a bit dry.  I mixed rotel with enchilada sauce and added some to the bottom of  the baking dish and to the filling.  I served on lettuce with some onions and sour cream.  I will make again.

So yummy! Made this like I would traditional tacos, just added the cream cheese. Browned ground turkey, added a can of black beans and a packet of taco seasoning. Then added cream cheese and fill the shells. My 7 year old inhaled these.

These were sooo good!  It's not often I say this tasted better than the picture looked, but these did!  Huge hit with the family - they told me to make a double batch next time so we can have leftovers :)  Thank you for this amazing dish.

I have made this recipe many, many times. I have begun to make the taco meat with taco seasoning, just as you would for regular tacos,, adding cumin to taste, and serving with all of our favorite toppings. I have also served these on a platter as finger appetizers, with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa on the side to place spoonfuls on each plate. Very big hit.

Substituted beef for Beyond Beef meet less, soy-less crumbles. Garnished with tomatoes and cilantro and put the onions on during first 15 minutes instead of the last due to my forgetting to buy chalots. Looks great...smells better!

This was great! Mexican food and all pasta are my daughter's two favorite things, so I knew this would be a winner for sure! My changes were as follows: I used ground turkey, added black beans and corn, made my own "taco sauce" with tomato sauce thinned out with water and seasoned with cumin, chili powder, garlic and onion powders, salt and pepper, I omitted the butter, using EVOO instead and I did not use the tortilla chips as I forgot about them, but can see how the crunch would be good! We topped with sour cream and they were a hit! Thanks for this recipe!

I made it and the family loved it. I used extra ground beef and doubled the cream cheese in it. I did not add any butter and for spices I used a package of taco seasoning. I sautéed onions and garlic and added to the ground beef and cream cheese mix then I stuffed the shells. I laid a single layer of the stuffed shells on a cookie sheet and froze them then sealed them.  Then when it was the day I needed them I just took frozen shells out put them in a single layer in a casserole dish on top of a jar of tomato sauce and bake them    Just before serving I talked with a layer of Mexican grated cheese mix and let them out and serve them immediately. On the table I had bowls of the usual taco toppings shredded lettuce green onions cheddar salsa baked beans chopped tomatoes and sour cream. This way everyone was able to dress Bears as they like them and then I had nacho chips on the table to crush and top it all  if you chose to

I modified this recipe and will definitely make it again.  I used a 375 g package of elbow macaroni instead of stuffing pasta shells and I used a 430 ml jar of medium salsa instead of taco sauce.  I would use less pasta next time, maybe 280 g and I would use more salsa; up to twice as much).  I doubled the chili powder and added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I used onion and chive cream cheese instead of plain.  Instead of adding the crushed tortilla chips and baking in the oven, I served them as a condiment.  It's a quick and easy dish to prepare and suitable for a family meal or casual company dinner.  The toppings served separately make it a little more fun.

Very good but a little too strong with taco sauce or salsa so I do half pizza sauce, half salsa and we like it much better. Great to be able to freeze them and retrieve what you need.

I usually make a recipe as written the first time. I almost always read reviews and wish I had this time. I only used 1 lb. ground beef since that's how our freezer beef is packed. Even with the lesser amount of meat, 3 oz. cream  cheese is not even close to being enough. I should have followed my instinct and added more. I used the butter and it was completely unnecessary. The shells stuck and were very hard on the bottom, so something needs to be spread on the bottom. Other reviewers' idea of using salsa is a good idea. Read other reviews and use the ideas that appeal to you. The recipe as written needs help.

I had trouble finding a 1 1/4 lb. package of ground beef, so I browned 2 lbs, added 5 oz. cream cheese, and boiled 30 shells.  Then I poured a bit more taco sauce over the shells than the 1 cup that the recipe calls for.   It filled a 9 X 13 dish and I have leftovers, which is great!  My family loved it!

I added onion, garlic powder and crushed red pepper to the meat mixture  and used 3 cups of Mexican blend cheese ( we're cheeseaholics in my house)  I also used tri color tortilla strips to add some color to it. Awesome dish!! I will definitely make this again! I think next time, I'll try canolli shells instead

I !made this as an alternative to Taco Tuesday and my crew loved it! I made with Vegetarian beef and used 1Tbsp. Bill Echols taco seasoning instead of salt and Chili powder. I topped it off with green onion, tomatoes and kalamata olives. Really good!

I have been making this for years.  Got the recipe from an old cookbook.  My kids loved it growing up and made it for parties at college and now they make it for their families.  The only change to the recipe is that I put the taco sauce in with the cream cheese and meat when cooking it.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but chanced making it anyway. I'm glad I did!  It is so yummy!  The only thing I would change is the store bought taco sauce. It isn't horrible, but sure wasn't my favorite.  Even with that I still give it 5 stars WAY UP!

Was pretty good. Was missing something to really bring it together. I added jalapenos and topped it off with some cheese. If there was a pay to season the shells it would be great.

This  was a lot of prep work for not a lot of taste. I did not like the crushed tortilla chips on top and I made the mistake of using lime salsa. It was also too dry. I will not make this again.

Delicious! Didn't use the tortilla chips and added a tiny bit of leftover taco seasoning, but everything else as recipe says. The meat mixture was so creamy and delicious. I made a double batch and every bit was eaten!

I made it per the recipe, but found the taco sauce a bit overwhelming. I'm going to take the advice of some of the other reviewers and try enchilada sauce next time.

I don't eat red meat so made it with ground turkey breast. I followed others advice and omitted the salt and chili powder using a package of taco seasoning instead and put some sauce on the bottom of the pan. Yum

SO GOOD! The cream cheese was a really creative and tasty twist to the recipe and my boyfriend, who is not a fan of pasta, asked me to make it again soon. I'd say this was a hit in my household!

This recipe is quite good as written, but I prefer it with taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and salt.  I've actually made it quite a few times now - I cook 2 lbs + of taco meat one night, freeze the leftovers and then just thaw that out to make this dinner another night.  Sometimes I supplement it with black beans, chopped green chilis or corn if I have less meat than I need.  :-)

I used 15 shells and a pound of hamburger. I diced half a large onion and cooked it with the meat. I used chili powder and cumin liberally, but no salt. I also eye-balled the cream cheese, and added until it stuck together nicely. I skipped the butter, and used green enchilada sauce and salsa verde instead of taco sauce. I baked the first round 8 minutes (non foil) and the second 15. I forgot the tortilla chips, though I was planning to follow the masa mash recipeanother reviewer had posted. I served with sour cream and cilantro. loved it, husband liked it pretty well. I'd try the taco seasoning mix next time.

Definitely putting this into the rotation! Make more than the servings call for though, since all the filling is meat, a little extra is worth it.

Great recipe...family loved it, easy to make.  Several adjustments we made were using four cheese spaghetti sauce as a substitute for the taco sauce.  We also ran out of meet filling so we filled the rest with cottage cheese...just as good or better!  The cottage cheese shells we covered with olives and mushrooms as well.  We also put some salsa on the top with the sour cream when we ate....amazing....

These tasted great and the family loved them.  Stuffing hot pasta shells was a little tricky for me, so I might make again and use manicotti or maybe just dump it all in a pan and make a casserole out of it.  Either way, I'm sure I'll be making it again!

I made this for my family, who love Mexican food.  Every week we have something Mexican so I wanted to find something a little different and found this gem.  It was fantastic and my kids and husband raved about it.  I used tortilla chips with a hint of lime and jalapeno and added a little sour cream to the meat mixture.  A fantastic dish and is definitely a 'do again'!!!

My fiance loved these when I made them for dinner. I didn't. I thought the shells got dried out when I put them back in the oven. I suggest you overcook the pasta by a few minutes if you decide to try it.

This was the first time I ever made any kind of stuffed pasta, and I will definitely do it agian!  A couple of alterations I made... I seasoned the meat with a packet of taco seasoning (no water).  This made it VERY seasoned.  I liked it but if you don't like very salty flavors you could use half a packet. I used a mix of taco sauce and salsa as a sauce over the shells, and it worked well. Lastly, I only had cheddar cheese, but it still tasted great. These save and reheat in the refridgerator and I imagine they would probably freeze pretty well too.  Thanks for the good recipe!

This was one of the best meals I've ever had.  I made it as directed and added fresh tomatos and onions when I served it.

Excellent recipe! The only thing we did a little bit different was to pour a little more taco sauce on them after cooking. My kids and hubby loved this! I will be making this again. A great recipe to use when you dont want the traditional type tacos!

Loveeeee this recipe.  Make it all the time, but I do change a few things. Leave out the salt and chili powder, and substitute a packet of taco seasoning instead.  Also, I have made it with and without the butter.  I did not see a difference.

This was good. I also used taco seasoning, but to me it was kinda dry as written. Next time I will buy more taco sauce, as 1 jar was not enough IMO. I also poured the sauce at the bottom of the pan to keep thinks moist, although I don't think it really helped much.

This was just okay and is way too salty.  I would skip the 1 tsp salt.  Wished I had just used salsa instead of taco sauce--way too much tortilla chips called for as well--not worth doing again

I used taco seasoning in the ground beef and salsa instead of taco sauce because it's what I had on hand. This is a very good meal.

I thought this was really good, as unconventional as it seemed.  It was pretty rich with the cream cheese added, which is good in moderation.  It took some time to prep, but tasted good.

Very good.  As this was the first time preparing this recipe, I followed the recipe as written.  Next time I will try a few changes.  One, I will try adding more cream cheese to the beef, maybe 6 oz.  The 3 oz called for just left the meet a little too dry.  I would also like to try stirring in some taco sauce to the beef mixture rather than only adding it on top - again, the beef mixture needed more moisture and just a little more oomph. I suggest offering the tortilla chips on the side if you plan on leftovers - the tortilla chips do not reheat well.  I will add a little more cheese to the top, maybe 1/2 cup more??  Also, the shells I used needed to cook longer - the recipe calls for 8 to 10, but the package called for I think 13 or something - 8 to 10 just wasn't enough, noodles were too tough.  Overall, very yummy, my 4 year old gobbled these up - seriously, she couldn't get enough!!!

I'm rating this high based upon the fact that it's very easy and tasty for what it is.  It's also forgiving and versatile.  My 14 year son was able to complete the recipe by himself making this as directed with beef, while I made the other half of the recipe using vegetarian "beef" crumbles.    Anyway, it's fun and good and quick to put together and seems to be popular with the non-adult crowd.  A fun break from regular tacos.

Love these! I followed the directions for the most part except I poured enchilada sauce over them prior to baking. I topped with lettuce and home made salsa. I've made this recipe before and I'll be making it for years to come. Delicious!

My husband says "man this is good and it really hits the spot".  That said, the recipe is good, I did double the chili powder, added onion powder, cumin and paprika for a spicier kick which is a personal preference in our household.  Next time I'll add more sauce as I thought they were a little dry.  This one is going into the family favorites folder.  Thanks for sharing a great idea.

Great basic recipe. I use turkey and neufchatel cheese in addition to omiting the butter and using a little taco sauce on the bottom to reduce some of the calories. Also, I used a low-sodium taco seasoning pack in place of the spices. The original recipes is great, but these modifications mean I can eat it a little more often ^_~

I made this for my family and they loved it!  I didn't have enough meat for all the shells so I tossed together some refried beans, salsa, corn, and filled the rest with that.  They liked having two to choose from!

These were so cute! What a great idea.  My boyfriend loves tacos, and I get so sick of them.  This was a great alternative.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks...By the way, I made one tray with tomato sauce at the bottom, and one with salsa and the bottom.  The dish with salsa was perfect.  I would recommend people trying this, they didnt burn and it added a great falvor.

This turned out pretty good. I did make a few changes though. Instead of using chili powder and salt, I used taco seasoning mix. Instead of taco sauce, I used a can of diced tomatoes and chilies. Also, from reading the reviews, I omitted the tortilla chips. I actually liked this recipe but my husband did not. That is why I gave it a three. I probably will not make it again.

Let me tell you my husband was very skeptical at first. He couldn't understand why we weren't just having tacos. But the entire family LOVED it (my husband said this definitely worth the extra steps to make). I did use 2# of meat and 8 oz of cream cheese so that I could use the entire package of jumbo shells. I also couldn't find my chili powder so I used 1 package of taco seasoning instead.  Other wise I didn't double anything else. It fit snugly in my 9 x 13 pan. The left overs were delicious the next day too. Thank you so much for the fabulous dish, I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe! It's easy and my boyfriend requests it often. I am a vegetarian and substitute soy crumbles for the beef and it works super!

Delicious! I had neither taco sauce nor salsa so I put some canned tomatoes, garlic, onion, chili powder, cumin, and paprika in the blender to make a sauce. It worked really well with the chips and cheese! Thanks for this recipe!

I made this a few days ago and even though my 5 yr. old didn't want to try it, my 4 yr. old said it was good and my husband enjoyed it as well.  I made a few changes.  I used ground turkey, neufachatel cheese, since I was out of chili powder I used hot sauce.  I topped with sour cream one day, then salsa another day, then diced tomatoes and sour cream the last day.  The salsa combination was great and I enjoyed the fresh tomatoes with sour cream.  This will be a keeper.  I will try different chips or not use them at all since it made it a tad salty.

This is a yummy recipe!  I used some chipolte chili in the meat for extra flavor and pureed the salsa topping just because.  All in all in all its one of the best non-authentic spanish recipes I have had.

This was good.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with chilies and little more then 3 oz of cream cheese.  Skipped tossing the shells in butter and just placed them in cold water after cooking.  Used a whole jar of taco sauce rather then 1 cup.  Everyone enjoyed it. Served them on a bed of lettuce with refried beans.  Skipped the tortilla chips.

SOOOOO Delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe! I did adapt a bit: I used 2 lbs. meat, 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 packet of taco seasoning, tsp. of chipolte chili powder, tsp. regular chili powder,pinch of salt, 4 oz. cream cheese. Put a little taco sauce on bottom of pan.  Rolled meat in lasagna noodles, top with more sauce (need double what's called for). So so yummy with sour cream and olives!!

Really liked this for something different. Will def. add to the dinner rotation. Only change might be more chili powder/taco seasonings. Forgot to add the chips, but didn't really miss them.

I loved this recipe!  I made a few changes, I substituted ground beef for ground turkey and I also used reduced fat cream cheese.  I also used a pack of taco seasoning, as some of the reviewers previously had stated.  The recipe was still full of flavor and delicous.

Most of the time I try to make a recipe first without changing the ingredients, but I did try this out on the family and chose to use ground chicken instead of the beef.  It tasted alright but obviously it would have had better traditional beef taco flavor using the beef.  I think this is also a recipe where you can really change up the ingredients to suit your own taste.

4 adults and 2 teens all liked this!  We were divided 3:3 on if it should rate 4 stars or 5 stars, but since I gave it 5 stars myself, that is the rating it gets!    It was pleasantly spicy.  Not too much, not too little.  I doubled the recipe but followed the instructions exactly including adding the salt, which I rarely ever do.  Next time I may eliminate the salt and see what the difference is.  It was not salty tasting at all but I just don't like to add salt to my cooking.    We had bowls of the sour cream and sliced black onions on the table to add to taste.  This is definitely a "keeper" and we will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These would make a great appetizer.  They are easy to make and easy to modify according to what you have on hand.  I was out of taco sauce and used salsa instead and it turned out great, I also only had cheddar cheese.  Next time I might try using refried beans instaed of the cream cheese.

Very yummy! Our family loved it! I used leftover taco meat already seasoned and topped the stuffed shells with chopped up tomatoes before adding the cheese and chips.  I served it on a bed of iceberg lettuce.  We would definitely make this again!  Next time I'd like to try adding chopped up avocado or guacamole at the end.

this was DELISH!  i will make this over & over again but i have decided that i will make it more of a lasagna type dish & layer it.  my pasta shells were all torn & it was very time consuming to stuff each shell.  thank you so much for this recipe my whole family really enjoyed this & even got my hubby's approval.  :)

This recipe was fair.  I was out of taco sauce, so I made the recipe with salsa and I didn't care for it too much.  Also, the recipe states to cook the sheels in boiling water for 8-10 minutes, my shells were pretty tough.  So next time, I would cook them longer.

We LOOOOVED this recipe! I wasn't sure about it at first (especially the chips) but it was fabulous. The only modifications I made were I added 1/3 cup chopped onion to the meat as it cooked, used 4 oz cream cheese, and instead of taco sauce (what's that- picante?) used a mixture of enchilada sauce and salsa. Garnished with lettuce, tomato, black olives. Yum Yum, it is part of my regular rotation now. Thanks grannycancook!

I brought this for a family reunion, and it was a big hit. I had bowls of cheese, diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, black olives, cheese, cilantro, sour cream and salsa around the dish. It was fabulous and very filling. Leftovers freeze well and are a snap to heat up in the microwave, with a little water and salsa added.

I love using pasta shells, however, I found this rather strange. I couldn't decided if I just liked it or loved it! The flavor was just fabulous. I think it would make the best tacos in the world using regular taco shells or perhaps a casserole. Somehow I just equate pasta shells with Italian food.

Very Good - made a ton of them and froze the leftovers - they heated up great. I didn't use the chips - but had lots of additions on the side - sour cream - olives - lettuce - shredded cheese - the kitchen sink!

Excellant.  I made this for a XC pasta dinner and the athletes devoured it!  I did add some onion and garlic while browning the ground beef and I didn't measure the taco sauce - just poured until it "looked right".

Loved it.  Did not add taco sauce,  Monterey Jack cheese,  tortilla chips + forgot the sour cream.  I replaced the Monterey Jack cheese with mozzarella cheese.  Taco sauce family gets touchy when I put hot sauce,  they know I like it.  Followed the rest as is & work out so good we had seconds.  Yum...Yum...  Good work on the recipe.

Pretty good! Everyone liked it...however, next time I think I will just use taco seasoning.

This is a very good recipe. For my own personal taste, I followed some of the suggestions in other reviews. I replaced the taco sauce with enchilada sauce and served the taco sauce on this side. Instead of just chili powder and salt, I made the seasoning blend that I use for authentic beef tacos. I did not use the crushed chips, as they didn't seem to go with the rest of the recipe. Also, instead of topping with sour cream and onions, I used a homemade pico de gallo, black olives, and sour cream. It's great that this is not only a delicious recipe as is, but that it can be changed in so many ways to accomodate different tastes. Next time I may even use chicken instead of beef! Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

Great recipe!  I added chopped onion and a packet of taco seasoning to the meat as I browned it.  I also added salsa to the bottom of the pan before I added the shells.  And I used enchilida sauce instead of taco sauce to cover the shells.  I doubled the recipe and with one pan I added the crused chips, the other one I didnt.  My husband said he liked the chips on top, one of my sons preferred it without.  Everybody else loved them both ways.  So good, its one of those fun easy recipes that deserves being made two nights in a row, lol!  Grannycancook is one awesome lady!!! :)

We loved this!!!! Next time I am going to try it with tomato and letuce on top after it is cooked. We did cook the meat with taco seasoning, cream cheese, and 2 tablespoons of sour cream, and that turned out really good.

Makes enough filling for 24-26 shells.  Definitely needs the topping to finish it off.  I'll try next time adding black beans and corn to the filling just to make it a little more mexican-food like.  But overall, really yummy base recipe!

These were not very good. There wasent much flavor. I would suggest adding 6 oz cream cheese, 1-1/2 tabl. chili powder, 2-3 chopped green onions, and a chopped red bell.

Yum! this is really good. I use 2 bottles of Ortega mild taco sauce. I pour one under the pasta and one on top.  Serves 2 adults and 2 kids. Had some meat left over, so I will boil 24 pasta shells instead of 18 next time. Tortilla chips are not necessary. I forgot to use them and it was fine without them.

I have received quite a few requests for this recipe.  I use the taco seasoning package and increase the cream cheese slightly.  Nice for football pot-luck dinners.  thanks for posting.

This was so yummy! I used ground turkey and added onions and diced tomatoes while the turkey was cooking and added a taco seasoning package.  Then used light cream cheese and 2% cheese for the topping.  I also took the advice of another review and used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Am having leftovers for lunch.  Thanks for the inventive idea!!!

I am giving this 4 stars based on the concept, very creative. But it definitely needed some tweaking...USE ENCHILADA SAUCE or SALSA and extra cream cheese. I also substituted ground turkey & taco seasoning. It came out great after a couple additions. It's great for a party or potluck.

Gave this a 5 based on the cool concept! I did, like many other reviewers, use taco seasoning on the meat (also found on this site). We eat tacos often, and though I thought the addition of cream cheese would be an interesting kick, I didn't find it to make a big difference in taste, only texture. I will not add cream cheese next time to save calories, especially since we top with sour cream anyway! I also suggest adding salsa to the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking and for that extra kick! I paired it with corn and black bean salad from this site--awesome dinner!!

Yummy! This is now a new family favorite. Sooo good. The only change i made was to add a full 8 ounces of cream cheese and I added garlic and onion powder into the meat mixture. Delicious!

Very good! My entire family enjoyed.  I substituted salsa for taco sauce and used 6 oz cream cheese. I added garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, pepper, & oregano to add some flavor.  I put the beef mixture into a baggie and piped it into the shells-very easy.  Watch the cooking time-at 30 minutes my shells were getting a little crispy.  Great recipe!

This was really good.  I used 8 oz. of cream cheese and I think that made a difference (in a good way).  I also used a packet of taco seasoning instead of the chili powder. Something about it was a little bitter and I'm wondering if it was the taco sauce?  Could be the taco seasoning too...that's what I get for trying to doctor a recipe that probably didn't need to be doctored! :)  Next time I might try using enchilada sauce.  My fiance loved it so I will make it again.

Even though I'm vegetarian, I decided to make this for my carnivorous boyfriend and his friends. I put extra taco sauce on the bottom of the baking dish and used doubled the amount of sauce reccomended. They all ranted and raved about how good  it was. They also liked the presentation of it with sour cream, tomatoes, and cilantro on top! Will make again.

I think the recipe was suppose to say 8oz package of cream cheese,not 3oz.  I added the whole 8oz package of cream cheese and a package of taco seasonings instead of chili powder and this came out quite nice.

My husband and I both loved this - very quick and easy for a weekday meal.  I used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and chunky salsa instead of the taco sauce - we don't like cilantro so I omitted that too.  Topped with sour cream, black olives, and cheese - very tasty!

Very good! I did make some changes based on other reviewers...I put in almost the entire 8oz bar of cream cheese, used a pack of taco seasoning instead of the dry spices, put enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and on top and did not use the tortilla chips. They turned out just delicious with the melted cheese on top and sour cream! These will be great to serve at my annual Halloween party!

My husband and I really enjoyed these! I made them with 1 bag of Soy Crumbles instead of beef and seasoned with Taco seasoning instead of the chili and salt. The mixture wasn't enough to fill all of the stuffed shells, so we did have some leftover pasta. I found the crushed tortilla chips to be unnecessary.

This receipe as is has no flavor to it.  It was very bland.  I ended up adding a package of taco seasoning to the meat and then some cheese too to help keep the filling together.  After the changes it was pretty good.

Delicious and the kids loved it.  I used taco seasoning mix and skipped the crushed tortillas.  Great with chili sauce as well.

YUM!  I love anything Mexican and these tacos in pasta shells were excellent!  My husband loved them also.  I plan to make them regularly - thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good, like lite tacos!  I substituted one bag of boil-in-bag brown rice for the cream cheese, and that was great!  Added a little extra salsa, plus some tomatoes and lettuce after the bake - yum!

I thought this was really good but a little salty for my taste.  Made exactly as written but did not top with sour cream.  Will make again.

My husband liked it. I thought it was Ok, but not something I would like to make very often. I think next time I make it I will add the cheese and torilla chips inside shells with meat mixture.

It was a nice change from stuffed shells.  I will make it again, but I will make it a little spicier.  I will include something sharper in the meat.  And possibly add veggies, like onion and tomato.

Use taco seasoning, its much cheaper & quicker, I also followed the previous posts and used salsa instead of taco sauce (try it with the pineapple salsa...great), this is the second time I've made this in 2 weeks....yum, yum...

Most of the family liked it.  It tastes better the next day as leftovers.  I used salsa instead of taco sauce and tasted good.  The shells did dry out in baking so add sauce to the bottom of the pan before you put the shells in.

Hubby and I loved this.  We even forgot to put sour cream on top, which we also like.  But they were good without.  I was liberal with the cream cheese... I'd say I used at least 4 ounces if not a little more.  Will be making these again!

TRY THIS! Great for weekends. Used Turkey Meat, replaced Taco Sauce with Salsa based on prior reviews. Ate with chips, not in tacos. Kids and Hubby loved it. Cooked a few shells with taco sauce and was more impressed with Medium Salsa (more flavor). Lightly covered bottom of pan with Salsa (no butter used)...kept shells moist w/flavor and used it when kids asked for extra Salsa..did not waste. Buy large Salsa for this reason. A Weekend Keeper!!

Yummy!!! We loved this recipe. I did make some alterations. To the meat mixture I added: 1t cumin, 1/2 c cheddar cheese and 1oz extra cream cheese. I put taco sause on the bottom of the pan to avoid sticking, used dorito's (really yummy!) and put extra taco sauce.

Very good!  Only concern is that several of the pasta shells broke while cooking, but luckily I only used 1 pound of beef so I didn't have enough to fill 20 shells anyway.  My kids really loved it!

My husband is the final word around here whether a new recipe gets to stay or must go.  He has declared this his favorite dish I have made in our 12 years of marriage.  I did add a little garlic salt to the meat, but I didn't stray far from the original recipe.

I thought this was really good. I used 2 pounds of ground hamburger and 8 ounces cream cheese. For the sauce I used a whole can of red enchilada sauce and almost a whole jar of hot taco sauce. I crushed up nacho cheese doritos for the tortilla chips. Very good but not that quick and easy to make after working 9 hours!!! Will make again on the weekend or try to make ahead of time and throw in the oven after work.

WOW!!!!! If I could, I would give this way more than 5 stars. This is now one of my favorite meals. I did change a few things. I used the full amount of chili powder and also added 1/2 a packet of toco seasoning,1/4-1/2 tsp of cajon seasoning, and 2oz extra of cream cheese. I placed a cup of toco seasoning on the bottom of the pan and a cup and 1/2 on the top of the shells. When I stuffed the shells, I also put some of the sprinkle cheese in the shells. (just enough to sprinkle the bottom of the shell)I also used about 3 or 4 cups of cheese to cover the top of the shells.

Fantastic recipe! My husband and I really enjoyed this. I did use the taco seasoning mix, Tex Mex chesse and salsa though. These ingredents were what I had on hand. I also used extra salsa as sugested buy other readers I probably trippled the amount. We topped it with sour cream, green onions, black a green olives slices and diced tomato, Yum! Next time we will try the reciepe as writen. This easily could be made  several different ways as someone sugested making it into a lasagne or using any other small shaped pasta and make it into a casserole I bet it could even been done in the slow cooker for a fast meal. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

This was the best. My kids love mexican and so it was a great change from the traditional. I accidentally added too much cream chees.(5oz too much) Still perfect. I added a bit of sourcream to the tops and made sure to follow everyones advice on putting taco sauce under the shells in the pan. My kids could not get enough. This one is a keeper.

My family enjoyed this dish a lot.  It's a great compromise: my kids love tacos for dinner, but my hubby doesn't find them filling enough.  The pasta in this dish bulks it up a bit.  Will make this one again.  I decided to use taco seasoning as someone else suggested, and ommitted the corn chips. I will be thinking about how I can reduce the sodium however, because it seemed a little too salty for my taste.

This was well received by my family.  As others suggested I subbed approx.  2-3 Tsp. taco seasoning for the chili powder and salt.  I also sprayed my pan with a nonstick spray and spread some taco sauce on the bottom before the shells to prevent sticking, which worked.  Served with sliced black olives, diced tomatoes, and sour cream.  Yum!

What a unique and decious idea. And like any other pasta dish it was even better the next day as leftovers! ! ! DELICIOUS. I got a little lazy and mixed some precooked spanish rice and a can of drained blackbeans to the mix.  Served with sour cream and guacamole salad. A new family favorite. THANKS.

Very delicious. I also changed the recipe around - a little more chili, a little more cream cheese. Must make it again :)

This was okay. I changed it up just a little. I left out the chili powder and made it with hot taco package. Then just added the cream cheese. I also put some taco sauce on the bottom of pan. I omitted the chips also. Cheese was just plenty. The family thought it was good.

This was a pretty good start, but it does need touching up.  I was not satisfied with the meat/ cream cheese/ chili powder mixtures.  It was kind of dry and not spicy enough for me.  I'll probably just use taco seasoning next time.  Another reviewer's idea of using manicotti instead of shells sounds good.  Additional taco sauce was required to cover the shells.  I will be adding rice and/ or refried beans next time.

I didn't have any taco sauce on hand, so I used taco seasoning mixed with water, well I should have known that'd be too watery, so my shells did leak a bit when cut to eat.  It was still good and next time I'd just make sure to use taco sauce and also my husband didn't like the tortilla chips baked on, he said he wants those on the side.  With some of the juice they got mushy.  First time using stuffed shells, next time I'd make a few extra just in case.

This is a great recipe.  Even my pickiest eater liked it. My only confusion was the 3 oz. package of cream cheese.  Do they make a 3 oz. package?  I ended up using 2/3 of an 8 oz. package.  Other than that, pretty simple recipe to follow and yummy!

Loved this!  Pasta AND the flavor and fixins of tacos in one recipe?...SOLD!  I used salsa instead of the taco sauce and, as suggested, a taco seasoning instead of the spices but mostly kept the recipe the same.  I topped with lettuce, chopped tomato, olives, and sour cream - perfecto!  Thanks for posting. =)

With five kids,it's hard to find something they all like.  This is one of those things that was not a problem!  I added taco seasoning to the hamburger like another reader suggested.  Each person added their own sour cream to their plate if they wanted it.  I have already recommended this recipe to several people!  Thanks!

Made this for 2 very fussy kids, and there were no leftovers!!!! I used a mild taco sauce. Also dices up some tomatoes, and shredded some lettuce to serve along side the sour cream and scallions that I topped the shells w/. Not the quickest to prepare - but well worth it. Fed 5 people no problem, w/ leftovers for lunch today.

I also used taco seasoning instead of the other spices.  I tasted the meat mixture before I stuffed the shells and decided it still needed something so I added a can of spicy chili beans with sauce.  I put the cheese on at the initial bake because I like it to get a little 'crusty' around the edges.  I think you can really tailor this one to your personal preferences without losing the 'idea' of the recipe.

Made this last night and both the hubby and I loved it! Took the suggestion of some reviews and added a can of Rotel to the meat, used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder & salt, and used salsa instead of the taco sauce.  Put a little chopped cilantro on top when it was done. YUMMY!  This is definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe! A new favorite. Can't express how much I loved it! I used taco seasoning instead of just chili powder, and Mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar and jack. I used enchilada sauce(because I love the stuff) in addition to the taco sauce. I omitted the tortilla chips (didn't have any) and honestly think I wouldn't have liked the crunch with this dish. Topped with green onions and served with refried beans.

This recipe is really simple and really delicious!  I used 1lb. ground turkey instead of beef, no salt, paprika instead of chili powder, and omitted the totilla chips.  I also added a little bit of the sour cream to the cream cheese and then mixed it in with the turkey because it was a little dry looking the first time I made it with just cream cheese.

This is a clever twist on Italian Stuffed Shells.  To modify for my non-meat eating daughter, I substituted in refried beans and crumbled tofu.  I also used a package of taco seasoning mix as other reviewers have suggested.  Really good, especially with the added toppings at the end.  Easy, tasty, and freezes well, too.

This is pretty good, not phenomenal. I have already made this out of my One Dish Bible cookbook years ago. Kind of hard to mix the cream cheese and beef, although I love both so it's a great idea. Pretty messy too, but I enjoy the concept.

Really yummy. I substituted 2 T taco seasoning for the salt and chili powder. I used an entire 16 oz bottle of medium taco sauce. Update: I sub medium shells for the Jumbo shells and combine the ingredients rather than stuffing the shells. I serve the pasta bake with crumbled chips instead of cooking them on top. I often sub lean ground turkey for the beef.

This recipe was good. I changed a few things. I added chopped greens chiles, chopped onion, and taco seasoning to the meat. It gave it really good flavor. I did not use the chili powder and I used a whole bottle of taco sauce to make is more saucy.  It turned out very well. Will definately make again.

These were pretty good. I wish that I would have added taco seasoning to the beef like others suggested. I've made a similar recipe before that I liked better. The amount of filling was perfect for 18 shells, but I would have preferred to make some more and filled up the entire 9X13 pan, as I had a lot of open space.

I made this dish, but changed a few ingredients to make it healthier. I used 2oz. low fat cream cheese added a half a packet taco seasoning and 3/4 cup black beans and cut the beef back to just under a pound and browned it with onion. My husband loved it.  Next time I think I would add a whole packet of taco seasoning.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I  changed some things. . .I doubled the cream cheese and used taco seasoning instead of cumin.  I also added 1/2 cup of water because others had complaied that it was dry. I also added chopped black olives into the shells before baking the last 15 minutes. I lined the baking dish with salsa  and these were great!  We topped with a dollop of sour cream and when they were cooled a little bit- we ate them with our fingers. . .i kno i know- we're slobs.  But they were yummy!  My hubby loved!!!

I used a taco seasoning packet in with the browned beef instead of the taco sauce.  And I've made it without any sour cream before as well to cut down on the fat.  It was still really good!

Very good dish.  I liked the fact that it was simple and hardly any dishes to clean up.

After reading other reviews, I modified the original recipe a tad. Skipped the salt/chili powder & opted for taco seasoning. Skipped the butter on the pasta. Family loved it!

These were excellent!  The only change we made was using ground turkey instead.  Couldn't stop eating them!

Like many other reviewers, I added salsa at the bottom of my pan and used taco seasoning instead of the spices (thanks other reviewers!).  Additionally, I added a diced onion to the meat.  This turned out pretty good.  I'm not sure about the shells, though.  It was...novel.  But I'm not sure why you wouldn't use soft tortillas and make this like enchiladas.  The shells were at best interesting, but they really didn't add anything to the dish.  The filling was really delicious and I'll definitely use this recipe in the future for enchiladas.  Thanks!

Very good.  Unique flavor.  Instead of using tomato sauce I poured about 1 cup of salsa over top of shells.  I also used taco seasoning packet w/water in beef just like when making tacos. My shells were not dry at all.

This is really good.  Even my kids loved it.  Definitely will make again.  I also used taco seasoning instead of the other seasonings.

I was in a hurry & did not want to stuff shells, so I used medium shells & blended the meat mixture & pasta all together - my family preferred it this way.

I used Lawyry's Hot taco pkg & 8 oz of taco sauce & doubled the amt of cream cheese. Topped it off with a dollop of sour cream - Yummy!

Surprisingly good for a seemingly strange idea... I used the hot taco sauce and that gave it a nice bite. I'll make it again...

This is an overall family rating for my notes.  My husband did not like the textures of taco meat with pasta.

Interesting, tasty recipe with a great flavor! I double the cream cheese and reduce the final bake time to 5 minutes to reduce drying out the pasta. We were skeptical but ended up being pleasantly surprised. Thanks Granny!

My husband thought this dish was really good, I thought there was something lacking in it. I was good but could be better somehow. The recipe adds at the bottom to top with onion which is not listed with the ingredients. Do top it with the onion, it adds flavor and extra crunch. Perhaps some black olive on it would be tasty as well.

This was actually quite tasty and something I will most likely make again at some point.  I added a 4oz can of somewhat spicy diced green chiles (along with the cream cheese, etc.) and it was great.  I also didn't have any taco sauce, so I used a basic red spaghetti sauce and seasoned it with chile powder.  I didn't add the crushed tortilla chips but I thought it was fine without them.  All in all this was a fun recipe to make (I've always wanted to stuff some of those jumbo shells) and it makes for exacelltn leftovers as well - I swear it tasted better when I finished it off the next day!  Thanks for sharing the recipe...
