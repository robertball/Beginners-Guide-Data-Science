I used 2 cups of water, and substituted honey for the sugar. Now I no longer need to go to the Indian restaurants to get my lassi fix. Thanks.
Oh, by the way, my toddler gulped it down!

Pretty good.  Make sure to get a ripe mango.  Other recipes suggest adding cumin (a pinch of roasted, ground seeds) or cardamom (1/4 tsp).  Don't try to dilute with milk--it muddies the mango taste.  Add water, seltzer, or vodka.  I added half the recommended sugar and it was fine.  I'm glad she said to take the seed out.  It makes an awful racket in the blender.

Too watery. The water measurement is incorrect. It ends up diluting all the taste of the mango.

I really wanted to make a mango lassi just like the ones in the Indian restaurants, and this turned out wonderfully.  I do have to caution that some of the fibrous mango strings may not blend completely, but it is still a great drink!

This smoothie is very good if you are a mango lover. I added more honey for flavor.

Too watery!! My kinda lassi has no water at all, it turns out like a creamy smooth, thick mango smoothie.People who like it that way can completely omit the water.And about the mango strings, strain the mango through a seive. As some of the others suggested, do get a very ripe and non-soury mango. For those who do not have access to mangoes, indian and chinese stores carry cans of alphonso mango pulp, which works just as good. 
For a creamier treat, you can add whipped cream, turns out really thick almost like a shake.

There was too much water required.  I only used 2 cups and it was still too watery.  I also think it might be better with mango nectar versus the ripe mangos.  This recipe captures the essence, but needs a lot of tweeking to get it right.

Good!  I reduced this to make 1 serving (a big one) as follows.  1 small mango, 3/4 cup yogurt, 1 cup water, and 1 teaspoon sugar.  Blending it all.  Yum!  Healthy too.

Don't add water!! I use Goya brand frozen Mango pulp which is cheaper and tastes better to me. i usually add a little condensed milk or even better, sweetened condensed milk..then you don't have to add sugar!! i make these almost every day.

This was absolutely delicious!  Instead of the white sugar, I added 1/2 cup mango nectar.  This intensified the mango taste.

I agree with what others are saying; the recipe calls for way too much water. I ended up doubling the recipe and I'm glad that I reviewed some of the other comments before I did, because six cups of water would have been ridiculous! I only ended up using one and half cups of water, and it still tasted a little too watery for my taste. Overall, this was an okay recipe, but it definitely needs tweaking.

Really good!!! Just make sure you really puree the mangos if you use fresh because they are fibrous.

I love mangos, so this recipe was excellent to me. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because is way too much water, I suggest reducing the water to the concistency desired, I used less than half of the amount stated on the recipe. I used extra frozen mango, and used a little splenda instead of sugar. I think these changes made a nice and thick concistency.

Wasn't very fond of it at all but it might be due to the soy yogurt.

I used to work for an Indian resturant. They used mango pulp. Using the pulp is the trick to not making this like a juice drink. You can buy pulp at any Indian grocery store. Some people even say using the mango itself ruins the drink.

Very good!! I was looking for something to do with a leftover mango I had.And came across this recipe. My cousin owned an Indian restaurant and I remembered loving those 'Mango Lassis', and seeing this recipe.. I decided to try it.
I didn't have a plain yogurt but an apricot-mango one. It turned out fine, I didn't use the amount of water in the recipe, I just eyeballed it so that it reached the consistency I wanted. Will definitively do that again. This wk end if I can, so my hubby can taste it ;)..
