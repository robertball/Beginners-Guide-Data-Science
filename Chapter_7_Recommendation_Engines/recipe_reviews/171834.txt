Don't bother. The cinnamon is so overpowering that its all you taste. Pretty one dimensional. Plus, its too confusing to your pallet. I kept tasting apple pie spices but trying to make it right on the meat. It didn't work.

This is a really good starting point. I didnt measure anything. I used my judgement as to how much I wanted of each spice and went from there. It turned out great! I used it as a rub for some gyros and it was delicious. I still have some left over to use again.

The critical review (by TinHouston) and the positive one (by ak04) were both very helpful.  My favorite Mediterranean place shut down and I have always wondered what spices they used for their meat and veggies.  I made sauteed veggies (onions, tomatoes and bell peppers). I took the reviewers' advice and didn't measure, being careful to go very light on the cinnamon and nutmeg and I was amazed that it turned out just like the restaurant!  I am giving this 4 stars because I haven't tried the exact recipe measurements.  If I try the recipe quantities, I'll update my review.

**UPDATE:** I'm sorry but I have to bring my rating down. The quantities in this recipe are WAAAY off- the flavor exactly as TinHouston described it.  Glad I only wasted an onion instead of adding it to the meat. The ingredients are good- just not the quantities. I can't remember exactly how much I put last time, but I'd recommend equal portions of cumin & coriander (1 tsp each), salt and pepper to taste and just a pinch or max of 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon & nutmeg.

The cinnamon was overwhelming in this recipe. It made the meat really dry.
