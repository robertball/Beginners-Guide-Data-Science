I used chickpeas instead of Black beans, added salt, an egg, and a teaspoon of vanilla, including all other ingredients, except regular cocoa powder and semisweet choc chips (nothing vegan). Blended all together and folded in choc chips. So delish!!!

I made this twice, once with eggs and once without. The first time without eggs and as directed and I did throw it out. The consistency was bad... Even though I cooked it for extra time it just seemed like uncooked batter. 

The 2nd time we made it with eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla and I also added 1/4 C extra sugar. That time it was ok, a fine gluten free alternative, but not as good as my mom's brownie recipe. I might try it once more without the baking powder or soda and I would try purring the beans longer to see if it could be improved.
