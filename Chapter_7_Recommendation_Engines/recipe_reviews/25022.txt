I tried this recipe and the taste was very good but mine kept spreading and the edges were very crisp.  I don't know what I did wrong.  Did anyone else have this problem with this recipe?

Neither my roommate nor myself were impressed with this recipe.   I found that the cookies did not reflect the "chewy-ness" as stated in the title, lacked the normal oatmeal cookie consistency, and were quite dry.

I'm a terrible cookie maker.  But I had all these ingredients on hand so I gave them a try.  They turned out great!  The didn't spread, were chewy as described, and delicious!  I just might give baking cookies another try.  These gave me some confidence!

This recipe was a huge success!...I made them with white chocolate chips and crushed up macadamia nuts also i put a little bit less of the flour since some reviews complained about cakiness...anyway my boyfriend loved them and when he brought them to work,they dissapeared before he even settled in...when I got there, they were all fighting over the last one!  Def. a great recipe! Thank you

It is often very difficult to find an oatmeal cookie recipe that holds together and makes a chewy cookie.  This one did exactly as its title suggested.  My only advice is to make sure that you make the cookies small or change your temperature and time or you are bound to end up with undercooked cookies.  I am allergic to raisins and had no nuts, so made them with M&M's instead and they went over very well with my family.

Good taste. For those of you who were having trouble with them spreading too much, try using an ungreased cookie sheet instead of a greased one as the recipe calls for. I used a greased sheet for the first batch and got thin cookies that ran together and were crunchy at the edges. No greasing on the second try and they came out perfect.

I made these cookies and they tasted very good. I did add a bit more cinnamon to them though, which made me enjoy them much more. :-)

OMG!! I made these cookies last week for a friend at works birthday since Oatmeal cookies are his favourite. Well he said these are the BEST he has ever tasted!! He would not even share them with the others we work with..LOL! 
I used butter instead of the flavoured shortening, and baked on parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet, and had no trouble with the spreading that others reported. I also doubled the cinnamon because it just did not seem like 1/4 teaspoon would be enough. Since making them both my family and co-worker have asked me to make more....almost every day! This is a definite keeper!!

I found that these cookies stayed moist, and cooked all the way through, by letting them rest in the oven after the cooking time was over.

DELICIOUS!  I give both this and my modified version 5 stars.  I use these to increase breast milk when I nurse my little ones, but I add 1/2 cup flax meal and up the cinnamon and vanilla to 1 tablespoon and exchange the shortening for margarine.  Add the walnuts and raisins as you like, or omit them all together.  I prefer my oatmeal cookies naked.

It's so good, I want to eat the dough!  Speaking of, it helps to chill the batter some first (about 4 hours), so they don't spread out as much.

Carol Bradley- you hit this one out of the park!

Loved these cookies, I used a #24 cookie scoop and I got well over 50 LARGE cookies. The only problem that I had, that no one else mentioned, was my cookies stuck to the foil. I used parchment paper on the next batch and they came right off. I also only put 6 on the baking sheet, after my first 12 ran together and I got square cookies. They were picture perfect, and TASTED even better.

I loved these cookies, and so did everyone who sampled them. Very easy to make and many substitutions are possible (I put chocolate chips and pecans in my cookies, since that's what I had on hand). I'll definitely make these cookies again!

Things to consider however : 1. to avoid cookie de-shaping add baking powder instead of baking soda. It will rise and not expand. 2. You can use vegetable oil instead of butter/shortening etc. 3. You must use ungreased pan/sheet to avoid a cookie de-shaping. 4. Instead of vanilla extract USE cardamom powder, it gives fresh taste to the cookie. 
I made these and IT all rocked. BAKED cookies first time! Baking is a science so use proper measurements.

I made some really tasty chocolate chip cookies the other day that my boyfriend and I loved! We wanted to try some oatmeal cookies so I used this recipe. I followed it to the "t" and the didn't turn out so hot. They taste great but they turned out to be flat pancakes stuck together.

Cookies spread and were not chewy like I thought.  I also thought the recipe needed some salt.  I have a half batch left that I am going to try to bake at 325 to see if that makes a difference in spreading,

I followed it to the point and it ended up the worst I've ever done! I've never used milk before and I think that's what did it, but they came out flat, sticky more like a cereal texture!

Mine came out bland even though I added chocolate chips, coconut and sugar. I did have to add wee bit more flour (1/4 cup) because I live at a higher altitude, so the the consistency was right.

These cookies had a great taste, and remained chewy even after 4 days. I made only a couple of changes. I used 1/4 cup coconut oil, and 1/2 cup softened butter. I increased the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon, and could have used more. The batter was very thick, and even when baked didn't spread as I expected it to. This may be because I let them sit on the counter for a little over an hour before I baked them. This would give the dry ingredients more time to absorb the liquid. For the first pan, I flattened them a bit after they started baking because the dough was still in a ball after they were more than half baked. For the second pan, I flattened them before I put them into the oven. I baked them for 12 minutes to get them to brown a little. After they cooled, I put them into a plastic bag, and 4 days later they were still moist and chewy. I will definitely make these again.

I used Craisins and almonds!  These are wonderful.  Make 2 batches because the first one will be gone in no time!

I was bored and decided to bake cookies and I absolutely LOVE this recipe! They turned out exactly as I imagined them. I replaced the butter/shortening with margaring, only 1/2 cup of walnuts and 1 cup of dried cranberries instead of raisins! They turned out awesome. Definitely going to bake them again soon!

Yummy! I used chocolate chips instead of nuts and raisins. I thought they cooked well and were easy to make. Thanks!

Edible, but nothing I would try to give to anyone.  I wouldn't want them to think this was my recipe.  Like an earlier review, mine spread out on the edges with a lump for a cookie in the center.  Not the consistency of the photo that goes with this recipe.  Will try a different cookie recipe to get a more consistent thickness with chewiness next time. Bummer I wasted the ingredients it took to make this recipe.
