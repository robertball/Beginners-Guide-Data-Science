Sometimes when I see a negative review, I think, oh they must have done something wrong, or it just wasn't what they were looking for, but this time I must agree 100% with "cheer4us".  I followed the recipe exactly and the crisp is way too thin in a 9x13.  I can't even get the bottom unstuck from the pan and the syrup just has a weird flavor, nothing mapley or buttery or anything.  WILL NOT MAKE THIS AGAIN AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND!

This recipe was one of the best and is definatley a keeper! instead of dividing the crumbly topping in 1/2 i made two batches (one for the bottom and one for the top) make sure APPLES are golden brown when you take it out. Very moist and delicious (Granny smith apples 1/8 slices)

Ugh...bad texture, bad flavor, and the sauce is un-needed.  Just make the crust, put down some apples, sprinkle on the crust and cook it in a deep pan.  Probably a 8 by 8 is best.  I do not recomend this version of a perfectly good dessert.

Ok, I'm happy to report that this went over really well after my alterations that I made.  I found it helpful from the other users to know to add more flour to have more of the crumble mixture on top.  This was at a Good Friday Fish Fry( at our community native centre)and as I was serving it onto plates to be brought out to our guests, I was asked to come out to this one table as they wanted to speak to the person who made the apple crisp.  I went out, a little nervous and was told by all 5 women at that table that not only was this the best APPLE CRISP they had ever tasted, but one of the women actually wants to know if I'd be interested in making a few more and she would purchase them from me.  WOW!!  Wasn't quite expecting THAT!!  they said it wasn't too rich, they could tell that I had cut back on the sugars and that the quantity of what I used was perfect!!  They loved the crunchy, caramelly crust that was on the top and on the bottom.  

Oh...one more thing that I did differently from the original recipe...I cranked up the heat at the last 15 mins to brown it up a bit and create that crunchy coating and bottom...because it forced the syrup up to the top to mix with the butter on top to create a caramel topping.  

Exellent Recipe to start off with, just needed a few tweakings!!

Thank you!!

I'm eating this apple crisp right now, and it is just amazing! I took some liberties with the sauce, like using 1/4 C. brown and 1/4 C. white sugar instead of all white sugar, using apple cider instead of water, and 1/2 tsp. each vanilla and maple extracts instead of just vanilla. It turned out to be absolutely incredible! I served it with premium vanilla ice cream and the sauce spooned over the ice cream. Definitely a winner that I'll be making again!

I personally love crisps anyway but it is apple time in michigan and this recipe helped make a yummy dessert. I used jonagolds because I think that they bake well and have a pretty decent flavor and of course they are fresh. I followed the recipe except for using an 8x8 pan which I like because the crust and topping are perfect (9x13 would be too thin in my opinion). Do spray the pan please. I used 3 large apples and did add walnuts to the top because frankly I love nuts and they seem to make everything just a little better. Baked for about 50 min and served with french vanilla ice cream. Was yummy. The one thing I can say is that I don't think a little extra cinnamon would hurt and maybe the next time I make it I'd use a granny smith for one of the other apples. Oh and always always use real butter... YUM Thanks

My quest for great apple crisp, which has been a long and frustrating one, is over!
This recipe is incredible! 
I made two changes based solely on family preference. I used a 8x8 pan rather than a 13x9 since my family likes thicker apple crisp. I also used 1C. oatmeal insted of the 3/4C. as the recipe directs.
Thank you Cheri for submitting this recipe and making every member of my household very happy!

This recipe only deserves my five star rating when adjusted. I doubled the syrup and the crumble. When I tried it the first time the recipe was very good but there was too much cinnamon. So I adjusted the recipe to 1/2-3/4 teasp. cinnamon. Cooking time only took 35 minutes not 45. MUST TRY: Serve ap. Crisp warm with vanilla ice cream.

This was a wonderful crowd pleasing dessert for our SB party.  A few changes:  I doubled the crumb mixture, used 6 large G.Smith apples (was a bit more that the 6 cups needed)and added 1 tsp almond extract to the sugar/cornstarch sauce. The extra apple or 2 is needed to fill a 9x13 pan.  It turned out great and it's a keeper!

I didnt put the crumble in the bottom of the dish for fear it would be mushy. Added a pinch of salt to the sauce for depth of flavour.  Drizzled a tbs fresh lemon juice over the apples & sprinkled with cinnamon & nutmeg before putting all the crumble (crisp) on top, of which I added chopped walnuts to (Its a Canuck thing). Fabulous & my mid-west hubby even said "YUMM" which is no easy feat. Highly recommend this recipe.

I gave this recipe a 4* rating because I had to adjust it to work for me. I doubled the crumble and syrup topping and I had to cut up 3 granny smith apples for an 8X8 pan size. I won a 2nd place rosette in the wheat-a-thon in my town (I used whole wheat instead of all purpous flour.) out of quite a few people. This recipe is very adaptable and YUMMY! After I had adjusted it, I would have given it a 10* rating!

Served this over the weekend when we had guests.  Everybody loved it and we had a little bit left over for breakfast the next morning.  I did double the "crisp" part so we had plenty on the top and bottom.  Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing Cheri!

AWESOME!!  A co-worker of mine gave me some apples from her tree, and I made this recipe.  I wasn't too kean on placing any of the crumble on the bottom, so I pilled it all on top.  I did double the recipe and used a 13x9 pan....I brought this to work, and couldn't beleive the comments I got.  Everybody loved it, wanted the recipe and asked me to make it again.  I loved it!!  The crumble on top was nice and crunchy, just the way I like it!  This is a keeper!!

This turned out great!  Moist, tasty, not too sweet, perfect flavor.  I am definately making this one again!!  Also...I have doubled the crisp portion and used a smaller pan.  Also, insted of the "drizzle" I just mix the apples with the sugar, vanilla, and a bit more cinnamon to make it a little easier.

I made this recipe with a friend after spending an afternoon at the orchard hand-picking our apples.  I didn't make any modifications to the ingredients or the assembly, and the crisp turned out so great (the caramel sauce is the key) that my husband never even got to try it!  I might try making this recipe in an 11x7 dish next time to make the crisp thicker since it seemed kind of spread out in the 9x13 pan, but this would only be for aesthetics.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - it was easy and tasted great and I will be making it again!

Great recipe but a tad bit sweet so all you need to do is cut down the sugar a bit in both the topping and the apple mixture. The topping is fantastic so it's best to make double the amount so you don't have to be chintzy with is.  Also, be sure to remember to cook the syrup first. It makes a huge difference vs. forgetting to cook it like I have done a few times. I also added a bit a cinnamon to the apple mixture because it just taste better. Highly recommend this one.

This is a GREAT recipe. I will always keep it. One thing is that when I baked this in the oven, it would always look too dry. I had to keep on taking it out, adding water, and putting the crisps back in. Still a 5-star recipe, though

I've been searching for a special crisp recipe for a while...I will look no further!  This crisp was AMAZING!  Only additions were a pinch of nutmeg to the syrup and some Apple Sprinkle (Pampered Chef) on the top.  I think it would be a bit thin in a 9x13 so I used my round baker (also P. Chef) but a 9x9 would be fine too. We did not find it too sweet at all.  I used Granny Smith apples and hubby said it was a delicious contrast.

I would recommend doubling the apples and tossing with cinnamon before adding them to the crisp.  It was great, but needed to have more apples.

My husband didn't even finish his serving when he said this is absolutly fantastic and to put this on the "favorites" to make again!  I highly suggest to double the recipe to put in a 9x13 dish.  Otherwise use a 9x9 or 8x8.  I read the reviews when mine was in the oven, otherwise I would have doubled mine.  If you can't rate this 5 stars...then something was done wrong.  It is absolutly devine!!!

This is the best apple crisp recipe ever!  I've never had a problem with sweetness because I always use Granny Smiths and it always comes out perfect!  I've never altered anything, well, except I really don't measure out exactly how many apples I put in,  I add a bit of nutmeg for smell, and I do cook it in a 8x8 pan because I prefer it to be thicker. Other than that, it is definitely NOT dry and is not runny either.  Wonderful!

Delicious! I did have to change the recipe though. This was not enough for a 9x13 pan. I made it in a 8x10. Next time I will definitely double the crumb part. I love more crumb topping.

This was my first attempt at making apple crisp.  I followed one reviewer and doubled the bottom/topping crumble mixture.  It worked out GREAT!!  My family loved it, as did I. I'm making it again and would recommend increasing the crumble amount.

This was a great apple crisp recipe! My mother, who doesn't usually like apple crisp, ate some and loved it. I agree with one reviewers comment about using less sugar, I'll try that next batch. I also used a 9x9 in. pan and made the syrup mixture in the microwave. I used a glass liquid measuring cup, putting in the water, then adding the cornstarch, sugar, and vanilla. Mixed it all up and microwaved it for 2 minutes. It came out perfectly and I just drizzled it over the apples. I love apple crisp and was so pleased this recipe turned out so well! Thank you for sharing!!

I love this recipe....I however inadvertently left out the sugar, corn starch and water sauce....that would have been much better, to keep it more moist....however, with just the crust and the apples it was delicious and not too dry at all....very good!

This was really good, the only thing I did differently is that I only put the crumble on top because I feared it would turn to mush, I would make this again.

This was tastey.  I doubled the oatmeal crumble because that is my families favorite part.  I cooked it in a cast iron pan and I also put about 1 1/2 dozen caramel candies on top of the apples.

I *loved* this recipe!! I made it for a dinner I catered, so I think I quadrupled the recipe. I served it fresh from the oven with vanilla ice cream (and soy ice cream). I modified it to be vegan-friendly and it was still delicious. My only complaint was that it stuck to the bottom of the pan pretty bad, but I was also using those cheap foil throw-away pans. That was probably the problem. Next time I would use my own glass pan and be sure to coat it with cooking spray. But this was really fabulous and I can't wait to make it again. Thank you!!

Oh yes!  Mmmmmmm! I have made a simple apple crisp for years - apples tossed with cinn. & sugar, topped with a buttery oatmeal mixture.  Good but not nearly as yummy as this recipe! This one is very simple and quick to make (after you spend alot of time peeling & slicing the darn apples!). The crust on the bottom is slightly soggy as compared to the upper crust but it does not detract from the quality of this crisp. The syrup poured over the apples is just what they need to become moist & gooey! The crust on top is superb! Crispy & flavorful.  Lovely.  I doubled all of the ingredients and put it in my large ceramic Emily Henry lasagna pan - the pan is not that much larger than 13x9 and so my crisp became a "deep dish" crisp.  I love it that way.  I highly recommend making this.  I have an apple tree in my backyard and I made this from the imperfect apples that fell onto the ground.  I just peeled them and cut out the bruises and voila, no one could tell these apples were beat up.  One thing that some folks might not like, is that this crisp is on the sweet side. Now, I like that - the sweeter the better for me - but some people might like it to be more tart and less gooey & sweet.  I guess you could reduce the amount of syrup to lessen the sugar but in that case, you should just find another recipe! This one is ooey gooey good sweet and delicious! It's a keeper!

Was in the mood for the fall season, this recipe was just what I had in mind.  Very easy, very good.  It's a "keeper" for sure with my family.  I drizzled caramel sauce over the crisp while still warm, made it even better.  Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW! This recipe is the best I have ever made. I did "tweak" it a bit the second time, using apple juice instead of water in the syrup, and using a generous handful of Hershey's cinnamon chips over the apples. I also cut up some Kraft Caramels in small pieces and added them to the top layer...voila! Caramel Apple Crisp. I made a caramel sauce with some light cream and the rest of the caramels to pour over...just SINFUL. Thanks for the recipe!

This is very similar to the apple crisp recipe I usually use and could not locate today. Has that great oatmeal topping. Two people stopped by and had to have some while they were here! I made a 8x8 pan because it is best fresh in my opinion.

I needed to make something with the 10 lbs of apples I picked up at my father-in-law's tree. I followed the recipe but doubled it and cooked it in a 9X13 pan. It smelt great while it was cooking. Ate it the next day after warming it up. It was pretty sweet. It tasted even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. If I make it again, I would cut the sugars down since the apples are naturally sweet.

Excellent, listened to other reviewers and baked in an 8 x 8 pan and this turned out very tasty. I will be making this one again for sure! Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought it turned out very yummy!  I did follow others advice and doubled the crust.  I also added more apples but did not increase the liquids.  It was very flavorable and gave the taste of fall with every bite!

This was delicious!! I added a half tsp. maple extract along with the vanilla, and used apple juice instead of water. My entire family loved it! It was almost like a chewy oatmeal cookie with apples.Yum!(I also doubled the crust/topping mixture.)

I'm not a fan of cooked apple anything... until I made this!!! I love this! I like how the apples are a little crunchy, not soggy. When I make this I don't add a bottom crust. I use all of the crumble for the top! I love a thick layer! I also make this recipe in a 8x8. When I make it in a 9x13 I double the recipe.  I serve this with homemade Cinnamon Ice Cream!! Yummy!!

This was good but I prefer my cookbook recipe on this one! I, sadly, made the mistake of not peeling my apples not knowing the importance of doing so. I thought it would add more fiber, you know? Well, it was weird. The texture of the apples did not go well with the less-friendly texture of the peels. Lesson learned, I bought an apple peeler/corer/slicer too.

This recipe was great, my family loved it, but DOUBLE IT if you're going to make it.  It is way too thin for a 9x13 in. pan.

I followed the advice of some of the reviews and doubled the crumble mixture and halved the sugar. I added some extra cinammon, used whole wheat flour and it was divine!!  smells great while baking too!  definitely a keeper.

This could've been better if I had followed directions. I didn't peel my apples, trying to keep a little fiber in the dish but the peels didn't soften.  I also used slow cooking oats because that's what I had and it didn't meld as well with the rest of the "crisp".

Oh how yummy!  Made exact to recipe- didn't seem too sweet as some people mentioned so I'm glad I didn't reduce the sugar- but maybe I just have a sweet tooth- ;)  Nothing more to say but we were very happy with it!  Will try it with granola sometime as someone suggested because I looooove granola. We served it hot with vanilla ice cream.

Very yummy!  I made a few changes.  I used a smaller size casserole dish, put all the apples on bottom and the crumb stuff on top.  Threw in a handful of cranberries too.  Instead of making the sauce using water and sugar, I used a 1/2 cup of apple juice and cornstarch.  Also subbed some whole wheat flour for white and added some more cinammon.  It was delicious!

This is the best apple recipe I have ever cooked.  Do spray the pan gernerously with pam so it won't stick so much.  I did make it in a smaller pan so it was thicker and it turned out wonderfully.

I gave this recipe a rating of five because I have used it on two seperate occasions for PTA functions.  Both times I have been told how wonderful it is and that it was the best apple crisp they ever tasted(Including the school cafeteria manager who has been cooking for over thirty years).

Outstanding recepie.  Has won a family bake-off, in a family of bakers.  A couple of additions, however, I agree with previous reviewers that the crumb mixture should be doubled, but also, in the liquid, try cutting the white sugar to 1/3 C and adding 1 T of dark molasses and a dash of nutmeg.  Can't go wrong with this recepie.

First, ty for posting this recipe. I have this one, and have it for years. I can't find it and needed it the other day! I altered it a little....I don't. Cook the sauce as long, use extra apples, and before you put the topping on...I sprinkle more brown sugar and cinnamon on the apples themselves. I always add more oats..but that's my preference. Thank you again for posting this wonderful recipe!

I just made this. I made 1/2 the recipe, but a little more of the crumb topping, and I liked it but thought it was a bit too sweet. My my husband and daughter,loved it and my neighbor loved it. I also made home-made whipped cream. Would definitely be better served warm. I had Gala Apples, would do it again with Granny Smith, and maybe just a little less sugar.

increased recipe 50% and used same size pan and baked about 10 min longer; used cooking apples. Outcome use good but a little dry; next time will double the water quantity. I agree with the 4 0; 5.0 if not so dry. I imagine it deoends on type of apples used.

Nice recipe but I think the proportions are a bit off. Also since you use half of the crumble on the bottom, it means there's not quite enough for the top.

Absolutely WONDERFUL!  My husband doesn't like apple desserts and also agreed that this is great.  The only change i made was by using maple and brown sugar oatmeal instead of the rolled oats.

I was running a little short on brown sugar so I used half white and half brown for the oat mixture I also accidentally put in a whole teaspoon vanilla instead of a half but this recipe turned out great. My 4yr old just loved it. It was a little more involved than I would like an apple crisp to be but was well worth the effort.

This was the best apple crisp i have ever had. I did have to double the crust though so it would cover everything. Everything else i did exactly as directed and it was fabulous!

I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect.  No need to alter a thing!  I'll try this with peaches and blueberries when they come into season next year! Thanks for a great classic recipe!

I solved the watery issues we all seemed to have - you need to add more flour to the apple mix.  I baked this in an 8x8 pan using the same quantity of topping mix as the origional recipie but used 5 cups (4 cut-up) apples, added 1 1/2 tbs of flour,and 1/4 cup apple juice instead of water to the apple mix. Then baked it for 50 minutes. Excellent.

This apple crisp recipe is the best especially if you like lots of crumble.  It is easy to make in large batches, and it freezes and thaws well.  This is the only apple crisp recipe I use now.

This should be the definitive apple crisp recipe for allrecipes.com. It tastes exactly like apple crisp should taste. I prepared it "as is" and wouldn't change anything. I bought some caramel and used it as topping. Mmmm!

I halved this recipe and used an 8x8 pan.  Additionally, added a small amount of water to the apples (which I mixed with the cinnamon and sugar separately).  Easter dinner dessert, and can't keep family's fingers out of it!

I have made this recipe twice now and it got better! This time I added a fresh pear sliced and it adds something really tasty to the recipe.I did not use any crumble mixture for a bottom crust either. I dumped it all on top and it went over well. My coworkes had the pan cleaned out in no time. I also used a glass dish larger than a 9x9 but smaller than a 9x13.  Worked very well.

This recipe was very easy to make and very tasty. I used an 8x8 inch square pan with 4 large apples. I will make this again but I will reduce the sugar slightly because it was a little too sweet for me.

By far NOT the best...but has potential. I would definitely double the apples & syrup/sauce for a 9 x 13 cake pan. The crumble on the bottom isn't completely necessary. I think it's too much of a good thing. Be sure to spray the pan with cooking spray before assembly.

I love this Apple Crisp recipe.  It is the best one that I have tried.  Once, I forgot to make the syrup and it turned out fine as well.  I always use Granny Smith apples since they are so tart.  With Granny Smith, the recipe is not too sweet.  It goes great with vanilla ice cream.

Excellent taste.  Takes a tad longer to put together but well worth the extra effort.  A nice variation to the regular Apple Crisp recipe that I have made for years.

To make a 9x13 pan, I used 5 large Granny Smith apples and doubled all other ingredients except sugars. As some reviewers stated, it was too sweet so I decreased the sugars by about 1/3rd.  It still turned out waaaayyyy to sugary for us.  Also, I've made apple crisp before, but never with the stovetop stirring method.  I found this time-consuming (I have 3  very young kids!).  I baked the whole dish for an extra 5 mins to brown the top.  Still not much "crisp".  Thank goodness we had vanilla ice cream, it tasted very good on top.  Unsure if I'd make it again.  Giving 4 stars because it was very tasty warm over ice cream.

Delicious!  Instead of apples I used 2 pints fresh blackberries and two cups canned diced peaches (fresh weren't available).  My whole family enjoyed it.  I used Splenda Brown Sugar to reduce calories and it was still scrumptious!

Very nice - I made mine leaving the peels on (since I have a little handheld tool that slices and cores at the same time, but doesn't peel).  I used more apples, though, since I needed to get rid of some.

This was great for my apple pie loving husband. We are always in search of a good store or retaurant bought apple pie with little success. This was easy and much better then anything you can buy. Especially good still warm with vanilla ice cream.

Now my favourite recipe for company.  Everybody loves it and looks forward to it.  I use 1 cup each of oatmeal, brown sugar and flour.   I also cook it for 1 hour and serve it warm and it is to die for.

I can't give this five stars only because I don't love baked apples, but this double-crusted version of apple crisp is probably the best I've had. I made one and a half times the amount of topping, but I guess I spread it too thickly on the bottom of the pan because there wasn't enough to cover the apples completely on top. I covered it for the first half of the 45 min. to keep the apples from drying out. Next time I'll probably double the topping. I used Braeburn apples just because they were on sale and it turned out great.

This was okay.  Husband did not like it. Too much crust and it ended up being hard to get out of pan (very sticky). Definitely needs more apples or something to provide more of a liquid base. Maybe I did something wrong with all the great reviews?

Very good.  Took some of the "too sweet" comments and reduced sugar and it was still very tasty.  Also reduced the pan size to make the servings more hearty.  Will make again with/without changes

I'm glad I read the reviews before I made this because with a couple of little changes it turned out great.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, put all the crumble on top and used a 11x7 baking dish.  It was a delicious way to use up some apples that were a bit soft.

To tell the truth, I did like this recipe. Made it in an 8x8 square pan but used the rest of the proportions as instructed.  The syrup for the apples turned out great though if you want a stronger taste of vanilla I'd increase the amount of essence in it by 1/4-1/2 teaspoon. Try it with only 1/2 a teaspoon first though.

My major whim with this recipe is that the topping was insanely sweet. Admittedly I'm a sweet tooth, though perhaps not the most diehard, but 1 cup of sugar is seriously too much in my, and my family's, tastebuds' opinion.  Try cutting down the amount of brown sugar to somewhere between 1/2-3/4 of a cup (maybe more to the 1/2 side).

This is a fabulous recipe!  I made it for Weds. night supper at church and ran out.  Everyone wants the recipe.  I think for the topping next time though, I will cut the butter into the brown sugar, flour and oats.  I'm thinking it would be more of a crumble that way.  But it is great as it is.

I've never made apple crisp before, and this was a resounding success! It was easy to make and was well-received by all who tried it. Just be sure to use an 8x8 pan.

My husband told me three times how good this was!  Just like his Grandma's...  I followed the recipe exactly (using Granny Smith apples), but used a 9 inch round pan sprayed with cooking spray instead of a 9x13" pan. Delicious!!  Thanks Cheri for sharing!  Now I can delete all the other "Apple Crisp" recipes!

Doubled the crisp, greased the pan, added a bit of nutmeg - that part all worked out well. But Overall, unspectacular... I loved the crisp part on the bottom, but I found the top too powedery - I would reccommend adding more butter so it would melt together better. Also, I thought it was rather too sweet - and I have a huuuuuge sweet tooth. It has good potential though! :)

oh my my my, just woke up from my sugar crash, worth every wink.  Definately the best crisp anything I have ever had.  Doubled the recipe, like one had suggested, and put it in a greased 9x13 pan.  Very sweet and crumbly, and almost gone.  It was so big thought it would last all week, ah right.  Thinking I need to go and get some more apples.  Yum will make again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

You need to make TWICE the amount of crumble! The amount in the recipe is enough for the bottom of the pan or to cover the apples, but not both. It still tasted good, but if I were to make it again, I would double the crumble and cut the thick sauce in half!

Absolutely fantastic.  People literally licking their plates.
 Great with or without ice cream.  I suggest using a 9 x 9 or 8x 8 inch pan.  Much thicker that way!

Oh wow!  This is definitely a keeper!  My husband, who ALWAYS has something to say about new recipes that I try, RAVED over this recipe just as it is!!!  The ONLY thing I did different was to add about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Next time I may try adding some chopped pecans to the topping, but it is amazing just like it is!!!!!!!!!!!

I make this all the time it is truly a family fave.   I always look forward to the fall just to make this again with fresh apples.   I actually double the crisp part because we like a lot of that with our apples.  I find with the sauce you make, and pour over the apples it helps to make it not so runny as I have had some apple crisps do.   Just love this recipe and thought since I am planning on making it again this weekend that I should probably finally write a reveiw!

For a moist but not soggy crisp, I add some apple butter or to more bland apples, crab apple butter and then who needs the water or the extra sugar! I also leave the skins on for more fiber and nobody cares 'cause it's just as good!

I've made alot of apple crisp.  But this is the best and the easiest yet.  Ive used this recipe many times since coming across it and never lets me down.  The syrup really helps to keep this moist and very tasty.  If I dont have alot of apples on hand, I will add frozen blueberries, cherries or raspberries. Then it becomes a bumble berry crisp. There is never any left overs of this desert and from that I know that this recipe is a keeper.

This is a great recipe!! I did not use the 9x13 pan though, used an 8x8. It was a good thickness. The only thing I will change next time is making extra crumb topping. I had to spread very thin, wasnt enough. I topped it off with french vanilla ice cream!! Family loved it!!

For 9x13 pan I needed almost a double batch of crisp mix and used 6 cups of Granny Smith apples. Sauce was a little starchy so the 2nd batch I substituted 2 teaspoons of cornstarch and felt consistency and flavor was improved.

I too cut the brown sugar to 1/2 c and the white sugar to 1/4.  I added about 10 medium apples and baked it in a 8x8 pan.  YUM!

Baked apples are great but this receipe needs more seasoning and the corn starch sticky stuff has no flavor so why bother.

This was delicious! With the exception of adding more apples, we followed every step exactly.   Yummy crunchy bottom with crumbly top. The sauce made it moist and gooey.  I did not need to double to dry ingredients, there was enough.  I love this, my family loved this and my friends loved this too!!

This is the first time I've made a review. My family devoured this apple crisp. It was dangerously delicious!  I made one day before yesterday, making another one right now for our LSU party tonight. I took the advise of another reviewer and doubled the crumb mixture. I used a 9x13" pan and put 1/2 of doubled crumb mixture on the bottom and the other 1/2 on top. The only problem I had with this recipe, was not having any left the next day! Thank you very much for the recipe. My husband, my dad, in-laws and kids cant get enough of it!!

We all loved this kids included! Must use 8x8 or 9x9 pan, other would be too big and used 2 or 3 different types of apples for more flavor. Brown sugar crumble layers were amazing! Easy to make!

It's wonderful! I made it yesterday as a special treat for my husband... He couldn't get enough. He asked me if I was trying to make him fat!?! I've been on an allrecipes.com marathon and though he and the kids have liked everything so far this is the hands down winner!  The only change, like others, is I doubled the recipe for the "crumble", makes for the perfect crisp!

I have been making this for a couple of years now.  I get asked to make this often from several people.  It even tastes great if I leave the cinnamon out (my manager has an allergy).  If I am using a 9 x 13 pan I do double the recipe.

Very good recipe - I made some modifications. I used tart granny smith apples, used lemon juice instead of vanilla (this also helped the apples stay whiter and not turn brown. I made 3x the topping and placed half on the bottom of the crisp and 1/2 on the top. Instead of the butter in the topping I used 1/2 the amount in apple sauce and half the amount in oil. Very good!

I made this last night for my husband and me and we loved it!  I put in a 9x9 dish, added a couple of chopped pears and few strawberries... we had warm with vanilla ice cream.  I can't wait to make it again next weekend.

This recipe rules! I "healthied it up" by replacing all of the white sugar and 1/2 of the brown sugar with baking Splenda and using whole wheat flour instead of white. Soooooooo good!

WOW!!  This was incredible!  I mixed the crust ingredients in the food processor because I like the finer texture better.  I doubled the recipe and still used a 9x13 pan.  I added about 2 tsp cinnamon to the syrup so it was a nice brown color and had a stronger cinnamon flavor. The finished product was SO delicious and smelled wonderful.  I've made a lot of apple crisp, but this is my favorite!  If you're going to make the recipe as it is written and not double it, please use a smaller pan.

I used gluten-free all purpose flour instead of regular flour, so I'm sure mine tasted different from everyone else, but it worked very well. The only gluten free oats I could find were steel cut instead of rolled so that changed the texture a little bit, but it also added more crunch. So that's an idea if you like more crunchy topping. I'm surprised that many reviewers thought it didn't have enough crumble. I thought it had quite a lot. I like that the crust is on the bottom too. I think next time I will try a little bit of cloves or nutmeg. Very easy and good. Yum!

This was really good. I added carmel and ice cream too! I followed the recipe exactly, only making a little more crumble for the top. I used honey crisp apples, 3 large ones did the trick.

Very good - Not quite like Grandma's, but still delish!  I went ahead and doubled the crumb crust, only had four apples to spare (foolish...), and kept the syrup original size, as well.  If you're gonna do this in a 9X13 - double the whole thing, not just the crumble.  Added more cinnamon, ground cloves and nutmeg - to not just the crumble, but the syrup as well.

This was a good recipe.  The kids love the school apple crisp (can you believe I am trying to find a recipe that our public school uses?!) and this comes closest to their liking.  I've had several request for me to make it again.

Scrumptious! I love the crumbly topping to the top and bottom of this dish! Who doesn't like that stuff? ;)I did doubel the curmb mixture because I didn't think that 1/2 was enough to cover the bottom of a 13 x 9. Even I have to admit though that doubling the crumble means you should have enough apples to stand up to it...otherwise it was fabulous!

This was such a great recipe!  Both my husband & I really enjoyed it.  Next time, I want to bake it in a 8x8 dish to give it more volume for presentation.  In a 9x13 pan, it's flat.  Overall, great taste and easy to make.  Thanks!

I used granny smith apples to add some tart to the sweet and it turned out very well.  I added extra vanilla not sure how much cause i just poured some in.  Added 1/2 tsp cinnimon, 1/2 allspice to the topping and also tossed the apples with cinnimon and allspice before i poured the syrup on top.  Also put all the crisp on the top and used the smaller pan.  5 stars with the changes I made.  It is very sweet and goes well with ice cream.
**EDIT** I served the crisp to my 93 year old grandparents the next day and the LOVED it.  It was just what my grandma wanted.

This was really yummy!  I love that the apples have the syrup in them.  The only changes I made were to add the vanilla to the syrup mixture AFER it had thickened before pouring it on the fruit.  Then I doubled the whole recipe to fill the 9x13" pan since others had said it was too thin for that big a pan.  I wouldn't change a thing...sooooo good.  We can't wait to eat it for breakfast!
Made this again for the folks at work-added a few handfuls of frozen blueberries to the top of the fruit before topping with oatmeal mixture.  Went over huge-not one bit left by lunchtime.  Really the best apple crisp recipe I've ever had!

This is so good. I cut the recipe in half, added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the crumb mixture, and baked in a glass pie dish. The nuts gave it a nice flavor and added crunch. Served with vanilla ice cream.

LOVE this recipe.  I've been making it for several years.  I sometimes sub peaches for the apples.  I've also added a cup of frozen raspberries to the syrup mixture, cooked until they fell apart, then strained  through a fine sieve (hate those seeds!) and pour over.  You might have to add a little extra sugar to the raspberry syrup, but it is divine!  I also double the crust mixture.

I have been making this one for years. I couldn't find my copy today, and I panicked.  I agree that a 9x13 is too big for one batch. I have 3 kids, so I always make a double. I usually add more spices & don't melt the butter. Depending on the apples, I add less sugar too. I like the apple juice/cider suggestions. I think I will try that when I make it this afternoon. 
All in all, a GREAT recipe.

I didn't have any oats on hand, so I just skipped them the crumble topping still came out perfect.  I used a mix of granny smith and macintosh apples, and also added fresh grated ginger and lemon zest to the simple sugar mixture for extra flavor.  A yummy and bubbling warm dessert with vanilla ice cream.  I can't wait to try making it again with the oats next time.  Thanks!

My husband said this is the best desert I've ever made and I bake all the time!!!  I doubled the amount of apples and drizzled them with maple syrup and honey in addition to the corn starch syrup in the recipe.  I also used half granny smith and half jonathon apples.  There wasn"t so much as a crumb left over.

This was great!  I ran out of corn starch so I used flour, instead and it worked pretty good.  I also used 1 cup of oats instead of 3/4 cup because i like the crumbly-ness of oats more.  Very easy to make.

My favorite apple crisp recipe BY FAR!  Definitely one of the best I've ever had.  I used an 8x8 glass dish, but didn't change anything else.  Always a hit whenever I make it... dh and I fight over the last piece, LOL!

This recipe is the best! It was incredibly simple and came out looking and tasting yummy. I made a few modifications based on other reviewers' recommendations. I used an 8x8 pan, which is a perfect fit, and decreased the amount of brown sugar to 3/4 cup. I also used 2 Fuji apples and 2 Granny Smith. The tartness of the apples mellows out the sweetness of the sugars. This is a great potluck item and would taste delicious with vanilla ice cream. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My boyfriend really liked this (so did I).  Next time I might add a little nutmeg and cinnamon to the sugar syrup, but otherwise it was delicious and it came out perfectly.

I made this on St. Patrick's Day and my whole family loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I used a glass casserole dish 8 x 8, and didn't separate the crumb layer.  I put a little non-stick spray on first and layered the apples, then all the crumb layer and it turned out great!  I thought it was really sweet like some of the other reviewers and I probably could have cut out some of the sugar, but it was still good. Thank you for this recipe.

As I live in Cameroon, I did this recipe with pineapple... It was delicious!  I just cook the pineapple with sugar and some water (not too much because the fruit is juicy!) and did the mix of crumbled with half sugar because pineapples around here are extremely sweet!  Thanks a lot for the recipe!  I will try next with mango!

Best Apple Crumble Ever! One modification I made to the recipe was that I stewed the apples in a mixture of sugar and water to soften them a little bit, and then poured the mixture per recipe. Turned out even better. Tastes amazing with vanilla ice-cream. Everyone loved it!

It was good, but it wasn't the best.  My boyfriend really liked it but he said it was because it tasted like oatmeal...which wasn't the idea...but anyway it was decent.  I prefer crisp's that are a little bit more...crispy!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used 5 cups of apples instead of 4. Came out O.K. but lacked flavor and was very dry. Also, it would have been helpful if they advised you to butter the pan before adding the ingredients. I used a non-stick pan and had a real hard time getting it out. Would not make again.

I doubled the crumble mixture, added some slivered almonds for extra crunch and just a little extra marg. I halved the brown sugar, and it probably could have been even less again, it was ok, but still a little too sweet. I think it would have been nicer without the crumble on the bottom. Just the 8x8 tray lined with apples and the sugar syrup and topped with the crumble. I served with warm fresh custard. It's not the best I've ever tried.

Yummy!!!  I used Rome apples because I had some that were fixing to go bad.  It would probably be even better with a tarter apple.  I did cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup like others had suggested and served with vanilla ice cream.  I didn't find it too sweet and I liked the layer of crisp on the bottom and not just sprinkled on top.  Oh, and I did use a 9" pie plate which worked fine.  Don't forget to grease the bottom.

good, but very sweet.  i doubled the crisp part of it because it seemed like way too little. if i made it again, i'd modify it to be less sweet. it wasn't really crispy either, but i liked the taste of the oatmeal.

Absolutely loved this apple crisp! I love the 'crisp' bit so i doubled those ingredients. I loved the sticky gooey center and my boyfriend who normally doesn't like apple desserts couldn't stop raving about it! Definately a keeper.

Delicious!!! I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup and the sweetness was just right. Per other reviews, I used an 8X8 pan, and the crust and topping turned out great.  I must not have cooked it quite long enough though because the apples were just a tad crunchy. My only complaint is that I have to get it out of the house...I want to keep eating it.

Great recipe although a bit sweet.  Made it twice with Rome Beauty apples.  First time my adult children said it needed more topping, so I made it the second time increasing topping ingredients by 50% using 1/3 in baking dish and 2/3 for the topping.  No additional changes required according to the experts in the family!

WOW!  This was a huge success at the dinner I took it to!  What a great recipe.  I only used 1/4 cup butter, and added 1/3 cup butterscotch chips to melt with the butter.  Everything else was the same, and wow, everyone wanted the recipe!  The crunchy layer underneath added a crispier touch to an old favorite.

This came out great!  I followed the recipe exactly - and it definitely wasn't too sweet.  May have been my selection of apples (Macouns and Empires).  In fact, I'd almost say that I'd add more brown sugar to the recipe next time and more butter - so that the crumbles weren't as dry.  Will definitely make again!

Good, but slightly sweet for our taste.  Next time, l'll use less sugar, I think that would make it 5 Stars.  Also, since we like topping, I didn't put any on the bottom and put it all on the top.

this is The Best Ever. Even my grandmother loved it! I've made crisps where the apples swimm in a liquid, and some that are too dry. This one incorporates a cornstarch-sugar gel type thing that gives a perfect balance of each! one thing though- I doubled the cornstarch mixture, and made 1 and 1/2 batch of the apples and crust. It turned out perfect. Thanks for the keeper, Cheri!

YES! This is so perfect- I used Granny Smiths and covered them in lemon juice. This one is actually going to replace my mother's recipe which has been a favorite for generations- sorry!! 

This is suppose to be a moist version but I actually found it more crisp than what I am used to. The oatmeal is excellent with the brown sugar- I used dark- better than pie crust! What can I say? This is the recipe than finally made me join this site so I could write a review for it. Quick and soo worth the 45 minutes to cook- it will make your house smell wonderful too. Just try not to burn yourself as you sneak a bite before it cools!

Wow! That was great!  It wasn't too crispy and yet it was by no means soggy!  The only thing I may do differently next time is to use a smaller pan.  I thought it was a bit thin in the 9x13 and I like a bit thicker crust.  Also, after I covered the bottom with apples, I sprinkled the apples a little with cinnamon before putting on the saucepan mixture. AWESOME, will definetly be making this again.

I made this for a family dinner last night. Overall it was  quite good and I will make it again with several changes. After reading other reviews, I cut the sugar in the apples to 3/4 c. but it was still too sweet...the entire family agreed on this. I will use 1/2 c. next time. I also omitted the water, which worked well, as the apples had plenty of juice. The topping was great, but wish there was a little more of it, so will make one and half times what the recipe calls for the next time around.

This was a very tasty recipe, I'll definitely use it again. I took some of the others advice and cut the brown sugar in 1/2. It was still too sweet. Next time I'll cut the white sugar as  well.

Easy and so so yummy. Used macintosh from my yard, they usually make everything watery. With the syrup mixture you make in this recipe it kept the crisp from being runny! One of the best crisps i ever made and will make often! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Following other suggestions, I only used 1\2 cup of brown sugar and put all the crumble on top. I also used some extra vanilla and put 1\4 tsp of nutmeg in the sauce. It was really good but overly sweet. Next time I will use only about 1\4 of the sauce, if any at all. The crumble part was perfect though!

We liked this.  I rated *** because if I hadn't taken other reviewers suggestions I don't think it would have worked for us.  I added the cinnamon to the 'sauce' instead of to the crust, used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

It was okay, the apple/cornstarch part was good as was the crumble part on top. The crust turned out too thick and hard it was done cooking before the apples were. Deffinatly worth trying, but I'd use less than half on the bottom.

I don't like apple crisp, and I LOVED this one!!  It's even good without ice cream or custard!  Something I might do different though... 1. Smaller pan - it was very thin.  A smaller pan would make it thicker.  2. I would double the crisp topping stuff, so there would be more on top and on bottom!  This one is a keeper!!!

I am a picky person so consider that while reading my review.  As others suggested I doubled the crisp (I like it extra crispy).  I used granny smith apples which balanced the sweet sour out nicely.  The main complaint would be that even though it's called an Apple Crisp, it seemed to be missing a lot of the crisp.  It was gooey but not really crispy.  The taste was very good, but the textured  made it seem like the title should be changed to something less "crispy".  I'll try this again adjusting the recipe a bit.

My three year old nephew woke up from his nap crankier than ever.  I gave him a slice of this and he was the happiest kid the rest of the day, not sure if it was all the sugar, but his 9 year old brother also raved about it.  For added flavor I used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar.  Add some nuts for extra texture and enjoy.  I highly recommend this to everyone!

This apple crisp is wonderful! having both an upper and lower crust makes it easy to serve.

It was a bit sweet for my family; you may want to reduce the brown sugar by half, to 1/2 cup.

i thought this tasted very good, the only problem was that it stuck to the pan and was very hard to get out. i would recommend using some butter or spray before putting the crust in. Also would recommend a smaller pan.

This is the best apple crisp recipe ever. In reading some of the other reviews, simply spray the pan with non-stick spray and it comes out fabulous. Baked for about an hour, but otherwise didn't change a thing!

This apple crisp is awesome!  I would compare it to the very best restaurant apple crisp.  It's great served warm with vanilla ice cream.  My three-year-old and four-year-old help me to make it, so it's not that hard to do...and then they help me eat it afterwards, so everyone wins!!!

This was really good. I have been looking to an apple crisp recipe that wouldn't get soggy and this one did the trick I esp liked the topping as a base coat for the apples. This was delicious not too sweet.

Soooo good! Next time I would make it in a smaller pan to be a bit thicker, but the crumble was delicious and just the right amount considering it was on the top and the bottom.
Made it with crabapples and didn't peel them, that was just fine.

I doubled the recipe but kept it in a 9x13 pan. I cooked it for an hour instead of 45 min and I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the sauce just for extra flavor. All in all it was very tasty and I will definitely make it again!

I love this recipe ! It was so moist. I used granny smith apples and they tasted great. Next time I will double the recipe.  I also used almond extract since I had no vanilla. What a great taste. For sure I will make again and top it with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. What a great treat on a Fall day! Thanks Cheri.

I added the apples to the syrup before pouring over the crumb mixture.  My Husband liked it but I wasn't crazy about it.  And i think because of using melted butter rather than cold butter the crisp didn't crisp like I would have preferred.

I used 2 Honey Crisp and the 1 1/2 Red Delicious apples.  I followed the recipe exactly other than putting it in an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13.  We thought it was delectable.  The sauce turns some of the crumb mixture slightly chewy, which is always good in my book.  It has a large proportion of crisp and I wouldn't recommend changing the amount of those ingredients.  If you really like a lot of apples, I would recommend adding more apples.  It turns out to be about 2/3 crisp and 1/3 apple in an 8x8 pan, which is just how I like it.  We topped it with black walnut ice cream and it was scrumptious.

I love this recipe.  I've never had an apple crisp with a bottom crust, so I didn't divide it.  I just piled the whole thing on top, and made the whole thing in a 9x9 pan.  I also added a little ginger to the crumb mixture.  It just adds a little extra flavor - I just dump a little in, but I Think it comes to equal about 1/4 of a teaspoon.  The apples, get a consistency of apple sauce, but i serve this with vanilla ice cream, and it's just perfect.  The top stays hard and crunchy which is amazing to me.  I think I've made this 4 times since I got the recipe and I love it each time.  We even like it cold.

Yummalicious.  I did 1.5x the crumble recipie, just 'cause we like it.  Forgot to add the cinnamon after I'd already presed half into the pan, so tossed half into the apple mix and half into the remaining "topping".  Was groovy.  Also used the micro for the cornstarch/water mix - 1.5 minutes, whisked, 1.0 minutes, whisked.  Done.  No way to "pour over" apples, though, mixed the slices with the thickening mixture (hand toss in bowl).  Also used about 2 cups more apples than recipe.  Probably could have used even more.  Lovely recipe, though.  Thanks!

I made the crust exactly and doubled as others have suggested. The filling I just used apples peeled and chopped, mixing a scant amount of sugar and spices with them. I did not use water, cornstarch or vanilla. I did use a 9x9 pan and probably didn't have to double the crust, but we like crust and it was good. It was delicious and not a bite left!

This is so good! I had 7 golden delicious apples to use up so that's the amount I put in a 7x11 pan. I used brown sugar in the syrup instead of white, and added cinnamon. After mixing the apples with the syrup, I put them right in the greased pan and put all of the crisp portion on top. I used a full cup of oatmeal. Perfect amount of crunch.

This turned out great! I doubled the recipe and added strawberries to make a fall dessert a little more summery. Next time I think I would use less sugar and butter.

I made this for Easter at my in-laws and it was the first thing to go!! Although the filling liquid did not get to clear and started to burn (my fault) but it was still AWESOME!!!

I loved this Apple Crisp. I think the only thing I would do next time is use a little less sugar.  Other than that, I will for sure make this again.

Since I couldn't find my old recipe for Apple Crisp I thought I'd try this one.  I will go look for the old one.  This was not what I wanted.  It was ok. but not good.

This recipe has good texture and aroma but too sweet for our taste even after reducing all sugars by 1/4 cup each.  Did not have cornstarch and was not sure about using plain flour so just melted the sugar in the water, used only 3/4 of the syrup because it was too much for my pan. It still came out nice and gooey. Had to bake an additional 10 mins at increased temp (200 deg C) for the syrup to bubble (probably due to not adding the cornstarch). Yummy out of the oven (even though we got a sugar jolt at 1 am).  The sweetness was tempered after the pie went in the fridge overnight. But will try again with more reduced sugar.

I have used this recipie for 5 years and shared it with many family members. I usually double the oat topping mixture as this is my favorite part. The addition of cloves sounded like a great idea one Christmas, it was not. This is a great staple desert.

This was yummy.  The only things I changed was that I made it in a round pie dish, and cut the white sugar by half.  It turned out great, will make again.  I agreed that a 9x13 pan would be too thin, that is why I chose the pie dish.

I doubled this recipe before I read the reviews because I could tell there wasn't going to be enough to fit into the dish.  
My husband and daughter enjoyed it, but I found the crumble on the top not crumbly enough and it hardened too much while baking.  
I don't think I'd make it again, I'll search on this site for a different apple crisp recipe.

This turned out very good.  It needed more crumble mixture, so I added a little more oatmeal than called for.  Also I had to bake for about an hour, but was very good.  I will make this again.

Really a great recipe! I used granola cereal as a substitute for the oats makes an interesting texture and flavor - use your favorite. I also topped it off with a quarter cup of granola and two tablespoons of cold butter cut into small pieces just before baking. I sprinkled the apples with a little lemon juice and then with about a teaspoon of apple pie spice before adding the hot liquid.

My family loved this.  I did cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8 x 8 stoneware pan.  I used Northern Spy apples which are on the tart side.  I noticed that some of the negitive reviews complained about dish being too sweet - I think this can easily be altered with the type of apples used and the ratio of topping and apples.  This is the only apple crisp recipe I will use in the future.

This was very tasty.  I was disappointed in that the 'crust on top' didn't 'cook' and found that the crust on the bottom became too hard to scrape out of the pan but it was much more complete than other recipes I've tried.

I think next time I'll try moister apples and see if the top cooks better

I made this using a 1 1/2 qt round baking dish instead of the 9x13. I'm glad I did, because it turned out great! I read the reviews and cut down a bit of the white and brown sugar and using granny smith apples - marvelous.

I did  like someone else mentioned and that was double the topping and put 1/2 of the doubled topping on the bottom and 1/2 on the top.  I actually sprinkled cinnamon over the apples before putting on the final topping.  We  liked it but have had better recipes so prob. will not make again.

Delicious Recipe and very easy.  I did bake in an 8x8 pan and it worked out perfect.  I think next time I will cut brown sugar down to 3/4 cup for crumb topping, and 1/4 cup for white sugar in syrup.  Other than that, everything was perfect!

Would have given it 5 stars, but WAY too sweet as according to directions. Will definately make again but will use 1/2 of the sugars and even half of the butter to cut the fat. Delicious!

I added a bit of cinnamon to the sauce. It turned out perfect, tastes good warm or cold.

CHANGES: Used 1/2 the amount of white and brown sugar and cut the butter to 6 Tbsp. Also used instant multigrain hot cereal packs (Quaker Simple Harvest) instead of oats. REVIEW: Based on the changes, I loved this recipe. We eat much less sugar in our diet and it was still very sweet (especially when you add some butter pecan ice cream). I really liked the water, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla sauce. That really made the recipe come together. Next time, I will try even less sugar.

I made this last week and it went down a treat. Everyone LOVED it. It was moist, and best served warmed up (of course).  I would add all spice instead of cinnamon to give some added spice depth.

Tasted like an apple crisp, nothing more, nothing less. It's good and easy when you don't have much time to prepare dessert, but I will keep looking for an "out of this world" apple crisp!
Good recipe though, nothing bad about it.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to double the topping on this recipe.  Okay, I like things to be sweet, but this was SWEET.  Way too much sugar in my opinion, but then again there was twice the topping.  Seems like the cup of sugar in the apples is really excessive, especially considering the topping on them.  Aside from that, it's a great topping that would probably be great on lots of different fruit layers!  Seems like it would be handy to just keep the topping ingredients mixed in a container (minus butter, of course) for impromptu mini-crisps!

Very very delicious. I made it with apples I got from apple picking.  It's just the right sweetness, and it's much better than using an ordinary pie crust. Loved the oatmeal in it, too.  Will definitely make again!

The syrup in this recipe gave the apple crisp a chewy, candy-like texture, it was amazing. My fiance who loves any kind of apple crisp almost fainted over this one! Next time I would make 50% more of the topping, though, and I didn't use melted butter in the topping: I cut softened butter into the oats and flour to make a more crumbly topping. Very, very good!

This was the first time I have made apple crisp and I was a little leery about it, but it wasn't as hard as I thought.  The only real problem I had was trying to figure out how many apples I would need so as not to waste.   The other problem was that it doesn't really say how high to cook the syrup on so I was worried that it would be overcooked even though I cooked it for the right time.  Overall, a great recipe!

Mmm this is a great recipe...I did change a couple of things like you should DOUBLE the crumble part. I left the apple skins on and I they're great. I also only used 1/2 of the water/sugar mixture and instead of using the white sugar I used maple syrup (full on Canadian)! It is a bit dry but overall good recipe

This was not my favorite apple crisp recipe.  I found it to take like flour in the end.  I had to double the oat crumble because what was directed wasn't nearly enough.  And when finished I actually should of tripled the oat crumble because there wasnt enough to cover the top and the apples got dried out and chewy.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Terrific!  I made this in an 11 x 7 glass baking dish, and increased the apples to 6 cups.  I also used Granny Smith apples, and everyone gobbled it up!

This is one of my favorite dessert recipes. I really like the syrup that is poured over the apples, and I always add extra oatmeal to have more crumbly topping. Everyone who has this swears it's the best apple crisp they've ever had. It's amazing.

Wow !!!  Wow !!!! Wow !!!!  That is the very best apple crisp I have ever tasted. I love the sweetness of it. That's the one thing I always disliked about some apple crisp when they are sweet and the apples are so tart that they just don't mix. I used sweet apples that I had in the fridge that needed to get used up so it was a perfect combination. I made it for my husband but I always taste test before serving things to people and now I am tempted to hide it and not tell him I made it so I can keep it all for myself ! I poured some cream over it when it was just slightly cooled...YUMMY !!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe !!

Very good! Followed the recipe and found that 1/2 the oat mixture was too little to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan, so next time I would make more of that mixture. Kept in the refrigerator well, but was VERY moist after refrigeration. I imagine it would be better eaten freshly baked (and warm) with vanilla ice cream!

This was DELICIOUS!!!  My grandma thought I was crazy for putting a bottom crust on apple crisp, but changed her mind after she ate it.  It's so good that I'm making it for Thanksgiving over Pumpkin Pie!

This was my first time trying to make apple crisp.  I wanted to make it for my parents coming into town.  Well, by the time they got here, it was time to make another pan.  I love it!  It is SO MUCH easier (and better) than pie.  I also made it in a smaller pan, which I am thankful I did or it would have been very thin!  It's a wonderful recipe and sure to become a favorite.  PS:  I accidently used corn syrup instead of corn starch and it still turned out great.  :)

I had decided to try out cherry crisp and found this recipe instead. I used a can of cherry pie filling and made the sugar syrup as well to go on it. I couldn't beleive how well it turned out. It was phenominal. The topping wasn't crumbly but it was still so good we all fought over the beaters afterwards. I also tried it with apple, blueberry, and peaches, and it seems to work for any kind of fruit. With fresh apples as the recipe calls for, it's even better. Definately a personal and family favorite! I give it a 10!

This was wonderful!  My boyfriend isn't too fond of desserts, but loves apple crisp.  I made this, only I didn't use it as the bottom, but only as the crumble topping and he devoured it.  He was full and asked for more in fear of missing out.  I continue to make this everytime I want to do something special for him.  Huge hit!!!

Very good. Got rave reviews from friends at a breakfast party and people wanted the recipe.I used margarine instead of butter as one guest cannot have dairy products. Also, added some sprinkles of cloves and didn't add cornstarch because I did not have any.Also put in 9 in pan and it was tick.  Very good. Thanks!

DELISH! I made this recipe for company and served it warm with vanilla ice cream...I made it in a 9 inch springform pan and it turned out Perfect! The only thing I might however change(even though the recipe as is is great) is to add a couple more apples, just for the " gooey" effect".
Definitely a keeper in my book.

Yummy!! I made extra topping and used a smaller pan, as recommended by other reviews. Served it up warm with really rich vanilla icecream. This apple crisp was such a hit - I know I will use it many times.

This is the best apple crisp recipe ever...What 
i do is use 12 apples instead of 8 and sprinkle them with a few tablespoons of cinnamon before covering with the simple syrop. This gives it more flavour and makes it thick and moist!

It was very tasty, but I found that it should be doubled for a 9x13 pan. It wasn't very deep in the pan and my kids and husband ate nearly the whole pan at one time.

This recipe was excellent.  One of the best apple crisp recipes I have ever tasted.  I took the comments from one of the other bakers and put this into a 9 inch square pan instead of the 9x13 and it came out wonderful!  Use a little non-stick cooking spray on the bottom of the pan to help it come out after baking.

Very good recipe. I sprinkled a few raisins and white chocolate chips over the apples before adding the crumble mixture. Needs to bake 1 hr. or so.

This recipe was just ok.  I loved the crust and crumb topping flavor wise but did not find it to be moist.  I used twice as much crumb mixture because it was not enough for the results I was wanting. Only one of my 4 kids liked it but they didn't have ice cream with it which was very good. I probably will go back to my old recipe since this wasn't any better and my old one has one less step.

As I sit here devouring this, I find myself searching for just the right adjective to describe this recipe.  IT IS FABULOUS, and then some.  Best apple crisp I've ever had.  Will be making it time and time again.  Great over vanilla ice cream.

When I made this recipe I scaled it down to four servings and added a 1/2 cup extra apple and it turned out perfect.  I will definately make it again.
