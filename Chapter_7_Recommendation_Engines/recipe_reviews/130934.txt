I'm not having a good day. At all. So, after my monsterish morning, I came home and looked up a drink recipe I'd not tried yet. This was the winner. And boy, what a winner. I like this very much. I did double the vodka, but only because I like my drinks stronger. Little fruity with a touch of tart. Very nice.

Maybe I'm not a fan of club soda, but this didn't taste that great to me, but I'm more of a sweeter drinker, so that could be the issue.

I think the club soda is unnecessary, maybe omit it and double the lemon-lime soda.  Nothing special, will not make again.

I used 3 ounces sparkling lemon water and 1 ounce club soda and it was perfect.
