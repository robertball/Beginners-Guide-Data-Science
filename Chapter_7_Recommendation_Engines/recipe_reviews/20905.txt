Very good! The mushroom adds a whole new dimension. It was not needed to cook the snails in the butter/garlic mixture, as mine were canned, they were already cooked. You do not need to have garlic bread, but I would reccomend using some sort of bread to soak up the juices because that makes it taste AMAZING! I really enjoyed this recipe, thank you so much!

Excellent Recipe, try topping with Parmesian cheese, or Mozzerella, or chedder the last couple of minutes, it adds even more flavour to this appetizer

Wonderful and sooooooooooo easy.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and liked them very much.  Made them again for Christmas eve with a couple of changes.  Set aside 2 whole escargot for each stuffing mushroom, put rest in mini chopper with garlic  and 1/4 small onion .  Sauteed all in the butter then put the whole escargot in the caps and poured the rest over all before nuking the second time.  Sooooooooooo good.

I haven't had escargot for years. I loved them then...and I still love them now! I used the canned snails and they were yummy!! Next time, I'll try to find fresh ones. Don't be put off by the the animal; they're as clean and as delicious as shrimp. Thanks for the recipe!

I have never understood this picture with the green, but I have made this several time.  Always wonderful and always easy.  Everyone is very impressed.  I soaked my snails in half and half because I didn’t have any milk...they seemed extra sweet and tasty.  I only have to microwave about two minutes before adding the snails and two minutes after.  But I guess everyone’s microwave is different.
