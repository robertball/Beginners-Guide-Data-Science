Made this exactly as listed except used 1/2 tbsp Dijon mustard (because I didn't have any dry mustard) and a little extra Guinness (depends on the consistency you want) and it was AMAZING! My guests raved about it because it had more flavor than most fondue, but it did not overpower and the cheese taste still came through! Just make sure you use good cheese (we used aged extra sharp cheddar wheel cheese)...SO GOOD

One of the best fondues I have tasted yet.  The cheese is smooth with a hint of stout to it.  You can still enjoy with flavor of the bread, meat, or veggie without worrying about an overpowering cheese flavor.  EXCELLENT!

It was good but very sharp. I would really have to be in the mood for it to make it again.

This is a tasty recipe.  The only thing I suggest is cooking it on the stove and then keeping it warm over the fondue flame.  The cheese did not melt at all with my fondue set.  Was great once I melted it on the stove.

Made this for Recipe Group...I don't know what I did wrong, but this did not work for me. I ended up actually making this twice b/c I thought I did something wrong the first time, but it didn't work out the second time for me either. The cheese would not melt and I was very careful with measuring everything and the heat on the pot. This recipe has rave reviews, so maybe I'm just not meant to make fondue...

I made this recipe exactly as is for a St.Paddy's party and it was the talk of the night! Everyone loved it. The color of the fondue was darker than pictured (I used Guinness for the beer and A1 steak sauce and doubled the recipe), but the flavor was great!

Awesome fondue! I made this last year for our St. Patrick's Day party and all the guest raved about it. I'm definitely making it again this year!

This is a terrific tasting fondue.  We were looking for something different than our usual cheese fondue.  Made it exactly to the recipe and it worked perfectly. We now use this as our standard cheese fondue.  Also works great over a tea light as an appetizer. YUM

Wife was worried it wouldn't come together, but cheese finally combined with beer just short of boil.  Taste OK, but pretty thin in consistency.  Suggest use weight instead of volume for measure of cheese.

This will totally be made again by us! We adored the flavor profile. We did not have mustard powder so we added a teaspoon of stone ground mustard. We also went with about 2oz more of Guiness.

This did not work out.  I was very much looking forward to this, and made it first day of vacation... too bad.  The cheese didn't melt with anything like an acceptable texture.  The taste was not bad, and would probably have been good if it could have been experienced as intended, but I don't think I'll be quick to try it again.

The best fondue recipe we have tried! Creamy and FULL of flavor. We made it as the recipe shows. If you want it thicker, just add more cornstarch.

Fantastic. We have a fondue party every year and this is our go-to cheese recipe. The deep-flavored sauces and beer balanced with the creamy cheese make for a smooth, savory combination. Awesome!
