I've made this recipe (based on this recipe) many times over the past couple of years and just love it, as does my neighbour who writes for food magazines. I grate the zucchini & saute it, then add the chopped tomatoes, onion, garlic and a chopped red pepper, with chili flakes, fresh basil and dried dill, when I add the vegetable broth. I also add some garlic, ginger and chili mix I buy in jars from the grocery store.  I always double the batch and freeze half of it.  Lovely to look forward to on a chilly fall or winter evening.

I did change a couple of things, not ingredients but the method of getting there. We have a farm and sell at the local Farmer's Market so everthing is super fresh. I peeled my tomatoes and did NOT core them. I put the zucchini, tomatoes, garlic, onion and chili pepper in a roasting pan(covered in olive oil ) and roasted at 425 for about an hour turning them a couple of times. Roasted veggies are so much more flavorful.  When they were done I transfered them to the food processor and pureed. I then put them in my "soup pot" on the stove and added my herbs. I added the vegetable broth not using as much as the recipe called for.  This is a wonderful fresh soup that can be served rustic or very elegant to guests. Thanks to Susandon for posting!

We too have a glut of tomatoes and zucchini (courgettes to us Brits) during the summer months and this a classic soup with which to use up the abundant supply.  It is a favourite at dinner parties and if you like it a bit more spicy add a teaspoon of harissa paste.

I added 2 celery stalks with the onion. Mine was very loose and watery, so during the last 10 minutes, I  added a cup of evaporated milk and two cups of cooked rice to thicken it. Before serving I sprinkled some fresh chopped basil leaves on top, and we passed parmesan cheese at the table.  This  was easy and good.

This is a great recipe! I just added a little more zucchini and an extra red pepper for more kick and it was perfect! We will definitely make this one again.

I followed the advice of earlier reviewers and added the zucchini in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  I also skipped the listed spices and pureed one fresh seeded jalape√±o  with the tomatoes and onion.  This gave the soup a kick and cleared out my sinuses (terrific for a cold).  I also toasted some French bread and used it for dipping.  I would make this one again for sure.

The base of the soup is a good idea. Definitely add zucchini in the end. I added pink beans along with a can of garbanzo beans for more substance. Also added a lot more garlic. I think this recipe called for way too much tarragon however. A little tweaking made it better.

I thought this was okay--not bad, but not anything special, either. I used fresh herbs, and I wasn't crazy about the dill. Plus, all the flavor simmered out of the zucchini--I think it might be better to add it in during the last 5-10 minutes so it retains some texture and flavor. I don't plan to keep this one. Thanks, anyway.

Vegies came from my husbands garden, thank you hun. Spicy banana peppers, green peppers,zucchini, and tomato's. I'm not a vegie lover-this was great. I added more tomato's than called for...Enjoy warm spicy refreshing soup with salty crisp crackers garnishing with banana peppers...no seeds//no tarragon

Very good! I used heirloom tomatoes that were very large, so I also had to put in more zucchini. It came out great! I followed someoned advice and put the zucchini in the last ten minutes. I almost finished of the last of our tomatoes and the zucchini is finally gone. I am freezing a big batch of the soup too.

Fabulous soup.  I made a few changes...adding another 4 tomatoes, a large glass of white wine and used three small red (hot) chilies as I like spicy food.  I served it to friends and they went mad over it!  With fresh bread it was unbeatable!

My husband loved this, and he doesn't like soup nearly as much as I do.  I used dried chili powder instead of fresh red chili pepper, fresh dill instead of dried and omitted the tarragon.  I will definitely make this again.

Really 4 1/2 stars but I rounded up. It was a delicious way to use my garden vegetables! My husband also enjoyed it. I will make it again.
I did the following:
-Added a can of great northern beans when I pureed the soup to add some fiber and protein. Next time I will make it kidney beans to try and preserve the deep red color of the soup. 
-added chili powder and red pepper flakes instead of the chili because It was what I had on hand.
-used 10 medium tomatoes instead of 8 large.
-used chicken broth instead of vegetable.
-added extra garlic and left out the tarragon and dill because I didn't have any.
-I served it with cheese, garlic toast, and sour cream (a must!)
I froze the leftovers (there weren't many) in single serve portions to heat up in the microwave and eat during cooler weather.

The tomato's turned out grainy rather than smooth. The flavor profile wasn't what my family expected and it didn't get eaten.

I added one tablespoon of dried basil and used a pinch of red pepper seasoning in place of the red chilies. I added some cooked brown rice, for a little more body. Absolutely delicious and my favorite way to use all the abundance of garden tomatoes!

Finally a tomato soup recipe that uses fresh and not canned tomatoes!
 
 1) what kind of tomatoes work best? Roma? Plumb? Beefsteak?
 
 2) how can the recipe be modified to use a slow cooker instead?

This zucchini tomato soup is easy and tasty. Instead of adding a can or pre made vegetable broth, I soak dried mushrooms and dried lily bulbs in hot water, depending on how much bulk I want in the soup, I may use some of the mushrooms and lilies or toss em out. They're easy to find on Lamma Island, HK, and might be easily found in any asian grocery store elsewhere.

We did not care for the spices in this recipe but the basic soup stock was a good base/starting point.  Will try again with other spices.

This soup was OK. Not worth the time it took to puree the tomatoes. Didn't have much taste. I will continue searching for another recipe.

This was really nice, but it took a long time for the pureed onions and tomatos to cook. Delicious, but not a quick recipe.
