This was SUPERB! We used 2-3 times the garlic and shallots that were called for. The reduction took a bit longer since we were being careful not to scorch the garlic- maybe up to 40 minutes total. We also used close to a full pound of pasta. This dish had a wonderful flavor and we all loved it. This was an instant favorite!

My family loved this recipe. It really was delicious. You do need to allow the wine mixture to reduce to almost nothing before adding the butter and shrimp. As good or better than what you get in a restaurant!

This was outstanding. My reduction never really became a "thick golden glaze" as described in the recipe but I still thought it was delicious. My only change was to use chicken stock instead of fish stock.

This recipe had great flavor but the sauce was way too runny. If I made it again I would use half the liquid the recipe called for and add a thickening agent to it.

This recipe is lovely! I made it as outlined. My fish stock was created from Superior Touch - Better Than Boullion Lobster Base (which adds its own thickening agent). More expensive but well worth it. You must reduce the broth well before tossing with the pasta. Don't forget that the pasta will absorb some of the juices (I always let my pasta sit in the juices like you would let a roast rest after removing it from the oven...at least 10 minutes.) The parmesan and the pepper are key to the taste. I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again!

This was amazing! I to used chicken broth instead of fish stock. I also added a little cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.

This is really a delicious lighter pasta. If you're looking for a heavier cream sauce this is not the one to choose. To add depth to the flavor make a shrimp stock by boiling the shells from the shrimp. Add enough water to be able to reduce the stock to the required two cups. It doesn't really become a "glaze" but this recipe has wonderful flavor. Thank you for sharing!

I made my own stock so I found myself needing to add a little salt when adding the shrimp. I was a little worried that this recipe wouldn't turn out but by the end it starting coming together. I did add a little flour to thicken the sauce. I will make this again but it seemed to need another ingredient. I think next time I'll add maybe sliced baby portobello mushrooms or red peppers.

Yep...I made this for my daughters who were having sleepovers and if you can please junior high and middle school girls it's a hit! The sauce is nice and light. Exactly what I was looking for! Used clam stock instead of fish stock - based on availability.

What a disappointment! This was bland and flavorless. It took much longer to reduce the wine mixture than the recipe calls for. I might as well have boiled the penne boiled the shrimp and mixed them together.

Very tasty recipe. It took a long time for the liquids to cook down to a glaze but be patient because it's worth it for the right consistency and taste. Will definitely make it again & will probably try adding a veg next time.
