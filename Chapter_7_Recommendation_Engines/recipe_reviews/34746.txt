Excellent recipe.  As recommended, made the following changes, and it turned out wonderfully:
2 T. olive oil,
1 T. melted butter,
3/4 tsp basil,
1/2 tsp salt,
3 T lemon juice,
1 tsp dried parsley,
dash of dill weed.

Instead of wrapping fillets individually, I just put the foil on top of the baking dish.  I also skin fish before marinading (CRUCIAL for lessening fishy taste).  Overall VERY easy.  I make it with rice & serve the remaining marinade to drizzle on rice & fish.

I would like to give this one at least 6 stars. It was very good. I did decrease the olive oil to 1 (one) tablespoon and decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and I can not imagine it tasting any better. I marinated it in a plastic bag and kind of massaged the oil mixture into the salmon and then left it for an hour. I may decrease the pepper a wee bit next time. For you fellow Weight Watchers I calculated the points for a 6 ounce fillet to be 8.5. ***That is the points using 1 tblsp. of oil for the 2 fillets.  Enjoy! Thanks Norma.

We were trying to get into the habit of eating fish for dinner once a week.  We printed out several fish recipes - this happened to be the first one we tried.  We never got around to trying the others.  This has become a staple in our weekly menu. We don't use fillets, we use boneless salmon steaks instead (you'll need to bake for the full 45 mins. if you do too). I add two slices of lemon atop each salmon steak prior to closing up the packets.  Since we prefer to serve this over white rice (sounds odd but is delicious) we omit the parsley so that we're left with a bit of sauce after it's done baking which we then pour over and toss the rice in.  We place the rice on a plate, the salmon on top and serve with steamed broccoli all around.  Once a week every week and it's never gotten old.  I still look forward to it every week.

Oh my gosh!  I NEVER liked salmon before - but this was SO good!!  I doubled the garlic, halved the olive oil, and used 1 tsp dried parsley.  I was worried there wouldn't be enough juice, but after cooking the salmon for 45 minutes, there was plenty of yummy juice!  It was a tad salty (and I love salty food!), so I might decrease the salt to 3/4 tsp next time.  I will definitely make this over and over again - I'm proud of myself for actually loving a salmon dish!  (UPDATE:  I have started using this same method for chicken breasts, and they come out amazing too!!  I love to serve it over brown rice...the juice gives the rice a nice flavor.)

Really easy to make! A few notes: 1) There was way too much oil!! The fish was swimming in it! Use only 2 tablespoons and reduce the lemon accordingly if desired. 2) I used pressed grapeseed oil instead of olive oil and it was very light and added a buttery undertone that was nice. 3) I added 1/2 teaspoon of dill and was very glad I did. Next time I will add a full teaspoon. 4) I used half the salt and it was enough. 5) I marinated it only 1/2 an hour and it was plenty. You want to be able to taste the salmon! 6) I used 3 (8 ounce) fillets and baked in a small casserole dish with foil over the top, and a light coating of butter and lemon juice on the bottom. There was still enough marinate for the extra fillet. It worked very well except the marinate mix was about 1/2 inch deep after 20 minutes in the oven, hence the comment about too much oil. Overall an easy, low-mess marinate that I will make again with less oil.

This is a fantastic marinade that really brings out the flavors of the salmon! I do not use the tinfoil method as that tends to take too much time. Instead, I put the salmon in a glass dish, pour this fabulous marinade over the top and broil it. I've found that about 5-7 minutes on either side gets it done.

The marinade was just perfect as written...no need to change ingredients or measurements. If you like your fish steamed rather than baked, this cooking method will work fine. I would have much preferred this simply baked, and maybe finished off by broiling for a few minutes at the end. This steaming method just did not appeal to me or my husband..almost too moist and definitely needing some richness and color that baking/broiling would have created.  Will try again but open roasted.

I read all the great reviews on this recipe so I just had to try it, and boy am I glad I did. It was sooo good!!! All the other salmon recipes that I have are now history, as this is delicious and easy.  I only used 2 tbl. olive oil, 1/2 tsp. each of salt and pepper, and increased lemon juice to 3 tbl. I marinated the salmon for about 3 hours. I had to cut the cooking time down to 25 min. as it was done when I first checked it. Thanks Norma for a wonderful recipe!!

We loved this recipe!  I used the exact ingredients listed, only I tripled the recipe and marinated for 24 and 48 hours.  I thought the fish was even better after 48 hours. Also, 35 minutes was plenty for 3 fillets.

I normally would not eat salmon, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  Like others I reduced the olive oil to 4 tablespoons and increased the lemon juice to 2 tablespoons.  It was very easy and tasted great.  I can't stand fish that tastes too fishy and this definately didn't.  I will make this again.

If you’re making this recipe for the first time (as I did last weekend), be careful about some of the posted modifications.     I used two that turned out to be mistakes.
#1 - don’t add melted butter to your marinade!     Once it’s back in the fridge chilling, it’s not a marinade anymore, it’s a blob of thick goo.      
#2 - if you’re using salmon fillets, watch the size - thicker is definitely better.

This fish baked up moist and tasty. Instead of marinading in a glass dish, I put the fish fillets in a big ziploc bag with the marinade, and put them on a deep plate (and just turned the bag over instead of turning the fish itself). That made this dish FAR easier to clean up. I also squeezed extra lemon juice over the fish before serving. Also, I used parsley flakes instead of fresh parsley, and it was still great. Definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe for salmon. In my preparation, I used some hints from other reviewers: used 2 T olive oil and 1 T melted butter, added a dash of dill, only 1/2 t. salt, sprinkle of pepper, and baked it in the same glass pan I marinated the fish. Before adding the salmon, however, I sprayed the pan with butter flavored Pam. Covered pan with aluminum foil for both marinating and baking. No work, no fishy smell, and cleanup of pan very easy. Served with baked potato (since oven was on anyway), perfectly cooked fresh green beans, and a tossed vegetable salad. Gave the recipe to my dinner guest who was duly impressed with our meal. Although the recipe is prefixed by the comment this is a good way to prepare salmon by beginning cooks, those of us who are experienced cooks likewise love simplicity with such great results.

My salmon actually came out just a tad bit drier than I would have hoped for, but I'm still giving this recipe five starts because it had a wonderful flavor and I think the dryness was 'cooker error.' I dropped the temp. on my oven to 350, as it runs a little high, and cooked for about half an hour which I feel was probably about 6 or 7 minutes too long.  Fish was still very flakey and tender, just a litte dry.  I actually forgot to use the basil and sub'd garlic powder for fresh minced (forgot to buy some) and it still had a great flavor.  I also layeted red onion and greed pepper slices on top of my fish which added to the flavor.  I served it over steamed rice and poured the 'sauce' from the fish over the rice as well.  I think I sub'd about half the oil for melted butter because I enjoy a slight buttery taste with my fish.  Great recipe!

I love recipes that are simple to make and delicious - this recipe fits the bill!   I added about a tablespoon of dijon mustard to the marinade and sprinkled the fish with dill weed before baking.   Instead of wrapping the fish in foil, I put it in a glass baking dish and covered it with foil. I served it with a side of pasta with lentils and my four year old son ate two helpings of the fish.

Excellent Salmon! I loved salmon and the ingredients in this recipe caught my eye! I used all fresh basil, parsley, garlic, fresh squeezed lemon juice, hawaiian sea salt, fresh ground black pepper and olive oil. I sealed the salmon with all the marinade in an aluminum foil and baked it for 35 minutes, then opened up the foil, turned off the oven and let the salmon finish baking.  My salmon came out so tender, moist and fresh tasting! The herbs and fresh lemon juice really helps to bring out the flavors in the salmon. Salmon is very healthy for you I might add. I served this with brown rice -perfect and healthy!

This was very yummy.  I love salmon and I was looking for a new recipe to try.  I substituted dill for the basil, cut down the oil, and baked it on a baking sheet instead of putting it in foil. I thought the cooking time in the recipe was off and I was afraid of overcooking it. So it only ended up taking about 10-12 minutes and it was a delicious dinner.

This is a keeper for sure!  

I noted some of the modifications others made, and I made the following changes:  increased garlic to 4 cloves of pressed garlic, decreased olive oil to 1 Tbsp plus added 2 Tbsp melted butter, decreased basil to 3/4 tsp, decreased salt & pepper to 1/2 tsp, increased lemon juice to 3 Tbsp lemon juice, and I used 1 tsp fresh chopped cilantro instead of the parsley (yes! that was good). I wish I had some dill to add, but I didn't. 

I had two sm filets and marinated in ziploc bag. I placed the filets (with the marinade) in foil just to minimize cleanup, sealed the foil, then placed them in a pan (I didn't have a glass dish) and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then broiled uncovered for almost 5 minutes.

I served with rice and used the juice to pour over the rice.

OH!  This was good!!!!!

I am a huge salmon fan in general. I make it very frequently. My most important criteria when cooking salmon is that it is cooked all the way through just barely enough. This leaves the salmon INCREDIBLY juicy and flavorful. To be fair, I followed this recipe to the letter (but in the back of my mind I knew that 35-45 min cook time would be WAY TOO MUCH). I was right. The salmon was overcooked to an extreme. It wasn't delicate the way my salmon normally comes out. It was tough, and the only flavor was from the topping, which I ended up scraping off as it just didn't work since it was the ONLY thing you were left tasting. I will definitely not make this again.

I took the advice of other and cut the oil in half...a must-know tip. I also added sliced lemons over the fish before baking. I've made this two times and each time it came out perfect. I certainly will make it again and again. Very, very good. My favorite way to make salmon.

This is THE BEST salmon I have ever tried!  My husband and I have this at least every other week.  The ingredients really compliment the salmon perfectly.  When I prepare this dish I use only 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper, to lighten it up a little.  Delicious! UPDATE:  Over 3 years later and I still make this dish a lot!  Such great taste and so healthy and easy!

This was fantastic!  The only changes I made were that I added a little bit of dill to the marinade and I also cut back a bit on the oil.   I agree with another reviewer that cooking the salmon too long dries it out, so I baked it at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes and then broiled it for 5 minutes to crisp the garlic on top of my fillets. Oh, and I didn't wrap the salmon in foil, I just left it in the baking dish to cook it. It was perfect and totally moist inside.  The flavor was fantastic! My whole family really enjoyed this, even my husband who cringes everytime I tell him I am making fish for dinner.  I will definately be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and healthy way to make salmon. I cut the oil and salt in half, and used the juice from a whole lemon. I cooked for 35 min and it was totally overcooked. So next time I will cut to 25 min.

A winner every time. Even the non-fish-eater enjoys it! You can't go wrong with this one. More than the sum of its ingredients!

I found this recipe bland. The cooking time was far too much and I cooked for 30 minutes. About 15 minutes is all you would need.--summerk

This was absolutely fabulous.  I marinated it over night and added some dill to the marinade.  I made it before a night at the ballet.  It was mouthwatering and completely impressed my boyfriend.  He said if he hadn't seen me making it in the kitchen he never would've believed I made it.  I definitely recommend this.

So soooo good!!  The first time we ever made fish, and it came out perfect - gourmet style!  It's even better than any fish I tasted at a restaurant!!  

The only thing is - if you double the recipe, do NOT follow the guidelines of doubling everything.  We made 4 pieces of salmon instead of two, but the only thing we doubled was the garlic and lemon juice.. everything else was just 1 and a half.  (can you imagine doubling the oil and salt??  no way).  and it came out perfect.

Ablsoutely fabulous, THANK YOU for the recipe!!

Excellent salmon. I checked after about 25 min at 375 and the fish was done perfectly. 45 minutes would've been much too long. I increased the recipe to serve 6 and it was delicious. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is wonderful! I have made it twice now, I have not even used the tin foil. I just marinate it in the dish and cover it with tinfoil and bake it just like that! It is the same as taking it out and putting it in tinfoil and pouring the marinade in there! Save the hassle of the foil and it turns out delicious every time!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Even my 11 yr old son who doesn't like salmon was able to enjoy his meal.  I made this numerous times over the summer on the BBQ and brushed it with Dijon mustard lightly before cooking and double wrapped in foil.

Very tasty but 35 minutes was way too long.  Our salmon came out decidedly over-cooked and rather dry.  4 stars for taste, 1 star for recommended cooking time.

AWESOME!!!! I used a little less oil and a little more fresh lemon juice and then used parchment paper instead of aluminum foil. . . .kinda wrapped them up like Chipotle burritos and they came out so amazingly tender and perfectly cooked!

I make salmon often but this recipe was my favorite so far. I upped the garlic and lemon a bit, but kept the recipe as is. We all loved it and I will make this again. Thank you for the tip!

Usually we grill salmon but it was raining last night so I looked for an alternative and this was great.  After reading some of the other reviews I decided to add about 1/4 C of white wine to marinade and I had fresh basil in my garden so used that instead of dried, the fish was great and moist.  This is a "keeper".

Wow! Excellent recipe, LADYBLADE. I adjusted it for 6 servings. I used all the ingredients as suggested in the recipe, except, my parsley wasn't fresh and I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil. As we all do, I tweaked it with a bit more garlic & lemon juice, but not much. I used frozen Atlantic salmon fillets. I placed them in the glass baking dish, covered them with the marinade. I had to use two glass baking dishes. Then I covered the baking dishes with aluminum foil and placed them in the 375* preheated oven. I cooked them for 40-45 minutes. OMG, the taste was amazing! Whether on a bed of lettuce, white, yellow or brown rice this recipe is a keeper. Thanks, LADYBLADE!

we enjoyed this recipe. I did end up doubling the garlic and didnt noticed. 
Also used dry parsley instead of fresh. 

the flavor was herbal with a touch of lemon.. we found it mild and complementary to the salmon. we served with brown rice and Brussels
sprouts mixed with turkey bacon. Also a spinach side salad. 

very very good!!! a keeper.

This recipe is simple and delicious!!! I would make more marinade because at the end we didn't have that much left for sauce. BTW, put the aluminum foil on the glass dish you are planning to cook in first, then make the marinade in there, then put the salmon in there and marinate in the fridge for 1hr and take it out and just put the dish straight into the oven. Simple, easy, and clean! Less dishes to do :)

Definitely pay attention to the salmon as it's in the oven.. I left it in for the recommended time thinking it would be the right amount (my fault, I know) and the liquid burnt out, and I was left with very dry salmon. :[ So just check on it after 20 or so minutes to see how it's coming along.

Awesome flavor, great recipe... EXCEPT the fish does not need to be cooked for 35-45 mins, 350 oven for 20-25 mins is sufficient couldn't imagine cooking for another 20mins it would be ruined. otherwise will cook again came out great with lower cook time

Very good. I used frozen skinless fillets and it turned out really good I can only imagine if it got to marinade w/out being frozen! Just an FYI using regular olive oil does give a strong taste, but I didn't have any light olive oil so I used what I had.

This was pretty good.  Like others, I didn't go to all of the trouble of making the little foil packages; just put it in a glass baking dish, added the marinade, and covered with foil. Used an Alaska coho filet; reduced the EVOO & salt & upped the lemon juice.  Thanks, Norma!

This is my favorite salmon recipe. You dont even need to measure the ingredients, just throw it all in a ziplock bag, marinate for a little while and bake.

Great recipe!! I too cut the olive oil in half and added dill and only cooked in a glass pan covered in foil for 25min.  I ate mine on a salad with tomatoes, avacado, pomegranite craisins and onion with kraft light raspberry vinagrette dressing.  MMMMM!! Mashed potatoes and steamed carrots and onions on the side.   I will make this again.

Absolutely wonderful fish recipe. I've never reviewed anything before, but this was soo good!! I had to make a comment. I'm not sure if it was because I was hungry, but I've never had salmon like this before. It is by for one of the best salmon I've tasted. Wonderful recipe. I will keep this one, and definitely make it again.

Just made lunch for my boyfriend and he loved it. I didn't have parsley however or lemon so I used rosemary and orange juice in place of them. Turned out wonderful. I do however agree that the amount of oil is a bit much. I doubled the recipe because I was cooking four salmon fillets and they were swimming in oil. I will cook this again and try  using less oil and increasing the amout of juice it calls for.

I made twice as much salmon so I doubled this recipe which was a huge mistake! (I've never made fish before). There was way too much "juice". If you make more than two just stick with the original amount, if you feel that you need more just add a little oil at a time and make sure you drain it before you cook it otherwise it takes about 3 years to cook:)

This is one of the best salmon dishes I’ve ever had!  Being a garlic lover I doubled the garlic – yummy!  I also cut back the olive oil to 4 tbs. and increased the lemon to 2 tbs. – as others recommended.  Instead of baking in foil I broiled uncovered, which was fine, except that my filets were very thick and took about 20 minutes to cook – I almost burned them!  But I didn’t and the fish was wonderful paired with brown rice and steamed broccoli.  A+

Yum!! This was tasty and easy. Cooking it in foil and maranating in the ziploc bag made cleanup easy. Try it!

Great. Simple to prepare. I did cut the calories by using only 1 T. of olive oil and it lost nothing in flavor.

(1/12/13)
For 5 servings I used 5 cloves of garlic and around 1/4 cup olive oil.  I used 1/2 tsp. freshly ground pepper and 1 1/2 tsp. sea salt (any more salt would have been too much).  I used fresh basil instead of dried which is a must!
I will add some fresh dill weed next time, maybe 1-2 tsp.
Some of the salmon were done at 20 minutes and the other were done at 25 (I think the 25 minute salmons were still a little frozen in the middle).  I'd like to try parchment paper next time, or possibly just putting them in a 9x13 covered in foil.

absolutely fabulous! I used extra virgin oil & dried parsley & it came out great. Don't worry about over marinading it. I saved one piece to cook the next day & with over 24 hours in the marinade, it still tasted great.

Yummy!!! I found that it's better to just leave it and bake it in the glass dish, no foil needed if you want your salmon to have a little crisp on top. (It gets too watery if you baked it inside the aluminum foil) but it'll work too depends on your preference. Thanks for sharing this!

Loved it.  Very flavorful and tasty.  I did as the other suggested and only used 1-2 Tablesppons of olive oil.  Even better as leftovers the next day.

I love making this dish!  It's one of my favorites, and it always impresses guests.  I tend to bake the salmon just a tad longer -- about five minutes or so -- because I like my salmon a little crispier.

Excellent dish!!! Absolutely need to reduce the amount of oil, however. One look at the nutrition info and this should be painfully obvious, which I wish I had done before I prepared it with the recommended 6 tbsp of oil (and paid the price later.) I doubled the garlic and added some crushed red pepper, and served with asparagus. I used a fresh Atlantic salmon and it was phenomenal, easily some of the best fish my girlfriend or I had ever eaten.

DELICIOUS!!!  I prepared the marinade and placed the fish in it before leaving for work yesterday.  I really don't have that extra hour after work.  When I arrived home, I placed it in the oven and OH MY!!!  My husband, 2 year old and I absolutely loved it.  I served it with my own confetti rice and steamed broccoli.  It was better than most salmon in top restaurants.  I changed the receipe a little because I think that 6 tbsps of oil is a bit much.  I only used 4 in the marinade and added 2 tbsps on butter when I placed it in the oven.  It was so good that we talked about it for hours AFTER the meal.  Thank you Norma.  This recipe will be used often in our home.

I don't understand all of the great reviews for this recipe.  It was average at best.  This recipe would work just as well, or better, on chicken or pork.  It seemed like a waste of a good piece of salmon

My husband really loved this recipe.  Instead of allowing the salmon to marinate for an hour, I opted to marinate for 4 hours.  Also, since I didn't have fresh parsley, I used 1 tsp of dry parsley.  By the way, if you are on weight watchers, this recipe is 25 pts.

My fiance thought this was great! 
This was easy to make and it's okay not to be very accurate with the amounts of ingredients.  Also, I didn't have lemon juice so I added a bit of apple cider vinegar and red wine instead.  

The first time I made it I had more time to marinate and had all the ingredients - delicious!

Use common sense with cooking time.  Mine was done in 12 minutes on the grill.

This is our new family staple!  We love it.  Thanks.  I did add way less oil and instead of wrapping each fillet individually I just put foil on top of my pyrex dish that I was marinating it in and cooked it like that.  Also, I put it in the crock pot once so it could be ready when we got home and the results were suprisingly good!  Thanks!

For beginners or old hands in the kitchen, this stuff comes out great!  No worries about special or unusual ingredients; it's all normal household stuff, and they blend really well with the fish.  I've never been a huge fan of salmon, but I'll be making this again!
(and if you're really pressed for time, I marinated for only 1/2 hour, and cooked at 400 for 30+ minutes).  Excellent.

I will start out by saying that I am not a big fan of fish in general but this recipe was Simple and PERFECT!!  I didn't use the measures but rather added ingredients by eye and I didn't have parsley so I used herbs de provance.  At the end, when the fish was pretty much done, I opened up the salmon so it could brown and it gave it that perfect crispy finish on the outside.  I also used quite a bit of oil so it would create a sauce and used that to pour over the pasta that I made to go with it (adding sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, mushrooms and flax seeds),some nice steamed broccoli and et voilà, wonderful Mediterranean meal in the middle of winter in a Bavarian forest!  :D

Very tasty recipe that you can modify the herbs to your liking. I added dried dill on top of the other herbs and i reduced the salt(Sea salt) to 3/4 tsp . I marinated 4 frozen wild salmon fillets for 3 hrs And baked them in the oven on a bed of fennel,onion and zucchini. It was superb and my young kids enjoyed it :-)

YUMMY!  I liked it as is, but liked it even more when I reduced the oil to 4 tablespoons, I used thin fillets, and baked for 15-20 min at 400 in the marinade.  I added some chopped green onion and blanketed the salmon with lemon slices...I think these changes sent it over the edge of good to great.

This was my first time attempting salmon, and it was delicious!  The only reason why I'm rating it 4 stars is because I checked it after 25 minutes, and it was done, and even a little over cooked.  I think 20 minutes would have been perfect.  Maybe my pieces were smaller?

Either way, it turned out great!

Easy and fabulous.  Did cut the oil in half, but otherwise followed the recipe.  A keeper, will definitely make again and again.

Yes! This is really fabulous. My family's new favorite salmon recipe. We have a bunch of fresh caught humpy salmon. I just cut the whole (gutted of course) fish into large pieces and put in ziploc bag with marinade for about 4 hours and then baked. Wonderful flavor, but not too overpowering. I want to taste the salmon too! Next time I'll likely try to marinade 6 or 8 hours and see what the difference is.

Made exactly as written except 1) used dried parsley 2) did as another reviewer suggested and baked in a covered dish.  Family loved it and asked me to make it again.  Some reviewers noted there was too much oil, but my husband, who does not like a lot of oil said it was perfect and it made a great extra sauce to drizzle over the brusel sprouts and rice.  I used a large salmon filet and had half left over and it reheated two nights later wonderfully because of the extra sauce and rice.

My family really liked this dish. It was simple to make and tasted delicious. Be sure not to overcook and keep temp between 350 and 375 - no higher.
It was so juicy and smelled great.

This recipe is an excellent marinade for salmon.  It is very tasty.  I need to incorporate more salmon into my diet because I am Vitamin D deficient.  Salmon is one of the few natural sources of Vitamin D and this marinade has really helped me with that.  It covers up the taste that usually makes me cringe.

This is the BEST recipe that I have for salmon! I've tried different recipes on this site but this is the best one for my taste. Even my mom loved it and she is very picky with spices. Very easy to make and I will make it again and again!

This is absolutely delicious. It's my favorite dish to make. It doesn't taste fishy at all.  Cut the fillet you get from the store in half, and marinate in separate tupperware containers (this means you'll half the ingredients for the marinade and put that amount in each container). I marinade for an hour on one side, then flip and marinade for an hour on the other. They turn out PERFECT every time! GREAT recipe!

I prepared this dish for Christmas Eve.  Fabulous!  I'd forgotten to buy fresh parsley, so just sprinkled on some parsley flakes.  An excellent meal.  I served this with a mixture of white and wild rice.  Will definitely make this again.

Good and easy....I marinate the salmon in a plastic resealable bag then put fish in a lightly greased baking dish and cover the baking dish with foil.

Meh. It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste that good either. I honestly can't tell much of a difference from if I had just cooked the salmon on its own (with no seasoning). Won't be using this again.

Maybe it was me, but I cut the cooking time to 20 min and my salmon was still so dry and overdone.  Rule of thumb for fish is 10 min cooking for each 1 inch of fish, measured at the thickest part. I can't imagine how anyone could cook a 6 oz salmon fillet for 45 min and have it at all edible!! Was not impressed with the flavor of the marinade either. Barely noticeable on the fish.  I'm not a huge salmon fan but I've had salmon that is moist, tender and flavorful - this cooking method won't produce that effect.  Will keep searching for a good recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written.  The only change I would make next time is to decrease the amount of dried basil - it was a bit overpowering.  Great recipe though!

I doubled the garlic, used 2 Tablespoons olive oil and halved the salt and pepper, on the advice of a lot of reviewers. With these changes this recipe is a five star.

I loved this recipe. I tweaked it a bit but speading a thin coat of a may mixture (1Tb mayo, 1tp dill, 1tp minced garlic), and finish with a sprinkle of paparika, and fresh parsley. My fiance absolutely LOVED it, and has never been a big fish eater. Thanks Ladyblade!

My husband complimented me on this salmon without me even having to ask. That's a good sign. The only change I made was to simply put the salmon in the oven straight out of the fridge. I just left it in the glass dish covered with aluminum foil.

It's very easy to prepare and tastes good so I have made this so many times over the past years (probably more than 5 years)that I don't even remember.  But over the years, I learned to adjust to the following:  use 50% of the salt, double the garlic (we love garlic) and use 2 Table spoons of olive oil.  I also serve this over rice.  Families and friends like it.

This is our favorite salmon recipe.  It's great!  Don't skip the one hour marinading time - the flavor is much better if you leave it the whole hour (or longer).

This recipe is excellent.  The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because it's too salty.  So I used 1/4 teaspoon salt the next time I made it and it turned out perfect.

I made this recipe at my boyfriend's and it was DELICIOUS! However, being health conscious we cringed at the 6 tablespoons of oil and the amount of sodium listed in the nutrition facts. A few suggestions I followed after reading the reviews was: I left out the salt, didn't marinate it, and reduced the cooking time. I used 1 1/2 tbs of Canola oil instead of the 6 tbs of olive oil and we placed it in foil, wrapped it up and baked it in the toaster oven for 25 minutes. It was moist and juicy with TONS of flavor! There is NO need to marinate this recipe because it turns out very flavorful as is. It's hard to find healthy recipes that are EASY to make and tastes great. With a few adjustments, this can be very healthy! It's one of our favorite fish recipes.

I will cut the salt amount in half next time.  I also used three cloves of garlic, and thought it could use a little more.  All in all, tasty.

I made this recipe last night for a friend's daughter's wedding---for 50 people!  I made the salmon up the day before, in foil packages with about 5 peieces in each, cooking it about 10 minutes less than called for in the recipe. After it baked and cooled, I refrigerated it, in the packages.  At the reception, I reheated it, in the packages (on a cookie sheet) at 350 for about 10 minutes, then put it out in steam table/chafing dish pans on the buffet.  So simple to do and it seemed so elegant as well!  I made brought extra marinade to put over it on the steam tble, but there was plenty in the packages ehen I opened them, so I didn't need the extra.  THANKS!

Wonderful!  I lined a large pan with heavy duty foil, placed the salmon in the dish and then poured the marinade over the salmon.  Flipped salmon over (skin side up) to marinate in refrigerator.  After marinating, flipped salmon back over and cooked the salmon in the marinade.  I poured off a bit of the sauce before serving.

I love salmon but this didn't tingle the taste buds as I expected.  I saw all the great reviews and thought it would be wonderful.  This did taste a little bland and not very flavorful.  The salmon did come out very moist and not at all over cooked....hence the 4 star rating.  I think I may try to spice this up a bit more.  Thanks for posting.

This was fabulous!  I use a large salmon steak and cook it on the grill in a barbeque basket.  Placed on a platter with garnish it makes a wonderful presentation.  It is a great dish for guests...simple preparation, quick cook time, and beautiful to serve.

This was delightful.  Baking the salmon in the foil packet steams the fish beautifully.  It just melts in your mouth and the marinade is a superb blend of seasonings.  This is one of the best ways I have found to cook fish without it being either overdone or under done.

My husband gaved this recipe an A+. Throughout the meal and after, he couldn't stop talking about how flavorful it was. Served it with sides of rice and lima beans. I cooked the salmon for 30 minutes and it was perfect. I also used the aluminum foil baking method (I think the steaming makes it more tender) and, as another reader suggested, I added a couple of thin lemon slices to the top of each filet. Delicious and so simple!

I made this for dinner and my husband, who is a big fish eater said it was the best salmon he had ever tasted.  He also said I need to make sure I keep the recipe :) 
It was so easy and quick to prepare and the flavor was delicious. The fish was also very tender and moist.

The recipe is okay, but it just doesn't do it for me.  I was very reluctant to pepper a salmon, but I did anyway.  Pepper, for salmon (and for most fish) IMO, is just too strong.  After adding all the herbs, I think they just killed the flavor.  Salmon is wonderfully flavorful to me, and I thought about not adding all the herbs, but I did anyway.  The recipe I learned from my teenage friends a long time ago after living on the West Coast was much simpler.  For my long time recipe, I just put softened butter all over the salmon, use a heavy sprinkling of parsley all over the meat, lemon squeezed all over the salmon, and put it in foil, close it, bake it for 20-30 minutes (depending on the thickness).  It turns out wonderfully flavorful and everyone is thrilled with it.  No family compliments on this recipe.  I will go back to my own recipe on salmon.

The herbs were a little bit too much but otherwise it was good. Next time I will reduce the herbs a bit so it's not overpowering the taste of the fish.

YUM!!! I am new to cooking and didn't have a lot of faith that this dish was going to be good ( trying dishes with high stars), but this was unbelievably good! I accidentally bought too much fish - but there was not a single piece left. In fact my 7 year old asked for more and was disappointed that it was all gone. We are not big fish eaters - but will be now!

This really was exceptional! Both my husband and I LOVED it. I decided to try and keep it as close to the original as possible the first time. The only thing I changed was reduced the olive oil to 4T and just used salt and pepper to taste. I cooked the salmon for only 20 minutes. I did what another reviewer suggested and cooked at 350 for around 15 minutes then took off the foil and turned it to broil for another 5 minutes. The results were fantastic! It was so moist and the skin and garlic was slightly crispy and oh so delicious. We will definitely making this again and again.

This was fine, but I'd agree with others that it only takes 20 or 25 minutes at 375.  Also, it probably doesn't need the salt or as much oil, and is maybe more tasty with either tarragon or dill instead of basil on the fish.  When you have a leftover piece, the tarragon or dill flavor is very good for a salmon patty or a salmon soup.

Top recipe with changes. I used 1 large fillet about 2 lbs. Cut back on oil. Used 4/5 garlic cloves and added more lemon juice to marinade. Thinly sliced lemon and arranged on top of fillet. I have never marinated salmon longer than 20 minutes and it is always delicious. Cooked in glass dish covered with foil for 30 minutes.

Outstanding, simple salmon. I often don't have time to marinate before cooking but it still turns out great. Marinating makes it even better. I do cut back on the oil a little.

Absolutely AMAZING! Currently, I'm 6 months pregnant and it's hitting the spot. I also marinated my salmon for closer to 12 hours rather than just one.

Too much oil and too much salt & pepper.  Otherwise, would have been a 5 star recipe!  I used a different recipe for some salmon out of the same bag (frozen fillets) and it did taste fishy.  This wasn't fishy at all.  I cooked til they looked done and they were great.

Overall, very tasty.  My husband even liked it, and he doesn't like fish (because it usually has a fishy taste). I removed the skin before marinating, and it really cut down on the fishy taste.  In an effort to be healthier, I cut the olive oil down to 2 Tbsp; however, the fish was too dry.  Next time, I increased it to 3 Tbsp, and increased the lemon juice to 2 Tbsp, and it was much better.  I could hardly taste the lemon, so I think I'll add lemon slices on top of the fish while baking, like another reviewer recommended.

Use less olive oil and more lemon juice. Top with lemon slices. Bake at 475 for 5 min per inch of thickness (maybe 5 min more). Take skin off before marinading. Best fish I've ever had!!

This recipe is worth the hype! I have made it 3 times in 4 weeks and my family still loves it. I have substituted dried herbs for fresh but otherwise left it the same. Sometimes I double the recipe and use it for sauce over rice. Delicious! Thank you!

As a pickier fish eater, I wanted to get more heart-healthy (wild-caught) salmon into my diet, so was looking for an easy, straightforward baked salmon recipe (preferably more savory than sweet, e.g. teriyaki-flavored). This was the first one that I found on Allrecipes.com, so I decided to give it a go. This recipe is fantastic, and so incredibly easy! I slightly altered the ingredient measurements to taste, and added some fresh chopped dill (dried dill will do in a pinch) and covered the entire dish with foil (instead of individually wrapping) as other reviewers suggested. Also, I found that marinating the filets longer than an hour did not adversely affect the taste or the final product at all (it likely improved it.) The flavors meld so wonderfully together and create a fantastic topping and marinade for the salmon. Thanks for providing! This is a definite keeper!

Easy and delicious and my kids love it!  I decreased the oil by a couple of tablespoons and baked it in a low casserole covered with foil.  I will try more fresh herbs instead of dried when they are ready in my garden!  Yummy!

I made the following changes (3 T. olive oil, 3/4 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 T fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp dried parsley, dash of dill weed) and it was so so good. The marinade smelled divine. This was my first time making salmon and I will make this recipe again. I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli, and I felt good eating it =) Thanks!

I omitted the garlic and parsley because my husband and I aren't big fans, but everything still worked out great! I substituted dried basil for an "herbs de provence" (rosemary, basil, thyme, organo) spice mixture. Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing. ;)

This is a new staple in our house!  I agree with another recent review... that much oil is not necessary.  It's no big deal, though, you just leave it in the foil! :) I did not marinade mine long (maybe 1/2 an hour), and it still was very good.  Thanks for sharing!

WAAAAAY too much salt is called for in this recipe.  It was almost un-edible.  I would cut the salt almost completely if I made this again... though I would search for a different recipe before returning to this one

Very flavorful and super easy!! Instead of marinating in a pan then wrapping in foil--I just marinated in pan, left in pan, covered with foil, stuck pan in the oven and then turned it on. Had to bake a few mins longer, but totally worth it!

OH...MY...GOD!!! I have never made salmon (or any fish) before and was very nervous to try. I'm definitely not someone who cooks on a regular basis, but this was SO easy, so affordable (I had everything but the salmon & parsley) and absolutely the BEST salmon I have ever had (including restaurants). I was a little low on the olive oil so I included some melted butter - this made it nice and pasty when it came time to transfer to the foil packets. I also added a little bit of dill seasoning. Hands down - the most amazing salmon dish ever! I will definitely be making again - the hubby raved about it! Thank you for this recipe!

Awesome, easy, and looks elegant with the parsley! Next time I will cut back on the salt by at least 1/4, maybe 1/2. This is my new "go to" salmon recipe.

WAY TOO MUCH OLIVE OIL. I think half the amount would have been fine. I marinated mine for 2 hours in a pyrex dish covered with foil, then stuck it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. I took off the foil and let the top brown for a few minutes. Flavor was pretty good, but subtle. I also did not like that the garlic was still a bit crunchy. I probably won't make this again.

Everyone absolutely loved it! I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out perfect! If I could change anything, I would have added a smidge less olive oil. I found that it was a little too greasy. Other than that, easy and delicious!

This was fabulous!! One I will make again and again. Just got back from fishing trip and we caught 200 lbs of King Salmon!!! Thanks for the recipe.  I did use lime instead of lemon and used fresh basil and more of each. Did not have the fresh parsley but i think the fresh basil made up for it. Cilantro might be good too.

This is a wonderful dish to make and vey much a kid friendly one at that.
I ommited the parsely and added fresh Italian Basil at 2 heaped tsp. Also I put the marinade and the salmon steaks directly into a glass ovenware dish and covered with foil, making sure the aluminium didn't touch the fish. I baj=ked as directed but 5 mins before serving I uncovered and allowed th etops to crisp and brown ever so lightly- the result was fantastic. Thank you for a great simple dish!

I did a little twist and it was brilliant.

I added some chopped fresh Rosemary, a teaspoon of dill and a teaspoon of minced ginger, reduced the oil by a half and added a third butter. Served with a Greek Salad it turned out a Mediteranean dinner.

Wow, this came out amazing. The guests were all raving about how perfect the salmon was. The party was a buffet setup and so I used 2 5lb whole fillets. The fillets were baked for about 30 minutes and were perfectly done. Definitely a keeper!

Yummy!  Doubled the recipe and used lime instead of lemon. Left in marinade for a day and a half before cooking. Family loved it! And the cold left overs were even better.

This is such a versatile recipe.  I was looking for something to do with some steelhead and this fit the bill with a few minor adjustments.  First off, 6 tablespoons of olive oil is WAY too much for only 12 oz of fish.  I cut it down to 2 tbls. and it was plenty.  I used dill weed instead of basil, only because I wanted that flavor, and left out the parsley because I didn't have any.  I also didn't wrap this in foil.  After marinading for about 1/2 hr (in my vacuum sealed marinader), I put it in a baking dish, poured the liquid on to and baked it (uncovered) in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes.  It came out perfect.

My goodness this was great! As part of trying to eat healthier, thought we should have some salmon. I don't really care for it, but I'll eat it. This was so good, I ate all of mine and I could see hubby checking to see if I would, so he could scoop it up. No Way!! I think we'll be having salmon once a week (at least lol). Do try this one, it's great!

35 minutes was a little to long for my piece of salmon, so if you don't have a real thick piece, you might want to cut back on the time. It had pretty good flavor.  I enjoyed it.

Really delicious, easy and room for variations.  I have actually made this without the lemon - was out and it was STILL excellent!  Kids gobbled it up :) - both world famous food critics too!!

Excellent recipe, few ingredients that give great flavor.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried chives and the salmon looked and smelled great.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

I bought a GIGANTIC hunk of salmon and didn't want to ruin it. I followed this recipe almost exactly since I had more than just 12 ounces of salmon, i had more like 2 pounds!  My only suggestion to make clean-up a breeze is to roll out tin foil over your glass dish, set the salmon on top, fold the foil up at the edges, and then pour the marinade in and wrap. Then you can just marinate it like that for however you like. ( I also put lemon slices on top)  It's delicious and incredibly moist, and I used leftovers for salmon/cream cheese toasts in the morning> DELISH!

I don't eat seafood, so the review is really from my family.  I didn't have time to marinate the fish.  I followed the recipe with the exception of just putting the fillets in a Pyrex baking dish, covering with the liquid and covering tightly with foil.  Super easy to make, and my family loved it.

This is mouth watering way to fix salmon. The salmon stays very moist.  I didn't have light olive oil so I use 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 vegetable oil.  This makes enough for marinade for 1 lb. of salmon filets. For the last few minutes I remove the foil and place under the broiler.  Serve with baked sweet potatoes and a vegetable or salad.

Love this recipe.  The only thing I did differently is added a little bit of onion powder, Old Bay and diced up fresh chives.

after reading the reviews i decreased the oil to 2 Tb, increased the lemon juice to 3 Tb, marinated the fish in the same glass baking dish i planned to cook it in, then i broiled it on high for 6 mins each side. i will make this again with the changes i made because it is very quick, easy, and healthy. served these with zucchini "crab" cakes from this site and rice pilaf with spinach. hubby loved this dinner

My 11 year old son said this is the best salmon he ever had and he loves salmon!! The flavor was very good. I used a whole frozen salmon fillet and it came out with a nice firm texture. I will use this marinade again.

I dusted the fish with a few pinches of Old Bay seafood rub just before adding the marinade and sealing up the foil.  When i opened it up it was just glistening and golden.

The flavors were really good except it was way too salty.  My husband took one bite and refused to eat the rest.  Will make again but will decrease the salt to a pinch next time.  Also, I baked in a glass baking dish covered with foil at 400 for 20 minutes and it turned out great.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was amazing! it was so easy, and I was able to use ingredients I already had in the house. The flavor was so good! We've always grilled salmon, and I was afraid to try baking it. But this was just as good if not better. I used the recipe exactly as is except I didn't have fresh parsley to sprinkle on top. I bought a bag of Kirkland brand sockey salmon filets at Costco, so this will definitely be a regular addition to our dinner plans.

This recipe was SO good! My parents (who don't even like salmon) both loved it. I cut back the oil in the marinade to 4 tbsp and increased the lemon juice to 2 tbsp like a lot of other people. I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top for the last 10 or so minutes of baking. It was delicious!

I don't just want to be just another person raving about this recipe so I'll tell you why we loved it. The fish comes out very moist and tender and of course full of flavor. Changes I made were for lack of other ingredients i.e. I used 1/2t dried thyme in addition to the other called for spices, wayyyy less olive oil, and only added the lime (had no lemons) juice before cooking. I also had 2 lbs of salmon so I increased the garlic which I grated for more intense flavor and also baked it in a glass dish covered with foil. If your fish is thin you have to cook it less, mine was thick but thin along the side so I folded the thin side under for more even cooking. It is one of the best salmon recipes ever.

This was good.  My fillet pieces where smaller so I think the cooking time needed to be cut back.  The end result was not a flaky but almost mushy.  Next time I will use less olive and only marinate for 1/2 hour.  To reduce the fishy taste/smell I removed the skin before baking.  Our family eats salmon every week so I will continue to try other salmon recipes looking for the "one".

Really good recipe! I love fish cooked pretty much in any way and me and my husband really enjoyed this one, but with a few changes, and that's why i didn't give it 5 stars. I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions, less salt (half the amount), more lemon (3tbsp), 2tbsp of olive oil and 1 of butter (perfect amount) used 2 teaspoons of dry parsley cause i didn't have it fresh, and didn't add dill as other reviewers suggested because i didn't have any. As far as taste goes, excellent, but i cooked our fish (2 40z fillets) for 20 minutes (15 covered and 5 uncovered) and they were way too cooked for us... Maybe with 6oz fillets it would have been fine, i would still try a little less, but i do like the uncovering the fish for the last few minutes in the broiler because it cooks the garlic on top and everything has a better color. I made bowtie pasta and cooked it with some green beans (cut into small pieces 1/2 inch) and a couple of cubes of chicken bouillon, and when this was cooked, i drained the water, added some butter and lemon juice, and served the fish on top of the pasta, with the "sauce" from the fish all over. We really really enjoyed it aside from the fact that it was somewhat overcooked, and we thought it would be real good also with some asparagus instead of the green beans (didn't have them).

My husband and I really enjoyed this salmon recipe.  (It was even worth the trouble it took for me to skin the salmon -- flashbacks to high school biology class were *not* helping there!).  Like several other reviewers, I ended up marinating and cooking the salmon in the same glass baking dish covered with foil.  I think marinating the salmon for the entire hour was worth the wait;  the flavor was extraordinary!  I also added dill and a touch of paprika to the marinade.  The dill flavor was an excellent complement to the fish;  I think I would have missed its flavor had I not added it.  Overall, a delicious recipe, and one I will likely make again!

AB-FAB!!!! I followed the recipe for ingredients, but 'eyeballed' the oil because the other reviewers said it was too much.  I did NOT marinate (didn't have time), put the salmon (a 1.3lb filet) in a foil lined pan, put the ingredients on the salmon- 3 pats of butter on top- slices of lemon over that and covered the baking dish with foil and threw it in the oven for 30 mins.  DELCIOUS!!!!!!!  TOTAL 5 starts from DH- that's actually pretty rare!  Thanks for this great recipe!

simple but tastes good. i suggest that the marinating be limited to 30 minutes only. it will make fish tough if marinated for more than 30 mins

Well I decided to do this one because of the great reviews.. Honestly I couldn't see the big deal about it.. Nothing special. Still there was nothing wrong.. I followed the tips mentioned by other people. All in all, I don't think I'm gonna do this again, simply because I've done better (recipes from this website).

this recipe is amazing! this was my first time making salmon and it was delicious. All I changed was the marinade time to 30min, the bake time to 30min, add a little dill, more lemon juice less oil and a ton of garlic- yummy!

Saved this recipe 2 yrs. ago but it's only now that I tried it.  The basic recipe was good, I just added some ingredients, like 1/2 tsp grated ginger to help remove the "fishy taste", and light soy sauce (equal parts with lemon juice).  Turned out pretty well, my guests loved it!!  What I also do before mixing in the olive oil, is tasting the marinade first to make sure you get the right flavor.  I also used ziploc bag instead.

This recipe was excellent! Due to time constraints, I didn't marinade the salmon, but I did use the listed ingredients (with a little extra garlic) to put over the salmon before I baked it. It was really good and very flavorful. Excellent!

Fantastic!  Very easy.  I only left me salmon in for 23 minutes and it turned out perfect.  If i would of left it in longer i think it might of been over cooked! loved it!

Like many other ladies, I have a very picky husband. When I told him I was making salmon, he krinkled his nose at the thought. After I cooked it, he loved it. I did not have fresh parsley so I used dried. Everything was great.

I make this dish all the time.  I always head to Sam's Club and just buy the big pack of salmon.  Store it in the freezer, and make the salmon whenever I want.  It's incredibly simple and tasty.  Except my preference for the cooking time is shorter than listed.  At max, cooking time is 15 minutes for my fish.  But I love it and I hope you do too!

Amazing.  Had a HUGE piece of salmon for my boyfriend and I. Doubled the marinade, and cooked it in the glass dish (no need to use the tin foil).  So flavorful, but not overpowering.  My boyfriend absolutely raved about it and that HUGE salmon was gone in one meal.  The best way to prepare salmon hands down.

My boyfriend is a professional chef and rarely comments on food (especially when I cook), but after eating this dish he asked for the recipe!  Super easy and super tasty!!!  I'll make it often!

Loved it...my wife also loved it. I added 2 tbsps more lime juice.  I also added 2 tbsps of melted butter. After adding the marinade, I sprinkled lemon peel to the salmon.  Next time, I might add some capers. I will definately make it again.

My husband and my extremely picky children just LOVED this recipe.  I used garlic powder because I didn't have minced garlic. 2Tbls of oil and 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/4 cup of white wine.  I found out that Salmon is a "fishy" tasting fish.  A word of warning to you that don't like Tuna...stay away from this recipe.  Salmon is a richer tasting tuna!  I don't want to discourage those of you that do like it...My husband thought it taste so incredible.  He said it was the best salmon he had ever had!

This was excellent!  I cut out the salt entirely, and used fresh basil and oregano along with the parsley.  Marinated it skin side up for about an hour, and then finished it (in the foil packet) on the grill instead of in the oven.  Very tasty, and one we will definitely have again.

This was very good - not eye popping fantastic, but very good.  I too used 4 tbsp of oil and 2 tbsp of lemon juice.  Next time I would use only 1/2 tsp of salt & pepper (although in my husband's opinion it could use MORE pepper... depends on what you like).

I just dumped everything in a Ziploc and smelled it.  I could tell it needed something, so I added some lite soy sauce, brandy, a little brown sugar, and a little molasses.  It smelled much better so I added the salmon to the bag.  I only cooked it about 25 minutes in a preheated oven and it was done to perfection.  A good base recipe to build on.

Amazing! The only changes I made was 3T oil + 3T butter. I used dried parsely instead of fresh and I marinated and baked in the same glass dish with foil covering it. It was so delicious! This was the first time I had EVER made salmon and I don't think I even want to try any other recipes! This was tender, moist....perfect! Thanks!

I made this recipe for just last week and it was wonderful.  I am now making it again for mother and mother in law for Mother's Day and I know that they will enjoy it just as much as I did.  I do agree with the other viewers regarding changing the olive oil and the lemon juice. I also marinated this in a ziploc bag, which makes clean-up very easy.  Thanks again for a wonderful recipe!!!!!

I have to agree with Teacozy.  I too absolutely love the flavor of salmon which may be why this wasn't my favorite recipe.  It was quite good but the garlic and other flavorings were overpowering.  I think I'll stick with melted butter and bay seasoning so the salmon taste really comes through.  But I will check out the mustard and pecan recipe!

First of all, let me say that I LOVE salmon and eat it about once/week, both for health reasons and I love the taste.  I was looking for an alternate recipe as I didn't want my family to become bored with our favorite Salmon with Honey Mustard and Pecans found on this site. I had high hopes for this recipe with the many positive reviews but I was very disappointed.  I feel that the herbs were very overpowering and didn't enhance the flavor of the fish. My family liked it a little more than I did but not as much as our favorite, which I will stick with.

This recipe for baked salmon is great!  It was so easy, and it looked and tasted very good.  I would definitely use light olive oil because reg, olive oil can be a bit heavy.  AWESOME recipe!

This recipe is so yummy! It tasted like I had gone to a very expensive restaurant. My husband absolutely loved it and almost ate half of an 11lb. salmon in one seating! The only thing I would change next time is I would only use 3/4 of the recommended salt but other than that it's perfect!!

I wanted so badly to make salmon for dinner but my husband was as unenthusiastic as you can get.  He told me to make sure I also brought home tartar sauce because he claimed he couldn't eat fish without it.  But when he tasted this salmon he couldn't stop telling me how good it was.  When I offered him the tartar sauce he said that he didn't need it.  The flavor of the salmon was perfect as it was.  That jar of tartar sauce is still unopened.  Thank you Norma!

This was nice, but I felt the salmon got a touch mushy. Perhaps it was because I added a little extra lemon juice. I also cut the oil down to 4 Tbsps and it could have been cut to 3, probably. I might try this again, but it wasn't that impressive - the best part was not having to clean the baking dish that was lined with tin foil!

This was the BEST salmon I have ever eaten!!  I didn't marinate for the entire time suggested and it still was very flavorful with just the right balance of tang from the lemon juice, and heat from the cracked black pepper.  The fish was done just right:  very moist and succulent. It was very easy to prepare (using common ingredients most folks have on hand) and clean-up was a breeze because of the foil.  Thanks for sharing, Norma...this is the ONLY way I'll prepare salmon from now on!

My three year old loved it!  She ate most of mine and when it was gone she wanted more.  And... my husband felt "healthy cooking" was well worth it with a recipe like this.  Really!  He even commented that this would be a good meal to make when we entertained friends!  That's a five star in my book.

Awesome!  It was quick and easy.  My wife isn't a big fish eater, but the flavor of the garlic and olive oil accented the salmon flavor, perfectly.

Here are my suggestions
1) use less oil..many cut oil to 2-3T
2) many increased lemon juice ...I use 2T to 3T. I use 2 ish T.
3) Salt ..many cut salt to  1/2t.  or 1t.  I use 3/4 KOSHER salt.
3) many added dill..so do I...appx 2 small pinches
4) I NEVER use foil with lemon b/c lemon does react with Aluminum. ( foil or pans) If you really want steamed or poached fish then use parchment packets. BUT baking in a glass or ceremic dish cover will achieve the same results
5) Cook time is way off in my opinion. (and opinion of many others) Do 20 min max. I much prefer baked open over cover and steam method.
6) By all means make extra....then crumble left over salamon over lettace that is spread out on a plate. Top w/ thin slices red onion and thinly sliced cucumbers . Evenly dot with a mixture of  a little mayo ( 1/4 to 1/3 C.)  or yogurt and  few pinches dill & pinch of S & P  .Add another layer if you have enough. Cover with just a few more lettace leaves Cover  the plate w/ plastic wrap. The onion & cucumber will " draw" out their juices into mayo /dill mix and make a FANTASTIC salad by lunch or dinner the next day.  You will be amazed at how this cuts down on snack attacks later ..

Very tasty and easy.I baked the salmon, uncovered,at 400 for 15 min and it was perfect. I also reduced the oil and added some melted butter and a dash of dill. Will definitely make again.

as is the recipe was not great and way to much oil so I can't give it 5 star,  but by following another review and making again I found a 5 star favorite.
2 T. olive oil, 1 T. melted butter, 3/4 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 T lemon juice, 1 tsp dried parsley, dash of dill weed.

This is my absolute favorite salmon -- or any fish -- recipe!  Very easy, so moist, incredibly delicious -- and even the leftovers rock!  I always double the recipe so we have leftovers, but I don't change anything about the recipe.

I used a little less pepper and I cooked it at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  It was perfect!  I served it on a bed of spring mix lettuce greens with balsamic vinegar dressing.  I loved the simplicity of the flavors.

The recipe, as written, leaves the fish overcooked, oversalted, over-peppered and overly oily. However, the ingredients listed are some of my favorites for salmon. SO, yesterday, when I found my grocery store had large salmon filets on sale, I decided to try it again, with adjustments. I used 1.5 Tbs parseley, 1 tsp dill, 3 cloves of garlic smashed with 1/2 tsp salt, 1.5 tsp dijon mustard, 1/8 tsp pepper, 2 Tbs white wine, 1 Tbs lemon juice and only 2 Tbs (1/8 c) olive oil. I also decided to add 1 med green onion, chopped finely. I mixed all of the ingredients, poured/patted it over the top of the salmon, then let it sit in the fridge for about an hour or so until dinner time. I placed a a few thin slices of lemon down the length of the filet and put it into a 450 degree oven (in an oiled pan!) for about 25-30 minutes (the majority of the filet was a little over an inch thick). It was moist and very flavorful. Thanks for the "bones" of a delicious salmon marinade.

I multiplied this recipe by 1.5 because we had an additional salmon filet. The recipe was delicious! I made a couple changes: I too thought that there was way too much olive oil! In the future, I will cut down to probably about half of the amount recommended. I didn't do the foil packet method, rather I left the filets in the glass dish that I marinated them in and covered with foil (so much less work!!) and that turned out great. I would make again just with less olive oil next time. Great, super easy and quick recipe for the family dinner!

Awesome! Stumbled across this recipe right before making it so I did not have time to marinade but wanted to make it anyway. Instead of marinating I just massaged the mixture into the skin and also just stuck it in a casserole disk with foil over top, so I could spoon the mixture back on throughout cooking and it was wonderful! I can't imagine how much better it could be if I had time to marinade!

This is great for when it's too cold outside to fire up the grill. I make this a bunch and it's evolved slightly. The first time I made it, the only thing I changed was to marinate the salmon in the foil packets to begin with, and they came out wonderful and very flavorful. Now, I marinate in the foil, don't use any oil at all except to sprits the foil with to make it non-stick, and use slices of lemon instead of juice set on top. I put the packets together in the morning, let them sit all day and then bake and they taste wonderful. I usually serve with asparagus, yellow squash, and salad for a great and relatively healthy meal! Thanks!

Fantastic!  I very rarely give a recipe a 5, but this one deserves it. Even my two older "we don't eat any fish but tuna from a can" daughters loved it and asked for more.  Even better cold the next day.

I have been known as hating fish, but I have started making myself eat it as I know it is good for me.  Using this recipe was my first at making a fish dish (my husband normally grills it).  I have now made this a number of times and actually really enjoy it!  My tweaks include: 3 gloves garlic, 4 T olive oil, 1tsp basil, no salt, 1tsp pepper, 2T lemon juice and 1/2 tsp parsley.  Both my husband and kids love it and I make this almost every week! Thanks Ladyblade!:-)

I first used this recipe when I was in college, sometime between 1998 and 2001. It's 2012...and I'm still using this recipe. I used it exactly, but with my children now, I change up the procedure in just a most simple way: I lay the fish scales side up, while the fish is marinating, so that the "meat" can receive full flavor. When it's time to bake, I bake scales-side-down, so that now the bottom of the fish gets the benefits of cooking in the herbs and oil. What I no longer do is add the remaining marinade when I transfer the fish to the foil; I transfer the fish to the foil, wrap it up scales-side-down and just bake it. (Otherwise, my little ones say it's too salty.)

Definitely a perfect choice for a first fish dish! Made the changes as recommended by GAYLAF and I left out the dried basil and increased the amount of fresh parsley used.
I think the temp of baking depends on your oven; BF has a reeeaally small oven so I had it baked at 200 degree C. Salmon was loosely wrapped in foil and baked for 40 mins, followed by opening up the foil and baked for another 10 mins. Salmon was moist and well marinated! Definitely gonna do this dish again!

Easy to make and tasted great.  Didn't have time to marinade, but still came out of oven very juicy after 40 mins, just right level of cooked without being dry.  Baked for 40 minutes and comes out very moist.  I used about half the recommended pepper, doubled the chopped parsley (used dried) and used a table spoon of chopped garlic as my family loves garlic.  Definitely a repeat.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could ;)

I personally don't like salmon, but I cook it for my husband. He says (and he's pretty picky!) that he loves this recipe! Instead of fresh parsley I use 1 tsp of dried parsley! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The first time we made this we liked the taste, but it was definitely on the salty side.  We have since cut the salt in half and it comes out perfect every time!

I've made this several times now and my husband and I always enjoy it. I use fresh dill instead of basil and omit the parsley and it is absolutely delicious! I try to prepare salmon in different ways but once I made this it's the only way my husband wants it and that's fine by me because it's so easy. Thanks for sharing!

It was delicious! Next time I will probably use one less tbsp of olive oil, like someone suggested, but even so, we loved it! (Even my future mother in law wanted the recipe! - and she's a picky eater!) 
Definitely doing this recipe again!

Oh man, this was amazing. I'm glad to find a salmon recipe that doesn't have soy sauce in the marinade. The only thing we changed was we only used about 3 1/2 tbs. oil. The cook time is perfect. it was like cutting into butter and the salmon was so juicy. MMM!!

The marinade calls for too much oil and even after halving the salt, the result is too salty.

I'm giving this four stars because I also made some changes. I lined the baking dish with foil, but did not seal it; I left it open. I reduced the oil a bit and used dill instead of basil. But the result was astonishing. My husband and I are both originally from the Pacific NW, and grew up loving salmon. I can only get frozen Chilean farmed salmon here in Mexico, and it is not as fatty as wild salmon, so it often turns out dry.  Cooking it this way makes it moist and succulent. We both agreed that this is the ONLY way I'll cook salmon from now on. AND - it's healthy! Thanks, Ladyblade!

Delicious!  Didn't have time to marinate, so I just sprinkled the spices on both sides and punctured the filet with a knife so that it would be infused with the lemon juice when I poured it on.  I'm sure it would have been even better if I had marinated it!

I have made this recipe several times now and it is always a hit!  I do not change anything, as I have never made salmon prior to this recipe.  I haven't looked for another one after finding this one.  5 stars from me.  Foil is a must!

I love salmon and cook it often.  This is very good.  I did not have time to marinate this, just long enough for the oven to preheat.  I used dried parsley, and I only used 4 Tbsp of olive oil.  I did think it was a little salty.  I will make this again and cut the salt in half.  Otherwise,  very very good!

Restaurant Quality Recipe!

I made some adjustments to this and it turned out amazing.  I used 4T of EVOO, 2T of melted butter, 1T of Italian Seasoning, salt, pepper and juice of 1 lemon.  This will be a weekly dinner from now on.

I am pretty picky about the way I cook my fish, and this was by far the #1 EASIEST and #2 TASTIEST salmon I've ever cooked in my life. We had a bunch of people over for dinner and everyone couldn't stop eating it. Super easy and super delicious.

I don't like how the fish is swimming in oil but the taste is out of this world. Added a little more garlic and lemon juice and a little less oil. I would maybe next time just marinate the salmon but not pour the marinade over the salmon while baking to reduce the oiley-ness. Great Recipe!

My 2 and 4 year olds ate this up!  Moist and very flavorful.  Will make this again and again!  I did read everyone's notes and used 2T oil, about 3/4 tsp salt and pepper and added 1T dill.  Amazing!

Excellent. I used a teaspoon of dried parsley flakes as substitute for the fresh and added a tablespoon of sherry.  Pair it with a baked Maryland crabcake,  grilled asparagus tips and a tall glass of Foster's  :-*

I have been on the look out for a tasty, non-fishy salmon recipe for years. I'm so glad I came across this one. I would have never thought that a combination of such simple ingredients could result in such a flavorful dish.

Now if I could only find a sauce to go with it, I'd be in heaven.

This recipe is great. After making it the first time exactly as directed, I agree with other reviewers in that there was way too much oil, so the second time, I tried 3 tablespoons and half the salt and it turned out amazing. I also use this recipe with tilapia fillets and bake them with green and red peppers and onions. YUM!!

The kids loved this, but my husband and I didn't care for the combination of flavors much at all and thought it was way too oily.  Perhaps our herbs were old and I used dried parsley, but I don't think that even if I used fresh, it would have changed our opinion much.  We won't try it again.

I am delighted that this turned out great!  I've been trying to cook salmon for years because it is my husband's favorite.  And finally, for the first time, it was good!!  I didn't expect my kids to eat it, I didn't even put any on their plates.  But, I let them try mine and they filled up on it!  It was quick and easy.  I used all dried herbs for convenience and only let it marinate for about 20 mins.  Might have to fix this every week :)

No question about it, this is a GREAT RECIPE!!!

As a family, we eat salmon on a regular basis. This is by far the tastiest recipe we have had and the salmon comes out just right (not dry like when you grill it).

I don't go in the kitchen that often, so my criteria for cooking is simple recipes. This definitely meets the criteria.

Definitely not the best salmon recipe on here ~ not the worst either. The flavor was nice, but made weak by the amount of oil the fish is drowning in.

This is very tasty and quick to make - a no fail recipe. I had a bit left over and it tasted just as good the next day. I have made this several times, it's the only way I make salmon now.

This was the first time I ever cooked salmon and it came out fantastic! I didn't have fresh garlic, so I substituted garlic salt and didn't add the 1 tsp of salt in the recipe. It came out wonderfully and didn't have a fishy taste at all. I got many compliments on this dish. I will definitely make it again!

Love this recipe.  It's easy and delicious.  I skip the step of marinating in the fridge and just go right to placing the fish in the foil and applying the marinade.  Makes it even easier!

I found Salmon on sale and decided to try one of the "quick and easy" recipes out. Man was this a pleaser! It was so easy and flavorful! My husband and I both ate more than what we needed. Just couldn't help ourselves :)

YUM! This is the best fish I've tasted, a keeper recipe for sure! The taste is wonderful, love the combo of spices, and the fish was so flaky.

Amazing and super easy.. used with salmon and steelhead. Follow ROUVER's suggestions and you can't mess it up. Also, it's a great recipe if you like the taste of fish because it doesn't completely cover the fish flavor up.

I tweaked this recipe a bit per the "Most Helpful" review from Rouver.  So glad I didn't add all the oil the recipe calls for!  I thought it tasted pretty good.  I will probably make it again since I always have these ingredients on hand.

I have never cooked fish before and don't even really like eating fish but I tried it anyway. I could not be happier! The recipe is incredibly easy and I have never tasted better salmon.  Even my brother who hates seafood loved this meal. This is a wonderful recipe!

I listened to all the other reviewers and used only 2 Tbsp of olive oil + 1 Tbsp of butter.  Scaled down on the herbs as well.  It was good.  Very lemony, but good.  Plus, it was nice and easy to cook - and this was very important to me!

Easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe, but not the olive oil based on other feedback. Still a bit too much oil, but otherwise great. Will make again.

this was great -- garlicky and a good complement to salmon.  We might try it with some other fish too.

This was very tasty.  I used exact ingrediants/measurements.  The only changes were that I had cut my Salmon into serving size pieces before marinating. I also covered the baking dish with foil instead of wrapping each piece.  
Even my kids enjoyed this one, and I will use it again.

Very good; nice and moist.  I halved the salt, and found it still oversalty, so I'll go to 1/4 tsp. next time.  Had no fresh parsley, so used 1/2 Tbsp. dried, and it was fine.

Made this the other night.  It is easy and good.  I felt there was a little too much salt, but that is a quick fix next time.  Made it with some lentils.  Great Meal.  Will def make again.  Thank you.

This was a wonderful recipe. I copied the recipes verbatim; except I used a tad more lemon juice and I used 5 tablespoons of EVOO. I also baked 1.37 lbs of salmon instead of 1lb.  I baked in nonstick foil in a glass baking pan for 40 minuets at 375. It was perfect just enough left over sauce to drizzle over brown rice. Thanks Ladyblade. My hubby, 3 and 1 year old daughters thank you too. ;)

I typically eat a couple bites of salmon and give the rest to my husband, but I ate my entire portion with this recipe! I did reduce the olive oil to 2 tablespoons, and marinated the portions in a ziplock bag. I think that helped them soak up the flavors. I then wrapped them in foil and placed on a baking sheet for 28 minutes.

Delicious!!!! I've love salmon, but hadn't tried basil on it before. I was skeptical but not only do I now love salmon even more, I love basil too! I made it this way and it was delicious of course. Then I tried a few other combos and was equally pleased. One of my variations was delicious but don't be afraid to play with the measurements. I don't measure so I'm giving an estimate. I wouldn't go TOO heavy on everything because you may wind up with too much flavor. I used 4 (6 ounce) fillets of salmon (no skin) and rubbed about half to one teaspoon of olive oil on each side. I poured a teaspoon of lemon juice on each side. (Sounds like a lot but isn't) Then I added the following items both to the bottom of my pyrex baking dish and to the top of the salmon after I put it in the dish: (all dried and same measurements for top and bottom) 1.5 teaspoon of basil, 1 teaspoon of oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1.5 teaspoons parsley, 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon dill weed, 1/2 teaspoon mint, 1/4 teaspoon of thyme. Cover with foil. Place in preheated 350 degree oven. Cook for 20 minutes. Take off foil and cook 5-10 more min. uncovered. You can add more salt and lemon juice after baking if u like.

This was the first salmon recipe I've tried, and it was AWESOME! I had never experimented with salmon before and thought hey, if it's this good, I should try some other salmon recipes... I was only disappointed with them.  This is hands down the best.  I usually add some dill weed and though I've tried it with jarred minced garlic, it is much better with fresh.  As other reviewers have said, the amount of oil can be reduced a little bit.  Instead of covering the fillets in foil, I wrap them completely and place them in a glass baking dish.  Usually make with brown rice and steamed broccoli and drizzle the leftover juices over the sides...  WONDERFUL! Boyfriend's favorite dish!

I made this dish for Christmas dinner and it was a HIT! As a cook, you know that you did well when the only sounds you hear are "MMMMM!!!" and the clanking of forks on plates. A couple of our guests (and myself) are not big fish fans, but were absolutely floored by the flavorful tastes in this dish. I made it exactly as the recipe states, and while there was still a lot of marinade in the baking dish, I had people spooning it out to put on the rest of their food. This was my first salmon dish I have made, and I have to say that this is going in to my coveted favorite recipes book. Thanks!

Family loved it.  It came out soooo moist and flavorful!  I even left the skin on and it did not taste fishy at all.   Will be making this again and again!  So easy and very little mess!

EDIT: I made this again tonight, but didnt marinate the salmon because I didnt have time, just put the salmon in a glass casserole dish and then threw all the ingredients on top and WOW so good and easy! BF said it was better than any salmon at a restaurant!

I didn't get to marinade for the full amount of time, maybe 15 minutes. But I thought it was flavorful and a compliment to the salmon. Not overpowering for those who like salmon.

Perfect!  I have often made salmon and just thrown on my seasonings, even very similar to this, but this just seems to me the magic recipe to be so delicious!  I doubled the lemon becaus that's how we like it :)  Thanks for the recipe!

WONDERFUL!  I followed the advice of one reviewer & a few changes.  3T olive oil, 3/4 basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 2T lemon juice, 1 tsp parsley.  I used 3 fillets too.  Taking the skin off after cooking is a great idea.  Covering the whole dish with foil works well.  I cooked it for 30 minutes.  I also used dried minced garlic (1/2 tsp).  Also, I spooned some of the "juice" onto the fish after cooking.  The combo of flavors are wonderful!  What a smell!  A winner we'll have again!

excellent recipe, though I made a few changes. I substituted oregano for the basil (mainly because I was out of basil) and added a couple of tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. This is the last salmon recipe I will ever need!

Made this for one (myself!) and all the math and the extra time was well worth it!  Had it over brown rice with juices as suggested and some al dente asparagus.  Fine restaurant dining at home!  Thanks!

Completely delicious.  I will definitely be using this again.  It is easy and results in incredible flavor.  Instead of placing them in aluminum foil, I placed the fillets in an 8 x 8 baking dish and covered the baking dish with aluminum foil.  Wonderful thank you for the recipe.

I was really torn on how to rate this, so here's how it breaks down. I give a 5 star for flavor. Because the flavor was very nice. The over all preparations was very easy. BUT having said that the oil factor in this recipe is outragous. That's my 3 star. There was still way to much oil. I did do it to the T, and after placing the fish on the foil and then spooning the marinade mixture of the top, the oil was just too much. I like my fish lightly buttery just not drench in oil as it cooks, I would recommend that all the ingredients stay the same but cut the oil down by a few tablespoons.

i am wondering why something that is so easy to make is so yummy????? for real this recipe is soooo good.   i made everything as written plus extra garlic (of course) and it was great.  i am not a salmon fan i have always thought it was to fishy but with it being lent i would try new foods.  sooo happy i did.   all the flavors are great .  i am salts #1 fan.  i thought the salt was a little to much next time i'll do half.  whoooooooaoooooo.  what a great-easy-tasty dish!  i am glad we branched out now we have a great recipe.

This is my absolute FAVORITE salmon recipe & it's raved about by anyone I make it for.  All I did different is use 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2 (I love garlic & usually double what any recipe asks for) & I used extra virgin olive oil instead of light which I doubt makes much of a difference.  I am also too impatient to marinate it for any more than 20 minutes, but since I pour all the marinade on top of the salmon which I pair with brown rice, it's always plenty flavorful so the extra marinading time really doesn't matter.

Excellent and easy recipe.  This was my first time cooking fish.  Only tip I could give is to try and get a thick fillet of salmon, fish seems to cook fast.

TOO SALTY!  I had four 4oz portions of salmon so here are the changes I made. I used 3 cloves of garlic, one tsp of dried parsley (because I didn't have fresh) 2tablespoons of lemon juice, and after reading everyone’s note to cut down on oil... I used 4 tablespoons of oil instead of 6 (I should have paid attention to all the comments about salt, sheeesh) Also, because I was extra concerned with having too much oil, I took the fish out of the marinade and cooked them directly on a wire rack and lightly sprinkled on some bread crumbs. I baked the fillets at 400 for 15 minutes then broiled them another 5 minutes. We all enjoyed the flavour for the fish, however we will not use the recommended amount of salt next time. Even my one year old gobbled it all up!

This recipe is easy and delicious!  The only thing I change is to use half the amount of olive oil. I'm learning to cook by making one recipe a week for a year, and this is my biggest success yet!

I was thoroughly impressed with this recipe! I doubled the garlic and halved the olive oil. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried. I marinated the salmon in a ziplock bag for an hour. Then I placed the salmon and marinade in a baking dish and covered with foil. It was delicious! I served it with oregano rice (cooked rice tossed with melted butter, salt, and dried oregano) for a great meal.

I made this for dinner tonight. My 11yr old son said that it was super good. I rarely make anything exactly as the recipe is written. In making this recipe I made the following changes. I used 3 tbs oil and 1 tbs butter, abt 3/4 tsp salt, and  added abt 1/4 tsp thyme.  I rubbed a small amt of brown sugar on each fillet (on one side)b/4 pouring the marinade over it in a glass baking dish,placed a slice of lemon on each fillet, covered with foil, refrigerated for 1 hour and then baked. Yummy!

Made this recipe just as shown except I added two thin slices of lemon to each fillet before closing up the foil packet.  The fish was moist and delicious and perfect served over simple white rice. Will definitely make again and it's a money saver if you buy the individually wrapped frozen salmon fillets in bulk from your local costco or priceclub.

Yep, this is incredible. Take the skins off before marinating to get rid of the fishiness. Wonderful option for salmon!

This was a really good recipe. The only thing different I did was leave out the parsley and add just a little dried dill.  I'm use to making baked salmon with dill/lemon juice/onion/butter.  I was so surprised at the flavor using the basil.  It was really good, and didn't smell or taste like fish.  I think this is going to be my new standard salmon recipe!  Thank You for posting it.

I made this on the evening my boyfriend's mom was coming over for dinner.  She's very health conscious, so I wanted to make baked salmon, but I'd never done so before.  Needless to say, she was extremely impressed and even asked me for my recipe!!!!!  This is delicious.  My boyfriend and I have this at least twice a week now! Thanks sooo much.

I literally just got done eating my homecooked salmon and yummm yummm yummm! I had never cooked nor ATE Salmon but my boyfriend likes it and requested it. I downed the olive oil, upped the lemon and downed the salt. I individually wrapped it in aluminum foil and it came out amazing. My boyfriend is scraping his plate as we speak. Tastes good with a good Pinot Grigio, too!

Finally, a fish recipe that I want to eat more than once! This is utterly fantastic, although a little too salty. I may omit the salt altogether the next time I make it. I reduced the olive oil all the way down to 1T as other review suggested and I upped the lemon to 2T. I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used 1/2t dried. Really, really excellent.

Holy Cow, was this a great recipe!!!  I played pretty loose with the specifics per other reviewers suggestions, but it was the easiest and yummiest dinner I have made in... well, maybe forever!  I upped the garlic a little, reduced the oil to approx 2 TBSP, upped the Lemon Juice to 4-6 TBSP (just poured until it looked right), added dill and broiled it for about 8 min per side, turning and flipping frequently to prevent burning.  Then, as suggested I took what was left of the sauce in the glass pan and added it to brown rice and served the Salmon on that.  Magnificent!!!  I will definitely be making this again soon, and for company!!!

I made this dish for my boyfriend for our first Valentines together and I am soooo glad that I did.  This was an excellent dish.  It had so much flavor to it and he raved about it for days.  I guess that had nothing to do with him asking me to marry him that night. :)

While the flavor of the salmon is great, changes really need to be made to the recipe.  There is WAY to much Oil, so I reduced it to 2 Tbsp. Also I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, I added a dash of dill weed, added 1 Tbsp melted butter and increased the lemon juice to 3Tbsp. ALSO If you will skin the fish first it will take that strong fishy taste away.

This is salmon is wonderful. I followed other's suggestions and reduced the olive oil to two tablespoons. I added cherry tomatoes and baked in a corningware casserole with a glass lid for 40 minutes. Served with garlic bread. Perfection!

I have been making this dish for about a year before joining the site as a member today. This is such an easy way to prepare salmon - and it is absolutely DELICIOUS! I made the recipe exactly how it instructed and have not a single complaint! Very elegant to the eye as well.

The only change I made was to spray on some olive oil instead of using all those tablespoons.  I also didn't have time to marinate so just sprayed and garnished with other ingrediants and popped in the oven covered with foil.  Still excellent.  I will most def make again. Thanks for a good recipe.

After reading reviews I decided to cut the olive oil in half (with three pieces of salmon)and kept everything else the same. WAY too salty...The flavor was good but the salt was overwhelming. We managed to eat about 1/2 of it. I will make again but cut the salt by AT LEAST 1/2. The only other change I made was I used fresh basil instead of dried. It's a lovely presentation with the basil,parsley and garlic bits and pieces. I also baked mine in the glass pan covered with foil and it was ready in approximately 30-35 minutes at 375. Other than the sale, very good. I served it with roasted broccoli (with Tony's) and a herb/butter pasta rice dish. (one of those in the envelope, it was good).

First time making this recipe.  This turned out very well and was a very easy recipe.  I used 1/2 pound of fresh, wild sockeye salmon and I switched the marinade to 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice.  Next time I will use 2 tablespoons of each.  I used fresh chopped basil and parsley and also added a small amount of fresh chopped sage and a pinch of dried dill.  I had a little fresh rosemary in the refrigerator; however, I forgot to add a 1/4 teaspoon to the marinade (duh!).  I marinated the salmon for about 3 hours in a plastic baggie and squeezed the mixture about once an hour (8 to 24 hours marinating would be better).  I wrapped the salmon with the marinade in aluminum foil and baked for 40 minutes at 375 F.  PERFECT!!!  I served this wonderful meal with long grain and wild rice and a tossed salad.  A nice Sauvignon Blanc completed the meal.

I have never really liked salmon except for a recipe a friend makes with spinach and my neighbor had given me a piece so I decided to try this recipe since it was similar in spices to my friends even though no spinach.  I have to say that I thought it was delicious and will make it again and try to work the spinach into it. The only thing I changed was not using as much olive oil and small amount of salt and pepper. This recipe is a keeper for me and will make it when having company.  Thanks for a great recipe and will share with my friends who like salmon.

My husband & I arent big on fish, but are trying to eat healthier. Excellent recipe. I also decreased the amount of oil to 1 tbsp. and marinated in zip lock bag for an hour. This is incredibly easy both in preparing and clean up. We will definitely be having this one again.

It sounds too simple to be good but this was incredibly an incredibly flavorful salmon dish.  Definitely on my keeper list.

My substitutions:  I used 1 tbsp. of olive oil instead of 6.  I couldn't find my dried basil so I substituted dried Italian Seasoning.  I also didn't put this in a foil packet but instead just sealed the glass baking dish with tinfoil.

WOW WOW WOW.  This was just delious.  I marinated the salmon for two hours and my husband grilled the salmon for about 20 - 25 minutes.  We had purchased a piece of salmon with no skin that weighed a little over two pounds.  The only thing different that we'll do next time (when using a piece of salmon much larger then the recipe).  Is increase the quantity of all the ingredients according to the size of the piece of salmon.  For example - 2lb piece of salmon = use 4 times the amount of ingredients.  EXCEPT for the olive oil, I don't think it needed as much as was recommended.  I'd experiment with that.  Plus, I used italian seasoning instead of just basil.  This is a must for salmon lovers recipe box.

Loved it! As usual I changed it beyond recognition but it was so good. I used the marinade as designed but with fresh basil, flat leafed parsley, splash of oil to ensure all is covered and some lemon zest added. Rather than wrapping in foil I baked it open, topped with steamed spinach and garlic (3 cloves steamed with it , apparently too much (so the husband told me but the son thought it perfect..it possibly needed none at all) I then grated a little parmersan on top and baked it at 175C (sorry I don't understand F) for 30min, rest for 5 min. Served with bitter leaf salad and potatoes wedges. (1/4 cut, boiled till just tender tossed with olive oil and salt, baked 45 min at 175C then 5 min at 220C to complete.)

I'm 15 and I heard that eating fish makes you live longer but my mom never makes fish because she doesn't like it. I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out sooo good! My mom and brother and sister (fish-dislikers) actually loved it! Even my dad was impressed!

very easy to make and tastes good. I didn't use parsley, because I did not have any. It still came out delicious, served with rice. To avoid more dishes, I made the marinade in a ziplock bag and added the salmon to it. I marinated it in the fridge all night, to bake it the next day for dinner. I lined a glass baking dish with aluminum foil, placed the salmon on it with its marinade, and wrapped the whole thing with the foil, making sure it didn't leak. And voila! No dishes to clean whatsoever! Great recipe, simple and fresh tasting.

Just delicious! So moist and flaky. Baking the salmon worked great, and no fishy smell in my house. Like others, I reduced the oil to 2 T and baked the fish uncovered. 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes was all it needed (turn over partway through). I served it with yummy Roasted New Potatoes (from Ann), also on allrecipes.

I really liked this, but I messed up & used 2 large fillets that were almost 12 ounces each! I think if I had used the recommended amounts of marinade it would have been too much. I wrapped each fillet in foil & baked 40 minutes. Turned out perfect. Yummy & healthy!

Fabulous recipe!

I followed the recipe ALMOST EXACTLY! Only changes were slightly less oil and an addition of 1/2 tsp of dry dill. (Per other reviews)...

Using the foil packets make it an easy cleanup! My husband is a HUGE FOODIE and in the restaurant business and he LOVED this. 

I don't even like Salmon all that much and I loved this!

Great recipe!

This turned out delicious!  It was very easy and will probably be how we eat our salmon from now on.  I didn't have the parsley so we skipped it and it didn't seem to make much difference.

I'd never made fish before, but my man loves salmon, so I thought I'd try.  I should say that I do NOT like salmon.  

Anyway, I made this with dill b/c I didn't have any cilantro, and it was wonderful.  Even I liked it and that's saying something.  

This recipie is super easy to make.  I did mix the lemon juice, tomatoes, dill, garlic and all that together and let it set for about an hour or so, so that the flavors could blend together.

I'll definitely be making this again!

I just made this tonite and my boyfriend said it was very good. He is not a big fish eater, but ate most of it as it was fresh salmon from Alaska. I have to say it was very tasty. I gave it 5 stars.

I've made this recipe regularly since trying it a few months ago but hadn't left a review.  I made it again tonight and the entire family always looks forward to salmon night.  This is from a family who doesn't 'like' fish.  This a wonderful recipe!  I use quite a bit more lemon and double the Basil & Parsley.

Wow! Turned out very well. I cut down on the olive oil by 2T. and salt by half to make it healthier.  Baked it in a glass dish covered with foil for 25 minutes and it was perfect. My husband said the salmon was restaurant quality. I'm not a salmon lover but I really enjoyed this dish.  Will make this part of our menu rotation.

I love fish but have never liked salmon until I tried this recipe. It was delicious. Next time I would probably reduce or eliminate the salt, but who knows, that may affect how it tastes.
Definitely a keeper!

My husband had been asking me to make salmon (and he's not a seafood person), and wouldn't you know it but I misplaced my hubby approved salmon recipe. I found this one, and decided it was similar enough that he would try it. I put some canned diced tomatoes over it while it was cooking, and he liked it almost as much as the other recipe ;)

I can now cook fish!!!!  Love fish, could never ever cook it properly!  This was outstanding, moist, flavorful, perfectly seasoned, etc.! I served it over angel hair pasta with mushrooms, onions and mild banana peppers -- a true "PARTY IN MY MOUTH!!"

Easy way of preparing salmon. I used only half amount of salt and next time I will half garlic too (too much for me). I baked it 30 min in a glass dish covered with foil(same I used to marinade) and it turned out great.

Excellent flavour!  I thought the cooking time for salmon seemed long so I only put it in for 30 minutes but in hind sight I think the full 45 minutes was required as the centre was a little too pink.  It must be because it is wrapped.  My family loved it and even my 5 year old ate it.  Husband gave it a 5!

I couldn't wait to try this recipe after reading all the rave reviews. I followed the instructions (other than marinading it for about three hours rather than one). Personally, I thought it was quite bland. Though the salmon was tender & not at all dry, the flavor itself was pretty boring & indistinct. Doubtful I'll try this one again.

Wow!  Made this last weekend and grilled the salmon instead of baked it and everyone wanted the recipe. Also used it to marinade the shrimp and they were delicious.  The only thing I do is add extra garlic cloves, but otherwise leave the recipe as is.  Thanks, we make this almost once a week!

I combined this recipe with the Cocanut/Bread Crumb baked Salmon and it was especially delicious. I served it with spinach,(cooked in skillet with a tablespoon of olive oil and 2 minced garlic cloves with salt and pepper to taste), as my veggie and served it up with long-grain rice.  Great Meal!!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I used Wild Coho Fillets which can be a little dry, but they turned out moist and very flavorful.  Easy to make and extremely  tasty, thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very tasty recipe!  I really love salmon, but this recipe is so good that my husband and I just gobbled it up.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was:  After the cooking time finished, I simply cut open the foil and allowed the salmon to brown lightly for approximately 5 minutes.

We lived in Alaska for years and I was looking for a way to recapture that taste. This was as close to the real thing as I have yet gotten. My fish snob of hubby loved it as well as my fisherman father. Good job!

YUMMY -- And I dislike fish or any seafood!  Fiance loved it two, best dish I have ever made, he says.  Made some small modifications, I too cut oil by 2tbsp, doubled garlic, and also cut salt in 1/2. I was out of fresh parsely so I used dried parsley, also added white wine to the marinade.. yummy,  he even took leftovers to work the next day!!   Will definitely make this again.

This receipe is terrific for people who don't like fish or don't know how to cook it.  This was my first attempt at preparing fish and it turned out terrific!  I didn't have much time so I only marinated it for 1 hour, but it was still very flavorful.

this recipe was great!  my boyfriend and i were looking for an easy salmon recipe to try out and this one fit the bill.  the marinade is easy to make and the ingredients are things that you probably already have in your kitchen. my only complaint was i thought it was a little too oily so next time i think we'll try it with a little less olive oil.  i would highly recommend this recipe.

First time making salmon and it came out so moist and flavourful. Omitted the parsley and increased lemon juice and garlic. Next time I would probably marinate it for longer to get the flavour to the center of the fish...other than that, served over a bed of egg noodles, it's like a gourmet meal !!! Thanx for making it so easy with this recipe Norma !!!

Excellent & Easy recipe!  I reduced the olive oil and used 2 tbls. melted butter and some white wine (I didn't measure)...I also added some rosemary and used italian seasoning as I had no basil!  I placed everything in a glass casserole dish with a lid, marinated and backed in this dish - rather then wrapping it in foil! I was surprised at how tasty this was!  Thanks!

Great recipe!  As previously said, I reduced the amount of oil to 3 TBS.  I also used lime juice instead of lemon juice since we were out of it.
I also put sliced onion on the bottom and baked it.  Yummy!!  The salmon was very soft and moist.  My friend and I really raved about it!
However, my husband and my 7yrs old son prefers salt broiled salmon and didn't care too much for this.  I would make it again though-just for me!

We are trying to learn to like Salmon, because it is so good for you. This dish has really helped us learn to love it! I marinated it for several hours adding to the marinade extra garlic decreasing the oil to 3 Tbls. using fresh basil, extra lemon juice and layed lemon slices on top.
Grilled it for 15 minutes and turned out beautifully. I made a basic light lemon sauce put some on each plate and layed a nice piece of salmon on top. Was a gourmet meal! Thanks for a delicious way to fix Salmon.

This was really good. The flavor reminded me of shrimp scampi. I put a slice of lemon on top of each fillet as well as the lemon juice in the marinade. I'll definitely make this again.

Finally!  I've been looking for a decent recipe for salmon and this is it.  My husband, who isn't crazy about fish, was licking his fingers.  I took another reviewer's advice about doing 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is, not only the best salmon rcipe I have ever tried, but the best recipe.  I never liked salmon but wanted to eat healthier so I tried a couple recipies and still didn't like it.  Then I tried this recipe and I LOVED it.  I want salmon all the time.  My 4 and 2 year old liked it also.  GREAT RECIPE!!!

I have never liked salmon in restaurants, but want to have it at home because it is so healthy.  This recipe was delicious and has made a salmon lover out of me.  My husband really liked it as well.  I only had dried parsley and it was still great.  I did use the recipe as written other than that and I just put the fish in a glass dish and covered with foil.  So good, so easy, so healthy.

FANTASTIC!!!!  I was skeptical about all the olive oil used, but the salmon does not come out oily.  This recipe is very flavorful & easy to make.

Very Good!! We really enjoyed this recipe this evening. I followed the recipe and used the recommended olive oil but added an additional tbsp on lemon juice. This was good because I used alittle more salmon too. I also used seasoned pepper instead of ground black pepper and I grilled it on my gas BBQ. It was YUMMY!  Since salmon is one of our regular dishes, we will be making this recipe again for sure. Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe one desperate day when I was low on groceries and chose it mainly because I had all the ingredients!  To my surprise it was as good, if not better, than fancier recipes I have tried in the past.  It has become part of my regular routine and works equally well on pacific snapper.  Yum!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The topping was wonderful.  I have tried other salmon recipes on this site but this is by far the best one.  My kids wouldn't try it though.  This is excellent for dinner parties.  I did add more lemon juice and less oil.

This recipe is good and fast I have made it quite a few times but with many adjustments the parsely is too over powering so I almost disregard it completely. I also use about two tablespoons of oil for the marinade.  And please oh please only cook your salmon for 25 minutes.

This was a very tasty and very easy recipe, however I would reduce or eliminate the salt - it was way too much for me and made the salmon salty tasting.  Otherwise it was a great recipe - my husband loved it!

Awesome recipe. How something so simple and quick to prepare can taste so great is unbelievable. This is the first time I have cooked salmon and it turned out better than I could have imagined. This will be a regular meal in our home from now on.

Everyone was right - this was very good.  I did use less oil and used fresh herbs which I had growing.  Also more lemon and less salt, but I never measure salt - just add what I think is correct by a sprinkle or two.

This was my first time baking salmon, and it turned out beautifully....even my six year old loved it, and asked for seconds!
I added thinly sliced onions and lemons to the packets before baking.  Delicious!

Fabulous! Works with salmon steaks. I crushed the garlic and used fresh basil. Also, I just took the dish in which the salmon was marinating and cooked the fish right in it - no need to separately wrap the fish. 

Very refreshing!!

Great recipe(!), but it's a little salty, & 40 mins. gave me a slightly overcooked fish.

Trying to find a salmon recipe that the whole family likes. This one fits the bill! Delicious! I use dried parsley because I don’t want to buy fresh and it goes to waste. Serve with white rice and a roasted veggie like asparagus or broccoli.

My whole fam including the picky eater loves  and asks for this!  I use 2 lbs salmon filet.  4 -5 cloves garlic, 1 -2 tbsp evo, usually forget about the salt.  I use 1tbsp basil & parsley + 2tsp dill.  I don't " marinade" but just pop it all on top of the salmon.  Wrap tight in foil n bake in the oven about 35 minutes.  I tuck the thin skinny ends of the filets under if you have them for more even cooking.  Feeds 5-6

Terrible recipe. Fish comes out overcooked and flavorless after being basically boiled for so long. Try broiling it instead.

This was easy and delicious. The only thing I did differently was to put the marinade in a Pyrex casserole dish, marinate the salmon in that dish, and then put the casserole directly into the  oven covered by aluminum foil. The garlic on top of the salmon got poached and covered the salmon with little white blobs, which looked odd, but everything tasted great. I'll definitely do this dish again!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious! My husband went salmon fishing a few weeks ago, so we cut them up and froze them. I wouldn’t tweak a thing with this recipe and don’t quite understand why people invariably have to post all their changes because then it turns out to be entirely different than the original.

This recipe is da bomb. I never knew a bite of scaly fish could taste like 10 seconds of heaven, but boy this recipe sure blew me and my family away! One change that I would def recommend is to cut the salt in half and use 1/2tsp and I also added about 4tbs of melted butter drizzled onto the pan after I took it out of the oven...mmm 

(My sister hates fish and she had an entire fillet)

I usually bake salmon without covering, but wanted to try a foil-sealed version.  So I marinated 2 salmon steaks with this marinade, and baked one in foil per recipe, and one without cover (for only 20 minutes).  The foil-sealed piece was very moist but, surprisingly, not near as flavorful as the other.  It also lost that nice salmon color.   I will use the marinade again, but just bake the fish without the foil in the future.

The marinade was great.  But you should not cook the salmon for the full-recommended time - unless you enjoy dry fish.

We went to a five-star restaurant and my daughter ordered the salmon. She said, “it tastes just like yours, mom.”  I have made this recipe countless times since my daughter begs for it. I follow the recipe to a “T.”  It’s s winner!

Made it according to the recipe. It came out too dr. Also the pepper seasoning overpowered the taste of all the other ingredients. I won't be making this again unless I altered the seasoning, cooking time, and/or temperature.

Great recipe, don't need to change a thing except bake time! I have made this several times now and have used fresh basil instead of dry on some occasions (tastes just as great!) and after the first try, I now reduce the olive oil by a couple of TBSP. Everyone's oven is different but I find that at 375 degrees, the salmon would be incredibly dry if left to bake for 35 min. I typically start checking at the 20 min mark and have never baked past 25 min.

The marinade is fine, but the time is WAYYYYY too much. 20 minutes at 375 in foil should be plenty. In the back of my mind, I knew this when I saw the cook time, but with such good reviews and some reviews insisting to do the full 45, I gave it a shot. As I suspected, 45 was far too long. The salmon was chewy and getting dry. The next time, I lowered it by 10 minutes and had the same result. Fish cooks very quickly. This recipe time should be cut in half or broiled for 5 or so minutes instead. You'll thank me later!

I give my son weekly cooking lessons to help him be more self sufficient in the kitchen. This recipe was so easy! We almost doubled the ingredients since I was making 3 pieces of salmon. We baked for a full 30 minutes and it came out perfect. Next time I'll just squeeze half more lemon into the marinade. Served over rice and lentil pilaf. Will DEF be making this again!

Honestly, the flavours were there but I made a rookie mistake. I knew the cook time was far too long, but I didn't see anyone say anything about it, so I followed it. I'm not sure if everyone else has a lower cooking oven, but I'm sure it would have been perfect if I dropped ten minutes off the cook  time. I'll try it at 20 to 25 minutes the next time.

This is soooo easy and soooo good! I subbed in fresh basil from the garden and added some minced fresh tomato to the marinade. I did not have time to marinade the fish an just poured it over the salmon. I  used a bigger piece of fish and let it bake a few minutes more. My husband thought it was the most delicious salmon he has had.

I have never liked salmon before but I am now trying to eat it as long it taste good so this is my very first time making salmon it and I loved this recipe!!! Simple and really delicious! I did not really measured but added ingredients to my liking - lots of garlic, less salt, lots of lime juice instead and olive oil to my desire.  Also baked it for 30-35 min in the oven, no cover. Printed the recipe for the ingredients and will be making it again. It's a must try! Thank you.

Easy to make and very tasty.  I decided to bake this in a glass baking dish instead of wrapped in foil. Sliced lemon on top while baking at 450 degrees for about 20 minutes. Yummy!

I loved it! I cut the salt, pepper and lemon in half. I didn't have parsley but it was fantastic anyway. I baked it for 30 minutes at 350*. Easy and fabulous!

This was the FIRST time I ever made salmon, and it was DE-LISH!!!  Rarely do I ever follow a recipe exactly, but for the price I paid for the salmon, I didn't want to have to trash this expensive cut of fish!  The only things I'll do differently next time is cut down on the salt and olive oil.  I can definitely taste the lemon, which I like, so this was a fantastic flavor for me.

I really like this recipe and would  recommend it.  The only thing I do different is I cook it with slices of lemon on top.  I think it gives it a little more flavor and I love lemon.  Otherwise it is perfect as is.

I am always looking for new ways to make salmon. This recipe is definitely staying on my list of ways to make salmon that are healthy and taste fantastic! The only thing I did differently was put it under the broiler for 5 minutes with lemon slices on top. I really enjoyed it and so did the rest of my family.

We didn't care for this at all. I think maybe the people who raved about it made changes that helped it taste better. As written, it had WAY too much pepper and too much olive oil. I think it baked too long also; at 35 minutes it came out too tough. It's not just my oven; virtually nothing is ever done at the shorter bake time in there.

I loved the recipe however I decided to add three cloves of garlic and dried parsley, instead of fresh. We cooked with 22.88 ounces of fish instead of 12 ounces like the recipe called for and it still turned out great. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.

I used dried spices and it turned out good.  Also next time will reduce the amount of oil from 6 to 4 tablespoons.  This was very moist but the key was to marinate for the entire hour before cooking.

The ingredients work well together in this recipe, it was the quantity of ingredients that I altered to suit my needs for four planks of salmon, I lessened the amount of olive oil by half and multiplied all the other seasonings/herbs by 1.5, and it came out delish! I cooked it at 375 for 20 minutes with the foil on and then 10 minutes without the foil and it was ready! My hubby and his dad loved it so I will be making this recipe again!

This turned out really great! It's super easy to make, and tastes delicious. I paired it with some noodles in a cream sauce that I mixed the rest of the marinade in with some cherry tomatoes and it's superb! Definitely recommend this - I will for sure make it again!

I thought the oil was overkill but loved the seasoning. Also, the high oven temperature made the fish a bit dry. Would definitely make again with modifications.

Great recipe! As other reviewers have mentioned, the fish tastes a bit salty when spiced as written and there is more olive oil than necessary, it will go to waste unless you pour it over another dish such as rice. I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp and added olive oil by eye. I didn't wrap the fillets individually with foil and instead put foil over the top of the pan I marinaded them in and baked for 25 minutes at 375C (for thick fillets). Turned out moist and flavorful!

Excellent marinade that beautifully enhances the flavor of salmon. One of those "Doh!  Why didn't I think of that?!?" sort of recipes.  I followed it exactly - so easy, "fast food" at home, and Better Half (who claims to hate fish) loved it.  This is going into our standard rotation of meals.  I served it with a baked sweet potato and bacon-onion braised green beans.  Delicious!

My girlfriend gave me this recipe, saying it was her husband's favorite.  It is now my favorite way to prepare fish - I like to use Tilapia in the recipe.  The cook time and seasoning is perfect.  The taste of the marinade alone- is so buttery tasting (though butter free?) and delicious I would cook everything in it if I could.

My boyfriend and I love salmon, and we've tried many different recipes but this is by far the best. I had some salmon I cut into steaks so I used that instead of a fillet and lightly poked holes on them before I marinaded them. I also marinaded the salmon in the fridge for a longer time (2-3 hours) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly; It really brings out the delicious taste of the fish rather than add too much flavor to it. My boyfriend and I've found that a lot of the other recipes for baked salmon adds flavoring that interferes with the natural taste of salmon but now were sticking to this recipe whenever we have salmon! So good! Thank you for posting!!

Nice recipe.  Made a few tweaks based on serving for 4:  mixing all of the dry ingredients first, I only used 1/2 cup of olive oil, reduced black pepper to 1 teaspoon, added an extra clove of garlic and added a teaspoon of dried dill and let fillets marinate for an hour.  After baking in the sealed foil for 30 minutes, I opened up the packets, flipped the salmon over and broiled the skin for 5-7 minutes to a nice crisp.  The fish never end up swimming in oil when placed in individual aluminum packets.  Can use leftover marinade to top off each fillet.  Served in individual shallow bowls with brown rice, topped with kale sautéed with garlic, olive oil and lemon and the fillet laid on top.  Huge compliments from the 10 year old to the 80 year old.

The flavors in this recipe are fantastic! I wouldn't change anything. I steamed some rice and veggies to go with it and had a wonderful meal.

This was so good! I followed other reviewers' suggestions on the marinade and decreased the olive oil to 2Tb and the dried basil to 1/2 tsp, but added 1Tb of butter and a sprinkle a dill weed. I marinated three 8oz salmon fillets for 2 hours and cooked it in a small baking dish. It cooked at 375 for 15 mins with the foil cover and an additional 15 mins at 425 with the foil removed. I served this with white rice and roasted asparagus and bell peppers and my girls cleaned their plates! Will definitely add this recipe to our daily rotation.

Recently a friend gave me a beautiful, fresh-caught center-cut steak from a salmon (Chinook) that he caught here.  Ordinarily, I (like many people) like to tweak the posted recipes a little.  But I saw no reason whatsoever to do so in this case.  The salmon came out fantastic and I am going to make it again and again.  As far as I am concerned, anyone who alters this recipe in any way is guilty of culinary malpractice.

This was so good.  I marinated it for an hour and a half, then baked uncovered in the oven for about 20 minutes (it was a thick piece) until is just flaked... delish!

Great recipe. Simply delicious! No changes made. However, I would recommend a little bit less of salt. I didn't have time to marinate it, just mixed the ingredients, placed fillet in aluminum foil, covered with marinade, and placed sealed salmon in the glass dish and baked as directed. Everybody loved it.

This is one of the first times I've followed a recipe for salmon and it came out pretty darn good! I added some cilantro and a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper for an extra kick and it was delicious!

It was very salty, and I was expecting way more flavor from the marinade. Maybe it was just overpowered by the taste of the salt?

I added some cheese, which was nice, but I do think the cooking time listed is too long- I cooked it on the lower end (also based on what the fish's recommended cooking length was) but it ended up being a little dry, despite the amount of marinade, which was overkill actually.

I just had this for dinner. I didn't have lemon and used lime instead. Turns out perfect. I made spicy soy sauce for dipping which makes it taste even better. Served with rice and baked asparagus. Yummy!

So delicious and easy to make! I was using 1 large salmon whole fish filet and actually ran out of basil so I substituted with rubbed sage and ground oregano 1/2 & 1/2 as well as using about 1/4 cup of the chopped parsley. It turned out absolutely fantastic!! One of the best yet :-)

This recipe was amazing! I've never made salmon that turned out so beautifully! A big bonus was that it was ready in the exact time the recipe said which so many recipes aren't.
I left out the lemon juice (personal preference, as it wouldn't have gone with the sauce we had the salmon with) as well as the parsley. 
I see endless possibilities as far as spices and herbs with this.

Thanks so much for an awesome way to cook salmon!!!

I have made this recipe a few times now and it's still my go-to for making salmon. It appears I never have lemon juice, so I never add it and I don't get fresh parsley, just use the dried. Very good flavor and it's delicious. Thank you for this recipe!

I grew up in a Canadian west coast town; salmon was a staple in our diets. I've eaten all kinds of salmon cooked in all kinds of ways, and this is truly one of the best I've ever had. Not only it is exceedingly delicious, but it's also very easy to make. I cooked this for a pescetarian-friendly Thanksgiving dinner in October and it was a huge hit. It's February now and people are still mentioning it to me!

The only thing I did differently was to add more garlic (I always cook with more garlic than instructed). Both my hubby and I absolutely loved this salmon! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Not a horrible recipe but not good either. I make salmon all the time usually w/ lemon pepper or sweat tangy recipes so I knew not to bake for 45 min which would ruin the fish, always bake salmon at 400 for 20 min exactly unless using steaks instead of filets. This recipe was not very flavorful and just kind of bleh, the oil is useless as would have been better w a tsp of butter instead and the only thing you taste is the garlic. won't use again

This is a great, simple recipe! One thing I alter is I cut the oil out of the baking process: just wrap the fillets/steaks up with the marinade that remains when you pick them out of the bowl (let it drip away a bit), add a tablespoon of water to the foil wrap and presto! Great recipe, LADYBLADE! Thanks!!!

This was one of the best things I have ever cooked. The only thing I did different was to add fresh vegetables in the foil packet. I had on hand bok choy, green onions, yellow onions, and mushrooms and brocolli. I put all of the marinade in with the fish/veggies and then served over brown rice.  So awesome.  Will make again very soon.

I tried this recipe as a way to introduce my toddler to salmon...he LOVES it!!!  He literally cannot get enough...I can sincerely say that this is his favorite food.  This is perfect for someone new to preparing salmon and for introducing into a diet.  Super easy to prepare and super yummy.

My husband and I celebrated our 44th wedding anniversary today, and I decided to do a nice dinner for us, i.s.o. going to a restaurant.  I opted for this recipe for our main course, and was a bit nervous, as I had never prepared fresh salmon before.  I did use about half the amount of olive oil, and dried parsley i.s.o. fresh, and only baked for about 25 minutes.  We absolutely LOVED the result - it was tender and juicy, with a lovely flavor.  My husband said this is probably the best meal he had ever eaten!  I could give it more than 5 stars!  I hope to make this much more often in the future, bearing in mind that fresh salmon is really, really expensive locally.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

I used to not like salmon at all, but this recipe is divine! A few notes I had: 1) there was way to much olive oil! Decrease it to make it healthier and easier to work with. 2) add some dill weed to the marinade. This is staple (to me) for making salmon. 3) I only needed about 30 minutes of marinating, but the longer you marinade, the stronger the taste will be.  I absolutely LOVE this recipe- it has become one of my most popular meals! I served mine with wild rice and asparagus - sooooo good!!!

This salmon was quite delicious even though I did not have time to let it sit in the fridge for an hour.  So it was covered with the marinade in a dish while the oven heated and I covered the dish with foil for the 35 minutes of baking.  And I used chopped basil that I had frozen this fall.

Made it without the parsley coz I didn't have any. Also put chopped almonds on the fish before baking.  Covered the whole exposed area of the fish with finely chopped almonds and gently pressed them in.

Taste amazing.  Did make a few small changes.  I only used 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and instead of black pepper I used crushed red peppers to spice it up a bit.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a great and VERY simple recipe to make. Anybody can make this one, even if you don't know ANYTHING at all about salmon! :) 

Here are some good suggestions.
1) My main suggestion is this: There is WAY TOO MUCH OLIVE OIL! After reading another review, I put in half the olive oil, and even that was a bit too much! 2) I added a teaspoon of dill and it turned out wonderful! 3) I am a garlic-lover and I did two more cloves of garlic than the recipe called for. ;) That always tastes better!! 

I know you'll enjoy this recipe! We had this with steamed broccoli and wild rice. 

This recipe - (despite too much olive oil) - is just perfect and everyone LOVES IT! 

Try it!

First off, I'm a vegetarian.  In fact, near vegan for over 20 years.  For the past few years, I've been having a lot of health issues and have become convinced I need to start getting meat back into my diet.  Even back when I used to eat meat, I did not care for seafood.  But, trying to improve my health, I'm starting off slow, trying to eat 1 an per day and 2 oz of some kind of free range meat.  So I went out and purchased about a pound of wild caught salmon and looked for a recipe for it and found this one.  I read other reviews and cut the oil back to 2 Tablespoons.  A full teaspoon of salt seemed like a lot, so I cut that to 1/2 teaspoon.  While I'm never going to love seafood, this recipe was good enough that I ate a little over my goal (2.5 ounces of the fish) and instead of just giving all of the remaining fish to my husband to eat, I put aside another 2.5 ounces to eat later this week.  Thanks for a good recipe that made eating fish palatable for me.  I was initially worried that it was way too much garlic, but it wound up being just perfect.  My husband hasn't tried this yet, or else I'd let you know what his opinion is as well (although he loves fish and meat, so can't imagine he would have anything negative to say).

I tried this recipe, with slight deviations (used thyme instead of parsley, and wrapped the salmon in bacon) and it was amazing! Will definitely be cooking this again.

I had to modify the recipe because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand. I used chives and dried parsley. I think next time I will eliminate the salt and use less olive oil (& maybe garlic?) to lighten it up a little. I am not a fish person and usually the only way I will eat it is grilled, but this was delicious. It was super easy & will be a regular on my dinner menus.

I made this the other night. I am not a fish lover and the two times I've eaten salmon I did not like it. My husband loves salmon but all these years I've refused to make it. I can tolerate tilapia and I had all the intentions in the world to buy tilapia but decided to take a chance on salmon. I googled Allrecipes salmon recipes while in the store and stumbled across this recipe. I really liked the salmon and will be making this again.

This is one of the best recipes I've found on the site so far. Salmon comes out juicy and flavorful with fool-proof preparation. One evening I didn't have time to let the fish marinade before cooking and it still turned out fine.

Great salmon recipe! However, I am confused by ROUVER's review. She stated that she used the left-over marinade to put on the rice etc. I hope she was talking about the pan juices. You should NEVER use the marinade that the fish was in. It's a very dangerous health concern.

Excellent. I used half of the recommended salt & only 1 TBS oil & baked it in a dish with foil covering as others recommended. I also added some small diced Roma tomatoes. My fish was just done in 25 min & let sit to come to temp. I prefer it not over cooked. Definitely will eat again as part of a low GI diet!

This recipe is amazing! I tweeked it a little bit... I didn't have oregano so I used rosemary, nor did I have a lemon so I used a lime... Yea yea, I changed pretty much the entire recipe since it doesn't call for much - oh well! From now on this will be my basic Baked Salmon recipe!

This was really good, but is the nutrition information correct?  I might be naive but over 610 calories and 51 grams of fat?  I saw this recipe listed elsewhere and it was half that for a serving.

This recipe is a keeper! I always had problem grilling salmon because it becomes dry and rubbery and we usually have leftovers after every meal. Tried this one and the it disappeared from the table fast. I only had one slice of a thick slab so I halved the ingredients except for the garlic. It tasted just like the ones served in the restaurants and was so easy to make. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

By far the best salmon I have ever made and tried. Flavor was outstanding. Even my wife couldn't believe that I could make something so good. Will be making this again and again

Perfect easy dish!! English hubby requests this once a week along with the mushy peas recipe from this site. Having it tonight, in fact! I think it tastes best when all ingredients have mingled with the salmon for a couple of hours in the fridge. I love an easy tasty meal. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Very tasty! The only thing I would've changed was the amount of garlic. Maybe it's just me, but I'm not a huge fan of it and I'm not used to eating it either... Overall, it was delicious! I had many compliments on not only its appearance but also the taste. I made it with rice and green beans. Definitely something I'd like to try again with a little less garlic.
Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fabulous marinade it flavored the fish so wonderfully. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it. I made the dish Friday and at his request again on Sunday. Thank you so much for the recipe.  I am definitely adding this into the rotation.

Very tasty! Followed all the portioned ingredients as directed however used a huge slab of salmon from Costco that I pre-cut into pieces (Approx 50 oz total...  or 1.5kg)...  Was concerned when I was marinading that I didn't have enough liquid so threw in a bit of white wine before cooking (about 1/4 cup) just to add moisture and sprinkled with some dill and lemon pepper.  Had marinaded in a casserole dish that I simply covered with foil, 375 for 30 min was perfect.  There was more then enough juices afterwards to put on rice and I probably didn't need to add the wine...  I can understand why it would be way to much marinade for only 2 X 6oz pieces!  Served with a Pinot Gris and got compliments all around!  Will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. I used half the salt and probably could have used less olive oil but it was great. We served the salmon with oven fried sweet potatoes.  They were perfect together.

OMG! My honey loves Salmon :) I myself am not a big fish person but this was amazing. It melts in your mouth. Delicious!  My son said "best dinner ever" ;) I did reduced the amount of olive oil & salt by half. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing :)

Made this as is except I didn't have parsley. Didn't miss it. It was delicious. I was apprehensive about so much olive oil since this fish has a lot of oil of its own, so I reduced it by 1 less TBS. probably could of reduced it a little more. This will be my salmon recipe for winter when we can't grill outside. Thanks for sharing.

I have used this recipe with shark, salmon, chicken- and they have all been amazing! I do use 2 Tablespoons oil and marinate overnight. I have never had the patience or forethought to marinate something that long, but it is so worth it!

This was good, however I feel the cooking time is way off.  Our salmon was definitely overcooked and dry.  If we do this again, we will adjust the cooking time.

This is the first salmon recipe, I have cooked myself, and I am very please, no Salmon was left over. My prep portions made the salmon a little more salty than i prefer, but the steamed veggies complimented well. This is so simple and yet so flavorful. I will be trying more Salmon recipes soon. Thank you!!

We were not pleased with this receipt.  It was tender and moist, without much flavor.  I did reduce oil but still felt it had way to much. I also added dried dill. I was disappointed.

This was a very good dish. I served it over brown rice and with some asparagus. I should have listened to one of the reviews and used less oil. When cooking, I only poured about half of the oil used in marinating over the fish. I threw the rest out. I cooked about 1 1/4 lbs of fish cut into 4 filets for 35 minutes. It was just right.

This turned out well. Seasoning and flavors were good. I didn't include quite so much oil as others suggested. 35 minutes in the oven was plenty - I think the fish could have come out a couple minutes earlier, but you just have to watch it.

This was my first time making Salmon (I normally prefer red snapper) and it was great! It was moist and the flavor suited the fish instead of masking it. A definite new favorite!

excellent recipe! The portions were just right and the marinade was so flavorful. If I made this again, I would put a little less salt though. I even kept the leftover marinade and used it with other dishes.

This salmon is absolutely amazing. I just added a bit of butter & fresh dill to the recipe. It would be hard to mess up if you follow the instructions & add your own touches!

Best salmon I've ever had.  Husband loved it also.  Thanks so much.  I actually use this marinade on my pork chops minus the garlic but will be adding the garlic to it now.

Marinade was just awesome, did not change a thing. I did mix up the marinade in the bottom of a casserole dish then set the fish flesh side down in the marinade to save myself a dirty bowl :) Served with roasted potatoes and fresh sliced tomatoes drizzled w/Greek Dressing and Mozzarella, this is a keeper! Thx!

Never cooked fish before in my entire life. Was a bit nervous. Made this for my meat loving BF (I'm a veggie). He loved it and licked the plate clean. Extremely easy to make. I did remove the skin first and marinated for about 45 minutes. Cooked 25-30 minutes.

This is my first time cooking salmon and it came out perfect. I followed the recipe as written except that i marinated the fillets in aluminium foil rather than putting them directly in the glass dish. My oven usually tends to be hotter and burn things so I put the timer to 30 mins and the salmon was juicy and flaky. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

We've made this recipe once a week the past month. It is really quite good. At first I wondered if it might be a little too strong on the seasoning side, but I like it. It is almost spicy in an herb way... just great!

Came out amazing!

Just a couple things, I used 2 tbsp of olive oil and a pinch more basil and parsley. Pepper's good, less salt. 35 minutes does the trick just right!

I also poured the marinade over brown rice after cooking.

So good!  I bought some wild caught Copper River Salmon and used this recipe, it was awesome!  For those reviewers who said it was dry, you obviously overcooked it.  I'd say the cooking time is too long, 30 minutes is perfect.  If you buy high quality, wild fish, you don't have to worry about under-cooking it.

I followed recipe to a T and was not thrilled, the salmon was cooked perfect but the taste with this combo of spices was just okay, there are way better pallet pleasing salmon recipes out there. Changes? not so much oil, and add something... maybe some dill or a cream sauce. Was good but not a 5 star recipe.

This was great! I modified based on some other suggestions: 2T of olive oil, 3T fresh lemon juice, 3 cloves garlic; marinated for 45 minutes and broiled on high for 6 minutes on each side. My husband loved it and was upset that I didn't make more. This will definitely be a frequent visitor at our table.

My daughter and I loved this! And we even used previously frozen Salmon. I can't wait to try it with fresh. This is a keeper.

I'm all about easy salmon dishes that are quick and tasty. This one was perfect, but since I didn't have basil on hand, I used tarragon and it worked just as well! If you're needing a quick weeknight dinner, I think this with some rice and veggies is healthy and delicious!

Disclaimer: I hate fish. I have never in my life liked fish. I've tried to make fish many times, and I still never like it. That said, I LOVED this. I followed the recommendations and doubled the garlic, reduced the olive oil to 2 tbs, reduced the salt in half (and that was even a bit much), and added a teaspoon of fresh dill. Marinated for an hour, then covered the casserole dish in foil and baked for 30 minutes. It came out perfectly flaky and not too soft, and so full of flavor. I ate a huge piece and was practically licking my plate! I'm not sure what made a fish-hater like me want to try this recipe, but I'm so, so glad I did. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

I made this last night for dinner and I must say if you follow the recipe, it makes a moist salmon. I gave it only a 3 because the wood planked salmon, found on this site, is soooo much better. I don't think I'll make this again. I'll just wait until I can prepare good salmon on the grill.

Awesome.  I cut the salt and the olive oil in half (hence the missing star), and doubled the garlic (we like garlic).  Super easy, my oven took the full 40ish minutes.

Made this last night using salmon and talapia and it was AMAZING!!!! I maranated all the fish together in a glass dish as directed. I used just a little less olive oil but measured out everything else. I baked the fish in foil all together laying it out flat in a 9x11 glass dish. Next time I will just bake it in the dish and cover the dish with foil to see if it turns out the same. I served this with long grain white rice and steamed veggies. I just topped the rice with the servings of fish and then poured the extra sauce over all. It is DELISH!! My mother in law, hubby, son. and grand kids all loved it!! I will make the recipe once a week because it's that good!! Thanks for the recipe LadyBlade!

My 11 year old daughter has been bugging me to cook salmon for dinner for some time. I thought I would surprise her and try this recipe today. I am so glad I did! The salmon was light, but flavorful and went well with a garden salad w/balsamic dressing, and green beans. Plus, I am trying to eat healthier and this recipe proves that you can enjoy a meal without all the fat and oil. This is now one of my "go to" recipes. Thanks for submitting!

Great recipe - flavouring is nice but the cooking time is far too long. We used 2 salmon fillets and cooked for 15 minutes in total in the oven and it was perfect.

When I made this dish my boyfriend cleaned his plate for the first time EVER!  This is also the first time I made salmon.  I didn't change the recipe much (just added extra garlic because we love garlic, used 1 tsp. of dried parsley because I didn't have fresh and unfortunately only had the lemon juice in the little plastic lemon-shaped container).  I didn't have time to marinate so I split the mixture between 2 pieces of salmon in individual sealed foil packets and it still turned out great.  I will definitely be making this dish again and again!  I will be trying other reviewers' suggestions on reducing the salt and oil next time.  I will also use fresh lemon juice a/or slices and limit baking to no more than 35 minutes.  Thought that 45 mins. may have been a slight bit too much.  I served this up with white rice and broccoli.  All in all a great dish!
UPDATE:  Tried using frozen salmon and it did not come out as good.  Used a baking dish another time and I prefer the foil method.  I think the juice of a whole lemon works better too.  30-35 minutes cooking time seems ideal.  I tried 25 minutes once and the salmon could have stood to cook longer. I don't think I will reduce the salt either.  I did so when I tried the marinade on chicken and it definitely needed the regular amount in the recipe.

Love this recipe.  It is so quick and easy.  I don't use the precise measurements, just toss it all in a ziploc bag, mix it up, and then put the salmon in the bag and let sit for about an hour or so.  I don't wrap the salmon individually, instead I put it all in a glass dished and loosely wrap with aluminum foil.  I bake for about 25 minutes and its done.  Perfection every time!

Let me start by saying that I am not a big fan of salmon, but this was tolerable...almost good!  After following other reviewer's suggestions, I used 2 Tbsp EVOO, 3/4 tsp. basil, 1/2 tsp. salt, scant 1/2 tsp. pepper, 3 Tbsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp. parsley, 2 cloves garlic, and about 1/4 tsp. of dill.  The only thing I would change for next time is to decrease the lemon juice to  2 Tbsp, as I found it a bit too 'lemony'.  Removing the skin before cooking, as someone suggested, really did seem to reduce the 'fishy' taste!  Thanks for that tip!

I made 3 thick filets and I cooked them for 40 min and they were perfect. I used extra virgin olive oil and since I was making an extra filet I put in a little extra of all the ingredients.  I am not a big salmon lover, so the fact that I enjoyed this was pretty exciting since salmon is so healthy.  My 12 year old son loved this also and he is a salmon lover.

Excellent recipe. I never made salmon before. I am not too much of a fish eater, but my boyfriend loves salmon. He ate half of my fish, and wanted more. I would definately make this again. I did make a few changes according to other reviews I saw on it. Used 3 TB oil, 2 TB butter and 2 TB lemon juice. fantastic!

I've never been a fan of salmon, but this recipe changes everything. It's so simple, but the marinade adds such a wonderfully refreshing flavor to the salmon. I left out the parsley since I didn't have any on hand, but the salmon was delicious just the same. I baked one small fillet for 35 minutes, and that was the perfect amount of time for a moist, flaky finish. I highly recommend this recipe if you want a light and flavorful salmon dish. Delish!

This was fantastic! I only had time to marinade the salmon for about 25 minutes, but it still had great flavor.  I ended up baking it for about 35 minutes at 350 and it came out great.  I'll definitely make this again!

I love, love this recipe!  I have been cooking it once a week-every 2 weeks for the past year, and my husband and kids loooove it!  My husband didn't like salmon until I made this.  He doesn't like fishy-fish, so I leave it in the oven for 5-10 more minutes to burn off the smell, and it comes out perfect!  Just keep checking it to make sure you don't burn the salmon.

I made this for my boyfriend and I and we both loved it.  I, already a salmon lover, would put it in my top five ways to enjoy salmon, and he, not a salmon lover, loved it!  He told me he would eat this dish three times a week- we've already had it twice :0)

WOW this was really good, and i only let it marinate for about 30 minutes and baked just covered with foil instead of individually....my fillets were smaller (I had 4 - 4oz)too so i decreased the cooking time to about 15 minutes. Definitely a keeper!!!

As much as I love seafood I can't give this more than three stars. I followed the directions exactly and while I loved it, my husband (who isn't really a big seafood person to begin with) said that "It tastes like canned cat food smells." If you are like me and trying this to get a non-seafood eater to like seafood, it probably isn't going to work. I won't be making this again.

Yummy!  This is very flavorful salmon. It goes great on top of a romaine salad w/ lettuce, tomato, cucumber, parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegarette  and a side of w/ lightly buttered and herbed toasted flatbread.   I used 1 tsp. of Morton's light salt and added 1/2 tsp. of Ms. Dash Extra Spicy because I watch my sodium but want to keep flavor.  I also accidentally bought lime instead of lemon juice at the grocery store and it still came out well.  There was a lot of oil in the pan at the end, so you may be able to cut back.  This one is a keeper!

This was a great tasting and easy salmon recipe! Although I must say, that after reading some reviews I made these small changes to the amounts: 3 tablespoons of oil (vs 6), 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, and added some dill. I was also running short on time, so I only marinated for about 40 minutes, and it was still great!!! Can't imagine the taste when I leave it for the 1 hour it suggests!!! Will definitely be making this again!!!

Good. The basil flavor was intense. I would try half of what is called for. I also baked the salmon with lemon slices on top. Really enhanced the flavor.

I have made this recipe twice now and my boyfriend loves it... we are trying to lose weight and have noticed that most healthy recipes are bland in flavor. But this is really good and the fish is seasoned perfectly. My five year old loved it too....and she doesn't normally like fish. I will keep this one forever. It's awesome over a fresh spring mix salad!

This was my first time ever making fish and this was fantastic!  I only made one piece of salmon so I adjusted the recipe accordingly and made the following changes: 1.5 TBS of olive oil and 1 TBS of melted butter.

I tripled this for a 2+ lb salmon fillet.  Following other suggestions, I reduced the olive oil to 2 tbsp (i.e. 6 tbsp for my tripled recipe), removed the skin from the salmon before marinating, and baked the salmon, covered, in the same baking dish in which I had marinated it.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I substituted 1/2 tbsp (1.5 tbsp in my tripled recipe) dried parsley.  This was a big hit!  It was very peppery, though, so I will probably halve the amount of black pepper next time.

This was easy and quick to make! I followed all directions as told, except I only added 5 tablespoons of olive oil. I thought that it needed more that 4 but less than 6 tablespoons. Overall, it got rave reviews from the hubby who doesn't really like fish! :)

I'm not a Salmon eater but I've learned it's really good for you and my husband likes it so I tried finding a recipe that might make it taste good to me. This is definitely the recipe! WOW what flavor!  I will without a doubt eat salmon on a regular basis now that I have this recipe!

This was really good!  I gave it 4 stars only cause I tweaked it to what other reviewers suggested.  But the result was definitely 5 stars, eventhough I only marinated it for 10 minutes.  I will definitely marinate longer next time though.  I made 4 portions but equivalent for 2 portions of salmon the changes I made were 1 T olive oil, 3/4 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 3 T lemon juice and 1 tsp dried parsley, oh and 1/2 tsp dried dillweed. After marinating for only 10 min. I pan fried it in a little more than 1 T of butter.  I flipped it once and in total cooked it for about 15 min.  I sprinkled more black pepper and dillweed on it when cooking and it turned out sooo good!  I am so happy that I found a way to cook salmon now that is not just butter, salt and pepper.  I will marinate it next time for 30 min to 1 hr, but even 10 minutes of marinating was delicious!!

This is a light marinade that allows the taste of the salmon to come through.  It is very simple and delicious.  I made the following changes:  4 cloves of garlic, 4 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of butter, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground pepper.  I also covered my entire baking dish with foil rather than wrapping individual pieces.  45 minutes was perfect for my one pound cut of salmon.

I am new to eating fish and was unsure how to bake salmon and this recipe made it very easy for me.  It tasted great and was very easy to make.  I only marinated the salmon for a half hour and the salmon still tasted great.

So easy!  I made some changes when I was in a hurry and out of some ingredients that I guess it could be a whole different recipe.  Instead of olive oil, I used 4 T of melted butter, 1 t dried garlic powder, and omitted the parsley. Instead of marinating, I just dipped the salmon in the mixture for about 1 min., then dipped it in bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper, then baked according to the instructions.  Turned out very good and my kids ate it!

This recipe was delicious.  The marinade did not overpower the salmon.  I baked mine for 20 minutes and probably will only bake it for 18 min. next time.  I feel like it continued to bake in the foil after I took it out of the oven.  The salmon was very moist and flavorful.  I will definitely bake it again!

Pretty good marinade. I used less olive oil but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was quick and easy, and added a nice little flavor to the fish. I'll keep it in rotation. Thanks.

Okay, I've been using this recipe for at least 2 years and it is absolutely the best salmon recipe ever! I do usually cut the olive oil in half and I always use dried parsley.

AWESOME FOR 1st TRY!!! This is my first attempt at making salmon. I went exactly by the recipe EXCEPT that I used dill (a couple of dashes) in my marinade. I placed the filets in a glass dish and marinaded for 30 min. turning every 5 min. Before I put it in the 375 oven, i melted 1tblsp unsalted butter with a couple dashes lemon juice and added it to the glass casserole dish(making sure I rubbed the filets in the butter and marinade mix). Covered in aluminum foil and baked @375 for 35 min. I served w/softened baby carrots & butter & herb rice. My fiance and I LOVED IT!! AWESOME RECIPE!!! I can't wait to make it for my friends and family!!

This recipe was very good! I did make a couple of changes: I cut the oil down to 2 T and added a tablespoon of melted butter.  I also added a tbsp of fresh dill and a tbsp of fresh parsley. I also added 3 tbsp of fresh lemon juice. I will definitely make this recipe again!

My family does not care for salmon, however after tasting this dish it has been a weekly favorite.  This dish goes well with a rice salad.

This was delicious. Very easy and ingredients were things that I had on hand. I was planning to grill but due to a winter storm needed to bake the salmon inside and this was even better than grilled.

My first time making Salmon. I was so nervous because my kids nor I had ever had it. I followed the recipe and it was great. No fishy taste and it was not a bit dry. We had it on a bed of herbed rice surrounded by steamed broccoli. It is now my 9 year old daughters favorite meal. She had 3 helpings to herself! We used the extra juice to pour on top of the whole meal.

My husband liked this recipe. I just poured the marinade over the fish (forgot to wait an hour) and baked it for 15 minutes and it was done! I guess the fillets were pretty thin (and previously frozen).

Great marinade for more than just salmon. I've tried this with tilapia, and rock fish and it is delicious. A few variations I've made is to use fresh basil and lemon zest. I poach the fish in parchment paper (en papillote) instead of foil. For those of you who try to avoid aluminum, this is a great alternative. I love garlic and herbs so I adjust the quantities to my liking. This recipe is pretty fool proof so have fun with it and modify it to your tastes. I've added red pepper flakes and capers. I've even made a pesto out of all the ingredients just to switch it up. It is the first dish I ever cooked for my husband (when we started dating) and he still loves it. To this day he says it's his favorite salmon. Enjoy!

This was fabulous.  I cut the oil in half and it was perfect.  If you like your salmon less done as I do, you might want to make two foil packages and take one out ten minutes earlier.

This was a great recipe!  I am always looking for new ways to make salmon and this was delicious.  I served over brown rice.  The only thing I would do different is use less salt.

Great recipe and gave salmon wonderful flavor!  Loved it!  (I used fresh basil instead of dried and took skin off salmon before marinating - marinated it in ziplock bag).

This was so good!  I cut the oil down to about 4 tbsp, and marinated it in a ziploc instead of a pan.  I also put foil over the pan when baking instead of wrapping it around the salmon, and it still turned out amazing!  Served with rice pilaf and asparagus...mmm yum!!  Definintely keeping this one on hand!

Very good with minimal effort. I did as others did and cut the oil to 2 tbsp and found it was more than enough. Also upped the lemon and added a pinch of Old Bay. Will definitely make again!

For myself I did not like this recipe as stated. I needed some crunch to the dish as the fish was way to mushy. I made with pasta shells and green beans. It did taste ok and was easy but the meal for me was mush. My boyfriend on the other hand loved it. He rarely goes back for seconds and hates leftovers. For him this dish was the ticket as he had 2 pieces plus ate the leftovers the very next day. I made the recipe as stated except I used 4 filets instead of 2. I will make again only because he liked but next time i'll broil it or pan fry to get a bit crispier texture for my taste. Thank you for a winner with the BF.

Made this last night. It was incredibly easy to put the marinade together. I flipped it every quarter hour or so during the hour-long marinading process, so it got completely coated, and then baked it for 40 minutes. When I opened the tin foil to remove the fish, I actually had to use a wide spatula, because the fish kept trying to fall apart, it was that moist! And the taste was amazing too!

My husband typically is the one who preps & grills the salmon, but I wanted to try something different from the usual coating fish in butter and seasoning salt. I decreased the oil and used fresh dill instead of parsley (didn't have any) and it turned out great! Even my husband raved about it! Definately give this a try.

I made this earlier today for dinner.  I made it exactly as the recipe instructed, however, I did use slightly larger filets.  The final product was TOTALLY AMAZING!!  I paired the filets with sides of red mashed potatoes and veggies.  My hubby and I both scarfed the dinner up with glee!!  Thank you so much, LadyBlade, for this wonderful recipe!!

Great recipe! I made this last night using four 4-oz fillets. I checked them at 35 min but put them back in for 5 more. I think I could've taken them out at 35 though. The salmon was very moist and juicy. Next time I will take them out at 35 min so they aren't as chewy. In the marinade I didn't measure the olive oil, just used my best judgment. My boyfriend liked this recipe and I will make it again!

Super easy- followed the advice from previous reviews adn it came out great. I would have liked to have a bit more liquid to go with my rice so next time i'll add a little extra lemon juice. Tip with the lemon juice- microwave your halved lemon  (i used fresh) for 10-15 seconds and the juicing is much easier.

After reading some positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. Like some of the reviewers, I also reduced the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp and of olive oil to 1 tbsp; and the result was great! I don't anyone should to put more than that. Another thing is that my salmon was done a bit sooner than the recipe's time. Overall, the mixture of basil, garlic, and lemon juice really makes the aroma and taste unique; and lets you really taste the delicious salmon.

I made this salmon for my boyfriend's birthday, and we both loved it! As was suggested by other reviewers, I used only 2 tbsp of olive oil. This was very good quality garlic flavoured olive oil, and as a result I did not need to use the cloves of garlic. I also used slightly more lemon juice, and ground some fresh ginger root into the marinade.  I actually used 3 fillets of salmon with this recipe (just in case we'd want seconds.. which we did) so there wasn't as much of it. As a result I rubbed the marinade well into each fillet. Then I stacked the fillets into a plastic bowl, wrapped the bowl in a plastic bag and marinated it in the fridge for about 3 hours. After the 3 hours I wrapped the fish in aluminum foil and baked it on a cookie sheet for the given amount of time.  The flavour really penetrated the fish all throughout... it was delicious, will definitely make it again!

Delicious! I just eyeballed the olive oil....... and also thought it sounded like too much salt so I put in 1/2 tsp. and it was plenty. Next time I might cut back on the basil, esp. when I add some dill weed. More lemon juice is also good. I do think it would be better to marinate for at least 3 hours or even overnight. I let it marinate for only an hour and it was great, but I could tell the flavors had not gone entirely through. I baked 25 min. and guessed 20 would have been OK. I used small boneless pieces.

I followed the recipe exactly.  This is fabulous.  I will cut back on the salt to at least half next time.  I don't know if all the oil is necessary, so I may try and cut back on it as well.

What a delicious way to prepare salmon! I didn't use the packets, though. I marinated it for 4 hours, poured the excess marinade off, then baked the filets for 30 minutes in a 375 degree oven. Awesome marinade!

Delicious!  I ran out of lemon juice, so I subbed fresh ruby red grapefruit juice, and it was great!  Next time, I will cut the salt in half, though. Thanks!

This was really good - only change I made was 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil and I added more spices than the recipe called for.  Also, used boneless salmon and put in the dish and then covered with aluminum foil.  We'll definitely try again!

WOW! This was fantastic. One major change - I didn't use this as a marinade due to time constraints, but it still tasted amazing. I used three garlic cloves (personal preference) and only 3 Tbsp of olive oil. Before wrapping the salmon in foil, I put a few slices of onion on top.

This recipe is very good and very easy.  I just place the salmon in tin foil, throw all the ingredients on top, wrap it up, and cook on the George Foreman until its done.  One of my favorite ways to make salmon.

I made this recipe for my mother (new to a restricted sodium diabetic diet), who is missing her salt.  I followed it exactly with the 3 following exceptions: 1. I used no salt at all 2: I cut the olive oil to 3 tablespoons (re: comments in other reviews) 3. I marinated the salmon for 3 hours (see above).  I cooked it at 375 for 30 minutes - next time if I marinate that long, I will check it at 20 minutes.  We both loved it and neither of us felt it needed any additional seasoning.  This was easy and while salmon has been one of my lesser favorite fish, I certainly will fix this many times again.  Thanks, LADYBLADE.

This is wonderful; imparts a great flavor to the salmon and keeps it so moist and tender.  You may want to cut back on the salt a bit, as I will next time.  Anyway, husband compared it to a dish from a very expensive restaurant at which we've eaten.

Very good.  We eat salmon every week, and I wanted to try a different but easy recipe.  I adjusted the amount of oil after reading some of the other reviews.  I used 2 TBS olive oil and added 1 TBS of melted butter.  I also added lemon pepper in lieu of black pepper.  Even my fussy 3.5 yr old ate it all!  This is a keeper.

This was excellent! I like many others reduced the oil and added more garlic (I love garlic), it was soo good. I ate it over a bed of white rice and a nice side mediteranean salad.

This was really delicious although I don't think it needs to be cooked for that long, I guess it depends on your personal taste. Also I did what some of the other reviewers did and just put the salmon in a baking dish and tightly wraped with foil. As far as the ingredients are concerned I just put in what I think is appropriate, what feels right. Combining corriander with the parsley is nice too. I'm going to make it again tonight as I got some nice fresh salmon this morning at the Gleadle Street market in Richmond, Melbourne, Australia. It goes really well with mashed potato and green beens. Make sure you save the juice out of the baking dish to pour over salmon and especially the mashed potato. Bon Apetit.

This is an easy, tasty, and healthy recipe for salmon. I left out the parsley because I didn't have any on hand and marinated the salmon overnight. It came out tender and moist; the flavor was delicious but not overpowering.

YUM YUM YUM! My salmon came out perfect!  Moist and delicious.  I added a lot more garlic and a put in a few more dashes of lemon juices.  I didn't have fresh basil but used dried, and it still came out perfect.  Also, added a bit more pepper to the mix.  I wrapped the entire salmon filet in a foil "bag" and it came out perfect.  My bf is super picky and he loved this dish!  Can't wait to make it again.

My fish turned out a little dry.  I might try cooking it for less time.  The flavor was good, and it was easy to make.

Maybe it'll be better if I marinate instead of just throwing it in the oven... otherwise, it's just ok.

Delicious marinade!  I think this was the best fish marinade we've tried so far, and I'll certainly keep making it.

I follow the recipe exactly and it's amazing every time!  In the summertime, I skip the foil and throw the salmon filets straight on the grill.
Thanks for a great recipe!

I love salmon, and for the first time ever, it was mushy and tasteless.  I dont know if I marinated it for too long (70 min) or if I should blame the fish.  I will try again.

All I can say is WOW!! This is the best recipe I have EVER tried for salmon. I had grown tired with going the "old bay seasoning route", so we just stopped having salmon in my house. This recipe has totally changed that, it is simply delicious as is. You have got to try it.

First off 35-45 mins is way too long to cook salmon more like 12-15 mins on 400. I thought the garlic and lemon went well together but I was unimpressed. I ate it without a problem but not good enough for me to make again sorry.

This was delightful! I am not even a seafood fan, but for some reason had some frozen salmon fillets on hand;  the flavors mingled perfectly.  Served it with brown rice and brussels sprouts for a healthy, tasty dinner.

Excellent.  We had some fresh coho salmon from Lake Michigan, and it was wonderful. We'll definately make this again and again. Even my husband, the catcher of the fish was impressed!

My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  We used a 1.5 lb salmon filet from the butcher and still only used about 2.5 T olive oil with a bit of dill and extra lemon juice.  I also sliced lemon and placed it on top of the salmon as it marinated for 2.5 hours.  Rather than broilig, we took advantage of the beautiful day and grilled the salmon (10 min. per inch of thickness).  It was very simple and delicious.  Served over brown rice and a side of grilled asparagus, zucchini, squash, green/red peppers and mushrooms.

AWESOME RECIPE!  This turned out great.  It was my first time baking fish and it couldn't have tasted any better.  My father in law has proclaimed this to be his favorite recipe that I've made.  Everyone enjoyed this dish.  I also cut the olive oil to 2T and did NOT wrap each filet, but simply covered the baking dish instead.  Simple recipe- Quite tasty.  Rave reviews from all who ate it- thanks for sharing!

This recipe was easy and very tasty. Besides eyeballing the basil and parsley, I followed the recipe exactly. The salmon came out moist, tender and full of flavor. The only thing I would change is the amount of salt suggested (use less next time), otherwise, absolutely perfect.

I had planned to make this as written, and then decided I wanted to use my oven for sweet potato fries....so I ended up using this marinade w/the following modifications, due to tastes/reviews:  2 T. olive oil, 1 T. melted butter,1/2 tsp salt, 3 T lemon juice, 1 tsp dried parsley, tsp of dill weed, and a tsp of garlic salt. I didn't have much time to allow them to marinade (~15 min) before I sauteed them on the stove in heated olive oil.  They took about 20-25 mins to cook stove top (at the end, I ended up flaking one stubborn piece into pieces to hurry the process...I actually found i preferred it this way and will do it like this in the future).  I am looking forward to trying this in the stove in foil packets, as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was given a 5 star rating by my DH whose idea of eating fish, is well ah hm...battered and fried. Perfect recipe for low carb dieting and the taste is superb. I skipped a few steps and it was still awesome. I lined a glass baking dish (long enough for my fillet) with excess non stick foil, combined olive oil, herbs, garlic and added some butter, too. Heated in microwave to melt butter, poured half over one side of the salmon fillet, right over the foil, and flip the fish and poured the rest over the other side, closed up the foil and popped it into the oven while preheating. So, I skipped the marinating "2 hrs". It was fabulous and I highly recommend this for even those who are squeemish about eating fish. Salmon is never a fishy-fish, unless it is not very fresh. Buy your salmon fresh when you are near the sea or buy it flash frozen, so that the integrity and freshness aren't lost in transit.

Yummy, yummy.  MY husband and I LOVED this.  I think the kids found it a bit heavy.  I did scale back a little on the olive oil and took the skin off beforehand.  My only complaint was the lingering cooking smells. I had to open all my windows  (it was a cold rainy day) otherwise DELISH!

AWESOME!  This was great.  I made it exactly as posted, but I had a much larger piece of salmon, so I just about doubled everything.  It was delicious!  I will always make my salmon this way now.  Thanks for a great recipe!
I originally thought it was a typo to cook it that long, but it was perfect.

Believe it or not, this was my first taste of salmon! I found this recipe to be easy, flavorful, and healthy. Born and raised in the Midwest I'm a little afraid of seafood but getting a variety of lean proteins into our diets seemed worth the risk.  This one paid off.  We enjoyed this meal and found the salmon to be surprisingly un-fishy.  I served it with some baked asparagus and "oven brown rice" from this site.  Great meal.

This recipe surprised me. As I was making it I was thinking to myself how oily it looked and how odd it smelled. Don't be fooled, the amount of flavor that will come out when it is baking is incredible. I absolutely loved the taste of chopped fresh parsley and I would NOT recommend substituting it for anything else. I have become a true believer of this recipe and will be making this for many years to come.

My husband made this for us when a friend brought over some fresh salmon. Great! We did put plastic over the fish in the fridge while marinating and turned it part way through the hour marination time. Served with rice and veggies. We will be having this again.

Wow! This was the best salmon and SOOOOO easy to prepare. I didn't use light olive oil because all I had was the regular. It was still fantastic, probably just a little more fattening.

This was just OK.  The flavor just wasn't that strong perhaps it could use more lemon juice, fresh lemon slices, or even dill as recommended by others. Based upon the reviews, I reduced the oil and would recommend that to everyone.  Although I had fresh salmon shipped from Alaska, the recipe was unmemorable.  I won't make this one again...my family and I liked the Grilled Salmon I (on this website) better.  Sorry.

Delicious! I made this exactly according to the recipe, but next time I might cut down on the olive oil a bit. The salmon turned out very moist, and my kitchen didn't smell like fish for days after I baked the fish! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

So good and healthy.  I liked the idea of wrapping them individually in foil.  I also cut the oil in half and added 2T of butter, and used dried parsley since I didn't have any fresh on hand.  Was low on time so didn't marinate for more than 10 minutes, and still came out great!  Very yummy on jasmine rice.

Well, until last week, I had never had or prepared home-cooked salmon fillets. :) We're trying to get more Omega-3's, and having more salmon is a wonderful way. I cut the olive oil down to about 2 TBS, used 1 TBS of melted butter (as recommended by other reviewers!), and omitted the parsley. It was fabulous! I've made it twice, once with lemon (recommended!) and once with lime juice as we ran out of lemon (and it tasted a little weird). I definitely recommend this salmon with the skin removed and with lemon! A shake of dried dill is also a nice addition. I have problems with overcooking the fish, maybe that'll get better with time. Thanks so much for sharing, Norma! Our four-year-old loves this recipe!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I was doubtful once I got the marinade finished.  I thought that the garlic smell was overpowering while baking the salmon, but I was wrong!  My husband just recently traveled for business and he said this dish was better than two of the salmon dishes he ordered while away.....We'll definitely be using this recipe again.  I served it with a dill sauce.  Yum.

Simply Divine!  My first time to bake salmon and it was really flavorful.  My husband really enjoyed it too.  Made it with the Almond Wild Rice dish and steamed broccoli.  Will make this again soon.  I followed the advice of several reviewers and reduced the oil to 2T instead of 6T, reduced the salt by half, and added dill.  It turned out great!

I love salmon so I try different recipes all the time.  This is one of my favorates.    I do not like over cooked salmon at all so I cooked my salmon uncover but only for about 15minute on a preheated oven.  any longer is too cooked.

Yummy! I skinned the fish put it in the bag with the marinade: 2 cloves garlic, 2 T olive oil, 3/4 t basil, 1/2 t salt, 1 t pepper, 3 T lemon juice, 1 t dried parsley.  Dumped it all in a glass dish & covered it with foil & baked for 35 mins. After putting fish on the plates, I added 1 T melted butter to the sauce & poured it over white rice. Rosemary carrots from this site on the side. Very good, no fishy smell or taste. I wanted to start serving fish once or twice a week to add some healthier meals to our menu & this was just wonderful. Thank you.

Great and easy recipe....I followed one of the suggestions and put lemon slices over the salmon before sealing the foil pouch, and it came out light and citrusy!  Also added fresh dill to the marinade.  Tasty recipe for baked salmon, the best I've come across yet!

Recipe was Great!!!!!
We are trying to add fish to our diet but we are not big on fish.
This recipe was great as my first attempt at making fish.
I made a few changes since I prepared 4 fillets 

This is defiantly a keeper…

Well, I have mixed reviews for this recipe.  I don't really like salmon but I tried it anyway.  I'm trying to be healthy and eat it, but no luck.  I couldn't stomach more than one bite.  My husband on the other hand, loved it!  He ate his and mine and was very impressed.  It looked good and I really wanted to like it.  Oh well. :-)

So good! I used fresh basil instead of dried and I've made it about 3 times now. The last time, I didn't have time to marinate it for an hour and it still came out delicious.

WOW! So easy and SOOOO GOOD! No muss...no fuss! Clean up was a snap too! The only changes I made were these: used fresh Basil...used season salt instead of regular salt.... and added about 1/2 teaspoon of dehydrated Cilantro. This ones a 500% keeper in this house!

Great recipe thanks for sharing- lots of flavor!! The only thing is there was too much marinade for the amount of fish- luckily I used moer than the recipe called for! The only thing I did different was put sliced lemon and onion on the top! Delicious and healthy!

The only reason I am giving this a 4 rating is that I have not tried it as yet.   Just reading it makes me feel hungry and I have lots of fresh herbs growing that will certainly be used.  Going to try it on my gourmet daughter tomorrow.

Delicious! Our own touch is to also use fresh basil, and more lemon.

This is a great recipe!  I had made it for my brother-in-law's rehearsal dinner and everyone loved it!  It was so easy and quick and tastes delicous! I'd serve some extra lemon wedges on the side too, for those who like very lemony fish (me).

I didn't really like salmon that much until I tried this recipe.  My husband and I eat this just about once a week now. I also like to add a teaspoon of dill like other people have suggested.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I loved this recipe!  I had been trying out different baked salmon recipes and none have compared to this one.  I used a little less salt and pepper and instead a pure garlic I used garlic powder and it came out absolutely delicious.  The lemon juice gives it a great flavor and sealing it in the aluminum foil while baking makes it come out very moist.  My boyfriend also loved it and wants me to use this recipe for salmon all the time.  This one is definitely a keeper!

Oh my!  This was a delicious way to prepare salmon.  I marinated just under an hour, and hubby's not a big herb fan so the basil and parsley we're out the door...but it turned out really moist and flavorful anyway.  Thanks for the post!!

An instant keeper. My family loved it. I didn't have basil, so I used tarragon, and a bit of oregano. I used a second layer of aluminum foil, and was able to seal it up tightly. As my salmon was only half thawed, I needed to cook it closer to 55 minutes. It came out very tender, tasty, and moist. I'll definitely make it again.

This is a tasty and esy way to fix salmon.  I would let it marinate for a while to let the flavors really come through.  Leftovers are fantastic too!

I'm sorry to say I didn't love this recipe. It wasn't bad at all, but it just didn't really blow me away. I prefer a stronger marinade for salmon--this marinade seems like it would work much better with white fish. It did smell wonderful while baking, and using the foil packets made the salmon nice and juicy. I'll probably try this recipe again with white fish, but not with salmon.

This is excellent! My boyfriend and I both really liked this. I made it for our Easter dinner and it worked really well, time wise, with the side dishes. It was nice to let it sit in the fridge marinating while I prepped the side dishes.

We love salmon and this deserves 6 stars!!!  So easy and great flavor.  I took some others tips and only used 2 tbs of olive oil and added little melted butter.  Also marinated this for 4 hours and baked in the glass dish, covered with foil.

This makes excellent salmon. One healthy option that is good is to reduce the oil and increase the lemon juice a little. It works great for the grill.

It was nice!  We enjoyed it but only gave it 4 stars as we reserve 5 for recipes that blow our socks off.  I put in a couple of shakes of salt not 1 tsp (it does not need it).  I also would recommend putting less olive oil.  Other then that it was good as it was.

I made this recipe for company.Raised the yield to 4 and used oiled parchment paper instead of foil.  
Rave reviews.  My husband says it the best salmon I've ever made. The company enjoyed it so much they requested for their next visit. I rate it 5+.  My thanks to Norma.

This is some of the best salmon I have ever had.  I really enjoyed it!  I marinated it for about 4 hours and used only 1/2 the called for oil.  It turned out perfect!

This recipe was a tad bit salty for me (and I do love salt, so it's not that) but got rave reviews from the person who requested fish. I also used red sock-eye salmon and it may have been a little too strong for that type. It's probably a first-time recipe thing... I will certainly make it again, maybe with a few modifications.

Not bad. Easy to make because the ingredients are always on hand. I added quite a bit of red wine to boost the flavour (more than a quarter cup) and cut the salt in half. Good, but not great if you like bold flavours like cajun and thai...

I decided to cook this for a recent dinner party and I couldn't be more pleased with the results!  It was fantastic and people were complimenting me all night!  I did make a few modifications based on the suggestions by others.  I decreased the amount of salt by half and used only half of the olive oil.  I also let the fish marinate all day (about 6 hours). The marinade did not smell very delicious so I had my doubts but the end result was amazing!  Thanks for the excellent recipe Norma!

My family and I have never liked fish.  I thought this might be the recipe.  I am sure it is great if you like fish but it did not make us fish eaters for even one night.

Incredible. So moist! My boyfriend loves salmon, and he praised this recipe. Followed the advice of others in the reviews and added some melted butter and a few teaspoons of white wine. Superb, can't wait to cook it next week!

This is real good, and I'm not even a great lover of fish, we try to eat more salmon since it is so good for you.  I marinated it and baked it in the same covered glass dish.  Used a little less oil.  Easy too! Thanks  Susie

Very, very good!  I used the marinade with 1 1/2 pounds of salmon and it was still strongly flavored.  The only change that I might make next time is to cut the salt in half.  I asked my husband if I should make this again and his response was "as much as possible!"

I couldn't cook fish before this recipe. I don't like fish so it is hard to make it. My husband on the other hand loves it. I made this recipe for him and he can't wait for me to make it again.

Even though you have to wait awhile to finally eat this, it's easy to throw together and worth the wait. I had two 4 oz. filets, but I kept the marinade amount the same. However, I only had to cook them for 25 minutes or so. We ate this with wild rice, and it was excellent!

I absolutely love this recipe. The salmon turns out sooo moist and flavorful, but still tastes like salmon. I generally find that it takes 30 mins to cook with a thick filet... if you're using a thin cut, cut the cooking time almost in half. You want your salmon to be moist and "pink" in the center... not light. I would also say that if you like fish, this is best with a thick cut.... the herbs are wonderful as a "coat" but not as the primary flavor.

This salmon was so flavorful. I marinated my fish for 48 hours in a ziplock bag, I also used fresh basil and fresh parsely because I had them on hand. I cut my olive oil down to 4.5 Tablespoons and thought that I could have cut it down a little more. I cooked it in the foil for 35 minutes and it was perfect.  Great/easy recipe.

This is a FABULICIOUS recipe! My husband and I like fish a bit more lemony so I doubled the lemon juice. It turned out PERFECT. However, I will cut back on the oil but nonetheless, a definite keeper!!!! Thanks Norma!

Very good.  I reduced the olive oil and used 2 tablespoons of the minced garlic in olive oil per other reviewer's suggestions.  I also
substituted 2 teaspoons Mrs. Dash
original for the salt and pepper.

This was so delicious, I couldnt believe how easy this was to make.
It was very light, and the taste of the oil, lemon and garlic together was simple yet so elegant.  This one's a winner.

WOW!  I usually don't have the patience for marinades, but this one is so simple and delicious it's well worth the effort.  Also very easy to season to taste -- I used about half the olive oil and double the garlic and it turned out fabulous.  Will definitely make again, and can't wait to impress guests with this recipe!

This is a pretty good recipe - but way too much olive oil. I used only 3 Tbsp. I also made the mistake of cooking it on the George Foreman which I think dried it out.  I have made similar salmon recipes in the oven in foil and I think that is the best way to get a moist salmon.

Loved this recipe...YUM. Did cut back on the olive oil to 3 tbspoons left everything else the same. I buy the salmon fillets at Costco and adjust the recipe accordingly. Husband loves it even my 3 year old son likes it. Thanks for the recipe Norma. Will keep this one w/family recipes.

Very flavorful.  We ended up throwing them on the grill, which made them extra delicious.  I will definitely make this again sometime.

Sorry, but this one didn't work out. The marinade overpowered the subtle taste of the salmon. I found it necessary to scrape off the coating to make the fish edible. I rarely use tartar sauce with salmon, but had to this time. I would cut way back on the pepper, and perhaps reduce the oil by 1 tablespoon if I tried this recipe again.

This was a good recipe, although not the best I've ever had.  I had everything on hand, and some fresh caught salmon was given to me, so I gave it a try.

I am not a salmon (or any fish) fan but this recipe is delicious!!  I made it for valentines day and it has been requested by my family at least monthly.  That is something considering my chidren (11 and 7) are very picky!!
I would certainly recommend this to anyone!

One of the best recipes for salmon that I've ever tasted.  I doubled the recipe and between my boyfriend and I...no left overs!  The marinade itself was very tasty, I think I'll make that by itself some time just to dip fresh Italian bread in.

Just a few spices sounds like no big deal, but this really was the best salmon I've ever made.  I made it as is and wouldn't change a thing.  After marinating the salmon for 1 hour, I just covered the pan with tin foil and baked to make it easier.  I made 3 fillets with the amount of marinade and had plenty leftover, but still wouldn't adjust anything next time.

Excellent recipe!  This was my first fish recipe and it was very easy and turned out perfect.  Even my wife, who doesn't care for fish, enjoyed it.

It was a little salty though, so I'll probably cut the salt in half next time.

This is definitely a keeper.  I marinated the fish (flesh side down/skin side up)in a pyrex baking dish in the fridge...without turning it.  To bake, I covered the dish with foil and cooked for the full 45 minutes.  It turned out great and was sooooo easy.  The only change I will make next time will be to cut out the salt in the marinade.  With the lemon juice it didn't need the salt.  As is it was a little too salty.  But all in all a wonderful addition to my recipe file!

This was a very good recipe.  I would recommend using all of the oil in the marinade.  But only pour about half of the marinade over the fish when cooking.  My 5 year old who won't try anything "different" really liked this.  My husband was pleasantly surpised that it didn't taste as fishy as he expected.  I will definately make this recipe again.

This is a great, easy recipe and has so much flavor for so few ingredients.  I used half the oil as recommended by other reviewers and the only thing I added was some thinly sliced onions to the marinade.  A definite keeper.

This was a very flavourful recipe!  I will make it again!  A nice break from the common dill flavour that often goes with salmon. I do agree with the comments about the oil and would cut back on it ever so slightly next time. Thanks for this great recipe!

My husband and I loved this, and even my children liked it. I doubled all the ingredients except the oil and it was perfect. I made sure to set the fish down on a paper towel for a minute before serving it...I just do not like the extra oil pooling on my plate.

I thought the reheated leftovers tasted even better then when it first came out of the oven!  Next time I would cut the olive oil in half, but beides that - this dish is fantasic!  Thanks for the recipe - I'll definitly make this again!

The salmon was a pale beige and was overcooked for me.  I knew 35 minutes sounded like too long a time to cook it.  The flavor was great, but I did a combo of oil and butter and added more lemon than it calls for.  I have an oven thermometer so I know the temp was right- next time I would take it out much sooner.

Delicious. I like to sprinkle the seasoning on top of the fish rather than premix as recommended. It makes for a lighter, more delicate dish.

I actually didn't think that this would be that great since the ingredients were so basic. But it's awesome! It reminds me of that garlic-broiled shrimp that you get at Red Lobster (etc). Sooo good!!!

Although this did taste wonderful, I have to give it 4 stars because I thought it had a bit too much seasoning (dried basil and pepper). With a few alterations, I will definently make this again!

A fine recipe for the household spice cabinet.  I used steelhead and the flavor was exceptional. I also added lemon pepper for zest. Congrats to Norma for a great recipe.

Pretty average seasoning for salmon... was looking for something exotic.

We followed the recipe to the letter and it comes out fantastic.  Some may prefer a shorter cooking time for more tender salmon, though I doubt it could possibly taste any better!

I usually prepare the marinade with only 4 Tbs. olive oil just to cut down on the fat.  I also increase the lemon juice to 2 Tbs.  This has become one of my favorites, and I never really liked salmon before.  I usually serve it with plain white rice and steamed asparagus spears.  Very simple.  Thanks!

This recipe was extremely easy to make and it turned out DELICIOUS!!!!  It was my first time making salmon and I had no problem.  The only thing I would change is the baking time in the oven. Another poster was correct in advising to adjust the time to 25 minutes.  Regardless, we loved it and wouldn't change one ingredient.  Thanks!!!

This salmon was SO GOOD! I didn't have any parsley, and it was great without it. I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch! Would probably work well with chicken breasts.

This is absolutely the best salmon recipe I've made!  I didn't have any lemon juice so I added some lemon-pepper seasoning I had.  Even my 1 year old son loved it!  Next time I'm making more!

It didn't turn out as great as I planned it to be. I made this for Valentines Day for my boyfriend, hoping it would be a romantic and enjoyable dinner. It might just be me, but the salmon needed more flavor to it. It wasn't dry at all, but it wasn't entirely superb either.

Wow! This was terrific! It was my first time making salmon and it was so easy! When it was done cooking, the skin just slid off. I used a TBS real basil and 1 tsp dried parsley instead and it was great. Perhaps I would use a little less olive oil than it called for next time. It's definitely a keeper! Thanks!

What a great way to fix my favorite fish! Very good taste, seasoned just right! The heck with going out to the fancy seafood restaurants, fix a nice salad, bake a couple of potatoes, open a nice bottle of wine and have a great meal at home. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a nice recipe for salmon, although not my favorite.  My husband enjoyed this more than I did.  It didn't look or smell very appetizing to me and the lemon juice overpowered the other flavors.

This was a very tasty dish, I tripled the recipe because I had to serve 6 people.  I did cook it a little too long, but it still came out excellent.  Just be careful not to cook it longer than 40 minutes because then it begins to dry out.  A variation I did add for my husband is about a tbsp of juice from my husbands banana peppers to the marinade and about ten banana peppers to it while cooking.

I made this on Tuesday for our first month  anniversary, and my husband loved it!  He said it was the best dish I've ever cooked.  I served it with the Rice-a-Roni rice pilaf and asparagus.  Asparagus was steamed (boil water in a pot, leave the asparagus in there for 3 minutes), and once drained, I melted margarine on top.  I also left it in the oven for 40 minutes, and then broiled it for 5 more minutes.  He absolutely loved it.

I have never made salmon before and this recipe was super easy and very tasty!  I placed two slices of lemon on each fillet before sealing the foil, which really added some flavor.  Also, I only cooked it for 20 minutes.  I think any more than than, it would have been very dry.  Give this one a shot!

The fish was so moist and delicious. I added a little bread crumbs and sliced almonds at the end. I would maybe decrease the salt dosage since it was a little salty. very easy and had all the ingredients! will make again!

This is the easiest and best salmon recipe I've ever had.  I have passed it along to friends and they love it also.  You don't even need all the ingredents.  I substituted lemon pepper for lemon juice and it turned out great!  Thank you.

This recipe was super yummy!! Thank you for sharing it with us.  I didn't use as much oil and I doubled on the lemon juice.  I also served it with a side of dill sauce... DELICIOUS!! Thanks again, Michi in Miami

Great recipe!  Next time I will probably reduce the amount of basil, as it overpowered the fish.  I also just covered the baking dish with foil and cooked it that way.  Great moist, flaky fish.

This recipe resulted in a very moist fish, but I didn't think the flavor was too great.  I think you could easily reduce the oil by about half, and maybe more lemon joice or some lemon zest would improve the flavor...

The first time I tasted this dish, I thought I was in heaven...It was super delicious! I used fresh basil instead of the dried basil and increased the amount of gralic and lemon. I have made it several times since!

terrrrific!  The cold leftovers were just as good as the warm version the night before.  I didn't fool with wrapping the fish in foil before baking; I just covered the marinating dish and baked the whole thing. It was wonderfully moist and flavorful.  My guy thought so too.

This was my 1st time trying this recipe and it was great!  Very simple and easy to make.  I cut it up over a homemade ceasar salad with light Ranch dressing and my entire office complimented me on how delicious the salmon smelled.

Almost perfect, so I played around with this one for a few months. I cut down on the basil.  Added 1/4 cup of wine and 7-8 dashes of Franks Red Hot Sauce.  Left out the salt, added 4 pats of salted butter to the top of the salmon.  After baking, I pan fried it searing hot for 3 minutes with a spash of the marinade.  Perfect!  If you like this as a meal, try making it an appetizer.  Put spoonfuls of the cooked salmon on crackers and drip a little of the sauce it cooked in.  You'll run out fast!!!

I'm sorry, but I seem to be in the majority here.  We thought this recipe was just awful.  Neither my hubby or I finished what was on our plate, and I love fish almost any way.  Too lemony and too salty.

Really liked this recipe. However,the recipe needs some high quality salted butter to perfect it. I topped off the salmon with a decent amount of butter before baking it and it turned out amazing.

Excellent recipe. I added a little more herbs to my take. Paprika, pepper, sea salt, oregano, basil, and Italian seasoned bread crumbs for a little crunch. Lots of lemon zest and juice as well. Served with steamed broccoli and steamed brown rice with infused vegetables. I used avocado cold pressed oil for the marinade and cooking. Thanks! Buen Provecho!

My family loved it. I did cut the amount of pepper in half. I will make this again but next time I will cut all the spices in half as the seasoning was a little strong. Also I only marinated the meat for about 15 min instead of the hour as i was short on time, my sister preferred it this way.

The salmon was too well done, this was probably because the salmon steaks were too small. I will buy larger steaks in the future.  Loved the recipe.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I baked it for 35 minutes at 375 and that was perfect timing.

I decreased Olive Oil to 2 tablespoons and increased Lemon juice to 2 tablespoons.  I had no parsley, I substituted with celery flakes. I removed the aluminum foil halfway through baking time.  SO GOOD

Delicious. I didn't have a couple of the ingredients so I substituted Garlic Salt for the Garlic cloves... It turned out salty. I'll make it again.

I followed the recipe except I sautéed the salmon in olive oil and butter after the marinating. I drizzled the fish with the extra sauce when it was almost done. The flavor was light but pleasant, went well with salmon. Steaming in a foil pouch, I would think, would lessen the flavor even more.

I literally loved this!!!  I had to skip marinading due to time constraints and hungry family, but flavor wise it was perfect.  I dont think basil would have made this better, as another poster suggested.  Whenever I serve fish I put a slice of lemon on the plate, and of course there is always salt and pepper.  I like to use the least amount of salt as possible when cooking, because we have a lot of different dietary needs here.  But everyone is free to add what they want at the table.  Made wild rice and fresh steamed broccoli.  Beautiful healthy meal.

I only used 1 T of oil and omitted salt.  This was fine.  My kids prefer sweeter salmon marinades and thought this was "too lemony" but my husband and I liked it.

Wow a great recipe. Already a firm family favorite.  A few minor modifications. I let the salmon baste for about 4 hours turning it once ore twice. I don't add the baste when wrapping the salmon in the foil. Found it came out a little too oily. After the long soaking period and 40 minutes in the oven, came out at  the great point between dry and succulent

Delicious! I mixed the advice from a couple reviews and went with 2 T olive oil, a heaping 1/2 t salt, and a little less pepper than what was called for. Simple prep & cooking. Mine was done in around 45 mins. Thank you!

I don’t usually like, or eat fish, but this was delicious. 
Kept everything the same, just used lines instead of lemons, since that’s what I had. 
Was happy to have all the extra oil, poured some on my rice. 
Will make again

Made this as written but I added a brown sugar glaze ( Dijon mustard and brown sugar). I served with dirty rice, broccoli and a green salad.  My Family loved it - everyone had seconds!!! It was so easy and quick to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Like it but it just a regular recipe. No surprise, no risk, no extra flavour. So, i did it and it's good but that's all. And i just use 1 teaspoon salt, but dish was little bit salty.

Delicious! I drizzled olive oil (maybe 2-3 tb) on 1 lb salmon   salt,pepper, garlic powder and minced garlic- then squeezed lemon juice and put fresh dill to bake- garnished with fresh parsley when cooked.

The only thing different I did was add some fresh dill because I just can't have fish without dill.  Neither my husband or I are terribly crazy about the strong flavor of salmon, but we both loved this!  Definitely a keeper!

I was looking for something different than the usual seared salmon and for something to bake, instead. This was a home run! I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly. While I had the fresh lemon, I did use  powdered garlic and dried parsley, and regular olive oil since they are what I had on hand. I admit this was too salty for me, so the next time I may either greatly reduce or eliminate the salt altogether - it is always easier to add than take away.  The bake time I used was 40 minutes, and it produced perfect portions. My husband loved it, so this is a definite keeper.

delicious!!!! my husband (who usually doesn't care for lemon) kept telling me how i have to add this one to the books. he really enjoyed it.
 2 T. olive oil,
 1 T. melted butter,
 3/4 tsp basil
 1/2 tsp salt,
 2 T lemon juice,
 1 T fresh chopped parsley (or 1 tsp dried)
 
top of the baking dish with foil. serve the remaining marinade drizzled on rice & fish. we cooked for 25min and that was way too long for us, ill try 20 min next time. but it didn't even matter. it was so good

Delicious when you wrap in aluminum foil to bake.   I marinated for a couple hours (2 tbsp. Olive oil, 1 tbsp. Butter, mustard, soy sauce & lemon juice).  It just melted in your mouth.  Need to bake about 30 minutes.

Made this recipe for my husband for valentines dinner. I don’t like salmon, but the marinade really masked the fishy taste. I followed it exactly, but I do agree with the others posters oil can easily be halfed. I checked on it at 35 mins, but it needed 40. My husband really liked the recipe, and told me to “favorite it”. It was super easy to make, and the salmon came out juicy.

Excellent. I cooked one filet so I cut the marinade in half. I also used lime instead of lemon because it was what was in the fridge and it was delish.  I'll prepare it in the future using  the lime juice because it was awesome. Twenty minutes tops in the oven.

Excellent! Kids tore it up. I used slightly larger salmon steaks and went with the 45 minute cook time. Probably could have done 40 minutes. Added the juice of 1/2 lemon in the marinade and once in foil added Joyce of the other 1/2. Could taste the citrus in a perfect way.

This was good,but not lick smacking yummy like the rest of the reviews. Perhaps it was my fault as I didn't marinate the salmon because I was crunched for time when I tried this recipe. I added smoked red pepoer flakes to up the heat and add more kick.

This was fantastic. I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was to die for.  The only things I changed were that I baked it at 450 for 15 minutes, used half the lemon juice, and half of the parsley.

Good, easy, and well worth the effort.  I strongly suggest you cut back on the cooking time and monitor the fish.

Prepared the marinade and baked it in that dish (leaving out the first part of step 3. Why dirty another dish?).  And it turned out wonderful!

I didn't have time to marinate it, so just poured the marinade over the salmon, covered with foil and baked for about 20 min.  Didn't have lemon, so used 1 TBS chardonnay, juice of half of a lime, and juice of half of a mandarin orange.  Adjusted the oil, salt, and spices as other reviews recommended.  We really liked the flavor!

Thought it wouldn’t be any good but I was WRONG! It was excellent!  Made glazed carrots and it was a great complementary taste. Trying to lower carbs so didn’t make rice pilaf as usual.  These two flavors were truly great!  Would highly recommend this recipe. Only mod I made was 3-4 olive oil instead of 6. And used fresh parsley.

I used 4 fillets instead of 2 and did not double marinade. Also didnt have time to marinate...just poured sauce over fish in 9X13 glass pan, covered pan with foil and baked. Husband and son loved it! (I dont eat fish;)

I usually grill my salmon on top of the stove but I hated the way it stunk up my house for days so I tried this baked salmon recipe.  I've made it twice and love how simple it is to make, how easy to clean up, but most of all I love that my house doesn't stink of fish.  And, the taste is delicious!

I really enjoy this recipe but I do feel its more a steamed flavor than a baked flavor, if that makes sense. Its always really wet when it comes out, but absolutely delicious. I find this recipe to be palatable and flavorful without ruining the fish flavor by drowning it out and it leaves the fish with a nice texture still at the end. I use this recipe while making an whole side of salmon (fresh caught we cut up ourselves) and we leave the whole side but I still find that the bake time is TOO long. So I would keep a close eye on the fish while baking this because with it all tucked in the foil like that, I find it bakes up really nice within a half hour at the most, even on a big thick fish.

I definitely should’ve read the reviews first. Way too salty. Gonna reduce it to 1/2 tsp. next time like others suggested. Otherwise turned out great.

This was a last minute dinner so I didn’t even have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder. I loved it so I will definitely make it again. So tasty and simple to make.

This recipe was awesome. My husband who doesn't even like cooked salmon said he would gladly eat this every night. Huge success in our house.

This recipe is SO easy and SO delicious.  Seriously most of the ingredients I already had in my cabinet and only need to pick up a few at the store.  The flavor of this dish is amazing.  Great to make along side a rice and a salad.  Dish good enough to serve guests!!!

Easy and delicious! I made a few changes. I used 3 T of melted butter, 2 T of olive oil, and 2 T of lemon juice, and half the salt. I left the other ingredients the same. I marinated it in a ceramic dish and covered it with the glass lid. When time was up and I left the dish out on the counter to come down to room temperature a bit, I put the covered dish in the preheated oven.I left it in for 45 minutes. Everyone loved it!

The first time I made this, it marinated for about 3-4 hours as I had an event to attend and wanted to fix it when I got home. It was so yummy.   I made it again last night and only marinated it for about 1 hr.  It was still tasty, but I think I will let my recipe marinate at least 2 hours.   Very good.  I would serve it to my friends.

This is the only way I cook salmon.  I rarely order salmon from restaurants because mine (using this recipe) is so much better.  Use fresh basil or dry.  Add extra garlic!  I read that salmon does not need to be marinaded but I assure you the salmon comes out outstanding when allowed to marinade.  I rarely use the parsley.  But I do slice tomatoes and add to the salmon before baking.  OUTSTANDING!

I didn't have fresh lemon or dill. I used bottled lemon and some dried dill. Then, I sprinkled with season-all. When I asked my family what they thought, they said it was a 12 on a scale of 1-10. They wanted to know when we would have it again.

This was amazing, my first time making fish. My mom is Filipino so we eat fish a lot and this was the best I’ve tasted in a while. I didn’t have time to maranate it so I just made the sauce to marinate it in and poured it over the fish and it turned out amazing.

We liked this recipe. I overcooked the salmon and it was not tender. My mistake. Also, the marinade was too salty for our taste. I will make it again with adjustments.

This works well for a large filet as the thin and thick parts cook evenly in the foil.  Had it again last night and it was delicious!  I cut the salt in half.

First time made this with store bought lemon juice and it was good....second time made it with fresh squeezed lemons and it was great!  Took one star off as I felt it calls for a tad too much salt.

The family loved this recipe and asked for it to go into the rotation. I didn’t have time to marinade the salmon, so just poured it on and wrapped up the salmon in foil. I also chopped up a cauliflower (seasoned with salt and pepper), added  to the same sheet pan and baked for 45 minutes. I also mixed the extra marinade into some white rice that I cooked in a rice cooker. Perfect, easy dinner that everyone loved (including the kids). Thank you!

Delicious! I took some of the reviewers advice and made the following changes - 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp butter (I didn’t melt it, I just put the butter on top of the fish), 3 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp parsley.
Our whole family loved it and asked me to make it like that every single time. Thanks for the recipe.

The taste of this was amazing. I add some horseradish which gave it a nice taste. And you have to go by how much you can handle. You can make childrens first then add more to mixture for the adults. Its a keeper.

This was a very good recipe.  I used less olive oil and twice as much garlic.My salmon fillets were not too thick, so I baked uncovered in a roasting pan for 15 minutes at 375 degrees.  Then I broiled for just a couple of minutes.  Delicious!

We had the fish for supper yesterday, and it was delicious; we had the left-overs today, and it was even more flavourful. I used a whitefish instead of salmon, and cut back on the olive oil and garlic, as suggested by others. I also placed a slice of lemon on each fish fillet.  I didn't wrap the fillets separately, but simply covered the entire baking dish with foil.  I found the whitefish didn't need quite as long as suggested in the oven since the fillets were quite thin. The final result had a lightly spiced, lemony flavour, but not so much as to bury the fish's flavour.  The best part, though was the juicy flakeyness of the fish.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Pretty good. I did sub butter for a portion of  the olive oil. I feel it could have used a touch more lemon juice.

I just can't help myself.  I find a recipe that is the idea of what I want and then make it my own.  I had Rock Fish instead of Salmon so used that, 3 garlic cloves instead of 2, avocado oil instead of olive oil, reduced salt to 1/4 tsp., juice of one medium size lemon and 1 tblsp white wine.  Placed fish in metal baking dish covered with aluminum foil and coated it with about half of the marinade. Refrigerated for 30 minutes, then flipped the fish and put the rest of the marinade on the fish. Baked the fish (without any covering) at 375 for about 20 minutes or until the fish reached an internal temp  of 140 degrees. It was perfect!  BF said I could make this anytime. We ate it ALL!!

I dropped the oil down and increased the lemon (Real lemon) as others suggested, and used roasted garlic  and fresh basil and parsley then marinated and baked it in the same glass dish.  I baked it 20 mn covered then uncovered for another 10.  The fishmonger instructions said to bake Salmon at 425 for 8-10 mn, but certainly to an internal temp of 145 degree so that was my true guide and it was perfectly moist and flaky.  I thought it could take more lemon and garlic but that could be my taste.  I will absolutely use this again.  I would give it 5 starts but those recipes usually have cream in them...

I made this tonight. I watched the video before I started. It helped. I followed the recipe. It was fast prep work and threw it in the oven. The tin foil was key. It kept the fish moistened.

Perfect every time. I also just put foil over the baking dish, after marinade in the fridge, for baking. I also put a generous amount of capers on the salmon before putting it in the oven.

My favorite salmon recipe and it's fast!!! I make it exactly as stated except that I only marinate the fish 20 minutes. It seems professional chefs say to never marinate fish more than 30 minutes.

I had 20 oz of salmon instead of 12 like in the recipe so I doubled the recipe. But I prepared it exactly as written. My husband and I loved it.

Great recipe! I didn't have time to marinate for the full hour and it was still very good. Served with linguine in a lemon cream sauce.

I often make Salmon with Lemon, butter, garlic and parsley, never had with basil.  It was a good twist.  Like it.  Will make it again.

I did as some other reviews recommended and cut the salt in half, but to me it needed more flavor period.  It was just okay.

I need to have more fish in my diet.  I've never been a big fan of salmon or any fish.  I tried this as I had two pieces of salmon in the freezer hoping they'd magically fix themselves!   I followed the recipe but had to substitute dried parsley for fresh as did not have fresh.  I baked this 35 minutes.  It was perfect.  Smelled wonderful as it baked.  It was tender and juicy and I believe I might now be a fan of salmon.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. My guest couldn't stop complimenting me :)
I've also used the adapted marinade: 3 T. olive oil,
 3/4 tsp oregano,
 1/2 tsp salt,
 1/2 tsp ground black pepper,
 3 T lemon juice,
 1 T fresh parsley.

and removed the foil and broiled it for about 5 min in the end to give it a little colour.

Delicious! I followed other reviewers’ suggestion to skip the foil and place under the broiler, I did 8 minutes on each side and my small filets were perfect! I did this only because I did not read the recipe correctly and didn’t leave time for marinating and baking as listed :( broiling was excellent, my first time making fresh fish! I would like to try the foil method next though. We all loved it, including my 17 month old. She dug in to her pile! Thanks for sharing! Fool-proof!!!!!

Followed ingredients directions exactly with adjustments for more salmon than called for in the recipe.  I also used old style prepared dijon mustard because it was the type I had on hand.  Removed skin and brushed mixture on both sides. Added the salt and pepper after the butter/honey/mustard mixture and before the crumbs/pecan/parsley mixture.  I also squeezed lots of fresh lemon and sprinkled some fresh dill when done baking and just before serving.  It was a hit with the hubby and will be making it again

As a non-fish lover, this recipe allowed me to eat the whole filet. It was tasty. Not mind blowing, but the flavour was there. I will keep coming back to this recipe. It was easy to prepare, I did not make any changes to the marinade, however I did change the cooking method. Steamed fish just does not appeal to me . I heated my cast iron pan on med high, added oil when it was good and hot so the oil smoked. Cooked the flesh side down for 3 minutes with the marinade poured in. Flipped gently onto the skinside and cooked that for 4 minutes. Added melted butter to the top while the skin was crisping to keep it moist. Turned out great.

No changes, this is excellent as is, can take a full 45 minutes to get baked inside, keep that in mind. Have made this many times and when I did not marinate it for long enough, it was not as tasty. When I follow the directions, it is perfect.

It was just perfect! Easy, simple, and delicious!

I did not modify the ingredients or the portions. I just didn't use the aluminum foil. I used a baking dish which had a glass cover and it worked just fine like that. I served it with green beans and sauteed baby potatoes. 

I can't wait to make it again.

Made this as written and it was fantastic. Fresh, simple, great tasting. I didn't even have fresh parsley and it was still amazing.  Sometimes less is more and that can hold true for recipes as well. 5 stars!

I followed the advice from other comments and simply covered my baking dish with foil - much better! The marinade was perfect though, just what I was looking for. Thanks!

Delicious recipe. I wanted something different aside from the usual dill, lemon and salt, pepper. This is super easy and so tasty. I made this for the first time. Grilled it on a cider plank on the grill. Very moist with a lot of flavor.

The best in a long time of eating salmon.  I ran out of time to bake so I broiled them for 7/8 minutes then let them rest in the oven for 5 minutes after turning off the broil (oven) while I set up the rest of dinner.  Yum

Very easy and tasty! The foil wrap adds to the moisture. Keep in mind that the olive oil flavor is added to the salmon. Be sure you like the taste of your olive oil!

I loved this healthy but tasty recipe. First time making salmon by the way and noticed the white milky substance but it was safe and it happens a lot so I researched minimally to see if it was ok. This is what I found:
  We hate to be the ones to tell you this, but the white stuff oozing out of your salmon is your fault. It happens to everyone, and it looks gross. The good news is that it doesn’t have to be that way and we’re going to tell you how to fix it.

First, let’s get to the bottom of what that stuff is. The totally harmless, but wholly unappetizing white gunk that seeps out of salmon filets as they cook is just coagulated protein — also known as albumin. (To clarify, the correct spelling is albumin with an “i.” You may have also heard of albumen, with an “e,” but albumen is the term for egg whites. They’re two different things.) This sounds bad, but it’s absolutely safe. Albumin gets pushed out of the muscle fibers of fish as it cooks, coagulating at the surface. This will happen to all salmon, no matter what you do. It has been hypothesized that the way you cook salmon — how fast and how long — causes albumin, but this is not true.

America’s Test Kitchen tested the cooking theory AND talked to Donald Kramer — a professor of seafood science at the University of Alaska — and concluded that the way you cook fish will not stop albumin from collecting at the surface. While they did see some more albumin with salmon that was purposefully overcooked, it collected on all t

I did follow other peeps opinion and used 1 T butter and 3 T evoo and halved the salt. After marinating it, cooked it open faced in oven for about 15 minutes. Served with a kale slaw/salad and parmesan orzo. Very light and yummy, will make again. Thanks for sharing!

Tweaked the recipe a little. I filled the bowl up with oil to cover the salmon completely along with the spices, no need to turn them occasionally. Had no basil and sage worked just as good. Went great with mashed potatoes.

Made it with extra garlic had run out of lemon juice, so tried to use lime but was low on that too. Used melted butter and so added less oil, but it was terrific anyway. Wife liked it once she scraped off the pepper and the rest of the toppings because she has this thing against pepper. But the herbs and garlic were very good. Clean up was much easier with the foil.

Delish!  I did not use foil, just placed salmon (4) in square baking dish and spooned the marinade over.  For marinade, I used 2.5 tbsp of evoo and a pat of butter, 2 tbsp of lemon juice, and added a bit of dill to the basil, parsley and garlic.  Broiled about 5 minutes per side.
Served over fresh basil linguine.  Family loved it!

This was great and so easy.  I didn't have fresh parsley and I only used half the olive oil.  Doing WW.  Also just marinated this for 20 minutes.  I also used the suggestion of one of the reviewers and just used the tin foil on top of the glass pan.  It is the first time that I didn't over cook the salmon.  Just saved the recipe to my collections.  Yum Yum.

I made this with tilapia instead of salmon because that's what I had. It worked well for my fish and tasted great. I might even use this combination of herbs for some turkey breasts I have. It was a very tasty recipe but I don't think I would try this on salmon as I think it's more suited to other fish or protein.

We always grill our salmon but in the middle of winter, I was looking for a tasty way to make salmon indoors. This fit the bill.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. It was easy to make and the result was delectable. I have already given the recipe to two people and can't wait to make it again!

This was a wonderful seafood fix.  Just 20 minutes in the oven and the smell of baked, seasoned salmon wafted through the room.  It was delectable.  I am so glad I bought enough to cook for one more evening.  Thank you for the recipe!

My 11 year old grandson and I made this for the first time. We were very pleased with the results. Because I don't do will with garlic, we reduced it to about a half teaspoon and as hard as I might try we could not find the basil but it came out well despite our changes. We will definitely make this again.

This was very good. I halved the recipe as I was only making one piece of salmon. Very simple and quick. If you don't have time to marinate you could sprinkle ingredients on top on salmon.. Maybe using a but of garlic powder in place of minced. I don't like over cooked salmon.. So mine only took 20 minutes.

This was a truly flavorful dish!
I marinated the fish, 7 portions, skin side up for an hour in the fridge uncovered, and then flipped it skin side down just before I placed it in the foil, and poured the remaining marinade over the fish. I had to use a half sheet pan for so many portions :)
I did think 40 minutes was a long time and was worried about over cooking, but it was moist and flaky.
This is now a new favorite.  
Thank you LADYBLADE!

I made it with 2 T olive oil, 1 T melted butter, 1 tsp dried parsley, 3/4 tsp dried basil, dash dill weed, dash pepper, dash salt.  I didn't have lemon on hand.  Baked in pan covered with foil vs. individually.

I'm new at making salmon so I tried a few different recipes and thus far this was one of my favorites.  I made only a few changes. 1. I added Morton's Nature's Seasoning. 2. I only had 1 small fillet so I cut the ingredients in half and cooked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and 3. I cooked it in an oven bag versus foil and it turned out perfect.

SO DELICIOUS!! I followed the advice of reviewer ROUVER, with  the only adjustment being 1/4 tsp salt, instead of 1/2 tsp, since I was only making one filet for myself. After marinating for an hour, I seared both sides of the filet in a cast iron skillet (two minutes per side), then returned it to the glass pan and covered it with foil. Baked for 30 minutes. Removed foil then broiled on high for 5 minutes. Done! I ate my filet with jasmine rice and poured the remaining juice over top. When I make this again, I'll probably only use 1.5 tbsp lemon juice and add more butter. It's my first time cooking fish of any kind, and this recipe made it super easy. Definitely a keeper!!

Me and my mom made this recipe for mother's day and everyone loved it. But, we added small pads of butter on top of the salmon while it was cooking. Otherwise, great dish, we are making it  tomorrow for Thanksgiving.

This is a really easy recipe.  I do agree with ROUVER with the changes:
Excellent recipe. As recommended, made the following changes, and it turned out wonderfully:
 2 T. olive oil,
 1 T. melted butter,
 3/4 tsp basil,
 1/2 tsp salt,
 3 T lemon juice,
 1 tsp dried parsley,
 dash of dill weed.
I did put mine in a glass container with the foil and it came out great. You could also do this on the BBQ in foil.

Super Easy.  Not 5 stars only because it needs a super sauce which anyone can do on their own.  I like glazed with reduced basalmic.  I really like the easy part.....

Love it! I substitute cilantro and used dried basil and dried parsley. Perfection! Juices was so good! I cooked my salmon for 30 minutes.

this is the best salmon I have ever eaten. it is so moist and full of flavor. I used only 1 tbsp. of olive oil and instead of wrapping the fish in aluminum foil pouches I just covered the baking dish while it cooked. i also removed the skin before marinating. this is definitely a keeper!!!!

I was very pleased with the flavor and especially pleased with the texture!  It was flaky and moist, but not at all soggy.  I prefer skinless Salmon so that is what I use.  I'm sure that it would be quite different with the skin.

It was great! I actually made it with Basa loins. It was superb! It is our favourite way to fish. It is a perfect blend. We eat it once a week! It is very easy to prepare also. Great way to have a healthy meal!

I'm getting ready to make this for the second time.  I had never baked salmon before, so I searched this site for a recipe using ingredients I have on hand.  That's how I decided on this one.  It did NOT disappoint!  I baked 3 fillets and followed the recipe exactly as stated.  I thought it was delicious and my daughters each ate a fillet and loved it.  I do think I could have made 4 or 5 fillets in the amount of marinade but it just depends on how much spice you like.  I personally like the amount called for.  Tonight I am trying this with a little less olive oil and a little more lemon juice to try and make it a little lighter.  Great recipe!

It was okay. I only used 2T of oil and upped the lemon juice to 2T, as recommended by others. The salmon was perfect, but I found it far too garlicky for my liking. I prefer a stronger lemon flavor with my fish.

I did make some changes and used just 1 clove of garlic. I didn't marinate it for an hour and I also made the mistake of not defrosting the salmon before baking it. This recipe is wonderful though. The flavour is wonderful and mine turned out a little "fishy" but I like that in fish.. because it's fish. I totally recommend this recipe.

I have made this many times, and it is my go-to salmon recipe! The only thing I do differently is reduce the oil. I typically buy the wild, sockeye salmon, and cook it with fresh broccoli drizzled with olive oil and minced garlic right alongside it in the same pan. Yum!

Tasty! I forgot to marinate and just put all the ingredients on the  salmon and sealed in tin foil,  in the oven for 35 minutes and it came out really good. I did something wrong with the sauce but it was still tasty. My family has already asked me to make it again

Easy to follow and turned out great! I reduced the amount of salt because the recommended portion was a bit salty for my liking, but besides that I loved it! I I reduced the salt by half a teaspoon.

Amazing!  The only thing i changed in the marinade is to omit the parsley and add 1 tsp dried dill in it's place. Baked it at 375 deg covered for about 30 minutes amd uncovered for about 10, then hit it with a quick broil.

Absolutely wonderful! The mixture of simple spices/herbs made a simple but great marinade and the baking in foil ensured the salmon was very moist. So easy to make, as well.

Absolutely amazing!! I will definitely make this again for myself and guests. I followed the recipe as much as I could, using what I had available for 1 sockeye salmon fillet. Instead of fresh herbs I used dry herbs, I ran out of garlic so I used garlic salt (1tsp, will probably cut it back to 1/2 tsp next time), used fresh ground pepper, and did not include dill. I read the other reviews and decided to bake the fillet in a dish and cover with foil at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. Then I marinated the fish in the pan juice and broiled on high for 8 min. It was delicious and if I had fresh ingredients it would have been a 10-star recipe!

Awesome flavor!  My first time making any sort of fish, and given how well it came out, I will definitely make this again!  I made triple the original recipe, but still 20 minutes-ish (forgot to set a timer) was enough to bake the fish all the way.  I just baked them all together in the glass dish with a sheet of foil over top rather than doing pockets for each one.  

I went with most of the suggestions and reduced the salt and upped the lemon juice.  I cut the oil by half, and substituted part of that with butter to keep the oil from smoking, but I think I'll try reducing the oil/butter even more next time.  Just seemed like there was too much.

Wonderful recipe. As many suggested, I reduced the olive oil to 1 to 2 tablespoons (I forgot to do this once and 6 tablespoons was just way too much oil. I didn't even feel comfortable pouring the sauce over my rice as it was too oily to eat) and instead of wrapping it in tin foil, I put the filets in the baking dish, covered in marinade and then covered the dish with aluminum foil.  Very simple recipe and comes out great!

I took the recommendations of using 1 Tbsp melted butter, 2 Tbsp olive oil, and a pinch of dill. I also decided to bake the salmon in a casserole dish covered in foil with a slice of lemon on top of each piece of salmon. My boyfriend loved it!

I absolutely love this recipe. Have made it several times and each time it is a hit. We are garlic lovers so I increased the garlic a tad and decreased the salt and pepper a little. It's all a matter of individual tastes, though, isn't it?

This is a keeper. I made it with no changes. There is actually enough marinade for at least 50% more fish, so I did another piece to use for salmon salad for lunch.

Way to much seasoning for me. It was a fast recipe to prepare which I liked and it was not to oily like a couple other reviewers had mentioned. If I make it again I will cut the seasoning in half if not by more.

It's definitely impressive and not a bad recipe. I just found the spices/flavor to be a bit too much - I prefer dishes that are more mild.

My boyfriend and I have been trying to incorporate more fish into our diet, so I was searching for salmon recipes. Our biggest complaint about cooking fish is that it usually comes out dry. This recipe is awesome! The salmon came out moist and the flavor was subtle. I put less olive oil than the recipe called for, which I still found a little heavy. I will definitely be making this again!

This is surprisingly good, and pretty much foolproof--just be sure the marinate for awhile to cut any fishy flavor before you bake it.

I have never made fish this delicious before!! This recipe is sooooo good!! Can't wait to make it again. I used fresh basil and dried parsley because that's what I had on hand. May try grilling it next time (only because we love to grill) but nice to know that if it's too cold to grill we can still have a delicious healthy meal.

This Baked Salmon is delicious
Substituted Tarragon instead of Basil.
Added Spiced Capers instead of salt & pepper and a dash of Sriracha at the end!
Served with a freshly grated Parmesan Cheese Crisp on top with a side of Asparagus, all over a bed of Wild Red Rice.

I will definitely make it again! I always said that i didn't like salmon but after this recipe I am changing my mind and am willing to try other salmon recipes. Cilantro and lemon helped mask the fish taste and gave a nice flavour.

I also decreased salt to 3/4tsp, added sliced onion and lemon rounds and a few small dabs of unsalted butter while decreasing oil to 2 Tablespoons. I used half grapeseed oil and half olive oil...as I was running low on EVOO. Skipped foil packets to bake in glass pan covered with foil.
Probably ranks in top three salmon recipes I've ever made. I also used a bit of this marinade to brush across my asparagus that I put on top rack for 30 minutes at same cooking time and they were just beginning to roast but tender. Amazing!!

Very tasty!  Only change I made was 4 T of olive oil instead of 6, and that was enough to fully saturate 8 pieces. My family raved about it so much here they are requesting I make it again 2 weeks later. Yum!

Absolutely delicious and very easy. If you're in a pinch, no need to even let this marinate. It's just as delicious if you top it right away, place in tin foil and bake.

Oh wow this turned out so delicious! The only change I made was cutting back on the olive oil using only 2 T. I left the lemon the same and it tasted perfect. Nice and lemony :) I didn't marinate it either. I even used frozen salmon on a lined cookie sheet. I tripled the recipe to freeze and use for my lunches. My boyfriend also loved it and said he couldn't get over how delicious it was.

Have made it twice, and it is a big hit at my house.  Followed the recipe both times without changes.  Oh, except no parsley the second time because I forgot I didn't have any :-)

Super easy clean-up too!  Served with boiled potatoes and steamed kale.

It was way, way too salty for me- I would use /recommend 1/2 a teaspoon instead. I did not have fresh parsley so I substituted 1/2 teaspoon of dried parsley. I did decrease the amount of oil as others recommended and it was just fine (used 3-4 TBS). I don't think I would have topped it off with the marinade before baking. 

I wish I would have checked a few other reviews before I made it, I would have pulled it out at 25 min, not kept for 35+.

I will try again and use less salt and maybe dill instead of parsley as others have suggested.

Very delicious and easy recipe. I  tried the recipe 4 times already and my salmon always tastes great.

Here are some suggestions:
- I think the recipe calls for too much oil, I decrease the amount of oil to half and still get a moist piece of salmon
- Sub some of the oil with melted butter, yum!
- For big portions (or even small ones like 2 pieces of salmon), I add the fish with the marinade to a baking dish. I cover the dish with aluminum foil and leave fish to marinade before baking.
- You can always unwrap the foil before the fish is fully cooked and brown it (I use the broiler in my oven) , great color and crunch on the top of the fish and without overcooking.

was awesome!  I did not have fresh parsley, so used cilantro instead and it was great!  cut back on the garlic a bit and only put in one clove since wife doesn't like garlic.

I made it with salmon steaks (that's what I had available) and they were great. Two notes though - oil is too much (3 or 4 spoons would be okay) and cooking time is a bit too long. I left it in the oven for like 30-35 min which was just enough.

Delicious! Instead of parsley, I used dill weed. Also maybe I will use less olive oil for next time. the salmon turned out so tasty and still flaked and stayed moist. I'm definitely going to make this for my friends :)

I think the recipe is exceptional and it has been a staple of mine for a while. I use the suggested amount of oil and it works well for me. I don't add as much of the oil into the foil to put in the oven, but I do make sure to take all the herbs and garlic that are chopped in there and place them on top of the salmons in the packet. 

The packet should be completely sealed. Dry fish might be due to a leak in the packets or not including enough marinade. I cut 10 minutes off the last fish I made with this recipe as it was a significantly smaller portion. Regardless, for me it always comes out moist and practically falling apart with flakiness. 

I usually serve it with rice and parmesan asparagus. Divine.

This is a very very good recipe.  I made it exactly, however, I just baked it uncovered in a baking dish for about 40 minutes.  I had a small piece of salmon...a tiny bit less than a pound.  I used the exact measurements and took off the skin.  Served with couscous and laid the fish on top and grilled asparagus on the side.  It was so easy and delicious.  It will be made a few times a month.  The sauce it creates is so good drizzled over everything.

Very flavorful.  I felt that 35 minutes overcooked it however.  Very dry.  I would check it after 20 - 25 minutes next time.

Loved this recipe! I did change  the oil. I used half olive and half vegetable oil only because that is what I had on hand. Also, I did not  marinate. I just put it all together and baked, it turned out EXCELLENT! I served it with, Tasty Spicy Rice Pilaf recipe.  Thanks...

The marinade was good, but next time I won't cook the salmon in it; it was almost like it was boiled or poached. I think it will be a lot better if I take it out of the marinade and bake or grill it.

I switched spices and put oregano with the parsley instead of basil and used fresh squeezed lemon juice. Also great with thyme ??. Placing in the aluminum foil is great....quick clean up and fish comes out super delish! Will try marinade with Chicken Thighs too

Don't listen to the people that tell you to change the recipe completely. They are just too lazy to put up their own recipe. Follow the recipe exactly as written and you will not be disappointed!! This is a favourite salmon dish in my house. Packs a lot of flavour!! The marinade is really good over rice too!!

This tasted amazing.  I was surprised how much my husband liked it because he doesn't really care for salmon.  After reading the reviews I only added a third of the olive oil (still might have been too much especially with the added butter),  added a teaspoon of dill weed, lemon slices on top, and a little bit of olive oil butter on top right before baking in oven.  Will definitely make this again!!!

Everyone enjoyed this.  I would prefer less salt, but my teenagers thought it was great as is.

I did not marinade, and I omitted the butter-- no need for it. I just put spray canola oil on the foil and the fish, then the spices, folded up in foil, and placed in the oven. I made some dill cream sauce for the side. Turned out delicious! Even my picky stepdaughter who does not like fish ate this and declared it five stars!  So easy and so delicious. Thank you.

Wow, this was really good. I stuck to the recipe except doubled it and only used 4 tbl of olive oil.  Marinated it for about 6 hours, baked uncovered for 35 minutes (2 lb piece of salmon).  Whole family loved it.

One of our all-time favorite salmon recipes. As great for guests or a holiday as it is for an easy-prep weeknight meal. Our 2.5-year old loves it, too!

Fairly good but reduce the amount of olive oil to 1Tbs, at most up to 2Tbs.

Made this with in-season sockeye salmon and was WOWED!! The only thing I changed was to add lime instead of lemon. Hubby and I prefer it on fish. Otherwise, pretty much followed the recipe (bottled spices, not fresh...sorry!), and was very happy with how it turned out.

This is the BEST! The only ingredient change I make is using thyme instead of basil. It made salmon lovers out of my family, so we make this often. Also, I bake it in a glass pan and cover with foil, but don't do the pouch as suggested. Thank you for the recipe!

I tried making this today for dinner, and it turned out amazing! I didn't have fresh parsley, so i left that out. But regardless, the taste was perfect! Also I baked it on 400 degrees for 20 mins to expedite the process. Worked well!

Sooooooo good. I made a few changes after reading the reviews. I only had one half pound salmon filet, so I halved the marinade recipe BUT used only 2.5T olive oil, 2t lemon juice and cut salt and pepper down to 1/4t. I kept the amount of garlic the same at 2 cloves minced and also threw in a couple pinches of dill. Marinated the filet in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator for a little over an hour and then baked it at 375 for 20 minutes in a glass dish (no foil). IT WAS PERFECTION. So moist and flavorful! The marinade added a great flavor but didn't overpower the salmon.  This is definitely going to become a regular dish for me.

Love this recipe. It has to be one of our favourites, and have sent the link to some of our friends. 
We have lightened up on the salt and sprinkled capers on the salmon when we put it into the oven.

Overall it was easy and delicious - I substituted garlic scapes for the garlic (because they're in season and I'd never used them before) and used a little less oil.  I used wild Pacific salmon filets from our local organic store - they are pretty thick but I only did 20 minutes in the oven.  It was well-done, but I think next time I'd try maybe 18 minutes because I like it a little more medium.  Cooking fish filets 35 minutes is way way too long!

The best salmon I have every made. Quick and easy.  I did reduce the olive oil, added about 1 and 1/2 T.  Still too much oil but it turned out great.  I also substituted the basil with cilantro (my favorite herb).  My picky son made no complants.  I will prepare this recipe again.-GEL

My first attempt at salmon and it came out great. As everyone knows salmon can be pricey so messing it up is not an options. I was a little intimidated at first but have made this recipe a few times now. I find the stated cooking time can be a bit much so I only bake for about 25 mins, when it flakes it's done. Also I marinate in a glass dish covered in foil and bake it that way versus wrapping the salmon in foil. I have done it both ways(foil and covered dish) and find I like the covered dish better for some reason. Definitely easy and delicious.

Amazing and easy for a baked salmon dish. We live in the Pacific NW and as such are salmon snobs. Only recommendations to make this dish excellent #1 Use fresh or flash frozen salmon (preferably Pacific Coast salmon) #2 Reduce the oil to 2 to 3 tbs. #3 a touch of dill.

Omg...I made this recipe last week for dinner, I was shocked how good the salmon was even though I substituted vegetable oil for the olive oil. It's so easy to make, great anytime of the year!! Let's just say I got two thumbs up from my husband and son....it's a hit!!!!

If I could make taste good then it is an easy good recipe.  I used only 2 tablespoons of oil and substitued some chicken broth. Trying to cut calories.

I'm making this dish for the 2nd time and I love it! My only problem with it is the olive oil can be a little overwhelming. This time I am using EVOO and butter mixture. I hope it turns out ok.

Yum! We had fresh Atlantic salmon and this recipe was really good. I reserve 5-star rating for spectacular dishes. The marinade was just right for the fish and so was the bake time. When I made the marinade it seemed like too much, so I cut the oil in half. It coated the meat well. I will make again...quick and easy.

Super delicious! I made a few changes as well, less oil, instead of regular oil I used Avocado Garlic Oil(HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING THIS) (I did not use garlic either because it was in the oil) didn't have parsley so I used dill. Yum Yum Yum, I'll make it again :-)

This recipe was delicious. I used a zip lock bag instead instead of a bowl. I didn't use fresh parsley and I used already minced garlic. I didn't use as much olive oil. I paired this with some leftover yams I had in the fridge. It was delish. I forgot to take a pic. I ate too fast. I also salted after it was done. Amazing dish.

This is delicious. I made as written but with a tsp of dried parsley. Next time I will probably use 2 tbl of oil instead. There was a lot left in the foil. It wasn't too salty for us as others wrote. I would not add more lemon because I like the basil favor on this. I baked for 45 minutes and it was terrific.

Really good and we eat a lot of fish including salmon.  One of the best.  Very easy.  Did cut back on oil and increased the garlic (garlic lovers).

I used this exact recipe for 3 fillets and it worked well. I skipped the 1 hour of marinating and parsley. I also used fresh basil and extra lemon juice. I will probably only use 3-4 tablespoons of oil next time.

Simple and delicious. I followed the instructions to the letter, save for simply cooking the fish in a tinfoil packet alone and leaving it in for 50 minutes instead of 45 as I like my salmon more well-done than most. I think I could make do with a little less oil, but the fish turned out wonderful even with the full amount. I can already tell this is going to be a standby recipe for me.

I made this recipe following the instructions, but also added 1/2 tsp of both dill and garlic powder. Because I am not much of a fish lover, I feared that the marinade wouldn't be enough flavour; so before baking, I coated the the fillets in a breadcrumb/pecan/dill/lemon pepper crust. I baked the salmon fillets in a half-open fool envelope, meanwhile I whipped up a garlic-lemon-dill sauce (milk/cornstarch/garlic powder/lemon pepper/dill). The end result was excellent. I'm glad that I coated the salmon and whipped up a sauce. I served the fish with white rice. Verdict: Would make again

This is an excellent recipe. It's really good! The one thing that I would say is that if you guys are running short on time and just realize that it needs an hour to marinate don't worry about it. It's better to marinate longer but 20 minutes works well too.

This recipe is awesome!  I used ROUVER's updates (2 T. olive oil, 1 T. melted butter, 3/4 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 T lemon juice, 1 tsp dried parsley, dash of dill weed.) but add a lot more dill weed and garlic.  I like my fish a little more rare, so I only bake for 30 minutes...  I'm not a cook at all and it tastes good even when I make it!

Great taste! Thanks! Yes, reduce to 30 ml of oil, and bake it in the 9-inch glass plate inside an enamel container. I baked at 475°F for 18 minutes. And you?

I have not had much experience cooking fish, but this was so easy to do that I had no problem. My oven time was right around the 35 minute mark. As others have mentioned there was definitely some excess marinade, but regardless, it was simply delicious. I paired it with a spinach salad.

Followed the directions, fish was very very dry even with all the oil and seasonings.   Perhaps it was the piece of Frozen Alaskan Salmon.  Baked way too long at 40 min.

Made this as written but used four Salmon.  I didn't double the sauce and it was plenty for four.   I loved it exactly as is.  I won't change a thing next time.

Excellent recipe, very flavorful, easy and healthy.  This was my first time baking Salmon and my family really enjoyed it.  I am not a fish eater and the salmon did not taste fishy at all!

Wow ;) the best salmon recipe I have ever tried! As a newly wedded wife  I am doing my best to cook lots of delicious food for my husband. He told me fish really isn't his thing especially oven baked. So I told him to let me make it just once for him, I found this recipe and gave it a try. I was amazed when he sat down for dinner and ate this salmon telling me it was so good! I didn't believe it so I asked him if he really did like it. He said " I liked it enough to eat it and tell you make it again sometime"! Thanks this is becoming one of our favorites ;) I served it with white rice and some steamed veggies with shrimp it was amazing. Thanks again

best baked salmon ever. the marinade gave it a really nice zesty flavor. changes: added lots of dried dill, which really complemented the lemon herb flavor. Also used parchment paper and wrapped it around the salmon

This recipe is great!  I removed the skin to prevent the fishy taste. Also, I used the Saute Expresx garlic and herb instead of just garlic. It was awesome!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I have never cooked Salmon before and was a little anxious about how it would turn out. But it was great my whole family enjoyed it. I decreased the amount of to half ,added 1 tsp of melted butter and halved the amount of salt like some of the reviews

This recipe was wonderful. It was perfect for salmon. I've used it for other types of fish and it tasted great. I used only 3 tbs of olive oil and parsley flakes. I also added more lemon juice which made it even better.

Awesome!!!  Simply Awesome!!!! My first time ever to bake successful Salmon.  Since my herb preferences lean toward fresh, I used fresh Basil.  Other than that, wouldn't change a thing.  My Salmon was Keta fresh wild-caught in USA.  It was even beautiful to look at!!! This is family and dinner company worthy!  Many thanks!

Great recipe. I added Thai Basil and Cilantro to the marinade along with other ingredients. I also only cooked for 25 minutes, which was sufficient. Fabulous! THX!

I added a little lemon pepper to the marinade. Ours turned out quite salty. We will eat it again but cut the salt in half.

Big hit in my house. Definitely do what everyone else said and cut down on the olive oil. I cut mine to 3 tbsp and it was still a bit much. Everything else I did by the book and it was great! I might cook it for less than 45 minutes next time. And there will definitely be an next time!

Amazing. I am NOT a fish lover and have usually hated salmon. This, however, has changed my mind. Absolutely delicious as written and the smell is out of this world good. Only change, the time was way too much for our particular salmon, 25 minutes was perfect.

This recipe was great! As a student and inexperienced cook I made it and it was really easy. I used pacific canned salmon instead because I didn't have fresh one and although I'm sure fresh fish is much better, this still worked really well.

Awesome recipe! Family would only eat grilled salmon, until now.  
There were no leftovers, and many compliments. THANK-YOU!! Only change I made was a little less oil and sprinkled lemon pepper on salmon before baking.

This recipe is amazing.  I used fresh basil and cooked it for only 35 minutes and it was perfect.  My friend told me three times that this was the best salmon he ever had.  I highly recommend it and it is very easy to prepare and cook for your family or a dinner party.  Kathleen

This dish was so easy to make and it tasted incredible. The only note I would make is to make sure you use the thick pieces of salmon from up towards the head versus the thinner ones from closer to the tail. The thin pieces tend to taste a little watered down in comparison to the thicker ones. This recipe is spot on if you use the thick piece.

It was simple and wonderful.  Easy.  Made a few seasoning changes for my household.  The "anti-fish eaters" loved it too.  I added diced mini potatoes with it.

I have used this recipe for years and just decided to add a review.  It is my go-to Salmon recipe.  Easy and delicious.  Sometimes I add crushed red pepper or dried jalapeños to add some spice.  I always add a few slices of butter right before baking it.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I don't like fish, so I made it for my husband and a couple of friends.  They loved it.  I decided to try it, and found it palatable -- a far, far cry from how I imagined salmon would taste.  Oh, I did cover it with parchment paper cut to fit the inside of the glass 9 x 12 dish I cooked it in, because I was out of foil.  I tried to get the skin off the 2 lb. slab of salmon I cooked, and couldn't do it.  It came off very easily after it was cooked, though.

Very nice recipe but what a waste of olive oil. It does bake the salmon nicely and the salmon is still tender the next day. It uses way too much olive oil.

I used pollack as i didnt have any salmon on hand.  I cut the oil out completely as i never really use it to cook with and pollock seems to always be moist anyway.  I did cut the pepper way down, and no basil.  It worked well with this fish as well.

This was extremely simple to prepare and my boyfriend and I thought it was fantastic...served with rice and asparagus.  I followed the recipe but also added minced garlic, black pepper and dill to the marinade...FANTASTIC!  My salmon filets were larger, I cooked them in the glass dish covered with foil and it still only took 25 minutes of cook time (the last 10 minutes I uncovered it). This will definitely make it's way into my dinner rotation and will make eating more fish an attainable goal! Yum!

Amazing and easy!  I used 4 6oz fillets for the two adults and two teens in the family. Even with the extra amount of fish there is too much oil and you can cut that amount by half. On the other hand... We love lemon and easily tripled the amount asked for which along with the doubled garlic was divine! Happily devoured with asparagus and couscous!

I followed this exactly as written.  It was good, but not amazing.  I would try another recipe before making this again.  It is quick and easy though which is a plus.

What a wonderful recipe for salmon. I marinaded the fish in a ziplock with an added pinch of dill. I arranged the salmon in a 9x9 covered with the sauce. I covered the dish with foil and baked as directed. Wonderful , served with rice.

Made with all ingredients, but reduced the salt and pepper to probably 1/4-1/2 tsp at most. Cut olive oil to 3 tablespoons and I'm glad I did because 6 would have been way too much!! I used 3 5oz salmon steaks (boneless & skinless), cooked at 375 for 40 minutes and let sit wrapped in the foil on top of the stove for 10 minutes while I cooked my asparagus in the oven. They were cooked perfectly. I'm not a huge fan of salmon, but this was actually pretty good. I have saved it in my recipe box and will definitely be making again.

I am not a fish lover but my husband is and I was looking for a recipe to try and also give it to my 1yr old son. Huge success! Even I eat it. My son loves it and my husband asks for it once a week. Love it. I do skin the fish before baking it and prefer the less fishy taste

they loved it! followed the recipe as is only thing i did differently was substitute cilantro for the parsley.  For the cooking however I did not wrap in foil like in the video, because another reviewer mentioned it was far too soggy that way. I just put it on a baking sheet and lined it with foil and cooked it uncovered then for a few minutes turned on the broiler on high. EXCELLENT! definitely will do again.

Found it rather bland and a bit oily.  Might work better if you decreased the amount of olive oil, but I didn't try that.  I may try this again with less oil and a few more spices, so I'll rate again if it turns out more to my liking.

Crazy good. I'm now making this weekly. I do just cover the glass dish with foil and cook that way. Makes it even easier. I think 20 minutes is plenty - 35 minutes makes it too dry inside for my tastes. love, love it.

SO GOOD! I will make this again and again. I followed the recipe exactly for a 1lb (16oz) salmon fillet. I left off the fresh parsley at the end.

I was very nervous about this recipe -- my husband is not a fan of salmon at all. However, he was impressed with this dish and so was I! I let it marinade for only 15 minutes since we were starving, but it was a delicious and easy recipe. Thank you!

Light, mild taste.  Perfect seasoning for salmon.  I like to pair it with mashed potatoes and a fresh vegetable (like broccoli). Quick, easy, and SO good.

This is the best preparation of salmon that we have ever had!  We only marinated it for 30 minutes prior to baking, but it did the trick and the flavors were incredible.  We are looking forward to making this for company!

Glad I read the reviews before making this. I cut the oil by half, then added 1 Tbsp melted ghee (clarified butter). Also: cut the salt to 3/4 tsp, pepper to 1/2 tsp, and increased lemon juice to 3 Tbsp. Was delicious. I'll make this again and again. (Would be WAY too much oil if sticking with the original recipe)

I replaced 2/3 of the oil (and all the salt of course) with a slightly smaller amount of soy sauce. I thought it was maybe a little too oily even then but that did help a lot. It cuts down the oil significantly and adds more flavor without overpowering the fish. If you're concerned about the sodium or MSG there are brands and flavors with less or none.

I made a lot of servings and it went over well, all getting eaten that night. I baked it all on a cast iron grill pan at a higher temperature for less time.

Amazing-- salmon turns out incredibly moist (melt in your mouth-like) and the flavors are delicious. I've used this recipe hundreds of times with several different marinades and it always turns out great!!

So I made this recipe for my boyfriend and he LOVVEEED IT. I followed other people's suggestions and went half on the oil, and salt. I added some tarragon, extra garlic, and lemon juice some garlic powder, paprika, creole seasoning and ground cayenne pepper to give it some pizazz. I also used fresh basil and dried parsely. Before baking, I put a few thin lemon slices on the salmon along with some butter. I kept a good eye on the fish so that I would not over cook it, I believe I cooked it for about 20 mins on 375. It came out flakey and moist. I served it with white rice, and sauteed garlic butter green beans.It was soo good my boyfriend told me to add it to my list when I cook for him. I felt flattered, will definently make this again

This was good, but too salty. Also, I think the oil could be cut down a bit as there was a lot for the fish to "swim" in. Next time I make it I'm thinking that I'll omit the salt altogether and use salted butter instead of the oil, maybe a couple tablespoons. Otherwise really good!

This was the best way that I have ever had Salmon. I was only able let them marinate for 5 or 10 min. basically until the oven was to temp. It still tasted very good.

This was amazing!  The only change I made was I used fresh basil, it was in the garden, and dried parsley, and I didn't have as much time to marinate.  But the flavors were fantastic, very fresh.  I will keep this recipe for baked salmon.  I drizzled some of the oil, after cooking, over my green beans.  Very good!

This is the best salmon that I have ever made.  I am not a big salmon lover but this was absolutely delicious.  Even my 2 year old ate this, and he can be picky.  I did make a few changes...  I used closer to a pound of salmon, reduced the olive oil to 2 tablespoons, reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon, and used 1/2 tablespoon of dried parsley since I did not have fresh. It made the perfect amount of marinade.  I definitely recommend removing the skin so that the salmon does not have a fishy flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

This was yummy! I also cut down on the oil (maybe 3 T) and used fresh basil from my garden. Foil packets seemed complicated so I just put the pieces on a cookie sheet lined with foil and baked them at 350 for about 25 minutes. The skin stayed on the foil and the rest went into my mouth. Will make again!

I'm not big in the kitchen but I wanted to prove my friends that I'm capable of cooking so I chose this recipe and not only was it easy to make but the taste was amazing. Only thing i changed was using fresh basil off of my plant. Can't wait to make it again. Served it with roasted asparagus w/homemade creamed Parmesan sauce.

We've made this four times already! We follow suggestions to cut down on the olive oil. The leftover sauce, after baking, is really good over broccoli.

I didn't have lemon juice or basil on hand, but I added a little extra parsley and it worked out wonderfully!!!   I should have cooked a little less time.   With salmon you need to be careful because a variation in oven temps can make a big difference.   
Next time I will have all of the recommended ingredients on hand, and I'm sure it will be amazing!

Finally!! I really don't like salmon at all, so I've never really made it, even though my husband loves it.  I've always wanted to like it, it is so healthy for you, but I've never found a piece I liked.  This recipe is perfect, I actually loved it!  Took some other posters suggestions and decreased the olive oil to 3 tbsp and upped the lemon juice to 3 tbsp, I also doubled the garlic, but left all else the same and I thought it was delicious!! Baked at 400 for 40 minutes(thick filets)in a glass dish with foil over the top and even my 18 month old very picky son was devouring it.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!!

I used this recipe today with slight change, that being dried vs fresh parsley and I used two tbsp melted butter with four tbsp evoo, mixing the ingredients together and pouring it over the salmon.  I turned the salmon at least once,  1/2 way through the hour of marinating.  I baked it for about  40 minutes and served it with fresh green beans and  sweet inspirations potatoes.  It was tasty!!!  Salmon does not need a lot of help, so this marinade was just right!!! Will use it again!!!

I am trying to add more fish into my diet and I generally hate salmon. Just too fishy for me. This recipe was AMAZING! I didn't have basil so I left that out but followed the rest of the ingredients. I also am not a huge fan of steaming so I followed another readers recommendation of broiling. SO yummy even my two kids ate it up. I boiled 7 minutes on both sides. Although I kept the skin on when cooking, I took it off when time to eat. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I LOVE salmon, but this was my first time ever making it since my husband hates fish.  It was amazing - maybe the best salmon I've ever had!  I did 3 Tbl. olive oil and 1 Tbl. melted butter, and cut back the salt, but otherwise followed the ingredients.  I didn't marinate it, just put the fish in a 9x13, covered with the mix, covered with foil and baked 35 minutes at 375, then uncovered and broiled 3 minutes.  My kids loved it and asked for seconds.

My new favorite way to make/eat salmon! The only thing I change is I add a thin slice of lemon to the top of the salmon before wrapping it up. That is in no way, shape or form necessary to the recipe though. Just my personal preference.

Once again, the reviews were correct!  This recipe was not only SUPER easy, but it was delicious.  I can see myself trying this type of marinade with other types of fish and veggies as well.

Delicious salmon recipe. Would've been perfect if not for all the oil. Perhaps if you removed the skin you would still need all that oil, but I kept the skin on and I wish I had used much less oil. Next time  2 tablespoons will be more than enough. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. I served mine with a side of pesto coated orzo and artichoke hearts. Loved it!

Very easy and delicious. I prefer to mix all ingredients in a ziploc bag and marinate the fish in that in the fridge. In a hurry I have only marinated it for about 30 min, and it still turns out pretty good.

This salmon is excellent and I will make it at least once a month.

My only issue is that it was emailed to me (from All Recipes) as 1 of 5 "no fuss dinners" and then I saw that the total time from start to finish was 2 hours.  When you get home from work at 6:00 pm,  2 hours later is late to feed your family (adding 1/2 hour more because I am not going to start cooking the second I walk in the door). There are plenty of fresh fish recipes that don't take this long.  I would certainly do this on a Saturday or Sunday.  This is not a slight against the author but perhaps All Recipes needs to realize that "no fuss" is certainly under 2 hours (Monday to Friday)

Excellent, thanks for posting it. According to the other reviews, I half the oil,the salt and the pepper and it was perfect for me. Also I marinated them overnight for lunch and browned the filets 30 second each side to give them a nice color. Then put them on the baking dish covering it with foil and they were ready and juicy in 10 minutes. Great recipe.

Absolutely loved this recipe and it was very easy to make, especially for a "novice" cook. I made the following changes and it really turned out well! I ended marinating the entire salmon fillet (1.18 lbs) instead of individual 6 oz fillets, for 15 minutes instead of an 1 hr because I was short on time. I followed the ingredients to a tee, with the exception of using dried parsley instead of fresh parsley. I also topped the fillet with fresh onions, while marinating in the refrigerator. I covered the entire fillet and cooked it for about 40 minutes. I also added 1 tablespoon of butter on top of the fillet the last 10 minutes of cooking it...and Voilà! It was nothing but pure goodness! My husband loved it as well...and he is an avid cook!

This was really good but it calls for too much oil.  Next time will just use 1 or 2 T of olive oil.  I had only used 1/2 t salt as recommended by others and it was plenty salty.  We would definitely make this again.  Our salmon was cooked at about 25 minutes so watch it closely.

Good recipe, I made it for 4 so I doubled the recipe and mine turned out a little too salty so I might have to use half as much salt next time but other than that it was very good and I will be making this again.  Thanks for putting up your recipe!

This recipe is quick, easy and incredibly delicious! As others suggested, I used 2 tbsp of olive oil and kept all other measurements the same. It made the perfect marinade. I sprayed a baking dish, put the salmon in dish skin down, spread marinade on top, covered with foil and refrigerated for about half an hour. I cooked it in the oven as directed (was done perfectly in 25 min) except went directly from fridge to oven with the foil still covering dish. (I did not individually wrap the salmon in foil.) Everyone loved it! Can't wait to make it again.

I love this Salmon however...the recipe calls for 6 tablespoons of olive oil...I only use 2 tablespoons and it's much easier on the weight watchers points..and it tastes just as yummy...you don't need all the oil!

I have never made anything with salmon except salmon croquettes.  This is AMAZING!!!  I made a double portion for my family of 4 and everyone loved it!  I was sad there wasn't more!  The only thing I did differently was letting it sit in the marinade a little longer (3 hours) and I baked them all together in pyrex covered in aluminum foil instead of individually wrapping them.  Definitely making this again!

Simple and easy marinade...it really lets the salmon shine. Make sure you let it marinate for the hour to avoid a fishy taste. I have tried making salmon a few different ways and always end up back to this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I have never been a fan of salmon but since my eating habits need to change due to high cholesterol, I've been trying to find new ways to prepare salmon.  This recipe was one of, if not, the best I've found.  Loved it.  I also doubled the garlic.

I may add less olive oil next time I make this because it did seem like a bit too much. However, with that said, my husband, myself, and my picky 2 1/2 year old loved this salmon recipe. It was ultra easy with wonderful results. Adding it to my make often recipe binder.

I never liked salmon as I thought it was too fishy tasting but we decided to give this a try since we are trying to eat healthier.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I baked the salmon in the foil covered casserole dish after marinating.  I also used a tsp of dried parsley instead of fresh.  I will definitely make again but will cut down on the amount of oil.

This recipe was okay, but not spectacular.  I  reduced the oil to 2 Tbs and baked for 23 minutes.  The fish was very moist and not the least bit dry.  However, I felt the flavors did not work well together.  I will not make this again.

This is a really tasty recipe and easy to put together. I would suggest using half the salt and half the pepper. It ended up being pretty salty and really peppery. Other than that, it was delicious.

I loved this recipe. The salmon was thoroughly cooked without being limp and soggy, which my family does not like! I put the salmon and marinade into the banking dish then covered the dish with aluminum foil. 45 minutes was exactly right.

This was phenomenal! I followed the recipe all except I used dried parsley rather than fresh. My only recommendation would be to cut back on the salt a little bit. I'd rather put too little and salt it when I'm eating it, then have it be too salty. Otherwise, is was probably my favorite salmon receipe.

I went along with some other people and changed the original recipe.  It was blah for us.  So next time I will put in 2T eevo, no butter, 2.5tsp garlic powder, and 3T lemon juice.  I will also just leave it in the casserole dish and cover it to bake after marinading.  I will work with it till we like it as my daughter says it is heavenly.

I love this qick, easy and super delicious way of making salmon.  The flavors pop in your mouth!  The only thing I do is use a couple tablespoons of olive oil vs. six table spoons.

Made this for the first time tonight, and it is just wonderful. Even my very picky kids liked it, and they don't like anything. As others have said, you can cut back on the oil a bit. But other than that, it's really perfect.

This was great! I did as a few suggested and added about a tablespoon of butter to the mixture. Served it with rice, broccoli and cheese, and garlic bread. My husband, who is very skeptical of my cooking, really loved it!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was so delicious!  I opened the foil and removed the skin at the end, and broiled it for a few minutes.  It did have alot of oil, but we drizzled it over the fish when we served it.  Served with lemon rice.  Kids loved it too!  Thank you for sharing!

This was my first experience working with fresh salmon and it was excellent! I ended up grilling it instead of baking it because it was unusually warm for October yesterday. This was honestly the best salmon I've ever had!

All I can say is WOW!!!  This is now my favorite baked fish recipe. I had 3 pieces and could have eaten more.  I added a little more lemon juice and half of the olive oil for a whole pound of salmon.  Next time I'll only add half of the ground black pepper though.  You have to try this if you are a fish lover like me...WOW!  Try this...so good and so easy!

This was delicious.  I made small modifications to it out of personal taste and necessity.  I had lots of fresh basil in the herb garden, and no fresh parsley, so I reversed the quantities (about 1 tb of basil and a couple tsp of dried parsley), and I chopped a whole Scotch Bonnet pepper to add some kick to it (almost mandatory here in the Bahamas).  My wife goes through periods where fish just doesn't work for her, but she raved about this preparation.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I didn't have any garlic, but I used everything else. And I added some fresh dill. I also used fresh basil instead of the dried stuff. (Dried basil just doesn't seem to really add flavor.) Very moist. Very delicious. Very flavorful. And very easy! Will definitely be doing this as one of our go-to salmon recipes.

This tasted delicious! I didn't have basil, so I left that out. As suggested by others, I reduced the olive oil down to 2 tablespoons. Also, I reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and it STILL came out salty, so next time I'll just use a pinch. Otherwise, this was perfect!! Thanks.

I eat salmon frequently, and this is one of the best recipes ever.  Changes made from previous suggestions were less salt, pepper, and oil. All other ingredients the same.  I baked a very large fillet at 375 UNCOVERED for 25 minutes and broiled for 5.

No need to marinate. Place salmon fillets on parchment paper on baking sheet. Brush with olive oil, sprinkle with purchased salmon seasoning, or lemon juice, dill and paprika. Bake in 400F oven for approximately 10 mins.  Do not overcook -it gets dry and strong tasting.

I have used this recipe about 5 times now, and it is consistantly delicious. The last time I used it was with one large fillet (1.79 lbs). My advice for anyone who is using a large fillet similar to the one I used is to line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and use that for both marinading and baking. Also, divide the total number of ounces in your fillet by 6 (the serving size used for this recipe) and use the total as your number of servings (16 ounces = 1 lb, 18 ounces /6 ounces=3  servings). Using that formula my fillet turned out most excellently and was a big hit with everyone in my family.

Had this tonight for dinner and it was a huge smash with the family!  The only thing I did differently was to reduce the olive oil to 4 tablespoons and I just let it marinate all afternoon till I was ready to bake it.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was great. I've never enjoyed salmon so much. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used about one and half pounds of salmon, and it came out perfectly. Loved it and will definitely do this again.

Excellent and very tasty recipe with few adjustments: 1/2 the amount of ground black pepper and olive oil. Even my 2 year old daughter (and the 6 and 10 year olds) loved it! A keeper!

This was a very quick and easy recipe! Plus I had all the ingredients on hand :) I followed the recipe exactly- however I used fresh basil and dried parsley since I grow fresh basil. I used all 6 tablespoons of olive oil per the instructions and all that did was create more marinade. I added the remaming marinade to my green beans. Salmon is my fish of choice and we eat it a few times a week. I was happy to come across this recipe!! Highly recomened!

Outrageously simple and easy to prepare with astonishing flavor!   I agree with a previous review - I wish I could give it 6 stars.  This was my first time ever preparing fish for dinner, and it was wonderful.  New staple in my house!

The only Salmon I've ever liked was when my Finnish in-laws smoked some while I was visiting Finland. This is the first time I have EVER liked eating Salmon in America! This recipe is delicious! I would used less salt next time as it was a little on the salty side. Less olive oil may also help if you are conscious of excess oils. Yummy! I will be making this again! It was a great hit!

I don't eat fish so my rating is based on a super picky husband who LOVED it!  The only thing I changed was I added a little bit of dill.  The only negative comment my husband made was, "This was GREAT but I think next time maybe leave off the dill."    I suggest preparing exactly as it says. It was cooked perfectly, and turned out pretty and flaky.
I did as another suggested and put a big piece of foil in the glass dish, THEN added the oil and other ingredients. I wrapped it up while in the dish, cooked it and the dish comes out clean. Great idea and easy clean up.

After reading other reviews, I cut down the oil to 2 tablespoons.   I also increased the garlic to 4 cloves based on personal preference.   I didn't bother wrapping the fillets - I just baked them in the glass dish with foil on top.   They came out great!  Will definitely make these again!

This was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used 1 tsp of dried and I added a 1/2 tsp dill just because I really like dill with salmon. It was so good! I got rave reviews from my husband and BOTH of my kids ate it without complaining (which at this stage of their lives is a big deal). This recipe is easy and gives great results. Try it!

this is delicious and easy. i've made it twice and both times it went over amazingly well. the second time i had to make the marinade on my lunch break, so the fish marinaded 5 hours instead of 1 and it turned out much better than the first time, with much more flavor. I always skin the salmon. I also forgot the lemon juice the second time but it was fine.

This wasn't bad.  It had decent flavor and it was easy; plus, the items are easily found in my spice cabinet.  I would make this again if I had all the ingredients, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to make it, as it wasn't spectacular.  Still good, though.

Very good.  My only recommendation would be to cut the oil down by 2 TBS.  I marinated the fish in the tin foil from the start.  I would also cut the cook time down to 25 mins.

this recipe is amazing!  I did add a couple slices of brie cheese to the top after it was done baking and it was delicious.

Simple & Good.
Use the glass ovenware to mix the seasoning & marinate next time. 
Added bit of ground ginger, dried dill as well. Only used 3T of Oil and it was enough.

My husband: "This is the best salmon I have ever tasted!"  Enough said.  For easier marinating, I put all the ingredients in a gallon plastic bag.

My husband called it amazing!  I had no dried basil so I used dill.  I did have some Mrs. Dash Tomato Basil Sprinkle, I used a dash of that with a bit of salt and pepper.  I used minced garlic generously and I used one heavy pour tablespoon of xtra virgin olive oil.  All that for a HUGE 2+ pound salmon from Costco.  You do not need a lot of oil for this recipe. I followed the baking instructions and hands down, best salmon I've ever had!

Pretty good. I like it spicier so I added some pepper flakes and a bit more black pepper. It's a great starter recipe that you can take and make your own! Thanks for sharing!

First time fixing this salmon. My husband raved and raved about it, saying it's the best salmon he has ever had.  It turned out so, so flaky and tasty...a must try!  The only thing I did different was use 3 tbsp rather than 3 tbsp of olive oil.  Definitely a repeat!

wonderful. i made a few adjustments though... I used a teaspoon of butter instead of oil, and microwaved it for 30 seconds with 2 cloves of garlic crushed into it. Then I added the rest of the ingredients to the butter and garlic,and poured over the fish... I didn't even need to marinade. When you seal the garlic into the foil like that it really infuses the fish - doesn't have a choice really! My kids LOVED it. We've vowed to make it every week. Delicious!

I was incredibly reluctant - unconvinced that this combination of flavors would be good. It was very, very good! I only put in half of the amount of salt, and that was fine. I was surprised that it wasn't too garlicky given the amount if garlic in the recipe. I also only used dried herbs - again, all good. Would recommend!

The salmon was OK, not bad by any means... but not something I'll make again.  I have tried TONS of salmon recipes and I wasn't impressed by this one.  I didn't feel as if the seasoning gave it enough flavor.

I cut the oil in half, used dried parsley and baked in glass pan covered with foil.  I was afraid that it would overcook with the 35 min cooking time but turned out perfect.  I kind of think this marinade would taste good on any type of meat so def a keeper.

Absolutely delicious as is!  The only change I will make next time is to use a bit less olive oil.  So fantastic, my 6 year old asks me to make it at least once a week!  Would give ten stars if I could!

Excellent recipe!  My husband loved this salmon!  I baked 4 fillets and so tripled the ingredient amounts.  Proportionally, though, I did add less sea salt, pepper, and olive oil.   More fresh garden parsley and dill was added.  The salmon was baked in a dish covered by aluminum foil.  Cooked marinade in the pan was wonderful over rice.  Will make this again!  THANK YOU Ladyblade for this recipe!

Delicious! I cut down on the salt by 1/2 tsp because my husband is on a diet and should not eat too much salt. Other than that I followed the recipie to a T and it was just great! I will be making this part of our regular menu. YUM!!

This was a great recipe! Easy and delicious. I couldn't stop taking bites of it. The way the oil soaks in the fish makes it melt in your mouth a little. It smelled great, even though I used dried parsley. Still good.

Really easy salmon recipe.  I decreased the olive oil, eliminated the parsley, and cooked the salmon with a few slices of lemon in the glass pan.  It turned out delicious and I'm happy with this recipe, will be making it again.

The best salmon I have ever made!  Even my kids gobbled it up and were disappointed there wasn't more.  I did use pesto paste w/sundried tomatoes instead of regular basil...I think it was a good choice.  Yummmmmmmmm!

All I can say is WOW!  I love fish dishes and by far, this is one of the Best salmon recipes i've had.  I did change the porpotions of ingredients a bit!  I added more lemon juice and Garlic ( i love garlic) and only about  4 tsb. of olive oil (that's more than enough for 2 six oz. of fillet salmons).  Also, I marinated the fillets for about three hours  Everyone should at least give this simple and delicious recipe a try, even though your're not a big fan of fish.  TWO THUMBS UP!!

this was good, still tasted like salmon :) Though that isn't the fault of the recipe.  My two year old and five you ate it, so that says something.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I now make this all the time and everyones raves.  I do only use about 3 TBS of olive oil and use 2 TBS of lemon juice, but keep the rest of the ingredients as in in  the original.  So easy!

This was very good!  I was looking for healthy dishes and this is perfect for watching your figure,  I just used more lemon and added extra herbs because that can never hurt!  I love that it was simple and when I used dry herbs I had most the ingredients on hand.

Probably needless to say AGAIN but I also eliminated the suggested amnt of olive oil... Only used a capful measuring w/the top that came on my Olive Oil. Salmon is already oily naturally as is, so u only need to add a small amt to enhance the meal. Honestly didnt have the time to marinate it for an hour prior, so I seasoned it w/all ingredients listed WELL and put it directly in the oven, and it STILL had a marvelous flavor. Will marinade in the future when time allows!

This was delicious! I think I used less oil, but I didn't measure. I only marinaded about 25 minutes, and instead of the foil method, I just put the salmon in a glass dish with foil on top and cooked about 25-30 minutes.

Just my made this salmon for the first time and it was truly amazing. One of the best salmon dishes I have ever had - and I converted my boyfriend, who previously would not eat fish. He liked this!  On suggestions below, I also used only 3 T olive oil, and omitted the parsley.  I added some dill.  I did not have time to marinate, so I drizzled the marinade on top of the fish in a glass baking dish, covered w foil and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. Also made white rice and poured the leftover marinade from the baking dish on top of the rice.  It was incredible.

Delicious! The salmon came out with a beautiful texture and excellent flavor. It was a tad bit salty for my taste- next time I will try halving the salt. Will definitely make again!

While my husband thought this was PERFECT, I thought it was delicious, but slightly over-seasoned.  I would cut back on the seasons a little bit next time.

Perfect tasting salmon, but MASSIVE amount of olive oil (360 calories per serving of oil).  I so much enjoyed it earlier this evening, but didn't realize how much oil was there.  Agree with other reviewers and will try something along their modifications --- much less oil, perhaps a wine/clear base added, additional lemon juice (I love lemon).  35 minutes was more than enough for my 3 servings (6 ounces per fillet).  I hate to report this, but I feel slightly nauseous now (4 hours later), likely due to the high fat content (sorry).   But this will be perfect with, say, 1 or 2 tsp of oil with perhaps a little butter (or none at all) --- I'll have to experiment!!!!

Made it using 6 four oz fillets. Cooked it for 35 minutes. For this quantity of fish I doubled the ingredients except for the oil and butter. I used 4 tbs oil and 2 tbs butter. I didn't have time to marinate I had to cook it immediately and it still turned out awesome. My picky 6 year old wolfed it down!

I didn't have fresh or dried parsley but it still came out very good. I would have to say it was a little too salty but overall flavor was great! Next time I'll have to add parsley and reduce the salt a little bit.

Best salmon recipe thus far! My family loved it. We added dill weed and cut back on some olive oil and replaced it with butter (we decreased the salt added too). We served the salmon with some roasted balsamic glazed veggies and the garlic parmesan orzo from allrecipes.com. The dish was delicious and easy! We used the left overs to make Oregon Salmon Patties for lunch the next day (also very yummy!).

Great recipe. Both my hubby and my 2 year old granddaughter loved it. I marinated and baked the salmon in a glass dish, then covered it with foil and baked as directed. It came out very moist and delicious. This is a keeper.

Oh my!  This was great.  I was in a hurry, so I didn't marinate mine, and I threw everything in a glass baking dish and baked it un-covered.  Delicious!!!

We made this last night and it was excellent!I'm not a huge "Salmon Fan" and I usually like it blackened. This was amazing! Best Salmon I ever ate and for once I finished the whole filet, lol. I marinaded them for about 20 minutes and cooked them at 450 for about 7-8 minutes on each side. Perfect. Thank you for a great and easy recipe!

This is an amazing dish. It's so full of flavor. I did marinate the Salmon in foil rather than just the dish and it turned out great! I served with Broccoli and rice. It was a hit, even with my boyfriend who isn't a huge fan of Salmon!

First time making salmon and this was AMAZING! I decreased the olive oil to 2-3 tablespoons, which was perfect, and added some fresh dill into the marinade. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a quick and easy way to whip up the best, fresh seafood right at home. A+!

Great marinade. I think the secret to this is getting wild Alaskan salmon, not farmed fish. You will sure notice the difference!

This was a wonderful salmon dish!  I did not use parsley (I do not like parsley) but followed the rest of the recipe with just a little less basil and it was excellent.  I find any time I use olive oil with salmon that it turns out very moist and flavorful; so I new I could not go wrong with this recipe!

Great dish. Easy to make and no babysitting. I did add a little bit of butter and I also turned the oven on broil for 5 mins. which gave it great color. My entire family loved it.

I made this for a party of 13 people and everyone said it was the best salmon they ever had.  The only things I did differently was used half the amount of oil, used extra virgin olive oil, and marinated it for 4 hours.  An hour probably would have been fine, but I think marinating makes a big difference as the salmon was very moist and tender.

My family and I love this recipe.  It's easy, and it's very tasty.  The only modification I made was to use regular extra virgin olive oil instead of light olive oil.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing, and it was delicious.

My guests did not say they liked this nor did they say they didn't like it.  When no one comments on a meal I take that as "we don't really like it."   I myself thought the recipe was mediocre, but the salmon was previously frozen so it was a bit dry.  It would have probably tasted better if the fish were moist and flaky.

It was scrumptious though I did cut down on the oil as recommended. Fish cooking usually scares me but this was easy!

excellent!!! I am just getting into eating salmon and i must say this is such a nice way to enjoy it.  A Shiraz red wine goes well with it.

Just like the recipe says it was EASY ! I'm never one to shy away from cooking since its a passion but since I don't eat fish I never cook it. My boyfriend brought home two big salmon fillets and asked me to cook them. I was clueless on what do do with it and he is dangerous when let near a kitchen lol Soooo.. it was all up to me. And after trying one bite he said it was delicious. I even had some and for not liking fish it was pretty good. This will be one for my recipe box !

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I marinated the Salmon all afternoon and followed the directions to seal in aluminum foil.  The meat was so soft, it almost melts in your mouth.

It was delicious, followed the instructions and tweaked it as the other reviewers suggested. 2T olive oil, 1T melted butter, 3T lemon juice, halfed the salt and I even added lemon slices on top of the salmon before sealing it in aluminium bags before putting it in the oven. Came out moist and juicy(lots of juice to pour on the rice bed). Only baked it for 10 mins though. 35 mins seems too long. Didn't have parsley but will give that a try next time. I only gave it 4 stars because I put 2 garlic cloves which gave it a nice mild taste, though next time I'll double it for a stronger flavour. Was worried we put too much garlic initially but it still turned out very well. My BF who's not much of a fish person loved it and had double helpings. Will definately make it again next time. Thanks. =)

This was tasty but I give it 3 stars cause it was way too salty and I'm a salt pheen. I followed the recipe exactly but I highly recommend everyone to decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp otherwise it will be way too salty.

One of the best baked salmon recipes out there. It's simple. and healthy. I don't add the salt and it still is wonderful and healthier! I do add a 1/4 of chardonnay to help it stay moist and excelerate the absorbtion of all of the fresh herbs and garlic! I recommend this recipe to any and all persons trying to find a simple salmon recipe! My husband hates Salmon and he loves this one!

We enjoyed this recipe on Boxing day. It was great but I did not marinate the salmon in oil as I felt that the fish was oily enough and it tasted real good.

this was excellent. about 95% of the time i try and cook fish of any kind, i am bitterly disappointed. for some reason i can't get fish right.   this came out perfect! just like i would eat in a good restaurant. my 8 year old loved it and asked for seconds and i usually have to force to eat just a few bites of salmon. this was great!

I have another baked salmon recipe to compare this one too and I like the other one better.  My wife liked this more than I did and she isnt a fish eater.  It's worth a try if you want something easy.

This was very good - great for when I want to enjoy a simple salmon dish.  I had to sub lime juice, and it was great too.  I will use this a lot.

Delicious! I did end up marinating a few hours. I used the leftovers the next day on rosemary bread, mashed up with a little mayonnaise (better than tuna anyday). Thanks for the recipe

My in-laws brought me some salmon they had just caught that morning so I tried some recipes out. This was absolutely lovely! I took the advice of some other reviewers and cut down on the oil and salt. The result was delicate and immensely satisfying at the same time. Thank you!

Fantastic dish!!! I really loved it. I marinated mine the night before and it retained an excellent flavor. Baking it in the tin foil helps to keep it moist. Really, really delicious. Will use this recipe from now on.

Absolutely love this recipe! It makes me not even want to try others. I added lemon zest so the lemon flavor really sticks. Also, instead of just dried basil, I used an Italian Spices mix.

Delicious!!! I just finished baking this along with Maui Maui and it came out just right!!! I marinaded it in some  Teriyaki & Ginger Marinade I got from BJ's wholesale and added some Salmon Seasoning after baking and it hit the spot. This will help me lose my 20 lbs. Thanks for sharing!!!

Delish! I added a lot of butter and dill to the mixture and melted it. Then I baked the salmon on a cookie sheet and occasionally basted it with the butter. Loved it!

MMMMM! Delicious!  My husband actually made this, he's a rookie cook and he did an excellent job.  A great and simple recipe, though I think the cooking time is too long, for me anything longer than 10-15 min makes the salmon dry. All and all a great and quick recipe!

I was in a hurry so I bought the salmon at Trader Joe's and defrosted 1/2 way. Marinated until it defrosted (about 1/2 the time) in powdered garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper, and fresh squeezed lemon juice of one lemon. I baked for 35 min, but thing 30 would have been *perfect*. Super easy, delicious, and healthy- will make again!

I appericate this recipe and another one I found on this site with the idea of cooking in foil. Not being a fan of salmon (except smoked and with a beer) this recipe makes my weekly salmon dinner okay to deal with. Do cut the oil to 4 TBLS., everything else the same

I don't like fish, but my husband does.  I don't even know how to cook fish.  The few times I've tried it hasn't been very good.  So I made this dish & my husband raved about it.  I ate some of it too!  This was very easy to make.  I took some other people's suggestions & reduced the oil to 2 tbs. and the salt and pepper to 1/2 tsp.

This was delicious!  I used 3 tablespoons of olive oil rather than 6 and no salt at all.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and will make it again. I served it with roasted asparagus and white rice simmered with fresh lemon thyme.

Very good!I used only 2 tbsp. olive oil and used freshly squeezed lime juice instead of the lemon juice. I also thinly sliced some limes and placed them on the salmon. The salmon was very moist and did not dry out.

Delicious! I'm quite pleased with how this turned out. Honestly you could use less olive oil though as in the end I had a ton of it left over. I'd make it again!

I wasn't sure if i'd like this or not, because I'm not a big fan of basil - but this actually was fantastic. I lowered the olive oil, upped the garlic (considerably), used sea salt & lowered that as well. Next time I'll decrease the basil as well (it wasn't overpowering by any means, but it masked the garlic flavor a bit too much). I marinated it for about 6hrs, baked in my toaster oven and it was super delish! I tend to fly by the seat of my pants while cooking, and I adapt recipes a lot to my own liking .... but really, you can't go wrong w/this recipe. Everyone scarfed - and I wish I would have made more :)  On another note, I made wild rice as one of the sides .... ugh, *I* found it foul!! Growing up w/mostly white rice, I'm not surprised ... but if someone has a tip/trick to make that stuff not so nasty, I'd appreciate it. Maybe a good way to season it up, or a specific brand they like - feel free to pass along some input. XOXO

It was simply amazing. It was gone so quickly that I didn't even have time to take a picture. We will try to contain ourselves next time :P  Guided by previous reviews I halved the olive oil, reduced the amount of salt and added a tiny bit more lemon juice. It was divine: juicy and flavourful.  I am considering making this for my sweetheart on her birthday :) Thank you for such a superb recipe!

This is a simple, never fail recipe!  I have used this for a variety of fish (cod, tilapia, etc) and messed with the ingredients - lemon/pepper, parmesan/garlic - and it turns out perfectly every time.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

This had a really good taste but was too much sauce for the amount of fish we had. We did have less than the recipe but I would recommend cutting this amount in half or 75% because it came out too peppery and salty. Will definitely make again but pay more attention to the amount of sauce I put on the fish.

I personally don't like fish but I made this for my parents who is a big fan of fish.  I didn't have salmon at home so I used Basa fillets and followed the exact recipe.  Very easy to make and my parents loved it

We eat salmon at least once a week so I'm always looking for new recipes. Can't help but be a little disappointed with this one. Not sure what we did differently than everyone else, but it seemed like the cooking time was way too long. Our salmon was dry, and we had thicker cut fillets, too. Oh well.

I made this last night because my bf was requesting a baked salmon dish.  I do not care for fish at all (but i love sushi lol) but made this anyways.  My bf thought it was ok, and so did I.  He likes fish.  It was actually a really pretty dish though.  I did follow some suggestions and coated all sides of the fish with the sauce and breading.

I followed suggestions from other users and it was...fantastic.  My 8 year old, who despises fish, ate most of mine.  Another family member who isn't all that fond of salmon loved this as well.  Served with white rice and steamed veggies.

This was so delicious! I made it for my husband's grandmother's birthday party and everyone loved it! I used half butter, half olive oil as suggested by other reviewers and it came out perfect. My husband's aunt even asked for the recipe! Thank you so much.

This recipe was awesome!!! I used a ziploc bag to marinate, only marinated for 45 min, used a heaping tbsp of minced garlic and used all dried herbs.  My 4 kids LOVED it and even I who has never been a huge salmon fan was won over for sure! I will make this again and again.

This recipe was very tasty however we found it to be a bit much with the seasoning. We liked the flavor but next time I would use less of everything. I do recommend this.

Very good recipe!  I doubled the marinade because I used a large filet and cut the salt in half.  Even my non-fish-loving husband liked it!  I didn't have time to let it marinate very long (only 45 min.) and it was still very tasty.

Recipe is OK but nothing special. And cook time is all wrong. Tried 35 minutes the first time. Even with the marinade sealed in the packets of foil, the fish was dried out. Cut the time to 20 minutes the second time I tried it and it was much better but still only average flavor wise.

Great recipe; I too lowered the amount of olive oil, probably to about 4 Tbs. This was my first time making salmon because my husband isn't a fan of seafood (what is wrong with him?!). However, he was recently diagnosed with a vitamin b12 deficiency so we decided it was time for him to start eating fish. He actually really liked it! As he said "it tastes like generic fish instead of fishy fish."  There is no 'fishiness', however I followed the advice of another reviewer and cut off the skin prior to marinading and baking. Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful recipe!! I had never made fish before in my life, and I was so happy with how this salmon turned out. I actually made 3 filets instead of 2, so the 6 tbsps of olive oil was perfect, and not too much. I followed the recipe exactly and the salmon was juicy and delicious. Will definitely make again!

Try just 1 teaspoon of pepper and salt, even if the salmon amount is larger.  Last time put 3 teaspoons of pepper and salt and the salt stayed at the bottom and the pepper, I had to scrap off.  Marinating the salmon is key, cooked for 10 min, flip additional 5 and turn off the oven.  Very soft fish

I adjusted this recipe a bit to cut down on some of the calories.  I only use 2 tablespoons of olive oil and then the juice of one lemon. I then double the parsley and basil. When you mix it all together it makes more of a rub that you press onto the salmon. This has become a real family favorite!

This was an excellent salmon recipe.  I didn't have time to marinate it so I just soaked it and then baked it.  Still had an excellent flavor.

Like some other reviewers, I am trying to get my family to eat healthier and I have added more fish to my monthly menu rotation. This was delicious.  It makes a beautiful presentation and was very flavorful.  I removed the skin from the fillets as recommended by another reviewer and followed the recipe exactly. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because it was too oily for our taste.  This recipe is a keeper but next time I make it, I'm reducing the olive oil.

Enough seasoning for more salmon than the recipe suggested I thought. But very good!

Awesome!  I baked at 350 for about 35 minutes as I had a side dish already baking at that temp.  Also, I didn't have a lemon so I omitted the pepper and sprinkled everything with lemon pepper.

This is the one and only main dish my entire family can agree on. It is great even for fussy eaters. It is also very easy, and is great to serve to guests - it is very impressive looking to them. Its appearance and taste makes it seem to them like I'm some gourmet cook. I've made this one many times and have never had anyone that wasn't looking for seconds.

Easy dish and so tasty. I followed the recipe except I just baked in an open glass dish in a 375 oven for 22 minutes. My husband loved it. I also didn't have any parsley so left it off. It was delicious!

The marinade was very easy and smelled divine!... we even forgot to flip it while marinating but it turned out just fine. We will make this a thousand times more.

My husband's quote: "The best salmon I have EVER had". It was DELICIOUS!!! Even my picky 4 y.o. ate a whole serving! 
Needs a few minor changes: half the salt (salty) and pepper amount; decrease the oil (I don't know by how much, I just kind of estimated); and keep everything the same! Thanks so much for great recipe. Will make this one from now on.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe. I have made this a few times with the only change being 1/2 of the olive oil (and that is only because I was doubling the recipe and 3/4 of a cup of olive was just not necessary, the standard 6 tbls worked for the 4 filets as well). It is GREAT. I have been using frozen salmon though and hope to get fresh one day and try it that way...I bet THAT would really awesome. Thank you SO much for a great Salmon recipe.

This was the first time I've ever cooked salmon and it was delicious!  I doubled the recipe and made these changes (these are the total amounts I used): 4T oil, 2T melted butter, 4T lemon juice, several dashes dried dill, 2tsp dried parsley, 1 tsp salt (the other ingredients listed in the recipe were simply doubled).  I also skinned the fish before marinating it. When it was ready to bake I just covered the glass dish with foil and popped it in the oven. Delicious! Poured the extra sauce over a side of Orzo and vegetables.  Next time I may further reduce the oil/butter combo, and maybe the lemon (but just a tad).

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was really tasty. One thing--way too salty!!! Next time I make this I will add half the salt and maybe a little less pepper. Otherwise, a yummy, healthy recipe with a lot of easily available ingredients!

great & easy recipe. i reduced the olive oil as well, to 1 tablespoon. & i reduced both salt & pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. i've made this many times & it is very tasty! i used this marinade on chicken breast pieces as well & they turned out just as good. i cut them into pieces, put the marinade over & bake uncovered for 30 minutes. this is a very good & easy recipe. prep time takes 5 minutes & you pop it in the oven & it's done! thanks for the recipe!

If you're trying to decide which recipe to use for salmon, use this one!  It was much more delicious than I was expecting.  I halved the olive oil, added a little extra lemon juice, and served with whole wheat couscous...perfect!

Yummy! I did have to pour out some of the oil after marinating, if was a bit too much to bake it in. I used a whole 1.75 lb. salmon filet and used the ingredients for 4 servings, and there was plenty of marinade. Covered baking dish with foil.

The salmon was wonderfully moist.  My boyfriend and I used 4 tbsp of olive oil instead of 6 and it was just enough.  My boyfriend gave it a 4.5, I gave it a 4 because although it was very moist, I didn't think it had any really special flavor to it.  I'll definitely make this again, it's a great salmon recipe but next time I'll play with the ingredients a little more to give it more flavor and maybe a little bit of a kick.

Great Recipe!  Fast, easy and tastes great, it doesn't get better than that.  I didn't have parsley or basil on hand.  So I substituted with fresh coriander and a little extra garlic and was really good.  Thanks!

Very nice recipe, though I have made it three times and found that half the oil is enough. Easy and delicious. Do make sure to use fresh over frozen salmon, and check part way through, as it is easy to overcook it. Can also try white pepper and fresh basil!

Really GREAT recipe! None of the flavors stand out more than the others (lemon or garlic etc.), they all just blend together to make a mouth-watering salmon. I made it for Father's Day and it was a huge hit!

I liked this alot. My husband drowned his in hot sauce, and my son poured melted butter on top of his, but I thought it was fine as is. I wasn't able to marinate them and actually had to get them started while still partially frozen. So it will probably be even better after some time to marinate. I will make this regulary. I think it's important to keep salmon quite simple since it has so much natural flavor on its own.

"mmmm... the fish is really tasty." This was just one of the comments from the group I served this dish to last night. Since I don't eat salmon myself, I had to ask "what about it is good?" The answer was "the seasoning," so clearly the marinade is a winner. The cooking technique was very easy and right-on time wise, too. Thanks for helping me hit a home run. So easy, too.

I cut the oil down to 1 tbsp and added 1 tbsp melted butter.  Strong flavored marinade, but yummy.  My hubby doesn't like salmon and the marinade takes away from the fishy taste.

5 Stars were not enough for this recipe. I followed the ingredients exactly, which I rarely do, and this one came out amazing.

Very good, I did not marinate mine but next time I will so the flavor is all the way through the fillet instead of just on it.

The marinade was really good, but I think I might prefer it to be pan-seared rather than baked.

Very good! It smelled fabulous as it was baking. I used half of both olive oil and salt and it tasted wonderful. Very easy to prepare and baking in foil leaves no mess.

Made this with 2 T. olive oil, 1 T. melted butter, 3/4 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 3 T ORANGE (didn't have a lemon) juice, 1 tsp dried parsley, and did NOT have dill weed.  I did not marinate since I didn't have time, but it came out pretty good.  It's nice to have a salmon recipe that you can have in the oven while you prepare the side dishes.  We'll make it again.

I have never made fish of any kind before this.  MY FAMILY FLIPPED!  It was fantastic.  I used Ital. Seasoning instead of basil, but followed the rest exactly.
Thanks for sharing this one!

Great recipe--just needs less oil used.  I used half of the amount given on the recipe and it was plenty.  I also used a splash of white wine in the marinade.

Very good recipe! Will decrease the salt just a little next time, but otherwise great. You must grill or pan fry (plenty of oil on the fish because of the marinade so no need to put oil in the pan) this!!!! The "crust" on the outside cooking using on of these methods is delicious!!!

This was my very first attemp at cooking salmon and we all loved it! Even the three year old! I used a lot of other people's recommendations; only used 2 tbsp. oil and added 1 tbsp. melted butter, used half the basil, salt and pepper, used 2 tbsp. lemon juice and I used fresh cilantro instead of parsley just because we really like cilantro! Yummy! Will make again.

I found the salmon to become mushy and flavorless. It seemed to steam the texture and taste right out. I'll stick to pan-seared or grilled. But thanks anyway!

This is delicious and very simple.  Both my boys (ages 7 and 10) enjoyed it.  I decreased the olive oil and salt....still tasty.  To save time and clean-up, I marinaded the salmon in the foil in the glass dish; then just take from fridge to oven.

Based on reviews, I used only 2 TBS. olive oil, half the salt, and doubled the lemon juice.  I also added a shake of dill.  I didn't have parsley, but it wasn't missed.  This is very light and delicious.  We make it often around here with steamed broccoli or asparagus and couscous. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very, very easy.  The salmon came out moist with good flavor through the whole thing.  Instead of olive oil, though, I used grapeseed oil infused with garlic.  It came out great!

I chose this recipe because it looked easy and had lots of great reviews. After cooking it for dinner, I was very disappointed---it was oily, salty, lemony and way too much basil or was it parsley? I could hardly taste the 'salmon' at all. Thanks, but I think I'll pass.

This is such an easy fool proof way to impress anyone.  It is also versatile in that you could use butter instead of Olive Oil and I didnt even measure out the ingredients, I just guesstimated.  I did use crushed garlic and added a little more then called for.  I have used this with halibut and white salmon as well.  It will be hard for me to make salmon or halibut any other way from now on.

Love this recipe.  I too modified it:
For 4 pieces of salmon:  4 teaspoons of crushed garlic.  Used cilantro instead of parsley. Used 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of lime juice. Used only 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of canola oil/olive oil blend.
Used a stone baking dish and baked at 400 for 15 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes.
Smells delicious and tastes fantastic!

I was pretty leary cooking this recipe but I really wanted to try it.  Of course I feel my personal recipe is the best so nothing else can stand a fighting chance, lol!

I REALLY liked this actually, and was quite surprised.  My g/f still prefers mine.  It had a completely different taste but very good.  I would try this again.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  It had a lot of flavor.  Although I didn't use lemon juice 4 out of 6 times that I made it but I honestly didn't see much difference when I did.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as usual.  Will definitly keep this recipe.  And it's so simple!

This was my first ever attempt at salmon...and I loved it! You definitely don't need that much oil, so cut it down, but otherwise it turned out great!

I make this often.  I'm single so I cut everything in half.  I tend to use a smaller amount of olive oil but that's just a perssonal preference.  Depending on the size of your galric cloves determines the flavor.  Just an observation when I started pulling apart my garlic bulb and used a large clove.  Good thing I like garlic.

My husband and I are huge salmon fans, and this recipe did not disappoint.  I did reduce the amount of oil, though, and took the suggestion of others by opening the packets for about 5 minutes at the end.  Delicious!

This came out soooo yummy!  I did tweak a tad.  I used 1tsp fresh basil minced, 1 tbsp fresh parsley, and two cloves fresh minced garlic.  Marinated as directed.  I placed my fillets in a 13x9 inch glass dish and just covered with foil instead of the individual wrap.  OH my how yummy.  Will kepp this one for future use.

My husband loved this.  I made it pretty much exactly as listed.  It was flaky and tender and full of flavor.  We wanted to incorporate more fish into our diet because of the health benefits.  I have no experience preparing fish and this was my first attempt.  It was an easy recipe with great results.  I just bought more salmon tonight and plan to make it again!

Very good alternative recipe for salmon! I had a 2 lb. fillet and basically tripled everything except oil, salt and pepper.  I only used 1/4 cup oil, salmon is an oily fish anyway and used 1 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper plus about 1 big tablespoon chopped, fresh basil.  Put it all in a big ziplock to marinade for an hour.  Thank you for something different to do with my salmon!

Excellent and simple recipe to put together on a weeknight.  I used fresh basil leaves, extra garlic, and fresh lemon juice.  I also used only 2 TBS of olive oil per other user's suggestions.  A great salmon recipe that I can add to my rotation...thanks so much for sharing!

My son wants to give it more stars. We both loved it. Used one tablespoon of evoo for one fillet that we shared. Came out very moist, better than what I get in the restaurant. I add garlic and herb breadcrumbs on top for texture.

this recipe was so nice and simple! perfect if you don't want to drown out the flavor of the salmon. after marinading in the fridge i couldn't find my glass baking dish OR aluminum foil, so i baked it in a metal baking dish and shortened the baking time. still turned out great. definitely keeping this one around!

This is my favorite recipe for baking salmon. I would have given 5 stars, yet it's a bit oily. I like a light seasoning where you can still taste the fish; don't like all that sweet stuff. This fits the bill for my family.

Outstanding salmon recipe. I have made a few minor adjustments to suit our tastes. I use 8 cloves of garlic, because we love garlic. I cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup and if I don't have fresh parlsey I use 2 tsp dried. This is a recipe I make once a week and there is never any leftovers.

Great fish! I served it on white rice with squash and red peppers I fried in extra marinade and then I sprinkled a little bit of diced habonero peppers on top. My New York girlfriend even liked it (and she's a yankee)

This was my first time cooking salmon, and it was a big hit.  I've made it a couple of times since and added dill to the marinade.  The last time, I didn't have time to marinate the fish for an hour, so I rubbed some minced garlic on the salmon steaks, poured the marinade on top, and baked it as directed.  Still turned out great, and my boyfriend said he liked it even better that way!

This recipe turned out better than expected. We followed it to the letter, including cooking times, and ended up with a tender piece cooked perfectly.

I marinated the salmon as the recipe indicates and cooked it on my indoor grill.  The marinade was mild with a good flavor.  I will probably use it again.  Thanks...

This recipe was great.  I served it to my mother-in-law who hates Salmon.  I didn't know that, but even she said it was good.  I added a little more Garlic then it called for.  My husband said defintly will make it again.

This was really good. I did use a bit less oil as some suggested and grilled mine. I used freshly picked basil and parsley instead of dried, and it was great.

Delicious! If you're baking, definitely take all the skin off first otherwise you'll get a fishy smell and flavor. My parents loved it!

This recipie is absolutly perfect with very minor changes ... 
Like many of the previous reviews I used less oil and salt (cutting portion in half will suffice) and I also added basil and 2 - 3x more lemon.
I did not foil package the salmon, but instead baked in a glass dish sealed with foil.  
Perfect!!

I thought this was an absolutely awesome marinade/cooking liquid for the salmon. It is perfectly subtle, as it gives a definite flavor to the fish, without completely masking it. Super easy (had all the ingredients on hand) and even my two year old loved it. Will definitely make again!

This is such a great and simple dish to prepare. I have made this several times now and you can't mess this up. The only thing that I do differently is add more pepper and lemon juice. But, it is still great with no changes. Love this recipe!!

I loved this, and so did my guests. It was a nice light flavor to add to the salmon- not at all overpowering. I just kinda winged it on the olive oil (didn't use light),  probably did 4 tablespoons instead of six. I only did this because I didn't want it to turn out too oily. I also used three fillets instead of 2 and didn't adjust recipe besides the oil, and it was perfect. I think it would have been to oily if I used only two fillets, even with less oil.

I love this recipe.  It's very simple and compliments the fish very well.  I like it because if you marinate for an hour, the fishy taste of the salmon is minimal.  I did add in about twice the amount of lemon juice and added in more pepper and fresh parsley.

these turned out great. the only thing i suggest is to marinate them for about 30 mins prior to cooking to get the fish taste out.

My husband loves lemon, so I used 3T instead of just one, and just covered the glass dish with foil instead of individually wrapping. Turned out excellent, especially with the juices poured over couscous.

This recipe was soooo good. My family loves fish but sometimes gets tired of the same old dinner. This added a tasty twist to our usual salmon dinner. It was very easy and quick to make. Make it with some rice or light pasta and and some veggies, and you've got a yummy and healthy meal.I loved it. We will definitly make this one over and over again!

it's my signature dish! the only thing i do different, is i don't marinate the salmon. it takes away from the salmon taste.

This is scrumptious! I followed the ingredient list exactly. I had a single, 12 ounce salmon steak instead of two fillets and I only marinated it for about half an hour and it was absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it. This is my new salmon recipe!

I made this tonight and my husband  rated it a 5.  I used much less oil, added a little celery salt, some dried dill and a little bit of Old Bay. Broiled it a little at the end to crisp up the skin.  Very easy, very good.  Thanks.

I didn't actually follow the recipe as written but it turned out incredible anyway.  I just didn't have all the ingredients.  I used dried seasonings & lemon pepper because that was all I had on hand.  The salmon I bought was still frozen with the skin on one side so I seasoned it (let it thaw & marinade at the same time) overnight in the fridge.  Added rosemary and a bit of dill along with extra fresh minced garlic.  The next day when I cooked it wrapped tightly in the foil all the flavors had seeped into the fish and it had an outstanding flavor.  Next time I'd love to try the recipe as written.  I'm sure it's wonderful.

Definately a keeper! I also added an additional garlic clove and baked in oven with foil. My boyfriend even liked this recipe & he's not a big fish fan.

This was a great recipe! I added 5 garlic cloves instead of 2. I always say the more garlic, the more the flavor. Anyway, I cook alot and my husband loved it. I also did this on mahi-mahi and he liked it even more on this.

Very good!  We like our salmon very moist and so I only cooked it for 35 minutes, 45 would have made it to dry for our tastes.

I was excited about trying the recipe for the first time, and when cooking it smelled great.  Unfortunately, however, the salmon didn't have very much flavor to it at all.  I probably wouldn't use this recipe again.

I am not normally a salmon eater but my husband likes it, so I thought I would prepare this for him.  He gave it 3.5 stars but I bumped it up to 4 because I actually ate my whole piece quite happily and because it was SO EASY.  I didn't change a thing and it came out great.

This recipe turned out GREAT! I left out the garlic, reduced the olive oil to 5Tbs, and used 4 salmon fillets. It turned out more flavorful than I expected.

I was going to give this a four because I thought the texture was a little iffy (but otherwise tasted good), but the reaction of my husband persuaded me otherwise. He's normally a quiet, "shovel-it-down" eater, but he couldn't stop saying how great it was! I baked it for a few more minutes uncovered to make it more firm, and I may reduce the salt next time. This is definately going on my dinner rotation.

This was an excellent marinade for salmon. I actually let it marinade for a whole day (24 hours) as our dinner plans got sidetracked. It was absolutely delightful. The only change I made was I reduced the olive oil to about 4 tbsps as I thought 6 was a little much for only 2 fillets. Even my 14 yo ds thought this was great and he does not like fish.

Yum!  I'm a newlywed and this was my first time making fish.  This turned out perfect!  My husband and I loved it, and I felt like a gourmet cook!  The only thing I would mention is if you aren't a huge salt fan, leave the salt out, the second time I made it I left the salt out, and it tasted even better then the first time!

I have never liked salmon much. Boy has that changed! This is the best and easiest marinade ever, for all sorts of things! It gets even better on the grill. I use this recipe at least once a week now. Simpler is better!!

Phenomenal recipe.  I cheated by not marinating, but the flavor was still good.  My fiancee wasn't a salmon fan, but he is now!  Will make again.

This was really great!  I usually broil my salmon with soy sauce and maple syrup (super, which is why I didn't rate thie recipe "the best") but this one is right up there.  i didn't have fresh parsley, so sprinkled some dried cilanto, still great.

Another 5 star review!  430 of us can't be wrong!  What a heart healthy yet delicious salmon dish.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was so moist and flavorful.  Side dish of baby peas and dinner was served!

LOVE THIS! Easy and oh so tasty, I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! Anyone who doesn't like this recipe did something wrong when they prepared it. I have made this dozens of times, and loved it every time. I have also passed it on to many people and gotten BIG thank-you's the next day! Great served with a big salad, veggies on the side, or simply with garlic bread. I will make this recipe over and over again, and I will continue to pass it on to my friends!

This is ABSOLUTELY amazing!  I love salmon, and the way this is made is super easy and super delicious.  I used lime juice instead of lemon, but only because I didn't have any lemon at the time.  What's nice is that I already had everything in my kitchen...except for the lemon juice of course.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you very much!

I'd never made salmon before and this recipe sounded easy and good, so I tried it.  It was great!  I cooked the salmon in a pan instead of baking so it would be faster.  I think I will marinade it longer next time for more flavor.  Great recipe!

This was great, Resturant quality!! I used half of the basil called for. I am not a big basil fan. I made this twice- once on the grill, once in the foil as suggested in the recipe. I am a griller by nature & I have to say go with the foil instead.

This is the best salmon recipe I've come across so far. The only change I made was marinating the fillets for two hours. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. My husband loved it and is actually looking forward to having salmon again! Thanks for a great recipe Norma!

This is one of the best recipe I've tried in seafood/fish category. But instead of dried, I use a tablespoon of fresh chopped basil and it works excellent.

Loved it!!  I ended up having to print out a couple of extra recipies for friends who tried it.  I too added less of the oil (only 1/2 the amount).  I tried it with salmon steaks instead and put it in a covered foil dish on the BBQ.  Turned out juicy and cooked fast.  Best recipe (and I've tried a lot)

We love this.  But we marinate it and then cook it on the grill -- 3 minutes per side.  We like our fish slightly crunchy on the outside.

I used a flash frozen salmon fillet for this recipe. It turned out very flavorful and didn't make it as obvious that it had been frozen (usually I can tell a big difference).

Wow!  This is definitely a five star recipe.  I used fresh cilantro instead of parsley and it was great.  I like spicy so I added a cerrano pepper.

This is delicious! I will, however, cut back on the salt a bit the next time I make it because I think it tends to overpower the other spices a bit. Good job!

This is by far the best salmon recipe I have tried in a while. The fish was moist and tender, just excellent. I did, however, lighten up on the oi, used 3tbsp. and cut the salt a bit. This will be a staple in my recipe file. Thanks Connie

What an easy recipe and it tastes so good.  My daughter loves salmon and this is her favorite.  It always works, always tender, always juicy and flavorful.  I do however, cut the amount of oil in half and up the amount of lemon juice, just to save on the calories.   Thanks!

This recipe was quik and real easy to make.  I marinated it all day instead of just an hour and the meat soaked up more of the flavors. Will make this again.  Family loved it.

This was delicous! My first time making salmon, and it was really easy! The only thing I changed was that I didn't have basil on hand, but it still turned out great. I'll defenitly make it again

Very nice, and simple to prepare.  It works well with tuna, which is what I had.  I used dried parsley and a little more lemon juice, but it came out too oily for me.  I will be trying this with equal parts of oil and lemon juice, probably 4T each.  The recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wow, the others were right! I made this dish for family members that are on Atkins and for some that aren't. Everyone liked the flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change anything. I served mine on a big platter surrounded by brown rice. It was super easy and I will be using it again, maybe with chicken!  Thanks, Norma!

From a non-fish eater, this recipe is fantastic.  Very easy and delicious.  As I'm trying to eat more fish, I decided to try this - what a great find!  I have made this a dozen times and my family loves it too!

My boyfriend has eaten salmon from all the best restaurants in Chicago, and he says THIS is the best!! I don't use parsley at all, but sprinkle some dill on after cooking. Also, I never bake it for longer than 40 minutes or it gets dry. THANK YOU for this recipe!!

Fabulous recipe, takes a lot of abuse and still comes out great.  I've made it a few times and now mix the marinade ingredients in the bottom of a glass baking dish (I also prefer to add a T of melted butter) and add the fish flesh down for about 30 minutes and then bake with tin foil over the baking dish. So easy and delicious.

Wonderful recipe! I have never been able to cook an edible piece of fish, but this turned out perfect -- moist, flaky, and delicious! My boyfriend, who's used to his mother's fine cooking, even asked me to make it again. I marinated each fillet in a ziplock baggie, massaging them every 15 minutes. I served it over steamed rice with onions and red bell peppers sauteed in olive oil, salt, pepper, and crushed red peppers over medium heat for 15-20 minutes. And I used a garlic-flavored extra virgin olive oil for the fish and the veggies because we've always liked garlic. This is definately becoming a staple recipe for me!

I thought this recipe was wonderful.  My husband liked it just as much as myself.  My kids however didn't like it quite as much.  I think next time, though, I will probably not use as much olive oil as needed.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe for salmon.  Easy and very flavorful.  I halved the recipe and instead of foil I baked it in parchment paper.  I will definitely make this again.

Great salmon!  I love the lemon taste so one time i added more lemon juice- be cautious in doing this cause it dries out the fish.  Now I use lemon pepper instead of regular pepper and that does the trick.  I also use frsh basil when I have it on hand rather than dried.  Great recipe!!!!!

I loved the herb combination, but my husband and I agreed olive oil just isn't the best choice.  I will probably make this again, but I will use a different oil.

We really enjoyed this salmon although we increased the recipe by one third because we used two 8 ounce fillets.  The only other change we made was to leave the skin on (we had our fish monger remove the scales obviously).  We will definitely make this again as the fish was VERY moist and tender - very nice, mildly flavoured marinade.

Really was just perfect.  Easily reduce the amount of oil, and I think I added a few extra spices for kicks.  But it was just wonderful and looked very fancy.  Thank you.

I thought this was great - even my husband, who isn't big on eating fish, thought it was excellent. I didn't have fresh parsley, so substituted it with 1 tsp of dried parsley. I also grilled it instead of baking it (so it was done in about 10 minutes)... I served it with an onion rice pilaf which complimented the salmon well.

A great way to prepare salmon!  I added more garlic because my husband and I love it.  I also added a little bit of dry white wine.  This would be a great "company" dinner without too much effort.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOWZA!!! delicious. i've been bypassing this recipe for a long time cuz it looked so 'blah' to me. i was wrong!! maybe using fresh basil AND fresh parsley did the trick? regardless, i haved the olive oil as suggested by most, and doubled the garlic. i also added a little bit more lemon juice. the salmon proved sinful. it was absolutely delicious. definite keeper!!! yummy! thanks os much.

This was simple and so delicious.  Plus, my house did not smell of fish at all. I made the marinade earlier in the day and that made prep time faster.
A real keeper in my files

I'm laying out 4 stars for this one!  This is my standard salmon treatment now, both in the oven and on the grill (LOVED it bbq'd).  I can't mess this puppy up!  I usually use 3 individual size frozen filets, and marinate in a ziploc bag.  The only thing I do differently is no parsley... because I never have any.  I could see reducing the oil a bit, but it's not a dealbreaker for me.  Easily meets my three favourite criteria- tasty: check.  Easy: check.  Family likes: check!  This is a regular.

I used tilapia instead of salmon and it turned out wonderfully!  Some of the best fish I have ever tasted!  I did cut the oil to 3 T and probably will cut the salt in half next time.  But this was a very good dish!

LOVED this recipe!  Made it last night for my husband and I and couldn't believe how good it was.  Mixed it on my lunch hour and marinated for 4 hours or so, then cooked on the grill.  We both loved it!  Highly recommend this recipe just as is....

The taste was great! You have to decide your cooking time based on the thickness of your salmon. It was easy and a great combination of normally basic ingredients. A keeper!

I always dry salmon by cooking it too much but this recipe has always been moist and I can't cook it enough.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is such a great recipe! I've tried other recipes involving ingredients like bread crumbs, dijon, and nuts. Turns out this recipe is better and makes the fish a lot more moist than other recipes! Will definitely cut back on the oil!!!Way too much oil!!!

Yummy!  I was very impressed at how good this salmon turned out.  I usually bake it with a lot of butter, but this recipe was just as good and a lot healthier.  I baked it for only 25 minutes and it was already done.  If you bake it for any more it will be way overcooked.  The only change that I made was that I used half of the recommended oil and that was more than enough.  Thanks!

This recipes is easy and quick clean up for a bonus. Very tasty, used 1/2 the oil and cooked for 35 min.could have cooked about 10 min. less. Will make often.

if i was just rating how easy this was to make I'd give it 5, but I didn't love the flavor, too much of something (not sure yet what) and just not balanced in flavors.. my boyfriend loved it though, but he isn't realy picky.

Definitely cut back on the olive oil! It was a bit oily but still very good. I added some thin sliced onions before baking in the foil.

very tasty, also very easy. initially i was surprised at the amount of the ingredients, but the salmon soaks up a lot of it during cooking. however, i wonder if 1 full tsp of salt for 2 people is healthy... i don't mind every now and then. besides, all that olive oil probably counteracts the bad salt effects on your body.

tasty!

This was just OK in my book. Perhaps I didn't marinate it long enough as I was pressed for time, but the flavor just wasn't that strong. Even with the extra garlic I added it still seemed bland. Also, it asks for WAY too much oil, I reduced the amount like others have suggested and it was still swimming in a big pool of oil. Yuck! My teenager liked it, the rest of us weren't impressed. Doubt I'll make it again.

Wow. This recipe surpassed my expectations! My husband and I thought it was superb and I think the kids were surprised that they were going for seconds. Even my 10 year old daughter who balked when she saw me buy the fish in the store and complained all day that we were going to have that "nasty fish", had seconds! The marinade was excellent and I wouldn't change a thing. It is so exciting to find a healthy recipe that the whole family loves!

This was very good, and so easy to make.  This is the first time I have ever cooked salmon.  My husband loved it, and I discovered that salmon is probably an acquired taste.  I am giving it 5 stars because I think I was just picky.  Husband loved it and ate two large pieces, and my 4 year old son liked it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it seemed a little on the salty side to me.  Next time I will cut down on the oil and salt.  But my husband - who doesn't really care for salmon - cleaned his plate.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I have been looking for something like this. and I know by reading the ratings on this that it will be great.I too think that a combo of butter and oil will be better. and how about a slice of lemon and a sprig of rosemary on top. Thanks to all.....   FRANKL

I thought this was very good, and I would definitely prepare it for myself again.  Unfortunately, my husband didn't share my evaluation.  He thought the spices masked the flavor of the salmon (which is what I liked about it!).  Guess I'll be preparing this only when my husband is out of town, but thanks, Norma, for a really simple, tasty recipe.

This was heavenly. Due to a change in our plans, it marinated for two days. I served it with couscous mixed with roasted vegetables. Top of the favourite list for us. (It helps that we live in Sweden and can get great salmon too!)

I also cut the olive oil in half and it was fine.

This was absolutely delish!!!! I've made it twice this week, this week alone. I used a bit of extra lemon juice, reduced the olive oil by 2 TBSP, and added a pinch of dill, as suggested by other users. It went wonderfully with a baked potato and some steamed asparagus. Will definitely make again!

I have always been sceptical about baking fish but this recipe proved me wrong. It is so easy and better than fish I've ordered in a restaurant!  Try it! You can't go wrong!

I made this for dinner tonight and it couldn't have been easier.  There was quite a bit of oil leftover after cooking, but it didn't affect the wonderful, fresh and clean taste of the salmon.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is easy and delicious! I was concerned that it would be too much garlic, but the end result was just right. Served on a bed of tomato & basil rice, with a slice of lemon for garnish and a side green salad, it was the perfect thing to serve my guests. Next time it will be great for just me and my roommates, too!

What a terrific alternative to the lemon and butter recipe I always use!  The kids actually sort of liked it.  I didn't have fresh parsley or basil so I chopped up some coriander.  Awesome!

This is the best salmon recipe I've ever tried. I didn't have time to marinade, so I just brushed it on the salmon and grilled it. It was fabulous.
Thank you!

I used a Lake Trout in lieu of salmon and it was fantastic. I plan to use this for Rainbow Trout in the summer only I will wrap the trout in aluminum foil and cook it on the grill. Very good Thanks...Ron L.

I am 21 and this was my first fish recipie to make and it turned out wonderful.  I made it for my family of 7 by doubling the ingredence and served it with Uncle Ben's seasoned brown rice and asparagus.  While expensive and a lot of work, eveyone whent back for more and they are still talking about it!

This is wonderful!  It's tasty, moist (without being so oily), and attractive.  A GREAT "company's-coming-over" dish!  Oh.. it's so EASY too!

I LOVE this recipe. To keep from throwing out the rest of the lemon I just squeeze a whole small lemon in there (about 3 tablespoons). Last time I added some capers which was also good.

We are on low-sodium diets so I left out the salt.
Was still delicious. This has become one of my most common ways to fix salmon. The recipe with the pecan crunch coating is also wonderful.

Wonderful. My husband loved it. He was getting sick of sweet salmon. He loved the taste. I added extra spices as per previous ratings. I don't normally like fish, but I loved this. Will make again.

Excellent recipe!  My family and I loved it.  It's the best I have ever had.  I have tried salmon at local restaurants (ie: Joe's Crab Shack) but none of them compare to the delicious, zesty taste of this recipe.  WIll surely make it again.

I had a go at making this last night, purely based on the great reviews this recipe has received and I wasn't disappointed!  Absolutely delicious.  Even my boyfriend loved this one - and he's not keen on ANY type of fish.  

Having never cooked salmon before I wasn't sure what to expect but I shall definitely be making this one again.  Thank you.

This was my first attempt at cooking salmon - either in the oven, or on the barbeque. It turned out absolutely perfect and was delicious. My husband and I will definitely be trying this recipe again.  Great also for company.

Now this was a hit!  Everyone loved the lemon/basil/parsley combo.  I needed less calories, so I used  half the olive oil, but I did spray the fish with "Olive Oil" Pam just before marinating.  Not the best "trick" in the world, but it worked out just great.  Thanks for submitting this one.

We all loved this one!  I was in a hurry and didn't have time to let it marinade for an hour.  I just threw it all together and baked it without the foil.  We served it over noodles with the extra juices.  It was great!

My husband and I are huge salmon fans and we loved this recipe.  Very easy.  I even marinated it longer than the recipe said (had toleave the house), for about 4 hours actually, and it was still great.  Thank you for a great dinner!

Wonderful and moist.  30 minutes was plenty of time for my 1 lb. filet.  I may try less oil next time to lower fat content.

I'm so used to making my salmon plain cause that's how my husband likes it--plain with lots of lemon juice, but this was GREAT!  I wasnt sure at first when I tasted a dabbed of the marinade since it seemed too plain, but continued on with the instructions and the results were D-LICIOUS!  I couldnt believe how tasty it was!  My husband said it was ok, but he's used to it plain.  Only thing I'd change is adding more of the lemon juice it asked for, but otherwise, everything was wonderful!  I'll definately be making this one again!  Thanks, Norma!  I'm a beginner and have wasted LOTS of food on many bad dishes, but FINALLY I found a keeper!  :)

A local store had salmon fillets on sale last week and so I needed a simple way to prepare it. This recipe was SO easy and the end result was a hit with my family! Even the picky one loved it! I used extra lemon juice just because i love the flavor on fish and it was outstanding! Thanks!

I tried this recipe for my husband and myself because we like salmon but never know how to prepare it.  This is easy and delicious. I will certainly make this again. Thank you

This is to die for! It is always a special treat for my boyfriend. It calls for candle light, wine, and bringing the special napkins out...squeeze lots of garlic on top to have little in every bite!

I only gave it an overall 4 star because the instructions on the recommended cooking time didn't appear "good enough" for me.

Firstly being a beginner, I don't really know how to tell if salmon is cooked or not. So I followed the instructions by the book and I didn't quite like the colour of it. Nevertheless I ate half of it cause I was starving. 

After dinner, I put it back in the oven for an additional 30 mins and then it came out in the colour I recognise cooked salmon to look like! !

I looked for a baked salmon recipe the other day and found this one... I tried it that same night... It was fabulous... I've grilled the Salmon before but wanted to try a different way... This was it! I loved it and plan to make it again and again... Thanks for the recipe!

I had this the other night and it was very good.  I used 2 salmon steaks instead of filets, and I added some mushrooms and garlic.  It was VERY GOOD.  I would recommend it to anyone!
