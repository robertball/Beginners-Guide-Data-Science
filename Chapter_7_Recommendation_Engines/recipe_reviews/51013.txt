This recipe, as written, serves at least 8, not 4.  No wonder the nutritional info was sky-high for calories, fat and carbs.  Baked oatmeal is a favorite breakfast or mid-day snack for everyone in my family.  My changes: 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar (1 cup of sugar is way too much), 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup applesauce, 3/4 cup raisins, add 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 cup oat bran and 1/2 cup chopped pecans. I only bake it for 25-30 minutes at 350.  Just right.  Not dry.  Baked oatmeal is great as a "breakfast-on-the-go" for anyone who doesn't have time to sit down and eat breakfast before going to school or work. A square of it can be eaten cold or nuked in the microwave to warm it up a bit and then, you're out the door.   I like to cut a piece in half and have it with a cup of coffee or tea around 3 PM. So Good!!!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes!  I had something similar when I went to the PA Amish country and changed up this recipe a bit to be more like that one.

I use 3 tsp cinnamon instead of 2 tsp.  I also use fresh or frozen blueberries (whatever is on hand) and put 1/2 cup on the bottom of my pan and 1/3 - 1/2 cup mixed in with the batter.  This helps it be more moist and tastes so good!  We also like this served warm with some milk poured over it.

Overall, a great recipe and is wonderful for when you have guests over.  I have also made these into muffins by adding 3/4 - 1 cup of flour to the batter.  Enjoy!  We sure do!

I just moved to Pennsylvania (Lancaster County, Amish area) and this recipe is an old old favorite of my husbands family.  The card reads by Marge Weaver, 1946.  lol  Cool huh?  Only thing is, it calls for 2 tsp of Baking Soda, not powder.  Sometimes instead of cranberries we do raisins and nuts, or during the summer, dried strawberries, dried pineapple or even dried papaya chunks.  Layed out in a 13x9 pan, it is done a little crispier and used with milk as cereal, or in a couple small 3x8 pans, as a deep dish goodness.  Really wonderful stuff.

We enjoyed this.  However, I had to cut the sugar way back to 1/3 c.  When I saw that it called for a full cup of sugar I almost gagged -- it would be so overwhelmingly sweet (more of a dessert like another reviewer said) with that much.  You'd be eating 1/4 c. sugar for breakfast!  (It actually made more like 6 servings, but even at that, it would still be almost 3 tablespoons of sugar per serving)

Anyway, with the lower sugar it was a nice alternative to everyday oatmeal.  It baked up nicely and we've been snacking on the leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the first time I made baked oatmeal. I had it for a group of ladies I had over for a Prayer Connection and everyone said they really enjoyed it. Then 2 days later I had my Sister-In-Law (a long time fan of baked oatmeal) and a friend over for some leftovers. My Sister-In-Law said it was the best baked oatmeal she ever had. 
It was nice and sweet with the brown sugar, and the cranberries just made it a little tart also. I will definitely make it again.
It froze well and I just thawed it out and popped it in the microwave.

All 6 of my children LOVED this recipe.  It turned out like a soft granola bar.  I tried some of the suggestions in the other reviews.  We used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the cup.  We used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the butter.  We substituted soy milk for the milk.  We added golden raisins instead of cranberries.  So, basically it is a very versatile recipe.

Good stuff!  This is NOT oatmeal squares, as you can gather from other reviews - so don't make it if you want squares to cut out and serve.  It is a crumbly cereal for breakfast, like a heartier version of stove-top oatmeal.  I ate some plain and some with milk.  Used sultana raisins instead of cranberries only because no cranberries around house, but you could use any dry fruit or chocolate chips, anything that doesn't absorb water which you'd put in oatmeal.  Easy and tasty.  Just plan for the baking time.  No extra sugar needed to serve, it's plenty sweet.

Made this exactly as written!  Turned out sweet, great for kids. Filled them up almost all day.  Truly a stick-to-your-ribs, hearty, comfort recipe.  TIP:  Pre-measure and prep all the dry ingredients into gallon zip bags. Then in the morning, add wet ingredients and zip bag closed.  Knead, mush and mix directly in zip bag.  Snip bottom corner of bag and squeeze directly into baking dish.  Drop the zip bag into the trash.  Prep time is 1 minute!  Customize it to you heart's content! Thank you for the great base recipe BLANCHL!

I changed the recipe a bit and LOVE it. To cut calories I substituted a half cup of Splenda for half the brown sugar. To cut the cholesterol I used one whole egg and an egg white instead of two eggs. Also, I can't afford cranberries, so I substituted apples and raisins, which I had on hand. It's fabulous!!

I make this frequently.   We love it.  I vary the recipe each time slightly.   Instead of cramberries, I have put in cherries, blueberries, chopped apples, drained canned peaches or fresh when in season.  I also use olive oil or canola oil, eliminate the butter and add applesauce, and  decrease the sugar by 1/2  to make it healthier.

I've looked, for awhile now, for a form of oatmeal my husband will eat without grimacing.  He hates oatmeal.  Not the taste, but the texture after it's cooked (as a cereal of course).  This has beyond won his favour.  He loves it! Furthermore my children love it, my father, who is a standard oatmeal fan, loved the change, and I too am a fan. I make mine with Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, Soymilk, and canola oil, and I find it turns out the same as when you use the ingredients called for. I also, personally, like to add 1 heaping cup of blueberries (usually frozen in this house, unless we're in season), instead of the cranberries.  Works very well.
I also have to recommend adding 1 cup of pumpkin puree, instead of the 1/2 cup of butter.  Leave the butter out, and the 1 cup of puree gives it a very pumpkin pie like taste.  Not exact, but similar.  Add half a tsp of ground cloves, all spice, ginger, and nutmeg, and it smells like a pumpkin pie.  It's very moist, incredibly cake like, and a good option for the fall months.

I've now made this recipe twice - the first time I followed the instructions exactly. It came out fairly loose, like granola but soft. It was delicious but a little difficult to eat. I was looking for something my husband could take to work in the morning on the run. So, I made the recipe again with the following changes: I used quick oats (rather than old fashioned rolled oats) and replaced the butter with applesauce. PERFECT! About the consistency of a soft cookie - very easy to cut into bars and pack for breakfasts! Also, cutting the butter made each bar 100+ calories lighter and eliminated 10 grams of fat from each. Oh, and the recipe serves 8-10...not 4.

I have tried different baked oatmeal recipes and my family and I really enjoyed this one.  I used blueberries like another review suggested.  Also I used vanilla soy milk anddid not add extract.  Also yummy with vanilla creamer bolthouse farms chai on top.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made a few changes to make this recipe Weight Watcher's friendly . . . First, I only made 1/2 recipe (4 servings).  I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup, used skim milk, and substituted apple sauce for the butter.  Even with these changes, it was delicious!  Weight Watchers Points Plus = 6 per serving.  Not bad!

I have tried every enhancement I could think of to make my daily bowl of oatmeal more palatable, but I had wearied of it and cut it out of my breakfast regimen.  I know it's supposed to be nutritious, so when I came upon this recipe, I was determined to give it a try so I could continue to get my healthy "dose" of oatmeal, but in a different form.  I loved that it was so easy to prepare. I incorporated several of the suggestions of other reviewers, so I'm rating this recipe based on those changes.  I'm sure the original recipe would be even more delicious, and I may try it exactly as written when I'm in the mood for something more "decadent."  I chose to use applesauce instead of butter to keep the fat content down.   I used real maple syrup in place of brown sugar because I had maple syrup that I wanted to use up.  I added blueberries (I didn't have cranberries),  chopped walnuts and raisins, and sprinkled coconut over the top.  I was delighted with the results: moist, but firm, so that I could cut it into squares -- sort of like the texture of bread pudding, which I love.  I preferred this cold with a glass of milk.  I would like to thank all the reviewers who offered their great suggestions.  This is definitely a keeper for me.

This is a good basic recipe.  Lots of changes can be made to suit your tastes.  I like the texture of this, we scoop it into bowls and pour milk over it.  I add some milled flax seed for the nutrional value and it gives it a slightly nutty flavor.  It's also great with chopped apples and raisins.  I also put this in the crockpot on low for 3 hours during one of my kid's snow days last week, they got to go sled while breakfast was cooking and it turned out great, a little more moist than in the oven.

Fantastic recipe! My husband loves this! I added diced apple to the recipe in place of the cranberries and it was amazing - almost dessert-like.  Definitely a keeper.

This was really good.  After reading others' reviews, I reduced the brown sugar and used applesauce in place of half the butter.  I halved the recipe and baked it for 30 minutes in an 8x8 baking dish.  I was glad that I greased the pan; I think it would have stuck pretty badly otherwise.  I poured a little milk and sprinkled a few walnuts over the top to serve.  A very nice change from my usual morning oatmeal.  I'll be making this again.

Yummy! We made this 2 times in 3 days. I did sub apples for cranberries. Perfect!***UPDATE**** I make this the night before and throw it in the fridge then in the morning while the oven is heating up I take it out of the fridge to let the temp come up a bit then bake. I usually need to add 5-10 extra minutes but its a lifesaver on those cold early school mornings :)

I guess I didn't read enough of the reviews to discover that this recipe makes more of a soft granola instead of the moist baked oatmeal that you can cut like a lasagna.  It was okay, but not great.  A little bit over spiced with cinnamon we thought and just not a great texture.  Even after pouring milk over it in our bowls and re-heating, it still was too soft to be crunchy, yet also too firm to be soft...if that makes any sense.  LOL.  We will keep searching.  Not horrible, just not what our family is looking for I guess.

I like this a lot.  My husband did to - and he's not  fan of oatmeal.  It's more cake-like (but not quite bars).  Made for way less of a mess with my two-year-old's "meat-mo" too.  I also cut the sugar back to just shy of 1/2 a cup, and I baked in a 9x9 rather than 9x13.  I had a bunch of raisins leftfover from something else so I used those instead of craisins.  SO EASY!  I will definitely try it next with blueberries.  Hubby picked the pan clean.

UPDATED: I made it as written for after-Christmas breakfast (but still in a 9x9).  It was DIVINE.  It is totally worth making at least once with the full sugar and butter if you can.  On a regular basis we will still reduce the sugar a bit, but for company and holidays, OH MY!  EIGHT...  no, TEN STARS!

Can i give this 6 stars? Excellent breakfast! My teen son has never been enthusiastic about oatmeal, but this recipe won him over. We've tried it as written, with no fruit, with blueberries, strawberries, and apples & walniuts. Usually I substitute applesauce for the butter to eliminate the fat and reduce cost. The blueberry version (fresh & frozen both work great) has emerged as our favorite.

This was wonderful on a rainy day!  I found this recipe...loved the idea...but being on Weight Watchers I had to make some minor changes...fat free milk...egg whites...1/4 cup oil (I used coconut oil)...ended up with a warm happy belly...and my son couldn't stop eating it.  Thank you for this!!!

Just tried this for the first time - it came out great! Halved the brown sugar as others suggested. Used a few raisins, not cranberries. I think apple chunks would be even better! Used a 9x13 pan, but baked for only 30 minutes. Came out soft and moist and delicious, nice light balance of flavors.

This is my go-to baked oatmeal recipe! I make just a few changes: cut sugar in half, substitute applesauce for the melted butter, and add 1/4 cup flaxseed and/or wheat germ. I've never used dried cranberries (I'm thinking this means craisins?) because I don't think I'd like the texture. So we use blueberries (just throw a handful of frozen ones in from the freezer!) or chopped apples (I sautee them in a bit of butter and cinnamon for about 10 minutes to soften while I mix together the other ingredients).

I love this recipe! What I did that I think makes it even better is add about 1 cup of chopped pecans and two medium granny smith apples (cored, peeled, and coarsely chopped) to it. It gives the oatmeal and incredible flavor and texture.

This is really good. I use 4 cups of oats. 2 cups Multi grain oats from Trader Joes and 2 cups old fashion oats. I like the texture it gives.I also use apple sauce instead of butter, only a sprinkle of brown sugar. 

I have made this about 5 times in the past 2 months. Once with peaches and all the other times by grating 3 apples and chopping 3 apples with skins on. I add 1 additional liquid egg white to make it so you can easily cut in squares.

My family of 6 eats in a day. LOVE this!!! Husband loved the peach version, but 4, 6, and 2 yr old liked the apple version only. I can now assemble this in less than 10 min!

I bake it the night before and we scoop in bowls in the am. I like mine warmed up in a bowl with almond milk and additional cinnamon . ENJOY!

Delicious!  I had never heard of baked oatmeal before and I will definitely start making it a lot now! Listen to the MANY review suggestions!  1/3 cup of brown sugar is really all you need.  I also did 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of mashed bananas.  I shook a little nutmeg in there and a little extra cinnamon.  Dried cranberries, raisins and walnuts...anything you like, really. YUM!

Just made this and wanted to rate it as being wonderful.  I have never made baked oatmeal before, heck never even heard of it.  Found the recipe by accident.  So glad I did!  I made it exactly as written except for omitting the cranberries and cutting the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  It's hard to describe the texture.  At first I thought it was going to be sorta like a cake as I cut through it.  But it crumbled apart as I plated it.  It is sorta like a warm moist granola.  Think stuffing/dressing texture.  The top was just very slightly crisp around the edges.  I baked mine in my small PC deep dish baker, sorta close to an 8x8 sized dish, for 30 minutes.  I topped our servings with a pat of butter and 1 tsp. of pure maple syrup.  My picky 6-yr-old LOVED it.  Can't wait to see how the leftovers are!  This is worth trying out!!!

This is the best breakfast to have on hand when you're in a hurry.  Make it the night before and you have instant food when you're crunched for time.  I like it straight from the oven.  Scoop some in a bowl and splash on some milk...a great tasting, hot breakfast that sticks with you for hours.  My daughter eats this stuff plain.  However you choose to eat it...it's good!  We make this every week.

Thought we'd try something different with our oatmeal and discovered this wonderful recipe. Halved the recipe (it's just the 2 of us) and baked in an 8x8 dish. I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 applesauce and it worked out just fine. Might use all applesauce next time to make it a little less fat. Loved the flavors, loved the texture, loved the quick prep, will be making this again. We both poured milk over the top and enjoyed this new breakfast treat. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I just made this and it turned out very good.  I love oatmeal anyway, and eat it practically everyday.  It was fun to try a different way of making it.  I first had it at a brunch at church.  This recipe was way better. At first I made it exactly as written, only omitting the salt bc I used salted butter.  It just didn't look like quite enough in the 9x13 pan (we are a family of 6).  So I decided to half the recipe again.  That was perfect.  I also added probably an extra 3/4 cup milk (to hopefully avoid it being too dry).  I still baked it for 40 minutes.  It was  just the right amount of time.  Oh yes, by the way, I greased the bottom and sides of the baking dish with the stick of butter before melting it.  I served it hot drizzled with a couple tablespoons of half and half.  That little bit of half and half made a really good dish great.  My 6 yr old asked if i could "make it lots of times".   Also I didn't have cranberries so I didn't put them in.  Can't wait to try it though.  I will definately make this again.

I have never had anything like this before in my life.  I am not even an oatmeal fan.  However, I was looking for something to add into the morning breakfast rotation for the kids.  This is amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It comes out somewhat like the consistency of a soft, moist granola.  You could eat it plain, with a spoon.  But, I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and spooned it into a bowl and stirred in a little milk with it.  It was really great!  I'm going to store it in the fridge and in the morning try to microwave individual servings with a little milk and see how it turns out.  A whole recipe will last us several days if it works like I hope. Try this, you will not be disappointed!

I have been making this for breakfast for several years and is one our favourite breakfasts.  It is not meant to be a square.  When you scoop it out of the pan it should crumble and you eat it with milk just like regular oatmeal.  You can add fresh fruit on top if you wish.  It doesn't need anything else.  The only difference in my recipe is that mine has 3-1/4 cups oatmeal and I keep the 1 cup sugar but make it half white and half brown.  It is not too sweet.  Don't forget that a 9x13 pan will make several bowls of oatmeal. Place leftovers in the fridge and microwave the next day.  Makes a great school day breakfast.

Just made this for the first time this evening. Followed the recipe exactly, but only baked for 30 min per other reviewers to keep it a bit moister. It crumbled a bit anyway, but no matter, it was yummy. My DH and I loved it...can definitely see how we can customize it like crazy (and are looking forward to that!).  I recommend spraying the 9x13 pan with Pam though...it does stick a bit.
***UPDATE*** I have now made this at least 4 times for my DH who absolutely loves this. It is his new standard breakfast.  Spraying the pan with Pam did not help...it still stuck. Today I used Baker's Joy spray (like Pam but with flour in it) and YAY...that did the trick! No more sticking. Today I made it with Brown sugar Splenda (1/2 cup), walnuts and dotted canned apple pie filling on the top. That was a GREAT addition...YUM! This will be a staple in our house! Thanks for posting this recipe!

My family and I love this recipe! I like to add froz blueberries and use almond milk since my 4yo can't have dairy. Also, I use 1 med. banana in place of the eggs. YUM! I've tried it w/o these alterations and it's delicious as well.

I've never had or made baked oatmeal so I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe.  I was pleasantly surprised!  This was like a soft granola bar or almost a chunky muffin.  I took other reviewers advice and cut the sugar in half (I actually used Sucanat).  I also used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of butter and egg beaters instead of eggs.  I added a little ginger and some slivered almonds and it was delicious.  Brought it to work for a breakfast treat and everyone enjoyed it.  It wasn't devoured but we picked at it happily all day.  I would definitely make this again!

Used pure maple syrup instead of brown sugar.  Soaked the oats in the eggs, maple syrup and milk overnight.  Added the rest in the morning and baked at 350 for 25 min.

I had never eaten baked oatmeal before, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this was really good. Some of my daughters have told me they eat this when they sleep over at their friends' house, so I thought I'd give it a try. I did 1 and 1/2 times the recipe, which was enough to serve 7 children and myself with a little left over. I pretty much followed the recipe, except I subbed 1/4 cup canola oil spread for 1/4 cup of the butter and added a pinch of nutmeg and a dash of cloves. I also used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 and 1/2 cups and added several drops of stevia. The texture is kind of like a soft crumbly cake, but not dry at all. I had mine with milk. A very filling breakfast. Try it!

I'm from Lancaster, Pennsylvania and this is a very popular PA dutch dish... one thing that's pretty important is to use the "Quick cooking" oats to give it the right consistency and "hold". Try adding diced apples instead of the raisins. Delicious!

I make this at least once a week for our family.  What I love MOST about it is that the recipe is forgiving enough for lots of variation.  Sometimes I sub applesauce for the oil.  Sometimes I sub a couple bananas for 2/3 of the milk.  Sometimes I sub pumpkin puree for most of the milk, and add some pumpkin pie spice.  Once, I had ground up too many gingersnaps for the crust of a pumpkin cheesecake, and threw the excess gingersnap crumbs in.  Delicious!  You can even add peanut butter (and bananas?...or chocolate chips?) to the recipe.  To add more healthy goodness, try adding some ground flax seed or wheat germ.  It's yummy enough that the kids would never guess!  Great recipe on its own, and fun to experiment with, too!

Excellent! I made some changes and would adjust next time, but only slightly.  I only used 1/2 c. craisins and did 1/2 c. frozen blueberries and cut up a large peeled apple. I used 3 tsp. of cinnamon. I would reduce the Splenda BS to 3/4 of a cup and I will try half butter half apple sauce next time.  The consistency was perfect using an 8x8 pan - cooking time was right on too.  I think baking it in a 9x13 would result in a very dried out result.

I made this for my family and we all loved it! This is a keeper. I tweaked the recipe just a bit to fit our whole foods lifestyle: to cut down the sugar, I substituted 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup maple syrup for the brown sugar. I used about 1 cup of dried fruits (cranberries, raisins, and chopped dates). Sometimes I substitute 1/4 cup melted coconut oil for half the butter and add some unsweetened coconut flakes. It tastes just like an oatmeal cookie and is very filling with plenty of leftovers for the next morning!

I made a few tweaks... used 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt & 1/4 cup milk, added fresh blueberries instead of the dried cranberries & used a cinnamon/clove/nutmeg mixture.  It came out oh so perfect! Moist & fluffy! Next time I will use less sugar & more blueberries.

Very tasty! I halved the sugar after reading reviews. While it was still acceptable, it just wasn't as desirable. Next time, will start with 3/4 cup sugar and add more if necessary.

This is a family favorite- perfect for a lazy Sunday supper when you want something easy.  I leave out the cranberries and substitute chocolate chips... which makes it both supper and dessert all in one!

I did the half-the-sugar, sub-soy-milk, applesauce-for-butter version and it is AWESOME! Somehow mine is more like a bread, but ain't nothin' wrong with that, as far as I'm concerned.  And mine was finished baking in 35 min.

I am in love with this recipe! I have made it 3 times already this week.  My kids love to help make the oatmeal.  The only thing I add is more cinnamon to our liking.  We put it in a bowl and add a little milk.  So GOOD!

I did make some alterations.  Cut sugar to a little less than 1/2 cup.  Used plain soy milk.  Used applesauce in place of butter.  Instead of cranberries used frozen blueberries.  Mixed 1 c. into mixture and also scattered extra on the bottom of 9x13 pan as suggested by someone else.  Delicious and healthy!

Great, but I made quite a few changes!  I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and used 2 TB butter and 1/2 cup applesauce to cut the fat.  I also used quick cooking oats, since that is all I had on hand, and added some slivered almonds.    Lastly, I baked in an 8x8 pan since I wanted a softer consistency-  more oatmeal than cookie bar.  We loved it with a little warm milk poured over the top.  Delish!!

This recipe is awesome!  I would say this is more like 6 servings, but it's so delicious two people can finish it off in one sitting! =) I did make a few changes to make it a little lighter (taking into account said overeating)... I only used 3/4 c. brown sugar, and instead of 1/2 c. butter, I used 1/4 c. butter and 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce.  I've added a diced apple too (instead of the cranberries), and that makes it soooo good, like a cross between oatmeal and apple crisp.

Delicious!  I took this to a get together where I knew children with food allergies would be, so I subbed bananas and applesauce for the eggs and butter, and didn't have cranberries so I used raisins.  It was so good I came home with an empty dish!  Will definitely be making this again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I make this exactly as indicated, except substitute sliced apples for the cranberries because my husband prefers apples. It is VERY good and it's a Sunday morning favorite. Thanks to the review suggesting 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce- I was looking for a lower fat version and now I'm going to try it!

Very good!  I used dried blueberries.  It turned out kind of like granola (a wetter granola) so I had mine with yogurt.  Made the house smell great, and made great leftovers.  I will be making this a lot!

this is the first time making or eating baked oatmeal.  for us it was just ok.  made as written, but no cranberries and added some chopped pecans.  i made in a smaller dish to have a thicker end result.  if i ever do make again, i'm thinking about adding some fruit element as a filling.  thanks BLANCHL!

This is delicious and a very different take on oatmeal for breakfast. Actually it is more like oatmeal cake and more desserty. This reminded me of a muffin in texture. It was rather dry though and needed something like a sauce, whipped cream, or milk. I scaled this down to 2 servings and it was just right for us. It was rather sweet though and I wil probably use less sugar next time. I'm glad I discovered this wonderful new way to fix oatmeal, this stuff is so good! Thanks for sharing this keeper.

Nice change to the typical oatmeal. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and apple sauce instead of butter. Instead of cranberries I put in raisins and chopped walnuts. Served it in a bowl with milk. Will make that again. It's healthy, filling and really yummy.

This was soooo good and great for taking to work during the week....I used chocolate chips because I had no dried fruit on hand...and I cut back on the sugar a bit (I used 1/4 c. Splenda and 1/4 c. brown sugar) and applesauce instead of butter, because I am trying to cut back on calories.  This turned out great and still pretty sweet (my 2 year old son thought they were cookies).  Thanks for sharing!

To make this healthier, I used 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 egg & 1 egg white, 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c apple sauce. I also used 2 apples instead of the cranberries as it was the only fruit we had on hand. Will make again! Oh, I also made this in and 8x8 instead of a 9x13. Definitely would do that again too.

Oh how we love this recipe!  Almost every time we have overnight guests, they expect a breakfast of baked oatmeal.  We put out little bowls of chopped walnuts (toasted), raisins, brown sugar, and whipping cream (sometimes whipped, sometimes not) for them to decorate their own serving.  Warm and filling and very welcoming!

This was really good!  I followed the recipe to a tee with just 2 substitutions.  I used all natural applesauce in place of the butter and I used splenda instead of brown sugar.  It was really good.  I served it with some fat free whipped cream.  The leftovers were good cold for breakfast too.  You could easily substitute other dried fruits for the cranberries or even try fresh raspberries or blueberries.

I am not a fan of boiled oatmeal so I decided to try this recipe.  All I can say is...amazing!  I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and cut down the butter to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce as suggested by others, as well I added a 1 cup mix of raisins and dried cranberries and one chopped-up Granny Smith apple.  I also added 2 tsp. of REAL vanilla extract.  I will be making this often...real comfort food!  Thanks for sharing!

I could eat it all by myself.  All of it.  In one sitting!  This is a great "transition recipe" for my 16 month old, as long as I've chopped the nuts fine enough.  She gobbles it up.  Very versatile recipe as well since you can add nuts, chocolate chips, coconut, etc and make it as healthy or gooey as you please.

This was very strange.  I followed the recipe exactly, except halved the sugar.  It is edible, but no one really liked it.  We tried eating it plain, and also with some milk on top, and both ways were not very good.  It has an okay flavor, but the texture is very strange. Will not be making this again, that's for sure!!

YUM!  I halved this recipe, & wish I hadn't cuz we ate the whole pan in one sitting.  I didn't have any dried cranberries, so I chopped up one apple, and used raisins instead.  Totally delicious!  My hubby says "make this again!"  I most definitely will, and make a full recipe so we can eat on it for more than one breakfast.

This was my first time making baked oatmeal. Some reviews said it was like oatmeal squares and others said it was not. So I figured it would be a bit creamy, but crunchy on the edges. It is more like a soft baked cookie when it comes out of the oven. It was okay if you poured milk over it. I guess I am just more used to regular oats, made on the stove top.

Loved this! I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, and substituted apple sauce for the butter. It turned out great. I served it crumbled in a bowl with milk on it like cereal. Really good, like a cross between oatmeal and granola. You can really play around with this recipe adding different fruits, nut, or seeds to it. Yummy.

These are yummy, soft squares. I read some reviews, used 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 1/4 cup splenda, used 1/4 cup raisins, 1/4 cup dried cranberries, 1/4 cup dried mulberries. Also used 1/4 cup butter/ 1/4 cup applesauce and a small bag of slivered almonds chopped up. 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/3 tsp clove and 1/3 cup oat bran plus the other ingredients. Nice with a glass of milk.

Yum yum yum!!! I've never had baked oatmeal before. But this is just so delicious. I halved the sugar as per some of the previous reviews and as I only had about 2 1/2 cups of rolled oats left, I added 1/2 cup of flax meal crunchy bits to add some healthy omega 3 fats. Very good. My 3 year old climbed up onto the bench to help herself to some more :-)

This was very good.  I made it in hopes that my two sons (one who loves oatmeal & one who hates it) would eat something substantial for breakfast.  I called it "Breakfast Cake" to hide the main ingredient, and it was well-received.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe has an outstanding flavor.  I substitute 1/4 c. olive or coconut oil plus 1/4 c. unsweetened applesauce for all of the butter; 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. agave nectar for the 1 c. of brown sugar; and I used a 7 grain (rolled) mix instead of oats.  Awesome!

I took the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the sugar, using 1/4 brown sugar, 1/4 brown sugar splenda.  I also cut the amount of butter in half and used applesauce in place of the remainging half.  I added choc chips.  It was delicious!  Next time I will add coconut & nuts.  The variations are endless.  Great way to start the day!

I added 2 more eggs and in the end I fill the pan with extra milk until the ingredients just barely float and give it one final stir.   I cover it with plastic wrap down onto the surface and let sit in the fridge overnight. I take it out and put it in the oven when I am showering. Over baking is not an issue. Go longer rather than shorter. The baking powder should get it to full on brown to signify you are done baking it.

HIGHLY recommended with chopped/peeled fresh PEACHES!!! (For this variation I use 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. almond extract, and halve the cinnamon and vanilla.) More like breakfast bar, this is really good. Use more milk if you want it moister. You can even pour extra atop before baking, and it will soak in. I also use only 1/4 cup SUGAR (plenty!) and half the butter with can be omitted, changed to coconut oil, or substituted with applesauce. Any dried fruit is delicious. I have used a mixture of raisins and soaked dried apples (chopped). Another time I used dried cherries, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. almond extract. Nuts would be good too. I've been making this weekly!

My kids loved this - you can make it on a sunday and then warm up the rest of the week.  I added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed to increase their fiber intake.  It was a hit.  I will definatley make this again.

First off, let me say that the serving size is about right on, at least in my house. I have 5 kids, three of which are just hitting their teenage years. They eat more than a five year old would. So, I doubled the recipe for my family of 7.    Things that I changed based on other reviews:  1. I used half the amount of sugar. I agree that 1 Cup is way to much. 2. I used half the amount of butter and added in 1/4 Cup apple sauce instead. I like the taste of butter in my oatmeal, but I think this can be accomplished with a little bit instead of a lot.    I am giving this 4 stars because of the changes I had to make. It was a very good recipe, just needed a little less sweetener.

Pretty dang good!  I did make a few changes -- (okay I made a good number of changes) based on the "too dry" comments.... I only added 1/4 cup melted butter and to that I added 1 and 1/4 cup applesauce.  If I would have thought ahead I would've used apple butter instead though.  I upped the cinnamon to 1 full tsp. Then instead of the craisins (I didn't have any) I added 1 cup of raisins and one Granny Smith apple (peel off) and sliced very thinly - coarsely chopped - I actually heated the milk and poured it over the raisins and allowed it to sit for 15 minutes to plump them up a bit.... Oh and I halved the brown sugar also so I only added 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet.  I actually prepped everything the night before and poured it into ramekins so that in the morning we had individual portions of the special treat. Kids liked it and it was a healthy option for us as a family.

Wonderful!  As one reviewer mentioned, the oatmeal did not stick together like "bars."  It was a bit crumbly, so I served it in bowls and  with milk over the top... It tasted like cookies dipped in milk.  My family loved it.  They've even been telling the neighbors about how great it was!  And it made the whole house smell heavenly!

This is fantastic!  Waaay better than anything you can buy in the store.  I made a couple of tweaks as follows - used quick cooking oats, reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup, 1/2 c melted coconut oil in place of the butter, raisins in place of the cranberries and added a handful of chopped walnuts.  Can't wait to try with a dollop of greek yogurt on top for breakfast.  Will make again and again with different fruits.

This was fantastic and hit the spot on a cold winter morning.  It is 5 stars based on the modifications I made after reading tips from other reviewers.  We have relatives coming soon and it will definitely be on the breakfast menu list!  

**Serve with warm milk.**

I made the following changes: I subbed 3/4 c. frozen mixed berries for the cranberries, I reduced the brown sugar to 1/3 c., I subbed 1/2 c. applesauce for the 1/2 c. butter, I added 1 tsp. butter and I added a dash of nutmeg.

Another reviewer suggested measuring out the dry ingredients the night before into a gallon-sized ziploc, which made morning assembly a snap.

BLANCHL, thanks for the recipe!

mmmMMM, mmmMMM good! Love baked oatmeal, it's like a soft oatmeal muffin in a pan but made with all oats (no flour or fillers). I usually have this for breakfast so I cut way back on the brown sugar and use only 1/4 c. and find it sweet enough. The nice thing about this type of recipe is that it's "tweekable" to preferences. My favorite is to omit the dried cranberries and use cocoa nibs and unsweetened flaked coconut instead and I often add chopped walnuts. I also use coconut oil instead of butter. The recipe is great as written and I enjoy being able to customize it to taste and still have it turn out well. I like it thicker too and bake it in an 8x8 square pan and find 30 minutes enough time. While it's still warm I scoop out a serving and drizzle it with cream. Thanks BLANCHL for sharing this recipe.

My go-to (and to-go) breakfast recipe! I bake on a Sunday and reheat servings all week with a little milk. I halve the recipe with steel-cut oats, but still use a full cup of milk, plus some. I discovered I can cut out the sugar entirely if I sub dried fruit and fun flavors (cardamom, candied ginger, chai drink mix, applesauce or shredded coconut w/pineapple chunks).

This was a great breakfast option for hosting a group.  It was quick and easy and kept me with my visitors instead of slaving over the stove!  I cut the sugar in half (after trying it exactly like the recipe once) and I substitute half of the butter with applesauce.  I suggest cutting out the craisins when fresh berries are around to top it with upon serving, or baking frozen berries into the mix!  This is a staple in our diet.

Thanks to the original person who posted this!  And the supplementary vid!  Delicious, easy! A local market here in Lancaster, PA (LEMON ST.) has made something similar - here are some other healthy substitutes I just used: Coconut Oil instead of butter; Evaporated Cane Sugar or Sucanat (dehydrated cane sugar) to replace brown sugar; 1 cup almond milk instead of regular milk (rice milk works well too).  I even poured the mixture into muffin pans without adding anything else and they came out warm, crispy, and sweet.  Thanks!

Loved this recipe!  Easy to throw together.  After reading readers reviews, the first batch we made with apples and dried currants.  The second batch (as it was fall), I used a cup of canned pumpkin and 2-3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  So very good~  my kids don't normally eat oatmeal, however, they were eating this!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

We enjoyed this very much. It's easy to put together for a healthy, quick breakfast to have on hand throughout the week. I poured a bit of milk of warm milk over it to serve. This actually made 10 serving, possibly 12. I used half the sugar and used applesauce in lieu of butter with a nice result. Next time, I will use half the salt. Very good! Thank you!

Amazing!! Our whole family loves this!! My dad said that this is the best baked oatmeal that he has ever had, and my mom said we should make it for breakfast three times a week. With responses like that, it is definitely a keeper:) This recipe, for our tastes, is absolutely perfect as written. We especially like it warm with milk poured over it. So good!! Baked Oatmeal I from this site was our previous go-to baked oatmeal recipe, but everyone agrees that this recipe is much better. Thanks so much for sharing!!

I read other reviews and decided to make a healthier version to take on a road trip for breakfast.  It turned out beautifully!  I used 1/2 C brown sugar, 3 tsp cinnamon, and added a tsp each of nutmeg and cardamom, skim milk, egg beaters, subbed unsweetened applesauce for the butter, and 1 finely chopped apple and about 1/2 C of raisins instead of the cranberries.  Thinking of trying mango and coconut next.  LOVE this recipe!!

Love it! Made a few changes - use 1/2 C brown sugar, soy milk instead of milk and applesauce to replace the butter. I also use closer to a cup of dried cranberries, raisins & dried pomegranate - or whatever I have at the time. It is really good with the different flavors in each bite.

This recipe is fantastic!  I cut the recipe in half and added some "fresh" blackberries that I needed to use before they went bad in place of cranberries.  Might try with apples and cranberries or other fruits.  Next time I will cut back on the brown sugar because it was borderline too sweet for me.  I will also try another reviewer's suggestion by using applesauce instead of butter to make it healthier.  Very delicious and versatile recipe!

Yummy!! It came out very sweet, one cup of sugar is a lot, so next time I'm going to put in 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead. I added walnuts and a chopped apple. This is a very versatile recipe. I used Almond Milk instead of regular milk too and it came out great!

We didn't care for this.  I think a couple changes would make it better.  I would definitely make it in a smaller deeper dish.  I think in the 9x13 it was super dry and more like a granola bar.  I wanted it more mushy.  Also, I cut the sugar due to a lot of reviews, but I think that was a mistake.

Loved this recipe!  I can't stand mushy hot cereals so this was texturally perfect for me.  HOWEVER...I left out the milk.  I mixed everything just as the recipe said but left out the milk.  I added chopped pecans and didn't have cranberries so I used a chopped apple.  It was so good.  A friend at work did the same as I did but used steel cut oats and she said it was like the most delicious granola she ever had.  She brought it in a baggie the next day!  I will continue to make this.  I put the left overs in a baggie for my hubbie for work and he loved it.  With a bit of vanilla yogurt and fresh berries I will ALWAYS make this for guests paired with scrambled eggs it can't be beat!  Thanks so much for this recipe!!  PS if you add flax seed and wheat germ no one is the wiser and it's so healthy!

Fantastic! I substituted dried cranberries for frozen blueberries (defrosted in the microwave for 30 seconds), and served it with a little milk - absolutely delicious breakfast food!

Wow... never made oatmeal before besides the crappy microwave pouch stuff.  I have high cholesterol so I am trying to eat healthier and get more oats and whole grains.  This was really good!  I did make some changes from looking at other reviews - I halved the recipe since we didn't know if we would like it and it was just fiance and I, skipped the cranberries because of the added sugar and couldn't find fresh ones, kept cinnamon and vanilla at 2 tsp, cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 and the salt to 1/4 tsp since my butter was salted, and added Gala apples... delish! Hopefully it is as good reheated tomorrow morning :)

Love this recipe, we add extra milk after it is in the bowl and sometimes drizzle syrup over the top.  Another great addition we've found are sliced peaches or spiced apples, yum!!!

A nice healthy bar. I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup and that was more than enough. I also used half oil and half applesauce (1/4 cup each). I ran out of craisins so I subbed half raisins, but the craisins gave it a better tang. Thirty minutes was the perfect baking time; more would have dried it out.

I wanted a healthier breakfast, so I decided to try this.  I did cut the sugar by half (but I KNOW I would have loved it even better as is).  I used vanilla almond milk, and instead of butter I put in applesauce.  It wasn't my typical breakfast and I think I'll have to get used to oatmeal a little more, but the recipe was great and exactly what I was looking for.

What a great change from cereal in the morning.  I make it the night before and then warm it up with milk in the morning.  Great with cranberries and probably would be good with raisins too.  Saigon cinnamon (from Costco) is the best cinnamon to use!!

Very good...only used 1/2 the amount of sugar and it was still plenty sweet.  Update:  Used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was perfect.  Make the night before and only cook for 25 mins.

Loved the idea and loved the flavor.  Can't wait to make again but will lower the salt and sugar amounts.  Will also try substituting the cinnamon with pumpkins spice and vanilla with maple extract.

Really nice recipe.  Made a few changes to improve upon the taste and healthiness factor: reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup packed and substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the 1/2 cup melted butter.  I also only needed to bake this about 20 to 25 minutes.  Be sure to spray your baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.  We eliminated the cranberries.  Can also be crumbled and served with milk, or I personally enjoy a dollop of whipped cream with a sprinkling of slivered almonds.

I took hotmama's prep suggestions for the ziploc bag, gooshed the oatmeal ingredients in the bag and just snipped off the side and squeezed it into the baking dish. I only used half the amound of sugar called for, I cut back the salt to a pinch, I used fat free evaporated milk and because I'm out of dried cranberries, I used dried blueberries. I did soak the blueberries in hot juice before using. This was quite simple and the end result was loved by all of us. It's almost like a oatmeal "rice" pudding. Very decadent breakfast treat. Next time, I'll see if I can't lighten it even more. NOTE: Be sure to spray your baking pan with non-stick spray. Otherwise, you'll have to chisel the sides of the pan when you're done.

This was okay.  I still prefer regular oatmeal that is more moist than this.  If you like drier oatmeal, then this is a good recipe for that.

Didn't care for the texture of these bars.  They were very crumbly and I was looking for more of a bar that you could bite into.  You bite into these and the bar crumbles everywhere.  Also, I would not recommend cutting the sugar as other reviews suggested.  I used 1/2 cup and the bars were not sweet enough.

Tried this with a few modifications suggested in other reviews.  I used half the brown sugar, applesauce in place of melted butter and frozen blueberries in place of cranberries just because of family preferences.  Also dotted the top with a little buttery spread before baking.   Hubby and I thought it was okay but 3 of the 4 kids really loved it.  I was pleased overall because my reason for trying it was to have a quick and nutritious breakfast for the kids on school mornings.  Thanks BLANCHL.

I am not an oatmeal fan, but decided to make it, serve it today and save leftovers for the week.  Oh my gosh, how good!!!!!  I'm betting that reheating with a little extra milk will be a real breakfast treat (for someone who never eats breakfast!!).

Delicious with some frozen blueberries instead of dried fruit. Used 1/4 cup butter + 1/2 cup of apple sauce to reduce calories. I also cut the sugar in half and it was sweet enough.

Just eating this!  Wonderful.  DO heat milk or half and half with nutmeg and if you want maybe some cloves or cardamom.  It really is all each person pouring some hot milk and nutmeg over the oatmeal that makes it.  Not sweet enough?  provide a little brown sugar or honey on the side, but try it with the hot milk first :)    If you are halving the recipe as I did, I would recommend using a large loaf pan or round cake pan.  Mine, I spread too thin and some of my goji berries and raisins burned- had to pick them out.

I've made this many times as written, and decided to change it to make it more healthful. As written, it is a bit decadent for a typical breakfast. I cut the butter and sugar in half and it didn't have an effect on the flavor or texture at all. I also put some frozen, mixed berries in the baking dish before I added the oatmeal mixture. It is very tasty and my entire family loves it.   The recipe does make more than 4 servings. It is very filling.

This baked oatmeal is delicious!  I got several more servings than 8.  I found that 2 heaping Tbsp. with milk heated for 25-30 seconds in the microwave was plenty (and I usually don't eat small portions).  As suggested by one reviewer, I substituted 1/2 c. applesauce for the 1/2 c. butter and besides being healthier, it was very moist and tasty.  This is a definite crowd pleaser!  Next time I'll change up the fruit for a different twist.

This is a keeper.  With some of the suggestions, I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and used apple sauce for part of the butter. Also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon.  Instead of dried fruit, I used frozen blueberries and leftover fresh cranberries from Thanksgiving.  Probably good with all types of different fruit, and even some chopped walnuts or almonds!

Mm! This is fabulous. I'm a twenty year old university student living on my own, so one quick morning of baking provided me with breakfasts/snacks for the whole week! This definitely serves closer to eight-ten rather than four (when I'm alone that is, serving size all depends on how many hungry friends stop by, ha ha!)  To make this even healthier I:  Substituted the 1 cup brown sugar with a 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar, replaced the 1 cup milk with 1 cup of Light Vanilla Vitasoy, replaced the eggs with a mashed banana, & replaced the butter with a 2/3 cup homemade applesauce   I added some more cinnamon & threw some crumbled walnuts and apples in with this before baking. Delicious :3 great recipe!

If you love chocolate; try adding in some chocolate chips in w/ or w/out the raisins. It tastes great either way.

I thought this was fantastic! I added about 1.5 cups of frozen blueberries instead of the cranberries and loved it. I don't think I would have liked the cranberries nearly as much. I think it would be even better with walnuts added, too. It looks like some kind of cake, but it's really not.  It's very crumbly, but not dry. It's got a real old-fashioned taste and feel to it. I liked it best warm (not hot) with a little milk  or half-and-half over it.

I made this for our breakfast this morning; it had snowed last night (first of the year - could be the last!), and oatmeal sounded good, but didn't want the same old thing.  After reading the reviews, I cut the brown sugar by half, and used 1/4 c. Smart Balance vegetable oil instead of the butter.  It seemed to me that a 9 by 13 pan for 4 servings was maybe a typo, so I used an 8" square pan, sprayed with cooking spray, and baked for the 40 minutes, and after turning the oven off, let it sit in the warm oven for about 10 minutes.  It came out crispy on top, but was not dry at all, and my husband and son gave it two thumbs up. Just a word of warning - this made at least 6 servings, at least for the appetites in this house.  Which is fine, because now I have a quick breakfast for my busy weekday mornings!  Thanks for a nice break from the usual!

Instead of the butter (HEALTHIER!) I used half applesauce and half pureed zucchini (raw) along with a couple tablespoons of olive oil.  (You could use all zucchini or all applesauce.)  The texture was amazing and it was SO nice to be able to bake it the night before and have it ready for a quick breakfast. I doubled the recipe so we could eat it for 2 or 3 mornings.

Like most others, I used applesauce instead of butter, cut the sugar (and used equal parts splenda and brown suagr). Also, in addition to the cranberries, I added some roughly chopped granny smith apples and a big handful of chopped pecans. YUM!

Excelent!!! My 18 month old son could not get enough. I put it in a bowl and poured milk on it very yummy... Next time I am going to reduce the sugar, my wife and I thought it was to sweet.

Very good recipe.  I made the following changes after reading the other reviews.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 c,  used soymilk instead of milk and 1/2 c. applesauce in place of the butter. I also added 1/4 c. chopped walnuts, 1/2 c. chopped fried figs, and 1/2 c. dried cranberries.  I put a layer of sliced apples on the bottom of the pan, drizzled them with 1 T. of melted butter and sprinkled with 1 T. of brown sugar, added oatmeal mixture, then added another layer of sliced apple, butter, brown sugar.  It was a tad dry so I served it with a drizzle of maple syrup and a dollop of yogurt.

Very good!  Kids loved it.  I baked it in a 2 qt. dish rather than a 9x13 and think that the little bit smaller dish helped it stay moist.  Heated up great the next day just adding a little milk to it.

This is a great breakfast or snack recipe!  Very easy to change ingredients to suit your family's tastes.  I've substituted applesauce for the butter, raisins and chopped dried apples for the cranberries, even added nuts with great results.  I now make this on a weekly basis.  This is a keeper!

I had not heard of baked oatmeal before coming across this recipe.  I had no idea how it was supposed to turn out, but it was outstanding.  What a nice change in eating my daily oatmeal.  In fact my husband has already asked for more tomorrow.  My daughter even liked it, after she fished out the cranberries. I used half butter/ half applesauce and 3/4 cup brown sugar.

This is a great way to make oatmeal. I really enjoyed having this for breakfast. The only change I made was to cut the sugar in half, which was the perfect amount of sweetness for me. Also, this recipe made about 12 small servings that are really filling (I couldn't finish mine!)

Can't wait to try this with bananas, blueberries, and peaches!

My Dad had this at a little mom and pop restaurant, I kicked myself for not ordering it when our food came. so I came home and whipped up this recipe. Yummy! my 8 year old can't get enough of it.

If your looking for a nice fall comfort food, this is it! it makes your house smell sooooooo good too! 2 thumbs up from this house! Thanks Lucy

This recipe is wonderful!  I made it with raisins, and used Splenda for Baking instead of the sugar, 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup applesauce in place of the butter.  This will become one of our regular weekend breakfasts!  Great with yogurt and fresh berries.

This is a great recipe ,especially if you eat oatmeal almost every morning. Leftovers reheat well the next day. I used olive oil instead butter, a little maple syrup instead of the sugar, and frozen blueberries. It came out sort of cakey with a nice crust, and not crumbly at all...& yummy!Thanks for the recipe.

This was so easy and quick to mix up, and the flavor is wonderful.  I believe I will also try just a little bit more milk next time, as it did seem slightly drier than I thought it would- but it was still really good!  I liked the dried cranberries- would also like to try it again using raisins and some chopped pecans!

I made this in the Dutch oven when we went camping and it was fantastic! We doubled the recipe and it fed 14 easily. We baked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes. It was soft and gooey on the inside with a nice crunchy top.  It was delicious with a little milk poured over the top. My only suggestion is to add another 1/2 cup of milk to the recipe. We did and it was perfect. The ratio of oatmeal to milk was off a little on my opinion. I think it would have been dry without the extra milk. Overall a hearty breakfast with great flavor and everyone wanted the recipe!

Made it mostly as written. Used quick rolled oats because that's all I had and used 1 Tbsp of cinnamon. Make sure to grease the pan well. Baked only 30 min. Served with cream, nuts, flax seeds. Yum!

I have made this three times. I have decided I like to use 1/2 C of the brown sugar mixed in the batter and then sprinkle some brown sugar on top and bake.  I also substituted 1/2 C apple sauce for the butter and used 1 tsp of butter flavor extract to cut down on the fat. I used half the amount of cinnamon too bc it is a little overpowering. I used 1/4 C golden raisins instead of the cranberries and added 1/4 C chopped walnuts and a chopped apple. So delicious! I love this recipe because  its very versatile and it sticks to your ribs and carries you through almost until lunchtime. It is also delicious served warm with milk or cream poured over it. I would highly recommend it.

My husband enjoys this as a late night snack before bedtime. It's healthier than other snacks and is easy for him to warm up. I used coconut milk in my batch because I was using up items in the pantry.

This is really good, easy and quick.  The best part is no overnight oatmeal soak.  Craisins, raisins or cut dried apricots, let your dried fruit choices run wild!

Amazing base to work off of! What I did different: replaced butter with applesauce, added only half of the brown sugar but added about 2-4T of maple syrup.  I didnt have cranberries either.  Then I put it in a cupcake pan and baked at 350 for about 15-20 mins.  They rise, and came out as 12 perfect delicious muffins, they did not fall apart at all.  I ate the first one warm with milk.  Next time I will be adding nuts.

Just reduce the sugar to a half-cup and it is fabulous! And also reduce the baking time...20 minutes at 350 was enough.

So I have been searching for a baked oatmeal recipe using steel cut oats and since I did not find one, I tried to use this recipe and tweak it to see how it goes...(I know, don't review a recipe if you have changed it...but there are those of us who value feedback on the versatility of a recipe,,,) Anyway,  I scaled to one third, and used only 2 Tablespoons butter, 2 Tbs. coconut sugar, but added a mashed, overripe banana and a half cup of unsweetened applesauce. Increased the milk by a few tablespoons since I thought I might have to cook the steel cut oats a little longer than rolled oats. The steel cut oats were definitely still chewy after about 35 minutes of baking, if I try this again with steel cut, I will increase the wet ingredients a bit more. If serving to company, I would stick with rolled oats as the grittier steel cut oat texture may not be appealing to all.

My sister in law made this for us and we fell in love! We normally use raisins instead of cranberries. We like to serve it with a little warm milk and pancake syrup drizzled on top, and we add some crushed walnuts if we have them. You could make this dish really versatile with different toppings. The kids love it too!

I make this for my family all the time! It's so simple and saves time in the morning if it's assembled the night before. Just made a banana blueberry version that tasted like dessert even tho I cut the sweetener back to 1/2c. That way I can enjoy it with maple syrup on top too! Thanks for the amazing recipe

Tired this one on a whim! So glad I did, I followed the basic recipe as written and added walnuts and a couple of apples I had that needed using. It was wonderful! I will defiantly be making this again. I have frozen peaches and berries that would be great in this. We ate it warm for breakfast with yogurt and cold cut into bars as a snak. Thanks so much for this one!

This is my second try with baked oatmeal, and I like this recipe a lot.  My three year old and one year old thought it was great too.  It is helpful that they can eat it like a cookie.  I did back off on the backing time to about 30 to 35 minutes.  Hot out of the oven it, it is delicious with some whole milk poured on top.  I did sub applesauce for the butter and reduced the sugar some.  If you only have regular sugar, it still tastes yummy. I may add some overripe mashed banana and switch chocolate chips for raisins in the future.  If we didn't have a nut allergy in the house, I would add finely chopped pecans to those changes.

Been making this for years! My kids and I love it! Serving with warm milk is a must! We like it with fresh cranberries or raisins as well, and use just 1/2 cup brown sugar. We also bake it for 25-30 min, or until edges are brown and top is golden. I would say this serves about 6.

Great ! I replaced butter with applesauce too. I used only 1/4 cup sugar. Also I used 1/2 cup Almond milk with 1/2cup plain (original full fat) yoghurt, plus 1cup walnuts. Added 1Tblsp cinnamon to 1cup shredded coconut...sprinkled over mixture just before baking . This is a great recipe to play with. I handed out bars to get reactions. Omg. Rave reviews. I purposely set aside a couple to see how they held up. Even better ! A good healthy hit the road food . Luv'm ;-) NormaJ

The first time I made it, was according to the written directions. I would rate it 3 stars it was good but a little dry. I made it again after watching the video and put in a 8x8 pan and added 1 tsp of nutmeg. I also used light brown and dark brown sugar, it was delicious.

I really, really like this.  I give it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 simply because my family of 6 doesn't LOVE it.  They like it and will eat it, but it's not "divine."  I use frozen blueberries and cook it about 5-10 minutes less.  I do like it swimming in a bowl with some milk.  Feels very warm and comforting.

This was just ok to me.  If you're trying to eat oatmeal and hate the mushy texture of it made the traditional way, this is a good option. However, there isn't much flavor.  I did add a little extra cinnamon and cranberries, but if I make it again, I would add even more to try to make it have more taste.

I just ate a big bowl of this yumminess. It was delicious! The sweetness and texture were just right for my tastes. Hubby had a bite and said it was good, also. I used Craisins, but I'll try apples or blueberries next time. Very versatile.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I use the base recipe and just experiment with the cranberry part... I have tried several combinations and it always turns out great.  I have a pan of baked oatmeal in the oven right now...apples, walnuts, even a bit of caramel...I love the Fall flavors...

I halved the recipe and used a 7x5 inch glass dish.  I sprayed the dish to be sure it released.  I, too, served this with milk and my husband and I enjoyed this for an easy breakfast that is filling.  I would like some walnuts in it next time for a more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe Blanchl.

!AWESOMENESS! I *loath* regular oatmeal - seriously, the consistency simply makes me gag even though I adore everything associated with oats.  This recipe is the bomb (having already scarfed a huge bowl down).  Made a half recipe with only change being (as so many recommended) cut brown sugar in half and used 2T butter along with 2 heaping T of applesauce.  Baked in an 8x8" pan for 35" - soft without that goopy stick in the back of your throat sensation.  Love it!  Thanks so much for recipe.

Very good as written--like a less sweet oatmeal cookie. My only complaint is that 40 minutes seemed too long a bake time, and that you probably should grease the pan before putting the mixture in.

I made this recipe on Sunday and we had it for a quick breakfast all week - just microwave with some milk. I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and it was still plenty sweet.  I also omitted the butter and used 1/2 cup applesauce instead.  My kids loved it. Will make again.

Out of the 3 cups of rolled oats that the recipe calls for, we use one cup steel-cut oats (and 2 cups rolled oats). You will love the extra firmness and texture!!

This was excellent! I used this recipe to bake some oatmeal for friends who lost power in Hurricane Sandy. I made a couple changes and it was delicious still. I substituted applesauce for the butter (1 to 1), used slightly less brown sugar, and added one chopped macintosh apple at the end. Yummy! Everyone loved and appreciated it.

I have made this recipe 3 weekends in a row. We love it, especially my 1 year old. It is super easy to make and great for weekday mornings. Tastes great with a scoop of homemade pumpkin pie filling and cool whip! We are addicted!

Really yummy! Definitely enough for eight. I make this in a muffin pan for an easy breakfast for me and the kids. I baked, then put in the freezer. Pull it out when I get up and it thaws by the time we are ready to go. I cut the butter in half, so it is a bit healthier, and always add random extras, to mix it up.

Very good. I did 1/4 cup oil & 1/4 cup butter. I also added 1/4c pecans, 2 tbsp flax seed and about 1/2c blueberries. It turned out great!

I just tried this recipe. Tastes really good. A bit too sweet though so next time i will use half the amount of sugar.

This is a great basic recipe and very easy to customize.  Like other reviewers, I halve the brown sugar, don't use butter and increase the milk.  I make it every Sunday and portion to eat for the rest of the week... it reheats very well.

I made this recipe exactly as written but I used a smaller pan because we just moved and I couldn't fine the right size. I thought the sweetness was perfect, my family loved it! Only problem I have is that it was extremely crumbly...I guess I was thinking it would have more of a "meatloaf" consisty...I will be trying a few tweeks next time....to get lore of texture I was looking for.....but this was AMAZING even my brother who doesn't like oatmeal liked it!

Wow - this recipe alone got me to eat oatmeal!!!  My doctor always wanted me to eat this for breakfast for the many health benefits.
This version may not be as healthy as plain soggy oatmeal but the texture & taste is to die for!
I followed recipe as is, just cutting it in half - there is only one square left - we all loved it, even the dog!  I had dried cranberries on hand, which for 1/2 of the recipe, they sell in individual packages (1 oz. each), they were the perfect size.  Soooo yummy, so warm - thanks for sharing this - I shared it with my doctor too.

I followed what other reviewers did and lowered the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I also didn't add fruit. It was very good! Next time though I'd add more milk, as I would like the texture to not be so crumbly. We all enjoyed it.

Maybe its because I used soy milk, but this came out very dry and I was expecting it to have the texture of pudding or custer.

Steeped fresh vanilla bean in the milk for about 10minutes instead of extract, grated my own fresh cinnamon,added walnuts and did one with raisins and one without.  Delicious!

Delicious, easy, comforting breakfast - my 5 year old wants this every single day! 

Made a couple adjustments based on my personal preferences:
Used water instead of milk
Cut back to 1/4 cup butter
Used 1 tablespoon vanilla instead of 2 teaspoons.

Also, please note that the 1 cup brown sugar is NOT packed - we used 1 cup unpacked brown sugar, and it was just the right amount of sweet. This might be because we didn't use milk, which can add a lot of sugar, too.

I wanted to make this healthier so I made several changes... Used applesauce instead of butter, 1/4 cup of splenda brown sugar mix, 3 eggs, raisins instead of cranberries, and 2% milk. Was the best breakfast I have ever had! Already cooking batch #2 now and planning on making it often!

This turned out really well! The only change I made was substituting raisins for cranberries  as I didn't have any in the cupboard, but I will have to try this recipe with cranberries some other time. Fiancé and I both really enjoyed this breakfast so will definitely be making this again and experimenting with other ingredients.

I went exactly by the directions except for the baking time. I shaved off 10 mins. It came out really dry.  It was super crumbly, and stuck to the sides and bottom of the pan.  The flavor seemed a bit to salty.  I will try again but this time I will reduce the oven temp to 350.  I will add a touch more milk, tweak the salt and, put it in a bread pan.  Oh!, and add a hand full of pecans.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it exactly as the recipe states, then I made it a few more times, making changes to make it healthier.  Check out Debbie S' review for some great ideas.  I tried: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup chunky applesauce instead of butter (this substitution works great and makes it taste even better!), raisins, walnuts, and whatever fruit I have on hand (chopped apples, cranberries, blueberries, etc.).  I like my baked oatmeal "chunky" (lots of fruit in it), but with these modifications, it will hold together well.  I bake it at night and pop it in the fridge.  Then I slice it and eat it on-the-go with a cup of coffee.

This is a family favorite.  I would eliminate or at the very least cut out the salt....I also took out the sugar and added stevia, used almond milk, and one egg+ 2 egg whites, and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the butter.  This cuts down on the calories and makes it more "clean".

I cut the recipe in half and used a 9"x9" pan, but it ended up being too thin a layer to really eat as a bar; I put it in a bowl and ate it with milk, and it was very good.  (I halved the amount of sugar used, like many other reviewers.)

This recipe was a completely new thing for me, I have never tried baked oatmeal before. I dot't care for boiled oatmeal, so I wanted to try this. This recipe is a nice kick on oatmeal. I liked the flavor, my only complaint was the oatmeal was a little dry. Next time I would add more cranberries or maybe raisins.

This is definitely a keeper. The changes I made: quick-cooking oats (all I had on hand; if you use rolled oats, I think you could easily make this the evening before, cover it in the fridge, and bake in the morning), decreased sugar to 2/3 cup, used 3 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 2, unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and omitted the cranberries. I baked it for 30 minutes, drizzled on a little maple syrup, and broiled it for about 3-4 minutes (until the syrup was bubbly and the top was lightly browned). Next time, I am going to experiment and add a couple of apples (peeled and diced) to the mix. Yum, yum. This is a quick, easy, WARM breakfast that my husband and kids went crazy over.

I really didn't understand this recipe. I have seen it on the buzz quite a few times and finally decided to try it. Plus, I haven't tried an Amish recipe yet on AR that I didn't love. However, this tasted like a mix between oatmeal and a very unsweet cake. I have no reference to know if this is even right? I only did half the recipe to try this out. I baked it in a small pan, because I didn't want it too spread out and get hard and taste like a granola bar like others had mentioned. As I was cooking less, I also took it out ten minutes early. I am glad I did because it was completely done. It tasted better in a bowl with milk, but it still had a strange soft texture and blandness. I ended up tossing the rest, because I was certain it would not get eaten.

Delicious recipe.  I used Splenda for half of the sugar, and it turned out great.  So glad I found this recipe because it's a keeper.

I've never had anything like this before, so I made this recipe just to try it out since I had all the ingredients on hand. Its tasty, but strange. I'm sure we'll eat it all, but I don't know if I will ever make it again. Not that its bad, I think I would just rather have a granola bar or an oatmeal cookie.

Excellent recipe, easy to prepare and yummy beyond belief.  A keeper.  Rich and sweet (cut down the brown sugar if, like me, you prefer it not-so-sweet, you can add some later on top, if you'd like).

Great Recipe! My 3 kids loved it! I am not a fan of oatmeal but I like baked oatmeal (it's a texture thing for me). It was a little dry/crumbly, so I drizzled a little cream over it and it was perfect.

This is SO good.  I've always wanted to be able to eat more oatmeal,  ( but hated the stove top cooking method).
I now usually divide the batter in half to put raisins & walnuts in one half, & Hershey's Coco in  the other.  I increased the cinnamon to three teaspoons, and prefer quick oats to rolled.  They tasted even better the next day.  Very easy to freeze & wonderful to have on hand.

I didn't know there was such a thing as baked oatmeal until a friend mentioned making it for her kids on a cold winter day.  I got on AR and sure enough, found a great recipe, we all loved it! After the first time, though, I always cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup.  I also do half raisins and half cranberries that I've soaked in orange juice and rum extract for half an hour.  I just read a suggestion to use applesauce instead of butter and think I'll definitely give that a try next time.  I hate giving my kids so much butter.   Overall, it is a very versatile recipe that lends itself well to customization.  It's one we'll make over and over.

SO DELICIOUS!!!! Reminds me of my childhood big time!  I like chocolate chips so I replaced the cranberries with some of those and reduced the brown sugar a bit.  What a treat!

This was really good. I did decrease the sugar, add raisins instead of cranberries, added applesauce not butter and only coooked for 25 minutes. Small changes and I think following the recipe exactly would produce the same results.

Scrumptiously delicious!!! When I take this into work, the guys gobble it up and do not even realize they are eating oatmeal. The only thing I do different is add apples and raisins, instead of cranberries. I received a couple of requests to add nuts, so next time I make it I will add walnuts.

Great recipe. I add maple syrup, flax meal and wheat germ to give it a healthy, tasty kick. I used chopped apples instead of the cranberries. This recipe can be varied using fruits that are seasonal, which is what I love about it! I usually make this on a Sunday and then have plenty left for all week long!

Excellent.  I hate slimy oatmeal, but was giving it another try.  This was perfect.  Chewy, but not dry.  I also reduced sugar and substituted apple sauce.  I also plan to add flax and nuts.

This makes a really tasty, filling breakfast on a winter morning. With a few modifications based on some of the other reviews and my own preferences, I've been eating this almost every day for quite awhile now. Here's what I've done: 1.) since it's just for me, I make a half recipe in a 10x7-ish pan, 2.) sub unsweetened applesauce for all the butter, 3.) cut sugar in half again (1/4 c.), 4.) finely chop a granny smith apple & mix in, 5.) add about 1/4 c. chopped walnuts, 6.) bake about 35 min. I make it this way once a week and then each morning put a serving in a bowl, pour milk over the top, and microwave for 2 minutes. It comes out nice and soft but still with a hearty texture - delicious! I've also tried it with fresh blueberries and almonds instead of the apples and cranberries, but I didn't like that quite as much (probably because it wasn't as sweet). Definitely give this a try, though!

GREAT GREAT recipe.  I read the reviews and some said that the recipe called for too much sugar.  I disagree but it is a personal preference.  Don't get me wrong it was sweet but not overly sweet.  If you have to alter the sugar I would only cut out 1/4 cup.  You should only bake it for 25 minutes in a 13x9 pan or you will overcook.  With these instructions my baked oatmeal came out perfect.    Also, try topping with whipped cream and fresh cut strawberries, blueberries and banana!  Enjoy!

We loved this extra-rich version of baked oatmeal. I added semisweet chocolate chips as well as the cranberries. This is certainly the tastiest baked oatmeal I've made from this site, but it's also the one highest in fat (whole stick of butter!) and calories (whole cup of sugar!). Good thing we treat baked oatmeal as a weekend treat! Thanks for the recipe :O)

Like many others, I have also been looking for a different way to eat my oatmeal for the day. This is so good! To make it low calorie I used a mix of Splenda and Splenda brown (conversions are on the back for recipes). I used unsweetened Vanilla Almond Breeze instead of milk (omitted vanilla extract because of this), egg substitute and unsweetened applesauce instead of butter. I didn't have cranberries so I omitted them all together.  Tastes like a soft, bready granola bar and I loved it!  Next time I will cut back on the sugar. It was a little too sweet for me for breakfast.

Made this with 1/2 cup brown sugar, and chocolate chips instead of cranberries. Thought it would taste and cook up like a cookie, but didn't. The batter was very wet and dried in oven and became very chewy and crumbly. Next time I will just try a oatmeal cookie recipe instead.

This baked oatmeal is AMAZING!  We bake it in a 9x9 pan and it yields 9 servings.  We usually add walnuts and flax seeds.  We also use applesauce to cut down on the butter.  Last week we made it and couldn't find our dried cranberries so we did without and it was delicious!  I might like it even better without the dried cranberries.  You really could add any kind of nut or dried fruit you have on hand.  Enjoy!  It's good!!!

I eat oatmeal nearly every morning and after trying baked oatmeal at my local coffee joint and loving it, I had to try it for myself.  I reduced all ingredients in the recipe to 2/3s and baked in an 11 x 7 dish at 300 for 55 minutes (I was out for a run and that's how long it took!)  I used about 2/3 brown sugar and the rest Splenda.  I used I can't believe it's not butter fat-free spread (5 cal/serving), egg whites and a frozen berry mix for the fruit.  It comes out of the oven very dry, but that's the best part because you can add milk to it to make it your own consistency.  This hit the coffee shop version right on and I'm sure was much better for me.  My boyfriend agreed it was awesome!  I will be making this again for sure!!  We each ate half of what I made in the 11 x 7 baking dish and using Calorie King, it was only 545 calories each for a huge hearty yummy serving :)

I followed the suggestion to cut sugar in half and substituted applesauce for the butter. These were soooo yummy. And so good for a quick breakfast for my husband in the morning.

I have always been curious to try baked oatmeal and made it this weekend.  I am happy to say that it was very good!  I used dried apricots instead of cranberries.  Due to others suggestions, I also added some coarsely chopped almonds.  It was very good warm with a bit of milk poured over it.  A keeper!

This was an awesome recipe. I used Promise butter, 1/2 the amount of splenda brown sugar, egg whites and skim milk and it turned out great. I also added almonds and mixed dried fruit. Hits the spot! I heated mine up and served it with sugar free maple syrup. Yum!

It was a little lacking in flavor and a little dry.  However, it wasn't overly oily like some baked oatmeal recipes I've tried.  It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure I'll make it again.

This is a winner!  Much, much, much  better than any of those oatmeal bars that stores sell.  For people like me who don't like extremely sweet things here are the changes I made:  lowered the brown sugar to 3/4 cup; increased the oat amount to 3 1/4 cups and used 1 cup chopped pecans instead of cranberries.  BTW, I was unable to find rolled oats so I used Old Fashioned Oats and after doing research on the internet found out that its an excellent substitute.

I've had baked oatmeal and oatmeal pie before and loved it, so was looking forward to making this. It wasn't good -- dry, crumbly and plain not worth the wait time. Adding some brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla to regular oatmeal would have been tastier. Sorry. Guess I'll keep looking for that elusive, delicious oatmeal pie I had at a B&B

Great recipe! Very filling and easy to throw together before kids go off to school!  Done a few variations with add-ins for variety and it's always a hit. I'm not much of an oatmeal person (it's a texture thing) but this recipe is fantastic! It stays slightly crunchy so you don't have the gloppy goo that oatmeal usually turns into.

YUMMY!  I love this recipe topped off with a little milk.  I am an oatmeal lover in general, but I never thought of putting oatmeal and butter together, but it was a treat!  I also cut the brown sugar in half.  It was plenty sweet that way.  I also agree with previous reviews that said the serving size was off.  One pan could feed 6 to 8.  I will definitely make this again!

I replaced the eggs with 2 teaspoons of oil and 2 tablespoon pf water. Also reduced the amount sugar to a third and added a 2 tsp of honey. Threw in some frozen berries since i dint have any fresh ones around, and hence had to bake it a little longer. It turned out amazing. Everyone loved it!

Did not care for this recipe; did cut the sugar to 1/2 and the butter, way to much for sugar/fat healthy eating; regardless, the texture was mushie and taste was bland. I'll stick to my oatmeal on plain yogurt with almonds and honey.

I doubled everything except the brown sugar and the butter, and added freshly grated nutmeg.  I had dried wild blueberries on hand, so I used those.   Absolutely wonderful!  Warmed up with whipped cream... Oh My Goodness!!!!  I only have one piece left!

This is the only way my husband will eat oatmeal. I like to add cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves to the mix, but the recipes is still good as it stands. I do, however, omit the salt for we think it is fine without it. I will add things like raisins, dried cranberries, fresh/frozen blueberries, peaches, peanut butter, choc. chips.... whatever I have on hand. But my husband prefers it without those additions. You can also add about 1/4 - 1/2 more butter and they make wonderful oatmeal cookies.

I changed this a little. I added less sugar, and added grated apple since I only had a few raisins left. It turned out great, a very hearty breakfast that keeps you going for hours!

I have rated this recipe with my modifications in mind.  There is a local coffee house in town that has THE BEST oatmeal bake I have ever had!  I have searched high and low for a similer recipe on allrecipes and this one here, along with my modifications is the closest it has come.  (I have tried about a dozen recipes on here.)  To this recipe I added:  two cups sifted flour, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tsp nutmeg, dash allspice, I substituted 1 cup frozen berries (chopped) for the cranberries.  I bake in glass so I added 20 degrees to the temp.  I will state that I have not perfected the dish yet.  What I will do the next time: add one more egg (it was still a little too crumbly), add one baking apple, diced; and halfway thru the baking time I would brush with milk and sprinkle with sugar (not as much as you would do for a pie but it needed just a little more sweet). All of the baked oatmeals I have tried on here are way too dense.  This one is more like 1/2 way between a coffee cake and traditional baked oatmeal.

This is my new comfort food!!!  It does serve about 8.  I added craisins instead of raisins....easily coud have done with half the butter.  I have made it twice in the past week with the only change being the craisins and will make it again on Monday.  I love it.

Love this recipe. I used egg beaters in place of the eggs, substituted applesauce for half of the butter and used the brown sugar made by splenda.(one thing to remember if you use the brown sugar from splenda is that if it says in the recipe 1 cup you only use 1/2 cup of the splenda brown sugar. I forgot to do that.) Still turned out great but was sweet.

Fabulous!  I followed the advice of other reviewers: -Halved the sugar, and used 1/4 C Splenda & 1/4 C brown sugar -Substituted out half of the butter for 1/4 C applesauce -Baked for around 30 minutes and it came out perfect--crispy edges/crust, almost as if there were nuts in there, and soft center.   -Used raisins the first time I made it and it was so yummy--they plumped up and were fat and juicy. -Poured about 1/4 C cold milk onto the piping hot oatmeal in the bowl.  So delicious. -Once I made it I forgot the vanilla--and I missed it!!  Vanilla is key. -This is my go-to breakfast at least once a week, and is even great as a snack cold or room temp.

I followed the recipe exactly, and thought it turned out great. It kind of reminded me of spice cake mixed with a soft granola bar. My husband liked it, but he said he'd prefer it with more fruit next time. I'll definitely be making this again.

This looks and smells so beautiful.  In an attempt to be more heathy, I knicks the butter used 1/4 cup applesauce and some olive oil and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I was still darn good!  I can imagine the recipe as written rocks.  I love that it is so flexible too.  Next time I will add some flax seeds.  Thanks.

This was good, but not quite what I was looking for. I wonder if maybe I am just not familiar with the term "baked oatmeal?" I found it came out more like a pan of chewy granola bars; very dense, very dry compared to what I think of oatmeal as. And I added an extra cup of liquid on seeing the mixture before baking. The flavor was very very nice, but I couldn't figure out how to eat it! On a plate with a knfe and fork?

I made the recommended changes since I was looking for a healthier breakfast.  1/2 the sugar, applesauce instead of butter, all else the same!  Great recipe!

Just what I needed.  I work in a fabulous pastry shop, and when I arrive there it is full of scones, danish and rich coffee cakes.  I really needed a nice lowfat recipe to have when I needed a healthy breakfast.  I did use the applesauce instead of the butter (perfect) and mixed dried fruit chopped.  Other than that, made it as written and it took only 30min. in my oven.  I'll be bringing this on vacation too, fantastic!!!

FABULOUS! I love how spicy this is! As suggested in the reviews, I added 1/4 t. cloves, only used 1/2 c. brown sugar, and substituted 1/4 c. melted butter and 1/4 c. applesauce for the 1/2 c. butter. I also added some sweetened flaked coconut and ground flax seed. I will be making this often!

These were too dry and crumbly! A pain to eat and none of the 9 people here liked them. I'll never make them again.

Loved these. Made a smaller amount so that I could put it in an 8" square pan. Had to wait for it to cool completely for it to hold together. Used a mix of dried apples, apricots, raisins & cranberies. Yum!

Tasty and filling!  I did "health" this up a bit - used slightly less sugar (about 3/4 cup), skim milk, egg substitute and Smart Balance spread - and I used a combination of cranberries and dried blueberries.  Came out a tad bit drier that what I expected, so I either add a bit of milk or a drizzle of honey or syrup to each serving.  Might try some sort of fruit sauce, too.  I will make again - maybe add some bananas or applesauce for more moisture, though. **** Update: Ok, I'm changing from 4 to 5 stars:  Even better the next day!  I cut into squares, wrapped individually and froze, then I reheat individual servings in the microwave for 30 seconds and they're delicious!

Halved the recipe and baked in individual dishes. Baked too long and was very crispy. Cut the time in the future. Good though.

I like to make this the night before and and cut it into squares and have it for breakfast. I warm it up and pour a little milk over it. It is great! I also changed the fruit to peaches. It is very tasty!

This is my 8yo daughters absolute favorite with cranberries!  She eats it for breakfast, dessert, and snack hot or cold all day when I make it which means that I actually triple the recipe and make it in a 10X13 pan.

I looked everywhere for a recipe to match the one at a local coffee shop for baked oatmeal and I finally found it! This one tastes great! It's exactly what I was looking for and WAY less expensive than the cafe :)

I found it to be way too sweet.  I'm going to try 1/2 cup of brown sugar next time.  

When I made mine I omitted the raisins and topped it with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and homemade whipped cream.  DELISH!

I used the original recipe as a great basis, but as I read other reviews most thought there was too much sugar.  I cut it down to 1/4 but used Splenda for baking instead.  I also substituted apple sauce for the butter, and replaced 1/3 of the cranberries with walnuts.  I I was just as satisfied... doing this only cuts down the calories by approximately 25%.  Also, I made them into 2x3 inch bars, so it made 16 bars... around 140 calories a bar, so I could have them as a snack instead.  I also used soy milk instead of dairy milk.  Over all, very tasty, a recipe to keep.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the quantity of sugar.  Had I made it with the original measurements, it would have been way too sweet.  I might even cut down on the sugar a little more next time.  Thanks for sharing!

So yummmmmy! I love this recipe. I make baked oatmeal often and this is sooo good. However It becomes dry and crumbly within a few days...how do you prevent that? I wnoder what would happen if you added a banana...Very good recipe though. I eat it for snacks and breakfast and my mom likes it too. (I am a teenaged girl)

This was nice! I also used half butter/half applesauce, and only 1/2 c. brown sugar. And used craisins. My kids loved it mixed with some yogurt.

Wow! This was delicious! I almost left out the cranberries because my daughter spotted them but I decided to put them in anyway and let her pick them out. She loved this and my son who dislikes oatmeal even liked this. I did add just a little more milk to it before I baked it though.

This was very different--after looking at the finished product very suspiciously, we tried it, and decided we liked it.  I suggested pouring some milk over it, but nobody in the family wanted to do that, so we actually had it with butter and maple syrup, with bacon on the side.

Great way to get oatmeal in your kids!  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and decreased the margarine to 1/4 cup, added a 1/4 cup applesauce, and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, turned out perfectly, kids loved it!

I normally don't like oatmeal because of the mushy texture, but I decided to try this because I had all the ingredients and wanted something yummy for breakfast. I halved the recipe (which ended up being closer to four servings) and halved the amount of sugar and butter as well. I also added extra milk, chopped apples and slivered almonds. Wow! It's really good, not too sweet (could maybe use a little more sugar - I'll do 3/4 the amount next time) and the texture is not too mushy! Yay! I found a way to enjoy oatmeal! Thanks!

I hate to give a recipe rated so high a low rating but my children and I didn't like this at all. The texture was like soft granola and was way to sweet. Sorry maybe baked oatmeal isn't for us.

My daughter went to camp and begged me to make a baked oatmeal at camp.  This recipe is wonderful.  My kids eat it hot out of the pan with milk or applesauce on top.  Then, afterwards when it is cool, they cut it in squares and eat it as a bar.  I add 1/2 cup more milk to make it creamier.  Thanks!!

If I could give this a 10 I would!!!!  Excellent, superb, irresistable!  I used chopped apples and raisins instead of cranberries just because I didn't have cranberries at home.  Except for that, I didn't change a thing.  I live in Pennsylvania Amish country (2 miles from Smicksburg) and was a little doubtful when I read the description, but my my, this is definitely a Pennsylvania Amish taste.  I read a review that compared it to tasting like oatmeal cookies and milk, I agree!  I think I'll add this one to my Christmas breakfast menu!!! Thank you for the wonderful post!

I thought this was delicious, especially where it was crispy on the edges, but I probably won't make it again because my husband hates oatmeal.

I did first make this recipe as written, and I would give it 4.5 stars as written. BUT here is also my favorite (so far) tweaked version: replace butter with pumpkin puree, only use 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp salt (full amount was too salty for me), replace cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice, add 1 chopped apple. I also threw in some mini chocolate chips once and that was super good! I had read somewhere to "never never never replace butter/oil because it will be too dry"--not so! I actually found it more dry and crumbly with the butter than with the pumpkin puree. Planning to try mashed bananas and applesauce versions next!

Thank you for the recipe!  The first time I used regular oatmeal & it was a bit hard & chewy until the next day.  Adding cream to each serving helped to soften it.  The 2nd time I made it with quick cook oatmeal - delicious muffin like texture.  

Like others I increased cinnamon, added 1 tsp vanilla & reduced the sugar by half.  I used frozen saskatoons once & wild frozen blueberries once.  Delicious healthy breakfast or snack.

I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup and then everyone in the family just sweetens to their liking. I also chop one apple with the peel on and add it to the batter before baking. Only bake for 25-30 minutes or it dries out. Serve with a drizzle of half n half. It's so good and my younger son specifically asks me to make this baked oatmeal!

Loved this.  I used quick oats which worked well and also allowed it to be cut into squares.  Yum!  Perfect side for the kid’s lunches.

Super Yummy! I added in 2 mashed bananas,  4 Tbs flaxmeal, 2 Tbs Hemp hearts, 1 Tbs Chia seeds, and a handful of chopped Walnuts. You could eat it as is, or top it with maple syrup, whipped cream, berries of any kind! YUM! Great texture, in between a crisp and oatmeal!

A great recipe! I did change a couple things. Instead of the sugar I added half apple sauce and organic agave. And instead of cranberries I added fresh apple pieces. Thank you for the recipe!

Carefully layered in 10 oz bag of frozen blueberries instead of cranberries and it was perfect. Plan to try rum soaked raisins next time. 

Simultaneously tried 2 baked oatmeal recipes and this one was preferred. Served with vanilla yogurt.

I used sliced granny Smith apples instead of cranberries, added a couple tbsp of maple syrup, and replaced the cinnamon with 1/2 nutmeg 1/2 ginger.  It's a very versatile recipe and I love it every time I use it.

I made it for the first time today.  I only had 2 cups of rolled oats so I scaled back by a third.  Used a 9 x 9 pan.  These are really delicious!  Even my husband, who disparages oatmeal, ate it with milk and enjoyed baked oatmeal!

I made this for my Rotary club and they loved it.  I added a cup of pecans, 1 extra egg, 1/4 extra milk.
When I make it again, I will decrease the amount of cinnamon and add 1/4 tsp cardamom,  along with the changes above the and cover it when baking.
It stays with you all morning, in a good way.

Very good.  I used broiler for about 5 minutes at the end to give it a crunchy texture.  Added brown sugar and milk before eating.  Loved it!

I made it just as written. It is wonderful. This is actually my fourth time making it. I thought I reviewed it already, but I hadn't. Last time, I added fresh blueberries in it instead. And I cooked it a few minutes more to compensate for the liquid from the fresh blueberries. It was delicious. I am sure I will make it a fifth time, and many more.

I used raisins because that's what I had in the house.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  I like sweet so I didn't mind the cup of brown sugar.  I used parchment paper in case it  stuck to the pan. Delicious,  a little crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Cut into perfect squares! Breakfast or snacks for the week!

I've tried many baked oatmeal recipes and this is definitely my very favorite. I don't change much. I've made various changes and substitutions over the years but always go back to the original recipe. I do use a combination of brown sugar and Splenda to cut down on the sugar, but I haven't found a good solution for the half stick of butter. I've tried using part butter/part applesauce, but it just dries it out. 

I also always add a bit of maple extract - maybe 3/4 tsp? As far as fruit, don't limit yourself to what the recipe calls for! I always include frozen blueberries and cranberries. From there, I change it up. Sometimes, I also add dried cranberries. This time I added apple and pecans. Walnuts are goo, too! Sometimes I add fresh blackberries; that's one of my favorites. There is so much you can do to make it different each time! 

I eat it usually with a couple spoonfuls of vanilla Greek yogurt. If I don't have the yogurt on hand, vanilla almond milk (just enough to moisten it well) is a good second choice. I'm thinking about adding some other healthy goodies like flax or chia seeds, and I plan to continue working on alternatives for a half stick of butter. 

I cut it in to six or eight pieces and eat it over the course of a week. Give this recipe a try - there's so much you can do with it! It stores great in the fridge for about a week. Just pop the pieces in the microwave (chop it up a bit first), then add yogurt, vanilla Greek yogurt, milk, or almond milk and ENJOY!

These taste great! The reason why I gave four stars is because of the cooking time, which is very off in my opinion. I have to leave these for at least ten minutes less than the given cooking time, other wise it will turn black. However, when I adjusted the timing, this tasted amazing! I make this a lot, so thanks for a good recipe.

Made this for my sister who hadn't eaten it for years since her days at university. She absolutely loved it. I liked that the oatmeal was chewy, sweet and buttery.

I have made this recipe time and again. I highly recommend it. I like to add blueberries and pecans. I have also made it for vegan friends substitute the eggs w two bananas. Use almond milk. Honestly I don’t put the butter in because one time I forgot it and it didn’t taste any different to me. This is such a great simple recipe.

I have made many different recipes of baked oatmeal and this one isn't great.  The amount of salt is way too much.  You probably only need 1/4-1/2 tsp at that is it.  The cooking time for a gas oven is too much.  Bring it down to 30 minutes max.  THe amount of sugar is ok.  I used 3/4 cup and it was fine.  Any less than that it would be more bland.

I had baked oatmeal in a coffee shop several weeks ago. Enjoyed it so much I decided to try it at home.  Based on other reviews I decreased the sugar and butter, used fat free milk, added applesauce and cranberries. It was moist and delicious!  The slice in the coffee shop was tall.  The next time  I make this, I'll bake in a loaf  pan or double the recipe and bake in a high sided casserole dish.

I've made baked oatmeal before but never with eggs, baking powder, salt, etc. . 
I did as others, used 1/4 Truvia brown sugar  rather than white granulated.  I put chopped apples in as well.
I did use 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. applesauce..as for the comments regarding lower carbs..don't use applesauce and keep the butter....and well, if you are getting rid of carbs...I wouldn't recommend oats... Also, as we now know of the pesticides in oats, I use Bob's Red Mill Organic..only one with decent rating on EWG site. Next time, I am going to double the milk - I used old time oats - not quick oats, could be why mine is dry,  keep the butter as recipe states..as mine was dry. I used 1 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. nutmeg, and scant 1/4 t. cardamom...goes well with apple. Oh, will also, put in 9x9 pan, lower temp. - 325 or better yet, slow cooker over night.

We cut the sugar in half, and use a natural sweetener.  Also top it with sugar free chocolate chips.  The kids LOVE it.  Only needs to cook for 20 minutes

This was a nice recipe however I agree with other cooks, too much sugar. I used the Whole Earth  splenda sugar blend, (1/2) cup, and for my own tastes, unflavored almond milk and 1/2 cup almonds as I like nuts in my oatmeal!

A delicious recipe.
This recipe only needs a 1/2 cup of sugar. It is very satisfying with half the sugar. I also added a cup of water.  One of the best baked oatmeal recipes.

We love this recipe. I make it, and it’s good for breakfast for my wife and me for about 3 days. I make it as written, but I like to add about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of chopped pecans, too. I serve it warm and we do add a little milk to it in the bowls (I get the impression from some of the reviews that some people are eating it “as-is”, and that doesn’t seem right.

I made this twice but second time I didn't have quite enough oats and no dry fruit and it came out better! The second time I modified the following... 2 Cups of oats, 3/4 cup milk, 1 egg, 2/3 cups brown sugar, 1.5 tsp baking powder, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract, 1 cup chopped partially frozen strawberries. Everything else the same.

I have a bit of a sweet tooth so I add chocolate chips to my baked oatmeal. It is a favorite on Christmas morning! I didn't have cranberries but I never really use them anyhow; swap the cranberries out for semi-sweet chocolate chips. Next time I hope to add dried  cranberries or cherries in addition to the chocolate! I also mix in a splash of milk and mix it up a bit before eating.

I made it exactly as the recipe suggested and it is delicious. No too sweet. Everyone loves it!  Crispy topping and a little moist and chewy in the body. Actually,  I did use dried cherries which are a nice add. Great for breakfast, snack or dessert. Whipped cream could be good with it, too.

A good fundamental recipe that is easily modified. I did a trial run with 1/2c sugar and it wasn't sweet enough.  I also used soy milk and added about 1/4 tsp cloves.  The second time I used 3/4c sugar, an applesauce/oil mix to substitute for the butter due to a co-worker's allergies, and I added more like 1 1/4c soy milk.  Still added cloves.  I liked the second version much better and had multiple requests for the recipe.

Loved the recipe! Sprayed the pan with nonstick cooking spray, added more cinnamon and nixed the cranberries. Crunchy on top with great flavor! Put it with milk in a bowl and it’s so good!

This is my favorite and easy recipe.  I have been enjoying baked oatmeal for over twenty years.  I leave out the cranberries, but I serve in a bowl and top with sliced peaches and heavy whipping cream.  Make for my church about once a quarter in 2 or 3 buffet trays, triple the recipe for each tray.  They love it.

Very yummy.  We fried some apples in butter and a little sugar and mixed them in before baking.  No craisins since my toddler doesn't like them.  Enjoyed by all, will make again!

Yum, this is the best oatmeal I've ever had!  Of course all the butter kind of defeats the purpose of having oatmeal...lol.   I will try to  substitute with some applesauce next time.

I made the oatmeal the night before, put it in the fridge, and baked it the next morning. I halved the recipe since it is just my husband and I. It still can be cut into 8-10 pieces. This is a great recipe to add in ingredients on hand. Instead of cranberries I added pecans. After it was baked I added fresh cut peaches and drizzled real maple syrup on the top. It was like eating dessert for breakfast! My husband loved it too. Thanks for sharing, Blanchl!

I love this recipe. I put in fresh red raspberries that I cut up into pieces and I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. It is wonderful warm with some almond milk. YUMMMMMMMMMM! Thank you for helping me figure out a yummy breakfast option.

I've already made this tons of times. Love this recipe! I usually do about a 1/2 cup of sugar since I pair it with a strawberry rhubarb sauce when it's served. Delicious!

I made this Baked Oatmeal following the recipe as posted with the following changes.  First, I replaced the cranberries with 21 oz canned apple pie filling and then I added 8 oz cream cheese cubed after I put it in the 9×13 cake pan before baking.   It was not dry at all! Was very good with whipped cream or milk.   I live in the heart of the PA Dutch Country and my family loved it!

Super yummy!!! I really liked it. I left out the cranberries, and topped it with warm milk and brown sugar. This was very yummy, though next time I think I will bake it a little longer because I prefer slightly drier oatmeal. Overall though it was great!!!

This was a total flop for me and I followed directions and read reviews.  I already was baking an oatmeal for months in 8x8 pan that is delicious, but wanted to try this one.  Nope a winner at all for me, sure wish it could have been.

I added a bit more milk because my oats just seemed really dry.  Also only added 1/2 sugar (or splenda in my case) and a couple granny smith apples.  I think I might have over measured my oats.  Upped the cinnamon a bit due to the apples.  Otherwise followed as is.  It's tasty and a nice quick breakfast or snack.  This is a really versatile recipe.  It was plenty sweet with 1/2 cup as well, so I really wouldn't do more than that.  In fact, you can probably put less if you want to.

I love this recipe and make it often, but with only half the sugar. It is way too sweet for us as written, and still delicious with less sugar. We like to top it with Greek yogurt, either plain or vanilla.

So, yes. .this is a keeper but I did make a *few* tweaks to this to get the consistency I wanted. After reading a few reviews that talked about it being more of a crunchy granola, I decided to take matters into my own hands and let my ingredients guide me, so to speak, lol! I wanted a more "cakey" texture so I knew that I would add flour to it.  Here are the things that took place whether I wanted them to or not... 

I used the regular amount of oats (rolled I think they were). I didn't have enough cinnamon so it ended up being more like a 1/2 teaspoon rather than 2.. This kinda bummed me out because I love cinnamon but I decided to press forward. I used the regular amount of salt and baking powder. I used about a 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil and 1/4 cup of melted butter. I would have used the entire half cup of coconut oil had it not taken ages for it to finally melt. I didn't have time to wait! Then, I substituted vanilla almond milk for the whole milk. Not that I don't like whole milk, I had it, but just wanted to use almond milk. I did use the entire cup of brown sugar and it isn't too sweet, thankfully. It is quite mild but enough to be delicious. In the future I want to substitute it with honey and see what my results are. I have to add here that when I was mixing everything up, I noticed that the amount of "wet" wasn't enough and so I added probably another 1/2 cup of almond milk...and then thought that I had made a mistake in adding too much because I hadn't added th

made this twice, first time I burnt it. what's perfect in my oven is in a 9 inch square pan at 350 for 20-25 minutes.
I did it with blueberries and then cranberries, both were good
I also only used 1/4 of a cup of sugar, and it was just right. next time I might use a little less butter just because of calories. and my perfect serving size was this make 6.

I have this 5 stars because it’s not fair to give less when you don’t really love oatmeal. I was hoping this would make me like it enough to eat it regularly.. this recipe made oatmeal editable for me but not enough to say I like this! I cut the sugar in half, if I added the full cup it would probably be better, but then you are back to having to much sugar to weight watch.

This is a wonderful warm breakfast. I made half the recipe in a 9X9 pan, used less brown sugar, replaced the cranberries with a generous cup of blueberries and added two overflowing tablespoons of chia seed. I baked it and refrigerated it and warmed up a serving in the microwave the next morning. I poured some milk over the top after warming and enjoyed a warm filling breakfast. This is a fabulous winter breakfast

Great end result but by cutting the sugar in HALF (and not even packing the brown sugar- so really cutting it more than in half). Still PLENTY sweet. Also swapped out frozen blueberries for the cranberries. Easy and kids loved it.

This is a very basic recipe that you can alter to your tastes. I healthified it by doing some substitutions. 
I used 3 cups rolled oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 2 tsps baking powder, 1 tsp each cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice, 1 cup milk, 2 large eggs, 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce, 2 tsps vanilla and a Granny Smith apple peeled and diced. 
I baked in a casserole dish, a 9x13 pan is too big, 9x9 would be better. I ate it as is warm from the oven, my sons put more milk over it, it was very tasty and filling. The servings are a bit small, my teenagers ate 2-3 pieces each.

I halve the recipe and made some changes, added 1t cinnamon, substituted butter with cinnamon flavor applesauce, omitted sugar as applesauce and cranberries are sweet enough for us. Added 1/4t ground cloves and 1/4C oat bran like one reviewer did.  Separated batter in two 7” round baking dish, baked them for 15min.   Wouldn’t put sliced bananas on top next time unless we gonna finish it right away as they turned into black quickly.

This is a great recipe! If you use rolled oats instead of quick cooking, increase the liquid to 2 cups water and 2 cups milk so that the oats will cook properly. As others have done you can vary the fruit as desired - I’ve made it with chunked apples & cranberries and another time with cherries, blueberries & cranberries and dried pineapples. It keeps in the fridge for a few days just fine.

This was an amazing recipe for baked oatmeal! I didn't have any brown sugar :( so I did replace it with white and I used mostly steel cut oats as well. Next time I will use brown sugar but I'm not sure how much better it can get

It was sweet. Pretty much like an oatmeal cake (with little flour) in the morning but I found adding whatever protein-rich things I had really made it even more filling. Definitely something I will make when I want something sweet in the morning and something that is filling!

I searched for a recipe for baked oatmeal after trying it at an Amish buffet.  This one tastes exactly like it, minus the cranberries, which I removed for my picky kid.  Although the sweetness is perfect for those who like their oatmeal sweet, I will probably cut down on the sugar next time, since I'm trying to watch my sugar intake.  The recipe is delicious exactly the way it is though.

Great recipe for a fall Sunday morning. Easy and yummy. I chopped up a couple of freshly picked Cortland apples and used those in place of the cranberries. I also add a touch of nutmeg. A half cup of butter is quite a bit. I think next time I will use a quarter cup of butter and a quarter cup of applesauce.

Overall:  Great, warming, EASY, toothsome, morning goodness.
Highly recommend for a special, weekday or easy, weekend bowl of yummy goodness.  Family & friends will love!
I read previous reviews (about 60 back), and made the following custom preferences...with great success:
1.  I made full recipe and used 8x8 pan (instead of 9x13).  This led to scoop-able, moister oats.  Heavily-butter the 8x8 glass.
2.  I used 3/4 C brown sugar (not 1 C)
3.  I used 1/4 C butter and 2/3 C sweet applesauce (franlky, every good baker or cook uses butter wherever possible.  There is a reason it is called for.  Use it...happily!)
4.  I added 1 tsp of ground clove.
5.  I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.
6.  I added 3/4 C of cherry "Craisins".
Baked for 45 min.  
Perfectly browned top and moist center.  Small amount of crumb effect.
Other reviewers have great input & useful suggestions.  The clove & nutmeg deepen the taste and reminded me of a "home" recipe.  Very good & will make again!

I used water in place of milk and added an extra egg (because I was out of milk). I used  about 3-4 T better that I just cubed and threw in the bowl.  Added frozen blueberries to mix and popped it in the oven. It was super good.

Very tasty recipe! The only changes I would make would be to cut the sugar in half (at least!) and cut the butter back to 1/4 cup.  Other than that, it is a wonderful recipe that can easily be changed up using apples, nuts, cherries or whatever you fancy. I will be making this again!

I've made this recipe several times & really love it; a perfect make ahead breakfast!  I've been adding an extra teaspoon of cinnamon & making it sugar free by using brown sugar splenda. It's so good & reminds me of an oatmeal cookie. I add extra milk to make it less crumbly & have used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil which works, but makes the texture more dense.

This was a great basic recipe with many possible variations. I forgot to add the baking powder, but it didn't seem to hurt anything. I cut back on the butter and brown sugar by half and still thought it was plenty sweet (you can always drizzle with maple syrup when serving if it's not sweet enough for your family). I added chopped apples and walnuts instead of the cranberries because that's what I had on hand.

Made this with 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter, no vanilla, and about 1 cup of blueberries. It was perfectly sweet, but a bit too crumbly to hold and eat - maybe more butter would help?  Baked for only 25 min until the edges were golden brown. We ate about half the pan in one sitting!

I made it as written.  It tasted good but the consistency was very dry and crumbly, almost like eating an oatmeal muffin that exploded.  The recipe said to bake in a 13x9 pan which I did but I think that was a mistake.  If I were ever to make again, I'd use a much smaller pan so it doesn't dry out as much.

I made this for a quick and relatively healthy dessert. We are vegan, so I substituted "flax eggs", cashew milk, and vegan butter. I added a diced apple, too, and a little extra cinnamon.

This recipe is lacking something.  I remember eating healthy size warm bricks of oatmeal with veins of brown sugar.  This recipe yields something similar to traditional oatmeal but with an ample amount of cinnamon and brown sugar.  The biggest thing i noticed is that the oats don't seem to fully cook.  They are still pretty tough

Love baked oatmeal! Made a triple batch for a family vacation. I cut the sugar and salt in half and had lots of toppings available including yogurt, honey, fresh cut peaches, fresh blueberries, dried apricots and cranberries, nuts, seeds, bananas, granola, and mini chocolate chips.

This version is excellent! I admit, I made some changes to make it a bit healthier. I subbed Equal for most of the brown sugar and I used unsweetened apple sauce and plain Greek yogurt instead of the melted butter. I also only had 1/2 a cup of dried cranberries on hand. But this baked into moist tasty squares that are so perfect for a quick breakfast all week! I've been microwaving a slice and topping it with either jam or cookie butter!

I loved it! Changes I made : 1  teaspoon baking powder and 2 tablespoons cinnamon and 1/4 cup ground flax seed and instead of a full cup sugar I added 1/4 cup blend of brown and organic cane sugar.  It was not to sweet especially with the dried cranberries.

Giving original recipe 4 stars- super easy to make, Ike the texture but found it a bit too sweet and missing a bit more cinnamon.
Made it again following reviewers' suggestions and halved the sugar and added more cinnamon. Also used coconut oil instead of butter and almond coconut milk instead of milk. Yummy if you like the coconut flavor!

I love baked oatmeal. I lived in Pennsylvania for many years, and fell in love with Dutch/Amish cooking. This is a great recipe, but I like adding some of my own favorites. Try adding fresh or frozen berries. I buy a bag of frozen mixed berries and add about a cup (save the rest for smoothie), cut down to one apple, use coconut oil instead of butter, and add small dollops of cream cheese...Voila! Delisssshhhhh! Refrigerate or freeze in serving sizes (nowadays I cook for one)

It's really good.  I added orange extract before baking and a dollop of homemade whipped cream (with a dash of Grand Marnier) before serving.

I made the recipe as is,  or so I thought. I thought the recipe said to add 2 tbsp (tablespoons) of cinnamon, and since I'm all about the cinnamon flavor right now,  I added an extra tablespoon. So,  I added a total of 3 tablespoons of cinnamon. It actually came out great. Very cinnamon-y! I topped it with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and banana. Poured some milk,  and went to town with it. Can't wait to make it again.

Made it with frozen berries once, once with frozen berries and fresh banana slices.  Second time I had no butter, substituted with olive oil and half-and-half. Turned out great. Since I can't eat sugar I didn't taste it myself, but my 5yo twins and teens all loved it.

I hate oatmeal, but this is pretty good!  After reading reviews, I cut the sugar in half, used a chopped apple instead of craisins, and added a handful of pecans.  Also baked in a 9" square pan.  Very filling breakfast with a little milk, and had some leftovers warmed up with a little scoop of ice cream tonight, and was a pretty satisfying dessert!  (Only baked 30 minutes, and might bake a few minutes longer next time to see if I like a little drier, more granola like texture.)

This recipe is a great basic recipe for baked oatmeal. Besides cranberries, you can use practically anything; canned or fresh fruit (think peaches, blueberries, or even banana), raisins, nuts, etc. I actually found that it was too dry (maybe my fault because I baked it without covering it with foil while baking), and too sweet. So, the second time I doubled the amount of milk, cut the brown sugar in half and covered it while baking. Turned out perfect for us.

Made this for the first time. I have to admit that I am not an oatmeal fan, but I know that it's healthy, so I was hoping to find a recipe that could make healthy taste good--this recipe did not disappoint!!! I used 3 tsp of cinnamon, 1.5 chopped Fiji apple, 3/4 cup walnuts, and left the butter the same. Since I wanted sweet but with less calories, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup granulated stevia. My son and I both loved it! Next time, I will have to double the recipe!!! :) Thanks for posting this!

We sure enjoyed this baked oatmeal. After scouring through my recipes trying to find my recipe I've had for years and failing to locate it , I settled on this one and I'm sure glad I did! It's my new fave!
The only change I made to it was instead of 2 teaspoons baking powder I used a teaspoon of baking powder and baking soda each. I  used dried cranberries, perhaps a tad more Cinnamon and served with homemade canned peach slices and half-and-half.  I always use unsalted real butter in my baking recipes – makes all the difference!  Such a yummy, filling breakfast or brunch ~ One that makes you feel a bit pampered after eating! At least I did!

Made with no altering and definitely not a breakfast dish.  Way too sweet for breakfast for my family.  I felt like I ate 8 cranberry oatmeal cookies for breakfast.  This would make a nice dessert dish  with maple syrup drizzled on top.

I made it exactly as written the first time.  Much to sweet, that is why I only gave it four stars.  The second time I made it, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar.   I also used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of Sunbutter in place of the butter.   This added protein and cut the fat in half and really added to the flavor!   We've been making it over and over.

Made this for the family to eat while I was cooking a big country breakfast.   Everyone loved it.  No one wanted to eat the other breakfast items I was preparing.  My son said it was the best baked oatmeal he'd ever eaten.  I messaged the recipe to his wife.

This is a great recipe but I switched 1/4 cup water for 1/4 of the melted butter. I think 3/4 cup brown sugar would be plenty.

Not bad, though I do find baked oatmeal is always so much drier than the stove-top method. I will make again, but will add more milk to make it creamier. And 30 minutes was all the bake time required.

We all loved this but I used half the amount of sugar called for.  I served it with maple syrup for those who wanted it sweeter. Yum yum.  There are so many ways to  tweek this.  Chopped apple?  Pecans? Currants? Chopped prunes?  Let your imagination run wild.  It's also perfect warmed in the microwave the next day!

As a mom of 4 young kids I LOVE that I could make this up all before the bake temp buzzer for the oven went off! The recipe is versatile which I appreciate, today I used pears and apples on hand and another time I did raisins. I make a batch and then bake 1/2 at a time for my kids. They think it's an oatmeal cookie for breakfast.

My husband loves to eat Oatmeal for breakfast everyday. He loves this dish so much, he can eat them twice a day. I made them twice a week with all kind of different fresh and dry fruits. This twist is my best hit though. I use 2/3 brown sugar instead of 1 cup. No butter instead I use 1 and 1/2 cup of apple sauce. It goes really good with the cinnamon. I add 1/2 cup of Blueberry. They can be fresh or dry. Here's my secret I add Orange zest, some Chia Seeds, Flax Seeds and some pecan or walnut. Enjoy guys.

I made with 1/2 c brown sugar and applesauce ipo butter. 
I used 2 c old-fashioned oatmeal and 1 c quick oats and about 1 1/2 c mixed fruit (dried cranberries, raisins, and frozen blueberries).
This cut into squares well.  Very versatile recipe, great for snacks and quick breakfasts. Thanks for posting.

Keep an eye on that baking time. I used a glass 13x9 pan and it was done (almost overdone) at 30 minutes. I followed the advice from other reviewers and subbed homemade applesauce for butter and reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. Super delicious.

With a taste of oatmeal with brown sugar and the consistency of granola -- it's an easy enough recipe to make for the week. A good change from the usual cereal I make in the morning.  

Strangely, looking at the other reviews about "sky-high calories", I'm reminded of the saying my grandparents used to tell me:  Eat like a King for Breakfast, a Prince for Lunch and a Pauper for Supper..."  Which is why I always eat to sustain when I start my morning.

As the recipe is, I gave it 4 stars because I don't like crunchy.  If I liked crunchy, I would have given it 5 stars.  I'm not sure what rolled oats are, so I used old fashioned oats (maybe they're the same thing), and I eat this warm with a little milk in the bowl with it and a little maple syrup on top.  I didn't use cranberries or any other fruit when I made this because I hate cranberries.

I've made something similar to this (called soaked oatmeal), but this recipe seemed a lot less complicated so I wanted to try it and I'm glad I did.  That recipe I have made in the past suggested eating it with milk and maple syrup (honey, or some other sweetener).  The other recipe was also NOT crunchy at all.  With that in mind, these are the changes I will make (or continue to make) in the future:

-use Old Fashioned or Quick oats, I will let it all soak in the refrigerator for at least an hour if not a whole night so that this won't be crunchy (maybe I will soak just the oats and milk, then add everything else to it later)

-add diced apple or applesauce to the mix

-eat with a little milk and maple syrup

-it doesn't make a lot, so I would probably double the recipe

This recipe had good flavor. I halved the recipe and used a little less than 1/2 cup of sugar. Next time I will try baking no more than 20 minutes to keep the dish more moist. A blend of butter and extra virgin coconut oil instead of all butter would also be a nice twist. My son who does not like oatmeal ate the majority of this. I might try to sneak some flaxseed into the next batch!

I make the basic recipe sometimes,but embellish I others.  I like to use some maple sugar sometimes. I vary the dried fruits and add nuts.  Dried apricots with pecans, apples with walnuts, blueberries or cherries with almonds.  We all love it

I did not have cranberries so I diced up one green apple and smashed one ripe banana. And added it to the mixture. Amazing!! Reminds me of the baked oatmeal I had in Lancaster. Next time I'll half the brown sugar. It's very sweet.

Halve the brown sugar. 3 tsp cinnamon. Soy instead of regular milk. 1/2 c applesauce vs butter. Raisins & walnuts or fresh/frozen fruit. Layer 1/2 c of desired fruit on bottom of pan to add moistness with 1/3 - 1/2 cup mixed in with the batter.  Serve with milk. Make muffins by adding 3/4 - 1 cup of flour to the batter.

My husband and I loved it !! I did make some changes to suit out dietary health needs. I used 1/3 c of splenda  brown sugar,  1/2 cup of smart balance spread instead of butter, 1 c of finely ground pecans, 1/2 c ground flax seed. Left out the dried cranberries.  Used fresh blueberries in bottom of a bowl, with baked oatmeal on top . Warm in microwave, drizzle with sugar-free maple syrup.

This was my first time baking oatmeal. I followed the directions exactly and it is just scrumptious with a little milk. A WAY better consistency than oatmeal from the stove top.  I might try a bit less sugar next time, but it's not overly sweet at all as is. My 3, 5, and 7 year old girls  love it.

I've made this several times now.  My kids (18, 15 and 14) love it.  Even my wife whom doesn't normally like oatmeal loves it!  

I changed it up just a bit. One time while making this, I ran short on brown sugar. I substituted the 1/4 cup I was short for 1/4 cup of pure maple syrup.  It added a very nice flavor & I have made it this was way ever since.

I like to serve it with a little warm milk added.

I made this exactly by the recipe, but halved it. It smelled delicious and had a good flavor, but it was a little dry and the rolled oats were just too chewy. I'm going to try it again with quick oats and with a bit more milk. I may add some chopped apples as well. With some adjustments, I think it could be very good.

Used raisins because that's what I had on hand.  Also cut the sugar in half which kept it a little sweet but healthier and less like a dessert.  Very dry. Probably wont make again.

I have several friends that are lactose intolerant so I substituted vegetable oil for the butter and almond milk for the milk.  I totally agree with the other reviewers in that to use a full cup of sugar would make it way too sweet.  I used only 1/3 of brown sugar and it was plenty.  Could have probably gotten away with 1/4 cup.  I also omitted the cranberries and just offered them on the side.  Everyone, including dairy-eaters, loved it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have not tried it as it is written.  Even with the modifications it was good.  I have had better baked oatmeal but for lactose-free it was very good--better than I would have expected for lactose-free.

For toppings, I offered cranberries, chopped pecans, brown sugar, and Bourbon Glazed Apples.  I did do the apples with butter though.  They were the bomb!  Perfect for the oatmeal.

I realized just before making this that we had steel cut oats instead of rolled oats, so I used this recipe but searched for steel cut recipes to determine oat:milk ratio. It's 1:2 so I ended up adding lots of milk and using a 9x13 and one smaller pan. Was excellent though and east to cut a peice for my toddler to eat like a cereal bar.

This was a quick, easy, and good way to make oatmeal for guests (when wanting to present something a little more special than just regular oatmeal with milk and sweetener). It was just a bit too heavy for our tastes; we liked it better with a bit less butter and sugar.
Unfortunately, since Allrecipes no longer allows the option of adding notes, I have to include my personal notes in my rating. Feel free to ignore the rest of this post.
Cut recipe in half for smaller crowd (2-4 people). For full recipe, use only 1/3 C butter and ¾ C sugar (mix of brown sugar and maple syrup).

This is a great recipe as written.  I do add walnuts or pecans for a little extra protein.

I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and substituted dried blueberries for cranberries.  Next time I would reduce sugar to 1/2 c. Also sprayed pan.

We really liked this for a change from breakfast tacos.  I made bowls up for the week and sent with milk for my husband's breakfasts.   Nice and easy on a busy day.

It was dry as some of the other reviewers stated.  Kind of cakey, which I really wasn't expecting.  Really nothing special, I will not make it again.

This was good.  Nothing to jump up and down about.  I love the simplicity of the recipe and that it's an alternative breakfast dish. I would make again but add almonds next time for more texture and nutmeg.  Also, all that sugar is certainly bad for one's health.  I used only half cup of sugar but next time I would use about slightly less a little more than 1/4 cup.

Loved it.  As recommended, I replaced 1/2 the butter with applesauce and cut sugar to 2/3 cup.  Will try 1/2 the sugar and homemade chunky applesauce next time.  Had some for lunch with some vanilla yogurt.  Planning to freeze leftovers in squares to pack in lunches.

My whole family love this recipe!!  Yummy as written but I usually use frozen berries instead of craisins.  When I want healthier I replace half of butter with applesauce and cut sugar in half.  We eat this at least twice a month for dinner with a crust-less quiche.  Great re-heated too.  I bake about 35-40 mins because I like the crisp edges.

Delightful! I'm not usually a fan of rolled oats oatmeal but this keeps a chewy texture to the oats. I recommend taking it down to 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I prefer the lighter sweetness. When my hubby requests this I add walnuts or pecans. If I have myself in mind, I throw blueberries and chia seeds in it. It's fantastic with a dollop of cream and preserves or pumpkin butter on top.

Loved and will be making again. 
sub low sugar vanilla almond milk for milk (can't have milk)
cut the vanilla (since it is in the milk)
sub applesauce for butter (have to watch sat.fats)
reduced brown sugar by half
wonderful :)
This time made with walnuts, dried pineapple & dated.  Wow! Wonderful.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe.  I added 1/4 cup chopped pecans and substituted 1/2 cup Brown Sugar Splenda for the brown sugar to cut down a little on the carbs.  Very tasty.  It's about 47 carbs for one serving with the Brown Sugar Splenda (based on 8 servings), so not exactly low carb but lower than with brown sugar (which would be about 59 carbs)!

I made this and couldn't wait to review it! It is delicious. I did make a few changes. I used 1/2 cup of homemade pear sauce instead of butter. I cut down brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also added pecans, and flax seeds. I omitted the cranberries. Very adaptable recipe. I love it and it will become a breakfast staple in our home. My three year old ate 5 pieces! I cut them into squares and they held together perfectly! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I normally don't like cooked oatmeal so I thought i'd try this recipe because of baking it instead. Loved it! Added some cooked Apple's to it instead of cranberries.

I also reduced the sugar to half.  Next time I would use use half butter and half coconut oil.  We used chopped apples instead of dried fruit to avoid more sugar. 

I actually intended this to be eaten as breakfast throughout the week so I baked it in a cupcake tin (12).  Spray with Pam if you try this.   They come out  just the right size to use for a single serving.  Just add milk and microwave for 1 minute. 

I did make my first batch with steel cut oats.  They are harder texture and would require more milk when reheating for a longer period of time.

This was a divine recipe!  I used instant oatmeal as that's all I had and it still tasted great! I will defiantly make this again sometime, Possibly with less sugar, and a bit of honey instead! Thanks!

This was easy and the texture came out so different from regular oatmeal.  I used raisins (what was on hand), almond milk and cut the sugar a bit but next time I'll use only 1/2 a cup.  Definitely a breakfast we'll be making regularly.

Delicious, easy to make, and not too sweet. We followed the recipe as written, except for substituting soy milk. It only needed 35 minutes to bake. This was really tasty served with warmed milk or half and half and fresh strawberries on top. Will definitely make this again - it would be great to serve at a brunch for guests.

This was Father's Day breakfast at our house this year.  We had just had baked oatmeal at a coffee shop in Madison, WI for the first time ever and fell in love with it.  So I made it here at home. After reading all the notes from those who had tried this recipe, I changed the recipe a little- 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup maple syrup instead of the 1 cup of sweetner.  I added a half cup of roasted pecans.  And for the fruit, I used a half cup of raisins and currants combined.  
Prior to filling the baking dish with the mixture, I sliced a banana and put a table spoon of butter in the baking dish and put that in the oven for about 10 minutes (I had gotten that idea from another recipe.)
The dish was outstanding.  When I make it next time- and there will be a next time- I'll do what I did this time- probably!

I topped it with fresh fruit and skipped the dried fruit.  A local restaurant serves it with a little bit of cream on the side to pour over the top if you choose.

I have been making a modified version of this recipe for years.  I only bake it 30 minutes at 350 degrees in an 8 x 8 pan.  I use 1/2 cup of sugar and one egg.  I sometimes add an extra 1/2 cup of milk or plain yogurt.  My family loves it.  Also, I add whatever fruit is on hand -- fresh, dry, or canned. I also replace the butter with oil.

This was a good basic recipe. I substituted half the butter with unsweetened applesauce and used 1/4 cup less sugar. I also added chocolate chips and coconut instead of cranberries.

First time making this at our house.  Followed the recipe for the most part this time.  We used Almond Milk instead of regular milk and used about half and half of dried cranberries and frozen blueberries.  We also added a handful of rough chopped pecans for more texture. Very good. A little rich so next time I will lighten up the meal with one egg and then one egg white, apple sauce instead of butter.

Amazing recipe just as written. I vary it somehow (dried fruit and/or fresh fruit, baking spices, flavorings) most everytime I make it but this recipe as written will get you there. A cold square of this oatmeal with yogurt is my favorite summer breakfast. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was delicious! The melted butter made the recipe. I don't like "wet" oatmeal so this was the perfect consistency. Loved it!

I substituted almond milk, eliminated the dried cranberries, and added (approx) 1/2 c. shredded coconut, 1/2 c. semi-sweet choc chips, and 1/4 c. pecans.  Delicious.

Made this recipe for the first time following most of Debby S.'s recommended changes with a little bit of my own:

3 cups of oats with flax seed, 
1/3 cup brown sugar, 
3 tsp. cinnamon, 
1/3 cup melted butter, 
1/4 cup apple sauce, 
1/2 cup chopped pecans, 

Only baked for 30 mins at 350 and it turned out perfect. Goes great with a little bit of milk (don't drown it like cereal) and topped with a drizzle of warm REAL maple syrup (here in Canada you better be using the real stuff!).

Great but I made a few changes.  I used half the sugar, quick oats and 1/4 cup coconut oil instead of the butter.  They were great cut into squares for my husbands breakfast at work. Much, much cheaper than the boxed bars!

love this versatile recipe! Although - I generally cut the sugar to much less - 1/2 to 1/3 cup of sugar otherwise it is too sweet for my tastes. I usually mix this up Saturday night and put it in the fridge overnight. Then Sunday morning pop it in the oven before I get in the shower. Such a great Sunday morning breakfast! My kids love it! =)

I made some revisions like some of the other reviewers suggested:  1/2 Cup Brown Sugar (instead of a cup), 1/4 Cup Applesauce + 1/4 Cup butter, Raisins instead of Cranberries and I added chopped up pecans (about 1/4 Cup)and about 1/2 of a peeled, chopped up apple.  I also used Coconut-Almond milk (from Costco) instead of milk. This turned out to be a great 'make ahead' Father's day breakfast. All I had to do was pop it in the oven for 25 mins in he morning.  Yum!

I cut the sugar in half, doubled the cinnamon, added vanilla protien powder & wild blueberries (instead of craisins), and used coconut oil. Among a couple other slight variances.

Super yummy! I reduced the sugar by half because we were serving this with yogurt and fruit, and topped half with shaved coconut and pear slices. It was a winner in our house. I may make another pan and save it for school mornings...if I can keep my family away from it!

I figured 1 cup of milk wan't enough liquid for 3 cups of oats so added another cup -will add at least another 1/2 cup next time I make this recipe. Omitted the sugar and will reduce the butter to 1/4 cup.  Baked in an 8 inch square pan - this recipe definitely makes more than 4 servings - unless one is doing farm work

Easy and delicious...We use 1/4 cup brown sugar...I sometimes add apples for my husband and also like to throw in flax and chia seeds. Keeps well as leftovers for breakfast for the week...we serve it hot with milk poured over it!

I split the recipe in half as I only had 1 1/2 cups of oats. I used a little bit less brown sugar than the recipe called for and I added a little more vanilla extract. I used 1/2 cup dried cranberries and I also added 1/2 chopped walnuts. I baked it in a bread pan (I think like 4x9 or 4x8) for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly golden brown and nice and moist. It was kind of hard to cut because it was so crumbly but it tasted awesome! It had the crunchiness of the walnuts I added and the tartness of the cranberries mixed with the sweet brown sugar. It was very flavorful and delicious!

Very good, the second time I made it, I used half a cup of applesauce in place of the butter, half a cup of honey and 1 TBS molasses in place of the the brown sugar and half a cup of milk instead of a whole cup. It was still delicious!!!

I like this recipe more than another one I tried for baked oatmeal.  I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a couple tablespoons less butter.  I did add a small shredded apple.  Next time I will decrease the milk to 3/4 cup and use a 9 inch square pan so it will be thicker.

First, while I included all of the ingredients listed, I did add a few things to make this more to my taste, and my review is based on the outcome of the base recipe plus my modifications. But with that said, this is a great recipe. 
I mashed 2 bananas and then mixed in the milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla.  I used the full 1/2 cup of butter.  In a separate bowl, I mixed together 3 heaping cups of old fashioned oats, 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar (with a little extra), cinnamon, powder, and salt.  I added that too the banana/butter mixture and then stirred in fresh blueberries and dried cranberries. (I didn't really measure...just dumped until it looked like a good amount.) I also added a few chopped pecans to one side of the pan.  I baked it at 350 for 35 minutes, and it turned out perfectly moist with the ability to refrigerate and reheat later.  I may add some half and half to my next bowl.  
Thanks for a fantastic recipe.  It was a lot of fun to see what else I could do with it!

Wonderful recipe! I made healthy adjustments as follows:
Oats-used old-fashioned oats
Butter-cut in half & substituted other half with Greek yogurt. 
Milk-used unsweetened almond milk with vanilla added. Upped quantity to 1 1/2 cups and decreased vanilla by teaspoon. 
Cranberries-used small gala apple, diced. Removed some skin & kept some. 
Everyone at work loved it so much! My hubby even recommended it as dessert with ice cream. Enjoy!

I eat oatmeal everyday.  So I thought this recipe was a 4 1/2 star.  My wife and youngest son thought it was too crumbly for them.  They rated it a 3 star.  I now eat this for breakfast four times a week.  Best way I know to eat your heart healthy oatmeal as frequently as possible and really look forward to it.

Very good - note to self - substituted applesauce for the butter, but need to add more liquid - a bit dry.   Apples are a great alternative to cranberries.  Great flavors!!!

Commenters said 1 cup was too much sugar, so instead of using 1 cup of packed sugar, I used 1 cup loose brown sugar. It was the perfect sweetness.

This is a family favorite at our house. It's really easy to make variations on it by adding different dried fruits, nuts, wheat germ, etc. It's a pretty big recipe, but that's OK because the leftovers are good too, so you can actually get a couple of breakfasts out of it.

Very Yummy!  I used blueberries and raspberries.  I also added a dash of nutmeg and used Coconut Sugar instead of brown sugar.

Loved it, but could have backed off a little on the sugar.  I added 2 chopped up apples before baking and served in a bowl with a few tablespoons of cold milk.  This recipe served at least 8 in my house.

I love this recipe and make it at least twice a month.  The only change I make is to stir whatever fruit I have on hand into it.  I've added chopped apples, chpped pears, raisins and blueberries into different batches.  We eat it warm the first day and then cold, cut into bars until it's gone.

Absolutely Delicious!!! I followed one persons recommendation and added 1/2 cup applesauce instead of butter and vanilla almond milk for regular milk. This made it a healthier version that you would never be able to tell!

Someone said that this recipe is adaptable, and they are right.  I suggest you make this as is the first time and then you can try different changes along the way.  This morning I made this with a few changes that I thought I'd share.  I did as some suggested and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and used coconut oil instead of butter.  I also substituted coconut milk for the milk.  I also omitted the cinnamon and cranberries. I'm sure shredded coconut would have been great in this.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing BLANCHL!

I don't really like oatmeal but I've always had it because of its nutritional value. This one however... YUM! I cut down the sugar and butter, though, to half and used skim milk. It was very good, moist and the vanilla: fantastic. My hubby likes it a little sweeter so he added a bit of honey on top while we ate it. It was really really good. Definitely will be making it again.

This is a great base recipe from which  I like to launch into  number of variations.  I use  a variety of fruits both fresh and dried along with supplemental grains such as flax and wheat germ.  Adding toppings such as pecan etc. causes it to border on dessert.

I live in the heart of Amish country, and this recipe was delicious! Moist, yet not heavy, a perfect breakfast food. I served it with milk, and topped with nuts.  The changes I made for my family in the recipe was reduced brown sugar by 1/3, and increased oats by 1 cup. Loved it!

This recipe is AMAZING! Sweet and crispy. We made this once for a book club group and they absolutely LOVED it. The only downside of this recipe is the time it takes to make it, but i will say that it is worth the time. If you live in a higher altitude like me, its best to add 1/4 cup more flour.  I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I do

I halved the sugar, added 2 TBSP flax, omitted the dried cranberries and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter. My son and I loved this oatmeal! He likes it warmed up in the morning before school. I make it the night before and then keep it in the fridge. It makes a great quick breakfast! It was like cake. My husband said it would be good with cool whip on top!

I left out the craisens and halved the brown sugar.  I also used applesauce instead of butter to make it healthier.  It was SOOO good!  A great way to get my kids to eat fiber and a easily portable healthy snack.  I will probably make it in an 8x8 next time as the 9x13 made it quite thin and it was done after only 30 minutes.

I make this every weekend. It is easy to make and so delicious. Like other reviewers, I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and use coconut sugar as it is unrefined. It is still pretty sweet! I may try reducing even further or using 1/4 cup honey instead. Love how versatile this is!

Delicious and easy to throw together! Next time I might try adding less brown sugar and see what happens. It's delicious as-is, but might be too much sugar first thing in the morning. You can throw in whatever dried fruit you have on hand. I used a mix of blueberries and cranberries.

Fantastic as is but I upped the milk by 1/2 cup then added 3/4 c slivered almonds, 1/2 c flax seed and a cubed skinless medium apple.  Even better if you use a power dried berry blend.  Another alternative I did was adding pumpkin puree, nutmeg, chopped pecans and chopped dates.  Very nice for a fall version.  I make a pan of this every week and then put it in a big bowl in the fridge. Scoop a little every day and nuke it for 30 seconds.  Nutritious, healthy breakfast every day.  Love it!  Everyone at my work makes it now too!

This was fabulous! Reduced the sugar, added a little applesauce. Used strawberries and milk chocolate chips with no dried fruit but I think it's infinitely adaptable. Instead of mixing the butter in, I melted about 1/4 c of butter and drizzled it on top of the casserole right before baking. I think this was plenty of butter. Delicious and filling!

Unanimous 5 stars - hubby and my 6 and 8 yr olds.  I reduced the sugar and used applesauce in lieu of the melted butter.  Super easy and very good.

This was incredible and easy to make! I was expecting a dry bar. I slightly underbaked and ended up w/ a warm crumbled delight. The only change was that I used fruit bits instead of cranberries because it's all I had on hand. Liked by both adults & kids.   I put a little Vanilla almond milk over it to eat.  2 thumbs up.

The first time I made this dish, I did the substitution of apple sauce for oil and changed nothing else. It was quite tasty, especially the second day, but on the first day I found the texture with all rolled oats to be a bit too chewy (that did improve by the next day). 

This time I made it with half quick oats and half rolled oats and it was just right. I also substituted half of the sugar with Splenda with no change in taste, making this a bit healthier than written.

Great recipe and easy to make. Raisins or cranberries work great with it. And BTW, it didn't come out too soft either time and could be cut up into bars for a take-along breakfast.

Made this for my boyfriend and I, and didn't know what to expect. Baked oatmeal is something his mom always made for him so I was worried that it wouldn't measure up, but thankfully he loved it and asked if it was his mom's recipe! I only made a couple changes, I didn't have cinnamon on hand so I added a little bit of maple syrup and I used walnuts instead of cranberries. It was very decadent.

Family loved this recipe. Was first introduced to baked oatmeal at a little menonite bakery in South Bend, IN. I substituted applesauce for the butter and only used 3/4 Cups brown sugar. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and allspice. Spices worked great together. To eat it, I crumble it in a bowl, add milk and warm it in the microwave for 1 minute. Great morning breakfast.

I made a few changes even though the original is yummy.  I cut the sugar in half and also substituted applesauce and a little olive oil for the butter.  Like others, I used a mixture of raisens and cranberries.  I found though the dried canberries do add a tart flavor to balance the sweetness.

This is wonderful!  I lower the brown sugar to 3/4 cup because my boys like to add a spoonful of syrup to the bowl when they eat it.  This is great for making and then storing in the fridge so that you have breakfast ready to go for a few days.  Just heat it up and add a little milk.

This is a HIT at my house. 
I have tweaked it for our needs:
*I used Old Fashioned oats--I found it is best if you let them soak in the milk for at least 30 min. before assembling the rest of the ingredients.
*I have cut back on the sugar by 1/4 cup.  It is still plenty, especially if you are adding fruit.  
*We have tried fresh sliced peaches or apples and we have tried dried cherries (omit cinnamin and change vanilla to 1/2 t. of almond extract.
* I love that this microwaves well the folloring morning!

I made two small adjustments to this recipe. I used coconut oil in place of the butter and I reduced the sugar by half, thinking that if I'm drizzling this with syrup, I don't want it too sweet. But after tasting it without syrup, I found it to be perfectly sweet for my preferences (I'm a sweet tooth) and flavorful enough not to need syrup at all. It was light, fluffy and crumbly, kind of like a very soft granola, but tasting just like a bowl of oatmeal should. All it needs is a handful of nuts tossed in for further nutritional value. Great recipe!

I love this recipe. I make it about twice a week and my whole family loves it too. I swapped the cranberries for raisins and also added walnuts.           It is  so yummy!

Very tasty.  Everyone of us loved it.  I did use only 1/2c brown sugar and that seemed perfect.  For our group this fed 2 adults and 3 teen boys and was just exactly enough.

This was beyond great.  Been auditioning breakfast recipes for wedding guests.  I used chopped dates in place of cranberries as that's what I had. Absolutely delicious.  Wedding guests will love them and I'll be free to enjoy the meal with them.  I'll make them again.  Maybe even in a jelly roll pan to get a crunchy healthy breakfast bar.

My opinion is that the amount for two of the ingredients from the original recipe is off.  I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar (unpacked) and only 6 tablespoons of butter rather than the whole stick (half cup).  With those changes, I thought the recipe was delicious.  It tasted to me like a moist granola bar.  I cut it into squares and had it with a cup of tea.  Very delicious!

This recipe is great for someone looking for a quick, hearty breakfast.  Instead of the dried cranberries, I threw in fresh strawberries.  Next time, I will either run the fruit through the food processor or use fresh applesauce to get a little better flavor integration.  I would also half or eliminate the salt, but I have been accused of preferring "bland" food.

Great as it is, but I don't always have dried cranberries on hand. So I have substitued 1 chopped apple and  a 1/4 cup raisins. Since i am not suppose to have a lot of sugar , I substituted Splenda Brown sugar, the last time i made it I decided to experiment with flax seed. Substituted 3/4 cup of milled flax seed for 1/4 cup of the butter.  It came out great did seem to be done sooner. took it out in 32 minutes as it was starting to get browned on top. Love it both ways just healthier with less fat and sugar. I make 4 servings out of it as I am suppose to have 3/4 cups of oatmeal for breakfast to help reduce my cholestrol.  Great basic recipe !

This was so good! I followed the recipe except for substituting dried cherries for cranberries. My husband raved about it and we both wish I had not halved the recipe! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is great. I can't wait to try other additions. I made the common tweaks, cut sugar in half (not packed), added a few packets of stevia for some extra sweetness, applesauce instead of oil/butter, and blueberries and pecans instead of cranberries. It was really good, kids liked it and I will be making it again soon. I really like the way it is solid and not so messy to eat, but still the same healthy oatmeal we would normally eat for breakfast. I saw how somebody added flour and made muffins with it, I can't wait to try that too!

Made your recipe with a few adjustments: I used it as a topper on frozen fruit (approx 4 cups fruit) I used cherries, raspberries, and saskatoons mixed with 2 tsp cornstarch and 1 cup applesauce as a base. I Substituted sugar for 1/2 cup honey, soy milk, and 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil instead of butter, I also added 1 tsp ground ginger to the dry ingredients, 1/4 cup chopped pecans. Great breakfast for the kids!

I like to mix up the recipe with raisins, apples, pecans, etc.  Everyone in my family likes to eat their baked oatmeal different...some pour milk on it while others like maple syrup...and some like it just the way it is.  

Next time I make it, i'm going to layer it with cream cheese and strawberry preserves.  Was going to do that today, but I didn't have cream cheese.  :(

This is a great base to experiment with. I used the original recipe taking into consideration some of the modifications - 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 egg and 2 egg whites, applesauce instead of butter, then added chopped up apples and fresh cranberries (put cranberries in saucepan with 3/4 cup water, 1/2 cup white sugar, and lemon zest. Bring to boil and cook until all cranberries pop and mixture thickens up - about 15 minutes.) Once that cools down fold it into your oatmeal mixture before putting in baking dish. Cook regular time. The cranberries and lemon zest bring it up a notch!

I make twice before commenting to be sure I did not mess something up the first time.  I found this to be very dry and hard to serve a 13 month old.  I wanted something more think and moist like regular oatmeal I guess.  Good flavor just too dry for me.

I love this recipe and have made it a few times now--it's a perfect solution to my on-the-go breakfast needs. I altered the recipe a bit like many others--used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce. I added raisins the first time I baked it, and dried currants the second time--both were great! Easy to cut in to squares and freeze for use later.

Just made this for the first time last night!  It is now a new family favorite!  I used applesauce instead of butter. I didn't have dried cranberries on hand so I grabbed a handful of frozen berry medley and threw it in. JUST DELICIOUS!! The texture is really like an oatmeal bread and that's just how I like it! The hubby added a splash of milk to his bowl. All 4 kids gobbled it right up!  Need to double the recipe next time!!  This is a keeper!!

Awesome recipe! Much better than some recipes that end up being to dry.  I didn't have cranberries so I added two large apples.  Topped with a couple tablespoons of vanilla yogurt!  Delicious!

First try at baked oatmeal, and followed recipe except added some raisins instead of all cranberries. I didn't reduce butter/sugar etc and didn't think it was too sweet. I did pull it out of the oven 7 min early, because i was unsure what the consistency of this was supposed to be. For our first try I put a dash of milk in the bowl with our baked oatmeal, but I am not sure it needed it. I think I will like it without the milk for the next bowl :). My baked oatmeal turned out to be a damp crumble, not too dry and crispy, not too wet.

We make it for breakfast, and sub the cranberries for whatever fruit we have on hand or chocolate chips and cinnamon.  Serve with some milk poured over it if it is too dry.  Yum.

I made this the other day as baked oatmeal squares because I was looking for something for my husband to take on the go to work. I took other reviewers advice and cut back to 1/2 cup brown sugar, used apple sauce instead of butter & frozen blueberries instead of cranberries. I thought it came out pretty good, nothing special but it was good. My husband thought it lacked flavor & thought it needed more brown sugar or add the butter in it. It was however spongy in texture lol! Other than that I will probably make them again but I will mess around with the recipe to get it to taste a little better, it has potential!

Delicious even without the sugar.  I make this every Saturday, but usually switch up the fruit.  I use a smaller pan and cover the bottom with blueberries.  I've tried blueberries and bananas, pears and blueberries, and strawberries and bananas.  I'm convinced that you can't mess this recipe up!

I added flour (ratio 1:3, flour:oats) to make this recipe more cake-like. We put a little milk at the bottom of our bowl too. Great cozy breakfast.

Excellent healthy breakfast or snack, with substitutions. Use applesauce in place of the butter, and only 1/3 - 1/2 cup of brown sugar. 1 cup is way too much. I added extra cinnamon and have used vanilla soy or almond milk instead of milk and vanilla extract. 40 minutes of baking time is too long if you don't want it to be too dry. I prefer to bake it in an 8x8 pan for 25-30 minutes, very moist and hearty. If you love oatmeal you'll like this too!

I would cut the brown sugar in half if you do not add the cranberries; the tartness from the berries must cut down on the sweetness.  Otherwise wonderful! Exactly what I wanted in terms of consistency, crunchiness and flavor.

This was a little too dry for my taste--and apparently my 3 year old too.  He asked me to pour milk over it.  Maybe shorter cooking time or smaller pan would have made it better.

Yummy!  I cut the cranberries a little and added some apple and pecans.  Since it was just for me I cut the recipe in half and only baked it for 30 minutes.  Nice soft texture and crunchy around the edges and top.  Tasty and filling particularly on a cold winter morning.

This was pretty good!  The only thing I changed was that I halved the brown sugar and used half butter and half applesauce, instead of all butter (while better with all butter, just trying to eat healthier around here).  And I swapped out cranberries for raisins, my favorite.  I did find that the cooking time was a bit long for me.  I took it out at 35 minutes and probably should have a few minutes earlier.  Next time, I do think I'll add some chopped apple...my favorite in baked oatmeal.

This one-bowl-wonder is a staple at our house. It's so easy- just stir everything together- and it bakes up so delicious and pretty. Nice to serve to company or to simply reheat for busy mornings before school. The adjustments I have stuck with (though the original is wonderful!) are: 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 butter, 1/4 c. applesauce. Thanks for sharing!

I don't know what happened with my batch. It sounded soooo good and smelled soooo good cooking but when we served it, well it was dry as dirt. My son drank at least 3 glasses of milk to get one serving down. I even double checked the recipe and baking time. Think we'll go back to regular oatmeal...

I tried this recipe using regular oatmeal and felt it was way too chewy.  I am going to try it again with quick oats. The flavor was good but the oats didn't work for us.

I also recently found a similar recipe for Baked Oatmeal, not being a fan of conventional oatmeal this twist appealed to me. Served with a homemade blackcurrant syrup it was GREAT.  Also think a person could try many fruit variations for a change.

A little dry for me (I was looking for a more custard-like consistency), but still really good!  I added dried cherries and that really pushed it to a new level.

Even the kids love this one. I add a little extra oatmeal, and change up the cranberries with coconut, nuts or apples.  I omit the brown sugar and add a sugar substitute and it is still delish!

I was using this to make a hand held alternative to oatmeal for my toddler to feed himself. So, needless to say, the 1 cup of sugar had to go. I used 1/4 cup and 1/2 c of fruit puree (had leftover fruit salad). This was plenty sweet for us! I also omitted the butter and used 1T of vegetable oil. A great basic recipe for a healthy morning breakfast!

Very sweet but good taste and easy to make.  I cut down on both sugar and butter.

This is a good healthy recipe.  You could eat it like a bread, but it was best warmed with ice cream or a little milk or whipped cream.  Breakfast, snack or dessert!

It was tasty. I used the full cup sugar and 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon.  Maybe the extra cinnamon made it a little dry.  I will look for a different recipe.

The first time I made this, I used half the recommended sugar. It would have been way too sweet with the full amount of sugar. It was amazing, but I didn't want to make it frequently with all that butter. So the second time I took out the butter and sugar entirely and added about 3/4 C unsweetened applesauce. It was a little fluffier and plenty sweet. We ate it with fresh blueberries and just a little bit of milk or cream.

This is my first attempt at making baked oatmeal. My family loved it. We added frozen strawberries - about a cup or so and it was fantastic. A great recipe for you to try!

I used coconut milk instead of milk and used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also pureed 3 small apples  in my vita-mix instead of using a 1/2/ of butter and put in 1/4 of butter instead. Gives it more fiber and helps reduce the fat. So delicious!! I took out the dried fruit as to tailor to whole family by topping with whatever fruit you desire! A little milk or coconut milk poured on top is amazing. Oh yeah! The more spice the better, I put 3 heaping teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 2. What a great satisfying treat instead of the usual breakfast routine!!

I made this last year on Christmas morning, and the family loved it so much I'll be making it again this year.  Not too crunchy or too soft.  We ate it with milk in the bottom of our bowls.  Yum!

My family really enjoyed this!  I reduced the brown sugar by 1/3 cup and it was plentifully sweet.  I used my pampered chef, clay 9 x 13 and it cooked in about 25 minutes.  Even my teenager and her friends went back for seconds and she ate it the next morning for breakfast! Thanks for sharing!

I made this in a dutch oven while camping, and I will now be making it every other week!  I subbed 1/2 the butter with applesauce and I used re-hydrated fruit from the previous breakfast.  I think I will re-hydrate the fruit each time so the oatmeal doesn't get too dry, or add fresh or canned fruit. And, I added 1/4 cup flax seed meal, and 1/2 cup wheat bran.  To compensate for the extra dry ingredients, I added on more egg and some more milk.

I really didn't know what to expect, but this is good!  My husband likes it too, and he's not so much of an oatmeal guy.  I made it just as the recipe said, no alterations.  It's sweet but not too sweet and the dried cranberries are soooo good.

Wonderful recipe! Put in about 1/2 cup frozen blueberries instead of cranberries and it tasted great! Next time I will try with half the sugar to make it a bit less sweet.

I substitute applesauce for the oil, and whatever fresh fruit I have on hand for the cranberries (blueberries work great). I make a pan every week and my family loves it.

So good!  I agree it tastes like a cookie!  I used half Splenda brown sugar & half regular Splenda, 2% milk, light margarine and I added chopped pecans.  I spooned it over plain fat free yogurt (which was ok) but tomorrow morning I'll just serve it in a bowl with some milk and warm it.  Don't skip the cranberries (I used craisins) -they really make this dish!  UPDATE: I warmed it with milk and it was good but very sweet.  I've found the our favorite way of eating it is just cold out of the fridge with nothing else.  I just give the kids a little baggie with some chunks and they love it -- they especially look for bites with the cranberries!

This is a great recipe.  I make it often when we have house guests.  The only thing I would change is to make the dish hold together a little more, so you could eat it more like a cake or bread.  It falls apart easily.

Fabulous!  I didn't quite have 3 cups oatmeal left, so I slightly scaled down the recipe.  I also added in about a cup of frozen mixed berries instead of the cranberries and used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c applesauce.  My kids (3 and 1 1/2) inhaled it and my husband and I weren't far behind.  One batch was enough for all of us with generous helpings.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This is great to eat as a snack or for breakfast.  I halved the brown sugar and added a diced apple.  Due to dairy and egg allergies, I used one banana in place of the egg and applesauce instead of butter.  Turns out moist and smells wonderful!

I really wasn't sure what to expect, but after eating one square of this, I had to go back for another. These are warm and comforting. Very yummy. I can't wait to try them in the morning with some half and half.

I have made this recipe three times, and my six children (and picky husband) all love it.  We have substituted dried cherries or diced apples for the cranberries. I make this in the evening and refrigerate overnight. Makes mornings easier.

Yummmy! I made this recipe tonight for a snack but I added 1 cup of mashed bananas in, 1 cup light brown sugar instead of regular, 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice along with the 2 tsp. of cinnamon, and also 1 cup of very vanilla soymilk. OMG was it good! It was like home-made banana bread but oatmeal! =D

Thought these where just okay.  I ended up cutting into bars, wrapping each in plastic wrap and freezing.  Re-warmed them for a quick breakfast.  I could see where this would be a good addition to a brunch, someone may be interested in a bit of a more healthy choice.

Dang,these were good.  I added walnuts and eliminated the cranberries - I'll try freezing the leftovers and taking them for breakfast.  Good enough for company brunch.  I hope to modify them into something a little healthier, but I always think it's only fair to try a recipe as close to the original as possible.

This is so yummy! I left out the cranberries and then we sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top.

I made this for my husband and I for a weekend special breakfast and it was loved by both of us.  I changed the amount for 4 instead of 8 and we enjoyed this breakfast for several mornings.  Would be a great breakfast for family on holidays.  Loved it!

Great recipe! I was looking for one like mom makes and used to serve in her Cafe and this is pretty much it (only she always used raisins!)...I know she got it from the PA Amish country as well. I miss eating it, though, living in the UK, so obviously quite a ways from the family and I'm not a big fan of regular oatmeal. This recipe hit the spot, though (even though I discovered I'm out of vanilla *shock*horror*), so thanks for posting!

All week I was looking forward to baking this for a Saturday breakfast, but I was a little disappointed with how it turned out.  It was just ok.  My kids didn't eat it, so my husband and I had lots of leftovers.  It is VERY filling, a little goes a long way.  I only made it once, so perhaps I did something wrong.  But for the time and calories, I didn't think it was worth it.  I rather make a pot of oatmeal the regular way and sprinkle brown sugar on it for the family and splenda for me.

Just OK. I'm willing to try it again with regular sugar next time. Didn't have an appetizing color. Maybe because of the brown sugar, maybe the cinnamon -I'm not quite sure. The texture was off, as others have said. I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk in the morning just before I put it in the oven and it still was a little too dry for my taste. I added a little milk to my bowl, but I gues I just like my oatmeal creamier than is ended up. I'll make some suggested adjustments and we'll see how it goes next time.

I really enjoyed this.  I used Splenda brown sugar (1/2 cup) and probably could have cut back a bit.  I'd also cut back on the cinnamon a bit.  The cranberries made it delicious, and I added some chopped walnuts (very fine chop, mixed some in and sprinkled some on top) which gave it a nice crunch.  Serve it warm in a bowl with a little milk!

Delicious baked oatmeal. I made a half recipe and reduced the butter even more. Eaten for breakfast with milk poured over the top and glazed bacon on the side!

This tastes great, but seemed a bit dry to me.  I made it the night before & baked it the next morning.  Maybe the oatmeal soaked up too much of the liquid overnight. I'm not sure.  We just put some in a bowl & added milk to it.  It was fine that way.  Cranberries are a nice touch.  Might add some walnuts or pecans next time.

Very good, but really sweet and more like a dessert than a breakfast food.  I used raisins rather than cranberries, just because of my personal preference.  The serving sizes are very generous, and even though I halved the recipe for just two of us, there is plenty left over.

I made a big batch of this one Saturday morning and everyone really liked it! It's a good warm and cozy meal for a rainy weekend day! It needed to cook it a little longer than 40 min.

I make oatmeal every day but get tired of having to stand over the stove for ten minutes while it cooks.  This recipe is a great compromise!  I used a 12 ounce can of reduced fat evaporated milk in place of skim and cut the brown sugar in half (it's still plenty sweet).  It reheats very well, even after a couple of days, and is as filling as a bowl of regular oatmeal.  Thanks!

I would not make this again.  It was crumbly, so we tried it in a bowl with milk as someone else suggested and it still didn't taste right.

My family loved this, for breakfast and even for a dessert! I am going to be making this alot! It did come out a little crumbly but I figured I'd  add a little more milk the next time. I will be making this for dessert today and adding apples to it. A little bit of Reddi-whip and your all set.

My nine year old loves this, two year old loves it if I pour milk over it.  I can see it would be easy to add raisins or other dried fruits.  Wish it was a little lower in calories and fat, maybe I will replace butter with applesauce and see how it turns out.  Thanks for this recipe!

I grew up with this... it is so yummy.  I wouldn't change a thing, but if you don't have brown sugar on hand, you can substitute white sugar and can even lessen the amount.  It still tastes good!

I've made this several times now; the family loves it.  I've changed some amounts to suit our tastes:  one third cup of butter and brown sugar, 1 and a half cups milk, 1 tsp. baking powder. Good recipe, you can vary it with different additions.

This baked oatmeal was excellent.  Be warned, however, that it is not very sweet.
