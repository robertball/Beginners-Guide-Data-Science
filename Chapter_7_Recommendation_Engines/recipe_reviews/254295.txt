I used the cupcake variation, increased the spices of cloves & nutmeg to 1/8 teaspoon, and added 1/8 teasp ginger since this is pumpkin pie cheesecake . Used my 11 silicon cupcake  cups & baked 49 mins when a knife  inserted in center came out clean.  Made it all in  the same  food processor I used to grind walnuts, sugar & melted butter that I just wiped clean before mixing up the creamcheese batter.  Quick, easy clean up  & sooo good.  I had  two for dessert , hubby had three calling them amazing.  Gluten free, too!  Will make these  again and again especially for the holidays!

Great taste but what do you do with the rest of the pumpkin and sour cream.  Seems like a waste if you don't need it for anything else.

I made it with a graham cracker crust instead of walnut's due to people with food allergies and it was a big hit.

I made a couple modifications due to not having graham crackers.  I used gingersnap cookies and pecans as the crust and added caramel sauce on top and they turned out simply amazing.  I had my own pumpkin pie spice and used 1/2 tsp for it.  They were sooo good.  I used regular muffin tin and it gave me 12 instead of the 24.

This is out of this world good and so ridonkulously easy to make. Pumpkin pie and cheesecake are my hubby's two favorite desserts, and I wanted to have a great dessert to go along with our special anniversary dinner. I searched, and voila! He loved them, and so did I! The best part? They taste even better the next day! I agree with those who said they thought the cakes weren't cooked completely at 20 minutes, but once they cooled were perfect! Don't overcook these.

They were a big hit at Thanksgiving! I made it based on the recipe except I made the crust pecan based. I think next year Iâ€™ll use Lorna Doon crust.

I'm not a fan of everything pumpkin but I loved this one. The walnut crust really makes the dessert. Next time I might try with pecans.

This recipe, as is, made 12 using 1 cupcake tin.  They looked beautiful.  The cheesecake was light.  I substituted pecans instead of walnuts, just because we prefer them and also used brown sugar instead of white.  Topped with whipping cream.  I'll make these again as everyone gobbled them up!

These were excellent! I made them last weekend and my husband ate six of them in one sitting. I brought some to work as well and got big thumbs-up all the way around. They were very easy to make, too. The only deviation from the recipe was that I used Cool Whip rather than Reddy-wip as I couldn't find Reddy-wip in my grocery store. So delicious! I'll be making a lot of these in the months to come.

I made 12 med. muffin sized ones-only about an inch thick including the crust which I made out of graham crackers. Didn't rise at all and was a lot darker from the pumpkin than the picture  which makes it look to me like there should have been some milk or cream. They were well done in 20 mins. By 40 min. probably would have been rocks! Taste is just OK.

I had too much batter left so made an additional 6 regular size cheesecakes with a graham cracker crust. As  per recipe, these were really delicious with the RediWhip on top. 4stars just because of the amount of time and left over batter.
