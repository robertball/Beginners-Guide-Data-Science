Delicious alternative to the original unhealthy recipes! I took it one step furthur and make my own 'healthier' crust: 
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour (OR 1/2 cup pastry flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat all purpose flour)
1/4 tsp Kosher salt
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
Mix together until just blended. Press into pie plate with fingers until an even layer is formed.

It needs to be mentioned that the Quiche should be put on the 2nd rack level of your stove. I had it at mid level and the cooking time wasn't enough. Once I moved it, it cooked wonderfully. Also be aware of the crust you are using. Mine was a bit sweet. Frozen crust don't work well either as there's just too much moisture in the overall end product..resulting in a very soggy crust. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'm making my own crust. Sadly, this was so good that three people ate it all in one sitting. That kind of defeats the purpose.

I substituted 4 eggs for the egg substitute, 6 pieces of largely chopped bacon for the ham, cheddar cheese for the mozzerella about 1/2 cup milk for the condensed milk. I also made a homemade pie crust. It looks wonderful. I omitted cooking the onions in oil; I cooked them in water in the microwave. I did not layer the ingredients, I just mixed them all together and put them in the pan.

Delicious! This was as good as a restaurant quiche and much better for you. I only used half the ham because 1/2 pound seemed to much and I used four eggs instead of the egg substitute because this was for my family and I prefer not to use 'diet' stuff instead of real.  Next time I'll add a little more scallions because I love their flavor but this was so good!

Loved this recipe!  I can't wait to make this again!

I used four eggs as other suggested & added some diced zucchini to the green onions.

I used a frozen but thawed crust- it did not get quite done in the middle.  Next time I will pre-bake the crust a little and brush the crust with egg to help brown it.

Mainly, I do not believe 325 deg is hot baking temp for quiche.  I followed directions but then baked an additional 20 min at 400 deg.  Other quiche recipes bake at 375-400 degrees, so next time I will  bake it from the beginning in that range. 

I'm so happy to have found a quiche recipe that doesn't use heavy cream. Thanks Becky!

This is one of our family regular rotations. I’ve made it multiple times including teenagers waiting for their hardworking contractor father to finish a project at our house and professional chefs. While the chefs knew there was no cream, they thought it was first class. The teenagers, who had never had quiche, after eating my spare ( I always make two) asked if there was more (lol).

My favourite version includes half a small onion chopped and cooked in olive oil, 3 oz of high quality smoked ham, and 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese (OK I cheat a bit) and 7 oz reduced fat milk (1%).  Becky’s cooking time keeps the filling custard moist not the typically rubbery filling that passes for quiche.

I use a frozen crust and carefully follow the package directions to prick the crust with a fork then bake until lightly brown before filling. Perfect, crisp crusts every time.

Thanks Becky for a great recipe!

Really delicious. I ended up using an egg white only substitute, and though it was a little moist for the pie crust it was very delicious. Will definitely be making it again

I used 4 eggs as recommended by others (didn't have egg substitute), chopped up some leftover cooked broccoli, used light mozzarella, and added a little cheddar. Nice flavor. Only issue was that I used a deep dish pie crust (all I had on hand) so it was thinner than I would have liked, but no fault with the recipe as written.

Made this 2 days ago for Brunch. I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella cheese and regular milk instead of FFBT evaporated milk. Oh, and I made my own pastry crust. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!

Loved this quiche.  It is a "heavier" quiche with the meat and the evaporated milk.
