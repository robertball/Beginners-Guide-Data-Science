This was a great, simple recipe.  I did use one South Carolina trick that you didn't mention--I cooked the grits in Chicken Broth rather than water, plus I added a little Half & Half to make the grits a little creamier.  I used frozen jumbo shrimp-- Outstanding!  This is definitely a Dinner Club-worthy recipe.

I am giving this 5 stars because the shrimp mixture with the sauce is incredible and SO easy to make, however I used the Velveeta grits recipe the first time I made this and it was awful. As a Southern girl who knows a thing or two about grits, I recommend you use real cheese, a dash of garlic, and some cayenne for your grits...cook them really low and keep adding water and/or milk until you get a nice, smooth consistency. I don't really modify the shrimp portion of the recipe, except for adding a little extra garlic and some turkey sausage (since shrimp is so expensive). I make this weekly and my family loves it!

This turned out great! I had a similar recipe in Charleston on a business trip and had a craving for this very dish. I did vary from the recipe by adding processed cheese (velvetta) instead of garlic cheese. The shrimp mixture was plenty garlicy by itself. A definite keeper!

This recipe is amazing! The only things I changed was to cook the grits in chicken broth and, because I didn't have the garlic cheese, I added about a cup of cheddar cheese and 2 tbsp of cream cheese into the grits. Talk about WONDERFUL! My husband got a small bowl at first thinking it wouldn't be good but was shocked how great it was. Of course he went back for seconds! I highly recommend this recipe!

If you don't make this, your crazy!!  I have to say that as many times as we've made it and for as many different pallets who've tried it, it has ALWAYS been a hit!  I never found the garlic cheese, so I just added extra cloves to the saut√©ed tomatoes. Also, I always add extra tomatoes, cayenne pepper and cheese because it is sooo good!

This is the first time I've ever eaten Shrimp and Grits let alone cooking it. But I hear people raving about it all the time so I had to try it. My family loved it and I will definitely be making this again. I took some to work the next day and had to fight off all the co-workers trying to get my lunch. Of course I had to bring the recipe for everyone the next day.

the grits were amazing but the shrimp were a little bland, I'm thinking that maybe some old bay seasoning would've helped the shrimp taste a little bit better.

I've been looking for a great shrimp/grits recipe full of flavor and have found it. Easy!! The only thing different I did was cook the grits in chicken broth as done in Savannah...  Excellent.

I've had shrimp and grits appetizers in upscaled seafood restaurants down here, but never made it myself. I just made my grits according to my box directions. I did use my homemade chicken broth in lieu of water, and added some half and half to get them extra creamy. I couldn't find a garlic cheese, so used Monterey Jack and a bit of cheddar. I grated the cheese so it would melt better. I also used canned tomatoes since the market didn't have any good tomatoes and it turned out just fine. I did add some green onions and fresh garden parsley, and seasoned the shrimp with Old Bay, paprika, and a dash of cayenne and of course the fresh minced garlic. This was just so darn delicious. So creamy and cheesy and shrimpy...how can you go wrong. Mine was even better than the restaurant's. Thanks AWEAVER.

Absolutely fabulous!  Made this for New Years Dinner, and all the leftovers were gone the next day.  Made a few Changes due to items on hand, used several Wisc cheeses, edam, sharp chedder, and montery jack.  I baked several cloves of garlic and added to the grits and the shrimp.  And, cooked the grits in chicken broth.  This will be our new tradition dinner!  Thanks!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I try variations of shrimp and grits from adding sausage to adding crab meat. Those are more time consuming so I liked the simplicity of this recipe. I have never used lemon juice in my shrimp and grits, but I liked the twist it gave the sauce. The only thing I did different was to use a 1/2 cup of light cream along with 1 1/2 large chicken cubes to 3 1/2 cups of water (my grits called for 4 cups of water to 1 cup of grits) and I skipped the cheese altogether.  I also added about 1 tbsp of cilantro to the shrimp and crumbled some turkey bacon on top just before serving.  Muy delicioso.

Great recipe and so easy to prepare.  Like others, we didn't use garlic cheese.  We also left out the tomatoes.  We used frozen shrimp, so there was extra "juice" in the pan.  We used some of that juice (about a cup) to cook the grits.  Tasted great!

The grits were fanastic.  I used chicken stock instead of water.  Also, I couldn't figure out what garlic cheese spread was.  After looking all over the grocery store, found Allouette brand garlic cheese spread.  Just dumped the whole container in with the cooked grits.  Delicious.

Best. Recipe. Ever. Period. To have my husband moan "this is delicious!" is a rare event. This recipe got that response. As others suggested, used chicken broth for grits. Also, used whipped cream cheese to replace processed, used 1 can Hunt's diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano to replace tomato. Used garlic powder in grits and minced garlic in shrimp. This is just unbelievably good. Seriously. So good, that I hang my head in shame and admit, I went back for seconds. Like, an entire plate of seconds! LOL. Thanks for sharing aweaver!

As a lifelong resident of the coastal area of SC, I know shrimp and grits and this is a very good recipe. However, if you really want to make it special, FORGET the cooking instructions for grits on the bag and do this; (1) Use Quaker Quick Grits, (2) for each cup of raw grits, use five cups of water, 1/4 Tsp. Sea Salt, 1 Tsp. Real Butter,(3) Bring water to a rolling boil, add salt and slowly stir in grits, immediately turn to low and continue stirring of a minute or two, place lid on pot, continue cooking on low heat for thirty to forty minutes stirring frequently to avoid lumping and sticking. Enjoy!

My husband and I tried grits at breakfast last week for the first time.  (Originally from IL, land of no grits...)  They were a little bland, but good with salt and butter.  Had them again at the next breakfast out and I decided to try this recipe since I had seen the dish on a cooking show about New Orleans.  It was delicious!!!!  Really, really great!  I read the other reviews (from the Southern gals) and cooked the grits in chicken broth and added about a 1/2 cup of half and half at the end.  Also used 1 cup of shredded cheddar instead of velvetta.  This was to die for!  It made the ones from the breakfast restaurant seem bad...  It was creamy, cheesy and delicious!  The hubby loved the tomato/garlic mixture the shrimp was cooked in and said that could go on one of his homemade pizzas as sauce.  He kept hovering over the stove sniffing as I was cooking so I finally put him in charge of stirring.  (If you can't get rid of them, put them to work!)  We will definitely make this again.  I'm using the leftover grits as a side dish to baked chicken tonight.  Oh ~ I also added extra garlic to the shrimp mix (we love garlic) and will add an extra pinch or two of cayenne pepper next time.  Thanks for posting the recipe!!!

I made this for dinner about a week ago.. I did make some changes like leaving out the tomato since my boyfriend and I don't like them. I also used garlic powder and mild cheddar in the grits rather than a spread... I also put a chicken bullion cube in the water when I made the grits and added about 1/4 cup of cream and a tablespoon of butter to the grits... but he absolutely loved it... will be adding this to my rotation,...

Being a northerner, this was first attempt at making AND eating grits and shrimp, although I have wanted to do so for some time now.  This recipe looked just up my alley and I was not disappointed.  I used regular Velveeta and added some garlic powder to the grits (instant) because I could not find the garlic-flavored cheese.  I also took the liberty of adding some sliced sweet onions, strips of bell pepper and sliced scallions as I had these on hand and wanted to use them up.  The end product was very tasty and my additions made the dish a bit more colorful.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is fabulous!  Like others, I cooked the grits in chicken broth and a little bit of cream.  I also chopped up some sausage and sauteed it with the tomato and garlic before adding the shrimp. I'm from GA/still live here and this is very authentic-tasting. Yum!

As someone who does not have much experience cooking with seafood, I was looking for a simple shrimp recipe, and this was it!! I didn't have processed cheese, so I used grated cheese, but it still turned out much better than I expected. I will definitely be making this again! VERY GOOD!!

I used this recipe as more of a method than following it exactly, so my rating is based on that. For the changes I incorporated was to use chicken stock instead of water for my grits, I shredded 6 oz of a block of hot pepper cheese instead of the garlic cheese and I also stirred in 1/4 cup of heavy cream into my grits with the cheese.  2lbs of shrimp is way too much, even for 4 servings, so I always use 1-1/2 lbs of shrimp completely peeled, since having the tails on makes this dish very messy to eat.  To finish the dish, I sprinkled cooked and crumbled bacon and sliced green onions over the top.....AMAZING....

Loved it but I switched some things up that topped it off. I used milk instead of water and yellow grits and put a lot of cheese in it. That made it just perfect

For those on the fence about grits, I must advise using chicken broth to cook them and despite the package claiming that they're quick, be prepared to babysit them a bit and cook slower.  The texture is much more appealing.
Like others, I had no idea what garlic flavored processed cheese was  and after much scouring on the internet have concluded that it is a discontinued product and any substitute can only be remotely found.
I do not like Velveeta flavored dishes so in an attempt to duplicate (and a little desperation) the descriptions of this elusive cheese I bought Alouette Garlic & Herbs spreadable cheese and used half the container (3 oz) and about 4 oz shredded cheddar.  The flavor was very good.  The shrimp mixture is great and wonderful over the grits.  Make sure the shrimp are patted dry before cooking.  Any excess moisture dilutes the flavor.
My rating is based on inclusion of ingredient that seems to no longer exist.
My own preferences include adding 1/2 cup of half & half or heavy cream when you add the cheese.  Helps texture if you have eaters who are grits shy.

I looooved this. I'm from Texas and the grits reminded me of my grandmother. My boyfriend and kids  didn't grow up on grits, and didn't like it as much. But I think it was because of the texture of the grits, which is unavoidable. The flavor was amazing.

I took this dish to a big brunch party and it was everyone's favorite thing on the buffet. I got raves and many went back for seconds. The only change I made was i added about a cup of white wine to the tomato mixture and sprinkled crisp bacon on top once it was assembled.

My husband doesn't eat leftovers.  I made this recipe (did cook the grits in chicken stock), and we're having the leftovers tomorrow night!  Hands down the best shrimp recipe I've ever made!  You will love this simple meal!!!

Sooooo good! I didn't have a tomato but had a can of diced tomatoes. Worked very well. It's something I can buy and have on stock and not have to worry about spoiling too soon!

Fairly quick to get on the table on a busy weeknight. I will make this again, but will definitely tweak next time. First off, I'm not a lover of "processed cheese" at all, so I'll either use less than 6 oz next time, or substitute Alouette cheese spread. Like the majority of reviewers, I also used chicken broth and a little half and half for the grits, which was nice. I used the frozen shrimp tonight, but I'd prefer raw shrimp next time. I'd even like to experiment with some turkey sausage and extra veggies. I'll also use 2 roma tomatoes, diced, instead of only one. The lemony, garlic sauce was very good, but I did toss in some parsley and chives for color. Husband inhaled this and I honestly didn't think he'd dig this dinner. Overall, an easy, tasty dish to serve without a lot of prep work or fuss.

This dish was wonderful! I made it last night for my husband's birthday and he devoured it! I would suggest paring it with turnip greens and vinegar along with blue cheese corn bread! To save yourself some time, I would splurge and get the shrimp already deveined and peeled.

We love this. We make it probably a few times a month.  I put a lot of tomatoes in there because I really like the sweetness with the shrimp and it makes more of a sauce that I pour over the grits. We usually use pepper cheese because we like the hotness.

Having had shrimp and grits before (it's not common in Wisconsin, but I travel), this wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it was still really delicious, and super quick to prepare. I think the next time I make this, I'll add more veggies.

5 stars.  I am very happy with this recipe.  The second time I made it, I cooked a few strips of bacon, and then used the same pan with the drippings to saute the garlic, tomato and shrimp.  I added the crumbled bacon as a topping. Great flavor.
7/15/14  Update:  I now add a little white wine to the shrimp mixture and cook.  Adds an extra flavor.  A family favorite

When its time to impress this is the dish that stands out from all the rest. I prefer slow cooking grits as opposed to quick cooking. In place of olive oil I always use grape seed oil. The flavor is astounding. Easy recipe. A keeper.

I doubled the sauce and added fresh basil.  WOW!!!  To make the grits more creamy, I added half-and-half.  This is real comfort food.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so used canned, diced tomatoes.  I could lick the saucepan dry, it was so good.

This was great.  I took a few of the suggestions and left out the processed cheese and instead used cheddar cheese.  I added in powdered garlic when cooking the grits (very slow with 2  parts water and 2 parts heavy whipping cream to 1 part grits).  I also added in about a teaspoon of cayenne because I like heat in my food.  Last I only used one tomato and prior to adding the shrimp I sauteed five heads of garlic.

I'll make this again for sure - it was delicious.

Very good and easy. The family liked it and they dont like much. Had to use real american cheese plus garlic powder but it worked well. Always add a little milk or cream to grits for a creamy texture. Very southern recipe. Thanks

I think this recipe has potential to be really good but my husband and I felt that it was missing something.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used Old Bay instead of salt.  I will make this again and continue to play with different flavors to make great.

This was sooooo good and rich!  I used "boursin" cheese and followed the directions and it was GOOD!  However, once I sprinkled some chipolte tabasco sauce on it - it was AWESOME!!!!!!!! (thus, 4 stars)

Great...while preparing my husband, native Northerner, said he'd never had grits and knew he would not like them.  He love this dish and asked that I add this recipe to my list of dishes to serve our guests.  I did take advice from other reviewers added rotel tomatoes, onion, & old bay.  Easy and very D e l i s h.

I've never made grits before but following suggestions on here they came out great. Used chicken broth but forgot to add the cheese. Also, I added some red onion, sliced ham and some brocolli to the shrimp/tomato mixture. I used thawed frozen shrimp and added a couple pats of butter to the sauce just before serving. Made a wonderful broth.

Excellent. Took advice of other reviews cooking grits in partial chix broth and reserving some broth for the gravy. Gravy: Added 1/2 c. chopped mushr. Combined one fresh tom with half can Rotel tom and green chilies/mild. Diced 2 scallions. Added 2 Tbl Worc Sauce, no lemon. Simmer for 15+ and adjust flavor. Wow.

Fantastic!  I made the shrimp and sauce almost exactly, just added (1)tbs more of butter and EVOO and +2 more cloves of garlic.  For the grits:  added a pinch of cheddar and about 2oz. of cream cheese. Excellent.

Oh.my.goodness.

I was born and raised in GA and have never in my whole life heard of combining my two fave things ~ grits and shrimp. Knowing grits as a breakfast food and shrimp not so much...just didn't sound like a good combo.  My husband went on a business trip to Missouri and came back saying that the dish was good.  So...I tried it.  I didn't have cayenne on hand, so I added a few shakes of Franks hot sauce (hey...I am in the south, I DO have hot sauce :))...and for cheese, I wasn't sure on what to get, so I use onion and chive cream cheese.  I cooked the grits in chicken broth like someone suggested.  Didn't use fresh tomatoes...but I had canned some tomatoes this past summer, so I used that.

This is definitely a keeper!!!  Yummy!

This was fabulous and so easy!  I changed the servings to 6, but followed the recipe exactly.  I think next time, I won't use as much oil.  The entire family loved it!  It will definitely be added to our monthly rotation!

I made an amount for two servings. Changes that I made- Since I didn't have chicken broth on hand, I simply boiled some chicken bouillon for the grits. From there, used cheddar jack instead of processed cheese. Avoided cayenne. Cooked the shrimp from frozen and as another reviewer mentioned, it created more juice than otherwise. I drained the excess juice. Did not add extra salt to anything. The combination was marvelous even if I ended up peeling shrimp after cooking, and I will definitely add this to rotation!

I introduced grits to my son and his girlfriend with this recipe. Cheesy grits are one of my favorites comfort foods! They loved everything and asked for the recipe so they can make it themselves.  It's quick and easy, as well as delicious.

This is the first time I‚Äôve tried savory grits. I just used what I had on hand, such as Swiss cheese & grape tomatoes. I did take the suggestion of cooking the grits in chicken broth & adding a splash of half&half. Pretty good.

Have made this a couple of times now. I use chicken broth when making my grits & it gives a better flavor. The only change I've made is I don't use garlic flavored processed cheese. Instead, we use cream cheese & cheddar cheese in equal parts to make the amount that is called for in our number of servings. We have decided we like a little more cayenne pepper than it calls for & less lemon, but that is personal preference. Once we tried as others suggested in using part of a can of diced tomatoes, but we won't anymore. It is much better using the roma tomato that the recipe calls for.

I added some green peppers to the shrimp, but that's just because I like green peppers. I did use the chicken stock like suggested, but this is a simple recipe. Great flavors and you can make it your own if you like!

This recipe was so quick , easy and delicious. I did use a cube of bouillon instead of plan water. I used Land o' lakes butter with olive oil and sea salt to sautee some minced garlic and throw my shrimp in I also used Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasonings since the butter was salted. Right at the end of cooking the grits maybe the last 2-3 minutes. I poured in a half cup or so of half and half and added my mild cheddar and provolone cheese. Excellent!! Thanks!

Oh my goodness!  This dish was amazing!  My husband went to Alabama and tried shrimp and grits.  He wanted me to try to make this dish. Being a California girl, I  had never heard of this  and was a bit reluctant to try it. But I  decided to give it a try. It was absolutely delicious!  My husband couldn't  stop raving about it. This will surely be one of my favorite recipes that I will make again and again!

This recipe desperately needs some bell pepper added. Without any heat I found this a little bland. I put a good amount of cayenne, a dash of pepper, and topped with green onions. It still needed the addition of the fresh peppers and possibly, like some others said, a dash of hot sauce. I also cooked my grits in chicken broth instead of water. I imagine had i used water this would have very little flavor.

This dish is amazing! One of the simplest and delicious recipes I have ever made. I added velveeta shreds and used quick grits. Added a little blackened seasoning to the shrimp for some heat. It's just sinfully delicious!!!

Holy Moly this is really good.  My kids wouldn't touch it - keep in mind they didn't even try it.  But my husband and I both thought it was wonderful.  I will definitely put up with grouchy kids to have this again.

Replace the shrimp with crawfish tails and add orange juice instead of the lime. This is a wonderful switch... trust me!!!

Very good!  Followed another reviewer"s suggestion and added 1 cup of cheddar cheese and a Tablespoon of cream cheese.  Shrimp could use a little more seasoning>

Shrimp was so good.   The grits were to thick.  I would have preferred the grits without the cheese.

Good recipe. I did use chicken broth/stock to cook grits vs  water & added a touch of cream to them. The grits were flavorful. I enjoyed the grits by itself. However, I did not like the shrimp spooned over it. I just did not like the combination of flavors. I have never had true shrimp & grits before, so cannot say if this recipes tastes as it should. I just personally didn't like the flavor combinations. I have had Etouffee over plain grits, which a co-worker (ex-chef) had made and it was wonderful! I thought this may be similar, but just didn't work for me. I will make grits this way again, as the cheese and garlic was divine! :)

This was fantastic. I used the chicken broth as recommended by so many in the grits. I have never made grits before this recipe, but everything came out perfectly. My family was impressed. Great recipe. I'll be making this many times in the future.

This was okay, but not great.  I used everything to a T, but did use a can of Rotel instead of the tomato and used cheddar cubes as I couldn't find the garlic cheese in the grocery store.  As others suggested, I cooked the grits in the chicken broth.  Personally, I think the chicken broth was just too overwhelming.  Next time I'm going cook the grits in 1/2 broth and 1/2 water.

these were sooo good!  i have never had grits before and wanted to try them.  this recipe was a great introduction to them!  i couldn't find garlic flavored cheese, so just used regular Velveeta.  i used 2 huge garlic cloves to compensate, and definitely could taste the garlic.  i used frozen shrimp  - i didn't have a ton in my freezer, so next time i will definitely use the suggested 2 pounds.  overall, myself, hubby and 3 year old all devoured and it has been declared a "keeper"!

So very good. It was so quick and easy to make also.  The cheese I added was garlic cheese.  I also added andouille sausage.  My husband could not get enough!!

This was good and simple. I thought the tomato was too much. Used pepperjack instead. Couldn't find garlic cheese. Overall, we will make again!

This was pretty tasty, however all the shrimp and grits recipes I've tried, the grits aren't quite thick enough, maybe they just aren't meant to be.

This recipe would probably have been 5 stars if I had used better shrimp.  I made this on the fly & used frozen, which watered down the sauce way too much.  Other than that, it was very good.  Like another reviewer I could not find the garlic processed cheese so I used a Queso Blanco (white Mexican) Velvetta & it was GREAT. My husband doesn't like grits & he ate seconds, commenting that the added spice really made the whole meal taste great.  Next time I'll use better shrimp, but we'll keep the queso cheese grits.

Awesome recipe!  Deserves 5 stars.  I have made this dozens of times, varying the ingredients sometimes.  But no matter what, it's always fabulous and impressive to guests.  I prefer Roma tomatoes and extra garlic.
