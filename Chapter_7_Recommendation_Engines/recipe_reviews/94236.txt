This recipe was a really good, homestyle breakfast.  It had great flavor.  The critical thing I can say is that I don't think cooking the egg in the chili is worth the effort.  You'd be just as good off cooking the egg on the side and then putting it on the chili afterwards.  It makes it a lot easier and I don't think taste would be compromised at all.

Prepared this for lunch on a cold, rainy day! Scaled the recipe to half, cause there's only 2 of us, and it was excellent! Corn bread on the side, and my Dad is still raving about the 'hot beans and egg'! (Saw this in today's (12/30/05) post, and WILL do it again! Lots of Taco blend cheese on top before serving!

Yummy. This was really good. I left out the bacon and added some cheese on top.
