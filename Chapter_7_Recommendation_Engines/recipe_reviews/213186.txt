Wow, wow, and WOW!! The translation from Italian is actually "Venus' Nipples." If you've ever seen the movie "Amadeus," Salieri offers them to Mozart's wife and she giggles because the name is so naughty - but I digress. These are the real deal, authentic taste. The puree of chestnut adds a unique depth, characteristic of these gems. It's true that they're time consuming, but incredibly worth it. I have to point out that the recipe submitter said "high quality" chocolate, and that cannot be stressed enough. Your product will only taste as good as the chocolate you use. I used Lindt, which made for an incredibly delicious treat. Take the time to temper the white chocolate as described - it's spot on. If you melt it slowly, it will retain its lovely sheen, which gives your product high appeal. Kudos for this one!!

These truffles are heavenly!!! Preparing them is a little time-consuming but your efforts will be repaid. The recipe here is very detailed and easy to follow. Try to use fresh chestnuts if they are available. It gives the truffles a richer taste. For variety, add finely chopped toasted almonds or freshly grated nutmeg to the truffle mixture. Thank you, Ms. LaLeeRu!

TY for sharing this! I have been wanting to try this for more than 15 years, ever since I first saw them in the movie, Amadeus, haha! I appreciate the detailed directions. This is definitely a time-intensive recipe and not one for a beginner or those who are impatient. But I love it!

Rather time consuming, but delicious! Pretty too... I used fresh chestnuts and premium chocolate.

I did not try this recipe but I wanted to thank you for the tip about the food coloring. I thought it was just that I had the stove set too high. Thanks!

This is not an easy recipe to make. i guess if your more used to dealing with candy it is probably much easier but it was my first attempt at something like this (I wanted to surprise my wife). They did turn out tasty very much so actually but I had several challenges that I didn't know how to deal with. I would appreciate an email from someone who has experience making these so maybe I can ask some questions and do better next time :)  email is tac62@sbcglobal.net  THANKS!!

I just made this recipe for Valentine's Day tomorrow. I used 1 teaspoon of Brandy instead of 1/4 cup.  The filling was perfect, not thin at all, so was easy to roll.  I also used chopped hazelnuts instead of chestnuts. The taste was great!  The only thing I would do next time is pour the white chocolate over the truffles on a cooling rack to make the coating look cleaner.

These turned out beautifully! I did use Chef John’s method for the “nipple” (powdered sugar, milk, and food coloring), but other than that, I had no problems on the first go. Also, saying Capezzoli di Venere in a terrible Italian accent at the top of my voice is a fun added bonus.

I've been making these for the past two Or three years now.  My husband and I love them.  I have done some tweaking of the recipe. Most notably is that I use bag chestnuts rather than canned. This tends to leave it slightly drier which I then tweak with the addition of a little brandy.  I must confess, I'm still struggling with the dipping.  I cannot tell you how many screeching sessions and marbled looking confections have come out of my efforts.  This year I Will get it right! I love the story behind these. I wanted them since I was little and saw them in "Amadeus" too. I did find out later that the ones in the movie were made out of marzipan which the actress playing Mozart's wife ate, take after take, not knowing that she could spit them out . I believe it must've been her first movie , she ended up getting sick ??
