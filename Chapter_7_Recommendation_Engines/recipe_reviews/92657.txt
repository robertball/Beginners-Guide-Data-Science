A few changes: I sauted chopped red onion with the chopped ham (in butter instead of oil) and used shredded mozzarella instead of cubed swiss. Also,just drain the pasta, don't rinse it.Fast, easy, and tasty!

I loved how quick and easy this was, but also thought it was bland. I assume the recipe didn't call for salt or any other seasoning because the ham should be salty enough. Instead of Swiss I would try some sort of bagged shredded cheese to save the step of dicing the Swiss. I would also add some sort of veggie, like chopped broccoli. In this case I had to add some milk because it looked so dry and dumped a bunch of different seasonings, like salt, pepper, Mrs. Dash and garlic powder.

We all loved this - the melted stringy swiss cheese is great.  I added bite size steamed asparagus to make it a one dish meal.  Delicious!

QUICK! Great way to use up some leftover ham! Hubby said its a keeper and surprizingly "Filling". I had some leftover Green beans to add for color....did add diced onions, used the cellaphane swiss but added some fresh picarino parmesan into it...It smelled so great cooking!

This sounds good. I think provolone cheese would be good if you switch it with the swiss

VERY EASY. As a mother of a 6 month old I'm always looking for quick meals.  

I put milk and swiss cheese in with the ham after I cooked the meat, let it melt, then added some pepper and rosemary and then the mixture in with the noodles.  Served with Asparagus.

Will make again.

Ive tried this two ways. 1.. following the recipe and 2... my way. I added red pepper flakes, and garlic. Gives it a little kick, and wakes up the Swiss cheese! :)

This dish was amazing! Yesterday was my older brother's birthday, a HUGE cheese and ham lover. When I made this,I added mozzarella and provolone. When frying the ham I used butter, I added half a diced onion, chopped broccoli, and some garlic. When mixing the ingredients, I added some milk and sour cream to make it creamier.

It tasted great where the cheese was but for some reason my cheese would not melt properly.  It led to disappointment with my family.

I like the ingredients in this, but found it to be really dry and bland. The cheese was really stringy. I think my family would have liked it a bit more if it had been  smooth and creamy.  Might try again but will make cheese sauce first.

This made for a wonderful "in a hurry" dinner for my family.  My kids were a bit leery about the way it looked, but loved it after one bite.  I have been told that this recipe is a new family favorite!

Definitely dry...needs some sort of a white sauce.  But the flavor is good - I think this is a good starting point for a ham and noodle recipe. I needed something quick for dinner and this fit the bill, but I will be changing it up a little next time I make it. Also, even with the ham, it needs salt.

This was kind of good, but just a bit on the bland side. I tried to make it exactly as written, but in two stores, the only ziti I could find were Barilla's "Piccolini" mini ziti. And as for the ham, I had to choose between honey ham and smoked; I'm glad I chose smoked, because the more robust flavor helped the dish. This was decent for a quick, cheap meal, but it was nothing special, in my opinion.

This is an extremely easy and tasty way to use up that extra holiday ham.  I only gave it 4 stars because I changed a few things based on other reviews.    I sliced the ham before I cooked it and added some garlic while frying it.  After tossing it a couple of minutes in the oil, I added a little water (maybe 1/3 cup) then covered the pan with a lid.  I did this so it would continue to heat the ham by steam and not burn or need additional oil, it also allows you to not have to constantly stir or flip the ham.  I then drained it prior to adding to the pasta.  I added shredded swiss cheese and steamed broccoli for some color.  I topped the dish with crushed red pepper flakes.  It was very yummy, will definitely make it again!

i thought this was really great. we used leftover ham from easter weekend and it was very good. taking advice from other reviewers, i also added some red pepper flakes and garlic, it was so good! i also added leftover asparagus that had been baked in the oven the day before in olive oil, and it complemented the dish nicely!

This was actually pretty good! I had a little trouble getting the cheese to melt and I cut it up reallly small and seperated each piece when putting it in the pan. I did add some butter while melting the cheese because it was kind of dry, maybe using some of the water from boiling the pasta would help.  I have a ton of deli sliced ham to use up so this was a great easy recipe for that purpose!!

The cheese seemed to stay in clumps, so next time I think I'll add some milk to help make these creamier. My husband added some spice since the recipe was bland.

Perfect for picky eaters.  My kids destroyed this dish!!  I did make some modifications to give it some flavor, here is what I did:  sauté garlic and finely chopped onions in olive oil, then add ham.  Once the pasta is done drain and mix in 2-3 tablespoons of butter (this helps the cheese).  Then add the Swiss, mozzarella and provolone (shredded).  For the adults I sautéd asparagus and broccoli, with onion salt in the garlic/onion/olive oil mixture that's above (in another pan).    I tossed the veggie mixture with the pasta for my husband and I.  Everyone was happy and it really was a fast and easy dinner.  Recommend you make twice as much, we had none left over for lunch.

bland. My kid said, "this has no taste." I wish I had added an egg and some cream so there would actually be a sauce, not just clumps of cheese.

Great recipe for getting rid of holiday ham! I have a big family so I doubled everything. Took some advice from other reviews and melted the swiss cheese with some milk first then poured it over the pasta when it was complete. I also took my fathers advice and added some pepperoni. Adds a lot of spice and made it more like a meat lovers pasta. Thank you!

I added 3 pats of butter to the pasta to give it a nice gloss. I also used the cheese I had on hand: about 1 cup of shredded cheddar-jack and 5 slices of swiss. I also added about 1/4 cup of parmesan. But is still needed something else... I added alot of ground pepper, but was reluctant to add salt with the salty parmesan and the ham. If I didn't get a bite with ham in it, it was somewhat bland. I did add about 1 cup of frozen peas to give it some color and to make it a true one-pot meal. My husband loved it, but added alot of cayenne pepper to the top of his plate.

This is a tasty, quick dinner using ingredients I already had on hand, but I agree with the others that it was a little bland.  I added a little cooked onion, and a few dashes on hot sauce, but is still needed...something.

Not a fan of this one.   Tasted very plain.   Easy to make but likely won't cook again.
