My review from when it was still a personal recipe: "I thought I was the only person who did this. I like to add in chopped pickled jalapenos to this, too. Great stuffed inside celery or a hollowed out cucumber for a low-carb snack."

This egg salad was surprisingly nice.  It was very creamy & tasty.  As is, the salsa is not pronounced, just combines surprisingly well with the cottage cheese.  It would be nice either as is, or with pickle relish and chopped onion, or with onion and pickled jalapenos/hot-sauce/extra-salsa (or fresh).  --  Actually, I'm not typically a huge fan of egg salad so haven't been in the habit of making it.  But because I found out that my husband has been missing egg salad, I've been working on trying to find an egg salad recipe that I could enjoy with him.  If I don't find another recipe that I like better than this one, I'll be quite satisfied with this one.  Hubs certainly enjoyed it a lot.  However, I'll keep looking since I'd like to find an egg salad recipe that has some 'wow' factor for me rather than just a 'very nice' egg salad.  Hubs for one says, "Yum!" as is.

I thought this was good. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese as that's what I had on hand. It worked well. I could see adding more spice to this if that's what you want, but I thought it was tasty as is. Thanks for a new idea for egg salad.

A good and easy recipe. A little on the bland side; would probably use more salsa and more S & P next time.
