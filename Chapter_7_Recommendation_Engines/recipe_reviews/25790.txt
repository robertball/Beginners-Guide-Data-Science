Very tasty and easy to make. I used two different kinds of chocolate and reduced-fat peanut butter and it still turned out wonderful. Thanks.

As of right now these get a 4.  I just made them and have not really had a chance to taste them, but my suggestion for the peanut butter is to drop it by tablespoons all over top of the bars right out of the oven, turn the oven off, and stick them back in the oven for a couple of minutes so the peanut butter can melt a little thus making it really easy to spread!!  I did have to take a little taste off the corner of the pan ;-) and they tasted pretty darn good!!  But like other viewers said, very crumbly, i had to use a spoon!!  Over all a good and very very easy bar!

Update, I changed my review to 2 stars, because we only ate about 1/4 of the pan.  They tasted really good to begin with, but they just weren't so awesome that we had to keep eating them.  By the way we never ever let a desert or bars or anything sweet go to waste, hahah, we are a sweets family, so the fact that we didn't eat hardly any of these should say something.  sorry, just not that good

This is so yummy.  It really was crumbly until it cools completely.  I put it in the fridge and then cut into bars.  Serve cold or warm.  Great easy recipe.

We made good use of the "crumbles".  Great for an ice cream topper.  Might as well drizzle some chocolate syrup over them too!

Very good, but I was disappointed that they weren't actually ready in the time listed. They were still too soft several hours later. It was only after sitting out all night that they reached "bar" consistency. I used graham cracker crumbs instead of rolled oats. Next time, I will try refrigerating them to get them to harden faster.

After reading the reviews about how crumbly the bars were, I made them thinner and refrigerated them before cutting them into small squares.  It worked out fine.  I didn't measure the peanut butter, I simply spread enough peanut butter on the top to make a thin layer.  They don't look impressive, but they are very tasty.

This was very sweet. It was good, but not the best. I do not think I will make it again because there are much better things to make than this.
