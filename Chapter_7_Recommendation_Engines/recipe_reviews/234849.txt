I work for Starbucks and do not like our pumpkin spice sauce. This was world's better. I did cut back the pumpkin spice back by half only because a full teaspoon for one serving seemed like a lot to me. I made no other changes.

I wouldn't call this quick as my husband was quite impatient asking if it was done yet constantly while making this. It takes about 10 minutes or so. I added a dash or two of cloves in and added spice separately instead of pumpkin pie spice. I also used Splenda instead of sugar. It is important to strain or otherwise you will have pumpkin spice sludge in your cup. Overall when all was said and done my husband said this was better than starbucks.

Yum, this was pretty good. I would rate it between 4-5 stars. I had assumed that Starbucks just used a pumpkin flavored syrup, as this was compared to that. I made 1/2 recipe. That amount yielded 1 coffee cup, which was all I wanted. Instead of whisking and heating the milk on the stove top, I just put it in my Nespresso frother to save time and dishes. I mixed the frothed milk and other ingredients into a cup. I decided to strain it, as the directions suggested. I honestly, did not see a difference though. I ended up adding a tad more coffee, but it was mainly just to mask the sweetness. I do not care for sugar in coffee, but wanted to follow the directions. I would make this again, with leftover pumpkin, just reducing the sugar some for personal preference.

This was delicious! Although, I went the lazy route, and put all the ingredients into a measuring cup and heated up in the microwave. I also used organic pumpkin pie filling because that's what I had and still used the same measurement of pumpkin spice because I love the taste. I have a handheld frother I used, and used instant espresso too. Great, quick cup that tastes better than Starbucks, and better for you too!

I used 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c strong brewed coffee. I thought 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice sounded like way too much, so I used 1/2 tsp and thought it was spiced perfectly. I like that the recipe calls for straining it, as I tried another recipe on here, and I had lots of pumpkin puree at the bottom of my cup. I'm just not a big fan of real pumpkin puree in my coffee. I would rather just have the spices.

I used Splenda and doubled the pumpkin puree, did not bother to strain it. I used an immersion blender to froth everything but the esspresso, then placed it in my Ninja Coffee Bar, cup size, specialty brew. This was just ok to me.

Easy and great tasting.  I made mine with out the sugar as I don't add sugar to my coffee.  Tasted great, but it could have used a dash of sugar.

Tried this and really enjoyed it, as did my son. I would cut the pumpkin pie spice down next time but still really good!

Modified for allergies and diet. Replace pumpkin pie spice with 1/2 cinnamon, 1/2 ginger. Replace sugar with honey. Omit espresso. Chill and use in place of store bought seasonal flavored creamer. Delicious!

Delicious (though in retrospect, a little too much work for a busy weekday morning - but that was partly because I was out of pumpkin pie spice and had to look up how to make it from scratch). As others recommended, I used only half a teaspoon of spice, and that was perfect. I didn't have espresso, so I used about half a packet of instant sweetened coffee in half a mug of water. That made the finished product a little sweeter than I would have preferred, so next time I'll try putting in half the sugar it calls for. But I still loved it!

My husband and I were just not a fan of this recipe. I made it exactly as written and it just tasted off or maybe it's just not what we were expecting. I think it needed more coffee.

I made this this morning and it was pretty good. I would suggest halving the recipe and adding more coffee though. The spices did not mix in well when starting with them in cold milk, so I would get the first half of the milk warm first.

This was good coffee, just not the flavor I was expecting. Maybe it was the way I prepared it(?). I made my espresso and just added the Pumpkin, straight-up, to the hot espresso, along with the rest of the ingredients.... And, no straining. It all melted in nicely and I had no grit, lumps or chunks what-so-ever. I also could not taste the Pumkin tho'. I added an additional Tablespoon and STILL could not taste it. Frustrating. Maybe it's just my taste buds tho', who knows? It still was a good cup of coffee, Pumkin flavor or not :)
