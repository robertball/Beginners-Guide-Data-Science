I've been making this recipe for years, given to me by my husband's favorite aunt when I was a new bride. Her recipe calls for using a 17" X 11" jelly roll pan, which makes them more "bar-like." I have found that cutting back on the oil helps the texture to be less heavy. I use only 1-1/4 cup, and the rest is never missed. Also have varied the type of baby food, sometimes using sweet potatoes in place of the carrots, and peaches in place of the apricots, pears in place of applesauce, or even plums. They all make only subtle differences in flavor. Virtually any fruit or root vegetable baby food can be used successfully. You can even use plums for all 3 jars and make a delicious autumn plum cake, baked in a bundt pan (usually takes around 45-55 minutes at 350 degrees) and then glaze it. The variations are quite endless. I always frost with a cream cheese frosting, which makes a good thing even better. In fact, to us, the cream cheese frosting is a must-do. Any way you make them and serve them, they never fail to draw rave reviews. Have copies of this recipe handy, because you're going to get lots of requests!

Easy but mediocre. I made it because it sounded interesting, since I've never used baby foods in a cake as ingredients. However, it's just like a carrot or spice cake, nothing memorable or special.

Even though I am the one who submitted this recipe, I have to rate it. This is a family favorite. I have to make two batches when I make them. I do ahve a note to add to this recipe though; I submitted the wrong size pan: should be a jelly roll pan.

I use to make this recipe while working at a catering business- it was a hit there and still is.  I had forgotten the recipe and was glad to find it. I do not classify this as a "carrot cake" but more a spice cake.  I used this recipe to make cupcakes for my daughter's class at school and topped with cream cheese icing and decorative sprinkles for the holiday. Very moist and flavorful cake!!!

I added another 1/2 c of applesauce & decreased the oil by same amount. The men at the baby shower were afraid to try it when I said there was baby food in it; they liked it best.

This is a wonderful recipe we've enjoyed for years, though I've never added the cinnamon.  I cut back on the oil a bit(to 1 1/4 cups), bake it in a jellyroll pan, and top it with a fluffy cream cheese frosting.  It's more cake-like than bar-like - delicious!

I made this for my son's first birthday; he dug right in, and everyone else loved it, too.  I split the batter between a 9x13 and a 1 qt casserole dish (because those are my two pans) and had cream cheese frosting optional, but the cake was so moist and delicious that the frosting was unecessary.  I'll be purchasing a jelly roll pan and making this again.

Carrot or spice...cake or bars, it doesn't matter, this is an awesome recipe.  My mom's recipe was called Bingo Squares and I them love now just as much as I did back then.  My entire family loves this recipe.

Tasty and easy.  Used 2 extra applesauce jars and only 1 cup oil.

I made this recipe the way it says to; using the 9 x 13 pan.  It still turned out good, it just took 30 minutes to bake all the way through.  My 19 month old little girl likes them & its a good way to get her to eat some baby food since now she likes big people food.  I'll make these again using different flavors of baby food. Very easy to make.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't get cake bars, I got cake.  I thought it was OK but not something I'd make twice.  I did notice that my husband ate about 1/4 of the pan for breakfast, so perhaps that says something good!

Grew up next to the one who submitted the recipe and was very happy to see it here! I love these bars and have gotten my kids addicted to them. I make them per the recipe but the homemade cream cheese frosting is a must, do not use store bought it will change the whole taste.
