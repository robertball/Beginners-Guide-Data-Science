These mocha bars taste GREAT! They are very
fudgie and moist.  The only problem I had
with them is they are very hard to cut, because
they stick to the knife and very hard to get 
out of the pan.  They want to stick to the knife
or spatula.  I followed the recipe in using a clean,
wet knife, but that still did not work.  It was 
very frustrating when I could not get them out of
the pan.
of the pan.

Delicious. I didn't have any turbinado sugar, so I used half regular sugar and half Splenda. It tasted great. next time I am going to try it with a higher ratio of Splenda to Sugar. Very rich and moist. I baked this in a 8X8 pan for 40 minutes. It was perfect.

I made this again with all Splenda instead of sugar and it turned out great. This time instead of vanilla, I subbed chocolate Torani syrup. YUM! More chocolately!

These bars are very rich, but you won't fool anyone into thinking they're a traditional cake or brownie.  With that said, they're good in and of themselves...  they're like a mixture between pudding and cake.  I bet they'd be perfect for an ice cream sandwich (traditional cookies get too hard when they hit the ice cream).  I only used 1 3/4 cups sugar, and they were very sweet.  I might try reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and reducing the cocoa slightly.  Make sure you use good tofu (I used Morinu), because its flavor will come through.

This is a great tofu recipe! Makes the bars super smooth and rich and soft.  I'm more of a cakey person though, I don't tend to like soft things like pudding, or mousse so if you do, this is a must try! :) It is definitely not a rich brownie - there is no cake texture and it's too soft :) The batter did spread out really thin b/c it's so soft like another reviewer said - next time I'll probably bake in a smaller pan or maybe add some baking powder.  I think my bf will love this b/c he's the opposite of me and loves soft things! :) And I didn't have safflower oil so I used "I can't believe it's butter" and I used white flour instead of whole wheat and a mixture of light and dark brown sugar in place of the unrefined sugar, and Irish Cream liqueur instead of the instant coffee powder and I added some caramel sauce.  I might try again with whole wheat flour that could give it an interesting taste.  I might incorporate tofu into my regular brownie recipe :)

I used this recipe while teaching a 
vegetarian cooking class. It was very 
easy to demonstrate, relatively healthy,
and tasted absolutely wonderful! Try 
this recipe if you like RICH tasting 
desserts!

I was surprised at how good this tasted. I halved the recipe and used an 8-in square pan. The batter was spread out pretty thin, about 1/4-in and didn't look presentable, but it was really rich and delicious. I substituted light brown sugar for the turbinado sugar.

Delicious, thank you!!  Bake in an 8x8 pan instead and you get perfect, rich fudge brownies!  (bake them longer too).  I tried them with one substitution: instead of the coffee, I used flavored hot cocoa mix - lots of variations possible.

These are really good!
I didn't use the full ammount of coffee and they were perfect...
I also recomend adding nuts and craisins to the top!!
They can also be cooked a little longer to make firm-

Really delicious the first day, especially warm and topped with whipped cream! However, this recipe does NOT keep well at all, which is why I gave it only four stars. It's also quick and easy to make, and even pretty healthy.

very good! I didn't have unrefined sugar, so I used regular. I also replaced 1/4 cup of cocoa with 1 scoop chocolate whey protein powder, and used Teecino (organic coffee replacement) instead of decaf grounds. even got husband approval!

The taste is deffinetly on in these bars! I did make a few alterations, using all splenda in place of sugar, and swapping out all the flour for vanilla protein powder. Also, we had no safflower oil, so I just melted up the same amount of coconut oil, which prompted me to add 1 tsp coconut extract :)  The texture was rich and dense- almost like fudge! And the taste was deffinetly similar to that of a brownie.   However, I have no idea how someone could get 24 servings from this! I baked mine in a 10x7 inch pan, and got 16 small, thin brownies. Other than the serving discrepency, these are perfect.   Thanks!

I followed the recipe pretty closely with the only changes being using slightly less sugar (2 cups instead of 2 1/3), and adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla after tasting the batter.  I baked it in an 8 x 8 square pan, and greased AND floured the pan so they did not stick at all!  They were creamy and hard to cut, but not bad.  I tasted them right after I made them and thought, "Eh, good enough but not so great I would make them again."  Then, after leaving them overnight I decided to have another small bar with my afternoon tea and they were REALLY GOOD!  Something about having them sit for awhile made the flavors blend nicely.  The kids like them, too, and I really love the creamy texture.

I love these... frozen. For whatever reason, they wouldn't set. I baked for a longer time than the recipe called for, but    they never firmed up. They tasted good and I didn't want to throw them out, so I put them in my freezer and... voila. A really nice frozen fudge bars. I made mine super chocolate/mocha-y: extra cocoa and a bit of kaluha on top of the coffee powder. Delish! I also wanted to spruce it a up a bit, so I added a thin cream-cheese swirl (4 oz fat-free cream cheese, a bit of sugar, and a small amount of Irish Cream). Although you can taste a faint nutty flavour from the tofu, it doesn't detract from the quality.

I used spelt flour, 1 cup of brown and 1 cup white sugar( may use less next time), olive oil and a handful of dark chocolate chips. Next time I will use stevia for the sugar and will add nuts as well. This is a fun, easy and healthier then some treats recipe.
Made again and this time I used 1 3/4 brown sugar, 1/4 cup coffee, coconut dessert tofu, coconut and walnuts with spelt flour.

I made these bars on a lark and they were simple to make.  I used brown sugar, and only used 1 and 1/2 cups of it.  My bars were kinda rubbery... although they had a nice dark chocolate flavor.  Maybe i cooked them to long.  Hmmmm... this seems like it could be great and moist but my need a little work. I put them in the freezer, maybe they will make great frozen treats.  Dont give up on this one but be carefull how long you cook and mix it.

So good! I did make a few slight modifications though. Like others I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups (3/4 Splenda and 3/4 raw sugar), used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and instead of the using the liquid the tofu was packaged in, I put a splash of soymilk. I also used a slightly smaller pan for thicker bars and increased the baking time a few minutes. The texture is obviously slightly off from a regular fudge bar but it's as close as it gets! It's dense and moist and as healthy as it gets for a chocolate fix! Next time, I'm going to try to use all Splenda next time to try and cut back on some calories. But this is definitely a keeper! Thanks!

This was so much fun to make and deeelicious. 
I gave it 4 stars b/c I think that it could've called for less sugar (2 cups) and less coffee.  Other than that, they came out moist and yummy.  Texture is not as cakey as a brownie but good enough to pass for the real thing.  Thank you!!!!

I combined all the ingredients as directed. I cooked it in a loaf pan so the brownies would be thick, keeping it in the oven for 15-17 minutes. By undercooking the thick brownies, I'm able to take it out before the bottom cooks thoroughly. After letting it cool for a few minutes, I turn it upside down on a plate, then rightside up, flipping it with another plate. The bottom is then on top and I can spread the slightly undercooked batter like it's a frosting. Even when cooled to room temperature, the "frosting" keeps it's smoothness against the brownies. YUM!

These were so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. They are like very fudgy brownies and neither I, nor my husband, could taste the tofu. These are very, very rich and I think you could get away with quite a bit less sugar. Next time I'll try using 1.5 cups. Caution: The batter is very thick (at least mine was). I didn't "pour" it into the baking pan so much as press it.

Fantastic!  Instead of using the packaging liquid from the tofu, I substituted soy milk.  I also added some nuts and carob chips. I substitued 1/2 of the sugar with Splenda. I froze the bars individually wrapped and now have a relatively healthy snack to curb my chocolate cravings.

Good recipe, not all that healthy though with the amount of sugar, oil and cocoa called for (even if it isn't refined).  I also put mine in an 8x8 pan for 40 mins - perfect!! If you let it cool for a little bit and then put it in the freezer for a little while, it makes the cutting much easier.

Very good.  Next time I might skimp a little on the coffee, though, because they were the slightest bit bitter for my husband and me.  But since they're so healthy and moist, there will definitely be a next time!

Great tofu recipe for non-tofu eaters!  Rich and chocolatey!  Very easy if you make them in the food processor - just don't overmix.

This tasted terrible.  The whole wheat flour gave it a heavy, strange taste.  I'm wondering if I did something wrong because this was uneatable.

Really, really good! :3 They're really good with vanilla ice cream ^__^ They're definitely not cake-like--they're more like some kind of brownie/pudding mutant, but it's totally fine that way! :3 Definitely making this again!

These are very good considering the main ingredient is tofu! I used a little less sugar and added an egg. I will definitely will make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out surprisingly well. I made a few alterations after reading reviews. I blended the tofu, oil and sugar in the blender before stirring it into the other dry ingredients. I used half white/half whole wheat flour, only 3/4 c cocoa powder, and an instant coffee mix that includes sugar and creamer. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 c white and 1 scant cup of brown. I don't like real sweet desserts, but it could have been a bit sweeter so I'll add more next time. Baked in an 8x8 pan for 40 min at 350. The result was a thick brownie. My husband thought it was pretty good. A good way to use tofu if you don't like to eat it in savory dishes. I couldn't taste it at all.

These turned out really well!  They were indeed much better the next day once they cooled and set more solidly.

I was surprised by these.  They were really very good - dense and fudgey.  My husband guessed that they had tofu in them but he still asked for seconds.

These were just acceptable. They weren't quite the fudgey bars I was expecting, rather they were kind of grainy and had more of a brownie texture. The flavor was good, however not really strong on the coffee.

Granted this was my first use of tofu in the kitchen.  My husband likes them.  No one else really does much but laugh about them.  Hopefully in some time my family will get more aquainted with tofu and warm up to it. ?

The texture is reallly good, chewy and dense. I honestly thought the coffee was a little too much, made it a little too bitter for my taste. I used olive oil and raw sugar since i didn't have the listed ingredients. I would probably use a chocolate mix to replace the coffee and add mint essance to mask the tofu flavour. Its best when eaten cold on the second day!! Its a recipe worth experimenting on! :)

I attempted this recipe with Whole Wheat Instabake, because  I had it on hand. Perhaps, as I've seen elsewhere the whole wheat flour needs to be refrigerated to keep  it from going rancid. This may be the trouble others have had without realizing it was bad 
flour. So much for initially wanting to use up   the Silken Tofu.

Ok, so I didn't have safflower oil and replaced it with vegetable oil and I had no idea what turbinado sugar was so I used Splenda and maybe that's why these were horrible.  I will not make these again.  I tricked my boyfriend into trying it.  Now he won't eat anything I make for fear that there's tofu in it.

Ugh. So excited to make these. Looked beautiful coming out of the oven. What a WRECK to get out of the pan. So many reviews commented on how moist they were, so I did drain the tofu, hoping that would help. It didn't. I even sprayed the pan to reduce sticking. This is a mess; there is no such thing as a 'bar' as its all an oooy goooy heap. Cannot serve or gift. What a disappointment. Maybe it can be used as a topping for something, but that's about it.

Fudgy, delicious and healthy!? This recipe is an absolute must. I made them with the full sugar amount and it was overwhelming; use 1 1/3 cup turbanido sugar and they will come out PERFECT. A+ recipe!

Just made these and they are so good! I didn't have silken tofu so I used what I had on hand - extra firm. I didn't have turbinado sugar so I used regular white cane sugar. I didn't have safflower oil so I used canola. These came out much better then expected and tasted real good! Will definitely make these again.

I tried this using splenda & raw caocao powder instead of cocoa powder & baked in an 8x8 pan. Didn't turn out well altho might be better with some Blue Bell vanilla icecream on it. I was hoping for a diabetic friendly dessert, but this isn't it. Very disappointed. Won't make it again.

I did not add the coffee and I made the full batch in a 9 inch pan. The second day the brownies tasted even better than the first. I cut the brownies into squares and froze them. The brownies froze great!

I'm not sure if this made a difference but I used tofu that had been previously frozen.  The texture was cakey...not fudgy.  I also took the advice from other reviewers and made it in a smaller pan.  They didn't rise at all and were very dry.
