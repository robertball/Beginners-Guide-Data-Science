Great recipe! I made this easy on myself and just used a box of couscous and followed the directions on the back. I then tossed in the garlic, red bell pepper, green onion and cherry tomato. I cut the amount of basil in half. I added a bit more balsamic and added 2 Tbsp. of grated Parmesan right to the mixture. I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes and then topped with some shredded Parmesan cheese. Overall, very good.

As others suggested, I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also quatered my cherry tomatoes, and had to substitute regular onion instead of green onions, and added more parmesian cheese than called for.  Overall, a great recipe, and my entire family loved it!

Made this for International Day at my sons school.  I never made couscous before but this was DELICIOUS!  Will be making this often for our family. I think this would make a great cold salad too the next day - as if there would BE any leftovers ! LOL
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Made this a few times now.  The 2nd time I made it I cooked the veggies well enough to omit the baking stage.  I dried out the dish too much and is really not necessary.  Once the veggies were *ALMOST* cooked through I added the boiling water and the couscous.  I used the "ready in 5 minutes" kind.  I added the cheese just prior to serving. It came out moist and used less  dishes! I continue to make it this way  and YES, it makes a nice cold lunch "salad" the next day.

5 stars because it's a super side dish that is quick and easy. This was a big hit with the adults at our house. I used chicken stock instead of water, omitted the red pepper, cut back on the oil and didn't use salt or pepper and it was great. I made it up to the oven part ahead a little bit and then popped it in the oven 20 before the rest of dinner was ready. I served this with Feta-Stuffed Chicken. It was a wonderful compliment since both recipes have fresh basil. Speaking of basil, I julienned it for this recipe.

Such an easy recipe and so versatile with the addition of whatever veggie happens to be lingering in your crisper drawer begging to be used. I did replace the water with chicken broth as I do in most recipes for more flavor.  Gave an extra "turn" of balsamic vinegar when adding my splash and grated fresh parmesan over the top as soon as I removed in from the oven.  Delicious as an accompanying side dish! Thank you NTREMPE for the submission.

This tasted wonderful - I'd add extra cheese to it and increase the bell peppers - maybe even double them.  Also it would be a good idea to chop the basil even though the recipe doesn't tell you to.

Delicious and easy! I used chicken broth instead of water (left out the salt because of it), green pepper instead of red (didn't have red), and half a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I didn't have fresh basil, but decided to do around 1/2 tbsp of Italian seasoning instead. This made for a very tasty lunch and I'm sure I'll make it again.

This is my new favorite recipe!  Modified this recipe a bit.  Used garlic chicken broth instead of water and added yellow squash, zucchini, and mushrooms (you really can throw any veggie in there.)  Spooned the end results into some peppers and made a vegetarian stuffed pepper.  So good, I'm eating the leftovers right now for lunch!

My family loved this, even my couscous hating husband.  It is really a beautiful dish, very pretty for company.  My only problem was I splashed a little too much balsamic vinegar on top so some of my couscous looked kind of dark.  Still, really good!

I loved this recipe. I used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth instead of 1 to make more moist and flavorful. I did not use tomatoes as I do not like them. I also used regular white onion rather then green onion and added more vinegar. Was VERY flavorful. If yours was not then add more vinegar, salt and pepper.

This tasted ok.  Kind of bland even though I used chicken stock instead of water to cook couscous and added a little extra balsamic.

Delicious! I used 1.5 times the cous cous, tripled the peppers, green onions and garlic, added extra parmesan cheese, and a liberal amount of balsamic vinegrette dressing. I also used chicken broth instead of water to cook the cous cous.  I decided not to bake the dish so I threw in some diced cucumbers as well.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add diced black olives too.

I've made as is, and it's fabulous.  The second time I left out the cherry tomatoes and instead added small slices of chanterelle mushrooms instead. OMG amazing.  Served with ratatouille on top and roasted chicken on the side for us meat-eaters.

Made this recipe as directed with the exception that I used whole wheat couscous.  Mediocre at best.  Family wasn't crazy for it and son and hubby didn't even finish eating their portion. I threw the rest away. I can't even think of a way to make it better - couscous just isn't something we're going to eat - it's boring and bland.

This is a great side dish that would work well with a very savory, flavorful main course.  I've found that adding 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. olive oil and 1 tsp. salt to the water for my 1 cup of couscous is a great way to make the whole dish more flavorful.  Since I wasn't eating this as a side I also increased the balsamic vinegar to about 1 tbsp. and increased the parm. cheese to 1/3 cup and that helped with the blandness that others have mentioned.  I love the basil and green onion in this dish, and I'm happy to have another way to make couscous.  Thanks!

Very good couscous recipe. Followed almost exactly, just used yellow bell pepper instead of red and used regular tomatoes. Only complaint this recipe makes just 3 portions, so next time I will definitely double the recipe.

I used white onions instead of green, feta cheese instead of Parmesan, and didn't add tomatoes (personal preference). I also didn't end up baking it because I wanted to cut out a step. We served it with a salad and the Blackened Salmon fillet recipe from this site. Delicious! My husband and I loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

We omitted tomatoes (we didn't have any on hand), added kale, zucchini and mushrooms (because they needed to be used in our fridge!).  This dish is delicious!  I highly recommend it.

Tomato couscous makes this dish a colorful side dish. I served it with fish and peas on a weeknight and it helped perk up the meal. Kids liked it too.

This is a great easy dish.  I made it along side some Hell's Kitchen Burgers (from theQualityCook.Com).  I didn't have green onions so I used some red onion.  I loved the flavor pop that the balsamic gave it.  I am sure I will be making this again over the summer!  Thanks Nancy.

This was okay...not fabulous, just okay.  I might make it again...perhaps using canned tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes???  Although, I did like the color in this one with green onions, red pepper, etc.

I used whole wheat couscous (which isn't that easy to find where I live), and rather than water, I used chicken broth for more flavor.  The couscous seemed to suck up the broth like a sponge, so I added a little more, as well as about 1/4c white wine (chardonnay).  To the veggies, I also added the juice of 1 lemon and skipped the balsamic.  Next time, I would double or triple the amount of green onion; it tasted great and there wasn't enough of it.  Rather than basil, I used cilantro, as it seemed to go better with the chicken piccata we had tonight.  I skipped the time in the oven altogether; think it would have been way way too dry.  I would make this again with these changes.

We loved this couscous.  We used whole wheat couscous and cooked it in veggie broth for some extra flavor.  All that basil was delicious!  Yum!

Added a bit more red bell pepper, and halved the cherry tomatoes.  Also added salt and pepper and omitted the Parmesan because we didn't have any.  This was light and delicious.  Served with the Mediterranean Salmon recipe from this site.  Thanks for a quick and tasty side dish.

Made with Tri-Color couscous which are huge in comparison to regular couscous, but I love the extra color and the texture. Also used twice as much couscous and water/broth combination, adding approx the recipe's chopped veggies, herbs & vinegar quantities. Used mixed peppers and cilantro instead of basil (not growing well yet). Also didn't bake as other reviewers suggested. Sauteed 1st, then added & brought water to a boil, added couscous, returned to simmer, covered and let set about 10 minutes until all water was absorbed. Added tomatoes, cilantro and vinegar. Ate some hot. No will power, then fridge until dinner at the pool. Delicious. 

Can be used as a basic recipe with just about any veggies dependent on water %. I think I'd like to experiment a bit with edamame or baby peas along w/ the tomatoes and maybe a bit of soy instead of balsalmic. I'm thinking it might feel like I'm eating caviar with the big tri-colore couscous.

Made this for a large group of people on my annual ski trip. It was just delicious, and got rave reviews from the group! For the folks who say it's bland, I'd really recommend you add some *ahem* seasoning to the pot.Salt and pepper to start. The only reason a pot of food will STAY bland is because you let it!

Only thing I didnt do is bake it...didn't have time for all that. Based on that ,when the couscous finished cooking, I just stirred the hand-grated parmesan into the pot. It provided an EXCELLENT depth of flavor! Will absolutely make again.

Doubled recipe. Used vegetable broth instead of water. Added about 1/3 cup chopped fennel. Didn't include parmesan cheese (since eating with tilapia with basil cream sauce). David loved. Went back for 2nds.

This has been a favorite family recipie since we discovered it while trying to find a way to spice up our couscous. I'm usually not to picky about following the recipie exactly (I use white onions instead of green onions and green bell pepper instead of red bell pepper when needed). The balsamic vinegar is a MUST and I always, always throw in some extra garlic. I prefer my couscous to be on the drier side, so I cook it in a pan longer and skip the oven to save time.

This is an awesome couscous recipe.  I made the following changes: (1) I used a whole red bell pepper (because I always want to add veggies to a dish) and it was perfect; (2) I cut the cherry tomatoes in half; (3) I used chicken stock instead of water to cook the couscous.  I forgot to add salt and pepper and it still tasted great.  It is awesome to find a flavorful couscous recipe because it can be a boring grain.

This was pretty good! I followed this recipe almost as written...I was going to add veggie stock...and forgot. I used grated white cheddar and diced heirloom tomatoes which I thought made it moist and added a great flavour (perfect with the basil, balsamic, and white cheddar.) 
Without the stock I did find I used extra salt and even put in a bit of Old Bay. I would make this again

The Cous Cous is cooked after standing for 5 minutes.  Fluff with a fork, then add the other ingredients and it is table-ready, either warm or cold. Absolutely no need to bake it.  Other good additions are Feta cheese and toasted pine nuts (pignoli, also known as pinoli).  Enjoy.

Made with whole wheat couscous and tasty tom tomatoes,this was an excellent, colorful side dish.  For a richer version, water can be replaced with chicken stock, but we didn't feel it was necessary.

This needed extra seasoning in our opinion.    I browned some turkey kielbasa and stirred the slices in with the couscous and veggie mixture.  My husband liked it much better after he added hot sauce.

I thought that this was very good—I used whole wheat couscous—trying to build up fiber here—and for once, stuck to the recipe. I topped it with some rotisserie chicken, more of the tomatoes and slivered basil and we had a fine one dish meal. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good, colorful and nice way to have warm couscous.  Served it for company and was a big hit.  Just a couple of pointers: use all chicken broth and at a ratio of 1and1/2 cup to 1 cup of couscous. If it's still hard, add a little hot water at a time to soften (it should be soft before baking).  Also, stir in the balsamic vinegar before baking.  Served it without the cheese and was great.

This is a family favourite. I use chicken stock instead of water to cook the cous cous, add 1/2 cup of fresh basil and have used both with and without the grated parmesan. It is delicious both ways. Super accompaniment to a summer barbeque.

The balsamic gave a good flavor, but it might have been better to mix it in instead of splashing on top.

Also, it came out very dry.

I skipped the bell peppers and added more cherry tomatoes.  We liked this, but baking it did not make much of a difference.  Next time, I will saute all the veggies and mix in the couscous with a sprinkling of cheese.

This was good, but not something I really loved.  It was fast, easy and healthy though, and I did enjoy it.  I used whole wheat couscous, chicken broth, a whole bell pepper (orange), and yellow, orange, and red tomatoes.  I really didn't see the point of baking it.  All that does is dry it out (even covered).  I wouldn't have baked it at all, but I did for a few minute just because dinner wasn't ready yet.

Only used green peppers, frozen peas and dried basil.  Used more balsamic then stated but could not taste it.  Also, I used veg stock instead of water.  Husband and 19 month old loved it.  Will use this as a base recipe in the future with different veggies added in.

It turned out good, however the recipe does not say to cook covered or uncovered.  I cooked mine covered.  Next time, also, I'll chop the basil leaves.  Needed salt and I couldn't taste the basalmic so I don't know if it even helps the flavor.

This was very good!  I made it with Asparagus Chicken from this site for company and it was delicious!  I cooked it exactly as the recipe stated but instead of water I used chicken broth.  I recieved rave reviews.  It smelled wonderful cooking and it is great to make ahead of time and finish in the oven.  This recipe is a keeper.

LOVED this recipe!  I tried the recipe but substituted quinoa for the couscous.  I also had to use dried basil instead of fresh.  I left off the balsamic vinegar because my husband despises vinegar taste. I cooked the quinoa per directions on the package, substituting chicken broth for water as many others recommended. The dish was a hit!  A great accompaniment to lamb!!

A big hit with our family.  This time I doubled the recipe to take into account teen-induced snacking so that I could have some to bring for lunch.  Used chicken stock in place of water.  Substituted chopped vine tomatoes & chopped parsley instead of basil as that’s what I had on hand.  You can add any sautéed vegetable - very versatile recipe.

I enjoyed the recipe, but added feta cheese instead of Parmesan cheese, plus added some Italian vegetables that come in a jar (they're marinated). These added a lot of flavor.  Some Greek olives.  I like to use sea salt.  I served it cold as a salad. My girls loved it. - Smithson

I've made Company Couscous twice so far. They ONLY thing I changed was using chicken broth instead of water and I used about 1 1/2 cups; not 1 cup. Okay two things...Great recipe...very good. I served this as a side dish to my Alaska style Halibut...DEVINE!

Loved this recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  I added some shallots, mushrooms, and substituted a large tomato for the cherry tomatoes.  Skipped the oven part, didn't want to take the extra step so just let the couscous cook a little longer about 10mint.  To the boiling water added a pinch of chicken bouillon, pepper, and onion powder. Once you get the recipe down you can add other veggies and aromatics.

This is ok, but a little bland.  Since there's not an overpowering flavor in it, it makes a good side.  Would go well with something spicy because it would absorb the spice and cleanse the palate.  Not hard to make at all.

I found this recipe several years ago and have been working with it ever since. I usually use the fresh veggies I have in my fridge.  Today I added celery, carrots, mushrooms, and turnips. I saute everything and cook the couscous separately with chicken bouillon. I love it.  Today was the first time I made it in the oven, with feta on top and a drizzle of Italian dressing. I love the versatility of this recipe! Thanks!

Made it as is except I used yellow onion instead of green. My husband loved it! We expected more flavor because it was so colorful but decided the light, fresh taste deserved 4 stars.

We cooked this for our "Food of the World Night", my daughter randomly picks a country, researches it and tells me and my husband the facts about it over a dinner made form that country and dessert prepared by my husband from the same place. We did "Algeria" and loved this recipe. The four stars is for the fact I will change it a bit next time, by adding garlic and replacing the cherry tomatoes for diced roma. The cherry tomatoes were a bit too much of a mouth full and you didn't receive a very consist taste because of it.

This is a SUPER fantastic, super quick & easy, and super tasty recipe! I followed it almost exactly (which, admittedly, I never do). Substitutions: Boiled couscous in Low-Sodium Vegetable Broth; used about 1/4 of a yellow onion instead of green onion; used frozen chopped basil instead of fresh basil. Also, I used more like a couple drizzles of balsamic (than a dash), which at first I thought I had over-done, but actually any less would have been too bland! 5 star recipe for sure!

This was incredibly bland and I like couscous.  Might have been better if not put in the oven and kept the stronger flavors, but I'm not willing to try it again.  Very disappointing.

This was my first experience  cooking couscous so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I found it to be rather bland as another rater commented.  Perhaps it is supposed to be bland?  I may look for another recipe so that I have something to compare it with

Delicious!  I used pearl couscous and cooked based on the package and also used chicken brother.  I didn't have cherry tomatos so I used chopped tomato.  Did the rest of the recipe as written.  Very good!

Instead of water used vegetable broth.  Used 1/2 Tablespoon of balsalmic vinegar.  I used 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese and it was too much.  Next time I will stick with the 1/4 cup.

I was not overly excited about this recipe. It had great potential, and I followed it to a "t" however after baking it was a tad bland. It worked out well as I served a nice Indian Chole over it to give it flavor, however, by itself it was only so-so.   If I make it as a stand-alone dish, I think I will double up on all of the ingredients (except for the couscous) to see if that helps liven it up some.

Very good!  I had to change it slightly due to some lack of ingredients. I used about 1/4 of a white onion, 1 can of diced tomatoes (I drained the juice out), 1T dried basil, 1t Italian seasoning, and about 1 3/4 cup of chicken broth.  It definitely needed more than 1 cup of water.  I also used an entire red pepper. Overall, I really enjoyed it!  Next time I will try to use fresh basil instead, I think that would add a lot to the dish.  It was still very good with the dried herbs, but nothing competes with fresh herbs!

Made this and Feta and Sun Dried Tomato Stuffed Chicken (from this site) last night with a great friend and then watched Julie & Julia.  It was a great side dish!  Omitted the olives and added feta cheese once out of the oven.

I loved this recipe!!! My husband had never had couscous before and he ate the entire pot of this!! (I did cut the recipe to only 3 servings!) The only changes I made were: I used whole wheat couscous, chicken stock instead of water, extra garlic, yellow onion instead of green and omitted the tomatoes because my husband doesn't really like them. I served them with my Cumin Meatballs...absolutely delicious!! I will certainly make this again!

Yummy!  Very easy to make!  I added more salt and balsamic vinegar since I was afraid of it being too bland.  I think next time I make it, I'll add white onions as well and use chicken broth instead of water.

This was reallt good and healthy! I used chicken broth in place of water and 1 cup worked just fine. I did not think it was too dry as others had mentioned. I also used less of the olive oil and omitted the parmesan cheese just because I thought it tasted great without it.

What a great way to make couscous!  My husband hasn't been a fan in the past, but he loved this recipe. Very tasty, yet very healthy too!  The balsamic vinegar adds a nice extra flavor (I used more than the recipe called for since I love it).

I liked this recipe very much.  As others have said, there is no need to bake it.  It's table ready right out of the pan and it's such a pretty, colorful dish to serve company.   I also used chicken broth in place of the water and I didn't have any fresh basil left so I used 1/4 cup of dried basil.  It was great!

Not as fast as a boxed couscous with seasoning -- but much better tasting and much more healthy.  I even had to make it with frozen chopped red peppper and dried basil and yellow onion since that is what I had on hand and it was still oh so good (though not as pretty).  This is our new favorite side with salmon.

I wish I did take a picture of this one, because it is a beautiful and colorful dish.  
I was skeptical, because I do not normally enjoy cous cous, but this Italian twist on it was great.
I did add more parmesan than called for.

I added chopped green peppers and baby portabella mushrooms, used roma instead of cherry tomatoes, and substituted chicken broth for water.  It turned out great!  My husband loved it and it smells great when cooking.  I think that the chicken broth really helped add flavor.

I really like this recipe because it's different. I don't normally make couscous, so this is a nice way to incorporate it into our meals. I loved the fresh basil (from my container garden...yum!) along with the tomatoes, onion and garlic, but I'm on the fence about the balsamic. I think next time I might try using chicken/veggie broth instead of water and skipping the balsamic. That's just me though! Loved the parm on top - yummy!

I scaled this down for two and think I could have done with just a little more water as soon as I put the couscous in the boiling water and returned it to the heat it started boiling again. After leavin it to stand it was still a little bit hard. It did make a lovely side dish though but I left out the parmesan just didn't seem right. Thanks

I didn't think this was fast or easy. The taste was OK...somehow the parmesan cheese just wasn't a good 'fit'...if I make it again, I'll use monterey jack. Mine was kinda dry and I added extra water too!

My husband and guests loved this recipe.  I added mushrooms and substituted a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies for the fresh tomatoes.  The chilies added a nice spicy punch.  This was served with tilapia baked in the oven with olive oil and fresh parsely, and a romaine lettuce with sliced garlic salad. A delicious meal. Thanks for the recipe!

I won't give this less than three stars, because it's possible that I did something wrong, but I'm not sure what it was.  The couscous was hard and grainy-- I actually had to dump the casserole (AFTER it had been cooked) back into a pot and boil it-- veggies, couscous and all.  This softened it a little, but I had to add tomatoe sauce and cheese in the end-- I think this recipe would be fairly bland even when it turns out right the first time.

This was a good dish but the kids not too fond of it. Was very fast and easy. Made it the night before and baked right before serving.

My family loved this recipe.  I didn't have Couscous in the house at the time so substituted Orzo and it worked just great!

This recipe was followed to the T and it turned out amazing. Though, I preferred the taste till it was cooked on the gas. After baking it, the top layer of couscous became extra dry and hard to chew. Maybe I baked it for 5 minutes extra so it could be my fault. But overall the taste was too good.

We rarely eat couscous as it tends to be bland.  NOT this one!  Would make again and again.  Followed recipe with the change of vegie stock for water.  The parm cheese added dimension.  Served with the Fricken Paprika Chicken from this site.

Something seems to be missing in this recipe. And I'm just wondering if putting it in the oven for 20 minutes dries it out too much.

Great flavor, although I did make some changes.  I left out the balsamic vinegar, as I thought the flavor boost would have been unnecessary with the simple garlic/salt/pepper chicken with which the dish was served.  I also did not wish to add an extra 20-30 minutes to the cook time, so I melted the Parmesan over the sauteed vegetables while the couscous finished cooking, then mixed it all together.  Will definitely make this again.

AMAZING! I was a bit skeptical at first as I haven't always been a big  fan of couscous but this recipe redeemed it for me! Loaded with veggies, this is a very healthy dish you can feel good about eating, the only culprit being a little parmesan cheese.  Very tasty. Definitely doesn't serve 4 though, 2-3 if you're lucky.

Definitely substitute the water for chicken broth. So much more taste added that way. I didn't even bake it, casserole style. I just sauteed and steamed for a few extra minutes each. Really good recipe! And Easy too!

I didn't have any couscous on hand, so I substituted orzo, which worked very well.  I also added a chicken breast which had been chopped fine and browned. This made it a perfect main dish meal for two.  I'm sure I will be making this again!

I didn't have couscous so used Orzo and we both loved it.  I probably sautéed the pepper and onions more than the recipe said and had to use dried basil.  Next time I'll use less olive oil to sauté the vegetables though.

I made this dish to serve with a chicken tagine for a large dinner party of 16 people. It was the perfect combination of favors. The best part was I was able to prepare it before hand then put it in the oven 20 minutes before we ate so I wasn't in the kitchen during cocktails!

This recipe was DELICIOUS1 I am always looking for new, easy, tasty and healthy side dishes. This fit the bill precisely! It *did* need at least 1 1/3 C water for the couscous. ;-)

Delicious! I took this to a picnic and received lots of compliments.  There was just enough left to take for lunch the next day.   The only alteration I made was using dried basil.

Great way to dress up couscous! You can, of course, substitute veggies willy-nilly on this one if you like! I used heirloom tomatoes, red pepper, and fresh basil. I didn't even bake it (just sauteed everything, mixed with couscous, and grated fresh parm-reg over top). Totally forgot about the balsamic but I bet that would have given it a great tang. Next time!

Good, easy to make. I did some substitutions on it and it turned out good. My lady wasn't a huge fan of couscous, but I love it and I have plenty of leftovers. My only complaint is that it was a bit dry, but I can fix that by adding more broth (which I subbed for water).

This was good.  I didn't have fresh basil, so substituted it with another herd, fresh parsley.  Instead of Parmesan cheese, I topped the finished dish with feta cheese and I think that added more flavour and depth to the dish.  The dish was not very flavourful, so I added alot of Italian seasoning.  If I make this again, I will cook the couscous in broth.

Made this (kinda). Didn't have green onions. Diced one small onion. Did not have red pepper so omitted. Didn't have basil so used oregano (teaspoon for my taste). Omitted salt. Sauteed onion & garlic for 5 minutes. Then added the tomatoes, which I quartered. Sauteed that for 2 minutes. Added the oregano and cooked couscous.
Will be making this again. You can vary this anyway you like

Absolutely delicious! This will be a perfect addition to holiday meals, but also works great for any night. A definite keeper. My 1 and 3 year old boys inhaled this (I did too :) ). Following another post, I subbed Italian seasoning for the basil and used vegetable stock instead of water. I also subbed red wine for the vinegar (I was out) and I forgot to about the parm until we had finished. It was still the best couscous I've ever had.

Delicious!  I like the way the veggies were sauteed before baking which really brought out their flavor.  I used white balsamic vinegar and didn't have the cherry tomatoes so I just chopped up 2 romas.  This was good, thanks!!!

So good! I'm not sure how much a "dash" of balsamic vinegar is, but whatever I did (I'd call it a "glug") was fine. You really can't screw it up. I did not even bake this- I simply added the cooked veggies and broth (instead of water) to the couscous, stirred it, and covered it for 10 minutes. I also used dry basil instead of fresh, and orange pepper instead of red (store was out of red). This came out so delicious. I don't usually like tomatoes, but they were perfect in this recipe!

This pretty good. I chose to saute my veggies in EVOO first (yellow onions, garlic, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, sun-dried tomatoes, black olives & parsley) then added seasoning (pepper, seasoned salt and Italian seasoning) and at the end added the couscous and water; cooked until done. Mixed the Parmesan straight into the dish. Skipped the balsamic vinegar (didn't have any). I would cook the couscous separately next time though. Complimented 'Fish Fillets Italiano' (from AR) very well.

Really a deliciously falvorful dish.  I love how quickly it goes together.  I would say you could definitely serve it without baking.  Just toss all ingredients together in the pan, heat through and serve.

This was good! I subbed green pepper for the red because that's what I had. Also, I was in a hurry, so I didn't bother baking this in the oven, just combined everything in the pot and served. We enjoyed the flavors in this and it was very easy to put together. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Tasty!  Made it as is except it really doesn't need to be baked in the oven.  Save the energy and time and serve right out of the skillet.  It was a hit with the kids and the hubby.  Couscous can be bland but this was delicious.

I make this for my family all the time.  I omit the pepper because my family is allergic to them, and I omit the cheese to make it vegan for me.  I don't measure and just throw whatever is handy together and it always comes out good.  I reduce the amount of basil, also.

I used chicken broth in place of the water.  I gave this a 3 rating as I found it  dry.  I added about 2 more tablespoons of olive oil and that helped a bit.  I cut the basil in half as I too felt 1 c would be too much.  Next time I will add about 2-3  tablespoons of oil before it goes into the oven.

We loved this. I modified a bit by using 1 1/4 c. chicken stock instead if 1 c. water, used 5 scallions, c. grape tomatoes halved, more garlic, half a red pepper and more than a dash of balsamic vinegar. The fresh basil is key and I shredded it. Don't skip the oven though you may be tempted..melds the flavers. YUM We served it with potato crusted tilapia (Publix recipe- very good)

We used instant couscous and skipped the baking part. Unless you really want softer tomatoes, I don't think the oven is necessary for this recipe. I actually imagine that it may dry the dish out. Thanks for the great recipe.

Anyone expecting a taste sensation from couscous has never had it before--it is bland!!! But this recipe is very tasty with the additions included.  Some tweeking needed-- use 3/4 cup couscous instead of 1, use chicken broth in place of the water, add a little more red peppers, quarter the cherry tomatoes, chop the basil leaves and use at least 1/4 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. Sprinkle with Parmesan in the skillet--no additional baking needed. This dish is a nice side to grilled chicken or salmon.

I followed the recipe as written and thought it was pretty bland. Couscous definitely needed to be cooked in chicken stock, but not sure if that would have fixed the problem.

This was my first time making couscous. It wasn't bad. I thought there would be more flavor to it, cause it looked so flavorfull and pretty but it was still a little bland. After my mom and I started to eat it I added some crushed canned tomatoes to it to try and add some more flavor. I felt it helped a bit. I will definatly try to make another couscous recipe.

This really was good cous cous!  Everyone commented on how light and fresh it tasted and that it was a nice change from same old potatoes or rice pilaf.  The balsamic and parmesan really made this dish.

I scaled this recipe up and made it for a dinner party.  It was really easy to make and tasted wonderful.  No one left any behind on their plate--yummy!

It was a good side dish but nothing too special. kudos for different though.  Next time I will use some chicken broth if I have it on hand.  I will also add in some corn and chopped sweet onions too.

Very good, healthy, and quick.  I cut the cherry tomatoes in halves and mixed extra parmesan into the couscous as well as added it on top.  I'm not sure why you need to bake it; I think it could probably go right from the stovetop to the table.  I also cooked the couscous in chicken broth and think that next time I would add a little italian seasoning.

We were out of the vinegar and it still turned out great.  Not sure how people think this is bland!  I did use chicken broth, and fresh basil!  We loved it!  I will make this again!  Thanks for a quick & easy recipe!

made a few changes; used veggie broth instead of water and used white onions instead of  green. Pretty good. Hubby liked it, to my surprise:)

Needed a quick side dish.  Served this with steak and salad - and it really went over well.  I didn't have tomatoes or enough fresh basil, but it didn't seem to matter.    The couscous was very flavorful.  I got lots of compliments!

I didn't add the green pepper so maybe that's what was missing. Extra balsamic, cooking the couscous in broth and pepper helped add some flavor. Kind of bland.

Very bland. I think we would have been better off doing couscous out of a box mix from the market.

i wasn't really impressed with this one.  I followed the directions exactly expect for water, added chicken stock and i thought there should have been more stock than the 1 cup to the 1 cup of couscous.  I did not have any tomatoes but had the rest and when done, i found it rather bland and dry and even a tad bit crunchy i guess you could say.  Maybe the key ingrediant is the tomatoe which i didn't have? i think for now i will stick to just adding some olive oil and ramano cheese to my couscous until i find something that really grabs me!  Thanks anyhow though.

Good, very easy.  Made is with parmesan tilipia from this site (also very good).  It's also good cold, as leftovers.

Easy and delicious - you can't go wrong - served when the guys were having "head on" trout and the girls were having chicken and went great with both.  Loved it!

I thought this recipe was pretty good but my husband turned his nose up at it. I enjoyed it but I'll probably never make it again--too much effort for a mediocre result.

Loved this recipe. Did not use cheese or balsamic vinegar. I only had dried basil leaves on hand so used that and also added extra chicken stock before baking in oven. Family loved this recipe.

I don't know if this would be a 5 if I made it the way it says. I changed some of the methods used. I did not cook any of the vegetables (pepper, scallions, tomatoes). I removed the seeds from the tomatoes and cut them into quarters. For the parm. cheese and the basil, I decided to make homemade pesto (basil, olive oil, cheese,garlic cloves, pines nuts) added to a smidgen of mayo. I tossed that with the veggies. Then I added the cooked couscous in batches (to incorporate evenly) and added balsamic at the end. Complete heaven. Never made couscous before SO EASY!!!

My company enjoyed this dish a lot.  I couldn't get fresh basil, so I ended up using dry, it was good just the same.  Also, i ommitted the tomatoes b/c my husband doesn't like them, but it probably would have been better with them.
