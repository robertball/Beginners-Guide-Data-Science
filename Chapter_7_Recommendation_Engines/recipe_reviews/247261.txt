For grandkids coming in a few days.  I sprinkled mini M&M’s on top and pressed them in.  SO pretty!  Made a double batch and put in my old 10” X  15” pan.  Looks about 1” thick.  
I only put 2 C of flour and 1 1/2 cup of  mixture of Quick and Old Fashioned oatmeal.

I don't make sweets very often, but these cookie bars seemed to have lots of things we all like.  
I followed the recipe as written, but it seemed dry while mixing the ingredients.  I baked it anyway, and though the results taste good, they are definitely a little drier than we like.  As I don't bake things like this normally, I am not sure what to recommend or add.
Rating - 4 for taste, but only 3 for overall result.

I used milk chocolate chips and butterscotch because I had them on hand. Good recipe. Bonus is it calls for ingredients you usually have on hand. Only change I made was using a little more vanilla extract.

Super easy and yummy coolie bars for kids!  My 4 year old was able to make this recipe.  One word of caution- don’t overbake as they become a bit crumbly.

Family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly.
For me it was a little too dry. Next time I might add some applesauce to the recipe to moisten it.

After reading some of the reviews, I made this recipe with an extra egg and didn't think they were too dry. The batter is certainly thick, though. Excellent recipe, and easy to make.

I added an extra egg and left out the peanut butter because when I was mixing it before I added the extra egg it was super dry. I didn't add the PB partly because I was on a time crunch and partly because I thought it would dry it out even more. And they ended up tasting phenomenal!!

Followed directions and they were way to dry.
