This cauliflower recipe is remarkable.  I follow it pretty much as it reads and have now made it twice and after the first time shared with my mom who entertains all the time and she loved it as well.  I'm in Wisconsin so fresh dill is nonexistence for at least half of the year but a tsp. of dill weed works very nicely.  My husband and I both agree that after this last one, we need to get two heads of cauliflower, we obviously do not play well when it comes to this dish and need one to call our own.

I've been wanting to roast cauliflower for some time now and am very happy to have found this recipe.  I loved that I could roast the whole head intact instead of having to cut it into florets.  I did use low-fat butter (Land O' Lakes spreadable) and used 1 t. dried dill instead of 1 T. fresh dill.  The seasoning combination was great.

I followed the recipe exactly and we've been eating this regularly. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Loved cauliflower before. Love it even more now! The whole family looks forward to eating it. Making it again tonight!

I like the basic premise of this recipe, but I like the cauliflower cut up and then placed in a plastic bag with marinade ingredients and shaken.  The inside of the cauliflower tasted steamed when I cooked it whole.

I used coconut butter instead because I didn't want the whole house to be smoky from cooking it in the oven. I also mixed all the ingredients with plain yogurt to allow it to seal in the juices. I think it would be even better if you use mayo. But if you use just the seasoning I think it would be too dry.

I just posted pics of my roasted cauliflower. This turned out perfectly. If you serve it while hot it is moist and wonderful. Not sure about leftovers, we didn't have any. So I guess that's a good sign.

I like this dish. I've never used cumin, lemon zest, and dill together. I liked the depth of flavor it gave to this vegetable.

My cauliflower was huge, so this recipe didn't work for me at all.  The flavor of the butter spread was great, but I cooked for 1.5 hours and it was still practically raw when it was time to eat it.  Then, I took the foil off and cooked it for another half hour at 375 degrees and it finally was good, but not great.  I guess this recipe calls for a very small head, but in that case, it's not worth all the fuss; I'd rather just steam it and pour this butter/spice mixture over the pieces.

This recipe is sooo good!  I had to make some changes because I didn't have everything on hand.
My changes: I used 1 teaspoon dried dill instead of fresh. I used 1 teaspoon garlic paste instead of a garlic clove. And I didnt have lemon zest,  so I used a 1/2 teaspoon of dried lemon zest.
Instead of baking it whole...I cult it into florets,  tossed it all together in a ziplock bag, then baked in a greased baking dish. Baked 450 degrees for 30 minutes (stir 1/2 way through).

Recipe is great..I am not a fan of DILL so I used chives instead and as on reviewer suggested using mayo to keep it from being to dry would probably work great..
I think some reviewers are missing the whole idea of the recipe in that that it totally looses the really great idea and purpose to roast it whole and serve by slices...its a way more dramatic eye appeal and it gives the cauliflower alot of flavor from seasoning but also the actual taste of cauliflower maintains its integrity!  Fyi there are several recipes out there with different seasonings and you could exchange those with pretty much any other seasonings/flavors.. perfect dish to bring to a party! Eye-catching for a social event and dressing up such a simple healthy vegetable. Thanks for sharing!

The presentation of this dish is gorgeous. My whole family loved this dish. I substituted olive oil for butter keeping the measurement the same. I also cooked it for 1.5 hours.

This was delish, but I did make a few adjustments.  I used dried dill weed, as I didn't have fresh and roasted it uncovered at 400 for an hour.  Not sure why the recipe says to cover it, because it won't get brown if you do. I basted it a few times while cooking and squeezed some fresh lemon juice on top right at the end. Anyhow, overall it is a delicious recipe with a unique flavor profile that totally works.  Thanks for posting.

I made this for Thanksgiving today and it was outstanding.  I didn't have room for it in the oven since the turkey was in there and it says to cook for a little over an hour, so I but it in the microwave for 15 minutes and then when the turkey was done I put it in the oven for 25 minutes covered and added a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese over the top (also I used lemon pepper instead of lemon zest and pepper since I didn't have lemon zest on hand). Was sooo good!  Will differently be making this again!!

Absolutely Delicious!! It didn't last long at all. The fresh dill and garlic is a great mix. Only thing I changed was instead of baking for the time given...I steamed my head of cauliflower for about 30 minutes before baking. It really cut the bake time in half and held a lot more of the moisture.

Perfect! Even my 2 year old ate it all. I didn't have lemon so I used grapefruit zest and it was amazing. I don't think you can wrong. I did cut the florets off and shake them in a ziploc with the marinade before roasting for 15-20 minutes but everything else was true as listed. SOOOOO good.

This was sooo good, but I made lots of changes.  Doubled the garlic and cumin, did half butter half olive oil, squeezed a few lemon wedges into the sauce, broke half a cauliflower into florets and quartered two chicken breasts.  Threw it all in a ziplock bag together and shook shook shook.  Dumped into a casserole dish and baked at 450 for 10 minutes, mixed it around and flipped the chicken, and baked for 10 minutes more.

For those who like their cauliflower softer, I bake mine at 375 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.  I think it is delicious.  I like to spice mine with lemon pepper.

Made it exactly as written, but maybe my oven needs adjusting as the cauliflower remained pretty raw, so neither of us really enjoyed it all that much even though we are cauliflower fans. I didn't give up though! Took leftovers to work the next day and had to use a microwave to reheat it (that's all we have at work), which I did for about 5 min on high. DELICIOUS! It just had to get completely done - I will do this again, but I will adjust my oven to get it cooked through this time. I'll bet I give 5 stars next time! Thanks for a beautiful and flavorful cauliflower idea!

This is glorious.  I never knew I liked cauliflower until this recipe came along.  I've tried it every different way from Sunday (steamed, mashed, covered in cheese) and hated the stuff.  I roasted it with this recipe and ate the entire head myself.  Now when I make this recipe, I make a whole head for me and a head for everyone else to share.  
Then only changes that I made were that I use olive oil instead of butter and I cut the florets off and roast them in a pan.  Truly wonderful dish with a great meld of flavors.

I love roasted cauliflower, but to cut down on the calories I used light mayo to cover the cauliflower.  It was excellent and moist, all other herbs are good to use.  Top with either lemon or lime juice.

Perfectly delicious!  I did separate the cauliflower into smaller pieces because I wanted each to be coated with the marinate, and I also didn't have time to do the longer roasting period that a whole head requires.  I will make this again and again!

This is amazing. My little tweeks were after melting 1/4 C butter, I added a squeeze of lemon and 2 Tbsp of pesto sauce.  Poured it over the cauliflower and baked as directed.  I will try the original recipe as I love all the flavors shown. Love the easiness of this recipe not to mention the taste. So much better than just steaming.

This was good. I made it exactly as written except that I cooked it in my Dutch oven with the lid, not foil. I think the next time I might add some cayenne pepper and a little less cumin. And if I’d have left it in the oven for the whole  time it would have been mushy so check for doneness as it cooks. Mine was done in an hour.

This was really good! I followed some other reviewer's changes and cut the cauliflower into florets, then tossed them in a bag with olive oil instead of butter. Also used dried dill. Baked at 450 for about 25 minutes uncovered, stirring halfway through.

Delish!  Easy, but be mindful of the cooking time.  It was fully roasted at 60 minutes and I kept it on a hold temp of 200 before serving (approximatly 1 hour longer)  My guests and family LOVED this.  Thank You

I made this tonight and loved it!  It didn't cook all the way through so I microwaved it for two minutes and it was perfect! Like other commenters, I was unable to find fresh dill so I used dry.  Will definitely make this again.  I was wondering if this would work in a slow cooker.  Anybody try that?

I made pretty close to as written.  The only change that had been done was with the lemon.  I forgot to pick one up so used just a few drops of lemon juice.

Took a little longer to cook in the oven but was worth the wait was a wonderful flavour.   

Great receipt.

We really enjoyed this. Had a larger head of cauliflower so it took an extra 15 minutes to cook. No big deal. Be careful not to soften the butter too much or it drips off of the cauliflower into the baking pan. Dill is one of my favorites and added a little more. Was worried about the mix of Cumin and cauliflower.  Don’t skip it!  It was great. Who would’ve thought?  Nice roasted cauliflower side dish. We had with a pork chop with mushroom dish from this site and it was a nice pairing. Thanks for sharing.

Just ok. Spices do not penetrate the cauliflower. I think slicing into “steaks” and coating it with spices would be more flavorful

Who has 2 hours to roast a whole cauliflower?? Used all the seasonings listed in the recipe but melted the butter, added the seasonings, chopped that sucker up and tossed it in the seasoned butter. Spread evenly on a lined and sprayed baking sheet, roasted at 350° for 30 mins, tossed, then cranked it up to 450° for 10 more. You can keep it super simple and just use garlic, salt and pepper in the butter or even olive oil. Great flavor!!!

This was very tasty, but it definitely took longer to cook.  More like 2 hours. I increased my oven temp to 375 and took of enough flowerets for dinner, then put back. Depends on size of head. I would probably cut up and roast on a tray next time. Seasoning was great. Thank you!

I used Olive oil instead of the butter and added extra seasonings. It was very good. Next time I will bake it longer due to high altitude cooking.

Loved this idea. Popped it in the Weber to cook resting with a piece of foil underneath to catch the melting butter - could even put a bit of grated Parmesan through that butter as well (next time) as it’s a keeper.

I was so excited about this but it just didn't come out as good as I thought.  At the end of 3 hours of roasting, I added some water to the dish and it finally finished cooking.  Also, I am used to sauteed veggies with just a little oil and salt because I like the taste of the veggies themselves.  Therefore the added butter, garlic, and herbs was too much for me.  I might try this again to see if it comes out better next time.  TBD!

Tried to follow the recipe without changes. Cauliflower was bland. All the seasoning dripped off the cauliflower while cooking. Good texture on the cauliflower through.

After reading reviews I decided to switch things up. I used a small head of cauliflower, olive oil, turmeric, cumin, garlic powder, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Baked covered at 350 for 1.5 hours. Will definitely make again.

Very delicious! The whole family loved it. Only changes were I removed the foil with 20 minutes to go so it would brown more, then I squeezed half of a lemon over the cauliflower and added some lemon-pepper on top right at the very end. Next time, I'll add a tablespoon or two more butter or oil so I can more easily baste at the end.

My husband likes cauliflower (I don’t) and I’m always looking for new ways to make it. This is by far my favorite. The cauliflower had some crunch left to it and great flavor. I enjoyed it as much as he did!

I enjoyed the spices but I would separate the florets to cover more of the cauliflower

This is a simple and great way to enjoy cauliflower. I dropped the dill and used about 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper in place of the black pepper along with a little turmeric. I like 'playing' with herbs so I have a feeling it will be a little different each time I make it.  So good, so easy.

I've tried two different size cauliflowers and both weren't done at 1.25 hrs.  It was closer to 1hr 45 min for the larger one. Going to try a different recipe to see what happens. Flavor wasn't bad though. I added some parmesian cheese and added 10 min uncovered.

Not very impressed with this recipe. The seasoning was good, but I baked for one and a half hours and it was still raw on the inside. It was an average cauliflower. Would've been better if I quartered it, but defeats the presentation purpose. I made cauliflower fritters with the leftovers.

Very good, and simple. I doubled the garlic but stuck to the recipe otherwise. Next time I'll probably take the foil off 1/2 way through, to try for a slightly crispier finish.  For those who said that 1/2 a stick of softened butter was not enough, I suggest using your (clean, of course) fingers to spread the seasoned butter, rather than a brush that will hang on to a good proportion of the softened (NOT melted) butter.

Aside from the fact that after 1:20 hours, the center was fairly raw, I also did not like the taste combination at all.  I ordinarily like cauliflower but the dill overpowered it and didn't complement anything. I will try to wash it off to see if the leftover (and there's a lot left) can be eaten some other way.  Seriously, hated this recipe!!

I will definitely make it again. I like cauliflower done anyway but this way was really good. My husband hates cauliflower. I told him this recipe will turn a cauliflower hater into a lover. He said yeah right. Well he ate it and went back for seconds. First time he's ate it in the 37 years I have known him.

I followed the directions exactly since this was the first time I was trying it.  Although it was perfectly cooked and looked wonderful after 1 hour and 12 minutes, for my taste it was bland.  Just seemed to be lacking something.  I actually tried a second helping with some grated sharp white cheddar.  May try it again subbing the EVOO (or light mayo as suggested by another reviewer) for the butter.

I absolutely love this recipe!! The flavor is amazing. Fresh and fragrant. After making this once I immediately went to work on making another batch of the "butter spread" and kept in a container in the fridge. Made for a super quick dinner side when prep time is short.  Keep this on hand in the fridge then roast a whole head or cauliflower pieces!!

No changes were made. Followed recipe exactly. Final result did not yield much flavor other than the herb smell of dill. Was cooked through and held together well with a little firm texture.

Even easier than the steaks!  I found it better as well.  Covered with tin foil but had to cook extra half-hour anyway.  Well worth it!  Be generous with your spices!  It's a must try...

made this using the whole head of cauliflower.  it was fine, but not really worth the time it took.  when we sliced it it fell apart, so the presentation  was not as expected.  next time I will just go with my regular recipes.

I wasn't  a fan of the spice mix in this recipe but the technique is great.  The second I made this I left out the cumin, dill, and lemon and sprinkled on some parmesan.  Excellent recipe.

This was awesome, and the buttery liquid at the bottom after its done cooking will be saved to top potatoes tomorrow.  It was very good.  I didn't have cumin, so I put Currey in its place.

I wanted so badly to like this recipe, but I couldn't get it to cook through to save my life. Started at 90 minutes, because I saw the reviews saying 1 hr 15 min wasn't sufficient for them -- but after that, middle was still rock solid. Tried another 30 minutes, but center was still inedible -- I ended up only serving the florets, which had started to dry out (even covered). Will try "Steaks" next time.

I love the combination of flavors on this, and the presentation of having wedges is different and fun.  My very small head of cauliflower was still hard and crunchy after an hour and a half in the oven, but this might have been my fault, since I didn't cover it.  Probably will cover next time to get a little steam action going, then uncover at the end to brown up a bit better.  I used trans fat free margarine with flax and only had dried spices, but still really yummy.

Great recipe but since I'm not a dill fan, I used fresh rosemary from my garden and added capers.  I used butter and lemon olive oil too.  I like the ease of not cutting the cauliflower and just baking it whole!

This recipe was a disappointment for us. I always try do a recipe exactly the first time but I didn't have fresh dill so I used 1 tsp of dried as another reviewer mentioned. Cooked mine for 1-1/2 hrs then put it under the broiler to get some browning. The florets seemed to be the right tenderness but the interior parts were inedible. There wasn't any pan drippings. I just know there is a roasted cauliflower out there with my name on it but this wasn't it! Will try the "steaks" next time

This tasted great, but there was no "sauce".  It was just a thick conglomeration of the ingredients that didn't really penetrate the cauliflower.  It also took a lot more time to cook. I took it out at 1 1/4 hours and it was still half raw.  With that being said, the end product was tastier than your run of the mill roasted vegetable.  I would make it again.

I have tried this twice & have not been terribly impressed.  It seemed undercooked

Turned out great! Followed recipe exactly- adding about an additional 1/16-1/8tsp for each seasoning; used parsley as I did not have dill. Will definitely make again.

This was a big hit at my house, followed the recipe. the flavors was great I will make this again for sure. I think next time I'll cook it for just an hour, or at least test it then, it was very soft. Thanks, Happy Cooking

4 stars because it was easy.  I didn't care for the taste so much, was kind of bland, and definitely don't listen to the review that says it could use more lemon.

Possibly needs more salt, pepper, and lemon zest.

As soon as I found out I didn't have to cut up the cauliflower, I was a fan!  The flavour of cumin is gentled by the roasting.  Lovely dish.

Just finished eating my cauliflower and all I can say is...YUM! The spice mixture was perfect, the texture was perfect! It was easy to make, easy to serve, just used a big metal spoon to scoop a hunk off the head. This will now be my go-to recipe for cauliflower. Thank you! PS. I used dried dill, also.
