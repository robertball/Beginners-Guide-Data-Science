I sautéed the onions until translucent then added chili and cumin until fragrant.  I added the flour until cooked then the cup of chicken broth (in which I had cooked the chicken breasts then shredded) and made a roux.  I added the enchilada sauce and stirred until thickened then added the beans and shredded chicken and oregano.
I left out the jalapeños  - I don't think they would have enough time to cook in this recipe.  Maybe a can of chiles?  I'll see if this needs more spice.  It is still cooking.

I added a little more liquid and quite a bit more spices bc I didn't have a jalepeno.  Very good.  I served with cheese and sour cream.

I added some mild cheese to take some of the heat out of it.

This was bye far the best white chicken chili I ever ate 
Made only a few changes like not hot spicy ingredients at all mom & myself can’t have 
Ate this for 2 days then froze the rest for those cold winter days
