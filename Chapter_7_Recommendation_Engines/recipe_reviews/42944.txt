Awesome little recipe! I love it when so few ingredients produce such wonderful results. I cut the recipe in half because I knew this was going to be a lot of cheese spread. I used light cream cheese, 5 oz. of light feta cheese, minced garlic from a jar, and 2 & 1/2 tsp. of dried dill. This is one of those recipes that you have to play with to suit your tastes so go crazy. This was especially good on bagel chips!

I make this recipe however I use garlic powder and dry dill plus I add enough sour cream to make it not so stiff. Then I spread it on french bread or farmers bread.

This was a great recipe that several people asked for and was soooo simple to make.  I used dried dill which seemed to work quite well and added a bit more of both the dill and the garlic than the recipe called for.  Taste as you make - you may like more or less!

Very strong feta taste, but very good, if 'strong' is what you want.  I served this in a hollowed out round squash and it was quite a wow-getter.  =)  Don't we all want that?  I used 2 tsp dried dill and it worked great.

Really tasty and couldn't be easier!  This is a great one to make ahead of time and pull out when needed.  I agree that it's easy to adjust the amount of seasonings to fit your taste-you can even adjust the amount of feta.  Thanks, Bronte!

This was good with some changes.  First of all, the feta makes the spread very salty and as it was also extremely thick, I added sour cream into the mix to reduce the saltiness and give it more of the consistency I was looking for.  Will make this again with changes.  Great taste.

I liked this recipe because it was easy and versatile. I cut it in half because it seemed like it made alot.  I know that dill has so much flavor, so I added a little bit at a time.  Next time I make this, I think I will put the feta cheese through the food processor to break up any chunks.  I think I would like it a little smoother. Next time I would also add a tsp. of cracked black pepper.

This was sooooo yummy!  Very garlicky, huge feta taste...it was great on seasoned toast rounds.  I can't see thinning it with milk, though, like some suggested.  I think it would really take away that kick and mellow it out too much.  The only think I did differently was to mix all the ingredients with the mixer except the feta and then mix it in at the end.  I liked the idea of chunks to give it a bit of texture.  Great recipe!

Such a simple idea!  I used 2 whipped cream cheese tubs so it would spread more easily.  I also used tomato & basil flavored feta instead of plain and reduced the amount of garlic to 1 clove.

This is delicious, however, I found it to be very thick and I added one small container of sour cream.  Adding this also cut the sharp taste and I only used 6 ounces of feta.  In addition to the minced garlic, I added garlic powder.  I used a carved out pumpkin for the bowl and served it with sesame melba rounds.  It was a big hit!

very nice and super quick. I did make it a bit more healthy though. I used Light feta cheese(66g), as well as 70% reduced fat cream cheese( 125g). I was only making it for 4, so I used the above. I did use about 1 tsp of minced garlic and the full 1.5 tsp of dill. I served with with carrot/bell pepper/and cucumber sticks.

Fantastic dip that was even better the next day.  Definitely a keeper - if you're not a feta fan lesson the amount so it's not overwhelming.

I made this recipe in an attempt to recreate the spread used in one of my favorite veggie sandwiches at a deli I no longer live near.  It's not a match to that, but it is FANTASTIC!!!  I cut the recipe in half because it will only be me eating it, and used Neufatel cheese.  In addition to my sandwich, it tastes great with crackers.  So happy I tried this!

Great basic recipe.  Added extra chicken breast and crisped up tortilla a few shells to make summer pizza (with peppers and cucumbers).  Low fat cream cheese and feta worked well.

From the ingredients, you can tell this will be a firm spread (which is probably why it's called a "spread" and not a "dip"!)  Definitely increase/decrease the amounts as you see fit, and definitely make this the day before because it's even more awesome after it sits.

Wonderful flavour!  I substituted fat free yogurt cheese for the cream cheese.  Turned out a really nice consistency - not too stiff.  If you want a bland, ho-hum dip, stay away from this one!  Thanks for posting.

I was having a couple of friends over, so I searched for a recipe using feta and cream cheese because I had them on hand.  This fit the bill perfectly. I halved the recipe.  I smashed the feta with a fork, then put in and the cream cheese in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften it and it was very easy to stir.  It turned out very creamy and garlicky and delicious.  I used dried dill to taste.  The three of us gals polished off the whole thing with sliced baguette.

Great Dip! If you love the ingredients, you'll love this dip. Easiest to mix if the cream cheese is at room temperature and well softened.

this is so good!!!  i have made it many times and would recommend making it at least 1 day in advance.  it gets much stronger the longer it is in the fridge. 2-3 days is even better...  i have even used leftovers to stuff into chicken breasts!

Be prepared for the garlic.  I love garlic, but I halved it and still found it strong.  I'll make it again.  I usually have the stuff to make it on hand.

I thought this dip was good, although it was barely touched at the cocktail party I hosted.... I used my food processor and liked the consistency of the dip. The feta seemed to be the strongest flavor in my batch; I would add more dill next time.

Wonderful spread! And sooooo easy. I mixed it all in my food processor. The only thing I did different was use a little less feta (my own taste), used 2 teaspoons of dried dill weed (did not have fresh ) and added a tiny bit of milk to make it spread a little easier. Everyone was right that it gets better with time.

Wonderful as is.  But when I want a dip, I add a cup of Tzatziki. Plain yogart with extra garlic and dill to taste is also good to use to make this a tasty dip.

I made it as is, with the exception of substituting dried dill because that is what I had on hand. Very simple, very tasty, and it got tons of compliments. I had 4 people ask me for the recipe. This will definitely be a keeper.

Very good! I added a little milk just to make it a little thinner, easier to mix and easier to spread.  The flavor was great.  A simple but interesting spread for when you have little time but you need to impress.

I used all fresh ingredients as stated and I tasted it right after making it, thought it was a little bland. I added some black pepper and was about to go crazy adding garlic powder and other dried spices, but decided to let it chill the 4 hours and THEN "fix" it. I'm glad I waited! The taste is great, just needs some time to develop. The only thing I might change is to sub some of the cream cheese with mayo or sour cream to make it more dippable.. I broke several crackers before I remembered this is a spread not a dip and went and got myself a knife.

This was great as a quick dip - I had last minute dinner guests, not a lot of money or time and everyone was happy with this. Iserved it with mini rye bread, chopped shallots and assorted olives - wonderful!

I used this for the filling for the garlic cheese chicken roll up recipe on this site - It was fantastic - Im not really sure I could handle it as a dip though, as I tasted it before stuffing it in the chicken - It was a bit strong for me straight.

I made this for my sister's housewarming party, with about 30 guests, and everyone went nuts for it! I served it with crostini (baguettes that I had sliced and dried in the oven), but I also had some on top of a hamburger, and that was awesome. I made it the day before, and didn't think it was overwhelmingly garlicky. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious & Easy! I did tweak it a bit though. I roasted the garlic in tinfoil in the oven first and I used cilantro instead of dill since my husband hates dill. It turned out fantastic!

So far I love this spread. Its in the fridge, made it tonight.  It is what it says it is, a spread, not a dip.  If you are looking for a dip then you will have to change it.  I love it on Honey Wheat Thins.   I am thinking of putting it in a chicken roll up also.  This is great in a wrap also, so many things you can do with this spread. If your garlic cloves are large then use your best judgement.  I used only one clove becuase it was large and I made 1/2 of the recipe. Wow.. Thanks!

this recipe was amazing!!  i love dill dip.  but when you throw in garlic and feta, two of my favorite things in the world, you have a bangin' dip!  for those who are health conscious, i used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and threw in some low fat sour cream. i also only used 4 ounces of feta, instead of the 8 ounces.   i didnt' have any cloves of garlic, so i used the chopped garlic that comes in a jar, about a teaspoon of it, and some dried dill weed, and it came out fantastic.  my coworkers at our christmas party wanted the recipe.  very good if you're a fan of feta and garlic.

Outstanding, and so easy to fix. Used 2 tsp dried dill instead of fresh, thinned it down just a little with milk, and served it in a hollowed-out round squash as another reviewer did.  Gone instantly, a true party pleaser.  Thanks for this keeper recipe!

I made this for a cocktail party and served it with veggies and crackers.  I also used a cookie cutter and cut out star shapes in a sheet of puff pastry, cooked it and when it was done baking I spread some of the cheese spread on top and everyone ate them up.  So tasty and easy!

Fabulous!  So tasty!  I put in 4 instead of 3 cloves of garlic and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  The other small change was to add a bit of milk to make it more of a dip consistency, rather than a spread.  This is very flavorful and goes great with crackers, pita, carrots, mixed veggies, just about anything.

Very popular at a family birthday gathering.  I used herb feta and then added a little milk when blending to make it smoother and softer for chip dipping.  Thanks Bronte

I was also a bit worried that the feta would overpower and that there would be too much garlic.  The people at the party I brought it to...loved it, hence the 4 star.  I thank you for a quick and easy recipe that was pretty much liked by all.

This was a nice flavor-packed spread for rolls. I couldn't find feta cheese so I used a salty white cheese with a similar consistency. I needed to use about 1/2 cup of sour cream to make it smooth and spreadable - if I wanted to use this as a dip (and it would make a great dip) I'd use use a full cup.

I made this for a work potluck. Rave reviews. I used dry dill, minced garlic from the jar, and added about 1/2 cup of sour cream because it was very stiff to stir with just the cream cheese.

Fixed as written, except for softened the cream cheese and mixed in the rest with a fork. Served with pretzel stix. Just the right amount of saltiness.

Sooo tasty and easy. The first time I made this I used neufchâtel cheese- delicious. The next time, I bought fat free cream cheese to use. It was my first time buying fat free cream cheese and lemme tell you: that stuff is gross. I'd never put it on a bagel. It looks like opaque jello. After I stopped dry-heaving at the sight of it, I put it in this recipe and it was still delicious! Go ahead and try the fat free in this recipe. It is still awesome and way way lower in calories. I'll be using this recipe frequently.

Great texture, great strong flavor.  I actually made this as a homemade bagel spread, and for this purpose, it was only OK -- a bit thick and intense for the typical morning bagel.  But it's a wonderful dip.  Very easy to make.

OMG this is Great! My daughter made it and I couldn't keep myself away from it.  She served it with town crackers and there was a bowl of black olives on the table which I also love so ... I topped each cracker & cheese spread with the Olive... Wonderful!!! She did say it was a little bit thick so she added a a small amount of sour cream to make it spread easier.  This... is a keeper.

I will never buy anything but plain cheese again.  I enjoyed this recipe so much that I have made it multiple times with a bunch of twist but always keep with the main ingredients.  I have added roasted red peppers and sun dried tomatos.

This dip went over well and I was asked for the recipe.  Next time I think I will add some sour cream as it is a little "dry" for my taste.

I made this using whipped cream cheese as well.  Given that I despise FETA, I couldn't bring myself to using it, so I substitued a bit of bleu cheese (about half of what the feta amount was).  I was making it for a party and molded it into a Christmas Tree on a decorative platter.  Then, I used my grating zester and covered it with parmegiano reggiano.  It gave it an interest "snowflake" effect, which was pretty.  A friend suggested finely diced green pepper, red pepper, carrot or whatever and dot the "branches" with the veggies to look like a decorated tree.  That sounds great and will do that next year.  Served with Triscuits, veggies and wheat thins.  I also used fresh garlic and dill and made this about 3 hours ahead of serving, then let sit out for a half hour before it was devoured.

I make something very similar. I also add thyme, basil, and oregano, as well as 2-4 tbl. of mayo for a more friendly spread. I chop up 1 large tomato and cucumber and use that to garnish on top of pita triangles. Very delicious!

This is absolutely delicious! The only variation I made was to only use 4 oz. of feta because it was all I had on hand but the strength of the feta flavor was well balanced with the dill and garlic. I probably won't increase the feta to 8 oz. next time.

Very garlic-y, which I like. I used as a spread on a veggie wrap. Even got my two year old to eat a plate full of raw veggies (red, yellow and green peppers, yellow squash, zucchini and cucumber) she loved to dip them in it. Definitely will make this again. It's so easy and tastes great on a hot summer afternoon for lunch. 
Ok, after I wrote this review and the dip had set in the frig for a day or two, the garlic continued to intensify. Still good, but don't plan on going to meeting or on a date afterward!

I thought the taste was too garlicky and too much dill but everyone at the bridal shower LOVED it and a friend of mine who is a chef asked to take the rest home with her.

My family and I absoloutly love this recipe.  I do find that it's a wee think when we want to use for dipping so I just blending a couple of tablespoons of skim milk.  And I leave it as is when we want to eat with steak or chicken...sooooooooo so good.
I even made it for a party and they thought I had bought it at a gourmet shop.  A must have for the garlic, feta lover.

Made this for an Easter dinner appetizer...it turned out great!  I used a tablespoon of the dried dill weed out of the bottle as opposed to fresh dill, but that is because I couldn't find any fresh in the store, and then used the honey wheat Wheatables.  I only got a couple of crackers - it was gone when I went back for more!

It was ok. Mine seemed very hard for some reason and not very spreadable. I used low fat feta so maybe I needed more seasoning or something.

This is fabulous. I always know I have a winner when I get asked for the recipe! I made it just as instructed- and I thought it might be a bit too much garlic- but when all the flavors came together it was wonderful. This is a keeper.

Let me just put it this way--my husband called this "evil", as he shoved more of it in his mouth! 
It was great!  Very strong, but we love feta and garlic.  Added 2 tsp of dried dill and little extra garlic.  I have made this 2 times, and it has turned out wonderfully both times.  I serve it with crackers and lightly toasted italian bread.

Another idea with this is I double the cream cheese so it isn't quite so potent and use it to stuff chicken breasts,then top the breasts with butter and some fresh dill, absolutely phenomenal!

Thought this was delicious! I followed the recipe exact except I added a splash of milk for consistancy reasons. The milk didnt effect the flavor at all. Also I took the advice found on here and served with rounded seasoned toasties and veggies. Yum!

I used 2 teaspoons of dried dill like others and it turned out great.
I was expecting the feta to taste a little stronger, I may add a bit more next time.  I will certainly be making this again.

This is really good. It gets better after being in the fridge for a day or two. Great with sourdough bread or crackers.  Would be wonderful to serve for a party instead of the usual dips.

I only changed it my adding a smidge of garlic, thought it compliments the feta. Took it to a cook out, got many compliments. Good flavor.

This was allright. I didn't care for the strong feta taste overpowering the cream cheese. But I brought it to a party and everyone said they enjoyed it.

This recipe was very good. I didn’t have any dill so I replaced it with fresh oregano grown in my herb pot. I also made some roasted red peppers and made mini croissants spread with the cream cheese/feta recipe and topped it with the roasted red pepper. It was excellent.

3.23.18  This recipe has had great reviews, but I found it just not very flavorful, all I could taste was cream cheese and garlic.  I couldn’t taste the fresh dill at all, so I immediately doubled that amount plus added more feta cheese.  These additions helped, but not so much that I’d make this again.  Some reviewers mentioned that the spread was “hard.”  All you need to do is take it out of the fridge and let it sit at room temp for a little while, and you’re have a good spreading consistency.

I used minced garlic in a jar, instead of fresh. It is really delicious. We had it on Wheat Thins also veggies: broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini sticks, carrots, and cherry tomatoes. I will make it again.

This was a strange little dip.  I aged it overnight and thought it was a little too garlicky and lacking in dill.  Since it made a lot, I was also eating it on garlic Triscuits the next night and it tasted better, but I was still craving more dill and this time, some cucumber.  Every night it was better.

This was good - I really enjoyed it. I made enough for myself and I used carrot sticks and celery. I put a little bit of lemon juice (a very small amount) to make it a little more of my desired consistency, but I'd be very hesitant to put too much. I also put 2 teaspoons of shredded Parmesan cheese for my one serving and I liked the taste, although I would only make it for specific parties and events.

Love the recipe, but needed a little twiking. I added 1/4 c. green onions, salt & pepper to taste, & 1/4 c. or more sour cream to make thinner for a dip. Oh yeah, that made it.

Very tasty. Made for a bridal shower, served with crackers and veggies. Many people asked for the recipe. As others have noted, this is a very forgiving recipe. Add as much or as little garlic and dill as desired. Will definitely make again.

I made this for my Book Group, and it was a huge hit.  I added another clove of garlic, about 2 1/2 tsp of dried dill, and some cracked pepper to taste.  Served it with some crackers.  It makes a lot, so I might halve the recipe next time.  Anyway, I used some this morning on a toasted bagel--probably the best bagel spread I've ever tasted.  As someone pointed out, it is even better the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

Amazing spread! I backed off a bit on the feta (about 25% less than recipe calls for), but really wish I hadn't. Everyone loved this, from kids to adults. I got severe looks of disappointment when we ran out!

Oh my, this is so good!  It's a bit strong, maybe next time I'd cut the garlic down a tad... but no, because then it wouldn't taste as good!  This dip is SO worth the garlic breath!  I ended up sitting at the counter with a pack of crackers and eating half of this myself!

Great combination of flavors. I would give it 5 stars, but I made the (terrible) mistake of doubling the amount of garlic.  In this case, more garlic is NOT better.  I also added some lemon juice to try to loosen the spread so it could be scouped by a cracker.  I will try this one again and follow the directions. (but probably still add some lemon juice)

I agree with most reviewers on this one. Too thick, too garlic-y. Add sour cream, lose at least 1 clove of garlic. Good basic flavor though!! Just needs tweeking to your tastes.

I made only 6 servings and served with Italian bread. It is a thick dip so next time I would like to thin with some sour cream. Also served with "Chicken on a Stick," "Sugar Snap Peas," and "Country Green Beans."

Good recipe, but it needs more dill flavor!  We added almost 2 additional tablespoons of fresh dill.  But a very good combo with the feta, really enjoyed this one with crudites!

This is really yummy! I used 4 tbsp of skim milk to make it easier to scoop into but the flavor was still amazing!!!

Mmmmmm...I love this spread!  I get requests all the time to bring it to parties.  Like other reviewers said, it is very garlicky but I like it that way.  You can always just start off with 1 clove of garlic and add a little at a time to taste.  I serve it with baked crispy pita wedges.  I always make myself extra because there usually aren't any left overs!

Awesome spread!!  I cut the recipe in half since I was serving 8 people, it was gone in a flash and I had a request for the recipe.  I served it with honey wheat crackers and wheat pita chips.  I did add about 2 Tbl of milk to thin it a bit and let it sit in the frig overnight.  I will caution everyone that the garlic in it is VERY strong so adjust it to your taste, I was lucky that everyone I served it to loved garlic.

very easy, very versatile, very tasty! What more could you ask for? I used garlic and herb seasoning in place of the garlic and LOTS of fresh dill. I will keep this as a go to dip recipe. Next time I will add more feta to bring out the feta flavor more.

So easy & tasty!  I cut the recipe in half (but added extra dill) and served with wheat crackers as an appetizer when we had a couple of friends over for dinner.  It was a hit!  Also took some to work and my boss loved it.  I'm going to try it spread on a toasted bagel with sliced tomato and cucumber as a veggie sandwich.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is great, so tasty.  Be sure to get the garlic very finely minced.

This is good!  I never have fresh herbs, so I used a 1/3 dried.  Very delicious!  It definitely is more a spread than a dip, but it is very excellent.  Put it on a bagel with turkey, cheese, and tomato and it was great.  Thanks!

I was skeptical at first after reading the ingredents.  But then I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  After letting it sit for 5 hours it was good, but the next day, wow...even better!  I will make this one again.

Excellent. Love the strong flavor of the feta. I used dried dill and it works great. Tastes good with crackers and also spread on raw veggies.

Loved this,  I'm such a feta lover.  I used dried dill instead of fresh though.
I love garlic too, so I might have used a "little extra" to suit my taste. 
*wink wink*

This was FANTASTIC and so easy to prepare.  I was a bit hestitant at first because I don't love dill like some do, but it was so YUMMY!!  I prepared it a day in advance, the flavor was perfect.  Everyone loved it--I nearly had to run out and make another batch!!  Thank you for sharing!!!

I used reduced fat feta and light cream cheese.  This was a huge hit for both an afternoon get together and with crackers at a cocktail party.

Very tasty, but stay away from the fat-free cream cheese!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was certainly the most popular appetizer.  I love that it can easily be halved so I can make it for just me and my husband. Picking up the ingredients soon as it's on the Christmas menu as well. Thank you for a great, easy recipe!

This was a big hit at a recent football watching party.  I used garlic powder and dried dill because that is what I had on hand.  Served it with toasted french bread and crackers and there were no leftovers.  Thanks Bronte for taking the time to share.
