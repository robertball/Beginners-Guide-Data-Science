This is a wonderful cookie recipe! It turns out great every time! Be sure to chop the butterfingers well. I've used creamy peanut butter and it turns out fine, too. Also, I use all butter flavored Crisco for nice chewey cookies.

Disappointing. Very flat and greasy tasting. Might be better by varying the recipe and adding some chocolate chips.

My family just raved about these cookies. Make sure not to overbake them. Chopping up the candy bars was time consuming, but well worth it. I prefer chopping them into larger chunks(1/2"-1"), but you could use Butterfinger BB's if you are short on time.

This is the BEST cookie recipe I have tried. I use creamy pb because I don't like nuts in recipes. I also substitute different candies to change the taste. I have used Heath toffee pieces, for example. These cookies are a big hit! I like to make them small, too. The presentation is great! I may try adding some cocoa next time to make them doubly chocolaty.

These cookies are rich, but they are fantastic for peanut lovers.  I added 1/2 cup chopped cocktail peanuts (no skins).  They do not spread out a lot, so make big balls and flatten them slightly.  Cool 1-2 minutes on pan before removing to cool on rack.  I mixed in the chopped candy by hand.  I sent these with other cookies for x-mas and had two requests for the recipe!  I may try reducing the number of candy bars next time.

I didn't really like this cookie.  It was a pain because I had to wait until it cooled before taking them off the pan.  It was a bit messy and not worth the effort for the taste.  I am an advanced baker... I just don't think it was worth it.

I brought these to work and everyone liked them.  I, however, thought they were flat and not very special. The good thing about them is that they were crunchy, but I'd rather eat the candy bar and make peanut butter kiss cookies.

Absolutely wonderful cookies.  They didn't last long in my house at all.
Very easy to make in my kitchen aid mixer.  This would be a great cookie to take to a cookie exchange.  So easy to make and great tasting!
I used real butter, and crunchy peanut butter.
I want to try some with creamy peanut butter as well, but I love the crunch peanut butter taste.

Oh my gosh!  These are some of the best cookies I have ever made.  Absolutely wonderful.  I had no trouble using light margarine instead of butter, and I used creamy peanut butter.  Since Butterfinger is a pretty crumbly candy bar, I didn't have too much trouble breaking it apart.

This recipe is my favorite.  I used to bake them for an ex boyfriend when we were together years ago and he still calls to get this recipe.  Too bad he was a jerk :)

Unreal! A very peanut-buttery, sweet chewy cookie. Next time I'll crush the Butterfingers to be less powdery. Very decadent cookie.

These are pretty good but they are awful sweet.  I might use less bars if I were to ever make again.  I used smooth peanut butter too and they are very peanutty!  They have a nice crispiness to them from the butterfinger bars.  OK but don't know if I'd ever make again!!

I used creamy peanut butter. Did'nt have baking soda, substituted for baking powder. Loved the taste. Will definitely try the crunchy peanut butter next time.

These are great! They don't have a very strong "butterfinger" taste, but these are one of a few cookies that the flavors improve over time. Will be making again!
