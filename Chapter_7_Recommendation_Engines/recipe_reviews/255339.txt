My family loves these cookies! I've made the recipe several times and have come up with a few adjustments. The first time they were a little too sweet and you could feel the oil when you picked up a baked cookie.
I use 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of white sugar, 1 cup of unpacked brown sugar and 1.5t of baking soda. I also bake them for only 7-8 min and they come out perfect!

I made these today and they didn't "spread" out when baking, just stayed in the lumps.

Added suggestion as I get request to make these all the time! No other choc chip recipe stands up close to these. Make sure you don’t ‘melt’ the butter, just soften. Also, these cookies cook best if you drop the cookie dough by spoonful, not a packed cookie scooper.

I put the dough in the freezer for about 20 minutes and cooked them for 13 minutes.  My husband loved them!

I made these hoping for a more intense and rich vanilla flavor. I didn't get that. I really blame it on too much white sugar. These were too sweet for me and the family. I would like to try to make them again and cut the white sugar in half. But as I haven't tried yet, I can't recommend doing that.

I found the vanilla overpowering.  I made them again with half of the vanilla, and they were very good.

I messed these up by making the batter too thin. They spread out like pancakes. My fault for mixing them that way.Even though I did, they turned out better than the first batch, everyone loved them anyway. Not just said they did, but these ones disappeared quicker.

These cookies were yummy! The only reason I held back a star is because they didn't have the vanilla flavor I expected. I made slight changes suggested by another reviewer--cutting back the butter and sugar to 1 cup each and bumping up the baking powder. Cookies were chewy and chocolatey. I may try adding even more vanilla next time or just enjoy them as is...

I really liked these cookies and had a request for the recipe. I’m at high altitudes so I added about 1/2 cup flour after cooking the first tray because they flattened out too much for my taste.

Although this is THE BEST reciepe out there..I tweaked it and made this my "dump" cookie. We dump all things leftover in the pantry from previous baking adventures into the bowl along side 3 kinds of chocolate chips (semi sweet, milk and dark) and VOILÁ ...happy estatic family...I save the original reciepe for those chilly fall midwestern nights and never fails to be a crowd pleaser...seriously THE ABSOLUTE BEST reciepe EVER!

I found that there may be a few too many chocolate chips, I know right! So next batch I’m going to reduce them to 9 - 10 oz.   kids loves these so much.  Is now my new favourite recipe...   only did 3/4 tsp of baking soda and 1/4 tsp baking powder and they turned out great.

8-21-2018 ~These were okay, but certainly not my favorite. In other words, these will get eaten, but I won’t make them again.  Flavor is very good, and the balance of crispy to soft is just right.  But… these were a little too greasy for my tastes, requiring either less flour (1/4 c.), less butter (1/3 c.) or even both.  Hubs, I should add, may disagree.  He kind of likes greasier cookies.

Thumbs Up! These are more crumbly than the originals to shape into balls, but the result is a good tasty morsel.

They were very good but just a little too much vanilla.  I will use 3 teaspoons instead of 4 teaspoons next time.

I saw the recipe on the McCormick pure vanilla box, and wanted to try it. I've been trying all different types of chocolate chip cookie recipes,and wanted to combine what I loved best from each one. I LOVE vanilla, so I left it at 2 Tblsp. I lowered the sugar a bit to 1 cup each. I then subbed 1/4 Cup oatmeal, and 1/4 cup sweetened coconut-- ground both-- added to flour to make up the 3 1/4 cup total -- so-- 2 3/4 cup regular flour. And I prefer milk chocolate chips-- no nuts.
First I put round tsp at 375*-- but they cooked too fast, and flattened. Then I baked at 350*-- better, but still too fast on bottom. So I refrigerated the dough. Balls at 350* for 8-10 came out much better. Nice crunch outside-- soft, chewy inside. I think I finally found my perfect cookie!
