I loved this chili and used a similar recipe to win the chili cook off. It is medium spicy and has a nice smoky flavor. I did make a couple changes. I added some chopped red onions, used Chipotle seasoned tomatoes instead of the regular tomatoes, and added some Tabasco brand Chipolte hot sauce.

I am usually very hard to please when it comes to recipes.  I've tried so many 4-5 star rated and wondered why people thought they were so great.  This chili was awesome ! I did double the broth, tomatoes (used one w/green chili's and one just diced) , added a couple of diced jalapeno and a couple of sliced smoked brats.  Put it in the slow cooker for the afternoon...and YUMMY!!!! Oh yes, and do add shredded chz and some crushed tortilla chips when serving.

Delicious, quick and easy, what more could you ask for in a recipe! I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli and shredded the meat. Since there was so much meat I doubled the rest of the ingredients.  The seasoning was great but we like a little more spice so I added two chopped jalapeno peppers.  Topped this with fresh cilantro and shredded sharp cheddar. Served with crusty bread and it did the trick for warming me up on a cold winter night!

This recipe was entirely too spicy for my family and I had to make some major adjustments that actually improved the taste of the chili. I added about 3/4 cup of sour cream and a teaspoon of corn starch to temper the spice and thicken the broth. Then I served it over rice to attempt to cut the spice a little more. The end result was really good!

I left out the corn (dont like it) . I doubled the spices, tomato sauce, chicken broth and spices. Sprinkled cheddar cheese on top and a dollop of sour cream.

Too bland and too soupy. I realize this recipe is submitted by a Chicken Broth company but chicken broth shouldn't be added to the recipe.  I  doubled the seasoning but still had to doctor this up quite a bit. I added green chilis, onion and garlic.  I cooked up some cubed chicken thighs and  and then put the rest of the ingredients in the crock pot. I added the tomatoes without draining. That on top of the chicken broth makes it too soupy for me.
