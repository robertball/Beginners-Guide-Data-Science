As is, I think the recipe is really good.  I used regular carrots and sliced them.  I was surprised at how quickly the sweet potato cooked.  Next time I think I'll start teh carrots and add the sweet potatoes after 5 min.  I'll also get the applesauce out of the fridge and let it sit while cooking the potato and carrots.  Our mash cooled down quite a bit with the addition of the applesauce.  But really, I do think this is a good recipe.  Next time I make it I'm sure I'll give it a "5 star".  I think it could use a little something in the spice area, but I'm not sure what.  If anyone has any thoughts, please post them.  A little ginger maybe?

V. good recipe. I don't like raisins so I left those out and cut the sugar down to 2 T. 

It definitely needs a touch of salt and because I like the flavor, I added about 1/8 t of allspice to the butter/sugar mix. 

With these small changes it wasn't bland.

A great twist for sweet potatoes! I used an electric hand mixer to mash, which didn't mash the carrots very well, but I like the texture with the lumps in it. I used cinnamon applesauce, a little less brown sugar & butter, and no raisins (just out of laziness - next time I'll put them in). Served with barbecued chicken breasts and steamed green beans. Will make regularly, thank you!

I modified this recipe, I was trying to use up a can of sweet potatoes and a can of carrots.  I'm sure it would have been even better with fresh veggies!  I ommitted the brown sugar...canned sweet taters come packed in syrup...even though I drained that off...    I used 2 cans sweet taters, 1 can diced carrots, 1/2 cup applesauce. didn't have any raisins.  It was good and done in less than 10 mins.    Still pretty good!

I've made this twice.  The first time, I was very pleasantly sursprised because I really loved it.  But the second time, it had such a bad taste that I had to throw it away!  I think that I may have let the butter/sugar cook to long and it possibly scorched a bit.  At least I'm hoping so, because I really did enjoy the recipe so much the first time around!  I'll definitely give it another shot...and be careful with the sugar this time!  This is a great way to get kids (and adults!) to eat their vegetables!

This recipe actually got my hubby eating raisins!It was the first time I'd used sweet potatoes and the taste combinations were wonderful to say the least. My friends and I had it with rib-eye steak and hubby had the mash with peppered sirloin. He said the tastes complimented one another perfectly. Easy to do, easy to eat! Thanks

Could NOT STOP EATING this stuff.  1 in the morning, hungry and craving carrots (which usually give me headaches when I eat them) and I find this.  If I had made any more, I would have eaten myself sick.  This is going to be a family holiday tradition from now on!

Yummy!! This was soooo good!  I followed the directions to the "T" except I didn't add raisins.  Was super easy and quick to make, and my hubby and 5 yr old gobbled it up.  Will definately add to my regular rotation of recipes.

This recipe is great. I followed this recipe closely, except that I left out the raisins. I'm hoping to make this for Thanksgiving, and my mom hates raisins. It was good when I first tasted it, I liked that the carrots were a little less done then the sweet potatoes, it gave some nice texture contrast. It was, however, a little bland. So I added 1/8th tsp of both cardamom and cinnamon. Wow, did that make the flavor really pop. Next time I might decrease the butter a little, maybe that will give it a slightly fresher flavor.

We served this dish at our soup kitchen and it was very well received.  I do have a question about the raisins, though.  None of your posted pictures show raisins in this dish.  Are they supposed to be included in the ingredients?

Interesting variation on standard mashed sweet potatoes.  I added more applesauce than the recipe called for as it was the potatoes were too dry.  My kids liked it, so I'll probably make this again.

My whole family loved this recipe!  Yay!  That never happens so this one is a keeper.  After I cooked the carrots and sweet potatoes I used my mixer to mash them together.  The carrots were harder to mash and the overall dish was a little lumpy.  I don't typically use applesauce in dishes so I did not know what to expect.  It tasted really good.  This is one I definitely will make again.  I did not use the raisins bc I did not want to push my luck with my kids.  Maybe after I have served this to them a few times and they are sure they like it I will try adding the raisins.  I did have a lot of leftovers.  I think I am going to make a shepherds pie.  I thought maybe mixing the ground beef with clove flavors and using these mashed carrots as a topper.  Yum.  I can't wait.

Loved it!! I did some tweaking, less sugar (2tbsp) more applesauce (3/4c w/ cinnamon) and less raisins (1/4c)and used a light margarine rather than butter turned out great, was hoping the kids would like it after reading other reviews but no such luck! Still a great tasting dish will be adding to our Easter Meal.

It was good, but not a favorite.  I would suggest boiling the carrots and potatoes separately because the carrots did not soften as quick as the potatoes (my own mistake), which caused there to be some large pieces of carrot left that would not mash.  I will probably try making it again :)

Instead of applesauce I put in a cup of vanilla yogurt.  This made it kind of creamy, and made for a wonderful midday snack.

Yum!  Excellent as is!  Carrots required a longer cooking time though, so add those before the potatoes, or cut them up into smaller pieces.

I made this for a dinner party. I served chicken cordon bleu II (from this site) and this along with wild rice and plain broccoli. This recipe was a hit. It was easy to do ahead of time and then reheat in a casserole dish in the oven. It is slighly sweet and balanced the sauce from the chicken. Yum! This one is a new family favorite!

I omitted the raisins because I wanted my family to eat it too and they are not raisin fans but it still turned out very good. My picky son even ate it! Next time I will let the carrots boil for at least 10 minutes before adding the sweet potatoes as I dice them small and they cook quickly. I will definitely make this again

My favorite sweet potato side dish for holiday meals.  I've made four times starting a few years ago.  Things that I've done differently:  I don't use salted water and I cook the carrots separately from sweet potatoes as they take longer to get to the right consistency--I know they are done when a thick piece mashes easily with a fork.  Even then I usually end up with small chunks of carrots which is actually preferable to me.  Too make healthier, I use coconut sugar rather than brown sugar and use a healthier yogurt spread instead of butter.  I don't add raisins (just not to my or hubby's taste).  I also use less than half of the sauce as I've found the dish can become too runny.  After mashing the sweet potatoes and carrots, I very slowly add the sauce, mix and taste before deciding to add more.   Letting the sweet potatoes and carrots drain well first also helps them from becoming too runny.    Hard to figure out how many sweet potatoes to add as they vary so much in size.  I usually double recipe so I've used a really large one and a medium one or three medium ones.  I also add 1-2 dashes of allspice.   I recently added a few dashes of cinnamon but hubby didn't like the addition so won't do that again.

These are so yummy! Thanks for the great recipe! I left out the raisins and it complemented my roasted chicken and sautéed kale dinner perfectly!

I tried this recipe because I wanted to use the carrots and sweet potatoes that I had in my  pantry.  Both my husband and I were disappointed in the results.  Other than the fact that this recipe uses fresh vegetables, there's not much to recommend it.  The butter overwhelmed the dish (it was floating on the top).  The description says that it is "chunky" - but we didn't find anything "chunky" about it - and that that it has "flavors" - but we didn't taste many of those either.  Note that there are NO spices in the recipe.

Great dish. I cooked the carrots and sweet potatoes in a pressure cooker.  Overall. it's a bit on the sweet side, maybe less sugar next time.  I also liked the raisins a lot.  They added good texture to the dish.

6.21.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/149032/carrot-sweet-potato-mash/ ... I'm "famous" (in my mind ;D), for not reading/following directions ... 'Saved this recipe, ended up at the store thinking "Huh, I should make that.  I already have the sweet potatoes mashed."  Well, in my fuzzy memory, I thought I read "baby carrots," which, of course, I did.  I refer to baby carrots as baby carrots AND as baby FOOD carrots.  'See where I'm goin' here?  :O Soooo, while I didn't follow the recipe, it is a great idea & I will use baby food carrots again.  Huh?  :D  I used a bigger (6oz) jar baby food carrots (Green Giant stage 3 w/ barley btw) w/close to 2c already mashed sweets.  I added a T brown sugar, but probably could've omitted it altogether since the baby food carrots are sweet, too. 'Didn't add anything else except a little salt.  The baby food was wet enough to make it the right consistency.  Whenever I need cooked, mashed sweets, I always bake 'em then mash. When they're baked, they come out sweeter (I think) than in boiling water.  More flavor, too; & they freeze well.  Next time, I'll use more sweet potato & the same size jar baby food carrots.  Candied or just toasted nuts would be good on top.  Very good, but kinda plain looking.

Fantastic! Quick & easy! I doubled it and actually didn't have any fresh carrots, so I used a can of carrots (mashed them in with drained cooked sweet potatoes).  While I'm sure fresh is better - still tasted great!

Very good and very easy to make.  I used a yam instead of a sweet potato, cut the amount of raisins in half, and added pecans in their place, which turned out very nicely.

This was really good.  I used a little less butter and sugar to prepare for my 1-year old.  We both really enjoyed it.  Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this.  It was a nice change from the more traditional sweet potato dishes.  I used cinnamon applesauce, as I thought the cinnamon would be a nice addition.  I also decreased the brown sugar to 2 T., which just the right amount of sweetness for me.

This was my first sweet potato recipe....I think that next time, I will cut the sugar probably in half, I thought it was WAY too sweet. I also thought it was missing something, so I threw in 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and that was just what it needed. I left out the raisins, too. All in all, it was pretty good and my hubby and two year old both ate it without protest.

I've never been a fan of cooked carrots, but I really loved this recipe!  My boyfriend isn't as big on sweet dishes as I am and he loved it too!
