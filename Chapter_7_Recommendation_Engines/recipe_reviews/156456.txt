This was simple, healthy and tasty!  However I like a little tang in salads, so I followed the suggestion of one reviewer to add vinegar (I used red wine vinegar) and honey.  I added two thinly sliced green scallions.  I also substituted drained artichoke hearts for the hearts of palm (which I didn't have on hand), and used fresh taragon from my garden.  I suppose you could use basalmic vinegar and/or fresh basil, or poppy seed for other variations.

This was simply delicious. I usually change something in the recipes I try, either because I don't have or don't care for an ingredient. For this one, I followed exactly (except I used fresh mint from my yard). Then I forgot to add the hearts of palm I had just bought for it!! ARGH! But it was still delicious -- made it for girls' dinner and there was none left! Thanks!

This salad was very flavorful, and the leftovers did not get soggy after sitting in the fridge for a day or two.  If you don't care for mint, dried basil would be a great substitute.  This recipe made a lot - 2 dinner salads for my family of 5, plus 2 lunches for me!

This was really good. I'm a big fan of dressings that don't cover everything up, and this one works for me. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good salad.  I used romaine for the greens.  I like my dressing a little more full bodied, so I tried it then added a honey mustard dressing.  Even for all that, I love the combination of salad ingredients--so easy, and I probably wouldn't have added hearts of palm to a regular salad on my own.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an easy and quick salad to make. I added some red wine vinegar and a little honey to the dressing.

Yum! The mint (I used fresh) adds so much flavor to this salad. Like the previous reviewer, I used artichoke hearts instead of hearts of palm. I thought this would need vinegar, but the tomatoes, artichokes, and olives give it enough of a tang. I'll probably try it with a touch of white wine vinegar at some point. A definite keeper!

the mint was a really nice touch. the oil and the avacado made sort of a paste that coated everything. Very good!

I loved this recipe, but I only gave it 4 stars, based on the changes that I made.  1. I used marinated avocado instead of hearts of palm.  I added fresh ground pepper.  I also added diced red pepper, sliced some string cheese, used kalamata olives and diced them very small, added agave nectar and white wine vinegar to the olive oil.  I didn't have any cucumber, although it would have been a nice touch.  Fresh mint would also have been nice, although the dried mint tasted light and really made the whole salad.  Overall, it's seriously one of the best salads I've ever eaten.  The avocado really adds a nice creamy touch, and the combination of savory and sweet ingredients is superb.

Fantastic salad, and SO easy to make! I used artichoke hearts and fresh mint. My husband and I both really liked this. Thanks for the great recipe.

Lovely.  Try adding a bit of chopped red onion.
