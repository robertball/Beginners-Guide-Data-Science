This really looked beautiful in the glass. But, I don't understand how this is a drink. It's just watered down strawberries. Are you supposed to drink all the water and then eat the strawberries? I ended up letting it sit for a day and then decided to add more water, blend it all and strain some of the seeds out. Thanks anyway.

I prefer my strawberries to be blended rather than in little chunks. The ratio of strawberries/water/sweetener are spot on. I wound up blending the strawberries much more to our liking.
