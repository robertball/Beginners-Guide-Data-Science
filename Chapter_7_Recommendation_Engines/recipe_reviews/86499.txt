This was a great recipe!! It was able to do it in about 10 min. with the help of small children.  I don't like pepper so I added chilli powder to give it some zest along with cheesy fish crackers for the kids.  Mc Cormicks spices are wonderful

I, too, agree, it is very close to the original.I did not use pepper, instead I sprinkled with garlic salt, use gold fish, pretzles and peanuts. Pretty good!

We like the traditional mix much better than this.
