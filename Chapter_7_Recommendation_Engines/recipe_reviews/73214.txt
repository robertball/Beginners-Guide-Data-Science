This was a great salad even though I used romaine.  My sun-dried tomatos weren't getting soft enough so I put them in 2 cups water and microwaved them for a minute - that worked great.  I put the pine nuts in the toaster oven and toasted 2 times on light - easier than broiler, didn't have to keep an eye on them.  I'd definately make this again.

Beautiful salad. As a timesaver, I just used store bought croutons and skipped the whole first part of the recipe. The colors were spectacular and I could see this ending up on a holiday buffet because of the gorgeous green/vibrant red color of the salad. Used a bag of romaine salad. Topped it off with a nice balsamic vinegarette. Husband said it had become one of his favorite salads because he loved all the different flavors.

Good but a lot of work if you make the croutons yourself.  The only thing I would change next time is use a different dressing since the family was not too thrilled with the balsamic vinaigrette (just our taste)  Presentation was really nice

Fabulous salad.  I admit I have never appreciated croutons. . . until now.  I think making your own croutons is totally worth the effort (what effort?  5-10 minutes is all it takes).  They are great, the salad is great.  I do not brown nuts under the broiler after catching some pecans on fire using that method a few years back.  Instead, I toast them on the stovetop in a pan without oil, over medium heat.  That way I can watch them more carefully, turn them easier, etc.

Great salad!  I used sun dried tomatoes that were packed in oil and drained them well.  The extra flavor from the oil complemented the salad nicely.

This recipe went over very well at a recent party. Everyone has been asking me for the recipe and several of us have made it again. It will become a staple in our house! It is a little on the expensive side when you buy all of the ingredients, but it was well worth the extra cost!

This salad was so good.  I was too tired to make my own crutons, so I just used boxed.  I only had the sun-dried tomatoes in oil and those worked fine.  I made my own balsamic vinegrette with a flavored olive oil.  I will make this salad again.  Maybe next time I will add some chicken.

This salad is delicious! I bought the croutons and used Romaine lettuce. My dressing is real simple and was perfect for this salad. Mix balsamic vinegar with olive oil in a bowl and taste before adding to salad.The Feta cheese should be soaked in cold water for about 20 minutes. I learned this from a Turkish friend.This salad is a keeper.

I cheated and added store bought croutons and used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts.  This was a fabulous salad.  Also added a balsamic vinaigrette.  Yummy!

This is seriously such a simple and tasty salad. I served it alongside Basil Feta Bruschetta and Puttanesca. The flavors all went together so perfectly. I topped the salad with some oil, vinegar, and a tiny bit of salt. It was great!

Made this for the first time this past Saturday. It was wonderful and also a very pretty salad. It got great reviews from the adults in the crowd. We have a family pizza night once a month with friends and although the pizza is a great thing and the kids gobble it up, I am always looking for new and different salads to serve that will wow the adults.

This was simply incredible and the best salad that I have ever tasted! I halved the recipe and it was enough for five of us with some left-overs. I also used crumbled goat cheese instead of the feta for personal preference. The left-overs didn't last long. My father and I attacked it for breakfast the next morning! The only thing that I wil do differently next time, is that I will add the croutons to each salad individually. This was so delicious that I will make the full amount next time to increase the left-over size and the croutons get soggy when stored in the salad. The presentation won't be as nice, but the taste is to die for! Thank you so much for this recipe. I don't usually care for croutons in my salad, but I loved these. This may very well be my favorite AR recipe!

Took others advice and added grilled chicken. I marinated it in olive oil vinagrette salad dressing for four hours first. Saved time and used store bought croutons. Delicious!

Excellent salad. Everyone just loved eat. Even guest who doesn't usually eat greens asked for extra portion. 

I used sliced almonds instead of pine nuts and skipped feta. I also used arugula instead of mixed salad greens.  My tomatoes were preserved in oil hence I didn't have soak them. I also find they have more flavor than dry ones. I didn't add any oil or salt - served them by side. Some people used oil, some (including me) preferred plain salad. And no one needed salt - the croutons came out rather salty.

I made this using my own croutons that I had stashed in the freezer, and well drained, oil packed sun dried tomatoes.  I used an Italian dressing, but only because we’ve had balsamic dressing a lot lately.  This was good and we enjoyed it with Happy Shrimp, also from this site.

I didn't make the croutons because I generally don't like them, and I also added some grilled chicken rubbed with oregano and Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning.  I made a dressing recipe found on this site called "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" as well.  The whole thing together was AWESOME, just the perfect combo of flavors, perfect texture.  A perfect go-to healthy meal.

Used chard instead of lettuce and it tasted ok. I also used sun dried tomatoes packed in oil as that is all I had.

I’ve made this quite a few times. It is delicious and I always grill up some chicken and make it a meal.
