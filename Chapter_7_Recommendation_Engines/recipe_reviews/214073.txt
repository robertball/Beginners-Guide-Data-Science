Great taste!  I made this with whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and honey instead of sugar. I love the light airy texture!

the bread bakes as one.  Think of this recipe like that of a monkey bread.  Once the individual pieces rise, it will bake as a whole loaf.  Hope that helps you.

Mine came out a little dry and overall, not that interesting.  I did substitute whole wheat flour for about half the total flour.

This recipe has a lot of potential but is pretty bland as is. Of course, there is the punch of the pepper which is great but the rest of the bread is doughy and flavorless. I like the idea of making them as rolls in a 9x13 pan and maybe adding some flavor to the dough. A mix of whole wheat and regular flour might help. Very easy. Upon further review (and eating leftovers!) I need to downgrade this - the bread is really not even worth eating, sorry.

I'm telling you, I had my doubts about this one, but this is  so wonderful served with soup or stew! It is a denser hearty bread that cant go unnoticed at the table.  Will definitely make again.

Tis bread was super easy to make and it tasted very good. It was a bit dense but went well with the soup that I served it with. I highly recommend this recipe
