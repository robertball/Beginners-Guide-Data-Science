This was so fantastic!  I might not have added quite a 1/2 cup cilantro packed, but other than that I made it exactly as shown and my guests just raved about it.  No one felt guilty about dipping away.  Even non-cilantro lovers didn't notice at all and sucked it down before I could tell them what was in it!  Thank you for a fabulous recipe we can feel good about serving.

Fabulous recipe!  Incredibly simple to make and so delicious!  I served it with pita chips and crudites.  My guests loved it and almost everyone asked for the recipe!

I didn't realize that soybeans came shelled or unshelled, so used 1/2 of a 28 oz. bag of unshelled beans, cooked them, and put the seeds into the blender.  Instead of 1/2 cup tahini, I just used 1/2 cup sesame seeds.  I did not add salt.  This makes a pretty color green hummus!  Great taste!

Very healthy recipe, but I think it has far too much tahini.  Next time I'll add the tahini tablespoon by tablespoon and taste until the amount is right for our preferences.  I also prefer a bit more garlic.

Saw this served in an upscale restaurant and thought I would try it at home.  This recipe pretty much nailed it.  Tasted great to both myself and my wife.  We shall see if our guests enjoy it too.

This dip was pretty amazing! I would hold off on some of the lemon juice because it was a little too sour. Also it taste great without tahini if you dont have any.

I made this for the first time after eating something similar at a sushi restaurant with my husband where they serve this as a starter. I was so happy to find the recipe here! The only thing I did not have was the tahini, so I omitted it and it still turned out really yummy! Even better then the sushi palce's according to my hubby. I will definityl be making this again when we have visitors. It's quick, easy, and delicious!

This is amazing!  I forgot I didn't have tahini so instead I added a tablespoon of greek yogurt and a little bit of extra water to help with the consistency.  I like things hotter so I also added some extra cayenne.   Really tasty.

Yum! Added soy sauce instead of olive oil, less cilantro, broth instead of water, and more garlic.

This is one of the BEST things I've made in a long time.  It will be my go-to from now on.  I was heavy with the cilantro, light with the tahini.  Used Tony Chacere's and tabisco instead of cayenne. YUM!

Our new favorite hummus. My son is alergic to sesame, but it still comes out great without the tahini.  I just add extra garlic! This is great served with carrots and jimica.  I also use bagged salad croutons for simple dipping.

4.5 Stars: This is a great hummus. I left out tahini and added a bit more water and oil.  The cilantro is strong, but not overwhelming.

Good god, this stuff is incredible.  I was looking to make something hummus-y but had no chick peas and no tahini.  Probably a bad sign... but then I found this recipe!  I whipped up some tahini with sesame seeds and oil, took frozen edamame from the fridge, and boom--sprinkle in that garlic and cilantro--and suddenly I had delectable hummus.

Indeed, this is surprisingly delicious.  I've eaten it with carrots, and I've put it on a sandwich with some feta.  

Can't wait to make it again!

This is so, so good! I ate this with corn chips. I used only a 1/4 cup sesame seeds, instead of tahini, and omitted the cayenne pepper. Delish! I will serve this at my next football party.

This is really tasty and such  a pretty green color. I had no tahini so I used some of the cooking water, a little bit of Greek yogurt and extra olive oil. Ate it with tortilla chips and baby carrots.

Next time I think I'll cut back a bit on the tahini. It's very strong and somewhat overpowers the other flavors.

Delicious. I followed others' advice to cut down on the tahini, which was the right move. I did add more garlic, but otherwise everything else was the same.

I used the full amount of tahini the recipe called for, and thought it was perfect.  I love tahini, though, and the lemon juice offset the tahini perfectly.  

Great recipe!  My coworkers really enjoyed the dish, as did my family.  We always keep hummus on-hand, and since we eat very little meat or dairy, this will be a valuable boost to our protein intake.

What a wonderful hummus! I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: I steamed the frozen edamame/mukimame beans for a full 10 minutes to tenderness. I had no tahini, so I made it without. I added everything into the processor except the cumin and cayenne, my idea being to taste before adding. I processed the mix until smooth, then tasted. Perfection! Next time, I will make this exactly as written, but for my trial effort, I couldn't be happier. Lastly, the hummus was fun to garnish with a few makimame beans, a sprig of cilantro, and a drizzle of olive oil, which made the dip look as good as it tastes. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I've made this a few times and it never fails to elicit requests for the recipe from friends. This is the only thing I cool that people always rave about. No changes no tweaks. The recipe is perfect as is.

Very good! I did add a little less tahini than called for (I really just eyeballed it), and needed to add a bit more lemon juice and salt, but those were my personal preferences. Really nice flavor! I would've never thought to make hummus with edamame, but it's a really great idea, and the best part was that I already had everything in the house to make it, including fresh cilantro from the garden! :) I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is my family's new favorite hummus. I used 1/4 cup of tahini and used dried cilantro, but otherwise made no other alterations. Great stuff!

Love this dip! I've made it several time now and am always happy with the way it turns out. The only change I make is to cut down the amount of edamame used typically by 3/4 cup of edamame ( this measurement is of edamame still in the pod). Just saves these as a snack and then the flavour of the dip pops.

Very tasty! I didn't add any tahini either and reduced the lemon juice. Unlike typical hummus that's smooth, I didn't blend too long -- and appreciated that there was still some texture. Great with naan bread!

This recipe was amazing! Made it for the first time last night to bring to a dinner party and it was a hit! I only added a TBSP of tahini due to some of the other reviewers' comments. I think you can even leave it out and it's amazing. Super quick and easy!

Awesome. As good as any edamame hummus I've had in a restaurant. I did not have fresh cilantro so I used dry & it was still amazing!

Easy recipe and everyone loved it! I used frozen shelled edamame and just microwaved it. I doubled the chayanne pepper since we like a little spicier option. And I used a little more cilantro bc I had extra - delicious!

Spectacular.   I added a little more garlic and salt because I like a stronger flavor with both of those ingredients. It's a personal preference maybe not for all of you   Also I drizzle a little extra olive oil on top of hummus once it is in serving bowl.
