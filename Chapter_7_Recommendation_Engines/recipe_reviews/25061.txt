Loved it! Except for one thing, you definately have to decrease the confectioners sugar to 2 cups or it will put you in a diabetic coma! made a second batch with 2 cups, and it was to die for!!!

Very decadent and rich!!! but very quick and easy. I used Duncan Hines Butter recipe cake mix, used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and also sprinkled more chips on top after baking. I decreased confectioners sugar to 2 and 1/2 cups as suggested. Will make again, so quick easy and good. Thanks Carol!

I was excited to try this recipe, but I won't be making it again. It's like eating raw cookie dough with extra sugar and butter added. I used half the amount of sugar called for, but they still turned out way too sweet! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE sweet desserts, but this was just too much.  My husband and friends agreed. I also found the cake dough to be fairly hard to work with (very crumbly and difficult to spread), and the cream cheese layer is too thick and sticky to pour evenly over the chips. Better to simply mix the chips in with the cream cheese and save yourself some trouble.

I took the other reviewers suggestions and cut the sugar back by a cup and it came out wonderful. I was looking for something cheap, delicious and easy to take to a last minute dinner innivation. They were all gone in five minutes flat! I couldn't believe it. This recipe is a keeper.

This is such a wonderful recipe, I keep making it and modifying it.  I have used regular sugar with excellent result and I have reduced the sugar to 3/4 Cup and it turns out fine.  My latest modification was to use lemon cake mix and white chocolate chunks.  It makes a great lemon slice.

YUM!!!!this was soo delicious!!I'm soo glad i tried it. I was almost afraid to because it had gotten some iffy reviews and im not a big fan of cake mixes, but it was extremely delicious!! Like some of the other reviewers i also used only 2 cups of conf. sugar, and i added 4tbsp of melted butter to the cream cheese mix because i noticed most of the other gooey butter cake recipes had butter in the filling as well, and it turned out really well. I do agree that the cake portion is a bit dry but altogether it was well worth it.

These were very good but I did make changes.  First I do  not think that it is possible to spread the mixture because of the thickness.  I ended up having to press it in the pan.  I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and that was perfect and still sweet but not overly sweet.  (3-1/2 cups seems like way too much).  I threw the ingredients for the topping in the food processor and it poured nicely and evenly and the result was a nice cheese-like topping.  Will be making again.  Thanks

I make this all the time and my friends love it! lots of people ask for this recipe. yes, it sticks to my teeth, but that's what sweets do. I sometimes make a half recipe in an 8x8 pan with a cupcake mix that is half the size of a cake mix. I also cook it a little longer so the topping isn't as gooey (I am paranoid about cooking the eggs through) and with a little brown on top, it makes for an almost marshmallow top.

The idea of this recipe is good but it doesn't quite turn out.  The bottom layer is too dry and the top a little too sweet.  I think with tinkering it could be good so I'm going to work on it.

Who are the crazy people that said this dessert is too sweet? This is a family favorite and it is beyond addictive, decadent and over-the-top sweet. Make the bars small and also try them without the chocolate chips. AMAZING.

absolutely delicious, maybe a trifle too much even for unrepentant sweettooths...I'll try with less confectioner's sugar, but congratulations all the same.

As everyone else said, they are a rich, decadent, incredibly sweet bar.  I think it's missing something:  a tsp of vanilla in the cream cheese?  toasted almonds or coconut on the top before baking?  And I probably won't try any more recipes that use cake mix, just way too much added sugar.  I think this would be better with a shortbread cookie-like crust, and if I EVER make this again I would cut the sugar way down.

Just an okay treat.  I used 2 cups powdered sugar which was just the right sweetness on top.  It didn't go over well at our gathering though.

DELICIOUS!
After reading the reviews and a similar recipe, I decreased the powdered sugar to 2 1/2 cups, added a couple of extra tablespoons of butter to the dough and used my hands to spread it into the pan.  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture to add more of a cookie dough flavor.  I put about 3/4 cup of choc chips on top of dough and also put 3/4 cup mixed into the cream cheese mixture.  It turned out perfect! It DOES taste like eating choc chip cookie dough...so I could see where some might not like it, but it is my new favorite, I'll definitely make this again!
UPDATE:  I made this recipe again following the recipe EXACTLY and it actually came out better than it did with the alterations.  It is very sweet, but it is less "gooey"  and more set if you use all the sugar (3 1/2 cups).  I believe the taste was better as well.  I took it to a party and tons of people wanted the recipe, so it was a hit!

These are yummy, but I did change to suit what I had on hand.  I used a chocolate cake mix, 12oz of cream cheese with 3 eggs and 4 C of powdered sugar.  I also used a 10x15 pan because I like them not to be so thick.  Turned out wonderful.

these are great I also cut down the powdered sugar to 2 cups. Tried this with a chocolate cake and peanut butter chips. Very good also. Now will try a chocolate cake with andes mint chips. I tried these with the Andes Mint chips.  They were AWESOME. This is the best recipe yet. I also have tried different flavors of cake with many combinations of chips!! Excellant recipe.

I'm only 12 years old and I made these cookies alone. This recipie was easy to make. The whole family enjoys snacking on them. I used 2 cups of conf. sugar. The cream cheese really brings out flavor.

This is another easy, delicious recipe!  A must for bake sales.  I called it Triple Layer Gooey Bars since there were three layers of sweetness!  You can't go wrong with these bars.  Try them!

This recipe is missing something.  The main cake batter recipe is way to dry without enough moisture to be poured in the pan.  The cream cheese mixture did not mix to a texture that could be poured over the top.  It was not well thought out or someone did not write it correctly.  Not typical for the quality of recipes normally found on this website.

I made this without the cream cheese topping ( I just wanted the cookie bar) and it turned out excellent and was so quick and easy to make.  Since I was only making the cookie part I adjusted the cook time accordingly.

The solution to the dry crust!  Add one box of vanilla instant pudding and 1/4c water to the cake mix batter, and the crust will be moist.  Also extra chocolate chips on top will help the chocoholic.

I've made these for years (got the recipe from a roommate in college) but could never make them without them turning into sugary CEMENT in the pan.  I think the comments made for this recipe solved my problems with different amounts than my current recipe!  Another tip I have though... instead of sprinkling chocolate chips, stir them into the cake mix layer.  It makes the cream cheese layer much easier to spread.

Turned out great and so easy!  I used 3/4 cup of regular white sugar.  It was not to rich. I will definately make these again.

These were awesome and easy to make!  I followed the recipe for everything except I left the chocolate chips out, because I used to make these as a kid but without the chocolate chips and thats what I was craving, but I am sure they are just as good if not better with them in.

These were terrific!  My kids couldn't wait for dinner to be over so they could try them - huge hit with everyone here and SO very simple to make.  I took the advice in the reviews also and only used 2 cups of powdered sugar.  I'm making these again for sure.

This tasted fine- sweet and rich.  Kids would go crazy over it. If you don't like the taste of cake mix, which flavor is very strong with just the few ingredients for the base- you should skip this one, because that artificial taste is very strong in this recipe!

My photo is of my take on this great quick recipe used caramel cake mix for bottom cake and used philly cream cheese that had pecans and honey already added and uses hazelnut  flavoring instead of vanilla came out of oven great will repost after it cools and I cut it.

Very easy to make. I didn't have enough powdered sugar but I made it anyway. I didn't think it turned out but everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. I will make sure to have enough powdered sugar BEFORE I start the recipe next time!

I made this recipe around the kids' bedtime last night, and half of the bars were already gone when I left for work this morning.  I have made these as written and have also used a recipe that is identical except for  the addition of a stick of melted butter to the top layer.  Both are very good.  The recipe with the extra butter is obviously less healthy, but the extra butter makes for a fluffier top layer.  The one recommendation that I would make is that you can get away with reducing the amount of powdered sugar.  I've never used more than 3 cups, and sometimes use less than that.  You can get away with granulated sugar if that's all you have on hand.  I also use my stand mixer to beat the crust mixture for 2 minutes at medium speed.  My crust has a better texture when I do that.  I found the crust to be a little bit dry when I just mixed it by hand.  Okay, so I had more than one suggestion!  One last thing - I had to extend my baking time to 45 minutes.

Can't say I like these, but I didn't have any problems with anything being dry or not being gooey.  I just don't like the combo of chocolate with the cake and cream cheese.  I think I'd like it much better with fruit jam or just fruit instead.  I did use regular sugar, and 3/4 c of it per another reviewer.  Very sweet and rich. I had to bake an extra 15 min though.  Maybe bf will like it better than I do. Thanks for sharing.

Very sweet & rich but we love stuff super-sweet so that's great for us. They are better on day 2 after the top has set fully. We liked them a lot!

Too rich for me, but the family loved it! I made this over the holidays but all I had was M&M's (red and green), so I used 1/2 cup and they turned out great and added some holiday color to the center. The men loved them!

I followed the recipe and these bars were easy and delicious.  I didn't find them too sweet but I have a sweet tooth and have loved other gooey bar recipes.  I baked them late at night in a bit of a rush for a party and everything turned out great. I am keeping this recipe.  

Thanks!

This recipe was okay, but VERY rich..extremely sweet, and I only used 2 cups of sugar like everyone else suggested.  I can't imagine if I used 3 1/2 cups how sweet it would've been.  I wasn't very impressed...it's definitely "gooey" but it was too sweet for anyone in my house..

Had bought a desert mix called
"Ooey Gooey" at Sam's Club that was very similar and this recipe goes above and beyond! Made exactly as directed and used Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a grocery store brand cake mix...AWESOME! Rich! Satisfied a major chocolate craving. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't like this recipe. The top was okay, similar to a 7 layer bar flavor, but the bottom was like dry hard cake with no flavor. I won't make this again.

Sorry-these are not a winner in my book. They are way too sweet and instead of a "good" gooey they seem to be underbaked. This is not a keeper for me and my family.

Although this recipe sounded good, I threw the entire batch away.  They taste as though something is missing in the cake layer, kind of sandy. They are also pretty unappetizing in appearance. I bake alot and would definitely not make this again...

Yum, yum, yum!  Rave review on this all around.  I only used 2 c powdered sugar as suggested by others and it came out so perfect!  You can just barely tell it's cream cheese on top... it's just yummy decadence in my book, especially for being such an easy bar-type cookie.  These cut just perfect for me after an hour or two in the refrigerator... definitely can't cut while warm at all though unless you don't care whether or not they cut 'cleanly'.

After all the hype, I found these just okay.  The cheesecake-like topping was more fluffy than it was gooey and the cake part seemed just dense and buttery to me.  Gooey just wasn't the right word to describe these.  They're very rich, but I don't think the taste is something I'd crave...sort of strange presentation and strange taste too.

If you have a sweet tooth, these are definitely for you!!!  Word of caution, I made these to take to a friend and they are not "pretty" when cut.  They taste great but don't present that well.
The gooey definitely makes them hard to "clean cut".
