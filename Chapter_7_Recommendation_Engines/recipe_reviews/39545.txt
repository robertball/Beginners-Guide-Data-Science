Sorry Miss Elly, this soup turned out far too watery and bland for my tastes.  I followed your recipe to the letter, took some to work, and realized how much it was missing.  I scaled this to 12 servings.  When I got home, I added one can of diced tomatoes, one large can of tomato sauce, 1 small can of tomato paste, 3/4 cup of light sour cream (remember, 12 servings), a half cup of red wine, one teaspoon of chicken broth granules for every two cups of water, basil, salt and pepper.  Now it's got body, taste, and still not a lot of fat.  If this sounds too much like work, read the other recipes that use heavy cream, cheddar, and a lot of butter.  After my additions, it wins the 5 stars.  Thanks for the good working base recipe.

I enjoyed this soup.  I was in a bit of a time crunch, so instead of using fresh tomatos and potatos I used about 7-8 canned whole tomatos and 3/4 of a can of sliced potatos.  I also used the liquid from the tomatos in place of some of the water.  Using canned veggies cut the first cooking time down quite a bit since the veggies didn't have to soften.  I also added about a tablespoon of beef boullion granuals toward the end for a little more flavor.  I'll make this again.

I used only 3 cups of water, and I love the consistency!  Instead of a white potato, I used a sweet potato.  This is some good soup!  We will be making this again!

Very time consuming, on the bland and watery side :(

Not a commercial tomato soup lover but this was especially good!  Added two veggie broth cubes to it and cooked the rice before adding it.

I don't know what I did wrong, it was super bland and the rice still wasn't cooked after an hour of simmering.  It took half the day to make, not worth all the trouble.

This is very good!  I did add six beef boullion cubes for salt and additional flavor.  Plus about a tablespoon of kosher salt.  It's nice and salty, just like I prefer it.

It's a good base to a tomato soup.  Added celery, carrots, a red pepper, basil, oregano and thyme.  No rice!  Pureed it when it was done.  Delicious with the extras!

I omitted the rice, used canned tomatoes and the juice from the can instead of water. I also used just a little bit of milk  (we like our soup creamy) and veggie stock. I sauteed the garlic and spices (I added parsley and thyme) with the onion and subbed a sweet potato instead of the potatoes. Turned out pretty decent.

I actually took parts of this recipe and the Tomato Basil to make my soup. Mmmm. Mmmm.
