OMG, this is the almost the exact recipe I've been using for years.  I learned how to make these from my mom.  I like using El Pato brand Mexican style hot tomato sauce and instead of jack cheese I always use Mexican cotija or queso fresco cheeses(Cacique Brand or El Mexicano Brand) (my mom would kill me if I dared to Americanize chilaquiles!  She'd consider it sinful!)  I also use crema fresca which is a Mexican style fresh cream that gives Mexican dishes a unique cool taste.  You can usually find these in the cheese aile where you find all the Mexican cheeses.

This is pretty good.  I agree there is alot of tortillas, but here are some suggestions to make this lighter.  With a pizza cutter, slice the tortillas into strips and spray with PAM and bake until crispy.  Also I love Salsa Verde so you can get green enchilada sauce and use this as well, one large can would be perfect for 30 tortillas.

I have been making this for years. Got the recipe verbally from a friend a long time ago and was glad to see it posted here.  I use 1/2 red and 1/2 green sauce for a nice taste variety.  There are many (eggless) variations you can use with this recipe.  All green sauce with boiled shredded chicken, all red sauce with ground beef in layers for an lasagna type meal.  This is traditionally served with the egg fried and laid on top of the mixture which is another option.  Always a hit and very easy.

Really filling, really good.  Not the prettiest though.  Definitely don't leave out the salt.  I can see why this is a hangover helper - the grease from the tortillas could settle any stomach!  I used flour tortillas and taco sauce by Ortega, and will make this every time I'm hung over!  I bet it'd be great   with corn tortillas. Had it for dinner and it was enough to fill!  Bet it would be a great Sunday brunch where you expect your meal to hold you til dinner.  **UPDATE: I cut up the tortillas and sprayed both sides with cooking spray, then baked them for 15 minutes at 400 degrees and they tasted the same as fried, but healthier!

This was delicious but I made quite a few changes:  First, I made a homemade enchilada sauce to use instead of the mexican hot tomato sauce (I made Red Enchilada sauce off this site).  Then, I sauteed the onions in a pan until tender and then added the eggs to the same pan and cooked until firm.  I did NOT add the tortilla strips to the pan with the eggs and onions, rather I put some tortilla strips on each plate, topped with eggs/onion mixture then enchilada sauce and then the cheese.  Oh, and I added a dollop of sour cream.  Not the quickest breakfast but great for a hangover!  (Really)

Boy, I'm sorry but this was a pretty big disappointment.  First of all, I read the recipe and thought "The proportions are all wrong."  Thirty (30!) tortillas vs. six eggs??  Uh-uh.  But, not having made chilaquiles before, I followed the recipe faithfully (except for the cheese, adding cotija instead of Monterey Jack).

I used a 12" cast iron skillet, but there's no way it could even come close to holding the 30 tortillas.  I got maybe 20 in there.  With that, the tortillas overwhelmed the eggs.  If I made again (doubtful), I would have a dozen eggs and 10 tortillas.  1/2 cup of water and the enchilada sauce was not enough to cook down the tortillas, either.  I added more water, but that even wasn't enough.  

Not sure why this has gotten such rave reviews.  Nothing close to the wonderful chilaquiles I've had in restaurants before.  Too bad--was WAY looking forward to it.

This recipe is very similar to one that a friend shared with me. The only thing I did different was that I reduced the amount of tortillas. I used one corn tortilla to one egg for the ratio and then used cheddar cheese and less oil. I also topped it off with a spoonful of sour cream (VIEW MY PHOTO). Thank you Jessica for the recipe!

Great! Just like I used to get in a downtown Chicago diner. My tortillas don't get as crispy as I'd like, but I suspect that's because I use olive oil for the frying. This is easy to prepare, very filling, and has just enough heat to wake you up Sunday mid-morning.

Pretty good i made a few minor changes. Gives a good idea of where to start with this.  Ok, here are the changes I made:
first I did not add the eggs (I prefer those on the side), then I also made and topped it with my own hot sauce about 1-1/2 cups, I used 2 cups of water, and I added a package of chorizo (cooked it), to it and topped it with about 1-1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese.  
I guess I pretty much changed the whole thing, but I did not prefer it the way it was here.

Made this for breakfast today!  So glad I did. Made with all ingredients (use El Pato) except with a slightly time saving step. Used 1 Tbs butter and fried up the onion. Dumped in 5 handfuls of tortilla chips mixed them around and proceeded with recipe. YUMMMMM!

After having a Mexican student make this for the class, I had to find out how to make it.  This recipe was closest to how she said her mom made it.

It was good, but I even cut down on the tortillas to 10, and it was too many.  I used El Pato for the sauce because the student said that was what her mom uses.  I also think next time I might try tortilla chips instead of the regular tortillas because I want more crunch.  Still tasty, and helps me to try to replicate the yummy food my student brought in

I really like this recipe...just how we find it in Texas.  To cut down some of the fat, cut your tortillas, spray with pam and bake at 450 until brown.  They come out really good.  I also sometimes use egg beaters.  Finally, for a little twist, brown chorizo and onion, then add the eggs and chips.  You can also use the soy chorizo from trader joes if you want to be healthier.  It is pretty decent...I grew up with chorizo in my mexican household and still like the soy version!

These were really good!  We cut the tortillas up and lightly sprayed them with olive oil and toasted in the oven at 450 for 10-15 minutes instead of frying.  We used the El Pato hot mexican tomato sauce and it had a nice flavor with a medium kick (it was too spicy for the kids so next time I will try it with a mild enchilada sauce).  But that's the beauty of this recipe - it is very versatile.  You can change up the sauce (red, green, canned, homemade) add chicken if you wanted and even vary the type of cheese.  I will definitely make this again and try it a different way each time.  Thanks for submitting!

fabulous!  exactly like we have eaten many times in Mexico.  the first time, i followed the recipe very closely - green sauce instead of red (personal pref) & added 1 lb baked shredded chicken.  a few changes i will make next time:  1.) broil the tortilla strips with canola spray & kosher salt instead of frying to make it a bit healthier & crispier.  2.) then fry the onions in much less oil.  3.) top with a little lite sour cream after plated.

One of the most important thing to learn when cooking Mexican food is, keep it simple, keep it basic, do not stray from this recipe. I did not have Mexican style hot tomato sauce so I used salsa verde and it turned out wonderful. Next time I will use the red sauce as the recipe calls for. My fiance who is Mexican said it tasted just like his mothers and was very authentic. Which to me is very important. Will make again with out any changes.

These were very tasty, but not quite as good as I remember them being in Mexico. I'm not really sure what the writer of the recipe meant by a can of Mexican style hot tomato sauce. I decided that it meant enchilada sauce and that is what I used. Perhaps this is why it wasn't as good as it could have been. Next time I'll try making my own enchilada sauce instead of buying it from a can. I read the reviews and used a 1 egg to 1 tortilla ratio (almost-- I used 8 tortillas and 6 eggs because that was what I had on hand). I also sprayed my tortillas with pam and baked them in the oven as other reviewers suggested.

This was very yummy.  I'm not sure still if I liked the frying of the tortillas and onions together because some of the onions get browned, which makes them a tad bitter.  But, I think that might also add to the flavor so not sure I would want to change it.  Also, I didn't have any salsa or Mexican tomato sauce so I used a small can of tomatoes sauce, cut-up a few tomatoes, paprika, chili powder, cumin, about 6-7 slivers of canned jalapeÃ±os, less than 1/4 teaspoon of jarred crushed garlic, salt, pepper, 1 tbsp. of butter, and then pulled some of the onions from the tortilla mixture and used those (I was being lazy...I didn't want to cut any more onions) - put all in a saucepan,  brought to a boil and then let simmer while preparing the eggs, tortillas etc.  I used median blend shredded cheese for topping because I had no jack cheese.  I served with a dollop of crema and a few canned jalapeÃ±os on the side.  My hubby and daughter who are pretty picky, loved it...their plates are clean!!  Yummy!

Forget frying your own chips, using store bought chips are the way to go! I spray the pan with Pam, then toss in a few handful of tortilla strips chips, then add egg beaters and mix it all together. While that is cooking I quickly mix one can of tomato sauce with 1/2 cup water, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder and a few dashes of Valentina mexican hot sauce. I add that to the pan and let simmer for a few minutes. Top with grated monterey jack, and you have yourself a great authentic breakfast! My hubby (who is Mexican American) asks for this every weekend!

Love this. Very similar to how it's made in restaurants in my area. Corn tortillas are a must for flavor, IMO, but the recipe's very forgiving otherwise. All sorts of variations are out there. I personally like tomatillo sauce in place of hot tomato and queso fresco, queso blanco or cojito in place of Monterey Jack. Also nice to garnish with crema fresca and cilantro. Can substitute milk for the water (I've even heard of white vinegar being used, but never tried it myself). Just toss in what you prefer and as long as you cook it right (don't dry out the eggs!), it's awesome.

I expected this to be like a "hot frittata," but it wasn't.  I like eggs but they aren't necessarily very exciting.  So I wasn't sure what I'd think of this but had some eggs that were needing used up and thought I'd give it a shot.  This was a most pleasant surprise as I loved it.  I tasted little of the egg.  I knew that 30 tortillas seemed extreme and noticed some people doing a 1:1 ratio with the eggs.  I was leary of too many tortillas so I actually only used 3 for the whole thing (as though the zero wasn't supposed to be there).  I think more would be OK but no more than 6.  And no need to turn on the oven for nothing -- works fine to cook the tortillas in a pan sprayed with Pam.  I had no clue what the hot tomato sauce was, and saw that people were using enchilada sauce.  So I decided to try taco sauce.  Another thing I was leary of cause it seemed that would make it terribly hot, but it worked out quite well.  I think I ended up with the basic idea but with a lot less tortillas.  Even served it up with the suggested refried beans cause that was easy.  I made this for dinner - I'm darn curious why this works for a hangover cause I don't think my stomach could hack this for breakfast.  (And I don't get hangovers.  I've had a few hang-during's but never a hangover.)

Very easy and very good. Tweak the spiciness to taste. I usually use 2 jalapenos and don't take out the seeds. Also I think monterey jack works best for this.

EDIT- This is a good recipe, but there are several things I'll do differently next time, so I'm only giving 4 stars.  I found that 30 corn tortillas was WAY too much - 3 per person is plenty IMO. Also, next time I'll find a way to fry the tortillas without so much oil - shallow fry or spray with oil and bake... something healthier though.  This would also prevent bitter burnt onions from frying them with the tortillas.  Lastly, the eggs were interesting mixed in with the tortillas, but this is the first time I've ever had them that way, and I think I prefer them on the side.  Having said all that, the flavor and texture is excellent and this is a pretty simple/basic recipe anyone can make at home.  Thanks for posting!

Looks can be deceiving!! Not the prettiest looking thing but this tasted very good! I didn't use 30 corn tortillas, I used 6 that I cut into strips. I fried them in just enough canola oil to cover the bottom of the pan, don't really need two cups. I didn't use the water but I did use 7 oz of mexican tomato sauce. Very good!!

So this recipe was delicious one of the best chilaquiles recipe I have found. I did change it up a bit i only used about half of the tortillas. I also cooked up some chorizo to add to it when you add the eggs. Turned out so good. Also El Pato mexican style hot tomato sauce goes perfect in this dish!

Thanks for the recipe!  I love chilaquiles but had never made them myself until today.  I was actually surprised to see the recipe called for eggs because I have never noticed egg in chilaquiles before.  Those who are startled by the number of tortillas in this recipe should know that chilaquiles is a dish comprised primarily of corn tortillas.  If you like the idea of scrambled eggs with some tortillas mixed in, look for a recipe for "migas" instead.

YUM. This was very good. I added an extra egg though as it just seemed to need a bit more. Some of the tortillas stayed crispy adn that was my favorite part. Super easy to fix, fast too, and a great brunch for me. I topped this with a bit of hot sauce as the mexican tomato sauce (I used Del Fuerte brand) is very very mild. Thanks for a winner!

I first had Chilaquiles while in Cabo on my honeymoon, I fell in love with it but I never asked anyone the name.  Then I stumbled upon this recipe a few weeks ago and I have been in heaven ever since!!  I've made it three times, each time with a new variation.  Flour tortillas - baked not fried and I even used white corn tortilla chips - both turned out great.  But my favorite variation has been to use diced green chiles instead of onion and mix a can of green enchilada sauce mixed with some spicy hot sauce instead of the mexican style tomato sauce.   My husband is always requesting this now!  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

There are so different ways to make this wonderful dish, I always use green onions just a personal taste:) I also use tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas only because it cuts the time in half and it cuts back on the oil.I just fill a deep skilket with broken tortilla chips and fry them
in a little oil they come out just as good as using corn tortillas.

Staying in a small village in Baja CA I learned how delicious, humble, and thrifty recipes such as this can be. Chilaquiles are one of my favs: it's a different take on "chili mac" or "kitchen sink soup" where you use any/all leftovers. The locals would hand make corn tortillas daily. All leftovers were left to dry. I rarely use as much oil/manteca/fat as locals do: it's an important source of calories for many households as animal protein/fat can be scarce: one chicken/fish may be stretched for a week. I also love pinto beans and fresh pico de gallo topped with grated Mexican cheese. Some of these cheeses melt, others are the crumbly, pungent kind. Feel free to add what you have/what your family would like. Can use broth if you hate tomato sauce, diff. meat, soy protein/tofu, and can be casserole-like or more like nachos. Personally I use a very light coating of oil/cooking spray and crisp tortilla pieces in the oven instead of frying at all. Can use pre-made chips but we find it too salty.

Wow!!!  This recipe is awesome!  Everyone loved it including kids of all ages.  I followed the advice of others and baked the tortillas sprayed with Pam.  The flavor did not suffer at all.  I also used fewer tortillas and more Mexican tomato sauce. We will make this again and again - thanks for the recipe!!!!

Istead of using Mexican tomato sauce, I used a regular can of tomato sauce, just because I already had it in my pantry. I added a small can of chopped green chiles, oregano and cumin. I used Mission brand corn tortilla strips instead of frying my own. It turns out just as delicous and it's so much faster. I topped the bowls the traditional way, with crema, queso fresco and our favorite Salsa Valentina. I've made chilaquiles for years but I've never scrambled the eggs in with the tortillas this way. I've always put a fried egg on top. I liked them better this way, it turned out delicous.

Mmmmm... just like I had in Mexico!  I had no idea it was this easy.  Instead of making my own chips, I used some leftover store bought ones and of course, left the salt out of the recipe.  I used the idea of another user and added a dollop of sour cream, but I'm not sure if I liked it that way or not... it sort of overpowered the mild taste of the eggs.  Great recipe though!

Amazingness! I baked the tortillas instead of fried for obvious reasons. Used Sprouts organic green enchilada sauce because it's what I had at the house. Really versatile recipie; I'm sure all variations are amazing. So simple on a work night if the chips are prepped and ready to go.

I just made this using leftovers from a Mexican meal my husband and I had a couple of days ago. I'd brought home a large container of leftover tortilla chips, largely broken, and was looking for some way to use them. It worked great! I just mixed some of the leftover salsa (which was too hot for my hubby) with some tomato sauce to tone it down, simmered the busted chips in it, and cracked some eggs in. I covered it, and once the whites had set, I sprinkled some cheese on top, covered it and let it melt.  Super yummy, and a great way to use those leftover chips (which meant I also could skip the frying step and the extra oil-bonus).

Literally woke up craving chilaquiles and this recipe was greatly satisfying and super easy. *improvizations: I  used barely 1/4cup of evoo to fry my tortillas to keep it healthy, mixed a tsp of powdered caldo de pollo (chicken boullion) with the water in place of using salt, and mixed some jarred red and green salsa remnants lingering in the fridge + a 8oz can of tomato sauce.  Also threw in some leftover cooked chicken at the end.  Super success!

Even faster/easier method is to use tortilla chips and store-bought red enchilada sauce. Scramble the eggs and chips together in a small amount of oil, add some enchilada sauce, sprinkle with shredded Mexican blend cheese and serve with sour cream and whatever other garnishes you like.

I appreciated the recipe.  I ended up doing a little tweaking of my own based on other reviews.  I sprayed with butter flavored spray three whole wheat flour tortillas (that's what I had on hand)and baked them in oven until crispy. Sprayed a pan and cooked a whole chopped onion until soft and golden. Then added the eggs and the tortillas cut in strips. Next was some enchilada sauce I had left over and some salsa with it. When eggs were mostly finished, I added chopped leftover cooked chicken breasts and the shredded cheese over the top and covered to finish cooking.  Delicious.

I added 3-times the cheese the recipe calls for.  Next time I would add additional water so the Chilaquiles are softer; less crunchy, which I prefer.  All in all, a very nice recipe.

The ratio of tortillas to eggs is wrong. I made 2 eggs to 3 tortillas. I would suggest a 2:2 ratio. I used Ortega hot sauce since I couldn't get my hands on El Pato sauce. I will be making it again soon, but this time I will be correcting the recipe cause it is worth 5 stars once I get it right!

my college boyfriend and i argued at length about eggs scrambled in or fried on the side (the way my family makes it). i  prefer on the side as mixed in tends to make it soggy.  el pato is definitely the way to go for sauce.

I cheated and used store bought tortilla chips (half a bag I had left over). First, I sauteed some sliced onion, added a few eggs, then the chips. I couldn't find the spicy tomato sauce so I substituted a small can of enchilada sauce. I also added a can of black beans (rinsed) and some shredded pork then simmered the mixture until heated through. Topped with melted cheese, fresh chopped tomatoes, and sour cream it was like a cross between enchiladas and nachos and tasted really good!

Made at my husband's request.  It was good but 30 tortillas seems extreme - I used 13 and still needed to add more tomato sauce.  Topped with crumbled cojita cheese.

Delicious and easy! I used leftover store-bought tortilla chips, and sprinkled in a very small amount of leftover taco meat (ground beef). Yummy breakfast - my kids loved it too.

I made it with half the tortillas. I would use half the salt next time as well.  I fried the tortillas first, then sauteed the onions with some garlic in the pan before adding the tortillas and eggs. For the tomato sauce, I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce with 3 tablespoons of chili powder and a half teaspoon of cumin and oregano.  It filled a 12-inch skillet.

For those of you who prefer to use a Mexican cheese over the jack cheese?, you could sub Queso Oaxaca for the jack cheese.

Alot of people are always looking for that one special ingredient, that one swift move  that abuela used in her home cooked meals that no one has been able to catch. Each reciepe has one or many...this one has two ( in my opinion )  that i did not see. Home made salsa is the closest to authentic/homemade we can get and after the tortillas are drained abit, add the salsa.....let it fry in the oil just a bit then add the eggs....give it a try and let me know what you think .

I really liked this. I do think that the amount of tortillas needs to be cut by half, and next time I will only return half of them back to the skillet and save the second half to add in at the end so they stay crispy. I also only used enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan so that there wasnâ€™t as much to drain.

After frying the tortilla strips and removed from the pan, I sautÃ©ed my onion with a diced jalapeÃ±o and small tomato.  Everything else was the same.  Topped with Cotija cheese.

Awesome recipe!  Loved the tip to bake the corn tortillas. Also followed suggestion for 1-1 tortilla to egg ratio. Can't imagine 30. I used 12 eggs and 10 gorillas. I added a can of diced green chilies and 1/4 chopped onion  (as our family recipe includes these items.). I used quest fresco to keep it Mexican. Family just loved it!  Thank you!

I cut this recipe in half,, but it seemed to need a little  more moisture so I added some more red sauce and an extra egg.  I cooked the onion in the small amount of oil left in the pan after the tortillas were done and used Havarti cheese instead of jack for a creamy texture ... topped with chopped green onions .. used some taptio to add heat ,, I will make again.

I felt the proportions were off.  For me, there was way too many tortillas, too much oil, too much salt, no seasoning, and not enough cheese.  It tasted like I was eating salt flavored crunchy oil.  I modified the recipe to call for 1/2 the oil, 1/2 the tortillas, and 1/2 the salt, a cup of cheese and some Mexican spices.

Delicious! I made this almost exactly as the recipe says.  I prefer my chilaquiles crunchy so I heated the tomato sauce separately and added it to the rest just before I served it.  I would also recommend to add the onion once the tortillas are almost fully fried, otherwise the onion starts to burn. Overall, this recipe was great! Easy to make and delicious flavor.

Recipe as is just ok...........but..........
changed recipe to make it a 5 star for our family.

I used about 8 to 10 corn tortillas.  Used maybe 1/3 c. oil for frying the corn tortillas.  While c. torts. drained, added chopped red bell pepper, chopped onion, chopped jalapeno and cooked that in the leftover corn tortilla cooking oil, cooked 5 minutes,  then added the beaten eggs. Added some chili paste we make for mexi foods.  Then put in the c. torts., topped all with the plain tomato sauce (no water, we wanted some crunch in the tortillas) and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, stirred, and covered, cooked on very low 5 minutes. Added cheese and coitja cheese, then covered 5 minutes.

Next time will serve with refried beans as others suggested.

Used half of the tortillas and way less oil. Added fresh chopped jalapenos and more eggs. Came out very delicious.

BOMB! Never made chilaquiles before, my husband is half Mexican and grew up to his abuela making these, it was his favorite dish. She died about 4 years ago, no one in the family has had any that could compare to hers....until tonight when I made these. I used about 1 and a half cans el pato tomato sauce and 3/4 cup water. Also sprinkled about 1/4 tsp chicken bullion over the top after adding the sauce. For cheese I used queso fresco. I'm keeping this recipe and plan on it being a regular in my home.

Made this for me and my Sweety this morning.   I made a few changes.   I didn't use that many tortillas, I used Pepper Jack Cheese, and I used Pico De Gallo.   I understand that you are supposed to use "Hot Sauce" or "Enchilada Sauce" so the eggs are Super Moist.   However I wasn't in the mood for Super Moist Eggs, so the way I made them was Perfect for the way I was feeling today.   I will probably add the Picante Sauce next time, just to see what it is like, not to say there was anything wrong with them today, cause me and my sweety BOTH Loved Them.      Next time sweety wants a "Mexican Type Breakfast" I will Surely make these again.   The First time I had these was in a Traditonal Mexican Household and had to find a recipe for them so I could make them.   TY for Posting this.   Wonderful Recipe.

This recipe is the BOMB!!  I make it when we are on the lake or at tailgates and everyone raves about it and wants to take the leftovers home!  The only thing I do differently is I use Herdez salsa verde and definitely use queso fresco with some crema drizzled on top with maybe a little El Pato red tomato sauce drizzled too, but I don't always add that.  You can't go wrong!

Awesome recipe.  What is the hot Mexican tomato sauce used (brand name)?  I just used random salsa out of a glass jar.  By Herdez.

You must really try the fried tortillas!  If you don't want to use a deep fryer that will be fine.  I just pan fried mine in a lot of oil in small batches and set them out over  paper towels.  Dash of salt.  

Also you might try cheddar, which was all I usually keep on hand for all purpose cooking and it was of course mighty delicious.

Fantastic. I added two shredded chicken breasts, some garlic and used a can of enchilada sauce and a jar of Goya pico de gallo. I also just used some trader joes tortilla chips. They are thick and substantial. Topped with Mexi cheese blend and cojita. I think I will cook the eggs separately and add at the end so they don't break up.

We loved this. I about tripled the amount of cheese and used cheddar because that was what we had. We used store bought tortillas. The chef at the restaurant I work at made this with chopped up chicken and it was delicious. I was out of sour cream so it was really 4 1/2 stars but thats not the recipe's fault so I gave it 5. Also, I used non-spicy tomato sauce and it was still delicious.
