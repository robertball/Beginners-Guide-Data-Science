I made this as a last-minute dinner idea (I literally remembered at the last minute that I had nothing planned for dinner). I used red bell pepper instead of green, Angus beef hot dogs, and Campbells Chunky Roadhouse Chili. I made little bowls of chopped tomatoes, sliced green onions, shredded sharp cheddar and reduced fat sour cream to top the servings with. My family RAVED about this casserole, especially littlest who can be a little picky. My husband and oldest went back for seconds. This was fabulous--not only was it quick, it also used ingredients I had in my pantr/fridge which made it very cheap to make. This recipe's a keeper!

This was really good! Very cheap and easy. I put one package of cornbread mix on the bottom of the dish, layered the chili mixture and then topped with half a box cornbread mix. The dish really held together well. We would definitely make again, especially to use up hot dogs and veggies :)

Very easy to make, very flavorful and hearty :) Everyone loved it! I suggest using 2 boxes of cornbread mix for a firmer serving. Also i topped with sourcream and shredded cheese!

Making this for the second time tonight.  Family of 6 all loved it.  Used Nalley's Vegetarian Chili w/Beans and Hebrew National 97% Fat Free Hot Dogs to lighten up a bit.  Added a can of mild green chilis to the cornbread mix, no peppers or celery in the filling. Shredded Cheese, sour cream, a little mustard on the side.  Definitely comfort food!

I think two boxes of cornbread mix would have been much better (one on the bottom, one on top) but DO NOT try to make this ahead and reheat it later. Yeech.......

I had some cornbread mix to use up and this worked well. I used 1 pack of hot dogs, 2 cans of chili and the onion, green pepper and celery. Next time I would skip the celery, keep the green pepper and the onion, and add red bell pepper, jalape√±os and leftovers of my homemade chili.

This definitely fancies-up plain ole hot dogs and chili. I added an additional can of chili, because it seemed too dry, and glad I did; texture was perfect. And, I made my own cornbread batter, rather than using the box. Good way to sneak in a few veges without the kids realizing it! I also used a red pepper rather than green; it's what I had on hand and I prefer the flavor of red.

I made it and it tastes like a corn dog. It needs more cornbread flavor and I read the reviews AFTER I made it. Will add anther box off Jiffy and may cook it for a shorter peirod of time.

This was an easy recipe (great for week nights); family loved it, and I think it will still be good leftover, too. I attempted to double the recipe, and had a little trouble getting my cornbread  top to cook through (even with an extra 15-20 minutes, but used a smaller pan- sure, it would have been better in a 9x13). It was still delicious. Thanks for a new, not overly complicated, go-to recipe!

Did not make changes.  Tasted but I made it the day before eating and it seemed a little dry the next day.  I assume it was because the cornbread absorbed the liquid. I would eat it the same day it is made.

Made this last night for dinner following the directions exactly. It came out great. I'm not big on hot dogs,  I typically do not care for them. My husband however, loves them. So this was a nice compromise, and yes we will be making this again,  maybe using  ground beef next time just for fun.

It was so delicious!   Made it according to the recipe except skipped the veggies.  Wouldn't change a thing!  I'm amazed.  Best description is that it tastes like a yummy chili corndog.

This was better then we thought it would be.  The flavors worked really well together.  I made as written, only using a spicy version of the chili with beans.  We both enjoyed added mustard to the finished product.  It also reheated well for lunch the next day.  Served it with corn on the cob and fresh fruit.  I do the find the title of the recipe  offensive.

Delicious! The only thing I would change is the name. Terry, name change?? It is a cross between a casserole and cornbread. We liked it a lot and will make it again.
