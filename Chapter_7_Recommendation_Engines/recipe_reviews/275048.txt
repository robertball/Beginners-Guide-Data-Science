I made these, followed the instructions. They came out ok, no real taste and definitely not like a traditional beignet. These are more the constancy of a cake than an a fluffy pastry/donut. I will continue my search for a air fryer beignet recipe.

We liked them.  I'm not familiar with traditional beignets, so don't have a comparison.  They came out moist, kind of cakey inside, crunchy outside, medium sweet.  Reminded me of a mini muffin, but with a nice outside crunchiness.  I did increase the vanilla slightly, and I used a mini muffin pan. (Don't have an egg-bite pan)

Did not care for these at all. Too eggy, way too dense. More like a flavorless cake.

It tasted good but came out a lot more dense than a beignet. tasted like a madeleine.

Turned out very good! Remember to spray the silicon as they will stick otherwise. My Ninja Foodi needed a couple minutes less time on each of the AF times.

I like this recipe. Its very light and will adapt well to other flavors. I really like not having to use grease to fry them.

Somewhat flat in taste. Very light. Next time I will put a little lemon extract and I will add more batter to each cup. Quick and easy to make.

They have a good chance f being great.
