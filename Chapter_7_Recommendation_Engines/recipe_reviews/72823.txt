Very yummy recipe.  I now get requests for it...made a couple adjustments though...use mayonnaise and ranch dressing and add more than recipe calls for since it gets absorbed by the pasta.  Also- use farfelle pasta and also add peas.

I like this recipe.  More importantly, my husband LOVES this recipe.  It is terribly simple to make, which is a plus.  However, I have made a few changes as I have made this recipe again.  I thought the pasta soaked up too much of the dressing as it sat and it kindof lost it's ranch flavor.  I add more ranch as it sits until it is the consistency I like.  Also, I started using Bacon Ranch to up the ranch flavor.  Also, I use green onions instead of regular onions, and add about 2 cups of peas.

I brought this to a potluck and everyone loved it.  I think it tastes best with the packaged ranch dressing mix, adding buttermilk and mayo to it, rather than bottled ranch.  Also, next time I think I'd add sharp cheddar cheese to it.  Yum!

I make this pretty much the same, only I do half mayo, half sour cream and add a double batch of homemade dry ranch seasoning mix. I don't usually keep shell pasta on hand--elbow macaroni is usually the pasta I'll use. I like to use either red or green onions in this salad recipe. If you can, make this earlier in the day so it has time to set and really let the flavors work together. EDITED: I make this "lighter" now making the dressing from a mixture of nonfat greek yogurt, lowfat mayonnaise and reduced fat sour cream for the dressing, turkey bacon and whole wheat pasta. My family actually prefers the lower fat version!

Very good recipe! I added chopped celery and pre-chopped the bacon before frying it. Also, the Kraft Ranch with bacon dressing tastes great for this recipe!

I also used the baccon ranch dressing.  I added frozen peas, chopped celery, red onion and extra dressing. I used whole wheat pasta because its what I had on hand, and no one could tell.  Everyone loved it, and it is super easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved it!  We ate it for lunch several days after.  We used Rotini noodles instead to add some color.  (See picture)

I really liked this recipe. I have never made home-made pasta salad before. It was super easy. I really like italian dressing and my husband loves ranch.. so I did 1 cup ranch and 1/2 cup italian. It turned out wonderful. We ate it before refrigerating it and loved it. A few hours later we got it back out and it was pretty dry and not as good. We will add more dressing before eating it again. No biggie. LOVED IT!!

Great pasta salad!  I used green onion and along with some cherry tomatoes, I used a whole bag of thawed petite sweet peas.  I made my own ranch dressing using Hidden Valley Ranch packets, milk, and mayonaisse.  After it refrigerated, it was delicious - husband loved it!

I have made this recipe several times and am very happy with it.  Yes, I did add more dressing to equal out the amount of pasta, and instead of frying the pound of bacon, I just added a package of the real bacon bits.  This gave me more of the 'bacon' taste I was looking for.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great and easy salad to do. I generally don't like creamy salads, but I like this one. My husband won't eat onions, I leave them out. He's a big Ranch fan, with almost everything. He loves this ! He's 3rd Infantry so maybe its an Army thing !

OK, first of all, for those people who reviewed this recipe as bland, I think you may need your tastebuds checked by a doctor.  Armywife99 is my sister, and she is literally famous around here for this salad...everyone requests it at cookouts, picnics, etc.  This is the ONLY pasta salad I make, my kids and hubby adore it.  It does get better the longer it sits in the fridge, and do yourself a favor...make it exactly as the recipe calls for, don't add a bunch of stuff like lettuce or cukes.  I occasionally add shredded monterey jack cheese, and it is wonderful.  It doesn't get any simpler or more delicious than this recipe.  I dare you to eat just one spoonful...it is impossible!

I love salads and the bacon makes it especially tasty.  This is an easy-to-make recipe and I like "easy". I will be making it again.

BEST PASTA SALAD I HAVE MADE SO FAR! Thank you people for the helpful comments, I read through them and followed suggestions. Here's what I did: cooked 13oz shell pasta, 1 pkg bacon, and 1/2 pkg frozen peas. Afterward I cut up 2 tomatoes and let them warm in the bacon grease, and added salt/pepper. Cooled pasta, and added 1/2 c milk to it.  Added bacon ranch dressing mixed with some mayo, 3 chopped green onions, the peas, the tomatoes, the bacon, about 1.5c shredded cheddar, fresh chopped spinach (I chopped maybe 30 leaves, some more wouldn't have hurt), and a little bit of shredded chicken that I had leftover. In the words of the miz AWEEESOMEEEE *update 6/14/12 I made a "lite" version of this with shell pasta, turkey bacon, light cheese, lite ranch/mayo, tomato, spinach, peas. Couldn't taste the difference at all it was delish :D

One trick I learned about pasta salads after they have"dried" out is to add a little water and mix in. It helps to revive it without adding more dressing and calories.

Everyone asks for the recipe!
A few thoughts... Undercook the pasta so it is a bit firmer than al dente. Cherry tomatoes sliced in half don't get soggy and work great... Hidden Vly Ranch Buttermilk Recipe is great in this recipe. The flavors meld beautifully when made the night before serving. Also, I cook the bacon in the oven (at 350)on a foil-lined cookie sheet. It's much cleaner and faster than frying in a pan (and comes out straight too)! Lastly, The last time I made this dish, I forgot to buy an onion. I threw in deseeded coursely chopped cucumbers instead. It was a HUGE hit with my friends (and their kids).

Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!

Yummy!  I did have to make a few changes based on previous reviews ... I used 1.5 cups bacon ranch dressing and 1/2 cup creamy garlic Italian (the pasta soaks up a lot of the dressing).  I also added peas and used red onion instead of regular chopped onions.  I added cheddar cheese crumbles and used drained fire roasted diced tomatoes.  This is a keeper in my house!  Can't wait to eat leftovers.

From the ingredients, I thought I would have loved this but I really didn't care for it at all. Neither did anyone at the family reunion.  Wont be making this again.

I think that when I rate this as 5 stars, I'm rating the concept more than the actual recipe. Conceptually, this is awesome!

Here are the changes I made to end up with my final product.

1. Instead of 1.5 cups of ranch-style dressing, I used two cups. 

2. I used a bundle of green onions instead of a small onion. 

I combined cooled, cooked pasta, chopped tomatoes with seeds removed, chopped green onions and 1.5 cups of the ranch dressing the night before. And about an two hours before the party, I fried up already chopped bacon, let it cool and combined it with the pasta along with 0.5 cups of ranch dressing. 

Everyone loved it!!!

This was a nice change to the standard summer picnic salads.  All of my favorites in one bowl.  The best part is, it last a few days, so it can be made ahead of time.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Use pre-cooked bacon (oscar mayer real bacon bits)! Also, added chopped green onion instead of regular onion. It adds a beautiful green where the lettuce usually does in a BLT. Shredded cheddar or colby jack cheese is wonderful added, too.

This is a wonderful recipe that I have made at least 20 times since discovering the recipe a few years ago.  It is a huge hit for picnics, BBQs, office parties, holiday meals, etc.  My family loves this!  Matter of fact, I've never met anyone who didn't like this recipe - get requests for the recipe all the time.  My family does not, however, care for bottled light ranch dressing in this recipe, so I make up my own ranch from the little pouch.  I also use a 12 oz. pkg. of bacon rather than 16 oz. - it's still plenty, and saves money.   I sometimes add in some finely chopped bell pepper and celery if I have it, and have used green or red onions in place of yellow onions - just use what I have on hand.

This was a hit. I added some peas and diced cheddar cheese as a personal preference. I also taste tested i before I took it to the shower I was throwing and added some mayo to the mix before serving as it was a little dry after sitting and seemed to need a little more umph then the ranch provided. Would def make again.

Super easy, and tasted awesome.  Got great reviews, at a couple of events.  AS usual a change or two.  First off, used Hormel Bacon Bits (I get a huge bag from Costco--saves soo much time), used red onion, and the first time I made this, I didn't realize that I was almost out of Ranch dressing, so I mixed what I had with a cup of buttermilk, and the next day added more dressing.  Still awesome.  My hubby keeps asking for it.

UPDATE!!

I am still making his on a regular basis, but make a few changes every now and then.  I use Kraft 3 cheese dressing, and is awesome, and I will use the Hidden Valley Ranch dressing!  Also, I will alternate between using scallions or red onions! This is still always amazing and gets awesome reviews!!

Thanks so much for this delightful recipe.  It is easy to make,and a refreshing change from other pasta salads. And best of all the family loved it! Also thanks, reviewer for the tip to just add a little water if it dries out in the fridge, that works nicely. Also, I didn't change a thing.

I used the bacon ranch dressing that someone suggested, doubled the tomatoes, and added fresh basil. I think reducing the amount of pasta by half and adding shredded lettuce would be great next time.

I made this for a potluck at work and it was one of the first things that was gone. I've made this twice now in 3 days it's soooo good! I used grape tomatoes sliced in half and made it once using vidalia onion and once using green, I like it better with the green. Thanks so much for the recipe:)

Fabulous Recipe !!!  When I make a new recipe I follow it exactly as written. If I like it, I make it again with a few of my own changes.  Sometimes it's better sometimes not.  I liked this salad both original and with a few changes.  I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes ( in our house as long as it is spicy it's edible ) a little celery salt some black pepper and about a half of teaspoon of apple cider vinegar just for a tiny bit of tang.  Oh, and of course the peas like many others did, just for some color and more nutrition.  I loved using the shells, but the colored routini would look much nicer.  Overall...I will be making this again and again. It was very easy to make even having to cook the bacon.  I made the bacon VERY crispy ( on top of the stove ) after it cooled I just put it into a baggy and crushed it with a meat mallet.  It made perfect bacon crumbs.  I added the bacon right away so the flavor would meld into the salad while it sat in the fridge.  You must try this recipe if you like pasta salad !!!

***** I enjoyed this recipe, but did change it a bit. It was hard not to want to put italian seasonings like the traditional pasta salad..but I kept to the recipe on the sauce part. I did add small cubes of : mozzarella and cheddar cheese and cucumber. I also added green onions and red onions, and peas. I preferred the pasta shells that had all different sorts of colored shapes which included seashells in it. It added variety and color to this tastey salad. I also used the packet hidden valley ranch mix and prepared it instead of using the bottle. I ended up using all the prepared mix instead of the 1-1/2 cups the recipe calls for. This was a very good variation from the traditional pasta salad and I will make it again.

This is a great basic recipe. I gave it 5 stars for that alone. I've never thought it was fair when people rate something low and then change the entire recipe. But here's what I did. I used blue cheese dressing and crumbled blue cheese instead of the traditional Ranch dressing. It was fabulous and I've been asked to make this again.

Very easy and simple to make. Followed this recipe exactly. Every time I make this it's always gone. Tip- Taste better when it is cold for several hours before serving.

Loved it!   Great flavor and salad stayed nice and creamy even after refrigeration.  I add frozen peas just to give it a little extra something and used real bacon bits instead of frying up my own bacon and it tasted just fine.  Definitely a keeper that I will make again!

I took the advice of others and mixed mayo with dry ranch, then added more ranch just before serving.  Added peas, and substitutes the onions with green onions.  The bowl was practically licked clean!

I just made this pasta.  Not sure why it is called BLT, as I don't have any L, but it is still really quick and easy.  I did make modifications.  They were as follows:  

Instead of fresh cooked bacon, I used a package of real bacon pieces.
Instead of a small onion, I used a bunch of green onions.
Instead of prepared ranch dressing, I used ranch dressing II by Dawnia on this site (replacing sour cream with buttermilk).

I know it is annoying when people do things different than the recipe, but I much prefer homemade ranch over store purchased, I didn't have bacon and like green onions over other kinds.  My son had a ball "helping" me cook this and only took a few minutes to throw together (even making the ranch).

Nice recipe base - I made it my own based on what I had on hand... using halved grape tomatoes, orzo, scallions... adding some light sour cream and a bit of mayo in with the dressing...and dill, and garlic powder (good quality...makes all the difference). I also just stirred the bacon in. And I happened to have a little chicken left over from a rotisserie chicken, so I tossed that in. Like any pasta salad, flavors do come together a bit more over time... but it also soaks up the dressing. Since it ended up just being me and my BF eating it, I just left it as is. Flavors were great :) mmm...bacon!

EXCELLENT!  Everyone loved this salad!  I used green onions and added avocado and an extra pound of bacon :)  I would also reccomend using the ranch mix insteard of pre-made dressing.  You can not miss with this recipe! ROCK ON!

This is a very tasty dish. I made a few modifications. Instead of onion I used about 3/4 cup green onion. I added what I thought should be used directly to the pasta. I then seasoned to taste with Morton's Season Blend. This added a delightdul flavor to the dish. I used Regular Ranch dressing and extra wide egg noodles. The family loved it!

Very yummy! My husband loved it. It would also be great for a potluck or anything of the sort! I will refrain to adding the bacon to it until its ready to be served and the longer it chills the more flavor it has! I also added extra ranch so it was nice and creamy! Very fast and easy to make!

I have made this now 3 times, the last time I used Chunky Blue Cheese dressing as requested by my co-workers, we loved it!  Will add extra Blue Cheese crumbles next time.  Thanks for this great recipe, many ways to change it up to make it fresh each time.

Very easy and yummy recipe. Great one to bring to a BBQ. I used whole wheat pasta, green onion and added some diced chedder cheese. I reserved some of the dressing and tossed it with the salad about 30 minutes before serving because I figured if I added it all in at once, the pasta would absorb all the dressing. Glad I did it this way, it turned out nice and creamy.

For the "L" ingredient I used 8 ozs of torn fresh baby spinach. It makes a colorful presentation. Quick & easy - this is a keeper!

Not bad at all! I just missed the L in BLT and added some arugula. I also added some parmesan but i wouldn't advise it, flavours become too conflicting.

I think that this pasta was excellent! Its way better then the normal pasta salad. I think it could do with out the onions, and my family and I just put bacon bits on top. We felt no need to cook bacon. Yet it was still good!!!

Made this to try something new from my usual mac salad. I thought it would be delish, but I just didn't like the flavors. My family felt the same way.

I was going to make 1/2 recipe but after cooking 1/2 the pasta and bacon I decided to go for the whole thing.  I read many suggestions and substituted 3 green onions, bought grape tomatoes, some finely grated sharp cheddar cheese, and a package of baby spinach.  Also added 1/2 c. mayo.  Refrigerated it overnight. Added spinach to mixture and topped with bacon right before serving. Didn't need any extra Ranch dressing. This salad is big! It filled a 4 qt. glass bowl. It was all gone except for a portion that my husband can eat for two separate lunches, and he doesn't eat a big lunch.  By far the hardest thing to do was to cook the lb. of bacon until it was really crispy and to cut that bacon up into small pieces.  I seldom have a use for salads such as this, but if I did, I would certainly make it again.

This is one of the salads I make that I get a lot of request for. It is very good. As it is written it serves a lot more than 10, more like 20 people. I use bowtie pasta, 3/4 cup bacon ranch drsg and 3/4 cup mayo instead of all ranch. I also used green onions instead of regular onions. Always a hit!

I thought this recipe was okay, but nothing special. I used some fresh chives, as well as onions, tomatoes, bacon and the Hidden Valley ranch packet. While I thought it was okay, I just didn't think it was good enough to bother making again. And that point was proved when I took it to a cook out and hardly anyone touch it.

This is a delicious salad that is easy yet impressive! The only problem I even have with the recipe is the name--it's not a BLT! So, I'd say having that minor of a "gripe" means this is a dish you need to try! By the way--I added a handful of frozen peas when I was making it and I think it made the dish even better!

Made this yesterday - YUMM! I did add frozen peas a little bit of fresh basil since I have a ton in my garden. Also about 1/2 cup of sour cream. I didn't have shells on hand so I used the mini wagon wheels and everything turned out great! Even my picky 13 yo. loved it - but picked out the tomatoes! Oh well....

I made this as written except used regular Ranch as that is what I had and grape tomatoes.  You can do a lot with this recipe or keep it as is.  I like the idea of adding some lettuce and peas. The recipe makes alot & I thought I would give that a try with the left overs. It will stay in my recipe box.thx

Very easy to make...my husband loved this! I added peas, more ranch and used real bacon bits instead of crumbling bacon, which made it even easier. Add salt and pepper and refrigerate overnight.

Made this on a whim a few years ago, but put nothing in it than what is in a BLT (bacon, iceberg lettuce, tomato and mayo) and use Geminelli pasta.

SO good and so easy!  Here are my little changes: I used half ranch half mayo  and add more than it says too because yes  it does soak up a lot!  Also I added peas and cheese.  I think I've already made this recipe 4 times!  Everyone LOVES it!

I did make a few adjustments just because of personal preference.  1. I added peas 2. I only used a small amount of onion.  3. I only had regular ranch so I added a few tablespoons of Mayo.  I made this for dinner and didn't have time to let it set for an hour and it still turned out great!  Can't wait to try it tomorrow!

I made this for a picnic last weekend. I added a couple of avacados for extra flavor. I think that if I make this again, I might add a little grated cheese, and maybe a dash of garlic powder.

Very yummy and easy to make. I cut the salad dressing in half and added a little bit of shredded cheese. Also used two bunches of green onions instead and added an extra tomatoe. Great recipe, thanks.....

I was seriously shocked on how AWESOME this salad is, was!!! I made it for a BBQ we were invited to and it was the ONLY salad that was eaten completely! I too used the soft bacon bits (generic form) because I was to lazy to cook it up on my own, I also used regular ranch not the lite.. Ya Ya more calories but it was WAY WAY GOOD!!!! This is a KEEPER!!!

I thought this recipe was great.  As others have, I added a few extras of my own.  I used cucumber, shredded sharp cheddar cheese and peas.  I also used Hidden Valley bacon ranch dressing.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks!!!

Very easy and quick pasta salad to make. I used Bacon Ranch salad dressing and used scallions instead of onions. I did have to add more ranch dressing after it sat in the fridge as the pasta soaked up alot of the dressing. This recipe makes alot, perfect for a potluck or picnic.

This recipe was so easy and so flavorful, even though I left out the onion. This will definitely be made again.

I really enjoy this easy to make pasta salad.  I thought that the ranch would be a little to blan for me so I added about a tbls of Hidden Valley Fiesta Party dip and it added a great flavor!

When my husband, who dislikes most cold side salads, declared 5 stars after only a couple of bites, I knew I had a winner on my hands.  Very easy to prepare.  I was surprised to find bacon ranch in my fridge, so that's what I used.  I halved the recipe, and I know there were more than 5 servings there.

Per recipe- this was very BLAND- i had to do a lot of spiceing up. I also used the bacon ranch dressing, added some mayo, and color bell peppers. Nothing special.Use small shells,with larger shells, you need more dressing.

This recipe doesn't call for lettuce, but I added about a cup or so of shredded lettuce to this salad. I also used the dry package, Hidden Vally Ranch mixed with mayo, sour cream and milk and some black pepper. Pretty tasty!

This was good but the recipe calls for 2 tomatoes & I used 7 roma tomatoes. An entire onion was waay too much, I used less than 1/2 but I probably wont put any next time I make this, it tasted too much of onion. I made some ranch dip mix & used about 1 1/2 cups. The crumbling the bacon was a pain & I might use precooked bacon bits next time. I did the crumbling over each serving, the problem with that is everyone wants to eat the bacon, without the salad. I tried mixing some in a single serving & stuck it in the fridge over night, I dont see why the recipe doesn't just call for the bacon to be mixed in it. I also added cabbage, but I really want to try this with cucumbers & olive, no cabbage.

It didn't say, so I used red onion. Just personal preference. Put in one whole bottle(16 oz) of Original Ranch dressing. I did add celery just because I had some to use up & other reviewers had said they liked it. AWESOME!!!

I made this pasta salad for the first time today. My husband and i really liked it but I'm only rating it a four start because I modified it to our liking, and didn't follow the recipe as written. Since it was just the two of us, I made two cups of pasta. I added 6 slices of cooked bacon, crumbled, 1 tomato, 1/4 of a cucumber, some green pepper. I also added 3/4 cup Light Peppercorn Ranch Salad Dressing. The pasta salad had so much flavor. We have enough leftovers for tomorrow night.

I made this for a summer cookout last year and everyone loved it. Everyone raved, and went back for seconds and thirds! I used green onion instead of regular onion, and bacon ranch dressing. I added some fresh spinach and extra tomato. Delicious!

This is addicting! I make my own ranch and use that, sometimes add in a few extra vegetables, like red peppers or celery if i have some that I need to use up. I always add peas to this and its just a hit with those of all ages!

The salad was good, but next time I would wait to add the bacon until serving.  I made this in advance for a camping trip and the bacon was soggy by the time we ate it.  Next time I'd keep the bacon seperate and add it before serving.

I suggest making this salad the night before for best flavor. The other modification I like to make is I use Hidden Vally Ranch Bacon Ranch dressing (hard to find). It will give you a more bacon taste.

 I think thick cut Peppered Bacon taste awesome on this salad & I add about 3/4lb to the top of the salad (it will not get soggy/soft).

 Fresh green onions & fresh chives give this salad a great fresh from the garden taste too! My sister has even added a cup of finely chopped celery to this salad to give it a extra crunch, yummy!

I like to cut up about 2-3 large tomatoes to mix into the salad and then I will add a few to the top for a fresh look.

For a baby shower I served this salad on a large romaine leaf & all the girls thought I worked so hard. It looked great & tasted awesome.

Wonderful! I made as stated except used bacon ranch as others had. The next day, it was still fine--I didn't have to add more. I used thick-cut bacon. I could find only "small" and "large" and "jumbo" shells, so I got the small, which worked ok. I did add peas as others, mostly b/c the dish needed more color--which is the same reason I added a touch of shredded medium cheddar. I prepared the bacon by baking (400 degrees, put bacon on baking sheet in cold oven, turn on the oven and from that point on, leave it in 17-20 mins., and it's perfect--but line sheet w/foil). I'll make this again and highly recommend it. You might add shrimp or salmon or tuna to this to change it up a bit.

I made my own ranch dressing using sour cream, mayo, dill, parsley, garlic powder, onion salt and black pepper. This salad is AWESOME. Throwing it together was no time at all the longest time involved was frying up the diced bacon, which I mixed right into the salad. This is a keeper! But where does the L come into it I wonder? LOVE it!

Excellent recipe. I have made this many timestp take to school & church functions as well as my work lunch. I used Rotini multi colored pasta, 1/2 Bacon Ranch & 1/2 Ranch Dressing, green onion including green stems, tomato basil dressing in place of tomatoes (cut back on Ranch dressing), added grilled chicken, grated cheese, frozen peas, hard boiled eggs, & cashews. Am considering adding water chestnuts next time. This salad is a big hit not only with women, but with men & children @ church meals.

This recipe is so easy and so tasty.  I add chopped celery leaves as the "lettuce" part.  I was surprised that very few people acknowledged the missing L in the BLT.  I also use green onions instead of white for a more mild flavor and stirred the bacon (minus a little for sprinkling on top) with the other ingredients.  Add more Ranch after the salad has chilled, as most of it does get soaked into the pasta.

I thought this was very good even though tons of calories if you use the regular dressing which I did.  :) The only thing I did different was mixed the bacon with everything else instead of adding it right before serving.

This was so much  better than I expected. I made it as directed without adding or changing ingredients. I did toss my pasta in olive oil to coat it when it was done cooking. I doubled this and had it with Christmas dinner, using green onions as called for, and dried dressing packets made with buttermilk. The flavor of the green onions is part of what made this special for me. My husband, who does not like pasta salad, fell in love with this. I thought the flavor combinations were exceptional. More dressing was definitely needed before serving to moisten it up. Will add this to my regular recipe rotation since my husband is asking to have it again and again.

This is delicious, easy and fast. It is great as it, but I used macaroni shells, because it was what I had on hand. Still turned out great and I served it on a bed of lettuce. This is a keeper. My boyfriend and I ate it up.

Well. This was easy and fast. I used elbow macaroni as I didn't have shells, and it seemed like a good alternative. I don't recommend letting it sit for more than an hour or two before eating. The pasta sucks up the dressing really quickly. By the next morning, it was just sort of dry and oily, with no ranch flavor left. I cut waaay back on the onion (family preference), and used grape tomatoes. I garnished with fresh chives to amp up the color. It was pretty okay if eaten soon after making, but I won't be eating the leftovers. The jury is out on whether I'm making this again. I think I will try it with a different dressing (used Kraft) as that may have been the culprit. Thanks. :)

Mmmm...this is so easy and so tasty.  It's worth the extra 5 minutes and few dollars to make the buttermilk ranch from Hidden Valley (buttermilk + mayo). I cook my bacon in the oven @ 450 for about 15 minutes and cleanup is a breeze!  I also like to sub out green onions for regular and add in some celery for more crunch.  I literally crave this salad.  Thank you so much for sharing it!

Yummy! and I don't like BLT sandwiches!  I used Farfelle pasta, original Ranch, cherry tomatoes cut in 1/2 lengthwise, (the smaller tomatoes I left whole), onion, and will add fresh pieces of Romaine and bacon right before serving.  This was VERY simple to make.  I am wondering what a little bit of shredded cheddar would do to this? (I love cheese!)  Almost added green peppers, etc. but changed my mind.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Like everyone else, I loved this recipe.  One suggestion:  if you make the Ranch dressing from the dry package (I used Hidden Valley Ranch mixed with fat-free buttermilk and canola oil mayonnaise) it is the perfect amount of dressing for the amount of pasta.  It also tastes MUCH better than bottled Ranch dressing. I also used real bacon bits (because I had them and also because I was lazy) and it tasted great!

This is better than I expected, but what the heck, it has bacon, I should have known. Do your bacon in the oven, and you will save yourself a big mess. Also, I added some cucumber.  I'm telling you, this one is hard to stay out of.

I thought this was pretty good.  I used half of the bacon flavor Hidden Valley and half of the Hidden Valley Ranch Low Fat Sour Cream dressing-the flavor was very good.  I used cherry tomatoes (cut them up), scallions, red onions, colby cheddar cheese and fresh crumbled bacon (added that in just before serving.  The salad was color and I used a funky swirl type of pasta which I got lots compliments on.  Several people including my hubby loved the salad and complimented!!  I will make again....be sure to make the day before so the flavors will blend....

Great for BBQ -- i'm going to make it this weekend for Memorial Day.  Definitely allow it to sit overnight.  I had to make it and eat it the same day - poor timing on my part. The next day and the day after that ... it was much better.  I used some of the suggestions by other posters  - used green onions(b/c i had them), added shredded cheese(i'm from WI and add cheese to everything if i can), peas, a dash of garlic and onion salt.  I used fresh bacon b/c i had it.  ALL FABULOUS!! and will make again!!  Thanks!!

I made this salad for my mom's 70th birthday party and potluck dinner.  It went over well.  It's a great salad because of its unique combination of simplicity and great flavor.  It's a refreshing salad with good punch.  Don't leave out the onion.  It's a necessary element.

Way too bland for me.  I added probably about a tablespoon of Paprika before I was close to satisfied.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough ranch on hand, so it's a little dry, but it still tastes alright.  I also subbed turkey bacon for pork bacon, which cut back on some fat and it tastes just fine.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed it in some tortillas as wraps, but I don't think it does well by itself.  I won't be making it again unless my boyfriend asks me to.  If I do, maybe I'll try using a different dressing, with some more flavor to it.

i added peas for some more color, and used bowties instead of seashells.. still came out great!! the dressing itself was a little bland for me so i added fresh ground pepper with the bacon on top. a delicious and easy pasta salad!

This is an easy pasta salad recipe that goes great at any cookout.   I substituted green onion to add a little color to the salad.   I also cut grape tomotoes in half instead of using regular ones to make the prep time faster.   This is delicious!!

this is so good, you do have to add more ranch dressing after its been in the fridge for a while.  I took the advice of another user and used bacon ranch dressing. all I can say is WOW!

This is a very good recipe.  I made some changes to it.  I used the packaged italian dressing and added some cucumbers.  I also used mayo instead of the ranch dressing.  It is so good.

I don't understand why we didn't LOVE this recipe. We LOVE everything in it! I followed instructions, Hidden Valley Ranch dressing, fresh cooked bacon, even added cheese but it just didn't have extra zing we love. I am thinking that making the Hidden Valley Fresh Ranch from the packets with buttermilk would probably give this extra flavor.

Not a fan.  Even took some of the suggestions from other cooks and really just didn't do it for me.  I hated that I wasted bacon in it!!  LOL  Maybe just not my kind of recipe.

Made this many, many times for different crowds:  family, older veterans I help at a meeting with, kids, co-workers pot lucks. Everyone loved it and it is a staple in my recipe book too!  Took many different suggestions that I saw on here and allgood.  My faves:  using bacon ranch dressing, adding bacon bits and green onions. Also, just did it using a low-cal version my new personal trainer appproved of, and no one at the last party knew!  Used the new yogurt ranch dressing bottles you find in the produce department, used low-salt turkey bacon and whole wheat pasta shells.  Tomatoes, green onions and pepper were added. Also, for all those looking foer the "L" in BLT....I always shred up lettuce and add it at the last minute.  (Don't do it early, as with all the bacon , or it will get too soggy).  I put bacon bits and some of regular bacon in when I put it all together before I put it in fridge...the pasta soaks up the dressing and the bacon flavor gets in it too.  Then before I serve or bring it to a party, I add more dressing or water and the rest of bacon and shredded lettuce and it is great!   Enjoy....

I made this for my daughter's baseball team picnic. It was a hit! The only thing I changed was adding green onions instead of a regular one, just for color. I wanted to try using the packets of Hidden Valley Ranch mix, like other users, but didn't have the mayo I needed. Next time, I might try it, but honestly it tasted amazing the way it was written! Thanks for sharing!

This dish is fast to make--and good enough to go fast, impressing MY toughest food critics ( the wife and kids ), along the way. Made as directed, you'll quickly pick up on the Southwest flair of taste that can easily compel you to "jazz" things up w/ creative personal touches.  I like to use Rotini pasta--and add thin slices of nicely marinated  grilled chicken with this salad; sends my family over the top when I do this.

Great feedback from this one....everyone enjoyed. I used tri-color mini radditore pasta, very crispy crumbled bacon, red onion, cherry tomatoes sliced, black olives, and shredded cheddar cheese. Great pot luck side dish. Thanks.

Well, this is a BLT salad so I was a little surprised that the recipe doesn't call for any lettuce.  I always put some in along with cucumbers.  I prefer straight up Miracle Whip for the dressing though.  This is my go to pasta salad recipe!

Good salad, much better next day, i would prefer little more ranch, as it does get kinda dry. I added bag of frozen peas to it just because.  Will make again, doesnt get 5 stars from me, but definately a strong 4 star + rating.

A wonderful salad everyone loved it and kept eating more. I used 1/2 blue cheese and 1/2 mayo for the dressing and added chopped dill pickles.  Next time I am thinking of adding water chestnuts.

Very simple, very nice!!! I'm teaching daughter to cook during summer break, so today we made this. We all loved it! 5 stars as written, but we both wanted to amp the flavor up a bit...we added a drizzle of lemon, red wine vinegar, a sprinkle of black pepper and red pepper flake. Next time we are going to add chopped red pepper and use a purple onion. Thanks for this...it will go into daughters recipe folder as a keeper!

Rating this recipe probably isn't fair, because I combined it with another recipe on the Food Network. But I don't like Mayonnaise, so this recipe gave me the idea for ranch. What is different is that I used green onions instead of regular onions, 1 garlic clove minced and 1 tbsp fresh thyme. You cook the tomatoes, garlic and thyme in the bacon fat- just warming the ingredients and then add to the pasta, season with salt and pepper and add the ranch dressing. YUM YUM. I also omitted the milk from the Food Network recipe, no need with the ranch. http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/blt-pasta-salad-recipe/index.html

Great recipe that can be very versatile! I added 2 chicken breasts, cooked and chopped, used green onions and halved grape tomatoes. Also used homemade ranch using buttermilk and mayo with the mix. Added some freshly ground pepper as well. This recipe is great on its own or as a base for whatever else you want to create with it. Thanks for sharing!

YUM! I am giving 4 stars because I did change it up a little bit. I used red onion and Peppercorn ranch dressing, added some peas for more color and added some shredded chicken breast. Took this on a camping trip and everyone loved it, cool and refreshing but filling at the same time!

I love pasta, I love ranch and I love BLT's.  I wanted to LOVE this recipe too, but it just didn't come through.  It was bland, even when mixed fresh.  I cooled the pasta on a cookie sheet and lightly drizzled/tossed with olive oil to prevent the dressing from absorbing. Chilled for 3 hours and by then all the dressing was absorbed anyway.  The bacon was excellent & I used whole grape tomatoes which were good.  Just the pasta part was bland.  Not necesarily a bad recipe, but I'll stick to vinaigrette dressings from now on.

I made this in a hurry late last night for a luncheon at work today.  I added green peas and grated cheese.  The recipe is super easy and it was a great hit!  I used the Bacon Ranch dressing and it didn't have an overwhelming twang of ranch that some people don't like.

This was yummy!  Great recipe to use up those ripe tomatoes from your garden.  Like a dummy, I forgot to add the onion, but it still tasted great.  We had leftovers and after the 2nd day, it tasted even better.

This was just so-so.  We are a household that loves pasta salad, ranch and bacon so I thought this would be a huge hit.  It was just lacking something.  Probably won't make again.

I did as the recipe called for and added some cheese and this was very bland. Maybe if it marinated overnight (instead of 6 hours) it could've been better. Who knows. Not a fan of this at all.

This is a new family favorite - we used home made ranch from this site. This is a light and refreshing salad - so much flavor! Only use good quality bacon - I was cheap with a batch and it ruined it due to little chunks of fat in some bites.

Yummy combination of flavors. I used halved grape tomatos and green onions. Used a bit more ranch and added some dill weed and celery seed to pump up the flavor. Everyone enjoyed it at our bbq!

The bacon made it really salty and I ended up adding a lot of extra dressing because it got dry - but it went over very well at the church luncheon and I've had requests for it again. Thank you very much.

After taking all the suggestions by other reviewers, this turned out great.  To recap, I used green onions, cherry tomatoes, made the bacon in the oven, used colored rotini pasta, and bacon-ranch dressing.  Everybody loved it, even people who don't normally like pasta salad.

Made it for the first time this Memorial day weekend and it was a big hit. I tweaked the recipe using 1.5lbs bacon & 3 tomatoes, then used 3/4c. ranch & 3/4c. bacon ranch dressing. Will definitely make again, thanks!

This was very good.  I made it for company.  I did a few things differently than the recipe states.  I added a handful of sharp cheddar, I used Kraft ranch with bacon dressing, and I used minced onion.  Next time, I will use a real onion, I think this salad needed that.

This recipe got rave reviews and I was asked for the recipe many times.  It was really tasty.  I used mini wagon wheel pasta, chopped the bacon into pieces before frying, used regular Ranch dressing and I used a red onion.  I also added about I cup of shredded cheddar cheese and precut shredded lettuce.  This is a keeper. As a time saver, I cooked the pasta the night before and mixed with a little olive oil to prevent sticking.  The next morning I just added all the remaining ingredients except for the lettuce.  I left that to a person's descretion.

This was incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I served this at my daughters 1st birthday party and everyone said how great it was as they came for seconds.  Made the dish just as the recipe states except I used cherry tomatoes cut in half...give it a try- you won't be sorry.

Excellent! I used bow-ties, and it worked out great. Running pasta under cold water immediately after soaking prevents too much excess water from being soaked. You can always mix in the dressing right before serving. Drizzle a little oil over pasta to keep them from sticking if you are doing so.

This recipe is fantastic!  We took a big bowl to a cookout and couldn't keep up with recipe requests!  The only thing that I did differently was add a bit more bacon and about 2 cups of cooked peas.  We will be making this again soon!

Nice to have a pasta salad that isn't made with the traditional italian dressing.  I made this recipe exactly as suggested.  It was moist and flavorful and ready in a flash.  I tossed in 1/2 a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and added scallions to top of pasta right before servings.  Everyone of us had second helpings.  Will be making this again for sure.

Our family thought this was really good and it is definitely easy to make - which was nice for me as I needed something in a hurry.  I used the Hidden Valley Ranch packet, mayo (kraft mayo with olive oil - half the fat) + milk like some others and liked the flavor, texture, consistency etc, but had to use the food processor to get those ingredients to mix well. This preparaton makes 2 cups of dressing instead of the 1 1/2 called for in the recipe which I thought helped maintain the moistness and flavor a litle better.  Anyways also subbed 3/4 of the bacon for turkey bacon cooking both varieties together.  It helped cut the fat and the turkey bacon picked up some of the regular bacon flavor which I thought was a good compromise between fat and flavor.  Like many others added peas, cheese and subbed green onions for the regular.  Will definitely make again.

Even after sitting overnight I think there was too much ranch.  I would reccomend cutting it back initially and adding more later if necessary.  I also added a green pepper.

My boyfriend loved this because he likes almost anything with bacon. But I felt like it needed more salad dressing for more flavour, it could be because I might've added more pasta than what the recipe mentioned. But overall, the mixture of the different ingredients made this very tasty; I love this myself.

Everyone loves this. I have been making it for any family get-together since summer, always doubling the recipe, and never have any left over. It is super easy, and the only change I make is to add some cooked frozen peas and use tri-color salad rotini to add color.

Excellent!  I made some changes.  I added avocado, cubed pepperjack cheese, and cilantro.  Definitely something I will make again!

I thought this salad was good, but not spectacular.  However...my husband and a few friends loved it and have requested it all summer.  I have taken it to several get-togethers and it is always well-received.

Enjoyed this recipe; changed the dressing with 1:4 ratio of mayonnaise so the Ranch dressing wouldn't overpower the salad.

It was the first time I had ever made any kind of pasta salad, being that I didn't like any salad dressings.  I made it for a prayer meeting and it was a hit, everyone loved it. I must say I loved it myself I used the bacon ranch dressing, I also added peas and sharp cheddar cheese like another member did.  I will be making it again. :)

I left out the onion, used Hidden Valley Ranch, and make sure to add the bacon just before serving, as it gets rubbery after a day or so of soaking in the dressing.  Very good.

Great recipe.  I tried it the first time with directions as listed, the second time I added packaged Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing and it really gave it a lot of zing.  It's great both ways!  Thanks so much for a perfect way to use summer tomatoes!  I never have any left over.

Although this salad was extremely easy, I didn't care for it.  I thought it was very bland (even after trying to doctor it up with some spices.)  I think the Light Ranch dressing has a funny taste to begin with, and that could be why I didn't care for this.

At first I did not like this salad.  But it actually tasted better the second day.  Not a bad salad and everyone at the picnic ate it up.  Followed recipe to the tee.

This was a crowd pleaser and I really enjoyed it as well, though I also added a items too since it was missing the "L" in BLT.  I ADDED green leaf lettuce, basil and black pepper.  I like another users idea of adding peas too and plan to do that the next time I make it.

I have to hand it to you armywife 99, I took this dish to a potluck today and the bowl looked like it was licked clean!  I made several copies of the recipe and people were asking for more copies.  I am going to take this dish to our Father's Day picnic this weekend.  I made the night before and the flavors were perfect!  Thank You for a great dish.

Very good and easy!! Everyone hates tomatoes but me so substituted peas in the salad. I used mayo, milk and a package of hidden valley ranch whipped together. Very tasty and easy, will make again!

Delicious! A hit! I've made it with the ranch dressing as directed, and when I didn't have the dressing, with mayo and seasonings that I had that would closely resemble ranch (i.e. dill), and either way it was awesome. I've also made it with red onions instead of green onions, and again, just as good... Maybe a bit stronger, but you can't go wrong with bacon!

Great simple recipe. I used one box of bow tie pasta, one bottle bacon ranch, one tub of cherry tomatoes, one pack of bacon. I added half block of extra sharp cheddar cheese cubeb up. My new favorite pasta salad.

My husband and I didn't really like this and felt it needed something, although I'm not sure what. I made it as written. I was thinking maybe avocado chunks would be good. That being said, others at the BBQ thought it was good, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars.

I just finished making this salad and it is so good! Looking forward to eating it. I did as suggested and used bacon ranch dressing along with green onion and some celery. Also, used packaged real bacon bits and it worked well. I do not think you can go wrong with this salad...no matter how it is made!

Just thought it was ok.  Tastes like ranch dressing over noodles, nothing special.  Had higher hopes, not sure why given the list of ingredients.  Maybe it's my fault for thinking it would taste different.

This was a huge hit at a family bbq! I used turkey bacon instead and subbed whole wheat shells for regular pasta.  Jersey grape tomatoes are in season so I used them.  Delicious!

I made it the nite before and didn't want the onions to pick up that funky sulfer taste so I used green onions. Used Bacon Ranch dressing. It got dry overnite so added some extra regular ranch. I thought it was just O.K., but the rest of my family loved it. I felt like it was missing something... I will make it again for them but not myself or other company.

I really liked this salad but it definitely needs to be made a day ahead of time.  I used bacon ranch dressing as suggested in some other reviews & when I first made it I wasn't impressed but after sitting in the fridge overnight it was outstanding.  I brought it for a pot luck lunch and everyone enjoyed it.  I'll definitely make it again.

My husband LOVED this and he normally doesn't care for pork bacon or BLT anything.  Very quick and easy - will be good for potlucks.

Easy to make and great for those late morning playdates/gatherings when you want to make/bring something nice and easy but don't want to messup the kitchen first thing.  I'll use less onion,more tomato next time and I think I will add some parmesan cheese.  But the orginal is still good place to start and go from there.

yum! i find that if you sprinkle olive oil on pasta 1st, it makes them less absorbent.  but i do that as a rule with all of my pastas.  i also agree 100% that the ranch packet is the way to go! kids and hubby love it! yay!

This salad is awesome! My husband doesn't like mayo, or miracle whip type salads, but loves ranch dressing so this is the perfect salad for us. It's also simple to vary the flavor depending on the onion you use. We like the purple onion best. Always goes quickly at potluck as well!

Just thought this recipe was ok. Great if you're looking for something that's quick and easy and something that you probably won't have to pick up anything special for. I would make this again if I was in a pinch to throw together a side dish.

I found this recipe last night and was very excited to try it out based on the reviews. I made some for lunch today and am already craving more. I used bottled Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing, red onions, real bacon bits and added lettuce. I only made a small bowl but am excited to bring this salad to picnics and BBQs. Next time I want to add peas, cubes of sharp chedder and broccoli. I absolutley love raw broccoli dipped in ranch dressing so I think it will be a great addition!

Delicious and easy to make.  I took this to a cook out and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I used the bacon ranch salad dressing and it turned out great.  I will definetly make this pasta salad again.

I think this is tasty but have taken it to a couple of potlucks and come home with a pretty full bowl.  I'm not sure if it doesn't look appetizing or if it just doesn't taste good to others.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I used fresh grape and cherry tomatoes from the garden, plenty of onion aned a few diced fresh peppers in the mix.  Not a big fan of ranch myself so I used it about half and half with mayo.  Oh, the next time I made it I also threw in a handful of shredded mild cheddar.  This is a real keeper in my house!

This pasta salad is in my top five favorite summer salads for this year! I made it for a cookout last month and it was a smash hit! I was asked to make it again this weekend! I added some shredded cheddar cheese, used bacon flavored ranch dressing, and used canned tomatoes because that is the only thing I had on hand at the time. I made it the night before to allow the flavors to mingle and mixed in an extra dollop of dressing before serving. PERFECT! And the best part: it's SUPER EASY!!!

I love this recipe!  I made it last week when I didn't know what to do for dinner, but decided to give it a try because I already had most of the ingredients.  I used rotini pasta, grape tomatoes, and substituted peas for the onions.  I didn't have any bacon on hand, but did have a full container of McCormick's bacon-flavored bits.  It was the perfect amount and still tasted great!  My husband and mom added hot sauce to theirs and gobbled it right up.  I will definitely make this again!

I added green onions.  I am not sure of the quantities of anything as I went by taste.  It did need more salt and pepper.  I took it to a large gathering and everyone loved it.

This was wonderful.  Made a double batch to take to a picnic.  It was all gone except for about two cups.  I have never taken anything to this picnic that has received so many compliments and gave out the recipe a bunch of times.  I too added peas to recipe.

I made this for a Memorial Day party. I used smoked, thick-cut bacon, Wishbone Ranch dressing (which I like), and tons of green onions instead of the white (to give it the "L"). Honestly, it was bland. My husband thought it tasted better fresh rather than refrigerated.  I will not be making this again.

I've made this recipe several times and my family loves it. I increase the ranch dressing to 2 cups, use sliced grape tomatoes, and add about 1/2 tsp. of black pepper. Also, I use rotini pasta instead of shell pasta because I find the shells tend to nest inside each other.

Great flavor.  I only had a cup of ranch dressing so I added 1/2 cup of light mayo to the ranch & it was quite yummy. Served w/bbq ribs.  Will make again.

Had some extra pasta after making Baked Ziti and just threw in some chopped tomato, aliced green onions, a couple slices bacon (cooked in microwave), and the ranch dressing.  Eyeballed all ingredients for a quick lunch for hubby.  He said it was the best pasta salad he's ever eaten!

Pretty tasty. I too used Bacon and Ranch dressing and green onions, which I lightly sauteed in Country Crock for a little more flavor. Takes no time at all to make.

My modifications:  I use Hidden Valley Ranch Light Dressing; the best looking fresh tomato available (grape, cherry, Roma, whatever), 3/4 c. shredded cheddar, and no onion.  This is one of the few pasta salads that I think only needs to chill a couple of hours b-4 serving as the pasta does absorb a lot of the dressing and I like it better a little "wetter". One solution is to not add all of the Ranch when assembling salad but instead wait until serving to add last 1/2 c. or so.  Very Good!!

Others said this was good, but just not a preferred taste for me.  Did not blow me away, will not make again.  5/12:  remade this on accident and this time it was good!  :)  I would suggest more ranch dressing as it does soak in.  Peas would probably be great too!

Very good.  Added ranch right the night before and again before serving to get consistency I wanted.  Try Uncle Dan's next time.

This was okay.  I didn't have seashell pasta.  I used left over spaghetti that I chopped up smaller.  I also used some sharp cheddar for a kick.  I wouldn't make this again though, it tasted too fattening with all the ranch dressing. I gave it a 4 because it's probably better if you skip the cheese (that I added) and use a good quality ranch.

Can I just say YUM!!  I used elbow macaroni because that's all I had and added a little fresh dill but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  It was delish.  In fact, I couldn't stop eating it as I was mixing it up.  I also added some cucumber because well, cucumber makes everything better!!

Only OK. Not sure if I didn't use a "good" ranch dressing (I used Wishbone) or if it was something else. Just really bland and not worth the calories.

I made half the recipe as a trial. I think I was the only one who did not use the ranch dressing. I just used mayo and sour cream and added 4 chopped hard boiled eggs, celery seed, sweet onion and black pepper. Next time I will try the grape tomatos and green onions. I really liked this recipe, the bacon made the dish!

I wanted to suggest some things for those trying BLT for the first time. Use real bacon, not the precooked stuff. It doesnt provide enough flavor with the pasta and ranch dressing. Use the full amount of onions. And add some ground pepper. Overall, great recipe that everyone loved. Especially my 8 YO!

I'm not usually a fan of pasta salads but this one was quick, easy, and tasty!  The only change I made was to use green onion because that's what I had on hand.  I also made my ranch dressing from the hidden valley packet because that's the ranch I like.  Yummy!

I made this over Labor Day weekend and will make it again.  I used red onion and added chopped celery and green pepper to give it some color.  I also added chopped cucumber with the seeds removed. I used fresh tomatoes with the seeds removed too. I also added celery salt,dried basil and parsley.  I followed another suggestion and used  Zesty Italian dressing and a bit of mayo with the ranch dressing. This made it real creamy. It turned out wonderful and my husband even ate 2 big bowls.  2 days later it is still creamy, not dry at all, and makes a great lunch.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Served this for a Labor Day dinner and it was a hit.  5 stars from everyone!  Only change I made is when I added the bacon I also put in some bagged lettuce and tossed everything.  It added taste as well as crunch.  After all, what's a BLT without the "L"?

Aside from using the Bacon Ranch dressing as others have suggested, I followed the recipe. Unfortunately this salad lacked interest and flavor.

Not great, but certainly not bad. I thought it was a bit bland, but was helped out by some black pepper. I don't agree it gets better after 3 hours, I thought it tasted better fresh than the day after. The biggest issue I had with it was that it just LOOKED unappealing. It definitely needed something green, peas or broccoli perhaps. The boyfriend liked it, so I'll probably make it again but with a few alterations.

I did not like this but my mother, husband and a coworker said they liked it OK.  I made for a family pot luck ove rthe weekend and had almost all of it left over.  Not sure if htat's b.c there was so much food or that people really didn't like it.  Anyway, brought the left overs into work.  It didn't have much flavor other than the onion.  I used the Hidden Valley Ranch dressing package made up as dressing as another reviewer did.  I will not make this again as I didn't care for it.

I make lots of pasta salads, but had never used a creamy dressing so I just tried this for a huge picnic.  After seeing other's reviews I added a few more veggies for more crunch and to make a huge amount.  I had a cucumber, grape tomatoes, broccoli, and celery on hand so I added lots of them for more crunch and color.  We used the already cooked bacon from Sam's Club and microwaved a whole package of it and crumbled it into the salad.  We purposely added more veggies and dressing, but the same amount of pasta because it was for a huge gathering.  Most people said they liked it.  Thanks for the great idea!

Not a bad base but a few suggestions: 1) It needs an acid badly - vinegar, lemon juice, etc. (to taste) 2) Red onion tastes great in it, you may want to add even more than the recipe asks for, or something else for crunch 3) Make the bacon in the oven, saves tons of hassle and mess. 4) I will add the bacon at the end but it may still need something else - like capers or olives. I used Hidden Valley Ranch (our favorite ranch dressing). EDITED: I added chopped marinated hearts of palm, some sliced black olives and a swig of white vinegar and this salad came alive.

I was a little disappointed that this wasn't nearly as flavorful as I had hoped. I added shredded cheddar cheese as well to give additional flavor, but it didn't help that much.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We used a Vidalia onion.  I also used three tomatoes instead of two.  I felt like it needed more.  I will definitely be making this again and sharing the recipe with friends.

Was certainly easy to prepare.  I read the many reviews & followed the recipe pretty much as written probably added more bacon than was suggested.  I used grape tomatoes and cut them in half and used the bacon ranch dressing as suggested.  The salad was pleasant to the eye but I really didn't think it had a lot of flavor to it. I served this with many other dishes at a buffet party and was asked for recipes for other dishes but not for this one   I will not make again.

I loved it!  I used 2 packages of real bacon bits instead of the bacon and it was fine to mix in with the other.  Used a chopped green pepper once.  Also used extra dressing - didn't really measure and subbed about 1/4 of Salsa Ranch Dressing for plain.  I have made it with bow tie pasta and with tri-color pasta - most anything seems to work!

I made this for a baby shower; I was not impressed with this salad but my guests loved it. I think I should have used bacon ranch dressing as some suggested....I tried to doctor it up with celery salt but it still didn't do anything for me...however, my guests raved about it....go figure.

This was a big hit with my family. The only mod I made was I didn't use light ranch, I used hidden valley ranch out of the packet that you mix with mayo and sour cream. This is also GREAT left over.

Very good! I had some leftover pasta of different kinds when I made this and it made for an interesing mix. I did have to add more ranch dressing and I also cut back on the onions. Loved it!

This recipe was so easy and different.  It’s nice to have a change once in a while.  The only thing I did different is that I used linguini.  Try it!

I made this pasta salad for a bridal share and everyone loved it. Because I had to make so much of it I used Hormel Real Bacon Bits instead of frtying up four pounds of bacon. It turned out wonderful. I love this recipe.

This was a great pasta salad but I followed some of the other ladies modifications by using the Hidden valley ranch dressing packet.  Plus I used green onions instead of regular ones and added peas and orange peppers.

I changed this quite a bit, but it tasted great!! I used the Ranch bacon Kraft dressing - great (even though we usually only have Hidden Valley Ranch at home), I used the pre-made bacon bits - real bacon pieces, I used the red onion in place of a small onion, and I used grape tomatoes I cut in half.  I mixed almost the whole bottle of dressing in first, then let it sit upside down and right before serving added the rest.  It was very good and I had very little left after a neighborhood potluck!!  Thanks for this recipe - so simple I must use it again!!

My husband loves this recipe.  The second time I made it, I used bacon/ranch dressing.  Gave it more flavor, but its good both ways.  And  I love it because its easy to make.

This was good, but it didn't burst with a BLT flavor which is what I was hoping for.  Everyone at the pot luck loved it though!  It was the only salad that was completely gone at the end of the meal.

This was pretty good. The only problem I had with it is that the next day it was a little dry, so I added more ranch to it. I'll make it again. Thanks!

I made this salad for the guests at my son's birthday party. While I didn't eat it because I don't care for pasta salads, I got RAVE reviews about it and four people asked me for the recipe.

Not crazy about this one, but it may be because of my own substitutions.

I used fat free Ranch dressing and fake bacon (we are not meat eaters).  Regardless, I will not be making this one again as there are many other pasta salad recipes that I prefer.

Refreshing summer salad. Really enjoyed the Lite Ranch Dressing instead of the usual mayo. Will become a staple during tomato season.

Made it for a Fourth of July barbecue and it was a hit!  Used ranch dressing packet mixed with mayo and buttermilk. Halved cherry tomatoes. Used green onion and added diced sharp white cheddar cheese. Made it night before. Before serving I added more dressing and the crumbled bacon. Yummy!!

I followed the directions only thing I added was some grilled chicken. I did notice that the dressing got soaked up pretty quick so just keep some on hand to add to your leftovers.

I didn't like the dressing I chose, so sure that influenced how much I liked the recipe.  Next time I'd make my own, and add more veggies.

I made it with a couple of tweaks myself- I had so serve it on some Romaine lettuce that had been cut up.  It was just  a little to ranchy for me, so, since I now live in Kentucky , where bacon grease seems to be added to everything, I added a bit. I think it helped-

Ok this is so easy and good as long as you like ranch dressing. I used whole wheat penne (diabetic honey) and for the first time ever couldn’t taste the difference from regular noodles. Added some fresh peppers I needed to use up, precooked bacon and topped with real bacon bits. Easy and so good. I did about double the dressing but next day even it’s perfect.

I thought it was a little bland but the hubby and party folks ate it up quick. Throw all the cherry tomatoes between 2 plates and cut between the plates to cut them all at once. I made the ranch dressing using the powder, mayo and milk as others did. Also, used green onion instead of onion as I am not a fan, so perhaps that was why it was bland. Mini bowties are adorable for this pasta salad!

This recipe has so much pepper in it, that it absolutely overwhelms all the flavors and leaves your tongue burning. I took it to a picnic and it was not a hit, regardless of the magazine ratings. We regularly eat spicy food, so it is not a matter of having little tolerance. Will not make it again; I am hesitant to trust the ratings after two failed salad recipes. This one and the Blue Cheese Potato salad from the June/July edition.

I love this salad! I acually use recipes for guide lines only, I didnt change to much just the dressing, I used 3 cheese dressing instead of bacon dressing. Next time I may change things up a bit more and probably use alot more bacon.

I also added about 2 cuos of chicken to give it a bit more texture. With the Ranch sauce, I added some BBQ sauce  to give it a nice kick. The overall affect was absolutely delicious!

I didn't make the recipe but I am wondering, where is the lettuce?  Since I didn't make it, I don't know how I can rate it but I was required to rate in order to comment .  I have made my own BLT salad when I was not eating carbs, therefore not eating bread, so I also did not have the pasta in it. But the BLT salad just as a salad with no bread was super delicious.   So I can imagine this pasta salad would be delicious as well.

The only thing I changed was adding baby leaf lettuce. Other than that it was delicious.

No and no. This sounded sooooo good but for some reason we can't even pinpoint, we just did NOT care for it.  Can't even think of any adjustment I would make to try to improve it or our tastes.   Will not make again.

Made two batches for two different functions on the same day!! Both groups LOVED it! I used 1 more Campari tomatoes than the recipe calls for and used the packaged dry Hidden Valley Ranch mix instead of the bottle. When made it was enough dressing for both batches. (Did not want the salad smothered in dressing) I added the bacon just before serving the salad to keep it from being soggy. This is now my go to salad to take to functions and just because!!!

Very good but do not use bacon, use real bacon bits. The regular bacon gets incredibly soggy where as the bacon bits stay crispy.

This was soooo soooo good.  I made this for a work party.  I did change some stuff after reading reviews, and everyone loved it and came back for more.  I used green onion instead.  I feel like this recipe didn't have enough dressing.  I used two cups of Marzetti ranch, and 1/2 cup of Duke's Mayo, added some pepper and Garlic Powder to taste.  When taking it out of the fridge in the AM, it was kind of dry looking so I added a little more ranch and stirred it in.  It was fantastic!

I made this for a pot luck; it was easy, especially since I've started cooking bacon in my oven (best idea since sliced bread).  I found it a bit bland, though; I used homemade Hidden Valley ranch with buttermilk and mayo, that might have been why.  Added some sliced black olives for color and even salt and pepper but it was still kinda meh.

It was bland and needed something. The onions were overpowering. I would make it again but I would use less onions and add some spices.

This was good, but not great. It seemed to be missing something. I used a cup of ranch and a cup of mayo (because BLT's are usually made with mayo). I also used 6 green onions, and could've used more. I also added some sharp cheddar cheese. Had to add some salt for a little extra flavor. This actually tasted better after a day or two when the flavors were allowed to blend. Might make this again if I could figure out just that one little thing it was missing.

I used alot of the opinions of other people and it paid off.  Frozen peas, baby spinach.  I filled it with as much veggies as I could.  It was a big hit at a picnic of mostly men!  (It may have been the only veggies they are!)

Very good and easy recipe!  Took it to our Christmas potluck at work and there wasn't a bit of it left.  I used the prepackaged real bacon bits to save time and green onions and light ranch dressing to help save some calories.  Pretty good stuff!

I brought this pasta salad to a cookout and everyone raved about it! All the guys in the group LOVED it. This is definitely a keeper. I did not change anything with the recipe, however I did use Ranch dressing with bacon.

Lightened this by using Uncle Dan's ranch dressing made with Best Foods low fat mayo and 1% milk (used all 2 cups) and using Smart Bacon (vegetarian meat substitute).  Also used about 1 cup green onions (adds color)and increased the tomatoes a little and added lettuc.  My DH said he couldn't tell it was low fat - highest praise!

Easy & delicious .. right up my alley.  I made this when it was my turn to bring food for card night and the girls loved it - even argued who got to take the leftovers home!

We always add more veggies to this, and more ranch. Good stuff.

This is a great recipe to make for any get together. Its quick and easy. Just before serving I added a small amount of ranch to "freshen" it up.

This is a good recipe.  I added lettuce to complete the BLT.  I took it to church for a potluck people raved over it.

This was a great start! If 4 kids who are all picky eaters ALL liked it, then I'm sold. I added green peppers and cucumbers. I forgot to get black olives or I would have added them. The bacon really gives it the taste. I made two batches, one without the bacon (1 kid's request) and with italian dressing instead.

This was pretty good. Followed directions pretty much exactly but used Garlic Ranch dressing! I did add all the bacon in beforehand and I should have just followed the directions. It is best to add them last!

this was very good but a tad dry. i liked that the dressing was NOT overpoweringly ranch but had a subtle flavoring of it. it could almost pass for the traditional mayo but had the nice bonus of being "light". i would probably make this again.

Simple and quick; was a hit at the pot luck dinner.  Don't think you can mess this one up.  Only change I made was to boil the pasta with some chopped garlic and garlic juice for an added kick.

Just by reading the recipe sounds somewhat boring. I think it would need more color. Kinda of bland.. Maybe some broccoli, red peppers, mushrooms, more chopping involved but I think it would worth the effort...

Pretty good but... in my opinion missing a little something. I baked the bacon in the oven and maybe that had something to do with it. I will try to fry it up next time and see how that works. Thanks for sharing though!

I loved this! Very simple and perfect for a barbecue. I think next time I make it, I may try the bacon ranch dressing, as I didn't put a full pound of bacon, but missed the extra flavor it would have added.  
Yummy!
