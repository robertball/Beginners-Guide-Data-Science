I made this for my boys for dinner and for the most part they liked it. Their biggest gripe was that it was too runny. I baked for 30 minutes as directed, checked it and it was too "watery" so since I had to pick up my son from practice I reduced the oven temp to 180 to prevent overcooking and served when we came home nearly an hour later. It was still runny. As for the rest of the recipe, I did use canned, diced, fire-roasted chiles instead of fresh and reduced the garlic powder to 1 teaspoon.
