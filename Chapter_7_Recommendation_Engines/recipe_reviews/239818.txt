Great for barbeques! I had to search out the ground sumac, but I felt it was worth it as it gave the salad an interesting tang.

One half of a red onion was too much.  Benefitted from the addition of feta and kalamata olives.  Skipped the sumac, added celery salt.

such a nice light summertime salad.  I did add a bit of chopped fresh parsley as well and some of the zest of the lemon for extra citrus flavor without the tart.  thank you for this light and easy recipe.

Note to self - don’t add olives, feta cheese, apples, pepperoni or anything else and call it a Shirazi Salad!
Iranian Friends from the town of origin, introduced me to the Shirazi Salad and i love it. This is a really good repersentation

Why so many changes?  It’s not the real Iranian salad with all the changes. I have lived in Iran and this IS the true delicious recipe.

I added a splash of red wine vinegar and a quarter tsp of pressed garlic. I didn’t have the mint and I only had dried dill. It was still awesome. Mmmmm... even my 7 and 11 year old liked it!

Made exactly as directed except that I used fresh mint instead of dried, and added some pine nuts that I needed to use up.  A great side salad for spring!

Healthy, like it - used fresh mint to boost flavor - wondering if my Sumac was old - when eat this in restaurants it has more flavor. Liked it - will try tinkering with it

I found this salad a tad bitter and not sure what I did wrong. I only cut the recipe in half, added red onion to taste, and left out the dried mint realizing I didnt have any. I did add the dill and sumac and followed the rest of the recipe. It was quick and easy and went well with a lite dinner this evening. I was able to tweak it with a couple of other seasonings.
