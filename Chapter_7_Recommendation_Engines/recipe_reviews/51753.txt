Dissapointing.  Tasted like mustard, but not like the Carolina bbq sauces I recall.  I will stick to the Carolina Treat branded bottled sauce for now.

The good bbq coming out of South Carolina uses the type sauce referred to as "old style." That is the best. There are some ketchupy sauces used in the upstate and the some commercial folks use a mustard base neither of of which should be used with pork. For the real deal, stick with "old style."

I loved the sauce! I used a coarse grain deli sauce for the mustard and it was great! For the bbq seasoning, I used Emeril's Rib Rub...the outcome was YUM! Finger-Lickin'

The mustard overwhelmed the other flavors.  I'm thinking it might have been the type of mustard I used.  It was prepared hot mustard, although; I didn’t think it was hot in the least.  It did however, have a very strong flavor.  My husband liked this sauce, so will try this recipe again.  I will use a different type of mustard, perhaps yellow, spicy brown, Dijon; any suggestions?

I am reallu used to the sauces we have in Alabama, but I actually liked it.  I also love mustard.  My son would eat it on dirt I think.  But I wouldn't.  I would only eat it if it was good, and this is..

I substituted fresh lime juice (because I had no lemons) for the juice, used 1/3 cup (by accident)each white and cider vinegars, substituted granulated garlic for the dried minced garlic, and eliminated the barbeque seasoning.  It turned out delicious. I put the remaining sauce in the refrigerator to use another time.

Too much of a good thing.  I love vinegar in sauces but this was too much mustard and too much vinegar.

I made this and it was very good but don’t know if I followed the recipe correctly. Before the ribs are placed in the smoker, was I supposed to apply the mustard sauce or a completely different rub?

This was a good recipe if you like mustard-based sauce. I am not a huge fan, but this was one of the best I have tasted and I served to a group of about 20 people for Super Bowl with great feedback. I doubled the recipe and only used 3 cups of yellow prepared mustard instead of 4. It was still very mustard-y, but good.

Loved it! I did boneless ribs and they turned out great! Smoked them in our Bradley smoker using hickory briquettes.
