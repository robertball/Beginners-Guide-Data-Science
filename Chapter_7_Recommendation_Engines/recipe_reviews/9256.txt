This recipe is very strong.  I was making it for 20 people and made a few adjustments.  Add about 2 cups of cranberry juice and 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and it tones it down.  Then it was a huge hit and every last drop went.

I think this was a bit too sweet for me and my family, but overall fun to experiment with a quite yummy.
