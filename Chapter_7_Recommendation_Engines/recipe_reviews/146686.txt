We like lemon desserts to be very tangy, so I doubled the lemon juice and reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup. Very good and very tart. I'm going to test them on my mother-in-law this week, as she also likes her desserts really lemony.

I used a graham cracker crust because I didn't have any wafers and this was still amazing.  Tasted like lemon cheesecake bars!!!

This recipe was easy, very tasty, and very good. It's better than the store brought lemon squares.

Nice cool, creamy dessert. I didn't have Nilla waffers, so I used 10 graham cracker squares instead. I also didn't have a lemon to zest, but if I did I know it would have had stronger lemon flavor. Will make again the given way. It was more like lemon cheesecake!

Easy and tasty! I thought they were a nice change from the traditional lemon bars. 

I didn't put the extra lemon zest on top, just because I didn't feel like grating more, and it tasted just fine!

These were great! Tasted like a lemon cheesecake. These did not last long in our house. Great topped with fresh whipped cream!

This was easy and really good.  I like things lemony, so I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and added a little more juice.  I didn't add the lemon gratings because I don't like the texture, but this is a great recipe!!

These were pretty yummy. I added extra lemon juice and left out the zest, as I do not care for the texture. Did no have vanilla wafers so I used gram cracker crumbs, but I accidentally used too much. I wish the recipe had a measurement rather than "20 vanilla wafers" Will most likely attempt these again and try to perfect the crust. Also, I found that these do not last long if place in the refrigerator. =(

I love lemon bars and I love anything with cream cheese, so I was very excited to try this recipe.  And it did not disappoint!  This is fabulous drizzled with a little hot fudge sauce!
