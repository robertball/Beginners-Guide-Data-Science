Well, I didn't like them but my little kids did (ages 2 and 4).  They stuck and were ruined on my electric non-stick griddle but worked out okay in a regular frying pan(go figure?).  Certainly a healthy alternative to those with wheat allergies.  I might make them again, just not sure. They were a bit dense and doughy, not light or fluffy like regular pancakes (or even rice based pancakes) but I assume that's the amaranth flour?  Definitely worth a try, at least once.

My boyfriend raved about these, and I thought they were very good, too. I did not have arrowroot powder, so I substituted an equal amount of potato starch. I didn't have any trouble with the pancakes sticking to the pan as other reviewers did, so my substitution may have been the key. The pancakes were a bit thin, yet still fluffy (not dry) and the flavor was great. Will try adding just a bit extra potato starch next time to see if that makes them a little thicker.

We found that the batter was a tad runny and that the first pancake was a bit dense and stuck to the pan.  Added one egg and a abit more flour to the batter and not only did this make the pancakes more fluffy, but solved the sticking issue as well!  Will make again for sure and adding it to the recipe box now!

I made these without the arrowroot, baking soda, lemon juice or almonds and substituted the veg oil woo live oil and added cut up banana. They turned out great! I also cooked them in coconut oil and used agave as my syrup they tasted great and were a little mushy in the middle but good nonetheless!

They are gritty and smell terrible.
