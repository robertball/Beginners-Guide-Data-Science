For making 1 pizza- I recommend a 6oz paste and an 8oz sauce with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.  Why make more when you can make fresh so quickly.  I also recommend using all dried herbs instead of fresh onion etc. It will blend better in the sauce.  Also a tiny bit (1/2 teasp) vinegar will give it tang, and a little white sugar.  I think the other spices you should taste for preference as you go along!

I prefer chunky pizza sauce, but my husband likes his smooth so I decided to make this recipe.  It was really good.  Has lots of flavor.  I added a little pizza seasoning and some red pepper flakes to mine.

This was a good start, but I think next time I'd use about half of the olive oil.  It just seemed to be so overpowering and a little bit too oily.

I pretty much followed the suggestions of the last reviewer, Liza, and got a wonderful pizza!!  I used "Jays Pizza Crust" from this webstite. My husband said it tasted like it came from our favorite "non chain" pizza, that we spend nearly 20 dollars on. Made at home,with many toppings for around 5 dollars.

I tried this in a bind (ran out of store bought) My husband and I loved it! I cut the recipe in half since I was making a small pizza, added fresh basil and eliminated the tomato paste (I ran out of that too!) I will be using in place of store bought going forward. YUM!

The onions made it too strong of a sauce. It took away from the flavor of the toppings. I like onions but everyone I made the pizza for was against them.

Very good pizza sauce!  Cut the recipe in half, still used 2 cloves of garlic and added a bit of sugar.  Enjoyed, thanks!

Wonderful! I cut recipe in half using same amount of garlic, onion and herbs.  Let it simmer a couple of hours and it really cooked down to a nice thick sauce.  Plenty for the one large pizza we made.  Only addition was a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Thank you!!

The sauce is very bland, too much tomato taste, Cooking it right now and after adding some "tweaks" I still cannot get it to taste like pizza sauce. But I used "Hunts" tomato sauce and paste because our store offered no other so it could very well be because of that, never liked Hunts, too strong.

The recipe is fine with one exception: too much onion!  If you are even the slightest bit sensitive to onions, eliminate the minced onion and leave in only the onion powder. In this case less is more.

Okay, sal, sign me up as the president of your fan club.  This is just the latest of your recipes I'ved used, substituting fresh tomatoes for the canned ones and put up 20 pints this past weekend.  Have 40# more of homegrown 'maters waiting for tomorrow for the same destiny for my daughter and family.  I waterbathed for 35 minutes per pint.  The flavor of this recipe is fabulous.  Of course, most won't want to make these mega-batches...but this recipe is first class!

This is very good pizza sauce, and really quick and easy to make.  I'll never buy pre-made sauce again!  I made a half batch, and it covered one 12" round deep dish pizza and one 10" square thin crust pizza, with a little bit leftover.  I omitted the minced onion used 1/2 tsp. onion powder.

I thought this was a very good sauce recipe.  I used Jay's Pizza Crust recipe from this site.  Excellent combination!!  My family agreed (yeah!!!).  This will be the sauce and dough recipe I use from now on.  I did cut the recipe in half and could have had enough for 3 scimpy on the sauce pizzas.  I almost used the amount I had on 2 and my husband complained it was a little too saucy for him.  Please note my family does not like a lot of sauce!  If you do, you should probably disregard how much I think this recipe makes.  Thank you so much Sara for a wonderful sauce recipe!

Made the recipe, following the instructions, and it came out perfect.  We like our pizza light on the sauce, so we have more than enough left over.

I always feel better when preparing a sauce that has actually been cooked, rather than just "steeped", because I never think that the chopped garlic, or onion, or whatever is germ free enough when only steeped.  This is an EXCELLENT recipe to tweak for your own tastes.  I cut the oil to 1-1/2 Tbs., onion to 1/2 cup, and the oregano to 1-1/2 Tbs.  This way I could add other spices to my liking, such as basil, marjoram, cayenne, dry red pepper flakes, sugar, etc.  It made the 4 cups, enough for four 12" pizzas.  I froze 3 portions for later use.  Don't be shy--EXPERIMENT!!!  Mine had the basics of this recipe but it turned out SO differently that I cannot really review it as written.

This recipe is an excellent starting point for sauce, but I agree that the cup of onion is a little strong for me.  Also, for me and my husband, we like to sneak in a little fresh basil, thyme, and other spices.  However, if you're trying to develop a pizza sauce recipe and you're clueless (like me), this is a great model.

Easy to make, nice thick sauce, made enough for two large pizzas, after I cut this in half. I used dried minced onion (1 Tbl). It worked out nicely for our lunch, but I thought it was too tomatoey for my tastes. Hubby didn't care much for it either. I doubt I'll use this again.

This is a very good sauce, but I did add fennel seed and simmered it for about an hour and a half. This will be the sauce I use from now on. Thank You

This was really good. The first time I tried making it, I burnt the onions but that was my fault for not having all the ingredients ready. Otherwise, I think it turned out very well. It was a little thick from all the paste so I added a little bit of water.

This is pretty good recipe; needing only a few ingredients.  I didn't use it for pizza this time, but will try it some day.  I used it for the Pizza Casserole recipe here.  I cut this recipe in half for it.

1.30.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25402/pizza-sauce-ii/ ... Wow!  Good sauce!  I cheated some because of time, but I'm sure this is great sauce either way.  I halved the recipe using one 15oz can sauce, one 6oz paste, 1/2T oregano, 1/4t sugar, 1/8t onion & garlic powders.  So simple so good.  Used with Gammaray's Onion & Garlic Mozzarella Puffs ... http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/63643715/my-onion-and-garlic-mozzarella-puffs/detail.aspx ... Yum!

Wonderful flavourful sauce that compliments the pizza rather than overpowering the toppings

I loved this, it was easy to make and my husband thought the taste was excellent. I changed the serving size to 16 since there is only two of us and froze what was left to use another time. Thanks.
