These cookies are awesome! I followed the reciped exactly, but doubled it. I ended up with close to 90 cookies, and I froze some for later. They are a cross between chocolate chip cookies and brownies. I can't stay out of them! Thanks for listing it. EDITED TO ADD: These cookies don't keep for too long, so eat them within 2-3 days. I don't recommend freezing them because they really harden quickly once thawed (like in 1-2 days). They're awesome when fresh, though!!!

The dough is delicious, and the cookies even better! Easy to make, and very chocolatey. Would also be really good with some white chocolate chips I imagine, and I think I'll try that next time.

I didn't want to mess up another pan to melt the chocolate chips, so I stuck them in the microwave on low power for a few minutes. Worked well, just make sure to stir every 30 seconds or so they can burn, as I learned from experience. 

I wonder if some of the reviewers aren't familiar with this type of cookie; several folks have mentioned that the powdered sugar left funny white spots on the cookies after baking. I've generally seen these called "Chocolate Quakes", and the idea is to have a white, sugar-covered ball of dough which breaks open during baking to reveal the chocolate underneath.

I used mint chocolate chips in the recipe and it came out great.  Also works as a recipe for bars in a 9X12 pan.

This was a great recipe.  It was so easy and the cookies came out so moist and chewy.  I am getting ready to make these again.  This recipe is a keeper to use over and over again.

Unbelievable!  The best chocolate chip cookie I have ever tasted.  The only things I did differently were using 2 extra large eggs, using margarine instead of butter, adding the half cup of icing sugar with the flour, and adding half a cup of cocoa to the recipe.  I was doubting that the cookies would flatten out so I baked one in a toaster oven and I was stunned at how the cookie turned out.  This recipe is a keeper and it looks like I'll have to make more than 2 batches at a time :)

AWESOME!!!!  They turned out soft and chewy.  I made these with my son, who wanted 1/2 the batch without the icing sugar.  Both batches AWESOME!!!!  We will make these often.

Hi there..These cookies are yummy but I forgot to roll them in the sugar and you get a bit of a bitter taste from all the semi sweet chocolate chips.... Rolled in the sugar they would be delicious I am sure........ Nice recipe......

Not bad at all, they stayed sooo soft.  Be generous when rolling in the powdered sugar.  Would use this recipe again :)

These are definitely amaaazing cookies. Definitely chewy and brownie like but with a bit of a crisp to the outer crust. YUM. They are my go to cookies at the moment and I've made them with peanut butter chips and Heath toffee bits and both came out great as well! The recipe is very very easy and very flexible. Thanks Walt!!

Tasty, tasty!  I didn't cream butter, rather melted butter, one semi-sweet candy bar, one milk chocolate candy bar, some leftover chocolate icing I needed to get rid of, sugar, and vanilla all together. (Didn't have choc chips, but was craving chocolate cookies).  Added a bit more flour to compensate, but it worked out divine!  Loved the powdered sugar topping that made them look like crocodile skin!  First batch burned a bit on the edges, so reduced time. All other batches came out before they were really ready -- so a bit soft.  Two days later (and hiding them before they were raided), they are still wonderful and soft. Cookie monster husband said these are now his personal favorite cookie. Easy to adapt. Will make again my way or the way it is written. Seems to be foolproof!

I really enjoyed this! I had all the ingredients in my kitchen. I wasn't so good at rolling them in powdered sugar and such so this is what worked best for me. I made them into cup cakes with the powdered sugar on top! I think there was another review that mentioned they were a lot like brownies, and I agree, and that is fine by me. This is perfect for a chocolate fix. I just couldn't master the technique in the recipe, so cup cake it! I will try brownie style next.

My daughter made these for a 4-H project.  When she took them out of the oven she said, "They look so pretty".  They also taste wonderful raw or baked.  This is sure to be a prize winner at our fair.

When you melt the chocolate chips. Throw in a few of the table spoons of butter you're suppose to add into the pot. It helps grease the pan so you don't have a big clump of chips. These spread out really far on the pan for me. So unless you like big cookies, smaller scoops are better. Overall a yummy cookie :)

SUPER EASY RECIPE. My 14 year old daughter made this all on her own. She made one giant cookie and especially good when eaten warm. We piled it high with ice-cream. It was gone in two hours. She wants to make it again.

Another 5 star rating. Made these along with other cookies for my husbands work - these were the first to go to the "lucky ones."  They are like cookie brownies and very rich and chocolately.

Great cookie, just like a brownie cookie!!!  Very good but definately double the recipe.  Don't judge the cookie on the dough, didn't think the dough was that good but the cookie was great.

These cookies were really good...everyone loved them! I will definitely make these again. Instead of adding the second cup of chocolate chips to the batter, I instead added half green mint chips and half chocolate chips. They tasted so good...I love chocolate and mint and if you do too, you must try!!! Also I don't know why others complained about the confectioners sugar not baking in...it looked really pretty. 12 minutes was how long I baked them...seemed about perfect...YUMMY!!!

These were good cookies, but I have both complaints and praise.  In rolling the cookies in the powdered sugar, as others said, my cookies had white spots to where all the sugar was not cooked in.  The taste didn't change, but the look wasn't as appealing.

I froze the dough for 45 min and they still were sticky and ended up cooking them for 17 min because the dough just wouldn't cook.

I still have some in the freezer stored for later.  I have had compliments on them, just the actual appearance wasn't as pretty as other desserts I've made.  All in all, I'd make them again.

EASY (my 4 year old mixed these up with mom's help)
Tasty-my 7 kids and husband gobbled these up!
RICH-made with butter and chocolate-and more chocolate...how could it not be rich?
Recipe placed semi-permanently on my refrig. door for quick reference so I can bake these often!  Thanks for a keeper!

**DO NOT CREAM POWDERED SUGAR**
I'm sure when done correctly these cookies are wonderful. I bake often, so when reading the recipe I knew that the powdered sugar was not intended to be creamed with the butter and white sugar. My husband however, who does not bake often, did not understand that. I think that when a recipe is written it should be assumed that the user is inexperienced. My rating is PURELY based on the way the recipe was written and not on the way the product turns out.

Yep, these are pretty awesome and very rich. The directions are clear and they turned out great with no changes. I agree with other reviewers about being generous with the powdered sugar. These would be really good with peanut butter chips in the dough and still adding the melted chocolate ones. I will make again.

These were fantastic! Both me and my boyfriend gobbled up the whole batch in about three days! I kept them in the fridge to prevent the drying other reviews mentioned. I thought they were good cold. They had the texture of a cookie on the outside but a brownie on the inside! GREAT!

Amazing!! These are, I think, the best chocolate cookies I have ever eaten! I used the tip from other reviewers to add some cocoa. It is the only change I made, and they are awesome. I will absolutely make these again. They will look beautiful on holiday platters too:-)

I goofed...I melted all 2 cups of chips and added it to the batter.  I then added white chips in the mix (about 1 cup).  They turned out very delicious!!!  They are very fudge/brownie like.  I didn't like them rolled in the confectioner's sugar.  They were too sweet.

Instead of 1 whole cup of Chocolate Chips added into the dough at the end of the recipe, Add 1/2 of a cup of Chocolate Chips and 1/2 of a cup of Reese's Peanut Butter Chips... & you have a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup!! Sooo yummy! Everybody loved these cookies and were raiving over them. Also as someone said before me, they only last for 2-3 days, so eat them up!! ;)

I reduced the flour by 1/4 cup, adding the icing sugar to the flour mixture as suggested by another reviewer, and added cherry-flavoured dried cranberries and chopped walnuts to balance out the chocolate. My husband was eating them all before I could finish baking them!

WOW! These marry the taste of brownies with the look of beautiful crinkly cookies! They are so wonderfully chocolatey. Very easy to make. I microwaved the choc chips for about a minute, stirred twice. Remember to keep your bowl of dough in the freezer while first batch of cookies bakes. I put about 8 cookie balls per sheet (they spread out) and 2 sheets in the oven and took them out while still soft. 9-10 min at 325. Got about 40 cookies total. We really enjoyed these! Thank you for the recipe Walt!

Delicious! We made them with white chocolate and chocolate chips and they were mouthwatering. Make sure to eat them within 2-4 days because they do not stay well. (Not a problem with us, gone on the first day)

These cookies are great!  They come out fluffy and very soft, so it was a bit difficult for some to come off the pan.  I did end up breaking a few.  I think next time I'll lightly grease my sheets so as to prevent the sticking.

Wonderful tasty cookie!  Lacks a little "curb appeal" - keeping them small & heaping on the powdered sugar before baking helps.  I used a cup of melted milk chocolate chips in the batter & then used the semi sweet chips for the rest.  Very soft & designed to address any chocolate craving.  A real keeper!

My friends loved these cookies, but I found that 10-12 minutes just wasn't long enough.  I cooked them for 15 (and I'm not in a high altitude.) The cookies didn't spread out to the cookie shape. After the first batch, I started flattening out the balls a bit and that helped.

My husband really liked these cookies; I'm a little bit harder to please, though.  The dough was really yummy!

These cookies are absolutely delicious! Had to melt 4 squares of semi sweet chocolate with the remaining 1/2 cup chips being as I only had 1 bag of chips. It was hard not to eat all the dough before it was all baked. I ended up with 4 dozen cookies since I like to make mine smaller so my kids aren't all hopped up on sugar when I tell them they can have a cookie. Yum! Definately making again!

Absolutely wonderful. Used olive oil spread instead of real butter. Baked into soft, moist cookies. My little one and I made lots of trips to the cookie jar today!

ok ya'll I just made these cookies and as they were pretty simple to make and mix after freezing them they were still very sticky when I went and rolled them in the confectioners sugar granted they did leave white flakes . but even though I did cook them for the time said some did burn on the bottom as is in some cases ovens are different. but My husband tried them and even though he likes chocolate he didnt like them I knew it was a new recipe and all I think I will stick to the old fashioned kind

Very good cookies!  The only suggestion I would make is that you need to lightly dust the confectioner's sugar and not roll the cookies in it.  Since it isn't always uniform, the cookies have spots of white that don't bake in.  I also made this recipe using 1 cup cappuccino chips for the part that is melted and 1 cup milk chocolate for the part that you mix into the dough.  Yummy!

Okay, so I messed up on the recipe and put the powdered sugar in the dough before noticing that the cookies should have been rolled in it, but they turned out fabulous!  I didn't roll them in sugar since I would be afraid they might turn out too sweet after all.  Next time I make them (and there will be a next time...yum), I will make them the same way.  These are so good.  My kids said they taste like a mix between a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie - two of my favorite things.  So glad I stumbled across this recipe.  I was looking for a cookie that didn't require baking soda becasue I didn't have any on hand.

These are excellent!  I wanted a change from the usual oatmeal chocolate chip I make...and these were fantastic.  I however didn't freeze them before putting them on a parchment covered baking sheet, nor did I roll in confectioners sugar.  I just used a cookie dough scoop and baked them for 12 minutes..yummy!!!

I made these with my friends, and they were really good. The only thing that wasn't great was that they're kind of hard...... We made two batches. One we baked for about fifteen minutes, and they were freaking hockey pucks. The next batch we baked for a little under ten minutes..... They were better, but kind of hard on the bottom. It might have just been my oven though, as no one else seems to have this problem.

OMG!!!! These cookies were so FABULOUS!!!! Tried them for the first time tonight and the whole family LOVES them. We're snowed in with a blizzard going and these warm, delicious morsels  really hit the spot. I highly reccommend nibbling on some after they have had a few minutes to cool and then washing it down with some milk.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS!!! :0)

These are very yummy! I had white chocolate chips so I used those and added 1/4C of cocoa powder for a little more chocolate.I did have about 1/2C chocolate chips to just add in. We decided we liked them best with the powdered sugar but would definitely make them without. They baked at 350* for 12 mins and were perfect!

amazing!  very soft in the middle and a nice crispy cookie outside.  Mine took a little longer to get done than it says, but this is my first time using this oven so the temp may be off a little.   This will definitely be added to my Favorites list and be a regular for my family from now on.  I cant wait for my grandchildren to try them. Thank you for such a great recipe.

This was a great recipe!  I used it as a "skeleton" recipe, then made some changes just on what I had available!  I didn't have chocolate chips, instead I had toffee bits.  So I omitted the chocolate chips.  Instead of a chocolate cookie, I ended up with a vanilla cookie with toffee bits in it, then followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  They were fantastic!  Sweet and chewy with just a bit of crunch on the oustide!  My family has already requested a second batch!

I love this recipie.  I am not even a big chocolate fan but could not get enough of these cookies.  I had to make a few changes though.  I used Whole Wheat Flour instead of regular. I did not have enough white sugar so I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar.  The cookies came out amazing.  They were so soft. I will definitely make these again.

great recipe i tried it, Don't roll dough in confectioners sugar it doesn't look good. Grease cookie sheet. Also don't but icing on the cookies it ruins the taste. Melt the CC in the microwave by putting them in for 15 seconds and then stirring... until they are completely melted. And, as always make sure the butter is completely softened. Also use semisweet CC. Add mints instead of 2nd cup of CC for a new taste its a great recipe.

I tried making this and it was way too sticky, even after I added extra flour. I ended up just making a giant cookie blob. It was good, but not what I expected.

wow! this was the best chocolate chip cookies i have ever made. they came out looking so pretty with the confectioner's sugar. I was going to skip it, but I an so glad I didn't! The only thing i changed was i didn't melt the extra cup of chocolate chips, and just made regular chocolate chip cookies. It still tasted awsome. It was plenty sweet enough. I also suggest making the dough balls small because of the amount of baking powder, it fluffs up really well. anyway, my family loved them!

We loved this recipe! I will definitely make this again. One suggestion: If you're making it for a family, make a double or triple batch...they run small.

Best Ever! I made a few substitutions though. I skipped the chocolate chips and instead pressed m & m's on top (did not mix them in with the batter). They were chewy and pretty and delicous.

I followed the recipe except for chocolate chips, I just made it without it, so it was more like chocolate cookies instead, and had to bake it for 25 minutes instead of 10-12 minutes on 350 degrees, but it turned out great!! It was moist and chewy, and it looks like store bought.

I've made these twice now with a few adjustments. Second time I used a little less sugar, probably about 1/4 cup less. The first batch where a little gritty, but with less sugar they were great! I also put a few peanut butter chips in with the chocolate chips ... YUM! Also, I do not roll them in powdered sugar. I actually had a man purpose to me after trying them. My husband didn't like that very much, :), but it shows how wonderful these are!

I use this recipe almost anytime I want to make cookies because they are easy and so delicious. I use cocoa powder in place of any recipe that calls for unsweetened chocolate squares and that workks perfectly in this recipe.

I make these as brownies. They are excellent brownies. The chocolate flavor is great. I don't freeze the dough. Just spread the batter/ dough in a square pan, and voila...yummy, chocolaty brownies!

These were pretty good. Also I think this is a great starter recipe for someone who hasn't baked cookies from scratch before (like myself). The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because they were sweeter than I expected (and preferred). Maybe next time I would cut the sugar, or melt 1 cup of bitter chocolate chips to mix into the batter. Also, it was difficult to tell when they were done since the color didn't change much. We cooked them for a 12 minutes as the recipe said and it was fantastic!

This cookies were delicious! Very soft and chewy which I like. I skipped the rolling in powdered sugar step for the first batch but they didn't look very appetizing so from the second batch on, I did the rolling and they were soooo much better!  I highly recommend taking the time to roll them before baking, it's completely worth it for appearance as well as taste.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I only froze them for 15 minutes and they were very hard. I only baked them for six minutes but they were still pretty darn chewy the next day! 

All in all, great recipe, but I prefer my cookies softer.

Super good! Definitely wait a couple minutes before attempting to remove them from the pan - they tend to crack when they're warm because the middle is so gooey.

My family loves this recipe. I didn't freeze the dough until firm or roll them in the confectioners sugar but dropped by spoonful onto the cookie sheet and baked.  They still turned out wonderful.

Not sure what everyone is raving about. I have tried at least 30 different cookie recipe and this is NOT in the top ten. Its definitely more like brownie, you don't really get to appreciate the chocolate chips. No zip to this recipe. Sorry.

Excellent recipe.  I made these with my 9 year old daughter.  We had a lot of fun.  I suggest using a 1 inch size ice cream scoop when portioning it out because they are sticky.  I loved the recipe because it didn't call for brown sugar (something that is not a staple item in my house).  Excellent recipe worth making again.  Next time I will probably double or triple the recipe to have some dough left over to freeze for later use.

This cookie was ok.  I doubled the recipe but the dough was super sticky and hard to work with...even after I had left it in the freezer for 45 min.  Next time I would divide the dough when I chilled it.  Also the recommended bake time was off but perhaps my cookies were too big.  Regardless I don't think I'll be making again.  (That said, the end result was tasty...just too much hassle for a cookie).

I love this recipe - I make it in the cooking class I teach and at home for my family.  I change it by skipping the confectioner's sugar and instead adding a couple cups of white chocolate, peanut butter, or butterscotch chips.  I add until the batter looks even.  They are amazing.

Very good.. especially while warm! I suggest you definitely use the powdered sugar because it is very chocolatey and the chocolate I used was very rich and a little bitter but it all turned out good. I also have to say it was not hard to make at all so go for it.

I followed the directions exactly and these cookies really are delicious.  I made these on a whim for a friend's birthday and I was pleased at how fast and easy they were to make. I know this is common sense for most people, but really keep an eye on your first batch because they will go from done to burnt very quickly. That being said, I did have to alter the time in the oven to only 8 minutes as opposed to the 10-12 minute time mentioned in the recipe. I will be making these again at Christmas time and trying some variations... rum, mint chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and butterscotch. Can't wait!

I'm typically very critical when using other peoples' recipes and I usually alter at least a little.  After trying these, I have never altered a thing.  I rarely ever make/eat cookies because they are rarely the consistency that I like.  These are delicious!  They stay perfectly soft and taste amazing.  I took them into work one time and since then they've been requested MANY times!

This recipe was outstanding! They were so good that I had to give some to my neighbors after they got out of the oven! I highly recommend that you are very generous with the powered sugar because it really makes the cookie. Also you might want to refrigerate the dough longer than requested in order to get it firm enough to roll. Once again, excellent recipe.

Loved this recipe.  I made it "as is" and the cookies were lovely.  Was a very easy recipe for my 4 year old to help with....and she LOVED the way they looked when they were finished (ie. the white and black effect of the cracking--very Cruella Deville...LOL)

Great recipe! Only problem I seem to be having is that both times I've made these cookies (and I follow recipes exactly first time round) is that they seem a little dry. Second time I used a thermometer to test oven heat and I also baked for a shorter period of time. Any suggestions? Otherwise, these have been added to my home recipe box, so thanks!

if you're not a fan of the flat cookies. don't melt your butter, you're better off mixing the butter when it is hard. to do this you cut the butter into sections that way it's easier to blend :)

My girlfriend and I made these tonight and they were fantastic!  We had leftover dark chocolate chips that we melted into the mix and then used semi-sweet chocolate chips for the other cup.  This is easily the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had.  Thank you for this recipe!

Yummy!!  Perfect for any chocaholic.  One tip I recommend to do is use parchment paper and flatten the cookie just a tiny bit so they have a better shape when they bake.  Also, make sure you get a healthy coating of powdered sugar on them before they go into the oven, this helps with the "crackling" effect.

Delicious. Soft like a brownie, yet still a cookie. Very chocolaty. I used whole wheat flour, and replaced half the butter with applesauce, and it came out beautifully. A 3 tablespoons of half-and-half added to the melting chocolate chips makes the cookies even more creamy.

If I had the option of giving this one 10 stars...I would. They are amazing! I was a little skeptical as the batter looked way too wet but after freezing the batter for about 45 minutes....and then rolling them in the powdered sugar...they came out perfect! I am bringing some of them into work tomorrow and I am sure they will be a hit. Thank you  :)

I tried a lot of recipes for a party and these were by far the most popular. 
I soaked some glace cherries in kirsch & added them to the mixture which worked incredibly well.
These are just what you want - crisp on the outside & chewy & cakey in the middle. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

Very good Family Loves them. I altered this recipe a little. First I  doubled it and instead of melting 1 cup of chocolate chips I did 4 wrapped semi sweet squares. Instead of 2 cups of white sugar I used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown. I didn't roll them either, I dropped them by spoonfuls. My family ate them right up.

I didn't like these cookies.  They were way too sweet for my taste, even after I stopped rolling the dough in confecitoner's sugar.  My neighbor tried one and thought they were too sweet too (unprompted by me!).  My husband liked them and that surprised me because he is not a big sweets or chocolate fan.  In the end, they didn't get eaten and my husband took them to work.  Other than the sweetness, the form and consistency of the cookies were fine.  However, I won't be making them again, ever.

Very tasty, esp with a mix of white and milk chocolate chips (white in the mix and chocolate chip or reverse for fun)!

holy cow...these are good!  first of all, i hate when people rate a recipe then say all the things they did different, but i'm guilty...i changed the recipe ever so slightly.  i'm still rating them 5 stars because with my small alterations they turned into 10 stars!  i melted the butter and let it cool slightly before adding the sugar.  i added about a 1/3 cup of cocoa to the flour mixture and i forgot to add the 2 eggs until after i combined the wet and dry ingredient.  i baked them 8 minutes, 50 seconds.  they turned out chewy on the inside!  awesome!  oh, and i also forgot to roll them in powdered sugar after i chilled the dough.

My daughter (10) made these all alone... simply the best cookies I (dad) have ever tasted.  I think we found our cookie recipe.

The double chocolate was not overpowering, but really an awesome dovetail with the chocolate chips... of course, we added a few more choclatec hips than called for, but at that point... it was quite chocolate, so what's the big deal?

Stirring them in by hand was a good decision, and the dough was quite thick.

I made these cookies at the request of a friend. He said they were the best ever. I did not chill or freeze the dough because I didn't have enough time to do so. I simply dropped the dough into the confectionary sugar and then rolled the dough around to coat the cookie. I then  rolled the dough into a ball and placed in on the cookie sheet. The cookies were evenly coated. I baked the cookies for only 9 minutes and let them cook on the cookie sheet for two minutes. I  used white chocolate chips as well as semi-sweet. I will add this recipe to my collection! Thanks!

My family ate these right up.  I had to improvise for the confectioner's sugar: I stuck some granulated in the blender and it came out soft and sort of flaky. It stayed on top of the cookies without soaking in, which was nice.  Also, I forgot the chocolate chips until the last moment when they were semi-frozen!  Haha I need to stop baking before dawn.

We've tried this recipe twice now and we love it!! The last batch we combined milk and white chocolate chips and it worked fantastically. The first lot all got a bit mashed together but by the second time... we were pro's and had mastered the spacing. We are in love!

All I have to say is, even though I bake something new every weekend for my friends, never before have I gotten a reaction like I did for this recipe.  For me, it was too chocolately- but after all, it IS called chocolate chocolate chip...

This recipe is great, except the cookie does not expand like it does in the picture. It stays more like a little ball. I baked it for a lot longer because I thought it should expand, which made them crunchy. But other than that they're great!!!

Really chocolatey. Defenitely like a cookie brownie. Used mini choc chips- what i had on hand. Would do that way again. And fyi for you amatuer bakers out there dont mix vanilla in with melted chocolate- it hardens...others probably know this.. Oops. Did have to do that part again... ;) otherwise a hit!

They taste great. I'm hopeful I can make them a little bit healthier next time by not rolling them in sugar, and using whole-wheat flour. I'll see how that tastes. Any other ideas?

Found them to be very bland and not chocolaty enough. Not a bad cookie over all just might need adjustments.

Wonderful recipe! A quick and easy way to make delicious cookies.  My only suggestion would be to leave out the salt as butter has enough salt content for this recipe.

I loved this recipe but beware you have to be craving for a real DOUBLE DOSE OF CHOCOLATE.  I can usually eat several chocolate chip cookies but these were so chocolaty I could only have a couple. I didn't roll in conf. sugar, instead I added the 1/2 cup to the mix.

OMG!! AWESOME doesn't even describe this cookie...There are no words..I made a batch with the powdered sugar and without. I also added m&m chocolate chips for the kids. They all sounded like a commercial as they tried to describe the cookies in between bites. WELL DONE...This one is a keeper.

These were very good and like nothing I have made before. They turned out very pretty. The dough came out a bit sticky (or super soft) for some reason, but rolling them in the powdered sugar solved that problem. I used the double boiler method to melt the chips. I think this is an easy way to keep an eye on the consistency and prevents burning. I tried 3 different versions out of the same batch. One was the traditional way, the others included unsweetened coconut alone and coconut w/ the powdered sugar. Because some people don't like coconut - I marked the cookies with both toppings with a chocolate chip on top once they came out of the oven. The cookies were soft enough it pressed right in and looked decorative. I had forgotten to add the remaining chocolate chips to the batch after I melted the recommended amount for the batter. I am sure this other step would have made them even softer.  I will make this recipe again and follow the directions more closely!

Very good recipe. We just added cocoa powder instead of melting the chocolate chips. We also didn't roll them in the powdered sugar. These cookies had a wonderful cake-like texture and were still soft in the following days.

My family gave these 5 stars! I used milk chocolate chips and added peanut butter chips to the mix. These make attractive cookies. Thanks for sharing!

These cookies are yummy and easy to make. They taste exactly like brownies though, so just take note of this. I minimized the amount of chocolate that went into them (to about 1 1/2 cup) and it still turned out splendid. And also, instead of butter I used coconut which added some really nice flavor. I would probably make this recipe again, for my family even though they were a hassle to remove from the tray (they stuck). Also, make sure you DO freeze them for at LEAST fifteen minutes because the mixture is very sticky and failure to freeze them will result in a gooey mess. Not fun!

I decided to try this recipe today and didn't have chocolate chips, I only had mint chocolate chips.  I had my son run to the convenience store and buy Hershey's large size chocolate bars.  I used 1 1/2 melted Hershey bars and then 1 cup of mint chocolate chips.  What I did to roll the dough, after reading the reviews about it being so sticky, I slathered on margarine on my hands, and this seemed to completely fix that issue.  I did not completely roll the dough in powdered sugar, rather I just rolled the top of each cookie.  The white spots were easily remedied with dusting the remaining powdered sugar over the tops of the cookies after the baking process.  I can say that I disagree that these are even remotely close to a brownie to me.  They tasted like a regular chocolate chip cookie, just a small amount chocolatier and, of course, the mint chocolate chips added a nice touch, unfortunately, the mint does overpower most of the other flavor.  I would definitely agree that the dough is much better than the baked cookie, and I like the one reviewer's comment on homemade cookie dough ice cream.  I bet the dough would be great for that!

Amazing!
Although I substituted the semisweet chips with 1 1/2 cups of milk chocolate (i was to lazy to go to the store) they still came out WONDERFUL! You'd think with my little experiment they would be to sweet, but they werent! Gone in a record of 5 minutes- sifting powdered sugar on top once they came out of the oven was the final touch of a splendid 5 star cookie

Yummy!  I love chocolate so this recipe was perfect!  It actually was cool....it reminded me of one of my Grandma's recipes "Chocolate Krackles" that I've been wanting to try! I had a little bit of leftover dough, so I got my little brother and sister together and we made a batch of cookies, spread Chocolate Cherry Chunk in between two cookies, and froze them to make our own creation: Gourmet Black Forest Ice Cream Sandwiches!  Scrumptious!
