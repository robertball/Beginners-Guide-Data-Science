My mother made these cookies every Christmas and I love them!  The only difference is that we add the Jelly right after your remove them from the oven.  As for people who said they are too crumbly, let them sit for a minute or 2 on the cookie sheet before removing them, they will get firmer as they cool.

I've made many a thumb print cookie and thought these looked really yummy with the addition of the sesame seeds. However, while mixing I found that the dough appeared to be very dry and crumbly which made me a little nervous. I had tripled the recipe so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it, but to be on the safe side, I added in two eggs which added enough moisture to work with the dough. Two tablespoons of sesame seeds wasn't nearly enough for even a single batch, so I increased that by quite a bit. The end result was a beautiful little festive looking cookie that just melted in your mouth. Delicious and thank you!

I have not tried using this recipe because I am afraid the cookies will not turn out.  I think maybe the cookies were dry and crumbly for one reviewer because there are a couple of ingredients missing.  Along with the butter, sugar, extract, and flour, try adding 2 egg yolks.  I would also omit the 1/2 tsp salt.  Chill dough about an hour.  After shaping dough into balls, roll them in egg whites before rolling them in sesame seed.  I think this recipe has potentials and would yield great cookies with some adjustments.

These are great and so easy to make! I use a little less salt and try to pack as much preserve in the middle as I can (love the fruit flavor!) They're shortbread-type cookies so they're not supposed to be moist per se, but they break apart smoothly and melt in your mouth. My Nana has been making them for Christmas for years. Shame on you, "mmmdessert" for reviewing a recipe without ever making it!!

Very Good! The only thing I do differently is use 1/2 cup of sugar and double the almond extract (I find that I lose some of the almond flavor during baking). Oh, and I always need more than 2 tbsp. of sesame seeds for rolling the dough balls in. I make these every year for Christmas and everyone absolutely LOVES them! :)

this is an easy 1-bowl & eggless cookie recipe.  these are definitely crumbly (eat-over-the-sink) style cookies but they are very delicious.  if you like a strong almond taste then you might want to add a tiny bit more of extract.  i halved the recipe so i expected to yield 1.5 dozen cookies but ended up with only 10 cookies!!!  1 stick of butter for 10 cookies is scary...  after 12 minutes in the oven, they still looked a bit pale like the pictures but i took them out anyway.  may leave them in for a bit longer next time.

Incredible.  I added some fresh ground almond butter (about 1/4 cup), a couple tbsp of brown sugar and about 3 tbsp of flour to keep consistency...Wow.  I will make these when I care about impressing my audience for sure; they are both tasty and pretty.

usually I get annoyed with people who post the ole, "I didn't make this recipe, but..." reviews. I mean, why would you comment on something you haven't made? However, I found that after making these cookies,  mmmdesert's post was spot on. I will take all the suggestions provided next time I make these cookies.

Simple: ingredients, prep, time, and end product.  I made half the recipe and substituted vanilla for lack of almond extract.  Vanilla was good, but I'll try the almond next time. The walnut size balls only produced 9 cookies with a half recipe, but they should have been half that size.  I used softened butter in the summer time and the dough was soft.  Next time I'm going to chill the dough before forming.

Not that great.I added an egg and the dough was still crumbly. Also, even with the jam the cookies were not very sweet. Finally, I did not like the texture from the sesame seeds, they do not belong in this recipe.

I made this and it was easy and good.  I used cherry preserves and lemon curd and they were delicious.  My jewelry making club enjoyed them immensely!
