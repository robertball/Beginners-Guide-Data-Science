The fennel adds such a nice flavor to the soup.    For enhanced flavor, heat 2 tbs olive then saute onions, garlic, fennel and 2 more items not in recipe - 2 carrots chopped small and basil until veggies are translucent then add spinach, tomatoes and broth.   I only cooked 1 hour then for the last 15 mins I added frozen tortellinis.    When serving the soup, I add fresh ground pepper and crushed red pepper.  My daughter likes parmesan cheese with it too.

I followed the recipe exactly, it was very quick and easy to make.   I had never cooked with a fennel bulb previously, I'm glad I tried it, the flavor is mild but wonderful. This dish freezes perfectly.

A very good soup! Easy and inexpensive to make and tastes great.  My first impression was that it would be better as a side than as a meal, but then I found myself craving it for dinner and I've made it several times since then.  It also works really well with garbanzo beans instead of the white kidney beans.

I modified this a little but it was very good. I sauteed the fennel, onion, added carrot, and garlic in butter until a little caramelized then added chicken broth, two cans of drained white beans, one can of diced tomatoes and let simmer. I cooked a roll of Italian sausage and added some extra fennel seeds and some red pepper flakes, draining and adding to the soup. Didn't add the spinach but will next time. This was very good - and I will probably add some cream at the end next time to make it a little more "Tuscan."

Good soup.  I really couldn't taste the fennel, though - didn't want a strong anise flavor, but I was hoping for just a tad more.  Couldn't "recognize" the fennel.

I don't know why exactly we didn't enjoy this soup. We like fennel, we like broth soups, we like all the ingredients in this recipe. The aroma from the slow cooker was divine and my mouth watered in anticipation. But it didn't work for us, and we didn't even finish our bowls.

Loved this soup.  I followed a suggestion and sauted the fennel, onion and garlic in 2 T olive oil and then added the rest to the pot to simmer for an hour.  During the last 15 min. I added a little water and some dried cheese ravioli.  Yummy!  Also a dash of cayenne pepper.

We really liked this as a light starter for a meal.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetarian, because that is what I had on hand.

pretty good recipe. this was the first time i cooked with fennel and i have to say i like it a lot. in the end i added sliced vegetarian hotdogs to the mix to add a different texture. i can also imagine it would be good with potatoes. i will make it again. it is a keeper.

I didn't have any fennel, but I had all the other ingredients so I made this soup as prescribed but added some dried rosemary. I did pre-saute the onion and garlic as one reviewer suggested, and we grated some parmesan on top at serving time. Everyone loved it!

Super easy.  Very, very good.  We made ours with a chopped yellow sweet potato, which added a nice flavor.  Kids loved it also.

The spinach totally overpowered everything else in this soup for me, and I would have liked more beans. I think I'll try it again down the road with about half the spinach and twice the beans. It had potential; definitely smelled great - just TOO MUCH SPINACH!

Delicious, hearty, easy, and flavor is not overly strong...this will likely become a staple in our household.
