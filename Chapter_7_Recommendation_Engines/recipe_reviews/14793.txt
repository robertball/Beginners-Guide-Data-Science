I really enjoyed these Ham buns, they were easy to make. My family liked them a lot too! They came in great use for my daughters swim practice, sons baseball practice and husbands fishing. I wanted to thank you for a great recipe.

These are great! Good cold or hot. You can also use Spam instead of ham. Easy to cut down on the amount for a quick lunch-can leave out the olives and onion and add sweet relish or whatever you like.

5* with modifications.  I was surprised to see this recipe on here because I thought it was something only our family ate.  I call it "Mock Muffalatta;" my husband and his family call it "the things with the stuff."  It is a huge favorite in our family, but we make it slightly different.  We use 1/2 cup stuffed green olives instead of the black olives, and we add 1/2 cup chili sauce or cocktail sauce to the mixture.  We also use colby cheese instead of the processed cheese.  They're great to keep in the freezer, and when you get surprise guests, they're ready in 20 min.

Bland, a gooey mess, even my kids only ate one bite.  Both my husband and I felt it not worth making again.

It was easy and wonderful!  I made it like the recipe but I didn't add the eggs.   I'm a farmers wife and this was something easy to make and take out to the field.  I served with pickles.  
Will definitely make again!!

Very good! I cut the recipe down and used some mini Hawaiian sweet rolls that I had to use up, which I think was a nice switch-up. I did not add the additional salt, as it was not needed. This was very easy to make and a nice change from just a plain ol' ham sandwich. I will be making these again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)
