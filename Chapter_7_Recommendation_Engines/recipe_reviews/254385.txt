Needed something to use up first Picked summer squashes.
Made pretty much as directed, except didnt have shallot, used yellow onion instead.  No cornmeal in house so did without.
Tastes great, added little extra ritz cracker and cheese.
Yes, will make again, he loved it too

Very good!! I did change a few things to use items I already had on hand. I doubled the cheese and did not have the blend so I used 1/2cup of mozzarella and 1/2 cup of cheddar.  I used ritz seasoned crumbs, didn't have the crackers. I used all yellow squash and instead of the shallot I used a yellow onion. I also added crumbs on the top for an extra crunch. It was delish!! Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I layered the squash, onions, green pepper and mushrooms (sautéed in olive oil) with turkey pepperoni, adding Italian shredded cheese with a coating of crumbled Ritz crackers. No milk. Baked for 20 min. plus 2 min. on Broil. Tasty.

delish! an absolute do-over. i just think you don't have to cook the zucchini on the stovetop for a full ten minutes if you prefer them more crisp.

8.9.18  Nice side dish that I think would be good with other cheeses, as well (swiss, cheddar, gruyere, Monterey, etc.).  I did use the Mexican blend today, and I will say that’s a very subtle flavor in this gratin. Using a mandolin, this was a snap to make, and I will add some of those buttery crackers to the top of the gratin next time.  Really good way to use up some of that abundance of summer squash.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
