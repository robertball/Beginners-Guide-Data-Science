I cut back on the amount of milk after reading the reviews.  I also didn't add the additional cheese the last 10 minutes of baking.  I felt there was enough cheese with the sauce.  This was wonderful! I will be making this again.

In another recipe book, there is a white sauce/cheese recipe that calls for at most 1/2 this quantity of milk.  This dish ended up being very watery, and we had to add two times the amount of cheese to even begin to make the dish respectable.  I would definitely stick with the other recipe that I have in the future.

This was a big success!  I didn't actually measure anything. We were out of Cayenne Pepper so I used Paprika.  I also added about a cup of diced, cooked left-over chicken.  I used Extra Aged White Cheddar Cheese. I also sprinkled some bread crumbs and Parmesan Cheese over the top, and only baked it for about 30 minutes. A DEFINITE keeper!

This cheese sauce mixes up much better in the microwave than on the stove and be sure to use old cheddar for maximum flavour.  Amount of milk you add determines how thin or thick your sauce is and skim mixes just as well as cream or homo milk.  Melt the butter then wisk in the flour and add milk.  Cook on high for about 3-4 minutes, stirring every minute.  Add the cheese and heat again for 1-2 minutes until the cheese melts into the white sauce.  No lumps!!

I'd say, use less milk!  I ended up using about 3/4 cup.  I also added red pepper and yellow pepper and I steamed all four veggies together (more nutritious than boiling).  I used salt, pepper and LOTS of Italian seasoning to season the dish.  I cut up two chicken breasts and mixed together all the veggies, the chicken and the cheese sauce altogether.  Then, I  layered sliced tomatoes on top and sprinkled it with cheese.  A main dish for us.  YUMMY!

I used 1 1/2cup of milk  and just used broccoli. It was great, I loved the thick cheesy sauce. You can also just use regular mustard.

I have made this several times now.  Always taking it to a party.  I have been asked for the 5th time to bring it to Christmas dinner at my neighbors.  I think THE SECRET IS that I make it with Parmesan cheese and I crushed up Stove Top chicken stuffing in my blender for the topping. I also used 14 oz can chicken broth replacing some of the milk.  I did not add as much milk I stirred it in as needed for the proper thickness allowing for it to thicken during baking. I put the vegetables in rows so if someone does not like one or the other they can pick around it. I did not add the cayenne or the mustard but I may try it in a smaller batch before I serve it to anyone else. HUGE hit. Every response is that it is a nice change up from the old green been casserole standby

Sauce was very watery, but the flavor is good.  Next time I might add some stuffing mix or cornbread mix to absorb the water.

This is great.  I would add more vegetables because it seems like a lot of sauce for not a lot of veggies.  But it tastes wonderful!

I thought this was fine.  I used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk, which took care of the thinness issue, and upped the cayenne (3/4 tsp).  Overall I thought the combination was nice and spicy.  However, I'm not usually a big fan of vegetables smothered in cheese (I just happened to have the ingredients this time), so I doubt I'll be making this or a similar dish again.

The sauce was not as thick as expected-was good but would somehow like it thicker and less watery. My own made up version is better!

Not my fav.  First of all, this required too much toying around with the sauce to get it to the proper consistency – thanks to previous reviewers for the head’s up on that.  Second, it didn’t make sense to me to cook the broccoli and cauliflower, and then bake it for another 30 minutes?  I found it best to just cook the vegetables until crisp-tender, and then pour the sauce over them just before serving, skipping the baking step. It was ok and edible, but not what I had envisioned to begin with.  To be honest, I much prefer our occasional indulgence of broccoli and/or cauliflower topped with a cheese sauce made of some nuked Velveeta and a little milk.

I read through the reviews before I made this and I'm glad I did. I used a little over half of the milk called for in this recipe. I agree with other reviewers that if I hadn't cut back on the milk, it would have been a a really thin cheese sauce. I think when I make this next time, I'll skip the baking step. It seems unnecessary and it really makes for overcooked vegetables. The kids loved it, but my husband and I didn't care for mushy vegetables.

This recipe is excellent!  Only thing is you have to do is adjust the amount of milk as it is too watery as is.  I used about half of what was called for.  My b/f who loves cheese over veggies can't get enough.  Good recipe for people who don't like veggies to get a good filling!

Like this recipe a lot.  Only thing I do differently is to microwave the cauliflower and broccoli until not quite done, then proceed with the remaining instructions.  I found the cauliflower and broccoli to be a bit mushy when boiled.  Great way to get 'good for you' veggies.

i am forever trying to work new vegetables in to our meals, and this recipe did the trick for cauliflower! the sauce was perfect with the modifications suggested by other reviews (~1/2C less milk). i didn't have any english mustard, and the outcome didn't seem to suffer. i will definitely be making this again, maybe trying it with other veggies as well.

The ratio of fat to flour to liquid is off in this recipe. Find yourself a good white sauce recipe and than just add your own cheese to taste. Then you can add any kind of veggies you like to it.

The sauce on this was a little thin, but that was ok as it was a nice sauce for drizzling on the steamed brown basmati rice we served it over.  I used all broccoli.  Didn't have the hot English mustard powder, so just used regular ground mustard powder instead and made up the heat with 1/4tsp of cayenne pepper; this was just right for us.  I did add quite a bit more cheese than the recipe indicates; did a mix of colby-jack, havarti, & parmesan to use up what I had on-hand.  Broiled it at the end to get the cheese topping brown & bubbly.  We both liked it a lot!  Thanks, Rachael.

Great recipe, does need less milk I think. I added one cup, which was superb. Also, seemed to need more vegetables. I'd probably almost doubt the vegetable next time, as they were really swimming in the sauce.

I loved this dish. It was wonderfull and easy to make. I followed some of the recommendations from other reviewers; I only added 1 3/4 cups of milk, additional seasoning - Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder. I did not have cayenne pepper so I subsituted paprika instead. I had this dish over some pasta and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I gave it 4 stars because I did need to add seasoning.

As written it is 1 star but reduce the milk by 1 cup and use extra old cheddar it is 4 stars.  I accidently added to much red pepper and it was very spicy but no one complained.

This is the best broccoli and cheese recipe that I've ever had!  I did use this recipe for broccoli alone, and used only one cup of milk, no mustard or cayenne, and it was absolutely delicious!

Thank goodness!!  A broccoli casserole recipe that didn't cheat with canned soup or imitation cheese!   This was quite good; I honestly didn't measure the flour/butter/milk to make the basic sauce, as I've always made my mac&cheese that way.   I did follow the rest of the recipe as written, except I crumbled some butter crackers over the top of the casserole before baking.   It turned out very well; in fact one guest who is an admitted cauliflower-hater took seconds.   That's quite a success.

The vegetables are pretty much done after 10 min. of steaming, so another 30 min at 425 and they are mush.  I skip the entire oven part and just basically have the veggies with cheese sauce, which is very tasty btw.

I'm not a huge fan of cheese sauce over my veggies, but my husband is, so I tried this.  We were both very disappointed.  I steamed the vegetables for 3 minutes and they were still overcooked and almost tasteless.  And the sauce was very watery.  It is the same way I make sauce for macaroni and cheese, so my guess is that the vegetables release water as they bake and dilute the sauce.  Will definitely not make this again.

This calls for you to cook the veggies so long that they have no taste left when it's all said and done. If I ever tried this recipe again, I would either par-boil the veggies for maybe two to three minutes, or I would steam them for about 5 before baking for about 15-20 minutes.  As it is, they tasted like mush.

Comfort food at it's cheesiest. We substituted rice milk for dairy milk and cut the amount by half based on other reviews. I used only broccoli and it was awesome! I cut the recipe down to 3 servings and 20minutes sufficed for cook time.

I made this for our Christmas dinner. only changes I made were: I added 2 cups baby carrots and steamed them, then I steamed the broccoli and cauliflour together.  I took a stab that "english" mustard was some sort of a brown/grainy mustard.  Everyone ate it up and went back for seconds.  I will make again.

This was good.  Even though my cheese on top looked so good, as I dug in the casserole, it was SO watery!  Everything was just soggy and kind of unnapealling to look at.

Cut down to 1 1/2 cups as milk as per other reviewers.  Had a LOT of Velveeta loaf to use so put that in the sauce and sprinkled the shredded cheddar on the top for the last 10 minutes along with a dusting of fine bread crumbs with herbs.  Superb!

My husband and I really enjoyed this easy weeknight recipe. This is a great way to get in your veggies, and making your own sauce is much healthier than a can of cream-based soup. I added bite-sized, sauteed chicken for a complete meal. Will make again for sure!

Nice side dish! We used cream of mushroom soup and substituted Romano for the cheddar.    Also added some paprika, parsley and garlic powder to the mix.  Everyone loved it at our Easter lunch.  Thanks for the idea.

This has to much liquid.  Husband commented he thought it was soup.  I also thought it was very bland and the veggies were overcooked if following directions.  Sorry but I won't be making this again.

This makes a decent enough side dish.  The sauce is too thin and only 1/2 the amount is needed.  If making it again, I would blanch the vegetables because cooking them another 30 minutes made them too mushy for our taste.

I gave this a 5 because it got my 2 year old daughter to eat broccoli, which is a difficult task.  It was her first time with cauliflower.

I only made this because I had left over veggies from a tray from our superbowl party and it was great.  I used about 1 1/2 cups milk, used crushed red pepper instead of the cayenne, I had English mustard so I did use that, I added a dash of nutmeg, a little california onion powder, and sprinkled buttered crackers on teh top along with teh extra cheese.  Delicious, will be making thsi again just to get my husband and daughter to eat their veggies!

I used half the milk as suggested, but ended up adding more.  The sauce got thick very quickly. I don't know what everyone else was doing.  Good taste, but a little bland.  I also sprinkled bread crumbs on top.  As someone else had said, it does not need to be in the oven for more then 10-15 minutes.  Will make again.

Incredible!!  I steamed the veggies, used evaporated milk (as I don't usually buy regular so I didn't have).  Couldn't find my cayenne pepper so I grabbed my cajun seasoning (again).  And as I don't "measure" my ingredients and I ADORE cheese, I'm sure I used MORE than the recipe called for.  Can't go wrong with cheese!!  Yummy!

Very good. I use 3/4 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cups milk to make it thicker. I also use all broccili and no cauliflower because my husband hates cauliflower. We make regularly. Awesome flavor. Regular mustard works well for us, we haven't been able to find "English" mustard anywhere.

I read to use less milk, which I did.  My sauce turned out wonderful.  I didn't have English Mustard, so I used regular mustard.  This is a winner!  I will use again.  Thanks for something different and quick.

I did add a whole Portobello mushroom and an ear of corn. Also instead of using all of the cheddar cheese I cut the amount in half and used laughing cow white cheddar cheese; less fat and went great with the cayenne pepper! Love this recipe will be making it again!

Definitely cut the milk back to 1 1/2 cups! I could see right away the milk amount was too high for this recipe, so I used 1 1/2 cups and had a lovely, delicious casserole.

I doubled the cauliflower and did not use the broccoli because I already had a green vegetable for the table.  The sauce was terrific.  I used Coleman's English Mustard.

I did not like this recipe. Mine had no taste except when you got some of the cheese that was sprinkled on top. It was mushy and runny. I like my veggies crisper I guess. Will not be making this again.

Followed other reviews and reduced milk to 1 1/2 cups and cooked the broc/caul in the microwave for 5 minutes.  I added sliced smoked sausage and panko crumbs and olive oil to the cheese before sprinkling on top.  Pretty good recipe - ONLY IF you reduce the milk.  I would also be careful about the cooking the veg too well before - mine was just on the edge of mushy and I cut them in pretty big chunks.  Even with 1 head of broccoli and 1 head of cauliflower and the added sausage, there was still lots of extra sauce.  Next time I may add some cooked macaroni for a one-dish meal. I definitely recommend adding panko to the cheese on top - makes a nice, crispy crust.  Will make again.

Very tasty. Just a little salty, but not sure how to judge salt and pepper to taste before the cheese is added

I have made this many times now at Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners. It's a huge hit! As per other reviews, use less milk.

Great recipe when you want to eat your veggies, but also feel like some cheese.  When I want a healthier dish, I use veg broth instead of milk and I use maybe 1/2 to 1 cup and I use only 8 oz cheese total forgoing the cheese at the end.  It is still great and cuts down on the fat and calorie content without losing flavor.

I followed recipe exactly and the cheese sauce wasn't that good. Not sure what happened with it. If I try again maybe I will try some other suggestions.

I made this as a side a couple of days ago and my husband is already asking for it again.  I did reduce the amt of liquid by a half a cup and it turned out perfectly.

(Admissions: I increased the servings to 24 for Thanksgiving and either some of the ingredient amounts were wrong or I did not let the butter, flour and milk mixture thicken enough)

I followed the recipe exactly (or so I thought) but when I pulled it out of the oven, the cream was not thick enough so I had to add more rice and cook longer to suck up the extra liqud. 

When I pulled it out the second time, it was perfect. My son was greateful it was not done in time for Thanksgiving so we could have it all for ourselves.

I'm sure when I make it again, for the correct amount of servings, I will not have a problem, and, like I said, the flavor was phenomenal. 

So.... if You have a problem where it is too liquidy, just add rice and pop it back in the oven for 30 minutes or so.

Brilliant bake recipe, I have made it twice now and hubby cant stop eating it!! I make it with whatever veggies I have in the fridge and bake it until the sauce is bubbly and brown on top and it tastes fantastic. Thanks so much for sharing!

Good recipe. I was heading out of town so I needed to use up the veggies in my fridge.  I added leftover chicken diced up and a red pepper diced too.  I also added some herbes de provence to the sauce and made the whole thing into a dinner casserole.  I also topped with some breadcrumbs.  My kids loved it.  I will be making this recipe again soon.

This is an awesome recipe - I steamed the brcccoli, cauliflower, onion and 1 large russet potato in a steamer for 20 min.  Then, I added all the sauce ingredients plus a can of cream of chicken soup and baked for 30 min.  Excellent!

Great Side dish! I cut the milk down a bit on this recipe. After the initial cooking period I added the cheese to the top and broiled untill bubbly and brown. Will make again.

My recipe wasn't runny. It's all about continuing to stir the pot until the sauce thickens enough. It was delicious, yes, full of calories, but everyone enjoyed their veggies. I made it only with broccoli as I didn't have coliflower handy.

Just got done aking this side dish. I looked at the user reviews and decided to kinda do it my way. I used 1 cup of 2% milk, sharp chedder, and regular mustard. Instead of cayenne pepper I used regular pepper as well. I made this as a last minute dont know what else to make with veggies. So far so good. Seems great. Sauce is perfect thickness, not runny at all. Great and easy dish. Not sure whats up with the negative reviews cause this tastes pretty well. Thanks!!

this was pretty good. the sauce will be good and thick if you follow the cooking instructions closely and I did cut the milk, but I still used 2 cups. You dont want it to boil, but you do want it to be bubbling quit a bit while you whisk it.  I see why see calls for less veggies, I think the flavor would of the sauce would be more, I used a small bag of each and I probably could of used 1/2 of each like she called for, but it was still good. the reason I only gave a three was the time it took for the sauce and the sauce didnt really wow me.

This dish was excellent and easy to make.  I added a bit of tumeric to the sauce.  I forgot to save the cheese for the top and put it all in the sauce, but it turned out fine.  I will repeat this.

This was delicious - I added a few things though - doubled the cauliflower and broccoli, doubled the mustard, added 2.5 cups of cooked rice, a can of Cream of Celery soup and some chopped onion.  We enjoyed it very much and ate it as the main meal, it was so hearty.

My family loved this. What a great way to make sure your kids finish all their broc & cauliflower! I never measure ingredients, just made the basic sauce with butter, flour and milk and added cheddar, a pinch of regular powdered mustard and some S&P and sprinkled parmesean on top for some extra crusty goodness. Awesome!

This was the first time I had made a cheese sauce. I was really nervous, I always seem to have bad luck with trying to thicken sauces. This was incredible! What an awesome recipe! I didn't use mustard because I didn't have any. I had to use marble cheese, because that's all I had. Next time I'd use a sharper cheese, just because my own personal taste likes a strong cheese flavour. This will definitely be part of Christmas dinner!

This was really good. I did not have all the ingredients on hand, so I had to make a few changes....I think with the changes that I made is what ended up saving this recipe in the end. I used evaporated milk, and then added a little chicken broth as the evaporated milk made it pretty thick.

Made this for Thanksgiving for something different.  It was fantastic.  My favorite thing served that day.  I did not add cheese on top.  Instead I crushed some garlic flavored Ritz crackers for a topping before baking.  Yum

My husband really enjoyed this dish, my 3 year old son..not so much but he's super picky so not sure if he counts! I did as some other reviewers said and used less milk; only 2 cups. The sauce was a perfect thickness.  I also used regular mustard, smoked paprika and a dash of nutmeg which gave it a really nice touch. I sprinkled about a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs on the top with the cheese and I used a whole cauliflower in mine. It was really delicious! Will make again. Reminds me of my Dad's cooking ;)

After reading the reviews I opted to use less milk, and no seasoning except for a little bit of salt, and more cauliflower and broccoli to make this dish.  It was a great hit, everyone liked it, including my toddler! Win Win!

If  you use 12oz of broccoli and 12 oz of cauliflower, the sauce is perfect, no need to use less milk. Needs more salt and pepper if you use this ratio vege to sauce.

Vary delicious. But I used 1 1/4 cups of milk instead because it was vary liquids and when I took it out to ad the rest of the cheese I also put back on first. It was a hit in my family and I will defently make it again.

I steamed the veggies first but kept them still crunchy. Then I added chopped onion, celery and almonds for more crunch. I crushed Italian croutons for the topping, not cracker crumbs.

I didn't read reviews prior to making it and was surprised at how few veggies were needed and how much liquid/cheese sauce. I doubled the veggies and fit it all in a nice dish. It worked out. Added a lot more spice as well as I think this dish would be bland without. Obviously a comfort food like mac&cheese and a nice quick dish.

Made once for the family dinner, and I did not manage to even get a bite , so I rated the recipe zero stars. Well  the family all rated it five :-) , so I made the casserole again and this is a hit, for me and the family.  This worked perfectly for me and I have no water problems .  Thanks for this recipe , novice cook that I am and all.

I used only  half the milk but it was still soupy, I also used twice as much cauliflower (a whole head and about 6oz broccoli) I'd say  if I were to make it again I'd make it really thick like Velveeta thick. Then bake it. Hm.

I loved this recipe, However, I used way less milk and cheese. Added some broccoli and sprinkled the top with panko bread crumbs. The mustard gives it a nice flavor, and I also used paprika instead of cayenne..

Hmm.  Neither bf nor I liked it.  I'm guessing bf didn't like the mustard in the sauce.  Sometimes I can get away with putting it in stuff, sometimes I can't.  I didn't like it either, though, and I love mustard.  I'm definitely glad I only used 1 cup of milk in this; it would have been way too soupy otherwise.  However, that could have made the sauce too strong for us . . .not really sure what our problem with this is, really.  Looks like we'll have to find another recipe for a broccoli cheese combo.  I didn't use cauliflower because I didn't have any, so I just used all broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe but was definitely easier when I took the advice of another reviewer and made the sauce in the microwave. I also started with half the milk and then added more to my liking as it thickened up.

The children and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  Husband was so-so but then again he's not a big fan of creamy-type foods.  After reading some of the reviews, I eyeballed most of my measurements and just kept an eye on consistency/thickness while making the cheese sauce.  It came out just fine.  Will definitely make again without hesitation.  Thanks for the submission.

Hmmm. I love broccoli and cauliflower with cheese. There was something off here though.  Not sure if it was the mustard?  Maybe it's just me because I've made cheese sauces with dijon before and liked it.  Never with "English mustard" though.  If I do try it again I'll probably omit the mustard.

Not bad but very watery. Next time I will use less milk, I also cooked it with the lid on so maybe if the lid was off it would be thicker. The potential is there so I will try it again!

I added slightly less milk and also continued to stir/simmer sauce until it thickened.  Be patient because not stirring long enough will cause it to be runny. I also added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder to the sauce mixture.  For cheese I only had a shredded mexican blend which added great flavor!

Nothing fabulous, but very good. About what I expected, and I will make again.

Great recipe. I added some garlic powder and thyme to the sauce...and also some parmesean and provolone cheeses. the mustard gives it a good flavor. i also decided to add chopped cooked chicken breast to the pan before baking for a one dish meal. turned out great, i might make more sauce next time. thanks!

This was easy and excellent.  I added some bread crumbs to the top and a few extra spices to the sauce.  It was so good.

This was a pretty tasty side dish. I'd suggest starting with 1 cup of milk and then gradually adding more to get the desired consistency for the sauce. I used about 1 1/2 cups. I also used fresh broccoli and cauliflower, although next time I will probably use frozen as I don't think it would have much of an effect on the final taste of the dish.

I used this recipe for a qaunity of 4 servings - based on the other reviews I reduced the milk to 3/4 of a cup & also replaced the English Mustard with Creole Mustard - C'est Bon!

we made this for thanksgiving and it was wonderful.  tho i did add some bread crumbs on top!!!

when making a roux it's hard to say exactly how much milk to add.  you basically have to add it bit by bit until you get the thickness you desire.  

we cooked it for the full time - the broccoli and cauliflower was perfect, as was the sauce!!!

I really like this recipe...anything with a cheese sauce is right up my alley.  I used whole milk, so the sauce was nice and thick.  I am going to double the recipe and make this for Thanksgiving!!!

This was good but I think the cooking time was way too long, considering you already boiled the veggies.  Mine came out soft and mushy.  Added some chopped red banana peppers from a friends garden instead of the cayenne pepper.  Will make again but cut down the cooking time to maybe 20 minutes

The sauce does not thicken well if you use fat free milk.  I tried adding more flour and that helped some, but I think I should have added even more because it was still pretty thin.

Excellent recipe it is in the oven cooking now. I added more flour to thicken it and added chicken slices and topped with fresh parmesan cheese. Next time I will try this over white potatoes....

I don't like cauliflower, but it was good in this case.  I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken, so the whole thing turned out pretty watery, but it still tasted good.  I will make this again and see if I get a different result the next time.

Agree with Karen-NOTHING to rave about. As I was making it I realized it was just the vegs with cheese poured over them. I mean nothing terrible or disgusting, but bland and flavorless. I will not be making again.

Not sure what the fuss is about. It's just cauliflower with bread crumbs and grated cheese, and not enough cheese.  I ate it, but wouldn't make again.

Very good. I prefer just broccoli, but including the cauliflower (1/2 head) was okay too.  I used cornstarch instead of flour, 2% milk, 2/3 c. cheese, 1tsp paprika,  4 pinches of chili powder, and 1/4 tsp salt.

This was very good, but I did change around the proportions a lot. I used nearly three times the amount of vegetables(32 ounces) and half the cheese sauce. I thickened the cheese sauce with cornstarch instead of flour just because I like to work with cornstarch more as a thickening agent. I used a reduced fat mexican cheese and instead of starting the sauce with butter, I added butter buds seasoning to the sauce. It tasted very good and will be made again with my modifications.
