This is a light and fluffy macaroon recipe.  This cookie would make a nice addition to a holiday cookie tray!  I followed the recipe exactly. I  baked for 9 minutes and the cookies were a nice golden brown on the bottom but a little sticky on top.  Other than that - no complaints!  Thanks for sharing!

Proportions of egg whites to coconut was WAY off.  I added several more egg whites, which eventually did not help. You take a bite and end up with your mouth full of coconut shreds and there is no airy-ness to it at all.
