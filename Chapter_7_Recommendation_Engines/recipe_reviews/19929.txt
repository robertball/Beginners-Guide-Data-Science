This is an absolutely incredible dish. I almost skipped the stuffing, but am so glad that I didn't. It really added to the flavor and interest. I did reduce the amount of arugula by half, though, and had plenty. It was a big hit  with our family. My 11 year old son asked if we could have this swordfish every night. Even my 7 year old cleaned his plate. And as a bonus, it was surprisingly easy to make. We will definitely have this again.

Very, very good!  The swordfish was rather thick, so I had to increase the cooking time about 5 additional minutes per side.  I highly recommend this delicious recipe!

This is absolutely delicious! I used baby spinach instead of arugula, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.
The sauce was a little too salty, so I will use low sodium soy next time.

WOW! This recipe was delicious! The marinade is spectacular and the arugula and tomato mixture add the finishing touch to this fantastic dish.  If you want a palatable sensation then this is for you!

A nice recipe that was enjoyed by everyone at a recent bar-b-que. Due to the high mercury content in swordfish I decided to use cod instead. I also added some toasted sesame seeds to the marinade. Thanks so much Judith!

Wow!  An impression maker is right!  Swordfish is rather expensive but I certainly justified the purchase when I made this dish!  The only change I made was to substitute Baby Spinach for Arugala and leave out the oil in the stuffing.  I felt these changes had added health benefits and they certainly did not take away from this dish.  Delicious!  Thanks Judith.

Very good.  Made this as part of a "surf & turf".  Many people liked the sauce on their steak just as much as on the Swordfish.

Delicious and sooooo savory!  Marinated for both swordfish and mahi-mahi for about 3 hours.  Added 2 tablespoons of honey to balance the tartness of the lemon.  Would definitely use this recipe again!

If you were served this dish in a fine dining restaurant, you would go home talking about it!   It is so elegant, completely delicious, and strikingly different.  Way above average!   I think you can "play" with the stuffing, i.e. spinach, artichoke hearts, a little sharp cheese.   We "plated" the fish over the leftover arugala mixture with some Maui onion dressing -- nothing eles needed for a wonderful, colorful healthy dinner!

Wonderful recipe.  Used fresh baby spinach and it worked out great.  Served with herbed rice w/almonds and prosciutto wrapped asparagus. Elegant dinner that is very impressive and delicious.

This was fantastic!  The only thing I changed was to mix honey in with the greens instead of lemon juice - that added a nice little sweet taste.  I used the marinade on some chicken breasts as well since not everyone will eat seafood and that turned out pretty tasty too!

Absolutely fantastic and out of the ordinary recipe for swordfish! Don't skip stuffing! --it adds greatly to the flavor & uniqueness. Also, I used left over stuffing (arugula, etc.) by placing it directly on the serving plate and placing the cooked fish on top, dribbling sauce over all!

Fish is definitely not a "fave" of mine.  My husband used this recipe without stuffing it.  The marinade reduced and then used as sauce was muy magnific!!! I am now a swordfish fan.

This is an exceptional recipe.  I prepared it using 4 swordfish steaks cut about 1 1/2 - 
1 3/4" thick (combined weight was 2.3 pounds; the butcher inserted the slit for me.  The only change that I would suggest is in the amount of arugula--4 cups of chopped arugula was too much; 2 cups would be adequate.  The sauce made and served according to directions was fabulous.  Due to the thickness of the fish that I chose, I grilled each side for 6 minutes.   The results were perfect.  Thank you!

this was fantastic!  I combined with another recipe only in that, for the stuffing, I sauteed 1 clove of garlic in olive oil and added in the spinach to wilt it first.  I also added in artichoke hearts and feta cheese.  So it was less "stuffed" and more "exploding" out the sides :)  But it was delicious and the reduced sauce on top was perfect!

Awesome!!! I made this last night for me and my boyfriend. He said that is was one of the BEST things I ever made for us. I agree that is was so delicious. The marinade is perfect and so easy to throw together. I have an instant marinator that marinates anything in 20 minutes. But I left it in for about 3 hours. So I agree that the longer you marinate that more flavor you will get. And I broiled in for 6 1/2 minutes on each side. Served it with rice and it was a great healthy dinner. It has already been requested to make this again.

I don't like seafood, but my husband and family do. I tried this recipe based on the ratings for my husband and his parents since it's his favorite fish. Everyone absolutely LOVED it. The second time I made it, I used my oven broiler because it was winter. I also couldn't find arugala so I used watercress...the family reviews were just the same. Highly recommend for seafood lovers!

This was great!  I didn't have arugula, so used spinach instead. Good flavor, nice and moist, nice presentation.

I wish I could give this recipe more than five stars!  I used spinach for the stuffing as others suggested, and it tasted great.  This was simple and the result was amazing!  My children even enjoyed the taste of this fish-sooooo good!

This was my first time using ginger - very tasty! I substituted spinach for the stuffing and it was delicious.  I made a reduction of the leftover marinade and spooned that over the fish as it cooked on the grill to keep it moist. Will make this one again.

This was one of those 50/50 recipes in our household.  Half the family liked it.  The other half hated it.  I prepared it, and I was one of those who didn't care for the final product.  Fish was too soggy and soft for my tastes.

Not enthused by the marinade. A bit too "tangy" for our taste. We totally love arugula - which is why I tried this recipe, but was total overkill on the marinade and the stuffing. =( Don't know what I might have missed on either..

Makes a wonderful presentation and is very easy! As others have stated this is a great recipe for serving to guests. I followed the recipe exactly and will make again with a few changes for my taste. I will reduce the lemon as the flavor was a bit strong. I will season the fish with salt and pepper before placing on grill to add another layer of flavor. Both my husband and I enjoyed.

This was completely inedible.  I took one bite and spit it out (something I have never done!)  I followed the directions exactly- the dish was WAY too salty and sour, and in combination with the fish flavor it was more than I could stomach.

This fabulous recipe was never purported to be gluten free????  A previous reviewer indicated that she had a problem with the fact that it was not gluten free.  I would think that people looking for gluten free recipes would search under that specific category.

The sauce was a little salty on my initial attempt so the second time I tried it with low sodium soy, and it was perfect.  Delicious.

I would give this a 3.5 stars if I could because my husband liked it a little more than myself.  It is an easy recipe and quick to make, but it definitely lacks flavor and character.  If you are looking for a bland healthy meal, this would cut it but there are just so many better recipes out there than this one.

Good recipe!  My only complaint is that the amount of lemon juice, especially combined with the tomato in the stuffing, makes the dish really acidic.  Next time I'll cut back on the lemon juice in the marinade and maybe add some honey.  Overall, great recipe!

I made this with fresh tuna steaks on the Foreman grill. Husband liked it more than I did - I thought the marinade completely overwhelmed the arugula and tomato. If I were to make this again, I would use the marinade OR the stuffing, not both.

This was good, but I wasn't as crazy about it as everyone else.  However, it was a healthy, easy, unique, good recipe.  My husband liked it better than me.

I've made this recipe three times within two months.  I never got around to stuffing the swordfish.  But everyone loves this merinade and the fish comes out so moist.  Everytime I make any kind of fish, my husband asks if I made this sauce. It's best if you let it sit for 24 hours and pour some of the sauce on the fish while grilling it.

This was good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used spinach instead of arugula. Will add a bit of honey to the stuffing like other reviewers suggested next time.

Amazing recipe! Very flavorful. I added salt to the marinade and the arugula. I also added 2 tablespoons of honey to the marinade as was recommended in the comments. It does need longer cook time though, at least 10-15 mins on each side to cook through and through.

Incredible marinade for any kind of white fish!  I prepared orange roughy instead of the swordfish and it was amazing, the longer you let the marinade sit the more tender the fish.  I also chose spinach and baby corn over arugula and tomatoes and it was quite delicious.  This is now a staple in my cooking repertoire.

This was such a good recipe!!The sauce that you pour over this really added to an already exceptional dish.  This is something that looks like you spent hours preparing and it was so quick and easy and everyone just raved and raved about it...keep it for your special dinners and you won't go wrong!!!
