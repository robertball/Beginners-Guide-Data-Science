If you want it like the take out (or like my hometowns take out)...... Use Non-Dried Red Peppers, and make sure you cut em to get the seeds all in your sauce..... Also throw some of the juices from your peppers in everything.... Cut the sugar down a lot.. if you use as much as this recipe calls for you're gonna end up with a caramel mess...when it says thicken up (sauce)... I hear Wait for it to start getting bubbled but too much bubble= hard sugary caramel.. good for coating not so good for wet and saucy

This was not that good. I have used other recipes for general tso's which is my all time fav. Chinese dish. This one had to be the worst. My husband said it reminded him of cotton candy. The batter for the chicken wasn't much more then scrambled egg coated chicken.

This was really good. Very tasty. Not quite how the restaurants make it but that may have been an error on my part. I didn't have the dried chili peppers so I also used about 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes. I would have liked it a bit spicier so next time I may add another 1/4 tsp or so. As I crisped up the chicken in my wok I thought I would add the sauce straight to the chicken as it was finishing up. Bad idea! It was fine when it was hot but as it started cooling off it turned to the consistency of taffy. Very sticky on the teeth! Luckily I had only put a little bit of the sauce in there, otherwise it would have been ruined. Be sure to follow the directions and put the sauce on AFTER. I also like using the chicken thighs as opposed to breasts. I think breast meat would have easily overcooked, as you are basically cooking it twice.

This was very good.  I used crushed red pepper flakes instead of the chilies.  I was yummy!  Served over rice.

This recipe is better than I have ever had.  I substituted the Sherry for water, because we don't carry it here.  It was an awesome recipe and I have made it for friends several times already!

Not very much like any Chinese place around me.  The sauce, which I tried 3 times, always turns out very sticky and hardens when it is taken off the heat.  Way too much sugar.  Maybe cut it down or use corn starch like other recipes call for.  The chicken does turn out good though.  Right idea but not for the sauce.

I used fresh chili peppers. I kept the pepper out of the kids batch and the adults had peppers (that I split open) and some dry pepper flakes... sweet, spicy goodness!! I will make this once a week and so much more cheaper than take out and you can make it as crispy as you want it and as spicy as you like it!! Love it! My family loves it too!! I like that you can fry it in advance and then fry it a second time later because it is time consuming.

This was some really great chicken! I loved it! I used egg substitute in place of eggs, and only fried my chicken in just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan (less than 1/2 cup total). I used half the sugar called for, so the sauce didn't thicken as much, but I don't like things super sweet. After the chicken was done, I discarded all but a little bit of the oil, cooked the ginger and hot pepper flakes (IPO chilies) in the same pan, and just poured over the chicken, which was being kept warm. Served over rice with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. This was an easy quick dinner as good as you'd get in a Chinese restaurant.

Wow!  This was incredible!  We are saying goodbye to our favorite Chinese restaurant, because now we can make our favorite dish at home for MUCH less money!  Thank you SO much for the recipe!

Made exactly as written except used dried ginger in the sauce. This has great taste, I only wish my sauce turned out thicker and maybe a little spicier too.  Definitely going to make this again with maybe some slight changes.

Tried making this dish for the first time ever. It was extreamly easy to make and my family absolutely loved it. Think I will double it from now on.

AWESOME! Made the sauce only to compliment some leftover sesame chicken from the night before. Added some hoisin and garlic sauce with a hint of cornstarch to thicken. Dropped the leftover sesame chicken (previously deep fried) in the sauce, stir fried.....made a lovely glaze. Served with fried rice...AWESOME!

I use this as the base for my General Tsaos.  The ratio of vinegars, sherry and soy works very well.  For the love of god do not even think about putting as much sugar in as she does.  I use about 20% of the sugar (sweeten to taste) and then thicken it with cornstarch. The only other change I make is to put diced ginger in the sauce as well.

Overall, I liked the result, but the sauce was thin until we added more sugar and a some cornstarch to thicken it. The additional time let the flavors of the peppers, garlic and ginger brighten and strengthen, so that with an extra splash of soy sauce.  In the future, I'll change the order of preparation.  I'm thinking of simmering the vegetables in the soy, sherry, and vinegar while I'm frying the chicken, then add the sugar (double the recommended amount) as my final step.

This was awesome!!! I just finished cooking it and my family loved it!! I didn't use a lot of peppers but apparently they would have preferred if I used none at all.....next time I'll make sauce with and without peppers (I like them).  But I will definetly make this again.  No more chinese take out for me :-)

We loved this recipe!  Took a lot of dishes to make, but so worth it.  Used chicken breasts as that was all I had on hand.  And we used peppers from our garden.  The sweet and spicy flavors work well together.  Will definitely make again!

Ok, this was a confusing outcome for us.  If we were thinking of this as General Tsao's chicken, it did not rate that good. As a honey chicken or something, it was pretty good.  It is VERY sweet.  The General Tsao's we get at the local chinese place just has a hint of sweet, and lots of kick.  With this recipe, I personally thought it tastes like pancake syrup.  For some reason, my sauce would not thicken up at all.  I only used 6 dried peppers, but threw in some pepper flakes, and it was not spicy at all unless you happened to eat part of the chili.  I followed the execution to the letter.  Thanks, anyway.

Five stars for the sauce, 3 stars for the battered chicken. I didn't love the egg in the batter. The sauce was great, though a person could probably cut the sugar by 1/4 c. and be fine. I hate cornstarched, gummy sauces, so I like this version. If you like thicker sauce, of course you can add a little cornstarch, but I wouldn't overdo it.

this was so very good. I made this for my grandson's birthday dinner because he wanted chinese food but I couldn't afford to take 7 people out to dinner so I decided to try this. I was really surprised at how good it was.  It had way more flavor than me local restaurant has. I omitted the sherry and used chopped peppers and it was yummy. I would definitely make this again

This was DELICIOUS!  My whole family - including 2 young boys LOVED it!  I omitted the chilies and poured a little more than half of the sauce over the chicken in the pan at the end while frying up the chicken and it caramelized the sugar and was awesome!!

Way to much sugar.  The chicken was like eating a candy apple!!  The coating on the chicken turned out perfect... and the basic flavor was good... just too much sugar.

Pretty good.  We used red pepper flakes and and powdered ginger and it was yummy.  I think next time, we'll reduce the sauce to make it a little thicker and sweeter.

On a whim I decided to try this recipie. We were going to a party and I was asked to bring something a little spicy. The recipe is easy to follow, it's not hard to make... And honestly... the plate sat on the table for no more than five minutes and it was gone.  I made a few small changes as I've remade it again and again (I'm not allowed to being anything other than these now). I cube the chicken the night before and let it soak in some hot sauce. When I'm making it, I use the batter exactly as stated in the recipie.  And with the sauce? I almost double the chillies. Instead of using a wok and thickening the sauce, I just take the chicken, once it's all cooked and pour the sauce over it, tossing the chicken and the sauce in a bowl until it's well coated and then drain off the liquid keeping as many of the chilies as I can. Set it on a platter and away we go.  I've never seen an appetizer go quite as fast as these do.

This recipe was quick and easy to make. My husband loves it when I make this.  The only problem that I had was that it was not spicy enough.  I had to use quite a bit of red pepper flakes and even then it still lacked a little bit of the spice that most restaurant quality General Tso's  has.

This was Awesome!!  Genius!!  I made it to serve 3 and substitued the sherry for 2 T water, used 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes instead of red chilies and 1/8 tsp of ground ginger because I did not have any fresh on hand.  I ended up frying my coated chicken in a pan.  My only complaint was the sauce didn't thicken but my sauces never thicken.  The taste was amazing, just how I remembered it tasting at a restaraunt in Montreal.  Fabulous!!  Thanks Deb K!!

I thought this was good but I had some trouble with it.  I always make exactly according to the recipe before tweeking it a bit.  As is, the flavor was good - maybe a little too sweet and not enough spicy - but that is an easy fix.  I had trouble with the thickening of the sauce.  It didn't thicken at all.  No matter how long I cooked it it would not thicken until I added a cornstarch/water mixture to it.  But then I added too much of the mixture and it only tasted like cornstarch.  Not sure what I did wrong but I will definitely try it again and try to figure out how to get the sauce just right.

Wow. I did not expect this recipe to turn out this good. Perfect end result despite the fact I substituted bourbon for sherry, regular vinegar for rice vinegar, etc. Thanks!

This recipe is awesome. Only problem I had is the sauce did not thicken in said time, I kept going much longer, eventually added corn starch slurry to thicken before serving. still delicious!

Hubby and I devoured this in 5 minutes!! The sauce wasn't as thick as I thought it might be... I feel like next time I will make a thickener to make it stickier. I served it on a bowl of sticky rice. Despite how much sugar is in it, it wasn't as sweet as I thought it might be... I think the vinegar negates it a bit. I will definitely make this again - it was very easy to make!

First time making this dish and this recipe really nails it. Didn't have the red peppers so just threw in pepper flakes and it was just right. Sweet and spicy. Fried the chicken pieces twice and they came out slightly crunchy on the outside but tender on the inside. Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this!  I've tried making Chinese food before and the texture of the chicken and the sauce have always eluded me.  The chicken was tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside, and I enjoyed the sauce too.  I do agree with other reviewers that the sauce got very sticky and hard after cooling a little, so I might experiment with cornstarch next time.  I didn't have chilies or sherry, so I substituted crushed red pepper and used a smaller measurement of vanilla (as suggested on another site to substitute for sherry) and I thought the flavor was great.  The kids weren't stoked, but all they ever want to eat is macaroni and cheese.  I plan to make it again for friends next time around!

I would make this again. It was incredibly simple to make, and tasted very good.  I did not have a Wok, so I did not do the final step of cooking the chicken until it was crispy after deep frying it.  Still delicious.

I did not care for the sauce. The chicken however was good and crispy and the perfect texture. i added pea balls and served over white rice. Be prepared for the smell of the boiling vinager. It was so strong!

Bravo! Very tasty. Also try with a little orange juice & skip the sherry.
