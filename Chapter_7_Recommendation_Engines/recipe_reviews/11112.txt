I made twenty-five of these for Christmas gifts and after the first one I realized I needed to put ingredients in in a different order.  I put the flour mixture in first, then the brown sugar, packed it down really well, then the white sugar and finally the M&M chips.  It looked very nice and I was told by one of the recipients that they were the best cookie her family had ever had.

I made 14 of these for Christmas. I also layered the flour, soda and salt, then packed down the brown sugar, added the white sugar and topped it off with the candy. I put them in decorated glass jars, and tied the directions and a wooden spoon on with raffia. Everyone loved them. My brother just baked his up and ate half of them in one sitting!

When you stack the layers, the flour settles into all the other ingrediants.  It was horribly unattractive to give as a gift!

Like other users, I put the flour in first, then the brown sugar, white sugar and finally the M&M's.  It's a lovely gift to give at Christmas.

I received this recipe as a gift.  I made the cookies and they were delicious.  I would recommend this as a gift to anyone.  I will make them as gifts for Christmas this year.

I made these in a jar for my mother-in-law, and then made a sample recipe to see how they tasted. I used peanut M&M's to make sure the flour didn't seep through the top. Didn't work. 
The presentation is not cute. 
They tasted horrible. They had burnt bottoms and came out flat. It broke apart like dirt when bitten. I crushed some of the m&ms to be sure they fit in the cookie and left the rest whole. The outer shells of the peanut m&ms' were burnt crusty brown and you could taste the burnt 'toasted ' peanut in it's place.  The whole thing tasted like a burnt peanut butter cookie. Sorry Verushka, but I will not make these again.  I still however gave the cookie-in-a-jar gift to my mother in law.

This looks like a nice gift when layering the ingredients starting with the flour. I was told that a sealed jar would last about 6 months, but how do i seal it? I'd like to include shelflife on the labes. Thanks! =)

I mad 17 of these as teacher, instructor, and bus driver gifts for Christmas 2009.  I used old mason jars.  We got lots of compliments on them and many told us how good they were and what a fun gift it was.  I made 3 different kinds -- mini M&M's, Reese's Pieces, and mini chocolate=chips.  DEFINITELY follow the member-suggested advice with changing the placement order or they will not turn out nice.  As you can see by my submitted photo with a few jars, put the flour mixture first, then the brown sugar (packed), then the white sugar, then the candy.

This idea was fantastic! I made 12 jars total, 6 were for my friends who celebrated Hanukkah & the others were for the Xmas folks.  In the Hanukkah jars I used Chocolate Chips instead of M&Ms. I used fabric that had drediels on them to cover the lids & tied super cute ribbon around the lid with a recipe card.  For the Xmas jars I used red & green M&Ms & used a variety of different seasonal fabrics to cover the lids followed by a decorative bow & recipe card.  I would highly recommend this to any baking lover, as it really is a heart warming gift for the holiday. I feel as if this gift most represents me & when I share it with my family & friends it shows them really how much I love to cook & bake.  Plus, who can't resist cookies? Pictures to follow =)

These were quite tasty. Tested the recipe before giving. I don't get the disgusting and inedible comments. They were far from that. And you need to pack the flour first or it WILL settle, just as others have suggested. Thanks for sharing this one, it makes a very cute gift!

3/4 cup of butter was way too much, so not only did the presentation not work the cookies were unedible.

I'm happy I found this recipe online! I received a jar very similar to this one, but all white ingredients. It was VERY dry, so I added 2-3 TBSP of milk and they stuck together MUCH better. The one that I received also tastes a bit salty. Not sure if it's based off of this recipe or not, but next time around I may add a pinch more sugar and flour to offset the saltiness. Enjoy!

I found this was an amazingly simple recipe to assemble and even easier to execute. The trick is to take them out of the oven just as they begin to brown.  I test baked a couple of different variations as follows, my favorite is the 1st using 1/2 cups of each type of each ingredient:

1.Cranberries, milk chocolate chips, white chocolate. 
2) Using the original recipe 1/2 cup red/green/white m&m's, then milk chocolate and white chocolate also.

I didn't bake the cookies yet but I had to make 60 jars for the holidays. I used the recipe to the T n some of them come out more than others which was a little weird to me n I used candy canes, m&m and chocolate chips so we will see how they come out.
