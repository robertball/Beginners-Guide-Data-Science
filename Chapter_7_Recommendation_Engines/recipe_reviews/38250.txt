The addition of Kool-Aid ruins this recipe; it just comes out tasting like bitter, powdered drink mix.  Better to use natural or  commerically available food colorings and flavors.

I made purple, red, yellow, and green to decorate my daughter's cake with Telletubbies.  It was very cute and she loved it.  The flavor was a bit intense though.  I definitely would not do sour flavors again like lemon or lime.
