These muffins are great! I modified them by doing half wheat half white flour and adding a dash of cinnamon. I also used three bananas and most of a 20 oz can of pineapple because the point of making this recipe was to use them up. One modification I highly recommend is using the drained off pineapple juice for cooking the oatmeal it adds natural sweetness and gives it a kick. The muffins needed to cook for longer than indicated closer to 35 or 40 minutes.

I realized after I'd mixed these that there's no fat (butter or oil) in them. I'm assuming the coconut milk is the sub for that. I did use authentic canned coconut milk. These muffins completely stuck to the paper liners and had a weird texture. I didn't like the smell or taste either. They did not taste like pineapple coconut or banana. I won't make these again.

I made this recipe exactly how it was published and it smelled and tasted a little strange. I don't think the pineapple mixed well with the other parts. Other than that they were ok

I played with this recipe a bit to suit me but they came out tasting pretty decent. I used skim milk instead of coconut and upped the extract to a full teaspoon to try to balance that I used upwards of 1/2 teaspoon I'd say of fresh grated nutmeg used about 12 ounces of pineapple and used brown sugar instead of white because I just like brown sugar. My muffins looked gorgeous in the oven but then fell flat once I pulled them out. They were browned on top but kind of raw on the inside too. I don't know if that will fix itself overnight but the flavor isn't bad. It's a bunch of mild flavors coming at you but they don't all hit you at once...they're nice. I think I'll like them more if they firm up and aren't so soggy. Dates would be AMAZING in here.

This is one of those recipes that sounded so good but was a disappointment. They turned out very mushy inside even with extra cooking time added on. The flavors were too mild.

This recipe is good - I used applesauce instead of pineapple and added shredded coconut. Lovely tropical flavour with a chewy exterior and soft fluffy inside. My girls loved them with butter!

We loved these! I used whole wheat pastry flour and turbinado sugar instead. The second time I made it I added dark sweet cherries and it was even better. I had to use vanilla extract so I added some unsweetened coconut flakes too. I'm sure I'll make these again. Since these don't rise much just fill the batter all the way to the top for a perfect muffin. I also took the suggestion of cooking the oatmeal in pineapple juice. Thanks!

Good flavor after spreading some pineapple cream cheese on top. Stuck to the liners and did not rise. I also added in a little coconut.

Very very moist although they didn't rise very high (I suspect the acid in the pineapple inhibited the action of the chemical leavening). I added 1/4 cup of grated coconut. Everyone loved them!

After reading more then a few reviews of this being bland I decided to try a few changes. 1/2 cup Almond flour instead of the bran mandarin oranges instead of the pineapple and upped the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. Added 1/2 cup grated coconut too and almond extract because I didn't have coconut. Awesome flavor and served with fresh homemade applesauce. Made a terrific breakfast and snack

I did these muffins 2 days ago and it did not turn out good at all! I used muffin liners and all the muffins were stuck on the liners I am thinking maybe because the recipe does not call for any butter. Anyhow I think all the ingredients don't really mix well... the banana coconut pineapple and oats - it should even maybe be sweeter I don't know. Maybe pineapple and coconut do mix I did not really like these - sorry
