I didn't have any rice wine so used Cabernet sauvignon instead - Used a little less of each liquid and was still more than enough. Didnt have sesame oil so substituted olive oil into which i put 3 teaspoons of flax seed and heated up the oil for about 10 minutes. Had a thick piece of salmon so cooked it at 375 for 25 minutes and it came out perfect. When i make it again, will marinade the salmon overnight for a more intense flavor
