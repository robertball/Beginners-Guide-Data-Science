This is a yummy dessert, it makes plenty and is a crowd pleaser.  It does not get mushy if you refrigerate over night overall it is a very light, summer dessert.

This is absolutely the easiest and most delicious trifle I've ever tried.  I usually flop everything I make no matter how easy the recipe is, but there is nothing that I could possibly mess up with this recipe.  My boyfriend said this is the best thing I've ever made.  I wrapped some up for his mother and even she raved about it.  I will definately make this trifle many, many more times.

I really wanted to give this recipe 4 stars, but just couldn't with so many adjustments.  First, I made my own white cake which came out great, but 2 regular size layers were way too much...I couldn't fit it all in the bowl, and I have a standard size trifle bowl.  Next time, I'll make only one cake and cut it in half through the mid-section to get two thinner layers.  Also, I was surprised the recipe didn't call for any sherry, so I added 1/4 cup dry sherry to the bottom cake layer...really nice.  Next, I've never had an English Trifle with a banana layer, so I omitted it...didn't feel the berries really needed it or like the idea of brown mushy bananas for leftovers.  I also wasn't crazy about the taste and texture of the instant vanilla pudding...will try to make something better for next time, though it may take more time & effort.  To the whipping cream I added 2 Tbsps sugar and 1 tsp vanilla...would have been pretty bland without it.  Finally, I omitted the slivered almonds and maraschino cherries on top...didn't feel they would add anything to the already wonderful fresh berries.  Overall, a decent base recipe that I will make my own...still glad I tried it!

This is a nice, basic trifle.  It does make quite a bit, but the leftovers are still great.  Mine were not runny or mushy at all.  I will definately make this when I need an easy dessert for a group of people.

My family just can't get enough of this with fresh summer fruit and berries.  So good and refreshing.  I add 2 kiwi to the fruit listed in the recipe.  It adds some nice color.  Also, I use cheesecake flavor pudding rather than the vanilla.  This is a great make ahead dessert.

This was very good, light, and easy.  I only used one layer of the cake, though, and that was plenty.  Otherwise, I think the fruit and pudding would have been lost.

Awesome dessert.  Used cheesecake pudding as well.  Everyone in my familly gave it 5 stars.  Next time will probably use twice the ammount of pudding though and create a bottom layer of pudding under the first layer of cake.  Simply the best!

Great recipe, however I made homemade pudding and homemade cake both from this site and the result was out of this world, well worth the effort.Thanks for sharing.

5 stars for sure!!  I made my pudding by using half milk and half heavy cream- it comes out so delicious that way and I also made my whipped cream by whipping 2 cups heavy cream with 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar and a squirt of vanilla.  Comes out better when you chill the bowl in the freezer for 20 minutes prior to whipping.  I did put a whipped cream layer on top of the first layer of pudding as well as on top.  I also used butter pound cake instead of the white cake because I had some to use up and it was yummy.  It was gone in a heartbeat!  And I got requests for the recipe.  Good Share...

This is very close to the one I got from my friend's in England.  The only difference is they use Angel food cake and you HAVE to put either Sherry or Brandy on the bottom layer of cake and let it soak up the booze to make it a proper English trifle .  Depending on who poured it on in my family it was anywhere from 1/2 to 1 cup!  Dad would add more.

I agree with a previous review who said this makes quite a large quantity. For me, my trifle bowl was...dare I say it...a trifle small. If you want to make a smaller quantity or use a smaller bowl, you can get away with only 1 cake sliced in half and not cubed. This also allows for more easy layering of the fruit. I did not use the whipped crease simply ran out of room! Delicious nonetheless.

Very good.  I prefer to use berries only.  I also add shaved white chocolate atop the cream layer.  I prefer to make homemade whipped cream rather than to use store bought cool whip.  It's a very rich and decadent dessert, so the more you control the sweetness and the richness of it, the better it will be.

I made this trifle yesterday for a family get together and it was the biggest of anything I've ever made.  My family went crazy over it and there was none left to bring home.  It is absolutely delicious and the men really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing it.

I've been looking for a while for a GREAT recipe and this is it! I do make a few changes, no cherries and I use pound cake instead of baking a cake. Also, I use cool whip instead of whipping cream. This is always a hit at parties and looks just beautiful! I also tried using the cheesecake flavor pudding that others recommended and it was delicious but not that different in flavor from the vanilla.

Slightly merged this recipe with Jello's Angel Lush recipe.  Used an angel food cake instead, decreased the sugar to 1/8 cup, used 3 bananas, 1/2 cup oj to soak in, and cheesecake instant pudding.  Also mixed in 1 cup of cool whip to the pudding mixture to thicken it.  Layered cake, pudding, fruit and repeated.  Left the whipping cream, almonds, and cherries off completely. The last layer of fruit makes a beautiful top.  Everyone raved about it and asked for my recipe.

This is a good recipe, however proper English trifle is made with custard and not vanilla pudding.  It really does change the taste.  You can use canned fruit and mix with fresh fruit, and custard.  Pour sherry over your sponge for a real classic Sherry Trifle - or try amaretto, which is good too.

I brought this to an summer evening "work" picnic.  It was light and refreshing and looked decadent, too.  Two white cake layers was more cake than needed for the size of trifle bowl that I have.  One to 1 1/2 layers would have been perfect.

Delicious!  Perfect as a chilled dessert after a hot summer BBQ.  The only real change I made was to use granola instead of almonds.  I also put them into individual glass bowls (which only had room for one cake layer), and used strawberry glaze to make decorative swirls along the inside of the glass.  Everyone loved them!

Absolutely delicious!!! I used an Entenmann's fat free yellow cake and sugar free pudding.  I made this for company and they loved it too.  I will definately be making this again- it's awesome.

I used splashes of Amaretto liqueur over cubed pound cake and also mixed a little in with the pudding to give it more flavor.  I blended the fresh fruit with some frozen thawed fruit as fresh fruit is very pricey and not that great here in New England in the winter.  Topped with fresh whipped cream...very good and very rich.  I would like to try it in the summer when fresh fruit is better and more plentiful.  Thanks for sharing.........

Everyone loved this!!!  I made the cake the night before and then assembled the rest one hour before I served it... Next time I won't add the bananas because the next day leftovers had slimy brown bananas.

OH, my gosh!!!! This triffle was SOOOO good:)  I used strawberries, bananas, blueberries and kiwi.  This recipe was so easy and such a huge hit with my husband and our guests that I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it!  I changed it a little to make it a little more summery by putting strawberries, kiwi, bananas, and pineapple.  A very refreshing blend.

I used homemade pastry cream instead of the instant pudding.  This was lovely!

http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/English-Trifle/Detail.aspx# i used a duncan hines white cake mix but made it with  vanilla pudding and almond extract to make an almond pound cake.  used that instead of the plain white cake mix.   Amazing.  I also substituted fresh blackberries on the top in a nice pattern instead of cherries as that is what I had.   everyone loved it.  signature dessert

Made this for a New Year's party and it was even better than I could have hoped!  I used blackberries instead of bananas and also added vanilla to the whip cream.  I also used about 1-2 cups of orange juice over the cake layers.  I only needed 1x8 in cake layer, I have no idea how you could fit 2 in the trifle bowl.

I was absolutely delighted with the results of this recipe.  I used store bought sponge cake and, as it was not the time of year for fresh fruit, frozen strawberries and blueberries, partially thawed. A keeper!

Made this Friday and it was a big hit. A few things I did differently: Crumbled the layers of cake (so it would all fit in my bowl), used cook and serve pudding instead of instant, used creamy cool whip instead of real whipped cream, and added a layer of cool whip in the first layer.

I made this for a neighborhood progressive dinner and the crowd went wild.  Had to use frozen fruit, but still turned out great.  I can't wait to make it with different kinds of fresh fruit in the summer.

Made this dessert today and it turned out amazing. Rave reviews by all! I did make my own white cake and vanilla pudding from scratch(recipes from this website) and I think that added the perfect touch. I made the cake and pudding last night to save time. All in all it was absolutely delicious. I was expecting it to be heavy but it tasted like a light summery dessert...can't beat that!!

This is a great dessert. I made it for new year's eve party and it was gone in a minute. I didn't give 5 star because there is way too much cake in the recipe. I used only half packet of cake mix and 1.5 packet of vanilla pudding. I didn't use any almonds ( personal choice) and decorated it with sliced strawberries. made two layers and they were gone before any other desserts came out!! UPDATE-- I made it 3 times now, every time great hit. This time I used Pineapple cake mix and it taste sooooo good!! Try it, you will be happy you did.

It was okay. I really like my Grandma's English trifle. Should be custard instead of pudding. Also tasted of too much banana. Looks like most liked this recipe on hear, but it wasn't a winner for me.

I've made this recipe twice (a dinner party and church xmas party)this month! and each time i get many compliments! First its 'its to beautiful to eat' then its all gone!

I like to pack it all tight, doing the cake this way at the bottom and then putting the strawberries (i used pie filling, its sweeter, and i like the syrup drizzle look when it seeps into the cracks of the cake) then putting each blueberry close to eachother around the glass. then laying the bananas laying on the one before it....it looks gorgeous...will make it for christmas this year...and my sister's wedding days after xmas! its a big hit!

This is an excellent recipe. I used a store bought angel food cake (it gets a little mushy but still tastes great) and I added crushed pineapple to the layers. I didn't have orange juice so used a little lemon juice so the bananas wouldn't turn brown. All fresh fruit in the summer is a plus! On the top I used fresh strawberry wedges and no almonds or cherries. The whole thing was gobbled down in about 5 minutes! Let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.

Everyone loved it!  I cheated and used two angelfood cakes because they were buy one get one free and it was too hot out to bake a cake!  I just broke it into pieces and did everything else the same.  Yummy!

This was wonderful!  I tried to cut back on fat and calories because it was for home:  I used a white cake mix that called for egg whites and 1/3 cup oil (I used half applesauce, and half oil).  The sugar called for in the recipe is used to make the strawberries release their natural juices, but I used only 1 Tbl. It made for a little drier layer, but was still good.  (You really need to let the strawberries sit for 15-20 minutes so they release their juices, by the way.)  I also used skim milk for the pudding, and 8 oz. fat-free Cool Whip, spread as a middle layer as well as the topping.  Very light, yet was still a great dessert!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. I wanted a trifle recipe for an anniversary party and this one really fit the bill. I did pour brandy over the cake to make it really special. Yum. I also left out the banana's because I forgot to buy them. Very easy to make, and the end result is very pretty.

This was a HUGE hit at our families get together. However, the next time I will omit the almond. Most of the men in the family complained how it ruined the texture.

Very good- the only changes- left out bananas and  since I like to taste my whipped cream, I added 2 tbsp powdered sugar to whipped cream.  Every single person went on and on about these.  Simple, pretty and tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved this more than I did but I have to admit that I used a sugar free Angel Food cake recipe for the cake instead of what was called for.  I'm probably just not a huge English Trifle fan.

Delish! Very easy to do and tastes great! Not too filling and will serve a good size group. Although my people kept having seconds so maybe not;) I used banana pudding and it was great. Next time i will try it with lemon cake instead. I think that will be delightful.

I made this recipe according to the instructions and it is wonderful! The only note I would add is to let the juice from the cherries drain off before putting them on top.  The cherry juice runs on the whip cream. This is just a presentation issue, because it tastes great.  I think next time I will try to make my own pudding to see if this adds anything to the recipe.

I also made this a couple weeks ago and I am just now getting around to reviewing it. I made this for Bunco Night. The girls raved about it! It is a basic trifle that is VERY easy to mix up. Mine turned out a tad runny, I dont know if it was the custard I used or if the berrys I used let off alot of juice. However it was very well recieved and I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVE trifle!  One of my top five favorite desserts (which is saying a lot!)  I don't want to make traditional trifle, and this one works out fabulously in it's place.  I made this for Thanksgiving last year and everyone raved.  It's so pretty, and it's really easy for the little ones to help make, which makes it special as well.  I used pineapple/orange juice to soak the pound cake - you could probably use any kind of juice.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Awesome stuff!!
I didn't have the cherries for the top so I used kiwi, also used angel food cake and cool whip, but that's what I like about this recipe is almost anything goes....Definately will make again.

This dessert will bring ooh's and aah's wherever you take it.  It's beautiful and easy.  First off, I don't make the cake - buy a pound cake or angel food cake!  I do use a egg slicer to slice the strawberries.  I don't use bananas with OJ nor the cherries or almonds.  I top it with a few neatly placed strawberries.  Excellent!!! I never thought I'd ever have a use for my trifle bowl but this recipe keeps it busy!

This is so delicious and beautiful!  I took it over to a barbeque, and even my friend who is a chef went on and on about how great it was.  The only change I made was to sprinkle 1/4 c. of brandy over each layer of cake (I used angelfood cake).  I can't wait to make it again!

This was a hit at Easter dinner!  I used 4 kiwis instead of bananas and cheesecake flavored pudding.  I increased it to 2 small packets of instant pudding and had some left over.  I just filled a couple of custard cups and snacked on it later.  Everyone was impressed with how pretty it was!  Definetly a keeper!

this is excellent start to a great recipe!  I made mine a little more like I would make a chocolate trifle--with more layers (3 instead of 2).  It really changes the look of the dessert.   I used lady fingers instead of white cake and let the strawberries mascerate (juice) overnight, so the lady fingers has something to soak up. This recipe can also be really light--using lite cool whip and fat free pudding.    So easy, so fun to make, so delicious!  thanks.

Excellent and yummy - I took short cuts by using a lemon pound cake bought from the store, lemon pudding and some lemoncelo liqueur if serving to adults - also couldn't find blueberries so I substited with a can of crushed pineapple with the juice - wow - so many compliments from everyone.  Topped it with Light Cool Whip and decorated with small pieces of sugared pineapple pieces and strawberries.  Thank you for this recipe....

I took this to our family Father's Day BBQ and it was a hit.  Even the men raved about it and they usually don't comment on desserts!  I used vanilla pudding, but I think I'll try using lemon next, just for a new flavor.  Thanks!

A nice looking dessert. I used sugar-free vanilla and cool whip instead of whipping my own cream.  Also added raspberries, instead of the cherries and used pound cake, which gave a good texture to the dish.

This was very easy to make and tasted great. I used raspberries instead of the cherries on top - it seemed to go better with the other fruit. I also suggest not letting the pudding set so that it soaks into the cake cubes better. Nice dish to take somewhere - looks mor complicated than it is!

This is a lovely trifle recipe.  Another recipe I've used does not call for sugaring the strawberries, so I was a bit concerned that this might be too sweet.  It turned out beautifully, though, as the sugar created a nice syrup which helped moisten the cake (I used angel cake).  I also added some sliced kiwifruit along with the other fruit.  People went wild for this dessert--it's one I'll make often.  Thanks for posting it!

Wow! What a crowd pleaser!!! SO easy to make, so easy to adjust, and so impressive looking. My first attempt at a trifle, and I couldn't have been happier with it. Thank you for a wonderfully simple recipe that I can put together for any fancy occassion! P.S. I made this for Valentine's day, so I used white cake but colored some of it pink and some of it red to have more Valentine color. Adorable!

I served this last night at a family get together and everyone just raved about it.  I used premade mini jelly role cake, I doubled the pudding/milk amount and used blueberries instead of bananas.  I also mixed in some cool whip with the pudding to lighten it up.

Took this Trifle to a Memorial Day picnic where it received RAVE reviews.  All my relatives loved it and exclaimed what a gourmet cook I was...if only they had known how easy it was!!  I followed the recipe to a T, the only thing I would do differently is make the pudding in advance because mine took a while to cool.

WONDERFUL!  I used sugar free pudding and angle cake instead of regular cake.  I can't wait to make this in the summer months, when the berries are sweeter.  I added more almonds, but only becuase we love almonds! Thanks for the recipe.

This was easy to do and tastes divine! :) I had a bit too much white cake leftover though.  I put my trifle into a large glass bowl, not an actual trifle bowl.  But, I'd definitely make it again.

I've made this for 2 different dinners this weekend and it was a hit both times! The first time, I made my own cake. The second I didn't have time so I picked up a store bought one.  Both were great. The only thing I left out were the bananas. I just don't like bananas!  I'll make this again for sure!

This is a great recipe.  I love trifle, so I was very excited to see this one.  Next time, I'm thinking of trying to soak the bananas in a Gran Manier instead of orange juice, but I'm not sure how it will taste.

So easy and so delicious! I used this trifle recipe because I had a white cake mix on hand and the others use angel food cake. I made the night before our family Easter party and it was not soggy at all when we ate it and it was a light dessert after a heavy meal. I also layered the whipped topping after the pudding mixture.

Was looking for a recipe to use up a bunch of fruit. This is it. It does make a lot so give some to the neighbors. I used strawberries,pears,bananas,blueberries the family loved it. Used cooked pudding we do not like instant.

This recipe is equally as good made with bakery angelfood cake and fat free sugar free instant puddings and Free Cool Whip for fewer calories.   If more orange flavor is desired add a teaspoon of frozen OJ concentrate.

Tastes great.  A family friend would always make this, but to add an extra kick, try adding 1/2 cup of brandy to the bottom of the bowl while making it.

This is a great recipe I've used for many years.  Friends and relatives request I make it all the time.
Changes: 1.  I don't use the whole cake - only half.
2.  Add 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar once whipped cream is ready to sweeten it.
3.  Don't bother with the almonds and cherries

There are no hard & fast rules for trifle.  My mom was from Scotland, so she made trifle for special occasions often.  Instead of the pudding, she used custard sauce made from Custard Powder, usually found in the cake aisle near the pudding & jello mixes. She also substituted diluted jello mix (just the hot portion) of choice for the sherry, sprinkling over cubed angel food cake.  And if there was no fresh fruit available, she substituted a can of fruit cocktail, drained. It's great to have all these variations!  Each are unique and delicious!

This is my favorite go to dessert. I made a weight-friendly version of it on the 4th of July. Used angel food cake, and instant pudding with fat-free milk. I also used all fresh berries.

By the way, I always soak each cake layer with sherry.

Another reviewer commented that even the men always love it. I agree. My husband does not eat much dessert. He never turns this one down.

Made this today for a light Christmas dessert.  I used angel food cake, 2 packs vanilla pudding, 1 tub Cool Whip, 2 bananas, 2 kiwi, pineapple slices, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries.  Didn't do strawberries as my guy is allergic.  FANTASTIC - you can't go wrong with this - any berry/fruit will work.

This recipe is very good. My 11 year old son actually made it himself, with my supervision. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the white cake got a little soggy. Next time, I'll use pound cake.

I have made trifles before with jam, strawberries and custard and of course, alcohol. But I had to make something for a baby shower without alcohol and more colorful. THIS WAS IT! Zero left overs after the baby shower! Only adjustment that I made was that I used lady fingers. I've always use them when making a trifle. But everything else was according to the recipe. I made it the night before and made the whip topping the morning of the shower. Fantastic! I will make this again!

Overly sweet despite omitting the sugar altogether. The cake does not go with the other ingredients. on this trifle luckily I only made 2 single servings.

This is fabulous! I made for a family cookout, and not only is this dessert very pretty, it tastes even better than it looks! I think this dessert would be good if the recipe was followed exactly, but I made a few minor changes as to the ingredients I already had. I made an Angel Food cake, and used half to cube, and I used whipped cream, and French Vanilla pudding.

Really good! I followed suggestions of others and added sherry to the bottom of my individual dessert glasses- NOT good! I get that it's traditional, but no one liked it. The rest of the dessert was amazing and really quick to make. I did leave out the bananas just because I didn't have any on hand, but it didn't seem to make a difference. Next time I make it, no booze. :)

Very hard to make defining layers with this recipe. That is the key to a proper English trifle. Though the flavor isn't bad, the banana's melt far too fast. The cost to make this is not worth the expense. Sorry.

Easy to assemble nice presentation. I substituted pineapple for ?? juice, and used frozen berries that I had on hand. Perfect 4th of July or any summer day.

I made this using only strawberries with the pudding and white cake.  The white cake is perfect because it's not overly sweet!  I used 2 quarts of strawberries that I sliced and sprinkled a couple tablespoons of sugar on and then mixed.  I ended up making 2 packages of instant vanilla pudding.  I also cheated and used cool whip for the topping which I piped on.  My family loved this so much!  And it was pretty darn easy and impressive!  Ty for the recipe!

This dessert was delicious!  I brought this to a family pool party, and everyone attending took the leftovers. I received A LOT of compliments. I did not have the cherries or almonds, due to using what had in the house, but it was delicious without. I bought a trifle dish after making this because I will definitely make this again (with cherries and almonds).

Made this at work for a coworker's 60th birthday. He asked for an English Trifle and he really loved this one. I had a bunch of leftover confetti cake from cake push pops so it was perfect for this. I made the pudding with heavy cream and piped the whipped cream on top. Beautiful and delicious!

Yes, I added a bit more vanilla pudding than the recipe called for. Also, skipped the blueberries because I had raspberries and blackberries in my fridge.

It's so pretty I didn't want to eat it! But then it tasted good and I HAD to. Will make again. Instead of using vanilla pudding I mixed lemon pudding with some whipped cream. Everyone seemed to like that very much!

My new favourite recipe!  It was a lot easier than I thought and amazing.  I added strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi and put blueberries on top.  I also used angel food cake to make is lighter.  Everyone had 3rds!

This was really good. I made a gluten free pound cake and used it for the cake, as well as substituting raspberries and blueberries for the bananas. The only thing I would change is to use 2 packages of vanilla pudding.

This was a hit at my 4th of July party. I just used 1 cake too, and instead of the almond slivers and maraschino, I sliced and pitted real cherries and interspersed fresh mint leaves from my garden. Yum!

Took it to a small party and everyone had some. It was the talk of the table. I used a 10 inch loaf of angelfood and it was still a lot of cake. I recommend more pudding. It was almost lost in everything else. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.
