Not too bad.  A bit too vinegary, so I think I'd use less or marinate less.  Bf wasn't impressed with the walnuts or feta, although I did like it that way.  I think I'd forego stacking it though.  A little time consuming and it's not the prettiest bc of all the beet juice, so I think I'd just mix it all together and call it a salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

A pretty, really easy appetizer which easily impresses. Be sure to slice the beets and feta thinly.

I LOVE this recipe. It's very easy and super tasty. I recommend buying prepared (steamed and peeled) beets to make this even easier. It tastes just as good!

If it were not for this recipe here, I would have never thought to combine beets and feta.  What a wonderful combination.  I also added some black kalamta olives, and didn't stack.  I don't eat beets, but will eat them like this.  Thanks for the post!

This recipe is quick and easy, and even my partner who doesn't like beets enjoyed it.  I used cider vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar, and the beets still were delicious.  Thanks for this quick and easy recipe!

I guess I'm not really a beet person, but these were ok...great presentation, even though I only made one layer (i.e. feta and walnuts on top). The beets seemed to be underdone and I followed the recipe exactly as stated...except I don't know how to turn my microwave to medium (I just don't use it enough). My husband likes beets and thought this was really neat.

This dish was amazing.  The first time I made it, I was taking it to a potluck.  My boyfriend who does not like beets enjoyed them.  I used red wine vinegar because that is what I had in my cabinet, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  So delicious, and better cold.

this recipe combines ingediants that I would have never thought to put together. I likes to way the flavors played off of each other. My Husband however did not appriciate it and wished I would have made plain beets. This is for those who tast palets can take something new.
