Ok.....Am I the only one stupid enough to question the eggs in the ingredients saying 2 EGGS, BEATEN and in the directions it saying ADD EGG YOLKS (only)???  Well, I added yolks "only" and realized this did not look right so I logged on to check similar recipes.  Decided to add the WHITES and by this time, the yolks & sugar have stiffened.  I added the whites anyway and it looks like scrambled eggs.  It's in the oven now.  Doesn't that sould good......chunks of hardened, cooked egg yolk on top of rhubarb and a crust.......yummy

This pie, made with the first fruits of spring, is a delicious, delightful reward for enduring the long MN winter! Excellent recipe-probably the easiest pie I've ever made(especially if you use frozen piecrust!) I like to cut the rhubarb a bit smaller-1/2 inch pieces-and add a little vanilla and fresh grated nutmeg. Next time I think I'll try adding a meringue topping...Thanks, Patti!

I love this recipe because the rhubarb isn't diluted with strawberries etc. I do add more cinnamon to mine, but otherwise the recipe is perfect and crazy simple to make. Between my husband and I, it usually doesn't last longer than 24 hours! Sinfully delicious!!!

My first experience cooking with rhubarb.  I have never liked the taste of it before but thought I'd try this recipe out for my husband.  Turns out, I loved it!  Added a little more cinnamon plus nutmeg and vanilla like others suggested.  This pie was SO easy to make!

This was so easy to make for someone who doesn't bake!  I just added a mixture of cinnamon and sugar to the top.  I also put flour and sugar on the crust before putting the rhubarb on, as someone had suggested.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you!

I have been meaning to make this for over 2 years and am so glad I finally did. This was extremely easy and delicious. I used a premade graham cracker crust and it worked great. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the filling before baking it. I will definitely make this again!

Very easy, similar to one I have used for years. The only difference my calls for a meringue topping. Use a meringue recipe that calls for 3egg whites and cook it the same way as for lemon meringue pie. Adds a nice finishing touch.

Perfect! I had just less than two cups of rhubarb, I added a 1/3 cup of flour (to prevent runny center), I used a thick home made pastry crust and I cooked the pie for just 40 min at 345Â°. The cinnamon was too much and its flavour coverd a little the rhubarb taste but the pie is really a must! I will do it again and again (well.....I'm in San Francisco now, but I live in italy where rhubarb is very hard to find.....)

This was okay.  The custard was not as creamy as I was expecting.  It turned into more of a spongey consistency.  I guess I just perfer unadulterated rhubarb!

To me custard pie has custard in it. My family felt this was a plain old rhubarb pie without milk added. It makes a great Rhubarb pie.

Very good, made as written and the amounts fit perfectly into a 9 inch glass pie pan.  I might be inclined to decrease the sugar by a bit, perhaps to 3/4 cup next time.  I appreciated that the filling didn't spill over the crust! Thank you for posting the recipe.

I will certainly make this again because it tasted just like my Mom's and it was so easy to make. I used Dr. Oetker's prepared pie dough for the crust and 1 package made 2  - 9 in. pies.

I made only one change - halved the sugar.  For me, 1/2 cup and a teaspoon or so is enough.  Otherwise, it's a fantastic and simple recipe.  Just fill the pie shell wity your preferred amount of rhubarb and pour on the custard mix.  I prefer smaller/thinner stalks of rhubarb.

Simple, easy, and so very yummy.  My family gave it 2 thumbs up.  Will be making this recipe again and again.  I put in 1 tsp of cinnamon and the taste and "topping" were fantastic!!

Best rhubarb pie ever!  I did take the advice of another's review and added a small amount of sugar and cinnamon to the rhubarb before pouring on the egg mixture.  It was great!  My mom used to make great strawberry rhubarb pie but I think this is better.....sorry mom!!
