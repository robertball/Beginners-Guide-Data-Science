I am the recipe submitter. Just a tip: you will need 1/2 cup brown sugar TOTAL for this recipe.  When the recipe got published, Allrecipes decided to state it as 1 tbsp + 7 tbsp.  You do not need to count out 7 tbsp of sugar! To save time, just measure out 1/2 cup and use 1 tbsp of it for the peaches in the second step. These are not meant to be sweet muffins, but if you prefer things a little sweeter, adjust accordingly. Enjoy! :)

We just came home from an orchard in Michigan with about 20# of scrumptious peaches. This was one of the recipes I tried. I love unusual combinations and this was a hit! I had to use a combination of cheddar and pepper jack, which gave them a nice kick to contrast the sweet peaches. If I have peaches left after making jam, buckle, etc., I'll definitely make more of these!

These were really good. I didn't like the cheese on top, though. The cheese stuck to the muffin cups, making them hard to open without them falling apart, the tough cheese top encouraged the falling apart, and the cheese top was a little too chewy for my son. Next time, I'll mix the rest of the cheese in with the batter.

These were fantastic!  I made them exactly as described. Thanks for the "just use 1T out of the 1/2c of brown sugar" tip. I still thought they were sweet (but not too sweet).

Wonderful savory and sweet muffin - I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour with great results. I may add some flax seeds next time to give the muffin more substance.

What a fun delight of savory and sweet!  Even the guys liked them!  I think next time I might add some BACON! :)

The only change to the recipe was that I added more sugar bc the peaches were hard and awful.  I think good peaches would have made this recipe a full 5 stars!

I had high hopes for these but thought they were just okay. As another reviewer stated, the cheddar sprinkled on top made it hard to separate the muffin liners from the muffins, and so they crumbled a little trying to get them out. If I make them again I won’t sprinkle cheese on top. I also thought they could use a little more basil, it didn’t stand out enough for my pallet.

A delicious savory and sweet muffin! I halved it and got 5 jumbo-sized muffins. Mine were ready at 20 min. The peaches give it a really nice sweetness. I would add a little more basil the next time. I used the brand of cheese in the ingredients list. I sprinkled a few muffins with the cheese; some I left plain.  Maybe a little turbinado sugar would be nice on top, too. The one I just had with cheese was delicious and went great with Rachel's Tomato Basil Soup from this site. Thanks for this  unusual and delicious muffin!

Very very good!  Easy to make and so delicious.  I made them as described, but added 2 tbsp of flax meal because I like to sneak healthy things into my kids.  Parchment muffin cups were a plus!

I liked the idea of combining the flavors of cheese, peaches and basil, there are lots of peaches here now, I only used 2 tsp of brown sugar and a little bit more salt because I wanted it to be more savory. I also replaced cheddar for a similar good hard cheese, cheddar is too expensive where I live, the result was excellent, the peaches give them a special bittersweet touch to the proven basil and cheese association. I´ll try them with the original receipe sugar content next time. Thanks !!

I've been wanting to make these for awhile and I finally made them today! I wish I didn't wait so long to make them because these are delicious! Perfect for breakfast/brunch/snack! The flavours mix nicely with each other. I will definitely be making these this summer when family and friends visit!

We used a Cheddar Jack mix for the grated cheese and left the cheese off the top. Yum.

So yummy! Made them twice exactly as written (except for using sharp instead of extra-sharp cheese because that's what we had) and family gobbled them up both times. A good choice for anyone wanting a savory rather than a sweet muffin. Super moist and tasty. Will definitely make again--thanks!

Delicious!!!  I was afraid the basil would be overpowering so I used half the amount--perfect!

I have a lot of fresh basil soo I was compelled to use it. I've made these before. but I only had 1/2 the cheddar this time & they were still delish! I brought some for my co-workers and they were very well received.  Next time I'll leave the cheddar out & use more basil.   I don't feel guilty eating these for breakfast; they're not like the Dunkin Donut sugar bombs.

These are delicious. Wish I had sharp cheddar on hand had to use a Mexican blend but still super good.
