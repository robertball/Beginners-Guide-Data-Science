I feel like this recipe has a lot of potential and could be 5 stars with a few small changes. The sauce tasted like cream cheese with only the tiniest hint of mango. I doubled the jam to increase the mango flavor, but that made it sweet like a dessert, and still didn't offer much mango flavor. The shallots were a much needed balance of flavor, but I didn't love the how strong the raw shallots were. I will try this again and next time: 1. Reduce sauce by half because as is it yields way too much. 2. Experiment with some seasoning in the bread crumbs and/or sauce to enhance flavor 3. Saut√© the shallots.
