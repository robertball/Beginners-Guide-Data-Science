Quick and easy - plus they're perfect your're in a pinch and don't have crackers to go with tomato soup! I also added a little garlic to perk it up a bit. I liked the combination of Parmesan and poppy seeds.  My niece however didn't.... She didn't know what the little black things were so we had to make another batch without - ya just gotta love little kids!

Couldn't get any easier. I also use hamburger buns the same way. EXCEPT I don't melt the butter and I use garlic bread topping with Parmesan cheese and then broil.

these are good, but a little too bland. i usually make mine by also sprinkling them with seasoning salt and parsley flakes before baking :]

These are great when you're in a bind and need a simple, tasty bread. I do like the addition of the poppyseeds with the parmesan. Sometimes I add some garlic powder for another flavor. You can basically use any seasonings you like. Great use of leftover buns! Thanks for sharing. :)
