Sooooooo tasty!  Yum!  For amusement I used golden raisins because they end up looking just like the onions.  One of my friends ate half the meal before realizing why it was so sweet :-)  But, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, use pre-skinned onions.  You do not know the meaning of tedium until you have skinned 150 miniature onions.

This was delicious.  I brought it to a pot luck and everyone raved about it.  The only change I made was to cook it UNcovered.  I cooked it for an hour and a half and the liquid never reduced with it covered.  Once I uncovered it, things moved along smoothly.  Also, I used two bags of frozen pearl onions to make things go faster.

I was applauded with these onions and had been asked for the recipe at my dinner party.  I used frozen pearl onions the 2nd time as cleaning the onions was tedious.  Do not cook the frozen onions the time suggested as it gets mushy.

I had this mixed with white rice and sweet italian sausage and it was delicious! I think this is another recipe where it tastes better the next day after the flavors have had a chance to gel so you might consider making this a day in advance. :)

This dish made me the hit of the party!!  I made it the night before, refrigerated it after cooling it to room temperature, and then reheated it over a skillet.  Then  I served it bruschetta style on toasted french bread and goat cheese.  The combination and flavor were gourmet!  The only negative would be how time consuming the process was.  I won't do this anytime soon, but the next party I need to impress people ;)...I'll be making this dish!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and enjoyed it very much. It was going to take well over 45 minutes to cook down at "very low" so turned mine up a bit and stirred a little more often.

I too cooked these uncovered. I think I might have chosen the wrong audience for this dish as it wasn't very well received & I thought it was very good. I used golden raisins because I was out of regualr. My one complaint (other than the fact that it didn't wow my guests ;o) ) is that the raisins got a little "charred" but perhaps I caramelized teh onions too much. Thansk Christine... I will try this recipe again on guests w/ a more sophisticated palate.

My sister made this for Thanksgiving. When she told me the ingredients I thought it sounded really weird.  Boy was I wrong, It's really good.

Easy to make and a smash hit to taste. This side dish was the first to go at the Christmas table.

I have been using this recipe on demand of my family for Thanksgiving for many years now.  It is delicious with any meat or poultry.  I use golden raisins, sherry vinegar, and on occasion I've added some shredded carrot at the end for color.  This is now a family recipe that I will be passing on to the younger cooks!!!

I made this as an appetizer for our "sibling and spouses" Christmas dinner (read "all adults"!), and everyone liked it.  I used the frozen onions to save time; dried thyme, because my fresh had frozen in the unusually heavy snows the days before Christmas; dried cranberries (it was Christmas, after all!) and sherry vinegar. I toasted baguette slices, and topped them with the warm onion mixture and goat cheese.  I think I will try this next time without the thyme (I'm not a fan), maybe some rosemary (one of my favorite herbs), and some extra pepper for some "oomph".  Loved the basic idea - thanks!

Great recipe. Don't be tempted to use frozen onions. There is a huge difference in taste between the fresh and the frozen ones. Yes, it takes a while to squeeze the onions out of the skin, but well worth the extra effort. In fact, I would recommend never using frozen vegetables. They just aren't as flavorful as fresh and usually have a taste of being watered down.

The sauce was AMAZING! the honey, red vineger, and the sherry went so well together... I'm just not so much an onion person, though I didn't mind them much in this dish.

We LOVE this recipe. These are absolutely addictive! I was lazy so I simplified this and I used a bag of frozen peeled pearl onions that I picked up from Trader Joes. I did not cover them to cook because the frozen onions have alot more water and that worked fine. I am out of almonds so I skipped those altogether. YUMMY in spite of me. I will be serving this as a side dish with many different roasted meats & poultry in the future. Thanks so much for sharing!

I'm not a fan of pearl onions but my husband and father are so I made it as part of Christmas dinner.  They're also used to the creamed version so I took a chance.  
Dad was floored, absolutely loved it and wants them like this from now on.  My sister, son and I became converts.
I left out the almonds since I didn't have any but they would have definitely added a great crunch to it.

OMG, the house smelled so delicious while this was cooking. I switched out craisins for the raisins, other than that made as directed. Serving with Marinated Pork Tenderloin from this site, which in itself is super yummy. The onions took it to the next level. 
Didn't see that boiling the onions made them any easier to peel, just stickier.  
Will definitely be keeping this recipe handy!

Wow!  I don't love everything  I make or eat but did I love these caramelized pearl onions!  First, they were super easy to make and who doesn't love that?   I only made a small amount because it would just be dh and I eating them so I cut the recipe in half.    I don't especially love raisins so I substituted cranberries and the dish smelled like Thanksgiving.   If I were serving ham or lamb I think I'd use the raisins.   I served the onions with a top round roast beef and roasted potatoes.  I am a huge "no touch" person when it comes to my plate of food but the glaze tasted wonderful with the roast beef and the potatoes.  I actually mixed everything around together.  So many times after I work to make a meal it just doesn't appeal to me any longer but these onions and their sauce enhanced my dinner and made it extra good!

This was delicious! What a surprise. I tired it as a chutney-type dish with Indian chicken, but I think it would go great with any white meat dish. REALLY tasty, and different, which is always nice for guests.
