I followed the recipe to the letter. I used greek yogurt and 72% Godiva dark chocolate. The bananas where prefozen and help set the mixture a little faster.  This was so yummy. I may not share. And will make it again soon! Thanks for sharing this easy and very delicious dessert.

I used a good vanilla yogurt but it was hard to get past the tang of it. I added a little more than half of a cup of natural salted peanut butter and chopped up a leftover Hershey's bunny from Easter.
