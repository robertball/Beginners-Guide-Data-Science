I followed this recipe as written, with one exception, and that was replacing the Swiss chard with fresh spinach.  I was intrigued with adding the dry pasta to the sausage mixture, which is why I decided to give this a try.   Unfortunately it didn’t work well for me.  I was concerned the pasta would absorb a lot of the broth, but I forged ahead anyway.  I put this together just a few hours ahead and by the time I re-heated it, yep, nearly all the broth had been absorbed by the pasta.  I had used a full four cups of broth, but ended up adding another full 14.5 oz. can while re-heating.  The taste was ok, but I preferred it the next day, as the flavors had had more time to develop.  My version yielded 4 large portions, not 2.  If I make this again, I’ll cook the pasta separately and add it when re-heating.

I have not had pasta fazool for ages, because it usually makes so much.  This is perfect for a retired couple.  I also added some crushed rosemary and boiled some ditalini noodles separately, a salad and some Italian bread.  The Swiss Chard. if you can find it in your store, is a nice change from spinach.  Thank You again Chef John.

No changes this time. I might use smaller elbow mac next time. I didn't realize I grabbed big ones. This the first time my hubs used  bread to sop up the broth. Oh, and I used Rancho Gordo beans...if you're going to eat beans, eat the best. :)

Add this to your favorites first thing. I used baby Bok Choy because they didn't have Swiss Chard. It still was still good but probably better if you used the right ingredients which is why I rated it 5 stars, not based on my subpar add ins. I like the video because he explained why you need to do certain things so it doesn't appear as a mistake, like cooking the pasta with the sausage. Which is a must. I had bought Panera's small sourdough bread bowls and made a quick salad. A very tasty and filling meal on a cool Autumn evening. You won't be disappointed. I also added a little Chèvre on top so it doesn't give you that bloated feeling. Seems to really work...

First time ever making soup...think I overdid it with the Sausage.  Instead of using two links, I used four.  My family said it wasn't salty, but I had to use extra broth and water to off-set the Sausage because I thought it would be too salty.  I overcooked the elbow noodles so they were pretty mushy by the time I served the dish.   I also used spinach instead of what was recommended.  I think next time I stick with the recipe exactly as written.  One thing I highly recommend to people like me who are just starting to cook, prepare veggies and things that go into the soup ahead of time before combining them.  I threw the sausage into the oil like the recipe called, but I had to ask my Son-in-Law to cut the onion and celery because I was too busy breaking up the sausage in the pan.  As time goes on I'll get better in my preparation.  This was a "live and learn" experiment.

I made this soup exactly as writtten this evening and served it to my husband,  who could not believe that it took so little time to produce something so DELICIOUS.  

Many thanks to Chef John for making me look like I know what I'm doing in the kitchen!

I made it straight the first time, and the second time substituted kale for chard and leeks for the onion.  Even better!  This is a super yummy soup I fantasize ahead about eating!

I wish I could give this 10 stars!  Absolutely LOVE it!  My changes were spinach in lieu of  swiss chard, ditalini in lieu of elbow and added more broth (used 32 oz.).

Delicious! I made exactly as directed, except that I doubled it (we are in for several days of cold and rainy weather). As always, I highly recommend watching Chef John’s video, he cracks me up plus you get a little more information on how or why he recommends doing something a certain way (like why to add uncooked mac instead of cooking it first). So, make this recipe and enjoy a hug from an Italian grandmother. UPDATE: I made this 3 months ago and had a good 2 full servings leftover that I put in Tupperware and threw in the freezer. Yesterday, I set it in the fridge to defrost for 24 hours. Tonight, I put it in a saucepan with 1/2 a cup of chicken broth for 15-20 min and it was awesome! So just wanted to add a comment that is freezes very well!

This is a super simple, extremely flavorful  soup. I used fresh spinach , both chili flakes & cayenne pepper. Just the perfect amount for  a few bowls.

Love this recipe!  I ended up using less than the full 4 cups of broth, but would love it either way.  Perfect with crusty bread and wine.  We  have made this recipe more than once and we use sweet Italian sausage that is wonderful with the background pepper seasoning.  Don't change a thing.  A keeper and reheats nicely.

We made this recipe exactly as written. I thought it was okay, but not exceptional, but my husband loved it, so I'm giving it 4 stars. The red pepper flakes might make it too spicy for young children, but that's an easy thing to scale back on.

This turned out fantastic the very first time. I doubled the receipt for 4 people but you don't have to, it's very generous evidently because we have quite a bit left over.  I added more broth to get the consistency right, upped the pasta to 2 cups, increased both the oregano and the red pepper flakes due to the additional broth, and added garlic and white wine. Served it with crusty bread and a simple green salad with vinaigrette. RAVE REVIEWS. "You're such a good cook!" I gave all credit to this site and the recipe of course.

I love how quickly this came together and it's so flavorful!  Only substitution was to use fresh baby spinach instead of swiss chard.  Husband found this delicious and I made it last minute because I had some Italian sausages in the freezer.   Great recipe to have on hand.  Also, always keep italian sweet sausages in the freezer!

Delish! The only change I made was subbing spinach for the Swiss chard. I ended up using an entire 32 ounce carton of chicken broth. The soup was very flavorful and paired perfectly with a nice demi loaf from the bakery.

This was very tasty, the sausage makes it yum!  I did follow the directions exactly and it turned out great.  The pasta does absorb most if not all the liquid if you let it sit to long.  So I had to add more liquid to make it more of a soup before serving.

Delicious! All my guests raved and the kids liked it too. I used homemade chicken stock and baby kale, since I didn't have Swiss chard. It was incredibly easy and with the sweet sausage, pasta, and greens is a healthy meal that comes together quickly. Thanks Chef John!

This is a keeper. I have not had Pasta Fazool before. It came out wonderful and quite delicious!  I live a "one pot meal".

When I make this again I plan to double it because after this meal for my two Granddaughters and I there isn't enough leftovers for a second meal! I'm also thinking of adding minced garlic at the end when the chard goes in, along with a half cup of chopped red pepper.

Have made this twice in 2 weeks. We love it. It is much better than that from our local Italian 'franchise' restaurant. I made a few minor changes, just because I can't help myself. No changes that would have made much difference in this awesome soup as it is written.

This has to be my family's favorite hardy soup... The only thing I added is a couple cloves of garlic and I substituted spinach for Swiss chard... Thank you Chef John for all your wonderful recipes..

Definitely a keeper!!! Really wouldn't change a thing. I doubled it and we saved remaining for later and gave to family for them to try.

Very tasty! Made this for later in the week, so I'm sure I'll need to thin it out when reheating.  I have a feeling is going to be better after resting overnight. I sprinkled some garlic powder as an afterthought while cooking the sausage, celery, and onion. Super easy, flavorful,  and hearty.

Excellent recipe. I don’t care for chard, so I subbed fresh spinach. It was great as is, but when we ate the leftovers, we added more cooked elbow macaroni and some chopped canned plum tomatoes and a little powdered garlic ??. Even better. I think this recipe is kind of like chili or lasagna - good fresh but better the next day.

I agree with another reviewer, the cabbage all but disappeared. I would chop the cabbage in much bigger pieces more roughly, then add some more winter veggies, for some additional heartiness and color.

All in all, a solid base for some experimentation with winter soups.

Also, I would use sausage meatballs or sliced links, just to congregate the meat into bite-fulls.

Thank you for the recipe!

I loved this dish! The only thing I would do different is to not add any salt until closer to the end when the sausage is completely cooked. The sweet Italian sausage I used was already so salty that even the modest amount of salt I added made the dish too salty. Otherwise, I loved it and would definitely make again! Thank you, Chef John!!

i love this recipe- it comes out perfectly every time, no matter what. sometimes i skip the beans if i don't have any. usually i use spinach because i have it more often. but the tomato-y meat-y broth is delicious and the soup is very cheap, easy, and filling.

Made it for my Italian American mother in law who said it was delicious. Can’t get a better review than that!
Doubled the recipe and added 2 diced carrots, a small chopped onion and 2 diced ribs of celery to the browned sausage. Instead of tomato paste I added a large can of whole peeled tomatoes in puree.
Filling and delicious!

Very good, very fast, very easy. I did not have access to Swiss Chard, so I used spinach instead. I know the recipe said it makes two large servings or four small servings, but this made healthy servings for my family (four of us), with plenty leftover for a second helping. I'd say this easily makes eight servings.

Made it today using a small amount of frozen spinach (defrosted under faucet) instead of  Swiss chard and using less onion (1/4 of a small onion diced very small).   I also diced the celery very small.  I wanted the onion and celery for flavor but  didn't want their textures to be apparent.  I wasn't comfortable with 1/4 t of pepper flakes, so I used 1/8.   As it turned out 1/8 was enough for my tastes.

I thought the final product tasted great.  My son-in-law who hates all things 'beans'  loved it.  He had two servings like I did and took the leftover for lunch for tomorrow. 

It's a great recipe.  I should add that last night, knowing I was making this today, I began the process for Chef John's baguettes.  I made the (great) bread today for this meal and it complemented it perfectly.

One last thing:  I used exactly 3 C of chicken broth.  My wife  (who didn't eat this) thought is should be 'soupier' and it needed more broth.   Personally, I disagreed.  I 'm not looking at this recipe as a 'soup' but more like a 'chili'.

What a great soup!  Really enjoyed it and had enough to freeze.  I did freeze it without the pasta and will add that later.  Also, really like the Swiss Chard.  Have started replacing it in other soups instead of spinach.  Chef John rocks!!!

This is delicious! My son loves it and asks me to make it from time-to-time. I have made it using the Swiss Chard, but I usually make it without using it. I highly recommend trying it if you haven't already. Serve with crusty rolls, yum.

I used hot Italian sausage, because it was in the house, so I omitted the red pepper flakes. Used kale instead of Swiss Chard same reason. Delicious, easy and fast.

I used Kale instead of Swiss Chard. What I would suggest is to use half of the pasta since it swells up quite a bit. Also added Kidney beans in a mild chili sauce.

Never heard of it until I picked out the line "Pasta Fazool" from the Dean Martin song Amore from a recent commercial on tv.  Made it today and received strong complements from my valentine.  We loved it.

I substituted spinach for chard once and rigatoni for macaroni and it was delicious either way. It has become a staple in my meal planning rotation.

I have to wonder what kind of giants he's cooking for to only get two servings.  I got 6 cups  - enough for 6 adult servings.   The only changes I made were to use spinach instead of chard and ditalini instead of macaroni. Everyone loved it and it will become part of the regular rotation.

I will definitely make this again!  It was delicious!  I did make some changes only because I had some kale on hand that needed to be used up before it went bad.  I wish I had cut the leaves away from the stems, but the kale did wilt just fine.  I added just a tiny amount more pepper flakes as well as a little more oregano.  Three cups of broth was just the right amount.    Thanks Chef John!

I made some changes.  I made a lot of changes but it came out wonderful! I used chicken instead of sausage. I did not have sausage! I used rotini noodles. And, I added spinach towards the end. This was so good everyone had seconds!  Made enough for lunch the next day. This is a keeper that I will use again!

I found this recipe yesterday, while scrolling during lunch,  and it looked so good I had to hurry home to make it! I'm so happy I did, because it's tasty and different then anything we normally eat.
I'm eating the left overs today while posting this:)

Made this yesterday.  Everyone loved it.  Surprised at the flavor - totally delicious!  Not a bean person so only used half the amount.  Substituted spinach for the chard.  Definitely a keeper

This is excellent and comes together very easily. Recipe as written makes 4-6 servings, not 2. I used spinach in lieu of Swiss Chard as other reviewers suggested, and it was delish. Also used a full carton (4 c) of chicken broth to get the proper consistency, but no biggie. Will make again.

It turned out great.  Of course I couldn't make it without a substitution or two; Spinach for Swiss Chard, added a substantial amount of GARLIC,  you CAN'T make pasta fagioli without it.  No celery and Barilla protein pasta spirals instead of elbows (Ditalini, which is traditional, would have been best).  Topped with shaved parmesan cheese.

I love this hearty soup. I just changed a few things. 1st I used Spicy sausage (we like it hot) also I substituted Collards for the swisschard.  I had to add the collards before the macaroni and simmer down about 20 min to get them tender. If you are a fan of collards you will love this.

It was a very easy 1 pot meal to make!  
I did not use olive oil, as I figured the sausage I used was plenty greasy.  I added the onion, garlic and celery to brown with the sausage.
After I mixed in the pasta, paste and broth, I added the can of beans as well to simmer, probably 20 minutes.
I did not have  chard and the grocery store had some bad looking kale, so I bought spinach to use.

Good flavor, will save and do again!

i doubled the recipe, so I could have leftovers. So glad I did!! I used green chard, instead of Swiss (is there a difference?) and Italian seasoning, instead of just oregano and basil, but it turned out great! I loved it

I’ve made this about a half dozen times now. I’ve adjusted the quantity of some ingredients to fit my taste.  Otherwise I love it as written.  Sweet Italian sausage is a must. Definitely one of my favorite dishes.

My family and I do not eat pork, so i substituted the sausage with beef sausage.  I also used Brailla Cellentani pasta in place of the macaroni.  Everything else was the same as the original recipe.  And I have to say that this was GREAT!!!   It really didn't take much time to make and the entire family is requesting a second pot... Thanks Chef John.

Fantastic!   Tasted just like my Grammies.  I doubled this recipe for my big family.  Also, I added garlic and extra oregano.  I had kale on hand so I used it in place of the chard.  Husband says it's a keeper!

I have not had Pasta Fazool since I was a kid. Not fond memories! My aunt's secret recipe for her famous Pasta Fazool, Yuk! She wouldn't share it.. family recipe and all, I thank my lucky stars for that. That Thick.. thick, thick sauce, way, way way over cooked pasta, over seasoned concoction, not to mention the vegetables. I still have nightmares :) So when I told my mum I was going to make Pasta Fazool, I thought her eyes were going to pop out of her face! Turns out nobody liked it, everyone was scared. Chef Johns recipe, I didn't change a single thing; 30 minutes tops, followed the recipe to a T! It is amazing, perfectly seasoned, not to thick, not too thin pasta cooked al dente. All the ingredients in this recipe complemented one another, sweet sausage, onions, celery the tomato paste and chicken broth, Swiss chard was tender not tough topped off with parmigiana cheese yum! Not to mention the garlic bread and the red wine that chef john said would go nicely with this dish. This is the second recipe of chef johns that I have tried, I swear his recipes are no fail thank you for sharing Chef John, keep them coming!

I made it following the recipe, but tossed in a little chopped garlic and some basil leaves.  It was OK but I was a little disappointed in the flavor.  I was expecting a much more robust flavor, in the sauce/gravy, especially having added the items I did.   I say “gravy” because John made a point of saying it is a stew.
I have plenty of leftover, so will try a few things to  juice it up. While it was still warm, I added generously of pepper flakes and salt.
It may be that it is supposed to be as mine turned out.  Maybe it’d just not a dish for me?
I could use reduced beef broth, add some thyme and skip the beans, but it would no longer be pasta fazool.
Unlikely to make it again. But will eat the leftovers!

I really enjoyed this and will make it again. Made it exactly as per recipe but I used chorizo  sausage, though, and it had some heat! My wife kept saying how spicy it was but had seconds anyway.

Delicious! Very filling, definitely not 2 servings, I'd say 4. I'd suggest serving with bread to dip in the broth.

As a vegetarian I used Yves Spicy Italian Sausage for the meat. I cooked the noodles, reserved 3 cups of broth (I'd suggest 5 however as this will make the vegetable broth - just add vegetable bullion cubes). I used 2 stalks of celery and cooked this with the onion before adding it to the pasta and vegetable broth.

I loved this recipe. My husband loves meat so I used a lb of sausage. I used spinach instead.  Chef John  makes fantastic recipes.  Thank you chef John.

My hubby wants me to cut back on the sausage and add two cans of white kidney beans.  This soup was delicious the way it was, but I will make modifications for him!

Other than an addition of more broth at the end, made this exactly as recipe said.  Flavors were wonderful.  Recipe says it makes 2 servings--I doubled it--it could have fed 6-8 with a salad.  Definitely one of my go-too meals.

This was my first time making - or eating - this dish, and also my first time ever working with swiss chard. The recipe is EXCELLENT. The broth is extremely flavorful and tastes much more complex than you'd expect. Flavors are savory and bright, and Chef John was right: the sweetness and anise only added to the deliciousness of the dish. The chard added a nice crunchy texture. I would make this again and again, maybe adding a little more heat next time.

I made very few changes. Used a whole onion, not a half. And used parmesan cheese, not genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano .

We didn't care for the sweetness of this dish.  Don't know if it was the type of Italian sausage I used, but it tasted less Italian than I prefer. I like my Pasta Fagioli to have more of a tomato taste than sugary.  My husband thought it was ok, but felt we have had better.

This is wonderful.  I made it as written and served it immediately.  The only changes I made were to use 1 lb of sweet Italian turkey sausage, a whole onion, two celery stalks and 6 cups of Swiss chard.  (My vegetables needed to be used).  My son raved about it.  Thanks Chef John!!!

Thought it was excellent.  Next time I will cook the elbows separately, and add to dish after it has cooled, in order to better control how cooked the pasta gets.

This was so easy and super delicious.  I used hot Italian sausage and my store did not have Swiss chard, so I substituted that with collard greens.  I actually forgot to add the parmesan, but it still turned out great!

This was delicious as written and I did make it that way first time.  The second time I made it, I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and we liked it better.  
ASIDE: To Kevin Perry, who left  only a 3 star review after NOT following the recipe and admittedly making a few mistakes, in my opinion you were wrong to only leave 3 stars for YOUR mistakes.  I invite you to go back to your review and correct your star ranking or delete your average review since it's not the chef's fault your soup turned out less than optimal.

rating this for the amazing recipe. And writing review for my own  ability to post my changes for my own future use. This recipe is amazing as is but, had to use what I had on hand. First I tripled the recipe.  I used 2 Hillshire farms chicken basil 13 oz pre packaged sausage chopped in small bite sized pieces. I used 3 cans of 15.8 oz great northern beans. I used 1lb of ditalini pasta and 10 total cups of chicken broth and 12 oz cento brand tomato paste (followed the cooking process in order including adding dried pasta to sauté pan. Then Transferred to a large pot after adding tomato paste and approx a 1.5 cups of broth to mixture and simultaneously pre heating 1.5 cups of broth in large pot before transfer). Then added seasoning as suggested with the addition of Added 1/2 tsp pepper, 1.5 tsp of salt, 3/4 tsp dried Italian seasoning, 3/4 tsp dried basil.  Added chard..cooked then added navy beans as per recipe. Removed from heat and added cheese. This was delicious!!!!!

I followed this recipe to a tee. My husband is Italian-American . I am not. My husband has eaten  different variations of this dish in the past. He was extremely impressed. This was one of the most  delicious dishes I have tasted. Thanks chef John for this recipe and you made me look like a rock star in the kitchen!

Pretty good recipe. I used Ditalini Pasta so it took about a cup more liquid using more pasta then the larger ones. Other then that I followed directions and recipe as written. Husband liked it a lot as well.

I made this recipe as written and it turned out great, would change a thing. The noodles continued to soak up the liquid after cooling and storing so the leftovers were a little thick and less like soup, but still great tasting and wonderful to eat.

We couldn't find sweet sausage at the not so super supermarket. It came out super yummy. The teenage boy gave it a thumbs up. Will definitely make this again. 
I ended addin more pasta and had to add more chicken stock.

OH MY DELICIOUS!  LOVE this! Made it and it was easy, one-pot and my husband is on his second bowl.  I shared it with a neighbor and inlaws.  Everyone loves it. I made it exactly as they said - just doubled the recipe.  Thank you for this - it's going to be made ALOT in this Colorado household.

My whole family loved it including my daughter who doesn't normally like anything with beans! The flavor of the sausage really enhances the dish. I used spinach since I did not have Swiss chard at home. I also added a tad more chilli flakes because I like spicy stuff. Thanks Chef John!

It's a keeper! Made as written. Used red Swiss chard because that's what my grocery had and having never eaten Swiss chard, that I am aware of, don't know if there's a difference (or if all Swiss chard is red). Definitely made 4 servings, as others have said. It was soooo good!

It was delicious and easy. I used fresh spinach, since I didn't have Swiss Chard (who does??). Watch the Chef John video to see just how fast it comes together.

It was good but seemed like something was missing. I'd make it again, maybe with more oregano. Also I thought it needed more broth. I added an extra cup of stock.

Made exactly as written and it was indeed delicious, will make again while I search for what's missing?  Had no problems with the pasta or over absorption.  Kept well and a great leftover.  Thank you.

Who knew pasta could have so much flavor? The technique used in this recipe infuses the taste of the sausage, the tomato paste and the broth. Superb!

Made this according to the recipe other than using spinach as we didnt have swiss chard.  It was delicious other than I added too much salt during the cooking process.  Next time I won't add salt until the end when its done.  But I will say this was even better after reheating.  It's delicious and can't wait to make this when it gets cooler out.
