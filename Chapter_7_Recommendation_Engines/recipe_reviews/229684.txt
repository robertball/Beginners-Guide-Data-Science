I've marinated it for two days, it tastes nice, but nothing like Char Siu - the easiest correction Icould think of would be, add much more honey into the marinade.

Didn't have anise or aji mirin, or dark soy sauce.  I substituted white rice wine and normal soy sauce instead.  I doubled the sauce so that the pork was completely covered in a tub and marinated for 2 days.  Hubby loved it!

I quadrupled the marinade to do a couple of pounds of pork tenderloin. Next time I will let it marinate for 2 days, but after one day it was very good. Thanks for sharing!

I did not change anything and it turned out really tasty.
