This broccoli was very good with a few modifications.  Because a few people mentioned it was kind of bland, I added extra paprika, salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese.  Also, I tossed the broccoli with the rest of the ingredients and then roasted it in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Even my kids liked it!!

It tasted great.  Timing is important here.  Make sure you are cooking this right before you are ready to eat.  It cools down fairly fast.

I cooked the broccoli in the microwave as I do 95% of all my vegetables, fresh or frozen.  We liked it but would definitely increase the paprika or maybe switch to my stronger Hungarian variety.  I also added a little extra cheese.

The kids loved the Parmesan cheese flavored broccoli! I cut the amount of butter to 1 T. The cheese, paprika and poppy seeds all adhered to the broccoli with no problem. I omitted the salt and pepper. We will definitely be serving this again!

This was so easy and uber yummy!  It's a quick way to add a vegetable to the meal, and who doesn't love something with butter and cheese!  6 minutes of steaming was perfect on my gas stove.  The broccoli was al dente and not soggy.  This will be a staple in my household.

This recipe was good. I like my broccoli cooked a bit more, so cooked it a bit longer. That's just personal preference though. I also doubled the recipe, but should have cut down on the butter a bit. Double the butter was a bit heavy. Overall, a good recipe though.

Thanks!

Nobody at my house cared for it even though we usually love broccoli. We wanted to try something new but we'll stick to our usual method (broiling for 10 min with a little bit of olive oil and sugar).

Delicious!  I used salted butter, so did not add the salt.  It is so flavorful, it doesn't even need the Parmesan cheese.  Next time I will put it in the steamer basket less than 6 minutes~slightly overcooked.  Makes a wonderful side dish!

Wow, I don't think I'll ever eat broccoli another way.  I ended up using only half of the butter mixture and and 2/3 of the parmesan.  This is amazing!

Not bad, but now wow either. If I ordered this in a restuarant I wouldn't go back just for the broccoli. I'll make it again because it is a different, but I'll add something to it switch it up a bit and give it more life.

I've been wanting a way to spruce up my steamed broccoli. I didn't have the cheese, but I didn't need it. My toddler ate all her broccoli and wanted more. Def a keeper.

I cooked fresh broccoli 13 minutes in the microwave, covered with 1/2 cup of water and a glass lid. Drained well, added the delicious sauce.  Wow, what a wonderful blast of flavor for the taste buds.  Making this for Thanksgiving dinner!

This was good, but not much different than ordinary steamed broccoli with butter.  I should have read the previous reviews more carefully and done something to spice it up.

My family liked it this way.  I just put the broccoli with 1 inch water in a microwavable bowl and covered it with plastic wrap and microwaved 6 mins.  Drain and add the remaining ingredients.  My husband gave it a 3 thumbs up and said I should cook more often.

This was just average. I found the poppyseed to be pointless in the dish. Couldnt see nor taste them at all. I think i prefer roasted broccoli over steamed so i will do that next time instead.

I used sesame seeds instead of poppy seeds. They were still nice for texture. The taste was nice but nothing special. I will fix it again (when i am bored with steamed) but will used cheddar cheese next time at the request of the hubby.

This was just okay.  I added more salt, and like another reader I baked it at the end for a deeper flavor, but it just needed something else, and the poppy seeds disappeared in the dish.  I might try it again someday.

Nice way to fancy up broccoli.  2 cups is really not enough to feed 4 people though.  It's hardly any at all!  I made 8 cups and then doubled the "sauce" part.  It was enjoyed by all.

Don’t change a thing! Frozen or fresh broccoli work fine.  It converted my husband from a broccoli hater to “when can we have it again?”  Easy and yummy!

Easy to do, and turned out pretty much as advertised. Turns out I'm not that big a fan of poppyseed butter, but it was good. I will try the same idea again with differently seasoned butters.

Very good and easy and quick.  Didn't really feel the effect of the poppy seeds.  Would have tasted just as good without them.  But a quick, easy way to enjoy broccoli.

Quite tasty!  I forgot to add the parmesan cheese, but I didn't even notice.  Didn't alter the recipe besides that.  I would definitely make this again.

Not bad, but pretty bland as written.  I tossed in more paprika and used kosher salt and a tad more pepper.  Very easy . . .now I have a lot leftover, though.  I'll have to experiment a little with this one.  thanks for the recipe!

I made this as a last minute side dish. We love broccoli, but steaming it every time just doesn't cut it. I whipped this dish right up and EVERYONE fell in love with it =) I wasn't sure about the poppy seeds, but it came out great! I will cut down on the butter in the future, but other than that the entire bowl was eaten in minutes!!!

Big hit with family. Used pre-shredded romano-parm blend - a little less than called for by recipe.

This was very very good. Our family is huge broccoli lovers and we normally just steam it, but everyone was asking for more. Will double the recipe next time.

We made this recipe because it seemed fast and we love broccoli...however it wasn't as tasty as we would have liked. Maybe a little more experimenting is called for....

I'm always looking for new yummy ways to have a broccoli side dish. This was delish! I could have probably cut it in half and it still would have covered all the broccoli. YUM.

This is really good. I use a little less butter and good quality cheese (used with a cheaper parmesan and it tasted weird) and it's great.

Very good.  My 12 month old liked it too...and it's hard to get her to eat veggies.  I wish it didn't require so much butter.

This was surprisingly good and easy. I used sesame seeds instead of poppy seeds. The buttery sauce with the paprika and pepper really worked well with the parmesan and freshly steamed broccoli. I would think you want to keep the broccoli crisp and serve immediately.
