I made these last night to test before taking them to a cookie exchange. Husband and Son went crazy and can't believe how much they taste like Almond Roca Candy. I wanted something quick, easy and different.  These are it! Here is what I did and it made 3 dozen cookies. I lined a cookie sheet with tinfoil and sprayed a little bit of Pam on foil, used Club Crackers, light brown sugar, Land of Lakes butter,Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet morsels (chopped-melts quicker)and slivered almonds(chopped). When brown sugar and butter were cooking I stirred mixture constantly for 3 minutes at a low boil. I then put sugar mixture in a measuring cup so it would be easier to pour on crackers. Put them in the oven for about 5 minutes, if you see the sugar mixture bubble on the crackers, don't worry it is ok. I take them out of the oven once or twice to push the crackers back in a square with a spatula. I pull them out of the oven and add the chopped morsels, put them back in the oven, turn off the oven and wait 4-5 min for chocolate to melt. I spread chocolate with spoon, add chopped nuts and refrigerate about 4-5 hours, or freeze for 1 hour.  I then cut them into 36 squares with a pizza cutter and it works perfectly.

YUMMY!  I made these to include in the cookie trays I put together to give out as gifts.  I had to HIDE them from my husband so that I would have enough for the trays!  I used club crackers rather than saltines but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  The first batch I made turned out perfectly.  I must not have boiled the toffee long enough for the second batch because I ended up with a very sticky mess the second time. It's very important to start timing the 3 minutes when the mixture comes to a good boil.

I had a TON of crackers leftover from a party so when I found this recipe I decided "why not go for 100?!"   Imagine toffee except not as hard, a cookie but not as sweet, and cooled hardened chocolate with your choice of topping, my favorite was coconut. Beware of over-indulgance & be sure to get all the foil off!!!

I was a bit worried because I've had this cookie before where the soda cracker really stood out and was soggy and tasted stale. But this one was great! I would even say to let it stay in the ref. overnight. My husband took a bite at exactly the 8 hrs. mark and he felt that the cracker stood out. Today, it tastes like toffee and you can barely taste the cracker. Thanks! Great gifts for the teachers.

oh my, how easy!  I always make homemade toffee almond crunch for the holiday trays but d/t time constraints and the interest of the cracker, I decided to try these.  I have to say that these are the closest thing to the homemade toffee crunch that one can get and much faster to make.  Followed recipe exactly with no changes.  I did grind the chips up in my food processor a bit d/t the extra time needed for melting and this was perfectly spreadable after 1 minute in the oven with the oven turned off.  I was concerned about the crackers/toffee mixture shifting, but this was so easily repaired by just putting everything back in place with a spatula.  *take care not to lift the utensil when spreading the chocolate.  I found that when I lifted the spatula while spreading, the toffee would also lift up off the cracker.  Thank you for this super easy recipe with an excellent taste just like homemade toffee.  I too agree that salted saltines add to the whole toffee experience.

Perfectly delicious cookie/bar. I just wish the recipe could have been more descriptive on the cooking of hte bars--After mine had come out of the oven and I'd had some time to think on it, I could have left them in the oven a tiny bit longer to get closer to the Heath bar-esque taste other reviewers have mentioned. When the crackers have been covered in the caramel and are baking in the oven, what you need to look for is when all the bars are bubbly and puffed up. Go a few seconds longer so that they can carmelize and that's when you know they're done. Regarding the chocolate chips, I took the hint of others and slid the whole pan back in the oven--worked well. Also only used semi-sweet chips as I think the milk chocolate would have been too sweet. Really, really interesting cookie to take to a potluck, no one else wil have brought a better sweet treat than you!

Good toffee.  The only problem I ran into was that my cookie sheet's sides weren't high enough: the sugar layer made the crackers spread out while cooking and they almost bubbled over the sides.  Next time I'll make them in a 9x13 pan to trap the crackers in better.

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!  I took these to a finger-food dinner at church last night and they cleaned the plate!  As a matter of fact, when I got my empty plate back, someone had written me a note on a paper napkin:  "These were wonderful!  I would love the recipe" - then they signed it and put their phone number on it!  I have never had such a reaction.  My husband said he heard several people asking who made them!  
I will definitely be making these again!  

The only thing I did different than the recipe was I used sliced almonds which I chopped and then sauteed in butter.  

If I could give this recipe more stars I would...GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!!!!!

WOW these are great! Everyone loved them. I made them this year and gave out little snack baggies full to all we knew. I used a jelly roll pan, foiled lined and sprayed cooking oil on foil. Then lined the entire pan with saltines, poured the sugar batter over and spread it well over each cracker, then repeated the same with the chocolate layer. I made 2 batches this Christmas 2011. It will stay at the top of my gift giving list of homemade things.

These aren't so much cookies as they are a crunchy toffee candy.  They are quite tasty, though.
One word of caution: she's not kidding when she says to watch the cookies closely when they're in the oven -- I had 3 batches start to burn on me, and then you have to throw the whole batch out.
Oh! And a "soda" cracker is a saltine. I had to google to figure that one out. :)

Very easy and everyone at the cookie swap loved them. You definitely need a pan with edges, since it will expand in the oven. The Pam sprayed on the foil before baking made everything very easy to come off.

These should be called "Evil Cookies".  They are ridiculously easy to make, take very little time, and are ADDICTING!  

I didn't have enough milk chocolate chips, so I used about 1/2 cup white chocolate to fill out the 2 cups... I bet using half white half milk would make a nice swirly design on the cookie.  On a whim, I used sliced almonds instead of slivered, and they were awesome.

This recipe is going in my binder!!

Delicious! I was a tad bit skeptical about a cracker cookie, but after all the rave reviews, I figured it was worth the risk to at least try making them.  I was right to do so! These were a hit at home and at work.  My manager asked for the recipe and made them herself for her bridal shower.  Will definitely make them again. (And I did skip the milk chocolate chips and just used extra semisweet chocolate chips--I prefer darker chocolates.)

OMG these are the best, made exactly according to the recipe directions. The hardest part is waiting for them to firm up so the eating can begin. They freeze very well and are excellent to have in the freezer for times when unexpected guests show up, since they defrost quickly. Try experimenting with light, dark, or white chocolate, or different types of nuts... all great!

O....M.....G!  These are SO DECADENT and DELICIOUS!!!  I can't believe they're so easy to make, too.  If you  buy a box of Keebler original "Club crackers" you can make 3 entire trays of these (1 sleeve per tray).  They are so addictive and rich.  I can sure see how they got their name!!  Make excellent Xmas gifts!!

These turned out just like the recipe!  I used regular saltine crackers and lined my sheet with foil and sprayed well with Pam.  Was careful to stir the butter and brown sugar for the full 3 min. after they started to boil and used the measuring cup to pour them on the crackers (good tip).  The choc chips melt after a couple minutes, I just touched them and could tell.  They spread easily with a spatula coated with some lard.  The only thing I added was some additional holiday sprinkles to make them festive!  Wonderful recipe, thank you!

So I read all the reviews and was determines NOT to under boil my sugan and butter... instead I was hesitant about when to start timing the 3 minutes then OVER boiled it... It didn't burn but did have an over cooked taste to it. BEWARE it doesn't have to be a crazy rapid boil to start timing your three minutes! They turned out nice and crisp and really quite good even with the burny taste. I'm sure my next batch will turn out perfect! I made mine in a 9x13 pan lined with foil sprayed with cooking spray. You can't fit all 35 crackers in this way but you end up with very little mess and a nice thick layer of candy! Thanks for a great recipe! Will make often!

These were great- followed the recipe exactly, but used chopped peanuts for the topping. Used parchment paper sprayed with Pam on a cookie sheet, and had no trouble with the crackers moving around. So easy, but so addictive!!

Yep- it's that yummy. And totally easy and fun to make. I only had semi sweet chips, and some whole wheat saltines. Still came out fantastic.

These taste just like almond roca. I took them to church on Sunday and received many compliments and requests for the recipe.  Can't go wrong with this dessert choice.  Also, I froze these and they tasted as good as day one.

Tasted great, but were a little gooey and never really got "solid".  Maybe because I didn't cook it long enough???

what a clever name.  LOVE these special cookies! They are super EASY and very good.  I used chopped walnuts.  I like the idea of adding sprinkles for the holidays, but wouldn't skip the nuts. The salty sweet taste is addicting!  Store in a air tight container if you have any left.   You really should make these, I sure will- again and again.

These cookies are amazing!  My whole family loved them.  We couldn't wait a full 8 hours and ate them about 2 hours of being in the frig.  We couldn't taste the saltines at all.  YUM!  I'll be making another batch tomorrow.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

Easy quick recipe.  I really liked it. My family wished i had made more. I used club crackers instead of the saltines.  It is a rich dessert.

This has got to be one of the easiest recipes I have ever made.  I doubled the recipe and took it to a Christmas party and still had plenty for my own party. Everyone loved it and they were intrigued with the base being a saltine cracker. Give it a try, you won't be able to leave it alone.

We made these with my aunt when I was a child and this recipe tastes exactly how it did back then! My favorite is to break them into cracker sized pieces and freeze them. So delicious!

You absolutely HAVE to make these. So yummy! I second leaving them in the fridge overnight to get rid of any lingering cracker taste and just get crispiness and a toffee flavor. LOVE these and they are now a part of my regular holiday baking rotation!

Awesome recipe! I lined a regular cookie sheet with parchment, then put a single layer of club crackers on it.  Followed the recipe as written except I cut them into bite sized treats while they were still a little warm - pizza cutter works great for this. Anyway, these were a big hit and the parchment made clean up a snap.

Flavor was awesome. I think I did something wrong when boiling the sugar/butter mixture. It didn"t harden up in some places. So if you got the bite that wasn't hardened your teeth would stick together.

People specifically request these cookie bars - they are delicious.  The directions are very easy to follow, work well, and require no changes whatsoever.  I only change it to add more chocolate chips to give a nice, thick chocolate layer!

These are amazing, so easy but fancy enough for giving out as gifts. For Christmas I like adding white chocolate chips instead of chocolate and dried cranberries instead of almonds, very festive...but don't make them because you will eat them all, highly sddictive

the name says it all! these are fantastic. they remind me of a heath bar. i love them with and without the crackers as a base. the club crackers were better than the saltines. just don't overbake because it tastes horrible when burnt. after breaking it in pieces, i froze it in sandwich size freezer bags and pull out a bag every so often. everyone always begs for the recipe so i have learned to carry recipe cards with me when i bring these to parties. thank you thank you thank you!

This was both totally easy to make and eaten very quickly. How can you go wrong with these ingredients? The crackers were fine, and the salt actually helped the flavor come out some, but I think next time I'd experiment with something like graham crackers. Also, the chocolate took a bit longer to melt than the recipe indicated--I just left it in the oven for a few minutes to melt and it was fine. Just don't tell anyone how easy they are to make!

This is an easy recipe and great as written but I prefer using cheap butter crackers instead. It enhances the toffe flavor even more. Thanks for such an addictive treat! (Is that a good thing?)

I just made these... I doubled the recipe so I would have enough for a well-attended Christmas party.  I only used 3/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar and it made the perfect amount.  These were so simple and different from regular cookies... I'll certainly be making them more often.   Thank you!  :)

Fantastic, easy and tastes great.  But one question, I've found my chocolate chips on top after being spread and cooled overnight still stay soft. I've tried it both cooling on the counter and again cooling in fridge.  Meaning it will definitely be melty on your hands After being brought to room temp.   Still they taste great, but how can I give this as gifts if my recipients will get  chocolately hands?  Suggestions please.  Bizeeymom@aol.com

The recipe it self is great but the directions on how to make it not so great.  Candy has a hardening point so you should really over bake this recipe otherwise you end up with sticky gooey sugar instead of the hard toffee that you were looking for.

SO SO YUMMY!  These are super easy to make.  I think it took me 20 mins start to finish and that included washing the pot!  didn't change anything but only had dark chocolate chips on hand so used those...turned out great!  I also only chilled mine for 2 hours in the fridge and they were hard enough to break apart and begin the eating frenzy!!!  My hubby says they taste like Almond Roca and I think they taste like a Heath Bar.  Easy to have all ingredients on hand which is nice.  Will make again...and again.

I have been making this recipe for two years now and people ask me for the recipe time after time.  It is so easy and I can keep the ingredients on hand.  I use 40 club crackers instead of soda crackers and I top it with chopped pecans instead of almonds.  Boiling for 3 minutes is required or your toffee will not set.

I use a jelly roll pan for these, the sides are higher than a cookie sheet. You can change them up with different chips, nuts or whatever! Not that these need anything. They are always a hit and you're sure to bring home an empty plate!

EXCELLENT!!! When you first read the recipe you think "Soda crackers? How is that going to taste."  Well, they are DELICIOUS! I made them for the first time last night and brought them to work for my boss's birthday.  I made a double batch and not only are they all gone, 6 people have asked me for the recipe.  This is a perfect recipe.  They are easy to make and very appreciated by all.  They have really made me popular.

The holidays are the only time I do any baking.  I make 6 or 7 different cookies each year and these will become a regular.  Easy and absolutely delicious.  Already plenty of requests for the recipe!!!

This is my go-to snack when I have to bring a treat somewhere. They always get devoured.  I tried them with graham crackers once, but this version was not as popular. I'll stick to the Club crackers next time.  The bonus is it's so easy and non many ingredients.

I had made these years ago, I think they had called them lazy bark.
my husband likes them with graham crackers and walnuts and the caramel he likes me to make 1 1/2 cups instead of 1 cup.
you can add any nut you like, I do some almond covered and some coconut covered for X-mas gives a different look to each and I make 6 batches for 22 people and we never have any left after Christmas get together. Everyone will ask for the recipe.

I made these last night and they were easy and GOOD! The only thing I'll do differently next time is to maybe melt the chocolate chips and pour it over the top for a less blotchy look.

These were just OK. I thought it was too much chocolate on top and too much butter in the recipe. I did bring it to work and my coworker loved it but for me it's a 3-star recipe. I used graham crackers because that's what I had and as I was cutting the finished cookies, the graham cracker fell off some of the pieces. I used cinnamon graham crackers so maybe that's why it fell off, because the graham crackers have a sugar topping that maybe the butter sugar mixture couldn't adhere to. I suggest applying the butter sugar mixture to the back side of the graham crackers if that's what you are using. Still, I prefer almond roca candy to this. I don't think I'll make this again. It's in the refrigerator and no one is touching it. If it were a 5-star recipe, it wouldn't last 2 days in my house.

I guess it was just too hard for me? Brown sugar on bottom was too much--way to thick a coating. My alien chocolate chips did not melt--even with the oven door shut! Should have ground them up first. Better presentation. Mine did not look good.  I'd like them, methinks, if I lowered the sugar, and chopped the chocolate.

Holy smokes!  These are amazing!!!!  I had to use all milk chocolate chips (because I had run out of semisweet) and substituted the almonds for walnuts because that's what my husband likes.  I can definitely see how these would make you popular.  The perfect combination of flavors.  I'm very impressed.  I will be making these again.  Thank you so much for sharing.

AMAZING!!  Tastes like Almond Roca, but even better! So simple.  I used saltines and popped them into the freezer for 30 minutes, they were perfect.  I think they taste better straight from the fridge or freezer.  These will be on my cookie tray this year!

Made these to send in a care package for my son at military college (VMI). My daughter and I wanted to sample them before we sent them, and well by the time we got done "sampling them there was none left. We had to make another batch to send him. LOVE IT! and so easy!

This recipe is also called "Toffee Bark"  You can change the crackers, nuts and type of chocolate.  I have made these by using graham crackers, semi-sweet chocolate chips and chopped macadamia nuts!  
Just follow the directions exactly as printed.  You will not be sorry,  unless you only make one batch!

A neighbor brought these to a street Holiday party, but wouldn't share her recipe.  I used the ingredient search to find this recipe.  After making them, I think this must be her recipe or close to it.  The ladies at work can't get enough!  It's also so yummy with white chocolate instead of semisweet!

Wow...these are amazing and so easy. I was nervous because i thought I had too much butter/sugar liquid but it turned out great. I was also concerned about my chocolate chips melting but I took the advice of others and just put the pan back in the oven for a few minutes and the chocolate spread easily. Also, don't lift the spatula while spreading the chocolate besause it does pull up the crackers. Great recipe. Thank you for all the tips written in from everyone. Michaela

Hmmm...8 hours?  Mine are sitting in the freezer and they're half gone!  There's nothing to say about this, it's perfect.  Follow instructions, no need to change anything.  I might clarify, wait until it's boiling to time the 3 minutes. I don't know what club crackers are, but with soda biscuits, these taste like a SKOR bar.

A co-worker/friend made this and it was absolutely delish!  Everyone in the office raved over it.  I decided to make it and give in a gift tin.  Well, I went to the store without the recipe and forgot the milk chocolate chips, but luckily, had bought two bags of hershey kisses with almonds. 

I also didn't read the recipe re: the choc. chips (I know... DUMB!! and in a hurry!!) Since I had the kisses, I decided to melt the chips and kisses in a pan.  It was time-consuming, but so far, it looks like it turned out ok... I really probably could have just put the kisses/chips over the toffee and let it melt and it would have been fine.  I did mix in slivered almonds with the chocolate... I haven't tasted it yet, but will come back and let you know how it worked.  Right now... it looks great!!

I made a tin of goodies for the holidays as gifts as this "cookie" was the favorite!!! You DEFINITELY need to use the foil - I even sprayed it with Pam to make sure that the "toffee" didn't stick at all. This is a GREAT recipe and is very esay to make!

These were good but I found the toffee layer to be a little too thick.  They tasted much better the next day. Also good with graham crackers.

The best!  They really do make you popular.  A little difficult to master at first, but by the second batch it all works out!

These were great. This is the second time I've made them, and they're just perfect. So nice to be able to pull all of the ingredients from my pantry and be done in 15 mins...

I decided to make these since I already had everything in the house.  I thought they were ok, but my husband liked them.  I used cashews for the nuts. I did find them a bit hard to break into pieces after they hardened in the fridge.

Very Very good, but you have to watch it closely so the sugar/butter dont burn while it's on the stove as well as when you bake it.

I gave this recipe a four because I found the peices incredibly hard to make let alone cut. I had made it in a pyrex dish as someone had suggested so maybe that was the problem. Also my butter sugar mixture was difficult to even out throughout the cookies. Aside from that good!

The topping was really good, but the cracker wasn't doing it for me.  I'm going to make sugar cookies and then do the same topping to see if I like that better.

I make these all the time.  They are quite rich and delicious. Don't even try one if you are addicted to chocolate; it is very hard to stop eating them.  The only thing I did differently is that I only use good quaility semi sweet chocolate and not milk chocolate

I loved these! I used club crackers and I used toffee instead of the almonds. The only thing I would do differently next time is melt the chips on the stove top. I had a hard time getting them to melt.

Fabulous!  I was looking for a way to get rid of leftover Easter chocolate and this recipe did the trick.  I didn't have almonds on hand so did half coconut and half plain - both were wonderful!  I halved the butter and sugar and still had plenty of caramel to cover a single jelly roll pan of crackers.  I kept these in the fridge as the chocolate is a bit unstable (probably not the case when using regular chocolate chips) but they go fast!  I definitely agree with Mommadonna that these are dangerous for your waistline - watch out!

Very good.  This is a terrific recipe for those times when you need  a special-occasion cookie but have no time to fuss.  I had only semi-sweet chocolate and unblanched sliced almonds on hand.

This is so easy and delicious.  Hard to believe you are not eating real toffee.  Chocolate chips did not melt as quickly as I thought they would.  Next time I might melt them in the microwave instead.  Thanks for the great recipe Alice.

This recipe was Great! The only thing I have to say is when it says "bake 5-6mins watch carefully" It doesn't say what you are watching carefully for... It's the bubbles. Should be a no brainer but I found that out the hard way. My toffee was over cooked by the time I pulled it out. But still Really good!! Will make again and again.. Also If you wanna change it up a little add some crushed pretzles or peanutbutter candy or some kind of other topping ;)

I think I must have made these wrong as they tasted like chocolate covered saltines to me w/ a very thin layer of toffee flaver. The saltines were very apparent and didnt absorb any of the toffee layer. Maybe I spread it too thin? Not sure.

This was 5 stars all the way! i had no idea they would turn out so wonderful. It was easy and fast to make and the directions were perfect. I used salted soda crackers and unblanched almonds but will experiment with other toppings the next time, maybe coconut. Will definately make these time and time again.

These were delicious!  I thought it sounded strange to add crackers to the cookies, but they turned out great! When they are broken up, you can't even tell that there are crackers in them.  The recipe was real easy to make too.  Here in California we have See's candy...these were as good as See's which are my favorites!

This is a bit hit every holiday! My mother-in-law gave me this recipe years ago and it will be a lasting tradition in our house. I prefer the buttery flavor of club crackers over the saltines.

Made this last year, and it was everyone's favorite.  My husband was calling them "crack cookies" .  Followed the recipe but exchanged chopped walnuts for slivered almonds.

Agreed, it works really well, super simple, tastes just like almond Roca. For me, the chocolate overwhelmed the toffee even though I used a little less than was called for, so I will use half next time. I sprinkled a pinch of salt on top with the almonds

These are fantastic! The second time around I used all semi-sweet chips and walnuts just because that is what we prefer in our house! I also prefer to freeze for an hour and then store in the fridge for I cannot wait 8 hours! Thank you for this recipe! Reader beware - you will be tempted to eat the entire pan! Haha.

I have made this several times now and it comes out perfect every time. I make it exactly as written however I think you could change it up with different flavored chips or sprinkles , other nuts etc which I will try this year.

I made these to include in treat boxes for my coworkers at Christmas.  Everyone LOVED them!  This recipe is super easy, and a huge hit every time I've made it.  Last time, I used Hershey's special dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate.  It was so much better!  The dark chocolate complimented the sweet toffee perfectly!  I recommend storing these in the fridge for 24 hours to make sure the chocolate really sets up.  Even then, it will still melt a little on your hands when you eat them.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  Super rich, though.  An EASY 5 stars were it a bit less sweet.  I may try using a little less sugar next time.  My hubby doesn't each chocolate, so I substituted peanut butter chips and toffee bits for the chocolate.  SOOOO good!

My first mistake was following the directions and carefully counting out 35 crackers. I should have filled the cookie sheet with crackers because the caramel that ran off the crackers burnt in four minutes and the chips would not melt.

I can't thank you enough for this recipe!!  I used this recipe for a baking party during the holiday season and it was a hit.  It was so easy to make that I decided to make it for my family's Christmas party.  I hosted Christmas this year, which means that I was busy cooking in the kitchen and the last thing I wanted to worry about was dessert.  Used this recipe and it was gone within minutes!

I didn't have saltine crackers but I did have the oyster shaped version and I was able to substitute them. The caramel mixture spread while it was in the oven but I was able to push it back around the crackers. I used all milk chocolate chips on top. Very salty and sweet in the same bite!

Love love loved it! Simple and delicious! I'm not a fan of nuts in my desserts so instead of almonds I added a little bit of sea salt. My family was in love with these, my brother-in-law couldn't stop eating them! I do have to say that the kids weren't too crazy about them, but hey that's fine by me, leaves more for the adults! Oh and the chocolate on top I used a bag and a half of all semi-sweet chocolate chips. This recipe lends itself to a variety of toppings, I was thinking pistachios (my favorite nut) or unsweetened coconut would be great on top. I will definitely make these again!

I didn't like this as much as I thought I would. Honestly, if I were to make these again I would cut the amount of butter I used in half. To me, using a cup of butter gave it a yucky buttery taste which I also think might have added to the trouble I ran into trying to spread the chocolate.

Fabulous!!!! They were so easy to make that we were not prepared for how fantastic the end result was.   I didn't change a thing; lined a jelly roll pan (10"x15") with parchment paper, used Club crackers, made sure to boil at a full rolling boil for three minutes, then baked for 8.  The caramel melted and soaked into the crackers beautifully, and once topped with chocolate and almonds, it was very pretty.  It looks like something that was much more difficult to prepare, so I think this might be our Holiday gift candy this year!

I have made these twice so far and both times they have disappeared in no time!  They are so easy to make and taste just like my favorite...Heath Bars!  You'd never guess they were made with saltines.

I have to say these cookies weren't very popular in my house. None of us liked them at all. It is a very easy recipe to make. I followed it to a tee. It does make a lot this would be great for a get together. This recipe just wasn't for my family but it maybe for your family. Give it a try and see for yourself.

OMGosh.... I made these 2 days ago and they are SO SO SO good. When I first took them out of the fridge and tasted them, I didn't really care for them. After they sat on the counter for a few hours, they were AWESOME! I didn't change anything in this recipe, all I did was toast the almonds. :) YUM!!

These are very good.  The buttery caramel flavor is a great combination.  I used club crackers.  I also used cocoa dusted peanuts instead of almonds.  I already had the peanuts.

Wasn't impressed. I sprinkled the chocolate chips, as directed, and when they melted, tried to spread them but they wouldn't spread. They clumped with the 'toffee' part.

I used graham crackers as an alternative and what a great idea!  I also added some variety by using the milk and semi sweet chocolate chips on some of the crackers.  I also used gingerbread flavor and egg nog flavor baking chips on the crackers.  What a huge hit!

I tried to make this tonight.  All went well until I put the tray back in the oven to melt the chocolate .  It was too hot.  My mistake,  I think on next try I will melt chocolate separately and use peanuts instead of almond.

Interesting. Not my forte. I think I'd like it better if it was more milk chocolatey. I don't know. If you have a crowd looking for something interesting, this is good. Otherwise, there are way tastier desserts to make.

Wow. So okay, the first time I made these I didn't read the recipe properly and rather than boiling the butter and sugar I just warmed it enough to melt the butter. This lead them to being less like a hard toffee and more like a sticky caramel. We really enjoyed them but I thought it best to try again and do it as described in the recipe. The second time I boiled the mixture and I would have appreciated a short description of what it's supposed to look like at this stage just to reassure me I'm doing it right. Anyway it all went as planned and the cookies were harder this time and now I'm not so sure which way I liked them better! Regardless I think this is a great, easy recipe and the only change I will make is to just use one type of chocolate chip as once melted and spread around they all mixed together anyway. I've taken to calling them Toffee Crackers as it gives a little idea about what they are like. Thanks for the recipe!!

Quick. Easy. Staples most have on hand. Addictive. Perfect for bake sales. I like to gather up some  small pieces and put them out for samples.

These are the easiest and most requested cookie I make between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It's amazing how easy, yet how good they are.  I have learned from experience though to get GOOD chocolate chips.  Some of the cheaper brands don't melt right and just make an ugly mess. If you are not already familiar with the chips, save yourself some heartache and go for Nestle or Hershey's.

This is a staple for our Christmas Eve party! Since my oldest is allergic to almonds, I substituted sea salt in place of the almonds...lightly sprinkled.  So EASY!!! Thank you for sharing!

So easy and so delicious! The only challenge is keeping the crackers in place while spreading the melted butter and sugar mix.

Really easy and really good...keep them in the fridge or freezer so they stay crunchy...I am in California and it was unusually warm this Thanksgiving so they got a little warm and melty in the kitchen.  I ate half of them :)

Yummy.  I left out the nuts and used pilsbury club crackers and they turned out great. Next time I might use extra chocolate and put pieces of a toffee candy bar on top while the chocolate is cooling. I think it would taste even better with a thicker layer of chocolate on top. Maybe even make two batches and stack one over top of the other, then add  chocolate again. I
