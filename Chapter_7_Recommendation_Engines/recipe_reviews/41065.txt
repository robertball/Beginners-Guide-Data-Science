This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made.  I made it for the holidays and everyone loved it.  It is sooo good.

It was ok.  The flavor was more of pumpkin pie than a cheesecake and I prefer a dry cheesecake to the creamier ones.  If you are a lover of true cheesecakes, this is not for you, but if you like cheese pie type desserts, this was perfect.  The flavor was good tho.
