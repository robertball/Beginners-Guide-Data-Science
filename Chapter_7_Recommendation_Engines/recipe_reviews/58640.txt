READ THE REVIEWS! THEY GIVE YOU TIPS!
I found something out that might help some of you.  I also was having problems while folding it and it breaking. What I learned is: Yes, the texture should be like a pancake (so I did have to add more water to mine because it was thick) BUT in addition, once it's put on the cookie sheet, it should NOT be like a pancake but more like a crepe. You've reeeally gotta thin it out with a spoon. Too thick and it'll break. You know you've got it thin enough when you pick it up and it feels like you're flinging a piece of rubber around. If it feels like a thin cookie---too thick still.

I loved this recipe!  My 10 year old was able to make these for her friends.  The only thing I did different was to increase the water to 4 T. Making them less pancakey.Using the back of a spoon to spread them out before cooking gives them more of an even consistency.  Bake a little longer till about a forth to a third is golden brown.  Fold them in half, lightly grab the top and use an edge of a glass or bowl to get the horseshoe shape then put them in a muffin pan to cool.  We made two on a pan and rotated the pans.  It sounds complex but once you get the motion in order they are so easy.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made these cookies for a project in school and we found it best to use the batter warm (room temp.) and do three at a time. wait until the edges are golden/crisp then w/ two people have one remove cookie and the other fold the cookie then put them in small muffin tins to bake more until golden all over then cool (still in the muffin tin).

I hate false advertising- but this recipe is telling the truth! 'So easy-' and so good! They were nice and sweet, even though they didn't have the lemon flavor of your classic restaurant cookie. But they were fun to make, though I strongly remcommend having a lot of elbow room and fast moving fingers. If you are planning on popping fortunes in these, wait a few seconds to insert the paper, otherwise it will stick to the cookie and your fotune will be 'You will eat a piece of paper and choke.'

Ok everyone, these are easy with some tips. Put the oven to 350, not 375. Grease cookie sheets really, really well. I added more water to thin the dough and added no vanilla extract, all almond and about 1 tsp. I used a old metal cookie sheet, not an airbake. Spread dough out THIN, bake 4 minutes, flip cookies over bake 30 seconds more. Work really quick, and these look just like the real things!

my daughter and I just made these. We compared this recipe with another one she found on another site. the only difference was water was increased to 3 tablespoons and butter to 6 tablespoons. I thought these would be so difficult but that was not the case. She wanted to make them for a friend who is leaving town. They turned out so nice!!! We only did 4 at a time to ensure time to fold before they started to crack. We let them get good and brown on the edges, folded then placed in a mini-muffin tin to hold the shape. Just wonderful and tasted so much better than store bought. Thanks Babycakes!

I really enjoyed these.  I found that if you heated the pan before putting the cookies on they spread into circles easier.  I only put two cookies in the oven at a time.  Also, as a preference, I doubled the vanilla.

Very yummy!  I changed the 1/4 tsp vanilla and almond extract to 1 tsp. of vanilla.  The batter tasted very much like flour before I increased the extract.  I also added water to make it thinner.  It was much easier to spread.  Try to get the middle as thin as possible as it tends to be cake-like and breaks apart or cracks pretty easily.  I found that I had much more time to shape them then I thought I would and could make four at a time. You might need a towel to shape them as they stay very hot for awhile. I also must have made them larger then intended, because the recipe only made 20.  I'll be making these again!

I used powdered egg whites and margarine, the heated pan really helped, but I thinned it with a spoon back on the pan and towards the end of the batch added a tad of water to thin, you can only do 4 at a time, but it was a blast, after making 100 I had hot hands but the partygoers LOVED them!!!(usig the cup lip to make the horseshoe was easier)Would do it again for the next party with the birthday wishes inside, THANK YOU!

I agree that these take some practice, but it's well worth it.  I ended up making two batches and the first was an edible practice round;)  Some notes I took away: * I baked these on an ungreased (non stick) stovetop griddle/grill surface and had no problems with sticking.  Actually, I discarded the cookie that I made on a greased surface because it really accelerated the browning process and they weren't as pretty. * The first batch, exactly as directed, was delicious but tasted a little grainy.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 c the second time and didn't have the same problem--they were still perfectly sweet.  When I make these again I may use an ultrafine sugar instead. * I took the previous reviews too far on batch #1 and got preoccupied with adding extra water.  I think I used a bit too much, and this may have caused the grainy texture as well.  My "giving" batch was about the consistency of tacky glue and spread and baked beautifully.  Just made these as gift tags for holiday gifts and I'm thrilled.  Far less complicated than I anticipated and I will try them again and again.  Thank you!

This is my first time making fortune cookies, and they came out AMAZING. They were delicious and fun to make. One of the things I loved is that I had all they ingredients in the hous already. I'm definitely going to make them many times more! The only think I didn't like was the taste was a bit too sweet.

Delicious!  They were the hit of the party.  They were for a poker party and so I made the fortunes contain words related to poker.  The cookies were more delicious than typical fortune cookies.  They were like sugar cookies.  It was not easy to fold while hot and I could only bake a few at a time in order to get to all of them before they cooled too much to fold and form.  I recruited my husband to help put the fortunes in and fold them and we had fun with it as well as coming up with the fortunes.  Some of the fortunes kind of melted and got stuck in the cookie, so next time I will try not to fold them when they are too hot, but not really sure how to prevent that.  Definitely grease the cookie sheets well and only bake a few at a time.

I made over 100 of these cookies...  Lot's of trial and error, but came up with the perfect one.  Some suggestions are, water the batter down to a thin pancake like mixture.  Don't use anything but a metal pan.  You don't need to grease the pan, there's already enough butter in the batter.  Use about one tbl. spoon of batter for each cookie.  This will give you a little larger than "average" fortune cookie.  When spreading the batter onto the pan, you want to barely cover it.  Even when you think it's too thin a layer, spread it out more.  Hope this helps.

It's ridiculous how easy these are! You want to wait until the edges are really starting to golden before removing them, be prepared to get slightly burnt fingers! I added a little more water to thin, the thinner you can make these the better.

They tasted good, but they took an hour to make.  Too much investment for poor payoff.

WOW THESE ARE AWESOME! they tasted EXACTLY like good fortune cookies! I used these for a friend's birthday party and they were absolutely a hit! I'm going to use them for valentines day, as well, and put red food coloring in them, to make them pinkish. I will definitely use this again! oh, by the way, i took a batch out too soon, and they were a bit chewy...but my friends said those were even better, and they asked me to make them chewy for valentines day.

This came out perfectly. It did take a few tries to get the folding right but the Youtube video out there showing how to do it really helped. I added 4 additional TBSP of water to get the right consistancy and cooked them for 5 min. I was only able to do 3 at a time. The only downside is, because of the greasing of the cookie sheet, the fortunes get all greasy. I'm going to try using a silpat next time.

It's easier to fold these over the edge of a cup.  I sues a shallow one then let them cool inside the cup.  I have made these several times.  With a little practice they turn out great.  I have always had a little trouble with the fortunes sticking to the cookie. I have wrapped the fortunes in waxed paper before, but would rather not have to do this.   Any ideas?

Calling all fortune cookie makers ... I tried this recipe and although the taste was right-on I had trouble getting the cookies crisp enough. In addition my fortunes stuck to the cookie. The only thing I changed was adding water to get the pancake consistency. Too much water maybe? Anyone else have this issue?

Ok, so the cookies are delish, but if there is one thing I learned from studying in culinary school in hong kong that when making the cookie all you do when at the folding part is to fold them in half and lightly press the folded part on the edge of a glass you know like the rim until they are the desired shape:P

It's probably not the recipe's fault, but out of the 36 this was supposed to make, I only managed to shape 4 (using about half of the batter). You've got to work REALLY fast. Also, grease like crazy!!! The main reason why mine failed was because it stuck to the sheet (I used tinfoil with butter, so I'm not sure how it would be different with parchment paper or whatever). They are REALLY hot coming out of the oven, so be careful! I ended up using a spatula to hold the edge down when I folded it. Good luck, but be sure that you know how hard and frustrating this recipe is!

I practiced this recipe a couple times because I wanted to get it right.  The first couple of times I adjusted and added more water to thin it out like others suggested and I had more trouble than before.  This morning the kitchen was under a spell i guess because it was easy! I used the recipe scaled for 24 cookies and only added an extra t of water and they were just right!  I can't believe they aren't even chewy in the center!  So Delicious!  Just be careful when folding them, buttering your fingers helps!

I thought of making these for my two kids' Valentine's day card distributions at school and I thought it would be so cute to put personal fortunes inside. I just made these tonight (over 70 of them so I had to more than double the recipe). To be honest, I was a bit nervous these might not turn out well...but, guess what, they turned out great! Maybe because I was doing so many at once I got the hang of it after folding about two of them. What helped me was when I was at Walmart, during Valentine's season, they had a "fortune making kit" that sold for $9 (to make 10 cookies) and I just thought that was so expensive, I decided to copy their pictures that showed how to fold them (which helped tremendously, by the way). The parchment paper is the way to go because I used a spatula to remove them and they came right off. When they were nice and golden brown on the edges, what I did was take only one out at a time so I can concentrate on the shape. So, using the "Walmart" fortune cookie making kit method, after I placed the fortune inside, I folded it in half, used a rim of a mug to place the middle of the cookie on the rim and then folded the outer two edges down, which helped shape the cookies to their natural fortune cookie shape, just like the ones you find at a Chinese restaurant! It ended up being so easy to make.  I had fun making them but they were definitely labor intensive and the fact that I was making over 70, it took me several hours to finish the entire batch.

batter way way to thick.  had to at least double the water in the recipe then smoothed them out with a wet flat spatula.  they tasted fabulous but still too thick to fold well. still were adorable and looked like fortune cookies. my kids loved them and got tons of oohs and ahhs at school international food day. will use my french tuille cookie recipe that is similar and rolls like a pencil to see if I can figure out the water/thinness questions.

these are not for the faint of heart... i found them to be anything but "easy." the recipe as is results in a batter that is too thick and will not permit shaping.  i added A LOT more water to get the consistency of thin pancake batter.  they are very tricky to get just right, although the taste is MUCH better than a normal fortune cookie... however that's assuming that you are able to get them to look like a fortune cookie!  there's a video on YouTube that shows you how to fold them and they actually have a completely different recipe, i might try that next time. good luck!  you'll need it.  OVERALL SCORE> taste 4 stars, presentation 2.

Do not use parchment paper for these, grease a cookie sheet or your cookies might end up chewy like mine.  I also doubled the amount of water to thin out the batter.

I have to disagree wih the little write-up. These are BETTER than any fortune cookies I have ever had from a Chinese restaurant!  I did have to add a little more water to the recipe. Our higher altitude might have been the reason for that. My son took these to school as Valentine's - they were a big hit.

Tried many different ways to bake/fold these with no good cookies.  Too cake like.  Imagine trying to fold a sugar cookie.  The under baked ones crumbled and the over baked ones broke while the cookies baked exactly according to the directions folded like paper then broke.  Too greasy so the papers became illegible after absorbing the grease.

I also had to thin the batter a little more...about 2 tbsp...make them very thin...much easier to work with. I had trouble with shaping at the beginning. Just bake 2 at a time until you get it. Take one cookie out at time, lay it on the counter, put your fortune in, fold it in half away from you and pull the two ends together towards you while using your thumbs to push the middle of the cookie up. I messed up about 6 cookies before I got it, but don't give up. Once you get it, its easy and fun! Everyone loved them!

Although the cookies tasted good and look like fortune cookies they do not taste like a fortune cookie. I think that 3/4 sugar is too much, and if there is going to be that much sugar there should be able 1-1/2 cups of flour. The amount of sugar really made the cookies taste like a sugar cookie. Also, for personal reference I added some more almond extract I thought it tasted much better.

I tried making these fortune cookies for a party and did exactly as the recipe said.  When they came out of the oven they were very cakey.  I tried folding them and they ripped in the middle.  I read other reviews saying they were excellent and I'm wondering if there is a secret to it.  So many people said they worked out great and were better than ones at a chinese resturant.  Mine were like thick pancakes.  Oh, well!  I guess I'll just keep trying out different variations or something...

Ugh! These would actually taste decent... IF they'd actually leave the baking sheet! Definitely either use a miraculously un-sticking sheet (I didn't have parchment paper) or grease like there's no tomorrow! I found, however, that greasing TOO much makes the cookies a bit salty (I used margarine)... Also, the middle often stays chewy while the sides already start burning, so either make the center very thin, or lower the heat. I've also added quite a lot of water because it wouldn't spread. I guess I'd try this recipe again, but only when I'll find a way to unstick those cookies...

My kids and I made fortune cookies for valentines day at school. Since we were making so many we had a chance to try multiple recipes, 6 to be exact. One was from Martha Stewart, one from Paula Dean, others from different online recipe sites and this recipe. We saved one cookie from each recipe and had a fun family taste test. The results......This cookie is the WINNER!! Best tasting, easiest to make, not to thick, JUST RIGHT! Thanks

I have made this three times, and it's always such a crowd-pleaser!  I get so much compliments!  I use 2x the water called for, otherwise the batter was too thick.  I like to dip the fortune cookies in melted chocholate candy (Wilton's) and add sprinkles.  It's great for parties!

In my opinion you should just make them into cookies. I found the batter very sticky. When the time came to fold them, it just broke in half. but the taster of the cookie was pretty good.

these were so fun to make!  we had them a little too thin at first, but the suggestion for the warm pan proved to work well for us.  We only let the outsides brown a little, no problems with cracking once we got going.  One tip from us...  we didn't have almond extract, so opted for orange extract and it was delicious!  We transported them in mini muffin tins so they wouldn't get crushed.  Thanks for the fun!

I love the way they taste, but I've got to be doing something wrong about shaping them. Obviously to shape them before they cool and harden you have to take them out of the oven and  shape them right away.  Youch!!! I've burned my finger tips. If thats the way it is then I'm not making them again.

The cooked batter was delicious. However, I don't know what I was doing wrong but these were hardly easy. The batter is super thick, I had to add a good 4 more tablespoons of water to make it thin enough to spread thinly. If at all too thick, they end up like crepes. They don't cook evenly so the edges may be brown but the middle is still spongy and cracks when you try to fold them. Folding them is a slightly painfully hot experience, not recommended for kids with tender fingers! I consider myself a fairly experienced cook and baker and just can't figure out what went wrong here... I give it 5 stars for taste, but 2 for end result!

ummm, I don't think fortune cookies should have butter in them... it makes them too chewy and the fortunes just absorb the grease so they're all translucent.  It was an easy recipe and they tasted good...but I wouldn't make them again.

This recipe did not work at all for me.  I tried several times and was so excited to use it, but it really did not work.  Disappointed....
After reading everyone else's comments, I have to agree, the batter needs a lot of thinning, and it would really have helped to have two people working on it instead of one.  The cookies need to be immediately used on removing from oven, and crepe-thin.  Too labor intensive for what I was intending, which was to make a whole bunch of them in one evening.  The cookies themselves, while failures as fortune cookies, were delicious.

OMG!OMG! First of all the recipe does not tell you how thin to make the 3 inch circles. I made the frist batch and they turned into chips.  Second batch was too thick. The batter was not teh consistency of  pancake batter so I had to add more water to thin it out.

Was a good idea, came out ok.  Tasted good but were not crunchy.  I tried cooking longer but could not fold.  Were fun though, easy to make

These taste great! I'm sure it was my fault that I couldn't get them to fold right but they were Very good! I will continue to attempt to master the folding with this recipe. :)

First, these taste nothing like the ones you get in a chinese restaurant, they are so much better!  I did have to thin the batter a little more than the recipe called for, and I was making them a little bit too thick.  The whole process is trial and error, but the end result is great!

Not that easy to make. Just could not get them to turn out. I tried a lot of different times and nothing.

Tasted good but didn't work. I took them out when the edges browned, but they were spongy like a pancake and didn't fold properly :( They weren't easy!!

They're a great novelty (I made "Spooky Fortune Cookies" for a Halloween party I went to), and taste pretty good, but they are VERY difficult to work with.  It's hard to strike a balance between making them too cake-like and making them too crisp so that they won't fold properly.  I had to put them in muffin tins to keep them together.  Would I make them again?  Perhaps, but only for its novelty value.

This recipie is AWESOME!!!! I loved it and the instructions on how to fold the cookies are PERFECT!!!!! The only problem is it is a little dificult to get the cookies to not be pancakey, yet not too crispy one the edges!!! These cookies even taste good Pancakey.

The recipe "as is" has problems.  I always make a recipe as it states the first time and this one needs lots of help.   First--way too much butter.   Next time, I'd cut the butter almost by half.   Also, batter too thick.    I'd add more liquid next time.   They are also kind of tasteless and not very sweet, but the flavor and mouth feel could have been dampened by the excess butter called for in the recipe.   I think they'd also be better with unsalted butter.

It did take me a couple of tries to get it right. I tried to add more water,  didn’t spread it thin enough.  I ended up   Baking on a silicone baking pad and parchment paper. (Alternating pans, 2 at a time, both worked,  just make sure parchment doesn’t get wrinkles).  I doubled the recipe twice, had to make 135 cookies for coworkers.
I found that following the recipe precisely and thinning out to about 4” diameter circles allowed me to put the fortune in without it getting stuck.

I tested two fortune cookie recipes and this one was the winner. I made these fortune cookies as a class activity with my daughter's fourth grade class. They were delicious! The kids made up the fortunes and I took them home and baked them up. I made the recipe as directed except I did need to add extra water to thin the batter out a bit in order to get the  pancake batter" consistency. I also found it helpful to heat the cookie sheet in the oven before putting the batter on it as previous reviewers suggested. I will definitely make these again!

Made the cookies 3 inch circles and they expanded to be huge!!!!! Way too difficult to fold. Trying again now and hopefully it turns out better. Any tips?

I made mine to thick, only 2 that were actually pleasant looking. The batter tasted good. :)
