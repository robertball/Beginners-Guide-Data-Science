WOW!!!  Just wow!  This punch is as gorgeous as it is delicious--even the beer-loving men in my large dinner party group went back for seconds!  The orange liqueur and champagne dampened down the sweetness for a perfect flavor blend.   I couldn't find frozen cranberries at 3 different stores so I just bought fresh.  Also didn't bother with the rosemary skewers--we made a double batch and the expense would've added up.  Will absolutely make this again--can't imagine my Christmas dinners without it now!

Loved this! While I love the taste of a traditional mimosa, the acid in the orange doesn't always love me. On that note, I'll sub the orange liqueur for more champagne next time. The tartness of the cranberry juice is all that it needs. Not sure about the pink hue the recipe submitter mentioned? The cranberry juice overpowered the drink color wise making it more red. Perfect for Christmas if you ask me. This is a great drink with or without the sugared cranberries and rosemary!
