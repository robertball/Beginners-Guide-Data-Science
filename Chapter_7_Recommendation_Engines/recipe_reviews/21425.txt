I let the fruit soak in the rum and an added 1/2 cup of Triple Sec.  I made this with a Merlot (Little Penguin) and with a Blackberry Merlot.  It was a lot sneakier when it was made with the Blackberry Merlot, i.e. we got drunk, but it hit us from out of no where.  When it was made with the Little Penguin Merlot, it was a little too alcoholic.  I solved this by having friends who are alcoholics and don't mind.

I made this for a cookout for my husband's medical school class, and it was a big hit. I used a box of cheap red wine (5 liters for $10.00)and as was suggested, I used spiced rum. I also added lots of other fruit, including apples, pears and cherries, which was really pretty in the glass pitchers. I did have to keep a close eye on the fruit soaking in the rum and sugar that was in the refridgerator, because every time I went to make more sangria, I had to fight off people eating the fruit. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

OH MY!! This was fabulous! I used the spiced rum and along with the citrus I added some plum slices. If you desire a less potent Sangria cut the rum in half. The flavor is still wonderful. Freeze orange juice in ice cube trays and add a cube to each individual serving. YUM

I just got back from Seville and this was so close to the real thing...Two glasses will have you GOOD for the rest of the night.  Start out with less rum-- you can always add more later.

This was my first attempt at Sangria.  I took the advice of others and used Blackberry Merlot, as well as spiced rum.  I topped each serving with Sprite, and it was fantastic!  When the Sangria was gone, I filled the pitcher with the remaining Sprite, so it could "soak up" the juices left in the fruit.  It was a more "mellow" drink, which was needed after finishing the pitcher of Sangria.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I read the reviews and went with the Blackberry Merlot and cut the white sugar in half. I made a triple batch, but only used a fifth of Bacardi white rum. I also soaked the fruit for 2 days, turning it twice a day to make sure it all got nice and soaked.  Nectarines, Lemons, Limes, Apples, Oranges, Strawberries were what I used.  Next time, much more strawberries and maybe 1 lemon and more oranges.  I thougt of using Orange flavored rum and cut out all the white sugar, but thought I should just change one thing at a time.  Wonderful, the fruit and drink was gone in no time.

This was very good as well, but I changed the recipe a bit.  I used a 1.5 liter bottle of wine, 2 cups of rum, 1 cup of sugar, and 2 cups of OJ.  My grandma even went wild over it.  I also soaked strawberrys, pineapple, and marschino cherries in equal amounts of OJ and Rum overnight and that was very, very good as well. I did not add the fruit to the sangria, I put it in a seperate bowl so people could pick out what they wanted.  It worked out well.

This is a fabulous recipe!!  I have shared with many friends.  It was easy to make, and everyone enjoyed it.  Careful though. It tastes like fruit juice, but you feel the effects of the alcohol later.  Great to make for large parties.

Made a double batch for my husband's 50th birthday party and didn't have a drop left. Used spiced rum and made ice rings from fruit and Sprite (so they wouldn't dilute it). Fabulous!

This tasted great! I've never had Sangria but my "Sangria expert" guest said it was perfect. I doubled the recipe for a party of 12 and put it in a punch bowl and it made for a great presentation. Tasted very nice and looked good. Just make sure you stir it whenever you are walking by after mixing all the ingredients to dissolve all the sugar.

Made this for my girlfriends surprise party, everyone loved it and had seconds. Made a double batch and left it overnight and it was gone in no time. I'm definitely going to make this again. Blackcurrant Merlot and Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum is the way to go! I only put a 1/4 cup of sugar and that was sweet enough.

I made this recipe for a tapas themed party with friends from college. I thought this was a killer sangria and enjoyed it thoroughly. My friends were overwhelmed by the rum -- fortunately, you can add rum to taste for your guests. Buy smaller oranges and other fruits to fit in the pitcher. This is a great recipe! I'll make it again for sure; so easy!

WAY GOOD!!! Apples worked just fine. Also works well with brandy instead of rum. I have made this several times with various fruits {the produce kind as well as my friends}and every time was awesome! Thanks!   Erin

I used a very cheap bottle of Sangiovesse from Trader Joes and the cheapest white rum I could find.  Following the recipe exactly....it's perfect.

I think in the future I will put the sliced fruit, rum, sugar & OJ in a zipper bag and freeze, pop it into the ice chest along with a cheap bottle of wine and take camping.

Great!! Big hit at mexican-themed party we recently held.  I think there were only about 6 of us drinking it, and we went through almost 3 batches!  Went down nice and smooth, as long as it's cold!

This was my first sangria making experience, and I'm glad I followed this recipe.  I used spiced rum and Cab Sav.  I messed up and added the wine and OJ with the booze and fruit (which turned out fine), and I let everything soak for 24 hours.  This was less popular at my party than the White Peach Sangria also found on this site.

This was such an easy recipe! I did add 1 cup sugar and used 1/2 brandy along with the 1 cup of rum.  I also filled glasses 3/4 way and topped it off with 7-up.  It was too strong without it for our tastes.....Love this drink!!!!!!!!!

Fabulous!  My first sangria made and it was an absolute HIT with a very large party.  I did read all the reviews and made slight modifications.  I went crazy with the fruit selection and skipped on the lemons.  I added a lime, an orange, 2 kiwi's, cherries  (sliced and pitted - fresh), raspberries (fresh), fresh apricots (sliced), 1 apple (sliced), 1 peach (sliced), and 2 pears (the red kind).  I chose for my wine Sutter Home White Merlot. I was very nervous about the wine choice but White Merlot is not sweet like Arbor Mist yet not as "dry" as a red table wine/merlot/cab/pinot noir.  I still added the sugar and the Orange Juice.  

Note: I went with a few reviews and used the Bacardi Razz Rum (raspberry rum) and used the full 1.5-2 cups.  However, I used that amount with 2 1.5 L bottles of wine so I would agree that if I was making this recipe as originally stated I would use no more than 1 cup of rum.  

HUGE hit.  Brought it to a friend's family party where people were being conservative in drinking alcohol and it was gone within 2 hours flat.  

The best part (and no-waste part)...we took the remains home (the fruit) and food processed it into a HUGE batch of smoothie for tomorrow night.  VERY potent and super yummy.  

Stay Green!

EXCELLENT! I ADDED STRAWBERRIES, PINEAPPLE, OJ, PINEAPPLE JUICE, AND A SPLASH OF SPRITE. I HAD TO MAKE 3 MORE BATCHES OF IT THROUGHOUT THE PARTY. IT'S GREAT, BUT IT WILL SNEAK UP ON YOU. THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE.

This is now my staple for parties.  I use Captain Morgans for the rum and lots of fruit, apples & pears.  Yes they do soak up the rum but mmmmm are they delicious.  People love my "happy apples".

a wonderful recipe. i added lots of different types of fruit. i loved it as is, but i made this for my family and they had to add lots of sprite because it was so strong and a little extra sugar too. i recommend trying it as the recipe says and adjust to your own taste once it's finished.

WOW! I followed this recipe to a T and was it ever STOUT! Good  but man it packed a punch. Oh and caution to those of you who make it, the lemon and lime seemed to be fine but eating the rum soaked orange will light you up! Not sure how it is any different than the other two fruits but my oh my did it ever absorb the alcohol. Cheers!

I make this for any party or large get togther we have.  It gets rave reviews and I don't have to spend most of my time mixing cocktails.  I have also subbed peach schnapps for the rum, peach nectar for the OJ, and white wine for the red, to make a white peach sangria. It also got raves.

Very good! Lots of requests for the recipe.  Used the Blackberry Merlot, Capt. Morgan's Spiced Rum, and tons of fruit. I also cut out the Sprite.    I soaked the fruit for two days. Huge hit at the 4th of July picnic.  :)

I served this with the Spanish paella recipe and they were both big hits at my dinner party.  Plus I only had about 1/3 cup orange juice so I used 100% grape juice to make up the difference.  The sangria was still very nice. Highly recommended.

This is my go to basic sangria recipe.  I took another reviewers advice and used Blackberry Merlot instead of dry red wine.  This also eliminates the need for the 1/2 cup of sugar since the Blackberry Merlot is a sweetened wine.  I like using spiced rum such as Captain Morgans.  I soak the fruit (I usually add strawberries) in the rum several hours before putting the other ingredients.  A bonus is getting to eat the rum/wine soaked fruit afterwards :)  Very yummy, there are never any leftovers!!

This is a perfect sangria recipe. Without changing a thing, it tasted delicious (and it packs QUITE the punch). I mixed some with ginger ale and it was good, but everyone preferred the classic version. Also, the rum-soaked citrus fruits are perfect for cooking with chicken. Thanks!

Yum! Taking the advice of reviewers I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup. I also added Honeydew melon balls and strawberries. This stuff was great and a big hit. I'll definately be making it again.

Wow!  This was soo great!  I used Bacardi White Spiced Rum and a spicy dry red wine.  I served it in a glass pitcher and so it was not only yummy but beautiful on the table.  This was the perfect touch to my dinner party and I am so glad I came across this recipe!

Very good!  I used white rum and will spiced next time.......I used only a cup of rum and was glad I didn't use the full dose! (this is a sneaky brew, all right!)  I am also going to try cutting the sugar a bit but adding the lemon-lime pop.  I think I would like the tickle of  carbonation.  Perfect addition to our 4th of July backyard picnic!

This was my first attempt at sangria and definitely not my last! The recipe was a big hit, but only after I had to add several cups of Sprite.  Without the Sprite, this was just entirely too strong. Still, once the minor adjustment was made, I'd say this is a wonderful recipe (and my guests would say so, too!)

It's perfect. It's simple. A party favorite. If you want to splurge use Captain Morgan Private Stock Spiced Rum with a tad bit more orange juice...you'll never know what hit you.

I lived in Spain for several years and I have had all types of sangria.  A lot of sangria in restaurants doesn't have any liquor added, but is just sweetened, fruity wine.  Some restaurants add brandy, rum, and even vodka.  My personal favorite is dark rum, but I scaled back the recipe so that there was only 1 oz. of rum per serving.  A slightly less potent concoction, but it still packs a punch!  I only gave the recipe four stars because I think that it needs a lot of tweaking for individual preferences and I did not care for the flavor that the lemons and limes added.  Next time, I will use oranges and peaches, which is the "classic" Spanish fruit of choice in my experience.

YUM! Served this for New Years and it was a hit. I did end up reducing the amount of rum (made a quadruple recipie, and used 3 cups spiced rum instead of ~6) and I soaked the fruit in it overnight and all day. For fruit, I used 2 limes, 2 oranges, 1 lemon,  strawberries, and canned peaches (and about 1/2 the juice from the can). I used Arbour Mist blackberrry merlot for the wine, and only added about 3 cups of orange juice to the whole thing. Turned out -excellently-, and was just about perfect for strength. Thanks for a great recipie!

This is a great basic recipe. With these changes, I have never served it to anyone who doesn't like it.  I use a bottle of blackberry merlot rather than dry red wine.  I sometimes add half rum and half apricot brandy.  I ALWAYS add peaches, strawberries, Kiwi, and sometime grapes to the citrus.  Everyone loves scooping those up and eating them after they get to the bottom of the sangria.  Don't skip on soaking the fruit in the rum and sugar for 2 hrs, and stir it up a couple of times during that 2 hrs.

Excellent Sangria!!!  After reading the reviews I decreased the amount of rum to 1 cup, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I made this for my friends and they all loved it.  They kept saying it was strong and downing one glass after another.  When it was all gone they wanted more.  I will definately make this again, but probably use a little more sugar or a different wine (I don't usually drink wine, so this was missing just a bit of sweetness for my taste).

Awesome!  I made a triple-batch and took it to the lake in a huge rubber-maid sealed container.  I only used strawberries and oranges - the fruits I knew most people liked.  I also used a big bottle of Macaroni Grill Chianti wine - it's less than $6 but tasted great!

We loved this version of sangria. I followed the suggestions & used both the Capt. Morgan's spiced rum & the blackberry merlot.  We didn't bother with the sprite, but would have if guests wanted it. I used lots of fruits (the suggested and peaches, grapes, strawberries, pears). The remaining "happy fruit" in the bottom of the empty pitcher was a bonus!  Not a piece was left!

A good use of homemade wine, I added a little more juice (1/4 c. apple juice) and a variety of cut up fruit in the mixture  - strawbs, cut grapes, kiwis - once discovered at a huge family dinner...GONE.

This mixture was pretty potent!  It had a really good flavor but I added some (about 3/4 cup to the pitcher) Sprite to cut the bite down a little bit.  Great spring BBQ drink!

Deceptively intoxicating, but extraordinarily good. We used the white rum, and chilled the fruit mixture overnight.

Fabulous!  I made a lot of this for a family party and everyone loved it.  I served it out of a punch bowl and it looked very festive and tasted great.  Next time I would like to cut the fruit into half slices and maybe add some different fruits - apples or cherries for color.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a wonderful sangria recipe.  I used Bacardi's spiced rum and decreased the fum amount to 1 cup.  A glass punch bowl worked great for presentation.  I also added a few large ice cubes to keep the sangria chilled.  Your guests will love this!

Great taste.  A little strong.  I added less rum the second time, and a little more sugar, too.

OH MY GOODNESS! I MADE IT WITH CAPTIAN MORGANS SPICE RUM AND A BOTTLE OF MURLO. I USE FRESH BLUEBERRIE, APPLES, LIME, LEMON, AND GRAPES. I HAD TO ADD A LITTLE EXTRA SUGAR THOUGH. I DID NOT LIKE WINE AT ALL, BUT MY DAUGHTER AND I JUST GOT HOME FROM ST.AUGISTINE, FLORIDA AND THEY HAVE THE BEST SANGRIA EVER AND OURS TURNED OUT EVEN BETTER. I CAN NOT WAIT TO MAKE THIS AND TAKE TO OUR THANKSGIVING PARTY, THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;0)
ENJOY------ KAREN

Wow! That packs quite a punch and is NOT a Wed. night drink!! I am a regular drinker but that left me hurting the next morning. I will definately be cutting back on the rum next time. There's a lot of room to play with the recipe. I used sweeter fruits because the lemon and lime gave it a little too much tart-ness. I'll make it again but with modifications!

This recipe for sangria is better than the $30 pitcher at Texas de Brazil.  Actually it's better than 99% of the sangrias I've had in restuarants.  The only thing I did differently was add a cup of Sprite and used fruit that was in season like strawberries, honeydew, pineapple, and tangerines.  I also made one pitcher with a $3 bottle of Charles Shaw Shiraz and another pitcher with a $4 bottle of German red.  Both were fabulous.  You really have to be careful with this stuff because it tastes delicious and you don't realize how much it affects you until it's too late.

I made this for a party we had, and doubled the recipe. We also had a white sangria but THIS was the hit! Everyone loved it. Instead of using citrus, we used  
papaya, strawberry, mango which was amazing! You will love this recipe, 1 batch isn't enough!

I made the recipe with 1/3 C of sugar, and it was still too sweet.  If I follow this recipe again I will try less than 1/4 C sugar and 1/2 C orange juice.

A huge hit, although I lemons, limes, apples & pears, soaked in the sugar-rum mix overnight, and then added extra rum to taste when mixing. I use spiced rum, and it was delicious.

Excellent recipe.  I used the spiced rum and the suggested fruit.  It's a very strong drink, so I had extra orange juice that my guest added themselves.  Also, I should have doubled it since it went quickly.

Awesome!!  I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup because I'm not fond of really sweet drinks.  I was in a rush, so I didn't get to chill it, but adding an ice cube or two to a glass was just perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I changes this around a bit, I added brandy and triple sec  and cinnamon sticks to the recipe. I also took out the orange juice and added more sugar. I like my sangria sweet. I also let the fruit soak in just the liquor's with a little sugar and the cinnamon sticks. This recipe is a good start, but with my changes made it GREAT. 

If you do drink it the way I suggested, please drink it slow, it will sneak up on you later. Hope you enjoy!!!

Delicious!!!  I used Blackberry Merlot for the red wine and Capt. Morgan's Spiced Rum.  It was the best sangria I've ever had!  Will definitely be looking for any good reason to make this again.

This is very tasty, I just married into a Spanish family and I LOVED my mother-in-laws Sangria but I wanted to try and impress her with "my own" so I used this recipie.  She loved it!  A little secret I stole from her recipe, add about 4 cinnamon sticks and 5 whole cloves and let it sit for about 2-3 days and it gives a nice kick of spice to it.  I will be making this again for sure!

As a sangria novice with a sweet tooth, I found this recipe a perfect base to start from.  I've made this recipe many times, and have had friends rave about it (and ask for the recipe!) However, I tend to throw in different types of fruit, whatever I have on hand (I find that strawberries, blueberries, and nectarines are fruits that work well!) and use only 3/4 cup to 1 cup of rum.  I think the sugar is important to help draw out the flavor of the fruit, as well as crushing the fruit after it has chilled in the fridge.
Also, I have found that a cheap blackberry merlot (as earlier posters suggested) works best, in my case, a $4 Arbor mist version!
I'm the type of person that does not like to taste the alcohol so with these changes, the resulting sangria is sweet, fruity, and will be gone in minutes!

This was fantastic! I made a couple of batches for an Oscar party I had the other night and couldn't believe how tasty it was! I used less than 1 1/2 cups of rum (about 1 to 1 1/4 cups) and no one thought it was too strong. I used spiced rum and a $6 bottle of red and it turned out great. Added strawberries, an orange and lime, black plums, and some panned peaches- made for a nice variety of colours. Bottom line: this tastes like you spent a long time on it, but it's unbelievably easy to make! If you like sangria, you'll love this recipe!

I have made this a lot of ways depending on what I have on hand. Always the fruit called for in the basic recipe but sometimes other fruit as well. Strawberries peaches nectarines apples pears ... A lot of times I haven't had the orange juice on hand. I have never used the full amount of sugar before and I usually use only 1 cup of rum. I have added frozen lime or lemon-aid instead of the orange juice. Today I, for the first time after a couple of years of messing with this recipe finally have made this recipe as listed above. Awesomeness ***** . My rating is for the recipe as listed. This could be called Smooth Heroin wine... One glass and your cheeks are warm... Take care and enjoy...

This is a great recipe.  I made this for a 4th of July cookout...and it was a hit.  I only gave it 4 stars because I don't feel the sugar is necessary.  I made it with Arbor Mist Blackberry Merlot and Parrot Bay Lime Rum...and followed the recipe exactly.  It was a bit too sweet.  But still delicious!

This must be an American version. I've had Sangria in almost very country that borders the Mediterranean and none of them had enough alcohol in them to even taste or feel it, irregardless of how much you drank.

I made this for a girls night fondue party and it was fantastic! I doubled the recipe and used Carlo Rossi Sangria wine, 2 small limes and 1 large lemon cut into thin rounds, I cut 1 orange into rounds and another I cut the orange wedges into bite size pieces, I cut up 2 apples into bite size pieces and before serving I added a jar of drained and rinsed maraschino cherries. It had a wonderful sweet-citrus flavor and I will make it again and again!

Great recipe.  If you scale up to 24 servings do NOT use 4 lemons, limes, and oranges.  It is just too much fruit to waste.  Everyone loved this recipe.  Try to chill a few hours before serving if possible.  If you can't, that's OK.

Best I've ever tasted.  This is a winner.  I am making this for a neighborhood party and I made a test batch for me and the wife.  Wow is this smooth and refreshing.  Wife kept asking for more, but I had to cut her off for fear she would overdo it.

I cut the rum back to 1/2 cup and it was still potent.  I used dark rum as that is what I had in the cabinet.

The great thing about sangria is you can use the cheapest dry red wine you can find and, once mixed, it tastes like a million bucks.

Great recipe! Like others, I used Arbor Mist Blackberry Merlot and Captain Morgan.  I added strawberries to the fruit and cut the sugar in half because the Arbor Mist is sweet.  I made a double batch and it was gone in a flash.  Wonderful recipe!

This was a good base. We'd never had sangria with rum in it and we only used a cup. it really snuck up on you. We used two oranges, a lemon and two limes. It seemed a bit "winey" yet, so we added ginger ale to each glass. Not bad, but I've had better. Thanks for the recipe!

The BEST Sangria!  We make this all the time for parties.
The rum was too strong so we reduced it to 1 cup, and also served it with Sprite....2/3 Sangria, 1/3 Sprite.
Make at least a double batch if you're having company, because this goes fast!

If you add siera mist or other lemon lime sodas you dont need to add the sugar. They dont put sugar in it in Spain. And it should only have the wine as the alcohol, gives it a fresher taste. The aussie shiraz/cab is a great wine for Sangria.

This is awesome!  I'm famous now with all of my family and friends!  I'm the one with the "to die for Sangria"!!  I cut the rum back to 3/4-1 cup and make the orange juice with about 1 1/4 cups.

I made this for a casual wedding reception with a Mexican theme and it was a huge hit.  I did cut the rum to 3/4 cup like everyone suggested. Along with lemons and limes, I used fruits that were more edible, like sliced oranges, white peaches, apples, and halved grapes. I left it in the fridge overnight at least 12 to 18 hours and it was excellent. The fruits had time to soak up the liquor and were absolutely wonderful.  This is a real keeper!!!

Sure made the Cookie Exchange Party memorable (or not!).  What a nice change from the usual drinks - my friends all LOVED it! Used $6 bottle of blackberry merlot ('not a wine, but a wine PRODUCT' I was informed by my local liquor store advisor:) and spiced rum.  Deeeeeeeelishus!

I had to add a lot more orange juice, but I think it was my own fault...the rum I had on hand was 151 proof - I think I should have cut the amount in half!  It tasted like pure alcohol!

I loved this recipe! I used Captain Morgan spiced rum and Arbor Mist Blackberry Merlot. I made one batch with the 1/2 cup of sugar and one batch without it and to be honest- it doesn't need the sugar at all! The wine and orange juice made it sweet enough, but not overboard. This is perfect for a romantic evening or a summer day! Loved it

I made this for Christmas and my family loved it. I used a cheap merlot and Captain Morgan passion fruit which made it so good and I also added cherries and mangos. Can't wait to make it again.

Used Merlot. Had every intention of using a spiced rum only to discover that I only had half the amount of it needed so I had to add regular rum to the rest. Needless to say the spiced flavor didn't come through. I also made a batch Sangria and it called for brandy. So I did a taste test and I like the rum better. The brandy made it too "boozy"

4.5 Stars! I love this drink and can't wait to make it again. I doubled the original recipe for a party. I used blackberry wine as others suggested, but still added a bit of sugar. I didn't use quite as much rum (I used Cpt Morgan) since I had some older ladies who were worried about too much booze. I also had 7up on the side if anyone wanted to make a spritzer. For fruit, I used a whole lemon, 1 orange, half of an apple and a half of a can of pineapple with the juice. We actually ended up with leftover fruit, so next time I might not add as much. The drink would be great without it!

Fantastic!  I used peach rum which added a nice flavor -- otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This will be my new go to sangria recipe.

This is some mighty fine stuff.  I had bought a bottle of premixed Sangria as emergency backup but that's like comparing Dom Perignon to Mad Dog 20/20.  I will definitely make this again and again :)

This was delicious! The only thing I might change was the amount of sugar.  As I rounded glass number 2, I started to feel a bit sugar high and it was too sweet for me to finish the second glass.  If you add just a bit less sugar, good to go!

Very good.  As someone suggested, I soaked the fruit in rum for a while.  I took this to a party so I combined all the ingredients in advance and it was really good.  Next time, I'll add apples and maybe mangos.

This recipe is fantastic, blending simplicity with awesomeness. I make it as often as possible, and sometimes I am reduce to inventing reasons. But, it's great for the holidays and any party you can think of.   I always make double batches of this, and it fills a gallon pitcher. I lower the octane a bit by reducing the total the rum amount to just over 2 cups, and the OJ to about 1.5 cups. Otherwise, the (junk) wine flavor gets lost. I like it better when it's all balanced.

Whenever I make this, people are in awe. I don't really know why, it is SO easy but totally worth it. I love making it in the summer to have around for those lovely, lazy afternoons...  I add a little more rum, triple sec, a bunch of fruit and mix everything together in one pitcher, letting it all chill in the fridge.  Adding a couple of pieces of fresh fruit to each glass is pretty but not necessary. And I never dilute it. Ever.  If you are making this in advance (which I recommend), after a day the fruit takes on that red color. So, if you are going for pretty, changing out the fruit before presentation is a good idea.

I talked to my mom's neighbor who is from Spain and visits her family there 2 or 3 times a year. She said this is like the versions some of the newer restaurants have started serving the past few years. She said the traditional sangria is made with port(no rum) and lots of sliced citrus fruit and juice except for one small region where the locals use madeira and a splash of rum and lots of citrus. She also said your version is commonly found more towards France.

I soaked 1 orange 1 lemon 1 lime in Orange flavored rum with sugar for a few hours...added a bottle of black swan merlot...awesome.  I also made the orange juice ice cubes.  Pour in the sangria...2 orange cubes...top it off with a splash lemon lime sparkling water...AWESOME!  I cut up some extra oranges to garnish the glass...Fun to make...even more fun to drink! Great if you like citrus!

This recipe should definately call for merlot and spiced rum - any other way is just not as good. But if you do use merlot and spiced rum it is a real winner. I like to use a wooden spoon to mash the sugar and the citrus fruits together a bit to get the juices going and to disolve the sugar a bit quicker.

This was amazing! I used the dark rum and a dry (for me) red, "Red Fox" from Goose Watch. I did cut the rum down to 1 cup. It was great the first day, absolutely amazing the second! Though I have to admit there wasn't much left for day two. Letting the fruit soak really made a difference. Definitely keeping this recipe around. Great for parties, special occasions, just for fun

When I first read about rum in sangria, I thought no way! But I did it with CM Spiced Rum, strawberries, raspberries, oranges, pears, pineapple. Soaked it for about a day and a half. Added no sugar, and the wine and OJ. It was a big hit! I will definitely make it again. The only thing is you have to plan in advance. I used to make sangria with only red wine and OJ, plus the fruit and I thought THAT was good! LOL, thanks for a great simple recipe!

This was great, it was my first time making Sangria, I substituted brandy for the rum. Everyone loved it, including my friend who makes it all the time. I think the best thing is that it has very few ingredients so you taste the wine and brandy (it's also quick and easy to make) I mixed the fruit and wine together the night before, then mixed everything together in the morning so all the flavours melded.

Great recipe for Sangria.  I used the spiced rum, but we didn't like the blackberry flavored wine (that was recommended by others) as much as regular wine (we used a cheap merlot the first time).  I think the blackberry wine works great if you don't have time to let the flavors develop - or if you want a drink that is not as strong.  Still, the great thing about this recipe is that you can experiment with the ingredients (both alcohol and fruit) and it'll still taste great.

Have used this recipe multiple times! I live in Florida. Have had Cuban immigrants exclaim that: "Now THIS is like the Sangria at home." High praise indeed! 

Everyone, yes everyone LOVES this recipes. I save it and use it for all the spring, summer, fall parties I have! Good for drinking by the pool also!

Now: January 2016: I make this for EVERY party I have: at least 3 times a year. This time I edited this way: and I must say: even more raves! I quadruple it: which is easy with allrecipes.com calculator on each recipe!

Instead of orange juice use FRESH grapefruit juice (in the produce section). Instead of oranges: use red grapefruit slices. I use SPICED rum. Decrease the sugar by a 1/4. 

Two big pinches of salt (brings out the citrus flavor). For only 6 servings I would use a small pinch of salt.  I always use a Cabernet wine. Okay to add an extra bottle of wine to stretch punch. 

Just keep tasting, as you add, before you add the slices of fruit. Keep muddling the fruit...the more the fruit is bruised in the punch: I think the better it tastes.

I would say the punch today is the best yet. And I have made it at least 18 times!

The original recipe is great! You can also improvise. I didn't have any red wine or brandy, so I used Zinfindel, mango rum, and plain rum. Had no fruit on hand so I used orange liquere. For a little carbonation I used a small bottle of sparkling tangerine juice. The point is, when in a pinch, you can use some subsitutions and still end up with a great drink.

Fabulous sangria, but it will knock you for a loop. If you are going to have people driving home, you may want to reduce the rum just a little.

Really great recipe.  Made it just as the recipe says with the minor substitution on sweet wine instead of dry.  Used plain Bacardi rum and lemons, limes, and oranges.  I mixed up the rum, fruit, and sugar the night before and added the wine a couple of hours before serving.  The only issue I had was in trying to get the sugar dissolve.  Awesome recipe, though.  Will be making again.

The first time I made this I used one of my favorite red wines and golden cachaca instead of rum and it was great! This time I used 1 cup golden cachaca since it's all I had and a new wine that wasn't nice on it's own and it was still delicious!

Delicious! I've made this numerous times for dinner parties, and it's always a hit. I usually reduce the amount of rum down to 1 cup, and increase the orange juice by about 1/2 cup.

Fantastic!  Everyone RAVED about this drink!  I used the blackberry merlot and spiced rum as other reviewers suggested and it turned out amazing!  If it is too strong, you can top it off with a bit of diet or regular 7Up or Sprite...but we didn't do that and it was fantastic!!!

I made it this past weekend and it was a hit! I made it for 30 people. I used 2 huge bottles Arbor Mist in different berry flavors and Cpt Morgans Spiced Rum and added pears. I fermented it friday night and about an hr before serving added another 1/2 cup of sugar, then the oj and arbor mist. people were just drinking as much as they could before it ran out. Thank you so much!

Using Captain Morgan's spiced rum and blackberry Merlot in the recipe makes a great combination.  I made it twice, once following the recipe exactly, but it turned out better when I cut the sugar in half and only used one cup of rum.  So good!

Wow this is really good, and I don't like wine at all. It's so yummy I can't stop drinking it (that's bad). I love that it doesn't have too many types of alcohol in it, so I don't have to buy tons of ingredients. I used spiced rum. Try this!

This recipe is awesome!  I made exactly as recipe stated except I used only 1 cup of Captain Morgan instead of 1 1/2 cups and it was perfect.  I have made it with letting it sit 4 hours or overnight and recommend the 4 hours.  When I made it the night before it still tasted good but was slightly bitter from all the citrus rinds.  I have also made it with a $3 bottle of Merlot or a much more expensive wine and there is no difference in the flavor so save your money.  Be careful because you can hardly taste the liquor and it will knock your socks off.

As I reside in Ponce Puerto Rico I have tasted some of the great Sangria's Puerto Rico has to offer which includes Cuban and Spanish recipes. This recipe by Lisa is simply dynamite and rivals the great Sangria served at El Patriota Restaurant located outide Ponce. I have been making this Sangria for the past two years and have been asked numerous times to make this recipe at gatherings, receptions, bridal & Baby showers and even tailgate parties.  Two restauernater have even asked for this recipe for use in their bars.
I know that experimentation with this recipe is expected, I find myself most reluctant to change it in any form. I find it great as it stands. Saludos to a great Sangia!

This is the best Sangria I have EVER had! I used Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, fresh orange juice (not from concentrate), and instead of the citrus I used blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries. Oh my God! Awesome. It was even better two days later when it had a chance to blend.. got a little thicker. This drink is not for a lightweight. Can't wait to make it again!

This has WAY TOO much Rum for a Classic Sangria.  True Sangria is just the wine, fruit and a classic syrup made with sugar and water.  If you wanna get a buz on, this is the one for you though!!

Definitely not a drink for lightweights - but it has become the signature drink that I bring to parties.  The key to this is to soak the fruit, sugar, and rum overnight.  This gives it a chance to bring out the flavors and make a much smoother drink.

I made this for a dinner party and it was fabulous! I did use the bigger bottle of wine (liter and half) but it was fine. I also added a granny smith apple and a couple strawberrys. I would suggest to add the rum by taste..some may think this is too strong, but we liked it.

Delicious and authentic tasting! I used oranges, limes, lemons, strawberries and canned peaches (with 1/2 the can of syrup) as my fruit and let the fruit soak in the spiced rum and sugar overnight until the fruit was nice and drunk. Then I added Simply Orange OJ and Arbor Mist Blackberry Merlot. It was a HUGE hit at our Halloween party and now it will be a staple at every party! People especially loved the drunk strawberries! After a day in the fridge however, it gets really strong so we mixed the leftovers with Sprite the next day to cut down the alcohol. Yum!

This is the most authentic Sangria I've tasted since a trip to Barcelona my freshman year of college.  I LOVED it, but I must admit that my guests did not...I have tons leftover.  I think it was too strong for people who are used to drinking an "americanized" version of the drink. A few of my friends mixed it w/ Sprite and enjoyed it that way.  Personally, I thought it was wonderful...just be wary if you've got miller light drinking friends.  :)

Wow!  Made this for the four women at our Super Bowl party, fully expecting the guys to drink beer.  Five batches later, not one beer was consumed!  Having lived in Spain, I can tell you this is very authentic and WONDERFUL!

Yuck, maybe its my fault because I did not follow the recipe exactly instead I took the suggestions of many others and used blackberry merlot and spiced rum. I used tons of fruit and it still wasn't good. I personally think I went wrong by using spice rum instead of regular rum.

Hooo Mama! This was really good, but dangerous! Too easy to just suck down quicky . . . and then it hits you. Drink AFTER using the food processor.

I recently attended a dinner with a Spanish theme and made this recipe.  I thought it sounded horrible (rum with wine? wine with OJ? Yuck) but I wanted to do something authentic. It was a huge, huge hit.  Even the beer drinking guys wanted seconds of this.  I did not cut it with any flavored sodas as some of the reviews said.  I did use frozen cherries, blueberries, lemons and limes.  I used merot wine and dark rum.  I made two batches and everyone was dissapointed that it was all gone.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

I made this for a bridal shower and used the suggested Blackberry Merlot rather than just red wine. It was great! It tasted like sprite with a kick! The guests did not know that it had rum(spiced) in it. They soon found out after it hit them! It was great!

Very good, and such a beautiful presentation in a clear glass pitcher! I'm not much of a wine drinker, though, so I diluted it with giner ale. (And as a side note, it was not as good the next day; it seemed to have become bitter.) Thanks, Lisa!

Not a fan, honestly.
Brandy is actually the best and most common hard alcohol to mix with the wine.
Sorry, but I'll stick w/the Sangria! Sangria recipe here on AR.
I use brandy & a splash of triple sec or OJ, maybe a splash of peach schnapps, allow it to blend/chill for several hours or overnight. I've also used blackberry brandy as well as ginger brandy for kicks - comes out great. I prefer to serve it with club soda -  or ginger ale for those who prefer it sweeter. Again, sorry, but I'd skip this recipe and Google Sangria...you'll find brandy is much more authentic than rum. But hey, whatever works for ya!  Also, add any citrus LAST ~ all fresh citrus turns bitter after a couple hours. Cheers!

I substitute 1c brandy for rum -and substitute chopped apples for the lemons and limes, I also cut back the sugar alot (apples make it sweeter) we sometimes skip the OJ too let the fruit soak & add a few cloves for a kick.
Just my preference reminds me more of what we had in Spain

This is hands down the favorite at my parties.  But.....it is STRONG! Make sure your friends have lots to eat.  I use two-buck chuck from Trader Joes and Bacardi light rum.  It is amazing

Great recipe.  But, I got fruit loopy! Next time I will stick to basic recipe.  Too much fruit soaked up the liquid.  But it looked pretty!

Used spice rum.  Used regular Merlot because I could not find a decent black berry merlot.  So I added some frozen black berries.  Used 1 each of red apple, green apple, lime, orange, and a lemon.  

Many of us like it strong so we didn't need soda, but others felt the need to add soda.  All were satisfied.

I used blackberry merlot (cheap but tastes sooo good!) and spiced rum along with all the other ingredients this calls for.  I made 5 batches of it for my housewarming party and it was such a hit!  Will DEFINITELY make this amazing Sangria again!

I just made this for a party yesterday and love it.  It tastes great--not too sweet but not too dry.  Also, it is a lot easier than some of the other sangria recipes out there, which is great for when you're planning a party for a crowd.  I will definitely make this again.

This  always pleases the crowd when ever I bring it to a shin dig! One time I used a wine that was 20% alcohol and whoa it was nothing to play with. Just make sure you take your time while drinking this it sneaks up on you. Thanks for sharing!

This is such a favorite with my friends. I follow the recipe, and occasionally add more rum (for an extra fun time!). I've used all sorts of red wines, but typically stick to a cheap merlot.

YUM!!! I did make a few changes. i didn't have any oranges so I justed used some orange juice concentrate to take the place of both the juice and oranges. I added lemon, strawberries and a little canned pineapple. I also added some of the juice from the pineapple which is sweet so I only added about a 1/4 cup of sugar. I also used about a 1/2 cup triple sec instead of all rum just because it adds to the citrus flavor. A great starting recipe you can use to add whatever your preferences are. Would be good with all sorts of different fruits!!

I make this all the time now! It is better than most Sangrias I've had in restaurants. The longer it is in the fridge the better. I'll add the run just before serving to ensure the fruit only takes up the wine.  Your friends will be asking you for the recipe!

I made this for Mother's Day and it was wonderfl and refreshing! Next time I will double the recipe since it didn't make very much. I realized I only had 1/2 cup of orange juice on hand rather than the full cup so I used about 1/2 cup of triple sec to supplement the OJ. I also added about 1/2 cup of sour mix.

This sangria was alright. My guests seemed to like it well enough, but I felt it could have been a little better. I will keep looking for the perfect sangria recipe but might come back to this one and tweak it. Thanks so much for sharing!

FANTASTIC!!!  I made this for a party I had this past weekend and it was gone within 10 minutes!    I used Capt. Morgans 100 proof spiced rum and Berringer Merlot. Apples, strawberries, oranges, lemons, limes and blackberries.  It was so good we added a 2nd bottle of wine and spash of rum and OJ to the leftover fruit.  HIGHLY SUGGEST!!!!

Fantastic! Goes great with whatever fruit you have. I used one lime, one orange, one green apple, and about half a pineapple along with fresh squeezed orange juice. Lastly, I used a sweeter bottle of red wine. This drink will sneak up and kick you in the head, be careful out there!

This recipe is great!  I added pineapple juice for extra flavor and it was delicious.

I've gotten so many compliments on this when I make it (usually for large groups) even from those who don't like "sweet" alcoholic drinks.  I tried cutting the sugar in half, like other reviewers have said, but was told it wasn't sweet enough.  I also add chopped apples (I chop the oranges, but leave the lemons and limes in slices so people don't bite into them thinking they are oranges!).  I've used spiced and regular rum as well as blackberry and regular Merlot (at different times) and all are wonderful!  For those who don't want such a "strong" taste, we add Sprite or 7-Up to the glasses afterward.

I added apples, strawberries, and pineapple.  Doubled the recipe, but used 1/2 the rum (Capt Morgan spiced rum)called for.  SO GOOD, we drank every last drop!

This recipe was THE BEST!!!  I made the Sangria for a party and received rave reviews all night long!  Everyone kept asking for more and how to make it.  I did follow some of the other suggestions and used a blackberry merlot and a little sprite.  You can't go wrong...this was the best drink!

I get rave reviews everytime I make this.  It is a good base recipe, I like to make it my own by adding apples along with the other fruits.  I also use spiced rum and orange-pineapple juice.  I have also added a dash of Fresca to each glass to make it zippy.

I love this sangria recipe - very quick and easy and it tastes wonderful!  I replace 1/2 cup of the rum with triple sec and lower the sugar to 1/4 of a cup. Also, I just mix it all up and let it sit in the fridge over night. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I actually followed the recipe when I made this and wasn't real sure about it when I started drinking it.  Neither was my sister or a friend who tried it, but my sister and I persevered, and we agreed - the more you drink, the better it gets.  :)

Strong, but wonderful. Most of my family loved it. I would suggest adding more lemon-lime soda or ginger ale to help cut the alcohol down some.

This was ok. We generally like more alcohol in drinks, but found this tasted better with less (1 cup instead of 1.5 cups).  We tried again the other night with 1 cup Bacardi Razz Rum and it was fantastic!  I highly recommend this substitution!

Perfect Sangria!  I love Sangria, but have never attempted to make it.  I tried this recipe due to it's ease and great reviews.  I completely agree.  VERY easy and inexpensive.  I was a little concerned about the "type" of wine to use.  I ended up choosing a cheap shiraz in one and blackberry merlot (as suggested)in the other and light rum. Note: I did cut the rum to a cup and I shook the rum and sugar first before adding to the fruit. Huge hit!

Very, very good, although I prefer my sangria a little sweeter and upped the sugar to a cup. Very dangerous as it is extremely strong without tasting so! Proceed with caution!

Amazing!  I make this for pretty much every occasion.  I have found that it can get a bit "dangerous" without the sprite, but if your friends will have only one glass, I think the full flavor is best without it.  As other reviewers have suggested, I use spiced rum, and it's fun to mix up the fruit for different shapes and colors.  Rum-soaked cherries are delicious!

This is really good. Bad part I did not have time to wait 2 hours for it to set up. Instead of just adding the sugar, next time I will make a sugar water and add that since takes FOREVER for sugar to dissolve in cold liquids.

I added Sprite Zero to mind. I also used Arbor Mist blackberry merlot and captatin morgan's spiced rum. I cut the sugar in half. Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe. I make a double batch of this and had to make one more batch before the night was over. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing.  It tastes just like the Sangria that is served at my local Spanish restaurant.  I even used Two Buck Chuck from Tader Joes.  It got rave reviews from all of my guests, and as mentioned by other reviewers, this does sneek up on you so watch out!

After I figured out that 750ml is just a regular siza bottle of wine... I gave this a try and it was very good. We also tried it with a splash of club soda per glass. We liked that too! I did use only 1 cup of rum and it still can sneak up and get you.

I cut the rum to one pint for 12 servings; only used 1 cup of sugar and super-cheap merlot. I also made the gingerale ice cubes for my guests and these were a hit! 

Everyone raved this recipe. Very potent like everyone warned. WOW! Tasty.

WOW, this is great but really packs a punch! I could easily drink too much, so found it was improved by mixing with ginger ale, either a third or half-- and it still tasted great!  One final tip - don't crush the fruit too hard or you'll get a bitter taste from the rind.

What a way to start a party...I served this at Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  The first sip is very strong, but after a couple of swigs, it's outstanding.  I even had the men drinking this and enjoying it...It was definitely a crowd pleaser...Serving it over ice cuts down on the rum taste.

Only flubbed once on this recipe.. It was either because it sat too long before mixing in the wine or because of the wine that was given for this (friend picked up sangria wine) I'll stick with a merlot.

Wow! I have never had so many people ask me for a recipe before. Took a double batch to a summer party and it was gone in a moment. So many compliments! I used 1/2 the amount of rum and lemonade instead of OJ. Also added strawberries and blueberries with the citrus fruits. I will be making this often - thanks so much!!

Delicious, like all the others have said.  Followed recommendations and used Arbor Mist's Blackberry Merlot, great flavor.  But boy, it knocked me for a loop, so I would say to definitely cut the rum portion down if you want to enjoy the drink and remember enjoying it!

This is a great recipe for authentic Sangria!  We thoroughly enjoyed it and this is coming from someone who lived in Spain!  I recommend using a Rioja wine to get the most authentic taste.  I used Bacardi rum and I didn't have any orange juice on hand so I squeezed oranges.  It tasted divine!  Thanks for sharing.

This made a great drink for my boyfriend's birthday party.  All the guests went for seconds and thirds.  One guest mentioned it was better than his own version.  I eventually ran out - way too early.  For my version, I used a cheap burgundy, only 1/2 cup medium rum, no lime nor lemon (didn't have on hand), added diced apples, halved grapes, orange slices, 1/2 cup splenda (instead of sugar), and used iced cubes made with gingerale to prevent watering down the drink.

Do not serve this to someone that doesn't like red wine.  I loved these sangrias.  My husband doesn't like red wine but wanted to try it;not good. they still have a very distinct red wine flavor.  Perfect for those of us who love a glass or 2 of red.

I went through 4 pitchers for a party of about 6 drinkers.  I used cabernet savignon and it worked very well. Used only 3/4 c. rum and that's plenty. When they want the recipe you know you have a keeper! Thanks!

This is so delicious, even the non-drinkers and others who don't enjoy wine LOVED this and had seconds (and thirds and some even fourths)!  The only change was, like many reviewers, I halved the amount of rum.  I used the cheapest Burgundy I could find and white rum.  It's fantastic, and I like it so much more than sangria made with brandy.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  If I'm using it so much in the winter time, I can only imagine how much I'll use it this summer!

Amazing.  But be careful, this stuff is strong!  I usually leave out the rum and my guests still rave!

I would omit the sugar add 1/2 cup of tripple sec and add a splash of peach schnapps.  (just a splash)  Also an apple is a good addition as well.  The sugar is what gives you that terrible headache the next morning.  You won't miss it in the flavor.  If you want to make this without the 2 hour chill time just fill pitcher with ice, add fruit, then brandy & tripple sec, then wine, then oj splash the schnapps stir with a wooden spoon and you're all done.

This is not really a classic Spanish Sangria, much too sweet. Spanish Sangria is made with brandy rather than rum and the fruit is muddled with small amounts of unrefined sugar and club soda(agua con gas. The wine should be on the sweet side rather than dry.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday party last month for about 100 people. This was a HUGE hit!!! It was gone before the evening ended, and everyone was disappointed. I used 1/2 less rum, and added pineapples. People are asking me to make it again; I definitely will!

This is GREAT!  I brewed 1 batch to share w/a friend for a BYO club event and realized a 2nd batch might come in handy -might have a friend or 2 that needs to be turned on to something different.  I mixed up the first batch the night before the event and fortunately(?) I have to get up early otherwise I might have a couple more glasses. OH, I made this with 2 buck Chuck Merlot from Trader Joes to keep the cost down and not waste a "good" wine &Bacardi White (clear) rum -the recommended amount because this recipe doesn't need any added flavor, but any inexpensive white rum will probably do the trick. I added some fresh pink grapefruit to the mix and tomorrow for the party i'll be adding sliced nectarines and strawberries.  

Sangria is a great change from the norm and the fresh fruit makes for some tasty snacking.  Just great to beat the AZ heat.  ;)  This is definitely a summertime favorite.

I made this sangria with the blackberry merlot, only one cup of spiced rum, and I made each serving with three parts sangria, one part lemon lime soda.  Excellent, and not too terribly strong this way.  I plan to make this several times a year!

I followed advice and used less rum - about a cup, I think.  We loved it and got pretty tipsy.  It's dangerous!  I'll definitely make it again and again.  I use a lot of fruit since that's the best part - peaches, strawberries, oranges, and limes...

I have made this for my friends many times and it is ALWAYS a hit!!!  I made it with the blackberry merlot and used only 1/2 the rum and added Sprite.  VERY good, the alcohol sneaks up on you.  The fruit gives it so much added flavor also.  GREAT recipe!!

Classic sangria at its best.  I threw a big party and made 50 servings of this and it went fast.  For the wine, I used the Charles Shaw Shiraz from Trader Joes - at $2 a bottle, it makes it an economically feasible party drink. I figured if you're going to add sugar and orange juice to wine, you shouldn't bother with the expensive stuff.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, thanks guys for all the great reviews (this is Lisa, I lost that old password).  I submitted this recipe almost 2 years ago, and it'e evolved since then.  I've cut back the rum, added a bit of Triple Sec, and substituted Splenda for the sugar, and I use fresh pineapple, some pineapple juice with the orange, and strawberries now, too.  (I still don't like apples!)

I looked long and hard for a recipe like this one.  I remember the classic sangria from my college days when sangria was citrus fruits and red wine chilled.  Today there are so many imposters with just about everything in them but the kitchen sink.
This recipe brought back wonderful memories and a classic taste.  It is on my go-to list forever.

Made this for a family gathering at Christmas! Boy was it a hit!! I added Triple Sec and SPICED Rum. Decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup and added pineapple, orange, lemon, apple, cherries and pear. Oh and yes, I added the Misty Arbor Blackberry Merlot.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe and I highly reccomend you add the spiced rum.  It gives it a dimension you will love, if you really like sangria! Enjoy!!

I really loved this Sangria although I made a couple changes to it.  I only used 1 cup of rum and I added about 1-2 cups of Sprite as well.  I also used more fruit including strawberries, peaches, oranges, maraschino cherries,apple, pear, lemon and extra lime.  Also, it's tastes soooooo good with all that fruit, the sugar is just completely unnecessary, so I didn't use any at all.  And I soaked the fruit in rum overnight as suggested by others.  (And yes, the fruit tastes amazing after soaking, so don't let too many people taste-test it before adding to the sangria!)  I also used orange juice ice cubes in the glasses as suggested by someone else.  My guests raved about it and it was all gone in no time!  As per the recommendation of the staff member at the liquor store I used Jackson Triggs Merlot red wine and it was delicious.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for our dinner guest last night, had lots of fresh Florida oranges, lemons and strawberries. I used fresh squeezed orange juice. The best part about Sangria is when the drink is gone you can still eat the fruit. :)

Read some say that the rum was too strong for the flavor, so with that advice I put in half as much rum as called for, with the idea if it needed more I could always add more. Still with half the recommended amount of rum, it seems to strong. I think I am going to move onto another recipe.

I've made this recipe for a summer party the last couple of years.  I double the recipe, use blackberry merlot and then use berries for my fruit -- strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries.  I also split up the 1 1/2 cups of rum -- usually 1/2 cup of Captain's Spiced, 1/2 Pineapple, 1/4 triple sec, 1/4 cointreau.  Leave out the sugar.  Powerful!!!

I've made this several times, always with rave reviews and requests for the recipe. My favorite is using Parrot Bay Pineapple rum and Manischewitz Blackberry wine. Soooo good. In addition to a lemon, lime and orange, I add sliced pineapple and sometime strawberries. Making some this weekend. Can't wait to sit on my patio sipping a glass and enjoying the evening.

Reduce rum to 1/2-3/4 cup per bottle of wine.  Still strong but not over the top.

Made this for my girls night in party and it was a big hit!  Everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using another reviewers advice and added triple sec (1/2 cup) and adjusted the rum to one cup.  VERY VERY GOOD!

I made this yesterday for the World Cup final and it was a huge hit - even the Spaniards here in Texas loved it!  Being a Sunday I couldn't buy extra liquor so had to use what I had.  I doubled the recipe so hence needed 3 cups of rum - I used 1.5 cups of Bajan Mount Gay and 1 cup of Dark Rum - the remaining half cup was made up with Peach Schnapps (some other Sangria recipes call for Peaches).  I used Merlot and omitted the sugar - perhaps the Schnapps made the mixture more sweet as I didn't feel I needed the sugar.  I added lots of thin slices of the fruit and chopped additional smaller pieces for use in the glass.  I didn't have time to let the Sangria sit for two hours so served it within 30 minutes.  It was a huge hit and marinating the flavors together overnight must make this a complete winner.  Thank you Lisa.

We all loved this recipe!  I tweeked it a bit and used a Lambrusco, and brandy (I used only 1/2 the amount for the brandy.)  It was a major hit and went so fast I still can't believe it!   Thanks!

We quadrupled this recipe for my daughter's bridal shower.  We should have made twice as much.  We read the reviews and went with the Blackberry Merlot, and spiced rum that several people suggested.  We added plums and apples along with the fruit listed.  Yum!!! Big hit with everyone!  I put a bottle of Sprite next to the Sangria just in case anyone wanted to lighten-up the rather potent concoction.  I also had a big spoon there in case anyone wanted to dip in and get the rum-soaked fruit.

Wow! Excellent drink! It IS strong but tastes soo good and is an amazing summer drink! I made mine with a dry Merlot, spiced rum and orange juice from concentrate. I added less sugar as well and it was great. As for the fruit, I added lemon, orange, blueberries  strawberries and blackberries. I actually soaked the fruit overnight. It turned out wonderfully but watch out for the strawberries because they stood out above the rest for their ability to soak up the rum.  Thanks for the great recipe! So simple and delicious. Will be making this all the time for summer entertaining!

Very tasty recipe.  I used pineapple rum instead of regular and it gave it some good flavor.  Should be noted that even without the pineapple rum, doesn't taste like traditional sangria.

This sangria was amazing! Everyone agreed it was the best sangria they'd ever tasted.  I used 1/2 cup of rum and added strawberries. I think it would even be delicious with a cinnamon stick.  I will definitely be making this again, probably every Sunday! Thank you so much for posting it.

Solid recipe - I didn't have all of the fruit on hand b/c i made this at the last minute, so i only used strawberries (which i added at serving time) and orange slices which i added as the recipe stated.  i also cut the sugar down just a tad and added only 1 cup of rum.  Also, i added a splash of sprite to each glass to make up for the missing lemon/limes.  Got a lot of compliments and will be making it again!

Excellent Recipe!  I doubled it and added plums, maraschino cherries, grapes, and it was fabulous!  I also added a bag of frozen strawberries that chilled it and added flavor, too.  Big hit!!

This was so easy to make!  I did cut the rum to 1 cup and I only added 2-3 tbsp. of sugar as I like mine a little less sweet.  I also added a few splashes of lemon-lime soda for some fizz.  I used a basic table red that was inexpensive-this was a hit at our tappas party!  Great summer entertaining drink.

This didn't taste like the spanish sangria we drank in Spain.  I added only 1 cup of rum and it still was too strong and not refreshing enough because of the sweetness.

I love Sangria,and this recipe truly embellishes the wonderful use of fruit for those hot summer nights. I used a Merlot and it came put great. Buen Verano, everyone. Two hours was plenty of time to "meld" flavors.

This sangria was fabulous!  I hadn't made sangria before, and figured that this recipe wouldn't take too long to chill before my friends arrived.  It was perfect.  I used 2007 Turning Leaf Merlot for the wine, and Tortuga Bay spiced rum.   The taste was very smooth and fruity.  It was delicious, and it kicked us all in the butt, so be careful how much you drink.  It will creep up on you!  Thanks for the great recipe and tips from the other reviewers.

Nice recipe! But classic spanish sangria is just Red Wine, Fruit (apple, orange, pear). only if wanted, a little bit of liquor (apple, for example), but never rum...

This was great!  I added Triple Sec to add more kick.  We loved it, and plan to make it again.  When the summer months are here, I plan to add nectarines and pineapples.

WOW!  Tastes just like the Sangria at my favorite tapas bar.
I used only one cup of the rum and half the sugar, and would recommend that you adjust the sweetness and liquor according to your own taste - if you like a stiffer or a sweeter drink.  You can also add any kind of fruit that you like, so it's a very forgiving recipe.
For the wine I used a bottle of Concha y Toro merlot/cab sauv blend.  1.5 liters for $7, but you'd never know it was cheap wine with this recipe!

Yes, it is really strong.  You should definitely use the spiced rum!  I always add seasonal fruit when I make this.  Also, try it with white wine too, it is really good!!!

Wow! I served this at my birthday dinner party 2 years ago and my friends are still talking about it. I'm dusting it off again to try for the adults at my son's birthday party...I will be omitting the rum this time as it really sneaks up on you in the recipe. This is a 5 star because it is unforgettable and delicious!

My friends call this drink "Hangover Sangria" and demand I make it for every party/dinner/BBQ etc.

I find it's best when really really cold, so I serve it over lots of ice.  That way, its potency is lessened a little as well.

I realize ice in sangria is "wrong" but it sure tastes good when it's cold, and I prefer that to watering it down with soda.

I do cut down on the rum some as others have said.  Still, it's a killer drink.

Delicious but way too strong...I only put in a cup of rum already being wary of the alcohol. It was still a bit much. I'd go with 1/2 or 3/4 cup rum next time. I used cheap burgundy, lemon juice instead of a lemon, pineapple-orange juice (it's what I had), and added some maraschino cherries like some others did. Also, don't let it sit for longer than an evening with all the fruit in it or it gets real bitter (probably from the citrus rinds). But again, it was delicious!

wow... just a tad too much rum.  for those who like it strong, follow this to the letter.  for those who like it reasonable, cut the rum in half.  but i do like my bevy's with a bold taste so i enjoy this one overall, thus the 4 stars

I've been making this sangria for a couple of years now . . . everyone always loves it and asks for the recipe.  The only thing I changed after the first time was the quantity of rum.  I only use one cup per batch instead of 1-1/2; it's plenty!

Great recipe! Took others advice and used 1 c Cap Morgan/Arbor Mist blackberry merlot combo.  Used 1/2c of simple syrup instead of the granulated sugar and used a green apple, pear, peach, & lemon.  Will have to up the Cap Morgan to the recommended 1.5c since I found it not that strong.  Will be making double batches for my 4th of July party.

I used brandy (more traditional) instead of rum and added a splash of club soda to each glass.  What a great way to drink a five dollar bottle of cab!

This is a hit every time.  I omit Lemons/Limes and add raspberries and blackberries.  Also I buy boxed sangria instead of the red wine.

The flavors mixed very well with eachother. The rum was hardly noticable which makes for empty glasses everywhere! People were drinking it right up! All of the citrus makes the Sangria just tart enough, not overwhelmingly sweet. Great drink!

Delicious-- perfect amounts of wine, rum, and sugar.  I always use the Burgundy wine and light rum for classic Sangria flavor.  Goes fast.

This was outstanding!  I made it for a 'girl' party & everyone enjoyed it!  It did sneak up on you, but that was what we were looking for!  I added in strawberries & a little more sugar and also used Captain Morgan Spiced Rum... very good.

I ended up leaving my fruit to soak overnight and woah it was strong!!  Used the Spiced Rum and Blackberry Merlot as suggested but I didnt like the fruity taste.  We also added some Sprite to the second batch and that was ok.  Next time I'll use Red Wine though for a more authentic flavor.

I made this for a party and even though they said it was strong, they loved it.

I used w=Woodbridge merlot and plain rum as I had forgot to pick up the spicd rum. I made a double batch and only used 1 cup of rum. I used orange-pinapple juice.

I will make this again with the blackberry merlot and spiced rum

I have made this recipe quite a few times now, and it's always very popular.  I never reviewed this recipe before because most of what I had to say has already been said by fifty other reviewers.  However, I wanted to add that the last time I made this, it was in haste, and I accidentally used coconut rum.  It was still delicious.
Also, most of the reviewers have written that this recipe does not keep well, but we found that if there wasn't much fruit in the sangria (just liquid), it actually improves the longer it stays in the fridge.

My first time making Sangria. I served it at what was supposed to be a "snowman tea party". Who knew it would be 70 degree in mid Jan in NC! Too warm for the Spiced Cider. Nevertheless it was a huge hit. I took the advice of others and put some Sprite in it from the start  as I was having some non-drinkers. I doubled the recipe and it was still all gone. I only used 1/2 cup rum for each recipe. I thought it was plenty. I also used a cheap Blackberry Merlot. All of my guests were driving so I did not want it pack the punch many people desribed. I plan to make it again for our Super Bowl Party.

I used lemonade instead of orange juice because I wouldn't drink any leftover orange juice.  I also used only 2 of the 3 fruits listed because my pitcher was already full with those two.  I really liked the recommendations of using blackberry merlot, but I suppose a real wine drinker would prefer something less sweet.

I made this for a get together this weekend and everyone seemed to like it. I followed the suggestions of others and cut the rum to 1 cup and went out to get the Blackberry Merlot---I had never heard of it before but found it with the wine drinks....think inexpensive screw tops.  The amount of rum was perfect but next time I will use a bottle of merlot wine.  This wine product is inexpensive but I'm sorry, I didn't care for it at all.  I added a little more OJ and 1/2 bottle of merlot I had opened the night before to make it drinkable for us.  I'm a merlot fan and next time I will use the wine that I normally buy.

I loved the original recipe, but now I have played with it, and I like it even better.  I use a fruit punch juice (whatever's on sale), strawberries, limes, bacardi limon with the wine and triple sec.  I have also used a chardonay for a little variety.  It has to chill all mixed together for at least 2-3 hours.  If for some reason you have extra, pull out the lime slices and it usually keeps pretty well overnight.

Perfect the way it is! I am a lover of red wine and appreciate its strength and authenticity.  I tried one batch with the blackberry wine and it tasted like cough syrup-- way too sweet- could have been any alcoholic punch recipe.

5 STARS!  Better than most Sangria I've had in restaurants!  I even messed it up a little bit... I read the recipe wrong and poured the rum, wine, & sugar all in at the same time.  It was wonderful still!!  Also, I used the blackberry wine as some suggested!  I'm never letting this recipe go... DEFINATE KEEPER!!!

This was very good, I made it almost exactly as the recope said. I used fresh squeezed orange juice and I added about 1 cup of ginger ale. It was so cool and refresing, even though I made it as an experiment because I have never made Sangria before it was the first thing to go. I had to scamble and make another pitcher, wonderful drink to have at a pool party here in the desert(Vegas)...thanks

My wife is a big fan of Sangria.  Whenever we go to a restaurant that offers Sangria she has to try it.

I made this for her and my mother as art of their Mother Day dinner I was preparing.  I took the suggestion of many other reviewers and used Blackberry Merlot and half the amount of rum.

They absolutely loved it.  I had a glass myself and it was tasty.  Will certainly make again.

This was simply outstanding!! I doubled the recipe, used orange rum and Wild Vines Blackberry Merlot, but still only used 1/2 cup sugar as I put in a small container of frozen, sweetened strawberries.  I also put in 1 each kiwi, mango, nectarine, all sliced, along with the orange and lime.  My grocery store also carries fresh, already cored pineapple, so I also used that.  Eating the fruit after the sangria was gone was a real treat!

I made this for a party of approximately 30 people, including a guest from Spain.  It was such a success.  I did halve the rum (spiced), as others had suggested, and I used pears, grapes, and limes.  To make sure the red wine was not too dry, I used shiraz, which lended a light sweetness.  My Spanish guest commented on how authentic the sangria was, and I overheard another guest telling someone that the sangria was his favorite drink at the party.

Did I do something wrong? After reading all the rave reviews I choose this recipe to serve at a party. I was so excited about it and it BOMBED! Every one said how good it was when they first tried it but then I found full glasses of it all night just sitting around where people had abandoned it in favor of something else. And I still have practically a whole cooler full of the stuff left. I kept overhearing people say how strong it was, and this was a drinking crowd! Oh well, maybe better luck next time.

The best sangria recipe.  Next time I'd add less lime, and maybe some bing cherries or other sweet fruit.  I used a cheap shiraz, and it was fabulous.  For those who think it's too strong, serve chilled over a full glass of ice.  I also reduced the rum to 1/2 cup on occassion.

mmmmmmmm.....I am sitting here as I type this drinking a glass.  I used the Arbor Mist Blackberry Merlot, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Well,not exactly,cut back on the rum to 1 cup- and believe me~ it still has a kick! The only thing I would change in this recipe for "liquid heaven" is definitely add lots of interesting fruits. Although the lime, orange and lemon add great flavor....it would be nice to have another fruit besides the orange to eat and enjoy more of the Sangria:)

This was good!  I based my opinion on Cafe Sevila, this amazing Spanish Restaurant popular in California.  I changed it a little based on other reviews, and to make it taste more like the Sangria at Cafe Sevila.  Use apples!!  If they suck up the rum, it's only wasted if you don't eat them!  And instead of orange juice, add an orange flavored liquer like Cointreau, or if you really want to knock your socks off... Grand Marnier.  This is what Cafe Sevila uses!

Wow!  I first tried this for July 4th and I haven't stopped getting requests to bring it to functions!  I use blackberry wine and in addition to the citrus, I throw in sliced strawberries and peaches.  Be careful...It's easy to drink a lot of this!

I made this last Fourth of July, and it was a huge hit.  I ended up having to make three batches for just six people.  I used Marques de Caceras Cranzia tempranillo with overproofed Wray and Nephew rum as the alcoholic bases, and they interacted quite well with each other.  The thing is, it didn't even taste very alcoholic.  It really snuck up on all of us.

However, if you're going to go the tempranillo route, I do not recommend going the riserva or gran riserva route, or with any well-oaked wine for that matter.  You're going to want a dry but fruity red.  Oak is not going to add to this recipe, because it focuses heavily on fruit flavors.

This is delicious! You can't taste the alcohol at all so it's also super dangerous! I didn't have a lemon, I dumped a can of pineapple chunks in, juice and all. This will be a summer go-to pretty much *every* weekend.

Excellent recipe, I did reduce the rum to one cup as some comments said that 1.5 was too much. Aside from that, it was a delicious sangria. I'd make it again.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving. I let the fruit and the sugar soak in the rum for about 6 hours. I used white rum and added an apple for little extra flavor. It was really good. Everyone enjoyed it. This is a very easy recipe that i will make again.

This was a great recipe for a base.
Next time I will do half a cup of oj as The flavor profile changed a little after a few days in the fridge.Too much orange juice gave it a slight grapefruit bitterness.Replaced the rum with a cup of single malt scotch and used blackberry merlot.You wouldn't think these too flavors would work but the scotch makes it smoother and easier to drink.My buddy and I made a batch and drank 1.5 liter mix in a matter of an hour.When it was gone we wanted another batch.Not drunk just relaxed.

I found this recipe on here about 5 years ago, and with a couple tweaks for personal taste, I've made it my go to red sangria recipe. To me, sangria is a year round drink, but most like it as a summer beverage. I love it with rum, like this recipe calls for, but a neutral spirit like vodka works just as well.  I'm from Texas, where we like things either really sweet, or really spicy, so I double the sugar. Aside from that, if you're in a hurry, you can really just throw all the ingredients together at once and serve it over ice (which you should do anyway). If you're having a party, go ahead and do yourself a favor and make double the amount. Some people like a splash of 7up to top off their glass.

This is the best recipe for sangria.  However, because I am a bit of a light weight, I cut down on the rum a bit.  I also recommend using fresh squeezed orange juice, it really does make a difference in the flavor.  It adds a freshness that orange juice concentrate does not offer.

OMG!!!!  This is one kick  Sangria.  It sneaks up on you, be very careful! The first time I made it I used the Captain Morgan Spiced Rum and Triple Sec.  It was so smooth. I used the Blackberry Merlot and it was wonderful. I used orange, lemon and lime slices. Definately a KEEPER!!! I made it the same way the next time and warned everyone to pace yourself. Look no further this is the one!!

There are many ways to make sangria, but I wanted a basic "jumping off" recipe for sangria I could customize. I doubled the recipe to take to a party where most of the attendees usually drink beer. The recipe worked very well and was completely gone by the end of the evening!

Very easy!  The only thing I changed was to add one pear, as the writer suggested.  So much flavor for so little work and my friends raved!  I used Cruzan rum and Rex Goliath Free Range Red wine.

instead of 1.5 cups of rum i only used 1/2 cup of brandy per batch.  i also did half a lemon and half a lime instead of a full one.  i let the orange, lemon and lime "cook" in the brandy/sugar mixture for a day then added a diced up apple and let that "cook" for 12 hours and then added the wine.  that "cooked" for another 12 hours and then in the morning of the party i added the oj.

enjoy !

A great summer alternative to beer for poolside cocktails! I use blackberry wine and Captain Morgan's spiced rum. I've had several friends tell me it's the best sangria they've ever tasted :) You might want to double this recipe--use a 1.5 liter bottle of wine and the entire 5th of Captain Morgans.

I've tried many of the sangria recipes on this site, and I have to say, this is by far the best red sangria recipe I've tried from ANY recipe site.  So many of the reviews suggested reducing the rum by half and starting there (adding more if desired) so I did make that change, and I'm glad I did.  I will also add a little less sugar next time (I think a quarter cup would be fine), but wow, this is fabulous!!  Since the changes I made were purely my personal preference, I still feel this is a 5-star recipe, and I plan to use this as my go-to sangria recipe from now on.

The only change I made was since I did not have dry wine only semi-sweet I cut back a little on the surgar.  It was very good and looked beautiful in the pitcher.

Easy and delicious! 
I only used about half the amount of rum, and for the wine I found a merlot/zinfandel blend which I thought worked out just fine.  Will definitely be making this again.

Cheap wine redemption! I used white grape peach flavoring instead of citrus.

Since there was only 2 of us, I halved the recipe.  Very, very good!  Next time I will use Captain Morgan or omit the rum all together and use Triple Sec instead.  I used a variety of fresh berries, oranges & apples!  Amazing!!

I lost my old Sangria recipe so I made this one in a pinch.  It's ok but it needed major tweaking.  I used less sugar than it called for and I had to add some extra wine, oj, triple sec and mineral water before it tasted right.  For some reason it was terrible the next day.  I think the traditional recipe with brandy is a better bet.

I liked this but didn't love it.  I just found it too strong for my taste but I am a lightweight when it comes to drinking.  I do have to say that my brother loved it though.

The rum is what makes this Sangria taste like REAL Spanish sangria.  Be sure to use a really good dark rum to give it a yummy full taste.

Fantastic.  I think it is a bit stronger than it tastes.  For poolside, I might cut down on the ABV a bit next time, but very good.

Used 1/2 spiced rum and 1/2 regular rum.  Also cut the amount of rum in half and it was still strong.  Added sprite as well.  Really delicious and everyone loved it.

This was delicious and a big hit at my last BBQ.  I used a 1.5 liter bottle of Yago Sangria, increased the rum to 2 cups and kept the rest of the ingredient amounts the same.  It went down great and was just as good as I've had at Mexican restaurants.  Highly recommend.

I made this over the summer, and it was perfect..... in addition to using lemon, lime, and orange slices, I also added white nectarines and strawberries to the fruit mix. The white nectarines were SO great - really gave it a nice flavor. I would not recommend cutting the sugar in half. Absolutely delightful! Guests just rave about it. I have been getting asked for the recipe all over the place. I put 7-up out for people who wanted to add a splash to their glass to water it down and give it some carbonation. But most everyone loved it the way it was. And the strawberries the next day after sitting in the alcohol mix all night???.....WOW! Look out! Strong, but delicious!

All in all, I thought it was a great recipe...very classic with easy-to-find ingredients. The important step seems to be the 2-hour marinating time in which the fruit and the rum get "happy". I used a white merlot for the wine, and it was well balanced. (I don't care for really dry, woody wines.)  Alcohol content is really personal preference, and for me, this recipe had twice as much rum as I'd like, so I will cut the rum in half next time. All the party goers enjoyed thje sangria as well, but most chose to cut it with Sprite or OJ. I will definitely make it again with less rum.  Thanks for sharing this :-)

OMG this Sangria is just perfect! I did leave it on the fridge overnight and just before serving added 2 cups of Sprite! Apart from that I followed the recipe as it is written and it was a huge hit!  I made it for a baby shower and everybody loved (except the pregnant lady who didn't drink it ;-)  We are having friends over for a bbq and I am making it again! Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe

I made this in a 2 1/5 gallon jug Used 2 oranges, 2 lemon, 1 1/2 lime a package of Blackberries, and half a container of strawberries. I used 2 c. of rum, 1c of brandy, 1c. sugar, 1 c orange juice... i let all that mix for an hour or so then dumped in 1 liter & a half bottles of the cheapest merlot at wal-mart. will fill with ice to cut it down a bit (willbe sitting out allnight) and have club soda and ginger-ale for those who need to cut it down a bit but just taste tested it and WOW!!!!! that it a big ol' jug of trouble it is fabulous and i expect it to go quickly...since i made 2 containers showing up with 5 gallons of sangria may just make me the hit of the party!!

Absolutely amazing! I did take the advice of others with the Blackberry Merlot, and lightened the intensity with a cup of lemon lime soda... and WOW! MY husband and I will be making this recipe once a week now when we sit out on our patio enjoying the sunny weather.  Perfect summer evening drink! Thank you!

Lovely!  A smashing success!  I have not had many sangria drinks in my time, but this recipe might just change that.  It was very potent but not boozy.  I used a cheap shiraz and a combo of fresh orange and grapefruit juice becuase thats all I had on hand.  I also used some pinapple juice left over from another punch I made that night.  Not a big deal.  I went used 2/3rds the rum called for in the first batch but went all in for the next round.  The fruit looks lovely when it turns red.

This sangria is the biggest hit at BBQs!  I follow the recipe except I specifically add Captain Morgan spiced rum (instead of just any rum).

One of the best drinks I've ever had, though I've never had sangria before.  Make sure you put in enough orange juice to ward off the flavor of liquor.

This is a hit wherever I serve it, although it is pretty strong.  Depending on the crowd, I replace up to 1 cup of the rum with orange juice, and it's still delicious!

It is strong; so be forewarned. My girlfriend fell asleep on the edge of my tub with her hiney in the air giraffe style after I served this at my baby shower.

I love this recipe because it is so easy and wonderful.  I am sort of a light weight so I add some 7up or Ginger Ale to spritz it up and bring down some of the alcohol content.

I did not care for this recipe.  All you can taste is the rum.  We had to add an additional 2 cups of orange juice then mix it half and half with sprite to even drink some of it.

I made this for my hubby's birthday and it was amazing! I used a 1.5 Liter bottle of cheap merlot and added an apple, marachino cherries to the fruit. I also added the rum with the sugar and fruit the night before the party and let it sit All day to let the flavors develop. Yum!! I had to warn my guests about the rum because they didn't believe there was very much in this recipe. Boy were they wrong!!

I used merlot, splenda, pears, peaches, and oranges.  I loved the pears!  I thought it was very good, but it did get some of my friends a little loopy, so i ended up diluting each glass with about 1/2 sangria, 1/2 diet lemon-lime soda.

This was awesome!  I made 2 pitchers w/ only 1 cup of rum each.  My guests said this was great & really strong.  I loved the Arbor mist blueberry merlot.  I do not recommend drinking any leftovers the next day, I had half a glass & was getting a buzz, plus the flavors were too harsh, not as fruitty.  I'll be making this for parties all the time now!

A hit!! It was gone within minutes. We even became desperate after it was gone and dumped a bottle of (good) cabernet into the pitcher, hoping to recreate this awesome drink. No such luck :(   Will make again (after my liver recooperates!!) LOL

LOVED this!!!!!  I had a party and this was such a hit.  I took everyone's advice and cut the spiced rum in 1/2 and used the blackberry merlot.  I used fresh cherries and apples instead of lemons.  Wouldn't use apples next time.  I thought the fruit was too strong and I made about 8 hours prior.  In case you are trying to make mass quantities like I was I used a double batch (12 servings) for each punch bowl and it fit perfectly.  I made 3 punch bowls (6 batches) for about 17 women.  What a hit!  They were all talking about me making this "next time". lol  The orange juice ice cubes were loved.  I made Cranberry Sierra Mist (it's new) ice cubes too for a festive look.  I also added some pomegranite for a Christmasy look.  Be prepared to giggle drinking this:)

I found it a bit too strong for my taste the first time around and so I decreased the rum to a 3/4 cup and doubled the orange juice.  I've been using Planter's Punch "Golden" to give me the best flavor. I also find that I have to increase the amount of fruit to prevent it from being "stolen" before the Sangria is finished.

I used only 3/4 cup of rum to have mercy on my guests and used a spanish red wine called "Sangre de Toro."  It was quite delicious.  The next time I make it, I think I will omit the lemon since that was the fruit that was least enjoyed.  Thanks for the recipe.

I brought this to a pool party this weekend, and it was soooo good. I used a bottle of Black Opal cab/merlot blend, tropicana orange juice, 1 1/4 cup spiced captain morgans rum, and added a small bottle of blackberry seltzer. I added lots of different fruit (orange, lemon, nectarine, fresh cherries (pit removed), and a drained can of fruit coctail!) Perfect for a summer afternoon party!!

Perhaps I should have used spiced rum as some people have suggested, but I used white and found it to be a fairly harsh-drinking sangria.  I'll probably try it again and switch a few things around.

Delicious!  However when I made mine I used a grapefruit instead of an orange (there was a mix-up at the grocery). I also used Malibu Banana Rum with a Merlot.  I will definitely make again and maybe reduce the amount of sugar. It doesn't need the total amount of suggested sugar (or at least the way I made it ;) )

Made this over the weekend as well.  It was just "o.k." - nothing too spectacular.  I let it sit overnight after reading some suggestions, but felt that it was too thick to drink.  Maybe will use some sort of carbonated orange soda next time.

A little strong but delicious! I add sprite to my glass sometimes if I don't want to get too tipsy!

I made this for the adults at my daughter's 12th birthday party which we had on Cinco de Mayo.  It was excellent and my first attempt to make Sangria.  This is definitely a keeper.  I used regular rum, and never thought to use spiced rum.  I will try that next.  I did add extra orange juice because it seemed a little strong at first.  Maybe a little less rum would work too.  I will be making this again.

We only used 1 cup of the rum, and the taste of it was still pretty strong. I think 1 and 1/2 cups would have been too much for us. I served it for Mother's Day, and everyone cut their drinks with Sprite. Made them really yummy and fizzy and little lighter and more refreshing. We'd make this one again.

Perfect for any Mexican meal. Careful though it will sneak up on you. Works well with flavored rums and different types of fruit.

This was really good sangria.  I also added apples and strawberries, which were really good.  I only used 1 cup of spiced rum.  I also used a cheap blackberry merlot, and it was sooo tasty!

Wow!  Amazing!  I used only 1 cup rum (good enough!), blackberry merlot (yummy!), and instead of lime/lemon/orange, I used blackberries/raspberries/apple slices/strawberries.  Delicious!!!  I can't wait to get home from work and finish the rest off!

I cut the recipe in half as it was just hubby & I, used a pinot noir, added maraschino cherries, used Bacardi Gold becasue I am out of white rum & cut it down to 1/2 cup (remember that I cut the recipe in hlaf), added  more OJ to help tone down the alchohol flavor (Bacardi Gold has a stronger rum flavor than white) & I did need to add more sugar. The rum-soaked fruit was phenomenal...even the lemons.  Thansk Lisa...this was wonderful!

Very good recipe, was a hit during my New Year's Eve party.  It was a bit strong with the rum. Next time will try a little less amount.  Very easy to prepare.  Will definitely prepare it again.

This was sooo good.  Just one thing though - I had to double the wine and orange juice because the rum was way too much.  Will make this again and again with 1/2 amount of liquor.  Thank you for my new favorite sangria recipe!

Wow! This was very good and easy. I used a merlot and thought the flavor was very good. Next time I think I'll try spiced rum. The whole pitcher was gone....and there were only 2 of us! Will definitely make again.

This is really good! I used an Australian Shiraz/Cab blend. I didn't modify the recipe at all except to add a splash of lemon-lime soda in the glass. I will make this again, it would be great for a party.

This is worthy of TEN STARS!  !!  This was my first attempt at making homemade sangria and I sent the recipe home to a few of my guests.  I followed all the great reviewers' advice and used Blackberry Merlot as well.  Make sure you do not mash your fruit too much or you will get pulp in the sangria.  Only make as much as is needed since I discovered it does not keep well overnight.  One last note:  It looked so pretty in a glass pitcher with all the fruit floating in it.  Fabulous presentation too!

This recipe was a huge hit and my husband drank all of it in one weekend! I followed the recommendations of using blackberry wine and 3/4 cup of rum so that it wasn't too strong. I am not a big drinker so I am always thrilled to find a drink that I truly enjoy. I have already made another batch for this weekend. It is best when prepared and allowed to refrigerate overnight.

Excellent. As per others' recommendations I cut the rum by 1/2. I made two batches, one with blackberry merlot and one with red burgandy and the general concensus was that the merlot one was a little better. I used lots of fruit. Just be sure everything is very cold. I didn't get the wine cold enough so I had to add ice.  Thanks for sharing!

Went through 2 pitchers of this stuff for 4 drinkers! It was wonderful and refreshing.  It is so important to let the fruit marinate in the rum and sugar for at least 2 hours. My second batch was much better. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe received rave reviews at a party that I recently had. I added fresh strawberries for an interesting twist. Absolutely delicious and it really packs a punch!

Great recipe.   I did reduce the rum to 1 cup.  I also addes white nectarines, pluots, apples, pears and grapes.  Everyone loved it.  They were so giggly.

The Best!  Used Captain Morgans Parrot Bay for the Rum.  No adjustments needed!  Outstanding recipe.

This was a very tasty and very potent sangria.  After two glasses, my guests were definitely feeling no pain.  My only changes were I added another 1/4 cup of sugar and 5 strawberries (halved).  I might try one more recipe to compare since this was my first time making this drink.

I followed the recipe and used the red burgundy wine as it suggested but it was much too dry and tart for me.  I thought the orange juice and fruit would flavor and mellow out the dryness of the wine but it didn't. I wasted almost half of the batch I made. Don't think I will make it again.

Not my favorite - too much rum flavor, too sweetly sticky.  I made it for a large crowd - a chili cookoff and not much was drank.  I didn't have a large enough container for the fruit and rum and sugar, so I used a plastic bag. Maybe my proportions were off?

I made this drink for a party, and got some mixed reviews. I'm not quite the rum drinker that I thought I was and the amount seemed a bit much. I suggest cutting back a little on the rum. It did however make the fruit quite tasty!!!

Very nice drink. A little on the potent side if you are having a few in the sun. You can cut it with club soda. Also try adding a sliced kiwi and two shots of Contreau. Mmmm.

I made a double batch using one bottle of merlot and one bottle of cabernet. I reduced the rum to 1 cup per batch (using 2 cups total for the double batch), and I used spiced rum as some reviewers suggested. WHAT A HIT?! It made for a wonderful evening with some good friends.

By far this Sangria was the best I have ever had.  It was restaurant quality.  I have served this on several occassions and it always gets rave reviews.  I used blackberry Merlot and Sangria wine along with Myers rum to soak the fruits in. Yum!

I've made this on a couple of occasions to rave reviews.  I sliced the orange, lemon, lime very thinly and placed them in a pitcher with the rum and sugar and let it sit overnight.  Before I left for my party, I added the OJ and wine.  It was amazingly good!!  Also, I just used a Cab I had opened a few days before for marinara sauce and didn't like enough to drink on it's on.  Great way to get rid of a red you don't love! :)

Potent stuff!!  It's sweet, so it goes down easily - too easily!!  I decreased the rum to 1 cup (plenty of rum!) and served it over a glass full of ice.  We made the second batch with a homemade raspberry merlot - good that way too - delicious recipe!!  Thanks!

This recipe i have been using for years and people pretty much lick the pitcher clean!  I just made this for Labor Day weekend to take to the beach and my boyfriend drank more of it than I do and he hates wine!!  I usually bring either 7-up or Sierra Mist to cut down on the strength because it is STRONG!!

Unreal!  I have made this several times making my own adjustments each time, and it's always a winner.  Just about any fruit works well, and I buy the cheapest wine possible and it's still great.  I always get compliments when I make it and if you use the amount of rum called for in the recipe, look out!  It'll sneak up on you!

Absolutely wonderful! Reminded me of when I was in Spain. I think next time, though, I might cut back a little on the rum. Either I'm a lightweight or that's pretty powerful stuff. The flavors were fantastic, though!

I agree with some of the reviewers about using spiced rum (Captain Morgan's) - it adds a unique flavor.  I have served this at two parties and both times it was gone before all of the guests had even arrived.

A huge hit with my boyfriend!  I used a little more Captin Morgan than what was called for (to make it a little stronger) and added more citrus fruits (orange, pineapple).  A wonderful summertime drink!

YUM!!!  This is such a good dish!  I thought it sounded good just by reading the recipe and by reading the reviews from other users...but it was even better than I had expected.  I am not much of a cooker and found this dish very easy to make.  My husband went nuts about it and is already asking me to make it again!  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you, this was a great hit at a party I had to give.  I used some of the the other reviews and used the spiced rum and blackberry wine.  I also added apples, peaches, and strawberries.  I made a double batch and there was none left over, everyone loved it.

This recipe is awesome.  I've made it twice, with rave reviews both times.  The first time I made a single recipe for a superbowl party.  It finished in fifteen minutes.  The second time I doubled the recipe for a baby shower, and it was gone in a few hours.  Next time, I'll have to quadruple the recipe, and then we'll see.

I have been wanting to make this recipe up as our local fav Mexican has a wicked Sangria which we often enjoy with our friends.  So for a Friday easy dinner at their place I  made this with tequila rather than brandy, all the citrus and apple.  Then threw in strawberries, because I had 3 packs in the fridge.  It only got an hour in the fridge so hadn't really developed fully.  But sure went down well, the dogs loved the apple pieces, and even ate the orange peel.   I need to make again.

I loved this!  However, I let it marinate in the fridge for 12 hours and did not add the sugar.  (I don't like overly sweet drinks). It was delicious!

This is the worst recipe for Sangria I ever made and I've made plenty.  Think about it:  1 bottle of wine, 1-1/2 cups of rum tempered by only 1/2 cup of  OJ.  I've been to Spain and never encountered sangria like this.

Very strong, but very good drink! A few of my friends cut it with sprite, because they found it too strong. Would make again!

This was a big hit with my book club-not a drop left!  The only change I made was to decrease the rum to one cup: we needed our senses because we still had to discuss the book!  Muy delicioso!

It was excellent! I used organic cane sugar and melted it with half of the orange juice first. Also used organic orange juice, and citrus fruits.

This was a very good recipe, very close to what you get in Spain. The only thing I would change is add more fruit and a little less rum, maybe a cup instead of a cup and a half.

I made this for an outdoor party; it was super-easy and everyone enjoyed it.  I used blackberry merlot and spiced rum.  I misread the recipe and thought it called for only 1/2 cup of rum … I actually used 3/4 cup and that was plenty, especially since  I now see a lot of reviewers are complaining that the rum is overpowering.  Also, in my opinion this doesn't need any sugar at all.  So 4 stars because of too much rum and sugar, but after cutting back on those ingredients I would give it 5 stars.  Also, I made ice cubes with fruit-flavored sparkling water to keep the mixture cold without diluting the flavor too much.

One of my guests said this was the best sangria she ever had which is not bad considering it was a gathering of people who had spent weeks hiking through Spain on the Camino de Santiago.

This was wonderful and very authentic. It was strong but didn't taste boozy. I used spiced rum and used some seltzer to cut it. As with many things it was better the next day and the few days after :) I will be using this again

Very fun drink! As suggested, I cut the rum (3/4 cup) and even still it has a kick! Instead of sugar, I use one cup 7-Up. I often mix the liquids and let it sit overnight and then add the fruit slices a few hours before serving. My friends love it as well and we're all HAPPY!

This is a good hearty sangria.  When I make this again I would cut the rum in half.  Taste later and see if more rum is needed.

AWESOME!! Made our camping Sangria Saturday Great I did use the Spiced rum and Raspberry Merlot ( Found in the desert wine section).  Will use less sugar next time it didn't all dissolve. Definitely in my camping cookbook and my home cook book

Great recipe.  Adapt it however you like, using whatever fruit and wine you like.  Add spritzer/soda water to dilute a bit.

Delicious!  Made it as written with a very high quality, smooth, white rum.  Served it at a Moroccan themed dinner party.  The menu included Moroccan marinated olives, homemade hummus, toasted pita chips, zucchini patties with tatziki sauce, blood orange, beet and fennel salad, Moroccan Braised Beef from this site, and Israeli couscous.  I have zero leftovers!  Dessert was a beautiful lemon cheesecake from Anna Olson's cookbook.

I've made this several times for our now infamous Sangria Sundays...very much in high demand!  This is so smooth that you will never know what hit you!  I recommend using a wine that you know you like because it makes all the difference.  And just go ahead and double the recipe, you will not regret it!

Our first try with sangria, and we like it!   I didn't have orange juice, so I used pineapple/orange juice.  Reduced alcohol a little, just because we didn't want it too strong.  Used ~ 3/4 cup spiced rum, and ~1/4 cup Triple Sec.  Since I had them, we used frozen cotton candy grapes for ice cubes.  ~~~ We enjoyed this very much!  We don't drink often, but when we're in the mood, I'm sure we'll have this again!

I made this yesterday for a BBQ. My family are not big drinkers, so I used 1 cup of rum instead of 1 1/2 cups. I also made the sangria all at once & put it in the fridge for a few hours. I was a perfect amount of alcohol. I recommend adding ice to your glass. It was a refreshing drink on a hot Florida day. Ill definitely make this again.

I made this for my annual Kentucky Derby party because no one really cared for the mint juleps I had been making.  This was a really big hit.  I did use the blackberry merlot and cut the sugar in half as some suggested.  I went through two pitchers of this in an afternoon and had requests for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again next year...and I probably will make it even sooner.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and every time it gets rave reviews from my guests!  I typically substitute a double bottle of wine which yields more and the taste isn't compromised.  Also, it tastes better if you let the fruit soak the rum overnight.  Definitely make a double batch because it will be gone by the end of the night!  That said, warn your guests that it packs a punch.  I've had a few people stand up at the end of the night unaware of the affect.  Great for patio parties - happy summer!

Super useful! Really glad my cousin introduced me to this website. I did make a couple of changes in terms of the fruits used.

2 Limes
2 Plums
1 Apple
1 Lemon
1 Orange
1 Pear
6 Strawberries
20 Blueberries
12 Raspberries
10 Grapes

I washed them all, cut them thinly, and placed them in the pitcher. Poured in 1 cup of Rum and 1/2 cup of Sugar, and left it to soak for 2 hours straight in the refrigerator.

After 2 hours, I took them out and added half a bottle of wine followed by a cup of Orange Juice. The end product was just amazing with the Sangria looking blood-maroon in hue. Must try!

I made this for a dinner party I hosted,  which was Latin themed,  and the sangria was perfect.  I actually  made double the quantity so I had enough for the entire weekend! Would definitely recommend!

This was really tasty.  I used an inexpensive White Merlot (it's really red and not white) and dark rum. The fruit, sugar, and rum macerated for about 24 hours. This was purely unintentional but really enhanced the flavor profile. You definitely need to be mindful of your consumption of this delicious beverage. It will catch you off guard and pretty quick!

I used Red Diamond "Temperamental"  wine and half the rum and sugar.  I also added about a cup of ginger ale.  It was delicious and there was none left over!

Oh, wow. I made this for Thanksgiving tonight, assuming I would polish off the leftovers when my guests left. Not possible as they drank every last drop! I read reviews and used the recommended spiced rum and a big cheap bottle of blackberry merlot.  I only had 3/4 cup of rum left, so I added a little cointreau to make a full cup of liquor.  My fruit (lemon, lime, apple, strawberries, pineapple) soaked in the rum/cointreau/sugar/orange juice all day, and I added the merlot before bed last night.  I also poured in some ginger ale before serving for fizz. Everyone loved it. My aunt said it was the best sangria she's ever had.  Thanks for the recipe! Will use this again for parties for sure.

This was a huge hit at my girls night and party last night. I used two oranges sliced in rounds, a lemon, a lime, three different types of apples, about 25 strawberries sliced, and a pair (I needed to make a huge batch). I put all of the fruit in a container, put about three quarters of a cup of sugar over the fruit, and then added 2 cups of very high-quality spiced rum. I let that soak in the fridge overnight, and then in the morning, I poured about a cup and a half of orange juice and three bottles of wine over the fruit and rum mixture. I let that sit in the fridge for another couple of hours before the party. I served it with ice on the side, and everyone loved it. Couldn't get enough of it!! Because of the high quality rum, no one has a headache today either. :-)

After a week in Spain I decided to make my own Sangria instead of buying it in restaurants.  I found this recipe online.  It was so delicious, went down so smoothly & had a bit of a kick. When I went to put it back in the refrigerator I found the OJ sitting on the counter.  Oh my, what a tipsy accident.  I have repeated it with great pleasure.

This was my first attempt at making sangria and it was fantastic. I made minor changes to the recipe: reduced rum and sugar to 1 cup of spiced rum and 1/3 cup sugar. I cut up an apple and a pear and soaked them with the lemon and lime (I forgot to buy oranges so I did not use those). Next time, I might use more rum but would not add any more sugar. Fantastic recipe and everyone who tried it loved it as well. The apples and pears were a great treat to snack on after the sangria was gone!

Fabulous drink! I let the fruit and rum sit for about 5 hours. Very simple to make. Everyone at my party loved it....when it was all gone i made more but it doesn't taste the same when you don't let the fruit and rum sit  a while. I will absolutely use this again and try to play up the fruits.

Made this as written except I used only 1 and a quarter cups of rum, and I found even that to be too much rum. I used Bacardi and Trader Joe's merlot. It made a little too much for my pitcher but looked very pretty and was yummy chilled. This was the first sangria I've made and it was very easy.

Double batch, cheap red blend, spiced rum, same citrus fruits plus frozen pineapple and mango chunks - YUM!  I've made it before, always a big hit.  The one thing I do differently, because I didn't read it wrong the first time, I just put it all in a glass pitcher at once and let it mull 3-4 hours.

I used arbor mist blackberry merlot 1.5 liter and mostly doubled the ingredients. Used sailor jerry spiced rum but only about a cup and it was still pretty strong. Also added some triple sec and raspberries. Turned out great!

Delicious and refreshing. Kool-Aid for grown ups. My cousins in Madrid taught us to add some orange liqueur (Cointreau or Triple Sec) for a little extra kick. And if you can, let this sangria sit for two days before serving--5x more delicious. Serve icy cold with slice of the marinated citrus--it will be a gorgeous purple color after a day or so in the wine. Great recipe! Thanks!

Made this with spiced rum and it was amazing!  What really made it a treat was having leftover drunken fruit, draining the dregs.  Yes, it's very strong, but the citrus component really makes it nice and smooth.

I've never made Sangria before and thought it would be a nice addition to our summer bbq.  I used the spiced rum and soaked the fruit overnight.  When I went to purchase Blackberry Merlot - based on other recommendations, the clerk at the liquor store said it was a very sweet wine.  So - being worried it would be too sweet - I bought a regular Merlot and it was perfect!  This one is a keeper!

UPDATE: SOME OF MY GAL PALS AND I VISITED A LOCAL WINERY RECNETLY (TOUR AND DRINKS!). I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PURCHASE A BOTTLE OF BLACKBERRY WINE!!! I MADE A SECOND BATCH OF SANGRIA WITH SPICED RUM AND A MIXTURE OF RED / GREEN APPLES AND PEARS. WOW! ALTHOUGH MY HUBS PREFERS THIS WITH MERLOT, HE REALLY LIKED THE FRUIT. THAT'S SAYING A LOT SINCE HE PRETTY MUCH HATES ANY AND ALL FRUIT! :) Pretty good! I am not a wine drinker at ALL, but I really enjoyed this (especially with spiced rum)!!! Having said this, I do think this could use a touch more sugar. Had I been able to find the blackberry wine I wanted to use, this might have been sweet enough for my liking (I had to use Merlot instead). Next time I'll be sure to plan ahead so that I can stop at another grocery store to look for it. I will also substitute pears and apples for the citrus fruits since my hubby thinks they would soak up the booze better lol. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Lisa. I can't wait to make this again - and again! :-)

I liked the general plan for this, simple and quick.  I like my drinks sweet, and even with 'sweet' red wine this was a bit too much for me.  I added Sprite directly to my glass, and that made it perfect for me.  It is quite potent, though.  Not that I'm complaining . . . .

I bartend for a living and was so embarassed. Should have known better! Will not make this recipe again-- sorry.

Very festive -- made for a small potluck dinner at my house.  Ideal for a spring or summer event - so refreshing!  Of course I modified it based on what I had on hand -- I added some sprite and club soda (almost an entire 2 litre bottle's worth) to make a larger amount -- the sugar is necessary at that point. Also added some apricot brandy (about 1/2 cup).   I had some leftover limeade made up as well so I added that (about 2 cups -- note: this was NOT substitued for the OJ -- that was added as well.) Guests raved about it and said they wanted the recipe.  It did look pretty with the citrus fruit slices in a large glass pitcher.

I've served this at a couple of parties now and it's a huge hit - even with the guys!  I use spiced rum and an inexpensive chillable red wine, and the flavor is wonderful.  If you leave the rum-soaked fruit in the pitcher, you can keep adding red wine all evening without compromising the flavor.  I like to serve it with ice and extra fruit in the glass.  Watch out though - a couple of full glasses tend to knock your socks off!

This was a tasty, easy-to-make sangria.  I cut the rum in half and added cherries.  My main qualm is that what makes the sangria taste good--the citrus fruit--is annoying once you go to drink it.  Do you strain the slices?  Do you eat them?  Eating them makes a mess.

Next time, I think I'll make this sangria the same way, but before serving it to guests I'll strain out the citrus slices and throw in only edible fruits, like pineapple, apple, or cherries.  I don't know how that will affect the taste, but the experience might improve?

I just tasted it - it comes off a bit sweet, but ice in my glass will help that.  I think this is a very nice, simple version of sangria, and will use it again.  I only used one cup of rum, but that was plenty for me.

Great recipe! I have used this several times. Last time I used smoking loon cabernet with a blackberry flavor. This time MadHouse Wife Cabernet, but wished I had used there Merlot has more of a blackberry flavor. I also had to make a non-alcoholic batch so I used a 64oz bottle of Red Grape juice instead of the wine and rum, perfect!

After following the directions...it was quite strong.  But after adding another bottle of red wine...much better.  Easy to make and tasted good.

I love this drink!  It looks pretty in the pitcher, it tastes wonderful, and it's fun to serve!  I used Tortuga spiced rum and Barefoot Merlot (they support Surfrider Foundation!).  This was pretty strong- much better for a night at home than taking somewhere and driving afterwards.  Today I only let the fruit soak in the rum for about 3 hours, but next time I will let it soak overnight to get a stronger effect.

It was the hit of the party!!  I did soak the fruit the night before in rum and OJ.  The fruit I used were plums, orange, lemon, lime, apple, strawberries and blueberries!!  I used a bottle of blackberry merlot, and 1 bottle of regular merlot!!  It was gone in no time!!!

This was great; my mistake was too not print out the recipe and try to remember it!  I added 1 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup and it was a little too sweet!  We still drank it.  I let the fruit, wine and rum mellow in the fridge for about 4 hours!  I'll try again and follow the directions better next time! :)

Awesome and simple, would add some fruit next time. Can't believe how easy this goes down, you can barely taste the alcohol! Doesn't seem to taste any better the morning after so perhaps leaving it overnight isn't necessary. Goes great with a paella!

We truly loved it.  I used spiced rum as suggested and only 1 cup.  We didn't want to get to snockered.  I also added a little bit more OJ to match my husband's taste.

This is one of the easiest and best sangria recipes I have found. I used spiced rum and a merlot. I only used 1 cup of the rum, which was plenty. It was a little sour with the lemons- I will omit them next time and add more cherries and strawberries. It was a little heavy and sour, so I added a splash of lemon-lime seltzer water, which was perfect. It got great reviews, and I will definitely make this again!

If you have had authentic Sangria this does not measure up.  I made this recipe because I had everything on hand however, there was too much rum for my taste and was lacking in flavor.  With a little doctoring up, with sprite and a simple syrup it was pretty good but next time will try another recipe.

I love this recipe and so does everyone who tries it.  I'm thinking of substituting peaches for the citrus fruit and using Capt Morgan spiced rum.

Easy and oh so good. Served this for "girls night" and it went over great! I did decrease the amount of run to 1 cup and substituted 1/2 cup Spenda for the white sugar. Will make again very soon!

The rum is what did it. I went a little lighter on it just to be safe. I will use it all next time. My wine was sour, but everybody still raved. This recipe could save a bottle of vinegar.

Easy to follow recipe.  I'd recommend soaking the fruit overnight.  I added apples to the citrus fruits.  I made it last year for a barbeque and there was very little left at the end.

This was pretty good. I have to admit I used spiced rum, as suggested in some reviews, and it was WAY too sweet for our tastes. Next time I'll either leave out the sugar or use plain rum as in the recipe. I diluted it a bit with Sprite to cut down the sweetness, and it was very good!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used Cabernet wine, spiced rum, pomegranite liquor, oranges, lime, lemon, cherries, orange juice, and apple juice.  The sangria was a little stronger than I wanted, so I added 1/2 cup of apple juice and 1/2 more orange juice.  I was a little short on the rum, so I made up the difference with pomegranite liquor.  It's fantastic.  It tastes just like the sangria at our favorite Spanish restaurant.

Fantastic! We had a can of mango juice on hand and added that as well along with some Contreau. It was a huge hit and this is easy to convert to a white sangaria as well with white wine.

I made this last night in preparation for a dinner party tonight. I used a cheap OJ, and a cheap jug of Burgundy and Captain Morgan's. It came out just great. Had my brother, who went to Spain and loves Sangria, test it. He really liked it. Should be a big hit tonight! Thanks.

This was excellent & everyone loved it!

I did tweak the recipe a bit.  I still used only one lemon, lime, & orange, but doubled everything else.  After mixing everything, it tasted too much like rum/alcohol for my tastes, so I added more orange juice (prob. 1/2 to 1 cup extra), & more sugar (around 1/2 c. extra).

I have made this for plenty of parties and have been told this is better than the sangria in Spain.  I took someone's advice and use Captain Morgan's spiced rum.  I add a pear and an apple to the recipe and usually use at least two bottles of wine (usually a cabernet that is somewhat cheap or on sale).  Have given the recipe to many others.

This is a great drink. I made it for our house warming and it disappeared so quickly. I had to make 3 other batches.

I used apples and oranges, which worked really well. Used a box of cheap red wine and spiced rum. Perfect.

I brought this to a Sangaria party and it was not a hit.  I only used one cup of Rum, added 2 cups of OJ and a cup of Ginger ale.  They still found it stong.  Four stars because My husband and I and one of my friends husband really liked it.

Great base recipe!!!  I juiced up some mandarin oranges, soaked a lemon, some mandarines and a bottle of marachino cherries in one cup of Captain Morgans for a couple of hours.  Then added a cheap bottle of Reisling and a cheap bottle of red.  Totally sneaks up on you, I have the headache this morining to prove it!

Very good Sangria. Easy to make. But oh so strong! One cup will leave your head swimming. You may want to cut back on the rum or mix the sangria with ginger ale or Sprite.

I made this for a halloween party a couple of weeks ago and within an hour all of this was gone! (I had made 2 pitchers) Using spiced rum and using plenty of oranges made this even better. 

Make sure you have plenty on hand!!

Very potent, but very good! I added a little grand marnier to it as well, but I did add about triple the amount of orange juice (if not more)to mellow it out a bit, as well as a dash of club soda.

I was kind of disappointed with the recipe. Based on all the reviews I thought it would be FANTASTIC...it was very good but it was incredibly strong. Not a drink you should have ore that 2 glasses of (which I learned the hard way:)). I'll make this again, but will add more orange juice and will top off with lemon-line soda as suggested by other reviews.

Delicious!!  The only change I made was I cut the rum down to 1 cup. I didnt think this was too strong at all, if you load the glass with ice and the sliced fruit before adding the sangria. Perfect recipe, I will be making this again. Perfect summer drink while sitting outside on those warm summer nights.

This was a total HIT... If you don't like try wine,try Riunite Lambrusco and 1/2 the sugar. And because it DOES creep up on you, add Sprite to tone down. Even toned down, it left everyone SUPER “relaxed"  ;)

Let's just say 20 servings were made and left many asking for more. 
Enjoy responsibly!

Fabulous!  I made the pitcher as is, which my husband enjoyed, and I topped my glasses off with flavored seltzer, which was to my taste.  I also cut the citrus fruit into wedges and squeezed the juice into the pitcher, which made the citrus flavors more pronounced.

Yummy...I've never had Sangria before, but always thought it looked tasty, so I decided to give this a try.  I used nectarines and plums since they were on sale, but I bet this would be great with pears as well!!  I only used one cup of (spiced) rum and it was still strong so I believe the amountin the recipe to be a bit excessive.  I followed other reviewer's advice and used blackberry merlot.  This was delicious, I cannot comment on the authenticity of this recipe, but it sure does taste good!!!

excellent. I don't care for a super sweet sangria and this one hits the mark. I like to put a hearty splash of cold and just opened club soda to the pitcher.

I did not add rum...I was just trying to use up some red wine that I had lying around.  Maybe that was key to making it on the sweeter side...it just came out like cold tart red wine with fruit.  It was cool and refreshing though on one of the first super warm nites.  Will try again with rum or vodka.

I am not a wine-lover. I've tried wine and other mixed drinks and do not like the alcohol taste. Suprisingly enough though, the sangria was great! We followed recommendations and added sprite to individual drinks for the fizz. Very light and fruity. I know NOTHING about wine and just picked one from the grocery store - we used Luna di Luna Red wine and it turned out great.

This Sangria is delicious!  Our friends could not say enough great things about it. There are two steps to the recipe which does make it a bit involved but well worth the effort. We will always use this recipe.

This is not a drink for "non-drinkers"  I was hoping to make a punch for a party that would appeal to the masses, this was not it.  Most people left their glasses half-full.  It may have been the wine I chose, but I was disappointed

I had a "fiesta" themed dinner party and this was hardly touched. One person had one glass, another person tried it and said it "burned her throat". I had two glasses just to get rid of it. I thought it was "OK". I bought a fifth of rum and a bottle of wine to make this...seemed like a waste of money.

I added apples, and cut back on the rum to just a cup.  It was a huge hit at the party.  Be warned, it packs a punch and a hangover!  I will certainly make again.

this stuff is yummy!! has a great kick to it.....something you don't feel till the 2nd or 3rd glass. only thing i'll change next time is a wee bit less sugar. i added apples and they absorbed most of the rum i think...lol. but still much better than most of the stuff you get in restaurants.

This is my favorite Sangria recipe!  I've made it a number of times and I always end up seding at least one person home with the recipe. Depending on the crowd, I either use less rum and more OJ or vice versa.  I also like it with apples in addition to the citrus fruits.

Great recipe for Sangria!  I double the recipe and served it at a dinner party for 12.  Use the blackberry wine, like everyone recommends.  Turned out delicious.  Even the people that usually don't like Sangria were drinking it and enjoyed every last drop!  This is definitely a strong drink and socks a good punch. Cheers!

Delicious!  I made this Sangria for a party and it was a hit.  I wanted to make sure that I didn't spend the entire party in the kitchen cutting up fruit so I actually put the fruit, rum and sugar together ahead of time and let it soak overnight.

Don't know what I did wrong but this came out very strong and bitter tasting. It may have been that the red wine wasn't the best. I mixed it with 7up and poured it over ice and that helped some.

This is so, *so* good.  As I was slicing the fruit I also decided it was probably too much, and ended up using only half of the lemon, lime and orange.  I also added 2-3 sliced strawberries.  I used Bacardi Limon, because that's what I had in the cabinet. (and a cheap Merlot)  I think I used slightly less rum than the recipe called for; I didn't really measure it.  For those who don't like to taste alcohol in their drinks, this will be too strong, but should be good if you cut it with some lemon-lime soda or ginger ale. (and if I make this for guests I will have some available for them, but I love this as is)   I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for a Mexican themed dinner party & while it tasted okay, I thought there was too much fruit & not enough liquid.

Whoa! I love my drinks strong, and this fit the bill. I added extra lime and lemon juice, and mixed the rum between lemon and white. I used some cheap tempranillo I had lying around - I definitely wouldn't use "carbonated wine" like Arbor Mist.

I LOVE sangria.  This is a great recipe...however my rum was VERY strong.  I would recommend putting a 1/4 cup at a time in until it is balanced.  I had to make 2 recipes because my rum overpowered it.  I know you all feel sorry for me.  Some other great additions:  peaches, apples, and concord grapes (my favorite addition).  I would make it at least one day in advance--2 if you have the fridge space.  It gets better with time.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This recipe is a great starting point, but it's way too strong even for folks who like liquor.  I added more orange juice and some lemon-lime soda (like Sprite) to tone it down.  It was a HUGE hit after that.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

This stuff will knock you on your keester!

We do "low carb" so I do not use the sugar or orange juice; instead, I add 1 can of Splenda-sweetened diet soda like Hansens's Tangerine Lime.  I also reduced the rum to a cup or less.

Try Gallo's Hearty Burgundy for the wine!  Delicious and it improves over a couple days (if it lasts that long....)

I thought this was fabulous!!  I made a double batch for a barbeque this weekend and there wasn't a drop left. This was one recipe where I did not totally agree with the suggestions of the reviewers.  I purchased Blackberry Merlot for this recipe and found that it was just too sweet.  I actually had to open a bottle of plain Merlot that I had in my wine rack and add it to the pitcher to cut the sweetness.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.  Oh, and I did use the Spiced Rum as suggested.  Thank you for a great summertime drink!

The best Sangria EVER. The only changes I made was to use 1 cup of spiced rum and to add nectarine and champagne mango along with the citrus. I got many compliments and recipe requests.  I'll definitely be making this again (and again, and again)!  Thanks Lisa!

So delicious!  Perfect for a summer afternoon on the deck with the grill fired up!  I used a couple bottles of Merlot from Trader Joe's (inexpensive) as well as some apricots added to the citrus fruit.  It was wonderful!  And I have lots leftover (expected a bigger crowd than I got for dinner!)  Thank you Lisa!  This recipe is a keeper!

This has turned out to be a favorite among family and friends.  I make the more potent variety and everyone loves it.  The most difficult thing about the recipe is chopping the fruit.  I use lemon, lime, orange, apple and black plums.

We made a punch bowl of this sangria for a brunch party and it was a HUGE hit!  Used about a third less rum (spiced) and cheap merlot.  Put in strawberries, kiwi, and maraschino cherries, in addition to the citrus.  Yum!  Will definitely make this again!!!

The best Sangria I have ever made!  I used only 1 cup of rum to tame it down a bit, and it still tasted fabulous.  The drunken fruit at the end was delicious.  I also added 1/2 triple sec/Grand Marnier.

I made several pitchers for a dinner party a few months ago... used Bacardi Gold in some and Christian Bros brandy in some.  Forgot the orange juice (oops!) but it was awesome anyway!  Got LOTS of compliments on it.  Got complaints that I hadn't made enough...

Not impressed.  I used Columbia Crest Merlot/Cabernet blend and added peaches and apples like others suggested.  I blended the sangria with 7-up and without that I don't think anyone would have drank it.  I took this to a Memorial Day picnic so I made a double batch based on the reviewers comments and ended up throwing away over half of it.

This recipe was good but not GREAT!  Very strong on the rum if you follow the recipe given - next time I will cut back on the rum, and sweeten up a tad more to taste.  I will say it was gone by the end of the party!!!

Very good.  I did reduce the rum, as others suggested, to 3/4 cup.  I used a $3.00 bottle of merlot and threw in some strawberries.  Will definitely be making this quite a bit this summer!

Wicked Good Sangria.  Ignore what they say about apples and pears.  Add them both and then crush the fruit with potato masher or spoon afer the Sangria has sat overnight.

this recipe is excellent.  It takes just like I remember from Spain.  I reduced the amount of rum to 3/4 cup and used only 1/3 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice.  That really made the recipe a lot better to me.  I LOVE Sangria!!!

This recipe is fantastic!!  I have made it many times and every time people have asked for the recipe.  I used light bicardi rum and cheap burgundy red wine both times.  I have had several sangrias and this is wonderful!

I made this for our New Year's Eve party and it was a hit!  Everyone was sad when the pitcher was empty.  I halved the amount of rum and used regular (not blackberry or any other flavor) inexpensive merlot - it turned out delicious.

WOW! I didn't think I would like this because I don't like sweet drinks but it really wasn't all that sweet. I did use 1 1/2 bottles of wine (because I had one open). My guests loved this and declared it the best sangria they ever had.

Incredible!  I followed everyone else's advice and cut down on the rum a bit, and diluted it just a bit with club soda.  I used Cabernet Sauvingon and it was fabulous. Great recipe, total hit with everyone!

I used this recipe twice, and it is really great.  It's much, much better than the sangria that restaurants serve.  Blackberry merlot, as suggested, works well, as does 750 mL of 80-proof rum (gold or dark rum).

AWESOME RECIPE!!  Use kiwis, strawberries, blueberries, and oranges for fruit.  Used 3/4 cup of spiced rum which was the perfect amount.

This recipe is a hit!  To save time, I juiced the orange, lime and lemon, skipping the floating fruit and 2 hour "flavor development" phase entirely.  To save my liver, I cut the rum content in half. 
Finally, we served the sangria in tall, ice filled glasses, continually refilling the ice.  This makes for the perfect summer, out on the deck drink!
Yum yum.

This sangria was wonderful.  I added a little more sugar just because I prefer added sweetness.  But I will definitely file this recipe and use it often!

VERY VERY GOOD RECIPE!! Big hit here tonight. :) I will definitely be serving this alot. I used all the fruit this called for plus lots of strawberries. We used the blackberry wine. I only had 3/4 cup of rum in the house..but it was still very strong that way. SO we added some sprite to the pitcher as well. 
Very good combo!!!

This was good even though it was quite potent.  I made it for a 4th of July barbecue and all the guests loved it.  I typically don't serve Sangria over ice but found it worked well with this recipe since the ice made it a little less strong.  I also added some Sprite for those that were overwhelmed by the rum.  I tried one batch with inexpensive wine and another with mid-price and the cheaper stuff was better.  Very festive and the chopped apple I added was mmm, mmm good!  Good recipe!  I highly recommend it!

I was expecting clear sangria.  It wasn't.  I used Chlien Merlot, vitamin OJ, and dri-light rum.  OJ wasn't crystal clear.  Wrong wine too??

My friends love this recipe and it's easy to make.  My only caution is that you may want to reduce the rum as the drink is strong but deceptive.  I always caution people against eating too much of the fruit also.  It's only fun when you know how much you are drinking!

I made this for a bridal shower and it didn't go over too well.  I think it was just way too strong.  Next time I'll dilute the wine with a clear soda of some kind.  I used burgundy wine and only 1 cup of rum.

I've made this recipe twice, and both times, I've been asked for the recipe!  Some of the folks did add some ginger ale, and said it was great like that too.  Easy - both in the making, and in the going down!  Will make again and again!

I made this exactly like the recipe said (ok- a little less rum) and it turned out fabulous. Since it packs quite the punch my dinner party got off to a roaring start and just continued going on that way!
