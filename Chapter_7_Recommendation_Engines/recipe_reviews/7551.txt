I made this to go with some banana pancakes. I knew the pancakes would have really strong flavor all by themselves, so I didn't want a really flavorful syrup, but this was basically just sugar. I think next time I will try adding some nutmeg or something...

I decided to try this recipe for an Allrecipes faceless recipes challenge (recipes without photos). It has a good flavor. It kind of looks like melted butter, but has a taste like a not overly sweet butterscotch. I made 1/2 recipe, because I didn't need a full cup of syrup. I also lowered the sat. fat a bit, and it didn't seem to affect the recipe. For half the recipe I used 2 Tblsp. of butter and the rest a light margarine and used 1% milk instead of evaporated to avoid wasting a full can for the small amount. I have found that syrups tend to turn to a caramel on med-high, so I cooked it on medium or 5 on my stove. According to the introduction, it is meant for cakes, but it was fine warm on pancake puffs (ebelskivers).

My Auntie made this delicious syrup everytime we came over for pancakes or waffles. It's been my all time favorite ever since. When I was a young woman I tried, and tried to make this same syrup, but to no avail it would never come out like my auntie's, the butter would never melt so it would be lumpy and cold. JUST NO GOOD !! NOW WE HAVE RECIPES ON THE INTERNET, AND I JUST NOW FOUND MY AUNTIE'S SUGAR RECIPE RIGHT HERE, I'M SO, SO HAPPY TO FINALLY HAVE THIS RECIPE!! INCREDIBLE !!
Thank you "All Recipes.Com" for always having the recipes that I need, all that I have to do is go to your website, and anything I need is right at my fingertips. AWESOME!!

I poured it over individual cakes made using the fruity bundt cake recipe from this site. Love the way it looks. Only thing to note is that it cools very fast, so it would be a good idea to have all cupcakes ready before making the sauce.
