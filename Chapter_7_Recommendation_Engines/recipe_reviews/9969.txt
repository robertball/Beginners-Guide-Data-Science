Nowhere near the Italian cookies from Bensonherst, or any Italian bakery.  Much too dense.  Don't make these if you're looking for the little leaf shaped or ladyfinger shaped cookies that are filled with jam and dipped in chocolate...these are not it.

Very good cookie - they have become a staple in my Christmas cookie collection.  I do not add the red food coloring.  I use a pastry bag with extra large star tip to pipe them and then put rasberry perserves in between  two, dip one end of the sandwich in chocolate and colored sprinkles.

These were better than the bakery cookies... I made them with 1 and 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour and 2 and 1/2 cups white flour and left out the food coloring... I couldn't get them to work well with the cookie press (may have been the warm day) but I rolled them into finger shapes and popped them in the fridge so they were cool before baking... spread raspberry jam in between two and dipped them in melted chocolate and sprinkles: SO GOOD!

These cookies are outrageous TJ! I used a raspberry jam filling, dipped one side into melted chocolate and then into red and green sprinkles. Delicious and very pretty to boot! Thanks so much!

MMMmmMMM, tastes sooo good...reminds me a of the gingerbread shaped, chocolate filled butter cookies from the bakery.  *Just a quick tip: if you want the texture of the Italian butter cookies from the bakery that are chocolate dipped with sprinkles on one side, substitute half the all-purpose flour, with cake flour, and bake 2-3 minutes longer. It adds that iconic crumbly texture, and is absolutely to-die-for- when you sandwich with your favorite jelly/preserves in between.  My Favorite!

I made these last year for Christmas and will be making them again this year.  They were perfect!
I put raspberry jam in between 2 cookies then dipped one end in melted chocolate then colored sprinkles.  Just like a NY bakery cookie!
Thanks!

This is the closest I've ever gotten to the cookies I got in the bakery when I was a kid!  I also skip the food coloring.  The other change I made was to use only 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla and added 1 teaspoon of almond extract. I also use raspberry or apricot all fruit to sandwich them and dip the ends in really good dark chocolate! That made them taste more  like the cookies I remember.  Thanks!

If I could give it more stars, I would! These cookies are absolutely delicious. Not super sweet. I didn't sandwich them. I made some with raspberry jelly in the center, others dipped in chocolate and some with only sprinkles! You have got to try this!

Very very very good! Makes a beautiful cookie using the star tip on your cookie press and snake down to desired length. I used the chocolate/hazelnut spread for a quick yummy filling. Thanks for the recipe TJ. You saved me a few trips to Brooklyn.

Absolutely delicious...even better than bakery quality!   These disappeared in minutes.  I didnt have a pastry bag so i dropped dough by tablespoons and spread out into 2" bars and baked 7-8 minutes until edges were lightly brown.

These cookies are great!  I made them without the vanilla and food coloring and used some peppermint extract in the dough and in the melted chocolate.  I brought them to a tutoring session that I ran the other night and they literally evaporated.  They are really nice because they keep their shape well during baking, and once they are cooled they aren't flimsy, so they are easily transportable.

These were the right taste and texture.  They are just like italian bakery butter cookies.  I sandwiched mine either chocolate or raspberry jam.  Dipped the ends in chocolate and colored sprinkles.  I could not stop eating them.  I will use this recipe again.

This is a very versatile cookie. It would do well as a  cutout cookie as well. I paired mine with strawberry jam for the middle and melted chocolate and drizzled it over the top of the cookie. They are not to sweet and have enough flavor to stand on their own even if you don't want to add a jam or preserve to it. Make sure to work with the dough when cold when it gets warm it becomes to soft to work with. Love and recommend this cookie to everyone.

Thanks TJ! This recipe is extremely versatile and produces exquisitely light cookies. I used 1/2 soy/1/2 rice flour and egg replacer without the food coloring. I used the pastry bag with 1/2 the batter and the rest I rolled into a column, refrigerated, and sliced before cooking. The cookies remained light with a slight crisp after completely dipping 1/2 the batch in white chocolate and making maple creme sandwiches with the rest. This recipe is a keeper in any recipe box!

Haven't tried these yet but Not sure how to get 1 1/2 eggs.  Adjust the recipe to 18 for 1 egg or double for 3 eggs.  I might try the 1 whole egg plus one yolk like someone suggested.

Excellent recipe - I'll be using this from now on. Great taste and texture. I omitted the food coloring - they look beautiful with a few sprinkles or chocolate dipped. Anyone else wondering what 1 1/2 eggs are? I used two yolks and one egg white which worked very well. Is this correct? I bake often but haven't previously seen a recipe calling for part of an egg :)
