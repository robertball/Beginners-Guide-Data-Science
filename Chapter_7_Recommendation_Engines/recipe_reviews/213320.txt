The reason for only 4 stars is that I made too many changes,but the basic recipe is a good start to play with.My changes - upped servings to 8, used 2 lbs mild Italian sausage, 1 lb 4% fat ground beef,1 cup finely diced onion, 1 can Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup,instead of milk I used 1-1/2 cups BEER and 1/2 cup GOOD Sherry Wine (NOT cooking wine), used 2 15-oz.cans of Northern white beans, left out the stuffing and cheese. Followed the directions as written. Came out great. A Keeper for sure.

This is a very quick and easy recipe! I've been fixing this for my family for over a year now. My whole family LOVES this dish! I use Polish sausage, not Itailan Sausage and it's wonderful!

Looks kind of unappetizing; tasted okay.

Excellent!  Wonderful, unique flavor.  Easy to make.  I increased the sauce and the stuffing mixture as we were not serving the casserole with any bread, pasta or rice.  I also added mushrooms.  Everyone was impressed with this different but tasty recipe!

Great recipe!  My 3 year old even liked it.  I made two changes: I swapped the amounts for the sausage and ground beef and used red kidney beans instead of white.  This is a keeper!
