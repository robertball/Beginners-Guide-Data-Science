I found these INSANELY good! And so simple, in terms of the short list of ingredients.  If you are unfamiliar with making meringue:  definitely use a mixer.  Don't rush making the meringue - it's worth it to really beat the stuff! A minute or two on the first part to get the "soft peaks" - then probably every 20-30 seconds adding the sugar.  In any case, do it until it SHINES snow white.  Also, as the "batter" does not expand much, if at all, you really can crowd all 30 of these onto a good-sized cookie sheet.  Small ball of meringue (about the size of a large marble) for the kiss to sit on, then cover it over.  Boy did I love this recipe...

This is a terrific and very elegant-looking recipe.  For a baby shower, I made half of the puffs pink and half white.  It looked very nice, and everyone was very impressed with how delicious they were! Just make sure you beat them very very very well.  You can't overbeat these but you CAN underblend them.  Also, I didn't grease a cookie sheet, I put them on parchment paper, made it very easy for cleanup and they popped right off. Thanks.

Wow! Fastastic cookie.  I found the previous reviews really helped.  I made sure that the cookie sheet was well greased so the cookies just slid off.  JBEER's "go slow" directions helped me to make the best meringues I've ever done.  All my big kids want this cookie again.

Wonderful!  I used Reynolds new quick release aluminum foil, and it worked great!  Next time, I am going to put the meringue in a bag and "pipe" it on...this would make them look as good as they taste!

These are yummy! The egg white mixture got very thick, so it was a little hard to work with for covering the kisses.  However, the result was well worth the effort.  The chocolate stays soft and melty long after they've cooled.  Yum!

These were not what I hoping for. Maybe the day was to moist but they were not light as air, they were a little sticky. The flavor was good but don't think I will make again

Tasty little treats! I would definitely make these again, except that this time, I would leave the oven on for a few minutes instead of turning it off as soon as the cookie pan goes inside. I shut it off and left the cookie sheet in the oven overnight as the directions suggested, but the chocolates didn't melt inside the merengue. They were still tasty and looked great because I tinted the merengue with food coloring and dusted the tops with colored sugar. This recipe is a keeper!

These were a little time consuming, but tasted great. I made them with Hershey's Mint Chocolate Kisses for Christmas and everyone loved them.

I really enjoyed this light flavorful cookie! I didn't grease the cookie sheet enough with my first batch and all the kisses fell out!! But the second batch came out pperfect and delicious! I added green food coloring and green sugar sprinkles for a "chirstmas tree" look!

I have made this recipe a couple of times in the past.  At Christmas, I like to divide the recipe batter in hald and add green & red food coloring to the meringue.  This makes a festive treat.  My family loves these cookies.

I must have done something wrong, b/c I did not have the same pleasant experience with these that others did. I will say the finished product does LOOK beautiful - very pearly white. However, the taste left much to be desired, and the kiss didn't change consistency at all. I would recommend putting the kiss on quite a dollop of the meringue, as some of mine lost their "bottom."

These cookies are so delicious! A great recipe. :-)

I found it easiest to swish the Hershey Kisses through the meringue before I put them on the cookie sheet, rather than daubing some meringue down first. 
I had enough meringue to make at least fifty of these treats, but I made them rather small. 

I "forgot the cookies" overnight, but found them to be rather sticky and gooey the next morning. I took the cookies out, and reheated the oven to 375, turning it off before I put the cookies back in. This stiffened the meringue very quickly, and melted the chocolate.

Delicious and wonderful when eaten fresh out of the oven. It's a delightful surprise for others who you'd share these treats with. Easy to make, but unfortunately, doesn't keep very well.

I made these cookies for my sister's wedding shower. They were something different than your usual fare but......I would not make these on a hot, humid day. They just don't set right. They did taste good though!

Delicious.  These were crunchy from the sugar on the outside, yet warm and moist on the inside.  And the cholate kiss gave it such a perfect finishing touch.  I put these in Christmas goody bags for my friends, and this cookie kept on getting complimented.  Thanks!
