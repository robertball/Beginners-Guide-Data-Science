I made this for a baby shower and it was a big hit! But I made several changes to give it more color and flavor, per other people's suggestions. I used garlic/herb feta cheese and added 2 T. chopped black olives, 1/2 c. toasted almond slices, 1/4 c. roasted red peppers, chopped and one more egg. Also, I used phyllo shells instead of the pastry dough. This was MUCH EASIER! I scooped 1 t. into each shell and baked at 350 for 5-8 min. The colorful ingredients made for a great presentation in the shells. I recommend buying 60 shells (4 boxes) for this recipe. Also, I made the feta mixture ahead of time and froze it. Then thawed overnight before baking and serving.

These were a hit at a Christmas party recently.  Instead of doing the foldovers, I put the mixture in little mini fillo dough shells (in the freezer section)  That cut the prep time down to 3 min!  YUM!

These were very good.  My family enjoyed them a lot.  I made these in advance, froze them and thawed in the fridge overnight and followed the heating instructions.  I'll be making these again!

This is my favorite appetizer recipe and they go like hotcakes every time I make them.  I use Athenos feta, double the green onions, and add diced red bell pepper to 1/2 of the mixture so I can offer two different flavors.  I think brushing them with the egg mixture makes them look a lot nicer, and you definitely have to let them cook until they are puffy and golden brown.  They stay very hot inside for a long time, so warn your guests to be careful if they grab them right out of the oven!  Next time I will try the flavored feta cheeses, as other reviewers have recommended, for a little zing. But, these are melt in your mouth delicious just the way they are!

This is an appetizer that looks more difficult to make than it is.  It's really very easy to put together and the pastries have a nice taste.  Based on some of the reviews, I used feta with sun dried tomatoes and basil instead of plain feta.  I would like to try them with the plain feta to see which I like better.  I did have some trouble sealing the dough (maybe I was too greedy with the filling) but I was pleased that the cheese didn't leak out all over during baking.  Although I just made them for my husband and me, I wouldn't hesitate to make them for company.

These can make anyone look like a caterer! I've made these several times now and everyone loves them. I use quite a bit more green onion, and I also add toasted pine nuts (the key is "toasted"!) which give a wonderful crunch. Pine nuts can be a little spendy so sometimes I use toasted slivered almonds. They are a tad time-consuming to prepare, but can easily be done the day before - just cover tightly with plastic wrap and pop them in the fridge/freezer, then brush on the egg yolk right before you put them in the oven. The fork-sealed edges are the key to the professional look!   
*** NEW TIP ***: After making these for years, I decided to try and simplify by making them pinwheel-style (see photo) and it worked out perfectly. I just thawed both of the puff pastry sheets, equally divided the mixture between both sheets (width-wise), rolled them up, sealed the seams with water, and then carefully cut each log into 12 pieces using a sharp serrated bread knife (a non-serrated knife would squish them). Somehow this made them even more addictive than the triangle version :o)

I cheated and used the prepared filo cups from the freezer section.  They turned out great and got a lot of wonderful reviews.  These will be on my quick and easy appetizer list.

I made these for the Super Bowl Party. They were very good. I made the filling according to the recipe but when buying the pastry dough each sheet (2 per pack)cuts into 9 almost 3x3 squares= 18 per box I still had plenty of filling. I coated them with the egg wash and seperated them into layer with waxed paper. They stuck to the wax paper, next time I will spay it with Pam first. They stay hot for quite a while so it is a good one to take to a party and they are fresh.

These are so good. I received many compliments on them from Feta lovers. I used the garlic and herb feta- and I wouldn't use anything else.

These were so delicious!! I made them for our annual Christmas Party, and they were gone in no time! I did get 18 appetizers from each package. Made them the night before, popped them in the oven as guests arrived, and they were wonderful.

These weren't very good.  I made them as an side with a Greek pasta dish and didn't even serve them after I tasted the first one.  I love feta cheese and I've had similar appetizers that were wonderful.  I followed the directions exctly and feel that something (not sure what) was definetly missing.  I will not make these again, at least not with this recipe.

The best part about these was the puff pastry. The filling left MUCH to be desired. I even added garlic and parsley but still very bland and dry. I love the little tasty pockets of puff pastry with the egg wash though. Just needs a better filling. Maybe mixing the feta with some cream cheese and adding a vegie would help. I will make these again.

Changed the recipe around quiet a bit - used garlic and herb feta, added extra green onions, and put the mixture in phyllo dough shells instead of making fold-overs. Was super fast and easy with a food processor!

I made these one week before Thanksgiving.  I brushed them with the beaten egg mixture, froze on cookie sheets, then carefully wrapped when frozen.  On Thanksgiving I put them on a nonstick baking sheet that had been lightly sprayed with Pam and baked at 15 minutes at 375. 

They puffed up beautifully and were really enjoyed by my company.  This was a very easy appetizer that can be custom made and frozen for an easy last moment appetizer.

I would give this 4 stars as written, but with my adaptations it's 5 stars for us! & I love the idea, I probably never would have thought to make something like this.  My changes: I added garlic & lemon juice to the feta mixture and then baked it in crescent rolls (I really disliked how it tasted in puff pastry shells). I used 2 cans of crescent rolls (just drop a spoonful of feta mixture in & roll up, then bake as the can says). I had some feta mixture left over, could have probably made another half can or so. This makes approximately 16-20 crescent rolls.

I have been looking at this recipe for several years now and finally decided to give it a try. I did read the reviews and made some adjustments that I felt I would like. They were enjoyed by my Christmas guests. First off I bought the prepared phyllo mini cups. This made for very quick prep and they were easy to serve. You can make 30 mini phyllo cups out of the recipe. I used half feta and half mozzarella. If you truly love feta, I would say 100% feta would be fine. However, I felt that for my guests, the half and half would be better. I did add some sundried tomatoes. I really think roasted red peppers would be a great addition, but I didn't have any. I also used the tomato basil feta. This recipe is very forgiving. You can use any cheese and any additions that appeal to you and I think the end result would be very satisfactory. I have never used the phylo cups before, but I sure will continue to use them in the future. What a great idea!

These went over really well!! I made them with crescent rolls instead of the puff pasty and I didn't coat them with the egg white.  They were flaky, buttery and delicious, so good!

This recipe is so easy to make and your guests will always be impressed because it looks like it took a lot of work.  Sometimes I add sauteed spinach in these.

Armenians call this "Borek" my family has been making these since the beginning of time and it is at every family gathering. Just a few things I do differently. I use one egg and use the white in the cheese and the yolk with a little cold water to brush on top. I don't use the onions and I do use black pepper in the cheese and sometimes I add other grated cheese to it to give it more flavor. I also sprinkle sesame seeds on top of the turnovers before baking. All of the other variations are great but the the way I make it is the traditional Armenian way. One variation I make sometimes is adding sauteed spinach and onions in with the cheese. SOOO good!

I made these last year at Thanksgiving and they were such a success, I had to make them again.  This year, I used the tomato basil feta cheese for a little extra flavor.  I have also made them with cresent rolls rather than puff pastry, which turned out great as well.

These were a BIG HIT at my holiday party this Christmas (2001).  I made them a day ahead of time and baked as needed.  To the recipe, I added finely chopped sun dried tomatoes and black olives.  My cousin thought some pine nuts would have made this recipe remarkable.  I will keep and use this recipe from now on.  I had folks who dislike feta cheese like this appetizer (I am one of them!)

I through a party recently and this was on the menu. My family is originally from the Ukraine and only prepare recipes from the region. I am a vegetarian and have my own picky habits. My friend and her husband were there as well, he pretty much only eats meat and fast food. All people with very different tastes in food. Every one loved these! My friend's husband ate most of them, my mother just called and asked me to bring some to her party this weekend, my boyfriend said they were better than his mothers....all this and they're SO easy to make!!

I really love these and so does the hubby. However, they kind of remind of french fries...once they get cold, the flavor really dies down.  It's just not the same, so word to the wise...these are best served hot out of the oven.  Or reheat them in the oven if need to.

Thanks to Carolina Chick's recommendations, I had one of the best appetizers, ever! I used phyllo, just like she said, but the sheets, not the shells. A bit challenging, but the results...worth it. Just follow the directions on the phyllo box. Now keep in mind that you need to take the phyllo out-of-the-fridge with at least 2 hours in advance.this a restaurant /catering  quality appetizer. I will make it again! Thanks Christine L. For a wonderful recipe.

I personally didn't think there was enough cheese in each bite, all I tasted was the bread.  But I am rating it a 4 star bc this is just my preference, and my husband said there wasn't room for more cheese, as he made this one.  I added onions and olives and a little red pepper as well and used the garlic and herb feta.

Thank you for this awesome recipe! My Boyfriend's family was over for breakfast and I made some of these (altered to my preferences of course) and they were a huge hit! Instead of feta I used goat cheese, spinach, sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms. Delicious!

Yummy!  I cut each sheet of puff pastry in the package into 9 squares, making 18 squares/servings total. I used tomato basil feta in half, and garlic herb feta in the other half.  I folded one flavor into triangles and the other into rectangles.  It's easier to seal if you put egg wash on the edge as a "glue" instead of water.  I've also made these with cheddar cheese and broccoli instead of feta and green onions when we ate with a family that hated feta.

These look very gourmet and impressive when served--they were a big hit last year as Thanksgiving appetizer and I will definitely be making them this year, too!  I like to add fresh ground pepper and a sprinkle of cayenne.  These are delicious!

Winter 2004: People loved these at our housewarming!  I used feta with mediterranian herbs as suggested by other members.  I also doubled the recipe by using two-six ounce packages of crumbled feta and two-seventeen ounce packages of puff pastry.  (I still used only 3 tbs of green onions and one egg.)  Thanks Christine !
Update Winter 2008:  Couldn't find mediterranian herb feta so used garlic herb and they tasted great.  Only used one tub of crumbled feta with two packages puff pastry.

Very easy to make, and very delectable.  To add a little more color to it, I sprinkled some of the remaining spring onion on top.  It made the table look gorgeous.

GREAT! YUM!  Big hit with the feta cheese lovers such as myself - others were so-so on them.  Made 18 pieces (each sheet of pastry divides neatly into 9 squares), followed other instructions exactly.  Before baking they looked very, shall I say, "rustic" - very home-made looking - not at all fancy - but once they baked, they looked absolutely beautiful, even-sized, the filling stayed inside, outsides were lovely flaky golden goodness.  They were still quite large for appetizers, but at room temp they divide nicely into halves for the appetizer platter.  They also reheat fine in the microwave.  I am certainly going to try some of the other filling suggestions given here and try some of my own ideas.  Great recipe, thanks!

I really enjoyed these as appetizers. I made 1/2 with just feta cheese and 1/2 of them with feta cheese with mediterranean herbs already added. The plain feta was good but the herbed version was better. I struggled a bit with my puff pastry because it was pre-cut in larger than three inch squares so I had to press it together and cut into the right size. I will definitely experiment with different flavored feta cheeses or make this with tiny diced ham added to make it more breakfast-y.

Use egg WHITES, not yolks for the egg wash.  I thought it sounded funny to use yolks, but I followed the recipe anyway and these ended up very heavy and the pastry didn't flake up and rise like it should have.  Other than that, my family thought these tasted good.

Very good, but I made a few changes, too. I made half with goat cheese and brushed these with egg whites instead of egg yolks which gave them a better look, just like you do when you make an apple pie. Also, I filled a few with the grease of smoked bacon to give it a little more of a pop.

Filo would be better. You can't fit much filling in these and the pastry totally overwhelms the filling.

I made the feta mixture the night before and it still turned out yummy. I also added more green onion, red bell pepper finely chopped, and artichokes finely chopped. It added a really great Mediterranean flavor!

I used these at Thanksgiving as a snack we could munch on while we were all cooking the main course. I added red peppers and green onions and two eggs instead of one, and the flavors were great! I used the prebaked phillo shells also, and baked them for about ten minutes, and they were perfect. As a matter of fact, I think next time I need about six batches of these, because they were gone in fifteen minutes! I'll be doing them again every year...my husband is already bugging me to make them for Christmas!! Thanks for a great recipe!

These were pretty yummy.  I'd like to give it a 4 1/2!!  I used garlic and herb feta and added some sun dried tomatoes to half of the mixture and some artichokes to the other half.  I also used premade phyllo cups to make it easier/faster.  I definitely recommend them, they are rich though so maybe not for everyone.  I added some bacon crumbles to the tops of mine, I think that is a must!  Will definitely make these again!

Yummy!!!  Thanks to some other reviews, I also made just a couple of changes.  I didn't have time to let regular puff pastry thaw, so I used refrigerated crescent roll dough instead.  I ended up with some long thin triangles that were surprisingly delicious and very tasty.  I used regular feta, but added a bit of garlic powder, dried basil, salt and pepper, and sundried tomatoes (diced very small).  I will definitely make these again!!!

A big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner.  I used the flavored feta cheese.  I froze them unbaked and then baked them frozen about an hour before serving - baking time approximately 30 minutes.

These were delicious, a big hit at the party.  Instead of folding them into triangles, I put the filling into the middle of the square and brought all the sides up and twisted them so they looked like little presents.  Fantastic, thanks for a great recipe!

These were very good. I made them for our company Christmas party, and received many compliments. I didn't brush any egg over the tops- it saved time, and wasn't necessary. It is very necessary though, to use flavored feta like the garlic and herb feta by Athenos. It adds a lot. I think they may be bland without it.

Easy to make! Versatile! Delicious!  I made them for a church function and they were gone-everyone seemed to enjoy them.  If you love feta cheese, this is a great recipe.  I used basil & dried roma tomato feta.  My husband saw me pull them out of the oven and said they LOOKED delicious (and he didn't know what I was cooking!).  Thanks Christine for sharing!

These were very good - I used spinach instead of the green onion, they received rave reviews and were very tasty.  They came out larger than I expected but I guess you can never have too much of a good thing!  I'll definately be making these again.

I made this for a Christmas Potluck and it was a complete success! BUT I have to be honest, I didn't really follow this recipe at all.  I decided to make both a veggie and meat version.

In the veggie version I put spinach, feta, havarti, mozzarella, cheddar, celery, black olives, green onions, cilantro, and a pinch of pepper.

In the meat version I put spinach, a tin of salmon, a touch of mayo, feta, cheddar, mozzarella, celery, cilantro, and a pinch of pepper.

In both cases all ingredients where finely chopped.

Why all these ingredients you ask?  I wanted to please both my vergiterian and meat lover friends, and that's what I had in the fridge.

I think the key is to make sure it's a mixture that has a little bit of stickyness, otherwise it all falls apart when trying to put it in the pastry.

This delicious appetizer was a huge hit.  I definitely recommend being a little creative and having fun with this one.

Cheers Glen

I would give this recipe 10 stars if i could. I served this at a baby shower and i was told by a few people that i should go into catering (at which my husband laughed hysterically). This looks and tastes more complicated than it is.  Perfect for serving guests.  I also used the tomato & basil feta cheese for added flavor.  At the recommendation of another reviewer, I tried some using crescent roll dough...they were tasty, but not as good as the puff pastry, and not as presentable.

These are great.  I have made them a few times.  I have trouble working with such small squares, instead I cut the dough into 4 squares.  I make these for myself as a side with soup.

My Greek mom would kill me if she knew I was making tiropites (feta cheese puffs) this way but this is a simple recipe when you are in a hurry for something flaky and hot for an appetizer.  I used pastry sheets cut into squares, but they have to be thawed out well so you can fold them over and so that the fork marks keep the sides stuck together.  You get a lot of pastry and only a little filling with this method of making cheese puffs, but they are pretty and flaky and people really enjoyed them.

I have made these several times for company and holidays.  Everyone loves them.  They give the illusion that they are difficult to make but in actuality are very simple.  Also, it is great that you can make them ahead and bake them right before guests arrive or even while guests are there.

This was a recipe I was skeptical about and once again I am thrilled I stuck to the recipe. I had never cooked pastry puff before and took me a little bit to get use to but besides the proper thawing of it this was so simple and delicious! It is great as an appetizer or to have during the meal.

No need for olives due to the saltiness of the feta already.  Or use less olives.

Good recipe.  It did not go over well at our get-together.  But I had many people who were game to try it.  I personally liked them.  The main comment from them was that it was just a tad too much feta.

These were delicious!  I'd never really worked with puff pastry, but it was an easy appetizer.  Following a few reviewers suggestions, I added some chopped sundried tomatoes that needed to be used as well as some kalamata olives.  It added a little flavor.  My husband couldn't get enough of these!

These were ok, but not something I'd rave about. They'd probably be better with a more flavorful feta as some commenters have posted.  The green onion was pretty tart.

Very good! I used the flavored feta cheese and added in spinach and mozzarella cheese. I forgot to put in the green onions but it came out great. I also used the preshaped shells. Made it really quick to whip together. Will make again!

3 stars for the original recipe...however, I added some mozza cheese and spinach to the recipe and used phyllo pastry instead, and it was definitely a 5 star recipe.

Hi, I made these and thought the feta cheese by its self is way to overpowering the feta needs to be mixed with some other cheeses or something wont make again,

sorry.

My family makes a Maltese appetizer that takes forever to make.  The crust on these can't compare, but they continue to get rave reviews when I make them.  I can't stay away from making them every chance I get.  I did use egg white instead of yolk to brush, seems to  make it flakier.

These were a rich, savory appetizer.  I used garlic and herb feta, and added a little extra green onion.  I had plenty of filling to go around, but not too much.  This was my first attempt with puff pastry and I'll make these again.  I think I'd like to try these with more veggies too: spinach and sun dried tomatoes for starters.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made with Sundried Tomato Feta, then added some garlic and seasonings and they were amazing! Next time I will probably add prosciutto or roasted red peppers to give them some substance.

I cooked the things too long and put too much egg on them, so they came out all crunchy and plain..They were all gone, but a disappointment nonetheless

these were a big hit with my family variety of appitizers. This is a recipe that can be changed just a bit to add your favorite add ins (chives, crumbled crab, or sundried tomatoes are great)to make a variety of appitizers.

They were good, I only gave them 4 stars because I thought that they could definately improve by the addition of small  bits of chopped up fried bacon.

I had an 8 oz. bag of spinach I needed to use up, so I wilted that in a TBS of butter and added it to the feta mixture. I didn't have any green onions, so I sauteed a minced yellow onion in another TBS of butter and also added that to the feta mixture. I tasted it, and my personal preference was to add a tsp of fresh garlic in there too. I forgot I wanted to add some cracked black pepper, though. Such a great recipe to use as a palette for your own palate.

The presentation on these was beautiful. However, they do lack flavor with just the plain feta. I believe I will try the flavored feta as some reviewers have suggested next time. I also may add some small bits of meat, like ham or bacon.

The puff pastry was great, but difficult to work with. I found a full mounded teaspoon was a bit too much and it tended to leak out while cooking. Also, somewhat bland. Add some green pepper, or red pepper for a bit of zing. Also could have added 1/2 a teaspoon of Frank's Hot sauce to give it a nice flavour without making it hot.

This recipe was a huge hit at Thanksgiving and Christmas. I made them ahead of time, but did not pop them into the oven until people started arriving. Two batches were gone in under 10 minutes. I didn't have to change a thing with this recipe, it was already great. This is now one of my go-to recipes when hosting dinner parties.

This recipe is very good.  I had a large sized-foldover in mind when we began cutting the puff pastry.  They actually turn out to be appetizers, which is just right.  The cheese filling and buttery puff pastry is very rich tasting, so a few small appetizers is sufficent at a time.

Big hit at our party.  Warm out of the oven they were fantastic!  We even finished them off the next day cold.

I got pretty great reviews from this! I made mine with the tomato basil feta. Only suggestion I would make is if you want them in triangles make sure you cut the squares perfectly or it won't work! I had to make some of mine into squares but they still tasted great!

These tasted great!  I used 4 oz of the seasoned basil/tomato feta (not the 8 recommended) and that was plenty and still very cheesy.  Next time I plan to use just a little less than that as well.  But regardless, these are really yummy!  I will definitely make them again!

I used seasoned feta cheese and found they came out super salty. I'm not sure if it's from the seasoning, or just feta cheese in general. I'm not sure I'd mix in the egg if I ever make them again.

I used 6oz's of crumbled goat cheese, 1tbs of dried chives added a good shake of black pepper and garlic powder.  One sheet of pastry rolled out a bit made 12 and used all the filling.  OMG - SOOO good, I'll make these often for parties!  Oh, and I added the spare egg white to the cheese mixture too.

LOVED IT! I made a small batch of it and used crescent roll dough from the fridge (I don't even know what phyllo dough is). It seriously only took like 5 mins to prepare! If you like feta you will love this. I am going to use this one all of the time. Thanks!

Made these tonight for the Pats/Jags Playoff game with a few modifications.

I used the garlic and herb feta as recommended by others, but how could I serve an app without meat in it during a playoff game?  So I also bought some of the precooked "shortcuts", diced it up small, and mixed it in with the egg and feta.

Everyone was amazed at these and they disappeared quick.

Next time I may make them a little smaller, I made 18, 9 per sheet.

They do take a little time to prep, though the second batch of 9 took less time than the first.  Worth the work, but plan ahead.

Excellent and flexible recipe. I used garlic and herb feta, and I added roasted red and green peppers, a little mozarella to cut the strong feta flavor, and a little spinach. I diced the red peppers and mixed all ingredients before putting them on the puff pastry. I made 18 servings instead of 12, because I wanted them smaller.

Everyone loved these. They were so pretty, people thought they were not home made. Someone actually called me the next morning and said that they woke up craving these.

My family loves these!  We are Maltese and have a similar snack called a Pestutsi (SP?) that take days to make.  These are just as good!  I brush with egg white instead of yolk, it seems to come out flakier that way.  I have also varied the size - one puff pastry makes either 9 larger ones (family prefers this), but after a special request from a friend I made them smaller, each puff pastry sheet making 16.  Either way is good, I prefer large.  You won't be sorry you made these!

These were just ok to me.  I added black olives, chedder cheese, and red bell peppers but I think the feta cheese is just too overpowering.  I will make these again but will use mozzarella cheese.

Yummy and addictive. I made basil pesto and spread that and some roasted red peppers on the pastry to give them more flavour. Next time I may add some garlic.

I'm giving this recipes five stars because for feta cheese lovers, this recipe is prime.  My husband loves these.  BUT, feta is a little too strong for me in general, so I could only have a few bites of this.  If you can stand the bold flavor of feta, definitely try this recipe.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner appetizer and they went over really well. I will be trying them with sun dried tomatoes like others have suggested next time. Great recipe!

This was good!  I served this at Thanksgiving and got rave reviews.  Though next time I would add black olives and sun-dried tomatoes.  It was a little plain for my taste.

I made these for a cocktail party and they were a hit.  They were the favorite among everyone.  They were quick and easy to make.  I made them the night before and when our guests arrived I just popped them in the oven and then served.

This is wonderful recipe!
I am a total beginner cook, but this was
so easy! I prepared the pastry in the
morning, and baked just before we left for Thanksgiving dinner at friend's.
Everybody loved this and I was asked for
recipe by so many people.
I was also asked to make this for Halloween party.:-)
Thank you!!!!!!!!!

These foldovers are good, but I made a small modification. As I kept reading that they turned out bland,  I proceeded to substitute the green onion for fresh thyme. They were heavenly! My guest loved it and the hubby even more. My recommendation would be to pierce a little hole on top for letting some of the steam out to prevent spreading or popping up open. Will absolutely make it again!

These are GREAT and when I make them, they go quickly.  I did find I needed 2 eggs to get a better consistency.  With that 1 change, this is a 5 star recipe!

These were OK - would make again but with adjustments, because they were a bit bland.  I used phyllo dough because I could not find the puff pastry sheets.  I was not really sure how to use the phyllo dough, so just did maybe 4 sheets thick and folded over.  I think the phyllo dough would have been better brushed with butter instead of (or maybe in addition to?) the egg yolk.  Next time I will try to get puff pastry sheets.  I also used the Mediterranean feta cheese because that is what I had.  It was good, but surprisingly not that creamy after baking.  Overall I thought these were somewhat dry and bland.  I added sliced almonds to a few of them and the crunch helped the overall result.  I think adding a meat, such as ground sausage, and maybe something creamy (like cream cheese or even ricotta), and/or something with crunch (like pine nuts or other nuts) would improve this recipe.

I also added a little bit of chopped red pepper and chopped Kalamata olives.
Being it was just my husband and I, I used a 5 ounce container of crumbled feta cheese and only one puff pastry sheet.
Instead of making six small puffs I cut the puff pastry into four larger squares.
I split the filling between the four squares. They were nice and full. I actually had to stretch the pastry a bit to seal the triangles.
Being larger the cooking time increased to 30 minutes.
My husband absolutely loved them.

Third was recipe , plus sharp cheese and sun dried tomatoes and four version was recipe, sharp cheddar and olive tamponade.  Very easy to change this up!

Made these today for the football game.  They were so good!  I used Feta Mediterranian Herb and increased the green onion.  A couple dashes of hot sauce.  He assembled them and I quickly brushed them with egg white (not egg yolk as recipe stated.). Excellent little nibble.  I had never worked with pastry sheets before and glad he was there to help out!  Will definitely make again.

Drain the feta well! I too give this 5 stars - along with a note to ensure that your feta is well drained. No one else has commented on this as far as I see, but my experience produced a tasty but somewhat soggy product. A few mins under the broiler

Ours looked nothing like the picture. The reacation people had to eating this was of pure disgust and I would never recommend eating these. The other reviews are false and I feel you eat this may God have mercy on your taste pallet.

I am usually a disaster at following a recipe but these are super easy to make and very yummy! My husband is Greek so having a 'cheese pie' is an every day occurrence for him. He said that these cheese pies are just as good as 'back home'.  Nice thing is you can vary the recipe depending on what you add to the feta mixture - chopped onion, chopped spinach - anything really. My only bit of advice is to not put too much filling mixture on each puff pastry piece...less is better. The filling bubbles and oozes out all over the place if you put too much.

I made a few changes: left out the onions, added 1/4 cup chopped drained sun-dried tomatoes. Also made pinwheels, just spread mixture on each puff pastry sheet and rolled up, cut into 8-1 inch wheels. I placed on a cookie sheet, froze & bagged them to take to a New Tears party out of town. Once at the party,  placed on cookie sheet, brushed with egg wash & baked (I baked at 400 degrees about 22 minutes since they were still partly frozen).  Lots of compliments, yummy.

Good base recipe, but needs even more modifications.  :(  We added the chopped olives, onion, garlic, and sundried tomatoes, but it was still a bit boring.  Might try again, but with a lot more changes.

Easy to make, though!

Absolutely loved this recipe.  Easy, came out perfect, and tastes great.  Freeze for parties then just reheat.  

I put in cheese and Pepperoni pieces in a few of these and hubby loved those too.  I am definitely making these again!

I had this cheesecake for Christmas dessert and it was AMAZING, HUG HIT!!!! I would recommend letting it cook just 5-10 minutes longer, but otherwise perfect. I will definitely use it again!

I didn't love it, but it was ok. I felt the puff pastry was too dry and think maybe a croissant dough may have added more flavor.

This recipe was worth the work- I prepared them the night before and popped them in the oven when guests arrived.  The filling with the puff pastry was spectacular!

We love these.  They are pretty and tasty enough to serve to guests.  They're best straight from the oven but they'll do when rewarmed from the microwave too.  I haven't tried freezing yet.  I follow the directions as written, but wanted to add this information to help cooks prepare.  I use the Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry from the  frozen case at the grocer.  It comes in a box (for all those wives that send their husbands to look for stuff!).  The box holds two 9-inch square pieces of dough that cut nicely into 9 3-inch squares for the recipe.  So, the yield is 18 if you use both pieces of dough.  The recipe calls for 8 ounces of feta.  I wanted to double, and I was little short on the amount of feta (I had about 14 ounces of feta), but it worked out perfectly for 36 pieces of the Pepperidge Farm puff pastry dough (two boxes).  I mixed up the stuffing (feta, egg, onions), made the first batch, and made the second batch almost a week later.  An important note--don't forget to defrost the puff pastry dough in advance!

Overall a great recipe; I used phyllo pastry and used cranberries to replace the onions in the filling and it was absolutely delicious! Definitely will make this again sometime.

This was good.  I tried it twice and each time I made some adjustments due to some of the comments that the feta was overpowering.  I added cooked spinach very well drained and finely chopped, garlic powder and a bit of parmesan in place of some of the feta.
The second time I tried this I used a mixture of feta and goat cheese and omitted the onion and added dried cherries.  Both were very yummy :)

The feta turned out to be very sharp and (I hate to say this) OVERPOWERING. I then tried this recipe with 1/8 cup of both diced olives and apples. It brought out the flavor of the feta and I loved it!

My 6 yr old picky eater ate about five and couldn't stop saying how good these were. I too used the Phyllo dough and thought it was easy to make. Next time I make these Im trying the pastry dough that is calling for to see which one I like best!

Very impressive app. My store was out of puff pastry so I had to use phyllo sheets and I will never use them again!! Too hard to use. I used flavored feta and then added yellow peppers for color. Oh and garlic!!

Easy, delicious recipe! This was one of the appetizers I made for Thanksgiving. I loved Carolina Chick's idea of adding in roasted red pepper, almonds and olives. I was too lazy to measure out the amounts, though. I ended up using one whole red bell pepper that I roasted on the stove (I just set the pepper on one of the gas burners and turned it often to blacken all sides, then put it in a plastic bag to cool off and peeled it). I also chopped one handful each of black olives and almond slices. I added an extra egg to accommodate the additional ingredients but the filling was too runny. Next time I'll just stick with one egg. I had some left over, so to heat those I put several in the microwave for about 20 seconds to heat the filling, then threw them in a nonstick pan for about a minute on each side to crisp up the outside. Lame I know, but it was easy and still tasted great :)

I had been wanting to make these forever, but was having troubles finding the puff pastry sheets at my local grocery stores.  I was finally able to locate some and was definitely NOT disappointed with this recipe.  These were great!

I found it impossible to use the dough!  I made some with the regular dough and some with the open shells.  Either way, it was difficult and not tasty enough to be worth the hassle... probably won't make this often.

Tried this out for Thanksgiving appetizers... I adore the taste of feta but this just didn't do it for me. I lacks something and I am not sure exactly what that might be but unless I tweak this recipe a LOT I will not try it again.

These were delicious! I had never worked with puff pastry before so I was a little nervous but these turned out wonderful (Even though I ended up making them in a rectangle shape.) The leftovers we reheated in our toaster oven. Extremely tasty!

Way to rich. Next time I would make them really really small. I also found they tasted much better when cold.

These were good. I had to add some seasoning to them. Will make these again. I give them 4 1/2 stars really.

This is one of my favorite things to make for a pot luck or party with friends.  I have made them several times and they always come out prefectly.  I have used plain and garlic herb feta and both are fantastic.

These taste really good, they come out a little dry (mine did, at least), but they're very simple if you want something to put out before a meal.

Great recipe, used 2 boxes of puff pastry to make 27 foldovers. We had these as part of the "appetizer" buffet at our family Thanksgiving, great. :)

These were pretty good, but I'm only giving it three stars because I made quite a few changes.  I added oregano and garlic powder to the feta mixture.  I used phyllo pastry and I had to cut the cooking time to twelve minutes.  This recipe has potential, but only if you add to it, and I'm glad I read other reviews before I made these foldovers.

I used regular phyhllo shells and flavored phyllo shells along with flavored feta with mozzarella cheese and spinach. These were a huge hit!!! I have been requested to make them for all of our get togethers. These were super easy to make and by using the shells you can make more than enough for everyone!!

I brought these to a family holiday and they didn't go over as well as I'd hoped... I didn't do a great job with the puff pastry, so I take partial credit for that.  I used tomato basil feta, which made for very good flavor, but the finished texture wasn't great.  They didn't get melty and gooey like I think people - and I - expected when they heard "cheese" foldovers.  I want to give this another shot, and maybe mix the feta with another cheese.

Not as tangy as I had hoped. Tastes more like a quiche than feta. Very good brunch type item though.

I wanted to make this more of a main dish for Thanksgiving (for vegetarians). I added diced and sauteed roasted red pepper, squash, and zucchini, sauteed in olive oil and white wine. Used tomato basil feta. These were wonderful! Made the night before and popped in the oven before serving. UPDATE: have made these many times since, and instead of tiny foldovers, I make a big log out of the pastry, and add some decorations on top.

The triangles suggested in the recipe are a little too big.  I made this a second time with bite-sized triangles, and it was well-recieved, although more time consuming.

I tried these at Thanksgiving and they were a hit! Because I bought the wrong kind of pastry dough, I stuck them into little muffin tins and that worked well. If you love feta cheese, you'll love these!

I altered this recipe only by making my own puff pastry.  My husband liked this recipe more than I did.  I found it a bit bland.  I don't think I'll make it again.
