This is so good! It makes enough filling for two pies.

well...the pie wasn't pink but that's bc I used lemon jello not strawberry. I used lemon bc I had half a package of lemon jello and I only wanted one pie. It didn't completely set for me either but i didn't let the jello mix melt. Bf loved it and ate 4 pieces of it last night. So even though it didn't set (and it's probably bc I didn't make sure the jello mix was cool) this is a simple recipe that could have a great presentation if I'd just follow the directions. I'll probably make again and try to be less impatient in making it. Thanks for the recipe!

My Grandma used to make me pink pie when I was a kid. It has been my favorite ever since. I add fresh fruit or fruit cocktail to mine. Thanks for the recipe!

As a child it wasn't Christmas unless my great grandmother made her pink pie. I have to imagine it came out after gelatin did. The difference between her recipe and these is this. She would cook 3 whole eggs with the sugar and can of crushed pineapple. Of course on low and stirring constantly then add jello. After mixture had cooled fold into whipped evaporated milk. It was the very taste of Christmas in your mouth!!

Not sure what went wrong. My milk never truely whipped. It seemed too soft. Once I added the gelatin mixture it just all becam runny and wouldn't fold together. I did stir it up to combine and refrigerated it. It became and EXTRA SOFT pie not fully set yet not runny. The taste was fine...nothing to write home about though. I think I'll delete this one from my recipe box.

Great last minute recipe. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS COLD ECSPECIALLY THE MILK! THE STRAWBERRY MIX MUST ALSO COOL DOWN! A lot of people commented that it didn't set fold together good or milk didn't fluff and it is probably because the mix was too hot or the milk wasn't cold enough. Tasted great and my two year old loved helping and tasting.

This pie wasn't bad for a last minute dessert. I actually halfed it and used 1/2 strawberry jello and 1/2 peach jello since there was enough for 2 pies (That way I had 1 peach & 1 strawberry pie). I also made sure the jello mixture was at room temp. before folding in the fluffed evaporated milk. They both turned out great!!

My evaporated milk never whipped up so my filling didn't set in the refrigerator. I put it in the freezer instead and the filling reminds me of sherbet. Would be good with a citrus jello too. It was a little sweet so I would decrease the sugar to about 3/4 of a cup and will definitely make this again. The kids loved it.

This recipe didn't work for me. When I combined the gelatin and milk it "de-fluffed" the milk and it never set up!

I have made this several times but I was taught to use cherry jello. This gives a sweeter tart taste not found with strawberry. Also the evaporated milk must be verrrrry cold and the bowl and beaters must be chilled as well. Use 3/4 cup sugar 2 TBL of lemon juice and 1 cup of water bring to a boil and stir in cherry jello. Chill jello mixture until thickened and then fold into whipped milk. This can be tricky so you want to have your crust and thickened jello ready when you whip the evop milk because it only takes a couple of minutes to whip it. Good luck!!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I put the can milk in the freezer for 30 minutes while mixing jello etc.  My mom made this when I was a child (65 years ago).  She always put the milk in the freezer so it would whip up.  We used it for this pie and for whipped topping on gingerbread.  My daughter requested this pie a few days ago.  It turned out great.  It does make 2 good size pies.  I use vanilla wafer for crust.  Jenny

This is a very old fashioned recipe. If you don't chill the milk really cold this won't set up. My mother use to pour the milk in a old metal ice cube tray and stick it in the freezer until ice crystals formed around the side If you can't watch it then just chill the milk at least overnight in the coldest part of your ref. Mix and cool the jello part and then take the milk out of the ref. and beat and then mix it with jello mixture. I believe you will not have any trouble with the pie setting up.
