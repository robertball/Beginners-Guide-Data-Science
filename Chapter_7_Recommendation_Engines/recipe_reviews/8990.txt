Awesome good! Great departure from traditional pizza toppings and sauce. I used half of a 3 c. flour recipe for bread machine pizza dough rather than the the prepared, refrigerated crust. For added flavor, I seasoned the chicken with salt,pepper,and a little garlic powder and sauteed them in olive oil.  I lightly brushed the crust with olive oil before topping with the other ingredients, added sliced, fresh mushrooms, and drizzled about 1 T. of olive oil over the top before baking. This was a fun twist on the traditional pie. I enjoyed making it and enjoyed eating it even more!

This is absolutely delicious.  I used a Boboli Thin Crust & seasoned it before I layered the ingredients.  I also seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning, garlic powder & salt/pepper before I cooked it.  My husband loved it, too!

This recipe was excellent.  I added a little bit of crumbled bacon to give it some extra flavor.  Yummy!

I made this for my husband and I to have a quick dinner before girlfriends came over. I used a can of seasoned diced tomatoes (Basil, Oregano, Garlic) versus fresh because I did not have fresh on hand. I think the seasoned canned tomatoes added a little extra flavor.

I was excited to try this recipe as we all use Ranch dressing as a "dip" for our regular pizza.  It was so good and a very nice change to regular pizza!  I think the key here is: 1)Use a good thick ranch dressing, and rather than measuring it, I just spread it on like I would pizza sauce; 2) A thick pizza crust is key, couldn't see this on a thin crust at all; 3) Make sure your chicken is seasoned how you like it or it will be bland.  Another tip is use lots of chicken, mine seemed to disappear when the cheese melted, so I'm going to use more next time.  I used the canned tomatoes that were tiny chopped and seasoned and it worked great.  I added chopped bacon pieces to half and it was good also.  I think I'll try salsa next time.  I've also made this with the chicken sauteed in BBQ sauce first, which was a nice change but not as good as the original.

This was fabulous.  I diced the tomatoes and took 5 minutes off the cooking time so the crust wouldn't brown too much, but other than that, followed the recipe completely.  I thought the ranch would taste funny but it was perfect.  My husband thought it was alfredo sauce.  Wonderful pizza!

OUTSTANDING!  I used a thin crust Boboli, and added chopped marinated artichoke hearts and crumbled bacon to the other toppings.  Baked for 20 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  This is the best chicken pizza I have made thus far, or so I was told.  (Although, the Buffalo Chicken Pizza rates a close second.)  Try this - - you will not be disappointed.

Really, really, really, liked this pizza.  What a great alternative to your typical tomato based ones..(although I love them too!!)  Next time I may sub peppercorn ranch for the regular and I usually sautee some bell peppers, onions and mushrooms to throw on top.  Thanks for the great idea Lessalee.

My husband and I absolutely LOVE this pizza! I've make it quite a few times now and have made just a few adjustments.  A couple of nights before making the pizza, I make baked chicken breasts that have been marinating all day in Grill Mates Chipotle Pepper marinade (yummy!) and make at least one extra breast to chop up and save for this pizza.  When I make this pizza, I buy the Boboli regular pizza crust and add use whatever veggies I have on hand.  It's also great with a fresh salad on the side.  This meal comes together very quickly and is delicious!

This was so delicious.  I think I'll try adding whole garlic cloves and broccoli florets to it next time I make it, though it was awesome as-is.

This was excellent! I made several changes, like I usually do, to suit my family's tastes. I used a combo of boneless, skinless thighs & breasts, which I marinated for 5 hours with a vidalia onion vinaigrette, minced garlic and seasoned salt & pepper. I grilled the chicken then cooled and chopped into bite size pieces.  I used Pillsbury's Thin Crust refrigerated pizza crust. Before pre-baking for 8 minutes at 400 degrees (425 is too high), I sprayed the crust with olive oil Pam and sprinkled garlic powder over it. I used a can of seasoned diced tomatoes, drained, a can of portabella sliced mushrooms, drained, the green onions, a small can of sliced black olives, drained, and a 1/2 pkg. of Hormel real bacon bits. I used a thick ranch jar dressing (Litehouse, Jimmy's or Marie's works well), but didn't measure, just spread a layer on the pre-baked crust. I did layer the cheeses and other ingredients, in addition to my own, as the recipe states, then baked for an additional 17 minutes at 400 degrees instead of 425. I let it stand for 7 minutes to set the toppings and prevent them from sliding off while slicing the pizza.  Everyone LOVED this pizza and it I will be making it a regular rotation in my menu planning.

Oh yum.  Season chicken while cooking it up, I used salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I did not have enough fresh tomatoes on hand to make a cup, so I also used canned diced---just make sure to drain them well.  Added bacon bits and some sliced black olives.  Easy and a nice dinner with a good salad and some vino :)

I used some homemade pre-baked pizza crusts (Grill Dough recipe) and just used a rotisserie chicken, diced, fresh salsa as the diced tomatoes and onions, and ranch dip (all I had but worked great) as the sauce,,,really tasty! I had a couple of pieces of turkey bacon I diced for the top too!

Weird!! The ranch dressing as the sauce didn't do it for us. We did grill the chicken first which gave it an awesome flavor. We also determined we don't like Phillsbury crust. I suggest making your own.

I adjusted things a bit, but I'm giving this the full five stars because it was ultimately absolutely fantastic!  I only used about 1/4 c. Ranch, possibly less, and that was plenty.  I also omitted the green onions, using instead 1/2 a regular onion and sauteeing it with the chicken in salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Worcestershire Sauce.  I put the whole bit on a homemade pizza crust, and ate far more than I should have.  I'll make this again!

My boyfriend proclaimed this pizza to be "the best pizza ever". Not only is it good, it also is very easy to make. The only advice I have is when using fresh tomatoes on pizza, make sure you squeeze out the excess juice so that when it cooks it will not make the pizza overflowing with juices on the top. I'm sure bacon would be excellent with this, but written as it, it is delish!

I already make this however we barbeque ours. You can buy special pans (i bought mine at Walmart) with little round holes in the bottom for this purpose. You could probably make your own with cheap tin pans from the dollar store by making some holes in the bottom. We try all kinds of variations. A couple of hits are mixing some Rene's Ceasar dressing or Spicy Thialand (M&M's) with tomatoe sauce on the crust. This makes a Chicken Ceasar Pizza or a Spicy Chicken Thai Pizza. Be careful if you do make it on the BBQ as it takes less than 13 minutes. Try to keep your heat to under 400 as well. We use any crust and have used the refridgerator dough as suggested here with great results. Even on the BBQ. This  the best tasteing pizza ever (double delish on the BBQ) and is always a hit at my house.

I REALLY LIKE THIS PIZZA. MY HUSBAND DOES NOT LIKE TOMAOTES SO I OMITTED THEM. TO SAVE TIME I USED BOBILI PIZZA CRUST AND TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE FLAVOR I DRIZZLED A LITTLE BIT OF BBQ SAUCE ON IT. QUICK AND TASTY MEAL. A DEFINITE KEEPER.

We typically have pizza once a week, and this was a nice change from our usual pepperoni pizza with red sauce.  My husband and I loved this pizza, and my kids enjoyed everything except the big "chunks" of tomatoes.  They picked some of them off, but really liked the rest of the pizza.  This will become one of the "weekly" pizzas in this house.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I was looking for a pizza similar to the bbq chicken pizza, but without the spiceness. I used low fat cheeses and ranch dressing and it did not seem to be a problem. To cook the chicken more easily I just boiled one large chicken breast in some water with a packet of no-sodium chicken broth powder and then shredded it. It seems like it would taste better with some red onion and I would have preferred a homemade crust. My only other complaint is it was quite salty. However, it made for a quick and filling meal tonight.

Ok so I was a little bit hesitant about this recipe because I'm not a huge ranch fan...hubby is though-he loves to dip his pizza in ranch, so when I saw this recipe I thought he'd love it. Well, let me tell you we BOTH devoured this!! It was so yummy! I didn't really measure out the ranch, I just used enough to cover the pizza crust--and it almost seemed like an alfredo sauce...it was delicious!  The recipe as is I would give 4 stars. I made a couple changes based on others' reviews that made it 5 stars! First, I used a boboli crustinstead of refridgerated and chives instead of green onions because that's what I happened to have on hand. Second, I seasoned my chicken with fresh garlic and italian seasoning. I used fresh, diced tomatoes (again, what I had on hand). And I added some crumbled bacon on top...can't wait to have this again! The recipe as-is is wonderful, but season your chicken and add some bacon and my-oh-my is it good!

This is a great way to use left-overs! I usally sprinkle on some crumbled bacon before adding the final cheese layer.

My husband and I love this pizza!  It is very quick and easy to make.  I save more time if I use the recipe-ready pre-cooked and cut chicken from Perdue or Tyson, rather than cooking and cutting up the chicken myself.  

Also, we found that 1/2 cup of ranch dressing is a little too much so I suggest decreasing it to maybe 1/4.  I also added minced garlic and fresh basil leaves.  

It doesn't make 8 servings.  My husband and I split an entire pizza in one sitting.

This is a favorite of ours. . .works great on a Boboli - very easy to make.  Don't go TOO heavy on the ranch, nor use tomoto slices (use chunks instead) or everything slides off.  My least favorite part is preparing the shredded chicken, but I do so with garlic and soy sauce.  A great pizza - have passed the recipie many times.

This was really good!  I made it using "Jay's signature pizza crust" off of this website.  I cooked the chicken with some salt, pepper and olive oil.  You need to add seasoning because the flavor of the chicken really influences the whole pizza.  I didn't measure the ranch, just spread it on like pizza sauce.  I couldn't taste it as much as I thought I would...don't be afraid to have a solid layer on there!  I loved the tomatoes on it.  This was a good, easy pizza.  Thanks!

this pizza is amazing! i made my own crust and rolled it fairly thin. i also used diced italian style tomatoes as suggested by another reviewer. finally, i used fat free hidden valley ranch dressing to cut on calories and you couldn't tell a difference. its was delish! my boyfriend and i polished off the whole pizza!

This recipe was very delicious. My husband wasn't sure about chicken on his pizza, but I think he's a believer now. The green onions gave it such a wonderful taste. Make sure to keep an eye on the crust... the directions call for it to be in the oven a little too long, if I left it in the entire recommended time, it would have been burnt. Also, add bacon... it was really tasty!

This is a great recipe!  I am always short on time so to make it even easier, I use one of the "ready to take home" rotisserie chickens from the grocery store ~ it is already seasoned and you can easily cut it into bite size chunks or shred the chicken with a fork.  I have also made mine with BBQ sauce and added sliced red onions for a yummy twist!

My husband, daughter and I really enjoyed this pizza.  We make pizzas at home all of the time (my husband is from Italy). We were a little skeptical about the ranch dressing - but it ended up being really good.  I made "garlic lovers pizza crust from a bread machine", also from this site, and it turned out perfect. We had tacos the night before, so we had the tomatoes, cheese, and green onions left over from our taco bar - so this was a great way to use up those leftovers.  We added black olives as well (as those were also left over).  This was a good way to have two very different meals in the same week using almost the same ingredients.

Yum!  We really liked this pizza!  I really do not like canned pizza dough so I used the Basic Pizza Crust recipe from this site and baked it for 18 minutes at 425 degrees.  I chose to put all the cheese on top.  We ate this with garlic salt (made the pizza about 10 times better!) but next time I'll sprinkle on the dough.  Might even be good with Hot Wing sauce, we'll have to remember to try that next time.

I thought that this was a pretty good recipe.  I altered it a little though.  I cut the chicken into little pieces before cooking it, as well as adding italian spices to the chicken.  Then I sauteed up part of a sweet onion, mushrooms, and garlic (all in some butter) and added it to the chicken.  I also used a little less ranch then what was called for.  I noticed that the temp. that you gave is pretty high, so I put the pizza (for the first time) in for 4-5 mins, then I add the other ingredients and put it in for 10-15 mins.  That seemed to be just enough time.

Very good but would tweak some for more flavor.  Cook chicken with some type of seasoning.  I used a rub I normal use when grilling chicken. I will also add some bacon next time.  None the less I enjoyed the dish and will fix this again.  One of caution keep an eye on it.  It doesn't take 25 mins.  Ionly cooked mine for 15 and the crust was very done.

I doubled this and made two pizzas.  First off, I made my own crust with Basil and Oregano in it since I didn't have a store-bought one.  I used the Ranch dressing on one of them and I liked it.  My husband wanted me to use red sauce on the other one because he wasn't sure about the Ranch, but all we had in a pinch was store-bought spaghetti sauce.  It was OK, but just tasted like store-bought spaghetti sauce to me.  Next time I may try to use a little better red sauce and I'm sure it will be delicious as well.  I also doubled the mozzarella and omitted the cheddar.  I put a few mushrooms on top also (canned, since that's what I had on hand) and it turned out delicious!  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Mmmmm, this was pretty darn good! I used Tiseo's Frozen Pizza Dough (I really cannot recommend it enough! It defrosts super fast, is so easy to roll and stretch out, and it cooks up BEAUTIFULLY. It's the closest thing to a decent Donato's-style cracker crust I have ever encountered), spread a generous layer of T. Marzetti's Garlic Dill Ranch dressing over it, sprinkled it with garlic powder, then loaded the base with mozzarella, parmesan and extra-sharp Cheddar. I used a 10oz can of chicken breast meat, thinly-sliced onions, and thinly-sliced cherry tomatoes. This made for a very hearty, filling and tasty meal. Many thanks, Lessalee!

Awesome! You can customize this so many ways and have a delicious treat. I used a Pillsbury can pizza dough and leftover grilled chicken breast that I sliced up. This couldn't have been easier. This was a quick snack in between Sunday brunch and dinner that kept the teenagers happy. I look forward to future experimentations. One note, the second time in the oven my crust started to get overdone at the 10 minute mark, 20 - 25 minutes might be too long depending on your oven. Enjoy!

This recipe needs lots of garlic, powder and freshley chopped, and was even better with artichoke hearts, red onion and fresh tomato put on after cooking.  Add some flavor, and it is a wonderful recipe.

This was the first chicken pizza recipe I've made. It was not what I expected. It really lacked flavor.My suggestion would be to add more ranch or use tomato sauce instead.

I was skeptical about this one, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I'm glad I did. I used fat-free Ranch, and  I could definitely taste the "tang" that fat-free dressings have. Next time, I will use the real thing. Also, I pre-baked the crust as the recipe says, and by the end of the cooking time, my crust was too brown. I will not pre-bake the crust next time. Overall, good flavor and nice change from regular pizza.

My husband went nuts over this pizza!  I "sauteed" the shredded chicken in butter with basil and garlic salt and it gave it a nice flavor.  I also would recommend spreading the ranch generously.  I also added mushrooms which fit the ensemble perfectly!

I realized, too late, I was out of pizza sauce. Rather than making red sauce, I thought I'd try using ranch as the sauce instead. I used this recipe as a jumping off point. I added black olives and slices of some mini peppers from our garden. I used leftover chicken from another recipe, and sliced it thin. Instead of the green onions, I sautéed some yellow onion and pressed garlic and used that. I used thinly sliced tomatoes instead of diced. It could have used a little more time than the 10 I gave it (based on the instructions on the dry crust mix packets I used), but it was good. My hubby added hot sauce. I added parmesan. Tasty!

This was really good! I made a wheat crust from scratch and used homemade ranch. I sauteed yellow onions and used those in lieu of the green onions and it turned out great. A few shakes of crushed red pepper also made the flavors delicious. I did find that baking this for 20 minutes with toppings was too long.

I make this pizza all the time. I add minced bacon, cut up (little squares)delli ham, provolone cheese instead of Cheader and lots of garlic added to 1 cup of ranch dressing. I use fresh pizza dough from Fresh and Easy. My 90 year old father says it is the best pizza he ever had. My kids can't get enough. It is a hit at parties.

I loved this idea and tried my own twist. I left off the vegetables and coated the chicken in buffalo sauce. Turned out great! This will be going into my recipe book for repeats.

This  was ok.  Not my favorite, but not bad.  Although I really like Ranch, it was runny on this pizza, especially with the juice from the tomatoes (which were delicious, just juicy!)  I tried to season the chicken with a little bit of my homemade dry Ranch mix, but the flavor really didn't come through, so it ended up just a tad on the bland side for us.  The only other change I made was to add some chopped fresh basil, which was nice.  All in all, a good idea, but I will definitely play around with the flavors and seasonings next time to ramp up the taste a bit.  I'm not a big bacon fan, but I think a chicken bacon Ranch pizza would be better.

This pizza is yummy!  Make sure you add 3-4 cloves (minced) to the ranch dressing before you put it on the dough.  It makes such a huge difference.  And bacon crumbles are also such a great addition to this pizza, just add however much you like on top.  I season the chicken with garlic salt and pepper and either grill it or saute it with a little olive oil.  Makes the chicken it so flavorful and a more yummy pizza! This is definitely one of my family favorites.

Wonderful.  Quick and easy to make.  The only thing I added was some fresh garlic and Sour Cream to the Ranch Sauce and corn as a veggie topping.  I can't wait to make this again.

Was a hit with everyone! Bought traders joes whole wheat pizza dough and rolled it out. Mixed in pressed garlic with the ranch before spreading it over the crust, left off green onions bc of picky eaters, and added hot sauce all over just before putting it in the oven. Delicious!

Made this today and it was delicious and easy! Used wheat pizza dough from the supermarket that I rolled out and used a can of diced tomatoes with herbs. Pre-baked the crust a bit on a pizza stone before cooking with the toppings. YUM. Will definitely be a keeper.

This was super good! The Ranch was the perfect ingredient to make it just a little bit different from regular ole' pizza. Easy to make too which is great when you have four little ones running around! Pair it with a salad and you've got a great, easy, fast dinner. I even used the Tyson frozen grilled chicken breast pieces (heated according to the package before placing on the pizza). I didn't cook it as long as the recipe called for. I bought the Pillsbury refrigerated thin crust pizza dough so that may be why it cooked quicker. I also cooked it at the temp the pizza dough can called for.

I've made this several times.  The biggest change I make is to use a homemade ranch dressing (recipe from this website).  I always season my chicken with lemon pepper before cooking.  I have used salsa instead of tomatoes sometimes.  I have also tossed the cooked chicken in Frank's hot sauce before topping the pizza.  This is a very forgiving recipe that can be changed or added to without any problems.  GREAT RECIPE!

Is probably good as is, but with a few changes, I thought it was even better - I added garlic and other spices to the chicken as well as over the ranch dressing, also added artichoke, bell peppers and jalapeno, and used red onion instead of the green

This was really good; I made this and another pizza recipe from this site for my son's birthday dinner; this was the favorite by far.  I made my own pizza crust rather then use the store bought one.  I sat the chopped tomatoes on a paper towel to absorb some of the juice so that the pizza wouldn't be soggy.  I also didn't measure out the ranch dressing just spread a thin layer on the crust I think 1/2 cup is a little too much.  Finally I  sliced the chicken breast and seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic and sauteed it before adding to the pizza otherwise he chicken would have been bland.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I look forward to making it again and playing with different variations.

Excellent recipe. Great variation on classic pizza. I used red peppers instead of tomatoes for personal preference and added some crumbled bacon and garlic. I cooked my chicken in Frank's Red Hot sauce also. It was so good even the boyfriend who detests veggies, enjoyed it. A keeper!

I quite liked this recipie and it was a good change from the traditional tomato-based pie. The rest of the family, however, wasn't so hip on eating it (some wouldn't even try it). I will make it again if making just for myself, but the family would rather take a pass on this one.

Really good. Sort of similiar to a famous pizza chain (CPK). I coated my chicken in Frank's hot sauce for more of a Buffalo chicken wing flavor and left out the tomatoes (don't like them).

A really good pizza! I prebaked my pizza crust ahead of time. So it was cooled when I added the ingredients. I think this helps when you use an oily topping, like dressings or mayo. I then layered the chicken and veggies, cheese, veggies, cheese again. This way the flavors mix really well throughout.

My husband said that the only thing that could make this pizza better would be if the crust hadn't been so well done! That was my fault, of course, for leaving it in the oven too long. But even so, we loved this pizza. It was a wonderful change of pace from your traditional pizza with red sauce. I read most of the reviews and did make a few changes accordingly. 1) Some people said that the ranch made it greasy, so I used way less dressing than called for and then served it with more to dip in, which worked out perfectly. 2) Many people commented that the recipe as is was a bit bland, so when I cooked the chicken (which I cut into small pieces beforehand), I added one very large clove of garlic (minced), salt, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Then when I assembled the pizza, I sprinkled pizza seasoning (came with my spice rack--probably has basil, oregano, thyme, etc) on top of the chicken, tomatoes, and onions. 3) I used a colby-jack blend instead of the cheddar and mozarella. 4) I sprinkled the baking sheet with cornmeal, and decreased the temp to 400. I baked the crust alone for 6 1/2 minutes, then the pizza for about 15, which was obviously a little long. With these changes, the pizza turned out incredible and I will definitely make it again...and hopefully not burn it!

YUMMY! I'm always on the lookout for different takes on classics, and this is fantastic! Like alot of other reveiwers suggested I added bacon ( i think this really finished the recipe) and also becuase i didn't have any cheddar in the house i used colby-jack instead ( tasted great. Try this recipe, you won't be dissapointed!

This is a great diversion from the standard pizza.  I used Jay's pizza crust and made it into 2 thin crust pizzas.  Rather than measuring out Ranch, just use enough to cover the crust.  I have never had any problems with my toppings sliding off.  Mesquite grilled chicken adds a nice flavor to the pizza as well as a little cilantro ... definitely not blah!
** Just made this on the grill using the Grill Dough recipe from this site.  A little smoky grill flavor tastes excellent with this pizza!

This turned out GREAT!  I followed suggestions of some other reviewers: Large Boboli pizza crust, 1/3 cup ranch dressing. Sauted chicken with mushrooms and green onions, salt, pepper, garlic powder. Cooked for 10 minutes only. It was SCRUMPTIOUS!

My family loves this recipe. We add crumbled bacon and use red onion instead of green. We also sprinkle chipotle seasoning on the chicken before cooking it.  Yummm! We eat this at least twice a month!! Thanks for the great recipe!

Some suggestions:
I used Jay's Signature pizza dough recipe from this site and added about a 1/3 package of dry ranch seasoning mix to the dough. I think it made it alot more tasty. I also cooked my chicken in a pan with onions and garlic. I liked the combination and thought it added a lot of pizzaz to the pizza.

This was a crowd pleaser.  Everyone here really liked it.  I made a few changes, but not many -- I added a couple of tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs; rosemary, oregano and cilantro.  Those were sprinkled on top of the ranch dressing.  I marinated my chicken for about an hour in Seven Seas Italian Dressing mixed 2 to 1 with lemon juice.  I used some of the spices along with dried basil and garlic while cooking the chicken.  I used prebaked, super thin pizza crusts and cut way down on the baking time.  I sprinkled my diced tomatoes with dried basil, oregano and garlic powder and let them sit that way for a while before use, just to give them a little extra flavor.
Excellent, excellent, excellent.  I may never make plain pizza again!!!!!

This is undoubtedly the best pizza i have ever had, i have made this recipe about 6 times in the past few months and everyone raves about it, i add bacon bits to the pizza and found that a little garlic powder and a red onion are wonderful. DELICIOUS!!! oh and i sometimes sub out the ranch for store bought cheesy alfredo sauce (ragu).

My husband couldn't get enough of this pizza! I discovered too late that I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes flavored with basil, garlic, and oregano. I seasoned the chicken with a little poultry seasoning to give it some flavor. Also, I used the fat-free version of both cheeses.It was still DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper!

This recipe becomes perfect if you mix half ranch dressing with half salsa (1/2 cup each), use southwestern already-cooked chicken, chopped roma tomatoes, and slices of purple onion.  Top with Monterey Jack/Cheddar combo and some mozzarella too and you reach perfection!  I made my own crust, but a ready-made one would work, too.

Despite my doubts, this turned out really great. I used three cheese ranch, which was an added cheese kick. There were no green onions around so I used green pepper, which was delicious. Much better than the oven version.

I used all the suggestions from the reviews and found this recipe as bland as can be. The only thing that could spice this recipe up a bit is add pizza sauce. I give it one star for its taste and another for its looks. (it does look very good, but that wont save that it is bland.)

This pizza is great! It's easy to make and the directions were easy to follow! The tastes all blend together for a delicious taste. I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I may have added a little more of was cheese, since my kids are big fans of cheese pizza. My kids loved it and asked for more (unusual, for sure!) and my husband liked it, too. I was able to rescue a couple of slices for my lunch the next day and it even reheats well. This one is a keeper!

I love this recipe, but since I'm lactose intolerant, I make it with bbq sauce and lactose-free cheese. Great stuff, though I have had to adjust the baking time for the crust, as I had troubles with it burning.

My husband and I love this pizza - probably me more than him. I don't really measure out my ingredients, because this recipe is so much about personal taste, and it's very forgiving! I took another cook's suggestion and seasoned my cooking chicken with montreal steak seasoning (what an awesome flavor!) and then, when the chicken was done, I added barbeque sauce into the pan which was still at a pretty high heat. I let the chicken simmer in that for about a minute, just enough to reduce the bbq sauce, then put the chicken pieces on top of the ranch and cheese layer. We left off the tomatoes and onions and instead just added the last layer of cheece. Before I put it in the oven I sprinkled the top of the pizza with more bbq sauce. I also noticed people having trouble with the crust - I followed the directions on the can of Pilsbury pizza crust I used, baking the crust alone for 8 minutes, adding toppings, and then baking it for 10 more minutes. It turned out perfectly! DELICIOUS!

Oh MAN! This is so good and SO easy. It seems like a fairly short and obvious list of ingredients, but somehow everything blends together and becomes much, much better than the sum of its parts. My husband said he would have never guessed that the "sauce" was just plain old ranch dressing. This pizza would also be really good cut into small pieces and served as an appetizer.

I made this last night for a few friends and it was sooooooo good.  I had some left over chicken breast that I satueed in olive oil along with some onion and green bell pepper.  As per other reviewers I didn't use the full 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing, I used about 1/4 cup.  After I put the chicken mixture on the pizza crust, I sprinkled some bacon bits over it and then covered with the cheese.  I didn't put the chopped tomatoes on until after the pizza was baked.  I will diffently be making this again.  Next time I'm going to put some green chilis or jalapeno peppers on it.

I am pretty much a purist when it comes to pizza - tomato sauce base and traditional toppings. But, I decided I needed to spice things up and try something different. I am so glad that I did! This recipe is very tasty and pleased all members of my family. We will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This pizza was AWESOME!  The only thing I added was garlic salt, (and extra cheese, OFcourse)!  My boyfriend suggested adding spinach next time, which I think will be a great addition!  Can't wait to make it again!

This was awesome.  I used a pizza dough recipe that came with my bread machine and used my machine.  I haven't had any one not like this pizza.  We tried it once with Caesar dressing and to us it was just not the same.  Thanks again for the great recipe.

This was a great fast lunch!!  I added some cajun spices, carlic powder, and a bit of cayenne pepper to the crust before I prebaked it.  The I used left over cajun chicken, mushrooms, red onions, and greeon onions.  This was a wonderful resipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This pizza was pretty good.  I prefer using barbecue sauce rather than the ranch dressing.

I made this with my own homemade pizza crust, and sauteed the chicken in olive oil with garlic, onions, salt and pepper. Very refreshing change from the norm.

This was absolutely FABULOUS!! I have never eaten a chicken pizza, of any kind, before and this was a wonderful first experience. My five year old daughter absolutely loved it and so did my grandmother who NEVER eats a whole piece of pizza! I loved the combination of flavors. I usually change recipes a little to suite my particular tastes, but I only used a blend of mozzarella and provelone instead of the cheddar. I may never go back to the tomato-ey, greasy, sausage ridden pizzas!

I love this recipe.  I used Jay's signature pizza crust instead of frozen crust which worked great.  I decreased the ranch dressing to about a 1/4 cup and also added steamed broccoli, sauteed onions and mushrooms.  Great tasting and very easy.

Good/tasty. I wasn't crazy about it, but my family was. Added mushrooms, parsley, & a lot of spices to the chicken/pizza (garlic and onion powders, season salt). Be careful with the crust: mine burned.

Oh my god, this is delicious!! I boiled chicken breast with fresh garlic cloves. When it had cooled down, I shredded it and tossed it in just a splash of soy sauce. It added a nice flavor to an already DELICIOUS recipe!

We have used this recipe many times with a few modifications. We use a jalapeno ranch base, chicken, tomato, mushroom, bacon sometimes and always a tex-mex cheese (cheddar,mozzeralla,pepper jack) It is good with a store bought prepared crust or home made. This is a keeper.

Very tasty and easy, versatile as well!  To "Kick it up a notch", I add BBQ sauce to the cooked chicken, and mixed it up BEFORE I put it on the pizza...really adds heat and flavor!  I also add some thinly sliced red onion, for extra flavor..When pre-baking the crust, be sure that the edges don't get over-done - I reduced the heat during this phase, the second time I made it - and also brushed the dough with garlic olive oil, for extra flavor...

Exceptionally good pizza!!  I have made it twice and my family already wants it again.  The second time I added a few more green onions and used Bacon-Ranch dressing (I also use Roma tomatoes).  YUM!!!  This recipe is excellent!!

This was a really great recipe. Even my most picky eater liked it and suggested we make it again. My store was out of the refrigerated pizza dough, so I used a boboli crust. No need to pre-bake. And I baked the entire pizza at 450 following the boboli instructions. Instead of chopped tomatoes I used 2 sliced Roma's. Incredibly good pizza.

Wow.  First homemade pizza.  Super easy and my husband raved about it. He says it tasted like gourmet pizza from our favorite local pizza restaurant.  I used the veggies I had on hand - green peppers, tomatoes, and regular onions. Definite keeper.

Had this for the first time the other day.  We LOVED it.  I used leftover grilled chicken. Took others suggestions and added black olives and onions and used a can of diced Italian seasoned tomatoes. The Ranch dressing adds an amazing flavor. I would say finding the Pillsbury pizza dough was worth the effort, much better than the crusts already made.  This is a keeper!

Absolutely loved it! I used a regular onion just because it was what I had on hand but it was still delicious! I would recommend seasoning the chicken with a little garlic salt and pepper while its cooking and also scraping the seeds out of the tomatos and blotting them dry. But we loved this pizza, will definitly make this again soon!!

excellent. I used a cheddar jack cheese, as that what was I had on hand. I make one very similar with bacon and mushrooms, but not tomatoes, and called it Alice Springs Pizza. I think I will have to now try it with the chopped tomatoes.

This is really good. It smells great too! 
Nice to use leftover chicken. Quick, quick, quick meal.
Premade pizza crust, Olive oil, garlic rubbed into crust, then followed with toppings. Ranch, Chicken, diced Yellow Pepper, Red Onion. sliced Tomatoes, Mozzarella & Parmesan. Kitchen smells so good. Don't get that bonus with take-out! 
Only comment on the question 'is there a way to improve this?' was 'Mom it needs maybe just a bit more garlic'

On a side note - We used a pre-made "gourmet" crust from our local market.

Surprisingly delicious!  I thought the ranch dressing might be too rich, but it actually makes an excellent pizza sauce.  I used leftover bbq chicken from my freezer, jack cheese (I chose not to use cheddar), and added fresh spinach.  (I plan to add fresh garlic to the ranch dressing next time.)  A little green salad on the side and an ice cold beer, and you've got an instant Friday night pizza party.

My husband and I both really did not like this pizza... felt sick after we ate it!  Too much ranch.  Will not be making again.

Love it! This is my first pizza attempt and this recipe is simply fail proof. I added some herbs and black pepper while cooking the chicken and the pizza turned out really fragrant. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was really good! I also added bacon crumbled between the 2 layers of cheese and used shredded chicken. It was a little dry so when I made it again I added more ranch dressing & it turned out great!

WOW!  That was great pizza!! I've made this twice now.  First time I made it with a homemade crust and half fresh tomatoes half canned and it was divine!!  Next time I used a refrigerated pizza crust and all canned tomatoes.  It was good, but not AS good, of course. 
 Watch out when you're using canned crust.  I didn't check it until 25 min and it was WAY overcooked.  (And my oven usually takes longer to cook things)

This was my first time making homemade pizza and it was a flop. Mostly because the crust burned. After I put the crust in the oven to bake (the second time) I suspected I would have a problem when I compared the cooking time of the pizza crust on the package (13 - 17 min.) and that required in the recipe (27 - 32 min. total). I had to take it out of the oven as soon as the cheese melted rather than when it was "melted and bubbly". Should I have baked it on the top rack (gas oven)? Overall the flavor was OK and I might make it again for a Friday night quick meal if I can learn how to save the crust.

Really good and easy to make!! I used Boboli pizza crust. I deviated slightly from the steps. I shredded the chicken as it cooked which decreased the cooking time. While it cooked, I salted it and added garlic powder. After I spread the ranch dressing on the crust, I sprinkled dried oregano to give it an authentic pizza taste. Since I didn't have tomatoes or green onions, I added chopped shitake mushrooms, which definitely added to the gourmet-ness of the pizza. This pizza was truly tasty and it's the ranch dressing that is the differentiator. When you bite into it the zangy taste of the dressing pops through. So be sure you like ranch dressing before using this recipe. Will definitely make again!

My family has been converted to pizza with ranch dressing instead of something tomato based. So far whatever we've put on a refridgerated crust with ranch has been great - pepperoni, seasoned chicken, buffalo chicken, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, artichokes (my favorite) and cheese. Guests have been thrilled as well. The Pillsbury crusts would really well.

Delish!!!  I used a homemade pizza crust with this and it was to die for!!  I also used reduced fat Ranch to cut calories and it was just fine.  Will be making again and again.  I wonder how it would be with some bacon?  Hmmmm!!!

I cooked my chicken on the stove in buffalo sauce and it was delicious!  I also used canned tomatoes which worked very well. I wasn't crazy about the refrigerated dough, I will probably stick with a jiffy box mix from now on. I'm excited to make this pizza and share it with my friends and family next time!

I made this tonight, and totally followed the recipe.  It was very good.  I knew it was a keeper, when my husband got done, and told me, "Don't loose that Recipe.  Basically, a quick, easy, filling supper.  Just throw in a salad like I did, and you have it made.

Very nice change of pace from traditional pizza sauce pizza.  I didn't have ranch dressing so used the powder ranch dip mix.  It still tasted pretty good.  I personally don't like chicken pizza but shredding the chicken is the key!

Although the cooking time should be lowered (I set my timer for 20 minutes and when I checked on the pizza it was thisclose to being burnt!), I really loved this recipe. What a great, quick dinner option. I cut corners and used pre-cooked chicken (it was a long day), omitted the onions (don't like em), and added chopped bacon (love bacon). It was super yummy.

Tasty and easy! I added a bit more cheese and 1 extra chicken breast. I sauteed my chicken in a little olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic. I used Pillsbury pizza dough. Will def make again.

This is fabulous!  I usually buy the rising crust chicken pizza from the frozen food section-but no more.  I always make my own crust using my Kitchenaid and topped with leftover grilled chicken, tomatoes, green onions, crumbled bacon and of course ranch dressing and cheeses.  The whole family loves this pizza and can't wait til I make it again.

good topping combo!  i used a crust recipe i found on here (rather than the store bought variety).  i even froze leftovers for future lunches and those thawed and reheated fine (the crust i used was a chewier variety to begin with, not crunchy).  everyone at the office wanted to know what i was eating!

Oh my gosh this is yummy! I just made it for the first time and I know it's a keeper. I will need to play with the times a little to get the crust just right... it turned out a little crispy for my liking... but otherwise I have nothing bad to say! I did add some half cooked thinly sliced bacon because I was really looking for a chicken bacon ranch pizza recipe. I also threw in some shredded parmesan with the cheddar. So good!!

This was wonderful.  My modifications: marinaded the chicken breasts in an Italian marinade before baking (instead of cooking in skillet), added fresh basil & minced garlic, used parmesan for the cheddar (couldn't believe I was out of cheddar) and pre-baked for only 5 minutes @ 400 based on recommendations by other reviewers. This recipe is a keeper!!

Amazing as a grilled pizza!!!! I really struggled with the dough to the point where I was ready to give up. I am so glad I didn't but I'll definitely give boboli a try next time. I seasoned and grilled the chicken. The green onion flavor really came through and made it a hit for me. My husband and kids loved it!! This recipe is a keeper for me :)

Great recipe! I made my own beer inspired pizza crust. Baked it in my 14" cast iron skillet. I did not use as much salad dressing as suggested. I only drizzled and spread enough to cover the crust. I also sliced my tomatoes thin and sliced a white onion. I left off the cheddar and just used a shredded italian blended cheese. Yummy. It was great. I could have eaten the whole thing myself it was so good.

Everyone in the family really liked this recipe; my crust got too brown though. The second time I only baked the pizza for 15 minutes, and it was perfect!

This was a great basic recipe to which I only made a few changes to simplify it even more.  I used a "Boboli"-type ready-to-bake pizza crust, brushed it with a little olive oil, then followed the recipe for the most part, but adding jalepenos.  The only additional changes I would make next time would be to substitute red onion for the green onion.  Great, quick and easy meal.  Would also be an excellent party appetizer!

This is a great pizza.  Very fresh tasting and quick weeknight meal.  I added some sweet peppers, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  Delicious!

This was really tasty! I usually make pizzas by buying naan bread as a base, this time I had garlic flavor on hand. To cut down on fat I used fat-free ranch dressing and half the amount of cheese. The supermarket didn't have green onions so I used red, cut very thin and left in half circles and it was great!

I wanted something with fewer calories and fat so I omitted the ranch dressing and used a can of Hunt's spaghetti sauce instead.  I also sprinkled it with some homegrown basil from my window sill.  It was great.

Wow, a great flavor combo.  I used slightly less than a 1/2 cup of ranch because it has such a powerful taste.  I made a few substitutions and made the pizza even quicker - diced Perdue shortcuts chicken, canned, diced & well drained tomatoes mixed with a bit of crushed garlic and I added precooked (real) bacon bits.  I will be making this often.

This was delicious, I will have to double the sauce next time. I added chopped broccoli, omitted the green onions and added bell pepper instead. A refreshing taste compared to the traditional pizza. Highly recommend "garden herb loaf" recipe on here as the crust. Great combo! Just halve the dough recipe.

We were not huge fans of this recipe.  It was okay, but not spectacular by any means.  I think that it was the ranch dressing, perhaps it would be better if was alfredo sauce, but really I just think the whole thing was too rich.

The flavors in this recipe are good, I enjoyed it a lot.  I don't recommend 20-25 minutes at 425 degrees though, since mine came out nearly burnt after 15 minutes.  Maybe I used a different kind of dough.  Just keep an eye on it!

Delicious! I think next time I will only use mozzarella, or maybe use monterey jack instead of cheddar. The cheddar just seemed a bit out of place to me. Regardless, this was delicious. Next time I will definitely also add some fresh sliced mushrooms. I did use Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site instead of store bought.  Thank you :)

Good, but not great. I wouldn't change anything, I think it's just my taste. My boyfriend tried his with normal pizza sauce and he seemed to really like his.

I really enjoyed this pizza and probably would have given it 4 stars, but my husband did not like it. He said it was too "saucy" and proceeded to accidentally on purpose leave the leftovers on the kitchen counter overnight. I think subconsciously he wanted to make sure I didn't make him eat the leftovers.

This is a keeper! My family of 5 all loved it!  A key ingredient were the FRESHLY GROWN tomatoes of SUMMER!  I also seasoned the chicken as it cooked with a little garlic salt and Lawry's seasoning.  I added a little diced green pepper with the green onion - and cut down on the onion. The green and red color with the cheddar cheese make a nice presentation! I was afraid of the ranch - and may have gone less than what recipe called for -- but WOW -- it was a nice touch for flavor!

We really love this pizza.  If you leave your tomatoes in whole slices, you save time chopping and it's just as tasty.  We use far less dressing than what is called for and it is still delicious!

Good pizza. I added crumbled bacon and fresh garlic to liven up the flavors. Also made it easy and used a rotisserie chicken.

I'm amazed!  I took lots of shortcuts, and this was still wonderful.  My picky husband raved.  I used canned pizza dough, canned chicken, and canned diced tomatoes.  I did add bacon and also spinkled a little garlic powder on the pizza before I added the cheese.  By the way - another reviewer mentioned that the toppings slid off the ranch dressing, but I didn't have that problem at all.

My family loved this and I have picky teenagers.  I cooked the chicken with onions, garlic, salt and pepper.  I tossed the chickn after I cut it up in ranch dressing.  I added some red pepper, red onions (instead of green - but both would be great!) and bacon, but I think I preferred it without the bacon.  Next time I will add some fresh chopped spinich and maybe some fresh chopped basil as well.

This was a really yummy pizza! Thank you for the recipe..especially suggesting using the ranch as the sauce.  I love pizza, but it can get a little mundane..this was something really different.
The only thing we added extra were a few mushrooms and some diced onions.  Very delish! :)

I enjoy ranch and this was only "ok" for me. Tasted rather bland, actually. I'll consider making it again, but will probably use a different kind of crust. I used refrigerated as instructed in the recipe and it tasted like chicken and cheese on biscuits.

I like the general idea of this, but I did it a little different. I didn't have any refrigerated pizza crust, but I did have refrigerator biscuts. So I pressed them flat and pre-baked them for about 5 minutes, flipped them over and topped with ranch dressing, chicken, bacon, tomatoes and cheese! These were so good and it was easy to personalize (my son really wanted peperoni!)

Awesome! I made a few changes, but still feel this recipe deserves 5 stars! I added a few slices of chopped bacon, used canned petite diced tomatoes, add a minced clove of garlic to the dressing and coated the cooked chicken in Frank's Wing Sauce and a bit of butter. I also made the crust using the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust Recipe.

Needs more tomatoes and scallions, less ranch, more crust per topping. Also, it doesn't need to be in the oven that long after the bread has been precooked--you'll just burn the very bottom of the crust. I only thought this dish was so-so, but my husband seemed to like it (though he agreed with my assertions about the toppings and such). Though I don't have any kids of my own, this seems like a dish kids would like. Enjoy!

This on my alltime favorite list. This recipe is so easy and tasty. You can easily use a store pre-cooked bbq chicken and add any vege or meat that you like. One time I couldn't find the canned pizza so I got a box of pizza crust to make. I don't recommend that, but when made as directed, yum! I loved the ranch dressing and tomatoes on them.

One of the best pizzas I have ever made. A good change to the usual red sauce kind of pizza. I also added onions and peppers that I had sauteed with seasonings. And substituted actually making chicken with Perdue pre-cooked strips to save time.

So this was going to be the first recipe that I rated 4 stars.  However, my husband said that this was the best pizza he ever had.  So I'm rating it a 5.  I guess it just depends on your tastes.

You've gotta try this pizza! I used a boboli pizza crust and marinated the chicken in italian dressing. Then I added crumbled bacon and mushrooms. I used roma tomatoes and highly recommend them because their sweet flavor complimented the pizza perfectly. It was wonderful! Next time, my husband suggested, to perhaps use 2 parts ranch and 1 part red sauce as the base. I think that would be great! Not only does it taste good but it's beautiful, too!

This was good. I may make it again. I added fresh ground black pepper and that really helped with the flavor. Otherwise, it was pretty bland. Maybe if I try it again I'll add some bacon and green pepper, maybe a little garlic too and definitely more pepper.

This was ok, it wasn't a failure, but it wasn't something we will rave about either.  It seemed a little bland - and I added red onions, mushrooms and bell peppers to it.  Also, either the cooking time or cooking temperature was wrong, because after 17 minutes the edges were turning dark brown.  I should have been watching it more carefully.  I will try to find another similar recipe that has more flavor.

Excellent! I added jerk seasoning to the chicken & we put a little hot wing sauce on it after it was done. My husband and I both loved it, and even my 14 month old baby ate it (minus the hot sauce).

This was good.  I added about 6 slices of crumbled bacon and we enjoyed that.  A nice alternative to "regular" pizza sauce!

I loved it!  The only thing I changed was I did half ranch and half creamy parmesean dressing, and I cooked it for about half the time.

This was my first homemade pizza, it turned out to be delicious. My boyfriend doesn't like ranch dressing so I used marinara sauce on half the crust. I also used a scant amount of ranch, half the cheese called for (to make a bit healthier). Season your chicken breasts with a bit of salt, pepper, garlic powder, oregano and basil. This was so yummy! Thanks for a great idea!

At first I really didnt think that this was going to turn out good cause Im not a big ran of ranch but it was really tasty! I put some seasoned salt and ground pepper on the chicken to give it some flavor and I used pepper jack and cheddar cheese. I'll be making this again!

Wow, this is the best pizza I've had in a long time.  I used premade pizza crust in the personal size because I'm single.  I added italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, crushed red pepper.  I used canned chicken because I'm lazy and the taste is still great.  You'll enjoy this one.

Wow! Husband even loved it ! I doctored mine a little since we like a lot of flavor. Sauted the chicken in jamaican jerk seasoning with a couple dabs of hot sauce and little tomato paste added near the end which added a little bite without too much spice. Also layered spinach, mushrooms, and minced garlic along with the other ingredients. Would definately watch the cooking time, mine was almost cut in half. The ranch dressing made the perfect white sauce. Great recipe - much better than any frozen gourmet pizza from the grocery store.

All I can say is, Wow.  I did make a few minor changes though - I added a clove of minced garlic to my chopped tomatoes, I used a few spoonfuls of seasoned canned diced tomatoes since some people said it was a bit dry, I added a handful of sliced fresh mushrooms, I sauteed the chicken in a bit of olive oil and butter (to prevent burning) and generously sprinkled on Emeril's Essence (I'm sure any cajun seasoning would have the same effect)....I was also distracted and completely forgot to add the ranch, so I just drizzled about 1/4 cup over the top of everything (oops, I was on the phone telling my mom what I was making).  Umm...and I also used colby-jack instead of the cheddar....I know that sounds like a lot of changes, but it really wasn't...  :)  This is defintely a keeper and my friends loved it, my boyfriend said it tasted really good and he could never make a good pizza at home and he worked at a pizza place for 3 years.  I had one leftover slice and brought it to another friend to try the next day, and even reheated in the microwave he said it was really good.

We loved this pizza!  We just moved from a big city to a small rural town, and this reminded us of a pizza we might order at California Pizza Kitchen (which we miss now that we moved!).  Thanks for the recipe.  We'll definitely make this again!

I found this pizza to be quite dry. Maybe needed more ranch? The ranch was tasty and worked as a pizza sauce. Also very bland as writen. I added minced garlic to the ranch, and seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and cajun seasoning. Still felt like it was missing something. I think I might try with regular pizza sauce next time.

This tasted good and looked pretty. Used canned diced tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh and made my own ranch dressing. I drizzed some of the ranch dressing in between the layers since there were some comments about this being dry. Used a thin ready made crust.

Yummy!!  I made slight modifications since my husband and I like a lot of flavor.  I cut the chicken into small pieces and seasoned with salt and pepper before frying.  I added two cloves of garlic, two tablespoons of olive oil, oregano, basil, and thyme to the diced tomato and let them sit for a while before cooking.  Thank you for the great recipe!!

I have to give this 4 stars because I changed it so much but it tasted so good it was really 5 stars.  I used two Boboli style pizza crusts.  Blue cheese dressing instead of ranch.  Divided a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano between the two pizzas.  I minced two cloves of garlic then added them to a heated pan with extra virgin olive oil.  I took a package of chicken thighs trimmed the fat and cut them into bite sized pieces sprinkled them with California garlic salt and a dash of cayenne pepper and added them to the heated pan of olive oil and minced garlic & dried minced onions until the chicken was almost cooked through.  I added the chicken to the pizzas.  Topped them with a combination of mozzarella & cheddar cheese.  Finished them off with sliced black olives.  Yummy!

I will still give this recipe 5 stars, even though it was dry for me. I replaced the plain pizza dough with whole wheat and added more chicken. I think my seemed kinda dry because of that. I was suprised that the ranch dressing tasted so good on this. I used perrorcorn instead of plain. I would make this again, just use the amount called for on chicken and maybe add more cheese.

The flavors of this pizza go really well together, but...it's just missing something.  If I decide to try it again, I will probably add a "zesty" style ranch dressing, and maybe some pepper flakes.  Still very good, though - maybe a flavored herb crust would help it a bit.

I used half of 'Jay's signature pizza crust'. I also bought a very flavorful rotisserie chicken, using a part of it for this recipe.  I only used mozzarella cheese--our family's preference.  I also added mushrooms. My family did not care for the green onions. Next time, I will use onion powder and a thin layer of pizza sauce to go over a thin layer of ranch dressing.  I think it would jazz it up a bit. A great recipe from which to work.

AWESOME chicken pizza!!!  I made one slight change. Instead of 1/2 cup Ranch dressing. I used 1/4 cup ranch, and 1/4 cup Alfredo sauce! Turned out great. Thanks Lessalee for a great recipe!

This recipe was very tasty.  The only changes I made was that I left out the green onions and added some mushrooms.  I also used this recipe as a base recipe for another kind of pizza.  I just substituted saugage for the chicken and pizza sauce for the ranch.  That recipe was delicious as well.

This was my first attempt at homemade pizza and it was a hit! I made it a few weeks ago and my husband has been asking for it again ever since! I took one user's suggestion to season the chicken and it was excellent.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Fabulous!  I used peppercorn ranch which gave it a nice kick.  You probably don't need quite as much cheese as it calls for but if you're feeling decadent, go for it.

This was wonderful!!!!  I chopped up the chicken before I cooked it and added seasonings to it as it was sauteing.  Easy and so delicious.  Next time though I think it would be better with a Boboli crust and some garlic!  Thanks!

We just had this for dinner. I asked my husband what I should put and he said 3 stars.  He said, "It was above average, and will eat it again, but I don't want it all the time".  I thought it was pretty and will eat the left overs for lunch tomorrow.

What can I say, this recipe is simply delicious! My family were all skeptical until they tasted it.  I added a layer of mild salsa over ranch dressing and the result was sonderful--also, I used the pizza dough II recipe which is also great-thanks!

This was good pizza, but needed more flavor.  I added chopped artichoke and used a home-made crust, but probably won't make again.

Wow.  I'm surprised!  I've gotten tired of so many things tasting like ranch dressing... But this was really yummy!  I've tried it with several other things, and my favorites- by a long shot- are with Ken's Creamy Tomato Bacon dressing or sun dried tomoato alfredo sauce!  Yummmm!

This was really good.  I didn't change anything. My picky children loved it and my not so picky husband pigged out.  Quick and easy with the leftover grilled chicken breast that I usually have in the freezer.

Excellent recipe.  I will definitely make it again and again.
Be careful with the cooking time though.  I baked it the second time for 10 minutes and almost burned it.  Twenty minutes would have been too long.
The flavors were still great though!

Super pizza! I used the recipe as a starting point and made a few changes/additions. First I used a whole wheat pizza crust, BLT Ranch dressing, tofu cheeses, and added artichoke hearts. Oh yes, I used sun dried tomatoes instead of regular ones - I forgot to buy some. This was really yummy. Next time I think I might experiment with other vegetables/meats. This was really good. I made this again and added some sauted mushrooms.. even better.

I made this the other night and was very pleased with the outcome. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to saute the chicken in extra virgin olive oil with minced garlic, salt & pepper and I topped the pizza with dried basil flakes. I also noticed that the crust was golden brown after the 7 minutes so I lowered the heat to 400 degrees and baked the pizza for 15 min. instead of 20 - 25 min. It came out perfect. What's really great about this recipe is that you can add extra veggies or different meats, whatever you like.

I am not exactly sure how many stars to give this recipe.  I think that it would have been good if it wouldn't have been so BURNED!!!  I baked the crust on a baking sheet.  After the initial 7 minutes of pre-baking it had a nice, light, golden brown color to it.  I piled it with toppings, put it back in the oven for only 19 or 20 minutes (recipe said 20-25) and it was smoking!  The top actually turned out pretty well, but the ENTIRE bottom of the crust was burned!  And I mean completely black burned!  So, I think that a lower temp (maybe 400 instead of 425) might be the answer.  I am going to give it one more try, as the toppings seemed a good combination.....just very disappointed about the burned crust.  So, watch this pizza in the oven very carefully, and you may want to think about turning down the temp for the final baking.

Absolutely fantastic... used my own crust and added baby portabellos, and it turned out so fancy with very little work.  The ranch wasn't really weird at all.  Lovely!

My husband and his brother thank you!  They beg for this constantly!   I use a pre-fab crust brushed with olive oil instead and go way overboard on the cheeses just because that the way we like it.  Thanks for this winner!

This is great!  Substituted a Boboli ready made thick crust. Put all the original recipe ingredients on, plus mushrooms and jalapenos.  Have made this every week since I found the recipe - thanks so much - it's a keeper:)

This was a wonderful dish down frou-frou pizza lane. Made it with Jay's Signature Crust (very easy with a Kitchenaid!)  Used deli broiled chicken and Kraft Caeser Ranch, threw a few pieces of minced garlic over it and OOOOH YEEAH!  Husband was a bit nervous b/c of ranch but was pleasantly suprised.  This we will munch on again!!!!  Thanks Lessalee :)

My family loved this recipe!  I used a Boboli Crust and grilled the chicken.  It was awesome!  It is very similar to a well known pizza chain's recipe but only better.  Not only was it great tasting but simple to make.  Thank you for sharing!

We made a stuffed pizza using the Italain Bread Bowl recipe by Kerri Skrudland for our pizza crust which works great & gives you left over dough for bread sticks. Also, we used Bacon Ranch-style dressing & added bacon/bites along with garlic for seasoning. This was GREAT!!!!!!!

I thought my 14 year old son would hate it. Imagine my surprise when he thanked me for making it and told me that he loved it! I added some bacon to the chicken. Judi

This was Fabulous!  My children all loved it!  I did cook the chicken with some soy sauce and garlic as recommended by others.  I didn't use any tomatoes.  I made this on a homemade pizza crust using Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe. 
This turned out great!

We enjoyed this - I, too, used the Bobli crust. Also, rather than sauteeing the chicken, I purchased fajita chicken already prepared - all I did was cut it into smaller pieces.  Also added mushrooms. Will use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!

Because of the ranch dressing I didn't think that I would like it.  But my husband wanted me to make it.  SO I did and I am very glad.  It was wonderful.  My almost ate the whole pizza by himself!

This pizza was absolutely fantastic.  Rather than a refrigerated crust, we used Boboli, and my husband went nuts for it!  I recommend using a generous amount of ranch.  I sauteed the shredded chicken with olive oil, soy sauce and garlic.  Definately a new regular meal in our home.

I used alfredo sauce instead of the ranch, and added red onions, artichokes, and mushrooms.  My husband usually won't eat anything out of the meat and potatoes food group, and he couldn't get enough!

My sister loves pizza, but I don’t care for it unless it’s garlic chicken, I know, I’m weird. I would make one every once in a while, with Alfredo sauce, but it was a lot of work as we make everything from scratch (Alfredo sauce & dough). Well when she was making pizza once I asked her to do a chicken one and she did it just like this, with ranch, thinking that’s what ya always use, it was so good, and she makes it quite a bit now, and I was surprised when I realized she used ranch dressing ( homemade). Just be sure to get enough or it will be dry.

Quick and easy, especially since I keep diced, cooked chicken in the freezer. Loved the Ranch alternative. Would add cooked, diced bacon next time.

Very good but we are not Ranch dressing fans so I switched to Alfredo garlic sauce, much more flavorful. Also we make our own dough, 6 cups flour,1 tblspn sugar, 1 tblespn salt [heaping], 1 package yeast in warm water. Enough dough for two large pizzas.

This was pretty great. Changes for next time: add bacon, and reduce the heat - my crust burned around the edges, Otherwise, a pretty big hit in my house!

Don't make this.  You will eat it ALL!  Or almost all of it lol.. this was very yummy - hubby loved it.  Seasoned chicken while cooking with garlic powder, salt and Italian seasoning.  Also added fresh spinach leaves and fresh chopped mushrooms to the toppings, left out onions.  Used all mozzarella.  Trick for Pilsbury crust, after you grease your cookie sheet, sprinkle a little corn meal on the pan, then roll it out.  Makes it really crispy crunchy!

This was very good!  Didn't have tomatoes or green onions so I added red peppers and bacon bits that I fried up.  Used Tyson grilled chicken strips that I cut up into smaller pieces.  Forgot the cheddar but it was good without it.

I have been working on my own dough recipe and homemade pizza and have had only moderate success (just can't get the right dough).  But I tried this recipe and made it exactly as is (taking into account the comments about too much ranch dressing - I used a thin layer).  My husband said it was the best pizza/crust I ever made.  I had to tell him (with a scowl):  "Yeah, it's store-bought."  But this was a huge hit with us.  I've made it three times now and each time it's delicious.  I've added bacon to it, too, since and it's excellent!

My family loved this recipe!!! It took me no time to make at all. I followed the ingredients exactly but I was very liberal with the amounts. My brother asked me if I could make the "chicken explosion" pizza again. My dad says no more buying pizza from the local pizza depot. Huge hit, one of the best yet. Thank you!

I had pre-made dough and supermarket rotisserie chicken on hand, so this looked like a great Saturday afternoon lunch, and it was! My husband loved it (comparing it to the actual gourmet pizza place in town). Using ingredients I had on hand in combination with tips provided by other reviewers, I made the following modifications: used Light Ranch dressing, seasoned the cooked chicken with Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning, used a drained 14.5 oz can of Hunts diced Oregan/Rosemary tomatoes, used shallots in place of the green onions, and added a sprinkle of Baco-Bits on top before popping it into the oven. Followed the baking instructions and layering of ingredients exactly from the original recipe. What a tasty pizza. Flavorful, firm, filling, and very pretty to look at. This is a keeper.

I changed it up a bit and did just chicken and bacon on one side and chicken bacon and diced tomatoes on the other. My hubby loved it. He does not like ranch anything, but he loved this pizza. I will be making this again.

Loved this.  I used a premade frozen pizza crust and the only thing I did differently was added real bacon bits.  I will definitely be making again!

I usually use marinated chicken that was cooked in the George Foreman for this recipe. Everything that's in it just makes it so yummy.

I wouldn't call it gourmet, but my husband and I liked it. I made my own pizza crust, but otherwise followed the recipe. Next time, I will cook my crust about 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients.

I used Boboli Thin Crust topped with leftover chicken, fresh garden tomatoes , a small green bell pepper sliced thin and  Italian five blend cheese.   Excellent !!  Next time, I will make two so there will be some leftovers for lunch the next day.  Thanks for sharing a quick weekday meal.

This was great! The cook time would have been way too long though. Not sure if I did something wrong but the crust was brown and crispy and the cheese was melted around the 10 minute mark. No complaints though. Everyone loved it!

I added italian seasoning, garlic powder, bacon, and a little parmesan and romano cheeses. I didn't bother to precook my dough, and it took about 15 min on a cookie sheet, and even less time for the one cooked on the pizza pan. Husband, myself and 3 kids loved it. It was delicious!

Delicious!  My pizza crust called for a baking temp of 400, so that's what I set it to.  I also used canned tomatoes with garlic and onion, light ranch dressing, fat free cheese, and added fresh sliced mushrooms and spices (garlic powder, oregano, and basil).  So, so good!

As for ease, flavor, and presentation, this deserves 5 stars. As for crust, 3 stars. I am used to homemade. I added granulated garlic and bacon. I will make this often but will use a different crust. I baked it less time. I spread dough onto a cookie sheet, prebaked 5 minutes, then slid it off after baked, to cut. 5 stars anyway cuz its a great recipe! I'm gonna eat some more.....update: I just made this with homemade crust last week and again this week! wonderful flavor!!!

Excellent!!!  I was lazy and bought some diced tomatoes in a can....they were basil, olive oil and garlic flavored and I dont' think I would use just regular tomatoes in the future after having done this.  It added a ton of great flavor.  The only other thing I added was bacon to make it a little more sinful ;)  Very good recipe thanks for sharing - it will be a staple in my house.

If you like pizza with alot of goodies and tons of flavor then this is your pizza. I think I might have been fine with not having the ranch or barely having any at all. There were so many flavors it didnt need that extra ranch. I used Trader's Joe's pre made crust, so yummy and used all lowfat products, turned out great. If you want something hearty this is your pizza!

Yummy and easy. It didn't take the full 40 min to bake. I baked the crust according to the package and the pizza was done in approximately 25 min. I also mixed pesto with the ranch dressing.

This pizza was really good, the only thing is that the crust got too dark.  Next time  I make it, I'm going to cook the crust for only a couple minutes, then add ingredients, and bake for an additional 10 mins.  Also, I used red onion because I didn't have scallions.

Great homemade pizza! I used a Boboli crust (just to cut time), and canned tomatoes with basil. 

When cooking the chicken, season it during the cooking process, used Italian seasoning, garlic powder, S&P. 

Will make again. I enjoyed and so did my 2yr old.

This recipe was simple and delicious. Instead of ranch though, I used a packaged alfredo sauce, spread fresh roasted garlic on the crust first and instead of fresh tomatoes, used a can of diced tomatoes with italian seasoning and then added crumbled bacon.

I make my own pizza dough, but next time will make thicker dough, sprinkled with corn meal on the bottom..  Then I sprinkled freshly grated Parmesan cheese on the dough and baked for 5 minutes.  Pulling out the pre-baked dough,  I added a tablespoon of pesto to my fresh tomatoes after I chopped them.  Using garlic butter,1 I sauteed the chicken and onions until done.  I used 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons of ranch dressing,  Instead of Mozzarella cheese, I used Mexican blend for all the cheese (all I had on hand)...Excellent flavor!  This definitely goes into my Recipe Box.  Oh!  I baked mine @ 500 degrees...better crust that way.

This was GREAT! My entire family loved it, my mom and dad, my little brother, AND my extremely picky little sister!  I made my own crust, a no-yeast recipe with oregano and crushed red pepper flakes in it.  Also, I seasoned my chicken with salt, black pepper, garlic, and cilantro. I didn't chop mt tomatoes, but got some romas and did them thin-slice. I used regular onions and green peppers, and some mushrooms. And, I only used cheddar, because we didn't have any mozzarella on hand. It was AMAZING!

Delicious! I made the following alterations. Cooked chicken tenderloin in olive oil with Italian seasoning and chopped garlic on chicken. Sauteed onion while chicken cooked. Used ranch dressing over crust. Used as toppings: bacon, onion, fresh mushrooms, chopped tomatoes , mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Family loved it - will make again!

This has become one of my favorites! I get a rotissare chicken from the store and cut it up and then follow the rest of the directions. It is super good and easy! I would recommend watching the cooking time on it. Mine cooked much faster than 20 minutes, more like 10-15 minutes.

I think you have to be a ranch dressing lover to like this dish.  1/2 cup ranch isn't that much but it was still too much for me.  I forgot to put the tomatoes on but I don't think that would've made much of a difference.

Very Good! Especially when you make it as a grilled pizza and with mushrooms. The chicken is better when seasoned with garlic salt, oregano and basil.

The pizza was okay, not great though.  I will probably use my old pizza recipe in the future.  It seemed to be lacking flavor, might be good with cilantro added.

Seasoned chicken with garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt & pepper before frying. It was a good pizza - good to try something without tomato sauce.

Delicious!! I made the pizza crust recipe from the food processor book (3 1/3 c. flour).  Doubled the sauce, but used 1/2 Ranch 1/2 BbQ sauce--actually about a total of 1 1/3 c.  Also, nearly doubled the cheese, kept chicken the same, added red pepper and used extra tomatoes and green onions.  Everyone LOVED!!

easy, delicious recipe! I added pasta sauce instead of ranch dressing.  Also added sauteed bell peppers and onions, added garlic powder and garlic salt to cooked chicken.  I bought the pillsbury pizza dough, and FYI- it is square shaped, so would be easier to use a square cookie sheet when baking.  I also shaved off a few minutes when baking the crust, and baking the pizza as a whole, or it definitely would have burned.

This was excellent except the crust. Next time I will use one of the mixes that come in a bag and you just add warm water. All the topping were very goumet and delicious but didn't work on that kind of crust. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good! Next time I will try to use a boboli crust rather than using the canned kind. Also, I think I would use less ranch dressing as it was a little too much sauce.

Excellent Pizza, my only suggestion is use alfredo sauce instead of Ranch dressing it adds a nice little flavor to it!

This was a great recipe for chicken pizza! I followed the recipe exactly and as a few others have said, I agree that you need to season the chicken, maybe add some bacon or even chop up a rotisserie chicken. I will definitely make this again.

OMG! This pizza IS the best ever! I basically followed the recipe but I did add sauteed mushrooms, artichoke hearts and doubled the cheeses. I sauteed bonless/skinless chicken thighs(thats what I had, in a little olive oil with garlic, Italian sesoning and lemon pepper. I used Roma tomatos from our garden. Next time I will drain them more. I bought fresh dough at Weis Market and it was very good and easy to work with. I used my Pampered Chef baking stone. This is pizza for grown-ups! We will be having this again!

Delish!  I made this with the Pizza Crust recipe from this site (by Connorsmom).  The only things I changed was that I didn't use green onion (only because I didn't have it on hand) and used the diced tomatoes in a can that are already seasoned as someone else suggested.  Quick and easy!

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband LOVED it!  I think that next time I will definitely add  bacon and chopped green pepper.  I will also use white cheddar instead of yellow for a white pizza look. This recipe is a keeper.

I use canned diced tomatoes with garlic and basil to give it a little more flavor and add fresh bacon. I also use quite a bit of chicken (because who wants skimpy pizza), cook it in olive oil and italian seasoning for extra flavor, and don't measure the ranch dressing. You can use whatever kind of cheese you have at home; I usually use colby jack. Putting the cheese on top helps to keep all the toppings from falling off. Because I don't like traditional pizza sauce, this is my kind of pizza, and I everyone I make it for loves it!

This was delicious.  Be careful, the cooking time was way too long.  I took it out after 10 minutes and it was way too dark.  I'll have to either turn down the over and/or cook for a significantly shorter time if I make this again

Delicious!  I made my own crust for this pizza, adding dried basil and oregano to the dough, and I used canned chicken to shorten prep time.  I did not have green onions so I used chopped Vidalia onion.  That's the only variation.  It didn't really need anything else, but you could add mushrooms, garlic, olives, etc.  Definitely a "keeper" recipe!

Unreal!!  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and a roll out pizza crust from the store....could not have been better....I was afraid that the Ranch dressing would overpower the fresh veggies and chicken, but my husband loves Ranch, so I put it on.....you could barely tell it was there, but somehow it enhanced the flavors!!!   This is a keeper!!

Made this recipe today and served it up to 4 guys who loved it. It is easy and very tasty for a different kind of pizza. We had grilled chicken the day before and I always make extra for a salad or something the next day, so I used it on this pizza. Will definately be making this again.

This wasn't really what I was expecting. I was hoping it would taste like the Walmart Great Value Bacon Cheddar Ranch pizza. Its not even close. That frozen Pizza is the BEST pizza I've ever had. On the other hand, this pizza isn't bad. The only portion of the recipe I followed was the time (which is too much) and the amount of cheese & ranch. I threw on a lot of bacon, some cooked onions, and some frozen precooked & seasoned chicken. My first bite I was kinda disgusted. But once it cooled off a little it was better. Definitely something different. A little weird flavor. Probably not a favorite of mine. But not horrible. I think my other issue was the dough never rose (despite the water being the right temp and the yeast being good). As for the cooktime, I precooked my own dough 7 minutes, took it out put the cheese and ranch on, and popped it back in for 14 minutes. It was done. Maybe a little over done. Then I put all the cooked stuff on top and put it in a turned off oven for a couple minutes. I'll try it again with a different dough. I sure wish I could figure out what Walmart uses for Ranch on their pizza.

Delicious pizza.  Different but not too different.  I've tried it twice.  First time I set the timer and didn't keep an eye on the pizza and it was too well done.  Second time I watched it...and the cooking time was much less than directed.  But the end result was great.  I used some leftover chicken that we grilled the night before so it kind of had a charcoal-y grilled taste which was fine.  But no matter what chicken I use, I know I'll like the end result.

My DH had never had chicken pizza and was rather hesitant about this.  He loved it and even has asked me to make it for his daughters who likes it as much as their Dad.  I do put a little extra cheese because whats pizza without cheese.

Excellent! I used a little less of everything, but more tomatoes since I love them! I used a homemade crust rolled out very thin, so I didn't want to weigh it down too much. I marinated the chopped tomatoes in plenty of minced garlic, kosher salt, and some olive oil (about 30 mins) and then used the water/oil mix that came out of the tomatoes to baste the dough before pre-baking. This was so good, I can't wait to make it again!

This pizza is so good. I cooked the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic, and then added bacon bits to the pizza. I topped it all with feta cheese and it was delicious. I also suggest trying the pizza with a garlic butter sauce in place of ranch if you don't want the ranch flavoring. Gourmet pizzas are so yum!

this pizza is so, so delicious!  I find myself craving it all the time!  It's extremely simple and easy. I use boboli for the crust and instead of the green onion, i use vidalia onion, but that's just a personal preference.  I happen to like mine a bit on the saucier side and I don't measure anything out w/this recipe so I can't really tell you if the measurements are correct, but the pizza itself is amazing!  
I realized after posting this that i left out the fact that i add bacon as well which sends this pizza right over the moon

Very good.  Used about a half a can of diced tomatoes since I didn't have fresh, and added bacon.  I used a homemade crust with the help of my bread machine and a recipe from this site, 'Garlic Lover's Pizza Crust for the Bread Machine.'  I didn't measure my ranch, opting for a thin layer since people said it was too ranchy, but wish I had done more.  Next time I will measure out the 1/2 cup as stated in the recipe.

Great pizza! I needed a quick dinner tonight and this was just the ticket :) My fiance and I had to grocery shop (we didn't get around to it this past weekend), so I knew that I couldn't spend a lot of time in the kitchen. On our shopping trip to the local Italian market, I picked up Tyson oven roasted chicken chunks (5 oz. pkg.) and fresh pizza dough to speed prep even further. When I got home, all I had to do was chop the veggies and voila! I followed Lessalee's directions almost exactly. My only change was seasoning my chicken with a bit of garlic powder (we like our garlic!). Next time, I will be sure to increase the onion to 1/2 c. (1/4 c. wasn't enough, IMHO) and add some fresh (or Hormel real pieces) of bacon. I will also most definitely pre-bake my crust (7 minutes was perfect) and then bake for 22.5 minutes as I did this time. I have found that if I do not pre-bake, the Caputo's crust I usually purchase ends up soggy. This time it was perfectly crisp (just how we prefer it). Thanks for sharing such a great recipe, Lesalee!!! My fiance didn't care for this (he doesn't care for ranch), but I sure did! I'll just have to make a smaller pizza for myself next time :)

This was great so full of flavor. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces, seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic powder, then sauteed it in olive oil. Also I used 2 cups of italian blend cheese instead of the mozz. and cheddar.

Really good flavor. I made it as written except used and sauteed fresh mushrooms and red onion instead of the veggies stated in the recipe. Could benefit also from bacon and pineapple. Cooked more like 18 minutes and that was perfect. Thanks!

Very easy recipe, and great for using up leftover chicken.  Remember that ranch tastes a lot stronger than pizza sauce, so you can get away with putting a little less sauce than normal. Alternately, you could mix a few tsps of ranch into the normal pizza sauce. And instead of dicing a tomato, I used 2 tbsp of bruschetta tomatoes in a jar from sam's club.

Delicious!  I made a few minor changes, I put it on whole wheat crust (my hubby barely noticed), seasoned the chicken liberally with salt and pepper and then sauted it in olive oil, I added bacon, substituted chives for green onions because that is what I had on hand, and drizzled olive oil on the crust before baking.  It was fabulous...will definately make again!

WONDERFUL...my husband gave it the "DO OVER" approval.  I tossed the chicken in HOT SAUCE before putting on the pizza..and used red onion instead of green.  And i used light ranch dressing-couldnt tell a difference!  mmmmm bacon...not as healthy but maybe next time!

This is a great base recipe!  I add other veggies before adding cheese.  Green and red peppers are normally my base veggies, instead of onions.  I also add red pepper flakes while cooking the chicken to kick up the heat.  Lastly I add some fake/real bacon (whatever I have on hand) to add some extra flavor.

I made this on a homemade pizza crust recipe I have been using for a while now, from this site.  I thought the ranch dress was a too strong as a pizza sauce, but my husband loved it.  I'll keep the recipe for now until I find something we can agree on.

VERY GOOD if you like ranch.  My daughter and I really enjoyed this pizza for the flavor, and it's quick and easy to prepare.  My husband and son, however, don't like ranch so of course they didn't care for it.  But if you like ranch, it's a keeper!

This was good.  I used Fat Free ranch dressing and it turned out runny.  I'll try different ranch dressing next time.  Aside from the ranch, I've made better homemade pizza.  I'll make this again though.  Thanks!

This was very good, and very easy.  I used a pre-baked (Boboli) pizza crust.  To lighten the recipe a little, I used light ranch dressing, and 2% milk cheeses.  To make the chicken a little quicker, I bought pre-cooked, pre-cut strips.  I made a second pizza and tossed the chicken in barbeque sauce, and that pizza was very good, too.  My boyfriend really liked both, although he thought that the original pizza was a little better.

Chicken on pizza makes my day! I made the crust myself and added some bacon to the recipe. I also made stuffed crust, and it turned out great. I will be making this one in the future, thanks a lot!

This is awesome.  I used a light ranch dressing and less than the called for ranch.  I just eyeballed it.  I was out of green onions so I substituted red onion.  I seasoned my chicken while I cooked it with pepper and garlic powder.  This was so easy, it took less than 30 minutes, including prep time.

I'm giving it 4 stars, but the way I made it I only give it 3 stars.  I left out the green onions and used a mixture of cheese instead of the specific ones listed.  I did add some Italian seasoning on top of the ranch dressing. We thought it was fine, but we prefer other pizzas over this one.  So, we'll probably not make this one again... a little too far from a typical pizza for our tastes.

We LOVED this recipe! It was easy to make and my bf absolutely loved it! I'm not a huge fan of ranch and I was definitely skeptical at first but I was glad I challenged myself to think outside the box. It tasted wonderful. I used Boboli crust. (I found it in the freezer/refrigerator section)

Was not bad but not spectacular. Would try to make again because it has potential. Maybe next time I would add more seasoning to meat and bacon on top of pizza.

At least 3 times a month, we order a delicious chicken ranch pizza at our favorite pizzeria. It has been well worth the $20 and 40 minute round trip. But I thought I would finally try making it myself and this recipe sounded pretty similar. Unfortunately, it didn't taste anything like what we normally get at the pizzeria. It wasn't bad, but I think overall there was just too much of all the ingredients as called for in the recipe. Maybe I was using a smaller pizza crust than what the recipe called for. I also didn't care for the combo of the mozzerella and cheddar cheeses. I might use this as a starting point for trying to re-create what we like but I won't make it again as written.

Thank you very much for the great recipe. I always use Jay's Signature Pizza Crust also found on this website for all kinds of pizza. And, I took Sweetee219's idea to add some bacon. My pizza tasted so good!

Yum yum...
I made this using a homemade pizza crust, and it turned out great!
But instead of the ranch, I used some alfredo sauce from a jar, and it had a similar creamy taste.

What a great recipe! My daughter practically inhaled it. It was easy to make and looked beautiful too. Watch the cooking time, as mine would have burned if I had left it in the oven for 20 minutes at the end. Thanks for the great recipe. This would also be a great way to use up leftover chicken or turkey.

I really loved this twist on pizza I always put ranch on my pizza, why not as the sauce.  Great idea.  Maybe next time I will try dipping it in marinara sauce.

This is so good! All of my favortie things in one meal! Everything works so perfectly together! The key is using your favorite Ranch dressing. I sprinkled a bit of Italian Seasoning and Garlic Powder on top of mine before sticking it in the oven. I will never go out and buy another pizza like this, I will be making this at home from now on!

suprisingly delicious, I made a home made crust and was very pleasantly suprised by the taste.  I didn't measure the ranch but just added what seemed like a good amount.

This recipe is wonderful. Each time I make it for guests it gets rave reviews!  I use Bacon Ranch dressing to give it that bacon flavor. I also sprinkle on some Pampered Chef dried italian seasonings before baking.  Give this a try!

I made the light version by using light ranch and low fat cheese. I also cut-down the amount of cheese I used. My husband still loved it! Great recipe!

My family loved it! YAY!!! Another new recipe to add to our meal rotation! I ended up using only 1/2 of the ranch called for (I used Light Hidden Valley Ranch) and cooked it for much less time than was called for. The crust was close to burning after only 10 minutes (after the original 7) and my oven usually takes much longer to cook things than called for in the recipes. Overall this was a hit!

this was ok... i have a feeling the type of ranch dressing makes a big difference. mine wasn't that good, so i think that may be why i didn't like it too much. i will try this again with a higher quality ranch dressing.

My family LOVED this recipe! It is much better than the local pizzarias chicken pizza. Instead of using regular ranch I used kraft low fat three cheese ranch and it was wonderful. Next time I will add garilc to the chicken as it cooks to give it a little more flavor. Overall GREAT recipe:) Healthy too!!

This was very good and easy!  I did make a few changes that I think helped a lot. I added Frank's Red hot to the chicken to give it a little more spice. I also used Boboli pizza crust, canned diced tomatoes and I added a little garlic to the tomatoes. My husband and I both really enjoyed it and I will make it again.

Just okay. I seasoned the chicken as others  had suggested and it still seemed pretty bland to me.

I was looking for a "non-traditional" pizza, and this fit the bill! It was absolutely yummy! The flavors worked really well together. I made 1/2 the pizza w/ green onions, the other 1/2 w/out for my picky kids -- and both sides were delicious. I'm going to be making this one again, and again. Try this recipe! You won't regret it.

Yum!  This was really good.  To save time, we used Perdue chicken shortcuts and canned diced tomatoes.  Hubby and I agreed that the tomatoes made this recipe.  I think we used Hunt's packed in balsamic vinegar, basil, and olive oil- highly recommended!  I sprinkled a little garlic powder on top of everything.  We'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This is a yummy and quick pizza. I use pre-cooked diced chicken breast and the refrigerated dough and it's quite good. Excellent for dinner when you just can't imagine standing in the kitchen all night.

The overall taste of this pizza was allright. However, this was only when the pizza was completly cooled. when the pizza came out of the oven, all the ingredients slid of it due to the ranch dressing. This made the pizza extremely distatseful and I would never make it again. All in all if you love cold pizza this would be a great recipe for you to try.

My family loves this pizza. I also add chopped bacon to the entire pizza. I put extra hot sauce on one side and leave it off the other. Makes for a family friendly pizza. One side for the kids and one side for us.

I love this recipe!!! Ever since I've prepared it, I only use ranch dressing for any kind of pizza I make. You can put any type of ingredients and it'll always turn out great! Try it with brocoli, feta cheese, mushrooms, salami, etc.

Very good. I used fat free sour cream on half of the pizza and it turned out very good. Next time I will add some more tomatoes and spices...it needed a little more flavor.

I can't believe I made this pizza myself, it tasted so good! I added a few additions: cornmeal at the bottom of the dough (for texture), bacon, seasoned the chicken, used spicy ranch instead of regular ranch, canned tomoatoes instead of regular tomatoes and finally, after it came out of the oven I topped it with fresh chopped cilantro! What's great about this recipe is that it is very versatile and you can change it or add to it whatever you like.

All I could think when eating the first piece was "best pizza ever".  I made my own dough, used Spectrum Naturals dressing, lowfat mozzarella and added olives.  WOW!  Next week when I make this again, we are going to add artichoke hearts and maybe a little more sauce.  The kid even ate it, which suprised me most.  Oh, the chicken I used was done in the crock pot with the Garlic Survival Co's garlic marinade.  Super moist and tasty chicken that way.

This was okay, not my favorite pizza. I thought the ranch dressing was an interesting choice, but not bad. 
My favorite pizza is chicken alfredo, and this did taste similar, but not better.

Wonderful!  I added baby spinach to this recipe to get in some more veggies and used Ken's hot sauce marinade when cooking the chicken for an extra kick.  I also had to cut back my baking time to 15 minutes so my crust wouldn't burn.  Excellent recipe which I will use over and over again.  Thanks.

I just got back from camping and didn't have much in my fridge. this was a great recipe to use quick defrost chicken and the can of crust i had. i wouldn't call it gourmet, but good i would say. i took the others' advice and seasoned my chicken with garlic, onion powder, chili powder, and salt. I'm glad I did. I didn't use all the tomatoes it called for either. ALL AROUND GOOD PIZZA!

This ties BBQ Chicken Pizza I as my favorite pizza. It was easy and delicious. I was afraid it would lose some of the homemade taste due to the bottled ranch dressing, but I couldn't even tell that it was ranch dressing. This is so yummy!!! I used frozen bread dough for the crust.

Used a store bought crust and leftover chicken. added a bit of crumbled bacon to dressing. I thought it was excelent, but hubby and kids prefered the traditional peperoni pizza that I  made as an option.

" Gourmet" is not the word I would use for this recipe. It was fun to make, but it will not remain in my recipe box. I like other reviewers ideas about using alfredo sauce or bleu cheese dressing instead of the ranch dressing, & remember to grab that bottle of Frank's red hot or bbq sauce to prepare the chicken in first or the pizza will be really bland.

I thought this was okay.  I used well over a cup of tomatoes and still thought it lacked the tomato flavor.  Perhaps pizza sauce, and not chopped tomatoes, is the way to go here.  I ended up eating most of this as leftovers; my family actually resorted to eating salad after they had tried this.  Not bad, but not worth the rave reviews either.

Thought it was overall pretty good, but will definitely NOT use the canned crust again.  It doesn't do justice to the pizza!  I'll also be interested in adding some toppings, like bacon!

Tasted great, but I did make two simple changes.  Instead of refrigerated pizza crust I made a homemade crust...yummy.  I also crushed 2 cloves of garlic and added them to the ranch dressing for the sauce.  Very tasty and I will make again.  My 1 year old and 2 1/2 year old loved it, as well as my husband and I.

A creative variation to traditional pizza.  Instead of using the canned crust, we bought the pre-made crust which saved time and it was tasty.

Delicious!!! Husband raves about it. I used Bacon Ranch dressing, added sauted mushrooms, and also substituted half to two-thirds of a drained can of diced tomatoes instead of using fresh tomatoes. Based on another review, I also sprinkled basil liberally over the tomatoes. Made it with Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust from this site. Unbelievable flavor!!

what a great recipe to start from.  I cook BBQ chicken on the grill, then start the dough cooking on one side in the grill.  I flip it, then add the listed ingredients, adding crubled bacon also.  This pizza is amazing!

Delicious. Loved the twist on the sauce with the use of ranch dressing. My husband and I actually favor using Tyson's buffalo wing chicken with a little extra Red Hot sauce rather than just plain chicken. It adds a little extra kick and blends beautifully with the ranch, green onions, tomatoes, and cheese.

I really liked the flavors of this pizza.  The first time that I made it, the pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom, and it had only baked for about twelve minutes of the 20-25 minutes.  The second time, I decreased the temperature to 400 degrees and only baked it about five minutes in the beginning then eleven minutes.  Overall, the flavors are good, but the baking times need to be adjusted.

This one is a toss up.  The day I made it I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, and my hubby thought it was okay..except for the tomatoes.  Do not add the tomatoes!!  The day after with the leftovers I liked it better and my hubby didn't.  I don't think I'll make this one again.  Thank You!

Pretty Good.  Something missing here and warm ranch was nice for a creamy effect but not a big fan, maybe with a tweak it would be just right.  Thanks.

Excellent pizza recipe!  I actually decided to use crumbled bacon instead of the chicken and it was fantastic.  The ranch dressing and fresh tomatoes and green onions really give this a great flavor. Thanks so much for the recipe!

It sounded a lot better than it tasted. I did like the taste of everything else, besides the ranch. I love ranch, but it doesn't taste as good when cooked. Next time I may try adding a different sauce, maybe pizza sauce would taste better.

I made my own pizza crust with some Basil and it really added to the pizza.  There wasn't as much flavor that I care for but still was a very very good pizza.  Thank you for the Recipe.

mmmmm so good, had to make a few changes thought due to lack of ingredients.  I used ceasar dressing instead(all i had) still good.  I sprinkled chopped garlic then followed the rest of the recipe.  oh and i only used chedder(all i had).  i also sprinkled parmasan cheese on top.

Well, there are five of us and 3 out of five like ranch dressing. The 3 of us liked the pizza and my one son suggested to add some onions and bacon next time. The other two ate it and said it was ok. I would make it again and maybe make one with red sauce.

OMG!!! I have found my new favorite recipe!  I'm not sure if I should review this recipe as I made so many changes.  I love Subway's Chx, bacon, ranch sandwich so I adapted this pizza to that.  I used a packaged crust, omitted the tomatoes, and such.  A very good basic recipe that can be changed to individual taste. Thanks so much!!

I made this without the chicken to make it vegetarian for my husband.  I sauteed half a yellow onion and three cloves of garlic in a little olive oil and added to the pizza at the same time as the green onions.  Delicious!

We are not wild about chicken pizza (we're beef eaters) but this pizza sounded so good I had to try it and it was very good~if you like chicken pizza.  I added garlic and also since I had some leftover pesto, I mixed about 3 rounded tablespoons into the ranch dressing.  The combination was very good!  Overall this is a pretty good dish.

The ranch and tomatoes made the crust soggy and the pizza just didn't taste right.  This was the first 5 star recipe that I've tried (of at least 30)that wasn't a hit.  DISAPPOINTING.

Great pizza, I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I would change  would be to add more crust - 10oz did not seem nearly enough, and two of us only ended up having 1 piece of pizza left when we were done with it.

I didn't like this much at all.  I love ranch dressing but thought this was a little overkill.  It sounded very good, but was a disappointment. I threw half of the pizza in the trash.

This pizza was VERy tasty.  I did add soe fresh thyme and basil and I also used swiss cheese becuase that was the only cheese I had in my house. It turned out great.  Next time I make it I will use a swiss, mozzarella cheese mixture and add some greilled red peppers, articoke hearts, and spinach.  They sound like a great touch to this pizza.

I would have to agree with others, the ranch dressing was a bit much.  I am not a fan of the stuff, however my 3 year old, who would eat ranch on everything loved it.

Good, but it needed a little more kick.  I used cajun seasoning when cooking the chicken and used pepper jack cheese instead of the cheddar.

I substitute the chicken with canadian bacon. It was pretty tasty, but not as good as the regular pizza, but it was something new and nice from the regular. Family didnt seem too craze about it. I probably wont make this again, unless upon requests.

Fantastic!!  After I cut up the cooked chicken I let it simmer in a sauce of 2 Tb. butter and several dashes of hot sauce, to give it a "Buffalo Wings" flavor.  Then I just spread the crust with Ranch dressing, sprinkled on Mozzarela cheese, and put the chicken  on along with chopped black olives, green peppers and onions.  Everyone loved it!

Suprisingly, my kids didn't like the ranch dressing.  Maybe it was just the brand I used (light, too).  Any suggestions for a different white saucy base?

Loved this pizza. I doubled the recipe because it sounded so good and only changed it slightly by adding hot sauce to the ranch dressing. My husband and I gladly ate this for dinner two nights in a row plus snacked on it the day after.

This is my favorite pizza recipe! My husband even loves it and he has a gourmet chef as a father, so he can be quite picky. I usually add some hot pepper flakes, some oregano and basil on top of the layer of cheddar cheese. It gives it a bit of a kick. Last night I added some crumbled pieces of turkey bacon and it gave it a really smokey flavor. You can do so much with this recipe! It's a keeper!

I am an amateur cook and this was super easy for me to make. I loved it.  No fancy ingredients and it was very delicious.  I will definitely make it again, only use a thicker crust as I slightly burned the Baboli crust I bought.  Excellent recipe!

Great!! Kids loved it.  My very finicky son even had seconds.  I would use a little bit more than 1/2 cup of ranch dressing turned out a tad dry, but otherwise it was delish!

I had high hopes for this pizza but it was just average and a bit bland.  I even added the salsa to the ranch dressing as a previous reviewer suggested and seasoned the chicken while cooking it.  I prepared 1/2 of the pizza with regular sauce for my kids and it was actually much better.  Sorry.

This was quick, easy and tasty!  I used roasted chicken breast from the deli for more falvor and like some of the others, I used Boboli pizza crust.  I only put the tomato and onion on half so that my five year old would be able to enjoy it  too! That worked out great! Will use this one again.

It's a decent pizza.  Go light on the ranch dressing though.  I would have given this 4 stars, but the ranch seemed to kill the other flavors.

Pretty good.  Next time we will add some wing sauce or something to spice it up a bit.  It was a bit bland, but pretty tasty.  I used a Boboli, a roasted chicken from the deli and some sauteed red onion instead of green.  Maybe that is why I didn't think it was a 5 star recipe.  It was good, though.

This pizza was awesome!  I was a bit nervous to put Ranch Dressing on and wondered how it would taste, but it was incredible!  I had friends over for dinner and everyone raved.  I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks! :)

We replaced all the potentially fatty ingredients with lo-no fat varieties, and it was still excellent.

A few notes, though - the crust needs about half the baking time suggested, and I also found that 1/2 cup was way too much dressing.  However, it's pizza, so it's very easy to play it by ear.

pretty darned good.  I think i would add more dressing, but that is about it.  Also, i followed the directions on the can of dough.  They were different from what was here, which is why I gave it a 4, not a 5.

Yummy!  Easy enough for children to make if chicken is precooked.  I made a double batch of chicken and saved half for another recipe.  I added a smokey BBQ sauce to the cut up chicken before making the pizza.  I also used half the suggested ammounts of cheese and ranch dressing and found that to be plenty.

I can't count how many times I've made this pizza. It's quick and easy and always come out great. I use a pre-baked cruse (Boboli) to save even more time. Then I bake it on a pre-heated pizza stone to make the crust a little crisp on the bottom.

Although we tried the refridgerated pizza dough and found we didn't like it...that is the only thing we didn't like. This recipe is quick and delicious. Everytime we have pizza this recipe is a must even before pepperoni...

This was great!  My husband and I are traditionalists when it comes to pizza but this was a great change.  It was easy to make.  Our young kids didn't like it as well as regular pizza but they ate it which they don't always do.

This was good. My husband liked it a lot - more than I did. I added some steak spice (as previously suggested) to the chicken while cooking it (cut into strips before cooking), which added some flavour. I used 1/4 cup dressing - 1/2 would have been too much for us. I'll make it again; not too often. I might try a different brand of Ranch dressing, or add some sauted peppers & onions. It was good as cold leftovers, too.

This was a great recipe and pretty easy too. I cooked the chicken breast in a little oil and seasoned with a little garlic salt and some mesquite seasoning, which was really good. The ranch made such a good sauce. THe leftovers are really good cold as well. Thanks!

I couldn't decide if this should be rated 4 or 5 stars. I used a homemade crust which was also found on this site (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust) where I added garlic powder which I thought gave the pizza a nice taste. Instead of cooking the chicken in a skillet, I baked it in Tony Roma's Bar-B-Q Sauce. Loved the bbq flavor mixed in! I left out the green onion as a personal preference and only used Mozzarella cheese. Though I think this pizza needs both cheeses. The Ranch Dressing I used was fat-free, so it was really thin. On this pizza I think that the thicker the dressing, the better. Great recipe. I'm making it for the family's New Year's party. Thanks!

I didn't like the green onions. After I picked the onions off this was really good. The ranch was a perfect sauce. I used thin crust bobbli crust. Next time I make this I will use red onions and add bacon.

I did not like this recipe.  I was expecting a "fresh" tasting pizza with the fresh tomatoes and low-fat chicken breast as toppings.  The problem, for me, was the ranch dressing.  The dressing added a layer of flavor that I found very unappealing.  The tangy flavor and creamy, fatty consistency of the dressing fought with the fresh flavors and textures of the pizza toppings.

This is the perfect pizza for those of you who don't like pizza!!!  My son will eat this, and he hates normal tomato sauce pizzas.  Make sure you drain the chopped tomatoes very thorougly, or the pizza will get soggy.  Also, I found I didn't need to bake it the full 20 minutes the second time, more like 10-15 minutes.  This pizza is even great the next day, eaten cold as leftovers (if there is any left!).

doubled the recipe and served it for my boyfriend, sister and her new fiance, and asked for feedback~ hands down five stars from everyone.  used chicken breasts on the bone (a bit more time consuming but i think they have more flavor than boneless and don't dry out as easily~sauteed them in some olive oil and italian spices along with some onions and garlic before chopping).  added sauteed onions to the pizza and it was YUM YUM YUM!  will make on a regular basis and would be great as a party appetizer!  thanks so much!!!

What a great recipe!  I used the bread maker calzone recipe from this website, and used bbqed chicken that had marinated in the crockpot all day.  Topped with cheddar cheese and it was a big hit!  The ranch flavor was a subtle complement to the bbq flavored chicken.  Delish!

This was pretty good for a quick meal. I used to already cooked Louis Rich chicken breasts. Flavor was good but needs some more spice. I opted for tabascco but I think it needs some other spicier topping. Not sure what it could be.

If you use a Boboli crust, you only have to pop everything on top and bake in the oven about 10 minutes!  Fast supper because I cooked the chicken ahead of time.

We loved the basic idea of this.  We had our own pizza crust recipe though, so we had to figure out by trial and error how long to cook.  But boy it's tastey!!

Fantabulicious! I also used a home made pizza crust, although a good frozen one would also do in a pinch. 

I also added roasted garlic, artichoke hearts (sliced), and spinach to the dish. The flavors made a  packed pizza but worked well together.

This recipe is awesome! Such a nice change from normal pizza. It was so easy to do, even though I made a homeade crust. I made 2 pizzas, & gave one to my in-laws, everybody loved it! Will definately make again.

Absolutely delicious!  I sauteed my chicken with garlic, olive oil, small amount of butter, and vidalia onions.  I left off the green onions and cheddar cheese and just used mozzarella and parmesan....EXCELLENT!  This was my husband's favorite pizza recipe by far!

This was very good and very easy.I cheated a little and used a Boboli pizza crust,had chicken breasts already grilled in the fridge.I had seasoned them with cajun seasoning which I think made it a little tastier.This will definitely be on our summer menu list!

This pizza is delicious!  I had to change the recipe, due to not having any mozzarella cheese.  I simply omitted it, and followed the recipe as it was written.  It was still wonderful!!

Spread the Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing too thick (too lazy to measure 1/2 cup, not the recipe's fault) and the dressing tasted too strong and gross in some parts for my taste.  However my husband loved it and I can easily see I would too if I went lighter on the dressing.  Another option would be to use Alfredo, which I will try next time.  

I added mushrooms (canned), George Foreman grilled chicken breasts seasoned with McCormick's Grillmates Montreal Seasoning (which was perfect for this) on Boboli.  Next time will also add spinach or broccoli and try it with thin crust rather than original.

This was great! I cheated and used a prebaked crust from the supermarket, but that only made it easier.  I will definitely make this again. You can almost use any veggies with it.

This was pretty good. I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars, had I been allowed. My boyfriend and I both agreed that it is not something that we could eat on a regular basis, but it was nice for a variety to the regular pizza.

Wish I could rate this one a perfect 10!!  I made two in order to feed us all.  On one I was more generous with the ranch dressing, and it was by far the better pizza.  I also sauteed mushrooms and onions in garlic and sprinkled that over both. Hubby wants green pepper and olives on next time - cant' wait! This was the best pizza I've ever tasted, thanks!

My husband was VERY skeptical about trying a pizza with no tomato sauce and chicken instead of pepperoni...He and my 4 year old are very picky eaters, but they tried this and ended up loving it!  I didn't change much about the recipe, except I used 2 prebaked pizza shells, since I don't care for the refrigerated dough, and doubled the recipe for leftovers. I cooked the chicken with some Morton's Nature Seasons and a couple cloves of minced garlic. This pizza was filling and delicious!

This was sooooo good! My boyfriend doesn't like ranch so I used alfredo sause and it tasted great. I cooked the chicken with garlic salt, salt and pepper. I also minced real garlic and cooked bacon and put it on after it was cooked. Yummm.... he wants me to make it again tonight. Hahaha!

I used my own bread machine pizza dough and I thought this was great.  Although without changing the recipe, we felt it needed an extra kick of flavour.  Next time, I'll try adding garlic and fresh basil.

This pizza is wonderful!  I have recently made several different gourmet pizzas for my husband, and this is by far his favorite!  I used Kraft three-cheese ranch dressing for an extra kick, and I know there are many other varieties of ranch that would be wonderful with this.

This was so delicious!  Even my 17 yr. old son said, "whoa, this is really good!"  He's very picky about any pizza that isn't a ham and pineapple one.  Used a homemade crust (from this website).  Will definitely make this again!

Excellent chicken pizza.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe a lot.  We ate it right out of the oven and it was a little runny.  Will probably let it set for 10 minutes or so the next time we make this recipe. - and we will.  It really was delicious.

This is really really easy to make and tastes really good. I used Italian Herb Bread recipe for the crust and Ranch Dressing II recipe - the combination was astounding! A definite keeper!

What a great non-traditional pizza!  I only gave it 4 stars for "kid friendly" because my little one would rather eat the "delivered" traditional pepperoni pizza.  He did like it, though.  It opens new doors for ideas...broccoli, artichoke hearts....you will really like this one.

Excellent!!  I used a prepared pizza dough instead of the refridgerated can dough and I used a bit more ranch & both cheeses.  I am passing this one on to my friends & it's a definate keeper!!

The best nontraditional pizza recipe I've tried.  I use my own semolina crust, which adds time but is really worth the hassle.

My family loved it.  I added red onions, garlic and mushrooms to this recipe.  I didn't have regular Ranch dressing but used Cesaer Ranch instead and it tasted wonderful.  This would also make a great Gourmet Vegi Pizza with artichoke hearts!

I made this recipe following exactly how it was submitted and was not a fan at all. If I made it again I would use homemade pizza dough and a different dressing - I like the caesar dressing idea. My husband just ate it because he was really hungry

This is such a great recipe, I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, deboned it and chopped up the chicken, made it even easier and the chicken had a great flavor.

I thought this lacked some flavor.  It is worth experimenting with, however, I would add chopped fresh herbs, perhaps Feta instead of Cheddar for more flavor, etc.  It has potential!

This made a fabulous, unusual restauraunt-style pizza for me and my sister. It WAS a bit heavy, but worth it. I used ready-made crust and piled on the topings with some mushrooms added.

I used monterey jack cheese instead of mozzarella and it came out great.  I also used refrigerated pizza dough from a can, which I wasn't crazy about (it tastes a lot like biscuits from a can).  Overall is was great, but next time I will try another dough.

This pizza was okay, but not fantastic.  Although the flavor was pretty good, I thought that the ranch dressing made the crust soggy and tough.

This is a great recipe!  Instead of fresh chicken, I used a large can of chicken breast.  I also added some tomato basil flavored feta cheese right before the cheddar cheese.  Easy and delicious!

Excellent pizza!  I served this for company and everyone loved it.  I wasn't sure about the Ranch dressing, but next time, I think I'll use a little more.  I used my own homemade pizza dough instead of store-bought, and it was a winner.
