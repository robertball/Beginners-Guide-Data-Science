This was a good pie to make, I went a little different with it,I didn't have any molasses or couldn't find any so I used dark waffle syrup. Was told couldn't find any difference, also didn't have a lemon to peel so I didn't use that but I was told the pie was great! I called my mother over to try out the pie for me ( yeah, I made the pie but don't eat pecan pies, I made it for church ). I saw the corners of her mouth come up and she said 'Oh, it's so bad! You just might as well leave this with me'. I knew she was lying through her teeth. So enjoy making this, just don't ask your mother to taste it for you.

The lemon peel ruins it.  It doesn't taste anything like Pecan Pie.
