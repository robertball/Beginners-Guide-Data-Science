2.18.16   The ratio of fruit to the oatmeal mixture seems disproportionate at least for me for this amount of oatmeal...I cut the amount of fruit about in half.  As the recipe author states, youâ€™ll need to adjust the amount of kefir to oatmeal to suit your own preference.  In my case, I ended up adding quite a bit more kefir.  I did use vanilla kefir (what I had on hand), and I think it only enhanced the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe John Tobin.  This was very good and a treat for breakfast today.

I swapped out raisins instead of the strawberries (they're not in season yet), and added in a tablespoon of flaxseed.  Through my experiments with soaking oats overnight, I've found that when using a thicker "liquid" (in this case, kefir), you need at LEAST a 1 to 1 ratio, if not more.  Using less, it will be very thick and solid.  I always end up adding a bit more water in the morning as well.  Great combo though, I often soak in almond milk or yogurt, but the kefir was great!  I used vanilla flavored so didn't need any honey.  Maple syrup would be fantastic too, in place of the honey!
