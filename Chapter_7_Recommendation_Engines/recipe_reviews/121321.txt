Really delicious - doesn't even need the bacon and cheddar.  I substituted fat-free evaporated milk for the whipping cream.  I also decreased the amount of chicken broth by one cup to make it thicker.  It important to really whisk the flour with the milk well before adding to the hot soup slowly while stirring.

Really great... even better if you puree the veggies after the 15 minute simmer. Also a fresh bread crouton on top is a must

Used 1 1/2 c evap, skim milk for cream and milk. I left the skins on the potato for nutrition.  I added chicken cubes and some garlic.  Excellent.  Next time I will try it with broccoli.

I added 2 cloves of garlic and used chicken stock instead of water and buillion. I also ended uo putting a lot of pepper in this soup to eat it. Next time I will use more salt and more asparagus. I might put some bacon directly in the soup also. It was good though.

I made this sans onion & bacon (personal preference & I didn't have any!) since I had some fresh asparagus & potatoes on hand.  I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, skim milk, and topped with 2% shredded sharp cheddar.  It got rave reviews from my very picky husband and my almost 3 year old daughter.  I thought it was delicious (and healthy!) as well.  Definitely a keeper in our house!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Very good.......in my opinion, the bacon and cheese really elevate this very mild soup. I did add some garlic powder.

I left out the celery since I didn't seem to have any. I also cooked the asparagus separately and added it at the end. Very tasty recipe!

Made this tonight - my first time making soup EVER and it was a HIT!!!! My boyfriend loved it, as did I! I added garlic, and used condensed milk instead of whipping cream and it turned out beautifully. Pretty thick, if you want it more like a soup vs. chowder I would add another cup water. People here have used chicken broth vs. bouillon but I went with the bouillon and it was wonderful! It's Wednesday evening and my boyfriend was already requesting I make this again on Saturday! Says it would be perfect post-leave-racking food! Oh! And went with the cheddar cheese and bacon, a must! Added some chopped scallions and croutons too!

This was absolutely delicious comfort food, perfect for a cold day.  As my husband said, "it has all of my favorite foods-bacon, cheese, and asparagus".  Of course, it is also kind of a heart attack in a bowl, but totally worth indulging once in a while!

Very yummy recipe!  I did take the advise of one of the other reviews and pureed the veggies before adding the cream mixture.  Very easy to make & everyone loved it!  Will definately make this again!

I made this soup for a luncheon at the office and it was a hit. I've promised to make it again for the next event. It's the recipe, not my cooking skills  that made it so good. Very easy to make and very delicious.

I followed the directions exactly and came out with a very bland soup. It was very creamy though which is the reason it got any stars at all!! I won't be making this soup again.

This was really tasty. I basically used all the ingredients from this recipe, but altered the prep a bit. For instance, I sauteed the asparagus (not sure exactly how much I had - I started with a huge bunch from Sam's that I had already taken from once), onion and celery in 5.5 TBS of butter. I just think sauteed veggies taste better.

At first, I had set the tips aside as suggested on another recipe for garnish at the end, then just decided to throw them all in. I think next time I'll saute them for a few, then set them aside to top individual bowls. 

Anyway, after cooking veggies til tender, I used my stick blender to cream it all. Then I added the flour, milk and cream mixture. As I was pouring it in, I thought I probably didn't need to do this as the blending made it pretty thick on its own, but I was already committed. You could probably skip it without doing any damage. Wound up adding more pepper to my bowl and a couple of splashes of Tabasco, ate it with some fresh, buttered French bread and it was heavenly. Bacon and cheese are always good adds. Wish I had remembered to add a little garlic per other reviews, but it was still pretty darned tasty.

I made this soup in the crock pot.  I used 1 lb of asparagus and four cups of veggie broth instead of the bullion and water.  I also used 1 cup of fat free 1/2 and 1/2 with 3/4 cups milk and added the cheese in instead of using it as garnish.  This turned out very creamy and delicious.  The trick is not to put the 1/2 and 1/2 and milk mixture in until after the veggies are cooked (about 5 to 6 hours on high).  Then add milk mixture and let cook on low for about 30 minutes.  Add the cheese just before serving.

I followed this recipe to the "t" and it turned out superb.  Just make sure to pick up a french roll at the market for dipping.

This was a great soup! I made a few changes, though. I used 3 cups of potatoes and added the salt to the vegetables while simmering. I used fat-free half-and-half and 3/4 cup of 1% milk. I also cut the butter to 1 1/2 tbsp. I pureed the veggies before adding the cream mix and added a pinch of white pepper. I also added 3/4 cup of cheese to the soup. My wife loved and she hates asparagus. I also garnished with only a few crumbled bits of bacon on each bowl.

I made this Soup late one night, after finding I needed lunch for my boy in the morning. I first cooked the bacon in the pan for the soup, and sauteed the onion (and some garlic) in 1/2 of the grease from 5 strips of bacon. I then followed the recipe with a couple more changes. I Halved the butter, and omitted the cream. And added homemade chicken stock and chicken. It was so delish! My boys want it again, and my neighbor too!

I had a vegetarian friend over for dinner, so I didn't use the bacon or chicken boullion cubes.  I used vegetable stock instead of water for added flavor.  I thought it was a bit runny, so I added some shredded potatoes to thicken it up a bit.  Overall this was very good & I'll definitely make it with the bacon!!

Yummm! I added a little "hickory smoke" flavor to this since I didn't have any bacon. I also added some garlic powder. ;)

Perfect just the way it is. So easy. My family loved it. I did put all the bacon directly in the soup and just used the cheese for the garnish. Will make again.

Went over well with the whole picky family.  I forgot the bacon and was chided for it by my pork-loving family, which it needs if you use the "full-fat" version. A great way to get more veggies into the kids (and husbands)!  Tasted it before adding the milk/flour mixture, and tasted good without it. Maybe chill a sans milk/flour variation for summer soup?

I made this for my husband over the weekend, he absolutely loved it, the only thing I changed was, I didn't have the whipping cream so I used more milk(2 cups). Nice and creamy
Thanks for sharing

My husband loved this!   I used chicken broth instead of water and as one reviewer suggested, I pureed some of it before adding the milk mixture, but I left some chunks for substance.  I used white pepper and added a little tarragon.  
Instead of bacon, I added diced ham at the end and left off the cheese.  Delicious!

Potatoes, asparagus and celery were all on sale, so I was looking for a recipe that used them all. This recipe is so economical yet tastes like a million dollars!  I'll be living high on the hog this week.  I sub'ed buttermilk and a dollop of heavy cream for the milk and whipping cream, increased the size of the recipe by 50% because I was cooking to put some aside for further meals. I pureed it, and added very crispy crumbled bacon: garnished it with scallions, asparagus tips and cheddar.  Holy cow!

Absolutely delicious!  Husband stated, as another reviewer did, that it was like a soup you'd get at a restaurant.  Only changes I made were to use chicken broth & water (skipping the chicken bouillon,) used 2% milk & I cut the butter down to 3 tablespoons.  Will definitely make again soon!

Excellent and easy to make soup. A must for my recipe box. I didn't have bacon so I added diced ham instead. Some croutons will make a nice addition to this recipe.

OMG this is so good! I doubled the recipe. Did everything as written only I used less bacon and I didnt have the full amount of whipping cream so i had to replace some with milk. It did not hinder it at all, it was still delicious. Someone said to puree the vegis but we love asparagus so we used big chunks. I used 9 bouillon cube instead of powder because it was all i had. (because i doubled the recipe) YUMMY! Thanks.

This was excellent. I used condensed milk in place of cream and mashed it all together a little after adding the milk/flour mixture. I added some frozen peas at the end and a lot of pepper. I omitted the bacon, grated some fresh parmesan on top, and used two large vegetable bouillon cubes rather than chicken. Delicious!
