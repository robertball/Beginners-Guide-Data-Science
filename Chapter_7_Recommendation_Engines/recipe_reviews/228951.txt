I can't believe I just made marshmallows.  These are sweet billowy clouds of puffy goodness!  Unlike any store-bought marshmallow I've ever had, these tasted delicate and were softer.  My kids think I'm a superstar!  Be sure to grease the pan very well or the mixture will stick--this makes it more difficult to remove from the pan when they're dry enough.  Since I made bones for Halloween, I dipped my cutter into the powdered sugar/Argo cornstarch mixture before making each cut, pressed down hard, and wiggled slightly to ensure it went all the way through.  These are truly a delight--yumm!!!

I thought these were neat to make. They were kind of fun too. I didn't have any major problems. I greased the pan with pan spray and wiped out the excess and had no sticking. I read the reviews and went heavy on the powdered sugar to make cutting easy also. I even spread some all over the top and continuously while cutting the marshmallow with cookie cutters or into square ones with a knife. Do also coat the cutters and knife well with the powdered sugar too. Before cutting, I cooled them on the counter for about 7-8 hours with plastic wrap over the top of the pan. I can't imagine doing this without a stand mixer. It made it super easy. A very reliable thermometer is also neccessary. With the right tools, it is nearly fool proof. I thought they tasted kind of like a bagged marshmallows, but so much better with the soft fluffy texture. To top, they were excellent in homemade cocoa.

Try these and you'll never buy marshmallows in a bag at the grocery store again.  For several years, I've made homemade marshmallows from a different recipe.  I tried this one, it is the winner.  These marshmallows are fluffy and delicious.  The texture and flavor are heavenly.  I followed the instructions exactly as written, and I could not be more pleased with the result.  Here are a few tips I've learned over the years:  after buttering your pan, sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar.  I turn out the entire pan of dried, uncut marshmallows onto cutting board dusted with powdered sugar.  Then, I use a large pizza cutting wheel to cut the marshmallows into squares.  The blade will need to be dusted often with powdered sugar.  I use powdered sugar sparingly if I'll be dipping the cut marshmallows into melted chocolate.  I have also used finely chopped toasted coconut as a coating instead of powdered sugar for an old-fashioned treat.  One last tip, I use the wire whip beater on the Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  I think that contributes to the fluffy, light texture.

Made 3 versions of this for Halloween.  Purple-cherry, green-banana, and orange-coconut.  Wanted to "Trick" people with this "Treat" by making the colors not match the flavors.  I goofed the recipe once by trying to use flavored gelatin instead of unflavored - not a good idea.  In the end I used flavored extracts for the flavors I wanted.  Had to make 4 batches to get 3 good ones, but not the recipe's fault,just me trying to be a smartie pants, lol.  This is a delicious recipe, but a little more complicated than it's worth.  I don't think I'll make it again.

Who knew marshmallows would be so easy to make? These are tasty and have a great texture. I cut them into pumpkin shapes. It took me a minute to figure out the best way to get the cut shapes out of the marshmallow sheet. I found that if I used a metal spatula to pry a section of the marshmallow up before cutting the shapes they just popped right out. And tons of powdered sugar on your cutters is a definite must. My kids think I'm Super Mom because I made homemade marshmallows!

These were delicious!  And so much more delicate than store-bought marshmallows.  The key to not losing your mind when cutting these is powdered sugar- lots and lots of powdered sugar.  Before cutting the marshmallows, coat the whole block with powdered sugar.  Before cutting, coat the knife with powdered sugar and reapply any time the knife starts to stick.  Any extra sugar can easily be shaken off of the finished product.

Pretty easy.  Taste good, not sure if worth the work vs. just buying--they are definately creamier, and better but not sure if worth the work.

But then I dipped in chocolate--YUM!!!!!!!!

You would have thought I would be such a pro at making various recipes...but this recipe honestly had me by the goat for quite some time. I've always been tempted to make homemade marshmallows but feared with over boiling(even with a candy therometer). I have to say, it was a rather funny mess with this recipe, that made me realize...what was I thinking being frighten by this recipe. Now, that I've experienced it...I will soo be making this again. Light and fluffy and really easy to do, so long as you prep and stage your recipe in the steps for proper marshmallow making. And even though I was a mess, the recipe was quite tasty and just really fabulous. Experimenting of the extracts in the future for all sorts of holiday plans are in order. TY I no longer fear this awesome recipe.

I don't care for marshmallows, so my review is based on my kids' reactions.  In the morning, when I first told them I was making marshmallows that day, they didn't believe me.  Then, when I presented them with the finished product floating in a cup of hot cocoa that evening, they said I was the awesome-est cook around.  That compliment alone warrants giving this recipe five stars :)

I was intimidated by homemade marshmallows for years, not anymore.  These are perfect and not overly sweet.  I can't wait to make them in peppermint flavor to give out at Christmas time.

I loved trying to make my own marshmallows!  They are delicious--much better than store-bought!  The only thing I didn't like was the mess I had from making it.  I must admit that I made only half a batch, so my Kitchen Aid didn't do a very good job of mixing it up, so I'd recommend making the full batch.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if I end up making these again at Christmas time for my granddaughters' hot chocolate! I'm glad I tried these!

This is a great recipe! The only exception is that it is NOT 3 - 1oz packets... just 3 - 1/4 oz packets. I also go heavy on the imitation vanilla, unless it is true vanilla you're not going to get much flavor. I doubled or tripled the vanilla.

These are very very tasty, but I didn't have a strong stand mixer.. just a cheapie stand mixer. I couldn't get this to 8 minutes of beating time without my mixer exploding.. so unless you have something powerful like a kitchen Aid - this may not be a good idea. I got some cute Halloween ice cube molds and though these would be neat in them. Problem - pain in the behind getting the marshmallow fluff in the holes and then later, getting the formed things OUT without mangling them. I put some on a loaf pan and those were easy, so don't use molds unless you feel like making a HUGE mess!  I am not marking these recipe down because these were my issues, not the recipes...I won't ever make marshmallows again. at least not until I can afford a KA and then  NOT in molds!

I believe there is an error in the recipe. I compared it to the one I actually made. it calls for 3 (0.25 oz) packages of gelatin, not 3 (1 oz) packages. We loved these with that change!

So easy, my boys love them (duh!) we cut them out into fun shapes for different events/seasons w greased metal cookie cutters, add colors while still hot, gels are most vibrant and don’t fade in the heat if it, , corresponding flavors and gift them to everyone, often around Christmas w hot cocoa mix. My best tip: scrape vanilla pods yourself (I use Madagascar) elevates the taste and makes it Artis all or rustic looking, great for gifts!! We gift w hot cocoa mix (our if a canister, nothing special) but we boost the store bought powder w flavors that relate to the flavored marshmallows, like add cinnamon or extra cocoa powder or cayenne pepper or peppermint - we have dipped one side in colored sparkle sugar, can dip in toasted coconut… so many variations w this easy, adaptable recipe!

The flavor was great. I gave it 5-stars because I'll be making these again. However, I interpreted the 3 (1 ounce) unflavored gelatin as 3 ounces. Since my packages were not 1 ounce, I weighed 3 ounces out. Yowza! After looking around the internet all other recipes said 3 packages, not 3 ounces. I had a huge mess. I finally got all the marshmallow out of my Kitchen Aid. I agree with another person that said that it really needs the power of a KA. I can clearly see that it will work out beautifully with the proper amount of gelatin. I wanted to make these because I needed marshmallow stars for a recipe I'm making.

While I give the texture and ease of making this recipe 5 stars,  I did not like the flavor and neither did my marshmallow loving 3year old.  I personally think the flavoring needs to be increased by another 2 tsps.  I am going to try it again with the additional flavoring  as suggested in another recipe and see how it turns out!  They were much easier to work with than expected which was a plus!  Made some really cute hearts I plan to see if they taste better dipped in chocolate.

I made this and it came out so thick and sticky I had to run it under hot water for an hour to get it out. In all fairness I think I did something wrong. You have to be very exact.

Made these tonight to see how they differ from my usual homemade marshmallow recipe. While these have good texture and flavor, I prefer my other recipe. It uses the same ingredients with different ratios. It's not as sticky and pours better.
