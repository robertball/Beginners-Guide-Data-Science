I made this per instructions, recipe. My husband loved them. Said not to change anything about them. I did use vegetable oil. Was out of olive oil. Thank you!

This is more or less how I've always made them all through the years minus the panko and I've gotta say that the panko was a HUGE bonus. It brought the crispness to a whole new level. Loved it! Looks like I need to re-think the way I have always breaded my tomatoes with next years crop. My tip to you is that you should really invest in a fry daddy if you plan on deep frying anything. Not only do they save time but they save a ton of money in the long run.

I really liked this recipe.  Nice and crunchy.  The panko crumbs are a plus.
