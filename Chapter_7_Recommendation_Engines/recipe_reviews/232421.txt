Turkey wings are great in the crock pot.  Skip the flavored rice.
Use only two cups of water in the crock pot so the wings are not boiled.  If you want to serve the wings with rice, cook it according to package directions on top of the stove or in a rice cooker.

I've been making this dish for years using this exact recipe. It is convenient and tastes great. Thanks for posting. (BTW, using whole turkey wings for stock is a waste of perfectly good meat. Stock can be made using the wing tips.)

I didn't care for this recipe. It was mushy, slimy, and bland.  I will stick to using my wings for stock.

If its too mushy it's because you let the rice cook too long. My family loved it.

I took the advice of Jim and left the rice out and cooked on the stove. I also added one can of cream of celery along with the cream of mushroom. One pack of Turkey gravy and just enough water to cover the bottom. Came out great!!

Great recipe just needs a few modifications. 1. DO NOT put that rice in the crockpot . I wish i had listened when I read that in the reviews. the rice will absorb all the gravy and become a mushy mess. Alternatively if you want rice with your dish I suggest you prepare it separately then use the gravy to pour over the rice. I also started by coating the wings in flour and browning them a bit in some oil before adding them to my pre heated crockpot. Turned out amazing FELL OFF THE BONES :)
