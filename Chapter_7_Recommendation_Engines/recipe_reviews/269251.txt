I had never had this type of onion and wasn't sure I was even going to be able to find them in my area. Whole Foods to the rescue! What a delicious treat! I was even more tickled to find they had them in both colors not that I could taste a difference but it made the dish pretty. These are very mild onions and the sauce complimented them perfectly. I recommend adding these to your dinner table this holiday season.
