The secret is to freeze the chocolate chips for at least an hour before using.  This helps them stay intact.  :)

Tastes great but the chocolate chips melt so you really have to add them at the last second and not stir too much.

So simple and very few dirty dishes. I used my rolling pin and rolled them out thin and used a cookie cutter to make cute shapes. Fun and very tasty.

These were a great treat.  We made these for an afternoon snack.  We added half a cup of chocolate chips with the cereal and we also added half a cup of M&M's later.  The chocolate chips melted all over the cereal and that is just the way that we wanted it.  It was a big chocolate mess, but oh so good.  Thank goodness we had baby wipes on hand for damage control.

Super QUICK & EASY!!!... I put the marshmellows and butter in a LARGE OXO mixing bowl and placed in the microwave for 1 minute.  Then I stirred the mixture and added the vanilla.  Next I added the rice krispies.  Then I added a small amount of mini semi sweet chocolate chips.  I sprayed the bottom of the 9x13 pan with PAM. Then placed the rice krispy mixture in the pan.  Sprinkled more mini chocolate chips on top.  Then I sprayed my hands with PAM and pressed the rice krispy mixture down into the pan.  Refigerated for an hour.  EASY!

THE BEST EVER!!! they were so easy to make. i just put the butter and marshmellows in the pan at the same time in stead of melting the butter and then adding the marshmellows, it sped up the prosses a little. and i definitely recommend the vanilla extract.

My kids LOVE this. I frequently change the toppings to make this new each time. Butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, baby m&m's, etc..  I put the batch into the pan, then just before getting it smooth, I sprinkle the toppings on and then roll the bars flat with a hand roller, pressing the chips into the bars. No melting and yet they look great.

I'm not a big fan of rice krispie treats, but my husband is so I made these for him. I added the chocolate chips and the cereal at the same time. That way all the chips melted so every bite was chocolately. If you don't want the chips melted, I would sprinkle them on top after you've pressed the rest of the mixture into the pan. Then you can press the chips in the mixture a little. They'll all be on the top, but they won't melt as much. I also used a heart shaped cookie cutter to cut them out since I was making them for my husband.

These cannot be beat!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added the chocolate chips on top so they would not melt as much.  YUM!

This recipe is wonderful.  I took the advice of others and waited until the last minute to put in chocolate chips.  I did use the vanilla and I will always use it now.  I did add a few extra krispies to make it a thicker snack!  Thanks for a great recipe:)
