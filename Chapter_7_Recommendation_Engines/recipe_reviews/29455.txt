This is great.  I used olive oil instead of butter. I wanted to try to bake this, so I put the salmon in a glass baking dish skin down, poked holes in the salmon, poured the marinade over it, and then covered it with foil.  I let the salmon sit at room temp. for 30 minutes.  I then baked it at 375 for 20 minutes and it turned out perfectly!  The marinade is really good, it was tangy and slightly sweet but not overpowering.  I will make again.  thanks for the recipe!

This was a really good recipe.  I used olive oil instead of butter, and grilled my salmon for about 5 minutes on my George Foreman grill.  I will for sure make this often.

Thank you Hilda for this fabulous recipe. What a flavorful marinade.  My salmon never tasted so moist and delicious.  Definitely a recipe I'd use on even the most finicky fish eaters. So easy to put together - I marinaded all day for the extra flavor.  Try this receipe.  You won't be sorry.

This is absolutely wonderful!!!  everybody loved it!!!  It was the best salmon we've ever had(eating out or in).  I substituted olive oil for the butter and used reduced sodium soy sauce for the soy.  I will make it a staple in our house!!!

A great asian-inspired marinade for salmon.  I did add a clove of minced garlic to the original ingredients, fearing it might have been too sweet otherwise; also cut the amount of butter in half.  Turned out perfect!

This was very good. It started sleeting right when we were going to put it on the grill, so we ended up baking it in the oven for 20 minutes. It turned out great. We will make it again.

Delicious and very easy!  What a nice way to enhance an already tasty fish.  I cooked mine by placing on a piece of aluminum foil on the grill and it was excellent.  I shared this recipe with my coworkers and they loved it too.

I replaced the butter with a Tablespoon of olive oil and used my large George Foreman grill on 400 degrees. Even my kids liked it, and they don't like fish. I added some garlic and cayenne right before grilling, as I like it spicy. yum!

Great marinade/sauce!  We don't have a grill, so I placed the salmon skin side down in a dish, made several slices in the top, and poured the sauce over it.  Then I covered the dish with foil, let it marinate for about 30 minutes, and then cooked it (still covered with foil) at 350 F. After that, I broiled for about 5 minutes uncovered to give it a golden/crispy hue on the outside.  With green beans (see Green Beans with Hazelnuts and Lemon Zest recipe) and brown rice, it was a delicious and very healthy meal!

This was excellent.  This is probably the best salmon recipe that I ever had.  The taste is great and the marinade is easy to make.

I now know why salmon is considered a super food, as this was just SUPER! The salmon just needed a little bit more seasoning,an easy fix.I also marinated it about 3 hours. My husband was doing a happy dance while eating this.I guess he  was doing the Salmon Tango! Thanks for the wonderful recipe and by-product entertainment!

Maybe the salmon was bad, but this was inedible! I don't recommend it at all--sorry.

Very good. Added garlic and ginger after reading previous reviews. Broiled it in the oven instead of cooking it on the outdoor grill. Turned out great. Will be making again.

This was great!  Fabulous even.  The hubby and I totally loved it.  I didn't have any white wine and it tasted wonderful without it.  I will be making this again, possibly next week, and I will be adding some minced garlic to it and maybe some pepper. Thank you for sharing!

This is THE BEST recipe I have ever tried from this website!
I hate butter, so I used olive oil, but all other ingredients stayed the same. 
I went to use my grill and oops, no gas! So I baked it in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes (took a bit longer than other reviewers because I had a thick piece).
Will make this again in a heartbeat! My EXTREMELY picky 11 year old ate the whole piece! That in itself makes me thrilled!

This came out so so good. My husband is RAVING as we speak! :) 

I didn't grill it, but instead baked at 450 for about 20-25 minutes. Turn fans on because the sugar in the marinade smokes. 
I used olive oil instead of butter, and added garlic powder, chili powder, and a touch of crushed red pepper. 

I served it with rice and roasted acorn squash. I doubled the marinade because it was awesome with the roasted squash as well. 

I will make this again very soon :)

This recipe is delicious. Not only did I put it on the salmon, I also put it on the vegtable skewers we grilled. After the grilling, we also drizzled it over the salmon and veggies. I recommend adding some red pepper flakes to give it a bit of a kick. I also added some fresh basil and rosemary.

I made this with Lemon Green Beans with Walnuts and a box of Near East Toasted Pine Nut Couscous.  It was a completely delightful meal, very simple, very healthy, and all the flavors complimented each other beautifully.  I was a little skeptical about the marinade because when it is first mixed, the wine overpowers the other ingredients, but I didn't change a thing and it was fabulous.

The marinade ended up being fairly mild. The salmon still shined through.

This was fantastic! I'm very particular regarding salmon recipes. This has to be the best I've ever had! I used lime juice instead of lemon because it was just what I had. I also baked mine according to another reviewer. My apartment complex won't allow grills. I had to share with my neighbors to brag on how well it tasted. They loved it too. I've shared this recipe with everyone possible. SO GOOD!

WOW! this recipe is amazing. My husband and I always try new salmon recipes but this one is a keeper! we didnt have white wine but we didnt miss it! We added lots of garlic and a whole lemon and marinaded it in the early afternoon before we went to the beach. when we came home and grilled it at around 7pm it was so flavorful. If your looking for a great salmon ( or even chicken! ) marinade look no further!

I think the real trick to this recipe is marinading it for a long time.  I usually marinade it all day if not overnight.  My husband is not a huge salmon fan but the longer I have marinaded it, the more he likes it.

Great recipe and so easy to make!  I didn't have white wine and made it with red cooking wine and it tasted great!!  This is also fine to bake/broil in the oven.  Enjoy!

I really liked the flavor of this, but it needs to marinate longer, or use thin fillets so the flavor penetrates. Very good flavor tho!

The marinade is delicious, even without the wine. I baked it, so I could pour the extra (cooked) marinade over rice.

Excellent salmon recipe!  We marinated the salmon for just over an hour and next time I would even do it for longer.  We followed the recipe as given and were not dissapointed at all!  Can't wait to have it again!

This was fantastic! I made as written except for using rice wine vinegar in place of white wine (as I was out) and cooking under the broiler as it was pouring rain. The salmon was sweet and tangy and perfect even for small children. A very simple recipe for a busy Mom.  Thank you!

I don't eat a lot of Salmon but my Fiance and I really enjoyed this the other night.  I added 3 tablespoons of white wine and loved it.   The Salmon was moist and delicious.

This was okay, not alot of flavor, I prefer the Baked Dijon Salmon from this site. Probably won't make this again.

I found this bland even though I added ginger, garlic and some red pepper flakes.  The butter to acid ratio is off and 1 tablespoon of soy is not enough salt flavor.  Sorry.  I won't make this again.

I also baked mine at 375 for 20 min.  It was a little over done but the sauce tasted great.  I used apple juice instead of white wine.  We like this.  The left over salmon tasted great on salad. Thanks.

I loved this recipe! It is so easy and uses ingredients that I always have on hand. A definite keeper! By the way, I used trout instead of salmon and it was just as tasty.

It's a keeper! This was pretty good, just a little bit dry, but I don't think it had anything to do with the recipe.. I marinaded it for about 5 hours in the sauce, but I forgot to keep some for basting.. Still tasted great. Try it! You won't be disappointed!

This was a very good and tasty salmon recipe; my husband gave it his "company good" seal of approval. I only had dry rose wine, which added an interesting flavour, and I also  added some olive oil to the reserved marinade before use to thin out the sauce.

This was awesome on my salmon.  I then tried it on some Mackeral we got in Mexico that I had in the freezer.  It was really good. My DH loved it too. On April 29 I tried this with Pork chops and put them on the grill. It was great

Awesome recipe.  This is one of those good salmon recipes that will win over those people that swear they hate salmon.  I did a couple things differently, only because I didn't have soy sauce and was out of white wine at the time.  I used worchestershire instead of soy sauce and sherry instead of white wine, and baked it.  It still came out fantastic.  It tasted like candy.  Thanks for this excellent recipe, Mom requested it 2 nights in a row!

It was excellent!  I marinated it for more than 24 hrs and baked it for 20 minutes in the oven (400 degrees F).  I understand some people said that they couldn’t taste it or needed to spice up more.  This flavor is not as strong as teriyaki sauce or BBQ sauce.  It’s very delicate.  I enjoyed it very much because I just only had this salmon (I was really not hungry at that time) so I was able to taste it.  Maybe it’s better to have this with not so strong flavored side dishes?  Anyway, it's a five star recipe for me.  Thank you for sharing.

This was good.  I would omit the butter as it just congealed in the refrigerator and served no purpose as far as I'm concerned.  I added a little more soy sauce and marinated much longer than required by the recipe.

This recipe was okay.  I expected a little more taste after marinating it for over an hour. It did taste good, but I could have used a bottle marinade and thought the same thing....its ok.

Delicious recipe and easy to make. The only problem was after putting it in the fridge for half an hour, the butter solidified, so I left it on the countertop for the remaining 30 min. I'd make it again for sure.

DELICIOUS! I used olive oil in place of butter. We grilled it on foil first and then directly on the grill for another minute on each side to get that "grill" flavor onto it. This came out so tasty and juicy. This might be my new fave salmon recipe! Thanks for sharing. Will definitely be making this again.

Delicious.  I didn't change anything about the ingredients. We broiled the fish and it was really good.

I wasn't really impressed with this recipe.  There are many better recipes for salmon on this website.  I won't be making this one again.  Sorry.

I felt this didn't add much of any flavor to the salmon. I used wild Alaskan coho. I might consider using this on farmed salmon to see if the flavor saturates the fish more.

A yummy change from the usual lemon pepper. I think you have to love salmon to appreciate
the flavour though. But if this fish is one of your favourites give this recipe a go!

Excellent! Salmon is not my favorite fish, but we were able to get the Copper River Salmon. I marinated it for 5 hours and barbecued it on a cedar plank. Even I took seconds... and some of my 7 guests took thirds.

Used 2 TB olive oil in place of the butter.  This was pretty good but not nearly as great as the Delicious Salmon recipe from this site.

This was amazing!  I did make a few small changes to make the marinade a tad bit healthier.   Instead of butter I used 1/4 c. olive oil.  I also used 1/4 c. of honey instead of brown sugar.  To cook, I broiled at 500 degrees for about 5 minutes on each side.  D'lish!

This was wonderful! I added a little bit of garlic to it, and marinated my fish for about 2 hours. I ended up baking it at 375 for about 25 minutes until the fish flaked nicely. I will definitely make this again!

Just had this tonight, and it was really good.  The kids loved it too and would like to have it again.  The sweetness made it special.  I took a cue from someone else and cooked it on foil on the grill.

I really liked the sweet flavor of the marinade, and I basted the salmon several times during grilling. I added minced garlic to the marinade. Will probably make this again.

Super-Yum!  I baked it in the oven, but I know it would have been awesome on the grill.  What a quick meal with steamed veggies from the microwave and some brown rice.  If you often find teriyaki marinade a little sweet, try this!  The balance of flavors was lovely on fish!

This was light and a great way to do salmon.  Didn't take away from the salmon.  I BBQ on a piece of tinfoil and it was terrific.

Great. I didn't go by exact measurements, and I subbed olive oil for the butter- and it's still delicious.  The salmon was a little fishy, but by no fault of the recipe.  I'm making tilapia with this marinade tonight and I subbed maple syrup for the brown sugar (just for simplicity- didn't want to wait for the sugar to dissolve- in a big hurry tonight!).  My husband loves this recipe too.  A keeper!

I only rated this a 3 because I couldn't tell if the sauce didn't compliment the salmon or it was just the low quality of the salmon I used. I think I will try this recipe again with fresh salmon and then re-rate it. I will say, though, the sauce tasted oh-so-yummy dipped in the asparagus side dish I had.

I made this for my husband and a friend.  It was good, but sweet.  I guess I am not a fan of sweet salmon.  But, if you like a sweet asian flavor, it was nice.

I didn't have any lemon juice so I just added a smidge more soy sauce and white wine.  I marinated the salmon for about 50 minutes (couldn't wait an hour - I was starving!).  I sprinkled cajun seasoning on my fillet (hubby doesn't like spice).  I wouldn't sprinkle with cajun seasoning again - oops, my fault.  I BBQ'd outside (at about 350 degrees) allowing each side to cook for four minutes.  My smaller fillet carmalized a bit.  Didn't baste with any reserve sauce.  Served with Jasmine rice.  Delicious!

Considered giving this one five stars.  I didn't get to marinade the salmon very long (maybe 45 minutes), but it still made for a tasty grilled dinner.

This recipe was very easy and very yummy. My family ate it without any complaints and my 7 year old even had a second helping which is very unusual. As for me fish isn't my favorite but this was so good I found myself having a second piece.  Thanks again.  VAE

I saw some people suggesting olive oil instead of butter so I tried it that way and it came out fantastic. I left it to marinate in the fridge for about 45 minutes (because I'm impatient) and cooked it using a cheap dollar store indoor 'grill' for five minutes and it came out moist and flavorful. I think this is the best salmon recipe I've made so far, I'm thinking of making it a weekly staple

The grilled salmon was a nice firm texture.  I added garlic to the marinade as some reviewers suggested, and I reduced the amount of sugar.  It tasted fine, but I would have liked it to be more flavourful. Perhaps a slightly longer time marinating would have given the fish more taste.

I used olive oil in place of butter. I marinated the salmon for about 90 minutes.  I really liked the flavor of the marinade/glaze.  However, I didn't feel the salmon took on much of the flavor.  Next time I will marinate it much longer.  I am not a huge fan of salmon.  And I would try this recipe again with a longer marinade time.  I also used a copper grilling mat which prevented the salmon from sticking to the grates and falling apart.

My fully grown, adult husband with a career and 3 children licked his plate clean with this salmon. It's that good! As many other reviewers recommended, I swapped the butter for olive oil, but that's the only change I made. I let it marinate overnight and then pan cooked over medium high heat with a lid partially covering the pan. This method of cooking retained all the marinade as a sauce in the pan and we were able to eat it over white rice with the sauce. Very good! Next time I make it, I plan to add long green onions to the pan when cooking. It's a very tangy and sweet recipe, but I think the green onions will round out the flavors perfectly. Can't wait to have again!

Maybe it was wrong to grill it in foil, maybe we overcooked it. But it was so dry. I couldnt eat it. I had to walk away from dinner and make a scratch sauce to put on top.

I used canola oil in place of butter, white vinegar in place of lemon  juice and brown sugar Splenda blend in place of brown sugar (you need to halve the amount though) as well as my own soy sauce I make (mostly beer, molasses and veggie stock).

I HATE marinated salmon - I'm afraid it will start to cook the fish - so what I did was mix the sauce, bring it to a boil in a skillet on medium-high heat then toss the salmon in skin side down - flipped it after 7 minutes then cooked it for five more. I then removed it from the heat and left it in the pan until it was done bubbling.

I added the pan drippings to the rice I made as a side but I think it could be reduced if pan-frying is done. Another thought is using less oil.

Delicious recipe!  It had the right amount of sweet and savory.  We actually  made it on a cedar plank on the grill, which I would actually not recommend for this recipe because the cedar flavor overpowered the ingredients.

We loved this salmon.  Used olive in instead of butter.  Grilled it in the house it was still great.  Made a creamy dill sauce dip.

Made this the other day and was amazing. I added sweet chilli sauce to baste with and after to coat with slightly for an even better flavoured salmon.

My husband fishes for salmon, so we have salmon for dinner often. I've tried lots of recipes and this is among the best. I did not have lemon and white wine, so skipped those ingredients but added some sliced garlic. It turned out fantastic!

This marinade was delicious. My 12 year old who is super fussy with seafood ate her whole plate! I will definitely make it again.

Super easy and delicious. Cooked on a cedar blank on the BBQ. Served with parsnip and carrot purée (on this site) and sautéed green beans. My new go-to!

These were a bit on the sweet side for me.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add less sugar and more lemon.

This was the best tasting Salmon that we have ever eaten!  I substituted olive oil for the butter and put it on the BBQ.

This is my new salmon recipe. It's amazing. Gives the fish just enough sweetness to being out the flavor of the salmon. Delish

I like this recipe a lot, and it's also good for roast potatoes and other foods. I substituted olive oil for the butter and added 1 tsp. of minced garlic, which I think added great flavor.

This is a keeper! Looking forward to trying it on the grill, but in the meantime I did as one reader suggested and baked it (King), covered for 30 mins at 350 and then broiled for a few mins. It still was a little too moist, almost "poached", so next time I'll try uncovered. I also used half olive oil and half butter, plus one clove of minced garlic. I turned the unused marinade into a vinaigrette by adding a little more olive oil and some champagne vinegar and served the salmon on tossed greens.

I made this salmon for tonight's dinner, however, I baked it at 375 for about 25 minutes. It was good, but I thought it was definitely more sweet than sour. I will make this again, but for my taste, it could use some lemon juice, or mustard powder and ginger, or just less sugar to lessen the sweetness.

Good but go easy on the sugar, I doubled the recipe. I think we just prefer salmon plain or savory. But it was yummy.

I made this to the exact recipe last nite except for grilling. I placed on a cookie sheet with foil and baked it at 350 (uncovered) for about 25 minutes with basting once in the last 10 minutes of baking. My husband said it was the best Salmon he has ever tasted even in the finest restaurants. It was delicious and moist and flaky, I served this with a side salad and it was a great meal. I will be making this again and again. Thank you for sharing.

I found this really bland.  I used chicken broth instead of white wine and marinated for 4 hours.  There was barely any flavor to the dish.

I followed the marinade exactly except i did dilute the soy sauce by doing half soy sauce and half water because I watch my salt intake. We didn't grill it. Instead we put it on 400 for about 20mins. It was soooo good. We would definitely make this again. I can't wait until the summer so we can actually grill it!!

I have been cooking Salmon Tango for at least 5 years now.  I can not change to another Salmon recipe.  I love this recipe so much.  My husband says if I cook salmon any other he will NOT EAT IT.  THE GREATEST!!!

I added some garlic per other reviewers suggestion and substituted olive oil for the butter.  Marinaded king salmon for 4 hours, cooked on foil on the bbq grill, the taste just wasn't very distinctive or memorable.
