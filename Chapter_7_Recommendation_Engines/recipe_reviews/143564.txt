Excellent combination!  I omitted Splenda and added toasted pine nuts and made my own balsamic dressing (1/2 c. evoo, 1/4 c. balsamic, 1 clove pressed garlic, 1/4 tsp dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp. honey and salt to taste).  This is a great healthy lunch or side!

Delicious!  I did add a splash of straight balsamic vinegar for a little extra kick and adjusted the sweetner.  I used liquid Stevia instead of Splenda.

This is very simple, yet very good.  I used a little olive oil and straight balsamic vinegar instead of a prepared dressing.  I completely omitted the sugar and added a little cumin and garlic salt instead.  Yummy!

I didn't use the celery and subbed the Splenda out for about 3/4 tsp. of honey since we are trying to cut out all artificial sweeteners.  I think I will cut down to 1/3 cup of balsamic vinaigarette next time, but that could be because of the difference in texture between the honey and Splenda.  Pretty good.  The kids didn't love it but the hubby and I devoured it.

Delicious! I wasn't crazy about adding the Splenda so after reading other reviews, I went with the liquid Stevia and some honey. Instead of plain cranberries, I had a bag of mixed cranberries and raisins and I probably doubled the amount called for in the recipe. Also added some chopped pecans! Wonderful!! This one is a keeper.

I served this as a warm salad and the whole family enjoyed it.  I sauted the onions, celery, and crasins in a bit of olive oil and a sprinkle of seasoning salt.  I had 3 cups of leftover brown rice that I added to the skillet.  I used a few tablespoons of pomegranate balsamic vinegar which is very sweet omitting the need for the splenda or balsamic dressing.  I will continue to use this as a way to use brown rice leftovers.

This so amazing! I had two cups of brown rice and wanted to dress it up for the other awesome recipe I was making  - Pork Chops with Raspberry Sauce (you must try these together! ) I sauteed the onions and celery in oil, used about 1/4 cup straight balsamic vinegar and no sugar at all. I also served it warm and together this was one of my all time favorite recipes!

I thought this was a very easy, very flavourful summer salad. I was a bit pressed for time so I boiled the brown rice like a pasta which cuts down the cooking time by 20 to 40 minutes and it comes out exactly the same (don't know why people steam rice but that's a question for another day). I followed another reviewer's advice and added sunflower seeds. I didn't have any dried cranberries but I did have honeyed dates which I chopped up and added to the mix. Also made my own balsamic vinaigrette. The honey in the dates added the sweetness that this salad needed so I didn't add any to the dressing. Yum! Oh and this would be just as good as a warm salad!

I didn't have balsamic vinaigrette dressing, so I mixed raspberry walnut vinaigrette dressing and plain balsamic to equal 1/2 cup add recipe called for; it tastes so delicious & earthy!  I'm definitely keeping this one!

Good side dish... I skipped the celery and Splenda and served it warm.  I also added a little salt & pepper, and used balsamic vinegar & olive oil in place of salad dressing.

I LOVE this recipe. I make it when I want to take something tasty and there are Veg-heads around. Everyone likes this recipe and it goes well with sandwiches. I like to take it on picnics as well.

I made this tonight and used liquid stevia instead of splenda and a drizzle of molasses with my homemade Balsamic vinegar.  Easy to make and really yummy.  All ingredients are what I would always have in my pantry and fridge.

Wow...a great way to use left over rice. I spiced it up with a Red Apple Balsamic and used plain white rice. Loved it. Will become one of those go-to recipes in our house.

Just made this with left over basmati, some dried cranberries and chopped red onion, but sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts (I'm allergic).  Made my own balsamic dressing.  A nice combination of sweet and salty, soft and crunchy...  Curious to see how it holds up after a day - that will be the test of whether it is a potluck-worthy recipe!

I love brown rice and liked this when made as directed - but to be really good it needed a bit more punch. I added a little chopped ginger and garlic and it was then worth 5 stars. A lovely, good-looking salad.

This salad was just too different with the brown rice- I'm trying it once more, but with white rice instead this time.
