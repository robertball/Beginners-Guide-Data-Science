This recipe tastes great - we have made it twice.  Can put your leftover (already cooked) roasts in the crock pot and cook it the same.  Great for a summer dinner, to keep the house cool and/or to feed a lot of people

I gave this three stars because even though the sauce wasn't outstanding, it was so easy, made a lot, and reheated well, and tasted pretty good with chips and slices of cold watermelon, so chances are I'll make it again.  My hb liked it too.  We didn't shake our heads and rave over it all through the meal, but it was a good, satisfying, practical sandwich filler.  Not bad.

We have made this a few times now and the whole family loves it.  I like how easy it is to make, especially for  nights when they kids have sports.

Not bad.  The sauce could be a little sweeter.

How easy was this to make!  SUPER EASY!  The meat tore apart so easily and we had enough of it left over for 3 lunches.  Really tasty and great for a cold winter day, a potluck, or any time!  A real 'hungry man' pleaser!

I made this recipe from the magazine only a few weeks ago.  This is an easy, tasty beef BBQ recipe.  I found it to be a bit on the sweet side (I prefer a tangier sauce), but my husband really liked it.  Next time I might cut the steaks against the grain before cooking them, since simply shredding them made for very long strands of beef and my sons had a hard time biting and chewing the beef.  This would be excellent for a pot luck or after a trip to the pumpkin patch on a cool day.
