Make this all the time but use Bloody Mary vodka to impart a real nice tang!

I couldn't find pepper vodka, so I just infused some vodka with chopped jalapeños and some dried chilis (and this way you can control how hot your vodka is) and then strained them out.  These are fast & quick little appetizers; be sure to serve them in the vodka so your salt-lemon pepper mixture sticks to the tomato.  Can't say that I like the sodium content on this recipe, but like everything, moderation is key.

These didn't really do it for my guests, but I enjoyed them. Be careful if you leave them too long - mine marinated overnight and after eating 3 I could no longer remember what to serve for the main course :-)

I didn’t think the pepper vodka made the cherries as hot as I expected, but they were still pretty tasty.

Very tasty.  I added some juice from the jar of sport peppers to the vodka when I was infusing it.  We also tried bell pepper strips to the marinade.  They were good too.
