This has been a family fav for years. I sprinkle my chops with seasoning salt, onion and garlic powder prior to dipping in a milk/egg wash, then the seasoned flour with black pepper added. Then I let the chops sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes to an hour before frying to get the coating "gummy" looking, so the coating will not fall off while frying. After frying the chops, I keep them warm and use the same skillet to whip up milk gravy, using the rest of the seasoned flour, pepper a little chicken soup base, salt and milk. Serve with mashed potatoes, buttered corn and biscuits. YUMMY!

Prior comments made it seem as though all that was needed here was a bit more flavor.  I used (about 3/4 tsp) Goya Adobo seasoning instead of Seasoned Salt, added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp crushed rosemary, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  These truly were the most scrumptious fried pork chops I have ever had.  I would suggest 8/9 min on each side for 1 inch thick chops.

Great basic recipe; thank you for sharing.  Cooks have to be creative!  I used bread crumbs, seasoned to my taste since seasoning is a variable.  Used much less oil and I prefer olive.  After they were done, place on a paper towel to get any excess oil removed; I also dabbed the top side.  They are very moist and tasty!

For those of you that make a ton of changes to a recipe and then rate it...You are not doing us any favors! I followed this recipe to the letter and ended up with chops with no breading. Bare, naked, chops. All of the flour came off as soon as I added the chops to the grease. I have always used milk or egg or both to bind the flour, but instead I followed the recipe. Use at your own risk!

FIRST TIME TO FRY pork chops, and they really were like grandmother's/Moma's!!!
Who'd ever think it was that simple.
I just added about 1 tbsp. of Lemon Pepper & a pinch or two of Parsley for a bit of color. STILL, I don't think anyone can mess up this recipe (Normally, I can). They were "tender" too, mine are usually tough...
The only thing missing was the recipe for the gravy following, Which is my next project, MAKING GRAVY....lol
BUT I GIVE THIS RECIPE A TRIPLE AAA+++ and then some.......Thanks for submitting it......YYYYYUUUUUMMMMM!!!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The one thing I did differently was sprinkle Lawry's Seasoned Salt directly on the chop before dipping it in the flour-salt-pepper mix.  This enhanced the seasoning salt flavor.

O.K., so let's put everyone's helpful hints together that make this dish really great!  Number one, add some bread crumbs, garlic powder, salt, and maybe a little cayenne to the flour mixture.  Number two-make sure you coat the pork chops in the flour mixture, then dip in an egg/milk mixture, then back in the flour mixture (at this point I just pour the flour mixture out of the ziplock bag onto a plate).  Finally, let the pork chops rest on a plate in the fridge.  Use no bone in, thin cut pork chops by the way.  Really great recipe with some tweaks!

Very good basic chop recipe, I added spices to the flour before breading (paprika, garlic pdwr). And I added a little bit of Italian bread crumbs to the flour to help the coating stick.

The only thing I do differently is I prefer bread crumbs to flour.  Panko is even better.  These make a mess and really aren't very healthy so I don't make often, but my husband loves it when I do.

I've always loved my Aunt Janet's fried pork chops. This was my first time ever attempting to make them. This is a basic recipe, and I got ambitious and added my own take. Instead of salt and pepper I added Emmeril's all purpose seasoning, rosemary, and any other herb on hand. Also, instead of shaking in a bag-since I didn't have any plastic bags (broke law student) I just seasoned and added the flour to the meat on a plate and put the plate in the fridge for 30 minutes to help it stick. My boyfriend and brother LOVED these. Brother even said they tastes better than Aunt Janet's pork chops!!

Something to recognize and experiment with is salt. Salt tastes different when you mix it in the flour and then dust the meat before cooking as opposed to salting the meat while it is frying in the skillet. Chances are you will use more if you dust the meat with a flour and salt mixture because it mutes the flavor of the salt. A third way is to salt to taste at the table but this is the least flavorful because you are hitting your taste buds with pure salt. When you fry with salt it brings out the flavor, blends with the juices and becomes part of the dish rather than laying on top of it. Frying fresh mushrooms in the pan with the chops and using some corn meal with the flour also enhances flavor.

I read all the recommendations, then took the six pork loins that were about a half inch thick each and followed the recipe. The changes I made were largely due to the suggestion by other reviewers except for the magic coating sauce I did at the end. I used onion powder, salt, pepper and some garlic powder and a dash of Cayen pepper powder. Wash and patted dry,coated with the seasoned flour mixture, diped in egg batter, and then coated with the seasoned italian bread crumbs. Pan fried in vegatable and olive oil mixed for two minutes each side till golden brown. Then I dumped most of the oil but left the pan drippings, added a tablespoon of butter and swished the brown drippings into the melted butter, then added a dash of Cointreau or any orange liquir would do. Took this sauce and  placed it over the golden brown chops and the orange flavor mixed with the toasted taste of the bread crumbs. The coating was wonderful, the Cointreau was out of this world and the whole plate of six loins disappeared in a flash. It was the first time that none of us used the apple sauce we all love with pork. The chops were moist and the crust so flavorful we decided it was a waste to lose the flavor in the apple sauce.

I admit that I am a cooking novice. So with that said I am sure that these pork chops are great, but to help my fellow cooking-challenged friends out. You are going to need to "dredge"- I think that's what it's called. Anyway, DIP the pork chop into either an egg or two or buttermilk before putting it in the mix. I can HEAR the laughter! I will try it again using my newfound knowledge. Wish me (and my husband) luck!

These are the classic chops you could expect to get from a great diner.  These were so easy!  Delicious!  I followed the recipe as written.  Much better with thin cut pork chops.

I hardly ever fry pork chops, but for some reason I decided I wanted them for dinner.  I was very pleased with this recipe.  The meat was crisp on the outside and tender inside.  I'd definitely make them again.

These were the best fried pork chops I have ever made...And I have made my share of pork chops. I used Morton (Nature's Seasons) Seasoning Blend. As per other reviews I seasoned the chops themselves and the flour. I coated in flour and let sit for 15 minutes before frying them.. Perfect!

I doubled the spices.  Added 1 tablespoon of onion, granulated.  Cooked for 5 - 10 minutes.  It's a keeper for us.  Hubby really loved it.

This was great!  Be careful with the salt.  What the recipe calls for is all that you need.  I thought I would spice it up with garlic and extra seasoning salt and went too far.  I love how easy this is to make.

I tried this tonight for dinner.  The only different thing I added was some garlic and onion powder, and they turned out great.  Just like my mother's used to taste.  And very,very easy.  This will be my "Go To" recipe from now on.  Forget the soups, and sauce's ............Old fashioned taste is what I was after.  And I found it in this recipe.

Very good!! Like other suggested I added garlic powder and oregano to the seasoning. Which gave them more of a flavor. I also fried them in canola oil I think next time i will use crisco.

Like someone else, I also let my chops "rest" in the refridgerator for a while.  I let the grease get hot and then put them in.  Not greasy and very juicy and tender!  I used to not like fried pork, but these were terrific!

Yum.  I used more seasoned salt (maybe 3/4 t) and sprinkled in a little onion powder, garlic powder and sage.  Cooked it up in the ol' cast iron with lard instead of veggie oil (I'm bad).  Very easy, very tasty, very fast. :)

Very good, but with changes. I used Italian bread crumbs, seasoning salt, garlic powder and pepper. Fried with oil and 1 tbsp of butter. Used thin boneless pork cuts, and it came out perfect.

As soon as I put them in the pan all the flour came off and I basically fried plain chops in oil. Many reviewers did things differently than the recipe states so if you follow their advice things may turn out better for you.

Pretty basic, easy recipe.  I topped my chops with a red pepper and ancho chili jam.  Then they were divine!

You need to use milk or egg to get a true breading.  I looked at the pictures and ignored my prior knowledge about breadings, thinking that it would just be a lighter breading. I was wrong.

This recipe is a winner in our house. Everyone loved it. My kids are picky and I've never seen a dish disappear so quickly!! I followed another reviewer's advice and put the seasoning salt directly on the pork chop first. I used McCormick Season All and it turned out really good. I'm keeping this recipe to use again. It was easy, fast and delicious. Thank you for posting this recipe. I feel like the dinner hero tonight! :)

The pork chops I had were thicker than 3/4" so once I fried on each side about 5 minutes each, I placed in 400 degree oven for about 15-20 minutes.  Delicious!

Simple, easy and just like grandma used to make. The only thing to make this better is to cook them in a cast iron skillet like she did. This is recipe perfection. My husband was in pork chop heaven. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Great basic recipe. My Grandparents had a farm and raised their own pigs so we had pork often. I always flour my chops, allow to sit 15 minutes then flour again. That ensures the flour remains on the meat. Although unhealthy as can be, I go for flavor and I fry my chops in bacon grease.  While browning the chops I use tongs to raise them up to ensure the grease/ or oil stays under them and the chops get get good and browned.  I add flour to the drippings, mix to scrape up all the good bits in the pan then add caned evaporated milk to make a gravy. We either put this gravy over the fried chops or on the side over bread slices.

This recipe was simple and delicious. I always  pound my pork chops with my pampered chef meat tenderizer. That way you can cut through them like butter.

Delicious.  I use a bit of paprika instead of the seasoning salt.  Really works well for juicy, thick cut chops.

What I love about this recipes is that 1) it is super fast! 2) the pork stays so nice and moist! 

This is a solid recipe that I will add to my regular menu at home, but I agree with other reviewers that the flavor could be kicked up a notch.

Prior to adding to the flour coating I seasoned the prock chops with seasoning salt and galric powder. I think I will just add more seasonings in the future and keep playing with it, even though there were no complaints at the dinner table!

This was the first time I have fried pork chops and they were tender!  VERY MOIST!  My only complaint was not enough flavor.  I will add more spices next time.

This is the tried and true method of making Southern fried pork chops. (Source: I have been in the South all my life) My mother made pork chops this exact way when I was growing up. My husband and I like a little more flavor, so I added garlic and onion powder. They always turn out great! Thanks for posting this!

Fried pork chops were always a favorite growing up and this was the first time I ever tried to make my own!  They were quick and turned out good!  Next time I will more than likely season them a little more before frying!

This recipe with Lawry's Seasoning Salt, fresh ground black pepper, and a little garlic powder has been my recipe for many years. It is wonderful. Be sure to use bone in chops. Any time u can use bone in meat it helps preserve meat moisture and flavor. That meat right up next to the bone is heavenly to nibble on! 5 stars solid.

A GREAT Easy Basic Fried Pork Chop Recipe, that a staple in my family and has been for years. Sometimes when I make this I dredge in flour, then egg, then flour again to give it a nice crust. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This was great!  I made too much, froze it (just to see if it would keep/reheat well) and it did!!!!  Just as good the second time around!  I defrosted it in the microwave, then crisped it up in the oven.  Will be doing this one again.

was good. I used a deep fryer and seasoned the pork chops with seasoned salt let the pork chops rest while i prepared the milk/egg mixture. I added garlic powder, salt, pepper to the flour. Dipped the pork chop lightly in flour then in egg and back in the flour. Let them rest in the fridge for 30 minutes and then fried them. Always a big hit in the family.

These were really good I added onion powder, garlic powder, and Tonys seasoning to it and they came out perfect. My three kids and husband ate them without complaints so that makes this a definite keeper.

I trimmed the fat off, rinsed then seasoned with garlic and onion powders. Next I dredged them through flour that had been jazzed up with "pepper-herb" seasoning and fried them in half veggie oil and half butter. YUM!

Delicious! I grew up in Southeast Texas and this is how we always fried our pork chops. Made gravy afterwards, too. If reviewers are getting after other reviewers for doing their own recipe, don't downgrade the recipe. If you tried it, grade it as is!

The two year old ate it all, I topped it with milk gravy and served green beans, mashed potatoes, and sliced veggies. I recommend after flouring the chops to put them on a wire rack for 30 minutes, like you would fried chicken, so the breading will really stick and fry up crisp.

I dipped these in an egg and milk mix to help the breading stick, which it did. I had to cook them in the oven for about 8 minutes in addition to frying on the stove top in order to get them to cook up to 170 and there wasn't a whole lot of flavor. I served them with country gravy, which helped but I probably won't be making them again.

Many reviewers have suggested these chops need more flavor.  Instead of flour and seasonings, use Progresso Italian bread crumbs!  When my children were younger I coated theirs in Progresso Plain bread crumbs.  Beat an egg in a small bowl, add a little milk.  Dip the chops in this, coat with bread crumbs then fry.  I think 3/4" chops will take longer than 5 minutes.

Pork chops turned out very tasty...even my 5 year old loved them and asked for seconds.  The only thing I did differently was sprinkle the seasoning salt directly on the chops, and I used more than 1/2 tsp for extra flavor.  I will definitely be making these again!

Thank you so much for this simple recipe.  My mom use to make fried pork chops and none of us kids knew how she did it.  This is just like hers, but I didn't put the chops in a bag.  I just put them on a flat plate to coat them.  I also remembered that my mom would put them on a paper towel covered paper plate to absorb the excess oil after frying.  Love this simple recipe and will soon try with some different spices (i.e. onion pwdr) just for a change.

I followed another reviewers advice and coated the pork chops on each side with Lowry's before putting them in a flour/Lowry's mixture. They came out very tasty. Even my wife said, "ooh, this is good"; high praise if you know my wife :D

This recipe was very good, however I did use some suggestions made by others. I seasoned the pork chops with adobo, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper. Then I seasoned the flour with seasoned salt and cayenne pepper and followed the rest of the recipe. My fiance and I loved it.

This worked out really well, my step father raved about these, they where super easy to make too, however the only thing I did differently which I do with all meat's that need breading, is that I left them in the fridge for 30 minutes before putting them in the fryer.

Found this good, but a little bland. I kicked it up a bit with a couple teaspoons of garlic powder and a 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper. These worked great for a pork chop parm. top with your favorite tomato sauce and some shredded mozzarella and bake at 350 for about 10-15 minutes or until cheese is melted and sauce is heated through.

This is a quick way to prepare pork chops. It's not a 5 star recipe, but a great weeknight meal. I served with stuffing (from a box)and frozen vegetable medley. The whole meal was done in about 30 minutes.

Was very short on time so tried this as it was much easier than my orginal method of coating with flour that has many seasonings added then dip in egg and back into the flour---this recipe did not do much for us.  From now on if I am short on time I will not take short cuts.

This recipe is just like I remember growing up...such a great comfort food.  I mixed the flour with some Italian bread crumbs to give the chops more of a crunch and they turned out great.  I also added some garlic powder along with salt, pepper and seasoning salt.  I made with homemade milk gravy and mashed potatoes.  It was a meal I would not make all the time due to the fact it is fried but it is great for a special treat.  Yum!

I thought this was great. So easy. I do agree it was too much oil so I'll knock it down next time to 3/4 of a cup. I used cutlets as that was all I had and I realized I had no flour. So I did an egg/milk wash and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. To the egg wash, I added Tony's seasoning, garlic powder, seasoned salt and fresh ground pepper. I also used the tip after breading leave the chops in the fridge for 30 min. and the batter did hold on. These were perfect!
Thanks!

This caught my eye because it's exactly how my grandma and dad both used to make fried steak and fried pork chops.  I spiced it up by adding some garlic powder, ground red pepper, salt-free garlic and herb seasoning and lots of ground black pepper (+ the season salt).  I made 6 chops and used about 3/4 cup oil in the biggest frying pan I have - added 1/4 stick of butter (hey, it was a splurge night!).  I fried the chops by site - beautiful dark, golden brown color on each site.    I used the left-over flour and some drippings from the pan to make "red pepper" gravy and served with a cilantro quinoa (from a box) and green peas (frozen).    It was a HIT!!  Thanks for the memories.  ;-)

This was an "ok" recipe.  Not very flavourful, but not horrible tasting either.  It was so-so.

These pork chops were delicious!  I modified the recipe slightly by adding 1 tsp of the following into the flour mixture: garlic salt, seasoned salt, ground black pepper, garlic powder, parsely flakes, and ground red pepper for some extra kick.  I used about a 1/2 a cup of olive oil and fried until the coating was golden brown and then threw it on my stove top grill on medium heat until it was cooked.

This is a great recipe!  Its very easy, quick, simply and best of all tasty!  I have been trying to find a basic delicious pork chop recipe, and I think I've found a winner!

I added a little onion powder to my seasoning mixture.  Next time I will add a bit more salt.

My mom always did her pork chops like this. She taught me to always season the meat, as well as the flour coating. Also, make sure the oil is hot enough or the coating will stick to the pan & not the chops. I season my meat with salt, garlic powder & oregano, basically a dry rub.

I seasoned the chops with seasoning salt and pepper then covered with the flour. I also upped the seasoning in the flour itself (doubled the seasoning salt and added garlic powder) and cooked in only 1/2 cup of oil. They came out perfectly and my hubby loved them. So simple and easy. Perfect for a weeknight!

Seasoned with Montreal seasoning, then floured.  Used about 1/2 the oil.  Done in about 6 minutes using meat thermometer. No dried pork!!!

Tender on the inside, crisp on the outside.  This is a great way to cook a chop.  Add a dash of cayenne to the flour for a little extra flavor.  Be sure not to skimp on the salt and pepper!  And be sure the oil in your pan is nice and hot before you slide them in.  Mine were perfect at 3 minutes on each side, tops!

Awesome recipe! I tweaked it a bit and added Italian bread crumbs & flour together for the breading. The chops turned out SO delicious...nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Definitely a keeper!

What a great, simple recipe! My only changes were that I added a light coating of garlic salt and pepper on both sides of the chops before shaking in the mix, and instead of 4 thick chops I placed 6 1/2 inch thick chops in the bag using the amount of ingredients listed. Had them in the oil 5 minutes a side and they came out absolutely delicious.

Nice moist pork chop and fairly easy to fix. Cooking method is a little messy though. Chops were also kinda bland, but once I added some extra seasoning (cajun or oldbay) it bumped up the flavor. Would also be great with gravy.

Good  Basic recipe. Putting the seasoned salt directly on the chops probably would have made it taste a bit better. Kids liked it so thats always a plus.

These were great.  My husband and I loved them, and I can't wait to get home and eat what's left!  I did season the chops with garlic salt and onion powder before breading. And I followed a suggestion and let them sit in the fridge with the (double) coating on.  When I went to put them in the frying pan, some of the batter stuck to the plate and not to the chop.  Next time, I will just put them directly into the pan and skip that suggestion. I served them with scalloped potatoes and vegetables in cheese sauce. YUM!

these were great; the only thing i added was instead of using ALL flour for the coating, i used a mixture of grounded rolled oats (i used food processor to grind them), brad crumbs, & flour, seasonings, and some sesame seeds. letting them sit in the fridge to look "gummy" sounds like a great idea!

I took the advice of some other reviewers and put adobo on the pork before the flour.  I also added onion and garlic powder and parsley to the flour.  It came out GREAT! I gave it 4 stars because I could see why you would want to add some more seasoning.

i've always had a problem with fried pork chops. i followed this recipe and took a couple of already posted hints. i added a little garlic powder and season salt to the flower mixture. after i floured them i let thiem sit for about 30 minutes as another suggested. This was the ticket! because mine were really thick 1 to 1 1/2 inches- i browned them for a bit on the stove then placed them on a rack in a slow oven. awesome!

I had thawed pork chops and 40 minutes to make dinner.  This recipe was great as it was quick.  The taste was simple, not a whole bunch of various flavors (which I like), the chops were juicy and tender. Thanks!

This recipes was very good. Its definitely a great recipe to start off with and add your own taste to it. I added some Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning to it and it was delicious. I also used bone in pork chops that I don't suggest. The boneless ones would be better. Overall, I am definitely going to keep going this!

This is a good basic recipe.  I seasoned the chops with adobo, dipped in flour, then egg with a little milk, then Panko.  Left in the fridge for at least 1.5 hours before frying 4-5 minutes on each side.  Great with a side of sweet potato casserole.

This was a good basic recipe. I added lots of seasoning to the flour (garlic powder, onion powder and cajun seasoning). It still seemed sort of bland though still good with some BBQ sauce on the side. I may still use this again since it was very simple and fast. Thanks!

I love this website because you can tweak a recipe and use ideas from other members.  I decided to tweak this recipe a bit and I still wasn't quite satisfied. I'm giving this 4 stars because I thought it deserved 3 and my husband thought I should rate it higher. Basically, even with adding spices, I thought it was still bland and lacking something.  I used the advice of others and used olive oil vs vegetable and used less, about 1/4 cup. I made 3 chops and purchased some that were thinner than the recipe called for. I placed the chops in a ziploc bag with flour, paprika, salt/pepper, onion and garlic powder. If I decide to make this again, I need to think of another spice to use because I still felt it was blah. I placed the bag in the fridge for about 30 min like another reader mentioned. The chops turned out crispy and looked beautiful, but they weren't flavorful. Definitely not one of my favorite recipes, but I do think if I think hard enough, I can figure out what it needs to be a 5 star recipe.

Not my fave.  I think the recipe would be improved with the addition of some garlic powder and/or onion powder.  Just didn't have any flavor to us.

6 out of 7 liked this one. It was quick, easy and I already had the ingredients. I did substitute olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. Supposedly a better fat to use. It received a thumbs up! I'll do it again.

Let me say first I am not good at frying meats, so I usually bake. This recipe is perfect!!! I followed it exactly (except I did put butter in my oil and dipped in egg mixture) and they were delicious!!! Thanks for making fried pork chops so easy!!!!

This is exactly what my mom made for us growing up!  I always loved it, still do.  Simple dinner but great! For the reviewer that had breading fall off, mustn't have followed the recipe to a t like they stated. No issues here.  Came out perfectly.

This is a good basic got-to recipe you can augment in a variety of ways (see many examples here).  But dipping the chops in egg wash violates the method here.  What they did is  called "chicken fried," a totally different method.
Two things I did slightly differently: I let the chops sit in the fridge for 30 minutes after dipping in flour.  And I made sure the oil was really hot--over 350 F--before I put the chops in.
I achieved an internal temp of 150 F in about 8 minutes because I pounded the chops to a half inch thickness before flouring.  This was also a good way to apply spices--Middle Eastern seven spices--which were embedded in the surface of the chops under the coat of flour.
Thanks for the recipe.

I made some changes - I used toasted almond flour (to make it Keto) and seasoned it with Trader Joe's Everyday Seasoning and fried it in Coconut oil.  It was delicious!

Best pork chops I've ever made and so so easy. Made exactly as written with the exception of seasoning the pork first and letting it sit in the bag with the flour for about 10 minutes. My whole family loved it, even my picky husband and kids.

I pan fried pork chops with this recipe and they came out great.  I cut down on the oil and seasoned the chops with salt and pepper before putting them in the flour mixture.  They were a hit with my family!

Easy recipe and it works just fine for me. I did it just as the recipe called for, and the chops turned out just fine. No need for a wet dredge for this at all. I've had compliments on great chops both times I have cooked them this way.

This kind of recipe invites changes to your taste.   I don't have seasoned salt so I used garlic, the crushed rosemary, Italian seasoning and paprika in addition to salt.  I also sautéed mushrooms to put on top. This was quick and easy.

Been frying chops for 50 years and do it basically the same way except that I moisten the chops with a little water before seasoning them with Cajun seasonings plus granulated onion and garlic. Fry at 350 for about 4 minutes with the cover ON the frying pan. This will help make a wonderful crust. Turn chops over and fry an additional 4 minutes with the cover OFF. You will end up with a beautiful tasty crust.

Yes - this is a good basic recipe but if you make this recipe exactly as it is - yick!!!  You end up with greasy, tough almost unchewable meat.  That is why everyone has changed the recipe and then posted those changes.  Thank goodness they did.  I for one an grateful for any and all ideas plus I have a few of my own.  And yes - I totally changed/added to it.

It's ok, but it lacks flavor.  I  make mine basically the same way, but I use Progresso Italian Breadcrumbs.  First egg, then flower, then egg, then bread crumbs.  Works for me :)..

These pork chops were a huge hit with my family, We couldn't believe a fried pork chop could be so juicy!! The only thing I changed in the recipe that I found worked better, I only used about 3 tablespoons of oil to cook the chops in and I added Adobo spice to my flour mixture for more taste. I also used an egg and milk wash before coating and put them in the fridge for about a 1/2 hour before frying, tips I got from the reviews ~ Thanks! Also, something I learned on the Rachel Ray Show, before frying your boneless (thin cut) chops, make a small slit in the chop on the "fat" side and your chops will not curl when frying! I will definitely be making this for my family again!

I made these exactly as the recipe directed.  I had a thinner pork chop so I had to cut the cooking time to 2-3 minutes on each side, but they turned out fantastic.  A nice, flaky crust on a juicy pork chop...nothing better!

I don't see how anyone could screw this up.  I didn't have breadcrumbs, and this one was the first recipe I saw.  I normally don't bread my pork chops and this was super easy! Just add seasonings to your liking and you're done.

Another recipe just like my mother's growing up. Simple but delicious. We always had these with peas and rice. I'd cut my chop up and dip it in ketchup (don't judge, its delicious.) Great comfort food!

It is an okay recipe BUT you definitely have to use some egg wash or buttermilk wash, otherwise all the flour will fall off once the pork chop is in the oil!!

Sorry I don't have a photo. It has been a long time since I fried pork chops. I used to fry 20 mins on each side(don't laugh). When I saw 4 mins per side I did not think they would be done-but they were. I used egg mixture to dip them in to keep the flour on. They had a good flavor. I will try again soon!

Very good basic recipe.  I admit that I made some big changes to the recipe.  Also, Iam trying top eat light right now, so I only got a few amazing bites of these off of my finance's plate.  But those few bites were awesome!  He's asked that I keep this one in my recipe binder.

My tweaks: I seasoned the chops with seasoning salt, let them sit in the frige for a couple hours. I used half flour and half corn meal for the breading.  Per some other reviewer's advice, I added about 1/4tsp each oregano, fresh rosemary, pepper, and salt to the breading mixture and gave the chops a bath in milk and egg before breading.  After breading, I again let them sit in the fridge while I prepped the mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. While the veggies steamed, I heated the oil and fried.  Turned out perfectly!

I've always baked pork chops, so this was new for me to fry it.  The coating was tasty, but didn't stick and wound up in the pan.  The other reviewers added more spices to their mixture, and some did a flour coat, egg dip, flour coat.  That seems to be the most favorable.   I'll try one more time, and , if I don't get it to stick better, it's back to baking for me!

So quick and easy!  We'll definitely use this recipe again in the future.  While I prefer the taste of other breading techniques, this gets bonus points for ease.

Not very flavorful. It did teach me how to fry a pork chop but I will be adding different spices to it next time. It just doesn't have much flavor.

Would have given 5 stars, except that it would have been bland had I not followed the advice of other reviews. 

I fried for 4 min on each side because I hate dry pork, still was a bit dry but I'm not judging on that, everyone s stove and tastes are different.

WARNING! This was the first time I fried anything in that much oil, and I seriously splashed and burned my wrist. Be careful!

Overall, delicious! Will make again, with modifications.

These were great!  I rinsed off and did not pat dry.  I sprinkled on some garlic powder and onion powder before dredging in flour/salt/pepper mixture.  Thanks for the great quick recipe!

This is a great base recipe, the pork chops turn out nice a moist. However, for better flavor I added 1 tsp. of onion powder and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and they were DELICIOUS! Sometimes when we feel like something spicy I will also add a few dashes of chili powder, cumin, and red pepper. They are great both ways!

Pork chops came out tender, but could've put more seasoning in it.  Hubby ate it though, and our 4 yr old.  Paired this up with some pasta side dish and apple crumble recipe on this site.

This is good, I've had trouble before getting chops to fry without being dried out.  One secret is to get them cut thinner, and the second secret is this recipe, although I did also knock off a star for too much oil.  I used 3/4 cup and even that was still plenty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent, moist enough to cut with fork, very easy to make, the small amount of worcestershire makes a great flavor-not over powering.  My husband raved about them!

These were by far the best pork chops I have ever made. My husband loved them.  My son, who doesn't really care for chops all that much, loved them.  They were moist and very flavorful.  I will make these many more times to come.

These are so easy to make and they are so GOOD! I slightly altered the recipe by dipping the pork chops in egg first and adding butter to the olive oil and then putting them in the oven in foil for a little while after frying them. Everyone was raving about how good as well as tender and juicy they were! I'm sure we'll be eating these again soon! Thanks for the recipe!

If you do this recipe,  step for step, you will be disappointed.  I just wanted to try something easier and less messy and I KNEW this wouldn't work. It's a tasteless dry pork chop with no kind of breading what so ever because it disappears when you put it in your oil. I knew better.

After reading the comments, I decided to use the recipe loosely. I put accent(basically a seasoning salt), salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and cumin in the flour mixture. I used almond milk for an egg wash and did TWO coats of batter (the first one with only one fell apart). Fried them for 5 minutes on each side in olive oil. They're delicious and crunchy and my kids love them.

Trying to be on a low-salt diet, I used ground sage instead of the seasoned salt. Very good!

This is how I've been making chops for years, with the only exception being that I usually dredge mine in WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR instead of white flour. Adds a wonderful robust flavor.

The only changes that I had made was that I had to cook it a bit longer for the pink to get completely gone, then instead of adding the usual salt and pepper I used my new Weber Steak n Chop Seasoning . Great smelling!  After it was done cooking I turned it off, but left it in the skillet and added some shredded mozzarella cheese to it, put lid back on and let it melt naturally.

I added turmeric adobo and cayenne to my seasoning. I added Italian breadcrumbs to my flour. Came out delicious. Not sure why the batter for the first came off some but the others were perfect.

I did some things differently like dipping my chops in 2 beaten eggs and then breaded in breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs I season with salt pepper soup food seasoning and Mrs Dash.

This is the first time I've made fried pork chops.  For oil, I used bacon grease.  To the flour mixture, I added a spicy sprinkle, called Tony's.  We both loved them.

I may have done it wrong, but it is a bit chewy. I added a side of mixed veggies and it helped bring out the meaty-ness. Definitely gonna try it again!

The best pork chop I’ve ever had! My husband and I couldn’t stop raving about it as we ate. Far superior to grilling or any other batter I’ve tried. I followed Jouce’s suggestions and added more seasoning and let the batter get “gummy” before grilling. I also mixed some Panko bread crumbs into the mix.

Turned out great. Could use less vegetable oil or a larger pan so that it isn't too deep, otherwise the flour on top gets washed right off. Also only need 4 min on each side because it gets pretty tough with 5 min.

Made it according to recipe but with boneless pre-brined pork chops.  Turned out great and will make again, but going forward if using a pre-brined product I'll cut back on the salt in the coating.

Fantastic!  Just added the salt and pepper to the flour, and the chops were tender and not dry as mine usual are.  Next time, I'll try adding some more seasoning.  Thanks.

I'm a fast food bachelor. So I didnt have all purpose flour. But I did have pancake batter. It went fine with lots of pepper and some garlic salt. My chops where a bit thicker, about an inch. So I had to up my time to 5 1/2 per side and I did it on medium. I should go to the store :)

I was searching for a quick and easy recipe for pork chops and this one is it!  Yes, add more seasoning, as all the other reviewers mentioned.  So, in addition to the Season-all I sprinkled directly on the pork chops, I added some onion powder, garlic powder, and lemon pepper seasoning to the flour.  But adding more stuff to the flour is pretty simple, so the recipe remains quick and simple.

Finally, to all the reviewers that mentioned that you need to coat the pork chop with egg/milk, etc. to get the flour to stick, keep in mind that this recipe is *not* a breaded pork chop recipe.  If you want breaded pork chops, yes, you will need to coat with egg, and add some bread crumbs to the flour.  This recipe is coating the pork chop with flour just to keep the insides moist during the frying process.  By the way, you may want to pat the pork chops with some paper towels so that the flour doesn't clump.

it is a nice and simple recipe especially for people who may not be confident in their kitchens--like me. 
The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because of the weird instructions. the seasoning and flour will say on /much/ better if you use an egg wash instead of a plastic bag. if you don't have something to bind the mix to the meat, it may just come all off during frying.

This was a hit with my kids who aren't a huge fan of pork chops unless drowned in mushroom soup. But this was really good. I will use thinner porkchops next time just so that it can cook faster. Made these in a cast iron pan. Served up with rice and corn. May make gravy on the side next time to accommodate. I put mine on some greens with a bit of the corn, add avocado, chipotle salsa and some mexi cheese - perfect! Will be making again FOR SURE!

I would use less oil next time. I had my heat too high - I'm not a "seasoned" fryer. Regardless this was an easy, fast, and delicious recipe. Will definitely make again.

This was super easy. I used Weber Steak and Chop seasoning in place of the salt/pepper. The whole family loved it. It will go into our usual rotation

As already mentioned, this is a great basic recipe. Add more or less of whatever spices you prefer. I personally like to dip the chops into the dry mix, then an egg\milk mix, and then the dry mix before adding to the hot oil.

I did this for a family of 5. I used buttermilk and 1 cup of Texas Petes to wet the chop, and seasoned the flour with salt, paprika, garlic salt, and pepper. The family loved it.

I followed this recipe to the letter and my chops turned out wonderful.  Nice crust on the outside and tender/moist on the inside. I did use Rachael Rays Applewood seasoning near the end of cook time.

This was awesome and we all loved it. I mixed in some of morton's season all salt, chef paul poultry seasoning, black pepper and regular salt with the flour  and i rinsed the pork chops under water first and then added garlic pepper and more of the mortons season all salt then coated in the flour mix and deep fried 3 boneless pork chops at 375 for about 8 minutes till they were golden brown.

A simple, fast way to get a delicious meal ready in minutes instead of waiting for the oven to reach temperature and then waiting 35-45 minutes more while the chops bake. The recipe is fine as written, but if you:
1. put the seasoned salt on the chops first and rub it in a bit, and,
2. use panko breadcrumbs, you'll like the result. Shake out some breadcrumbs on a plate and press the pork chops into the crumbs so they'll stick well. Turn the chops over and press some into the other side. If you have bare spots, just sprinkle a few more crumbs onto them and press them in with your fingers. Olive oil and butter 1:1 for frying. Oil should be hot (med-hi or hi burner) and just cover the bottom of the frying pan... I served these with stuffing for pork, corn off the cob and a side salad with vinaigrette dressing.

I made exactly according to recipe except I added the seasoning to the pork chops before flouring.  When frying, the flour came right off so I was worried but they were awesome! I will be making this alot for sure!

This recipe is a good starting point.

I made the following changes, and my pork chops came out great:  

I sprinkled the chops with a rosemary and garlic spice mix.  Then I dipped both sides of the chops into a mixture of ground pepper and flour, then dipped both sides into a shallow dish I had whisked an egg in, and then dipped both sides into a mixture of bread crumbs and italian seasoning.  I fried them in about 3/4 cup of oil, but you may need the full cup depending on the size of your skillet.

Very simple recipe for a starter. I made a few variations. I seasoned the pork chop w/just a little Mrs Dash before dipping in egg/milk, and my coating was with Original Shake n Bake mix plus a few pinches of Dry Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing mix. Dee-Lish!

I read some of the reviews and followed some of the suggestions. I added some lemon pepper after i took them out of the shaker bag, just before putting them in the pan. I also added bread crumbs to the flour. They turned out great. I tried to make fried porkchops several times and had them turn out bland and the crust would fall off in the pan. These were perfect!

This recipe is starving for an egg wash before breading.  This is a very basic recipe.  It could also be improved by a bit more seasoning.  I added garlic and onion powder to the flour the second time and the flavors were better.  If you use a gravy over the chops, this recipe is fine.  If not, add the egg and additional seasonings for flavor.

Very moist and yummy. Had to ad salt and/or homemade honey mustard to make it flavorful though. Next time I will either double the seasoning salt or cut the flour back to 1/4 cup. I had tons of flour mixture left and had four big chops. I used 3/4 inch of veggie oil in a fry pan, next time I'll use peanut oil. Also, I had 1 inch thick chops and fried 6 minutes per side on just a tad lower that med-high so they wouldn't burn. the recipe for the honey mustard was 1/4 c mayo, 1 tbsp honey, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice. I also added a 1/2 tsp whole mustard seed dejon. Yummy! Also good with apple sauce! :-)

I thought it was okay.  The Hubs really liked it though.  Said to give it four or five stars.  Our chops were a bit thicker, maybe an inch or a little thicker than an inch and took a lot longer to cook through.

I did what people hate.  I changed to my liking.  I used breadcrumbs and seasoning that I like.  No egg and milk bath, just breaded and put in fridge for about 30 minutes.  Definately giving it 5 stars for the cooking instructions.  Couldn't have been easier and it was spot on.  Bone in chops, heated 1 cup of oil and cooked 5 minutes per side.  Thank you and forgive the changes.

I modified this a bit. Lots of garlic salt, seasoned salt, pepper, and olive oil (instead of vegetable oil) made these pork chops tender and moist. They were cooked 12 minutes total--8 minutes on one side, 4 on the other, on medium heat.

This was so fast, easy and delicious!!! Mine cooked about 6 minutes on each side and I blotted with papertowel to reduce greasiness. Served with cinammon apples and mashed potatoes!!! My boyfriend finished my plate as well...definitely a keeper!!!! YUM!

These came out alright. The meat was very moist and tender, but it was just very bland. I may try this again with more spices. A dash of cayenne pepper and garlic might make these perfect!

Sorry about cutting off a star but waaaaaaaaay too much oil to fry them in.I used less than 1/2 the amount called for. Otherwise,the flavor is good and the recipe deserves 5 stars.

I added onion and garlic powder and lots of cajun seasoning. It was ok, but I don't know if I'll make it again.

Good recipe.  I did have to add more ingredients.  It sounded too simple.  I added garlic powder, oregano, onion powder, salt and peper.  It came out pretty good.

Good idea with just the flour. No need for the egg or else it'll be too much batter to it. Very tasty.

My husband has been making this recipe for both pork chops and cube steak for YEARS...I was amazed when I saw the exact recipe online.  My family LOVES  this recipe, although VERY fattening...My husband adds a little more fat to the mixture by taking the flour mix and setting some aside in a bowl, sprinking a LITTLE  water in there just to make some balls and throws that in the oil and it makes what we call crispies...they are to die for...only dont try if you have health problems that coincide with REAL fatty things!!!

These were fine - nothing really special, but good. I used olive oil and added a little bit of butter for flavor

OMG are these good!  I have made fried pork chops before and they always turn out horrible and tasteless.  These were AMAZING!!  I used really thick pork chops (1+ inches each), which I really think helped out.  I can't have a lot of fat in my diet, so this is an occasional treat which hubby LOVES!!

Watch these very carefully, mine took much less then 4 minutes to start to burn. I can't imagine that was enough time to cook all the way through so I also baked them in the oven for awhile afterwards.
