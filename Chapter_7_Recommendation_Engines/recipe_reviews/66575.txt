I chose this recipe because it looks very yummy and there were no reviews yet. This was easy to make and the results are delicious! The bread has a very light texture and is full of flavor. I will definitely make this again! UPDATE: My husband has very high standards when it comes to breads... when he got home and tasted this bread, he said, "You could sell this bread!" :) The whole family loved it!

This turned out perfect and I went onto youtube and looked up a video on how to do a 4 strand braid on challah and it turned out beautiful! I have been doing a 3 strand basic challah bread for several years now for Sabbath and was looking for something new and this was it! Love it!

Ive made challah bread before and was disappointed with this one.  I followed the recipe close and thought it wasn't eggy or sweet enough.  I worked for Thanksgiving since it turned out to be a decent bread but definitely didn't wow anyone.

I make this all the time. A wonderful recipe, and very diverse dough. I have made it as cinnamon rolls, buns, and of course as challah bread. Wonderful recipe for novice bakers. Love it. Thank you so much for sharing.

This is a truly beautiful loaf of bread! It came out perfectly the first time. I didn't have quite enough honey, so subbed a few tablespoons of sugar. The egg wash glaze makes this shiyk and look store-bought. I have made many challah recipes, and this one is amazing!

I have been on the hunt for a great Shabbat challah recipe for many years and this one is it! Beautiful flavor and texture. My family now forgoes the bakery bought challah on Friday nights. Thanks for the great recipe!

The bread itself is amazing.  I let sesame seeds soak with the glaze mixture to add flavor and that was tasty.  The only problem is the bread doesn't taste like challah bread should.

Fun to make, a good/ok bread but not the best tasting I've ever had. Drizzled vanilla frosting on top, made a good desert bread or breakfast.

THIS. WAS. AWESOME. I ended up making it twice--once for my household, and again for some friends of mine. I got two loaves out of it, no problem.

I halved the recipe to make a single Challah. We like our Challah sweet so I substituted some of the olive oil for more honey, maintaining the overall olive oil+honey quantity. So if the recipe calls for 1/3 cup olive oil I used about 1/4 cup olive oil and the remainder honey (in addition to the honey already included in the recipe). The Challah turned out sweet and delicious!

I got 1 large 6 strand loaf out of the recipe.  The loaf was approximately 8 inches wide and 16 inches long. It tasted delicious.  Only issue is an aesthetic one: I would have liked more height out of the dough.  I will make it again though.

This recipe was my first attempt at Challah bread.  Make sure you let it cool a little after final baking and wrap in plastic wrap.  The next day it will have that soft challah bread texture that you know and love.  Also make sure to braid like it says or it won't puff up as it should.  We used this to make french toast the next day and it was awesome! Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

It came out nicely (though I was thinking it might be too much olive oil!), thank you for sharing the recipe !

This was an OK recipe, but it really wasn't the sweet, eggy bread that I grew up eating. I tasted the olive oil more than anything else, really. I'm currently trying a new batch with 3 eggs plus one yolk and 1/2c honey, and halving the olive oil. I'm still not sure it'll have enough eggs or sweetness though - if not, I might think about cutting down on the water (which did seem excessive to me), and replacing it with another yolk and more honey. I'll update when I've had time to experiment.

I made one loaf as is and one with soaked raisins and cinnamon that I added in layers as I was kneading. My husband who is in recovery from cancer treatment and surgery was so impressed with how beautiful the braided loaves looked that he took a photo with his phone. He ate more bread tonight than he has eaten of anything in a long time. This is us-> :) (:

I'm going to try one olive/rosemary and one almond/cranberry next time. Outstanding bread recipe- very simple to follow right down to the fancy braidwork which you made easy. Highly recommend to one and all. Thank you so much for posting.

It was delicious, a big hit with picky eaters. I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar, I like it a little sweeter and I was able to adapt it easily for a lactose free treat.

The texture of the bread is perfect, but I wouldn't call this a "decadent" challah. It actually tastes very oily to me. Could use a hint more salt too. I'm going to try round two this evening and use canola oil instead to see if that makes a difference in the flavor. The egg wash is perfect!

I have made this recipe many times and it always turn out nicely.  The bread has a great texture and is delicious alone or with poppyseeds or sesame seeds sprinkled on top after using an egg wash. I have made it with olive oil and replaced it with canola oil and could not tell a difference. I have not tried the glaze.  I use my Kitchenaid stand mixer and let the dough hook knead for about 5 minutes.  This bread makes wonderful French toast and Croque Monsieur sandwiches.  I make it several times a month.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is delicious and easy make. I substituted light agave nectar for the honey because that's what had available. I also watched YouTube videos on braiding the bread. My daughter thought it was the best stuff she has ever had !

This is my go to homemade bread and it is always requested at family get togethers. I have been making it for 3 years and by accident, came upon a trick that brought it to a whole new level. I put my bread in to bake one time and accidently turned off the oven. So, for 30 minutes it baked with the temp. slowly decreasing. Once I realized it, i figured I had nothing to lose, and left the bread in for 15 more minutes, while putting the heat back to 350. The bread then baked for that 15 minutes slowly increasing in temp. The bread rose (proofed) even more beautifully and had a gorgeous golden crust and was soft and perfect inside. I now make this "mistake" every time I bake it!

I used four eggs since its an egg bread two didnt seem enough, also butter in the egg wash and kosher salt.
I confess I used this as a guide like I used more eggs and yeast three packages and used 7 cups of bread flour.
It was good and raised well.

I had never baked bread before, yet alone make a braided loaf!! This recipe is really yummy and super easy to follow. The only thing I'd change next time is the final step, where I will add poppy seeds and sesame seeds after brushing with the glaze.

Just baked this (and ate 3 slices as soon as it was cool enough to slice). This is amazing! I've been using another challah recipe, but I think this is my new go to. I didn't have any honey, but I did have agave syrup and that worked great. I think this might turn in to my go-to dough for other things too.

Great recipe! I used whole wheat flour which I find added an extra heartiness that worked very well with french toast.

This was my first time making Challah bread, and it was so easy!  We live in the Texas panhandle where the climate is very dry and cold (18 was the high the day I made the bread), so my bread wasn't as round and puffy as the original photo. However, the dough rose enough to make two beautiful large  braids.  My family loved it as well as our friends with whom we celebrated Shabbat.  And I followed the recipe exactly as it was given; I also used unbleached bread flour.  It was sweet, soft and delicious...will be making every Friday.

This is a nice bread that made two nice sized loaves.  I love a sweet, light challah, and I found the olive oil made the bread taste a little heavier than I would have preferred.

This was a GREAT recipe- I have attempted to make challah many times and have failed- but this recipe was more cooperative ;-) I would definitely make this again. The only change I made is that I made a "tie dye" challah (I separated out 3 portions and colored them and then braided) It looked AMAZING going into the oven...I haven't tasted it yet but I think it's going to be delicious.

New favorite at our home now! Half of one bread was gone in a couple of minutes while just "tasting!" Definitely going to become a staple now. Thanks a lot for the great recipe.

I was looking for a good bread recipe and hadn't had Challah in awhile, so I opted for this one. I'm glad I did! The flavour is rich and delicious and it has the lovely challah texture I am so fond of! I chose to do a 4 strand braid and baked it on a stone. This recipe finally allowed me to achieve that soft, airy bread I have been striving to make. The crumb is delicate and fine and it pulls apart with a slight stretch to it. I highly recommend this recipe!

Made this. It's tastes ok not decadent. It needs more salt, honey and egg.   Egg wash did not make bread shiny.

This was really, really good.  I've made this several times and it always comes out right.   I made a couple of loaves for my class and everyone (including my teacher!) loved it.  I've already gotten two requests for the recipe.  I'll be making this again tomorrow.   If you're confused about the braiding, I would recommend this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TOKt18P7z4#action=share .  It shows you how to French braid it step by step.  Make sure you fold the ends under, since they usually look pretty messy.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Turned out delicious! I did make a couple of changes. I used 1/2 cup of honey, 3 eggs and only 1/3 cup of oil. The bread was perfect though. My entire family loved it.

Best bread recipe I have found so far, this came out so soft and it looked so beautiful I almost didn't wanna break into it! I added sun dried tomatoes in mine (just because I like sun dried tomatoes really) it gave it an awesome flavor! Me and my partner just ate it with cream cheese to dip and separate olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip, mmm I will be trying out other breads but this for sure will be my go to recipe. Beats store bought bread times a million :) thanks for sharing

This recipe turned out amazing! The instructions were easy to follow, and my family loved it. We don't have a bakery in our town where we can buy Challah. It's nice to know I can make it myself. And the glaze gave it such a sweet taste. I would definitely recommend this!

This was my first time making Challah bread - it was store quality - very good texture and the glaze was added a nice sweetness though i didn't need as much as it called for.
