I used this as a marinade on a pork tenderloin, which I cooked in the oven due to rain.  Absolutely fantastic! I added some fresh thyme and rosemary to it as well.  Might just be my new favorite marinade!

My wife made pork loins with this recipe, using my bees honey, and I like to have made myself sick eating it.  It was by far the best pork she has ever cooked, and she is a great cook!  I wouldn't change a thing!

They were wonderful!  I could have eaten two or even three of these babies!  I marinaded all day. When grilled I love how they develop a little carmelization on them likely because of the honey.  This is a winner for sure!  Will be recommending this often, and making a lot this summer!  (Btw- my teen ate two!)

I have made a lot of marinades for grilling pork from Allrecipes, but this is above and beyond the best recipe I have made! The pic I took was before I basted on the grill. I made grilled country style pork rubs and this marinade made it juicy and very tasty!!! This is now my go-to marinade for ALL pork I will grill!!! This is a must try!!!! I'm glad I did!!!!

I followed the directions and it was delicious. My husband and I think this marinade would also go well with shredded chicken in the crockpot. There should be a nice sauce paired with rice.

I didn't realize I was supposed to marinate the pork for 5 hours so I didn't and they came out very good! Next time I will definitely marinate them.

Gave this recipe a somewhat healthier take and substituted the soy sauce with coconut aminos and the honey with pure maple syrup, and it turned out amazing. Just the right amount of sweet and tangy flavor. I also didn't have enough pork chops so I added in some pork tenderloin instead which I think soaked in the flavor a lot better than the chops. If you plan on air frying this, which I did - it's 280F (140C) for 5 mins on each side for the thinner cuts (tenderloin) and 320F (160C) for 6 mins on each side for the thicker cuts (chops).

Made it last night for dinner, following the directions as detailed except that I refrigerated the pork overnight before broiling (didn't have a grill handy). Found the marinade a bit too sweet (and thin) for my liking. Nothing critical about it; just not my jam. I do think it would probably be better on bone-in chops though, or some meat that has a bit more marbling.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Grilled the pork chops, and they were the super moist and tender.  I could taste all four of the ingredients in the finished product, with the honey being most prevalent.  I will definitely be making this again in the future as it was absolutely delicious!

I've made this twice. First time as submitted. Excellent marinade for juicy pork with subtle flavors. Good balance in ingredients, none overpower the others with the honey adding it's sweet smoothness. Note: The overall flavor will vary depending on which kind of honey you use. I was using an organic orange blossom honey. The 2nd time I added a a slice of fresh ginger and some dried orange peel. Nice little twist on flavor. Next time I think I will also add a few red pepper flakes. Thank you for the great recipe.

I really enjoyed this and I used about 2 Tbs less lemon (juice of 1 lemon). I also cooked to 160 for medium to medium well for my kids. Thank you!

Very good!  We sprinkled the chops with a grilling seasoning mixture before adding the marinade and basted once with the marinade after turning the chops on the grill.  I needed to sub lime juice for the lemon juice.

so simple! only thing i would say is not to cook the pork chop for 15-20mins on the BBQ, if you're cooking for 1 or 2 people! That's totally over cooking them!

I doubled the sauce. I marinated for 7 hours. I basted it and everything. My hubby enjoyed it, but my son and I felt it was a bit bland. I used pork loin chops.  Probably will not make again.

This is a FANTASTIC RECIPE! I made a half recipe because I only had 2 chops and didn't want to save it for another time because I won't be making anything with marinated meat until next week. 

I know I always like to follow the directions as written buy I didn't have any honey! All I had was Agave Nectar. It's approximately twice as sweet so I used half as much! I marinated the chops overnight, it must have been about 15-16 hours in total. My significant other raved about it! My friend happened to stop by and I shared my chop with her. She couldn't get over the flavor and how tender it was! I had to give her the recipe right away. 
When I make it again, I will make sure to have the honey! With the way this recipe is written, it would be a base for many marinades. I would like to add a tablespoon of the following: rice wine vinegar, peanut oil and fresh grated ginger!  If I do, I'll update this review!

I am always looking for different ways to try pork chops and thought I would give this a try.   Overall I thought this was a pretty good recipe, but, it was a little bit sweet for our taste.  If I tried these again I would probably reduce the honey slightly or may even add a little hot sauce or sriracha to the marinade.

I thought the flavor for the amount of effort was excellent!  I had to substitute limes for lemons because we didn't have any lemons, but next time I'll make it as written.

Used this for Pork Chops and it was to die for! Super easy to make and bursting with flavour. I used sesame oil to cook off some peppers, onions, mushrooms and spinach and poured the leftover marinade into them, served with salted new potatoes!

Crowd pleaser! Be careful to keep from burning them. We put them on high for a few minutes, then low until the right temperature is reached. Finish with basting.

Made these last night. I only made two thick pork chops because it was only myself & my husband eating. My very picky husband didn't stop saying how much he loved these chops!!! The only change I made was that I used 4 tablespoons lite soy sauce. Super easy & fast to put together! This will most definitely be a regular meal for us!

I was hesitant to make this because my husband hates soy sauce. But, he loved it!! I only used 3T instead of the 6, and we didn't have any lemons so I used lime. It was fantastic!! I served it with white rice and drizzled the extra marinade over top. Next time, I'll cook the extra marinade just to thicken it a little. But this is a recipe I got permission to make again lol.

Last minute decision to grill pork chops so I did not marinate for 5 hours. I was lucky to get 25 minutes in. I also eliminated the garlic as my family doesn't like garlic. But this was fantastic none the less. I will definitely be making it again...and again...and again...

Used the marinade on a pork tenderloin and grilled it. It was AWESOME.  A little sweet, a little salty, and didn't scorch on the grill. Will be using this marinade again on all kinds of pork.

Delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness with the soy sauce.  This recipe will become a regular in my kitchen.
