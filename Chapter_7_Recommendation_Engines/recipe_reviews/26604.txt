The mixture was runny and I couldn't form a patty with it.  I ended up adding another 1/2 lb of hamburger and the patties still fell apart.  They were very sweet (too sweet imo).  If I were to cook this again I would add 1/3 c Salsa and a only Tablespoon or so of the brown sugar.

This recipe was a failure.  The burgers came apart and when you tried to cook them they burned on the outside.  I tried to cook them in an iron skillrt and they stuck to the skillet because of the brown sugar.  Because of this, I now cannot get the goo off my skillet.

Too much moisture. Kept falling apart,but very tasty, so I threw it in a loaf pan, baked it for an hour and we ate meatloaf!

This was a disaster and a total waste of good hamburger. The patties were runny, no way to form them into patties.  Do not try this recipe.

Not too fancy that is for sure!  It was a mess.  Fell apart, burned, way to sweet.  Sounded good on paper but was really a disaster!

I'm glad I only made a small batch of this for the kids.  It was a sloppy MESS!  They didn't even like it.  I couldn't stand the smell of them cooking.

Just didn't work out for me. While the flavor wasn't hideous, the burgers wouldn't hold together, and they burned before they were done even on lowered heat. Won't be trying this recipe again.

I did not care for this recipe at all!  My children are complete sweet eaters and they were shocked by the outcome of this meal. I would never cook this again. (WAY TOO SWEET)

The raw burger came out too moist and wouldn't hold together.  I ended up frying one as per the recipe instructions and, when it didn't come out the way I expected, I broiled the rest, which worked out a little better.  My husband liked the spiciness of the taste, but we all agreed it was too sweet.  I wouldn't make this one again.

I'd have a hard time believing that ANYONE could make hamburgers with the above recipe.  I followed it to the TEE and just like everyone else it fell apart and burnt.  There was a lot more hamburger to play with so I tried adjusting it to make it work. I added more oats, unfortunately, I only bought enough burger for the recipe, so tripling the amount of ground beef wasn't an option for me, even though it worked for another "tester".

This does not work as FANCY HAMBURGERS.  Making the recipe exactly as written made a ground meat concoction that was too runny and could not make patties.  Instead, I placed it in a loaf pan and made a sweet meatloaf, cooking it for an hour at 350 degrees.  My husband and I would give FANCY MEATLOAF five stars.

I would have never tried this if I had only read the other reviews!  That will teach me.  It made a mess of the grill and we broiled it and it was still more like sloppyjoes.  It was too sweet to taste the other ingredients.

The only thing I did different to this recipe was...I TRIPLED the beef!  And they were good, plus they held up very well in the frying pan.  Yum, tasty!

This burger tasted great.  My only complaint is that we had a hard time getting it to stay together.  It fell apart.  Too much moisture.  Maybe with a little more trying we'll figure it our next time.

I read the previous reviews and decided to add more oats to the mix to ensure they wouldn't fall apart on the grill...to no avail! It ended up being a big mess, probably won't make these again.

I thought the mix would be a little liquid so I put in a little less salsa and ketchup it still was a little too moist but I managed to make thin burgers that were delicious.

Over all it wasn't too bad, like most others, it fell apart. I ended up using about 3-4 cups of oats, added more salsa to drown the sweetness and another egg to help it stick. I may try it again, but vary it my own way.

I had to do a 1/3 of a cup of oats and a few tablespoons if salsa and ketchup to make it not so runny.  Needs 1/4 cup brown sugar as it was to sweet.  It was awesome with those modifications!

Note to self, read the reviews before you try the recipe.  I added a bunch of bread crumbs and they at least held together in the George Foreman,  but they were so loose that they had no chew.

Must have done something wrong.  Too much liquid; burgers would not hold together.  I even put them in the oven for 20 minutes to try and firm them up.  And the sugar led to too much caramelization and burning.  They were barely edible.  I would have been better off making sloppy joes instead of this.

Ah, I was looking for this. I made these years ago and could not remember what the name was. They're hard to form into anything, you have brown sugar and salsa... and oats...

I made these as written and fried them in the skillet. They were just Great! My kids and their friend really liked them. I also liked the little bit of sweetness from the br.sugar. Nice touch. I used 80-20 ground beef and had no problem with them falling part.YUMMO!! I will make these again! Thanks Jessica!
