Interesting mix of ingredients and was a perfect way to use the last of the Bloody Mary mix left over from Thanksgiving day.  Used a roast as that's all I had in the freezer and was not about to venture out in near blizzard/white out conditions for short ribs.  Only two changes based on personal preference....  added garlic and used low sodium beef stock to counter the sodium in the Bloody Mary mix.  Put all into the crockpot and let the smell permeate the house while watching the snow.  Served over rice with a small green salad.  Perfect antidote to turkey after Thanksgiving day. Thanks RCHEISS for the recipe!

As I read the recipe, something kept niggling at the back of my consciousness. I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. There was no garlic in the dish!!! I wept! Then I added 5 cloves of finely chopped garlic to the leeks as I added them to the pot. That was the only change needed. This dish is TOTALLY a keeper! Don't you DARE pass this one up!

OMG!!!!!!!  This dish was absolutely AMAZING!!!! I had to make a couple of changes bc my dutch oven was only 3.1 liters.  I followed the recipe exactly except only used 2 cups bloody mary mix, added 4 gloves smashed garlic. Other than that, I made no changes.  This is the first recipe that I made in my new Dutch Oven.  I served the ribs on the side and other ingredients on top of long grain wild rice with mashed potatoes on the side.  I know... 2 starches but hubby wanted the mashed.  Absolutely fabulous!!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

These short ribs were great!  Suggest low sodium beef stock (bloody mary mix is loaded), 4 clove minced/crushed garlic, 8 oz mushrooms (you can add the stems in also separately) and thicken at the end with 2-3 Tbs corn starch dissolved in water.  Serve with/over thin egg noodles.

Loved this recipe!  Didn't have any ribs on hand so I put a roast in the crockpot and threw all of the other ingredients on top.  The aroma was wonderful all day and the whole family enjoyed.  Thanks for a great tasting recipe!

We nixed the leeks, beef stock, carrots and onions. Swapped half of the canned tomatoes for fresh and the red wine for red wine VINEGAR in much smaller dose. IT WAS AWESOME!!! Think short-ribs creole...mmmm......

Really good. I added garlic and I didn't have Bloody Mary Mix so I made my own using V8 Juice and celery salt, whorchestershire sauce and tobasco to taste.  I also forgot to add the can of tomatoes so it was thick but we ate it up served over rice.

Easy and excellent. The onion, leeks, tomatoes and broth braise the ribs perfectly!

I made this recipe almost as is. Per other reviews I did add garlic, I did not have cloves so I used about 1 teaspoon powder. I also added celery to suit my taste and used baby carrots in lieu of cut whole. The cooking method seemed over complicated to me so I opted to use the slow cooker. I put the ribs at the bottom followed by the vegetables and then the liquids and seasonings. I let it cook on high for 2 hours and then low for the rest of the day, about 8 hours total...I served it freestanding with redskinned mashed potatoes on the side. The rest of the bottle of red wine went great with dinner. It was a California red blend...P.S Use the spicy Bloody Mary mix if you want more kick!

Soo good. I added the garlic and the low sodium stock and it was great. It wasn't very difficult, even for a novice like me. Because of the tomatoes, it was even better the next day. Everyone loved it. This recipe's a keeper :)

use ingredients as directed but tossed it all in the crock pot for the day - added garlic and some cumin. super tender but it needed something - not sure what - a little on the sweet side - could have been the bloody mary mix I used - might try a zippier version next time - and there will be a next time!

After reading the reviews, I added 3 cloves of garlic, before I put everything in the oven. Other than the addition of garlic, I followed the recipe exactly as written. I loved this recipe, and so did everyone else at dinner. This is a definite keeper.  Thanks RCHEISS

This was good if you're into short ribs (they are a little fatty for my liking). I like another reviewer's idea of using a roast, or maybe I'll try it with beef stew meat next time.  Also, in order to fit into my 5 liter Corningware dutch oven, I needed to cut back on the liquids (only used 2 C of bloody mary mix and would also cut back a bit on the wine and beef stock) Also, yield is more like 6 servings.

Delicious! I used a beef roast as that is what I had in the freezer. I added minced garlic, a dash of cumin, didn't use a leek just onions, carrots and potatoes, and cooked in the crock pot for about 8 hours. Well liked by everyone in my house! Will make again!!

Excellent!  Added a picture, one thing I would do different would be maybe to add more carrots and reduce the liquid if using a slow cooker.  I did all the front part in a cast aluminum slow cooker insert on the stove then did the long cook in the slow cooker.  I think my enameled cast iron in the oven would have let just a little more vapor escape and reduce the sauce better.  But I liked the flavor and sopped up the rest of the sauce with a piece of bread!  I lucked out, a local butcher had prime grade short ribs that were incredible.

4.5 stars. Very good. Followed the recipe except I made it in the slow cooker. Will make again but will substitute the short ribs for a less faty beef. A roast would work great.

I made this a couple of days ago and I absolutely loved it. I used Clamato juice, because that's all I had and I added 2 cloves of garlic. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was delicious. I made it in my convection toaster oven in a covered glass dish. I will make it again and I have already given the recipe to some friends.

I absolutely loved the flavor of this dish, but I just couldn't get over the fattiness of the ribs. I even made sure to pick the leanest ribs I could find at the butchers, and it was still too fatty for my family's tastes. I will be making this again, but I will use a roast instead of the ribs.

It was delicious.  My friends couldn't believe it was the first time I made it.  I might try it with different meat next time.  I don't like a lot of fat in my meat.

As long as you can find the short ribs on sale (!), this is a wonderful recipe.  Excellent snowy Sunday dinner.  I do add garlic and onions, but you don't have to.  My whole family loves this!

I have made this recipe several times, and it is outstanding.  I found that I need to use additional butter and olive oil to brown the ribs.  Most of it is absorbed by browning the the onions and leeks.

I am not too particular on the red wine, whatever I feel like having with my meal after it is done.  I think if you use that philosophy, you will not be disappointed.

I added garlic and made my own bloody mary mix.  The recipe came out amazing.   I served it with homemade au jus type gravy.  Excellent!  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this as written, and it was excellent.  Made it again with tweaks, which worked better for our family.  Instead of Bloody Mary mix, I used my old standby , Spicy V8 juice.  I used shallots (cut in half) and eliminated the onion and leeks.  I added garlic cloves, which due to the long cooking time I left whole, and fire roasted tomato’s instead of plain.  There was not a lot of difference in taste - I replaced because these are items I normally have, while the others I do not.  I dropped the temp to 300 and added a 1/2 hour.  IMO, there is too much liquid in this recipe for a crock pot, if using one, I would suggest cutting back by at least 1 cup.  Delicious recipe - thanks.

This was very good! Added 4 cloves of garlic and used some cabernet sauvignon, and it turned out AMAZING with rice. The meat fell right off the bone and it was incredibly tender! It is a lot of work but it got a resounding A+ from my friends!

Would use all 4 pounds of ribs, not 3 and careful not to cook too long.  Meat was falling off bone yet so delicious.  Loved it.

Very good!!  Labor intensive, but really tasty.  My family all enjoyed them - I did add garlic and I didn't have leeks so I used green onion, but still delicious.  Great way to use up the leftover Bloody Mary mix I had!  Thanks!

I followed the recipe and added fresh thyme to the meat after I seared it on all sides. It added to the flavor of the short ribs, carrots, onions & mushrooms! It was an exceptional recipe!

This was wonderful. I didn't have bloody mary mix, used tomato juice  and I added garlic powder and thyme and celery instead of leeks  .No mushrooms and a tish of worst. Some reviewers mentioned the short ribs being too greasy. I wonder if you aren't browning thoroughly?  Delicious!

This time I used a bottom round roast. Sticking with the tomato juice vs. bloody mary mix.  Can't  wait. I will update.

Was very flavorful.  It was a bit greasy though so I strained off the top layer after cooking.  The carrots and mushrooms were really tasty.  Served it over mashed potatoes.

Made this in a slow cooker. Added 2 TBSP of Horseraddish to spice up the Bloody Mary mix. Came out awesome. I made 6 pounds of ribs and they were gone between 5 people.

I  want to try this but has anyone tried it with Vodka, like pepper Vodka or just plain. Just wondering, I will try it out with Vodka and see what happens. (daring I know)  I love Sausage and Vodka cream sauce.
Thanks for the recipe Rich. Will let you know.

Easy recipe that tastes restaurant quality.  Great with mashed potatoes.  Excellent flavor.  I've made the recipe with and without the garlic.  Delish both ways.

Made this in the crockpot on low for eight hours. Added mushrooms on the last hour. Came out great just added garlic...could have used some herb for more flavor. Served with brown rice.
