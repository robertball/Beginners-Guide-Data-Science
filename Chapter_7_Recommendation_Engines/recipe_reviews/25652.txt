I am the submitter of this recipe, and it IS a soup. However, it can be changed easily to make a stew. Increase the meat to 3 to 3.5 pounds. Cut the liquids in half (meaning 1 can chicken broth, one can beef consomme or stock.) Mix 1/2 cup of flour into the cool stock before adding to the pot, then stir until the mixture comes to a simmer, in order to keep it smooth. Vegetables can be tailored to suit your taste. Root veggies are good, like turnip or yams. You can use less onion if you like (should read 2 SMALL onions,) and omit the green beans and mushrooms if you don't like them. Use more or less pepper, as you prefer. THIS RECIPE IS EASILY TAILORED TO YOUR TASTE. i.e. if you don't like lots of onion, cut it back to one. Use more spice if you like stronger flavors, or more garlic if that's the way you like things. Omit the tomato sauce and/or crushed tomatoes if you don't like your soup somewhat tomatoey - if you do, feel free to add some fresh chopped tomato. Cut the vegetables in chunks instead of mincing, if you like it heartier. If you have a crock pot smaller than the largest size, for which this recipe was created, be sure to cut down on your liquids. Use whatever is needed to fill your particular pot to no more than 3/4 full, then STOP ADDING LIQUID. The crock pot should NEVER be filled to overflowing - that's just plain common sense. Important: Taste for salt before serving and adjust as necessary. That should always be your last step before serving any dish.

Good, but it only gets 4 stars because the name is a little misleading.  I expected a beef stew with a bit of tomato flavor, but it was really like a thick minestrone with some chunks of beef.  Very good though.  I had to cut the amount of broth in half because my crockpot was too full.  I loved the fresh green beans in this!  Served with garlic bread.

A really good beef stew!  It has a number of advantages over other recipes - no flouring and browning the meat, lower in fat and calories, and spices other than salt!  Next time I will leave out the tomato sauce - didn't seem to add much except extra liquid.  In order to thicken the stew, though (which was surprisingly thin even with the flour), I had to add 2 tbsp. of corn starch/cold water an hour before eating, and that did the trick.  This makes A LOT, and I think that the amount affects the cooking time - I cooked it for 8 hours on low then 6 hours on high because after 8 hours the potatoes were still hard and the meat still chewy.  Next time I'll go with 6-10 hours on high.  Thanks, Cat!

It doesn't have enough beef to serve as a stew. If you want stew, you'll have to add more flour to thicken up, and increase the amount of beef. Cut the meat and veggies in larger pieces for a stew. About the beef consomme thing, Campbell's makes both a broth and a consomme. The consomme has a more gelatin texture and deeper flavor/color.

This was a huge hit!  Great for a cold winter day!  Seasonings were just right.  Next time, I will add 1/2 bag of frozen corn, and a little more meat.  Also, I put in more flour at the end to thicken the gravy.

I completely agree with the previous comments regarding the amount of liquid. I used much less - I made this with 16oz stewing meat, and ended up using one can of beef broth, one can of diced tomatoes, and a maybe 2/3 of the tomato can filled with water. I followed the recipe exactly, and thought it was quite bland. So I added more freshly-ground black pepper, some Italian seasoning, and an Oxo cube, which helped, but it was still lacking something. I think maybe a few cups of red wine, reduced during the cooking time, might have helped. Overall, I thought this was good but not great.

The flavour of this stew was amazing, and it was so nice to come home to the smell of delicious(but healthy) stew!  The only thing I would change, is to reduce the amount of liquids, it was thicker than soup, but had just a touch too much liquid for the amount of veggies and beef.

Great recipe! I will cut down on the liquids a bit next time because there was too much gravy left. Excellent flavor though. Thanks for sharing!

This turned out very much like a soup, even after adding some corn starch as suggested by another reviewer. The flavor was also a little weak and a little too much like tomatoes. There was also not nearly enough meat. Also, why call it beef consumme instead of beef broth? The meat that was there was great, and it definitely scores points for being healthy, if you're into that.

I left out the green beans (ever notice how cooking things with green beans makes everything taste like green beans?) and added another four ounces of mushrooms and a few fresh tomatoes (since they would have gone bad by the next day). It was very tasty, even though I forgot the flour the first time I made it and it was more of a "soup" than "stew". Still tasty!

Honestly, I didn't mind the "extra" liquid. That's what cornbread is for! : ) However, if you must, you can also thicken it up a little by adding some potato flakes.

Soup, stew, who cares. It is fantastically delicious. One of my favorite recipes. The only changes I make are minor. I saut√© the onion and mushrooms in a little garlic then seared the meat before adding to the crockpot. I add enough of the liquids to cover the meat and potatoes and then set the remainder on the counter to be added as it cooks IF needed. I serve with homemade french bread.

I gave this five stars because it is so tasty AND really low fat. Only (5) points per serving for Weight Watcher participants....and it will fill you up!

I also used fresh thyme and marjoram sprigs while it was cooking and then removed the stems before serving.

Great meal for us cold-weather people!

I found this stew/soup to be more stew than soup.  The broth was pretty thick.  After following the directions without alterations, I found it to be okay, but it isn't something I'd make again without some changes.  I wasn't very fond of the crushed tomatoes, but the rest of the ingredients seemed to work together well.

Recipe was pretty good.  I followed other reviewers and skipped the tomato sauce and even then it was very thin.  It was a lot of stew, thankfully I have a five quart crockpot, it just fit.  I also added browning and seasoning sauce to it because of all the flour I added lightened it up too much.

Excellent!  Extremely flavorful.  We left out the beans and mushrooms but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  I ate some after 6 hours and the potatoes weren't quite soft enough yet, so I'd definitely go for 8 hrs.

Got pressed for time so I didn't follow the recipe exactly, like cooking it in a pot and using meatballs. But turned out great, everyone kept going back for more! Definitely will make again... but I'd still stick to the meatballs, they turned out great.

This was allright, good but not GREAT. As a basic beef vegetable soup goes, this was perfectly fine. My fianc√© and I found this to be pretty bland (I even bought fresh (dried) spices just for this, so I know it wasn‚Äôt due to them being old, etc.). I‚Äôve made many slow cooker soups like this, and I have to say that out of all of them, this is the best by far tho.... The addition of fresh green beans is a nice touch. And if for nothing other than simplicity‚Äôs sake, this is deserving of 5 stars, but because I always rate on taste, I can only award 4 stars. I will definitely keep this in my rotation, but will have to tinker around a bit next time to suit my / our tastes. Here are my suggested changes: 1) substitute ground beef for stew meat (browned / drained first!) or use finely chopped beef chop suey meat ‚Äì my grocer sells beef this way. I cut my big stew chunks of beef into bite-sized pieces anyways (I think large chunks of meat go perfectly with stew and smaller pieces pair nicely with soups). 2) DOUBLE THE SPICES! 3) Salt to taste - PERIOD! 4) Try sweet potatoes or a combination of sweet / Russet potatoes next time. 5) As I did this time, cut my carrots into slices and my celery into a small dice (mincing both seemed odd to me...). All in all, this was a fine SOUP, perfect for a chilly ‚Äúfall is almost here‚Äù evening. Adding a loaf of warm, crusty French bread completed our meal. Thanks for sharing, Baricat! :-)

This was a very tasty dish, however, it didn't fit in my crockpot.  I had to remove some of the potatoes, and did not add the 2 cans of beef stock.  I will make it again, but not as written, or will half the recipe.

I didn't want it too soupy so I only added 2 cans of broth, rather than the 4. But in the end it just didn't have the comfort food flavor profile that I was craving. Too much tomato flavor; I would have preferred it to be beefier. Also, I had cooked it just over 6 hours and it needed probably another hour at least to get every bite to soften. Some pieces of beef and carrots were still a bit tough.

This was good but I tweated it a bit. I didnt put in any of those liquids requested. I did all the vegetables except the mushrooms since I didnt have them and switched beans to peas, again it was what I had. I put 1/2 cup of red wine, a can of tomato soup and enough regular chicken broth to cover the meat/veggies cooked it for 10 hours on low. When I got home I dumped the can of peas and about a tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it a bit. I let it be for a few mnutes and it was perfect. didnt even need salt!

This one takes a little while to get everything chopped up, but the flavors and textures are outstanding when it is done!

I am going to review this in 2 stages. I wanted a beef "soup" so I am trying to use "all" recommended liquid.  I am currently cooking the recipe now.  I have a very very LARGE crockpot.  I can't use all the liquid!!!  I overfilled my crockpot at 75% of liquids in recipe. Currently I have 23 ounces of chicken stock and 14 ounces of beef.  With everything else, it is overflowing!  My 2nd complaint is the amount of onion.  It took so long to get everything chopped/diced (smaller for soup) that I have started this on high but after 2 hours it just taste like onion.  The rest is bland at this point and I hope it gets better over the next 5 hours.  I will update then but currently I warn all, following the exact recipe will cause overflow of your crockpot. For those looking for a stew you won't use all the liquid anyways but for those who did want a good chunky soup, be warned. update:  This was a horrible attempt. Nothing went right from beginning to end.  It was bland, overflowing my pot.  In the end it was so bad to save what I could of this expense I had to add so much in seasoning that it wasn't this recipe. I probably should have realized this since all the reviews of a great soup were after many had made enormous changes to the original recipe.

Very good, I doubled the spices for a bolder flavor; I also used a pound of tenderized round steak cut up and still felt it needed more meat.  My husband loved it with delicious bread.

I love how easy this is! I changed the recipe a bit--left out the mushrooms, only used 1 onion and 2 cloves of garlic. For the meat, I used one round steak cut into cubes. Instead of cans of broth, I just made it from bouillon--but be sure to let the chicken stock cool completely before adding the flour. The last time I made this, I left out the tomato chunks but added more water to compensate. To me, the consistency is more like soup, and I've frozen all 12 cups for a hearty meal in the winter.

This made a really good soup, not so much a stew. After reading other reviews, I decided to leave out some liquid, so I only put one chicken broth in and left out the tomato sauce. The result was some really velvety soup. I also put in a pound of stew meat instead of 3/4, and cut my vegetables larger, rather than dicing like the recipe recommends. This fit perfectly in my 5 quart crock pot, and was definitely ready after one hour on high and 8 on low.

We make this beef stew all the time during the fall/winter season. We always double the meat. It takes longer to prepare than 20 minutes, about 1 hour. Sometimes we add 1 more can of tomato sauce, to change up the flavor. Great with a fresh french bread loaf.

It was great.  Makes a ton though.  I had to transfer it from the slow cooker to the stove top because it would have taken much much longer than 6 hours.  Otherwise, very tastey.

This was so thin and runny and it tasted like Campbell's tomato soup with beef & veggies tossed in.  I will not make this dish again.

I made this as directed except used a 28 oz of crushed tomatoes and no tomato sauce only because you can't buy a 14 oz of crushed tomatoes here and I didn't want to waste it.  My hubby thought it was okay but I didn't like it all. It just tasted like tomato soup with some stew beef thrown in.  Won't be repeating this.

Nothing special; a soup that taste like stew. It's alright, but nothing impressive.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was a very good stew! I'm in agreement with the other reviewers, WAY too much broth that comes out like a soup. I would halve the broth and consomme and tomato sauce, and add a little bit more flour to the mix. Also, I started at about noon, and it wasn't ready for dinner so we left it on low over night and all day the next day and it came out great.

I love this stew.  I reduced the chicken broth and beef consomme both by half a can.  Also, about an hour before this was done I added 1tbsp of cornstarch mixed with half a cup of water to thicken it up a bit more.  I also took the mushrooms out the second time I made it. Wasn't a fan.

Not bad, but I thought it was a little bland. I didn't add potatoes, I used quinoa instead--doesn't get mushy and is high in protein. I also added some red wine to it, and cooked it all on low in my crockpot overnight.
