For those of you unfamiliar with Thai and Vietnamese cuisine, their springrolls are not crispy like Japanese or Chinese springrolls. The meat(if any) is cooked before being rolled in the wrapper. The veggies are normally raw or(rarely) lightly steamed. They're like a little salad in a wrapper. I love them in summer. In Thai cooking springrolls use a rice paper wrapper and is eaten raw, eggrolls use a thin wonton(wheat paper) wrapper and is eaten fried. What may have confused some of you is that the recipe just says springroll wrappers. The chinese ones are wheat and are not meant to be dipped in water but fried. The thai and vietnamese ones are rice, stiff and meant to be softened in water and eaten raw. In my area the package just says rice paper, nothing about springrolls.

Very easy to make.  Found the spring roll wrappers at the grocery store in the organic foods section--they were a lot easier to use than the clear-ish looking rice paper wrappers from the Asian food aisle.  Made these for a lunch for a group of people--got excellent reviews.  Very fresh taste.

They were amazing, I followed the recipe almost to a tee. The only thing I did differently is I put everything in the marinate over night, then put them in the wrappers the next day and cooked them in the oven at 350 for 7 minutes. They were delicious.

I made these for a dinner party and everyone loved them! I split the marinade in two and used half (pre-cooked, frozen) shrimp and half chicken. I also used arugula instead of watercress (due to availability) - I only needed 5 oz, not a whole pound! I kept everything else the same and prepared it exactly as instructed. I was doubtful it was going to all come together, but they surprised me! Just do what was the recipe says, wrap em tight, and dip away! I made everyone wrap their own for fun:-) Will DEFINITELY make again!

I love this recipe and have made it many times. Its so versatile! I have added thinly sliced red pepper which looks great too! I use the smallest size of wrapper and find I can make 2 dozen--perfect for appies! Also tastes great with sweet chili thai sauce for dipping.

These were awesome! I did find that using spring roll wrappers were a little better as they are a little thinner. Someone mentioned that it was odd that these weren't fried. Not all spring rolls are fried, and some places called the unfried ones summer rolls, they aren't made to be crispy as there are crispy components inside the roll. This is also why this recipe is served with peanut sauce, the tradition dipping sauce for the non fried variety.

I found this to be a really good recipe. I used arugula as suggested by another review. I served them as is without cooking because the recipe doesn't mention cooking! My husband didn't care for them at all. The next day I deep fried the leftovers and he loved them. I will put in less bean sprouts next time as the flavor is stronger after frying. Now I will make big batches and freeze them....

Used Todd's Famous Thai Peanut Sauce (AR recipe) for the chicken filling and served it on the side as well.  Had a lot of the watercress mixture left over, so I'd cut that in half in the future.  Recipe said to  mix long slices of the carrot into the watercress mixture, but I don't see how that would work for the spring roll filling, so I did a coarse shred on the carrot.  Same comment on the bean sprouts, cut them up a bit.  Takes a little bit of practice using the rice spring roll wrappers, but although they may not have been pretty, they tasted great!

These were delicious! I found it a little strange that the recipe made no mention of frying them at the end. So I made them to see what they'd be like and felt they needed frying or they didn't have that crispyness that spring rolls have! Once I fried them, they were wonderful and very easy to make.

These are really, really good.  They took me awhile to "perfect," but after I've made them a few times, they turn out great.  I usually use a lot less watercress and more cilantro just because watercress is extremely expensive where I live.  The only suggestion I have is to just wet the corners of the spring roll wrappers when rolling them instead of dipping them in water.  They would fall apart and get too mushy for my liking when dipped.   Roll them up, THEN brush them with a bit of water to soften them up.  YUM!

This is a great recipe.  I personally don't like watercress in it, but this recipe is so versatile to suit different tastes.  I would strongly recommend using chicken thighs, however.  They should be cut very fine.  I also like to sprinkle some crushed peanuts in each one.  Sometimes I put some fresh cucumber in it too.

This was a HUGE hit at our Mother's Day lunch. We had a little trouble finding the spring roll wrappers- we had bought wonton and egg roll wrappers before we read the comments on here. We tested both (despite what the other reviewers had said) and it was disgusting as promised. In a desperate attempt to find something suitable, we grabbed some lumpia wrappers in the freezer section and were amazed to find it was EXACTLY what we were looking for- it even said spring roll wrappers on the box! I wouldn't suggest dunking the wrapper in water- it falls apart. Instead, just seal it with a dab of water. If you are unfamiliar with peanut sauces, I would recommend House of Tsang Bangkok Padang Peanut Sauce; it has a nice flavor. We refrigerated the chicken overnight and it was wonderful. Though admittedly, we never tried 30 minutes like the recipe suggests- I assume it would work as well. We weren't able to find the vegetables in the right amount, so we used what we could and kept the ratio the same. We also chopped our snap peas. I don't believe the recipe ever specifies whether they are supposed to be chopped or whole. Though, I don't think that would make or break a recipe anyways. We will definitely be adding this recipe to our repertoire.

This was just like the real thing! I didn't have watercress, so I used chard instead. You could probably use lettuce, spinach, or any leafy green. I paired this with Indonesian satay.

This is so delicious. I'm not a fan of peanut sauce so left if out. Bag of coleslaw mix makes a great filler with chicken and green onion and shrimp also.

I have tried a few spring roll recipes and this is my favorite so far. I had to make a few adjustments since grocery store didn't have all ingredients: I subbed baby kale for watercress and I hate canned sprouts, so left them out (excited to make this in the spring when I can get them fresh though). Made my own peanut sauce using a simple recipe on this site. Put in a full cup of cilantro since I love it. Dipped rolls  in sambal olek (chilli paste) since peanut sauce really stuck to the chicken. Next time I plan to add lemongrass to make them even better and will mix the chilli paste in with the chicken just to make it easier to eat.

SO GOOD! These spring rolls were delicious, and easy to make. Instead of just eating them plan I also dipped them in some peanut sauce for some extra flavor.??

I made a peanut sauce from this site.  I had to sub watercress for Arugula, and bean sprouts for vermicill rice noodles, since my local stores have been out of both for weeks now, and would get any watercress for a few more weeks.  But my hubby just didn't care for the combination of Peanut butter and chicken, he ate two and I had to give the rest away.  Also I found out that he doesn't really care for rice paper either.

It was delicious! I did change a few things. I used wonton wrappers  instead of the rice paper, I don't like the texture of the rice paper. Also I mixed a little of the peanut sauce in with the veggies along with some fresh chopped ginger and minced garlic

I really liked this; we used spinach instead of watercress and I added cucumbers.  I would also add avocados, if you like them.  My hubby said he would prefer with a wasabi/soy sauce rather than the peanut sauce.

Great recipe. Hubby found the texture odd. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to assemble the actual rolls. I left out the watercress, cilantro, & bean sprouts (since I chose to make this last minute & didn't have them in my kitchen). Instead I used fresh spinach, red peppers, and powdered ginger. It turned out great, and I love that you can sub this or that to tailor the recipe to your tastes.

The flavors were good. My husband and I enjoyed the meal a lot, but it was a lot of work for a meal that was only “good.” I made my own peanut sauce instead of using store-bought, which helped with the flavor. I also would cut the chicken into smaller chunks if I made this again.

This recipe calls for one pound of watercress. That is a huge amount. Overall this is not that great a recipe. Cutting chicken in one inch chunks and trying to get those in a rice wrap is not easy. It's not bad; just something I'm not going to try again.
