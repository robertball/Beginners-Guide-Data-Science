Really good, for something that is not chocolate. The peachiness is really present.. no mistaking it. I'd like to try this with other fruits sometime

The recipe itself was easy to follow BUT, there is a KEY step that NEEDS to be added to the directions: 

Right after it says this: Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. 
It then needs to say this: After you take it out of the frig, you NEED to let it sit until room temperature. 

Otherwise no amount of work will not get that plastic wrap off that stuff! I can't believe the author neglected to add this KEY piece of info. Ugh! If it were not for a happy accident  I would not have figured this out and would have thrown this delectable, confection away!

It requires 3 oz. of pectin NOT 3 Tbsp.  As it is written here; the recipe makes peach jam.  For candy, the pectin MUST be increased to 3 oz.  When corrected; it makes a delicious candy. I wasted a lot of time attempting to set it before discovering the error.  I was able to put the "jam" back on the stove the following day and add the remainder of the pectin and make the candy.

Since Chef John's recipes are always fantastic, I'm assuming mine not gelling up was due to user error. It tasted great, but I did struggle with a few of the steps. First of all, I couldn't get the peaches to blend without some added water. I took Martin C's advice and used 3 oz of pectin instead of 3 T. My package was 3 oz. I started with 3 T, and it just didn't seem like enough, so I added the rest. I also didn't use a thermometer in Step 4 -- just kind of kept it at a bubbling simmer. As I said the end product was delicious -- but I made jam, not candy.

These were great!  I made them as directed, but I used frozen peaches (just not in season right now).  I would love to know how to modify for other fruits, such as lemon & raspberries.  As there is different levels of pectin in these fruits, my guess is that the additional pectin would need to be adjusted.
