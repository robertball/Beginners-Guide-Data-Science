Our family enjoyed this recipe.  I had to change a couple of things (I know, I know) because I did not have all of the ingredients on hand.  I used bacon instead of ham. YUM! I also used monterey jack cheese but I would try sharp cheddar cheese next time. I didn't have any basil so I chopped fresh rosemary and added it to the egg mix.  It was so delicious and added a fresh herb flavor that made the dish, IMO.

I'm trying my hardest at lowering my carb intake as well as getting in as many healthy ingredients/vegetables I can. Instead of potatoes, I subbed chopped cauliflower. I used half whole eggs/half egg whites, turkey ham and 2% sharp cheddar. Filling breakfast. My family noticed that their was cauliflower in it, but noone said anything. (Mom's just know.) I'd make this again. I liked it a lot.

This is really, really good.  I made it the first time as written and it was delicious.  The second time, I cubed the potatoes and let them get pretty well browned, increased the onion to 1/2 cup, and I used only gruyere cheese because that was all I had.  OMG! - to die for!  I love to serve this with sliced tomatoes.

An excellent recipe. Based on preference I changed a few things. I cut the stalk of asparagus into 1 inch pieces and the tips in 2 inch pieces. I cooked them separately in boiling water stalks -3 minutes, then add tips + 2 more minutes.  3/4 cup onion. For six eggs- 1/4 cup is not enough.  My husband said "one of my best dishes"

This was a lot of work and not worth the trouble.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was very bland.  The potato gets lost somewhere - volume probably would be better using those frozen shredded hash browns if you can eat them.  I may use the ingredients again, with more onion and no potato and just add beaten eggs to the mix in the skillet to cook, like an omelette.  A lot less work, dishes, mess and quicker.

This is a fabulous recipe.  My husband loved it.  For those health conscious folks - I used Egg Beaters and spicy turkey sausage and it came out absolutely perfect.. I sprinkled dried basil on top as I didn't have fresh on hand.  We will definitely make this again.

Recipe with lots of flavor.  I made 2 changes to this, I omitted the ham because I wanted this for a side dish and I cooked it on the stovetop rather than the oven.  It was over 90 degrees and I didn't want to heat the house.  My husband who does not like asparagus really enjoyed.  Nice to know that this does work on the stovetop too.  Thanks Angela for sharing.

This was not worth the time and effort.  The potatoes took too long to brown & they ended up in clumps.  After 10 minutes of trying to get the asparagus tender, I had to remove ALL the asparagus and tenderize it in boiling water.  At the price of asparagus I was not going to throw it away.  My advice is to blanch the asparagus till tender, then add it to the potatoe mixture.  This took away some of the seasonings.  I topped it with a 4 cheese Italian shredded cheese.  I managed to salvage the dish.  I rated it only 2 stars because it was slightly bland, but too, too much trouble.  I have had better asparagus, potato frittatas.  I will NOT be making this again.

I'm not sure why people have difficulty with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of halving the entire thing so I used a 9x9 pan and using egg substitute instead of real eggs.  Hubs and I loved it!  My asparagus was very thin and tender so it didn't take long to cook with the potatoes, onions and ham.  That is possibly a problem for those who have larger stalks.

I made this recipe for my dads birthday. I changed it a bit. He likes sausage and prefers Spanish. It worked out great! I added a little bit more of everything. I also added some uncle tonys to spice it up. I needed to feed a lot of people.I also added some swiss cheese. I was worried about is burning so I cooked it covered for 20 mins and then uncovered for 8 mins.

My family loved this recipe.  I used frozen O'Brien hash browns (with onion and peppers already mixed in).  I cooked it in a skillet that can go in the oven, so after all was mixed together, just used the one pan for the oven.  Since the skillet was hot, it didn't take quite as long to cook.  I will make this again, especially when we have company spend the night.
I believe you could also sub broccali and add in some mushrooms if you would like.   Very good!

Good recipe. I used the recipe as a base and added and changed a few things; and it turned out really well.  I think that is what makes it so good, you can make it a really flexible recipe, and it doesn't have to specific.

I thought this was delicious.  I subbed a few things for what I had on hand, but I don't think it changed the flavor.  I used a package of thawed, shredded hash browns for the potatoes and I used 4 eggs (all I had left) and the rest liquid egg whites.  Whole family loved it.

I wrote on facebook...but after rereading the recipe,I have a few suggestions. To be more Italian in flavor...add scallions and parsley..I do not use cheddar nor mozzarella...why..just to Americanize the dish? A minimal mix in of parmigiano is sufficient.I do not place in oven ...merely cook slowly on range top...and when looking firm on top ,flip over on a dish and slide back in to pan...non stick..and firm up the bottom.

This was a failure for me because the grated potatoes stuck to and burned on the bottom of my pan.  I'll not make this again, but I will say it tasted good and my daughter even liked it.  Perhaps if I had started instead with thinly sliced potatoes, the procedure would have gone better. Who knows?

As others have said, excellent base for a tasty throw together of whatever you want to use up in your fridge.  I used spinach and half a bag of hash browns.  Also put sliced tomatoes as a layer underneath the cheese.  Get creative with this one!

I thought this dish  was awesome and it was well received by my clan. I made the following changes:  
•  Used 8  large  eggs & 1/4 cup milk
•. Doubled the diced onion
•. Diced the potatoes into 1/2 inch dice instead of shredding
•  Added a generous 1/2 tsp of ground mustard to the egg mixture (just perks up the cheese and egg  flavors)
Followed the method as otherwise prescribed. This was delicious warm and It was fine at room temperature.  It also rewarms well in the  microwave.  Next time I may add some thyme to the eggs instead of adding the basil.  Thanks for posting this!

This was good. Yes, changes were made due to what I had on hand. I didn't have a 9x13 pan-so it was made in an 8x8 & it was fine. No idea if that would be typical but I had thrown the 9x13 away & not replaced it yet! Per other reviewers I did add seasoning, Penzey's Tsardust. I had a vegetarian& limited time so I had to leave the ham out. Used thawed frozen mixed veggies I had to use up since no asparagus. Used Asiago & Parnesan cheeses& it smelled wonderful! Very popular here. I liked being able to use the potatoes I already had. That was great!

My first frittata.  Read some suggestions on reviews  and used frozen hashbrown potatoes to cover the pan. Added fresh jalapeno to the onion as well as some additional spices such as paprika that go well with egg.   A mix of  white cheeses go best with the ham and asparagus even pepper jack.  This is one to follow your instincts with according to what your family likes.  Will make again for sure.

I browned frozen shredded hash brown potatoes in a cast iron pan and then followed the directions except made it all in the same cast iron pan which I used for the baking part. It was delicious!

Next time I would maybe cook the potato/onion/ham seperate from the asparagus just for handling ease. To be fair, it came out just fine. Subbed the white cheese for pepper jack. Very tasty!

This was my first time to make a frittata and it was wonderful. I substituted turkey polish kielbasa (youngest will not eat pork or beef). My kids ate the whole pan and asked if I would go to the store and buy the ingredients for more...right now.

It's edible, but fairly bland to my taste, even with spices and cheese.

Nice and easy breakfast.  Asparagus gives it a different flavor.

I used individual-sized casserole dishes, which reduced baking time to 10 minutes, and I used  Swiss cheese in place of mozzarella, because Swiss goes well with ham, and I didn’t have mozzarella. It was very good: Not make-it -often good, but good enough that I would make it again, especially if I happened to have leftover ham and asparagus on hand.

Can't do lactose, so subbed water for milk--no problem.  Also wanted chunks of potato, so I sliced about 1/4 inch thick bite-sized pieces and microwaved them for 3 minutes or so before adding to asparagus, etc.  Also subbed mushrooms in place of ham so as not to eat those cute little piggies.  Finally, we thought Jarlsberg cheese would be a nice compliment, so used that in place of mozzarella/cheddar.  The strength of this recipe is that you can suit it to your needs and it works perfectly!   Thank you!

I had some girlfriends over for brunch and used this recipe. 
I served this in a colorful dish ... it was beautiful and every drop of it was eaten.

I did steamed the asparagus first and than added it to the cooked potatoes.  I also bought frozen hash browns and cooked them in a skillet (although I am going to try substituting that with cauliflower next time).

I also substituted the ham with Bacon.  And I bake the bacon in the oven so it's more crispy.  

It does take some prep time - it's a perfect recipe and very tasty.

This recipe is worthy of Kerrygold white cheddar. I used Japanese bacon, which is a thicker cut, and frozen asparagus, since I was unable to find fresh. I had some trouble with the potatoes sticking to my cast iron skillet--perhaps I needed more cooking oil. We enjoyed the meal. I am looking forward to preparing it again with fresh asparagus. Would also taste good with chopped cauliflower or broccoli.

Made the recipe pretty much as written, but added bacon since we had some, and really, when does adding bacon ever make anything worse? :D  It came out great and gave me a good excuse to buy more asparagus at the farmer's market.

My husband and I loved this easy dish. Be sure to cut off quite a large amount of the woody asparagus stem after weighing one pound....the first time I made it the asparagus was a bit tough and stringy....didn't faze my husband one bit. Good warm or cold. I made it Vegetarian by cubing a package on Yves veggie ham. I also used a veggie substitute for half of the cheese....delicious!

The only problem I had is common in egg recipes that include ham, the moisture in the ham tends to separate the eggs a bit. Also a little bland. I will try again with some other fresh herbs.

I did not have ham so I substituted bacon. I fried the bacon and removed most of the bacon grease before I sautéed the vegetables. I also substituted sweet potatoes for the white potatoes. The dish was tasty and would make an easy and quick brunch dish.

OK, I always monkey around with any frittata recipe, so what I wound up with was delicious for my family. Honestly, though, I didn't change much. I added some canadian bacon. Otherwise, everything like the recipe posted here. Delish!

I served this at a small luncheon. I made it without the ham. The guests there enjoyed it very much! My husband and I had the leftovers. Although we liked it, I do think adding the ham would make it better. It's a great dish to serve when you're feeding vegetarians.

It  was  good but not great. It was a little flat and I used 2 extra eggs. Next time I will use a smaller dish. Also when I was frying the potatoes they  stuck together in clumps. I think the frozen hash browns would work better. We certainly loved the asparagus in that  dish. A very good combination.

I made it with all ingredients listed. I didn't use hash browns but chopped potatoes into chunks and parboiled, also steamed asparagus for a few minutes then followed instructions. Added these steps because some mentioned hash browns were a flop and another mentioned asparagus under cooked. thought it was delicious! I will make again and again!

We liked this very much. I did add garlic powder and think next time I'll add some smoked paprika. Just needed a bit more flavor. Served with sliced tomatoes per another reviewer; baked them a few minutes first. Over all it was easy, quick and enjoyable. Thanks for this nice idea!

Excellent! Hubs and I loved it. I had asparagus that needed to be used up and this recipe came across my radar. I had freeze-dried hash browns on hand that I hydrated the night before. For additional flavor, I added some garlic powder along with the salt and pepper. I can't believe I didn't have mozz. cheese on hand, but Colby/Jack worked great. Finished with a light sprinkle of bacon salt along with dried basil. Will definitely make again.

This was crazy awesome. I used bacon instead of ham and wow! I also had some French's Crispy Jalapeños so I threw those on the top for the last two minutes in the oven. Gave it a really nice kick! I thought it was an awesome dinner and now I have leftovers to go with my fruit and coffee in the morning. A real winner!!
