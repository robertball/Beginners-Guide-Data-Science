This a great spin on traditional pesto's. I did not have the fresh basil and so used dried (about 1/8 of a cup), used chili powder as I did not have red pepper flakes on hand, added 1 clove of garlic as suggested and used a whole red pepper. I blended all the ingredients together and added small amounts of olive oil till it was to the consistency i wanted. Severed over chicken and pasta. It was well recieved by my husband and young boys. Will make it again this summer when I have fresh basil. This is a good pesto recipie for those who can't have nuts.

I first made the recipe as written and it wasn't entirely to my liking. After adding more fresh basil (I nearly doubled it), a clove of garlic, salt, a bit more crushed red pepper, and a few pine nuts, it was delicious! With the modifications, I'd give it five stars.

I added more red pepper and had to add more olive oil to get the right consistency.  Good on bread.

This came out way too watery since the red pepper exuded extra moisture. I added more basil and also added garlic for flavor. It's a good idea, fundamentally, but the recipe has to be tweaked in order to achieve the proper consistency.

Great recipe! Made it up and served it with a variety of crackers. After tasting, following recipe exactly, I added two table. pine nuts, just because I like them. I then blended it altogether until smooth. Delicious. This would be great as a condiment for sandwiches (chicken or turkey perhaps, and definitely on grilled portobella mushroom sandwiches). Also good served over baked potatoes. Very easy to make. If you like it hotter, add more of the hot red pepper flakes or some hot sauce. As is, it was perfect for my tastes. Would also be good with a little onion added to it, or if you like garlic a bit of garlic. You don't want to lose the pepper taste, however. The freshness of the vegetable really shines through in this recipe.

LOVE this recipe!  I've used it in a couple of different ways and think each is better than the last!  Great to experiment with!

I followed the recipe as given, but forgot to put in the black pepper. It still came out great. I will definitely make this again!
