I'm an expirimental baker, so i made a double batch. with one batch i added about 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, and the other was the recipe. My familt and friends preferred the cinnamon apples before they were baked, but the strawberry ruined the flavor of the cinnamon.

Overall, if you add the  cinnamon don't use strawberries.

Show stopper! Personal preference: needs to be sweeter - and that's an easy fix. I did brush a light coating of jam for color effect. Used Pink Lady apples and a mandolin for cutting. Covered with parchment and aluminum foil for 28 minutes and uncovered last 2 minutes. I made one directly in the muffin pan and one in an aluminum muffin paper placed in the muffin pan. Both cooked equally well and both were easy to remove (I sprayed with Pam and floured each.) These seem much healthier than apple pie.  I omitted the brown sugar - but will add next time. Mine weren't gooey. Thanks for the recipe!
