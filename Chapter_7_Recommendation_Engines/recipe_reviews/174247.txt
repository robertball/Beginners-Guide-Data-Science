This recipe was really good, as written, but it needs a bit of tweeking on the cooking time.  It took MUCH longer than stated for the chicken to cook with everything inside, and mine never got to the stated temp (but the chicken was cooked through...just the stuffing wasn't at that temp- which may be a food hazard!  I think a way to remedy that would be to follow the first steps up to after you make the sauce.  Then, I'd pour the sauce over the chicken, cover it, and cook it in the oven for 20-30 mins at 375.  That would also ensure that the raw onions and garlic in the cream cheese were cooked.  On taste, this recipe is five stars- just not quite the right way to make it!  I'll definitely make it again!  I served it over rice, and as another reviewer said, there's a TON of sauce, but it helps with the cooking and keeping the meat moist, I'm sure!

It was  a five star for us.   The recipe says  cook time at the top of the recipe.  30 minutes.   That is pretty much true.  I did as it directed when I was simmering it in the sauce. I simmered it for about 20 to 25 minutes.  I don't understand  why it says  5 minutes when you return it to the sauce.   It should be  about 20 to  25 minutes.   I served it with a great tossed salad, while our  Fettuccini was cooking  I served it with the  Fettuccini and Asparagus.  We both loved it.  I will make it many times again.  I got the Prosciutto at Wal-Mart for 3.00.  Very tender, not overcooked.  It leaves a wonderful aftertaste.  You can roll them and refrigerate them (I tied them with string) and just do the cook them while you are making your salad and Vegetable.    I  am eager to have them for dinner  tomorrow.   Just the  two of us so I have good leftovers.

Very tasty!  My local market was out of prosciutto, so I improvised and use bacon.  I was concerned that the chicken might be lacking in flavor by doing so, but it was great even with the substitution.  To cut calories; I used cornstarch for my thickening agent, which allowed me to omit the butter.  The gravy was quite flavorful this way.  I boiled angel hair pasta and added it to the sauce once it was done.  I topped the pasta with the chicken and served with a side of asparagus.  I think a sundried tomato pesto would be excellent added to the cream cheese mixture.  Also would like to try topping it with mozzarella cheese and baking it as opposed to finishing it on the stove.  A great recipe the way it is, but I believe will lend itself to a host of variations.

Some people care about their diet, but for me it comes down to how good something tastes, so when I saw that this recipe called for low fat cream cheese, I substituted with regular instead.  After trying the dish, I realized that having the heavier cream cheese did not seem to add any punch to the dish.  Because of the way that the sauce cooks, the cream cheese is really an after thought compared to the wine and basil flavoring.  While the recipe is a little bit more work, the dish has rich flavors and creates an impressive impression on guests.  When cooking this recipe, I'd recommended boiling the chicken for closer to 7 - 10 minutes vs. 5 minutes and to make sure that the chicken is covered during the simmer/boiling stage of the cooking.  Because the stuffed chicken breasts tend to be pretty thick, there is a tendency to undercook the inside meat, if you're not careful about how long it stays in the skillet.  I'd also recommend using a big pan for your skillet instead of a traditional frying pan because four of these monster sized pieces of chicken will have trouble fitting in a traditional frying pan all at once.  Overall, I give this one a four out of five, but make sure that your guests enjoy basil or else this dish will end up as leftovers.

Very tasty!!  I made this for company, and they had to cancel at the last minute.  Needless to say, I was not sad to have leftovers of this entree.  It is even better the second time around!  The cream cheese, flavored with garlic and onion, gives this dish such a distinctive flavor.  I was surprised by how much gravy this recipe made.  I will have to find another use for it, because no one could eat all the gravy in one sitting.  If you are looking for a new twist on an old favorite, TRY THIS RECIPE!  You'll be glad you did.

It didn't come out like I expected.  I think it's because I thought the cream cheese overpowered the rest of th meat.

This was very tasty and not too difficult to make on a weeknight. I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the chicken in the oven for 20 minutes instead of the recommended 5 minutes on the stove, and it turned out well. The chicken was still moist and I think baking it (covered) for the extra time allowed the flavors of the sauce to develop even more. Next time, I will probably add more (and probably dryer) wine as well as a bit more salt (recipe didn't call for any, but I added some and still felt it lacking) but overall, this is a great dish that I will definitely add to my recipe box.

This was delicious!!! Didn't put in the wine because my boyfriend is allergic to it but it was still fantastic. The cooking time definitely needs to be adjusted it doesn't take 5 minutes after making the sauce to cook, more like 20. The prosciutto really makes this dish. I loved it and the boyfriend loved it even more. Thank you!

WONDERFUL!  The only thing I did different was used dried Italian seasoning as I didn't have any fresh basil.  My husband loved it, thought it tasted like something he could have gotten in a restaurant in Europe when he was stationed there.  A definite keeper just as it is.

This came out awesome! I modified it a bit. I added Italian seasoning to the cream cheese before stuffing it in and used prosciutto and mozzarella because i couldn't find just prosciutto. I coated the outside of the chicken in the cream cheese and topped with more mozzarella and prosciutto and stuck it all in the oven. It came out with a nice sauce that would be great over pasta.

This recipe was wonderful!  I have never tried to stuff chicken and was a little worried.  Like another review suggested I followed the recipe up to the gravy, then I put the chicken in casserole dishes and covered with the gravy and baked at 350 for 1 hour and they were wonderful!  The only other change was I used green onion instead of red....it works well too!  I would definately make this again!

I LOVE prosciutto, so I thought I would love this recipe, but it was just ok. I had a hard time keeping the chicken from falling apart, and the flavour just wasn't what I was expecting.

Fabulous recipe, added a little more basil than it called for because I needed to use what I had.  Also diced up some extra basil for the pasta.  Everyone in the family LOVED it, even the picky eaters. :)

This was a delicious dinner, however, I used mascarpone (an Italian cream cheese) instead of cream cheese and rolled the chicken bundles in seasoned flour before cooking them. I followed the remainder of the recipe as written, however, my chicken was not cooked, so, I put the entire cast iron skillet into the oven at 350 for about 8-10 minutes. Perfect! I served the chicken and the sauce over angel hair pasta. Delicious!

I happened to have prosciutta and the other ingredients are regular staples so I was really hoping this would be great.  The cooking time will vary based on the size of breast you use.  Mine were huge and difficult to pound down to 1/4 inch so this may have been some of the problem.  I poured the gravy over top and covered and let it simmer for about 45 minutes and it was still a tad pink, but beautiful in appearance and very moist.  The gravy was wonderful.  The chicken and filling however was pretty bland and were it not for the gravy, there would have been no flavor at all.  We sent the leftovers home with our starving student son.  Won't be making this again.

Always trying something new to imprss my husband.  Two days later he is still raving about this dish.
