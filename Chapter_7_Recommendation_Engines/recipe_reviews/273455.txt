Grocery store was out of ANY Italian sausage--so in my undaunting stubbornness to forge on and make this dish....I settled for a hearty really smoky flavored sausage; it's a simple matter of knowing when to puncture the sausage so the juices pour out ( happened just like in Chef John's video!! ).  Aside from using thick cut mushrooms, I did pretty much what Joyce C. did---and.  Chef John nailed it, suggesting Tarragon be used and don't forget: USE REAL WHITE WINE!! I am definitely making this again fully per instructions, so stay tuned for an update, coming very soon!

Made this for a weeknight dinner and everyone loved it (to include school age children).  It was easy and didn't take long--I'd even be comfortable serving it to company.  I didn't have boneless breasts with skin- went with skinless and pounded them to uniform thickness first.  Finally a new recipe for chicken- it's a keeper!

Made this last weekend and it was awesome. I used mild Italian sausage instead because my local grocery store didn’t have any sweet Italian sausage. Couldn’t find beech mushrooms, ended up using Shitake and baby Bella mushrooms. I didn’t have an oven proof skillet, so I transferred everything into a baking pan from the skillet and back again for the gravy.  Will definitely make this again.

This has great flavor! I used ground sweet Italian sausage instead of the  link.  I cooked the sausage a half way  to render the fat. Removed the  sausage and browned the chicken, I cooked the sausage with mushrooms and it was excellent.  I used wine to make the sauce. 

If my husband like italian sausage more this would be in my rotation. Now it will be a "special" meal when I want something tasty and comforting.

The flavor is heaven! If you haven’t tried it you won’t regret it! The chicken breast is a little bit too dry for me even after I used the one with skin, chicken thigh would probably work better for me. Other than that everything is amazing

My husband likened this dish to a religious experience - 5 stars, I don't know how it doesn't have more reviews, but I hope this one will help increase its visibility. Don't forget the "wrap a towel around the skillet handle" step because OUCH! We didn't change anything except using tarragon instead of parsley. Seriously phenomenal supper!!

This is easy and a family favorite.  I served it with Rice.  They couldn't get over the amount of flavor from so few ingredients.

Great dish.  Everyone loved it. I used 1 pound thin skinless chicken breasts, diced sausage (already packaged),  I added 1cup of chicken stock, 1 tablespoon of minced garlic and baked covered at 350 for 1 hour.

This came out great, kids and adults loved it. I served it over well roasted sweet potato cubes (with salt, pepper, fresh garlic). They went perfectly with the savory main dish.

My family loved it but I should have pounded the chicken flat
