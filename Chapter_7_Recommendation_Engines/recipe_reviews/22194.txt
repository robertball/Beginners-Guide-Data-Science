This was very good and very easy.  I used frozen blueberries, which turned out great and actually made the mixing easier since the batter is so sticky.

Wow---this now takes the trophy over my grandmother's famous blueberry coffeecake. Very easy!! The key to the light moist texture, I think, is alternating mixing in the dry to the moist batter. Very very wonderful!

Delicious and easy to make...I added blueberries on the bottom of my pan before adding the batter and then more on top before adding the topping.  Therefore I used 1 1/2 cup of blueberries.  Will definetly make it again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was a fabulous blueberry crumb. My family loves the extra crumb so I doubled that mixture. It was a hearty crumb cake...that is how NYers like it! Great recipe overall...will continue to use it!

Absolutely delcious! After reading the reviews, I made just a few changes: I used 1 cup of sugar in the cake batter. I also added approx 1/3 c sour cream & 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also used brown sugar in the topping instead of white. This cake is so good! I can't wait for my hubby to come home & try some....that is, if there's any left!!!

This is a good recipe. I'm not a fan of blueberries so I used cranberries instead. Because cranberries are not as sweet, I added 1/2 cup applesauce to the batter. This cut the tartness and fixed whatever thickness issues the others had becuase the batter was just fine. I put a layer of topping in the middle as well as on the top. My family enjoyed it and I'll use the recipe again. Thanks for sharing!

Oh so nice and easy and good but needs some flavoring so I like to add about 2 tsps. of lemon rind.   This recipe also works for raspberries - frozen or fresh.

Excellent.  Tried it for company and got rave reviews.  The only change I made was to use King Arthur's White Whole Wheat Flour since we like whole grains.  Thank you for sharing.

This has got to be the best blueberry coffee cake ever.  Loved it. Made it exactly as written, except baked it for only 40 minutes.  Puffed up, and was moist and scrumptious.  Brought some of it over to welcome new neighbors.

i've been thinking about making blueberry coffee cake for a couple of weeks, just for fun on a rainy sunday morning.  found this one, read good reviews, but it was just okay for us.  no one raved.  the cake itself didn't have enough flavor, though the topping was yummy.  i think i'll try another one next time.

This cake is not very sweet @ all. It is delicious however when you add the topping. Considering the cake was meant to be eaten with the topping, I think it is superb. Very happy I could replicate something like this @ home. Unlike others, I did not find this cake dry. I did add 3oz applesauc to avoid that though. Sprinkled blueberries b/w cake batter rather thaan stirring in. Bumped cinnamon up to 1 tsp. Also, surprisingly light for a such a thick batter! Sweetness of cake alone is my only fault.

I made this recipe as muffins.  The taste was excellent, but they are rather dense for muffins.  I think they would have been better as a coffee cake.  I baked at 375 or 23 minutes and they were done perfectly.  One think I notices was the batter is very think.  I was nervous about this, but they did turn our fine.  If I want to make a coffee cake I would use this recipe again, but I think I will keep looking for a blueberry muffin recipe.

This was very good! I used cold butter not softened butter and used a pastry blender to mix the topping, came out great! I also used a whole pint of blueberries.  Will definately make again.

Disapointed in this recipe, however could be that I tried it X 6, ( Somehow I doubt it). The batter was like a crust but even drier.

Great Easy blueberry coffee cake recipe!! I have a child allergic to eggs and substituted 1/3C Applesauce instead. Also used 1/2C plus 2TBsp light cream ( instead of Milk ) Could have used an extra 1/2 C of berries but that is just my preference. If your omitting eggs try adding 1TBsp Cider Vinegar into batter before folding in berries. Worked perfectly for me and no one would ever know there were no eggs!  Will make again!  YUM!

WAY too dry.  I don't know what it needs-- perhaps more oil, maybe some applesauce?  All I know is if you are looking for a nice MOIST coffee cake, this is not it.  I'll look elsewhere next time.  Sorry.

I followed the reciexactly and it turned out very nice, but a little dry. I understand that this is a coffe cake and therefore should be eaten with said beverage. However, i still prefer it to be a little less dry. So next time i will decrease the flour to 1 1/2 cups and increase the vegetable oil to 1/3 cup. i will also double the steusel topping and try to melt the sugar a bit more before putting it on top of the cake.

Really tasty coffee cake and easy to assemble. I used the suggested revisions of 1 1/2 cups flour instead of 2 and added walnuts to the streusel topping which worked out fantastic for me. This is a keeper.

Made this last night, it was so easy and came out great. I used canned blueberries (drained). I also added some vanilla extract. Following a users suggestion, I increased the recipe by 1.5 (instead of 2C flour, 3C,etc) and made it in a 9x13 pan. Glad I did :-) I will make this again.

I just read "all" the reviews,after I made this for breakfast this morning! We thought it tasted great! I did use brown sugar,instead of white sugar for the streusel topping>>a preference & 1/2 tsp vanilla extract in batter-(lemon zest might be good too!! 
May I suggest to all that thought it was too thick  when making the cake batter to follow how to mix to exact directions!>and it won't be too thick- also stirring lightly after each additon. It is a thick batter, but fairly light to taste if made right.  
I used frozen  wild huckleberries,that  we had picked last summer...I would make this again - and after reading  reviesand hints I might  use a little less flour (a couple of Tabsp) and maybe add 1/3 cup of sourcream  in addition? (can't hurt) --- but over all we liked this recipe - thanks for sharing your recipe.

I liked the ease of this recipe but the cake portion was a bit bland. I will make this again and I believe I will add a bit of vanilla extract. I doubled the crumb recipe, added about 1/2 cup of oats and subbed brown sugar for the white. I had big beautiful blueberries in my freezer and they were perfect. I also made it in a springform pan. Good recipe.

Just made it for the kids' breakfast tomorrow morning.  I HAD to taste it because it smelled so good!  I was not disappointed and doubt the kids will be either. I did use all whole wheat flour and it turned out just fine.

Love this - - a favorite. Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to batter; placed ½ cup of frozen blueberries on bottom of pan. Substitute brown sugar for white in topping, and decrease it to 1/3 cup.  Next time try using cold butter and a pastry blender for topping.

Instead of using a 9" baking pan to make this blueberry coffee cake I used my muffin tin with paper liners. I used 3/4 cups of buttermilk instead of a 1/2 cup of milk and baked for 25 - 30 minutes instead of 45 minutes....perfecto!

Add 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Then it is great.  Also I use one recipe of the topping for two cakes.  And i subisitute some of the white flour for golden flax seed, wheat germ, and whole wheat flour.  Total white flour is 1 1/2 c., then a mixture of the others to make the two cup total.

Not sure what I did wrong but the batter was really stiff and hard to spread in the pan. It came out more biscuit like than cake. Although it tasted good it was not the moist texture I had hoped for.

baked it on a Friday night and invited a friend over Saturday afternoon to have this recipe with coffee.  Only change--substituted apple sauce for oil and added extra applesauce and blueberries to make batter more moist. Friend loved it and we had it with a side dish of strawberries.  Stays moist a bit longer also because of the applesauce.  Would recommend the recipe for anyone during fresh blueberries season.  May try with frozen blueberries if fresh are not in season. if using frozen berries--toss with some flour first. loved the easy to make streusel type topping.  hope others will try this recipe too.  definitely a new favorite.

May be better if cake just a little sweeter.  Otherwise very tasty and I like that it is made w/ a little veg oil instead of creaming butter.

This cake is so easy but oohh so good. I add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to the batter. Also I like to add a TBSP of brown sugar to the topping, a little extra flavor. Great for BBQ's picnics.

Topping was yummy!  I checked the cake after 40 minutes.  It was done.  It was exceptionally dry!!!  I will try it again using less flour and 1/3 C oil.  Also, add 1 Tsp of vanilla and, 1/4 tsp coconut extract.

This is a great coffee cake! My husband loves it. The first time I made it, it rose pretty high and was a bit dry. Now I only use 1.5 cups of flour for the coffee cake and for the topping I add a little nutmeg.

This is a good, basic blueberry coffee cake that is easily made with ingredients readily available in your pantry.  The cake itself is not sweet, the sweetness comes from the topping.  I wish I had added a little vanilla to the batter.  My coffee cake was ready before the 45 minutes, so I recommend checking the cake before the stated time.

It was good, but not my favorite. it seems to be missing something but I'm not able to figure out what. I used Swerve for the sugar substitute and coconut milk for the regular milk.  It was dryer than most coffee cakes and I wasn't a fan of the topping.

This was OK.  The cake could have used some cinnamon (not just in the streusel), and 45 minutes was way too long to bake. It wasn't burnt, but it was pretty dry. I wish I would have checked it after 35 minutes.

I used brown sugar instead of white on the topping.  Also used 12 oz. frozen blueberries which I'm pretty sure is more than a cup but absolutely NO complaints from my blueberry loving husband.  Next time I might put pecan chips in the topping.  I think the sifting and alternating was important to the overall texture, so I'm glad I stuck to the instructions there.  P.S. : My kitchen smells wonderful!

Added cinnamon and nutmeg to batter itself. Nutmeg adds more dimension!

I also mixed in some fresh strawberries. 2/3 blueberry, 1/3 strawberries for fruit.

A few white choc chips sprinkled in the batter once it's in the pan, and some cut fruit on top of the crumble topping, give it a dessert look & taste.

This is the best coffee cake recipe I've made. The sugar/butter crumbles crystallized somewhat, making the top reminiscent of a (very soft) brûlée topping.

I only made two changes, and I would change one going forward. I melted the butter, didn't cube it, and I made it on an 8X8 pan. I would definitely add made water to the glaze and make it right before bext time. Other than that, this was such a good cake, it barely lasted three days between 2 of us

Family loved this recipe.  I modified it with Raspberries and they really liked it as well.  Going to try Strawberries next then Banana-Nut.  The kids are asking for a Chocolate Chip version...Guess that one will be coming as well.

Super easy and really yummy coffee cake.  Suggest baking it 35-40 minutes--45 minutes be too much (at least in my oven).

I loved this loaf, it was so easy and very moist and light.  I didn't put the streusal on it, I added some lemon zest to the batter and also made a lemon glaze and poured it over the top and it was really delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

Nice and moist. Love the crumb topping! I doubled the blueberries, so it took a little longer to bake, but I think it would have been lacking without.

Very good, and easy!  I had frozen blueberries, and I ended up using two eggs rather than one so it would be more cakelike.  I had to cook it a little longer, but I added the extra egg.  The streusel topping was yummy, crisp and crumbly!

1st time I made into muffins. Substituted approximately 50% of the flour with Almond Meal. Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to oil, sugar, & egg mixture. For the topping, substituted brown sugar  in place of white & added sliced almonds. Baked for approximately 20 minutes. 2nd time I made in 8x8x2in glass Pyrex & substituted fresh raspberries. Baked for approximately 30-35. Delicious:)

On the plus side, this was very easy to make. But in terms of the final product, it was only so-so. Not very moist and not very appealing in appearance. If I made again, I would make in an 8 inch pan.

NEEDS WAY MORE MILK.  This is a great recipe and great cake...IF you add about 1.5 cups of milk instead of the 1/2 cup it calls for.  Seriously... 1/2 cup of milk in 2 cups of flour doesn't even get it wet

I made this for my husband, following the recipe exactly, and was extremely disappointed in the end result. After an hour of baking, the center was still completely raw (I guess it's possible my oven temp was off, although I've never had a problem with it before). Since the crumble topping was already brown, I tented some foil over the cake and let it bake for another 30 minutes. Once it was done, it was the driest coffee cake I'd ever had. It was not very sweet, and the crumble topping was not so much a crumble as a crust. The flavor wasn't bad, but it was really boring. My husband ate it topped with pancake syrup and liked it okay, but the time and effort involved was definitely not worth it for the final product. I won't be making this again.

I love this recipe.  I followed it to the letter.  I like the fact that it was not too sweet, perfect for coffee.  Had plenty of blueberries which kept it moist, but the topping did not fair well with me.  Next time I will use less butter, dark brown sugar, and cinammon.  Thanks for sharing!

If I had to rate it without the adjustments I would give it four stars. I added 1/8 cup of milk, another 1/4 cup blueberries, and a teaspoon of vanilla. My family loved it! I also used brown sugar for the topping but I am going to try it with the white next time. I also decreased the cooking time to 40 minutes, but I used a glass pan. I am not sure if that is why it didn't need to cook as long.    Great coffee cake though!

This was absolutely a 5 star. I only had 1/4 C. blueberries so I peeled and cored two small red apples and used those to make about a cup and a half fruit. I used half white and half brown sugar in the topping. I only had a glass 8x8 so I lowered the temp to 350 and cooked for 55 minutes. This was very moist, I will definitely be keeping this in the recipe box!

I love this recipe!  It is incredibly versatile; you can't go wrong.  (I don't bother with the streusel, the cake itself is yummy.)  I was looking for a coffee cake recipe using oil since I am too lazy or forgetful to make sure the butter is right.  I had a ton of fresh blueberries that needed to be used quickly, so I chose this recipe. I doubled the amount of fruit, dumped in tons of blueberries. It was awesome.  Then I used firm peaches and Splenda/sugar mix.  Perfect.  Frozen berries.  Perfect.  Experimented with chopped apples and applesauce.  Perfect.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe and there is no fresh or frozen fruit you can't use.  And as I said earlier, I always use a lot more fruit than the recipe calls for.

Huzzah!

I absolutely loved this recipe... made it this morning for my Husbands (adult) children whom came for lunch... they raved over it... and for living in England where everyone loves to put cream or custard on everything sweet... it was humbling to know they did not request either.  My Stepson told me that it is a must for repeat performances...  I followed recipe to the letter, with a minor exception of making a bit extra crumble for the top.

Great recipe! How do I know?! This did not last in my house more than two days. I caught my husband eating this cake over the cake container without a plate (ya, I know, what a pig!) I did add a little more flour to the topping because I wanted it to be a little more crumbley (is that a word?) but that is the only change I made. I did use frozen blueberries only because if I left them in full view in the fridge they wouldn't be there for me to make this cake! So I hoarded them in the freezer just for this recipe. Excellent recipe. It's a keeper.

Made this into muffins but as I did not have milk I substituted vanilla yogurt.  

Wow...awesome substitution which made it a very moist delicious muffin. 

The only reason I did not give it a full five stars was the crumb topping.....something with the ratio of butter to flour to sugar just didn't turn into crumb for me...it ended up being a melted sugary goo which made all my muffin tops ooze together.  It did eventually harden after I left the muffins in the oven for about ten minutes longer than required.  I think the next batch I will use less butter and more flour and sugar to get it to "crumb" like it's supposed to.

I found this coffee cake very dry and very dense (which my boyfriend actually liked).  I may try again using some sour cream, which I find adds a lot of moisture.  I liked the fact that the cake itself wasn't too sweet.  I think most of the sweetness in coffee cake should come from the topping, and this recipe accomplished this well.

Cake portion was too dense and not very sweet.  I'll try again with another egg or some additional milk.  Maybe some added brown sugar, too.  Or even applesauce or yogurt would help. Topping was yummy, but you can add that to any recipe. I also added a packet of instant heart smart blueberry oatmeal to my topping.

Just tried this recipe for the first time today and it came out very nice.  It is not too sweet and it was moist.  I did pull it out of the oven a few minutes early for fear of it drying out.  Easy to make too.

This cake good, nothing outstanding. I must say, the strusel on top was very tasty. My only problem with this recipie is that the cake came out very dry. Maybe a dry cake is pretty standard for a coffee cake, I don't know this was my first attempt at making one. Although I really enjoyed the cake with the fresh blueberries inside, I think I will try a different recipie next time.

Easy to make and tastes amazing. I added 1/2tsp of vanilla to the cake batter to give a bit more flavor. The topping was a big hit.

Definitely very yummy!  I doubled the recipe, but did not use a big enough pan, so the cake was extremely thick!!! I also tripled the crumb topping because I love crumb topping, but there was just way to much. Next time I would definitely not double the recipe or change the amount of crumb topping. I would also use something with brown sugar for the topping. Overall it was good though!

SOOO GOOD. I scaled the cake up to 18 servings but left the topping the same and baked it in a 9x13 pan. As others had suggested, I added a bit more milk. This is perfect with vanilla ice cream, and isn't nutritionally very bad for a dessert either. I might try brown sugar for the topping next time for a slightly different flavor. thanks! :-) I love it.

This is very good using fresh or frozen blueberries. I suggest that if you don't want to have the crumb topping add a little extra sugar to the batter. Whole family really likes this!

Very good! Great base recipe. Doubled the crumb as per other suggestions...glad I did. If you're a big blueberry fan, could easily double the blueberries. Was amazing straight out of the oven; leftovers a bit dry, but that's par for the course with most coffeecakes. Will go into my recipe file!

Very easy to make. I agree that it is a tad dry but it is a coffee cake made for dunking in your coffee! Requires a bit more flavor, more sugar or some cinnamon & nutmeg perhaps, Good but lacking something! I will try another recipe. Thanks anyways!

I made this recipe a couple of days ago and it was a hit...didn't even last 24 hours. I am thinking about making it again already! I am debating on leaving the blueberries out (a friend of mine doesn't like them) but not sure if it will turn out ok.

This coffee cake is superb. It was a bit too sweet for my taste, but my family adored it. Its great for the morning or evening. I will definetely be making this cake again when friends come over.  I found the top crumbs to be too sweet compared to the rest of the cake, so in the future I will use less of that. Still - it was delicious!

This will be a favorite.  It was easy and passed the family's taste test.  I'm really picky about what I use my fresh blueberries in since I wait all year for them.  This is worth parting with a cupful:)

OK, so here is the deal. This cake tasted wonderful (due mainly to the fact that I tweeked it a lot, I think) It was the absolute dryest cake I have ever made though! I had added sliced almonds and a little almond extract to the batter, as well as some vanilla. I replaced the milk with sour cream (closer to 3/4 cup), as most coffecakes call for that, and not milk. It was SOOO thick that I literally had to press it in to my cake pan with my fingers, trying to distrubute it properly. I though though that maybe the moisture from the blueberrys would bake into the cake, and that was the reason for having the batter so thick. It came out so crumbly (not in a good way!)

This is a great recipe.  I used half wheat flour and wheat flour for the topping.  I also added more than 1 cup of blueberries.  The boys just loved it, actually they told me that there was something wrong with it, since half of it was gone by the time the two of them were done eating breakfast.  Thanks so much for offering this great recipe!!!

My daughter just started school this week and chose this "Blueberry Cake" as her special treat.  (She's on a serious blueberry binge lately!) This coffee cake was just what we were looking for.  It was easy to prepare, and not too sweet- I liked that, and chock full of juicy blueberries- she loves that.  And since hubby and son won't touch coffee cake, we're two happy gals!  Thanks Patty!
**note:  Although my oven bakes hot, this only took 20 minutes to bake...
