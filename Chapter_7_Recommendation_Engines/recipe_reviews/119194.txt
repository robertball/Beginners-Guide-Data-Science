I made this for a Christmas appetizer and am just now getting around to rating. It was fantastic!! Very rich with a great depth of flavor. I served with cold grapes and wheat crackers. Will definitely make again!

A different, very mildly flavored dip.  The delicate flavors of the Swiss cheese and cream cheese, along with the green onion come through and are delicious.  I used  chopped almonds instead of sliced--they were very crunchy and good, though I think sliced might have been better.  Everyone seemed to really like this, though I don't think it is something I'd make again.  It is very, very stringy--hard to get on a cracker without pulling out long strings of cheese.  But overall it is very good and something a little different.

I have made this in the past and it is delicious.  Reminds you of quiche lorraine but with a softer creamier texture. Yum!

I have been making this for years and it's always a hit.  I find it works well with Triscuits or Wheat Thins.

I should have wrote a review on this along time ago,  I have made this many times and it has a great kind of nutty taste and is different from the usual dips...sooo good

5 stars for fast, easy and just a little different.  Tried it with several different "dippers", and crusty breads or little italian toasts are best. I am surprised there aren't more reviews.  Thanks kim!

Decided to gamble on this for New Years Eve and I bought all the ingredients (I thought) but when I got home discovered that I had picked up Mozzerella instead. Sent the hubby out to find an open store at 6pm and he was successful and I'm so glad because it was really good just as the recipe is written.

I just heated this in the microwave oven carefully in a Corelle-type cereal bowl and put the remaining toasted almonds on top.  It turned out great!  Everyone at work loved it with the crackers.

A real crowd pleaser.  I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer and had many requests to make it again for Christmas.  It's good reheated too.

This spread was a bit bland to us.  I followed the recipe exactly but, for us, it was definitely missing something.  After reading the reviews,  I see that I am in the minority.  Another recipe posted on this site (Martha's Hot Almond Spread) is almost identical to this one and several reviewers for it say it needs garlic so before I write this recipe off my list, I will try again with the added garlic . .  and maybe a bit of onion powder too.

I made this for Thanksgiving and mixed all the ingredients but baked the next day. It turned out perfectly and was a big hit, there was none left! I served it with Ritz wheat crackers and red grapes. I would definitely make to serve at a party again.

Fantastic ! Want to turn this into a meal? Add some cream to lighten the sauce cook as normal.    Pan fry frozen Ravioli in oil coated in egg and then coated in corn meal or crumbs of your choice.  Plate with crisp lettus, raviolli, and scoop on your sauce. Thank you Kim

What did I do wrong on this one....  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't memorable....  it was just there.  No flavor, and I added green and red bell pepper and just nothing…..

This dip was good. I added dried cranberries and extra green onions. Next time I will add even more cranberries and everyone raved over them.

This is the best dip you could ever make! I fixed it for our neighbors and we gobbled it up like animals.  I had about 2 tablespoons left and my husband told me to save it for breakfast!  We spread it on toast the next morning.  So good.

I made a mini version of this for Hubs and me to snack on during the basketball game yesterday.  Very good!!  I loved the flavor of the Swiss cheese in this.  I was liberal with the green onions, using a lot of the green tops for color.  I used white pepper and added a pinch of salt.  As a personal preference, I did opt to omit the nutmeg.  I’ll make this one again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This spread is fabulous!! I brought it to a potluck and popped it in the oven there.  It went over ridiculously well.  Really nice for a fall night.    I did add cooked bacon (had some in the fridge that I needed something to do with) and I thought it was a very nice touch.  I also added more cheese cause I'm a cheese freak.  Served it with ritz whole wheat crackers and was asked for the recipe 7 or 8 times.    Thank you!

Very good.  The leftovers were also good cold - sorta like a cheese ball.  Will likely make again.

This is a delicious cheese spread. Everybody loved it. I made it for a party and halfway through the party made another one because everybody wanted more, and that was easy to do because it is so fast and easy to make! This will be my go to recipe for parties.

I made this according to directions. I found the mayonnaise and swiss cheese made it oily. The flavor wasn't impressive. Sorry, won't be making this again.

this is SO yummy, I wish I would have taken a picture!  I added a dash of almond extract to it and it was devoured at my party!  I'll definitely be making this again - soon I think!!
