What a yummy, simple snack. We used dried apricots and substituted sun butter for peanut butter due to allergies and it was great.  Will definitely become a staple at our house!  Thanks for an allergy friendly recipe!

Puffed millet is not as crunchy as crispy rice, so expect a slightly chewier texture. These were a little hard to keep together; the flavor is very nice, however, and they're a very satisfying snack.

Fast, easy and a sweet treat!  I omitted the dried fruit and used chunky peanut butter.  I tried it warm with ice cream and it was quite a sugar rush.  Next time I might consider adding oatmeal and/or cherrios and using less honey.

Very yummy! Great for some one having a craving for something sweet but doesn't want to use up their calories! Although the mixture was pretty sticky to work with, it's a very forgiving recipe and my family loved it!

I used this as a flavoring option for millet porridge. I toasted the dry grains (not puffed millet) in a dry skillet for about 5min to bring out their nutty flavor/aroma, then cooked the toasted grains porridge style (3:1 water to grains ratio) until the water was absorbed. Then added the other ingredients in this recipe (honey, PB, salt, vanilla and raisins) and served as a warm cereal. It was a huge hit! Not surprised. Itâ€™s very sweet and nutty. Next time I might do the same, but with half the honey and PB (1/4cup each).

Great and easy recipe.  I couldn't find puffed millet so used puffed brown rice. Also added some pecans.  Quick to make.
Freezes well.

Yummy! A little crumbly, but tasty. Didn't use fruit, but added chopped almonds instead. Also added 1c cheerios
