This was pretty tasty! The sour cream and onion combo adds  an interesting spin on your standard corncake. I was a little unsure about the dill and hot sauce, but it was a nice addition of flavor. The timing was a little off, tho ~ It may be my oven, but I had to bake it a lot longer (like 10-15 minutes longer).. maybe next time I'll try an 9x13 pan instead.

I have been making this exact recipe since the early 90’s, it was in Woman’s World, and was called “Maryanne’s Onion Shortcake”. The lady that submitted it said it was a German dish.  I’ve always brought this to potlucks, and it’s a huge hit every time.  I usually double the recipe and make 2, and freeze the second one uncooked.  It freezes really well, just thaw before baking.  The original recipe called for 1/4 cup fresh dill by the way.

This was very good, husband loved it! The consistency was a little different than I expected, more like a pudding than a cake or bread.  It would make a great side dish with ham, chicken or pork.
