This is the perfect Sugar Cookie frosting. I baked the "Blue Ribbon Sugar Cookies" submitted by:Angie Seaman, and used this frosting with sprinkles. I have a cookie jar filled with perfectly delightful tasting cookies. They make the best combination, and I am switching to them both from now on. This frosting starts off softer on the cookies and then hardens up enough to stack them without being crunchy. Absolute perfection.

This frosting came out great!  What I did was I divided the frosting into four different bowls after adding the vanilla extract.  Then I put 2 drops of different food colorings into each bowl so I could decorate some easter sugar cookies I made.  It worked out perfect and it made a lot of frosting!

We really liked this icing. It's a lot like the icing that my Mother made years ago. Only she added a bit of cream of tartar. This recipe is easy to work with as well. If you want to change the taste for something a little different try adding a little vanilla, or almond extract, even lemon extract. For a few ideas. Thanks for sharing with us!

We usually make butter cookies for the holidays that we decorate w/ colorful royal icing. This recipe did not mix well w/ food coloring, and in the end, had subtle white streaks through it.  I've found that there are less ingredients in the recipe for Royal Icing, and that food coloring mixes in well to give you a smooth, uniform color, with the same sweet result as this frosting.  I'm switching back to Royal Icing.

I have never successfully made any frosting. But this one is IT! I havled the recipe and used a fork to beat and mix. Even though it took a long time and it was exhausting, it was really worth it! I used them to decorate my gingerbread men. The best thing is the frosting hardened up overnight making the cookies possible to be stacked. #1 frosting recipe!

I had never made a homemade frosting for my sugar cookies before. I expected with a name like "Decorator frosting that it would be close to a royal icing or stiffer.It is not. This recipe was very good.I halfed the recipe and there was plenty to frost 3 doz. 4" heart shaped cookies. The texture was creamy smooth and not greasy or gritty. I added 1/4 teaspoon of imitation vanilla butter nut flavoring. It added a tiny bit of color and a nice flavor. My husband and two toddlers love them.Thanks!

I have used this recipe several times with a few changes. I use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 margerine and also add almond extract instead of vanilla. Use this on "Best Ever Rolled Sugar Cookies" for a wonderful treat. After frosting each cookie try dipping your frosting spatula in cold water and gently running it over the top of the frosting. This will give your cookie a shiny finish. Be careful not to wet it too much or you may end up with soggy cookies! Or gently pat it with a paper towel for a textured look.

I LIKE THIS RECIPE. I USE IT A LOT WITH THE BEST EVER ROLLED SUGAR COOKIE RECIPE.  I DO NOT ADD THE RED FOOD COLORING, I MAKE WHATEVER COLORS I WILL BE NEEDING, AND I ALWAYS ADD EXTRA VANILLA.

I had 4 small ones at my house this afternoon and we decided to decorate sugar cookies with this frosting.  I've used this recipe several times since I first tried it and have always had good results.  The texture is smooth and creamy.  I've used red and yellow coloring and they've both turned out beautifully.  Highly recommend!! Thanks P. Oakes

There are many good, basic buttercream frosting recipes on this site and this is one of them.  Simple enough to adjust the amount of milk (I used half-and-half) to get it to the desirable consistency for whatever decorating project you're using it for.  Since I used this to pipe onto a cake, I used less milk.  Good, reliable, recipe - and because of the butter, especially good-tasting too.

If you are attempting to make this with an electric hand mixer, keep the following tips in mind. You will probably need a bit more milk to get the frosting to come together. I used about an extra 1 1/2 teaspoons. Also, the longer you beat this, the fluffier it will be. I was probably standing at my bowl with the hand mixer for close to 10 minutes to get it right. This is a recipe much like buttercream, and it IS possible to get it smooth. Dip a metal spatula in HOT water, wipe off the water, and smooth the surface of the frosting with the hot spatula. All that said, it is an incredibly easy and versatile frosting with a flavor that is far superior to royal icing.

I used this recipe (I used mostly margarine and a little butter because that's what was on hand, plus I added 1 t almond extract) to decorate cookies tonight. It not only tastes delicious, but it works well for decorating and sets up nicely for putting the cookies in tins. This is my new go-to icing recipe.

I made 2 batches of this. One batch with melted butter and one batch with softened butter. Both were good but melted butter made it much smoother and creamy(better for piping). I also added more milk.

The best frosting I have ever tried! My entire family loved it on the sugar cookies I made. I followed the recipe exactly too. Unlike some other people, I had no problems mixing it with food coloring, there was no streaking just a uniform color and it was easy to work with. I did have a lot extra though that I saved with this recipe.

The butter needs to be melted, not just softened.  I used this icing with tips and bags and it worked very well to make pretty cookies.  It was great!

I use this all the time.  I make it with 1/3 c crisco & 1/3 c margarine instead of 2/3 c butter.  It tastes great & dries hard enough for stacking (at least it does the way I make it).

As written, this frosting recipe is far too sweet.  Even my eight year old nephew found the amount of sugar overwhelimg.  I cut the sweetness with about 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice, which helped enormously.  The spreading consistency is good and makes it easy for the kids to decorate cookies with.

Great frosting.  Snow day today, and the kids were off of school, so they made cupcakes.  We added a little extra milk so that we could pipe it onto cupcakes using a 2D tip.  Worked great and tasted fabulous.  Thanks.

This was an excellent recipe.  The flavor was excellent.  I made several batches and added different food coloring to each so my kids had a choice which ones to decorate with.  We loved the flavor and consistency of the frosting.  Will def. use again.

This Delicious!! Tastes like you bought it from the store! I frotsted cookies with it seems more like a cake frosting either way it's very good and easy. I followed a tip from someone add a little sugar at a time then the milk and then vanilla. Also you have to let them sit for a little while before stacking them lol I found that out the hard way haha great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!  It is perfect for decorating cakes, cupcakes & I just used it for decorating a big cookie cake for my daughters birthday!  It spreads nice and pipes out of a decorator bag perfectly as well. I didn't make any alterations to the recipe ... just beat it within an inch of its life with the mixer. No more expensive pre-made decorator frosting for me!

This recipe did not turn out AT ALL!  There is TOO much butter in the recipe and that's all it tasted like, even after adding the Vanilla Extract.  It was too grainy as well, i don't see how people can compare it to Duncan Hines.  Yuck.

It was a very sweet frosting. Reminded me a lot of fondant with the taste. It was easy to make, no doubt, but too sweet for my liking.

This is a really good recipe.  I used 1 teaspoon of almond extract instead of vanilla, and salted butter (not margarine).  Very good!  A recipe I certainly will use again.

This was a quick and easy frosting for our fall cookies. I did find that the without adding food coloring (as with our white frosted ghost cookies) it was a bit tough to spread. Aside from that I didn't experience any streaks or spreading issues once the food color was added.

I used this recipe to frost my cutouts at Christmas and was very pleased with the results. I definitely prefer a recipe with butter instead of shortening. Makes a lot of frosting which was good because I made many colors and had a lot of cookies with the Shortbread recipe that I used.

This recipe makes a delicious frosting that we used for Christmas cookies.  Needed to add more milk though, as it was pretty dry, as others noted.  We used almond extract instead of vanilla: delish. I can't see how the vanilla extract would be "optional," as noted in the recipe.  Wondering if P.Oakes meant to write that the red food coloring was optional, instead of the extract?

outstanding!  I slightly moistened my knife so that it spread smoothly- very sweet and dries very well so you can stack cookies.  I used the best rolled sugar cookies from this site- another winner.

This is a great frosting!  We decorated our sugar cookies for "Santa" with this, I also used red, white & green.  This is a pretty universal frosting, I'll use it for other things as well, (although my 11 year old son has pretty much not stopped talking since he's eaten 3 cookies... sugar buzz)!  Thanks P.

Worked perfectly to decorate my "ninjabread men". It was just right to pipe small details and dried nicely as well.  It was also easy to spread and would work well to frost larger cookies too. Yum!

I only needed a little bit of frosting for the gingerbread cookies we made for santa this year. This is a great recipe. I only used one stick of butter, eye-balled the milk and vanilla and probably only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Didn't use the food coloring. But this recipe definitely helps to figure out the ratio of butter to sugar. Thanks for sharing.

So good. As a frosting lover, I can barely stop myself from eating it right out of the bowl. It dries nicely to keep it from sticking to other cookies, but still stays soft.

Fantastic frosting, I used this on sugar cookies and it worked very well.  I used half and half instead of milk and used a Kitchenade mixer to beat for nearly 10 minutes.  I love the texture and flavor and will try again with some of my favorite cake and cookie recipes.  Be sure to put treats in fridge since it has butter and milk!

I sifted the powder sugar and I think that improved the creamy/smooth texture. It was easy and tasty. The frosting set nicely for stacking.

I have been looking for a recipe like this!  This is THE BEST frosting I've ever made!  It would just roll out and press onto the sugar cookies.  Another reason I liked it, was because it HARDENED.

If you want a frosting that does not contain raw eggs (ie, royal icing), but still hardens so that you can stack them atop one another, this is the right one. According to the Joy of Cooking, you can safely store icing like this (with milk & butter) at room temp for four days, and two weeks in the fridge. Good to know. I did this recipe 1.5x, and it made a good bit of icing. It is a pretty stiff frosting, not soft like cake frosting. It seemed to take various colors well. It took me a TON of green food coloring to make a tint close to "Christmas Tree Green."

This is the best recipe I've ever found for cookie frosting. I had some frosting left over after making cookies about a week ago, so I put it in an air tight container and stored it in the refrigerator. Today I microwaved the left over frosting for 9 seconds on power level 2 and PRESTO I had perfect spreadable frosting again.

This frosting was like the kind that is on the cookies that the supermarkets sell around the holidays.  Very easy to spread.  Tasted GREAT on the Pink Icing Cookies (Submitted by: Lisa Tomshack). We used green food coloring for Christmas.

This is the BEST frosting I've ever made!  In the past, I've always had trouble with frosting tasting too greasy or grainy.  This is absolutely wonderful.  I used it on cut-out sugar cookies, with the margarine instead of butter and lemon juice instead of milk.  It has almost a cream cheese frosting taste.  ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!

Fantastic tasting, great consistency. If using over the course of more than 30 minutes, it is best to keep it covered or it begins to lose moisture and become too thick. Worked perfectly on sugar cookies for us!

This was a very yummy frosting!  My kids had a great time using it for their cookies.  It not as stiff as I would have liked it to be, so I just added a little more confectioners sugar to it.  Stacked great for storage too!  Definitely a keeper!

Do NOT make this with sweet cream butter!  That's all I had in the fridge but it turned out very weird. I threw it all out.  Will have to try again some other time...

This is yummy sweet and stiff enough to decorate. If you chill it it has a hard texture so that it doesn't rub off on other cookies.

This is exactly the consistency I was looking for to frost some chocolate cupcakes. I halved the recipe, and I did have to use a tad bit more milk (1/2 T?) to mix everything properly. I also added a generous pinch of salt and about 15-20 drops of bottled lemon juice to balance the sweetness. Will make this again!

Frosting is sweet, but not sickening so like many others.  Works great for decorating cut out cookies.  I use with Dora's Christmas Cookies, which with almond extract provide a savory counterpoint to the frosting.  (Don't worry.  It's still plenty sweet!)  I suggest doubling the Decorator Frosting to use with one batch of Dora's recipe.

I liked this recipe. I am baking Christmas cookies and decorated sugar cookies with this. The only problem I had was that my house was very warm because of all the baking and it took a long time for the frosting to set.

I was looking for a recipe for frosting. I have always winged it, using the powdered sugar, milk and vanilla and sometimes butter.I made this to decorate our Halloween cookies and my daughters loved it.They liked other recipes,but hey said to make sure I keep this recipe because this is THE BEST.I will definitley be making agian and again. In fact, I am making it this afternoon. One of these times, I would like to try it with some of the flavored coffee creamers for a different taste. Thank you for a great frosting recipe!!

Lately I've discovered presidents choice organic cake mixes. (In Canada you can buy them at Superstore for the same price as regular box mixes) The ingredient list is everything you have in your kitchen, no preservatives and no chemicals. Needless to say I've been cake baking up a storm. This icing would be bland without extract. It tasted like butter. I added hazelnut extract and it was amazing. Thanks!

I use this recipe every time I make sugar cookies.  I never use vanilla though, I like it with almond, lemon, maple, even anise extract.  Have fun and try with different flavors.

I used this with "Grandma Minnie's Old Fashioned Sugar Cookies" for a cookie exange at my husbands work and I could not have asked for a more perfect holiday cookie. I put all the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid and just mixed. It made the perfect amount of frosting and after an hour or two, dried enough to stack for easy transportation, while remaining soft when eaten. On a side note, a Chef friend of mine recommended going to Hobby Lobby and buying disposable decorating bags and tips to ice the cookies with. Next to baking cookies on parchment paper, it is the best advice for cookies I've ever gotten. It gave the cookies a store bought look, without compromising the great homemade frosting taste!

Nice sturdy thick frosting worked well for icing my gingerbread cookies. I cut this down to a forth and had plenty of icing for drawing on the cookies. Dried pretty quickly too. Too bad my artistic skill isn't as good as the icing. First time I ever tried to draw with icing, it's not easy. I ws trying to use a plastic sandwich baggie with the tip cut, but the side kept splitting where the bag seam was, so I rolled up a piece of parchment paper into a cone and made a paper baggie and then cut a tip out and it held up great especially since I didn't know what I was doing. Great frosting!

I used a full teaspoon of almond extract instead of the vanilla extract (that's the way my mom makes cookie frosting), but I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I beat it until it was very light and fluffy, and I added some red food coloring paste--it really turned out a lovely shade of pink for my Valentine's heart cookies. It turned hard enough to stack them. Great texture, color, and flavor, and it spread really nicely. Will use this from now on.

Turned out great! Was not runny at all, had a great flavor, and went very well with a more floury-tasting cookie. Reminds me of the frosting from Lofthouse brand cookies.

This frosting turned out very creamy and firm and everything that frosting should be. I used this to frost Eileen's Spicy Gingerbread Men from this site, and the combination was great. This is now my absolute favorite frosting and I will use it every time I need to frost cookies.

Yummy yum Yum! My 3 1/2 year old Daughter and I had so much fun baking cookies and making icing "from scratch" as she says : ) and this icing came out perfect. I like the fact that I can stack the cookies once the icing get's hard.

Terrible Recipe. I had to seriously fix this recipe - the previous reviewer was right - tasted like butter & the sugar was so sweet it hurt my teeth. I added crisco after the fact & extra milk to lessen the sweetness & butter taste. Was easy to work with but I'll look elsewhere for other frosting recipes

I used this on the Pink Icing Cookies from this website, adding some of the fine "sand" from crushed candy canes for a little peppermint flavor.  With a little time, it hardened just enough to be able to stack the cookies in a storage container.  Thanks for the recipe, P Oakes!

Since I'm not the greatest baker in the world, I was pretty scared to make my own icing instead of using a store bought one, but your recipe was very easy, quick, and yummy to make. The icing was very smooth, creamy, and easy to apply onto cookies and harden quite nicely in a couple of hours. 

Thanks a Bunch!!!!!

Great recipe. It was pretty easy to make and the consistency was great. The frosting spread easily on my cookies and turned a bit harder when they dried but just enough to hold my decorations together.

This was too sweet for my liking... Cut the amt of sugar down to 3 1/2 Cups yet it was way toooooo sweet! Otherwise, consistency and all were great!

I used this recipe to decorate some sugar cookies, and I was really happy with the results.  I use my Grandma's recipes for frosting normally, but I was in the mood to try something different.  The only change I made was to add a few drops of almond extract to the mix as I do with most of my icing.  Thanks for sharing!

The taste and texture were great.  I found if you use 1 tsp each of Wilton Butter flavor and Clear Vanilla Extract instead of butter and regular vanilla extract, you get a nice white icing which you can then use any food coloring to expand your decoration needs.

Great icing for sugar cookies. It is stiff and dries fairly quickly. It is very sweet....but then that is what is supposed to be on top of a sugar cookie, right? :-)

Great basic frosting. I would probably add a tbs more of milk next time to make it spread easier. We used it on gingerbread cookies.

My search for an easy and no-fail frosting for my sugar cut-out cookies has just ended! I have tried many frosting recipes for my cut out cookies but have never really been quite satisfied with the outcome of the recipes. This was a great frosting recipe. I highly recommend this recipe for your cut-out cookies. The frosting hardens to a smooth sheen and if you add food coloring then it looks really professional. On a personal note I did not add the vanilla flavoring since I did not want to compete with the flavor of the sugar cookie. I did end up following the suggestion of another reviewer and used cream and milk combined. You will need more than two tablespoons of milk and/or cream as it was not enough.

3 stars says it all. It was just okay. It was better before I put in the vanilla extract. 1 teaspoon is too much; I would suggest starting with 1/2 a teaspoon and adding more if you think it's needed. I don't TOTALLY hate it, but I would be very surprise if I ever made this particular frosting again.

This is my first time making homemade icing.  This recipe was easy and tasted great.  It seemed a little more runny than the store bought icing, but I just chilled it in the refrigerator for a few minutes to firm it up before decorating cookies.  I made about 40 cookies and had more than enough icing left over.  The only drawback is that it's way too sweet.  I like it, but my husband and kids usually can't eat a whole cupcake b/c it's too rich.

I love this recipe because it doesn't use shortening, yet, when set in the fridge, sets up nicely.  Yes, the recipe is sweet, but it IS frosting, so I'm not sure what flavor reviewers were expecting!  5 stars from me!

I have used another sugar cookie icing recipe for years and while it tasted terrific, the icing always caused the cookies I placed on a plate to stick. I was looking for a recipe that wouldn't do that and found this one. After reading the reviews, I was convinced this one would be perfect, and it was! I did have to add additional vanilla and milk so that it was easier to work with, and was concerned that it would cause the cookies to stick again, but it dried and hardened nicely. Now I already have Christmas cookies in the freezer! Thanks for sharing!

hmm.. the frosting didn't come out too well. the taste was pretty good, but the feeling- not to mention the look- was bad.. I don't know if it is my ingredients or what. the icing was drippy, and grainy. Because of the grainy at first, i put it in the microwave for about 15 seconds, and it came out like water. my bad. I put it in the fridge, but it was still the same,so I just put them on the cookies anyway. anyway, the taste was great! really sweet. at first, i looked at the recipe and I was thought, "THAT MUCH SUGAR???" no way!!! but actually, don't cut it like I did. also, instead of adding food coloring, I added a bit of grape juice. don't know why, that was the only fruit on the table. :D

Ths was a god recipe to use in decorator bags, but I found it to be very sweet and thick (even my husband thought so and sugar is one of his basic food groups).  So I thinned it out with cream to an icing consistency and it's perfect.  Simply dip the front of the cookie in it and set it to dry a bit.  The icing doesn't really run that much and you can still decorate with sprinkles.

I made the recipes exactly as stated except I added some lemon extract for xmas cookies and it was awesome. I liked how quickly they dried and stayed moist inside.  I took my time creaming the sugar and butter and slowly adding milk to get the consistancy I needed which needed to be even smoother, but oh well, they were still awesome. This will be my go-to for sure!

I used almond extract instead of vanilla the first time I used this recipe.  The second time I used half vanilla and half almond extract.  Both were SOOOO delicious. I used this to decorate gingerbread cookies and then sugar cookies.  I loved how easy it was to work with!  I will be using this recipe again!

This is the best cookie frosting I've ever had. Everyone loved it and immediately asked for the recipe. I think I've given it to four people this month already. My only alteration was to add .5 tsp of almond and .5 tsp of lemon extracts to it as well. I did that to match the flavor profile of my sugar cookies.

Worked perfectly on my gingerbread cookies.  (We don't like royal icing.  What's the point if you are going to actually eat the cookie.)  We didn't add the food coloring and I added extra clear vanilla extract and a very small pinch of salt.  Perfect!

Best. Frosting.  EVER.  Not too sweet, retains it's shape.  LOVE IT!!!  I added a tsp of almond extract and added a little extra powdered sugar to make up for the extra liquid.  I used this as a glaze/frosting for my Christmas sweet rolls.  Tasted GREAT on every flavor!  I haven't tried it on cookies, but I most certainly plan on it.  Thanks for posting this recipe!  SO easy and simply  perfect.

I like my frosting to be a bit thinner. In all, I ended up adding 10 tablespoons of milk also using an electric mixer. Perfect consistency for me and sweet, but not too sweet.

Amazing and fluffy!  Definitely sweet though but I highly recommend putting in the Vanilla if you don't like the buttery taste without it.  For 24 servings I added an entire 32oz bag of powdered sugar in case anyone wants to use those measurements!  Enjoy!

I used this icing for my July 4th M&M sandwich cookies. It turned out pretty good. I was happy to find a recipe that did not have shortening. I definatly had to use more than 2tbs milk to get mine a creamy texture (not sure why). I did not add the food coloring. Overall, it came out well and was thick and creamy but a tad sweet for my liking. But I would definatly make again.

yum! i added 1/2 tsp almond extract like everyone else. I was 1/4 short of confectioner's sugar, but it still turned out great. I used an electric hand mixer to make things easy.

This frosting is fabulous everytime! The taste is great and can be flavored with extract. I love that the frosting hardens to set, this makes a big difference between other store bought frostings.

This frosting was alright, however, it is not great for decorating. I added cinnamon and used it on banana cupcakes, which was very good. When I tried to make roses with it, it got too runny. If you are looking for a good decorating icing- use something with shortening.

You can't beat this old school frosting recipe!  Don't use margarine...use REAL butter.  Be sure to beat it for the alotted time.  Delish!  I use a few drops of white food coloring if I want the frosting to be more white because the butter yellows the frosting a bit.  Delish!

This is a nicely flavored, crusting confectioners sugar frosting.  It was a bit too thick for my thin cookies, so I added a dash more milk.  But that's the beauty of this type of frosting: it's easy to adjust the consistency with more milk or more sugar to suit your needs for every occasion.  The butter gives a good flavor (better than shortening) and I also added some orange extract.  After it sits on the cookies for a while, it has a nice crust so you can stack them.  However, under the crust is still soft frosting.  My family and I loved it!  We'll definitely make this one again and again.

Initially, I wondered about the amount of butter, but this whipped up nicely and was an excellent compliment to the cut out sugar cookies I frosted. Like others stated, it dries nicely so you can stack cookies but yet they are still soft when eaten. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. Delicious and rich.

I used this on "Soft Sugar Cookies IV" and it came out beautifully! Very easy to make and really tasty, not overly sweet as so many other frostings out there. I cut the recipe down to 1/4 and had plenty to frost 35 cookies. I also added some lemon extract since my cookies were lemon flavored as well. Will be making again!

Came out awesome.  I used it with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies Recipie.  No white streaks in frosting as someone else stated.  I used regular food color and made orange and purple, beautiful.  I added a wee bit more milk.  Not grainy at all and dries hard for stacking.  Of course it's sweet, it's supposed to be it's frosting.  Will make again!

After attempting a buttercream frosting recipe from this site that was a complete disaster, I decided to try this one out. It turned out perfect! I used it for mini cupcakes for my brother's wedding and they disappeared. Everyone ate the cupcakes instead of the wedding cake! This icing sets up beautifully and tastes great too.

I am not a fan of the crisco frosting for decorating, so I tried this one. LOVED IT! I added merigue to make sure it set up, and it was perfect. The warmth from my hands kept it a thin consistency, and I LOVED the taste! I had a hard time getting the frosting from the bowl to the cake because I kept eating it!

This frosting is absolutely incredible. Everyone is asking me for the recipe! It's soft on the inside but hard enough to stack on the outside. And sweet, but not toooo sweet. I made it with pecan shortbreads.

This is pretty much your standard buttercream frosting for cookies, and it decorated well and dried hard, but not too hard.  Nice consistency.

My kids and I love the way this frosting tastes.  It is Perfect!  Not too sweet!  It reminded me of favorite sugar cookies growing up (from church dinners etc).  Super easy to make.  Does have the consistancy of store bought frosting from a can....reminds me of the "whipped frosting" (how you can see the little wholes in the frosting when you spread it...vs...creamy can frosting that goes on smooth and more solid) but tastes much better and after an hour it is hard enough to stack cookies. Even though the frosting looks more like the "Whipped" can variety...it tastes more like the Creamy can variety (I will admit I am kind of wierd, but to me there is a difference)I personally don't like the whipped kind.  Frosting did have a tendancy to lift off cookie while trying to frost. I just covered them with sprinkles for St. Patty's Day.    I did two batches, one batch was more than enough for 40 3" cookies.

Perfect frosting for sugar cookie cut-outs.  I made it for Valentine cookies made from the "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe.  The combination of these two recipes is a winner!

This is delicious frosting.  I made a half batch of this for my daughter's preschool class along with heart shaped sugar cookies, and the kids had a project frosting and decorating the cookies themselves.  They had a good time and the frosting spread very nicely.  This frosting is similar to canned frosting, except fresh and no chemical taste - this whips together in a pinch so there is no reason to use the canned stuff anymore! Other reviewers mentioned that it dries hard - I don't know - the cookies were gobbled up before the frosting dried.

This was really good icing. We used it on some spiced sugar cookies and it blended perfectly. One thing to make sure of, unless you want what my wife calls (snow icing), is that the butter/margarine is completely at room temperature to ensure that the ingredients meld together.

This frosting I put on sugar cookies and was very yummy!!! It had a great texture,  was easy to spread on the cookies and easy to decorate with!! The only thing I did different was I used more food coloring then what it called for since I wanted more vivid colors. I will be keeping this recipe around for years to come!!

I used this on Gingerbread Cupcakes from this website (of course without the cream cheese frosting it suggests).  I was looking for a frosting to pipe onto the cupcakes.  Someone suggested it to me and it was PERFECT!!  Everything piped beautifully and this will be my go-to frosting to pipe from now on!  It seems really, really thick at first, but just keep beating it.  DOn't add extra fluids.  Oh, and did I mention how good it tastes?!

This is a good tasting, easy recipe. I thinned it out a little with milk to frost a  9" X 26" cake and it was just enough. It went on fluffy and hardened just enough to stay put. It did get a little soft and hard to pipe, but nothing a few minutes in the fridge couldn't fix.

This is a really easy frosting to make. It is very sweet but pairs well with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe from this site. My husband and I made Halloween Cookies - ghosts,pumpkins, etc., and the only thing I would do differently next time is use a clear imitation vanilla so that my white icing stays really white.

Yup, we really liked this one, I needed it for a cake so I added a bit more milk (also I was only trying it so I scaled the recipe to 1/4 of the recipe). I'll be making the full recipe this weekend for our daughters's birthday cake (twins). I liked how it is a stiff icing though, no smudges when it needs to be transported to the party venue!
Update 10 October 08: When I made the full recipe to ice cupcakes (Fudge Cake recipe on Allrecipes) I didn't alter the recipe at all and it was really good to pipe (though my piping does need more practice!).

Great recipe!!! It was quick and easy to make, and spread really nicely. It's stiff enough to pile high, if you like thick frosting.
I just spread frosting onto cupcakes, since I was adding sprinkles anyway, but it's soft enough that you could just as easily pipe it. 
New fave!!!

This is the perfect frosting for sugar cookies! I also like to add a little more vanilla, also its fun to add a little marshmallow cream to taste.(too much can make it a little too sweet, but use your judgement.) People can really taste the difference when I add a little marshmallow cream. They say, "what did you do? This is AMAZING!!" It is just something worth trying to mix it up a bit. This is a great basic frosting recipe though.

I used this recipe today for sugar cookies and it is awesome. I made sure to beat the butter (I used real butter) and sugar for a while to get it light and fluffy. Tastes wonderful and dries so they can be stacked. We used decorator bags to put the icing on the cookies and it worked great. I actually wrapped some in plastic wrap to ship and the icing didn't smear at all. this is a real keeper and I will use it often. My girls kept eating it out of the bowl too.

great frosting for sugar cookies. Similar to a recipe I have used in the past. Frosting got hard enough to stack cookies, which was what I wanted. Will definitely make this again.

I used this frosting on gingerbread and sugar cookies.  It has a really nice flavous and is soft and fluffy.  great for speading or piping onto cookies.  My single problem was that the recipe made WAY too much frosting!  I planne don using it to ice my batch of gingerbread and used lots on them but still had dtons left.  I hate to waste, so the next day I made suger cookies and frosted those too!  Still I ended up chucking about a cup of frosting.  That said, I will use this recipe again but I will definitely 1/2 it.  If you do have leftovers and plan to use them within a couple days, put the frosting in a bowl, and cover tighly with saran wrap.  When you're ready for it it will be very firm.  Either leave the frosting sitting out for 2 hours or so before you will need it or microwave it for about 5 seconds.  It returns fairly well to its original consistency.

This is delicious and perfect for what I wanted- icing sugar cookies.  It's soft and smooth and sweet.  I made it exactly as written.  I used real butter for once and that is a must.  I made it with "Soft Sugar Cookies IV" and it was incredible together.

Let me first start by saying that I'm an absolute failure when it comes to frostings--no matter what recipe I use, it always taste weird and has the wrong consistency.  But I made this frosting yesterday (didn't change a thing) for some sugar cookies (Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site) and it turned out GREAT--perfect flavor and consistency.  People even commented that the cookies tasted similar to Cheryl's sugar cookies!!!!

We used this recipe for frosting our Valentines sugar cookies (Soft Sugar Cookies V from this site) and it was delicious.  It was a little thinner than I expected, but still tasty.  I used just 2 drops of red food coloring to make a pretty pink color for our frosting.  After a few hours the frosting set up just enough to stack the cookies easily, but yet was still soft when you bit into the cookie.

Great frosting for sugar cookies and/or gingerbread men. Sets up nicely so you can stack your cookies.  I have no problems with the consistency when following the recipe exactly.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  I made some with just vanilla and some with vanilla and almond extracts.  I didn't have a mixer and I think that would have helped to make a smoother icing.  I mixed mine by hand and it took forever to get most of the lumps out but I still had little ones that didn't look nice when it was piped onto the cookies.  I would try this again but use a mixer to get a smoother blend.

I made this frosting to go with the "Best Rolled Out Sugar Cookies" from this site. Both turned out really tasty. I made this frosting exactly how the recipe said and the consistency and the flavor was perfect. Good recipe!

Delicious! I put this frosting on the easy sugar cookie recipe from this site and it is so wondeful! Dyed the frosting pink for Valentine's day and put on heart shaped sugar cookies and purple for my grandmother's bday and put on butterfly sugar cookies! I love it and will keep using it!

This was a very user-friendly frosting for sugar cookies.  It was tasty, easy to spread and stayed delicious for the two days my cookies lasted!  It's very sweet (as it should be!) - so you don't need a ton of it on each cookie

This is an amazing recipe!  I don't like the taste of cream cheese frosting so I tried this for my "homemade oreos."  It was very smooth and I found myself stealing a taste a little too often :)  I highly recommend this to anyone...great tasting!

Worked great with the Soft Christmas Cookies recipe I used for Valentine's Day heart cookies.  I sprinkled pink sugar on top of the pink frosting (it's not going to be red) for extra fun and sweetness.

This was SO easy and so tasty. I used chocolate milk to add a bit of flavor and color because I didn't use the food coloring. I wanted that color because this worked AWESOME to make the laces on the brownie football recipe. VERY good!

This was easy and tasty.  I have been struggling with frosting for my Christmas cookies for years.  I've  tried many, some too hard, some too soft, some this some that, but this recipe was perfect, it will be my go to cookie frosting for awhile.  I used it for the base coat and in my  bags. I LOVE IT.

Absolutely delicious. This is a super sweet version of icing so those who don't like super sweet may want to try a different recipe. I use half a batch and pour over my brownies. Perfect touch!

This is really good frosting! I added a few drops of lemon juice (I used the packaged stuff you can buy at Braums, but I imagine real would do the same) and it really improved it. It still tasted as sweet but had a less sickly sweet flavor.

LOVE this frosting! I make it with the "Thick Cut Outs" recipe from this site and always get rave reviews. Frosting is easy to spread and pipe, blends well with any color, and is delicious!! A+

Easy and delicious - used unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk in place of milk and no additional vanilla flavoring.

I love this frosting, it is so buttery tasting!    I try to eat more natural ingredients and didn't want a recipe that used shortening.

This will be my go to recipe for sugar cookie icing. I followed the directions, didn't change anything. Was a bit worried at first that the icing would be too "wet" but it dried nicely, wasn't too hard, but could stack the cookies if necessary.

This frosting recipe was perfect for Sugar Cookies. We made some Christmas cookies and the frosting was perfect. Fair warning.... it makes a lot of frosting especially if you are dividing it for having different colors, we had a ton left over so we had to make more Christmas cookies... bummer! Ha ha!

this recipe worked great as written. I tried adding extra sugar like people suggested but my cookies became blobs and didn't hold their shape. redid the recipe following it exactly and it turned out perfect.

The frosting tasted good but the consistency is too thick for piping. Unless you want your hand to cramp up like mine did; I suggest adding more milk.

This is really good as-is. I made the mistake of adding a little almond extract (as suggested by other comments) and didn't like it. Made it again without and it's perfect for sugar cookies! :)

GREAT.
It has a great taste, and I found myself constantly taking a spoonful....
I would definitely recommend this for sugar cookies.
Also, if you don't have any red,
use strawberry juice!

I'm not sure I'll make this again.  If I do, I have to remember to cut down on the recipe.  It makes a LOT of icing.  I did add a little more milk to soften it a bit more.  Tastey and sweet.

Halved the recipe. This was so easy, made with ingredients most everyone has on hand (and without disgusting vegetable shortening), tastes delicious, and has the perfect consistency for sugar cookies. I will make this again and again, trying different flavor extracts depending on the type of cookie.

Nice, easy frosting recipe! I had no food coloring so I added about 3 tablespoons of creamy natural peanut butter to the recipe. It was still a little sweet for my taste so I balanced it with a pinch of table salt. Voila! Peanut butter buttercream frosting! It will go nicely on a chocolate cake.

This recipe is awesome!  It is super thick, so if you are going to use it in a "decorator bag", I would suggest thinning it out just a bit. I ended up popping 3 bags due to the thickness of the frosting. I ended up adding 1/4 tsp of milk to it to prevent the bag from popping.

This is the best cookie frosting! I doubled the batch, made 5 different colors and put them in individual zip lock bags, cut a small portion of one corner off and let the kids have fun. Used with The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie recipe on this site. So much fun!

This is a great simple recipe for frosting. My only suggestion is to make a half batch. I made a sheet cake in a 13 x 9 inch pan and there was way too much frosting.(Note I left the cake in the pan so I did not frost the sides). Using the full amount there was a good 1/2 inch on the cake. Still delicious but a bit much for me.

Echoing other reviewers, this is awesome on "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe from this site.  I didn't know what kind of milk was best, I had skim and half and half - so I split the difference and used a tablespoon of each.  I also doubled the vanilla. It was perfect, got a nice "stackable" crust but  still felt like fresh frosting when you bit into it - so good!

Any Oles out there?  I top the "One Bowl Brownies" with this frosting and it is as close as I can get to the "Blondies" from the caf!  Good combo.

Decent flavor but the consistancy wasnt good. Every time i went to use it it would hold the decoration i made for about two minutes and then melt. Also it kept separating. I had to keep mixing it.

I love this recipe because the frosting gets firm enough that the cookies are stackable without having a total disaster!  It's all about presentation :)

If you are looking for a buttery, foolproof frosting, this is it!  I made this recipe x4 for a church event.  I made it the night before.  While it tastes delicious (that much butter always tastes good!) it wasn't ideal for gingerbread stables.  It became way to thick and I had to add a lot of additional milk.

Wow. I've made several frostings and icings before and NONE of them have turned out the right consictency. Except this one! I used it to frost a chocolaty cupcake which I made look like the Cookie Monster! Fun to use, tasty to eat! The only thing I changed was 3 cups sugar instead of 4 :) Thanks!

So easy and soooo good! It made enough to frost almost 4 dozen (with lots of frosting on each!) Used this for the first time to decorate sugar cookies for my son's first birthday party! Haven't had the party yet, but I'm sure these cookies will be gobbled up because of this frosting!

Perfect.  It's a very creamy, smooth frosting.  I was expecting a stiff frosting "decorator frosting", but it was more like a buttercream.  We also found it wasn't too sweet, so worked well for using sprinkles, m&ms etc.

Very easy to make, very tasty. It came out slightly dry without the food colouring, but once you put it in it really clears that up. :D Loved it, this is one of those recipes I think I'll have to memorize.

I loved this, I made it for sugar cookies however had some left over cupcakes to frost and used this. It worked perfect, the taste is much better than most basic cookie frosting. I did add a small amount of corn syrup to thin it down for cookies.

Sorry but this recipe did not preform according to description... wasn't smoothable (as you can see on the baseball in the photo) didn't taste very good, didn't harden up, and didn't pipe very well at all. Very disappointing and won't use again. Back to Royal Icing and a cookie that didn't look like my 5 year old iced it.

Yummy - and the perfect consistency to decorate my cookie cake.  It spread well and then was great for lettering!

I absolutely love this recipe. You have to watch it and keep what you aren't using covered as it will dry out pretty quick. This is the best tasting frosting I have found. It is excellent for sugar cookies but also works great for cupcakes.

The texture was great, smooth and not grainy.  It took color really well (I only used 1 drop of red to make a very light pink).  It set up nice and firm, even in our very humid climate (I let the cookies set in the warm kitchen and was able to stack them in a covered container before bed). I know it has to be this way for it to work the way it does, but oh my gosh it was SO SWEET.  I ended up having to scrape most of it off or it was just too much sugar.  And I have a sweet tooth.

Yum, not too sweet, perfect. I have to agree with some others it came out a little  too thick for me however I loved that because I could make it the consistency I wanted by adding some milk. If i was going to make cookie sandwhichs the consistency it came out as would have been perfect. I was using this to frost the soft gingerbread cookies from this site and mmm it was yummy. Another thing I would have to agree with was that the color did seem streaky but that didnt bug me!

DELICIOUS!!! I added some pumpkin spice to the sugar before adding the butter. It gave a nice flavor (to my liking) and made it a light bronze color. I did not add any food coloring because I liked the color from the spice. Happy Halloween!!

Good frosting! Used with Best Rolled Sugar Cookies-  I divided it into as many colors as I needed and put them into baggies for my "decorator bags", snipping a SMALL corner for my tip. The only problem I had was all my own fault- I added the milk after the butter and sugar was totally combined, and it left little flecks of white all through the finished product. It worked out well since they were halloween cookies.(made them look ghoulish and kid-like) I will make this again!

This frosting is awesome!  I use it to make my children's bday cakes.  I usually put it in the decorator bag and chill it for a few min before decorating- makes it a little stiffer and easy to use.

This is the best frosting for sugar cookies. Like someone else said it is hard enoght to stack the cookies but still soft on the inside and it is so yummy. I have gotten so many requests for this recipe. I didn't change a thing, I made it just as the recipe states.

I always change it up a little bit until it's the texture I want. It's always a little crystal-y, but works in a way where everybody's satisfied.

Great frosting!  Butter always tastes better than crisco!  But it is softer, and melts easier.  Something to consider if transporting.

So easy and delicious.  I mixed this up and then put some in smaller bowls to add different food colorings to.  I gave the kids at my daughter's party craft sticks to spread the frosting with and they decorated cookies.  What a hit!

Best frosting ever. My fam loved the frosting. We loved it so much that after I frosted all the cookies I had made we ate the frosting plain! To add a personal touch I added some English toffe flavoring which made it even better. Rember to mix well or turns out a little to thick.

Perfect!! I could eat it all with a spoon! It is not sickeningly sweet, so it was great for frosting our chocolate chip cookie pizza, in the shape of a heart for Valentine's Day.

Didn't stick well to cookies, had to spread too hard which frustrated the kids because then the cookies broke. Dried out too fast.

This frosting is too sweet for me.  I would say it is similar to oreo cookie filling (which I adore, but I guess not on sugar cookies!).  It is thicker than I would like - just like in the photos...So if you want more of a glazed icing, you should try something else.

the frosting was good.  i used almond extract instead of vanilla because i didn't want the frosting to come out off white.  but the funny thing is, after a while, the frosting started turing a little yellow.  i think the butter was melting in the piping bag from the heat of my hands.  hmm...maybe i might try unsalted butter or something.  but the frosting tasted great with the gingerbread cookies.

This was a delicious frosting recipe.  It set up nicely.  I had to add a little more milk, about 3-4 tablespoons total because it was way too thick with just two tbl.

I found this a little thin.  I added more confectioners sugar until it was the thickness I wanted.  Over-all a good sugar cookie frosting.  Hardened after about ten minutes (longer on the cookies I applied thicker frosting to).  Not too sweet and it tastes good!

Sweet and simple. I halved the recipe since I was only frosting one giant cookie and had MORE than plenty. It set well on the cookie and I will be using this again the next time I decorate cookies!

Tastes wonderful. I used this to write Happy Birthday on cake and to decorate edges. Instead of vanilla extract I used strawberry because it went with the cake.
No complaints...
Used this again on a chocolate chip cookie cake..Turned out great!

My daughter and I used this recipe to decorate my almond butter cookies for Christmas.  This was a perfect compliment to them.  I added a little of both vanilla and almond extract and it tasted just like the frosting I remember my mother making.  Thank you for the recipe, I'll be using this for all of my cut out cookies from now on.

I made this frosting yesterday to go with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookie recipe from this site.  I didn't like the taste of the frosting.  It was too rich for me, but bland at the same time.  I used vanilla to flavor it.  I also had to add a lot more liquid than the recipe called for to make it spreadable.  After that, it spread fine, but as I said, the taste was too much for me.

Delicious frosting. It's very nice and I will definitely use it again, but it's a tad sweet even for my liking. I'll reduce the sugar next time but I loved the butter taste. It took a while to set up as well and didn't set up as hard as I would have liked. But that doesn't matter much, the taste was awesome! Thanks.

FANTASTIC!  I tried a new sugar cookie recipe and they turned out ho-hum.  I decided to try and save them with some frosting (right over the sprinkles).  This frosting turned them from drab to FAB!  It was easy to make and it tastes wonderful!  It really does make a huge batch.  I made 24 cookies and still had loads left.  If you're just making an "average" size batch of cookies, I'd halve the recipe.  I also found it easier to mix the frosting once I'd microwaved it for a bit.  To make different colors, I scooped small portions out into a seperate bowl and mixed in my color, then I microwaved it for 10 seconds at a time to get the right consistency to spread.  Worked great and cooled well.

It was way too runny, and by the time I thickened it up some with more powdered sugar, it was way too sweet.  It also took forever to harden.  It was okay.  I may try again with a few changes.

Perfect frosting for sugar cookies. My daughter had a blast decorating with this frosting. I put some in a zip lock bag and cut a small hole at one corner and let her decorate the cookies.
This is a keeper!

This icing has a great taste, but is a little greasy.  I did half shortening and half butter to try to fix that, but maybe it made it worse?

I used this recipe on "Michelle's Soft Sugar Cookies".  It was pretty good.  I like the fact that this frosting is made with butter instead of shortening - it doesn't have that greasy aftertaste.  I just didn't think it spread very well.  It seemed sort of like a chore to frost my cookies - something I usually like doing.  BUT it tastes good, I will use it again.

Great easy to make frosting with the right consistency. I found it to be a little too sweet and i was using a substansial amount on a cake, so i melted down semi-sweet chocolate and mixed it in. It was perfect!! Also gave it a nice brown colour. (I don't like food colouring.)

It tasted too much like butter, not good at all.

Nice recipe for a buttercream frosting.  I put 3 cups of sugar in and then mixed it up, and it was almost too stiff.  I ended up adding a little more milk to thin it out.  Then I beat it for probably only a minute- I'm sure it would have been fine to do longer but didn't want it seperating on me.  The nice pink color looked great on heart cut-out cookies (Emily's Chocolate Shortbread from this site).  I used 3 drops of food coloring and half salted, half unsalted butter.  The babies loved decorating Valentine's cookies tonight.  :)

The colors didn't turn out exactly right. The frosting wasn't very thick and it took forever to harden.

Great recipe!  I tinted the frosting orange and decorated sugar cookies for Halloween!  Worked great!  Icing got hard enough to stack without messing up the decoration.  Will use again for Christmas Cookies!!!

This frosting was perfect for the heart-shaped cookies I made for Valentine's Day!  I substituted almond extract for the vanilla extract, since I love almond flavor.  I also colored the frosting purple instead of red.  Yummy!
