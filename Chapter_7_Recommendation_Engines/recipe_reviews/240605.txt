This was surprisingly good.  (I didn't expect it to be.)  It did need more cooking time and liquid than called for.  I added beef broth I had open - cooked until the noodles were done. 
Reminded me of Hamburger Helper but so much better.  A nice flash back to the comfort food of my childhood.

I was in a pinch for a quick dinner and this fit the bill. I didn't have all the ingredients so had to do some substituting. I only had individual servings of Mac and cheese so used 3 of them. Had left over peas and carrots so used them and a can of corn, drained. No diced tomatoes so I used a can of hot ro tel. My husband is a meat and potatoes man and generally doesn't like dishes like this, but he liked this one!  His suggestion- next time make it with diced potatoes instead of macaroni!!  And I think I might. Good meal and very quick and easy. Will definitely make again.

I definitely will try making it again. I've found the best way to change this recipe to put your own spin on it, is one ingredient at a time. My first suggestion would be adding fresh garlic, or changing or adding something else in addition to fresh garlic, as opposed to garlic powder or salt.

Used a bag of mixed vegetables instead of just peas and corn. Also used Annie’s GF Mac n Cheese as my little one is a Celiac. Turned out great, kids loved it and took leftovers to school the next day because I told them no seconds at dinner.

My whole family loved this! It's delicious and super easy to make.  We even substituted the mac'n'cheese for a Gluten Free version.

I used Annie’s Gluten Free Mac and cheese. Plus I sautéed onions and garlic and added red pepper flakes. So good!

Turned out delicious. made a few alterations I didn't have frozen vegetables so I used a can of green beans, a can of baked beans instead of tomatoes, mushroom broth, and it was delicious.

This recipe was easy to follow and it came out great! I only omitted the peas because they're not my favorite in dishes. My boyfriend liked it so that's a plus since he's pretty picky and critical of recipes. I would make this recipe again. There's plenty for two with lots leftover.
