This is out of this world good and a very nice change from ordinary dressings AND it's healthy!  I changed it a bit though...I used a whole bag of frozen raspberries and raspberry balsamic vinegar, like you recommended.  I put it over a salad that contained baby greens and fresh bananas, nectarines, strawberries, walnuts and goat cheese.  It was a huge hit and I will make it again often...what a super springtime treat for luncheons!!!  Many thanks for a healthful recipe.

Really good! I could have sworn I had frozen raspberries, but I didn't, so I substituted blackberries instead - gives it a nice purple color and slightly sweeter taste. Definitely making this again.

This dressing is so easy and it tastes great.  I make it with fat-free plain yogurt and the raspberry vinegar.  I have also used Splenda in place of the sugar on occasion.  My husband hates most salads and dressings, but he will gladly inhale a whole plate of salad if this is the dressing.  We like it with mixed greens, tropical fruits (papaya, pinapple, mango, etc.), slivered almonds and feta.

made this and loved it!  I used early raspberries, so I ended up adding a little bit of huckleberry honey to sweeten up the dressing a touch more.  I actually didn't like it as a straight up salad dressing, but loved it for dipping raw vegetables into.  

A couple of preparation/storing notes: Don't cheat and try to use a hand blender because you will end up with raspberry juice all over your clothes and counter and that stuff doesn't come up easily.  Also, if you store this in a plastic container, be aware that said container will end up permanently raspberry colored and flavored.

It was good.  I like the fact that it's a very healthy dressing in terms of fat and calories.  I would make again.

I actually use this recipe with strawberries instead of raspberries, but I LOVE it. I use it over baby spinach, sliced strawberries, and cinnamon sugared almond slivers. People have told me it's the best salad they've ever had.

this should not be titled a salad dressing.  It was very tart and was pretty runny.it is more like a dressing for fruit salads.  This is the only use I can come up with this recipe.

I loved this! I changed it a bit, so I gave it 4 stars. I used a few more raspberries and added 1/2 tbsp on Balsamic and 1/2 tbsp red wine vinegar and used vanilla yogurt and omitted the sugar. I used it on a strawberry and goat cheese salad, this was perfect for the warmer weather!

This dressing would be perfect for a fruit salad.  We found that the tartness of it made it a little strange on lettuce, however, it tasted really good to dip sliced apples into it!  For me, I had to add more vinegar to get the texture like I wanted it (was too thick otherwise).  I probably used about 1/8 cup red wine vinegar total.  Otherwise- the flavor was good.  We look forward to trying this on a mixed fruit salad in the future.

This is so good! I made it just like the recipe.  But,  I added some poppy seed.  I poured it over a salad of green lettuce,  leftover chicken cubed, sugared walnuts, dried cherries and feta cheese.  It is my all time favorite. Lunch just became fun again!

Very good salad dressing.  I did add some balsamic vinegar as suggested by another.  Perfect on spinach.
