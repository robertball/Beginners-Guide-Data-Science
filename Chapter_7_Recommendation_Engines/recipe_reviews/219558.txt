Sweet and crunchy! A nice change from plain 'ol toast or cereal in the morning.  I subbed cinnamon raisin English muffins for the bagel flats and since I didn't have pineapple slices on hand I sliced up some banana instead.  Overall, very tasty and a great way to start the morning!

I used Bagel Thins. I made my own strawberry cream cheese with reduced fat cream cheese and a few sliced organic strawberries. I just threw them into the mini food processor and blended until uniform. The kids thought this was a great breakfast--the absolutely loved it. I'll make this again but I'll try different fruit next time. Bananas or sliced apples would be good.

This is a very good recipe! I prepared the bagel for a diabetic friend of mine and she really liked it. I used a plain flat bagel because I couldn't get the cinammon bagels. Next time I will toast the bagel for a twist. The flavor of the cream cheese and the pineapple is great. And the chopped walnuts give it a special zing! A definite keeper recipe for the recipe box!

Well, my 3 year old only wants to eat these bagels now for every meal of the day.  lol.  My kids love them.  I couldn't find the cinnamon bagels, so I used whole wheat bagel thins.  We've tried them with bananas, pineapple, and strawberries.  I even pack them in my 7 year old's lunch for something different than a sandwich.
