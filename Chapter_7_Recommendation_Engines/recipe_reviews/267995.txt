This recipe is good. The reason of my 4 stars is that it needs a flavor boosting agent. The cilantro alone won't do it. Now, without much tweaking all you can do is add one garlic clove minced and a bit of onion. If you don't have cilantro, fresh parsley will work. Now, the real tweak comes in the procedure: First, sautee the garlic and onion being careful they do not burn but are soft. Then, add the mushrooms to the mixture. Sprinkle salt and pepper and the herbs. Mushrooms absorb salt so be mindful. After the mushrooms are done, transfer them to a plate and proceed to cook the cabbage in batches. Add a bit of salt and pepper. Once it softens and looks a bit greener in color add the mushrooms on top and add the broth. Cover and simmer 20 minutes. You are done. One tip for working with mushrooms is to pat dry them after rinsing and before cooking. This will prevent mushy mushrooms that have too much water. I will definitely will make this recipe again with my tweak.

I liked this simple combo after I added caramelized onions, thinly sliced apple, and whole mustard seeds and white pepper.

I made this with some of my own Savoy cabbage and a can of mushrooms since I did not have fresh ones.  I had fresh cilantro but didn't use that, we liked it just as it was, but we like our cabbage, and we found adding the mushrooms to be a nice change up.
