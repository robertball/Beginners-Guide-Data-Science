As written this gets a 1 or 2.  Brown the ground beef with onion.  Add taco seasoning mix 1 from this site (1/4 cup), then add the salsa and soup mixture.  Top the taco with sour cream, tomatoes, cheese and taco sauce.  Now you have a winner.

These were simple enough, but had absolutely no flavor at all. Very bland. I would not recommend anyone try this recipe as there are actually good ones out there, this isn't one of them!

I left out the salsa and added taco seasoning and about a 1/3 cup of milk it was very good.

pretty decent for a "repurpose" meal. Meaning this. As I already had some leftover taco meat made up from the night before, I used it when adding to the rest of the ingredients. And after I got to the steps of the soup...well I thought it was a can of Condensed Cheddar Cheese Soup. It wasn't, it was the Fiesta Nacho Cheese, but it worked. I mixed the soup and salsa together before adding to the meat. Because I also realized I didn't have quite a pound of meat leftover. So I just added to the meat until I thought was right  Which was 3/4th of the 2 ingredients combined. Had I added the whole bit, it would have been too soupy~like to do on tortillas. Now having said that. The meat, soup and salsa makes a great chip dip. (if all ingredents are combined) So where others lacked flavor, there probably a reason mine didn't. It had the spice of the taco seasoning in the meat and the cheese soup mix already had flavor as well as the salsa. So taking into consideration on those factors, I'd make again but using the extra enhanced flavors as I did to make this quick fix repurposed lunch from leftovers. Also, ya still need the extra fixings...tomatoes, onions, shredded cheese, olives, jalapenos to make it the bomb.

I added some black beans to this. Couldn't be easier but was just 'ok'.

A bit flavorless.  I would add taco seasoning, peppers, and something that has heat.  Kinda bland

what a hot mess would not make again. I dont understand how such an easy dish could be so horribly.
