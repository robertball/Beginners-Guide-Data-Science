I have a hard time finding blueberry cocktail where I am. I did use cranberry cocktail in it's place. Even with the juice change, it still was delicious.

Used fat free very vanilla yogurt (not frozen yogurt), and frozen blueberries.  I  did add some crushed ice to reach the consistency that we like.  The blueberry juice cocktail is the star in this smoothie, adding just a little bit of tartness.  The yogurt brought the smoothness and did not dominate as happens way too often with smoothies.  We enjoyed this for breakfast today and definitely will be making again.

This didn't really taste bad, but definitely wasn't what I expected. Like one of the reviewers, I only had the cranberry cocktail so I used that. I also used vanilla bean frozen yogurt, but just expected something more creamy or smoothie like. I even used frozen blueberries. It only tasted like blended berries and juice, in my opinion. The individual frozen yogurt cups aren't cheap either. They taste good and I would rather have just eaten it plain then to have used it in this. It was just a little too juice like and sweet for my taste.

Made this for my 4 year old, trying to find healthy yummy breakfast options to entice her to eat before pre-k since she can't graze like she used to. She didn't like finding berry seeds in her mouth or the tartness but after taking out the berries and adding a little sugar it passes her test. Still not quite what she needs for breakfast, so I'll keep trying new recipes. I gave it a 4 because I enjoyed the original with yogurt!!

I was looking for a simple yogurt and blueberry recipe and found this one. I used the juice I had (peach/strawberry) since I did not have the blueberry. I would like to try other juices (orange juice, pineapple, peach) and add to make a nice blended favor. I also added a spoon of flax powder for additional nutrients and fiber and a couple of ice cubes to give it that frozen style.

This was pretty good I must admit. It needed a little something so I added a little sugar which made it better.    Like another person who commented I didn't have the blueberry cocktail so I used the cranberry cocktail. I give it an overall 4 stars.

It was much too sweet for my liking and a little too thin. I might try it again, but will probably try to cut the sweetness with some plain Greek yogurt, throw in some ice and cut down on the juice or call for.

I did make this awesome smoothie! I used mango juice instead but otherwise just like recipe said to do. Added a half cup of ice too and loved the texture and taste lots.

I only had the partial amount of fresh blueberries, so I added 1/2-Banana. I used Gran-Grape juice instead of blueberry juice. It is/was delicious!!
