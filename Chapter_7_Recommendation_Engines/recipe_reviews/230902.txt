This is excellent and a family favorite.  I made just slight changes  to make it a little lighter and less points.  I add some fresh spinach I usually have around about 1 cup chopped, and butter one layer, light butter spray the next.  And instead of spreading 1/5 of the spinach mixture along one short side of phyllo stack and fold in long sides of phyllo, I do the opposite.  I put the mixture on the long side fold in the short side, less dough more spinach in each bite.  You can't lose anyway you make this recipe.

Excellent - easy and they freeze well.  I'm going to add some mushrooms next time.

I made these the last 2 years for holidays and gifts. You can actually get 5 or 6 logs depending on how much filling you use in each one. I found this recipe on Kraft's website. It also has a video and their cook suggests making 5 rolls per recipe. Everyone who has tried them absolutely love them. I will be making them this year too!

Crowd pleaser.  Simple and easy and handles substitutions well...I forgot to buy cream cheese! So used yogurt, cottage cheese and some cream because thats what I had!  I also added saut√©ed mushrooms and shallots instead of green onions.   Looking forward to trying it with the veg cream cheese....but these were gobbled up.

I had to make a couple small changes but otherwise made as written. The tub of feta I got was 5 oz so I used it all. I was unable to get the garden cream cheese so I used regular and I added a little salt. My husband said it was a keeper.

My aunt got this out of a Kraft cookbook magazine maybe 10 years ago. She made it and I ate probably an entire log! She let me tear out the page and I made it - simple, seriously delicious - awesome! Also freezes nicely - thaw and swipe with butter then bake.
