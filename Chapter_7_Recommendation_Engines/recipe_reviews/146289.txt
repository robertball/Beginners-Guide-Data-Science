I am super stingy with 5 star ratings, so you know I think this is awesome. The worcestershire sauce takes it over the top, so I wouldn't call it an "optional" ingredient.

Didn't have mascarpone so I skipped.  Didn't bake, served over sliced tomatoes for a nice cold lunch.

These are so good!  I had a lot of the filling left over, so I made them for lunch the next day by heating up the filling in the microwave to melt the cheeses, and then just broiling it in the tomatoes for a minute. They were even better! Wonderful recipe for goat cheese and tomato lovers!

My husband and I loved this recipe. Its very very good. I did not have mascarpone cheese and used queso fresco instead, I also forgot to put the mushrooms and parsley but it was awesome anyway.

Completely awesome!  Was simple and easy to make. I used Parmesan cheese bc that's all I had.  I made Tina salad for my husband so I reserved some for this dish. He doesn't really like tomatoes but he wanted some of my dish instead of the regular tuna salad!  The tuna & tomato together  was delightful!!!
