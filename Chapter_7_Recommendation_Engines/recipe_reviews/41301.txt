Made this recipe as is -- excellent!  Make sure you boil or steam the spear just till tender-crisp.  Very easy and tasty.

This at least gave me another idea for an ingredient to add to our common asparagus.  I am a sesame lover and I'm surprised I hadn't thought of this on my own.  I found it easiest to dry-toast the seeds in a non stick saute pan, and letting them cool for about 5 minutes before adding butter and garlic.  This way the butter melts easily on the still warm seeds and you can allow it to stand for a few minutes while your asparagus is cooking.  Hubby liked it, I loved it AND my 2 year old loved the 'sesame sticks'.

This was so easy and it had such a great flavor. I made it with the garlic chicken recipe I found on the web site and it was an awesome dinner. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Not a keeper for me.  The sesame seeds didn't result in much, if any, taste, and the lemon and butter mixture just didn't cut it for me.  I doubled the recipe, which may have been a factor.  Thanks though!

Decent but I don't think the sesame seeds added a tremendous amount of flavor, if any. More crunch than taste and it wasn't really needed on the asparagus (if cooked properly). That said, the lemon and butter tasted good on the spears.

Yummy, a very nice change. I have substituted snow peas for the asparagus.
