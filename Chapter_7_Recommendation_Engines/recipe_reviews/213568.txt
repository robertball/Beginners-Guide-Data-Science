Thank you Penny for posting your recipe, Ive been making versions of this cake for years. One of my favorites is to use a white or yellow cake mix and Chambord ~ I also stir a handful of fresh or frozen raspberries into the cake batter. I've made this cake using a pineapple cake mix, well drained pineapple tidbits and pineapple rum. I've also made it using a devils food or a fudge chocolate cake mix, a handful of chocolate chips and then use Kahlua as the liquor... they're all over the top delicious!!! Hmmm, I was just wondering what a lemon cake with lemoncello would taste like or an orange cake with Grand Marnier?? The possibilities are endless!! Thanks again :)

Not sure why Allrecipes made the removal of the cake from the pan so complicated.  ALL I do is let the cake cool about 5 minutes, put a plate or platter on top, then flip it and it falls right out.

This is the same recipe I use for a rum cake and it always is fantastic. Just replace the whiskey with a good quality rum and people will beg for more.

I have made this cake SO many times and thought maybe I should finally review it. It is DEEELICIOUS! I make 2 versions: this one to the letter and then a chocolate version... just use chocolate cake and chocolate pudding and add 1/3 cup instant dry coffee to mix...follow  Penny's directions and this is always a hit! The cake is ALWAYS gone within 10 minutes, so double up on the recipe!

Delicious! The whiskey goes very well with the vanilla from the pudding. The pudding makes this very moist and fluffy. Baking time is way overstated - I think mine was in for 30 minutes.

After reading reviews, I started watching for cake to be done after 30 min. Mine was done at 45 min. Like Penny said, very easy to remove from the pan but I sprayed liberally with Bakers Secret. Also cut the sauce whiskey down to 1/4 cup because it was going to work. The whiskey in the cake stayed at 1/2 cup. I did not add the whiskey at the end but simmered it 15-20 minutes with the butter/water/sugar to cook off some of the alcohol which worked perfectly as it left just a faint Jack Daniels taste and smell. Next time i will use the whole 1/2 cup in the sauce as cooking it on top the stove is very effective in eliminating the alcohol "bite". I inverted the cake on a plate but changed my mind and instead of poking holes and pouring sauce over, I put the cake back in the pan and poured the syrup around the outer edge so the cake could just sit and soak in the sauce for 10 minutes. Then inverted it back on the plate. Perfect for work if you cook the sauce!!

I'm not a big whiskey fan, so the next time I made it with Captain Morgan's Spiced rum and pecans instead of walnuts.  Really good!

I have the same recipe with the exception of nuts. In mine ground nuts are added right into the cake mix. I make it as Christmas gifts, by using small loaf pans.

I've done this cake once, and adored it.  Perhaps I didn't cook the glaze enough, but we all actually got a slight buzz from eating this baby.  Not that any of us minded.  I now use this glaze as well when I make a Guinness stout cake, as the whiskey glaze on the layers before the icing, really gives it a great kick.

This cake was so moist and delicious.  The only thing I changed was I used 1/4 cup whiskey for the glaze instead of the 1/2 cup the recipe calls for.  I would definitely recommend this recipe and will make it again for sure!  Yummy!!!

If you enjoy the flavor of Whiskey you still may not enjoy this cake.  My husbands cocktail of choice is Dt. Coke and Maker's and he did not like this cake.  It had a bitter aftertaste.

Delicious cake, however, I wouldn't want to go to work after eating a piece.  The whiskey is a little potent.  I made it with a butter flavored cake mix, which seemed to work well.  The whiskey glaze does have a pretty strong taste to it.  If you love whiskey, you won't be disappointed!

NOTE:  I did NOT make the glaze for this cake as I had other plans for icing.  The actual cake is fine, but really, it's a waste of whiskey.  The batter is awesome and gives great promise of a rich, whiskey flavoured cake.  However, once cooked you'd have to be a completely tee-totaller to find a whiskey taste to it.  I myself am not a whiskey drinker and I could barely taste it.  The whiskey drinkers in my family couldn't detect anything.  I wish I had saved the whiskey to just serve along side.  Save yourself the expense of the alcohol and only use the whiskey in the icing, don't waste it in the cake.

Tried this with full, half and no whiskey in the glaze. By far the full whiskey was the best. It did give it a kick, but also a lot of moisture. For flavor, it was a good cake and easy to make. I've had the rum version before and think it's a little better.

Recipe might be tasty - I have no clue. Cake would not come out of pan. Totally ruined a birthday celebration . I was nervous about putting the nuts in the bottom and my instinct was right. Do not make this cake unless you want to have a horrible day.

I am about to make this cake because I have a recipe from a friend who has made a delicious cake that is very similar and she gave us a piece that is amazing (NOTE: she did on glaze it)  However, the newer boxes of cake mix are far smaller than the 18.5 oz from the recipe she gave me which also calls for 5 eggs and 3/4 cup of vegetable oil and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Do any of you who have made this recently think I would get the same result if I drop one egg and reduce the oil to 1/2 cup?  I think the sour cream will keep it moist, so I will hang on to that.  Thoughts?

I've made it 7 or 8 times. Usually with a honey flavored whiskey also with a cherry flavor, white chocolate pudding and or a chocolate cake. A little extra butter to keep it moist. No matter how- it's always a favorite!

Thanks for posting this.  I could not find my brunch cookbook so I was happy to pull this up so easily.  I used a chocolate cake mix, vanilla pudding and rum only in the glaze.  I have done it exactly as your recipe and it was wonderful.  I should have taken a picture before dinner, because it's all gone now.

I've made this cake multiple times but alway use rum instead of whisky.  So good! Blows Tortuga Rum cake out of the water.  I get requests for it all the time. I sometimes use different pudding flavors, different rums, or gluten free cake mixes. It always turns out great. The Betty Crocker gluten free cake mix works great if you need to go that route. Also using a chocolate cake mix is fun as is using Malibu coconut rum too.  Try Malibu Black for more of that boozy flavor. Yum! 
I love this recipe so much! One if these days I will have to try and make it with whisky just to try.

This turned out very well.  I followed the advice of some and only baked it about 45 minutes. It was probably a little too much sauce for me but it did taste good.

The cake was very moist and I did receive many compliments on it. When I pour the glaze on, however, a lot of it ends up as a puddle on the bottom of the cake  holder. Wondering if this is normal or would it be better to bake in a 9x13 pan. Or maybe use less glaze. Did anyone else have this issue?

I used Evan Williams. Made the cake and let it cool in the pan.  Loosen the cake in the pan but don't remove it.  Make the glaze and pour it over the cake while still in the pan and let it soak in for a bit before turning th cake out onto a plate. I skipped the walnuts because I don't care for them.

I've made this cake soooo many times! I've actually had a few people ask me to make it for them. I use Jameson in it and it comes out delicious every time! Thanks for sharing!

I made it for my husband's birthday and it was a HIT! I'm already thinking about when I can make it again! I made this recipe without the pecans (bc of nut allergies), a bit extra whiskey in the cake and served with homemade whipped cream (with an extra splash of whiskey). Here's a link with my tweaks: http://loveandlightkitchen.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/whiskey-cake/.

Love this cake! I serve it with the bottle of leftover Jameson's for folks to add to taste. Always well received at gatherings.
