if you're concerned with the texture, try cubing the tofu and freezing it solid before baking (and add a few minutes of bake time. i learned that freezing tofu gives it a much better texture if you're using it in place of some meats. you won't fool anyone into thinking it's meat, but it's a much more satisfying texture.

The first time I made it not it was ok, but not a fan of the texture. The second time my friend said to press the tofu and then cut to smaller pieces way better!

Tastes very close to sloppy joes w/ ground turkey! I added a little minced garlic and put it in a processor to grind it up a little.

I second the first review,  prepared by direction and even attempted to ground up the tofu, but that didn't really help either. Was fun to make, not so good to eat...

This is great as a base recipe, as written its 4 stars.  I added some brown sugar and BBQ sauce to kick up the flavors a bit.  The whole family loved it and my 6 year old had no clue it was meatless.  haha!

Really enjoyed this one.  Added a slice of american cheese the 2nd time I made it, and after drying out on towels - just browned the 1/2 blocks of tofu in the frying pan, cooled for a minute then chopped, then crumbled them up even more in the pan with the veggies and sauce using the spatula.  Hubby likes, too.

Tasted great! I put the tofu in the toaster over for about 20 min. While that was baking, I just mixed everything else in a bowl and then threw it in the skillet with the tofu. I added a bit more ketchup but it was delicious!

I like the idea for vinegar, but the ketchup was too much. I ended up adding BBQ sauce to this because it just wasn't that great. It was good, and I'd eat it, but the BBQ sauce made it taste even better- it added a lot of depth to the taste. Still though, if I ever had a craving for sloppy joe's, and didn't have any BBQ, then the ketchup would do. I also added corn to mine. It was pretty great.

I really liked this recipe! I ended up leaving out the onions as I didn't have them at the time, but it was still really good. The recipe was pretty easy to do, and I had fun making it. Next time, I'll probably add the onions though.

Honestly, the texture was amazing. The flavor was very good but I'm giving it 3 stars because it was too acidic. I think if you did BBQ sauce AND ketchup, it would be just right.

I made this using 1 1/2 cups prepared TVP instead of the tofu. I also left out the green peppers because I didn't have any. And I only used 1 cup of ketchup. My (picky) daughter's reaction:"Oh my God! This is amazing! You promise it's not meat?"

Lengthy process but I wanted a meaty feel to my tofu. The process can be cut down to 2hours( 1hr for press and 1hour for freezing). I have a tofu press and press the tofu down to a 1/4" over a period of 4-8 hours. I want it as dry as possible. Atfter that, I freeze it solid. I let it thaw in the fridege, or do a quick thaw, by placing the frozen tofu in a bag and submerging it in hot water. After that your tofu should be very chewy! I won't have it any other way.

I added the barbecue sauce and brown sugar recommended in the reviews. Still VERY vinegar heavy. If we make this again, it will need heavy tweaking to be palatable.

I loved this recipe! It was my first time using tofu so I wasn't sure what to expect but it was good. I changed the recipe a little though. I cooked the tofu according to directions but instead of dicing it I crumbled it. I also used one can of great value (Walmart brand) sloppy Joe sauce instead of the sauce recipe.  I also added a couple dashed of garlic salt and season all.

Ok I made a bunch of changes and this recipe can be GREAT! I let to tofu sit over night in ketchup and stone ground mustard with McCormicks sloppy joe seasoning only 1/4 of the pack with some chopped red onion. The next day I baked like the directions already said but while the tofu was baking I saut√©ed minced yellow onion green bell peppers garlic and bacon. I added more ketchup and stone ground mustard along with about another 1/4 of the sloppy joe pre mixed seasoning and a pinch of smoked paprika. Then I minced the tofu and added it. We put this mix on toasted bread and It was great!

As is, it is ok.  I will try this again, but will use tomato sauce instead of ketchup. The ketchup completely overwhelmed us. It was good while we were eating.
