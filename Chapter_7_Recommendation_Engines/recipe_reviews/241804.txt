I'm such a HUGE meat lover, but lately I've been trying out a bunch of different tofu recipes. This is one of my favorites to date! Nice and spicy, just how I like it, and very easy.  It took longer than 10 minutes for mine to start browning, so I think about 14-15mins cook time before spooning the sauce over top. The only tofu available in my area comes in 14oz packages. I almost ate the whole thing by myself! I served this over white rice. Yum!

My wife’s a vegetarian and I made this alongside chicken for myself tonight. Would’ve preferred to eat all of the tofu if she hadn’t stopped me. So good!

I made this twice  and love it!  It's better when it is at least 1" thick. Too thin and it dries out too much. Good as PeiWei in my book.

I was looking for a new way to make tofu for dinner & came across this recipe. It was a huge success! I placed it on top of Asian flavor quinoa w/ cashews & stir fried bean sprouts. So delicious. I'm definitely going to make this again!

I pressed the water out of the tofu for 30 minutes. With 1/2” slices it had to bake for 30 minutes. Then I added the vegetables and a lil more sauce and baked an additional 15 minutes. You really want the firm tofu to stay firm! I will be making this again!
