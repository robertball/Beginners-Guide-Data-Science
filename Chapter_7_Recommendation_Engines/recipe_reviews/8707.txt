Yes yes and yes! This was outstanding. I made the following changes. Omited the chicken broth, drained the tomatoes, sauteed the onion w/garlic, added 1 can of rinsed and drained black beans, used a total of 16oz of shredded mexican cheese on top of each layer (instead of the processed cheese), cut the corn tortillas into strips for easier eating and finally added some sliced jalapenos and black olives. With these changes, it wasn't runny at all, a nice thick cheesy casserole. I highly recommend you make this recipe with my changes! It was delicious!!!!

This recipe turned out great with a bit of tweaking. To save time, (and money!) instead of buying and cooking chicken breast I bought a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket and stripped it of its meat...it shredded well!  Like others, I didn't use the cheese spread but instead used grated old cheddar on top of every layer.  Because I didn't need to melt the cheese into the mixture as I would have if I used the cheese spread, I omitted the step of heating all of the ingredients together on the stove and just mixed them up in a bowl.  I used both of the soups but not the chicken broth.  When I mixed the ingredients, I put everything in the sauce together except for the chicken pieces and reserved a cup or so and then added the chicken.  I used the reserved sauce for spreading on the bottom of the casserole under the first layer of tortillas and for on top of the last layer.  I used more tortillas then they called for, and did three layers...tortillas, chicken sauce, cheese, repeated it, and then finally one last layer of tortillas topped with a thin layer of the reserved sauce and then grated cheese.  The casserole was not runny at all, I believe the extra top layer of tortillas helps absorb some of the extra liquid.  I also drained my chiles and tomatoes well.  I also made this dish the night before and took it to a friend's for supper then next day, it cut out in perfect squares that we easily reheated in the microwave and everyone had seconds!!!

I gave this dish 5 stars and 2 thumbs up because it really is tasty. This turned out beautifully because I left out the chicken broth.  I'm sure it would have been runny if I had added it like other reviewers have stated.  It was a little on the spicy side but that can be easily adjusted by the temperature of the green chilies. My grandfather who is not fond of "hot or spicy" foods had more than one helping.  This is totally a casserole dish if you leave out the access liquid.  Great recipe Kyle!!

Husband has already requested I make this again.  I substituted flour tortillas for corn.  I would decrease the amount of liquid--maybe drain the tomatoes or leave out broth.  Oh, and since I HATE velveeta, I just omitted it and topped each layed with shredded real cheese.  Over all, a pretty good recipe.  Super simple to make, which is always a big fat plus.

Honestly, the sauce is to die for...very tasty, but as a layered casserole...its way too runny.  Maybe if you added more chicken to thicken it.  OR instead of layering the tortillas, i might try tearing them in bits and mixing them in with the casserole OR as another reviewer suggested, skip the tortillas altogether and just use the sauce as an appetizer dip by shredding the chicken instead of chunks.  I'm not giving up on this one yet (it really is good) but it just doesn't seem to cook as intended!

I usually like to make recipes as is before I tweak them, but after reading the recipe and the reviews I did omit the broth, I also didn't have velvetta so use a mexican blend cheese.  I was surprised at how well this turned out.  Everyone liked it and there were no leftovers.  Thanks for the post.

BEAUTIFUL!   A few changes...1) I eliminated the chicken broth and cream of celery.  I just mix a can of enchilada sauce with cream of chicken.  2) I saute some onions, sliced garlic, and red bell pepper and add it to the mix.   3) I make sure to drain the can of tomatoes and green chillis because doing that and eliminating the chicken broth leaves the mixture with a nice thick consistency 4) I add a can of drained black beans!   5) I layer torn up corn tortillas, chicken mixture, and cheese.  Then I top it with sliced black olives and jalapenos from my garden!!!  It is even better on the second day.

Very good.  I agree that the chicken broth should be omitted.  
I added Black Beans and used Shredded Cheese instead of the processed cheese.  I also used chicken thighs instead of the white meat.  The dark meat is a little more moist.

5 stars with the following changes: omit the onion, add a layer of black beans (1 can is enough), and top with cheddar cheese. A lot of people said the sauce was too runny - those are usually the same people who substitute shredded cheese for the velveeta. I used velveeta and it was the perfect consistency. My suggestion is if you're going to substitute shredded cheese, omit the chicken broth and drain the can of tomatoes.

This is a pretty good dish with some alterations. I took heed to previous reviews and omitted the cream of celery and chicken broth. It certainly does not need the extra moisture. I used green enchilada sauce, shredded colby-jack, sauteed the onions with a clove of garlic, and added a can of black beans. Though the cassrole was touch runny, it had a pleasing flavor and is ideal for cold weather.

Great recipe! Followed other reviews and omitted chicken broth, added black beans, and substituted 8 oz. of Mexican cheese blend for the processed cheese.  Also cut the tortillas into strips.  Turned out creamy.  This has been requested as the chicken enchilada dinner for now on.  Thanks for sharing!

After reading the reviews, I knew I had to cut back on the liquid, my son has a bad gag and can't tolerate mushy. I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 large jar salsa, 1 can Rotel, 1 heaping tbsp minced garlic, 1 tsp homemade taco seasoning, 1 heaping tbsp fat free sour cream and 3 or 4 tbsps water from poaching the chicken. I seasoned the chicken with 1 tsp homemade taco seasoning and sliced an onion to place underneath when I poached the chicken. I used small corn tortillas which I cut 3 in half for each side of the pan, then placed 3 whole ones down the middle, used 18 tortillas all together. I used Texmex cheese blend for the processed cheese spread which we don't eat. I sprayed the foil with Pam spray so it wouldn't stick to the cheese, 1 hour was perfect, let sit at least 15 minutes to serve easier.

A few changes and it was great! -Omit chicken broth -Use shredded cheddar cheese layered on top of chicken mixture -Saute onions beforehand Also, I prefer to shred the chicken rather than cube it.  Was the perfect consistency with the changes!

Yum Kyle!  Everyone LOVED it!  I only made a few small changes due to the reviews.  Ommitted most of the broth.  Here's how I did it.  I first braised the chicken and shredded it when cool. (You brown the chicken on both sides, then turn down the heat and cover.  Cook about 15-20 minutes)  While the chicken was cooking, I mixed all the sause ingredients  together, minus the can of broth. (everything but the tortillas and chicken- oh and I used cream of mushroom instead of celery because it's what I had) I added in the broth that dripped out of the cooking chicken.  Then I spread a couple of blobs into a large oblong pan that had been greased. Then 1/2 the tortillas tortillas (I used q 12pk), all the chicken and I added olives.  Next spread 1/2 the remaining sause mixture, and the rest of the tortillas (I cut them into large strips) and finally the remaining sause mixture.  Mine was cold because I'd made a few hours in advance and refridgerated so it took an hour in the oven.  The last 10 minutes, I topped with about 1 1/2 cups meduim cheddar cheese and more olives.  A layer of corn would have been good added on top of the chicken layer. It was SO yummy!  Everyone raved about it.

Soooo good!! We omitted the broth (it would have been way to runny for us) also added a can of drained blacked beans. We used shredded cheese instead of cheese spread and it turned out so great.  Yummmm. We have worked this into our "Taco Tuesday" rotation. One of our favorites!

Although I followed this recipe exactly, neither I nor my family enjoyed it.  The extra soups and sauces gave the tortillas a somewhat slimy texture when baked.

Ok... this was definately runny, even with cutting the chicken broth.  It had a great flavor though.  Next time I am going to add 3 cups of rice to the mixture.  I think it will be great then.

Tasty but even with omitting the chicken broth I thought a little too runny.  It was messy to dish but I added fresh tomatoes, green onions and sliced olives on top and it made the overall presentation nicer.  The family enjoyed it and it was easy to make.

We both loved it, husband had 3 helpings.  I used leftover chicken broth and skipped the cream of chicken.  Other than that I followed the recipe, but added garnished sliced jalapeño like the photo.

This was awesome.  I substituted the processed cheese for a 16oz bag of Mexican cheese - half melted in the sauce and the other half used in the layering.  I topped it with 2 tortillas and the rest of the cheese but no sauce on top.  This made the top of the tortillas crispy with the melted/burnt cheese but soft on the underside from the sauce it was sitting on top of - the perfect topping in my opinion.  I also used chicken thighs to keep it tender. A great recipe that I will continue to make.

I always find it interesting when people tell you to leave something out that isn't even in the recipe.... canned tomatoes for example! Good grief.
AND using rotisserie chicken... really? That is SO not even close to the recipe and EXPENSIVE!

I wanted chicken enchiladas without the work and this was a pretty good sub.  I followed the recipe except I used a cream of jalapeno soup I enjoy using instead of the cr of celery and used a Mexican cheese blend.  I tasted the filling after it simmered a bit and adjusted seasonings a little- it just seemed too bland, not enough spice.  I also used more cheese as I layered it.  This was good, just not wow- great.

It was tasty, although too salty for my preference, so I felt bloated for a day or 2.  I used shredded cheddar instead of processed cheese and only added a little chili powder. I'd love to find a variation or another recipe that cuts out the high amount of sodium added from the condensed soups and enchilada sauce.  My husband loved it, though.

This was easy and great!!  I did change a few things.  I found a can of cream of mushroom and chicken soup, so only used 1 can of soup.  I also omitted the broth.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn, torn into pieces (easier for the kids to eat).  The picture shows slices black olives, so I did that, too.  To make this even faster, I used canned chicken.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was a good recipe. I decided to follow the recipe as is, despite the "runny" reviews.  I did however, use shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese.  My casserole came out runny as well, but by the next day all the extra liquid had been soaked up.  It's just my husband and I eating, so we had leftovers for a few days.  It got better and better.  My mother used to make something like this, but she would use broken tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas.  Maybe that would also help with the runniness.

Thanks to all the reviews I did make changes to the recipe and the result was delicious.  Substituted taco seasoning for the chili powder; used 16 oz grated Mexican blend cheeses instead of the processed cheese; and used 12 corn tortillas. Omitted the chicken broth; and drained the diced tomatoes and chiles.
Assembled casserole in layers of tortillas, chicken mixture, then cheese.  Baked for 1 hour. The casserole was not runny. Served with black olives, fresh salsa and sour cream.  Everyone enjoyed the meal.

The sauce for this is fantastic!! But this came out runny, and I had even omitted the chicken broth, drained off the tomatoes, and ripped up the tortillas. But luckily I had flour tortillas on hand as well, so for each bowl I ripped up a large flour tortilla and then topped it with the chicken mixture. It turned out amazing! The flour tortilla soaked up the sauce and made this one of my favorites from this website, thanks, Kyle!

This was an instant family favorite! Exactly what I've been looking for. FINALLY an enchilada recipe that doesn't use sour cream, (my husband can't eat sour cream) The only change I made was to omit the cream of celery soup and use two cans of cream of chicken soup instead of one. I served this with homemade mexican rice mixed with corn, the perfect side to go with this! Everyone in my family cleaned their plates. We will be making this A LOT!

This was excellent!  I cut the recipe in half, used only cr of mush soup, rotel tomatoes, whole can of green chilies, and added 1 tsp cumin since I omitted enchilada sauce.  Also added one chopped jalapeno for heat and used all 10 tortillas.  It was still a little soupy so next time will omit chicken broth completely.  Topped with shredded cheddar.  Excellent flavor!  Will definitely make again!

01/17/20 - I'm still making this, still leaving out the chicken broth and cream of celery soup, adding diced chilies if I have them,  still using 1 can of chicken (drained  & rinsed), but this time I added 1 can of black beans (drained & rinsed), 2.5 ounces of velveta-rotel dip, topped with a sprinkle of shredded cheddar.  I used 14 corn tortillas--2 layers of 6 cut in half, top layer of 2 cut in quarters.  Delicious.  13x9 pan emptied by 4 adults.  Prior review:      
01/22/2005
In spite of the fact that I had to make this recipe based on what I had on hand (canned chicken flour tortillas) it was excellent. I did leave out the celery soup (didn't have enough chicken!) and broth (based on others' reviews). I also used only 2 oz. of low fat shredded cheddar cheese (because of health issues). Still excellent and I will make it many times--so easy!

I made this for the first time last week and it was FABULOUS! My husband and I both raved. He's already asking me to make it again, and I will soon. Definitely a keeper. I cut out the broth completely, sauteed the onion with some fresh garlic (thus omitted the garlic powder) and used sharp cheddar and jack. If you like enchiladas, I think you'll really like this.

First of all thanks to all who reviewed this and suggested the omission of the stock - I can't imagine how "soupy" this would be with that added in.

I cooked the chicken in water with Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce along with some liquid smoke.  This gave the chicken a bit of a "punch".  I then shredded the chicken in a food processor to get the consistency I was looking for.  

I substituted real shredded cheddar cheese for the processed cheese.

Finally, I recommend tasting the mixture before putting it together in the pan.  Believe it or not, it was a bit bland (for my taste anyhow).  I ended up adding some Frank's Red Hot to the mixture to "kick it" a bit.

Final product was a gooey goodness that is best described as a "enchilada cobler".  A must try in my opinion.

OH how I love this recipe!!  I have made it several times and the kids love it!!  The leftovers never last 24 hours- it is just as good reheated as fresh!  I do, however, omit the broth to make it a little less runny!

Really yummy & easy recipe. I agree with others & I left out the chicken broth. I also added the black beans in addition to a can of corn. I served it on a bed of lettuce with sour cream & crumbled tortilla chips. Everyone loved it!

Absolutely amazing!!! I have the worlds pickiest husband who never tries new things and this was was hit with him. I too omitted the chicken broth, and drained the tomatoes. It was not runny at all , it was perfect ! I used The brand "Rotel " for my tomatoes and chili " loved it !! I also added black beans. I definitely recommend to double or triple the corn tortillas. I used one layer and they seed to have disappeared.

This was quite soupy and very mushy. I would suggest making it with shredded cheddar instead of processed cheese.

This was a good, tasty recipe. This what I added/changed:  For one cup of broth, I added 1 cup of my cooking liquid flavored with bouillon granules and black pepper.  I added a can of black beans and a can of Mexi-corn (I drained everything).  I added one tsp. of cumin.  I used a 16 oz. block of Mexican Velveeta.  I sprinkled a Mexican blend of cheese in between each layer (8 oz. in all).   I also added black olives at the end like a previous reviewer.   Mine came out the perfect consistency and after 10 minutes it was like a solid Italian lasagna.

I made this last night for dinner.  Had good flavor, but based on other reviews I did leave out the chicken stock.  I thought it was good, but a little too saucy for me, this is however being very picky on my part.  I added cilantro to mine, but kept with the basic version...wanted to see what I felt needed to change after actually making it per the given recipe.  Heat was good enought for my 5 & 6 years olds, so it's very kid friendly.  I just felt it needed more spices or someting to sop up all those extra juices/cheese.

I didn't have any garlic powder, and since recipe called for such a small amount, don't think it made much of a difference. I also didn't have any Velveeta, so put in shredded Mexican cheese. The last thing I changed was based on some other reviews. The chicken broth, I lowered the amount to 3/4 cup. Turned out very good, even good the next day heated up. Give it a try, you won't be dissappointed!

ok, so, I read the reviews and changed up the recipe just a bit!  First off I had to cut the recipe in half because well, I don't have that many people to cook for! So I used 2 chicken breasts instead of weighing out a pound, then instead of cubing, I boiled and shredded my chicken. it helps hold things hold together a bit more, and then after mixing the cheese into the sauce, when layering, I sprinkled a little more in there!  I also added olives to the top instead of the jalepeno's.  This turned out delicious, and eating it as left overs has been PERFECT!!!

To make this for two toddlers in my family, here's what I did (I made in an 8 by 8 square pan), because there's only 4 of us

1 can of diced tomatoes DRAINED, about 10 oz of MILD enchilada sauce, 1 can of cream of chicken, dash or two of both onion and garlic powders, 2 cooked and diced chicken breasts. I omitted the chilis, and chili powder.

Like someone else suggested, I saved about 3/4 cup of the sauce BEFORE I added the chicken so that I could put the sauce on the bottom of the pan and on the very top layer, on top of the last layer of tortillas I put on.

Also, I used grated cheddar cheese ,not the american/velveeta.

I give this 5 stars this way. It's mild enough for toddlers, but still has enough flavor for adults.

I made this dish the second time this weekend.  This is a fairly tasty recipe, except it's kind of too wet for the tortilla.  I used 16 corn tortilla and it just turned out right.  Next time, I will definitely cut down on the broth.  This past weekend, I saute the onion and garlic first.  I also used 1 cup beer, added a bunch of chopped cilantro and tons of chili powder and cumin.

This recipe was really GOOD!! I ommited the Chicken Broth and the cheese spread and added coby-jack about 1/4 to the mix then grated the cheese in each layer. Next time I think i might add rice it was still a little runny.

This caserole really had the potential to be great. The flavors all mesh so well. Next time instead of the processed cheese I will layer the ingredients with real cheese so it is more like an enchilada lasagna. You must also reduce the amount of broth used, otherwise it is a tasty, juicy mess.

This recipe really caught my eye, but I didn't have all the ingredients.  I loved the lasagna type style but with strips of flour tortillas.  I cooked some enchalida like chicken, layered and continued on with my imagination. i.e. salsa, beans, cottage cheese, tabasco.  GREAT!!!

MMMM..  I love this stuff!  One thing that is an absolute MUST for me, is that there HAS to be fresh cilantro to put on the top.  Maybe even a dash of sour cream?   The fresh cilantro leaves makes this dish taste sooooo fantastic.  This is a great dish Kyle.  Pass the chips and margaritas!!

This casserole was so tasty, I'm making it for the second time in less than two weeks! I do agree with another review that it's best to drain tomatoes and use real cheese instead of processed. The first time I made it, I used chicken broth as directed, but it was a bit runny. This time I'm only using about a third of what was suggested in the recipe and it's going to be PERFECT! Highly recommend this one and will add it to my favorites for sure!

We liked it but the processed cheese overpowered everything. My husband and I called this nacho casserole because that's exactly what it tastes like. You couldn't taste any other flavors except the cheese and chicken. We might make it again but will have to tweak it per some of the other reviews.

Delicious.  Had to alter with ingredients on hand, which is why four stars and not five.  Used the meat from store bought rotiserrie chicken, no green chiles on hand, so added some medium salsa for the heat.  No processed cheese so used an 8 oz bag of shredded cheddar, not melted in the mixture, but layered on top of chicken mixture like you would do in a lasagna.  Flour tortillas instead of corn, and added a can of drained and rinsed black beans. Left out the chicken broth because I thought it would make the chicken mixture too soupy.  No chili powder, so added some cumin. Well recieved by adults and kids.

Yummy with these changes: crushed corn chips instead of tortillas, 1/8 tsp cayenne to the sauce, 1 tsp garlic powder, and a mixture of jack/cheddar cheese for the topping.

We didn't care for this much at all.  We felt all the cream soups diluted the wonderful mexican flavors that we so enjoy from enchiladas.  It wasn't terrible by any means, but for all the extra calories, & subdued flavor, we will stick with our own tried & true enchilada recipe. This just made us want to fix our standard version:(

These are so easy to make and have great favour. I did make a couple of changes but only to make prep time even faster. Instead of chicken breast I used a whole roasted chicken from the grocery store and removed all the meat and chopped it up (skin removed), I also used a 4 cup pack of kraft tex mex cheese, 2 cloves fresh garlic instead of powdered that I sauted with the onions. I mixed it all together in a bowl (did not heat on the stove first) then layered like lasagna, topped with remaining cheese and baked. It was fastastic, and my boyfriend liked it better then the Enchiladas that take me a whole day to make.

I poached the chicken breasts in chicken broth beforehand. Left out the chicken broth and the cream of celery soup - it turned out great! My b/f says don't change a thing but I'd add even more corn tortillas.

This was good for a quick dinner. I cooked the chicken in about 1/2 c. water with the seasonings and used that for "broth". Added both cans of soup, Rotel (tomatoes/chilies) & green enchilada sauce. I also cut the tortillas into strips and used shredded cheese rather than velveeta (I don't keep that on hand). This may have changed the texture of the casserole, but it didn't seem very soupy to me. I made this for my husband and toddler before leaving for a different dinner function and they ate half the dish by themselves. I've now eaten a good size portion and barely have enough to call leftovers (for a family of 2 1/2-that's saying something). So even if you play with the ingredients slightly, I don't think this recipe can fail much.

Great recipe. However, I did make a few modifications. I cooked chicken tenders in the crock pot with a jar of chunky homemade salsa on low for 6 hours. I used this as the chicken meat, after I added the soup. The result was delicious!

This was so good! I can see myself making this again this week. I did not add the cream of chicken soup due to the reviews of it being too runny. I also did not include the salsa and put it in a side dish. I used black beans, it was just awesome! I would suggest to use 1/2 cup onions, seemed like there were not enough in there for me. I added chopped green onion on the top for a finishing touch. All gone, not even a bite left for leftovers!

I will be making this recipe again for sure. My husband and I loved it. I made a few changes though. I halved the recipe, used 1 can of cream of chicken, omitted all of the chiles and anything that could cause it to be spicy because my husband does not like spicy food. I used the full amount of tortillas so the casserole wouldn't be soupy, and I added some shredded cheddar cheese on top. The casserole turned out perfect and was very tasty. Thanks so much!

This is an awesome recipe! I was looking for an easy new recipe and this is it. Like a lot of the reviewers I used shredded cheese instead of the cheese spread. It turned out wonderful and I got complements from everyone at dinner that evening. Thanks for a great new recipe. (And it freezes well too!)

I made this recipe as written, except I left out the chili powder (because of kids). It was too runny for a casserole, but the flavor was very good. The kids used tortilla chips to eat it.  Next time I'll make it without the corn tortillas and use it as Mexican cheese dip.

Very quick and easy!! I substituted flour tortillas, added black beans, (drained and rinsed) used shredded cheese, a rotisserie chicken shredded, and no chicken broth. I had one odd tortilla left and I cut it up and put it on top just so it didn't go yo waste. I accidentally grabbed "chile enchilada sauce" but it actually tasted pretty good.

When I make this again I will put the chicken in the crockpot before I leave for work so all I have to do is assemble when I get home.   Also, I think I'll leave the green chilies out next time, the girls thought it was a bit spicy. De-lish!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly (except I subbed shredded cheese for processed cheese).  A lot of reviewers complain that it was too runny, but if you cook down some of the liquid, it comes out as it is supposed to.
The second time I made this I made the following changes: add a can of black beans, used all low sodium/low fat soups, subbed no sodium diced tomatoes for tomatoes w/ chiles (drained), add jalapenos, omit broth, sub shredded cheese for processed cheese, omit the extra step of cooking on the stovetop.  Came out great!

Nice casserole, but didn't use that much chili powder, our family's choice. Makes enough for one to eat, and one for the freezer or to share.

This was really good. I always tweak recipes with ingredients I have on hand. I used cream cheese instead of the processed cheese like velvetta. I wanted to use up the corn tortillas so I used the 15 I had left instead of 10. I used fresh diced tomatoes and it was not a bit runny. Delicious!

I liked this, my husband loved it. I couldn't make it true to the recipe because I didn't have everything on hand but it still worked out well! I substited the can of cream of chicken soup for cheese soup, omitted the processed cheese, chicken broth, and the can of diced green chiles. I used hot enchilada sauce and added cumin and black beans and sprinkled the top with shredded cheese. It was VERY spicy, much to the delight of my husband. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was an incredible hit with my entire family, even the picky ones! Some of the other reviewers noted it was dry, but I found it to be extremely moist and flavorful. I did take the advice of some other reviewers and substituted real cheese for the processed cheese, and it turned out beautifully! I also shredded the chicken instead of cubing it, and it spread evenly throughout the casserole. Great recipe, will definitely make again!

My whole family LOVED this!!!  This is definately a keeper!  I had thought I was going to make chicken tacos so I had cooked the chicken with a packet of taco seasoning.  It ended up adding a nice spice though and it was delicious!!!

I doubled this recipe for our family reunion. I did take others' advice and nitched the chicken broth. I cut down my prep time by using a cut up rotisserie chicken instead, and real shredded cheddar cheese. It came out fantastic. Everyone, including the kids, chowed down on this casserole. Family members asked for a copy of the recipe! Doubling the recipe made so much that we had it a 2nd night! Even doubling this recipe and springing for the added cost of rotisserie chickens and cheddar cheese, the meal can fit into anyone's budget! About $1 per person! Will be sure to make again, just smaller portions ;o)

I changed the recipe a bit also. I used sour cream instead of the chicken broth in order to maybe thicken it up a bit. It was still a bit wet and the cream made it really rich. I also substituted Cream of Mushroom for Cream of Celery. The kids loved it and the grown-ups each had two bowls. Next time no sour cream, just on top :)

The whole family enjoyed this one. Rather than use cooked and diced chicken, I cooked raw chicken breasts in the broth, and shredded it. I used shredded cheddar jack instead of processed cheese. We had the left overs the next day for lunch, it was good re-heated.

This recipe is very good. I did change a few things per the other reviews. Omitted the chicken broth completely, used shredded Cheddar cheese, and replaced the tomatoes for chopped red pepper. Yum! Thanks, Kyle.

Followed the recipe except left out the extra chili's; used 10 oz rotel & it was WAY to liquidy.  Baked for 1 hour & it wouldn't thicken. After sitting in the frig overnite it thickened.  No one liked it, we had a Mexican Christmas lunch & this was the FLOP. Threw the recipe away & this will NEVER be served in my house again.  I get recipes off this site all the time & this was the only bad experience I've ever had.

We loved this recipe..I made it for my boyfriend. He wanted it again the following weekend! I left out the green chiles since the tomatoes had chiles. I also omitted the chicken broth. I was not sure if cheese spread was cream cheese? I used Mexican shredded cheese...it was great!!

I would like to thank everyone who has tried this recipe and reviewed it. The changes made are great!  I've never had a problem with it being runny. I think I made a mistake with the amount of tortillas. Use what you need to make the layers. This recipe has been here for years!  Thanks to all that tried it, and thanks to those who suggested changes. A recipe is just a guide, go from there and enjoy.

this recipe was very yummy. I took out the chicken broth and i didnt add the cheese to the mixture. I layered like a lasgna and added the cheese on top with tortilla chips to help thicken it up and it was very delicous. my husband absolutley loved. I also created little appetizer snacks by using the tosito scoop chips. I put a little chicken with a little mixture in the chip and added the cheese on top and they were great snacks during cookouts!

This always gets rave reviews at potluck dinners. I followed others advice and omitted the cr of celery soup and chicken; added more enchilada sauce; used shredded cheese. Try heating/cooking the tortillas (briefly) on a stove before layering on the casserole. It really brings out the flavor. Everyone who tried it really liked it!

My husband and I love this recipe.  I make it without the chicken broth so it isn't too watery.  I make spanish rice and corn bread on the side, it is to die for.  You couldn't get anything this good in a Mexican resturant!!!

I opted to shred the chicken and it worked well. Also, like others did, I found the result to be fairly soupy. Maybe we were supposed to drain the tomatoes and chilies? Or maybe I'll omit the chicken broth next time, like others did.
With those quibbles, I have to say this was a wonderfully tasty dish. I'm only one person, so it lasted for days. And I'll surely make this again, perhaps with some of the others' suggested changes.
Thanks for a great recipe!

i, too, am very bad in waiting so long to review this recipe.  this was DELICIOUS!...i did doctor it a bit as well, i made it spicier and added a bit of corn and rice.  also, took out the chicken broth.  VERY GOOD.  next time i will probably add some black beans as well.  the only thing i can say is wrong with it, is that it makes toooooo much food for me!....lol, of course i am single and live alone so that is typical....do give it a try!

Very good I also left out the chicken broth and the consistancy was still a little runny. The taste makes up for the runniness.

OK, but not great. Followed earlier suggestions and cut down the broth, but it was still kind of runny. Had to use TWO packages of corn tortillas for layering. A little too spicy for the kids. Probably not a repeat recipe for us.

This is such a delicious dish! Although, I do have two young daughters who thought it was a little spicy, my husband and I loved it.  I will have to make some adjustments in the future.  Maybe I'll try serving them first, and then I will sprinkle in some chile powder for my husband and I.(the spicy food lovers) Thanks for a very easy and tasty recipe.

Tastes great--nice and spicy too.  The only criticism I have is that there is too much liquid in the recipe and it was rather runny.  Next time, I would cut out the chicken broth, cut down on the soups (maybe 1/2 of each or use one or the other) and cut down on the velveeta slightly.  I think that would solve the problem completely!

My husband and I did not really care for this recipe. I omitted the chicken broth entirely and the texture came out perfect. However, it was very salty and tasted too processed for us. I will not be making this dish for dinner again.

This was a great dish to make! It was too runny for me though. I think next time I will use less chicken broth!

I made a Mexican feast and invited over my sisters and their families. This casserole was literally gone in ten minutes. It was just spicy enough for us - we don't like bland food. My sister was still raving about it days later. This one was so delicious, I will definely be making it on a regular basis. Everyone, you MUST try this recipe! I cut down on the chicken broth, and drained the tomatoes and the chilies, and the dish was NOT runny at all. It was perfect. Thank you for this recipe!!!

FANTASTIC!!  I followed suggestions from previous reviews and cut the chicken broth to 1/3 cup, omitted the chiles and cut the tortillas into strips,  It came out perfect!  Just spicey enough for the kids to not only clear their plates, but empty two glasses of Milk each!  Will certainly make again!

I pretty much stuck to the recipe, but changed the following (sorry in advance for imprecise measurements. I cook how I paint, in utter chaos.):
 Instead of the processed cheese dip I used a mix of Shredded Queso Quesadilla cheese and Shredded Taco Blend cheese. I added this to the mixture in the 5qt pan and then additional between layers. 
I don't know what Enchilada Sauce is and I couldn't find any pre-made so I left it out. 
2 cans rotel with chilies (drained) instead of diced tomatoes. Still kept the can and of chilies. 
Real garlic (instead of garlic powder) sautéed in a skillet with butter and chopped onion until caramelized. 
Added 1 microwave bag of Instant Spanish Rice (cooked).
Added 1 can black beans (rinsed and drained).
Added 1 can of sliced black olives (rinsed and drained).
Used 1/2 pack taco seasoning instead of chili powder. 
Diced jalapeños (to taste).
2 chicken breasts shredded with a fork instead of cubed. 
Tore up corn tortillas into bite sized pieces instead of leaving them whole.
Instead of baking in a 9x13 dish, I used a large cast iron skillet.
My family LOVED this recipe!

I followed the suggestions of others and left out the broth and processed cheese. I used shredded cheese. I have to admit I was a little lire of using cream of celery but it was good. I don’t think you need to drain the rotel as suggested. Very good!

Just a few tips for everyone trying this recipe for the first time... it’s extremely saucy and everyone seems to agree. Being saucy is fine... the problem is corn tortillas are very very thin.. so next time I make it... I will double the corn tortillas. Take two tortillas and use that as ONE tortilla.. you might THINK that’s a lot of tortilla but it’s not. In Mexican restaurants they serve the authentic tacos with two corn tortillas as one because there so thin and weak. And also... MORE cheese next time. Over all the dish is ‘good’... some chopped up romaine lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and salsa next to it will make everything come together perfectly as well.

2 stars for the recipe itself missing steps and ingredients.

finely shredded cheddar cheese can be used instead of cheese spread also

need extra shredded cheese to top the pan with before cooking and black olives 

cut the shells into quarters to make layering easier

This recipe was perfect for what I needed: something new but easy to cook with ingredients I already had at home. 
I substituted a second can of cream of chicken for the celery soup. I used a 28oz. can of red enchilada sauce and skipped the chicken broth. I doubled the number of tortillas and warmed them in the microwave before layering (it was nice not having to soften them in hot oil for a change!). 
The Velveeta cheese, combined with the spicy tomatoes, gave the whole dish a nice, rich new flavor (compared to my old enchilada recipes).
I cooked this for lunch today for my husband and his friends. They loved it and there was hardly any left over.

This is so good! I also added a third layer of corn tortillas so 6 tortillas on each layer. I followed the recipe except also added a teaspoon of cumin, used 4 cloves garlic instead of powdered and clarified the onions with the garlic before adding. I also added the large can of drained sliced olives. I think next time I will even use the liquid from the 10 ounce can (I couldn’t find a 14.5 ounce can) of stewed tomatoes with green chilies and the liquid from the can of mild green chilies. I had no problem with it being to soupy like some said. It may even add more flavor. Oh, and of course I added extra real cheddar jack to the layers also. It made extra which we put it into a small round ceramic dish the size of the tortillas otherwise you could assemble it in the larger size glass Pyrex up from the 9x13 one suggested. May even add extra chicken broth to compensate for the extra tortillas that will be used. I love cheese so all in all I used a 2 pound block??

Delicious!!!!  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions. I got a mojo rotisserie chicken and pulled it apart and I love the mix of dark and light meat. used 16oz of shredded cheddar and Mexican cheese mix. Drained all tomatoes and chilis.  Instead of including the chicken broth, I dunked the strips of tortilla in the chicken broth to absorb some flavor before layering. It was even better the next day. Only change I would make next time would be to us more chili powder to give more spice. That said, I can't wait to make it again!!

Give it a 5 for simplicity and flavor, a 4 for authenticity.  I added cumin, extra garlic powder and chili powder . Used shredded Colby Jack cheese atop each layer instead of incorporating cheese spread  in the hot mixture.

Made the following changes: omit chicken broth and drain tomatoes (as advised in reviews); omit cream of celery soup and use shredded real cheese instead of processed cheese spread (personal preference) ; add dehydrated onion instead of fresh (allergy); omit green chilies (only because I didn't have any); and omit garlic and chili powder (due to being a smidge forgetful while I was cooking tonight LOL). Even after all that, this turned out phenomenal. Next time, and there Will be a next time,  I'll add a can of corn, a cup or so of black beans, and a few more tortillas. So delicious. Thank you!

I know that based on this review that it is hard to believe that I don't like changing recipes to much. It is more like you are giving a review of your own recipe. However, based on other reviews, I did not use the chicken stock, used a TexMex cheese mix in place of the Velveeta and added black beans. I did use the meat of an entire roasted chicken that I shredded in place of the chicken breasts. The resulting mixture with the soups, green chilies, enchilada sauce and all the rest of the ingredients of the recipe was delicious, I just mixed everything in a big bowl.  I layered the cheese with each layer (three layers in total), topped with more cheese,  and put it in a larger baking casserole dish. Prepared a topping mixture of finely diced green, red and yellow peppers, a seeded and finely diced serrano chili and sliced green onion that I put on the casserole for the last 15 minutes of cooking time.  Made the decision to make it the night before, refrigerate and bake for a little over one hour (maybe 1 hour 15 mins) when getting ready for the dinner party. We had a nine person dinner party and still had a few leftovers. Everyone loved it, my husband said I outdid myself, that it was definitely 5 star meal. I also made Mexican stuffed mushrooms, Spanish style bacon fried rice, guacamole and Pico de Gallo (recipes from other sites) and one of the guests brought a taco salad.  Even my three kids raved about the food especially the chicken enchilada casserole.

Started making this then realized I was out of chicken so I just threw in a can of drained black beans and a can of pinto beans instead. Omitted broth and did shredded cheese like many other folks. Some corn and red peppers to the mix as well. SO SO delicious. I think I'll just keep making this bean version anyway next time because it was such a hit!

This was easy, and a Major hit! The only thing that I would change in the ingredients is double the chicken, and use the next size of baking dish (and a couple more tortillas) as a result. To make it even easier, I put all except the cheese spread and tortillas in a crock pot in the morning, then when I got home after work I fished out the chicken SHREADED it, put it back in, then added the cheese, stirred, then finished putting in the baking dish and baked as directed.

Turned out really well, however, I didn't have the processed cheese spread so I substituted with 8 oz cream cheese and doubled the enchilada sauce.  Makes it not even the same recipe, but it turned out great.

I read the reviews and omitted the chicken broth.  I added black beans as one review recommended; I also made sure that the tomatoes and beans were well drained.  I cut the corn tortillas into strips and diced the chicken first to make it easier to serve with a spoon and it came out perfect.  Great recipe, with a bit of tweaking.

Five stars after following the suggestions from the "most helpful positive review". My family loved this and it made for equally as tasty leftovers. I served it with mexican rice. I will definitely make this again.

We absolutely LOVE this dish!  The only change I made was omitting the chicken broth.  I can't tell you how much my family and friends enjoy this dish.   I like topping mine with sour cream.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Absolutely loved the flavor but it was too runny.  I'm wondering if a dump cake style preparation would work.  Sort of like a combined chicken and biscuits.

Pretty good but only with the alterations I made. I can't imagine making this the way the recipe actually states. I think it would've been a runny, bland mess had I made it to the t. That said, here are the changes I made. I cooked my chicken the way I would as if I were making chicken tacos and thats by taking chicken in a pan, with a tablespoon of butter and sauteeing and then adding a package of taco seasoning. I'm sooooo glad I did this. I think it really saved the dish. I, like other reviewers also omitted the broth and cream of celery. I used corn tortillas and everything else spice wise was the same. 
However, even though I seasoned my chicken, in the end the casserole overall was still just slightly too bland for my tastes. Next time I make this I might try adding another can of chilis and extra chili powder or do more taco seasoning for the chicken. 
Also, I have to note that a lot of people are saying that it's still too runny after not using the broth and extra can of soup. This was not the case for me. It did come out very nice and stayed in one piece when I plated it. And it also reheated beautifully. Recommend this one but only with the tweaks!

I was not as impressed with this recipe as I thought I would be. I followed the directions precisely and while it made plenty, enough to feed a large family. I found it to be rather bland. Not sure yet what I would change to give it the kick it needs.

Followed directions to the letter, except I used five large flour tortillas (torn up) instead of the corn tortillas (family preference). Served with a salad and tortilla chips on the side (to dip in the cheesey sauce).  My 17 year-old son and two of his friends loved it!

This meal was pretty good but a little too runny even without the chicken stock.  We also found it a little too spicy.  I will probably try to make this again but make a few changes.

We loved this!  It was relatively easy too.  Made some alterations as per other reviews:  strained the tomatoes & omitted the chicken broth.  I used 2 cans of the cream of chicken (instead of celery) and used the Mexican Velveta also....although I left out a bit of the 16 oz so that I could sprinkle the top of the casserole with shredded chedder cheese.  I also cooked the chicken in some crushed red pepper, black pepper, and the garlic powder for flavor.  This dish was not runny and nicely spicy.  My husband loved it.

This is a pretty good casserole recipe. I used a bone-in split chicken, which I boiled and picked. This also gave me the broth for the recipe. I also used 12 tortillas, and a generic velveeta from Kroger. It was a queso blanco with Jalapenos which added a little spice. All in all, a great go to recipe which could be made ahead.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it last night but did do a few tweaks based on other reviews.  I left out the chicken broth.  I added a can of black beans (drained & rinsed) and I used shredded mexican cheese instead of velveta.  I just had leftovers for lunch and I must say... it tastes even better the 2nd day.

This was a disappointing recipe.  My husband and I both really enjoy Mexican influenced recipes and this had no Mexican flavor.  It tasted like a bunch of soups thrown together that caused a very mushy casserole.  We will not be having this one again!

This was good--not my kind of dish but hubby and my son gave it 4.5 stars, so it'll have to be a part of the rotation. I too omitted the chicken broth and it was still a bit watery. Oh, and I bet the sauce would be great as dip!

I won't say that this was terrible, because it isn't. It just does not have any real flavor. The canned soups overwhelm the whole thing. Save yourself some time and just eat the Cream of Celery soup, because that is all that this tastes like. I even tried to make it spicer by using diced jalapenos instead of green chiles and salsa con queso instead of the cheese spread. The upside was that the preparation was very simple. . . the downside is that we did not care for this recipe.

This recipe is great.  I plan to use it also as a dip for tortilla chips.  It is pretty spicy but my husband loves spicy food...but that can be adjusted for preference.  Will make this recipe over and over.  As others stated, I left out the broth so it wouldn't be so runny.

This casserole is absolutely wonderful.  Although I omitted the cream of chicken soup and only added one cup of water to the cream of celery soup.  I also added a can of rinsed black beans.  
This truely is like a mexican lasagna that you will want to eat for a few days.

Enchilada's are very flexible as to what you put inside.  So as a casserole, you just layer it.  I think I got three layers of tortillas (and I always use corn tortillas).   It is too runny with the chicken broth, so I did leave it out this time (I've made it twice).  Instead of cream of celery (which I didn't have) I added a block of cream cheese (which I've had before in enchilada casserole and it's amazing).  I did NOT put the enchilada sauce IN the chicken mixture because it definitely would have been too runny... this should be layered in my opinion with the tortillas, chicken mixture and THEN sauce.  I topped it with sauce, then cheese and olives.  If I had more cheese, I would've layered cheese in this too.  (and not processed cheese please)    I wanted to add beans to my chicken mixture, but forgot.  I think this would have been good as well.  So as a recipe, this one doesn't quite deserve 5 stars, but with all the adjustments, it really is flexible and a good base.  I don't think it's really very traditional and I'm sure we are hacking it all to heck, but it turns out delicious!!!

I was not fond of this recipe. It was VERY runny (I should have followed some of the earlier suggestions to cut down on the soups)and it did not have an appealing apperance at all. It wsa tasty but it looked very unappetizing.
