I love stracciatella - and this is fairly close to what I am used to making.  Instead of adding pasta, however, we usually add around 3 or 4 eggs and - this sounds wierd, but - spinach!  Once the spinach has wilted in the soup, I add the cheese, and I usually add a generous handful of romano and a dash of salt and pepper.  With these changes not only do you have an extremely healthy soup, you have a delicious one!

What a great, easy, nourishing soup! I followed the recipe exactly except used orzo instead of ditalini and parm instead of romano. I can only imagine how much better it would be with homemade chicken stock. And I think some minced scallions or chives would be a great addition.

This recipe was DELISH!  I was in the mood to make some soup during the cold weather, but I wanted something simple too.  I didn't have Romano, so I substituted the Parmesan I had.  And I omitted the nutmeg because I didn't have it either.  I added fresh black peppercorn because I love pepper, and it tasted great... thanks for such an easy and simple recipe.  This will definitely be something I make over and over again.

This is one of my favorite soups that my grandmother used to make all the time. I took her variations on it though: I omitted the pasta, and I added spinach, carrots and peas. It is a pretty incredible soup and super easy!

I really enjoyed this soup.  Very simple to prepare.  I followed all of the directions except I used farfalle b/c it was the pasta I had on hand.  I broke it into smaller pieces, it worked perfectly.  I also added a little squeeze of lemon as I was eating it.  The cheese and the broth are salty so next time I will go with a lower sodium broth.  Thanks for sharing this great and easy recipe

What a quick, great tasting soup! Normally I do not care for parsley, but I found that it tasted great in this soup. Wonderful recipe, I didn't modify a thing. Ginny, thank you!

This is so delicious!  I love soup and wanted something different so, when I found this I couldn't wait to try it and I'm glad I did.  It uses things already in your fridge.  I changed it a little though; I didn't use the cheese because of allergies, I used Pesto Seasoning in place of the fresh parsley and I added fresh peppercorn too.  This will definitely be a staple in my house from now on.  Thanks so much Ginny!    Update: I made this again tonight w/beef broth and soy sauce.  Still very tasty!

My entire family loved this soup! It's easy to make with only seven ingredients. I made several servings, but it all disappeared in a day. I did substitute many of the ingredients, but it turned out great anyway. My substitutions were:

Angel hair pasta instead of ditalini
Swiss cheese for Romano
Dried parsley instead of fresh

When I stirred in the grated Swiss cheese, it melted in the water and the angel hair pasta started sticking to it. It was wonderful nonetheless when I felt like soup and found lots of eggs in the fridge. Thanks!

I felt there was too much broth for the amount of ingredients. I did love the flavor of the nutmeg!! If I make it again I will use only 1 can of broth and a bit more nutmeg.

This was so easy and really good.  I added a tbs of lemon juice and one boullion cube.  Doubled the recipe.
