I made this recipe for my boys and they LOVED IT!! The only difference that I did was seared for 5 mins each side with olive oil and butter then put it in the oven at 350. I also put some red wine and butter in the searing pan to take off every little bit and simmer it, excellent to top the tritip once cooked. Great recipe, easy and tasty.

Good Recipe!  

However, I did want to mention that the tri-tip and culoutte are completely different cuts of beef and need to be cooked differently.  The culoutte comes off of the top butt and is known as the top butt cap, or Picanha if you are from Brazil.  The tri-tip comes from the bottom sirloin.  The recipe above is great for a tri-tip, but not for the culotte.

I just want to mention that having the term "bottom round sirloin" is incorrect and actually misleading. I wouldn't say anything if it was just incorrect, but having the word ROUND in there could really screw somebody up into getting the wrong roast and making an awful dish.
Tri tip is also known as the "bottom sirloin", not bottom round sirloin. The tri tip comes from the Loin primal, which is next to the Round primal, but is entirely different. This is important because there is a "Bottom Round" roast that you do NOT want to buy if you're preparing this recipe.
All I'm trying to say is the word Round should not be anywhere in this recipe, and if you can change that, I would highly advise it (:

I love the mix of spices but it came out extremely salty. Next time I will use onion, celery, etc. powder versus salts. I braised all sides 2 min. each in a deep pan, then added 1/2 cup beef broth and 1/2 cup red wine into the pan, then cooked covered for 40 min. covered, then transferred the roast to a rack and finished it off for 30 min. at 300 degrees uncovered. I then cooked down the remaining pan liquids into a gravy.  Using powders and not salts and cooking this way I'd give it a 5! Can't wait to make it again with that change.

Fabulous roast!  Followed recipe exactly - juicy, flavorful, tender. Hubby declared this a 'tasty morsel!' (There are no salts in this recipe, so not sure why one reviewer found it too salty.) We loved it.

DELICIOUS marinade for this roast!  I made a reduction out of the pan drippings and leftover marinade, which turned out simply divine.  Served with mashed potatoes, it was a great combination.  I didn't try the oven instructions given, because I wanted to try a 500' method mentioned in another tri tip roast recipe.  I will definitely try the oven instructions written here, in the future.

No changes to the recipe.  This is a very good and easy recipe.  I did bake in a cast iron skillet...made mashed potatoes and fresh corn on the cob...doesn't get much better than that!!!!

Made two nights ago and hubby loved it!  I totally forgot to add the red wine and was worried that it would be dry - it wasn't!  Cooking it at 450 degrees seems to seal in the juices - no need to sear it first!  The blend of herbs was perfect.  Another review commented on it being too salty - I added 1 tsp of sea salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper and it worked out well. we LOVE garlic so I also added 1 tsp of granulated garlic .  Served with mashed potatoes, broccoli and  a salad.

I followed the recipe but had to substitute Dijon mustard for dry.  It came out wonderful.  Tender enough for my husband, who has difficulty swallowing to eat it.  It goes in my make this again folder.   First time I have ever made a roast outside of using a crock pot.

Very easy prep and cooking! I added granulated garlic to the rub and more wine to keep it moist, just because I had over 2.5 lbs of meat.

I roasted the tri-tip on the bbq using the indirect method. The marinade was good and added a nice twist.

This is a very simple guide to making a delicious roast. I cheated a little bit in that I needed something for the evening, so I let the meat and the spices (with some garlic olive oil) set on the counter in a bag for a few hours turning frequently... The cooking instructions are perfect. For the other single dad's out there just learning, remember to get a covered pot that can take that heat and remember that lid is still really hot for a long time!!! I learned that the hard way about 10 years ago...   thinking about my peeps out there.

This is a perfect recipe for its simplicity and accuracy.

Varied the seasonings a little just using what I had.  My roast was 2 lbs.  15 minutes at 450 and another 20 at 350 got me to 150 degrees.  After sitting for another 10 it was medium to medium rare in the middle and medium to well on the outer edges.  Very flavorful, quite tender, oh so easy.

I enjoyed this recipe and makes a great marinade. I took one reviewer's suggestion of searing it first with butter and olive oil and that gave it a nice color and roasted it for another 20 minutes and it came out perfect

I followed the recipe as written and it was very good. Because of timing issues I only marinated the tri tip for about an hour and it was still very good.

I will be making this again.

I made this as written, no changes other than searing it in a cast iron skillet. Great cooking method that resulted in a perfectly cooked, tender roast. I would definitely add fresh garlic to the marinating liquid and cut back on the herbs, personal preference. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely loved this!!! I couldn't stop eating it and that is rare for me because I usually don't like just eating pieces of meat. My husband said the seasoning kept getting stuck in his teeth (thyme maybe) so I will have to figure out how to keep that from happening next time!!!

I fixed it exactly as recipe described but my
tri tip was already prepared in a marinade
I place it in a small roasting pan. . and old fashion
speckled granite wear pans
I just could not believe how delicious it was
and perfect temperature for 15" at 450 and
25" at 350
It also had some lovely au jus for the 
thinly sliced.
1.27 pounds. I had some last night and 2 more
servings for later.
I plan to keep this recipe as it is marvelous

Great oven cooking instructions, pretty rear in some pieces, cover and cook a little longer if rare is not your choice. The blended seasonings was a little extreme, good but something was a little off with the seasonings.

My meat came out medium rare like my daughter loves to eat it.  The wine adds a great flavor while it bakes.  You can add different spices if you want to change it up a little.  Definitely a keeper of a recipe.

I absolutely love it! I followed the recipe and made two small additions to add more flavor. I placed two sprigs of fresh rosemary from my garden on the top and on the bottom of the roast after putting the roast in the bag to marinade (for about 16 hours). I also added more red wine to the roasting pan, and two halved russet potatoes. It came out perfect and was full of flavor. I will definitely make it again!

Really good herby flavor, even though I didn't make it as published because i needed something on the table ASAP. Didn't marinate, didn't use the red wine. Just rubbed the herb mixture into the meat and threw it in the preheated oven. Followed the roasting instructions from that point, and this meat is gooooood. Next time I'll plan ahead lol.

I followed the recipe as posted with the exception of instead of adding the red wine I added fresh minced garlic. I also cooked it in a pan with a raise rack so it would get nice and crusty all over. I cooked it until the internal temperature was 140° internally and when I cut it it was perfectly pink inside. I cut it Tenley and I had toasted Shibata bread with provolone cheese And an aujus Dipping sauce, needless to say it was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed that recipe, it was delicious and I will use it again??

It was so delicious. I don't like pink meat so I put a loose lid on it the last 15 minutes and it was perfect!  Not even tough at all.

I followed the recipe to the letter, it was awful.  The spices did not work together at all, they were overwhelming.  The meat was juicy and tender, which was good I just couldn't handle the spice combination.

The flavor was honestly just OK.  I made this and it did get eaten but my honest opinion it wasn't anything to rage about. I love cooking and trying out new recipes.  This was my 1st attempt at cooking a Tri Tip and I will definitely try different seasonings  for the next attempt.

This was an easy recipe to follow; just remember to start in the morning to allow for 8 hours of marinating. Our roast did not brown as nicely as in the photo, and cooked more quickly than the recipe suggested. So I really recommend using the thermometer to keep an eye on it. The finished result was out-of-this-world good.  The  rub  was savory, although I had to substitute for marjoram (1/2 sage, 1/2 mint mix).
