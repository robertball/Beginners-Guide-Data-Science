This bread was simple to make and the fresh thyme gave it an excellent flavor. The dough was too thick for my bread machine to knead, so I ended up mixing and kneading by hand. I found the texture to be a bit dense and chewy, but it made a great dipping bread (my family thought it tasted great with extra virgin olive oil).

Pretty good basic bread. It was a bit dry so I added maybe 1/4 cup of water. Still that's not a big deal--it all depends on the humidity when you make it that depends on how much flour you need. It's a bit crumbly although I'm thinking that might be my fault. I set the timer then went downstairs so I couldn't hear it...oops! Bread didn't burn just got a bit over done so the crust was hard to cut. Other than that it is a good basic bread. nothing spectacular but it's good for sandwiches if a bit crumbly (but again that might be bc I overbaked it a bit). Thanks for the recipe!

The first "thyme" I made it I may have used the wrong setting on my bread machine due to its being the first time I used a machine. It came out very dry before I baked it. I have now made it a second time. The dough was a bit better but it was very small and did not even come close to filling the loaf pan.
