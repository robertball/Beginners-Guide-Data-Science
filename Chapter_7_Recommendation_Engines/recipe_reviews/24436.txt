Great basic recipe! I added a tablespoon of cinnamon sugar, and these tasted just like scottish shortbread! Great taste, slightly sweet/salty flavor!
Thanks for a great recipe Sandi!


Have to add that all 30 I made (halved the recipe) are gone!

This recipe is wonderful....I just loved the texture and taste of these cookies they are wonderful with tea/coffee. (And Yes of course cold milk too!)  This recipe was a great one because it was one of the only sugar cookie recipes that I could find with out cream of tartar.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I was pretty worried when I saw the lumps in the oven that were just cooking in their own butter and didn't seem to be getting any more cooked! But when I took them out and let them sit for a couple of minutes, they turned a wonderful golden color. They've also got a very simple taste - a nice, light buttery one. Still, very nice!

By the way - you don't need to worry about spacing on the cookie sheet, these don't really expand.

Thank you  for this recipe. My mom made these for me when I was a little girl. She wasn't much of a cook or baker but she did a good job on these. She is now 94 and is not feeling well. I asked her if she remembered the cookies and she said yes. So I figured I would check with all recipes and see if anyone had the recipe. I want to thank you again. I will make them for her and this will bring back lots of memories

Simple, fast.. as others say, a shortbread taste almost.  (I added that hint of ginger myself, thanks) Wonderful warm fresh sugar cookie to go with milk, perfect for a feel good treat!

This is a very easy, quick recipe! It's a good tasting cookie that isn't crumby. I made a batch for my daughter's class and put red, white and blue sprinkles on top to celebrate Flag Day.

Keep in mind this is a simlpe cookie- not many ingredients, nothing fancy. It tastes almost like a shortbread, and works well when there isn't much in the cupboard to make cookies with. They taste great with a cold glass of milk- Sandi

I put in double the amount of vanilla, make a thumb print into the middle of each cookie, fill with jam or Nutella (a hazelnut spread) and  seal the top with a little dough.  Caution...make sure cookie is completely cooled down before biting into.  This basic recipe is so versatile that it is good as a stand alone recipe or can be tweaked to taste!!!  Excellent!!!

These cookies are okay, not wonderful. I added a little bit more sugar than what it called for and also added some nutmeg to give them more flavor.

This is a pretty average sugar cookie recipe. The cookies are pretty soft out of the oven, but get fairly flaky and crispy after they cool completely. My 20 month old son loved them- they didn't fall apart when he munched on them. Not quite what I was looking for, but not bad. Easy for a quick snack.

Easy and fast and a good opportunity to use that butter-flavor crisco.  Pretty much like a shortbread.  For my own touch, I added a pinch of ginger.

it seemed like something was missing.  They tasted like sweet bisquits.  Maybe I did something wrong?

These cookies were pretty good---maybe not very sweet.  It's been a long time since I've made anything with shortening, and I'm not used to that aftertaste that comes with it.  I appreciate that your family loves this tradition.  What can be better than that?
