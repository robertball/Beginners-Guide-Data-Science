My husband and I liked this very much.  My kids thought it was interesting.....very interesting!  (Which pretty much means they didn't like it!)  I would double the sauce however.....it was so good!  Also needs salt and pepper!

Extremely quick, easy and very tasty.  The balsamic vinegar was by no means overwhelming and I used seed dijon for added texture.  I will try this recipe again with a cream base (heavy cream so it doesn't curdle with the vinegar).  A definite repeat.

I thought this was pretty good and definately easy.  I liked the way the onions tasted with the chicken.  Next time I may cut back a smidge on the basalmic vinegar - I'm not a huge fan.
