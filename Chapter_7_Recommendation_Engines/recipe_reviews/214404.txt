Before you write this one off due to purists rating a non-traditional recipe or run to the store to buy a bottle of Galliano (the correct name of the liquer the other reviewers didn't know), give it a shot with the hazelnut. Galliano is expensive and has limited uses.

I tried the hazelnut, sos so,i love the old school way, drop the hazelnut and use Galeano liqueur! Way better! And what is one and a quarter shot, do one or two, that is ridiculous!

Why mess around with perfection?  Use Galeano wine on top and be sure to serve with a straw or your first drink will be pure Galeano.

I really enjoyed this version.  I like the flavor that hazelnut adds to it.

THE RECEPIT CALLS FOR HAZELNUT WHICH SOME OF THE REVIEWS SAY SHOULD BE GALIANO. I HAVE A BOTTLE OF FRANGELICA WHICH IS ALSO A HAZELNUT. I PLAN ON TRYING THAT.

These are great for Sunday football! :) I have to agree with other reviews, I have always used Galliano. I wouldn't buy hazelnut only because I don't like it and wouldn't use it for anything else.
