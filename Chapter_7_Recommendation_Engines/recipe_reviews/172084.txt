This was absolutely fabulous.  I followed others recommendations and added 1 tsp. of instant coffee, 1 tsp. of vanilla and dusted the nuts with flour.  For my own personal taste I used (4) squares of semi-sweet chocolate and (2) squares of bittersweet. It was dark, rich and decadent.  I also served it with fresh sweetened whipped cream.  Will be making it with pecans today, may try it with macadamia nuts too.

Even better the second day, if that is possible, deep rich chocolate flavor, so easy to prepare!  I used chopped pecans coated with flour so they would not sink, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1 tsp instant coffee, I only had unsweetened chocolate squares, so just added granulated sugar to taste while cooling - this is a keeper!  I made 2 and froze one for later - but that may be very soon!

I didn't think this was that great.  I made 2 of them and neither turned out that well.  The center took a long time to cook, much longer than 35 min. and the edges were a little hard.

Super yummy :)  Added instant coffee and vanilla and topped each serving with fresh whipped cream.  It's very rich and chocolatey.  Will definitely make a again.

I made this for dinner with friends and was very dissapointed.  Too much butter and not enough chocolate taste.

I couldn't believe how easy - and so delicious.  I left out walnuts due to a nut allergy.  Added vanilla ice cream on top and it was a huge hit for Thanksgiving!!

I can’t use the nuts because my daughter is deathly allergic to every kind of nut & tree nut. That also means I have to make my chocolate from scratch starting with unsweetened cocoa powder. I use the chocolate substitution chart. I get my butter started first. Then add in the corn syrup. While the butter is melting, I calculate the chocolate powder by tablespoon spoon & sugar then add that to melted butter & corn syrup stirring constantly. I don’t wait for the chocolate to cool to add the eggs. In my experience, if I wait for it to cool, it won’t bake smooth & makes bubbles that make pocs all over the top. It still tastes great but doesn’t look so pretty. Once I get the eggs mixed in, I transfer it to the pie shell & bake. I’ve never finished baking one in 30 minutes. It usually takes an hour to bake. (That could be for my altitude though) Once done, I let it sit until we’re done eating & serve it with vanilla ice cream. Perfect balance & super delicious

I have to make everything for this dessert from scratch. I make the crust & instead of using pre-made chocolate bars, I convert with cocoa powder. We have a family member deathly allergic to any kind of nuts & tree nuts. Most chocolate is processed around nuts. Instead of corn syrup, I mix half a cup of water & half a cup of sugar & pour a half cup out & put that in over the 2 sticks of butter. To get 6 oz of semi sweet chocolate it's 6 tablespoons of cocoa powder to 7 tablespoons of sugar. Then I pour the powder over the sugar water & butter. I wait until the butter is mostly melted then pour the cocoa powder in & start stirring until melted & smooth - about 5 minutes. From there, I pour the chocolate into the crust & in the oven it goes. (30 ish minutes) I get requests for this pie ALL the time!! It's rich & I recommend milk or ice cream to wash it down. It's better than any brownie you've ever had. It's delicious.

Delicious rich chocolate pie.  I added the vanilla as others recommended but not the coffee.  Also I made it with a traditional crust.

Very good--had the consistency of a brownie, which I wasn't expecting but loved nonetheless.

Have been making this type of mud pie since I was a teenager. I double the recipe to make two pies, but use half the butter. Also, added vanilla and some unsweetened chocolate like the others suggested. Also, we are gluten free, so I put it in a nut crust. Yummy!

I was looking for a chocolate pie similar to what my step mother used to bake and this is so close to her pie.  I did add the coffee as other suggested and I loved the taste.  Really good pie.
