Delicious!  I made this for dinner for my family who loved it, and then I ate the leftovers for lunch 4 of the next 5 days!  I guess you could say I enjoyed it.  I think I actually used the Montreal steak seasoning instead of chicken 'cause I didn't have the chicken kind and it turned out fine.

Really, really excellent taste!- I let it marinade for about 6 hours.  The flavor of the chicken is as good as any grilled chicken sandwich in a restaurant!  Served on buns with provolone cheese, mayo, tomato, and lettuce.  Definitely a winner!  Fiance thinks so, too.

Followed the recipe as written and was pleasantly surprised.  I marinaded the chicken for 3 hours.  Very versatile marinade that would be great with the chicken on a salad.  This is a keeper.

This is a great marinade recipe.  I will definitely use it again.  I followed the recipe as written.  My kids ate them but I think they weren't sure about the pita bread.  UPDATE:  I did this again using both tortillas and sandwich rolls and it was wonderful!  I will use this marinade recipe frequently for cooking all types of chicken dishes.

I also only had the Monetray Steak seasoning but it worked just fine.  My family loved this recipe.  The chicken was very tasty!
