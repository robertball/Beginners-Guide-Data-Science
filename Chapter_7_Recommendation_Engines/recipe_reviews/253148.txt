I added 3 egg whites and made it with 3/4 cup cottage cheese, helped to reduce the extra moisture from the cheese.  I also added chopped spinach and it was delicious.  Will definitely make this again.  If you're following weight watchers, it's  1 point per muffin.

Excellent base recipe to tweak as desired. I followed the amounts, temp and time, and they came out great. I used regular cottage cheese (not lactaid) and about a half cup of shredded cheddar and omitted the canned chilies. I also added about a tablespoon of Dijon mustard and just a little maple bacon seasoning. The flavor and texture was very good. My 16 year old son also liked them.

My family really enjoys these.  One suggestion though, when measuring the cottage cheese, I use a large slotted spoon and kind of squeeze the liquid from the cottage cheese and place in the measure cup and then use the back of that spoon to squeeze a bit more out.  You can then add more cottage cheese to the measure cup and do the same thing.  It leaves you with a firmer egg muffin.  Add any vegetables and seasoning  your family likes.  I avoid adding cheese unless I am 100% certain that it is lactose free.  This is a nice recipe to take to gatherings and be able to say it is both lactose and gluten free.

Quick nutritional breakfast when the mornings are crazy! I didn't have bell peppers so I used Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilies. I drained it will.

Great recipe on it's own as well as one you can play with. Add your own favorite omelette ingredients & garnish countless ways. A tiny pinch of dried dill & a few grinds of nutmeg were among a few of my flourishes. I can make this 100 times & never get bored with the possibilities!

Low fat, low carb, convenient protein  breakfast muffin.  I  didn't have the green chilies so substituted 5 slices of jalapeno and 3 Pepperoncini  diced. Gave it a bit of a bite but I liked it and surprisingly so did my BF.

used 5 eggs, teaspoon yellow mustard, dash of thyme, paprika and a few dashes of hot sauce.  Substituted chiles with green peppers.  Also fried some ground breakfast sausage and onions.  Placed on bottom of tins with cheddar cheese and then filled tin 3/4.

I used 12 eggs, 3/4 c regular cottage cheese, 1 c grated cheddar and chopped saut√©ed leeks along with the scallions and red peppers. I greased (butter and olive oil mixture) the  muffin pans but they still stuck pretty badly. this resulted in 24 small "muffins". They were ok but not flavorful enough.  Net time I will try with stronger cheese, like feta or maybe add ham.

Perfect as written and what made them even better is that they were lactose free. I could eat and enjoy without being worried about any side affects. I took the advice of the recipe submitter and made sure to squeeze out the extra liquid and they came out the perfect firmness. I took the leftovers to work today and they reheat nicely too so that is always a bonus.  Thanks for the great recipe Baking Nana!
