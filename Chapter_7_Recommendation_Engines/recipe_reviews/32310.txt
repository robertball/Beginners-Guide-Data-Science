I am typically only a wine drinker, but ever since my first Chocolate Martini some years ago I have made it part of my Friday night tradition!  Best made with Van Gogh Dutch Chocolate Vodka and Amsterdam Chocolate Liqueur, which is clear.  Throw your martini glass in the freezer till good and frosty, squirt a decorative design of Hershey's syrup inside (or chocolate ganache if you're ambitious) and shake that martini mix till it's good and frosty cold.  Ahhh, absolute Friday night bliss!

I LOVE chocolate martinis!! want to make your chocolate martini more sinful?  use 3 oz chocolate vodka (I use 3 olive chocolate vodka because its more of a dark chocolate than Van Gogh chocolate vodka, but theyre both good)!

I dipped the rim of my martini glasses in melted chocolate, like you would a margarita glass in salt. I just melted some semi-sweet chocolate in saucer and dipped the rim of the glass then chilled. Looked very elegant and tasted wonderful but keep a napkin handy!

OMG! These were positively heavenly! I wanted to copy MISSMISSYMAK & rim my glasses w/ chocolate but didn't want the mess so I put my martini glasses in the freezer to chill & then rimmed them w/ Magic Shell ice cream topping. Worked like a charm! I topped the martinis w/ a tiny dollop (about 1/2 tsp.) of whipped cream & then garnished w/ chocolate shavings. It was the most beautiful drink I had ever seen...& it tasted just as good!

This is my drink of choice when in downtown Mpls...although I have NEVER had a chocolate martini near as good as the ones served at the Rio hotel in Vegas (made with Godiva chocolate liqueur), this is a VERY close second!  MMMMM good - even for people who generally dislike martinis!  Thanks, Lauren!

Oh my gosh.. its not often i've had a seriously terrible drink.. but this one is just that in my honest opinion. I'm not a huge fan of martini's anyways, but i figured a chocolate one might be decadent and delicious...all you could taste was strong liquor- almost overpowering. i used vanilla vodka for extra flavoring, choc syrup lined in the glass and a shot of half and half per suggestion of other reviewers, thinking this would calm down the heavy liquor taste. no way. I won't be making, or experimenting with this recipe again.

This was amazing. Potent, but amazing.

With the second one, I added a bit of 
half-n-half and it tasted like a Milky Way. 

My evenings already getting better. ;)

I tried something different.  Instead of just plain vodka I used Vanilla vodka.  I also used chocolate syrup to line the martini glass, and a marchino cherry for a nice surprise at the bottom.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was dipping the edge of my pretty martini glass in powdered sugar - it looked pretty and gave a slightly sweet taste at first that wasn't overwhelming.  My friends all loved it!

Yum!!! Restaurant quality martini for sure! I used two oz of vanilla vodka instead of three oz of reg vodka, I added two oz of skim milk and swirled chocolate sauce in the martini glass. Topped with a little whipped cream, it was delicious!

This is a classic, simple chocolate martini. I used Van Gogh chocolate vodka and Godiva white chocolate liqueur. Very sublime and goes down easy. Drizzle some chocolate syrup in the glass first as it makes a very pretty presentation. The grated chocolate garnish was a nice finish.

I usually order this when I go to the Outback for dinner. It's nice to know I can make it anytime I want now. The only thing I do differently is I use Godiva chocolate liquer and I add a shot of half-and-half. That makes it just like the Outback's.

Gave this four stars, since I added my own flair -- 1 fluid oz. butterscotch schnapps, 1 tsp. chocolate syrup, a little more vodka & garnish also with 1 slice banana & maraschino cherry.  Watch out for this one!

I did not like this at all. I am not a big alcohol drinker, but I thought the chocolate would taste good. It was awful. TOO strong. So to dull it down I cut the alcohol down considerably and then added about a  half a cup of milk. Then it was good.

If you weren’t in an amorous mood before this drink, you will be soon after.  It is strong but very delicous.  It is an excellent martini.

For my liking i found it way tooo strong(I'm not much of a drinker)  once i added some milk to it it was much better.  I could also be that i may have put much of the vodka and the liquer as i didn't have an oz. glass so i eye balled it.

This was great. I used vanilla vodka. I also added 1 ounce of half and half for an added creamy texture. I swirled chocolate syrup in the glass and added one Hershey's kiss to the bottom of the glass.

It's a good start... but once using vanilla vodka and the last few drops of some Baileys I had, it was magnificent to say the least! Without the Baileys, a dash of cream helped too.

My doesn't like martinis, but this one has her hooked. The key is to use high quality vodka, cheap vodka's are nasty and burn. Also make sure it is cold.  We have also made it using vanilla vodka and hear a touch of peppermint is also good, will try that next.
