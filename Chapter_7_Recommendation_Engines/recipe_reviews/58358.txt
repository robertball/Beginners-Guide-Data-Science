This was pretty good.  I used lemon pepper fillets because that was all that was available.  Also used asparagus instead of carrots.  Turned out well, and my wife liked it too.

This was delicious! My husband and kids loved it. I bought the char-grilled fillets by mistake, but they tasted fine in the recipe. Will definitely be making this again. I'm always looking for fish recipes that my children will eat.

I used frozen peas instead of the mixed vegies and another brand of alfredo sauce. It was quick and tasty.  I would probably add another box of the fish because the pasta and sauce really makes 4-5 servings, esp. with a salad or garlic bread.
