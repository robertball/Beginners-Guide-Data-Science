YUM, so great!!! One note: about HALF the oil is plenty. For ease of preparation, I got a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the deli counter instead of the chicken breasts - way faster and easier, and the meat is really flavorful.  Just take it off the bones, give it a rough chop and you're done.  My no-nonsense, meat&potatoes husband requested a big batch of soup to take camping!  Nice and sniffle-inducing spicy; adjust the cayenne or serve with a big spoonful of sour cream for the faint of heart. I've already sent the recipe to four people; my family loves it, and so do my husband's camping buddies.  This will go into heavy rotation for us! Garnish with any combo of: crunchy  tortilla strips (save a few tortillas to make some fresh-sprinkle lightly with onion powder); some remaining cilantro; sour cream, shredded cheese; avocado; and whatever you do, don't skip a squeeze of fresh lime!

This soup is great! Everybody loves it.  I did two things differently -- first, I cooked the chicken with the spices in the first step of the recipe so the chicken meat would absorb the flavors.  Secondly, I was out of corn tortillas so I used tortilla chips that I just crumbled in the bottom of the bowl before adding the soup. (I felt that the tortillas added at the beginning got too mushy).

The flavor is pretty good.  The appearance is mushy garbage.  It has so much oil it collects at the top in a thick layer.  It hardly looks edible, but it is.  I will however attempt this recipe again with a few changes.  1) Fry the tortilla strips drain and set aside.  2) Saute onions and cilantro in 2-3T (not 6T) of oil.  Drain and return to pot.  Do whatever you can to reduce the oil. 3) Follow rest of recipe. 4) Garnish with fried tortilla strips and maybe a mexican cheese such as Queso Quesadilla.

Absolutely incredible.  I would decresase the oil to 4 tbl spoons next time.  I added 2 cans of diced corn and 2 cans of rinsed black beans.  We topped it with sourcream, cheese and green onions.  This will become a staple soup at our house...

This is a fantastic soup that allows room to experiment. I followed the recipe but, made a few changes..... Started with a CHILI infused OIL.................I did keep the TORTILLAS in the soup from the beginning (doing so seemed to keep soup thick) and added a few crunchy chips in the end for texture.......Used (1) jar SALSA and (1) can tomatoes that added up to the 29 oz. required.....Also, added 1/2 cup CREAM in the end before serving. Overall, this is a great recipe I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I felt something was MISSING. I can't say exactly what. If anyone has any suggestions I hope they post it. I used all the same garnishes as suggested. However, it seems a key spice is perhaps lacking. Though, I have to say DON'T LET THIS ONE PASS YOU BY...

Trey, this is a fabulous recipe.  I used about one and half pounds of boneless chicken breasts that I sprinkled with Spicy Mrs. Dash and cookd for 5 minutes in my George Forman grill.  I let it cool while I made the rest of the soup and then cut it up into bite sized pieces!  My son makes it all the time now and loves it!  In fact, I have made it for many a guest and this recipe is truly a HIT!!! I did make sure that I used really fresh cumin (not one that had been sitting on my spice shelf for years) and I think that made a big difference.  I love the flavor of the corn tortillas that cook with the soup and I really don't care that they are NOT crispy.  One can add the tortilla strips when serving it along with the addition of some ripe avocado and extra chopped cilantro.  It really is better the next day.  Thanks again!  Amy Pla

Very, very simple and excellent for a cool autumn day. I substituted one cup of whole milk for one cup of chicken stock and it was a creamy, zesty success. Don't forget the shredded cheddar on top! UPDATE 10/13/09 - made a great batch substituting leftover Slow Cooker Carnitas for the chicken. So versatile and great for cool weather warm-up!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I added half a can of black beans, half a can of corn, and used Rotel for the tomatoes.

This was a good start. I used  a 29 oz can of Rotel because I like spicy (but did omit the cayenne pepper). I sauteed the onion and a little bell pepper in oil with garlic & cumin and added this to the chicken broth & tomatoes. I used a rotisserie chicken (honey mesquite) and just chopped it up and put it in the liquid broth. I also added a can of black beans & a can of corn. I did not add the tortilla strips until the last 30 minutes so they would not be as mushy. I served it with shredded cheese and avocado. It was healthy and had wonderful flavor!!!

Wonderful! I also added some chopped celery and a couple of jalapenos cut in rings (fresh and w/o seeds).It was not too spicy. Served with grated cheese on toasted torilla strips and a dolup of sour cream. 
This is definately going to be one of my favorites!

Not a bad recipe.  I was looking for an alternative to a tortilla soup mix that is no longer on the market and this was pretty close.  The only real change I made was not cooking the tortillas with the soup, but frying them until crispy and using them as a topping.  I did find it a bit thin so next time I will use a bit of cornstarch to make it thinker.

I'm from Texas currently living in Washington & I love Mexican food.  Believe me, I know good Mexican food when I taste it.  This recipe is a good jumping off point with a few adjustments.  Anyone that knows anything about tortilla soup, knows the best way to eat this is not to put the tortillas into the soup.  It makes them 'soggy' and disquesting.  I fixed the recipe true to guidelines, other than that.  Tortilla soup base is best with chicken broth, not so many tomatoes; I'd eliminate them altogether and use chicken broth/bullion instead.  Then when the soup is done, put some fresh cilantro in the soup...so much better than cooking it in.  On top I put chopped fresh tomatoes, some fresh onions, green or  red (whatever you got) and while the soup has been cooking, cut some uncooked corn tortillas into thin strips and fry them up.  Tortilla soup is great with avacados either sliced or cubed on top and a spoonful of sour cream on top. Squeeze some lime in for more flavor.  The tortilla strips are put on the top right before eating, making them crunchy and heavenly.  Hope this helps. I give this 4 stars due to all the adjustments I had to make and due to the base not being true chicken base.  Best of luck.

Absolutely delish!!  I used a warm rotisserie chicken and also threw in a can of sweet corn.  I broke up tortilla corn chips in the soup bowl when serving and put a small dollop of sour cream in the bowl. Wow! Amazing flavor. I made a big pot of it and froze the rest for another meal. Thank you!!

Boyfriend was not as fond of this, but my 7 year old was, and she is a picky eater. I will definitely make this again and maybe add some more cumin and chili powder to satisfy bf's taste buds.

This is a great recipe.  I cook the cut into bite sized chicken (I use boneless, skinless thighs) in the pan with garlic, season salt and pepper. Then I add my onions and sauté them with the chicken.  I add all of the other ingredients and heat through.  I like to add two cans of black beans that have been rinsed as someone else suggested and I don’t add tortillas.  I then serve the soup with tortilla chips that you crunch into the bottom of your bowl and top with shredded cheese and sour cream, if you want.  It is a very healthy recipe without those additions but they are good!  This is wonderful.  Play with it and enjoy!

i made this recipe almost exactly. i didn't add the cilantro until the end, because i was unfamiliar with frying it that way and didn't want to ruin anything. also, i added a half of a can of corn at the end as well. this was really great, my husband ate a whole bowl which is a compliment with any soup. the tortillas are meant to thicken the soup, you should simmer it until they dissolve. extremely delicious!

Just made this and everyone loved it!!!! It was better than some restaurants.   The only changes I made were: cut down the vegetable oil to 3 tablespoons, 1/2 tablespoon of chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon of ground bay leave instead of the actual leaves.   I will make this soups again and again!!!! AMAZING!! Thank you!

I have made this soup many times in the past couple of years and every time I get asked for the recipe. I prepared the soup the night before and let it cook all day the following day till that evening when it was served. I have to say that the best result was when I let the soup stew in a crock pot on low for about 4 - 6 hours while I was at work. I took the soup to a party afterwards and the flavor was much more pronounced and delicious! I topped with shredded Sharp Cheddar cheese, sour cream, and garnished with tortilla chips and a pinch of chives. I believe that is the trick to this recipe and the texture other reviewers spoke about. The longer you let it cook the better the turn out.

Excellent! This soup filled my house with the aroma of authentic Mexican cuisine. My father, raised on my grandmother's homemade Mexican food, loved this. Asked for more.  

The taste is rich and spicy. Not hot at all. I substituted a little less olive oil for regular cooking oil. I minced the onion and added a little fresh lime juice for tanginess.  I must have stirred the tortillas too much because they came out a little mushy. I will add the tortillas at the end next time. Can't wait until the rest of my Mexican family tastes this. They will wonder where I learned to cook! Thanks.

I'm not sure how the ORIGINAL recipe tastes, but with the modifications I made, this soup was pretty dang good. This is what I did differently: ADDED 1 stalk of celery, 1 (8 oz.) can tomato sauce, and 1 can corn. SUBSTITUTED 1 (4 oz.) can jalapenos for cayenne (because I had forgotten that I ran out of cayenne). REDUCED oil from 6 tablespoons to 2 tablespoons, tortillas from 6 to 3 (you need it to thicken the soup), cumin (from 2 tablespoons to 1 tablespoon), and chili powder from 1 tablespoon to 1.5 teaspoons. GARNISHED with crispy tortilla strips and sour cream. I also kept the soup boiling (stirring frequently to avoid burning) for the 30 minutes it was supposed to be simmering to cook out some of the liquid. Next time I make it, I will either use fresh jalapenos or a teaspoon of pepper flakes, add the cilantro with the chicken, the whole tablespoon of chili powder, and I won't forget the lime. I love lime...

I've been looking for a tortilla soup recipe where the tortillas are cooked right into the soup instead of just used as a garnish at the end.  This was it.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts and cooked them in the soup instead of adding cooked chicken at the end.  I tossed in a packet of Sazon just for the heck of it and this soup came out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

The next day the cumin was overwhelming.  Pretty spicy, but I like spicy!  Took others' advice by toasting the tortillas first.  Sounded like they'd get way too soggy.

The soup had great flavor, I did add a Tbl. of chicken base (boullion).  I would add less tortilla's and chicken, the soup was very thick, stew like. The tortilla's became too mushy for my taste, I'd saute my tortilla's and add them maybe 15 minutes before the soup was done next time.

Delicious! I added a can of corn and black beans. It really added to the soup. The seasoning really made a great soup.

THIS is the tortilla soup recipe I've been looking for! Fresh, simple flavors and hearty to boot! I like to let it cook a little longer so the tortillas "melt" completely into the soup and thicken it up. Gives it great flavor. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Update: have made this several times now and two things I will definitely do from now is is 1.) add a can of black beans, and 2.) use San Marzano crushed tomatoes instead of just diced. I still LOVE this soup!!

Best tortilla soup I've ever had! It was very easy to put together. I like things spicy so I added a small can of green chiles and doubled the cayenne and it was amazing! With the salted chicken broth I didn't need to add the extra salt. I'd taste it before you add. I garnished with a little sour cream and fresh cilantro. Great soup!

I loved this recipe but I did also take the advice of others and I added a can of corn and a can of black beans. I felt like it needed more. The tortillas do get really soggy if you add them at the beginning so I also added some crispy tortillas before serving to the top. I didn't feel it had enought salt either so added more to taste. Taste was very good, not too spicy either. Will make again with my variations for sure.

Our new favorite!  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly except that we added the tortillas at the end because we like them crunchy.  We ran out of tortillas ~ so for the left overs we used tortilla chips, which actually tasted better than the ones I made, so I don't fuss with that anymore!  I also skip the cayenne and let each person stir in red pepper flakes to their bowl if they want to add heat.  To serve we crush a handful of chips and then add cubed mexican cheese or montery jack cheese and a few slices of avacado, a scoop of soup then top with sour cream!  THE BEST!  YUM! It is just like we had at a nice resturant in Mexico!

This was flavorful and delicious! I only made a few minor additions/changes. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of just diced tomatoes. I also cut up a rotisserie chicken and added that to the soup and then simmered it for 30 minutes. I also added some garlic powder to this for more flavor. I didn't saute corn tortillas at the beginning because I like serving them at the end with tortilla chips and for people to add as much as they please. Great recipe and a keeper!

A great recipe- that can actually be made better!  I added a can of chopped green chilies and used a cup and a half of salsa instead of tomatoes- way more flavor!  Also- I cut the oil down as did many others.  The best way to thicken this is to add a can of cream soup- whatever flavor you like- and then use a hand blender to blend everything together before you add the chicken.  The corn tortillas will puree and make the soup have the perfect consistency!  Don't forget to remove bay leaves prior to blending.  And be sure to top with monterey jack cheese, crunchy tortilla strips, sour cream and a sqeeze of fresh lime!

This is a great recipe! I made some changes though. I added chiles, sliced water chestnuts and a few diced green peppers. I omitted the cheyenne pepper because I didn't have any. I also cooked this in the crockpot for about 2 hours. I cut strips of soft tortilla shells and added some to the soup to thicken. I did continue to cut strips of soft tortilla shells and bake them at 300 to add later on if wanted. I too added a shredded mexican cheese blend during and after cooking. I'll be keeping this recipe handy. Thanks!

I thought this was great. I did make a couple changes. Cut the chicken broth down to 5 cups. I also added 2 fresh jalapenos to the onion/garlic/tortilla mixture, and cooked that a lot longer, until soft - then pureed it before adding the tomatoes. Got rave reviews! :)

I have been using Ro-tel's new diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro in place of plain tomatoes. It gives the soup a really great KICK. I have also been omitting the cayenne pepper in this variation.

This recipe is the closest to mine I've found.  What makes this soup taste truly authentic is to fry the tortilla strips slightly before adding to the soup.  It adds not only a special flavor but when the soup is simmered for 30 to 45 min. it acts as a thickener too.  ALWAYS great the next day.  In a pinch I have used Restaurant Style Tortilla Chips, but the flavor is still not quite the same as when using fried strips.  I even make extra for those that like to add more or use for munching with the soup.

This soup was delicious, and so quick and simple to make.  I did make some adjustments:  Only used two tortillas chopped and sauted with the onions, etc and baked the rest to put on top of soup when serving.  I also added a cup of frozen corn. I also decreased amount of chicken to two large breasts.  Five would have been too much meat for our tastes. My husband loved it.  THis will become a regular for us.

I ran a trial of this for my Cinco de Mayo party and it was wonderful!  The broth is delicious, not a kids dish, it's got some kick to it!  I sauted my chicken tenders in Pensky's chicken taco seasoning first, a goovy blend of Mexican spices.  It occured to me as I was sauteing the corn tortillas, I bet a couple of handfuls of Fritos would be just as good.  I also added some chipotle, and extra low sodium broth.  The addition of corn and rinsed black beans would make this a fabulous chicken chili.  Great dish, Trey!

Let me start by saying...I know people get upset when recipes are rated based on changes that were made and not the recipe as it is written, but I the changes I made do not take away from the heart of this recipe. 

With that said, this recipe is fabulous!  I used a few of other reviewers suggestions to tailor this to my spicy, veggie-loving taste buds. Here is what I changed:
1. I use less oil. I don't actually measure it, but it's not more than 2 Tbsp and that's plenty. 
2. I only use 6 tortillas in an attempt to cut a few calories and because there were quite a few negative comments about the tortillas being mushy. I have not had that problem...I think they thicken the soup nicely. 
3. I use 1 can (14.5 oz) of diced tomatoes and 1 1/2 cans (14.5 oz) of diced tomatoes with green chiles.....deliciously spicy, if that's what you're into! (The other half can of "Rotel" is used to make guacamole...mmmmmm!)
4. I add a few carrots to simmer for about an hour.  
5. 20 minutes before we're ready to eat, I add some frozen corn (I don't measure it, but probably about 1 cup) and 1 can of drained and rinsed black beans. 

My husband raves about this soup and we absolutely love that there are always tons of leftovers! I squeeze a little lime juice over my soup just before I eat it, and my husband enjoys a handful of extra sharp cheddar cheese on his. 

I used http://www.food.com/recipe/my-famous-shredded-chicken-205760 for my chicken and it is deliciously tender!

This is fantastic!  A few things I did different: did not get to use the tortillas in the beginning of recipe, and I used dry cilantro instead of fresh because that is all I had.  I put in the crockpot for 8 hours on low and and threw in some cooked rice in the last 30 minutes.  I did throw in some lime juice at the end over the soup, about 1 tablespoon.  I really think this brightened it up. Even added a little extra on each bowl. Topped with cheese, crushed chips and sour cream.  This was hands down the best soup recipe I have made.  The flavor was tremendous after cooking for at least 8 hours in the slow cooker.  The next day was even better, it reminded me of Qdoba's Mexican Gumbo with the added rice.  If I do not use rice the next time, I will make sure I use the corn tortillas in the beginning of the recipe.  From reading multiple reviews, the corn tortillas act as a thickening agent.  But, the rice was fantastic so that is how I will most likely make this from here out :)

Ok I didn't have cilantro, I know, bad bad bad.  But even without it, this was sooooo yummy!  We all loved it.  And I agree you don't need that much oil.  I used olive oil and just enough to cover the bottom of the pan.  I cooked up fresh tortilla strips to top it with at the end and also added a small can of drained black beans and some leftover rice I had here.  It was a FULL meal and I will def make again!!!!

Yummy! So easy to make, but very satisfying!
I doubled the recipe and added 2 small cans of hominy. I also used crushed tomatoes and 2 cans of rotel with peppers and cilantro, and 1 hot pepper (not sure what kind). Was awesome, but could definitely use more heat to taste, and more hominy. I will double the amount of hominy next time. Sliced radishes, green onions, olives, cheese,  tortillas, and limes were used as garnish. :)

Just a few changes....
* Before starting the soup, I cut some fresh corn tortillas into strips, fried them, and set aside.
* Added a diced quarter of a chile serano to the garlic / onion / cilantro mix.
* Instead of the canned tomatoes, I used diced yellow pear (cherry) tomatoes from the over-producing plant in my garden.
* Instead of the chili powder, I used  "Tajin" salsa en polvo from my local Mexican market.
* As for chicken, I used some "leftover" breast meat from a beer-butt chicken (look for the recipe -- really good) that I had previously bbq'ed. 
* At serving time, I cut in a fresh avocado, and crumbled in the fried tortilla chips I had prepared earlier.

Good base tortilla soup. I didn't add the corn tortillas in the beginning because I prefer a clear tortilla soup but I otherwise followed the recipe. I used grilled and shredded chicken breast that was seasoned by my butcher, which added some heat. For the tomatoes, I opted for the rotel w/chilies. After the soup was finished and I gave the recipe my rating, I knew I could make this good soup great, and added corn, black beans, chipotle bouillon, tomato/veggie bouillon, and water; and then I cooked it a bit longer. I served it w/shredded white cheese, tortilla chips, and sour cream. Delicious!

I used this for the basis to use up some leftover store-bought rotisserie chicken.  I stripped the chicken meat and diced it up and set aside.   I used the bones/skin from the chicken, added 3.5 cups water, some salt/pepper/1 bay leaf and simmered for ~40 mins to make broth, then strained and discarded the bones/skin.  The next day I made the tortilla soup but omitted the oil and tortillas, and just threw all the rest of the ingredients into a pot with the broth for about 40 minutes.  I also added 1/4 tsp dried oregano.  Then ladled the soup on top of tortilla chips, with a squeeze of fresh lime (a must!).  It was delicious!

I used this recipe for my first tortilla soup and it was excellent! I paired it with cilantro-lime rice and some black beans to mimic Qudoba's mexican gumbo. I have made it twice already and it keeps well in the fridge and is still awesome after being zapped in the microwave. I'm going to stick with this recipe, two thumbs up!

This was really good. I will definitely make it again. Added frozen corn, which was yummy, and fried some strips of corn tortilla to put on top. My whole family really loved it.

We loved it, but want more flavor. I added a can of tomato sauce and added 50% more of each of the spices.

Thoroughly enjoyed..did opt for the 1/2 oil needed and used Olive Oil ( 3 Tbl) and turned out great! Topped with green onions and jalapenos. YUM..took a bit of time but worth it! Will do again

This soup has a lot to offer as far as taste and smell but I did follow other reviews and lessen the amount of oil, added corn and black beans.  I also used ancho chile powder (because that's all I had) and the fresh cilantro made it great!  I did fry some corn tortilla strips because the tortillas in the soup did get very soggy.  Good recipe!

I love chicken tortilla soup and this recipe met all my expectations! I took the suggestions of other reviews and added black beans. I also took so corn tortillas and cut them up and fried them to add a crunch to the soup since the added tortillas added get soggy. Top it off with a dap of sour cream and no other chicken tortilla soup will compare!

Great soup!  I also added a can of corn, 14.5 oz of diced tomatoes with green chilies, and 14.5 oz of diced tomatoes.  My husband and I ate the soup with sour cream, crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheese and fresh avocados. Yummy!!!

I really enjoyed this!  I cut back on the oil and skipped the cilantro (didnt' have any, but I find it kind of strong anyway).  I added 1 can of black beans (rinsed & drained) and 1 can of corn.  I think you need to adjust the chili powder and salt to your personal taste (I added more chili to mine), but what was listed was a good place to start.  Before adding the chicken, beans, and corn I ran my immersion blender through it to combine the tomatoes & tortillas better.  It thickened up really nice.  My family loved it!

Made as written which is what people should do---otherwise its NOT the intended recipe! Read top reviews first, added fresh tomato, frozen chopped cilantro, frozen corn, and leftover shredded roasted chicken....delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very simple and easy to make.  I used fresh tomatoes rather than canned, and added corn and red sweet pepper.  I skipped the veg oil and baked my tortilla pieces.  Used olive oil spray to saute garlic/onions.  I added the tortilla pieces to the bottom of the soup bowl after cooking rather than cooking them in the soup and it turned out fine. garnished with fresh cilantro, some of the tortilla pieces and a dollop of sour cream.

I actually was very disappointed with this recipe. I was expecting something so very spectacular since I had read so many amazing reviews, but I found that it left a lot to be desired. First of all, many people said to decrease the oil. I didn't find that to be true and my soup was NOT oily. Secondly, the recipe says to saute the onion, garlic, and tortillas together for 2 - 3 minutes. Well that certainly was not long enough and because of that the onions were crunchy. I imagine they are supposed to be that way but I didn't care for it at all. It made the soup a bit bitter. Secondly, there were no veggies other than the canned tomatoes and onions which made the soup bland. However, I did add a can of corn which did little for the soup as far as flavor goes. I had to increase the amount of tortillas since I like my soup with more tortillas. Like one reviewer did,I added cream to the mixture since I don't care for brothy types of soups as much as creamy soups. I don't know what all the rave was about. On top of that, since the reviews were so great I doubled the recipe. Now I have double the amount of soup that I am not so crazy about. We did add lime and cheddar cheese on top of our individual servings which added more flavor. All in all I was sorely disappointed. I am going to freeze most of this and maybe I'll enjoy it better at another point in time. Cheese should be made part of the recipe as well as, perhaps, black beans or what one enjoys, to add more dimension to this r

This spicy little number was a big hit with the hubby!!  I did make a couple changes.  I only used 3 tablespoon of canola oil.  I added ½ teaspoon of red pepper flakes to step up the heat.  I did not cook the tortillas in the soup because they would have become a soggy mess.  So I added them to the actual bowl before serving.  I also used my slow cooker to roast a whole chicken so I had fresh stock and moist chicken to add to the soup.  I added a couple drops of lime juice and shredded cheese to serve.

This soup was fabulous. Great recipe. I too did it with a rotisserie chicken. Also added some corn and a can of black beans. For the tomatoes I used one 16 oz can of tomatoes and make then used 1 container of Jacks special salsa. made it great. Took some to a neighbor and she said the best soup she ever had.

Delicious! I added extra cumin, cooked the chicken previously and used the stock from that.  I also used fresh chopped tomatoes.  Tasted just like what I used to eat in Mexico.

YUMMY!  I made this just like the recipe except I replaced the cilantra with Fresh chopped Parsley because no one in my family likes cilantra.  But everyone loved the soup and both daughter and daughter-in-law asked for the recipe.

I only had 3 chicken breasts on hand and that worked out just fine.  I also scaled the cayenne back to 1/4 teaspoon.  (You can always add more, but you can't take it out!)  It was nice and spicy but not too hot.  I will make this again and again!

Wonderful

would skip the tortillas, maybe fry some and add strips at the end.  Added corn for a twist, and a bunch more shakes of the cumin and chili powder.

Best tortilla soup I have ever tasted! (I'm a Texan, so I've tasted a lot.) I add an extra 14.5oz can of petite diced tomatoes, and I use the kind with Mexican spices added for extra kick. Serve with fried tortilla strips, shredded cheddar, and sliced avocado.

I followed this recipe "loosely" because I didn't have a lot of the fresh ingredients on hand.  I used dried cilantro, garlic powder, onion flakes, etc.    I chopped up the tortillas very tiny so that by the time the soup was done, the taste was there, but there wasn't any weird soggy texture.  Also added a can of corn and topped with cheese when serving.

This was the perfect chicken tortilla recipe! While it was cooking, I thought the cumin smelled too overpowering, but it tasted just fine. An extra kick, but not too bad. I didn't cook the corn tortillas into the soup, though. Instead, I fried my own strips out of corn tortillas (sprinkle them with some salt!) and you can drizzle them on top of your bowl of soup. It's a perfect combination. I just didn't want soggy tortillas in mine...

I think this is a good base for tortilla soup rather than a good recipe for tortilla soup.  The soup needed a heartier flavor than what was offered here.  I will try it again and take the advise of others by frying the tortillas a bit first to bring out the corn flavor, possibly add more spices, and cooking a little longer.  My personal taste if for a thicker soup with a richer flavor.

I found this soup to be excellent.  It was as good or better than any I've had in a restaurant.  The only change I made was to use 3 tablespoons oil instead of six.  It didn't change the flavor at all.  I also used reduced sodium chicken broth.  I recommend this soup.

I was disappointed given all the rave reviews.  My tortillas weren't recognizable when finished - they turned to mush.

I just came back from Mexico where I fell in love with tortilla soup.  I searched for recipes and chose this one because it seemed to match up best with the soups I had while I was away.  I was not disappointed!  This soup was delicious and easy to make.  To make it a bit thicker, I put extra tomatoes and a bit less chix broth.  Great recipe, thanks so much!

I made this for a large group of people who all LOVED it! Just the right amount of spice and thickness. This pot was the first to be emptied. Will definately make it again!

I'm a Texan and this if my favorite Tortilla Soup recipe. I always add roasted chicken rather than stewed for more flavor. This one is worth a try!

So good!  I'm lazy so I always use rotisserie chicken In dishes that call for cooked chicken and it works every time.  This soup had all the right flavors even the tortillas in the broth.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Very nice!!!  I boiled the chicken, and used the stock from it.  Shredded the chicken.  I baked the corn tortillas with cooking spray, only use 1 tablespoon of oil to fry the onions, cilantro, and garlic.  Added Chipotle Chili Powder. Didn't add the tortilla until it was ready to be served.  I added a few slices of tortilla bottom of a bowl, with a few slices of avocados, add the soup mix.  Topped with a dash of sour crème.  YUMMY!!!  Took this to Christmas Dinner, and it vanished, no left overs.  :) :) :)

This turned out really well.  I've been wanting to try Tortilla Soup for a while.  I added one can of black beans, drained, to the pot.  Everyone had second and third helpings.

This is a great dish!  I made it as directed and it was great.  The second time, I used a rotisserie chicken and it was even better.  This is a family favorite for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

Don't let the simplicity of this recipe discourage you - it is absolutely incredible. I have never tried the rotisserie method, but hope to soon. I normall boil my chicken, let it cool, then shred it as others have mentioned. Very IMPORTANT, I advise not to add all the oil or the tortillas in the beginning. This will turn your soup mushy and make it way too oily. Fry/bake your tortilla strips separate and add at the end - will be glad you did. All the oil that is needed is a Tbsp or two at the start for the cilantro/onions/garlic - that's it. I also had a can of corn to mine, and kick up the portion of cumin.

This soup was incredible, really amazing. I didn't use the tortillas, but did add basmati rice while it was cooking. Added some Cholula hot sauce to my individual bowl as well as a small dollop of sour cream. So, so good.

Looking for a low fat but flavorful soup so I tried this and was not disappointed. Everyone loved it so much I'll have to double next time.  I had to use crushed tomato (all I had) and cooked the chicken in the garlic and onion along with store bought tortillas (saved time), added a can of black beans and fiesta corn and enjoyed tremendously.  Thanks to Trey for sharing a wonderful recipe.

Very good base recipe. Like others, I used Rotel in place of tomatoes. I pureed warm broth, about 6 sliced corn tortillas and about 3/4 cup of shredded cheese into my vitamix. This made for a very smooth appearance. I topped it off with fresh cilantro and green onions, and headed for a gathering. Every partaker complimented the soup!

I made this soup for my husband and kids and they loved it!  My husband had some of this soup at a local restaurant, and he had been asking me to make it at home every since.  Well I am happy I came across this recipe.  They loved it!  I did add some sweet whole kernel corn and mushrooms to it though!  GREAT RECIPE!

DELICIOUS!! It is a rich, satisfying soup with deep flavor! My husband asked me to add this to our regular soup recipes! I agree with LisaPK71 and RICA. Use A LOT less oil. I added a can of black beans for texture and flavor. For the garnish, I fried strips of left-over tortillas and topped the bowl of soup with a dap of guacamole

Perfect flavor and spice!  We used left over chicken from burritos (w/green enchilada sauce already in it) and sprinkled cheese on top (w/ a dollop of sour cream).  Can't wait to make this for company!

So easy! I made a few changes: used about 3 T of oil instead of 6 (what?!) I made the chicken first using half the spices and sauteed the onions in the same pan first. Then I followed the recipe. I added more chili and some red pepper flakes because I like spice. Also skipped the tortillas at the beginning and just crushed tortilla chips over the soup at the end. So great! Wish I did have raspberry margaritas with it :) On a personal note: I have a sinus infection and this was the first meal I could taste and it cleared my nose up! (check out my photo as well)

I have now made this soup many many times. I add 2 cans corns and 2 cans black beans to it. I leave out the tortilla part and just use a bag of tortillas. This is a great winter soup and my hubby asks for it once a week.

Very good. I cut down on oil to 4 tablespoons when  cooking tortilla strips. They fell apart in soup, but that actually worked out well and thickened up the soup.  I slow boiled 3 chicken breasts in a dutch oven with cumin,chilli pepper, pepper, and little salt. I then saved this water and used as my chicken broth. I skipped bay leaves and added a can of black beans.

Great, easy soup!  Everyone loves it.  I've made it several times exactly as stated but added frozen corn and black beans the last time just to make it go further and to make it a more complete meal.  Adding the corn tortillas at the beginning is a bix part of the texture of the soup and I wouldn't omit this step.  Just add some crunchy ones to each bowl if you like that contrast.  Thanks.

Wonderful soup! I used flour tortillas (only ones I had) but still worked out great, they probably made the soup a little thicker, so next time I'll add more broth! This recipe is great the way it is, but adding beans/corn and other mexican spices would be fun to try! Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out great! I didn't add bay leaves because I had none, still turned out great. Used a can of tomato sauce & added fresh tomatoes. 1 tbsp of cumin. Added extra fresh cilantro. 1 can of chicken broth. I placed uncooked chicken breasts in, & shredded after wards. Threw everything in crock pot on high x3 hrs & turned out great. using fresh cilantro gives it a flavorful taste.  thanks for the recipe!

I boiled a whole organic chicken to make broth, then took it out & shredded the meat.  Also added black beans, chicken bullion, and a little taco seasoning to the recipe.  Substituted crushed corn tortilla chips instead of the tortillas & added them at the end...

There were good things and bad things about this soup. The good: The flavor was amazing! The seasonings all blended together to create a flavorful base. Now for the bad: There were way too many tomatoes for our taste. Next time I'll use a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. Secondly, adding the tortillas at the beginning ended terribly as they became mushy and fell apart. It also just seemed like something was missing...corn, beans, something. I did fry up some corn tortilla strips to add to the top of the soup which kind of saved it for us. Next time I will omit the tortillas at the beginning of the recipe and just fry up strips to top the soup with. I will also add some beans and/or corn. Thank you for a good base recipe though.

So, so good! I've made it twice. The second time I added black beans for extra protien and fiber, but I liked it better without. I cooked the chicken first in the onions and garlic.

I agree with the review who suggested this recipe needs *something* Here is what I did for my first attempt which was well received, although I am going to keep playing with the recipe.  I don't know how much oil I used, but it took more than I expected because the tortillas soak up a bunch.  I fried half the tortillas as the recipe suggested and saved the rest to add at the end. In addition to a 28 oz. can of diced tomatos I added some salsa, a cup at most.  I also added a 25 oz. can of black beans and about a cup of corn (I'll probably double this next time).  I used a roasted chicken from the grocery store (it was cheaper than chicken breast). I also added 1-2 t. of mole, which added some really great flavor.  I cooked the chicken in there for about 15 minutes.  Everything else I did as suggested.  I am very very pleased with the way it turned out and it's going to be a recipe that I'll keep coming back to.

This is a for sure keeper. Instead of regular diced tomatoes, I used rotel. I served it with tortilla strips, avacado, and fresh cilantro.

This dish was delicious, I just put a little less chilli powder. Like other reviewers I found that the tortillas became non-existent because I put them in the beginning. Next time i will add them just 5 minutes before serving

I used this recipe as a base for chicken tortilla soup as I did not have all the ingredients that this recipe called for. I put chicken breasts in a crock pot on high for about 3 hrs. then shredded the chicken before adding vegetable broth (did not have chicken), fresh tomatoes (I did not have any canned) and chili powder.  In the skillet I sauteed garlic, cilantro, onion, and half packet of taco seasoning for a couple minutes. I then added a cup of broth to the skillet, let it simmer for a few minutes and added this to the crock pot and let everything simmer together for about half hour. Before serving I deep fried tortillas cut in strips for 3-4 minutes and garnished soup with the tortillas, moz cheeze, and sliced avocados. Boyfriend loved it and said it was bursting with flavor, I agree, great recipe to follow, even without everything on hand :)

This was a great recipe.  I followed what other people said and only used a small amount of oil (2 tbs) and it turned out great.  The flavor of it was great.  I would defenitely make this again.

I would give this recipe 4 stars! I changed a few things. The first time I prepared it it turned out perfectly.  The only thing I changed was decreasing the amount of chicken broth from 6 cups to 4 1/2 cups.  I would recommend this to any friend or family member.

I took all the advice from others' reviews and it turned out delicious!!  First of all, i only used 2 tbsp. of oil.  I also added a can of corn as well as a can of black beans.  And instead of 6 cups of chicken stock, I used 5 cups of stock and 1 cup of milk.  I love this recipe and look forward to passing it on!

This soup tasted really good. My husband loved it. The only things I did differently was that I omitted the beans and I ended up pureeing about half of it and then mixing it back in. Other than that-it was exactly what we were looking for!

great soup, just what I was looking for. The husband and kids loved it. Made great left overs. The only thing I did not do was add the tortillas in the begining. I used the tortilla strips crushed on top. Also added sour cream avacado & cheese.

Good recipe. Instead of the spices I just used 1 1/2 packages of taco seasoning.  I also used 1 14 oz can of Rotel tomatoes with chiles.  I also used leftover chicken I had from some chicken soup I made.  I saute'd an onion , added tortillas, chicken, taco seasoning, tomatoes, broth.  I added a can of corn and a can of beans to make the soup a little bit thicker.  This is a good base but could be great with some additions.  I would give it 3 without my tweaking. With my tweaking I'd say it's a 5.

I have tried this recipe multiple times and I only changed a few things. First off with food prices being so incredible lately I got chicken thighs on sale for about 3 bucks. I just seared them in the pan and tossed them into the stock with the rest of the ingredients.

I then added a can of black beans and a can of hominy to offset the fact that I didn't have much protein to begin with. I let the whole thing simmer for about 2 hours (to cook the chicken) it shredded nicely and had a delicious soup.

Saw the reviews and had to try it.  So easy and spicy enough to make your nose run.  I added a can of drained whole kernal corn and a can of rinsed black beans to it.  I also browned & salted some sliced up corn tortillas to put on top.  Yummy!!!

I thought this was very good.  I didn't have bay leaves or cayenne, so I had to leave those out.  After looking at the reviews, I decided not to make my own chips and just put in some crushed tortilla chips I had.  As a result, I also eliminated the oil. Also added corn, put in less chicken than it called for, and topped with more tortilla chips for a crunch when served.  This is very filling!  I think there is too much chicken in the recipe; even the amount I put in was too much for me.  I didn't think it was spicy, but that is probably because I left out the cayenne.  I'll make it again with even less chicken.

I have to admitt, when I got everything together in the pot, it didn't look so good.  Appearance was important, because I was planning to serve this soup at my family's restaurant. The only change I made was I added lots of frozen sweet white corn. I finished cooking it, then I garnished it with sour cream, shredded cheddar and fried corn tortilla chips. It was absolutely delicious! Everybody that tasted it loved it! It's my mom's new favorite soup. It tastes like a really good chicken chimichanga with all of the garnish on it, it's a keeper!

This chicken tortilla soup is amazing!!  My cilantro hating friends didn't like it, but I thought it was absolutely amazing.  I made the recipe exactly as directed and it came out perfect.  No changes necessary.  The tortillas melt into the soup and give it a great flavor.

This was excellent.  Whenever I buy a roasted chicken at the grocery store, I make this recipe for dinner the day after.  I take the remaining leftover chicken, follow the recipe, add in some extras like a can of red beans and corn, and also throw in some mozzerella right before serving.  I use regular tortilla chips dropped in right before we eat it and also add sliced avocado.  The whole family loves it.

Very good base for a torilla soup!  You must let the tortillas cook all the way down so that they become part of the broth. you should not even be able to see them.  i added another can of tomatoes, more lime juice, pablano pepper, a jalepeno pepper, and more cumin to give it a kick. serve with melted cheese on top!

This is excellent!  It got rave reviews from my son and husband (even though I accidentally made it with black pepper instead of cayenne pepper).  *blushes*   I didn't mind the "mushy" tortillas.  You can always add extra cut-up tortillas to the soup at the end of cooking.  The "mushy" tortillas make the soup nice and thick.  Instead of canned tomatoes, I used two chopped fresh tomatoes and one can (8-oz.) of tomato sauce.  To make the whole preparation easier, I just used 1 pound of diced, boneless chicken and sauteed that along with the tortillas, etc. at the beginning of the preparation.  This is a nice hearty soup with fairly easy preparation.  I love it!  Don't forget to serve it with a wedge of lime.

Good stuff! I used only 4 tortillas and that was plenty, only used them as topping so they wouldn't be soggy. Left out the cilantro,instead squeezed a lime into the soup just befores serving. I too used 1 can Rotel and 1 can plain tomotoes, this made it just the right spicyness with toppings of sour cream, shredded cheese, sliced green onions and jalapenos. Shredding up the leftovers from a rotisserie chicken saved lots of time!

Splendid! I always add a bit of shredded cheese, and some lime juice for an extra kick. The tortillas do get rather soggy although they still taste fine, but I usually fry or bake them crunchy and top the soup once it's done(or just use tortilla chips if you're rushed). For something different I will sometimes fill the bowl with cooked white rice first and top it with the soup for an extra hearty meal, which also makes great leftovers (if you keep the rice separate until you make it).

This was fabulous. I added a can of niblet corn and a can of black beans and used blue corn tortilla chips instead of frying my own. I also reduced the cayenne pepper to a quarter teaspoon. YUMMY! It did make more than six servings, though I didn't mind it was so good.

This soup is great.  I've been searching for a recipe similar to the one my mom used to make for me when I was little. She added Rotel tomatoes (with Chilies) for an extra spice and before she served it, she would put a chunk of jack cheese in the bottom of the bowl so that it would melt as soon as the soup was poured over it.  She then garnished with broken up tortilla chips (much easier than dealing with the tortillas and they don't turn to mush that way).  Also, the only way to use cilantro is FRESH!!!!  Dried doesn't come close to the real taste of cilantro.  Thanks, Trey, for bringing back the memories of my childhood with this fantastic recipe!

DELICIOUS!  I made a few changes. I used way less oil, did not add the tortillas to the soup, and used a rotisserie chicken as someone else had suggested.  Near the end, I added a can of black beans and a can of Mexicorn.  Garnished with shredded mozzarella (that was all I had), avocado dices, baked tortilla strips and a squeeze of lime. Will make again and again!

I used the basic ingredients of the recipe, but did not add the tortillas as directed----mush happens. I added celery, thinly sliced zucchini, and a little shredded carrot for extra flavor. Corn could be added if desired.
I think it is much better to add tortilla chips as a garnish when serving; if you want to go super-rich, additionally garnish with shredded jack cheese and avocado.

I used a 32 oz. box & a 14 oz. can of chicken broth.  I omitted the cilantro.  I also decreased the cumin, chili powder & cayenne by half.  I figured I could always add more spices if I needed when it was cooking; the amount I used added enough heat for me though.  I also added a can of black beans, drained & rinsed, and 1/2 a cup of frozen corn at the end as well as just a little slivered cooked chicken.  If I made this again, I'd add a cup of corn.  Finally I served it with cheddar cheese & had tortilla chips at the table instead of in the soup.

Great recipe; easy to make. I followed the advice of other reviewers & used less oil. I also added some chili pepper for an added kick. Served with shredded cheese, sour cream & the leftover fresh cilantro, & rounded the meal off with warm French bread. Looking forward to the leftovers...Thanks

This was really very good.  I will make it again, but I will only use half the amount of tomatoes (if any) and my kids thought it was too spicy, so I'll half the cayenne pepper as well.

I have been looking for a Chicken Tortilla Soup recipe for years, and this is awesome.  It's so yummy, and I served it up with jack cheese and fresh fried corn tortilla strips and pigged out.
I have served this as a dip as well and it was a big hit.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE

I just tried this recipe without adding the chicken or corn tortillas and I liked it much better.  I felt that the soup was too thick with the corn tortillas when reheated~ if you do leave out the tortillas and chicken though, I would recommend adding canned (rinsed!) white beans.

I used much less oil and added the juice of 1/2 lime.  Before I added the chicken i gave it 20 seconds with an in pan mixer to get the tortillas ground up.  In each bowl I stirred in some green salsa.  Pretty good !!!

Was perfect! Very flavorful and easy too.  My Boyfriend thought it was from a restaurant. I topped it w/ jack cheese, & avacado, and fried up my own tortilla strips. It's very thick so you may want to add more chicken broth.

Nice flavors!  I omitted the tortillas as I don't eat them (I did buy  some tortilla chips for the fam).  For the chicken, I pounded it flat, and then cut into strips.  I then put all the dry seasonings on it and let them sit for about 30 minutes.  After  cooking the onion, garlic, and cilantro I put the chicken in and browned it a bit.  Then I added all the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer for 30 minutes.

Delicious  soup! I halved it and made it yesterday,  giving the flavors a better chance to develop.  I had a jalapeno pepper on hand and added that to the sauteeing of the onions. For a soup like this, I preferred to shred the chicken vs chunks. I also cut back a little on the chicken, because I added half a can of drained black beans. ] I just realized that I forgot to add the cilantro (and I have a fresh plant), but I'll try adding  some later when I have another bowl. I added some lime juice to the bowl of soup and topped with some shredded Mexican blend cheese. I had the tortilla chips while having the soup vs putting them in it earlier. I didn't want the possible sogginess. I highly recommend this! Thanks for the recipe!

Just what I was searching for last winter. Very satisfying and amenable to garnish on hand.

When I made this for a party the next day, we ate it all up for supper when we were tasting it and I needed to make a 2nd batch for the party!  There is a delicate balance between the tomatoes, 1/4c fresh lime juice, (it adds a wonderful freshness & Mexican flavor) and chicken broth. I used a rotisserie chicken.  Took the bones & wings, added them to water just to cover bones, onion and celery for added flavor to make this broth.  This soup is so much better with homemade broth. I did not put the tortillas in the soup pot. I added crunchy tortilla strips on top of the bowl when I served it. I also added the tomatoes just before serving so they don't cook. If they cook they make the soup all pink and not this clear beautiful broth.  Enjoy.

This soup was really yummy. I was skeptical of the tortillas based on the other reviews.  I chopped the tortillas into strips about 1/2 x 2 inches.  Visually they were barely noticeable, but they did add taste and somewhat thickened the soup. Make sure that you use CORN tortillas, flour tortillas would turn to mush!  And tortilla chips might add some oil that others are complaining about. I also used Rotele tomatoes and added frozen corn. I will definitely make it again.

I like this easy recipe, but I don't add corn tortillas until the end, when I put a bowl on the table for people to help themselves.  I also add corn, either a can of kernel corn or cut kernels off the cob.  I sometimes include sliced zucchini, which can get mushy if cooked too long, so I put it in at the last 10 minutes. (Also, less oil is a must!)
Enjoy!

I've used this recipe for years now! It is a go to recipe for my family!! It is delicious as is. I usually use a little less oil and I use 3 10oz cans of rotel instead of the diced tomatoes for a little extra kick! I also add corn and black beans at the end of cooking. Then top with cheese, cilantro, and crispy tortilla strips! Sour cream is good too, it will take away a little of the spice if it's too much. It is delicious!!!

I made this many, many times but most notable was for a lifelong Texan visiting us . Not only did he say it was the best chicken tortilla soup he's ever had, he went on to say it was the best soup of any kind!

As written, this recipe is simple and basic. With a couple changes it is super still super simple and with the suggested modifications (by several reviewers) it was delicious! The changes I made were that I subbed a can of Cream of Chicken Soup for one of the cans of chicken stock and I used leftover rotisserie chicken, instead of canned chicken. Also added a healthy dash of cumin, chili power, garlic powder and salt. Served it topped with shredded Mexican cheese, dollop of sour cream, chunks of avocado and a few broken nachos. Hearty and flavorful! I'll definitely make this regularly.

Unbelievably good! Better than any restaurant! This is also a great way to use up the bumper crop of tomatoes from the garden. I made it exactly as written - leaving out the cayenne pepper as we don't like spicy food. Only exception was the tortillas - I didn't have any so I used crunchy tortilla chips crushed in the bottom of each bowl. I paired this with corn muffins. A little butter on the corn muffins and then dip them in the soup. ??

I like to fry up the tortillas and set them aside. Instead of cooking them with the soup. I love this recipe and it's been a hit across the west coast. I tend to use leftover baked chicken so my husband will actually eat the dark meat! Really take the time to cook down canned tomatoes and use a good broth to really pound flavor into the soup!

This was pretty good as a base but bland even though it had an excess of spice. I had to add some things to make it to my liking. I added the rest of the container of Chicken broth (normal sized Swanson container) a Chicken bullion cube, a little extra salt, extra Cilantro base (the kind in the jar), extra juice from a jar of minced garlic and a pinch more chili powder. It tasted pretty good but had way too many "spices" even after adding extra broth. I would suggest finding a way to cut back on the content of spices without loosing flavor, you'll have to do this by taste. If you don't you'll find yourself half chocking and coughing on the spice.

I had to do a lot of doctoring of this recipe as there was just not enough complexity for our family's taste. First of all I doubled the recipe, then I minced 6 jalapeños (no seeds) to the onion. (Now I'm not one for HOT flavor at all but without the seeds, the jalapeños are just a nice bell pepper-type taste.)  I saved the cilantro to be served on the top of the soup. I added 2 cans of corn, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of pintos and 1 can of sliced olives along with 3 cans of the tomatoes. I used two large cartons of chicken broth. I used 6 of the tortillas and minced them (in the Cuisinart) together with the seasonings. I added the tortilla mixture to the broth to thicken it which worked very well. I sautéed the chicken separately and added it at the very end just before serving, so as to keep it soft and tender. I set out crunchy tortilla chips, grated cheddar cheese, sour cream, minced cilantro and chopped avocado to add to the top of the soup as it was ladled into the bowls. With all these changes the soup was absolutely magnificent!

Very good soup! My family loves it! 
Sometimes I add a can of black beans or pinto beans & cut back on the chicken. It's more budget freindly, and we already eat a lot of chicken.

I have made this several times and it always turns out great! One thing I wanted to point out is that you need to use soft corn tortillas (as opposed to tortilla shells or chips). These will break down and thicken the soup if you cook it long enough so I would strongly recommend you not skip this step! My changes: I always add 2 cans of black beans and a bell pepper to make it more of a chili. Also, try shredding the chicken. Instead of cooking just a half hour, I let it simmer for about 1 1/5 hours. You can also use a hand blender to break down the tortillas if they still are not disintigrated enough for you. Serve with avocado, shredded cheese, fresh cilantro, tortilla chips and sour cream. YUM!!!

First, deep fry the tortillas separately and DON'T put them in the soup afterwards to cook, otherwise they become a soggy mess - you only need 4 tortillas at most.  Also, unless you want chicken tortilla stew, don't use 5 chicken breasts - maybe 2 or 3.  Next time I will be trying a differenct recipe because this  recipe, as is, was NOT soup!

Wonderful recipe!  This is similar to soup I ate in a restaurant last year. I found out too late that my tortillas were no good, so I omitted them.  Added black beans for bulk & shoepeg corn.  Everyone loved it.  This will become a staple in our home.   Next time, I'll make sure I have fresh corn tortillas & leave out the corn.

This is the best tortilla soup recipe! However, I have never heard of doing the tortillas at the beginning. Usually, you toast the tortilla strips in the oven, lightly salt them, then top the soup with the strips and cheese immediately before serving. That is the only modification I have made other than adding more cilantro because I looove cilantro!

Yummy!  I did make some changes - we like lots of flavor, so I halved everything except the spices.  Didn't use cilantro b/c we don't care for that flavor.  Also, I added some frozen corn.  Perhaps that's the missing flavor another reviewer mentioned.  I only used a tiny bit of oil, just enough to cook the onion and garlic.

This soup was excellent!  My family loved it!  I did cut down on the amount of oil, and added frozen corn, and topped it with green onions, shredded cheddar cheese and tortilla strips.  I cut in half the number of tortilla strips that I cooked in the soup,and made crunchy strips out of them, it worked great!

I followed this recipe to the letter. I know everyones tastes differ but when I was done with this I found it to be a little bland. In order to satisfy my taste I had to add some Tony Chachere's seasoning salt and some canned chopped green chilis. With those two things added I really enjoyed the soup. I did not cook the tortilla strips in the soup. I fried them and allowed each person to add them to their bowl of soup.

This was good, but a bit too much in the flavor department for me, so I added about 6 oz. water. For the torillas I sprayed each side with PAM and put them in the broiler oven on high for 3 minutes on one side, flipped over, then 2 minutes. They were crispy around the edges and softer in middle.

I followed the recipe until the end. I added a splash of cream to give it a lighter color as I added in the chicken and heated it through.   I paired mine up with a garnish of 2 Tostitos Hint of Lime chips and a dollop of sour cream.  My husband loved and we had enough to take for lunch the next day :)

This is by far the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had.. I have made it numerous times for family and they always want the recipe. The one and only thing I changed was the can of tomatoes. I had a can of the "mexican tomatoes" with lime juice and green chilies and I used that instead. Thank you so much for sharing such an awesome recipe!

My Mexican friend thought I couldn't cook Mexican food, until I cooked him this soup - he loved it. Actually all my friends tell me it's their new favorite soup. I usually put in less salt and more bay leaves and that's perfect for me.

A very tasty soup.  A little kick from the cayenne pepper but I like it.  The only changes I made were, I didn't have cilantro, plus my fiance doesn't like it.  I also added some corn and some black beans, and used dark meat instead of breasts.  Other than that, I followed the seasonings that the recipe called for.  Very yummy especially on a cold fall day in Ohio!  Thank you!

This is a really good recipe, but I felt that it would have been a bit plain as is.  I reduced the amount of oil to about 2-3 T.  I added a bit of cayenne pepper for kick.  (I didn't add enough, though.)  Then I added about half a can of black beans and about a cup of grilled corn kernels.  I topped it all of with strips of fried corn tortilla.  Had I been a teensy less concerned for fat content, I would have also topped it with a bit of cheese and maybe a dab of sour cream.

Awesome recipe! The only variations I made were adding some jalapenos to the mix and using some leftover rotisserie chicken rather than buying some new breasts. I made this for my parents and they absolutely loved it, even my Dad who didn't think he would like it. I was very impressed myself and found that the recipe rivals my favorite Chicken Tortilla Soup from a local restaurant.

Good start for a soup. I have made this a few times and find it still needs a bit more flavor. I tried adding both green chilies and black beans or pinto beans and It hit the spot for me. As for the tortillas, after reading various reviews I decided to fry them and set aside. I added half of them in 10 min before serving (for some texture) and served the other half crispy on top. Save yourself some time and buy tortilla chips at the store. Good stuff though.

This soup was great!  I took the tortillas first and stacked them and sliced thin strips out of half, Then chop the other half real good.  In the oil first fry the strips till crisp and drain on paper towel and save for the end.  Then I followed the recipe and added the crisp tortillas at the end and it was just like Mexico.  Oh I added half Rotel and half diced tomatos, gave it a little kick.

I took the hints from others and upped the cheese to 12oz and cut the chicken broth by half. Also, i use 2 cans of cream of chicken AND mushroom, instead of one of each.

Yummy on a cold day!  I did a couple things differently.  I, like another reviewer, tossed the chicken with the spices then cooked it.  I also added 1 can of 'fiesta corn' and 1 can of northern white beans.  I agree with the other reviewer that 1/2 the oil is plenty (I also used olive oil instead).  I would like to prevent the mooshiness of the tortillas in the soup and may try the chip instead or put them in at the end next time.  Husband loved it!

This recipe was GREAT! I only put in half of the oil and used rotisserie chicken from the store to make it easier. It was soooo good. We topped each bowl with a dallop of sour cream, a little cheese and crumbed tortilla chips. It was delicious! We will make it many times in the future!

Excellent recipe! I used 3tbs of oil insted of 6, used a pizza slicer to cut tortilla strips then cut them in half length, served the soup with the following as condiments: avacado slices, tortilla chips, sour cream, grated cheddar, salsa and tabasco sauce. - ENJOY!

This recipe turned out soo delish that I had to join to post a review. Changes I made: less oil in the beginning, a squeeze of the rooster brand hot sauce instead of the chili power and fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Following other members reviews, I also added a big can of black beans, then topped the finished soup with a bit of sourcream, cilantro, shredded cheddar and avocado. The avocado is my persoanl fave addition to this soup! Next time I'm going to try to add more veggies to this soup to make it even better for you like bits of cauliflower (although not typically mexican) and different/more beans. My boyfriend said this is the best thing I've made to date and that he could actually eat this every week.

I didn't know what to expect b/c I've never eaten this before.  I toasted the tortillas and added them at the end.  I think I should followed the recipe.  I will try it again.

This soup is great. I do everything that the recipe says, but I also add cooked rice, black beans, and a little lime juice/zest. It's more hearty this way. I also added corn once but I prefer it without it. When I eat it, I top it with sour cream, shredded cheddar, and some crushed corn tortillas. Yummy!

I thought this was very good, but did add some things to the recipe.  I added 1 cup of corn and 1 can (drained) of black beans.  I omitted the tortillas from the prep/cooking, and instead served the soup with crumbled tortilla chips, grated cheddar cheese, and a dollop of sour cream on top.  I sauteed the onions, garlic and cilantro with some oil, and then combined all ingredients in a slow cooker, and cooked on AUTO setting for about 4 hours.  Tasty soup, but not outstanding.

I was really suprised by this recipe.  I usually don't finish soups, but my husband and I were licking the bottom of the bowls.  We added black beans and corn, used only 3-4T of oil, and added crispy tortillas on top.  It was great!

This was soooooo good, w/wo my changes! First, I used chicken tenderloins,(about 10 pc) cubed & cooked along in step #1. Near the end of the sauteing I added 1 yellow squash chopped & 1C chopped carrots. When serving I added a slice of avocado, cheese & a little orzo. Watch the cayenne, this made it very spicy, but really good! Enjoy

WOW! This is the recipe I have been looking for! What amazing soup! This is the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had and I try it everywhere I go. I found it easy to make, I only wish I had made twice as much because everyone in the house wants leftovers for tomorrows lunch! I added a 16 oz bag of frozen white corn when I made it. Thank you Trey, for sharing this recipe. I will make it often.

Great flavor! As stated before, you don't need quite as much oil as recommended--half would have been plenty. I added fresh avocado and jack cheese when I served it. YUM!!

Very tasty! I added a can and a half of black beans, about a 1/2 cup of corn and didn't use the corn tortillas. Also, instead of using a 29 oz can of diced tomatos, I used a 14.5oz can of diced tomatos and the same amount of fresh salsa. I really think that made it much tastier. When serving I garnished with fresh cilantro, cheese, sour cream, avocado and tortilla chips. My boyfriend raved!

very good, i do have one kid who thought it a bit spicy so the second time i cut down on the pepper. one of my kids felt he needed to add hot sauce. they all liked it better with the tortillas cut into smaller pieces. didnt seem so "mushy" but the flavor and thickening were still there.

My husband and I make this when we know we want leftovers. Has a great flavor, I usually add a lot more cilantro. I also don't cook it with the tortillas. I serve the soup with crushed tortilla or corn chips.

This was a really good soup!  We had it with crusty french bread and fried tortilla strips.  Unlike what others have posted, I did not care for it as much the next day when we served it over rice. We will make this again though and maybe cut down the serving size, this makes a lot!

NOT BAD. I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH OHMYDAHLIA, THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MISSING AND I CANT QUIT PUT MY FINGER ON IT. I THINK A LITTLE EXTRA CUMIN WOULDN'T HELP.  ADDED CORN AND BLACK BEANS, AND TOPPED WITH SOUR CREAM AND CHIVES.  WILL DEFINITELY PUT IN THE ROTATION.

I had to substitute a lot of ingredients, but overall it was pretty good and really easy!  My 2 year old ate it all up and I put some soup in the food processor, and my 10 month old thought it was pretty dang good too.   Hubby thought it was great!I omitted the cayenne pepper. Overall, it's a keeper if you're short on time and need something yummy for the whole family.  I served it with cheese and sour cream.

I usually do a lighter torilla soup, and thought the amount of tomatoes would not be good.  I was wrong.  This is great - I added one chopped jalapeno to the cilanto/onion, and it turned out great.

The taste to this was GREAT! I give it 4 stars because I wasn't fond on the big chunks of tomatoes in the soup.  However, the taste (without them) was great and tasted even better the following day!

Made it vegetarian and it was delicious.  Didn't have any cilantro, so added a cup of salsa that had cilantro in it.  Instead of chicken added a bag of corn.  Sprinkled with cheddar cheese before serving. Yummy!

Great stuff! 
I did not have tortillas on hand so I used tortilla chips instead~ you would never know the differnce. I added them after the saute of garlic, cilantro and onion.  Even better the next day!

Very good. I think it needed more to the actual soup, so I added corn. To lighten the soup, I didn't fry the tortillas, but baked them and served it with the soup at the end. This was perfectly spiced and really satisfied our craving for tortilla soup without going to Cracker Barrel or Rockne's. Thanks so much!

This recipe is great.  The people that I typically cook for don't enjoy such spicy dishes, however, so I cut the spices down quite a bit.  It still has quite a bite with half the chili powder and cayenne.

Excellent.  My husband, the very picky eater, is not fond of soups but absolutely loved it.  I added the corn and also cooked plain corn tortillas in the soup, which gave it more of a corn taste.  I also added the tortilla chips after serving.  PERFECT!

I really had high hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews, but I was not that impressed.  Although the flavor is pretty good and the aroma through the house was incredible, it ended up looking like mush.  The texture was soggy not hearty due to the tortillas.  I will try to make this again, but next time I will add totilla chips last.

Loved this. I need to make a whole recipe next time so I can have some leftovers. I fried the corn tortillas & added just before serving. May try adding the corn & chili peppers as suggested also. I didn't use the salt because we don't use much salt.

This is a very good soup entree and a nice change from the ordinary.  I used only 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and blue tortilla chips both in the soup and as a garnish. I also added a box of frozen corn and used tomatoes with green chiles. The chips in the soup thicken the soup nicely and gives it a nice what I would think an authentic flavor.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was ok.  I added 1 can of unsalted corn to the soup....it the soup came out great!  

The only problem was when I tried to freeze and reheat the soup a few days later...the consistency was not the same...and it was not exactly "soup" at that point....

This recipe made so much soup, and with freezing and reheating not being an option, I will make this again but only for a large party (no leftovers).

A very good tortilla soup but as I have seen others comment, chicken breast just doesnt work with soup.  Use thigh, wing and leg pieces.

I would also recommend doubling this recipe. I humbly disagree that this soup serves 6-8.  

Other than these rather personal preferences this recipe is just a few short microns away from incredible.

The soup was DELICIOUS except for the tortilla *noodle like* strips being slighty to mushy so i suggest putting them in 10 mins before serving instead of at the very beginning and the flavor was also a little to stroung so i add 2 cups of xtra water.

My husband loved this soup and I will most certainly make this again, it tasted very good and we all enjoyed it. I was a little disappointed with the texture of the tortillas. I'll have to play with it a little. My mother suggested baking the tortillas and adding them later instead of cooking them in oil. My husband would not change a thing and says it's one of his favorites.

This was very tasty - I used six tortillas in the soup and pureed it after it had cooked for a short while.  I also cut up strips of tortillas and fried them for topping.  And I used chicken thighs, not breasts for a bit more richness.  Very tasty and I'll make

This soup had great flavor - the tortillas thickened the soup, but they seemed to get entirely absorbed, so next time I will cut 1/2 of them into thin strips and crisp them for a topping.  I added a can of 'santa fe corn' which gave it a variety of veggies to include black beans and corn.  Very tasty and will definitely make again!

We loved this delicious and **EASY** soup...I reduced the oil, and sauteed the tortillas first, then removed them and added them at the end. They didn't get mushy this way. Also, switched out 1 cup of broth and added 1 cup of milk...served with tacos and beans/rice. Yum!
Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

My boyfriend loves when I make this.  He has asked me to make this for his mother who is a chef!  I find it a bit spicy but, that's easily controlled.  I also fry the tortilla strips seperately and add them before I serve.  I usually garnish with cheese.  Sometimes I get creative and add black beans or corn.  Overall a great recipe.

Really good soup!  Just the right seasoning, with the cayenne, chile and cumin - just what I was looking for. I omitted the bay leaves.  I also added chopped celery and carrots, topped with fresh chopped cilantro, chips, fresh avocado and some shredded cheese.  Will make again and again.

This soup is too spicy for young kids, but my husband and I loved it.  After reading the other reviews, I had already decided to change some things, but as I went to make the soup I also realized I was missing some ingredients.  Here is the rundown of my alterations:  I used lime flavored tortilla chips that I added at the end as a garnish.  I boiled the chicken and then drained most of the water, using the little bit that was left to saute the onion and garlic, therefore using no oil.  I subbed dried cilantro (1/4 cup) for the fresh (definitely would use fresh if I have it).  I added an extra chicken breast because I had to use it up.  I had no cayenne pepper so I subbed black pepper.  I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of veggie broth.  I only had a 14oz can of plain diced tomatoes so I also used a 10oz can of Rotel (tomatoes and peppers).  This recipe allows a lot of room to experiment.  I will definitely make this soup again.

Great Soup my family loved this,I only used two chicken breast and it was still plenty of meat in the soup. I didn't have a bay leaf but still tasted great without it.I also added a dallop of sour cream to my bowl and give a nice creamy taste.I didn't put the tortillas in the soup, served them on the side, Husband has ask me to make this several times. Thanks!!

I simplified this recipe a bit by cooking and shredding the chicken and then throwing everything (except the tortillas) in the crockpot and simmering for a couple hours. I also omitted the oil and onions, reduced the cilantro to 2 teaspoons, and added 1/4 cup tomato sauce to thicken it a bit. I served it with the baked tortilla strips and shredded mozzarella. The result was easy and fantastic! My husband was raving about it, and it made both of our noses run without being TOO spicy. This one is a keeper!

I thought this was really good. My husband raved over it. I was going for meatless, so I substituted avacado (3) for chicken. It was great. I found it a tiny bit greasy so I will use a little less oil next time.

This was great. I did add more cayanne and a can of corn. I didn't thing the tortillas in the soup were bad. I cut them up real small so that if they got mushy it would be okay.

Pretty tasty, especially with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkling of cheese.  Maybe next time I'll also top with some crispy, crumbled tortilla chips just before serving.  Maybe a little lime juice too.

This was a great recipe and so easy to make!  I like my food spicy, so i added two dried red chilli peppers and some cayenne pepper to the recipe.  Also, I only had cimin and corriander mixed togther so I added that instead of just cumin.  Boy was it yummy.  I added some jack cheese at the end which was the perfect finishing touch.  I don't like a lot of meat, so I left out the cooked chicken.  The soup was still very filling without it.  The one thing that concerned me about the recipe was the amount of oil you needed to saute the corn tortillas.  I think next time I will cut back on the oil.
