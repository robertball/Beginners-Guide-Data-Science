I used Truvia sweetener instead of sugar and omitted both the vegetable oil and non-stick spray. This was okay. Three quarters of a cup of non-dairy creamer was overkill, way too much for just one cup of cold coffee--is it possible that it might be a misprint? I might try this again and cut the creamer back by half but as is, it was almost undrinkable for me.

I drink iced and blended coffee all year round and am a huge fan so I decided to try this new recipe. I made as directed with no changes. Unfortunately, I did not care for this. Sounded OK in theory, but definitely not for me.

I drink iced coffee 365 days a year so I thought I'd give this a whirl. I made it exactly per the recipe, oil and cooking spray included. The oil did emulsify this amd give it a oooler texture. I am not sure what the point of the cooking spray vs more oil.  Anyway, I am glad I tried this as an experiement but this is not for me. The coffee creamer gave this a fake unnatural taste and I prefer the taste of real milk or almond milk in mine and the oil? While an interesting idea, the idea I was drinking oil  - well just didn't sit well with my morning coffee

I used less creamer and sugar. Also used dark Cocoa. Very refreshing!
