Very tasty and easy to throw together. Since I didn't have any almonds on hand I subbed it with walnuts. It will be a perfect summer salad to make.

Jason your salad has potential but there is a major error on the lettuce amount! I think it should be closer to at least 8 cups of lettuce. A typical salad has 2 cups of lettuce per person. 1/4 cup of dressing 3/4 cup of dried fruit and 1/2 cup of nuts is incredible for the amount of lettuce. As a result I kept the lettuce the same maybe adding a little more and did about 1 tblsp of each topping. Still 4 Tblsp of dressing was a bit much. I used a lighter yogurt ranch. Unless this is supposed to mainly be fruits and nuts mixed with ranch dressing? With the added garlic and parmesan it reminded me of a ceasar salad with added nuts and fruit. Add more lettuce and add the other ingredients to taste and this is not too bad if one loves ranch dressing. I also would only make this right before serving. The lettuce starts to break down from the dressing as most lettuce salads with the dressing mixed directly in.

I made this for a luncheon with 9 people and everyone loved it (even my kids went back for second and third servings. It was great that I had all the ingredients on hand too.
