Not bad but definitely average.  The rum flavour is lost.

This cake was SOOOOOOOOOOO good.  I too adapted it a little more to add more rummy goodness.  I left out the lemon zest and juice and added 2 tsp of rum.  I also used 6 tbsp of butter and 1/4 cup of extra light olive oil in place of the the 2/3 cup butter to lower the saturated fat content of the cake.  Finally, I used the previous reviewers recipe for a rum glaze but it made way too much, you probably only need 2 tbsp melted butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup rum (after removing from heat). It was very good moist and addictive!

I used the basis of this recipe to make a very rummy cake that came out super good. What I changed: Swap almond extract for equal amounts of rum extract. Leave out the lemon zest. Swap the 2 tsp. lemon juice for rum. leave out the almonds & use a rum glaze made with 3 tbsp butter, 3/4 cups brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar, and +-1/2 cup rum of your choice. Dissolve sugar in melted butter, remove from heat and stir in rum. Yum!

This is an excellent recipe, instead of using rum I used almond extract, curshed almonds and a box of white cake mix.

So Worth the Calories! Cake light sponge with a hint of Rum. I did use a tad bit more the aroma of the cake and Rum was a marriage in heaven! I doubled the mix to make cup cakes. For the filling I used a vanilla custard with Swiss meringue frosting what ever is used on this awesome cake will taste amazing! Thanks will use this recipe forever!
