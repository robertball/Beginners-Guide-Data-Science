I was mainly looking for a good combination of seasonings. To cut down on carbs, I left out the carrots and potatoes and used more of the other veggies. I also substituted tomato sauce for tomato juice and added a can of diced tomatoes. My whole family loved it, said it was the best ever. Thanks.

There was nowhere near enough juices, I could tell from the recipe so I even added a little extra broth, it turned out like a stew, a very dry stew.

I thought this recipe was terrible and I threw 80% of it away. I had to add more broth than called for and it has way too much basil and Italian seasoning in it. Will not make again!

This was delicious. I do think there's a problem with the recipe, though. I can't help wondering if it's supposed to read 1 qt of chicken broth rather than one cup. I used frozen green beans from my garden, so I added 1 extra cup to start with to make up for the missing liquid. There was still nowhere near enough liquid. I ended up using several extra cups and a little extra tomato juice, too. I thought the seasonings were spot-on, not overpowering at all. My cabbage cooked away to nothing by the time the soup was done. This would be a five star recipe if not for the amount of liquid. I would absolutely say start with 4 cups of broth. One cup is definitely not enough. Leftovers are great the next day.

My husband said it was fantastic and that I could make this dish any time again.  I use frozen veggies instead, and added cooked noodles in at the end just before serving.  Very hearty dish for a cold winter supper.  Yummie...the spices were a perfect blend.

This soup was delicious, but I think the recipe is wrong.  I used 1 litre (4 cups) of V8 vegetable juice, as well as the broth.  Any less, and there would not have been enough liquid.

Very tasty soup. Noticed although that there was not enough liquid. I just doubled the amount of tomato juice and chicken broth. LMAO I also forgot to buy the cooked chicken before i made this tasty recipe. Used Italian turkey sausage, browned it before i added it to the soup and cut the additional cooking time to 45 minutes for this recipe. (Would have given the recipe the full stars if it would have not been so misleading with the broth and tomato juice).

I liked this! It was very thick, definitely not very soup like. [Always read the reviews! i would have caught this] I misread the recipe and added tomato sauce instead of juice, and I did add a bit of water just for the extra liquid. I added a lil celery and cauliflower too.  I would make this again, maybe next time add some small pasta shapes or something. my toddler approved so that's a win all around.

This was a big hit! This recipe really only made enough for five people, and left us wanting more! Update: Made this again tonight and I doubled up on the cabbage, used a whole bell pepper, 2 cans of broth, 2 cans of green beans and doubled the V8! Also, I didn't drain the green beans, which kept it from not having enough fluid.
