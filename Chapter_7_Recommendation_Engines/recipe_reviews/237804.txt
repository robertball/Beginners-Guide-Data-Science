The flavor is PERFECT. No need to make any changes.  Note the servings are kind of small. For me, this was more like 2 servings. Super simple to make with ingredients I always have on hand. Be sure to use really ripe bananas for added flavor. Next time I will freeze a cut up banana first to make the shake colder because after blending it was room temp. Very smooth! This would also be tasty with almond or coconut milk. Thanks for the great recipe!

Quick and tasty!  If including a banana (frozen makes milkshake nice and cold), be sure to adjust the amount of honey ... riper banana = less honey.  Thanks for the recipe Sugar High.

I added 3/4 cup of milk because I think it would be too watery for me, personal preference. Wayy too sweet, would recommend to put one tablespoon first and adjust to preference. First time i made it it was so sweet that i can barely taste the avocado. However,overall, great recipe !! Thank you for the great recipe!!

I used a frozen banana and cashew milk.  I didn't measure anything, just kind of dumped the ingredients in the blender. 
 I'm pretty sure I used less than 3 tbsp of honey.  very yummy - I'll definitely be making this again!

This is a great 'Run out of the door' kind of shake!! I've made it more times than I can count, I use either Cashew or Coconut milk unsweetened and no honey and still enjoy!!

Very tasty but a bit too sweet for me. My banana was frozen and I substituted coconut milk for the regular milk. I think next time I will cut back on the honey. I should have known better since I always wait until my bananas are more black than yellow when I freeze them.

Yummy. Even my picky son loved it! Add chia seeds to it for more protein.
