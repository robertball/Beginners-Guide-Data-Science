Terrific! Since I don't like Rotel tomatoes, I used salsa and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top and baked until cheese was melted.

I went about this a bit differently.  I sauteed my onions in a heavy bottom sauce pan and added my meat, in this case, Johnsonville Sweet Italian sausage, which I removed from the casing and cooked them together until the sausage was almost cooked.  I added the rice, the tomatoes, undrained and 1/2 cup of water stirred it all together and allowed it to come to a boil, then reduced the heat and let it simmer until all the liquid absorbed.  Just before serving I added my diced green pepper.  Super easy, great flavor and a fun twist on Spanish rice.  Thanks, Mark!

We added a clove of garlic to the onions and peppers (mixture of green/yellow/red) after draining the meat, along with about 1/4t of oregano.  Added the tomatos and about 1C frozen corn, along with the water and rice to cook the rice in with the beef mixture.  After the rice was done, stirred in about 1C cheddar cheese. Delicious and flavorful.

Kind of bland really. I sauteed to beef with onions & peppers and made to rice with beef broth. I used plenty of salt and pepper but it needed seasoning. The spicy tomatoes did give some flavor but definitely not enough!

This was okay. Probably won't make again. Just a little plain to me.
