This recipe turned out to be VERY quick and easy, and still tasted wonderful even with using lite whipped topping, neufchetal(sp?) cheese, and sugar free pudding!  Taking another reviewer's suggestion, I increased the amount of cream cheese mixture slightly, and as a result it gooped over the edge when I added the chocolate layer.  Will definately make this again, but will let the cream cheese layer set slightly before adding the  chocolate.  Good recipe!

My guests literally fight over this pie, debating over who has the biggest slice, and there's never a morsel left over!!  It's so absolutely easy to make (no oven required--yea!) and I have never had anyone NOT like this pie!  I found the recipe for this in a magazine years ago, and couldn't find it til now.  Thank you so much for bringing it back!! :-)  Folks, you CAN NOT go wrong with this pie!!!!

This is a great recipe, but I use powdered sugar instead of white sugar. I never have any pie left over.

This pie is a fave in our house too!! Been serving this pie for years now-- it's actually a recipe out of a Cool-Whip cookbook that I have! Like others, I make with a graham cracker crust sometimes. But I pipe the Cool Whip on top and it looks spectacular.. And I also drizzle a little chocolate syrup for added pizazz!

I make several of these pies at Thanksgiving and Christmas and never have any left over!! I have experimented with different pudding flavors & they are always a hit - oreo cookies & creme, mint chocolate chip, white chocolate, etc.! hands down the easiest dessert to make and always a HIT!!

I was looking for a pie that would be special enough for the Holidays and easy to make sugar free for my diabetic friend, this was it! fantastic! Both flavors blend well and yet are distinct from eachother, and it's easy as pie to make ;-) Thank you so much for this recipe! Oh I also made one low fat and sugar free, still delicious

I followed this recipe exactly except for using a regular graham cracker crust instead of chocolate. Took the pie to a church dinner and everyone seemed to like it very much! I also enjoyed how easy and quick this recipe came together :o)

This was great!!!!! Very easy, I used a little more cream cheese than the recipe called for and it still turned out great. I used cook and serve pudding and let it set then i added it on top of the cream cheese mixture! My local store was out of the oreo pie crust so i used graham cracker crust.It was all gone within minutes of serving. I do recommend you chill completly before servins.

This has always been my favorite recipe. To make the taste a little different, I use a honey graham crunch crust instead of the chocolate one. It puts a different spin on the recipe. Either way, its amazing!

I wanted a chocolate dessert to round out the Easter Sunday menu and I had all the ingredients on hand to make this pie. It was incredibly quick and easy to throw together and was delicious. I'd definitely make this one again. Thanks for a great no-bake recipe!

used a graham cracker crust because it's what I had. The fillings were more than enough - the cool whip on top was really quite a bit higher than the edge of the pie! Everyone loved it, will definitely make again.

Very easy and very good dessert. I used a graham cracker crust instead of chocolate cookie crust and it turned out great. I shaved some chocolate curls to top it off with for decorations - Everyone loved it.

Very yummy.  I had to make some alterations based on what I had available in my pantry.  I only had one box of chocolate pudding, so I decreased the milk to one cup to ensure the thick consistancy.  I also didn't have a chocolate crust, so I used the graham crust I had on hand.  Still came out very good.  Would like to try again w/the proper ingredients.

IT'S OKAY, BUT I THINK THE CREAM CHEESE LAYER DETRACTED NEXT TO THE CHOC PUDDING. I ONLY USE COOKED, SUGAR FREE PUDDING. I MAKE THIS PIE WITHOUT THE CREAM CHEESE AND WE LIKE IT BETTER. THANKS, ANYWAY.

Don't know if just the ingredients I used, but epic failure!   The crust fell apart and the pudding needed cooking.  (I used the instructions on the recipe and did not work, ended up having to redo  using instructions on the individual ingredients bought, instead).  Not sure if instant pudding and prebaked crust exist, but they are not available at the store here.  Again, perhaps ingredients error and not recipe, so take poor rating loosely please.  The cream cheese layer tasted great, will use that in a different dessert dish!!

We love this pie!! And it is so easy! Every year I try a new chocolate pie, many have been complicated, but I this one's a winner! I added 2/3c of melted choc. chips to the cream cheese mixture because my husband is a chocolate lover. Other than that it's perfect!

This might have been better if I had chilled the cream cheese mixture before adding the pudding.  I could not spread it evenly over the cream cheese.  I ended beating it all together.  I didn't eat it because I don't like chocolate.  I was making it for a friend's birthday.  I was disappointed.
