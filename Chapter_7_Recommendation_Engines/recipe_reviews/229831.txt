These were awesome! Very moist and full of banana flavor. I had to use vanilla Greek style yogurt instead of plain as that was all I had on hand and I added only chopped walnuts because I didnt have any raisins. Otherwise followed the recipe. Everyone loved them.  Made a second batch today and decided to go a little healthier by using half whole wheat & half white flour and threw in about 2 TBSP ground flax seed. Also replaced the oil (previously used Canola) with 1/2 cup applesauce and added 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp cinnamon. I let the bran soak in this mixture a little longer to make sure it was thoroughly wet before adding the dry ingredients. These were even better than the first batch. Still came out moist and delicious and no one noticed the healthy changes. (Love it when that happens:). Will definitely be making these again. Thanks so much for sharing.

Tried this today. They turned out just wonderful. I did make a few mods.  I use greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt, added 1 tsp vanilla and almond extract.  I used both raisins and pecans.  For the flour I use Chef Brads Wonder Flour mix, which is equal parts of spelt, brown rice and pearl barley.  I also add a part of soft white wheat as well.  These are mixed and ground together into a fine flour.  I love this stuff, works as well or better than regular flour and is whole grain and so much more nutritious.

These were amazing.  Made the following adjustments for a healthier version:  substituted pastry flour for white flour (lower gluten), 1/2 c. applesauce for oil, and only 1/3 c. packed brown sugar.  Also added 2 T.  flaxseed, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Moist and full of flavor.  They'll never know these are healthier.

Kinda dry. I think they would have been better if had been more moist. I followed the recipe.  I have been making other bran muffins lately and 400 deg seemed a little high for 17 minutes but I went with it anyway.  I think that is why they are dry, that is too long or too high. Most other muffin recipies bake 375 deg for about 17 minutes.  My fault, I should have watched them more closely while baking.

These are so nice & moist . I did add a little extra banana , not wasting it because it was a little over the cup measurement . BTW 1 cup banana is roughly 3 med bananas . Use whatever kind of yogurt you have on hand .Oh 1 little change I used half brown sugar & half stevia .

This is my go to muffin recipe, I have made it at least a dozen times this year.  I always have all the ingredients on hand, and they always turn out moist.  I have also substituted pumpkin for the banana and added pumpkin pie spices, they were yummy.  If I am making them for my kids, I substitute cinnamon applesauce for the oil, and reduce the sugar, you can hardly notice a difference.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Also almost filled 3/4 cup with yogurt and topped it with milk.  For my oven 375 was a better temp for 15 minutes.

I made it yesterday and used oatmeal in it. It become delicious. My little boy loves it and it was easy to involve him in the kitchen with me as it was not complicated.
My son ate 2 while still was warm.
This will be our main banana muffin as he said it's his favourite too.

I made these this morning, they are still warm and they are being gobbled up left and right.  I was able to make 14 muffins.  I also substituted a almond coconut granola for the bran cereal and they came out really well.  Will definitely make these again.  Nice and moist!

This recipe is not only DELICIOUS, buts it's healthy too!!! They came out super moist. I substituted half of the flour with whole wheat flour, and added just a teaspoon more of salt. I highly recommend this recipe!

These where a hit with the fam and they donâ€™t normally like banana anything. I used Fage Greek yogurt. I used Special K Apple cinnamon crunch. 350f in convection oven for 20mins. Will make again!

Excellent tasting, light texture and good for you. I doubled the recipe, since I had that many bananas taking up too much space in my freezer. I made 24 regular and 24 bite size, but could have easily topped up the regular sized ones instead, since they don't overly rise much. But even without the huge spring while baking they turned out superlight and airy. I did double the Baking Powder and used Buttermilk in place of the yogurt. Wholewheat flour instead of white and a healthy handful of Chocolate Chips and about 1/4 c of ground Flaxseed was also added. And a teaspoon of cinnamon as well. Mmmmmm, will be keeping this recipe to use up my bananas.

Moist , delicious and healthy. I've tried a lot of bran muffin recipes and this is by far the best one.  I've made this recipe three times with various flavor adjustments.  I like that it is easy to tell when they are done;  It is easy to tell when they are done; and they do not stick to the cupcake holder.  After my first batch, I have double the batch so I have enough for everyone for the week.   They go fast.  Family that don't eat healthy muffins eat these!

These were delightfully fluffy and full of flavor. Who knew that a container of yogurt and bran flakes could make such a light and airy, rich-tasting muffin? This is is now my go-to recipe! Thank you for submitting it.

I placed the mashed bananas at the bottom of the bowl ten the cereal with the yogurt on top and let  it sit for about 15 mins then added the eggs brown sugar and oil.  added a teaspoon of cinnamon and after sifting a 1/2 cup of chopped raisins  to the  dry ingredients,  then combined the two with a minimum amount of stirring.  Spooned the batter into 17 paper-lined muffin cups.  Baked at 375 degrees for 20 minute .  The muffins not only filled the cups 
are great.

Easy and yummy! I didnâ€™t have bran cereal so I used plain Cheerios which worked well too.  Instead of brown sugar I finely chopped up an apple an a few strawberries for sweetness, softened them in a small pot for a few minutes before adding them to the recipe. Turned out well for me :)

Good recipe to use up overripe bananas. I used Wheaties cereal (vs. Bran cereal) and per suggestions of others added 1 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla then substituted applesauce for the oil in addition to using 1 cup all-purpose flour + Â½ cup wheat flour. Muffins were moist with nice banana flavor. I cooked muffins at 375 for 19 minutes and muffins turned out just right.

I made these with no changes (other than leaving out raisins/nuts - we were out of both). The muffins were perfect! Every family member liked them and that is rare. I was a little concerned about filling the muffin cups almost to the top, but they rose perfectly without spilling over. I used All-Bran cereal (the one that looks like little twigs), and regular, plain yogurt. They came out of the oven super soft, moist, and just sweet enough - not overly sweet. This is replacing the bran muffin recipe I've used for years. It's a keeper. Thank you!

Used bobâ€™s quick oats instead of bran cereal, 1/2 cup wheat flour replacement for 1/2 white, added 2 tablespoons wheat germ, Greek yogurt, extra tablespoon of brown sugar to offset yogurt tartness, frozen blueberries, and buttered the muffin tins. Delish and healthy!

I had to make a few minor changes to the recipe because I didn't have the exact ingredients listed. I used 1/2 cup of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I used buttermilk instead of Jogurt and I used a whole cup instead of  3/4 of a cup. I used 3 bananas which was more than 1 cup mashed.
Other than that I followed the recipe and the muffins turned out fantastic!! Awesome flavor and texture. Love them and will definitely make again

Nice tasty muffins. I used wheat bran instead of cereal and vanilla yogurt instead of plain and apple sauce instead of oil. I was surprised that they plumped up so nicely and they were tasty with a nice texture.

These turned out great! If you are using a dark pan, perhaps reduce the baking time. I used Raisin Bran cereal and added extra raisins. Will definitely make these again.

Very moist! I added teaspoon vanilla, half all purpose flour, half whole wheat, applesauce instead of oil! Very good!! Would freeze well if made double batch. Next time may try maple syrup or honey in place of brown sugar.

Super moist and delicious; easy to make. I substituted granola for the bran cereal, and it worked out great. I will definitely make this one again. Next time, I'm thinking about substituting applesauce for oil to make it a little healthier.

These are great! I ran out of raisins so instead the frozen cranberries gave it a tasty  jest! Shorter cooking time makes them a little moister, worth a try!

A little too much bran flavour for my tastes, but healthy and moist. Light, fluffy and not too sweet - just right. Baked at 185C for 16 mins. Hubby and toddler were fans.

Oh my heck, just what I was hoping for. Light, nutty, delicious. I used half brown sugar and half splenda plus half whole wheat and white flour, sprinkled the top with sliced almonds and yum! These will be my go to healthy snacks.

Used greek style yogurt as the only change. I made 15 muffins and you don't even taste the bran. Lovely banana taste.

Tried this tonight and they turned out good. Not super sweet. Instead of bran cereal I used ground flax seed and some hemp seed, also used coconut oil right out of the jar ( no melting) 0% mg fat plain organic yogurt, and semi sweet chocolate chips for the raisins. No nuts so I could send in my son's lunch to school as a treat . Thank you!

These muffins are so moist and delish.  I used Activia yogurt instead of regular yogurt.  I will definitely pass this recipe on.  Thx for sharing.

Easy and quick to make. Very moist and tasty. Replaced bran cereal with crushed granola bars due to availability in the cabinet.

These are very tasty.  I used nonfat Greek Yogurt and subbed 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 3/4 cup regular flour.  I added a handful of low-sugar dried cranberries and a handful of walnuts.  I like to have different textures in my muffins.  Excellent and healthy and even my 16-year old grabbed one on her way to school this morning.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was great.  You can't taste the bran cereal, the yogurt does change the texture making the muffins a bit stretchy but that's excpected with the yogurt substitution, next time I make them i'd add a tsp of vanilla for flavor.  A few tips:  I filled the cupcakes 3/4 full, and still had batter left over for another 3 cupcakes, so I'd say the recipe makes more like 15 cupcakes:), but they rose perfectly.  I don't have a convection oven and 16 minutes without liners, 17 minutes with, was the perfect baking time.  I'd also recommend a crumb topping:)  Thanks for the recipe!
