This is an easy, creamy casserole. I used a soft white cheese rather than a brick of cream cheese. The one thing it sorely needed was flavor. I added 2 tsp. salt, 2 tsp. granulated garlic, 1 tsp. garlic, and 1 tsp. Italian seasoning. That helped give it some zing.

This recipe was quick and easy to make.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, used low fat cream cheese, used a blend of part-skim mozzarella, smoke flavored provolone, parmesan and romano cheeses and did not use any parmesan on top.  I also added onions to the pasta when I boiled it because I love onions and used some garlic salt for additional seasoning.  It was delicious.

I loved it. It's creamy and cheesy comfort food. Very simple to make casserole.

There is nothing disagreeable in this dish, but it needs something more.  It was rather blah to us.  Pepper jack?  Served this with cooked, diced chicken breasts in it.  I won't be making this again.

This dish was definitely tasty!  I made a couple of changes.  Instead of just cottage cheese, I did 1/2 cup of cottage cheese and 1/2 cup ricotta cheese.  I also added some grated pepper jack cheese for extra flavor.

I should have added some salt and maybe a little garlic as it was somewhat bland
