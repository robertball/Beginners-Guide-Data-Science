This was a simple and delicious tasting Monte Cristo. The Blackberry Dipping Sauce was perfect. I generally prefer coating my pans in butter instead of cooking spray but this turned out nicely. I may recommend cooking at a lower temperature for longer so that the swiss cheese melts more. Overall we really give it 4 1/2 stars!
