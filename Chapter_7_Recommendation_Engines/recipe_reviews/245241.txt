I have been making this dish for years but from a Polish point of view we have always called it  Kapoosta  and always cut up the bacon and onion sautéed it in a pan then rinse the sauerkraut and added that but always used little Smokies and let the bacon grease and all of that cook together with a little bit a water then boil the  noodles and mix it all together.  From start to finish it takes less than an hour to make you don't want to cook the bacon too fast because you don't want burnt bacon grease

Not wanting to deal with all that foil,  I threw all the ingredients into my slow cooker and cooked on low for about four hours. It was great and I will definitely make again but may add a potato to the mix.  I warmed up some good Jewish Rye bread and had a great meal along with left-overs.

I have always  found manufacturer's recipes good, as they want to showcase their product. Timing, however, was so way off in this that not until I finally stuck the whole mess in a pot and cooked it for forty five extra minutes was it adequately done. I wouldn't make it again or at least not this way.

I used this recipe as a base and added ingredients from a couple other recipes and got creative with one or two other additions. First I drained the sauerkraut , but I did not rinse it. I sautéed the onions and chopped garlic in butter then added the sauerkraut and stirred. Then I added a cup of white wine, 1-2 cups of apple juice, garlic pepper, celery seeds, crushed red pepper seeds and brown sugar (approx. 1T) and the sausage to the pan and mixed well. I place the pot/skillet in the oven and baked for 45-60 minutes. Hubby and I enjoyed it...definitely a keeper.

Followed recipe pretty much exactly and was very good. May make again and would add bacon as others suggested. Corn went well on the side. Was cheap (under $10) and easy to make.

Great flavor! I rinsed the sour kraut and it seems to have helped the flavor mellow. Delicious!

I made this with some revisions, not because I thought the recipe needed any adjustment, just wanted to incorporate what I had on hand. The biggest difference was that I added one chopped apple AND one chopped zucchini from my garden. Everybody loved it, including the finicky kids! I also made some seasoning substitutions, again because of what was on hand. I didn’t have caraway seeds, and did NOT want to use fennel. Used herbes de Provence instead, worked great! Trying it again tonight with caraway seeds... but I won’t give up the zucchini!!

Only had 13 oz beef kielbasa but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was very good, even with only half the amount of sausage.  I will make it again adding bacon, as recommended by other reviewers.

I didn't use the foil method -- just cooked on top of the stove.  The apple and onion softens the sharpness of the sauerkraut, and it's a perfect flavor combo.  I followed other reviewers' advice and added some bacon.  Delish!  I can't wait to make this again!

Anything with kraut is OK with me.  Made this as advertised - except I fried some bacon and fried the onions until carmalized.  Delicious.  Will definitely make again.  I served over boiled cubed potatoes.  Yum!

We love sauerkraut, so we were excited to try it. All we had on hand was Andouille Sausage,so we used that. It was very good. The Caraway seeds were a key ingredient. We also diced the onions. Will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this for my husband because he loves sauerkraut and kielbasa whereas I don't. He thought it was very good but something was missing. He helped it along with spicy mustard which turned me off even more but said it tasted better with it. 
It's definitely an easy enough dish to prepare but I'm not sure I'll bother making it again.

Very  tasty -- the only thing I would change when I make it again is to chop up the onions instead of slicing them because I don't like large pieces of onion in my food .... otherwise I enjoyed it!  One change I made (because I'd already bought them) was to use L'il Smokies and cut them in half which turned out just fine!
