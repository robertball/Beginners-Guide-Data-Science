For that fresh bread taste, these buns on tops!  They are a nice lightly sweet dinner roll, that could only be improved if they were more labor intensive...(kneading the dough would make them airier and a lighter bread)  Although the dough needs to rise an hour, making these rolls is "quick" in a sense because after mixing the batter, all you do is let it rise while you go about doing other things.  There is an easy recipe.. good for young cooks first foray into the world of bread making.

I have been making these since I was 10 years old in 4-H (nearly 50 years now). They are blue ribbon buns for sure. Light, fluffy and so easy.

Maybe I took the title of this recipe too literally, but the buns were basically like bread dough as opposed to a batter--I was thinking they'd have more of a pancake batter consistency. However, these rolls had a great yeasty flavor and were very dense.  I wouldn't use all the flour--just as needed. I also baked them at 350 for 15 minutes rather than 425 and they came out fine.  A good, hearty roll.

They looked beautiful but we're quite dense and dry. My yeast was good, just not enough liquid. Would be great with jam.

These are a tasty, soft bun.  The batter is thicker than cake batter but way too soft to knead like a bread dough.  Easy to make and enjoyable.
