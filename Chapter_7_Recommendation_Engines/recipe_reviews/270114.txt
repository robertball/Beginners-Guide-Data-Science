Delicious!  The filling is just right, and the flour tortilla is surprisingly good. The only thing I changed was that I made some tamarind chutney to dip them in, which is my favorite for samosas.  I want to use this filling to make a samosa pie for the next pie auction, I think it will sell very well.

Wow! This recipe was so good. This is my new favorite recipe for curried potatoes. I used the potato filling to make samosas and it was perfect.

Made according to Hoyle.......er...Chef John’s recipe with only modifying the cayenne pepper, I included maybe 1/8 tsp which for my family was more than adequate. This is a keeper, any leftovers were quickly consigned. 
Thank you CJ, you did it again!

I made this using Chickpea Flatbread and used sweet potatoes (both white and orange) instead of regular flour tortillas! It was delish and really tasty. Thank you sooooo much for this recipe. It will become a constant menu item from now on!

It definitely gave me samosa vibes but so many peas.  I'd probably use 1/4 cup if I made this again.

I made it as the recipe called for and it was great!  If you’re not into spicy you may want to cut the Serrano and cayenne amounts down by half.  I would definitely use the recipe again but would probably try use a traditional wrapping instead of the tortilla.  Peace

Seriously excellent recipe. While easy, it is time consuming. Completely worth it however

Amazing!  I live in rural Vermont and there are no Indian restaurants near me. I am so happy with this recipe. Served it to friends last night and they loved it. It tastes better then I remembered (especially the chutney).

Alu samosas are my favorite thing to get at an Indian restaurant, and the taste of the filling is just as delicious. Using tortillas was much easier and faster. I will make these again.

I didn't put cilantro in as I can't stand it and switched the green peas out for some sweet corn but I loved the recipe and will do it again and again, I'm sure. Especially since I now have vegetarians in the family it's really nice to get a Friday family recipe everyone loves!
