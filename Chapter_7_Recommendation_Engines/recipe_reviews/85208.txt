Fablous and really easy!  I adjusted this recipe to make a whole beef tenderloin for a dinner party of 12.  Even tripling the recipe was still very easy to put this on the table.  Served with boiled new red potatoes with garlic, caesar salad, burgandy wine and chocolate lava cakes for desert.

This marinade was absolutely delicious, so was the sauce. I made some changes though. I did not roast the meat. I coated it with the oil, herbs, and stuffed it with garlic and let it marinate about 30min. then I cut a couple small pieces off and set aside for the sauce. I then grilled the meat. The meat pieces and the extra marinade I put in the pot in place of the meat drippings and then added the other sauce ingredients and extra herbs. It was absolutely to die for. My husband said it was so good he's not sure why we bother going out to eat haha

This was fantastic! The sauce is to die for.  There were only two things that I did differently: I let the olive oil, lemon juice and herbs soak into the meat for 24 hours and I added sliced portabella mushrooms to the sauce.  Absolutely incredible

Well, first of all, DO NOT PUT THE ROAST IN THE WATER! Put the roast ON the rack OVER the water.  I opened the roast up and put all the goodies inside, except rosemary. Increased all the spices to at least 1 teaspoon each and tripled the garlic (of course, I live for garlic); you can put your choice of favorite spices in there but Tarragon is a must, retied the roast tightly. Preheated a cast iron skillet with olive oil to very hot, covered the roast with seasalt and fresh ground pepper and seared it on all sides, before sticking it in the oven, with a teaspoon of rosemary bits sprinkled on top, because I love the smell of it! I wouldn't dream of having this yummy dish without Béarnaise sauce, that is also classic for Chateaubriand, but the addition of shallots & Crimini mushrooms to the recipe sauce made it super yummy for me. Spoon the recipe sauce over for plating, but have the Béarnaise in a side dish for dipping, plus the classic Chateaubriand in France always has Chateau Potatoes, which are also yummers with the Béarnaise! I always use a good Cabernet when cooking with red wine; don't cook with wine that you wouldn't drink, the quality matters! Enjoy!

Effectively, an expensive cut of meat from a specialty market was boiled and turned out very chewy. The sauce is the only thing that prevented me from throwing it out.

I have made this several times now, and it always is delicious.  I often don't even make the sauce, but just use the meat preparation.  This tender cut of meat is great all on its own.  NOTE:  I saw another reviewer saying that they boiled an expensive cut of beef.  The meat should be in a roasting pan on a rack and the water sits underneath for moisture.  Don't set the meat in the water.  I also have found that it tasted better with well cracked fresh pepper, not whole peppercorns, that's just my personal preference.  I find whole peppercorns a little overpowering. I love this recipe.

Very good recipe. Served with garlic mashed potatoes. I used more than a "pinch" of the spices.

Very good classic taste. I love the herb/wine taste, it's like the old Italian recipes...

Used the red wine dijon reduction on another recipe here for herb crusted tenderloin and the sauce was out of this world. Easy to make and very flavorful will use it again and again. Thanks!

This was very tasty and easy to prepare. I couldn't find beef tenderloin so I used thick cut T-bones instead. I trimmed the meat from the bone, spread chopped garlic over the steaks instead of stuffing with bits. The sauce was very good with oven roasted potatoes (recipe found here on allrecipes.com ). I will definitely make this dish again. My husband and teenaged son both gave it a thumbs up.

OMG!! This is one seriously delicious recipe! The only thing I did different was marinate it in the spices for 4 hours. This made the best and very romantic dinner for Christmas Eve. Thank you for sharing.

This was just "okay", perhaps a bit too much effort for the end result.  (I'd actually prefer to DRINK the Cabernet than make a sauce out of it.)

Cooked a 4 lb. version in a roasting pan on the grill for a last minute Christmas brunch addition. Served with small buns to make mini sandwiches.  Every bite was gone! I didn't take the time to make the sauce.  I just served it with creamy horseradish.  Awesome!!!!

Have to agree with some that this was a waste of a good piece of meat.  I should have seared the meat first before roasting, to add some color. The sauce was also a waste of good wine.

I was very disappointed with the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, and found that rather than medium rare after 20 minutes, my roast was raw. I cooked it another 10 minutes, and it was more medium to medium rare. Perhaps it was the wine I purchased, but the sauce was sharp and overly tangy. Even though I bought a good cut of meat, it was rather tough. Won't be trying this again.

Absolutely stunning. Mine wasn't quite cooked to our liking at 20 minutes (and I like my beef very rare), so I wound up finishing the roast in a cast iron skillet for a few minutes and then reducing the sauce in that skillet while the meat was resting. The end result was so, so good. We were ready to lick plates clean, honestly.

The meat did not absorb the flavor of the marinade very well.  We did end up having to grill the meat to finish it off, the flavors perked up then.  The sauce was not very flavor full and it took forever to reduce.  We were really disappointed.  Felt like a waste of a great piece of meat.
