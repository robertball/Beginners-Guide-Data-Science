This cake is well worth the cost of a few bottles of red food coloring!  I used real butter, and followed the recipe to the letter, including the store-bought frosting, which I normally don't like.  BTW, Pillsbury Vanilla frosting is actually pretty tasty and went perfectly with the mild flavor of this cake.  I did need about 1 1/2 containers of frosting, but I also used two large layers and frosted in-between.  The finished product is very moist, has a great flavor, looks very impressive!

I bake cakes for others quite often and was asked to make a Red Velvet cake for a company Valentines Day party.  Since I'd never made this cake before, I inquired about a recipe and was referred to this sight by a friend.  I found what I thought was a good recipe since it was by Hershey's and had such high ratings.  The result was that the cake needed more red food coloring as it was more of a dark pink than red.  The feedback from the co-workers was that the cake tasted okay but was VERY dry.  I would not make this cake again without some inhancements to make it more red in color and moist.

When I saw the hershey recipe, I thought that I had found a great recipe, afterall it's by Hershey, right?  Wrong! There are so many changes that I had to make that I won't be making this cake again!  First of all the red food colouring...2 Tbsp is NOT enough.  I increased this to 2 oz of red food colouring (two-1oz bottles) -the next thing I changed was the flour, instead of all purpose, I used cake flour, and increased it to 2 1/2 cups, and I increased the butter to 1 cup.  Next, I omitted the vinegar, and decreased the baking soda to 1 1/4 tsp -quite simply there is NO need for vinegar, to be used in a red velvet cake as long as buttermilk is in the recipe, buttermilk is acidic enough to get the baking soda to rise.  I also decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp.  The vanilla gave it a subtle flavour, but normally I do not use vanilla in my red velvet cakes.  Lastly, the quantity of cocoa was way too much, red velvet cake should have a hint of chocolate, but not be overwhelming, therefore I reduced the amount to 3 Tbsp.
I didn't make it heart shaped, though I'm sure the cake would be gorgeous as a valentines day cake.  
I didn't use the vanilla frosting or the mini chocolate chips, I chose to use a fluffy white icing that comes from my mom, no cream cheese for this Red Velvet Snob!
I truly wish I could have given this cake a higher rank, but after so much time consuming changes, I have to give it a three.

This was a great cake. I made it for a Valentine's Day party (not the heart cut-outs as pictured; I stuck to the 9x13 option). Everyone loved it and more people are enjoying it at work today as well! It was such fun to make, and yes, it takes TWO tablespoons of red food coloring - which is basically a whole little bottle! It's moist and pradoxically dense and light. Wonderful cake - the baking soda/white vinegar reaction was so fun!

I omitted the red food coloring and used cream cheese icing with chocolate chips; it was delicious.

Growing up, Mom made this cake every Valentines Day.  We all looked forward to it & I have fond memories of it, though I haven't had it in years- her recipe is from an old Hershey cookbook.  Now I can make it too.

I made red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for a party and they were a huge hit. Even my friend who usually hates cake couldn't stop eating them. They were a little drier than I would have liked, but I think that is because I kept them in the oven for a tad too long. (I would say 20-22 minutes is sufficient for cupcakes -- I kept them in for 25.) I will definitely make this recipe again!

Well my cake didn't turn out that red on the inside (more food coloring next time i guess) but the pink frosting made it so festive!  I think next time I will go buy those heart shaped pans.  But wow, it tasted so good, and moist!  thanks hershey's.

Great recipe.  Wonderful presentation.  I made this cake for my grandmother's 92nd birthday.  She is very picky.  She loved the cake.  Believe me... that's really impressive!  Kudos to you.

This is a really impressive cake.  I was a little hesitant about using this recipe because of the dryness complaints, however my cake turned out very moist and delicious!  I used an entire bottle of red food coloring and I used the cream cheese frosting II recipe from this website instead of the vanilla frosting.  Very impressive and pretty cake!

Not bad, but not great either.  Very dense nice texture, but not very flavorful.   Not chocolatey enough to be chocolate.  Dark reddish brown color, not real red.  Made large heart shape for Valentine's company.  Not impressed.

Strange texture and sub-par flavor.  Do not bother with this cake.  You are better off with cake mix.

I made this a long time ago for my husband's birthday and hated it. Swore I would never make one again. The color was a big turnoff. I am not a fan of red velvet cakes anyway.

So moist I couldn't get it out of the pan. Next time I;ll make it in 2 8" pans and maybe I'll have better luck. Also wasn't as red as I thought it'd be.

Frosting was the real winner of this cake.  Although, I have to say, the tinted chocolate sheet cake part was enticing in its own subtle way.  But the frosting - oh yeah.  It's all about the frosting.

I made my own mistake of using dark cocoa so it looked like a chocolate cake, but as in other reviews, I also thought that this cake was very dry.  I followed the rest of the directions exactly.  I took it to work.  Only half got eaten.  Not a terrible cake, but certainly not what I would expect from a Hershey's recipe.

I have tried this recipe I would agree it is not the best red velvet cake recipe I have used,  However the red velvet cake that I have had since I was a little kid was indeed a dark reddish brown rather than fire engine red.  Red Velvet cake is best with a buttercream icing and the chocolate flavoring is meant to be subtle otherwise it would just be a chocolate cake with red food coloring.

This was good, but I have had better red velvet cakes.  I think I will try out some other recipes before coming back to this one.  Maybe I didn't add enough red food coloring, but mine really just looked dark brown.

I love to bake, but this was my first time making a red velvet cake.  I must say . . it turned out beautifully!!  The color was just right, the taste was just right and I even bought buttercream icing, which was perfect with the taste.  My friend stopped by to sample my cake and after tasting another version of this cake the following day we both agreed that this recipe was by far the best!  I followed it as written and made a double layer cake instead of the 9x13 pan.  Yes you must used 2 tablespoons, pratically the entire bottle of red food coloring and 1/3 cup of the Hershey's cocoa powder.  I threw in a couple of chocolate chips, which just made it yummier.  I recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind get a little messy while they cook!
