This dish was a big hit with company.  I think the cooking time can be reduced to keep white meat from drying out.  However, the sauce adds moisture.  I served on Basmatti rice with lightly dressed greens on the side.  It was was great!  I strongly recommend for company!

I didn't use the almonds and used Pam spray for the baking pan and frying the chicken.Used 3 chicken breast split in half.Also used 2 cups fresh sliced peaches instead of the canned. They are very plentiful right now. This recipe would feed a crowd. Very good...

Not much peach flavor.  May try it again replacing some of the broth with peach puree
