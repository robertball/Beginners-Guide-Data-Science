Made this last night , my husband is on a low carb diet for diabetes and I’m always looking for new recipes. It was very good the only things that I did differently was I didn’t have tomatoes so I added peppers and onions and I used whipped cream cheese with chives. I will definitely make this again.

Really good served over pasta. I used regular cream cheese (not whipped) and whole milk to make it rich and creamier.

Delicious - older kids loved it (ages 9&11), but my littlest kid (age 5)wasn't a fan ... she's gonna love it in a couple years! We will make this again! thank you so much.

Delicious! it is one those dishes where the leftovers may even be better. I did make changes based on what I had, family taste and timing. I couldn't find the spices so I used Italian seasoning rubbed on chicken tenders which I then baked. while the chicken was in the oven I cooked the vegetables. my daughter does not like tomatoes so I didn't use them. I added carrots and mushrooms,  cut the chicken into bite size pieces and added to the veggies and sauce. I did serve it with rice but this easily stands on its own. Everyone loved it.

Fantastic keto Recipe!  Get start for anyone looking to start a keto diet. I used slightly more oil for cooking the chicken, then drained the excess prior to adding the vegetables.
