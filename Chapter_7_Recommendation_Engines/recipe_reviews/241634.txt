Easy to make and tastes just like Applebee's awesome dip.  Doubled the recipe for a large crowd and it worked great.  Leftovers freeze and re-heat well.

This was very easy to throw together and tasted great. I followed the directions exactly and ended up adding quite a bit of extra black pepper at the end. I made a double batch and it could have easily served a party of 20-25 people.

Easy to make and delicious! I brought it to a party and everyone  loved it. I put it in the oven for about 20 minutes and then brought it to the party where I put it in a crock pot to keep it warm. (I actually put the crock pot in the oven and then just transferred it to the heating container once at the party).

I made this close to exact, just used Garlic Parm Alfredo Sauce. Soo Good! Doesn't really need anything, but next time I made it I used full bar cream cheese, and that put it over top! also add a little black pepper to taste. I will not change anything again, its so yummy! I also put single portions in baggies and froze (I;m single) and put the small portions in my air fryer, when I am in the mood...works great!

made it the first time and it was pretty good but I thought it could be improved. the second time I only put 1/2 cup parmesan, I upped the cream cheese and mozzarella to 8oz cream cheese and 1 cup mozzarella. I thought it better than Applebee's with the changes

I've never had Applebee's spinach dip, so I can't compare it.   However, this dip is excellent as written and super easy to make.    The only change I made was to add a bit of salt, which I think brought out the flavors.   I will make this again.   Thank you.

Made this for Christmas Eve get together. I doubled the ingredients and used fresh spinach and put it in a crock pot on high for 3 - 4 hours, stirring occasionally. It was a hit. Everyone loved it. Even my husband who thinks he’s a food critic.

Took this dip to Bunco. Big hit, but definitely not a dieters delight! I followed what some mentioned In reviews and added diced red and green bell peppers for color and crunch. Glad I did. I might also add some finely diced water chestnuts next time. Loved it! Thanks

This was pretty good.  I made it in individual ramekins which went over pretty well.  I just served it with a good bread but I was wishing I had toasted the bread really well or served it with tortilla chips.

Delicious!  I accidentally doubled the mozzarella and it came out fine anyway.   We ate a lot of it with carrot sticks instead of chips, which provided some nice freshness and crunch to balance the indulgent, savory dip.  Will definitely make this again.

Super easy and very delicious! The hardest part of making this dip was the trip to stop n shop to get ingredients.

This turned out great. I chose this recipe because it used the Alfredo sauce in it and I definitely think it made a huge difference. It was so tasty. Serving size of this is huge if you're only making it for a couple of people. You will have plenty of leftovers.
