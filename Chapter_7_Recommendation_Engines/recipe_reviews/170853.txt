This was really delicious after I made a few little changes. Instead of "baking mix", I crushed up Doritos for the base. I covered that with the taco meat and shredded cheese before baking. When it came out of the oven, I spread sour cream over it, then added shredded lettuce, diced spring/garden onions, diced tomatoes, sliced black olives, green chilis, and drizzled taco sauce over it. My family and our friends loved it! It's a recipe that has been filed under "Favorites" in my recipe book!

I would really have to be desperate to make this again.  Prepared exactly as directed using 8" pan.  I assumed the mix would rise up and somewhat encompass the meat.  Nope (if I had looked at picture, I would have seen that).  It doesn't take a genius to figure out baking already cooked taco meat in a 450 oven for 25 minutes results in just one thing.  Dried out, burnt meat.  Dry dry dry.  We're talking Mojave Desert here.  The crust was fine, but what's the point in that if the meat is burnt to a crisp??? Well, not burnt to a crisp, but certainly overcooked to an inedible degree.  Maybe if it had been baked with the cheese on top, it would have protected the meat somewhat, but I'll never know.  Sorry Charlie.

This was really good! A much better alternative to plain old burgers or tacos for dinner. Just used what was on hand and we all loved it.

YUMMY! We really liked this. We LOVE tacos, but this was easier and less mess!
We topped with canned tomatos and chiles, sour cream, and lettuce.

I used this to use up leftover taco meat. It was very tasty and different enough from tacos to make it worth it!

My 10 year old daughter hates tacos but she went to town on this. I also enjoyed this. Thanks for the post.

This was good and tastes just like a taco. We topped it with all our favorite toppings but the kids have more fun filling taco shells so we will stick to that. Thanks anyway. :)
