This recipe is even better if you add 1/2 oz of Cointreau or Triple Sec to kick it up a notch.

I really enjoyed this beverage! I made it on Christmas Eve and of course, Christmas morning for my family and everyone really enjoyed the tart cranberry flavor with the sweet sparkling champagne. TIP: Freeze the cranberries before adding them to your glass to keep the drink even colder! Enjoy!

This cocktail is really delicious and festive. I prepare by first adding about 1/4 cup of cranberry juice then add the champagne and top with a few cranberries.?

I did 1/2 oz. triple sec, 3 oz. cranberry juice cocktail and filled remainder of glass with champagne and bought fresh cranberries and put in bottom of glasses.  A great way to kick off a Holiday gathering!

Great cocktail!  To make it look pretty, drop a single cranberry into the champange flute before pouring in the champagne and cranberry juice.  Adds some color and looks beautiful.

I made these for New Year's Eve and they are very good!  I added a splash of triple sec too.  A maraschino cherry topped off the drink.

Very good, simple recipe for a drink. You can also just buy a pink moscato champagne and add the cranberries and it looks exactly the same without having to add the cranberry juice. Also I bought the regular sized cranberries so I put like 6 and they floated on the top but it did not make it difficult to drink.

4 1/2.  Quick and easy.  Served these for our New Years Eve midnight toast.  We liked the way the tartness of the cranberry juice cut the sweetness of the Champagne.  Poured about 1/4c. juice, filled the rest of the glass with Champagne, and added a few frozen cranberries.

I enjoyed this version, but I made a non-alcoholic version for my son and his friends, by substituting sparkling white grape juice for the champagne. It tasted just as good.

Tastes like cranberry champagne, which is obviously the point, and it was good, but to me there was nothing special about the combination. I wouldn't consider this party-worthy.

I decided to try this, because it sounded like an interesting combo. I used Moscato d' Asti, or a sparkling sweet Italian white wine. For the cranberry juice, I used 100% cranberry juice. I thought it made a pretty color, but I didn't think it did much to change the taste of the wine. I added a little extra which helped some, but then it delutes the pretty color. As this is more colored wine, then a cocktail or wine mixed drink, make sure the people you are serving it to love wine. Some frozen cranberries on the bottom would be very pretty.

Really good! I added 1/2 oz of triple sec and some other recipes call for. I mixed the cranberry juice and triple sec together in a pitcher (I multipled the recipe 10x) then toppped each drink with champagne as it was poured.

I have always made mine with lime vodka and cranberry juice. That is all I drink when we have gatherings with friends. I will have to make this mixture at Christmas for everyone to try. We usually have mimosas while having our family get together.

YUM!  I tried these this past Christmas and loved them.  Brought the idea to my daughter's house and before the day was done, all the ladies were drinking them.  Very festive way to change up the champagne!

This was a nice drink for sitting on our patio in the evening. We assembled it a little differently, filling the champagne flute about 1/4 with cranberry juice and then filling the rest with champagne. It's nice, but I must say that I prefer mimosas.
