OMG, if you have never tried kringle, you HAVE to make this recipe.  My family and my work friends went absolutely crazy for it and are still talking about it to anyone who will listen.  The dough is super simple to make and work with.  It is so flaky, but dense and moist, and not too sweet, it's perfect! What I did was to divide the dough in half and put cherry pie filling in one half and half of the brown sugar/butter/nuts recipe in the other. The only change I would make is that the brown sugar/butter/nuts one had WAY too much butter. I used 1 stick (1/2 cup) and it leaked out everywhere and I ended up pouring at least a 1/4 cup of melted butter off of the pan because the kringle was swimming in it. Gross. When I made it again, I just dotted penny sized butter pieces sparsely over the brown sugar/nuts mixture as it lay in the dough and it worked fine, no problems. So definitely cut the butter down. I also made one where I microwaved frozen peach slices until soft, then mashed them with a potato masher with a little sugar and used that as filling. It was wonderful!!!

I made this for the holidays for gifts and they were super!  Everyone wanted the recipe. The only thing I would like to add is to make sure not to cut all the way up to the filling, Otherwise your filling seeps out while cooking, ask me how i know! !   ; )

If I had rated this recipe before eating the end result, I would have given it only 3 or 4 stars. Try as I may, there was no way I was going to get 3 kringles out of the amount of dough the recipe makes. I ended up with 2 and then the cuts were a little too long or something because a lot of the filling seeped out during baking. However, I transferred them immediatly upon removal from the oven to a clean surface so they wouldn't get stuck to the pan. The end result tastes absolutely awesome and in the end, was worth the trouble I had. I will make these again, doubling the amount of dough and making sure that my cuts aren't too long so the filling doesn't leak out. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe gets 5 stars for tasting good and 5 stars for fun making it. One tip is to use a pizza cutter to make the cuts. It keeps the dough from tearing. Another good tip is to pay attention when the recipe says "heavily floured surface". You will have a lot of trouble with the dough if you are too cheap with the flour. I was able to make 3 just fine but its so much easier to work with when its cold so you have to roll fast. I made one with apricot preserves and cream cheese, cooked apples and cream cheese, and vanilla custard with chocolate drizzle. All three were delish.

This is a great recipe! I was so happy to find it as it reminds me of my childhood. The dough works up very nice as long as you keep it cold.  I doubled the recipe and it worked fine.  I also used canned pie filling for the filling and it worked great.  Thank You for this recipe!

I'm a star with my family for finding this recipe! At every Schmidt (my maiden name) family reunion I go to, there's always someone saying how they wish they could make kringle, it's their favorite, and on and on. My granddad grew up in Wisconsin near a bakery, and he got to have fresh kringle on a regular basis. I'm making him this for Christmas, and can't wait to see if it's just as good as he remembers it. Thanks for sharing, Colleen! More comments coming later...

I was afraid that the dough wasn't going to work but it turned out really buttery and flaky. I filled my Kringle with strawberries and  sprinkled with raw sugar and egg white before baking. My entire family loved it.

I made this for Easter dessert and it came out great and none was left for me to take home!  All I did was make the dough as directed, divided it in 2, filled each with a 1/2 can cherry pie filling and baked as directed.  I'm from Wisconsin and this is very close to the Kringle I remember.  It was so easy that I will definitely make in the future!  I didn't have too much trouble with it dripping onto the pan.  It was fine.  Thanks for this tasty recipe

This was amazing!  I made a cream cheese mixture of 8 oz cream cheese 1/2 cup sugar and an egg.  I made one with the mixture and jell, the second cream cheese mixture, strawberry jell, and chocolate, the third cream cheese, chocolate, caramel and chopped pecans.  Simply amazing.  Have fun with the filling.

For taste alone, i would give this 5 stars.  I used my food processor for the dough,(very cold butter cut into cubes and flour pulse until it looks like coarse crumbs, then add sour cream & pulse just til it pulls together)My filling leaked out the sides too. I think in the braiding you need to fold up some of the bottom to make a side.  I will make this again and maybe just fold over the top and make a traditional  oval for my mom who is from Wisconsin, I know she will love it

Super delicious! After trying a few fillings, I've decided that I like fruit preserves the best. Putting a bit of vanilla extract into the glaze also gives it extra flavor. I very easily got three kringles out of this recipe. Also, I used the dough recipe for pot pie crusts - Yum! :)

Excellant recipe, I was able to get three Kringles out of the recipe, next time I will put it in the refrigerator more like a log than a ball.  Would make it easier to cut in thirds.  I should have reread Wendy's suggestion of just dotting the butter, only used 1 stick 1/2 cup and had burnt butter all over.  Thankfully I had used parchment paper, sprayed pan lightly with vegetable spray, laid down the paper and sprayed the top with more vegetable spray.  Clean up was a breaze.  Made two with the brown sugar, butter & walnuts and the third one I dotted cream cheese and strawberry pie filling, both were good. Thank you for the recipe.

I have the students in my culinary school make this recipe all the time. We usually sell this for a fundraiser during the holidays and it is always a big hit! It is a simple reicpe and we always get three pieces out of it. I have found that it is hard to tranfer to the pan so we use 2 large spatulas at either end and this keeps us from having too many casualties!
Hope you enjoy it,
Chef Dave

A great kringle.... I am excited to try different fillings with it but the walnut brown sugar one was definately really good.... the flacky crust really makes this recipe great... I made 1/3 of the recipe to just make one kringle... turned out well.. the dough works well when it is cold... next time I will try rolling it out on floured parchment paper for easier transfer to the baking sheet... also make sure the cuts aren't too long or you will lose the filling... follow these pointers and you will get a GREAT Kringle

We are huge fans of O & H Kringles and instead of ordering online, mom and I spend a large amount of time researching and this recipe is it! Except if you are doing fruit or pie filling, don't use all that butter with the brown sugar! I added a couple of little dots of butter on an apple one with lightly cinnamon and brown sugar. But certainly not another cup! Made a cream cheese filling of cream cheese, 2 egg yokes and vanilla and sweetened with Spenda...Super good with Blueberry and or raspberry....even great with JUST cheese filling!  5 stars! Will be our new holiday tradition! The dough is incredible if prepared to recipe. Thanks so much for this great recipe! A lot of work but so yummy

I made this for the first time this Christmas (for brunch) because my husband's family is from Wisconsin (near Racine, where Kringle is very popular).  My husband was leery of me trying this recipe for the FIRST time on such a big holiday, but I gave it a shot, and it turned out wonderful, a very flaky pastry.  I used almond paste (instead of the walnut filling in the recipe) to keep it easy, as well as cherry pie filling (I doubled the recipe, with so many people in the house).  I had made a braid before, though, so I knew how to make the pattern, my sister-in-law and mother-in-law asked for the recipe, said they'll definitely be making this for special occasions as well!

Oh my! this is awesome, looks and tastes like it was from a fancy bakery but quite easy to make at home. I made 1 big kringle, filled it with 8 oz cream cheese mixed with 1 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. Then I spread 1 can of Solo Apricot filling over top the cream cheese. Baked for 45 minutes on parchment paper, no mess or oozing, make sure your filling is thick or it will be a mess. Brushed top with a vanilla glaze and sprinkled with coarse sugar.  Can't wait to try other fillings, thanks for the recipe!
12/12/2011 I made an apple filling, sliced 1 apple thinly, placed in a line down the middle, boiled my homemade apple pie filling and added 1 tbsp of flour to thicken, placed that on  top of the sliced apple, proceeded as above, trial run for my orders, smelled fantastic!
10 batches made 15 Kringles, weigh 20 ounces each for dough. Bake a lit longer, 50 minutes, turning halfway through. Add 1 tbsp of sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to each batch.

I made this into individual danishes and filled half of them with a cream cheese filling and the other half with homemade strawberry pie filling. They are amazing! The recipe made 8 large and 4 small danish rounds.

My daughter and I made this for her dad's birthday.  We only got two kringles out of the dough.  I think it would have been too difficult to work with if we had tried for three.  We made one as directed and filled the other with apple pie filling.  They were both delicious.  There was some oozing of the filling, but we just removed them from the baking sheet right away and they looked great.  Great recipe.

This is delicious! I've been wanting to make this for a long time. After a messy first round and following other reviews, this is what I did. Using food processor, pulsed the butter & flour together until it looked like crumbs. Than I added in sour cream plus 2 tsp almond extract. Chilled dough overnight. Rolled dough (made 3 braids) out onto floured parchment. Rolled it thin. Used pizza cutter to make slits, just short ones. When braiding, the slits are only on top and the sides are solid, so the filling does not ooze out. Brushed with egg white and sprinkled Swedish pearl sugar on top (in place of icing glaze), then bake. Used canned pie fillings, apricot, cherry, black raspberry. One can fills 2 braids. Family loved this, making a bunch for xmas and freezing.

Love the recipe!  It was very easy to make and the dough rolled out so nicely!  I made different fillings for each:  one with a combination of cream cheese filling, raspberry pie filling and chocolate chips, one with cream cheese filling and raspberry, and one with poppy seed filling.  Everyone loved it!

Cream cheese filling:  1 8oz brick of cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 egg.

Very good stuff! I made three kinds: the original recipe, one with raspberry filling atop a cream cheese mixture (with powdered sugar and 1/8 tsp. of almond extract), as well as one with just strawberry filling. I doubled the recipe to make double of each of these flavors [the raspberry one was also topped in slivered almonds], and I shaped two raspberry danishes into a giant wreath by using a round pizza pan to bake them. All but the strawberry ones look lovely, because the strawberry ran like crazy but tasted delicious anyway. The pastry reminds me of kolachies, although not so sweet since they are rolled out in flour instead of powdered sugar. The dough would also probably be a pretty easy pie crust to make.

LOVE this recipe.  However, can I make them ahead of time and freeze them?  I am thinking making them (10 of them) during the week of Christmas & defrosting them and giving them as gifts.  Any input would be appreciated.

I made this recipe as written. It is fabulous. The crust is sooo flakey. I also made it with cherry filling. I gave some away for xmas and everyone loved it. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I've made this 50 + times won 3rd place ribbon with it! Tried something new today! I did the fold and turn, roll, chill croissant method with dough and got more  flakey layers 3 turns!!Extra Tips! Dont overwork dough! If you've made a pie crust its the same concept. Once you add sour cream work fast just until just mixed - Not too much! This way you will get a flaky croissant like pastry!! If you "over mix" it will not be as flaky and puffy!! Tip!! After rolling -before filling and cutting- place on cookie sheet first-Then fill and cut so you dont have to move it filled. Easy!! First time I made it was Christmas morning I made mixed berry filling. I'm making one now with peach apricot filling . However both times I just made one big one - fits on a cookie sheet NP! Bake a little longer. If you made 3 they would be small. One large one is great for family brunch. I also used almond paste crumb topping yum!

This came out great! I struggled with the dough as it was too much for my 8 cup food processor. Next time I will just use my kitchen aid. I did only get 2 but could have gotten 3 if I wanted them smaller but it was not worth the time for me. I made one filled with apples and the other with Cream cheese and strawberry jam. Both were good but we liked the apple one better.

It takes some time (it is not hard), but it's worth it! Served this to guests along with the Swedish Kringle on this site. Both were very good, but they only shared the Kringle name--very different pastries. The guests gave the Dane's the biggest thumbs up! I went with the Swed's...

Always well received.  Flakey and light, like a bakery danish.  Reminds me a bit of puff pastry. Not at all difficult to make.  I make small ones and make them different flavors.  This morning I made the full recipe and made it into 8 small pastries. They are still warm from the oven and the house smells delicious.  When the family wakes up, they will disappear instantly.  Make sure the dough is chilled and keep the counter lightly floured and you will not have a problem. I make the dough the day before and then it is ready for fresh pastries and a great smelling house in the morning. I have rolled out the dough and cut into rectangles and frozen it to use at a later date.  Works great!

My expectations were too high.  Don't get me wrong, it's good ... but it's basically pie in a different shape.  We wanted an apple version so I cored, peeled and sliced 4 Granny Smith apples, tossed in a little butter, cinnamon and brown sugar and cooked until the apples were tender.  If you do this you MUST wait until the apples have cooled before putting on the pastry or you'll get a gooey mess.

Soooo good. I initially rolled in (a lot) of flour right on my counter, but could not have possibly moved it to my baking sheet, so I rolled it (and then baked it) right on my silicone baking mat.  I only had a little cherry filling leak, but there was no burning, again thanks to the siclione.  Drizzled with cream cheese frosting and this was the first to go at our ladies brunch!  Can't wait to make again tomorrow for my family!

Easy to make to dough! Don't cut into the rolled out dough too far! Just cut a third of the way on each side.  I used slivered almonds in the filling instead of walnuts to make a "Bear Claw" pastry.  It turned out fine! Try it.  You'll be happy that you did! Just save some almonds to sprinkle on top!

Have to admit I put cherry pie filling in this, but even then the pastry deserves 5 stars alone. I had so much fun making it. Next time I will try the called-for filling, I'm sure that would be wonderful and probably about a dozen other fillings would be too.

This was excellent!  I have to admit I was a little scared with all the cuts and the braid like fashion- but it was really easy!  I made two kringles out of the dough instead of three.  Some of my filling seeped out, but it was fine! I put small dollops of almond paste with the filling and it was awesome.  My husband is addicted to kringles and the nearest bakery that makes them is an hour away and the catalog order kringles always taste freezer burn to me- so this was a winner!

What a good recipe - and so easy - for any time of year!  Made the dough last night; shaped and baked it this morning.  I used cherry pie filling instead of the mixture posted - delicious.  Will try apple filling next time.  As I had only 2/3c. sour cream, I made up the 1c. with some cottage cheese which I beat until smooth.  I can't see that it made any difference at all.  We had one of the 3 pieces for brunch; froze the other 2.  I think I'll halve the recipe next time - unless it freezes really well, or I have lots of company, I don't see the point in making up 3 pieces at one time.  The beauty of a Danish is when it's fresh.  And I didn't bother with any walnuts.

Not what I expected at all.  I had high hopes for this recipe.  I am an experienced baker and have come across much better recipes.  This one was difficult to work with.  The filling oozed out and burnt on the pan while baking.  The dough was not easy to manipulate.  Definitely not enough dough for three braids as I had a hard enough time making two out of the dough.  Will not make again.

Ever since I moved away from my hometown in Wisconsin, I've been just dying for a taste of proper Kringle and this recipe delivered everything I've been hankering after. I made this on a lark to surprise Hubby for breakfast a few days ago and it was just fantastic! The Kringle was delish fresh out of the oven, but even better hours after it cooled. The crust fell apart on me a bit before I tossed it in the oven, but turned out flakey and superb anyway (be sure to cut your butter in VERY well! I got lazy!) and during the baking process I fretted a bit about how messy it looked with filling seeping out everywhere but OMG, I so didn't have to worry!

The only thing I think I'll change next time is adding a teensy bit of vanilla and sugar to the pastry mixture before tossing it in the fridge.

So good!  I made one kringle today, and it's already gone.  I didn't have any sour cream for the dough, so I substituted a mixture of vanilla yogurt and baking soda (1 cup yogurt, 1 tsp baking soda) and it worked just fine.  I would say to use your judgment on the filling.  I added brown sugar until I was satisfied, and only used a tiny bit of butter, and still had some leak out.

This was absolutely delicious!  My family obsesses over kringle so we were all really excited to try this.  We were not disappointed.  I decreased the butter a little per other reviews and it came out perfect!  Surprisingly not difficult to make.  You just need to plan ahead since the dough needs to refrigerate overnight.

The Kringle turned out get for the first time making it, It did have a little over flow but that was just a learning experience.  instead of the brown sugar filling I used raspberry preserves and instead of using water with the powdered sugar I used milk.  Deffinately looking forward to trying different filling combinations

great flaky crust, I filled with Saskatoon pie filling and they turned out very tasty. I would like to try to make disks next time, bake then fill after the dough is cooked. I think the pastry would be firmer and the outside edges were the favourite with the family so circles would provide more pastry crunch. Great  recipe thanks for sharing

Turned out great! Followed all the directions and a couple reviews with no problem. Cooled dough for full 8 hours. I halved the recipe and was still able to make 2 danish, probably enough to feed 4. Made a blueberry filling by boiling blueberries, water and sugar and one with cream cheese, brown sugar and cinnamon. Definitely a keeper! Thanks.

These were a hit with my family!  We had a get together and I made three... one with almond filling, another with cream cheese and raspberry filling and the last with apple pie filling.  They were devoured and I had many requests for the recipe!  Will definately make this again!

Very yummy and fairly easy. Looks like it came from a fancy bakery. I made the exact recipe and the filling did seep everywhere even when I left plenty of space. I think it might be the amount of butter in the filling. I'm going to try a different filling next time. Thanks for the recipe.

What can I possibly say other than WOW?! This was absolutely amazing! Tasted exactly like the Kringle I used to get the bakery next to my grandmother's house in Texas! I too, like several other reviewers, wasn't able to get 3 kringles out of the dough, only two, which is fine by me. I used a peach pie filling in both of mine, but cut out more than half of the syrup and added small chunks of cream cheese and they turned out AMAZING. My younger brother, who never really eats any kind of pastries or anything sweet, ate half of one within five minutes of them coming out of the oven. I really wish I could try it with the intended filling, but my boyfriend is allergic to nuts and I don't want to risk even having them in the house. But seriously, this is an amazing recipe! Thank you so much for sharing! Definately will make again!

My goodness!  I can't believe that I haven't rated this recipe yet!  This is EXCELLENT, FANTASTIC, SUPERB, SO EASY, and best of all FOOL PROOF!  I make this with canned (or fresh) pie filling.  I roll the ends and back edge to keep the filling in and only make strips with one side, criss-crossing them as I go.  It is so close to puff pastry but without all the turns and work.  What more can I say except, DELICIOUS!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't know what a kringle is but this was a delicous danish.  The dough was easy to work with and I had no problems with the filling leaking.  I doubled the recipe and got 3 large pieces.  I used apple and cherry pie filling.  The finished product was beautiful and looked a like a lot more work then it actually was.

It tasted good, but my husband said it reminded him more of a strudel than a kringle.  Had enough dough to make 2: a walnut and one with apple pie filling.  The walnut reminded me of baclava and we enjoyed the apple pie filling more, both were a sweet treat.

I made this for my husband for Father's Day using 1/2 cup apricot preserves for each section, plus sprinkling the walnut topping on each - YUMMY.

I'm adding this recipe to my recipe book!  My 15 year old son wanted to make Danish Pastry for extra credit for school  and we chose this recipe.  We each made our own batch of doughs.    I wanted to get one made before he attempted his to help give guidance mainly with rolling it out, as he's easily frustrated, rushes, etc...he's 15!  Anyway, although you do roll the dough quite thin, and yes, it will make three, if you keep your surface and the dough well floured as instructed,  it is an easier dough to work with than anticipated. Because you're using the flour generously it loses it's sticky, greasy texture and becomes more elastic.  We used two fillings, I used the butter, walnut brown sugar from this recipe.  Delicious!!!     The filling did run, ooze out each time,  once because the slits in the braid were too low, the second time,  although I made sure the dough came up higher on the sides before the slits in the braid, there was still some oozing, be  sure to use a rimmed baking pan.  However , the pastry was not ruined because of this.  When removed from the oven, I used a spatula to scrape the liquid/carmelized stuff away from the sides of the pastry,  I also slid the pastry a bit, carefully to be sure it wasn't stuck, then  let it cool an appropriate amount of time before transferring to another surface.   Who would make baklava when you could make this!?!   We also used the sweetened cream cheese filling from the recipe, "Easy Cream Cheese Pastry"  from this site,

I have never had a Kringle, but I was craving my cream cheese and lemon curd danish and didn't want to have to go through the work of making a danish dough. I'm not sure what I expected, but this was a delicious surprise! It is very similar to a pie crust dough. Just as flaky, but more tender. And it is so simple to throw together. I used half the dough for my big lemon & cheese danish, but I could also see using an apple and sugar/cinnamon filling. The sky is the limit with this dough. If you are wondering about a cream cheese filling, I use an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, 1/2 C sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and 3 Tb flour. I spread that over the center of the rolled out dough and top with lemon curd (homemade or store bought) fold it up like the directions say and I baked it for 35 min at 375 degrees.  For the dough, I followed the recipe exactly-oh wait... I used light sour cream because that's what I had and it worked! And it's funny because while I was making it, I kept thinking, no salt? no sugar? no baking powder? Like I said, I had no idea what a Kringle was. So thanks Colleen, this is a winner!

Overall this is the easiest and best cherry cream cheese Danish I have found. I cut the recipe size down to 1/3 to make a single Danish and it was still good. I want to experiment with spreading the cream cheese and putting the cherry on top vs little piles of cream cheese next to little piles of cherry. I don't yet know which way would be better. This is a great base recipe to start with though and so night that you make the dough the night before. I even mixed up the filling and the sugar drizzle the night before too. Make the morning less stressful.

This pastry recipe worked out really well. It was easy to work with, and so crisp and flakey once baked. Delicious!  I used a different filling and divided the dough in half to make two pastries.  Thanks for sharing this, I will definately make this again.  So easy!

Use less butter.  I made 2 with brown sugar and walnuts and one with cherry pie filling and cream cheese with almond flavored drizzle.  Served at Easter brunch and everyone liked them!

This recipe is a big hit with my family, though I haven't tried it with the nut filling.  I usually make it with apples or raspberry with a cheese filling.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve and dessert on Christmas Day - family and friends took slices home for the next day's breakfast.  Just fabulous and easy.  You can fill it with anything you want and the taste is always different.  Also, it freezes very well for two months or so.

This kringle is amazing.  I have made with both homemade raspberry jam & the  nut mixture.  We loved both.  I used parchment paper for rolling and it worked well. I also baked it on the parchment paper for easy clean up.

It took a few tries to get the braiding just right, but once I did, wow. What an impressive-looking and -tasting treat. Definitely heed the advice about using a HEAVILY floured surface, and to have the sough yield enough for three kringles, roll it very thin. Thanks for sharing this.

Very good. Originally gave it 5 stars but as I went back I couldn't get over the fact that the dough needed something.  Don't get me wrong it was good just missing something.  Not sure if it needed sugar, vanilla extract.  Just needed something. First day I just made one of the three danishes.  Did it with walnuts:Used 2 TBS softened butter, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and about 1/2 cup walnuts (sorry didn't measure the nuts just eyed it).  Also added a few sprinkles of cinammon. Next day I did one with almond paste and one with cream cheese.  Both fillings were very good and dough was good but still missing something.  Fresh out of the oven tastes best.  Next day looses it's crispness.  Will make again and play wiht the dough as it was very easy to make.

i gave it two stars because i like the taste or else it would have been one star.
this danish tasted good only because i added vanilla and sugar. i didnt like the dough, it became hard after baking it.  it is not a danish dough to me. some parts in it was still mushy.

First of all I cut the recipe in half, and second I only kept it in the frig for abt 2 hours. OMG! the dough became so not manageable.  I am lucky to have placed it on a marble board when it happened. I put it back in the frig for another hour. I was then able to scrape it up with a spatula. Lesson learned.  It still came out wonderful! The glaze, in my opinion, makes or breaks it.  Also, the next time I make it, I am going to place the marble board in the frig as well for a couple hours to chill.  It saved my kringle this time! (Also, since I'm so impatient, I can roll out the dough in less time again :-)  )  I was able to make 2 different kringles when I made only half the recipe.  It is a lot of fun, take the chance and make some. I made cream cheese for the filling since my hubby is a diabetic, didnt want to shock him.....yet.

i was only able to make two danish from this recipe. both times i had to almost double the cooking time to make sure the dough was cooked through - possibly a consequence of having a thicker crust. it's flaky and delicious. i filled with apples and cream cheese.

This recipe was amazing! The dough was soft,  flakey and versatile. I made three diffrent kinds of filling, cinnamon roll, cream cheese with blueberries and apple pie. By far the apple pie was the BEST! I also used half sour cream and half cream cheese in the dough, and it worked very well. Use your imagination and im sure this recipe would hold up to it well.

I thought this recipe was very good for homemade danish. It is very rich, especially if you fill it with pie fillings. I made it just as the recipe instructed, and then I experimented with other fillings. Next time, I will try fruit sprinkled with a tiny bit of sugar for sweetness. I think it will complement the pastry well.

So easy to make, and better than any store-bought I have ever had!  For one, I made an apricot filling.  None of the filling leaked out.  For the other I just spread apple jelly down the middle.  The apple jelly one seeped all over when I baked it, but it still tasted great!  Everyone raved, will definitely make again!

This dough is as close as you'll get to puff pastry/danish dough without all the work that goes into those.  It really does need the full 8hrs, i tried to work with it at 7 1/2 and it was still gooey.  
     I made one with nuts(pecans), and one with cream cheese(sweetened) and blackberry jam.  The blackberry jam one leaked alot.  It can't handle alot of moisture.  Next time i want to use apple pie filling, but i'll definitely fish out the apple chunks w/ a fork so there isn't too much saucy-ness to leak out.  
     I also folded it more like a burrito, then made slits on top w/ a knife.

Incredibly outrageously sweet!   I think next time I will try it with the cherry or apple filling instead of the brown sugar filling because it creates a syrupy buttery soup around the kringles and it's quite messy and impossible to contain inside the dough (unless maybe you use a lot less of the filling than it asks for).  Great with a glass of cold milk to keep the sweetness down.

I made these in a smaller version for Christmas and everyone raved about them. I used apple jelly (tinted green) and raspberry jam for filling. Looked wonderful and tasted even better.

My family and co-workers just loved this recipe!  They cannot wait for me to make it again.  The filling did ooze out while baking, but it did not ruin the kringle, just check on it while its baking to make sure the filling doesn't spill on the oven.

This was good, but the filling oozed out of the dough and burned on the cookie sheet by the time the dough was done.

This tastes pretty good, but it is by far the most frustrating recipe I have ever made in my life. The taste is not worth the extreme hassle of this 'dough' melting and becoming unworkable within minutes as you try to shape and fold it. Maybe try to make it in the winter?

I made this for my Danish husband for Christmas. I made one with the brown sugar mixture and used blueberry pie filling for the other two. The blueberry ones were fantastic. The brown sugar one was okay. We don't typically eat a lot of sugar, so chewing away on something so grainy was strange. The crust was fantastic, though. I was a little nervous that it wouldn't turn into the sticky dough it was supposed to, so I kneaded it with my hands. The heat from my hands melted the butter and it finally came together. We'll make this again (pie filling only) for sure.

I did change a couple of things from the recipe: On half of the dough, I used cherry filling (premixed from a can) and on the 2nd half, I used the walnut mixture from povitica (a Serbian nut roll) consisting of honey, walnuts, brown sugar and cinnamon. My mother was Serbian and I think this filling is far superior to other walnut fillings I have tasted. I did butter the dough before placing the povitica filling but used only a fraction of the butter, maybe two tablespoons. The kringle was exceptionally good and will become a standard bread in this household for breakfast.

This was so tasty! I made my own peach preserve for the filling. The only thing was it only made 2 kringles. The first one didn't come out so pretty or professional looking and had peach filling oozing out every which way... but it was soooo good! So for the next one I fixed the design flaws and crisscross it better.

This was unbelievably delicious and so flaky.  Following the directions with preparing the dough the day before baking is what creates that flaky crust. If you don't have the time, you should move to another recipe. This makes 3 kringles and we made two with homemade strawberry filling and one with apricot.  I cannot express enough how much people loved these on Easter morning.  Such a big hit.  I will be making twice the number for this year's holiday.  So wonderful!  Thank you for the recipe!

This dough is amazing! I used half the first time and made the second half days later, it was still tender and pliable. The filling only needs a few tablespoons of butter, as the butter in the dough helps to meld with the brown sugar while baking.

This was a pretty simple recipe to make. The only changes that I made were to the filling, a cup of butter is way too much. I would use at least a half of a cup or less. 
I would definitely make this again.

Super flaky, relatively easy, and a Christmas must! I make this with Bing Crosby in the background! If you have almonds, make your own almond paste, lots of good recipes for the paste are out there. I've used pie fillings, but they spread and make a mess and tend to make the crust soggy. They're a nice alternative, but the filling given is my favorite. Also, it's never as flaky as the day you bake it, unless you reheat it in the microwave or oven. This may be my all-time favorite recipe. It makes you feel like a cooking pro when you're done!

While this is not the yeast version of Kringle, it is amazing! I used food processor and pulsed the cubed butter with the sifted flour till pea sizes pieces. Then pulsed in the sour cream. I didn’t really have a “sticky” dough, more like large clumps which I gathered into a ball, wrapped and refrigerated overnight. A SUPER easy and SUPER fast job.
Next morning, divided in half ( really didn’t have enough for three) and rolled each one on a heavily floured work space. Followed directions for cutting and folding but used canned pie filling. And to be honest, I wasn’t  going to put much effort or expense into these if they were going to be a flop. 
I. Then stuck them in the freezer while oven preheated. Baking time was a good 40 minutes in my oven.
I did NOT have a problem with butter oozing out. These puffed beautifully, lots of flaky layers. Totally impressive and really easy. I will absolutely make them again, and keep using food processor because that makes them really effortless. And I will try different fillings for variety. The biggest trick here is to keep the dough COLD. Never hesitate to stop and stick in the freezer for a few minutes  if it starts getting too warm.

I made this recipe as directed. After refrigerating they dough overnight, it did not make enough to make the picture shown (after cutting the dough in 1/2). After I rolled out 1/2 the dough, mine was much, much smaller. I baked it on an air pan and the butter ran off the pan in every direction...what a mess!!
I made one apple and one with almond past and crumbled toasted almonds on top.
I would use a pan with a lip in the future.

Awesome recipe!  So grateful for the share Ms. Royal.  Didn't make any changes to the dough recipe, just divided the dough in half instead of thirds, due to laziness.  
For the filling, I just made what I liked.   I made a cream cheese filling, added raspberry preserves on top of that and then some fresh raspberry's across that.  Turned out great. 
The other one I prepared the dough as directed and put some melted butter  on the dough, brown sugar, cinnamon, and pecans on top in that order.  Worked fine.
I know some said there was too much butter in the recipe as written (Is there ever a thing as too much butter? Lol)  I melted about 4 Tablespoons and applied the butter until nicely coated, what was leftover I drizzled across both Kringle's before baking.  
I used the amount of powdered sugar as suggested, but put about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to flavor it up a bit because I like the almond flavor.  Vanilla would work well too.   This recipe is a keeper!

Amazing! I don't like the Racine Kringle...no wonder! This traditional Danish version is nothing like it. It's buttery, the right balance of flaky and chewy, and isn't too sweet! The caramel flavor is amazing. I sub pecans for the walnuts and make half the filling (otherwise it just falls out everywhere when you bake it). Highly recommend.

Would absolutely make it again.  My daughter lived in Racine Wi for a while and we ate many a Kringle from there.  These are almost the same and incredibly easy to make.  The only different thing I did was when making the pastry I used very cold butter cut into the flour in my food processor.  Very easy.  The filling was very good also.

The dough was wonderful and flaky. Against my better judgment though, I added all the butter and brown sugar to the filling. It was too sweet and unfortunately oozed out all over my baking sheets burning and smoking up my kitchen real bad. I had to act fast and get them off the pans before they stuck. Otherwise, this would have been wonderful.

I made one batch of dough and followed recipe exactly, but baked the 3 dough batches with different fillings.
1. First try was a total disaster.  I rolled to 12 x 17 and filled with the brown sugar nut according to recipe.  The dough  fell apart before I got it to my baking sheet.  Then, as it baked all the filling turned to liquid, spilled out and burned.  Thankfully, I put the danish on foil and made edges or it would have been a real mess.  Could not ear this and wasted a lot of nuts.  2.  Second try, i used a cream cheese filling and did not roll to 12 x 17.  This stayed together better and i was able to get it to the baking pan without it falling apart.  As it baked, the butter started oozing from the dough.  The final product was ok, but I agree, there is too much butter in the dough and the brown sugar filling.

Couldn’t believe how easy!  Delicious! I’ve been eating the O&H Kringles my whole life shopped across the country for holidays and occasions. Mine was equally delicious, much prettier (and that was my sloppy first!) with a flakier crust. my simple raspberry filling (1 1/2 C frozen berries + 1/3 C sugar + 1/4 tsp almond + 1 Tblsp dark brown sugar thickened with a tsp of cornstarch on the stovetop) was perfect to fill 1 large pastry. My second pastry is baking now... filled with pecans this time.

This recipe was a hit!! I made this as a Christmas gift for my dad who grew up in Racine, WI where kringles are famous. I made one with pecans and one with cherry cheesecake filling. The pecan was the bigger hit. Make sure you seal the ends really well to avoid the butter/sugar mix leaking everywhere. Butter did seep out all over my pan, I was really worried but it didn’t matter. Used two spatulas to transfer baked kringles to wax paper to cool and cleaned up the pan immediately- no problem. My parents were “wow’d”- it’s a keeper!

It was fairly easy to make. I followed another reviewer’s instructions to form a cylinder with the dough as opposed to a roundball,  to make it easier to cut in equal parts. It turned out very easy to divide. I also added apricot marmalade to the filling of sugar and almonds, and it was to die for.

I found this recipe years ago here on  allrecipes and make it every year for Christmas. It gets RAVE reviews from everyone! It is wonderful, I fill with cinnamon and walnuts. Delicious.
Kinda difficult to make as the dough is rather sticky and must be chilled.....It's so well worth the effort though!
Thank you for sharing this delicious kringle recipe!

I have no clue why the rating is as high as it is.  This did not work out well at all.  The filling melted out of the braid, filling the tray and saturating the dough.  I should have booked the dough but didn't bother because of the ratings but I'm not sure that would have helped.  I ended up tossing it.

This is truly amazing! It tastes like I bought it at a bakery! Easy and fun!!! Instead if the filling on this recipe, I did a cream cheese mixture and raspberry, wonderful! Oh! And I added and egg wash, with sliced almonds, and raw sugar before I baked it, so pretty!!!

I made the recipe as written. Only additions: added apple slices to one loaf, pumpkin puree to another, and pecans instead of walnuts to the third.  They were delicious!!!!  I made my cuts too deep so the butter and brown sugar oozed out into my baking dish.  It ended making caramel. I basted the excess caramel onto the bread while it was still hot. I didn't need the extra glaze.  My husband loved it too.  I would definitely make again and test out more fillings.

It smells good cooking but...  HELP!! All
Of the filling is spilling out in the pan and it looks like a brown sugar and butter pool with some wet dough cooking in the middle of it. What did I do wrong?! ?? Update: the goo that cooked out tastes like walnut pralines after it cooled :)

This was AMAZING!!! Even my picky 87 year old momma loved it!!! I made 2 larger ones instead of 3. I filled one with poppyseed filling and the other with half the recipe for the brown sugar. I did as one person suggested, and instead of mixing butter in with the brown sugar, i dotted some butter on top of the brown sugar. I will DEFINITELY make this again!!

This is sooooo good!  My family couldn't get enough.  They even said it was better than store-bought.  I could not get three out of the recipe, but I did get two.  I used a cherry cream cheese filling in one and the almond and brown sugar in the other.  I would definitely recommend using half the butter for the brown sugar filling.

I made 1/2 the recipe intending on just making 1 bigger piece. Way too many issues with this one. The "dough" is impossible to work with. With all the butter it literally melted in the oven. HUGE mess!!! Sorry, but a big no on this one for me.

Excellent recipe. I did use only half the butter in filling as another person suggested and it was plenty. Very flaky and very tasty. Will definitely keep this recipe to make again!

\Wonderful!  Don't let this recipe go by without making it! Light and sweet without being too heavy.  Great for a weekend breakfast or even on Christmas day.

This was so delicious and crispy, flaky!
I made the dough as directed and wrapped it in Press 'n Seal
and put it in the fridge overnite.  It made 2 small kringles;
to make the one in the photo I would have had to use all
the dough for one.  I warmed the dough in my hands to make
it more rollable and rolled it out on a WELL floured silipat sheet.
Since there were comments about the filling leaking, I used
SOLO pastry fruit filling (raspberry) down the center and then
cut the strips to overlap on both sides.  Followed the icing
recipe, after cooling, drizzled it on and then sprinkled it with 
pecans, followed by another drizzling of icing.
My kringles were cooked at 350 for 30 minutes on a cookie sheet with a silipat sheet, instead of greasing the cookie sheet.

This is the easiest and very delicious recipe.  I made the brown sugar mixture filling, and I used pie filling in one of the 3 kringles.  All 3 kringles were gobbled up within a couple of days by our family of 4!  My husband asked how I made the dough.  After telling him it's a secret, he said " I know.  You folded it over and over again!"  Little does he know, all I did was mix flour, water, and sour cream and stick it in the refrigerator over night.  I highly recommend this recipe.  One of my daughters was quite disappointed when she woke up and the kringle was gone.

Buttery, nutty, and sinfully good! Better run an extra half marathon before you make this one!

I’m really only rating the dough here, since I went rogue and made a cream cheese and berry filling.  I let the dough sit in the fridge overnight and made 1 Kringle using about 2/3 of the recipe.  Everyone loved it and I will be using this s dough again and again.  It was very easy to make and work with. Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely need to let the dough chill over night or you will just make life hard on yourself. I tend to use fruits instead of the traditional walnut filling and have amazing results.

I would say that it turned out, but my dough was heavy.  I asked my son to pick up the sour cream and he chose low fat, which I don't think works.  As well the butter was way too much and my cuts were too low/high and the filling seeped out and sort of burned.  Maybe next time it will be better.  After asking my mom who is Danish, she does not think that this is a real Danish recipe.. but maybe she does not know (she's 83!).. :)

This is a review on just the dough. This is perfect!! Dont change a thing! I use it for cheese danish. Just divine.Also if using for a cheese danish when it comes out of the oven brush danish with a thin glaze of milk and powdered sugar to make it shine. Then drizzle with a thick glaze of milk, powdered sugar and vanilla.

My husband loves this recipe. The company his family used to order them out of Milwaukee was sold and the Kringles were never the same. When I make then I stuff them with fruit butters as I cannot eat nuts. Yummers!
