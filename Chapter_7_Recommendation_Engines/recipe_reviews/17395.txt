Nice and light dessert . Although I used the ingredients for this recipe I did make modifications for prep, serving size and refrigeration time. I halved recipe, used a standard sized loaf pan. Using kitchen shears, I did cut some of the graham crackers to fit the pan. I dipped the graham crackers into milk before placing in the pan to soften up slightly. I did not put the chocolate on the dessert until after it set up. Instead of refrigerating for 4-24 hours, I froze for 2 hours. Drizzled chocolate sauce upon serving.  I used french vanilla pudding, next time I will use cheesecake flavor.  I think I will also add a cooled layer of chocolate upon the second graham cracker layer, then refrigerate until firm, then add the next layer of pudding and top layer of graham cracker.

Maybe it's me but this seemed like a lot of cool whip. Don't get me wrong, it was tasy, but my mouth felt way too full of cool whip. I think that 8 oz would have suited better. Thank you :)

This has long been a family favorite at our house.  Super easy to make the taste is very similar to an eclair.  Of note, letting the cake sit over night is a must.  The cake is so much better when the crackers get soggy and mushy.

This was very easy to make.  The hard party was waiting the 12 hours to eat it.  Everyone loved it and even went back for seconds.  The best part was I made it lowfat.  I used low fat graham crackers, fat free milk, and light cool whip.  Next time, I'll try using sugarfree pudding.

The only thing that could make this recipe better would be to lessen the calories.
I tried using Jello Sugar Free Pudding and Sugar Free Cool Whip.  Because of the frosting, it didn't taste any different and my family didn't even notice. :-)

I love this recipe.  It taste sooo good and easy enough that my children can help me make it.  A little tip...I warm my tub of prepared frosting in the microwave for 20 seconds, stir, then spread.  It speads much easier. Then chill

You can uses all fat free/sugar free products and still tastes GREAT! I used a homemade frosting. I had all the ingedients and am not crazy about tub frosting.  PERFECT! 15 servings =WW 4pts if you use all FF~SF ingredients. Frosting included. Layers should be grahams~1/2 of the pudding~grahams~rest of the pudding~top w/grahams. I flipped top layer over so a THIN layer of pudding would be on very top~you'll need to even out the pudding on top with a butter knife. Do this before frosting with chocolate. This helps to soften grahams. ENJOY. IT's GREAT! The frosting is not FF or SF~ mix: 3T melted butter with 1/4c Hershey's cocoa then add 1 1/2c powdered sugar 2t corn syrup 2t vanilla 2T milk mix. SPREAD on top. This is JUST like eclair frosting.

Simple to put together and absolutely delicious. A little messy though, so I wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for something that "looks" good. Definitely needs 24 hours in the fridge before serving.

I absolutely love this recipe and have a hard time not eating the entire thing! I changed up the pudding mixture a bit. I use 2 large boxes of instant vanilla pudding, 2 1/2 cups milk and 16 oz of cool whip.

What an easy and decadent dessert! My family went wild over this. I used tea biscuits instead of graham crackers and chocolate spread instead of frosting (here in Israel they don't have prepared frosting but chocolate spread did the trick). I whipped the whip and alternately added the pudding mix and the milk (using only 2 cups). Excellent!

I have made this recipe several times.  I just took it to the dessert bake-off at work--and I WON!!!  I was actually somewhat embarrassed!  There were so many complex desserts that were submitted that I am sure people spent HOURS making.....I spent 20 minutes!  This is my husband's favorite dessert (he is the one who told me to make it for the bake-off).  And he was disappointed when I came home with an empty pan.....in fact it went very quickly.  My changes....I use 3 layers of graham crackers and make sure that the top layer is crackers, not cream.  I also use only 8 oz of cool whip.  I coat the entire top with melted canned chocolate frosting (after chilling the dessert in the fridge for an hour) --then I chill it for another hour and take it out and put a decorative swirl/design using vanilla frosting that has been melted in the micro and put into a baggie with the corner cut off.  I wish I had taken a photo of the cake that won---it really was pretty with that white zig zag design I put on top!

I LOVE this cake, as does everyone else who has tried it. It is so incredibly easy to make (and inexpensive), yet it impresses every crowd I make it for, from kids to those with "refined" palettes. I really think you just can't help yourself, even if you want to dislike it just because it seems like simple "kid" food. It's not meant to be fancy, folks...it's just meant to taste good! And it does! 

I like to make it with three layers of graham crackers; one on the bottom, one in the middle and one on top (you pour the frosting over the top layer of crackers) and I find that one box of graham crackers isn't enough to do that (unless you don't completely cover each layer with the crackers).

Easy to make and tasty considering how easy it is.  It's a good recipe to make with kids, or when you just want to throw together something sweet quickly. In response to the review left by Isabelle, I'm surprised that an expert cook like herself would make a recipe like this.  Anyone with any common sense can see that this recipe is focusing on simplicity and they would not expect it to be a gourmet dessert.  Give us a break, Isabelle.

Fun and easy to make (my 3 year-old "helped" me :)). I did make a couple changes: using home-made whipped cream instead of whipped topping, and home-made frosting (just semi-sweet chocolate melted into the same weight of whipping cream). I liked its tiramisu-like consistency, but gave it only 4 stars because the flavor was a little boring. I'll try adding real vanilla extract in the whipped cream and maybe a dash of cinnamon or sprinkling of cocoa next time, something like that.

very good and so easy to whip together! I loved it and so did my husband.  I only usually cook for two so I just halfed the recipe and put it in a 8x8 pan. Used the full can of frosting though since you can never get enough chocolate in a desert!

Very good.  I suggest cutting the recipe in half, just so you don't eat it all and feel guilty later.  It was VERY easy and my kids loved it also.

This was very easy to make, but I was not impressed.  I even used homemade fudge sauce as the topping.  I guess we just find mushy graham crackers very unappealing.  Sorry, won't be making this again.

This recipe calls for too much whipped cream (as others have stated).  A much richer flavor comes from using 3 boxes of pudding mix. And, I can't encourage you enough to make your own frosting for this (I highly recommend "One Bowl Buttercream Frosting" from this site).   For this photo I layered the ingredients in a square pan lined with plastic wrap (I sprayed the plastic lightly with cooking spray).  I chilled it overnight and inverted it on a plate.  I then frosted the top (with the above mentioned frosting!) and dusted the sides with cocoa and chocolate shavings.

This impossibly simple recipe actually won my company's annual bake-off!  I dressed it up by dribbling some lines of melted vanilla frosting over the chocolate frosting.  Everyone was very impressed for next to no effort on my part.

This was a decent recipe.  It tasted good though not  like a chocolate eclair.  I have actually made this exact same cake before and instead of using chocolate I used a can of pie filling cherries.  I definitely preferred the cherries and would not make it with chocolate again.

Hey guys. I Make this dessert all the time. It is great to take to parties because it is sooo easy and can be made ahead of time. I however DO NOT MIX the Pudding with milk. Try using extra whipped topping and either omitting the milk all together or only adding a smaller amount like a cup. Also I always refrigerate overnight before I do the frosting. Then pop it back into the fridge until the frosting is set. Overall this is one of the best and easiest desserts in the world.

I have this same exact recipe, and I always use pistachio pudding and vanilla icing. Pistachio is definitely the way to go! It is so... good this way. Made for St. Patrick's Day today (green pistachio pudding!) Here's my tip: make sure you start and end with a graham cracker layer and break the graham cracker into 4-5 mini-rectangles to make the layers, easier to serve/scoop out. Will be posting a photo...

i didn't care for this at first, but with each day it sat in the fridge and the flavors melded together, it got better.  very refreshing, but very sweet.

I have made this several times for different groups of people and so far EVERY one has raved about it! My 13 year old son just made it (yes -- HE made it)for a Valentine's Day "dessert pot luck" at school. They ate all of it, it was something different then the standard cookies and cupcakes and the teachers and kids wished they had more! This is great!

Everyone loved this. So easy, but next time & may follow someone else advice and make a homemade ganache frosting for the top, instead of the pre-made frosting which to me is kind of yucky to begin with.  Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper.

This is a great, easy and delicious dessert.  I used one box of pitacio pudding and one french vanilla.  Topped with spreadable frosing that I heated in the microwave and topped with chopped pistacios while still warm.

This was very good and I would of rated it 5 stars-but I think some of the ingredient amounts were off. I used two packages of instant vanilla pudding (they are 1.5 ounce boxes)each called for 2 cups of milk so I figured this was the correct amount, I also used an 8 ounce container of whipped topping. This was the perfect amount, using 16 ounces would of taken away from the vanilla flavor and been to whipped cream tasting for me. The end result was GREAT. Then my husband covered it with saran wrap and put it in the fridge. Well the next day, removing the saran wrap removed the majority of the frosting! The leftovers were sloppy and chocolate-less. I would suggest to put some toothpicks in it and "tent" a piece of foil over it for storage.

I strayed just slightly from the recipe.  I used 
French Vanilla pudding and French Vanilla Cool Whip.  This made it too sweet for my taste.  Ergo, I'm going to have to just give this an average rating.

i also use this exact same recipe. My husband is one of the pickiest eaters alive and this is his favorite dessert. My four year old also loves it. This is just an all around crowd pleaser. Can't go wrong with this one.It is also low budget. Which is always great if you have a family.

Very quick and very easy to make...only thing we did different is we made the chocolate frosting from scratch...I found the first batch of this recipe a bit too sweet for my taste using the canned frosting.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now.  It is always well liked by all who tries it.  Today, I made it for a co-workers b-day.  He likes bananas, so substituted one box of banana cream pudding mix and one vanilla. Next time I want to try strawberry icing instead of chocolate. This is a must try...it is easy, quick and delicious!

This is AWESOME!!!! We loved it. I used vanilla pudding and chocolate graham crackers, and I also skipped the frosting, as I didn't have any on hand (although it would have been great). I think that many different combinations would work well. Definitely a keeper!

This dessert is great!  The only change I made was to use french vanilla pudding instead of regular vanilla.  I love the recipe as is but my husband suggested that next time I add a layer of cream cheese.  I will just cut the pudding back to one package and mix it with half of the whipped topping and then will mix the other half with 8oz of cream cheese.  The filling was a bit more than I had room for in my pan even though I used a 9x13 pan as directed.  It was not a big deal since the filling was good by itself.

This was really good and really easy. I used only 3 cups of milk, per the comments of others, but next time I'll use the full 4 cups (my pan was plenty deep). I also used 160z light cool whip.  I took this to an Army Christmas party and apparently it was a hit because the pan got cleaned out. I will definitely make this again, probably sooner rather than later.

This was pretty okay. What I didnt like was that Icey texture in the pudding and whip topping.Next time I'm going to try regular vanilla ice cream mixed with the whip topping. I def will make it again though because it was easy and you can keep it in the freezer for whenever you wanted a treat.

So simple and delicious! I used honey graham crackers, french vanilla pudding and I only put in a 12 oz container of cool whip which was MORE than enough. I wouldn't use as much as this recipe calls for. You won't have room in your pan, and it would taste way to coolwhipey. I used a whole box of graham crackers plus an extra sleeve. I used the choc. frosting and it was EXCELLENT! Don't think using that will make it not good. I microwaved it for about 30 seconds which made the frosting into a perfect melted chocolate liquid. Then I just poured it ontop the cake and it smoothed onto it perfectly on it's own. Definitely make this the night before so the graham crackers have time to soften in the pudding mix. Everyone loved this! My kids are already begging for me to make it again.

So easy and good! I followed other reviewers suggestions and only used an 8 oz container of whipped topping and 3 1/2c milk. I think our favorite version is using white chocolate pudding and chocolate graham crackers. Yummy!

I was hoping for something greater with these ingredients combined, but it didn't wow me as others mentioned.  I halved the recipe and put in an 8x8 pan.  I used a sharp knife to trim the graham crackers to the right size which worked very well.  I also opted for the french vanilla pudding and making the fudge topping (on the stove) another had suggested.  This is easy to assemble and looks pretty, just wasn't awesome for me.  I would not suggested freezing it, as it crystallizes the pudding layer.  It was easier to cut, however, so maybe freezing, cutting, and then de-thawing would work out.  I would also stick to the chocolate frosting recipe, because the topping that I made tasted just like i thought it would, undercooked fudge.  It never sat up well, hence putting it in the freezer to prevent it running everywhere.  I plan on trying this same techinque with chocolate graham crackers, cheese cake pudding, and maybe a white chocolate topping.

This is now my family's favorite dessert. So easy and the only thing I changed was I replaced the chocolate frosting with homemade dark chocolate ganache. I also used sugar free pudding and whipped topping and no one knew the difference! This is so good and with the changes everyone can enjoy this dessert, even the diabetics!

Very yummy, and easy to put together for us busy cooks!!  I did use low fat, or surgar free for the pudding, whipped topping, and hot fudge sauce I used for the top.  Next time I make this, I think I will add another pudding, and cut the whipped topping in half,  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I needed something quick to make to take to a friends for dessert. This was so easy. Used sugar free vanilla pudding and cream cheese pudding, as that was what I had.  Also used skim milk and light cool whip.  Be sure to heat the frosting, as it makes it much easier to pour over the top layer.  I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe so many times I think I could make it in my sleep. Everyone loves it & can't believe how easy it is. I use lite cool whip and make my own frosting when I have time. I really recommend this recipe though for anyone in a hurry.

My mama used to make this when I was a kid, and now I make it for mine. The only thing I do different is I add @ 1/2 tub of cool whip and @ a cup of sour cream. It gives it a richer flavor. I also make homemade icing. It tastes better than canned in my opinion. :)

We love this cake! Few changes -we use french vanilla pudding, 8 oz cool whip, 3 cups of milk and u must refrigerate overnight! Not messy at all-serves beautifully. At St Patricks day we make it with 1 package of pistachio pudding and one french vanilla. Gives it a light pale green color, which would be good for Christmas or Easter! Our family eats the whole 9x13 pan (there is 10 adults!)

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star rating because it's quick and easy to prepare and everyone loved it. My personal preference is to NOT use artificial canned, boxed ingredients because it's not good for you. I almost cried when I saw that the frosting's first ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. eeek!! However, I needed to prepare something quick that would be sure to please and this did it. I think I will try the other recipe on this site because you make the frosting from scratch and that's much better. It's definitely a keeper for last minute dessert.

Oh my goodness, I was surprised about this one. I really didn't think it would come out tasting like a chocolate éclair. And boy was I wrong. It's divine. I made my own  chocolate frosting for the top using the suggestion from one reviewer who used the recipe from mini chocolate éclairs. Perfection.

Loved this. BIG hit with the family for Christmas dessert. I like it better with the canned frosting (go figure). The homemade choc. sauce was too gritty and my 2nd try w/ the frosting was divine. I'm going to try to 1/2 the recipe tonight for just me and my husband. 
You must let this sit in the fridge overnight! Also, to get the pudding/whip mixture to spread out, I bang the pan on the counter a few times so that the graham crackers aren't moved too much (as opposed to spreading w/ a spatula). Works a lot better.

Okay, so I learned an important lesson making this. Apparently the weights of the sugar free puddings are drastically smaller than the weights of the regular puddings.  I did not realize I was picking up the sugar free puddings and ended up having to put 5 or 6 boxes of it in to add up to the suggested ounce sizes in the recipe.  Well, the recipe turned out fine, it was just extremely sweet and I think that is probably because of the mistake in buying the sugarfree pudding.  I took it to my husband's work and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I am rating this recipe 4 stars, because if I had followed I can tell it would have been very good!

yum! i couldn't resist making this recipe but wanted it to have a more homemade touch. the pudding part was basically kept the same except i made cooked vanilla pudding (make this ahead of time so it's cold when you fold in the whipped topping). lastly, i doubled the super delicious warm frosting recipe from "minature chocolate eclairs" (also on this website), spread it overtop then chilled the cake as directed. thanks misty!

This is a very easy & quick dessert that everyone finds rich and creamy.  I do suggest covering the cake while in the frig. so it will stay nice and fresh.  Have made this treat every summer for family and friends, and they all love it.

Wonderful and easy.  Just remember to FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS and use INSTANT pudding.  Saw one reviewer must have used cook and serve pudding.  Hopefully they will read this review and see what their error was.  ENJOY!

Took this to a retirement party and was asked by several people how to make it.  Kind of funny to see it being eaten before many of the more elegant and impressive deserts.  There can't be an easier desert to make.  I'd like to try it with some coffee flavoring, or possible a liquer to make it a little more interesting.

This was perfect for our beach vacation - quick, easy, and kid friendly.  I halved it and put it in a 9x9 pan.  The second time I made this, I used Nature Valley chocolate-covered granola thins & omitted the frosting.  It was great, but the granola thins didn't get soft as graham crackers do.  I think I'll stick to the original ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!!

You can't get much easier than this! I used a jar of Hershey's hot fudge for the top that I microwaved for 30 seconds in place of the frosting. I made this the day before I served it. This was devoured. I heard complaints of stomach aches because they ate so much. Ah, just what a cook wants to hear. =)

I made this a couple of months ago, but only now realized I didn't rate it (busy weekend, and then forgot), but I just posted it on a recipe request, and it reminded me....ANYWAY, this was very good, and SUPER easy!  I made this when some friends came down for my 30th bday.  I wanted something sweet, but not too rich.  I used the sugar free pudding, and low fat cool whip, and this was delish!  Makes a great, cool, light dessert!  YUM!

Absolutely delish!! My husband loved it and he is a tough critic!! Will definitely make again and again! Easy and so good. I did add a bit of chocolate to each layer. Plus, I didn't use a canned frosting, but intstead made a ganache. Perfect!

This is a GREAT dessert! I made it when we had friends over and everyone loved it. I used sugar free vanilla pudding and fat free cool whip to keep things "lighter", and it was still delicious.

What an amazing Father's Day treat! I used cinnamon graham crackers and made a Francelico ganache instead of the chocolate frosting.  This will definitely will be a keeper!

The flavor was very rich.  I used a hot fudge topping and for the frosting.  Very sweet so make the servings small when serving. The graham crackers tasted great with the pudding.

Very simple and easy to put together! We like this as a frozen dessert - I let freeze it and let it sit out for about 30 minutes before serving. I skip the chocolate frosting and drizzle a chocolate glaze on the top instead. I have also made this with chocolate graham crackers and chocolate pudding. Both are good and easy! It took me 10 minutes to put this dessert together!

Definitely not a pretty dessert and quite messy too, but still very yummy!  I used both vanilla and chocolate pudding, fat free cool whip and low fat honey maid graham crackers.  Turned out great and really turns out well making the day before.  I also used Bay Chick's 'frosting' which I found a bit too sweet for this, but it did turn out looking like an eclair!  The taste reminds me more of a boston cream type dessert, either way, doesn't matter as it went over well for our family dinner party of 15!

Solid 4 1/2! Yes, the hardest part is waiting 12 hours, but you really should. Try not to use cinnamon grahams. It throws off the taste. This recipe is going in my personal box. Everybody loved it at Christmas, and it's so simple!!

I can't believe how easy this recipe is!  I brought this to a party where it sat in a warm kitchen and it got really runny.  It didn't look very appetizing after that but it still tasted great.  My mom froze the one I brought her and she said it was good frozen too.

This was very easy to make and absolutely addictive. It was a big hit and presented attractively. I had a little bit of the pudding mixture leftover and so I paired it with chocolate graham crackers for a mini version of the larger cake. It was also very tasty.

This is just like the recipe I have, only I use "Pour and Frost" microwavable frosting.  This is my absolute favorite dessert and if I don't make it for every church function, people ask me where it is!  It is so simple and easy to prepare the night before.  Plus, kids love it because it's just pudding and frosting!  This is a LIFE SAVER!!!

This recipe is fantastic.  I used chocolate pudding and added mini marshmallows to mine.  It tasted like a giant Smore.  My co-workers loved it.  I will be making this dessert for Thanksgiving Dinner for a local restaurant.

maybe the explanation is not so clear..When are we supposed to fold in the whipped cream? when the pudding is still hot? If folding in while still hot, then whipped cream melt;If folding when it cools down, the pudding mixture is not liquid anymore. Couple of my friends are trying ot work out this recipe but still don't have a clue.

I highly recommend making this quick,easy and delicious cake.  I made this for my daughter's recital party and it flew off the table.  I think next time I will use chocolate pudding.  Thanks Misty and Patty too.

We have been making this recipe at my house for a few years now.  It is so easy to make and tastes fantastic if you wait long enough for it to set up and the graham crackers to soften.  We use french vanilla pudding mix and the store bought chocolate fudge frosting for this.  This is one the whole family enjoys ... also a good one for the kids to participate in making.

I got this recipe from my church cookbook, and just tried it today, and it is great!! I didn't heat the frosting, I just left it at room temperature and stirred it up a few times before using it, so it would spread easier. I also needed it for supper that night, so I just put it in the freezer until it seemed set, then set it out on the table during our meal until it was ready to serve. The graham crackers weren't as soft, but they weren't too hard either, I really liked it and will make it again. It is my husbands faveorite.

This was great and so easy!!  I took one of the suggestions and put the frosting in the microwave and just poured it over the cake.  It really tastes like an eclair.  For easy cutting though, let it refrigerate overnight.  My husband was impatient and we had it after 3 hours and it was a little hard to cut.

I could not find my original recipe & used this one instead.  this was too loose, didn't stay in squares & didn't taste at all like my recipe.  finally found my original  & the difference is - 3 cups milk not 4, 12 oz of cool whip - not 16 oz.  my original recipe stayed together as squares were cut - this did not.  this tasted too much like cool whip w/very little vanilla pudding taste.  my original is much better & it is on this sight
this did not taste like a chocolate eclair but the original does.    I did buy chocolate fudge frosting in the can - microwaved - poured over the top layer of graham crackers which is not in the original recipe but tastes great, easy & delicious.

I was asked to bring a dessert to a potluck, and as I was browsing through AR, I stumbled across this recipe. Based on the reviews and gorgeous pix, I decided to give this a shot - and boy, I absolutely do not regret it. I was short of time, and didn't quite get to allow it to set overnight (although I did manage to give it about 10 hours to sit, to speed up the process, I put it for 2 hours in the fridge, then pushed them into the freezer and shifted them back into the fridge about 2 hours before serving). 
I didn't have graham crackers on hand, so I used digestive biscuits instead. I took the advise of another reviewer and dunked each biscuit into milk (to soften the cookie) before using it in the cake layer. I used Jello French Vanilla Pudding and decided against using 16oz of cool whip - instead, I chose to keep the cool whip down to 8oz (IMHO, 8oz is just perfect). Warming the frosting before pouring it over the layered cake is a genius idea. This dessert iz a breeze to make - and it was devoured in no time! Thank you for sharing this recipe with us! This one's definitely a keeper! 
P.S: Next time, I'm gonna try dunking the biscuits in coffee to give it a tiramisu twist! :D

I didn't have any of this but those who did loved it.  So easy too.  However, reading some of the reviews I made a couple of changes.  I used only 3 1/2 cups milk, and only an 8 oz tub of Cool Whip.  And for the frosting, I made a chocolate ganache. Will definitely make this again.

While it looks very impressive, it is in fact very bland.  It is easy to make and fast but that does not make up for the lack of flavor.

This is absolutely amazing. OMG. I have used all fat free ingredients. Fat free or sugar free or low fat. (Except when it comes to the frosting). It pretty much tastes the same.

I cut this recipe in half to fit a deep 8x8 baking pan. I made this a little lighter so we could still have a dessert and not feel guilty. I used sugar free instant cheesecake pudding, half fat free milk/half fat free evaporated milk, "free" whipped topping and sugar free chocolate frosting. I also used chocolate grahams. HUGE hit with the boys and easy enough for my oldest to help me make. NOTE: Don't skip the "sit in the fridge" step. You really want those grahams to soak up some of that "eclair" filling and get super yummy.

I had some of this at my work today that someone made...I had seconds and bought all the stuff to make it for tomorrow. I did the half recipe. Used French vanilla pudding and fat free whip. I can tell this can be tweaked tons of different ways and will always be good.

My husband proclaimed this the best dessert I have made in years!  I made the Chocolate Eclair Cake for Mother's Day and my mother-in-law insisted I must add this to our Williamson family cookbook.  I HUGE hit with everyone!  I will be making this on a regular basis, especially for birthday's at the office!

Excellent recipe!  Loved it!  I did reduce the amount of whipped cream, used about 3/4 of a 16 oz container.  Will definitely make this again!

I only use 3C milk, French Vanilla pudding, and 8oz. Cool Whip.  I used chocolate fudge frosting, nuked it on power 5 for 30 seconds, stirred and a bit more nuking! Much easier to spread, and the chocolate fudge makes it more like an eclair! 
As soon as folks tasted it they said “I’m taking some of this home!” Everyone loved it!
I know I changed it! But only after making the original! Both rate 5 stars! I just like my adaptation better!

I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla and substituted 1 cup of Kaluha liqueur  for 1 cup of milk when preparing the pudding.  I finished it off with cream cheese frosting.*   
My guests raved over this very tasty dessert.

*This dessert should be served immediately after removing from refrigerator.  After 20 minutes or so at room temperature, it gets too soft.

One word for this recipe - DELICIOUS!  This was my first time making it and I can guarantee it won't be the last.  I followed the recipe without any changes and it was the hit of the Thanksgiving desserts.  It was the one dessert where people were going back for seconds....even after the big meal!  Thank you for sharing this simple, yet amazing recipe!

I made this dessert but substituted whipping cream for the cool whip. I added 1 tsp pure vanilla and 2 tbsp of icing sugar. I also used cocoa, milk, butter and vanilla for the glaze. I still felt the dessert needed more flavour so may try the cool whip. My family does not like anything too sweet.

I have made this for years. It is light, flavorful, and a real crowd pleaser. I frequently make two - one to take to an event and one for home. I make my icing with light Kairo and cocoa powder, but canned icing is good too.  I can’t imagine anyone being disappointed with this recipe.

This was amazing, and my first time making this. It was so good, it's already almost gone. I read some of the review before making it, and definitely recommend making the topping more of a ganache, rather than just melted canned frosting. The ganache really elevates the cake and makes it that much more addicting. Really easy to do just 12oz of chocolate chips with 1 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream. Highly recommend this recipe

Been making this for years. I do add a can of sweetened condensed milk to the pudding mixture. If I made this with sugar free ingredients, I would let everyone know. Many sweeteners do not agree with me at all!

I have made this before and everyone loves it!  My recipe calls for 3 cups of milk, not 4.  Also, I only use 12 ounces cool whip, not 16.  I also drizzle Hershey's Syrup over each layer of filling and run a butter knife through it to make swirls.  It adds a little extra to it.

This came out as basically just a bowl of pudding with a slab of icing on top. The graham crackers mostly dissolved, which was disappointing. It was just really disappointing. 

If I ever made this again, I’d reduce the milk to 3 cups, so that it’d be thicker. I would use NO MORE than an 8oz tub of cool whip. I would also double up on the layers of graham crackers (2 layers of crackers between each layer of pudding). For the icing... I’m not sure. I’m not used to store bought icing, so it was wayyy too sweet to me. I’d probably use a thin layer of a dark chocolate sauce. It wouldn’t set up like the icing, but I think it’d taste better.

This is differently a summer dessert to die for! I happened to pick up French Vanilla pudding by mistake and used it instead of Vanilla. My husband suggested we add AMARETTO. I added one shot. It' was great, not too much, just a hint.
I suggest using a deep pan. There's a lot of pudding mix. This is a go to dessert in my house now!

Love this cake and there's no baking involved. Just a forewarning, you will need an EXTRA LARGE BOWL for the 4 cups of milk and then the milk you need to add to the pudding and then the cool whip.

Made it for work, used Hersheys milk chocolate frosting, and it was a hit with everyone. Multiple people asked for recipe. Only refrigerated about 8-9 hours because I forgot to thaw the cool whip ahead of time, and didn't get it made early enough, but it was perfect. Great easy recipe, nothing gourmet or fancy, but perfect for a potluck or a crowd.

Have made this several times.  I use one large & one small box of pudding, and only half (8oz) of the whipped cream the recipe calls for.  I brush each of the graham layers with milk.  Make sure not to layer the pudding/whip cream layer too thick!  I've made this mistake & it gets to be too much "fluff" (yuk - ruined the dessert).  Also, be sure to make this the night before!

Used dark chocolate frosting;  this is one of my husband's favorite desserts, and it's easy to make, and GREAT on hot summer days (no baking).

As someone who was on the eating end of this recipe, rather than the actually creating of it.....it is AMAZING!  Our secretary brought it to our school as a gift for the staff today and everyone was raving.  I had to find the recipe and am floored by how easy it is to make!  I had no idea they were graham crackers, it actually seems like the real eclair dough.  Beyond impressed by this and am absolutely saving it in my recipe box!

I have made this recipe for years.  It is excellent and always a winner.  Very easy to make ahead and take places.  I do use 3 1/2 cups milk so the pudding is a little thicker.

I make this often. I add  one 8oz cream cheese (soften) to the pudding mixture and once it's all together, freeze it overnight. Set it in the fridge the morning of the night you plan to serve it it will be just right when ready to serve. It won't be soggy.

Always a hit....I used 2 boxes of French vanilla pudding and lite whipped topping. I really think that you can get away with an 8oz. container of whipped topping vs. the 16oz. It makes a lot of filling....I think I made 3 layers of everything and filled a 9x13 pan to the brim with the chocolate icing included. Make this one the night before serving...it is the best because the graham crackers get kinda mushy and soft with the pudding. So good....defianately kiddo and parent approved.

I used this recipe in my food class, and it was AMAZING!!! it was the perfect amount of cream and graham crackers. However, I suggest waiting more then 12 hrs because it is much better when theres no crunchy crackers.

I have served the dessert to over 100 people and they love it.  Sometimes I divide the pudding in half using choc. instant pudding for the top layer before putting on the graham crackers and frosting.  I love recipe for large groups.

Everyone loves this easy dessert and I'm asked to make it often!  Sometimes, for a small dinner gathering, I make it in a 8 x 8 dish and scale the recipe to 12, except keeping the frosting at the full can size.
