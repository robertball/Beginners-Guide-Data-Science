Pretty close...I am missing the cardamom, so that is probably what is lacking here.  My husband started cooking shrimp, but we ran out of Chesapeake Bay Seasoning.  I decided to check my favorite recipe website and this is the only one I could find.  We will definitely be making it again--with all of the ingredients next time.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

It's good. Wondering why this one has no mace like the the Actual OLD BAY SEASONING Recipe that is posted.

Used celery salt instead of celery seed and salt.  Did not have ground cardamom on hand.  Eliminated red pepper flakes for the children.
Good 1st try, but wonder if it would be better if/when I add cardamom to the mix.  Used these seasonings in "Captain Duarte's Salt Cod Cakes" instead of Old Bay Seasoning.  Its nice to have an alternative to running out to the store on short notice.  Yes, thank you for posting.

I could have sworn I had some Old Bay Seasoning before I started cooking my etouffe, but alas, I did not.  So while my vegetables were simmering on the stove, I had to scramble to come up with Plan B.  This was it.  As I was mixing it, I was gravely concerned that my etouffe would taste like apple pie.  It did not and no one besides me even knew that it wasn't Old Bay Seasoning in my dish. I'll still use Old Bay in the future because I'm too lazy to mix seasonings together if I don't have to, but this was pretty close.  Thank you, Colonel, for saving my supper!

This is close!  I didn't have ground bay leaves so it ran some through my spice mill.  Then the rest looked too coarse so I ran the whole thing through the spice mill.  I'm thinking the flavors may blend a bit more after being stored together for a while.

I think itâ€™s a little salty, and to get the same texture as Old Bay, it probably should be put into the blender to grind up the red pepper flakes.  Other than that, it definitely is reminiscent of the real deal, Old Bay.

I made this according to the recipe, but the finished product didn't look nearly as red as the picture or the OBSS  I had on the shelf.  I wonder if there shouldn't be more paprika?

I started with a scant 4T of salt, based on other reviews. Still way too salty for other flavor to be recognized.

I have made this a couple times and never printed the recipe. I was worried when I did not see it at first today. It is a great recipe and I would hate to be without it in my pantry.

I didn't have celery seed or cardamom, so I made it without them. I also accidentally put in too much cinnamon, but this was still really delicious. I used it to make crab dip and it was awesome -

This is excellent! My sweetheart and I are getting health conscious so it's nice to find recipes to our favourite seasoning blends where we can control the salt.  Thank you for posting :)

Used this for shrimp when it was too cold out to grill. Gave the shrimp a good favor. Will use it again.
