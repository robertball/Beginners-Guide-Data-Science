Absolutely delicious. I did not add cilantro though..that might have made it even better. I am glad that I did not opt for the cheaper cut of steak. the top sirloin was worth every penney. Sorry that I did not take a picture of it for you but my mouth was watering....

As usual I made a couple of minor changes: I rubbed the steak with the oil/chili/cumin/salt, and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. I cooked it on the Foreman grill, then sliced it really thinly (used a pretty cheap cut of steak). Finally, instead of lemon, I used the juice of one lime. I thought it was just ok, but Husband really enjoyed it. Thanks!

I was really excited to make this recipe.  I love southwestern food and this recipe looked easy enough to prepare.  It was in fact simple to make and was very inexpensive as well.      However, I was not really impressed with it.  The steak tasted really good.    I like the combination of spices that are used in it.  But the rice was way too lemony for my liking.  Either I had some amazing produce, or this recipe just calls for too much lemon.  In hindsight, I would probably do without the lemon and just squeeze some on top afterwards to give it some zest.  The lemon issues aside, I think if you are looking for a quick fix meal, this is will do.  If you are looking for a knock your socks off southwestern meal, this is not it.
