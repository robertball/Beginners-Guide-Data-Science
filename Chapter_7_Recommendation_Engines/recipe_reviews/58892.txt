This recipe was excellent and very easy to make.  I would recommend black olives instead of the green.  Makes a large bowl, and believe me if there are any leftovers, it will get eaten!

Although this is good, it's incredibly salty. Next time I'll substitute black olives and omit the dry dressing packet. I also omit onions, tomatoes and mushrooms (no one but me likes them), parm. cheese (can't do dairy)  but add zucchini.

This was really good!!  Hint:  Be sure you look at the serving size!! I made enough for 12 servings -- This was a little to much pasta!! But the flavoring was quite wonderful!!! I recommend this dish!

I cut this recipe in half. I used Paul Newman's italian dressing, fresh sliced Baby Bella mushrooms instead of canned, black olives instead of green (that's what I had on hand) and I used DC Girly Girl's salad seasoning (which is also on this site) in this recipe instead of a store-bought brand. We thought this was very good, quite kicky. I think if I'd used a packaged salad seasoning, it might have been too salty. As it was, it was just right. Making my own salad seasoning made me able to control the salt. Next time, I'd like to add more vegetables, like chopped tomatoes, red pepper and maybe zucchini. The longer it sits, the better it gets.

made this for a teacher luncheon and everyone loved it.  used black olives instead of green and did not use as much salad dressing.  Warmed leftovers and it is great warm!

This was certainly a keeper.  I did not have bottled italian dressing on hand, so I made homemade (from a recipe on this site).  The salad was delicious.

We made this and took it to a pot-luck.  Many dishes there had left-overs. NOT THIS ONE!  We got several requests for the recipe. It is really good.  â˜º

My sister-in-law made this using cheese tortellini instead of spaghetti.  Although I didn't care for it, my 5-year old gobbled it up!

I made this for a quick lunch for myself so I just eye-balled everything. Added some veggies that needed used up and left out what I didn't have on hand.

I make this all the time!  Me and mom are addicted to it.  It has so much flavor especially with the red wine vinegar.  I cant stand people that just put salad dressing and pasta in a bowl and say "It's ready!"  This is real pasta salad!

Made a version of this using a half of 16 oz package of spaghetti added in black olives, zucchini, shredded parmesan cheese, zesty italian dressing, and pepperoni (what I had on hand) It turned out pretty good.

Very good pasta salad with lots of flavor!  The apple cider vinegar and pepperoni really make it!
