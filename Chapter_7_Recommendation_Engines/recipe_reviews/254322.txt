I added garlic cause that's how I roll.  They were delicious and I will definitely make them again.  I also cheated a little and started with frozen, riced cauliflower.  I didn't spray them with cooking spray cause yuck, that's just too chemically induced.  I brushed them lightly with olive oil instead

Made as written down to the cooking time and these turned out perfect. Excellent recipe! I can't wait to try them again using Mexican flavors. Thanks for sharing!

Small head of cauliflower yielded 3 cups so 2 whole eggs were whisked together with basil, oregano and seasoned salt and the rest of recipe. Plus 1/4 C more of bread crumbs were added.  The baking time increased to 12-15 minutes per side because they were a little bigger.  They have the smooth texture of tots inside, but I think you would have to deep fry these to get that crispy "tot" exterior. Outer layer is a bit rubbery, but worth the less fat.

These were so easy and tasty! This was the recipe that had the fewest ingredients that came up when I googled cauliflower tots. My Panko crumbs had Parmesan cheese and Italian herbs, so I omitted the parsley. My egg cauliflower blend seemed a little "wet" so I added just a little extra panko crumbs. Taking a suggestion from one of the other reviewers, I rolled the tots in more panko crumbs and deep fried the tots. They were great. Will definitely make these again. My grandson liked them. I told him they were tots, but did not say they were cauliflower.

I followed the recipe and we loved them! I am so excited, as I'm trying really hard to find healthier choices instead of potatoes and rice. One note: I made the mistake of using dried onion flakes instead of real onion so my miss was dry and I really had to work to get things to hold together. Next time, I'll use fresh onions!

Easy to make; took a little more time than I expected. Next time I'll steam the cauliflower the night before to save time! I used a large head of cauliflower and the yield was suffice for my family and leftovers for work the next day. Delicious! I made this gluten-free and it was tasty and easily rolled together despite the lack of gluten component.  My stomach was quite pleased!

These are great!  I used my food processor to make the cauliflower "rice".  It worked like a charm.  I also followed the advice of some of the reviews to add more flavor, using a garlic/herb spice,  bacon bits and shredded cheddar cheese.  I also made an aoli for dipping.  Fantastic!!!

I didn't have bread crumbs so I used small oatmeal flakes and it worked great !  ;-)   I added cheddar and green onion as well. You can use herbs or spices to give it more depth and make it your own, overall 2 thumbs up !

Made the recipe as written, then had some leftover ingredients so made a half batch using tarragon.  Both were like potato chips - couldn't stop eating them.  I did little patties instead of "tots."  I can see where this is a very versatile recipe.  You could flavor them with many herbs or seasonings.  But the basic recipe is delicious.  Kids would love them.  I plan to make some for an event at my club.  I'll be buying cauliflower and putting the cooked "rice" in my freezer so I can make them any time.

Cleaver way to use cauliflower.  Extremely pleased with how they came out.  Rolled 'tots' in seasoned bread crumbs prior to baking.  Adding to our regular rotation.

Super easy and good. I used Mozzarella shredded instead of Parmesan (what I had on hand plus preference) and added garlic. Used dried minced onion, again, what I had on hand and Italian spices. Cooking time perfect, great texture and flavor, basically like tater tots but not greasy and even my boys loved them!! Will definitely make again.

This reminds me of the cauliflower pizza crust I've made. My 7 year old grandson loves that. I can't wait for hom to try these. These are very flavorable and easy to make, much better than the giant makes.

Very tasty. I substituted almond flour for the breadcrumbs to make it gluten-free. Very tasty. My finicky kids ate them up.

Will definitely make it again.  Added thyme, oregano,  Lowreys garlic, rosemary, lemon seasoning and a bit more pepper.
Didn't have a cauliflower taste,  so it would be a great way to serve it to anyone who says they don't like cauliflower.  I shaped it into logs, but it can be made into any shape.
Makes a great appetizer.

Made recipe as an appetizer with both an aioli and a dill/ranch dip.   The “tots” went over very well with everyone. Even cauliflower skeptics enjoyed them.

I used olive oil instead of canola and sprinkled lemon pepper in with the bread crumbs and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!
Will repeat often.  Good and good for you!!

We loved these! I added 2 whole eggs and made them into patties. I used my pastry blender to rice the steamed cauliflower which worked really well too. A good quality parm also makes things taste better and olive oil to grease the pan. These with a salad made a nice little meal. The leftover patties were delicious the next day too! Thank you for a great recipe!

Tried it as written. I had enough leftover rice to try it again. I used 5 slices of cooked bacon crumbled, replaced the parmesan cheese with low fat cheddar cheese, and green onion. It was even better than the first one. Will definitely make this again

These were just alright but they didn't have enough flavor to make them a big hit.  I dipped them in hot sauce and that really helped!

Except for spices, I followed the recipe to a tee. I could not get it to form into logs.  Very bland, despite me adding in the spices. Will not make again.
