Quick and easy. And delicious. For those of you having trouble with the pudding layer, make sure you do not make the pudding per the directions on the box. This recipe calls for half the milk you would normally use for two boxes of pudding. Mine set up great - pudding was very thick even before refrigerating it.

NOTE: To those of you complaining about the pie being sloppy, that's impossible unless you used too much milk. I think some people are following the pudding directions from the pudding box when they prepare it! Do not do this! It is 2 cups cold milk for both boxes! The box will tell you to use 2 cups for each pudding packet making it 4 cups milk. That is why your pie is sloppy.

This recipe is very good! Perfect consistency and this crust is way better than the packaged premade oreo crust.

This was the most excellent Oreo recipe pie I have ever come across. It's a bit more difficult to make than what you might think, despite the easy ingredients, and it can be a little time consuming with the layers.

These are the only changes I would make to this recipe: Allow it to set overnight, as opposed to only 4 hours. I would recommend freezing the pie prior to serving for easy cutting & aesthetic presentation. I also topped each slice off with an Oreo cookie. Delicious!

This was a great recipe! I made it twice for large crowds and it was eaten up very quickly! Two suggestions though. I noticed the pie didn't feed many people so if you're making this for more than 8 people, I suggest doubling the recipe and putting it in a cake pan. Also, let it set overnight! I wold recommend this to anyone. I'm twelve, and I made it without help, so anyone can make this!

It came out great. I recommend not making the layers that contain cool whip as thick as they do. Instead make the pudding layer then the cool whip, put it in the fridge for a half hour and then put on the third layer bic if not it can get messy. I put the pie in my freezer set on low until the next night and it cut perfectly, only you need to push down extra hard to cut the oreo crust.
Very filling so cut small slices!

Cheers!

yummmmmm!!! to get the layers even and keep them clean (im picky about presentation!), i stuck the pie in the freezer for a bit after each later was added. i also stuck the crust in the oven on like 300 degrees for a few minutes to help it set better and keep it from crumbling. great recipe though!

One of the best oreo pies i have made.  I used premade oreo pie crusts instead of making my own because it makes 2 pies instead of one.  This is always the favorite at our monthly family BBQ's!

Would have been 5 stars but I had problems with the Oreo cookie crust. Are you supposed to remove the cream filling before crushing? I kept the cream filling in, and I found the result to be lumpy. The crust simply did not hold together very well. Otherwise, this is a wonderful, very easy dessert.

This was very, very good. It is very rich though, so don't make it if you don't like really chocolatey things

I made this 6 hours before we ate it and when I went to cut it, it was sloppy. The next day it was better, but still not like the picture. 

However, the flavor was amazing. It was like some brownie or something. I used chocolate filled generic Oreos and it was a chocolate lovers dream. I also sprinkled some cookie crumbs on top of the pie. Yum.

This is for those of you like me, who do exactly what the recipe says. I was sooo mad because my pudding wasn’t thickening I even let it sit in the fridge for 5 1/2hrs!! And the bottom was like when you get cornstarch wet. So I went back to the pudding box and read what to do, you have to boil it. It sure would have been nice to know that, especially for ppl like me who don’t make pudding and don’t know these things. So if you made this and it was soupy that’s why. Other than that set back this is really easy to make I haven’t tried it yet but I tasted all the layers and they were good.

Pudding pies are always an easy way to have a yummy dessert. Making the crust is an extra minute of time and well worth it.

This was delicious! I tweaked it a bit since a lot of people said the time for it to set was a bit long. First, I got a pack of double stuf oreo's, seperated them into two piles. The side with no cream I crushed up and used for crust. Instead of just 2 packages of chocolate pudding I added a third package of cheescake pudding and mixed all three with roughly 2 1/3 cups skim milk. I layered the filling as instructed, but before putting on the whipped cream layer I took about 6 of the cookie halves with cream and smooshed them with my fingers to make big chunks and put them on top of the second layer. Lastly I did the same smooshing with the rest of the cookie halves and mixed them in the whipped cream. Then put it all in the fridge for about an hour or two and perfection!!

I'm thirteen years old and I tried this recipe. I even added a layer of cookies and cream pudding mixed with a bit of whipped cream (I don't like cool whip- I usually make my own whipped cream) Unfortunately, I used a pre-made crust, and with my bad luck, it crumbled... Never using one of those again. Right now it's setting up in the fridge with a large stainless steel bowl over it to protect it from the deadly "taste of the refrigerator". It looks amazing and I think it'll taste amazing too. Very easy and simple to make- I'm thinking of making the pudding from scratch next time, so if it comes out good, I'll be sure to post the recipe!

This pie is incredible! It's easy to make, but it does take a long time to set. You'll get the best results by letting each layer set for a few hours before moving onto the next.

Really delicious. I made as recommended, but didn't have problems with the layers. I froze it, but wouldn't do that again; next time, I would simply chill in the fridge.

This is the easiest but yet one of the best recipes! It received many compliments, even from people who are not a fan of Oreos. Even though it turned out great I would use a little more butter next time for the crust because i found it did not stick together really well. Over all great recipe!!

I love this recipe! My husband is not a fan of chocolatey desserts but definitely has a sweet tooth. That being said, the first time I made this, I made 2 separate pies one exactly as written (which is delicious and wasn't runny for me at all) and the other all white. I used golden Oreos for the crust.. 2 boxes of white chocolate INSTANT pudding, and the cool whip following all the same measurements. Now, I have to say that the white versîon we liked a lot better! It was just so rich and buttery, melt in your mouth good. It's the only one I make now but I just throw in all but 6 or so cookies for the crust and use half of the pudding for the first layer and the other half mixed with half of the cool whip for the second layer. I just spread each layer right on top of the other without any issues at all...you won't regret this pie!

Wonderful recipe!  Made this exactly as specified.  Came out perfect, and got rave reviews.  There were no leftovers.  I was requested to remake this dessert at our next gathering.

My granddaughter requested this pie for her birthday,  I melted 1-1/2 cups of semi-chocolate and drizzled it on the crust.  Also sprinkled Oreo cookie crumbs on top of the whipped topping.  Delicious!

This is my first time making pie and it was sooo quick and easy like other reviewers mentioned. I used peanut butter oreos and triple double oreo and used oreo cookies n cream pudding instead, and it came out perfectly! The best combo of peanut butter and oreo goodness :)

I made this pie for a July 4th cookout and it was a hit! It was also one of the easiest recipes I've ever followed. Next time, I would follow some of the other reviewers' advice and put the pie in the freezer for 30 minutes before adding the next layer, but only simply to add to the presentation factor. The only changes I made were that I used store brand Oreo's and a premade Oreo pie crust, but only because I was in a hurry to make it. I've made pie crusts using cookies and butter before and it is also very easy. Great recipe and I can't wait to make it again soon!

I loved this pie! Although i thought the middle layer with the pudding was too loose. My suggestion to that is to apply the milk it slow increments until you get the thickness that is best. I also had to put my pie into the freezer because it would melt on the countertop and melt in the refrigerator. Although if you freeze the pie, let it thaw for a minute or two before you eat it so it isn't too frozen. Overall my family and I loved this pie and it was quick and easy to make. :]

Don't use My-T-Fine or the filling will be too sloppy! You can use other generic brands otherwise. The pie is great except it is a bit too sweet.

This gets extra points in my book for being so fast and easy to make. I cheated by using a ready-made chocolate pie crust. Besides, I only had 4 Oreo cookies so wasn't able to make the crust even if I had wanted to. It still turned out great. How can you go wrong with chocolate and cool whip?

My entire family loves this pie, even the picky little boy! I cheated and used the pre-made oreo crust to make things easier. I only suggest a longer fridge time because it was still a little sloppy after 4 hours. We tried it again the next day after dinner and it was perfect.

I have been looking for the boxed Oreo Pie kit in the stores for the loooongest time because it is my boyfriend's favorite, however I haven't been able to find it in stores anymore. This was a great substitute, he said it was even better than the boxed stuff!!!

This is the first time i have tried the pie version of what i usually make for parties called "mud".  As always YUMMYYYYYY although i am going to stick to the the bowl version (which is the same thing except no cookie crust, and its in a bowl to scoop) because, well we ended up scooping it anyway! Yummy recipe, everyone loved!

This recipe was great tasting and easy! I did not mix the oreos throughout the pudding and whip cream and I substituted shaved chocolate on top for the crushed oreos.

This was a very simple recipe! The reviews had me slightly nervous with all the "oreo soup" comments.  I think the only thing you need to make sure you have is the "instant pudding" then there is no way you can mess this up!

First time I made this is turned out great. Super easy. Second time I made it the pudding was slop. Third time I made it I made sure I was using INSTANT pudding and it turned out perfect like the first time. The only thing I can think is the second time I accidentally purchased the pudding you boil instead of instant. Hope that helps those of you who had pudding soup.

I love chocolate and Oreos so this is my dream dessert! However, I suggest anyone making this pie to make the following change: use a little more than 2 cups of milk when mixing the pudding for the first layer of the pie. I followed the recipe exactly using a premade oreo crust and instant chocolate pudding, and it was so thick it was a paste! Trying to spread this sticky pudding paste into the delicate premade Oreo pie crust is impossible! I used a rubber spatula to try and spread it around and all it did was stick to the spatula and lift/break the crust! So just add milk a little bit at a time until its the consistency of a frosting, not a paste. A creamier bottom layer will definitely save frustration and waste! Off to the store to get more ingredients and try again! Hope this helps someone!

I made it as written and after refrigerating overnight we could not cut and serve a "piece of pie".  We spooned out a serving for my husband and then i put the pie in the freezer. Freezing it and then serving we could definitely see all three layers and the pie was easy to cut and serve.

Quick, easy, and super yummy! I usually use premade oreo pie crusts and put a few extra oreos on top along with making the bottom chocolate layer a little thicker than recommended. I tend to aim for the bottom layer to be the thickest, middle a little thinner, and the top the thinnest. I would definitely recommend this recipe if you're looking for a simple, very chocolaty dessert :)

This was great! I followed this recipe exactly as stated and it came out great! It was pretty firm when slicing it - no problems with sloppiness. And it tasted like chocolately Oreos. Mmmmm!

A big hit!  I don't like desserts and I rarely make them.  This one was easy and tasty.  I used Trader Joe's "Jo-Jo" cookies instead of oreos (same type of cookie).  It does take longer than 4 hours to chill until it is firm.  I would say more like eight hours or put it in the freezer.  Great dessert for kids!

Too good for words. I only had one chocolate pudding, so I used a vanilla with the one chocolate. I also cheated and used a premade oreo pie crust.

This was delicious! I did exactly as the recipe said except I used a little less Cool Whip on top. Next time I might just buy a premade Oreo crust to save on the prep time.

SOOOOO GOOD, but with these ingredients, how could it not be? I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. Put it directly in the freezer after making so it would "set" quicker because I'm pregnant and couldn't wait 4 hours. If I were serving this to guests, I would put it in the freezer 1 hour before serving to make sure the slices looked nice when cutting.

I brought this into work and it was absolutely phenomenal. The pie was gone within 10 minutes. A suggestion would be to freeze it instead of refrigerating it, it makes it more manageable to eat but the crust is a little harder to cut. All in all 5 stars, it was delicious!

Yummy recipe. You can't go wrong with oreos, cool whip and chocolate pudding. I made things a little easier on myself and used a store bought oreo crust other than that I followed the recipe to a T.

For such a simple recipe this is surprisingly delicious. I've made it with the mint oreos as well (taking the cream out of half of them since they are doublestuffed) and it is fantastic.

Super easy to make
I've made this twice now with some differences.
I used a pre-made chocolate cookie crust for both pies.
First pie, I used regular sugar chocolate pudding and cool whip. Turned out fantastic. Rich and yummy.
2nd time. I used sugar free chocolate pudding. Tastes the same, BUT there is something with sugar free to where it just doesn't mix right. So there were a lot of little granule looking bits and the bottom most layer isn't as thick as it was when using the regular sugar pudding.
Also, I used a generic store brand whipped cream (Kroger) in a tub and the consistency is also slightly... thinner than actual Cool Whip. Tastes the same, but there is just a difference. It's not a HUGE deal or anything but just thought I'd mention it.

Delicious! I followed the recipe, except I baked the crust at 350° for 10 minutes to solidify it, so it wouldnt crumble when sliced. And instead of Cool Whip, I made the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting recipe from this app. I took the pie to a party and it disappeared in minutes....
At the suggestion of another reviewer, I made this recipe again using Golden Oreos and French vanilla pudding. I actually preferred that better. it was light and creamy instead of ultra rich. But either way, this is a quick, easy, and delicious pie!

This pie tasted amazing!! 

Instead of making an Oreo crust I just used the pre-made one from the store. I also decorated the pie with Oreo halves and sprinkles chocolate chip morsels in the middle. 

Will definitely make this again :)

Big hit with adults and kids. Crushing the cookies required a lot of elbow grease, at first I didn't know if I was supposed to do just the cookie part or include the cream, too. I worried the cream would be weird...oh, but it wasn't.

I made this in a 9-1/2" glass pie pan, as I thought it was way too much crust and filling for a 9" pan.  This was easy to make and was well received at the "Friends-giving" party we attended.  It was a very rich dessert.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I made this for a class project in FACS (which is home ec).  This was sooo good. I do recommend that you use 1/2 cup of butter for the crust because 1/4 still leaves it very crumbly and not pie crust like at all. Everyone loved it so much that we had to make another one for the faculty.  It is very easy. Just make sure you get instant. Follow the recipe and it turns out amazing.

If I could give this zero stars, I would.  The pudding mix they tell you to use is not the correct one, you need to be sure you get one that will set in the refrigerator.  I mixed everything per the instructions to the letter, and the pudding never set, it set in my fridge while I was at work all day and is still totally liquid. It was supposed to be for a friend's birthday party tonight, so I have to rush around and make other plans. Extremely disappointed!

The trick to the layers is to spoon in all of that layer into mounds then spread by gently pushing out from the center of the mound. Keep doing that until the layer is even and spread to the edges.  The pudding is so thick I was able to do all layers with no fridge time between. I used more than half of the first pudding layer because when you add the cool whip to the second  pudding layer the amount increases. Otherwise the second layer will be much thicker than the first.  Haven't eaten it yet but the scrapings were delicious! Hardest part was crushing the cookies without a food processor.  My grandkids will be my taste testers later today!

This recipe was amazing! My family had nothing but great things to say about how this turned out. I'll definitely be making this again. However, I did do a few things differently. 

I have a large household, so I chose to double the recipe and make it in a cake pan. I would recommend doing so if you're making it for a large family or gathering (or if you'd like left-overs lol). 

For the crust, I was concerned about the center of the oreos making it difficult to crush finely. I chose to scrape each cookie, putting the cream in a separate bowl and blending it with the melted butter. Then, I crushed the cookies in a zip lock bag. After they were crushed well, I poured the crumbs into the cream/butter mixture. This was the ticket. The crust went together very nicely. 

Another change I made was freezing the pie (or in this case, the cake) after each layer for about 25-30 minutes. This made it very easy to add new layers without them mixing into the others (presentation is half the fun!)

I'm already getting requests to make it again, and its not gone yet. I may experiment with different flavors. Golden oreos with vanilla pudding, mint oreos with chocolate pudding...a person could have fun with this :)

I love love love this recipe! I use it at every family reunion and they have started to demand I make two! I do change it a bit. I use at ten inch pie plate instead of nine inch. I use the whole package (36), I use about 8-9 in the top layer and the rest for the crust. I also use fudge chocolate pudding to add to the chocolatey taste. Super easy and love it!

This was a hit at a big family gathering. I doubled it and put it in a 13x9 pan to feed more and added halved strawberries on top. (Try it!) It was really yummy! Mine didn't look quite as nice as the photo.... But nobody seemed to notice! I will make again!

Wonderful recipe as written.  I used a deep dish pie pan and it worked out great.  For the pudding portion, be sure to follow these directions, not the box directions on the pudding.  Pudding should be VERY thick.  When I was buying ingredients, I was tempted to try the chocolate fudge version of instant pudding, but now that I've made the recipe, it is very chocolaty as written.  I found using a food processor and pulsing until the Oreo's were somewhat fine was easiest and the crust held up great.  It also made the Oreo's a nice texture to mix with remaining whipped cream as directed.   I did let it sit in the refrigerator overnight (24 hours before serving).  My guests raved, but in all fairness, my husband didn't think it was much different from a store bought frozen chocolate oreo pie if it was difficult to make (which it isn't).  My guests and I disagreed!!   I thought this was wonderful and a big hit for the kids.

I made this pie as directed but I used the peanut butter Oreo cookies. I highly recommend it. It would probably be good with the mint Oreo's and a drop of green food coloring in the top layer as a St. Patrick's day pie.

My family LOVED the filling. I made three of these pies for the holidays. The filling always turned out perfect. I used Jello brand Devil's Food Chocolate pudding and Extra Creamy Cool Whip. Yum! For pie 3,  I added an additional 1/2 cup of milk and had a fuller, 10 inch pie. I chilled the pies overnight before serving and they were great. I also used this recipe to make nine, individual layered desserts in 10 oz. plastic cups. The top layer with the blended Cool Whip and cookie crumbs was more of a garnish than a layer. Everyone loved the individual desserts

I was skeptical this would be very good, given the simplicity and limited ingredients. I was wrong, this was delicious! I used one large box of chocolate pudding with 1.5 cups of milk instead of 2 small boxes of pudding with 2 cups milk. But either way I'm sure is fine. If you are making it correctly it should NOT be sloppy. I think the other reviewers are using too much milk or are using skim milk. I used whole milk for best results. Don't go less than 2%. I did not mix my Oreos into the cool whip during the final step, opting to sprinkle on top for better presentation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used the mint Oreo cookies because those are our favorites, and it turned out to be very yummy! I was worried that I hadn't crushed the cookies up finely enough, but the crust solidified just fine. The preparation is messy, but it's very easy. I will make this again!

Made this pie last week and it was yummy!!! Easy to make but you must ONLY use 2 cups of milk. Do not prepare pudding as directed on pudding box. I did use a pre-made oreo pie crust and it still turned out very tasty! I let it set for 4 hours but it did seem like it needed to set more. The next day it was much better. I will be making this pie again tonight!

My daughter wanted Oreo Pie from Village Inn for her birthday, but they didn't have it at the time, so I looked up this recipe and gave it a try. I used a premade pie crust, but did the rest as directed. It was delicious. Everyone loved it! I don't like very sweet desserts, so this was perfect. When it comes to dessert, we usually end up throwing some out, but this entire pie was eaten within a few days. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious and almost too easy to make - I can see myself getting into trouble by making too many of these because they're so simple. :)

made as directed but refrigerated in between layers for about 1/2 hour for easier spreading. refrigerated for a bit and then froze for smoother slicing.
