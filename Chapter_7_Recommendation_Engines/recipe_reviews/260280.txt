This is lovely, particularly if youâ€™re keeping things light. My first attempt at using aquafaba, and it was a total success. The liquid had been refrigerated and only required 6 minutes to whip with my hand mixer. The taste is great, particularly topped with the raspberries suggested.

Whipping up the aquafaba it looked just like heavy whipping cream - I never would have guessed.  This was delicious and SO easy and a big hit with all my guests, not just the vegetarians.
