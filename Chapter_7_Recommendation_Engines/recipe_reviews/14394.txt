Too sour!  The peppers shrunk down and became mushy and the lemon juice dressing was almost too sour to eat.  Might be good with a different dressing, maybe italian or balsamic vinegarette.

good combination of ingredients but the quantities are WAY off.  For starters, even with my double oven I could not broil that many peppers in a batch.  I heeded the previous comment and reduced the lemon but I erred too much on the side of caution... 1.5 TBSP is not enough lemon for 12 peppers... see that?  I was 2 peppers short!
