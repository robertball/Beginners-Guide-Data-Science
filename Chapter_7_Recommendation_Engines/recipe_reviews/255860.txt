Simple and tasty! I did microwave my squash a bit before baking so it would be easier to cut in half and get a jump start on cooking, so it didn't take as much time for it to cook as the recipe said because of that. I only made 1 squash (2 halves) and eyeballed the sauce. This was really fun and I liked the minimal cleanup. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this for my mom and I. I poked it with a fork multiple times  and microwaved the squash for 1 minute to make cutting it easier. Because I was made extra sauce for others in the house that we not eating the squash I just eyeballed the sauce into the squash. It turned out very good and was very filling. Not like traditional spaghetti that has you hungry an hour later.

I had a bunch of cooked leftover veggies to use. After some debate I zeroed in on this recipe. I had never made spaghetti squash. It baked nicely then I heated the sauce in a pan with leftover cooked kale, sweet corn, and some black rice. It made for a nice sauce over the spaghetti squash. Next time will add red pepper.

Delish! Only thing I did different is I seasoned the squash first then added the sauce. Also I will add meat to it next time.
