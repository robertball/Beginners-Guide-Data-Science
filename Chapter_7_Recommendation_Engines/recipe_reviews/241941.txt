I was looking for  recipe that combined pork chops, apples and onions.  I sure did find it!  The spice combination is different from anything that I have ever tried and yet it is perfection.  Because I used thicker pork chops, I finished them off in the oven at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes.  Everyone raved about this dish that I served with mashed sweet potatoes.  This dish paired perfectly with a Chateau Ste.Michelle Riesling.  I will make this time and again.

Very tasty and easy. I love single-skillet dishes like this. I would recommend only using 1 tsp. of sage if you use ground sage, like I did. I also used apple cider instead of juice, since that's all I could find. I had bone-in pork chops, so the cooking time was longer, but everything came out perfect!

Cook times were right on, super easy to make, and everyone enjoyed it.
Putting the remaining spice/flour mix into the onions & apple juice is a must as it makes a nice glaze for the final heating of the chops.
Thank you so much for sharing!!!

Oh. My. Goodness. This was soooooo good! I only deviated from the recipe by leaving out the garlic  (I hate garlic), and I didn't have sage so I used basil. 
If you want your chops to turn out super juicy and tender, try using a cast iron skillet. The initial browning sears the meat, locking the juices inside. Mine ended up with a wonderfully crispy outside and a moist tender inside.
Also, the apples taste really good with rice.

Simply divine! I was pleased that it was not overly sweet. I substituted 1 tbsp molasses for the brown sugar (I was out) and 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, and a pinch of nutmeg for the allspice. I also diced the onion fine instead of slicing. A new favorite for sure!!

This reminds me of a dish from my favorite German restaurant, but possibly better.  The spice blend is perfect.  I was unsure about the allspice but it works.  Thanks, Patty

I was looking for something different but quick to do with pork chops and this fit the bill. The chops were tender and very flavorful. The sage really gave the meat excellent flavor.   My hubby is very picky and he loved it.  A definite keeper.

Definitely make again. Great way to use up those less than crisp apples and cook pork chops without them drying out. I summered it quite a bit longer than the recipe called for and the taste was terrific.

I used fresh sage and thyme from my garden and more apple juice than the recipe called for.  I was looking for a recipe for pork with apple and sage.  The onion was a delicious addition.  I made it twice already and plan to make it for a supper club I belong to.  It was a definite family favorite and we aren't crazy about pork so that's saying a lot.

This was a massive success! My husband is a chef and I am no great cook. He works long days, and I made this on a work night. He finished seconds and said he loved it. I served the pork with risotto that had a little dried sage and pepper stirred in at the end.

Made it exactly as recipe said. It was fabulous.  It also was moist and I was using thin chops. My 5 year old granddaughter loves it without the apples and onion mixture. Will make this again and again. Thanks.

This dish was quick and simple.  I like that.  I usually love apples and pork, but this was missing something.  If I make it again, I may add cranberries or something to perk up the flavor.   It did look good.

This recipe is a revelation! The flavors are amazing! One of my favorites now! Next time I’m going to try it without the flour, because it didn’t quite like the texture it produced.

Fantastic, yummy, easy.  I followed the recipe except used pork pieces instead of chops which worked very well.  I mistakenly used all the flour mixture to coat the pork instead of splitting it, which also worked well.  The recipe said simmer for 5 minutes at the end, but it took about 15-20 minutes to cook my chops through.  Very tasty

I pretty much followed the recipe but didn’t have apple juice so I cooked apples with 1/4 cup bourbon and 1/2 cup chicken broth for the sauce.   Side dishes were butternut squash ravioli and sautéed zucchini.  My wife and I loved it.

I've always been hesitant to cook pork chops, as I always overcook them until they are dry, but simmering them in the apple juice remedied that! My husband grew up eating apple sauce on his pork chops, and this was a sophisticated way to add a little natural sweetness and texture. 
If I could change anything, I'd thicken up the liquid a little, but the flavor was spot on.

Not a bad recipe. Quick and easy to make, but I think it'd be even better in a crock pot. I did double the flour mix though. The taste is sweet and savory. The sweet apple offsets the onion beautifully.

We really liked this dish. I served it over brown rice with a side of broccoli! I did not have apple juice so I used apple cider instead. I think that elevated the sauce as it was a little flat but tasty.

I like the flavor very much.  I like pork chops grilled so next time I’ll grill my chop and add it to the apples & onion to finish. 

Nothing is over powering; awesome combination

This was delish. I followed the recipe except I used fresh herbs (tablespoons instead of teaspoons) and added a splash of apple cider vinegar to counter the sweetness. What a way to use up a couple of rather sad Red Delicious apples. Will make again.

I didn’t have apple juice so I used apple sauce and a little water.  I used green apples for a little bite.  It turned out good.  The family liked it.

Very good! Substituted 1 apple with about 1/3 cup of applesauce. Cooked a little longer on low, so they got all happy with the sauce. So tender and juicy.

I've made a similar recipe in the past and found this looking for a recipe to jog my memory of the mix of spices used. I ended up making it with boneless skinless chicken breast instead of pork because the store was out of the pork chops advertised on sale, and it came out wonderfully well. I will try it with the original pork next time, but either way it's a keeper.

Really great flavors...I used Granny Smith apples and the tartness of the apples was really nice, if you are using "less expensive" cuts of pork, be sure to simmer a lot longer than the final 5 minutes to ensure they are nice and tender.  I'll be doing this one again, but will extend the final simmering time to ensure they are nice and tender...

This recipe yielded very tasty pork chops with a German flair. 
I was a little concerned about using my general-purpose, gluten-free flour mix for coating, because the flour has a bitter aftertaste, and without gluten, it doesn't thicken. I added a teaspoon and a half of cornstarch to the flour/seasoning mix and hoped for the best.
The seasoning concealed the bitter aftertaste well, but the "gravy" was still too thin, so next time I'll subtract a tablespoon of flour and add more cornstarch.

I've made this twice now, and boy oh boy is it good! My wife and 2 yr old daughter love it. The spice mixture is different from anything I typically use and is really interesting, in a good way, on the palette. My wife fork fight over the last few bites of the apple-onion-gravy mixture. The pork itself is good, but the aforementioned mixture might be the best part. The only change I made both times is adding an additional 50% more garlic. I discussed adding green peppers before I made it the second time and she said "it is so good, why change it?" so I did not do so. This recipe is a phenomenal addition to my cookbook.

I did use the ground sage and wisely decided to cut it to about 1 t. before I read the reviews.  We truly enjoyed this recipe and I will make it again.  My hubby and child both like it.

I made 1 chop so I cut the ingredients by 1/4, but still used one apple. I had a thick pork chop so it took longer than 5 minutes for the final simmer process, more like 20 minutes. The pork chop was very moist and went well with the apple/onion mixture. We'll make this again.

These were delicious, we usually have home made apple sauce with pork chops, not any more!!! The only change I made was, instead of apple juice, I used water.  Reason being, I didn't have any apple juice, it was still delicious.  I will definitely make this again, but will make sure I have apple juice.

This dish was perfect as is.  It was too cold and windy to light the grill so opted to go this route.  I will definitely use this recipe again as it was easy and delicious.  I think it would even be very good using chicken in place of the pork chops.

My husband and I loved this.  The only changes we make are:  1) I use only half the salt called for.   2) I use only 1/2 a large onion.  3). Because we love the sauce, I use only 3 pork chops.

Meanwhile, I fix a boxed pork stuffing.  When everything is prepared, I plate it by nesting pork chop on serving of stuffing, then lavishly spoon sauce over all.  This has become a household favorite.

I had some apples and pork chops, so looked up this recipe. Dang, was it ever good!! The only substitution I made was using Splenda brown sugar to keep the carbs down, but mmmmm-mmm - this was a hit. Served with roasted yellow squash from the garden :)

Delicious! Husband and kids ate it up. I doubled the recipe and used whole wheat flour instead of APF and it turned out great. I used a mandolin slicer for the onions and apples, but when I make it next time, I probably would not use the mandolin slicer for the apples, I think cutting the apple I to 1/8ths would work better.  Great recipe.

WOW!  Admittedly, I made modifications because I was using just what I had on hand--pineapple juice instead of apple juice and since my pork chops were leftovers, I choose to throw them in the crockpot and pour the sautéed onions/apples mixture over it.  A few hours in the crock and these chops were tender and falling off the bone!!  Absolutely delish!!

This was so easy and the flavors were magical. I didn't have fresh apples or apple juice so I used a can of apples and used the reserved liquid in place of the apple juice, tasted great. Thanks.

One of my favorite pork chop recipes, hands down. Flavors are amazing. Never would have thought of the allspice in there, but wouldn't change a thing in the mix. Onions and apples pair beautifully. Will be making this again very soon!

I did not make any changes. Nice flavor. I love applesauce with my meals and this is a 2 in 1 combination.

4 1/2 stars.  I have a tendency to over cook meat...especially pork.  Following the instructions to cook until 145-degrees, caused me to over cook the chops.  However, the flavor was still prevalent and we did enjoy them.  Next time, I will cook the chops less to avoid tough meat.

This was delicious! Even my son, who hates when I cook fruit with meat, loved it. Unfortunately I was out of sage and used "herbes de provence" instead, but it turned out fine. But I'm sure it will be better with sage.

I loved this recipe! I made a few changes: First, I used two large bone-in pork chops. I didn't have sage so I used 2 teaspoons of Herbs de Provence and 1/2 teaspoon of thyme (Herbs de Provence contains thyme, sage, and many other wonderful things). I didn't have paprika, so I used a pinch of red chili, and a few shakes of Garam Masala. I didn't have apple juice, so I substituted the same amount of sweet hard apple cider. I also added a few more cloves of minced garlic, because my wife and I love garlic. I followed the cooking instructions except the final bit, when the apple juice is added. I added the apple cider and extra flour mixture, and brought the mixture to a boil. Then I turned it down to simmer until the juice got a bit thicker. Then I poured the mixture over the chops in a Pyrex baking pan, then baked the whole thing for about 25 minutes. Check the pork if you use bone-in, make sure to cut near the bone to check the cook if you don't have a meat thermometer.

Really good recipe! I followed the flour mix exactly and just had to make the following changes: I had six decent size pork chops so no flour mix left over and I left it out at end. No apple juice so I used about 1/2 a cup of apple sauce and maybe 1/2 cup of orange juice. I also left out the brown sugar. I put all six chops back in the skillet, layered them with the apple/onion mixture and threw it in the oven at 350 for about 12 minutes.

This is what I wanted for dinner last night, but I didn't want to go to the grocery store so I used what I had on hand: bone-in butt chops and adjusted the cooking time accordingly; not enough sage so I topped it up with poultry seasoning; no thyme so I used oregano; no apple juice so I used 1/4 cup of Wellesley Apple Syrup mixed with 1/4 cup of Growers Apple Cider cooler. I added all other ingredients as written. These weren't major differences so I don't think the result was too far off the original, and it was absolutely delicious! Easy too. I will definitely make this again. Apples were made for pork chops.

I loved the idea of this, but the apple flavor came off a little overpowering.  I think I will substitute white wine or another acid instead of apple juice next time.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish.  I got a little confused at step 2 when it said 2 to 3 minutes more side.  That made me scratch my head!  Also, when I added the flour mixture, I had to add a little water as it got too thick.  After simmering 5 minutes, my pork chops were not 145 degrees.  I guess mine were a little too thick.  Overall, I'd make this again because we had 2 chops left over for another meal.  I'd say it is quite tasty.

Loved this recipe. It was not as quick to make as it seems due to all the slicing, but is worth the time. I did cheat and add a little maple syrup which was a good move according to my husband. Didn't take as long to bake (baked for about 45 minutes) because I did microwave the sweet potatoes (for about 2 minutes) before incorporating them in the dish. Pork chops were very tender. Just don't forget to cut the apple slices and onion a little on the thicker side of thin. They will hold up better in the dish. Worth the work!

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I made it  about like the recipe but used one large bone-in pork chop for the two of us.  The pork chop was tender and the apple/onion topping was delicious!

Love this recipe.  I added crushed fresh rosemary to the rub for the pork chops.  This is such an easy recipe.  I added a side of mashed baby Honey Gold potatoes with steamed spinach added.  We will enjoy it many times in the winter months.  We enjoyed a glass of Bordeaux with it.  Lovely meal.

I turned it into a braise recipe. After browning, it went into 250 degree oven for 1 1/2 hrs. Fall apart tender. I added additional chicken broth or water  as needed.

Amazing!! I tenderized my pork chops a little and put them in the oven at 350 after browning them, while I was making the sauce, because I used a bone in thicker pork chop.

I made it and the only problem was the flavor. It was a bit different. The pork chops, apples were great. I like the gravy also, but the taste or flavor didn't sit right for me.

I had bone in loin chops. Was delicious. Used extra sauce on white rice and had bacon wrapped asparagus with a little brown sugar as a side. Made no changes. Will probably make again. Thanks!

I didn't care for this at all....the sage overpowered everything. But my son really enjoyed it, so at least it didn't go to waste.

Thank you for this yummy recipe! I didn't change a thing. I did need to cook mine longer because my chops were thicker apparently, they were not up to 145 at the end of cook time. 
Hubs said add these in to your favorites. So we will be making them again!

I had such great expectations after reading this recipe; and then I got real excited after reading the reviews.  I couldn't wait to make it even though I knew going in I'm a lightweight when it comes to herbs.  Much to my disappointment it was too herb-y for my taste.  I prepared as stated except I reduced the salt by half and the sage to 1 tsp. and used a huge Granny Smith apple and apple cider since that's what I had.  It smelled wonderful while cooking and made me think it might be a good dish to prepare for company.  I still think so but I think next time I will reduce all the seasonings to 1/4 tsp.  I think that will work for my taste.  The cooking times for everything was perfect.  I'm hopeful the flavors might mellow overnight for the leftovers and since we ate all the stuffing I plan to serve them with mashed potatoes since they should also help cut the herb factor a bit.  In spite of my personal tastes, a very good recipe.  Maybe an extra tsp. of brown sugar?

This was really good.  I didn't have sage; sub'd oregano (because I like it).  Didn't have apple juice; sub'd white wine.

A little too herby for the family. The apples and onions in the sauce were yummy. Probably will not make it again.

Husband didn't care much for this dish. I thought it was just ok. We probably won't be making it again. I think it's probably just personal taste.

This was good.  But I'm wondering if I should have left the skin on the apples.  They seemed to go to mush a bit.  Loved the spice mixture but just found the apples sort of turned to apple sauce.  Will give it a go again.  Would love to hear how others sliced the apples.

Excellent recipe! I used whole cranberry juice instead of apple juice. It gave it a nice tang!

Awesome! We have never enjoyed a pork dish like any pork dish before. High reviews from us. Followed the recipe exactly. Gonna figure out how to do this with a pork loin.

It was delicious! I needed double or more of the apple juice to make enough glaze to cover the meat and rice(I put as a side item). I will be making this again!

Delicious and we'll received. I added 2tbsp Dijon mustard and sliced mushrooms.
