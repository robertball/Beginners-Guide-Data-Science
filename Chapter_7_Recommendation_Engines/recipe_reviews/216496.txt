I had to make small modifications in order to use similar ingredients I had available.  I did not use the optional maple syrup, preferred to use just the arborio rice, chicken broth rather than vegetable broth, and dried porcini mushrooms instead of the shiitake.  To accommodate a “cheese picky”  husband, I used the submitter’s suggestion to substitute Parmesan cheese for the gorgonzola.  (He doesn’t like that either, but I know it was the lesser of two evils for him so I kind of snuck it in) This was one of the best, most interesting side dishes I’ve had in awhile.   Wonderfully rich, complex blend of flavors.

I have just discovered allrecipes, and this is my fourth recipe. It is fabulous. I substituted a wild mushroom mix from Costco, and a wild/brown rice mix, also from Costco. Also substituted White Stilton for the Gorgonzola. It tastes amazing. Very versatile recipe.

Delicious!  I used fresh shiitake mushrooms and chicken stock because that's what I had and I probably should have cooked them before hand because the stems were a little hard.  Also, the wild rice didn't cook at the same rate as the arborio so it was a little hard.  In the feature I might partially cook it separately first.  Otherwise it was very good!

This was quite tasty. I didn't have Gorgonzola cheese so I used Parmesan instead and it turned out pretty good.

The only bad thing I can say is that I should have precooked the wild rice a little, since it takes longer to soften than arborio rice. So the wild rice is still a little hard, but still tastes amazing.

I followed the recipe to the letter, except instead of Gorgonzola cheese, I did use a mix of parmigiano reggiano and ricotta (for extra creaminess). The result was out of this world. I also added chicken breast to the final product to make it a meal.

I am giving five stars - but I did make a couple of changes. I had some leftover smoked teal (wild duck) breast that was wrappped in bacon, so I diced some of the bacon and added with the onions then I added the diced smoked duck breast with the roasted butternut squash. I used about equal parts squash and smoked duck. I also used parm instead of gorgonzola because that is what I had on hand - I live at high altitude so have to add more liquid and cook for longer as usual for high alt adj. but this turned out fantastic! The depth and layers of flavor is amazing! Will definitly try again.

I used dried mixed mushrooms because I have a huge container of them from Costco. I also had some other random variety of squash that I used in place of butternut. It takes a while to cook (being risotto), but it was worth the effort.

I tried this recipe using left over rice and precooked squash.  I did not have mushrooms, so used smoked oysters!  It turned out good, smoky and interesting.  Thanks for a great starting point.

This risotto is delicious even with only half the olive oil and no butter! I used organic chicken broth powder, fresh shiitake mushrooms, and hand-harvested 30-minute wild rice. I recommend Parmesan instead of blue cheese because of the overwhelming nature of blue cheese. The dish makes more than 10 servings!

Fantastic recipe! Made it with all Arborio rice but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. So pleased with the result. This is a keeper. Already thinking about where to fit it into the Thanksgiving menu.

Way too much work for a risotto.  Combining the two types of rice didn't add anything except frustration.  Wasn't that tasteful to warrant that much work.

I thought it was good but not great. Well, the bites that had gorgonzola in them were great, but the bites that did not I found too bland for my tastes. I'd love it if I could find a way to adjust to get the cheese flavor in every bite instead of one out of every five or ten.

One of my most flavorful dishes; so tasty each time I make it (3 times now)!  As another person said, it's a good idea to cook the wild rice for about 10-15 minutes beforehand, as it takes longer to cook than the Arborio rice.  I used cremini mushrooms, pecorino-romano cheese and chicken stock--all good.  Enjpoy!

I adore risotto.  This recipe is fabulously delicious.  Since I am not a fan of mushrooms I did leave them out of my dish.  I have never had a risotto dish that included wild rice and after reading other reviews, decided to leave it out as well so glad I made that decision.   It took about an hour to prepare properly but it was well worth the time and effort.   My husband couldn't stop eating it.  I was still preparing the entrée and he had already had 2 servings.  Plenty of left overs to enjoy next week.  I will be making this dish again.

This was a delicious dish but I would not use the wild rice again. The texture of the wild rice overpowered the dish and made it chewy. Unnecessary ingredient in my opinion.

Very tasty! The only thing I changed was using normal white mushrooms instead of shiitake. It is good either as a side, or if you add chicken/turkey as a main dish

Good mix of flavors, but the Gorgonzola kind of overpowers the squash. Next time I might try a milder cheese.

In a word: AMAZING! I made a few substitutions and had to play the cooking time by ear: used Orzo pasta instead of Arborio rice since I just couldnt find any, and canned mushrooms instead of fresh shitake (which I'm sure means itd be even BETTER with fresh mushrooms!!!), but it still came out absolutely FABULOUS! And the plus side was Orzo takes a much shorter cooking time. The flavor is pretty intense, so maybe better as a side than a main dish? The cheese makes this VERY rich and savory. SO GOOD!

I should have paid more attention to the review which mentioned that the wild rice needs more cooking time.  I was overall disappointed in this recipe.  I used Parmesan instead of Gorgonzola.  Perhaps if I had used the Gorgonzola I would have been happier with the overall taste.
