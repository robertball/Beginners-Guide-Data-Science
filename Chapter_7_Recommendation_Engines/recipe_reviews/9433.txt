The cookies had a nice flavor. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because 8 minutes of baking time is too long! My first batch I only baked for 7 minutes and the cookies were very crunchy. When I baked for 5.5 minutes they came out nice and soft. Otherwise, quite tasty!

Wonderful recipe!  I really liked that the cookies expanded when they cooked, so don't use particularly large cookie cutters.  They are the softest, best tasting frosted sugar cookie I've ever eaten.

I use this dough for candy canes, adding peppermint extract to the dough and the frosting, and topping it with crushed peppermint.  These are some of the best cookies I have had. practically foolproof, I am proud to add these cookies to my repitoire

This recipe has been in our family for years, 45 for my family and I don't know how far back it goes from there. Mother in Law, Grandma etc. We usually use vanilla but I am sure almond would be really good also. If you roll the dough super thin (that is the way we like them but watch the baking time) they will be crisp. If you roll them thicker they will be puffy and soft. I think they were meant to be thin. (about 1/4 inch. Please try. Worth the effort to get them right.

Everyone loved these cookies!  I found the dough to be a bit sticky, so cookie cutters were out of the question.  I ended up making snowmen out of them instead.  Next time I will refrigerate longer.  Thanks for the recipe!

I never have very good luck with cut out cookie.  Mine always taste like cardboard.  These, however, were fantastic!  I'm not a big fan of sugar cookies, but I couldn't stop eating these!  The only change I made was substituting lemon extract for the almond.  We will definitely be making these again!

I found that the refridgerated dough would not roll out for the cookie cutting. I ended up baking round cookies instead.  I baked them for 9-11 minutes and they turned out great, the centers were soft.

Yummy! The only reason I gave it a four is because I only cooked these for six mins and they were still a little crunch...I'll try four next time...but the taste is still delightful!

This is "NO baking soda taste" recipe that I had been searching for, for my Christmas cut-outs, my grandaughter, stepdaughter and I sprayed the old cut-out cookie tins with buttered flavored Pam every 4 or 5 cookies, cut the time down to 6 minutes per sheet, and we baked a couple hundred of these...They turned out FANTASTIC...We will use this recipe from now on...Thanks for sharing this one

We must have done something wrong because these cookies turned out too puffy for my taste.  I will be going back to my original recipe and won't make these again.

This is an excellent recipe. I have made it for over 40 years. It is my every holiday cookie. My children loved them and now my grandchildren love cutting out and decorating these sugar cookies.  As other reviewers have noted the cooking time can give you a crisp cookie rather than a soft one. I have found that I do the first batch on 375 then switch to 350. You have to watch the time beginning at about 6 minutes because the thickness of the cookie determines the amount of time it takes to be lightly golden brown. Crisp or soft they are always delicious.

Made 45 w/xmas cutters. I usually use sour cream recipe but I thought I'd give this a shot.  Very comparable, moist and tasty.  I will use again especially if I am out of sour cream.

Per the good reviews I made double the batch and added almond extract.   After chilling the dough for two hours, I got dough as hard as a rock. Litterally.    I had to crush it and warm the butter with my hands until it was workable.

Just the way we like it.  Some recipes just taste better with that almond flavoring and Christmas cutouts is one of them.  We had no problems rolling out the dough.  Now off to find the right icing.

I have made a lot of Christmas cookies before and this is the best recipe I have used! Thank you! There smooth surface is easy to decorate and so tastie! I love the way they hold up to icing kids can decorate without them falling apart!! Makes it lots of fun!  Hey I just wanted to add I use these every year and they are gone!  Even the people who don't like these types of cookies gobble them up.  Thank you so much for recipe !

These are really good. The perfect tasting sugar cookie. you will need to watch them closely while cooking. I recommend setting your timer for 5 minutes and checking every 30 seconds there after.

These are a big hit at my house right now. I had no nuts in my pantry, so subbed 3/4 cup semi sweet chocolate chips.

Easy to follow and tasted great! I didn't have cream tartar so I substituted some baking powder instead. I reduced cooking time to about 5 minutes and they were perfect.

These turned out very well.  Rolled them thin and they turned out nice and crisp.  Not too sweet with just a hint of almond.  Will make these again.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was still too sticky to roll after 3 hrs in the fridge. Then the cloth n flour idea did work either. So, I added a little bit of flour in an attempt to firm up the batter. After all of that frustrating mess, they weren't that good tasting. The constistancy was that of a pancake (the center of the cookie rose abit) and not sweet enough. Definately wont be trying this one again!

The cookies had a nice flavor but were nearly impossible to work with.

This is the same recipe that my kids great-grandma always made and they were wonderful.  I moved and couldn't find the recipe she gave me years ago and was happy to find it here! I do use a different icing, the kind (also found here) that dries hard and shiny.  Thanks again for posting a treasured recipe !

This recipe is not very good. I baked these cookies exactly the way the recipe stated, and my cookies came out horrible
