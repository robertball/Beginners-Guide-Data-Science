"Alexia's Lemony Vinaigrette" has a wonderful light tangy citrus flavor. I have made three citrus variations of this recipe: lemon; lime; and orange. Mine was beautifully flecked with both microplaned zest and mustard seeds because I used stone ground mustard. I also substituted honey for the sugar and assumed 3 ounces of fresh-squeezed citrus juice. This is a recipe I will make again many, many more times. Thank you Alexia Patramanis for sharing your recipe.

I paired this dressing with bowtie pasta and feta cheese to recreate a delicious lemony pasta that Nordstrom makes. (They add cubed chicken and arugula as well) The only edit I made was adding an extra tablespoon of lemon juice. Very good, will be making again!

Very simple and packs a ton of flavor! Agree with other reviews to add additional lemon. Will use again and again!

A very nice and light dressing to go over a salad of greens. I added avocado and pumpkin seeds ;
Thank you for the recipe.

Really good, thank you for the recipe. Like some of the other reviewers, I substituted honey for the sugar.

This is very good.  I would change the recipe as follows since the olive oil taste is a little overpowering:  1/8 cup of olive oil and 1/8 cup of canola oil.

I did not have Dijon mustard, so made it and left that out.  We did like it.  I had a lemon left from another project and did not want a dessert, so tried this.  I will be doing it again and will get some Dijon mustard and try it.

I really like the simplicity of this recipe.  I used honey rather than sugar and added a couple shakes of oregano, basil and dash of garlic powder.  Very good.  Thank you for sharing!
