Dear Maria,  Since chestnuts are not available in India,I tried this recipe with hazel nuts and cashew nuts.I powdered the nuts and mixed with butter and remaining ingredients.I used sugar substitute.The recipe came out very well and tasty.  Thank you.  Chhaya.

It was wonderful to have something from my childhood!!!  I also use a macadamia nut puree...and add other nuts like pistachio...you can also chop up some biscotti and add that!
