I tried this recipe with a yellow cake mix and it was incredible! The marshmallows had a beautiful look after they rose and started to brown and turn just a bit hard.  I would fully recommend trying this style of recipe with a yellow cake mix.. chocolate just seems a bit much.

This cake is quite good served with whipped topping on top.  Couldn't eat it plain though, it just needed something more.  Without the whipped topping it would be a three star recipe.  Something interesting that happens is the marshmallow end up on top, and the cherries end up on the bottom!  It makes for a really ugly cake, but tastes good.  I could possibly make this again.

very easy.... rave reviews from the people at work!  They loved it.  slices nice.  Next time will add a cup of chocolate chips and pecans on top toward the end of baking as I would want them to stay on top and not sink in.  Will make again as it is very inexpensive to make too.

I have made this recipe many times when in a bind for a quick dessert. So easy to make and the cherry pie filling makes the cake super moist. Great with ice cream or Cool Whip. I've also experimented with using German Chocolate and Dark Chocolate cake mixes. All great! This is definitely one of my favorite recipes and wonderful for kids or the beginner cook!

Super easy to make.  I topped my cake with chocolate chips as soon as it came out of the oven and let them melt for a few minutes and then spread them over the cake.  I topped with chopped nuts, too.   Then when serving I topped it with whipped cream.

WOW! This was incredible. The cake was super moist and full of cherry flavor. Don't know where the marshmallows went but they did their job. The cherries were throughout the cake and not stuck to the bottom like a regular black forest cake. Thanks, Pat.

I'm not sure what happened with my cake, but it was a complete disaster!!!  I cooked it for around an hour, according to the other reviews, but it sure didn't work!  ALl the cherries stuck to the bottom of the pan and it wasn't cooked enough on the inside but burned on the outside!  To top it off, the ruins didn't even taste okay!  I had to make an emergency run to the store to buy a birthday pre-made cheesecake!

For what it is, and that is quick and easy, this cake is a definite winner. My guests loved the cake, even when it was cold. Again, I agree with everyone else, the cake took me OVER an hour to bake, but it was worth it. I will make it again. 

Tip: If you looove dark chocolate, I used a dark chocolate fudge mix.

Great, quick option.  Can be made with chocolate or yellow cake and cherry or blueberry pie filling to suit your tastes.  Definitely has to be cooked closer to an hour than to 30 minutes.

This cake is soooo rich. The taste is good and moist, but it's extremely messy, and it's so heavy that you can only have a couple bites. I made this for Thanksgiving, and my family thought it was so-so. Only one person cleaned his plate, which is unusual in my family. It wasn't bad, but I probably won't make this again.

Interesting combo...you don't really taste the marshmallows.  It is very moist though.  It took more like 1 hour to bake.  Will make again.

This is a good cake.  However, most cake mixes are 15 oz. now.  Also, you can use just 4 cups of mini marshmallows for the bottom and drop pie filling by dollops on the cake batter (you don't need to spread).  I baked for 45 minutes - perfect.  If you want it to taste like a bakery, whip your own cream to top it.

So easy and delicious.  I found this same recipe in a TOH quick cooking  book and it says an hour to bake and that i what I have found works.  When cooled, I also top with heavy whipped cream that I add a dab of vanilla and sugar too when whipping up.   I have tried cool whip but the whipped cream version is to die for.

This cake recipe is awesome! I've made this many times for family and friends and everyone was so surprise of how great it taste. And, it's so simple to make! Great recipe.
