I shared this recipe with two of my friends for their input along with my own. By consensus, we agreed that the presentation was attractive, but there was still a bit of 'aftertaste', similar to chemical artificial sweeteners. The pancake consistency was not as 'cakey' as a pancake made with cane sugar, rather dense and heavy. This was my first experience with using a Stevia product. Thank you for the opportunity.

Hubby really liked this and the taste of the Pyure Stevia sweetener, for me it was a little too sweet but I am not a sweet eater.  Next time I would use 2 eggs instead of 4 as I thought it was a little too heavy and will rise better with a lighter batter.

Definitely turned out a lot sweeter than I am used to for baked pancakes. I didn't have a big enough cast iron so I saut√©ed the apples in a frying pan then transferred to a pan that was getting hot in the oven. I will try this again just add less pyure stevia next time I think
