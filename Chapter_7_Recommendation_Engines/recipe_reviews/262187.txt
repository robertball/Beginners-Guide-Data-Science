Sometimes simple is best and recipes like this prove that. I served this as a side dish and it turned out really good. I do think it could use some heat so next time I will add a pinch of crushed red chili flakes.

Easy and delicious.  I followed the instructions exactly. We had it to accompany a stir-fry but it  I would make it anytime as an interesting and pretty way to serve spinach.
