Great recipe for the leftover stuff. It tastes just like it sounds it would. If you like food that goes a long way "cost wise" this is it.

The kids really liked this. It's almost like a version we already did but we normally add 1/2 can of water or milk a splash of soy sauce and mix it in with some noodles. I will cut down on the bacon and add a splash of milk next time I make this as some other reviewers suggested. We also use a similar recipe to this but we top it with frozen tater tots and shredded cheese and bake it in the oven at 350 for 35 min. Oh the things one can do with ground meat and cream of mushroom soup. YUM

My family really liked this recipe. I think that 1 lb of bacon is too much though and will cut it back a little next time. It made it too salty. I also had to add just a dribble of milk to thin it down a little. Otherwise it was very good with enough left for lunch the next day. I will make it again.

Sorry to say but not very good at all. No real flavor and very heavy.

Wow this was heavy although I should have guessed as much. We ate it over rice and it was too much but I think as a sandwich it would have been easier. It was good! And the recipe is a good basis to play around with. Next time I will use ground turkey to lighten it up a bit.

As written I can only give this a 3. I love me some bacon but an entire pound would have been entirely too much. I used 4 pieces and instead of adding it back to the ground beef mixture I chose to keep it out and then just crumble a piece on top of each sandwich. To cut back on some of the heaviness I also did not add 4 slices of American cheese but used the shredded in a bag and again sprinkled over each sandwich rather than adding to the pot.
