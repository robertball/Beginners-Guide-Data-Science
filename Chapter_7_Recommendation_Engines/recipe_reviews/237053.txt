My toddler and I enjoyed this for lunch to use up leftover kimchi from another recipe. I scrambled the egg in like more traditional recipes and we liked that very much. Thanks for sharing!

Fried rice is such an easy classic, throw together meal with whatever odds and ends you may have. Since we have it regularly, I'm always looking for a different angle so it doesn't get boring. This recipe is great. I subbed a can of diced, fried-til-crispy Spam. I will be making this again and again. Everyone loved it!

I want to make it again and again, but unfortunately my husband and son didn't like it as much as I did (I guess because I'm a kimchee freak!)

I only used sesame oil, onion, salt n pepper, chopped kimchi  and also kimchi juice to make the rice looks red and the taste is kimchi dominant as well.. just try it and compare them

First time having kimchi...but it won't be my last! I loved the tangy flavor. When I first smelled it I wasn't so sure but the taste was very good indeed. I did not use canola oil, the ground beef has enough fat to cook the onions. I made without any pepper paste and it still had plenty of zing just from the kimchi. Thanks for sharing!
