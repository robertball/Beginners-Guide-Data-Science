I couldn't find the pumpkin spice pudding in August so I used French vanilla pudding. I added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice to add a little pizzazz! I brought it to the summer karate picnic and it was a big hit. So easy to make! I didn't take the bars out with the tinfoil to cool. Instead I let it cool in the pan. I just left it in and clean up was a breeze!!! I would definitely make these again.

This just says Fall! Love this! Next time cream eggs and cream cheese together then add other ingredients. Cream cheese will be smoother if done this way.

As another person said, I used french vanilla pudding mix and added pumpkin pie spice (which is cinnamon, ginger, allspice and nutmeg, if you happen to have all those things separate). I cooked mine longer than 40 mins (over an hr I would say),  the pumpkin/cream cheese layer was still not set, so it was maybe a little firmer on the bottom (more like cookie instead of cake, and I thought that was fine, tasted good!). Also, I may have added a little too much pumpkin, that could've been why it took longer. I cooked it until toothpick came out clean in the center. It was delicious!

Substituted a can of pumpkin pie filling for the canned pumpkin & pumpkin spice pudding mix - turned out fabulously! Next time I plan on putting a layer of chopped pecans between the cake & pumpkin layers

I made this for dessert tonight as a kind of trial run for my holiday baking. I have to admit that it was not what I was expecting. I was a little terrified that the cake layer on the bottom was going to be too sweet and that the pumpkin layer wasn't going to have enough sweetness. However, after it cooled and I iced it with that magic whipped cream it all came together for a great dessert. The whipped topping was my favorite part, lol. I also went ahead and added the cinnamon to the maple whipped cream. This was fabulous, thank you very much for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was YUMMMMY!!!! Everyone loved it!!!! The only thing  I did  different was I didn't line my pan and the baking time was a bit longer. I think lining the pan would just be if you want a neater appearance. I just cut it in to bars. Had lots of compliments on this recipe!!!

These were AMAZING and got rave reviews!  As some of the other reviews indicated, I had to bake at 350 degrees for just a little over an hour. I will definitely make these again!

Really good recipe. Took a bit longer to bake for me.  People are it up. Added a bit more maple syrup to the topping.

I made this recipe, and it was awful. It took more than 40 mins.
And it Still did not get done, I had to put it down the garbage  disposal.
