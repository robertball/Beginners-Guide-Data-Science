Very, very good Marisa! I didn't have any bean sprouts on hand, so I threw in cucs and grape tomatoes. I only put in a tablespoon of sugar and it was fine. I also added onion powder, a bit of dill and a touch of italian seasonings. Thanks so much!

Like others, I changed this a little.  I added a tablespoon of olive oil instead of the half cup of salad oil, and left out the onion.  It was absolutely delicious, I will definitely make this again.

Very good! I omitted the sprouts and added almonds instead. I also didn't realize this was a marinate overnight dish, so I ate it about 1 hour after refrigerating. It was delicious!

I ended up altering this recipe a bit but never would have thought to add the ingredients that the recipe called for if I had not read it first.  I took out the sprouts and substituted olive oil.  I served it for Christmas and almost everyone ate some..even with allll the other non green food on the table. (my family is mainly meat and potato eaters..no greens)

This makes a quick winter "salad."  If you don't like sweet pickles it's probably not for you, but then you'd know that from the vinegar and sugar in the recipe.  I like to add water chestnuts for some crunch.

I used olive oil, fresh bean sprouts, and I added Splenda until it was as sweet as I wanted. I refridgerated it for about six hours and served it slightly chilled. Not bad at all. Thanks, Marisa!

This was pretty good! I did reduce the sugar b/c we mostly eat on the healthier side during the week. I just sprinkled some in and tasted until it was a slight sweet taste. I think I would leave out the sprouts next time and maybe add some grape tomatoes or something, as I felt there was too much of the same texture going on. All in all, this was a nice quick side. Thanks for sharing. :)

this was good. but it made too much for 2 people and it's not as good as a leftover. will make again, but not all the time.
