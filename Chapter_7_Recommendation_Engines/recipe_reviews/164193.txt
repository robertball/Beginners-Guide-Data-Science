I don't know who could possibly eat this and actually enjoy it.  I cut it in half, and cut down even more on the cayenne and it was still not unedible.  The veggies were the only good thing in this, and thats because it was just stirred in right before serving.  I will never make this again!  If I could give no stars I would.

I modified this recipe.  First of all there was too much liquid for the amount of rice used and salt .  I cut it down to 2 cups (2:1) and halved the salt.  I used 1 cup chicken broth.  I also added 3-4 pods of cardamom in the oil with the onions, etc. for more aromatics and flavor.

This was a great recipe, however, there are some serious typos in it.  2 cups of rice to 4 cups of water!  The word tablespoon was substituted for the cayenne, salt and black pepper.  It should have read teaspoon.  This would be a great vegetarian meal if you double the veggies.

Don't pass up this recipe! It is very delicious. I changed up some of the ingredients to use what I had on hand but maintained the soul of the recipe. As for the method, I cooked everything together in a wok and then added two cups of water. When that had cooked, I added the other two cups of water. I didn't use any salt and used 2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I also used fresh turmeric and ginger root. This recipe is nice, with some minor changes it is a 5 star recipe. It made enough for 8 people, so adjust according to your needs.

I cut back on the cayenne to only a small dash and the black pepper to only half a teaspoon and it was still quite spicey, but good. Also added just a little honey as the dish seemed a little bitter - was quite good after that. FYI the amount  of water needed, and the cook time for the rice will vary depending on altitude and average humidity levels for where you are, so be careful not to add those vegies too soon.
