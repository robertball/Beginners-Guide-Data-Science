I have made this recipe twice now and have been very pleased. We had company both times and not only did we eat it all, they each asked for the recipe. The only thing i did different is i used the Diced Tomatoes with Basil already in it instead of using fresh basil. Delicious. The LORD IS GOOD! THE LORD IS TRUSTWORTHY! LET US GLORIFY HIM TODAY.

The flavor is good.  It just isn't too different from other quiches.  I will make again just for my husband & I, it just isn't special.

Probably one of the tastier quiches I've ever eaten.  The canned tomatoes, however, acquired an odd texture in the baking process.  Perhaps it would be wise to substitute fresh cherry tomatoes next time.  I also added broccoli for more bulk.  If you are not using a deep dish pie crust, expect to have two quiches on your hands!
