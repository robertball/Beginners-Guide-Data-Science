I found this recipie absolutely delicious. It was a little bland at first, so I added a bit more balsamic, crumbled feta cheese and was generous with the salt & pepper

Twice a year I go on retreat up to the mountains. I have the privlege of preparing dinner for 75 - 85 people on a Saturday night. I have been doing this for a number of years and I am always searching for something a little different. I made this dish on a lark and man oh man did everybody love it. What a great combination of ingredients that resulted in a uniquely flavored dish and the visual appeal was second to none. My friends just raved about it and it literally was all gone in a number of minutes. Thanks for the great dish. P.S. I am preparing it again today for a Pittsburgh Steeler party at a friends.

This cabbage salad is a nice variation from the usual apple-cabbage salad. My husband and I enjoyed this with pork chops and small roasted new potatoes.I will definitely be making this again.

Easy, great colour not just for "high holidays" I served it with Tuna steaks in a wasabi marinate, you can do it ahead and just heat it up in a skillet a large one!  Real crowd pleaser, not really kid oriented, it's cabbage remember.

I really liked this recipe! It was fun to make, smelled delicious the whole way through, and tastes very good. I used a little more than a cup of apricots instead of the 3/4 that the recipe called for. I also used white onion instead of red. The final result is pretty, and it tastes very good.  It is unique, sweet, and a little tangy. I would recommend.  :-)

This was different for us but we both had it with lamb chops and found it great.  It won't be eaten that often, but a great receipe to have.

I made this and took it to a large party. Everyone raved about it. It smelled and tasted delicious. They ate two bowls full of it!! Everyohe wanted the recipe. You can put less preserves in if you want it more savory (I cut the preserves, but added more chopped apricots) and be sure to add the salt and pepper, which heighten the taste.
I always taste as I go to avoid the "too sweet" thing that afflicts many recipes. I may have added a little  more onion as well and I know I had cabbage left over and threw that in there, too.

I liked it overall, my husband liked the flavor but not the texture and my 5 year old gagged on the small cabbage strings.  Not the most kid friendly but I expected that.  Has a great Chutney flavor with the spices used.  Did only 2T butter to make it a bit healthier and half a head of cabbage.  Sliced the cabbage and half an onion thin on my mandoline, and chopped the apricots with a knife.  Nice change for a side dish.  Added it to my turkey meatloaf dinner. Wouldn't change a thing!

This is a very tasty way to enjoy red cabbage! I decreased the butter to 2 T and the preserves (actually used some mystery jelly from well-meaning relatives) to 2 T, and used dried mixed fruit, which happened to include some apricots, but also apples and pears. The point is: you won't miss the extra butter, and if you don't have the precise ingredients, you can probably make do with something already in your fridge. Enjoy!

I borrowed another reviewer's idea and added feta cheese. It was tasty and looked pretty as well.

I enjoyed this, but BF quit after a few bites--and he eats everything (hence the 3 stars instead of 4). I'd make some changes for personal preference: use about a quarter of the apricots (I used unsweetened and unsulfured, which are a bit more tart and too strong in this dish), half the spices, and twice the onions (which I caramelized). The onions, while sweet themselves, really helped balance out the sweetness and tang of the sauce. I used olive oil instead of butter. Overall, a very interesting dish!

I made this for lunch one day. I just used more of the apricot preserves, because I had no dried apricots. Everyone loved it. Much better than the usual red cabbage & apple recipe.

This was very simple to make and really terrific tasting. I didn't have allspice, so I used pumpkin pie spice and added some mace and white pepper. My boyfriend absolutely loved it and I will certainly be making it again. I served it with sweet chicken sausage, and it was a perfect pairing. My one suggestion would be to chop the dried apricots into small bits, rather than just slicing them.

Really yummy - I substituted celery for the capsicum (as I didn't have any caps) and sprinkled sesame seeds through the whole lot....  am taking the leftovers cold for a salad lunch at work tomorrow.

I followed the recipe exactly -but it was a bit too sweet for my liking, sort of like a "candied" taste.  I am going to wait a while and try it again with just a drop of preserve for flavor or none at all.

Didn't really like this. The flavours of nutmeg & all spice in a savoury dish just didn't work for us. Won't be making again.

This is a very mild cooked red cabbage dish considering it has allspice, nutmeg and balsamic vinegar.  I think I would coarsely chop the apricots in the future, so that you can get a little apricot in each bite.  I prepared this exactly as written, but ended up adjusting the seasonings and adding a little more balsamic just to suit our taste preference.

What a beautiful and tasty way to use red cabbage! The flavours were wonderful and I made the recipe as listed but when tasting it there seemed to be something missing. I know it sounds weird but I added a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce and it gave it that little bit of umpf that made people go back for seconds and my mom ask for the recipe. Feels good when mothers start asking daughters for recipes... Thank you for sharing!

I cut this recipe down to 4 serving. I used fresh apricots, so I put in 3/4 cup. It was a little sweet for me, but my husband loved it.

I used home dried plums in place of apricots, peach jam, yellow onion, green cabbage and olive oil - 2TBSP.  Since I changed the recipe so much, I won't give it a star rating.  However, the recipe is a nice sweet n'sour cabbage with interesting spices.  I look forward to trying it with dried apricots.

We served this with our goose at Christmas and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I didn’t have ground allspice on hand so I substituted pumpkin pie spice in its place. As others noted, I omitted the preserves and found the recipe had a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness. This is a keeper.

Absolutely delicious!!! I added a bit more allspice, nutmeg, and apricot preserves-next time I think I will double the amounts.
Wonderful taste with just the right amount of sweetness. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I love cabbage both green and red. I made this using plump raisins and a teaspoon of brown sugar. My wife loves this one, so, I make it once a week.

Good with fresh apricots and honey substituted for dried apricots and preserves.  Good with coarsely minced and fried pork on top with a side salad for a full meal.

My family loved it!!! Even my picky eater!!  I thought it was too sweet so I would cut down on the preserves, maybe even down to a tablespoon or 2. I used half the butter called for and it was still great.  Thank you!!
