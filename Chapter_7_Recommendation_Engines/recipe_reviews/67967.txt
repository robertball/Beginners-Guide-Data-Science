This was absolutely a wonderful recipe.  If you have children, this would be fun to make with them since no baking is involved.You can also use tart cups with graham cracker crust to make individual treats

I made a few of these for a polynesian themed potluck at work.  It was nice and light, would be perfect for summer.  Even after chilling overnight, the filling didn't set all the way and was a little messy.  The flavor was good though, if I make it again I'll omit the bananas as they spoiled VERY quickly- not very tasty or pretty!

Thought this recipe was really tasty, and I will be making it again.  It's nice to finally get a recipe that others,aside from yourself enjoy
