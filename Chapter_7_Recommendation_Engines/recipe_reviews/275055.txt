This is a delicious summer dish! It smells amazing on the bbq. I paired it with cilantro lime rice and a nice white wine on a summer night - yum! I took the chefs advice and used the jumbo shrimp. A good idea if you are making this as a main dish. Will definitely make this again.

Made this twice now. Family loves it. Served over coconut jasmine rice. At minimum double the sauce. I’m going to quadruple it next time.

I had to omit the ginger and garlic because my husband is on warfarin and I used pineapple juice instead of water. Delicious.

Came out very well, no leftovers. I served with rice. My jumbo shrimp cooked well, but my sauce was a bit thicker than I expected. next time I'll double the sauce.

Don't know if I did something wrong but after cooking, it tasted like the shrimp had a pasty texture to them.
Flavor was good and the grilled pineapple was excellent.

Very disappointed.  Recipe was easy but tasteless.  It definitely needed something to kick up the taste.  Won’t make again.

Like one of the other commenters stated, the larger the size of the shrimp is better for a skewer but you can go as low as 31-40 count size. I have done it with 51-60 count but you need to put a lot more shrimp on the skewer (almost double), plus the smaller size shrinks to tiny shrimp when cooked. Great for the grill this recipe or the oven.
