VERY, VERY easy.  The only thing you have to wait for is the milk and butter.  A little grainy but overall pretty dagone good.  The chocolate kinda overpowered the cinnamon so I added a little more.

I cut this recipe in 1/4, and it turned out to be an awesome fudge!  Great for a chocolate craving.  I added a little extra cinnamon.

This is a nice twist on an old favorite!! The flavor reminds me of mexican hot chocolate. I skipped the nuts, and it was just wonderful! The key to this recipe is to make sure you use butter, not margarine. Otherwise it will not set.  Also, since I used my butter right out of the fridge, I melted it first and then added the milk until it was just about to simmer.....Thanks again!!

Loved the added flavor of the cinnamon. A little on the sweet side, but still very, very good.
