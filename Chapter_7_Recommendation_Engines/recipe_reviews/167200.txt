I wanted to try this recipe because it looked so interesting. It turned out delicious! A whole cup of orange zest is an extremely large amount, and I only had three oranges so I could only get about 2/3 of a cup. It did take a lot longer to cook on the stove than the recipe says. I think it was about 30 minutes altogether, not counting assembling the cake ingredients. The cake did turn out a bit crumbly, but it is so delicious warm out of the oven! I recommend it with a light powdered sugar vanilla glaze.

Great bread recipe!  Mild orange flavor, fantastic aroma, great consistency!  My only change was adding an extra tablespoon of butter.  I will make this again.

I was curious to use whole 1 cup of orange zest.  this one was fairly easy to make but i'm not sure if the flavor is that great. It's not bad but not as moist/tasty as i wanted it to be.

I was looking for an old-fashioned recipe when I came across this.  Turned out perfect. I was worried there was not enough butter to make it moist but it was great. Would be nice with an orange drizzle or and fruity cream cheese spread.

I needed a moist flavorful recipe.  Once I added a simple glaze (1/4 c butter, 2/3 c confectioners sugar and 1/3 c orange juice melted & mixed well) to the bread as it came out of the oven, this was wonderful!!!

Made exactly as written.  The kitchen smelled wonderful as it was baking and could hardly wait until it was finished.  Ate this with some hot orange spice tea for a nice change on a Sunday morning;  we all  enjoyed it very much.  May try a little chocolate glaze next time.  Thanks for sharing, Bob.

Loved it! I now know how to candy orange peel the easy way thanks to this recipe, and I was pleased this sweet loaf bread had the right amount of sugar (read: not too much & appropriately sweet) to offset the slight bitterness of peel throughout.

I made this recipe with homemade, previously prepared  candied lemon peel instead of orange zest (lemons gifted by a very nice neighbor.) Baked it in two small loaf pans for 45 minutes, and added loritab123's glaze made with lemon juice.  Bread was a beautiful yellow color, and absolutely delicious!  Wish I could share a picture, but the bread disappeared too quickly!
