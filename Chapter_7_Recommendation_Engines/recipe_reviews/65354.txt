followed the recipe to the T.  I questioned the amt. of vanilla but figured there must be a good reason why the 1 tbsp.  Don't cut down on the vanilla...this amt. makes the cookie!  I used a good Mexican vanilla and it really combined so well with the p.b.  They are soft and light with a slight crispy edge.  Thanks for the advice regarding not overbaking.  They will not look done when you take them out but you can see them brown slightly around the edges right before your eyes as you let them sit on the sheet for a minute or two.  Easy to slide right off the sheet without any greasy taste.  Lovely cookie but if you have a houseful of cookie monsters, you might want to double the batch.  This made 54 cookies with the pampered chef small size scoop.

Excellent! Have been using this recipe for years and they always come out perfect.  Wonderful presentation and texture (they actually make me look like an accomplished baker). 

Suggest following the recipe including the 1T vanilla (great flavor), the crisco (don't use butter-it takes away from the texture).  Cookies will not look finished after 7-8 min but take them out anyway.  Suggested add: milk chocolate chunks.

Unlike the other users, I found this recipe not at all appealing.  The cookies tasted like I put a spoonful of salt in my mouth.  Perhaps the salt measurement was incorrectly typed at the website?  3/4 tsp. is a bit much.

I loved them !!! Pulled them out of the oven , cooled for 2 minutes and they melted in my mouth. Can't wait til the Hubby gets home to try them out , he is going to be the real test. This is one recipe I will never lose. I used 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening and added a spoonful extra of peanut butter , plus about 2 tablespoons extra flour , but only if ya add the extra peanut butter . Thanks for the reviews , your comments helped me to Bake the BEST Peanut Butter cookies EVER !!!!

These cookies were fantastic! They truly tasted like something I had as a child in my great grandmothers kitchen. If your craving old fashioned peanut butter cookies these are great. I used real butter in place of the shortening and they were excellent!

Well, I'm just going to have to join the rest of the rave reviews this recipe has already gotten! The reviews previous to mine are all absolutely correct in their assessment of these being the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had! I have been using a family recipe on my husband's side for peanut butter cookies for years and had to admit that I was very nervous to try something new, knowing my husband absolutely loves the peanut butter cookies from the old recipe, but I threw caution to the wind, and BOY am I glad I did! Wow! These cookies have been sitting on the table all day long and they are still soft and fresh!(The old recipe cookies would have been as hard as rocks by now.) I didn't have JIF peanut butter, but the peanut butter I did have worked fine. These are truly wonderful cookies and it will replace the old family recipe. :) Thank you so much for sharing this recipe here!

The cookies dont look done after 7-8 minutes but take them out anyways.  These are good cookies but not a sweet cookie like I thought they would be.  I love the chewy texture though!

After 8 minutes, they might not "look" done, but take them out.  They will stay soft and delicious for days

One of my favorite peanut butter cookies and the very first one I ever made! This is also good with half granulated sugar in place of the brown and real butter in place of the shortening, if you aren't a shortening user, like me. My oven runs a little hot so 375* is a little too warm. 350* for about ten minutes is just right for me. Best let these cool for a couple minutes on the baking sheet as well, otherwise, they'll get cranky with you and break apart. I've learned that using Jif (or Skippy) peanut butter is necessary for this particular peanut butter cookie recipe. I've tried making this with off brand or cheap peanut butter and the cookie either comes out greasy, crumbly and is really just a huge mess. Stick with the name brands. Trust me.

This recipe ends my search for the perfect peanut butter cookie - though I did tweak it ever so slightly.  I substituted a good quality butter for the Crisco and used only 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Overall a tasty cookie with a marvelous peanut butter flavor!

I made this recipe almost exactly, the only exceptions being that I increased the peanut butter amount to a full cup and cut down on the salt a bit (1/2 tsp).  Soft and chewy---DELICIOUS!

read the reviews.  everyone's taste is different but i too thought they were rather bland and would've preferred a more peanut butter taste to them.  followed directions exactly.  beautiful presentation - good texture and soft/chewy but know, they are on the blander side.

I've been looking for this recipe!  The cookies are really chewy and yummy.  Very peanut buttery!  I like to dip the tines of a fork in sugar and then make the crisscrosses.  Don't overbake!

Love these.... and they ARE irresistible! I made them with the Butter Flavored Crisco sticks the first time and real butter the second time. Either way they are the best PB cookies I've ever made. Oh... I rolled them in white granulated sugar before putting them on the parchment covered baking stone and forking them. Some of them got a few M&Ms on the top, others I did plain. They are all great! BTW I love the parchment paper. Now I don't have to wait til my cookies cool and I don't mess them up when I scrape them off of the stone.

Yum!  Just took my last batch out of the oven... these are really good.  Didn't use Jif (sorry, Jif) but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  SO good... not "too" anything... not too sweet, not too peanut-buttery, not too bland ... JUST PERFECT!  My new favorite PB cookie recipe!

These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made!  I made these for a weekend trip with some friends and didn't even bring any home!  They were great for breakfast!  I followed the recipe exactly as printed.  I took my cookies out of the oven as soon as they started to brown and they were perfect.  They are slightly crunchy on the outside and very soft and chewy on the inside!

I have used this recipe for many years and even won a "Best of Fair" ribbon 10 years ago with it!  Just for fun, I add Hershey's Kisses to the top of the cookies when they are just out of the oven.  These are everyone's clear favorites.

These were very soft and peanut buttery.  However, I would have liked a sweeter taste, maybe next time I'll add kisses on top--something to satisfy my sweet tooth better.

I'm not a name brand person so I didn't have JIF or Crisco.  I used store brand peanut butter and butter.  Came out great!  Love the texture and the softness.

I love peanut butter and peanut butter cookies and have tried several recipes in search of the perfect one. None have been that special until I tried this one! My family and friends all agree that this is "the one".  In fact, I just threw  my other peanut butter cookie recipes away to avoid any confusion! These are delicious!

was good, but not great. Flavor was good, but texture not my favorite.  if you like a really soft cookie, you will love these.  I baked for 10 minutes and they were still moist and soft.  If that is what you are looking for, then this is a good cookie, cuz it really did taste good.  I rolled mine in white granulated sugar before baking and followed the 375* instructions.  I might try these again, but will experiment with a longer baking time.  No worries with the salty taste others complained of because I used self-rising flour and skipped the rising agents. Not a bad cookie, at all.  My son and hubby loved them and that makes me happy, but I would not "show these off" as an example of my best baking. I like a chewier, "toothier" cookie. My daughter loves soft cookies so she will love them, I know!

Wow - Super Salty! I had read it in a previous post, but always make my first batch per the directions. 3/4 tsp is too much. Next time, I'll try 1/2 tsp and go from there. Other than that, very delicious. This is the recipe on the back if the Hershey kiss package and they recommend rolling them in sugar prior to baking. Super yummy!

This is a fantastic recipe and a perfect traditional peanut butter cookie - just like they are supposed to be!  For me the key is not to overbake and not to leave them to cool too long on the hot cookie sheet.

A good cookie, but a salty aftertaste, and the center was gooey (I guess that's ok if you like that kind of cookie).  I recommend reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp. and using 3/4 cup brown sugar +1/2 cup white sugar.

I love this recipe! I have tried others to see if I can beat this one and always regret that I didn't make these to begin with. No more trying for me...these are easy, tasty and fool proof! Nice slightly crispy outside, warm chewy inside. Perfect mate for a glass of cold milk! Mmmm... ENJOY!

This has been my go to PB cookie recipe for years. I do not like to cook with shortening but really this is the best out there. To make it taste even better reduce the salt to half a tsp and add 1 cup salted spanish peanuts (skin on). So good.

We loved this cookie!  I made a few changes because the reveiws said it wasn't sweet enough or peanut buttery enough but they turned out great.  My husband has alredy eaten all but 5 of the cookies and I made them yesterday while h was at work.  I will make this again.  Probably tomorrow.

I was not happy with this recipe. There was not enough PB taste. I don't think the 1 tlsp. vanilla affected the taste but I never saw a recipe with this much vanilla. More than likely, I will not make again.

these are at best ok. I liked the texture, soft and chewy, but they were not sweet enough and not peanutty enough ( and I used a full cup of PB). They are ok if you prefer a not as sweet, not as peanutty pb cookie....i dont think my husband or kids will like it, so I doubt ill make it again.

I used real butter and 1/2 the vanilla called for. I was told by a PB cookie lover these were the best PB cookies he had ever had, and when he brought some to work, everyone asked for the recipe! Easy & delicious!

These cookies made an extremely stressful day much easier to bear, it's impossible to stay upset while trying to make fork prints! Easy to make, no mixer necessary, also using plain crisco. Cooked about 9 minutes.

I LOVE this recipe!!! We doubled the batch, added milk chocolate chips to half and peanut butter chips to the other half. They were fantastic either way!

These are rich, soft, and chewy and my husband rated them "6 or 7"! I used part WW pastry flour and followed the recipe exactly. I have tried other peanut butter cookie recipes on this site, and even though they were all excellent, I think this one is the best. I ended up baking about 9 minutes, but be sure & check at 7 and 8, depending on your oven. I always have Jif in my pantry, and I used extra crunchy. I added chocolate chips to part of the dough and it took them way over the top--Delicious!!

Several years ago my sister told me about this recipe on the back of Jif's Peanut Butter jar.  Now its the only one I use.  My family loves them.  Although I believe that the recipe should state that you when you remove the cookies, you need to "cool" (not cook) them for 2 minutes on the cookie sheet, before removing them to foil to cool completely. I hope you enjoy them as much as we do.  They are my little one's favorite cookie.

I made this recipe last night.  So, wanted a good peanut butter cookie.

I cooked then just as instructed.  They were great if you like a soft cookie.  Then, I baked the next batch for 13 minutes instead if eight, milk wouldn't even absorb in the cookie.

Disappointed.

Flavor was good, just not a good dunkin cookie.

Our family loves this recipe!  The only modification that we found to be helpful is to make the peanut butter a full cup!  Then we add a Hershey kiss to the top immediately when we take them out of the oven : )  DELICIOUS!

my husband thought they were great!!  Instead of the salt and soda I used self rising flour so I didnt have the too salty issue.  added a little more pb(just my preference). Other than that followed recipe.  My own opinion is that they were too crumbly and I could taste the sugar grains. Maybe I didnt cream the crisco and b.sugar long enough.  I will try again using butter instead of the crisco.  good quick recipe!!

I followed this recipe using reduced fat Jif peanut butter. The cookies turned out very mild. Everyone who tasted them said they could use more peanut butter and sugar. Keep this in mind if you like a strong peanut butter flavor. The texture was soft and pleasant, but they might need an extra minute or two in the oven.

My entire family loves these soft,though crisp around the edges when they first come out of the oven (love that part of the cookie), chewy peanut butter cookies. I make giant ones to sell in my bakery. They are very popular.

I did not care for this recipe. Its crumbly, lacks peanut butter taste, and just bland.
UPDATE: 3/7/11 - After my first try, I just couldn't get this cookies off my mind and had to find out if it was me or the recipe. Well folks, it was definetly ME. I made this cookie again, tonight, and they are delicious, peanut buttery, and soft. I added a few chopped peanuts for more of the peanutty taste. In my first try, the cookies were like clay, maybe I forgot to add something. So glad I tried again. Yummy!!!

I got this off of the back of a Jif jar. Good basic recipe. I like my cookies a bit sweeter though. They were also pretty salty with the baking soda and salt. Also, you are supposed to drop them onto the cookie sheet, so mine didn't turn out so round and perfect! But I have to say, even with all these criticisms, I am still enjoying these soft cookies with lots of milk!

Not a fan. Followed the recipe to a "t" and mine were dry and crumbly, and definitely lacking in the taste department.

I don't even want to give it a 1. I followed the recipie to a "t" and these were the worst cookies I have ever had. only baked 1/2 the dough and threw the rest out along with the cooked cookies. They were super dry, crumbled when you touched them, and had no flavor.

Just made these and Hubby loves them!  They are not too strong, nice and mild with a great texture.  Stay true to the cooking time like the other reviewers say, it works :)

I used a little more peanut butter than suggested and they came out great, still soft the next day! My only concern was they were a little too flakey in appearance.

This cookie was really good. I like a thick, soft peanut butter cookie. This recipe made them just as I like them! The only change I made was to substitute half the shortening with butter and decrease the salt to 1/4 tsp. I also dip half the cookie in melted chocolate to dress them up a little. Definitely recommend this recipe!

I worked them by hand, because i'm old-fashioned like that. Upped the peanut butter to 1 cup. Used butter instead of sorthening. Beat the egg a little before adding. Used white wheat flour instead of the all-purpose. Used turbirado sugar instead of brown sugar. Lowered the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, because i don't like using a lot of salt. The cookies turned out chewy, didn't really taste too much like peanut butter, but i still liked them.

This was very good! I actually didn't have an egg to use, so I was like, "What do I do with this now?!" and fortunately, we had some tofu, and I just used some tofu to replace :P  It still ended up very nice, light and also had a moist texture that was a bit chewy!  At first I wasn't sure if I should take it out after around 8 minutes, but I did. It was perfect, but mine was a little bit droopy in the beginning because it was still hot, but as it cooled, it actually stayed in shape, haha.   There was a lot of cookies, so I cut them all into little cubes and will bring them to school to share. :) I will make this again one day, for sure!

Made these yesterday, they are okay but not sweet enough.  Without any granulated sugar they are a bit tasteless and have no crunch.  Won't make again.

Really excellent and simple recipe.  The only thing I changed was I used half butter, half shortening because I didn't have butter-flavored shortening.

This is a really great recipe, I am by no means an expert baker, but I followed the recipe and it was wonderful. Just remember to wet your fork and dip it in sugar, otherwise it will stick to the cookies.

I have made peanut butter cookies for my Dad for his birthday for many years.  I have NEVER used any other!  The cookies turn out perfect if you follow the recipe exactly and be sure not to over bake them.  This year, I'm going to add choco chips to one batch and see how it goes.  By the way, Dad has no teeth and these are perfect for him!!

I just got married and wanted to impress my husband with a nice batch of fresh cookies. I am new to the whole 'kitchen' thing and was worried about the outcome. These cookies came out perfect first time, really easy to make, really tasty. Only one problem, I don't know how I can top this!

These were great.  I used real butter and 1/3 less sugar.  I tried them with and without hershey kiss tops (as someone had suggested).  They were hit.  My only complaint, they were so "melt in your mouth" that they fell apart.  Also, despite the instructions it was really difficult to tell when they were done.

Perfect cookies! One of the parents at my work was selling those frozen cookies and I saw the peanut butter ones and made me want some.  I do not make cookies very much.  I found this and it was easy and sooooo good, much better than the frozen ones!  :)

Good, but not the best cookie I've ever had. If you like soft cookies that aren't overly chewy, this is the recipe for you as far as texture goes. They cooked very quickly and didn't ooze all over the pan. 

I substituted butter for shortening and they tasted very peanut buttery. Would probably be even better with some heath bar chips mixed in!

I made these for my family as a treat.  I only rate this recipe a 3 cause the cookie is lacking more peanut butter taste.  Other than that, it is a nice cookie.  I liked the texture and look.  Maybe next time add more peanut butter.

this is the recipe i am sticking with forever! I have never ever made peanut butter cookies before, and because of this recipe I will almost every day!
But I cooked for 13-14 minutes instead * minutes wasn't enough for my oven. It was still delicous and chewy!

These are unbelievable!  My mother-in-law was less than enthusiastic that I wasn’t going to make her tried-and-true peanut butter cookie recipe for Christmas, but after reading the previous reviews, I just had to try these.  All the reviewers were right – these are amazing!  My advice to those planning to make this recipe – make several batches because you will have to taste test ALL of the first batch.

The cookies I made turned out almost exactly like the picture.  A no fail peanut butter cookie recipe.  One tip - they really need to be left in the over for a minimal amount of time.  Don't hesitate to take them out before you think they are done.  A little too burnt and they are very very crisp.  For me, 7 minutes was perfect.  30 more seconds burned them.

My goodness!!!  These were just about the best peanut butter cookies I'd ever had.  Fantastic flavor, and just the right texture.  I will definately make these again.

Easy as pie and just as delicious! These are great to make with the kids too, I let my 4 year old put the criss-cross marks on htem so she could make them "special". Will definitely make these again!

I used butter rather than Crisco, Adams Natural Peanut Butter rather than Jif, and added 1/2c mini-chocolate chips.  Baked a batch or two for 9 minutes, but they were pretty light-colored and still doughy; when I baked the next batches for 11 minutes, they turned out about right for us; we like ours just a little bit crispy on the edges.

Wonderful!  I baked only 5 minutes. A light, peanut-buttery cookie.  I added mini-chocolate chips to the mix and it was a very nice twist.  A great chocolate/peanut butter cookie!

Delicious! These cookies really live up to its name! I combined regular Crisco and half a stick of butter, and I used another brand of PB (which was a bit more creamier). I also added chocolate chips to half of the batch. OMG- these cookies turned out chewy- and STAYED chewy long after I'd baked them. If you like your cookies with more crunch, then my advice to you is to bake them for maybe a minute- or two longer. They're truly irresistable!

Made these a week ago and there are still lots left in the cookie jar. Used plain Crisco as didn't have butter flavoured, but found them heavy and dense. They stayed chewy, but I personally like crispy cookies.. oh well, back to the drawing board.

These tasty treats are VERY yummy! I didn't use JIF* because it is not organic. I used Simple Truth No Stir Creamy Peanut Butter, but everything else in the original recipe I kept the same, except in Organic. 
My husband requested a peanut butter cookie and these appear to have satisfied his craving, he is on his second cookie as I write this review. 
Clearly I made my cookies larger than called for because they took about 12 minutes to cook in my convection oven.
It yielded 28 cookies. 
They are deliciously soft in the center and a nice crisp to the edges.

My husband also rated the cookies a 4 star, he stated they are good but there is probably an even better recipe out there.

Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I did make one major change. My grandson is allergic to peanuts so I made with peanut-free Wow Butter. Other than that, I followed the recipe as shown. I baked between 7-8 minutes and they were a little crisp on the edges and soft in the center. I will definitely make again. This recipe is a keeper.

Decided it was time to get baking again. LOVE peanut butter cookies. Saw a label from an old Crisco can for Irresistible Peanut Butter cookies. Found this one here and they are the exact same. Yes, 1 T vanilla in both. They are so, so good. Made exactly as written.

This is the same recipe as the Krisco one. It calls for one teaspoon vanilla extract , so that's what I used.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon salt.  also forgot the 3 T milk, and they still turned out great.  I love this cookie recipe.

These are delicious!  I made a couple of changes. I used dark brown sugar, increased the peanut butter to 1 cup and used 1/4 cup Crisco , 1/4 cup of butter.  8 minutes of baking and 2 minutes on the cooking sheet was perfect.

Great tasting cookie. I made it with butter and 1 tbsp. milk instead of instead of Crisco and 3 tbsp. milk, the remaining recipe as is.  I also used a size 30 (1.13oz) cookie scoop and baked for 10 minutes for the second pan.  It made a nice 3 1/2 inch cookie.  I'll save the little 2 inch cookies that the heaping teaspoon made for our little 3 year old neighbor who likes to toddle over for treats.

These cookies turned out great! I didn’t have butter flavored crisco, so I used real butter instead. I would also suggest making a double batch. They go really fast!  Yummy!

My family loves these cookies!  I used chunky Jif and plain Crisco sticks (didn't have the butter flavor Crisco on hand) and they came out great.  I'm not a peanut butter cookie fan and even I liked these!

I make these for my grandson.  He is super picky and needs to gain weight, so, I use Heavy Cream instead of milk to add a few extra calories for him.  My husband loves them also.  I follow the recipe to a T.  Perfect every time.

Outstanding! Followed recipe as is for the first batch and it was wonderful. My family likes a more peanut butter flavor so I added 1/4 cup extra peanut butter and peanut butter chips to the second batch. I liked the first batch but my family liked the second. Either way, this is a fantastic recipe!

I loved these cookies.  I made them as the recipe is written, with just a little less sugar, and a little more peanut butter to finish the jar  .  I reduced the butter accordingly and they came out beautiful. I used a  1T scoop, flattened with the fork dipped in sugar,   I cooked them 11 min on an air bake sheet.  This is a little longer so they are not quite a chewy, which is how people like them here.  For me, I would reduce the time by about a min.

1/9/2017: Mylove requested peanut butter cookies (his favorite cookie), so I made these this evening while finishing up with dinner preparations. Have been trying different peanut butter cookie recipes for about six years now and have not been successful in creating "the taste" he is looking for. Did not have butter flavored Crisco, so used regular. Used a 2 T. cookie scoop, formed balls and forked. Baked at 360 degrees for 10-12 mins since they were a bigger cookie. Made 31 cookies. Never have been a peanut butter cookie fan, but I ate three of these right out of the oven-just to make sure they OK to serve. (That's my story and I'm stinkin' to it!) I will update this review after the peanut butter cookie expert has his late nighttime snack. Oh my! As I am typing this review, he is already in the cookie jar. After a moment, from the kitchen I hear, "THAT'S the cookie, RIGHT THERE!" Comes out of the kitchen smiling and doing a little shimmy type happy dance while eating a cookie (another one in the other hand), sits down beside me and asks, "What did you do different? These are better than the other ones." Told him that I tried a different recipe." Another shoulder shimmy while eating the other cookie, "THESE are the ones, RIGHT HERE." Cookies finished-all quiet now and then I hear, "Uh, huh. THOSE are the ones, Baby, RIGHT THERE!"

I added a little more flour as I thought the dough was too "wet" and refrigerated the dough as well.  This may be because I don't have access to shortening and had to use butter.  Quite delicious.

I was looking for a good pb cookie recipe and I have found it! Followed the recipe and they came out awesome. I didn't use all the dough, I put the other half in the freezer. Like other reviews, I took the cookies out the oven after about six minutes and just let it rest close to 10 minutes. Day 5 and the cookies are still soft and yummy! Definitely will make again.

I'd give these 10 Stars if I could. My friends and family have renamed these Oh My God's simply because every time someone eats one that's all they can say. 
If you want the BEST Peanut Butter Cookie Ever.... replace the Jif with NATURAL peanut butter ( Sorry Jif! I know it's your recipe ) and go ahead and use real unsalted butter. Phenomenal rich peanut taste shines though in a cookie that melts on your tongue. I usually make at least a triple batch as they disappear at lightning speed. If you're feeling really naughty, dip half of the cookie in melted milk chocolate. YUM

Only thing I changed in this recipe was using 1/2 cup butter instead of crisco. They had a nice crunch on the edges and tender in the middle. Delicious!

Swapped real butter for the shortening and white whole wheat flour for a portion of the all-purpose.  Baked a little longer because I like the edges crispy and crumbly like shortbread.  Would make again.

This is not as good as my recipe. These cookies came out a bit dry. The dough was crumbly when I tried to roll them into balls. Not a bad recipe, but not delicious. The cookies are not as sweet as I'd like them to be. They aren't too salty, though.

A perfectly chewy peanut butter cookie. My brother the PB cookie snob loves these. I make them with organic peanut butter and plain crisco and they turn out perfectly. I don't flatten them completely with a fork, however. A slight indentation gives them nice texture, but leaves each cookie thick and chewy in the center.

These turned out really good! I used margarine and upped the PB to 1 cup. Made them tablespoon size and only baked 4-5 mins. Added mini reeces pieces to some and they were even better!

These were NOT the best PB cookies I've every made. I cannot find my regular recipe. These tasted very bland and could also taste the salt. I am more of a peanut butter tasting cookie kind of person. I was baking these for a Christmas party tomorrow however, I will not be serving them.

Pretty good - a bit too salty as the recipe reads, but by cutting the salt in half it makes them perfect!

I finally found a peanut butter cookie that I like.  Others were too hard or didn't have much of a peanut butter taste.  Instead of 1/2 C. Butter Crisco, I used 1/4 C. Regular Crisco and 1/4 C. margarine.  They were really good.  I will use this recipe from now on.

Best peanut butter cookies I've made yet. Think I might add chocolate chips next time for something other than the regular peanut butter cookies.

Great recipe, soft, thick, and maintains it's softness over several days.  Took them to work, caught someone stealing 3 at a time!!  Used crunchy peanut butter (1 cup) to get that rich flavor.

I have hated peanut butter cookies my entire life, but I thought I should make these for my family.  These are the best cookies ever!!!  I added some chocolate chips, but the recipe didn't need any tweaking.  I am eating as many cookies as the rest of my family.

I love this recipe and all the other Butter Flavored Crisco ones. I've been using them for years. This makes a great peanut blossom too. I just take part of the batches I make and put kisses on the top.  I always have to make a batch just for my oldest son at Christmas, but now he will have to fight with his girlfriend for them, maybe I'll have to make them 2 batches!

Wow...I am no baker by any means, but I just used this as an excuse for some good ole family time with my four year old kids and these were a hit!  Simple to do and oh soooo yummy!  I can see these being a family favorite.  Will make again for sure!

I am a picky cookie reviewer,   but I rate by taste and appreciation of the recipe.   I thought these cookies were fabulous (they're late x-mas presents)   and I am not ashamed to send them as gifts.    They are perfectly peanuty,   and are on the floury rather than sugary side.  I like that.   Now,  as feedback,  I microwaved my butter and I think it made the dough a bit runny,  maybe I mixed it for too long.   Therefore,  it took them longer to bake and I couldn't get the fork print in them,   but they came out So I'll have to eat those ones instead of give them away.

These were good, but not great.  I did add chocolate chips and roll the cookies in sugar before baking which made them a little better, but I didn't find the cookies to be very flavorful.  You could hardly taste the peanut butter.  They did turn out thick with a very nice consistency, but I think I will go back to my old recipe.

Excellent recipe that makes great cookies! Be sure to cook them on parchment or a light-colored cookie sheet or they get too browned on the bottom. I added 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and that worked wonderfully.

So my husband goes to the store one day and comes back home with not one but two humongous jars of Jif (apparently they were on sale).  As peanut butter for sandwiches and the like, I can't stand Jif -- I prefer Peter Pan.  I decided to put a dent in the unused jars of Jif by making peanut butter cookies.  I'm so happy I did.  The recipe is one of very few that I've encountered whereas you can follow it EXACTLY and it comes out like it should.               I'm a tweaker by nature, but the only two things I did differently was use unsalted butter instead of Crisco and sprayed my cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.  The cookies are absolutely delicious and stay moist and soft the next day.

Yummy, my toddlers loved them, have a glass of milk on hand because they are very sweet. I added some peanut M&M's to the mix, and baked them each spoonful in a mini muffin tops nonstick pan. Recipe made about 3 1/4 dozen peanut butter cups.

I thought these were good cookies, although not that superior to some other recipes I've tried.  I did substitute regular butter for the shortening, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

These cookies are absolutely lovely. I've tried several different recipes for peanut butter cookies, and they've always turned out hard with no flavor. These where perfect, the amount of peanut butter was perfect and they were very soft and moist.

This came out pretty good even though I ran out of brown sugar. They were soft, filling, and flavorful.
