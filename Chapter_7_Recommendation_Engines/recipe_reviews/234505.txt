We both liked this with one small change. I didn't care for  the entire mixture being pureed...including the chicken so I pureed 1/2 the soup minus the chicken then added the puree back into the chunky corn, onions and chicken pieces for a chunky soup. Heated through and this was fine. It did need salt so we added that while eating. i did use homemade chicken stock so that does have less salt than canned. All in all a good and simple recipe.

I used butter instead of oil, no cumin or cayenne pepper, lime or chicken . I added 3/4 package of Velveeta cheese and milk along with chicken broth and small can of green chilies.  It was very tasty and not too spicy.

This came out well and came together quickly. I added more chicken, approximately another 1/2 breast and a thigh. (I used a rotisserie chicken.) I knew my husband wouldn't want the soup pureed, plus I didn't feel like doing the extra step. So, I used 2 cans cream corn and 1 can whole kernel corn. It worked fine. I didn't have fresh jalapenos, so I used a small can of hot diced jalapenos, and it was nice and spicy. It was  good with the cilantro and sour cream added.
