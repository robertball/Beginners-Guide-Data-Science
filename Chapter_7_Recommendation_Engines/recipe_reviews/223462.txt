This recipe was really delicious and is an all time favorite for my Nana. Strawberries are really good, and ripe ones are simply divine for this recipe. I didn't strain it however. I left the strawberries in the syrup and used it immediatley since I made pancakes that morning. Simply mahvelouus!

So easy to make and there is no need to alter the recipe.  I strained out the strawberry pulp and used the syrup for my home made whipped cream.

I forgot to review this a few weeks back when I made it. IT IS AWESOME! 2 weeks and flavor keeps getting better and better. Grand girls ask for this on pancakes. The fluffy pancakes recipe here btw that I keep in cupboard (dry ingredients). Wonderful combo.

Who knew? This is a fabulous recipe; simple, natural and versatile. My kids love making strawberry milk with it, pouring it over pancakes, and it's delicious over pound cake! Even better is the fact that there is no high fructose corn syrup or ingredients that you can't pronounce.

Good basic strawberry syrup.  I had to cook it for about half an hour and then used cornstarch to thicken (1-2 tsp cornstarch in a 2 tablespoons of cold water, mixed well, then added to the simmering syrup and stirred constantly for two minutes).  I didn't strain the sauce - it is good with bits of strawberry. The family loved it on waffles ("fluffy pancakes" recipe on this site) and we had plenty left over.

I love to cook and add my own twist to recipes, based on the ratings, I'm sure this recipe could stand on its own. However, I decided to make it with 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I also added 1/8 tsp All Spice and 1/8 tsp cinnamon. It was insanely good - truly the easiest and best syrup recipe I've ever made!

I made this recipe exactly as directed once and then subbed raspberries for strawberries in the second batch and it was very good either way. The ratio of sugar/water/fruit is dead on. I used the syrup on French Toast as well as tried it to make strawberry milk and both had such a true, natural taste (as opposed to those chemical "fake" tastes of the store bought kind).  I pureed the leftover raspberries to make "raspberry sauce" over cheesecake!  I used the leftover strawberries to make a milk shake!  Thanks to Mr. Maynard.

Heavenly!! I use this with the fruit that looks best in the market, that day. Today it was peaches. I made it with strawberries and was very pleased, so the stretch to different fruits was an easy reach. This is a great starter syrup and can be taken in several wonderful directions. Thanks Daniel for making my pancakes a little bit better.

Added some rhubarb and a few drops of lime juice. Turned out delicious! Had to cook probably 20 minutes to get to thicken.

I made this strawberry syrup for cheesecake pancakes. My brother and my fiance loved it! I will definitely make this again. I left the strawberries in since it was for pancakes. The syrup tasted almost like strawberry preserves. Next time I will squeeze a bit of lemon into the syrup while it is reducing to give it another layer of flavor.

I made this for cocktails and homemade strawberry lemonade. It was amazing. I used sugar in the raw for a deeper color.

I just made this to drizzle over chocolate lava cake. It tastes amazing but it came out a little too runny for my taste. I was able to reduce it further after straining out the strawberries by returning it to the pan and continuing to simmer over medium heat for another 10 min. If you like your syrup thicker, I suggest reducing the water to 3/4 of a cup. I do this with homemade brown sugar or maple syrup recipes and then it sticks nicely to the pancakes without making everything soggy or running off the food.

Yum! I added more water to it. I think I skimped on the sugar by a little. I used old, frozen strawberries to use them up and it was very surprisingly still AMAZING!! It does kind of look like jam when it's cold, but it was very fresh tasting. I put this in the microwave before serving it with my waffles.

I was looking for a strawberry sauce to serve with homemade angel food cake, and this fit the bill perfectly.  I did not strain it because I wanted the strawberry chunks, and I thickened it at the end of the cooking with 1 T corn starch (mixed with 1 T water before adding to the sauce).  I also added a bit of lemon juice.  It was delicious and a big hit at my grandson's birthday party, served with the angel food cake and whipped cream!  I put the leftover strawberry sauce in a jar in the fridge and have used it over pancakes with whipped cream...my oh my!  I'll definitely be making this again!

Just made this syrup tonight.  I added blueberries too.  I did not strain it, but did blend it.  My son tried it and said we were not buying anymore syrup!  Looking forward to using it on pancakes in the morning,

I found this recipe, or similar of this about 4 years ago. I make it for my family, when we have visitors or for camping. They all rave Always meant to write in, but better late then never. 4 years of testing it and still is great. (Too sweet for me though, even when I use less sugar)

Good recipe, little sweet. 
You can also replace the sugar with a substitute such as Splenda for a sugar free option. 
I doubled this recipe and it made about 2.5 cups. 
You don't have to be exact with the measurements,  but don't stay too far. 
Make it multiple times and adjust to your personal liking. 
Share the results!

Delicious and easy. I put it on top of buttery pancakes for brunch.  They were so yummy. Only cut your berries in half or it will be a texture like preserves. Cut them up small if you want the texture to be like syrup.

EASY and AMAZING! The bonus is that the leftover pulp makes a great spread for toast and sandwiches, too. I made this exactly as stated but I think it took a little longer than 20 minutes to cook down. It was really great served warm on french toast and equally good the next day on leftovers. I've already added this to my real life recipe box as a keeper and will be making it next time we have guests over for breakfast or brunch.

Delicious!  We love the syrup with chocolate chip banana pancakes!  As a personal preference, I cut back on the sugar to 2/3 cup.

Turned out great. Followed recipe exactly, but used my immersion blender at the end to puree the whole thing instead of straining.

Really good but you really do need to let it cool to thicken.

I use this recipe with a frozen berry blend at least twice a month to make pancake syrup and jam in one shot using the strained liquid and repurposing the leftover pulp. So simple!

It was awesome, I added a bit more sugar and halved the recipe, so it was:

1 cup Strawberries
1/2 cup Water
2/3 cup sugar. 

it made a thick, sort of crispy glaze on the berries themselves and the syrup was more a glaze, but man it was good.

I loved this, but I think I'll tweak it next time I make it by using a 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup of sugar like the recipe says. I left the strawberries in it when I made it and it was perfect on pancakes and French toast.

I adjusted it for one serving and didn’t use as much sugar as that adjustment called for. I did not make the strawberries get mushy as the recipe called for. I heated it enough to dissolve the sugar and let the strawberries soft and the liquid thickened, then poured it over my waffles. I topped it with whipped cream and yummmmm!

I took a chance on this recipe, partly because it looked too easy and too good to be true! But it's fantastic! I followed the recipe to the letter, only added a mixture of 2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp water  at the end of cooking to thicken it up a bit. And I left the fruit pulp in  - why throw out good fruit? It added texture to the syrup. Can't wait to try it on pancakes, ice cream, and over pound cake. This recipe is definitely a keeper and one that will be my go-to for our bountiful strawberry harvest!

Made this when i went a little crazy on a strawberry sale and had a whole carton of strawberries one day from going bad. I kept true to the recipe, and it worked great! It came out really flavorful and thick. I put a little in my wine and i will never go back! I think next time ill muddle some basil and add it in with the strawberries to make a nice cocktail syrup

This is AMAZING!!! We ran out of syrup for our pancakes so we whipped up this syrup and it was perfect! It felt like we were having dessert for breakfast! It makes a lot of syrup too! Next time we’ll just make half the recipe since we only had 2 people eating it

This is amazing! I lowered the sugar to 3/4 and it was still super sweet but yummy! And I didn’t have any fresh strawberries (which sucked) nor frozen, but we did have frozen mixed berries so i used that. And i also added corn starch to thicken it more!

I made this syrup tonight for Belgian waffles that I plan to make for tomorrow night.  For the sugar, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 coconut palm sugar which tastes the same as brown sugar, but is a bit healthier. This made the color of the syrup darker than if it had all been white sugar. I also added 1/8 tsp. All Spice, and 1/8 tsp. cinnamon as suggested by another reviewer. After the strawberries were mushy, I used an immersion blender to blend the strawberries into the syrup to add to the strawberry flavor. I also added a water/corn starch mix to thicken the syrup a bit. My husband and I did a taste test after the syrup was done, and we both agree this is an excellent syrup recipe and one I will make again.  For our Belgian waffles, I plan to slice fresh strawberries to put on them, use this syrup over them, and top them off with a little whipped cream. Yummy!!

This is a great tasting by simple recipe. I did a a tsp of vanilla for a little something extra. Next time I’d probably cook it down a little longer, or add cornstarch, as it was still pretty thin and my pancakes got a little smushy. (Extremely Yummy smush though)

Easy to make and tastes great.  I used it in lemonade for a bridal shower and it went fast...I had to make more.  I've also used it to top ice cream and that was good as well.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this 3 times. It is a great recipe but I cut the sugar to a little less then 1/4 cup and I like to blend in a few of the cooked strawberries with my hand blender.

I had a ton of strawberries from the garden and an upcoming ice cream social, so doubled the recipe.  I had to simmer it for 30 minutes to get it to thicken up, but it is absolutely delicious!

Loved this!  I strained some of it for strawberry milk and to add to lattes.   I used the unstrained syrup for strawberry lemonade.  It was excellent in all three.  Plan to try this on pancakes or French toast soon.  Very versatile!

This syrup is awesome. Really easy to make. Only change I made was to add 1 tsp of corn starch after it had simmered for awhile--I wanted it a little thicker, and 1 tsp seemed to be just perfect.  Served it hot, right out of the pan, over my fluffy pancakes, and it was divine. My family raved about it!  My wife's description included the word Nirvana.

Love this sauce. Second time making this. We used it for French toast and strawberry milk. I think a little less sugar would be good too. I mean I felt like I was eating dessert for breakfast. Still delicious though.

Made this exactly as written. Used it for strawberry/blueberry pancakes and pound cake. It has a nice flavor but I do wish it was a little thicker especially for pancakes but it's easy to make and fairly quick as well. When I strained it into a jar I used the strained bits as filling between the pancake layers. Husband and kids have requested I make this again.

I wanted to make strawberries in syrup, like you can buy in the frozen fruit section of the grocery store, to use in making "Ultimate Frozen Strawberry Margarita" on this site.  This was easy and quick to make, and enough for two batches of Margaritas.

I subbed Xyla for the sugar and was nervous to see how it would turn out. Used half frozen strawberries and half frozen peaches.  It was delicious!! Mashed the fruit up in stead of straining and enjoyed it with the Whole Wheat Coconut Oil Waffles on here.  Thanks!

I made this syrup with fresh strawberries and followed the recipe the first time. The flavor was great, but it was very sweet. The second time I made it, I halved the sugar and it is perfect!

This makes a really tasty syrup. Instead of straining out the quartered strawberries, I pureed them before adding to the syrup and got a very thick, almost jam-like syrup for waffles.

I kept trying to make strawberry syrup for the kids, but winging it never turned out right. This is my new go-to recipe! I made it with frozen strawberries (whole) but otherwise followed it to the letter. It made a little over 1 1/2 cups of finished syrup, strained. If, like me, you are worried that 20 minutes of high heat cooking will wreck the pretty color of the strawberries, you can be reassured. The final product has a nice dusty rose color that is very appetizing. I'm so delighted.

Surprised at how delicious this syrup is!  I was afraid it was going to be too watery but it wasn't.  Used frozen strawberries and it worked perfectly.  Pour it over waffles, add to yogurt, make strawberry milk.  This one is a keeper for our family!

Good recipe. It turned out a little sweeter than I'd like,  and I had to cook longer to allow it thicken.

I made this with huckleberries and just halved the water. Thick, not too sweet syrup in under a half hour! I strained into a small glass maple syrup container I had and it filled it right up to the neck.

I made this to put on French toast. My family loved the strawberry syrup. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. However, I left the strawberries in the syrup as I put it on the French toast, simply delicious.

Nice and simple. My 3 yo wanted pancakes and I had some strawberries that I needed to use up. She voted on strawberry syrup. It came out delicious and not overly sweet.

Great, simple recipe.  I use the syrup as a pancake topping and the mushy strawberries as a spread on toast or to flavor yogurt.  Definitely a go-to recipe!

I just made this recipe while processing some fresh, sweet Hood strawberries I bought yesterday.  The recipe is simple, easy, and quick, but something went wrong, I think.  The syrup didn't get real thick upon cooling, and made the pancakes soggy on top.  Any suggestions?

Excellent. The reason for 4 stars is because I added cornstarch for more "body". Also puréed in my blender, but that's personal preference.

I needed to make up a super fast strawberry reduction sauce to put over a little personal sized strawberry short cake. Today is my husband's birthday and I wanted to surprise him with one of his favorite treats before he left for work. This recipe is so simple and straightforward with tasty results. The syrup thickened nicely and tasted great. I used the leftover reduction to put over my son's waffles and he liked it, too.

very tasty.I think the ripeness really depends on the outcome of this syrup. I think if you catch some strawberries on sale about to expire at the store, that would really make for a good batch! thank you!

Trying to make this right now and its been in the "simmer til it thickens" stage for about 20 minutes now, and not showing any signs of thickening. Smells great though!

Amazing on top of crepes filled with sour cream (yes, sour cream!)!!! Super easy to make, and it turned pretty sweet even with the sour batch of strawberries I used. I might actually try to use less sugar next time but this is a personal preference :)

Forgot and added frozen strawberries at the beginning.  Still turned out very nice.  Definitely better warm.

It was really sweet, so next time I'll use less sugar, but it's so good.  I put it in a jar to use later, but had just a little bit left in the blender (I used a blender to mash it up since my masher broke) so I made a milkshake with it.  It was awesome.  Can't wait to put this on some toast, or pancakes/waffles.  Will add it to ice cream for my daughter, but it was so easy and so good.

This is delicious and so easy to make with pancakes.  I have thickened it on occasion with corn starch or flour.  But the flavor is always great!

This was really good. I found it sweet enough with only half a cup of sugar, but the full cup of sugar would have given it the more traditional syrup sweetness.
