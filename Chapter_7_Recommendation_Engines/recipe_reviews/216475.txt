This sounds delicious. I have anchovies in the fridge I need to do something with and I'd love to give this recipe a try!

I added some white wine to the sauce and some extra tomatoes to the mix and it was great!

I had a Fresh Octopus Stern and a can of Anchovies in the fridge and was craving pasta so I whipped this up in a jiffy. I added about a quarter cup of White Wine and some Red Pepper Flakes (love me some heat!!!) It was DELISH! While I had some Clams and Shrimp in the freezer, I wanted to use my fresh Stern. Next time I will make the whole shibang...WHICH WILL BE SOON! Great Recipe! Thanks!!!

This was delicious! I added basil pesto to the garlic and used anchovy paste along with tomato paste, then deglazed the pan with a little red wine before adding crushed tomatoes. I always add a small sprinkle of sugar to any tomato based dish to avoid heartburn too. Served with crunchy bread smeared with basil pesto and Parmesan cheese over all. Skipped the lemon wedge garnish since I didnâ€™t have any on hand. Will make again!
