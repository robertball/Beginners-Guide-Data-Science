The tart shells are crunchy not flaky like others you may be accustomed to but I liked the flavor and the texture. Take a wrapper and fold in half and then half in the other direction stack 5 wrappers under it and then cut with a pizza cutter...fast and they're all the same size. I like that you can make both the filling and the tarts ahead of time and assemble right before serving. Nice recipe.
