very sweet! turned out too soft the first time i made it, so i let it boil longer the second time & it was much better.

I made this for the first time at Christmas, to give as gifts. I doubled the recipe because it looked so good, however the fudge did not set at all after a full day in the fridge. I thought i'd have to throw it all out but after 2 more days of chilling it had finally set. It's delicious! Just don't expect to be able to eat it right away, it has the consistency of sticky pudding for the first few days chilling, after that its great!

Wowzer!  This had a really good flavor but man alive was it sweet.  It was a little too sweet for me and everyone that ate it thought the same thing.  I must have undercooked it as it was a little too soft also.  I dont think i will make this again, but if I did, I would decrease the sugar and increase the cooking time.

Great recipe.  Make sure that you press the top layer of nuts into the fudge before you chill.  Otherwise all the nuts will just fall off as you slice it.  I will definitely make this fudge again!
