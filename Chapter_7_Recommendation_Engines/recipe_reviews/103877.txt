This was wonderful! So easy to make too. I made a couple of little modifications: I used sourdough croutons (I crushed them up into crumbs) instead of regular bread crumbs, I sauteed some fresh chopped garlic (1 clove) with the onion and chard, added a dash more nutmeg, and added about 1/3 cup of crumbled feta cheese on top of quiche 5 mins. before removing from oven- absolutely delicious! Will definetly make again.

I used an entire bunch of swiss chard and 2 213g cans of red sockeye salmon.  I didn't butter the pie pan but used buttery snack cracker (Ritz) crumbs instead of plain bread crumbs.  And because the salmon didn't need cooking I simply layered chard, salmon and poured a mixture of cold milk and beaten eggs into 2 10" deep dish pie pans.  Very simple and great tasting.

This was really good! I made a lot of changes to it because I cannot eat dairy, but the salmon and swiss chard combination was really delicious. I skipped the first two steps because I used a pre-made pie dough and good quality canned salmon (this cut out some time and work). I also used more swiss chard and less salmon because that is what I had on hand. I used olive oil in place of the butter, and Almond milk in place of the milk to make this non-dairy. It turned out wonderful and I have made it several times! I also use the core part of this recipe (3 eggs to 1 cup milk in a pie shell) to use up just about any left over veggies. If you have the pre-made rolled pie dough on hand the prep part of this dinner is done in just minutes!

We LOVED this recipe!  We followed it almost exactly, except that we found you really don't need to use as much milk as is recommended to simmer the salmon.  We doubled the recipe (making one to freeze) and only needed about 3 cups of milk (not 4).  (See how later in the recipe you only use part of the milk again.)  It could use a little salt when you stir in the eggs and milk.  We made it in a whole wheat pie crust (so we didn't use the bread crumbs), baking it 7 min longer than the directions.  Wonderful, wonderful!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This is a lovely dish. colorful, flavorful -- perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's more of a frittata, because of the lack of crust. I baked it in a quiche dish.

I used leftover grilled salmon, and simmered it in a little more than half the milk called for in the recipe to give it a little more moisture. I served it with some grated parmesan cheese, sour cream and salsa. Yumm!

This was yummy.  I cooked the salmon in only 1 cup of milk so I wasn't wasting any.  I also added feta cheese to the top and cooked it in a pre-made whole wheat crust.

This has a strong but pleasant flavor, and is also very pretty and fairly easy to make.  The breadcrumb bottom isn't my favorite, but with a real crust this would definitely be 5 stars.

This recipe was fantastic!  I'm not very big on salmon or quiche, however, the recipe was so good that my husband and I agreed that it was a keeper.  I did follow the recipe exactly, except I used a pie crust instead of breadcrumbs and cooked it for about five minutes longer than what was originally stated.

Sooooo surprised. I added this to my weekly menu under "trying something new" and was very pleasantly surprised. To make things quick and easy on a weeknight I used canned salmon, a frozen pie crust from the store and just used a touch of soymilk in the egg mixture. It was fantastic. Also great the next day as lunch. Just heated it up in the office microwave...ta dah!

This was very good but I didn't realize it had no cheese until I was well into the recipe.  It confused me but I decided to follow the recipe.  I definitely need a cheese flavor in my quiche, I've decided so next time I will grate some Swiss cheese and put that in there.  I used a regular crust and and I was very glad for that.  Makes the dish for me.  This was light and eggy and tasted so good for you.  I will make again when I have extra swiss chard.

Even the man liked this even though he promises that he hate quiche and swiss chard! I used tinned salmon, because that's what the budget allows these days. I also added one red potato in a really small dice to add a little heft to it and make it more "meal worthy" for him. Thanks for the winner!

I loved this! Even my picky two-year old devoured hers up.  I didn't use the bread crumbs, just buttered the dish and poured the salmon/swiss chard mixture/egg on top.  I used a canned salmon because that is what I had on hand and it made preparing this dish very easy.  I buttered my dish, put down a layer of salmon, a layer of swiss chard/onions and then put the eggs on top. I used 4 eggs and a few egg whites because my eggs were on the smaller side.  I omitted the nutmeg and marjoram because I didn't have any and added cayenne pepper for some heat.  This is definitely a very tasty 5 star recipe.

I got in a hurry with this so it was probably more operator error than recipe error, but I just wasn't that impressed with the flavors.  Of course, salmon is not a typical food item for us either.  However it is a great way to use up too much swiss chard...tastes very similar to spinach! :)

Made this to use up some Swiss Chard I had in the house.  It is delicious!  I skipped the step that calls for cooking the salmon in the milk and substituted canned salmon, because I didn't have any fresh.  I also added some fresh parsley, and topped it with some grated cheese during the last five minutes of baking.  I will definitely be making this again.

A tasty dish overall. I think an actual pie crust would make it better (though more carby) and I had to use halibut because only farm raised salmon was available. Next time I'll wait for the good salmon because I think it would have been more aromatic.

Have been trying to use more dark leafy greens in my cooking and this fit the bill. I did use canned salmon as other reviewers had, rinsing it a bit to lower the sodium content. Upon serving it for a quick evening meal, my husband commented that he felt it needed some cheese, so I sprinkled some on top & he felt that made it complete. Definitely a winner! Next time I may incorporate the cheese into the body of the quiche and add one more egg. Thanks SnagleB for posting this recipe.

Okay so I realize I probably shouldn't be rating this recipe because I changed it so much.  But the main thing I was curious about was how salmon was going to taste in a quiche, and I was pleasantly suprised.  Other than that I basically turned this into a "standard" quiche.  I used a pie crust, spinach instead of chard, added red bell pepper, an extra egg and some shredded cheese.  I had to bake it for about 45-50 min.  My whole family loved it.

A nice change and a nice way to use swiss chard. My rating reflects the end product based on If I followed the recipe exactly, this may have turned out much better.  First, I used canned salmon which was too salty.  I would either halve the salmon, use fresh, or buy unsalted if I were to make it again.  Crumbled feta on top, at the suggestion of another reviewer, sounded like a great idea but made the quiche even more salty.  I would omit that the next time.

Very good, I used duck eggs and all the milk(2 cups) and it came out beautiful.  I appreciate the fact that this recipe is very low in calories!  I'd make it again!

I made a sweet balsamic baked salmon last night for dinner along with Roasted Swiss Chard with Feta cheese (from this website) and this morning I threw them into a quiche.  Awesome!

So tasty and healthy!  I made this with skim milk instead of 2%, and Talapia instead of Salmon.  I also added a little Feta cheese, and didn't have majoram... it was fantastic!

Good, but didn't "wow" me.  I needed to use up my  Chard and this was a little different, and i enjoyed this, but I don't know if it will be a go-to recipe.

This is very easy to make and it's a great way to use the large bunches of Swiss Chard that came in my seasonal veggie box.  I still like my quiche better with pastry crust, and I still like to use half and half instead of milk for a creamier and less watery filling (not quite so healthy this way, I know).  The nutmeg seasoning is just perfect to blend all the flavors together.  Nicely done.

This was my first attempt at making a quiche and it turned out awesome! I used a pie shell instead of the bread crumbs and it was a hit!

Too fishy for me but I use the basic recipe for all kinds of quiche, often.

Everyone I have made this for has raved about it, but it definitely needs a crust.  I use an unbaked store-bought pie crust instead of the bread crumbs.

I put it into a crust, added a little herbed goat chevre, and it was excellent!

I followed the recipe but used less salmon. I used 3/4 large sized canned salmon.  Next time I will press the hash brown crust more compactly and not use so much.

Nice dish. I made it a bit differently. Instead of bread crumb crust I grated some potato and onion into the pie plate and let that bake at 400 while I prepped the rest of the ingredients. I was actually making this in order to use up some smoked salmon so I used that instead of poaching filets and since it had so much flavor on its own I just added salt and pepper over the potato mixture and skipped other spices. I also threw in some mozzerella cheese and topped it with some Parmesan and breadcrumbs. After I cooled it I decided I would take it to a gathering so I took the whole pie out of the dish and sliced it into squares and served it cold on a platter. It was well liked.

This was pretty good, but I think I would have liked a proper crust. I added some fresh shredded parmesan because it seemed like it needed cheese.

This is a great quiche!  My whole family loved it.  I made two additions: a homemade crust and some goat cheese.  Excellent!  We will be having this again.

I hesitate to review this just because I totally mutilated the recipe, but as a basis and main ingredient combo I really appreciate it. I basically looked for a recipe that had salmon and Swiss chard since that's what I had on hand.  I had to change the recipe due to dietary restrictions, but it still turned out pretty good.  I skipped the bread crumbs, and used coconut milk and coconut oil in place of the dairy products.  I also used thyme instead of marjoram.  Against my better judgment I included the nutmeg which I generally don't care for, but in a small amount it was a surprisingly pleasant addition to the dish.  Just reheated the leftovers for breakfast and both my daughter and I still really like it.  Thanks for the idea, something I would have never tried without help!

This was fantastic!  I want to make it again tomorrow!  I made a few adjustments, that may have raised my star rating from 4 to 5--I omitted onions and used 4 cloves of garlic instead, used the entire bunch of Swiss Chard and also diced up 2 red potatoes.  I cooked the garlic, swiss chard and potatoes together to meld their flavors.  Not much left over for lunch tomorrow--I'm taking ribs!

Such a delicious flavor even my kids love it! I do make sure I chop the chard small and add the stems first to help them soften a little more.

I sort of panicked when I saw the amount of milk, so I threw in an extra egg and doubled the bread crumbs which I mixed into the milk.  So what I ended up with was a very light/eggy salmon loaf.  I had to substitute spinach for the swisschard.  I think next time I'll add a little cheese, like parm or feta.

I used Spanish Mackerel instead of salmon because that is what I had in the freezer. I added one more egg and some shredded cheese to the body on the suggestion of another reviewer and it turned out very well. I do think I would prefer it with a crust next time I make it though.

I think I used too much chard. Will try again and make in a crust next time. Not bad though.
