I'm glad I read all these reviews first! This is a great, quick coffee cake if you make a few adjustments to the recipe recommended here in the reviews.   I doubled the sugar and added about 1/4th cup more milk.  I also mixed the melted butter in with the topping mixture and sprinkled it all on top and then took a knife and dragged it through the batter (already in the pan) so that some of the topping would sink below.  I really liked how it came out, I'm posting a picture in the photo section, so you can see.  The cake came out nice and crisp on top but very moist below.  It didn't last very long around my house and i'm already wanting to make it again!

WOW I had a hard time deciding if I should make this or not because some people seemed to realy like it and others seemed to really dislike it. I took the advice of another and added 2/3 cups sugar to the batter and a little extra brown sugar to the topping (about 3 tbls) and WOW was it delicious, so quick, easy YUMMY! Whatsmakes this recipe even better is that it requires so little ingredients and all are common place around my kitchen. I will try to double it next time and see how it works. This is certainly a keeper and the first recipe to motivate me to rate and review. Give it a shot!!!

This is a good basic coffee cake.  I read through the reviews before making it and I doubled the sugar and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk.  It reminds me of Drake's coffee cakes for some reason.  Next time I would definitely double the topping.  This is something if you're having people over at the last minute and you need something in a hurry to serve with tea or coffee.

I just now whipped this up and have decided to throw out my old coffee cake recipe; this will be my new staple. Lovely, light, and delicate. I didn't alter a thing with the batter, except I ended up accidently dumping in more vanilla. Whoops! With the topping, however, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, cut the flour down to one heaping tablespoon, doubled the cinnamon, and used an old trick for a crunchy topping: sprinkle the batter with the cinnamon mixture first, then drizzle the melted butter over it. YUM!!!

This was the BEST Coffee cake I've ever made. I did, however, make a few changes as suggested by others. I added 2/3 c sugar to the dry and a 6 oz container of Fat Free Vanilla yogurt to the wet ingredients. I topped half of the cake with the suggested topping and the other half I added shredded coconut and pecans to the topping, YUMMMMM!! My family LOVED IT!! The pecans and coconut were absolutely delightful! Very moist, PERFECT! A keeper for me!

I tried this recipe after reading all the reviews and decided to add 2/3 cup sugar.  The cake turned out delicious(not dry at all) and very tasty--my kids and hubby loved it.  It did taste more like a pound cake, not like a coffee cake--very yummy though!  I put apples under the crumble topping and made another one and omitted the crumble topping and put about 1/2 cup raspberry jam(about 10 minutes before it came out of oven) and drizzled a little icing on top of both cakes after they were baked.  Thanks for the recipe--I will definately be using this one again.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because i think that it would have tasted just fine if I hadn't made the changes as other reviewers did. I added more milk,and mixed the melted butter w/ the topping and this came out too moist and the topping wasn't crumbly enough 4 me. If I just followed the original recipe it would have been great! W/ the changes this deserves 3 stars. I say: keep the recipe the way it is. It was a tad too heavy and sweet w/ changes. I have a sweet tooth and didn't  care fot it. Next time I will make it the right way and I'm sure it will be scrumptious!

We're having a blizzard in MA.  The kids have yet another school day. Husband is off today and and I work from home.  This put me in the mood to nest and give my family something freshed baked, sweet, and warm.  This recipe was perfect!  I made a few small changes based on what other reviewers said - increased the white sugar to 1/2 cup, used 6 tbsp unsalted butter instead of shortening, added 1/2 cup buttermilk to the batter, increased vanilla to 1 tsp.  To the topping I added chopped pecans, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, and increased the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp.  I baked at 425 for about 25 minutes.  The cake was fluffy, moist, rich without being greasy, and not too sweet but not bland either. Next time, I will mix the melted butter into the topping as others have done, and perhaps run a knife through the topping to swirl it into the batter a little.

I found this to be a little on the dry side.  The topping was really floury so I couldn't see if the top of the cake to test for doneness.  I would also suggest adding more spices..mine didn't seem to have a lot of flavor.  On a positive note, I was able to whip this up in time for an unexpected guest to have a peice.  He did comment on how light it was and so it was enjoyed by some.  I probably won't be making this again but I'm glad I tried it.

The best coffee cake I have ever eaten, so moist and tasty! The company we went to see asked if they could keep the leftovers! I did read other comments and doubled the sugar (total 12 tbsp) and I added a bit more shortening. As well I melted the butter and mixed it with the flour, sugar and cinnamon before pouring it on top. Used a knife to skore the topping into the cake. Will absolutely make this again with no hesitation.

I took this to Women's Bible Study a couple of weeks ago, and it was SO GOOD!  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to double the topping. Yum!

Incredible!!!  These taste even better than store bought coffee cakes!!  I made them into cupcakes (as a previous reviewer suggested) and they were absolutely perfect.  To get a crumblier topping, gradually add some in shortening like with the cake until you reach desired crumbliness!!

As almost everyone else here, I added an extra 2/3 cup sugar. I also doubled the amount of topping and halved the flour ratio for the topping. That said, this recipe was top-notch! Definitely make it again.  Super easy and super-fast.

Very, very good. I doubled the recipe, hoping for leftovers for breakfast. My kids have ensured there will be no coffeecake for breakfast, they gobbled the stuff so quickly. I did add about 1/4 cup extra milk, slipped about 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour in with the white, and mixed the melted butter right in with the brown sugar/cinnamon topping before sprinkling it on top. This is easy, uses readily available ingredients, bakes in only 15 or so minutes, and tastes just like coffee cake should. Yum.

So yummy! I made the recipe with 2 tweaks and it came out so good. One thing I did change was I added a little bit more brown sugar & cinnamon because, come on, who doesn't LOVE a little extra coffee cake topping? And the other was, I didn't realize I was out of shortening and used Blue Bonnet instead. Came out AWESOME! Very moist and yummy.

Quick, easy and delicious! Please note that the batter will be very thick , even after doubling the amount of milk, as others suggested. I substituted butter for the shortening, and doubled the amount of vanilla. After topping batter with brown sugar mixture I poured an additional 3 T of melted butter over it.

I have to say this is a 5 star with the part of the Streusel Coffee Cake by Jim Blamker from this site. I used the topping and icing of that recipe. I kind of combined the 2. I did follow the other reviewers on this and do 1/3 cup white sugar, I used butter not shortening, I added pumpkin pie spice a little ground ginger and extra cinnamon. I feel this would have been a complete bore with out it. There would not have been enough flavor to this cake.  If you do take my advice use this combo all mixed up in a little bowl: 1C chopped pecans 1C packed Brown Sugar 1/2 t cinnamon and 6 T butter softened I put this on top of this recipe and ran my knife up and down the pan to get some of this mixture throughout the cake. I would also check the cake at about 40 minutes mine was a little too brown on the bottom for me but still awesome!!!!

Made this on an unexpected snow day with only ingredients I had on hand.  It was very good!  I added pecans to the topping.  I liked the contrast of the crisp,sweet topping with the soft and light cake.  This recipe is a keeper that I will make again and again!

I've made this twice now and it is perfect. Do not add any sugar -- it is quite sweet already. I can't imagine what it would taste like with more sugar. Also, it is light and fluffy with just the right amount of substance for a coffee cake. If you find it dry or heavy, I suggest beating the egg really well (as per the instructions). Great cake!

This comes out fine as written - my 14-yr-old made it following the directions and ignoring the reviews that say change this or that - just be aware that the batter doesn't pour - it's more of a sticky dough - but it tasted great!

This was wonderful! Moist and tasty, and most of all EASY! I made the recipe with no alterations, except for adding whole pecans with the topping. I wouldn't change anything else about this recipe - and that is so rare for me! Thanks for this one. :)

After reading alot of the reviews, I decided to use this recipe. I doubled it to make in a 13.5 X 9.5 pan. Other reviews had suggested to double the milk. Instead  I decided to keep the milk at what it called for but add 1/4 cup plain yogurt. I also changed the oven temperture to 400'F and bake for about 20 minute's. It turned out better then I could have hoped. The cake was light and creamy and just right in sweetness. (I didn't double the sugar like other reviews had.) By far the best coffee cake I've ever had or made.

As others have said, this is a great base recipe.  I had a great coffee cake once that was very simple to make and have never been able to recreate it until this recipe.  I followed the recipe for the most part, but did the following changes:  I added 1 c of Sour milk (1tbsp lemon juice and enough milk to make 1c) 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2c white sugar, 1/4c brown sugar, and 1tsp vanilla to the batter.  I also doubled the cinnamon in the topping.  It was great!  I will be making this again.

Didn't alter anything with cake part of recipe but with the strussel;  WHO on this planet puts only 1/2 t cinnamon in anything?  One might as well not bother putting any in at all.  Make up your own,  triple it and it's a good cake!

Great recipe... I have been saving it till my day off diet , and i am glad i did.. I did ehat others suggested 2/3 cup sugar in the batter, add 1/4 cup milk too. Made like a crumble on top but to be fair i simply eyed it and pressed the crumbs in a little.. It is sooooooo good... Easy and great :) i am enjoying it right now with a cup of tea, my friend had a slice and asked if she can have a slice to eat in the car coz she was running late :) oh i forgot i used ghee instead of shortening .. :)

So simple and easy!!  Taste great too!!  Did add a little more milk as reviewers recommended and mixed the melted butter with the brown sugar, flour and cinnamon topping.

Very good with a the adjustments suggested by B Spradley: Double the sugar. Add another 1/4 cup of milk. Mix melted butter with topping mix and drag through batter. 

I also sprinkled in a handful of walnuts. Delicious! Definitely a winner.

double the sugar and added about 1/4th cup more milk. double the topping mixture and sprinkled it all on top and then took a knife and dragged it through the batter (already in the pan) so that some of the topping would sink below.

VERY good!  I doubled the recipe. For ONE loaf, I used 1/2 cup sugar. (so z cup for two loaves)  I melted the butter and mixed it into the topping instead of drizzling it over the top.  I didn't use flour but instead used oatmeal (about 1/4 cup or so).  YUMMY!

As written I can see that this cake would be dry . . . as others recommended, I upped the milk to 3/4 cup and the sugar to 2/3 cup.  I mixed the butter with the other topping ingredients and raked it through the batter.  This was a FANTASTIC cake, the cake itself was very moist and tasty, the topping perfect! 5 stars with these changes!!

Great Recipe!! Easy to follow and ready quickly. Only problem I had with it was that it was a little dry, but that is easily fixed by adding a dash more milk. I also added a pinch of cinnamon to the batter to carry the flavor. Very enjoyable.

I loved this cake!!! This might sound weird but I was in the mood for coffee so I thought coffee cake not thinking it wouldn't actually have coffee in it. Well I decided to make this one but I put 1 1/2 tablespoons of instant coffee. It tasted delicious! I have made it a few times since then and it is always gone with in 15 minutes of when it comes out. My family doesn't even wait for it to cool. They practically eat it straight out of the oven. Awesome recipe!!!

I wasn't too sure about making this after reading the reviews about it being dry.  I made a few changes and we loved it!  I used butter flavored shortening, added a bit more milk & added about 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.  I also added about 1 tablespoon of white sugar to the topping.  I'll probably be making this one again because it's so easy & quick to make.

I have looked for this recipe a long time. I lost it some years ago. The topping is quite vrsatile, it can be used as a simple cinnamon topping for other cakes or breads.

Based off the original recipe, I would say I liked this cake. However, when I tried it with the recommendation of others in the comments, adding an additional 2/3 cup of sugar and extra 1/4 cup milk, I LOVED this cake. I would have given it five stars had the original recipe had these changes to it.  I also doubled the brown sugar topping, but that is just because I like it extra thick on my coffee cake.  Overall, I highly recommend, but go ahead and make the slight changes everyone suggests.

I'm confused by this recipe, where is the coffee in this cake? It may be a South African thing but our coffee cake actually tastes like coffee. Also had issues with step 4 & 5, how can you pour the batter into the pan if it's already there?

I followed the recipe exactly and found this a little dry, as though I'd made it with biscuit mix, which would have been easier still.  I think additions of sour cream or yogurt would improve it greatly.

I used 1/4 c. of butter instead, 1/3 c. of milk and 1/4 c. of vanilla honey mead.  To cut back on some of the fat I didn't drizzle the melted butter on top.  Also, the crumb mixture makes way to much so either split it up and put some on the bottom of your pan and some on the top of the cake or make half of the mixture indicated in the recipe.  Overall this is a good, modifiable and quick recipe.  I had to cook a little longer since I used more liquid.  Will probably add walnuts next time for some added flavor too.

Sooooo tonight was the start of a warm cozy snow filled wkend with my husband an kids,,,, WIth that being said I thought this recipe for warm coffee cake along side a lg glass of milk would be great.!!!!   That indeed it was. However I made a few small tweeks.... Starting with ... I baked it at 350,,, Hellooooo am I the only one here that noticed 425 was way to high....... I also took the advice from some other reviews the additonal 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup sugar. Also A little trick of my own was I baked my cake fully then when done I sprinkled my topping over the top once removed from oven,next I melted butter and trickled over the topping. This created A pretty an sweet candy crunch topping... This recipe gets 4 stars from me. Quick and easy..!!!!

as originally written only gets two stars.  To those who say it's not sweet enough--coffee cake is not supposed to be sweet like other cakes. The recipe as written needs more milk, what a thick mess!

A great, simple coffee cake. I made it exactly as listed with the exception of substituting margarine for shortening and it was moist and delicious. It's true the cake itself isn't super-sweet but the topping makes up for that. I think the key to it coming out well is following the instructions as listed and not over-mixing. This is a great cake to throw together on a whim without having to buy any special ingredients. Thanks for posting it!

Very good taste, quick & easy.  I also doubled sugar as people suggested, and mixed the melted butter with the topping.  Yummy, and I found that unlike most baked goods, it was actually better once cooled.  I got nervous that when I poured the batter in it looked like a very thin layer, but it rises when cooked, and turns out substantial.

Nummers!  What a perfect first recipe for my new recipe box.  I added an extra splash of milk, forgot to cut in the shortening so added it after stirring in the liquids, put a shake of nutmeg and powdered sugar and half the flour into the crumbles, did the knife-drag to spread the crumbles, and added the melted butter last (Smart Balance, which worked well).  This is the coffee cake recipe I've been looking for!

This was a great recipe. I read some of the reviews before making it and took one of the suggestions to mix the butter with the brown sugar, flour, cinnamon mix for the topping.  Made the top very nice and crispy.  It definately would have been a bit dry otherwise.  I also substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour.  Had lots of compliments!

This was really good and incredibly easy.  I did add a bit more sugar and milk as others had suggested, and sprinkled crushed pecans on top as well.  Next time I will swirl the topping in but either way this was really tasty - a keeper!

This recipe is very similar to the one my father would make for us on Sunday nights while watching The World of Disney on t.v.! I did have to increase the milk to 3/4 cup and I also increased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. I left out the flour for the topping, instead mixed the cinnamon, melted butter and brown sugar together. After pouring batter into a 9 inch pie pan, I stirred the topping mixture into the batter with a fork, creating a swirl effect. The family thought it rocked with vanilla bean ice cream.

What a great recipe!  I didn't read the reviews...I just wanted coffee cake and didn't want to have to take a trip to the store.  I love that this uses basic ingredients you'd always have on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly, only adding an extra yolk because I used skim milk.  I probably put in more vanilla than called for because I never measure it.  I forgot to put the cinnamon in the topping until the cake had been in the oven about 10 minutes.  I took it out, sprinkled some over the top and popped it back in the oven.  I also added a few chopped pecans to the topping. 
This is a wonderfully simple, delicious recipe as is, but I'd think you could make lots of variations with a high rate of success.
Oh...one more thing.  I used exactly the sugar called for in the recipe and the cake was perfect.  Perhaps a bit more vanilla as opposed to more sugar if you are looking for more flavor.

Mom made this as one of the desserts for my birthday party. I was too busy munching on everything else that night, but I did have this for breakfast the next day. Not overly sweet but lots of flavor. Liked it a lot!

This was great, the only thing is that the batter may be a bit stiff making it hard to spread into a pan -- if this happens, adding a little milk while mixing worked for me.

I often make variations of recipes I like to have a few new options. This one turned out lovely:

I left out the drizzled butter and the crumbled topping altogether. Doubled the cake recipe, added a table spoon of cinnamon, and put a few teaspoons of batter aside. I mixed in a cup of raisins to the main batter and poured it in a rectangular. Then added extra cinnamon to the few teaspoons, some vanilla extract, and a little cocoa powder just to darken -- then used it to marble the cake. I baked it and frosted it after it cooled, with a simple white butter frosting (butter, powdered sugar, teaspoon cinnamon, and milk to consistency). I served this at a Christmas party and people were crazy for it.

This coffee cake is amazing! I love the texture and I've made it several times already. It is perfectly moist, not excessively sweet, and the tastes only becomes better and better with a few days. 

I would recommend doubling the crumb top recipe, I think the original is a little bit skimpy. I added nuts on top of the topping for a supplement of pazazz! 

DO NOT DOUBLE THIS RECIPE, though. Every time I have doubled the recipe, the bottom had to be burnt in order for the inside to be cooked.

With extra milk added (about 1/4 c.), this really is a perfectly simply coffee cake. We also use brown sugar instead of white in the cake itself, which gives it a bit different flavor and texture. When it comes out of the oven the line where the cake meets topping is like they mixed together, and the result is yummy! It's usually gone in less than a day at our house.

I love love this coffee cake! I followed everyone's directions and added double sugar and double topping and more milk. I also ended up putting a half a cup of bisquick and a cup of four instead and it came out so amazing!!!!! really crumbly/spongy it was perfect! I also added nutmeg to the topping that was a great idea! I ended up having to bake it more than double the suggested time but it didn't burn edges were crisp though which I like!

Made this recipe as written except used butter instead of shortening and used 2/3 cup milk. For the topping,I used about 1.5 tablespoons flour and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I also added about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Baked it in my toaster oven and it came out great. Cake was not too sweet and will use it often for cakes with rich frosting/icing. Next time will try chocolate chips and coconut in the topping to give it a german chocolate twist.

I agree that this is a good basic coffee cake recipe. I made the recipe as is. A true coffee cake is not overly sweet so the recommended sugar is a good amount. I believe I will use this as a base recipe for many variations to come.

For years I've been searching for a recipe that would produce flaky coffee cake, not cakey cake.  I tried all kinds of complicated recipes but was disappointed time and again.  This recipe was perfect.  We're trying to cut back on sugar so I used only 4T sugar in the batter (figuring the topping would make up for the less sweet cake).  I also poured the butter over the topping mixture (I don't like the topping to be dry).  It turned out perfect - sweet, flaky but moist.  The whole family loves it.

Although this was an easy recipe, I was not that impressed with the results. It was heavy and dry and not what I was hoping for. We were in the mood for a moist, struessely coffee cake. I am at altitude and that might have made it a bit too dry. It was easy to put together though!

Delicious with some modifications. I added more sugar to the batter, I used four tablespoons of white sugar and four tablespoons of brown sugar. I also had to add and extra 1/4 cup of milk as the batter was more like dough without it. I also doubled the topping, mixing in the melted butter instead of drizzling it over. I put half the batter in the pan, crumbled half the topping over it, then topped with the rest of the batter (easier said than done!) and topping. Baked at 425 (well, 400 in a convection oven) for about 22 minutes for it to be perfectly done. It was delicious, moist cake and crunchy sweet topping.

Yes, it is quick, but it came out pretty dry for me. The batter wouldn't spread very well into the pan so the whole cake came out uneven. Tasted like coffee cake & with less mess than the normal crumbles on top, but still not a recipe i'll use again.

I doubled this recipe and put it in a 13x9 inch pan so I baked it for an extra 10 minutes. I added an extra 1/2 c milk and forgot to add the melted butter on the top. I was making this for a breakfast party of all men and had last minute notice so I needed a recipe that was easy and quick (plus required no trips to the store). I haven't had a chance to taste it but it looks and smells wonderful!

This was so delicious and easy to make!  The only change I had was I added a little bit of melted butter on top of the sugar topping as well as under.  The extra weight of the melted butter brought the topping down into the batter and made this absolutely delectable sugary filling in parts of the cake.

Unlike some others, I didn't read the reviews before I decided to make this coffee cake Christmas morning. It has a great rating and I had all the ingredients on hand. Well, I woke up early to start. The batter seemed terribly thick and more like cookie dough, but I spread it in the pan as best I could. The kids were up shortly thereafter and we waited nearly 40 minutes for this cake to bake. We added 5 minute intervals to the 15 minute cook time, checking with a toothpick. At one point I thought it was done and it was just the topping sticking to the toothpick...nope! Raw in the middle. When it was finally finished I had a very dense cake. It was edible and the kids were famished, but we had to break it apart for my 2 year old twins, it was too tough for them to bite off on their own. There was one piece left over and within hours it was hard as a rock. I think, even with suggestions of others, I won't try this recipe again...

This recipe is tastes great and is super easy. I made only two modifications, added a splash more milk and also doubled the topping and raked it through the cake. This cake has a perfect texture so delecate and not too sweet, which is a wonderful contrast to the sweet crunchy top. Will make again and again!

Very good for a basic recipe.  I followed the other reviewers and used 2/3 cups of sugar and added cinnamon to the batter. I also put in a dallop of sour cream for moistness.  I didn't have brown sugar so I just used white and it was fine.

Quick and easy. My family loved it! Keep a close eye on it, I cooked it a bit less than recommended time and I was glad I took it out of the oven when I did. The topping is very nice, just the right amount of sweetness.

This coffee cake was very easy to make, but I thik next time I'll add another egg and maybe a little more milk. It's a little dry, and the batter was hard to spread in the pan.Other than that, the topping was very easy to make and there was plenty of it go go around the pan.

Cake turned out great! After reading other reviews, I added milk to the batter (it was WAY too thick, almost like peanut butter!) and also some mixed spice to the batter (cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice blend).  Instead of drizzling melted butter and then sprinkling the topping, I mixed the butter in with the topping and sort of crubmled it all over.  It gave the streusel a nice crunchiness. My husband asked me to make this again the next day!

The cake itself is so simple, moist and delicious.  Because I was using a darker pan, I turned the temp down to 350 F and baked a bit longer (5-10 min longer).  It came out SUPER moist.  I also added 1 T vinegar to the batter.  I think that helped.  I also added chopped apples.  It added to the moistness and delicate flavor of the cake.  The crumbly topping was just OK.  I like my streusel toppings really nice and thick and crumbly.  So the 2nd time I used this recipe, I substituted the crumble mixture with a modified Martha Stewart mixture:

(You can scale this down):
2 3/4   cups all-purpose flour  
1   cup packed light-brown sugar  
1/2   teaspoon salt  
1   cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened 
My additions:
1 tsp - 1 T cinnamon (my addition)
1/4 cup of walnuts

Just form clumps and add to the top.  

Overall, great proportions with the cake. Thanks for sharing!

It's a good base recipe, and I liked the cinnamon-sugar topping. I think next time I make it, I'll add either raisins or apple pieces to the batter... or maybe blueberries or raspberries. Either way, it's great that it uses basic ingredients - 9 times out of 10, I'll have all the stuff I need to make it.

I'd really give this one 4 and a half stars if I could. I used 2/3 cup sugar and 3/4 cup milk, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and I drizzled the butter after I sprinkled the top with the brown sugar mixture, not before. I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the batter (I didn't measure, just shook some in). This was a very easy recipe and it turned out well, so I will definitely make it again.

I was not as impressed as everyone else who has made this recipe- the topping was OK and the cake was rather ordinary. All right for a quick solution but not something I would rush to make again.

All and all a good coffee cake base, but I took others suggestions, like more sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, milk etc. Several people commented on the cake being dry so I added some sour cream. With these additions, the end result was very, very good. With all of the rich desserts sitting on the party table, this was a nice and not so terribly sweet alternative for our guests. Thanks for a great start!

This is an easy recipe with a yummy result.  I used 2/3 cup white sugar as suggested by others.  I also added nutmeg & cinnamon to the batter.  Instead of the melted butter, i added softened butter to the topping and crumbled it with the sugar and flour.  The top was crunchy and the middle soft and fluffy, just as coffee cake should be.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I just took this out of the oven and it's very good, Some of the other users noted that it was a little bland so I added cinnamon to the batter and before I put the (doubled) topping on, I chopped up a bunch of fresh black cherries.  I am sure you could use anything, berries, peaches, etc, but it is awesome. Thanks!!

I lost the delicious coffee cake recipe my mother gave me and thought I'd try this one since it sounded similar.  I was really disappointed.  I added more milk to make the cake moist, but the flavor wasn't great.  It had a very floury taste (no good flavor!).  I even added extra cinnamon, etc to the batter!  I think it needs more sugar and less flour... SOMETHING to make the cake sweet.. It took us a week to choke this down.  I might try it again, but I will definitely be changing the amount of flour vs the amount of sugar, etc.

I ought to have read the reviews before making this coffee cake.  I found the topping a bit dry and would have put a little shortening in it.  Overall it was good, though as I used butter for the cake shortening and it was fine.  This is a great coffee cake if  you need something quick, but have only basic ingredients rather than things like buttermilk that are asked for in other recipes.  I would make it again, but maybe get creative with other ingredients.

It is a good cake with a great topping. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 3/4 cup of milk. The batter was thicker than I expected and I had to switch to a smaller pan. I was surprised that it took only 15 minutes to bake.

My daughter loved making this with me - it was easy. But kinda bland. Needs more cinnamon. I used butter substitute instead of shortening and cut back the sugar slightly. Too much flour in the topping. I'll add more cinnamon and add nuts next time, maybe a streusel topping.  I also would cook it at a lower temperature.  Still, it's nice and simple with a cup of coffee on a Sunday morning.

I  increased the ingredients by half.  I also added a little more milk to thin the batter.  Added chopped pecans.  It was wonderful.  The next time i make it I will not 1 1/2 times the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Served it warm.  I also drizzled frosting made with butter, powdered sugar and milk over the cake.  Yummy!

I made this vegan for my daughter, and it was easy and delicious! I switched out the egg for "Bob's Red Mill Egg Replacer", the butter for Earth Balance, and the milk for soy milk. It was absolutely delicious!  Easy if you need to switch out ingredients due to lifestyle, or allergies. Also, I used a 9 inch round cake pan instead of a 9 inch square pan. I plan on making this again. :-)

I made a number of changes, but this basic recipe is great.  I doubled all the measurements and used a 9x13" pan. I upped the sugar in the cake to 1 cup, cut in 1/2 cup lard AND 1/2 cup butter, added 1/2 cup plain yogurt along with the milk, added a bit more vanilla.  For the topping, I doubled everything except the flour. I baked it at 425 for about 22 minutes.  It came out wonderfully and was well enjoyed by our Wednesday evening prayer group.

I've made this three times exactly as written and it is not a great or even good version of coffee cake.  I know, I know, tons of other reviews that bestow its greatness, but for us, it just didn't cut it.  The dough is very overworked given the instructions and there is no need to do the temperature adjustment.  The cake is bland, it needs more vanilla and/or a smidge of salt, it needs help!

I've also made this with some modifications of my own, as well as incorporating some from other reviews; still not the bomb of a coffee cake that I am on the hunt for.  Will keep looking.

I am not sure why people rate recipes five stars, when they then list how they had altered the recipe.  I just pulled this out of the oven, and the brown sugar appears to be just sitting on top and burned in spots. Oven is new and true...have not had problem with other recipes.  Recipe was not edited.  Said to pour batter in pan, at two different times. I agree, that I would mix the butter and brown sugar together, next time. Will give it three stars here.  Will change it up if it tastes better than it looks.

i made this recipe in a muffin tin. It was good but heavy. I figure it is because i used buttered shortening instead of regular shortening.  I also used the melted butter like the recipe calls for. I think this is good recipe but make sure that when you use the shortening it is regular not buttered or do not use the melted butter

It was wonderful! I didn't add any extra sugar like other reviewers did; I made this in a bind! I didn't realize I didn't have any milk, so I used coconut milk instead, and added 1/4 cup more so it would have a more cake batter-like texture. You couldn't even taste the coconut milk! The cake was so fluffy, and the topping was just delicious. I added pecans on top as well, and mixed the topping  with the butter beforehand. Our guests loved it, there is none left! I definitely recommend it, and I will make it again!

It was very good!  Here are some changes I made:

I used half the sugar  and probably could have made it with even less.

I made a little extra topping and integrated it in the mix then put the rest on top.  Gives it more flavors.

I loved this recipe it was pretty easy and really yummy. I did make a couple changes, instead of using shortening I used coconut fat and a bit of butter. Also for the topping I melted a but of butter and drizzled over the top as in the recipe, then I melted more butter and mixed it with the brown sugar mixture and put it on the cake . it was really good, and the topping sort of drizzled down the bottom of the cake in some places. It was really tasty, and everyone loved it. I will definetly be keeping this recipe.

doubled the recipe, didn't change a thing other than bake it at 350F for 25 mins.  Was perfectly done in that amount of time.  Was just ok. Was expecting something amazing after reading all the reviews, so I was quite disappointed after tasting it. Will not make again.

I was searching for a coffee cake recipe and this fit the bill!  It was so easy!  I made the recipe as written.  It was wonderful!  The cake was so light and the topping was sweet and crunchy.  I could taste the butter too!  I baked it for 15 minutes.  I did not find it dry.  I will definitely make this again.  To the people who altered the recipe, the cake portion of a coffee cake is not supposed to be sweet.

I made this as written only doubled the topping. I wish I had left it alone as I think it would have been better. This is a coffee cake. It is not meant to be really sweet and this was perfect and the topping would have been enough as written.

"Awesome" and "super yummy" were the comments I heard from the family on this one. We followed B Spradley's review: doubled the sugar, added 1/4 cup more milk,  and dragged the topping into the batter to mix it in a bit. I didn't have shortening, so used stick margarine.   We made it vegan by using Uncle Bobs egg substitute, soy milk, and margarine.  It took about 30 minutes total to bake for some reason (10 minutes longer than the recipe called for). I poked the middle with a wooden skewer to test for doneness, and when  it came out clean, I pulled it out of the oven, let it cool a bit and firm up for about 10 minutes, then served it nice and warm.    Super delish! It's a keeper!

I added the extra sugar and milk as many suggested on the reviews. It does taste very much like Drakes Coffee Cake, only better as it has  none of the additives. It was delicious!

After reading several of the reviews I decided to alter it to their opinions as well as my own taste preferences. I added 1/4 cup milk to the batter.  Plus 1/4 cup more sugar and 3 Tablespoons brown sugar. As well as 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. (the nutmeg gave more depth to the flavor.) I also upped the vanilla from 1/2 tsp to 1 1/2 tsp. If using medium egg, increase to 2 eggs instead of  1.

I used a greased and floured 9 x 13 air bake pan.  Spread cake mix evenly into prepared pan.

I didn't pour the butter over teh cake. Instead added melted butter to topping and use 3/4 cup brown sugar.  Mix melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon (double cinnamon for topping) add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg until well blended. Sprinkle evenly on top of cake . If you have any bare spots lightly sprinkle plain brown sugar over top of cake. I also dragged my knife through the cake mixture, after it was in pan and topped. That allowed the crumble mixture to go through the top layers of the cake. In the air bake 9 x 13 I baked it for 18 minutes at 425. Enjoy warm out of the oven moist, and deliciously full of flavor. 

I will be making again can't wait to try one of the other reviewers opinion of adding chopped nuts. Apples or any other choice of fresh fruit could be used in conjunction with original toppings.

This was really, really good. I doubled up the recipe. The cake batter tasted a little too "unsweet"so I added 1/3 cup light brown sugar & also the same amount of white sugar. I don't use shortening so I substituted canola oil. I also made an extra batch of crumble (I am a sugar addict). My husband loved it & he said the best dessert I have ever made. He's not into sweets either! I am making two more today as thank you gifts. This tasted better the next day. The cake needed time to cool and the crumble to set,

I really liked this coffee cake.  The crumble topping was excellent!  I would use this recipe for that alone!  It did take much longer to cook than what was suggested in the recipe.  I did add blueberries to the batter,  and it was a moist yet wonderfully textured coffee cake!  Thanks for the recipe.

I added extra sugar and milk like everyone else did and doubled the topping. I added 1/2 of apple juice . Its also good when you half the batter and put a can of apple pie filling in the middle. Poured the rest of the batter on top, added the topping and it was a hit. Just an idea.

Made this with Gluten Free flour and used 9 tbsp sugar instead of the called-for 6 tbsp. Made 1.5 times the topping. Very good! It was a little sweet for me, so next time I would make it with the original 6 tbsp sugar.

I made a lot of changes. I added to dough 1/2 C chopped, dried and reconstituted bing (sour) cherries (20 min soak in hot water, 1/2 t cognac and 1/2 t vanilla -- you could use 1 t amaretto or almond extract. Dry thoroughly between paper towels). To dough,  I added the zest of 1 lemon and sprinkled 1/2 cup sliced unsalted almonds on top before baking along with the melted butter and sugar. I omitted the cinnamon. I used 2 t baking powder rather than 1-1/2 and baked it in an 8x8" pyrex baking dish at 425 deg F for 20 minutes in the center of oven.  It was heavenly!!!

Despite some of the reports of dry consistency in some of the other reviews, mine came out quite moist, perhaps the cherry addition was helpful. I highly recommend this recipe.  Please try my changes and let us know if you liked it!!!

Delicious! I was a little bit worried when the batter barely covered the bottom of the pan.  I was making it at  party and several friends said that it was to thick and that when they had made coffee cake it was layered and thinner, they said that mine might be more like bread.  However when i took it out of the oven it dissapeared mysteriously within minutes.  The cake was moist and delicious and the struesel on top was perfect.  One change that I made was using butter rather than shortening.

I'm giving this 5 stars for what it is, a quick coffee cake.  That being said, my husband and I thought it was very good.  I made the recipe as written.  I used coconut oil instead of shortening, and added some macadamia nuts to the topping.  It was moist and sweet enough.  Will definitely make again.

I made this cake this morning for something quick to go with our Thanksgiving dinner. I have to confess, though, that I followed the recommendations from other reviewers also, increasing the sugar and milk. While this sort of makes the recipe a whole new one, I'm reviewing to say thank you for the base recipe. It's delicious and I'm sure I will make it again with the modifications. Happy Thanksgiving!

Very easy and quick. I also increased all ingredients and made it in a spring foam pan. Be sure to cook it a bit longer. I also added some baking powder and skipped the sugary topping. That way it can be a less guilty breakfast cake.

I agree with other users that this recipe needs to be tweaked. I wish I would have read the reviews before i made it. The cake is a little dry and flavorless. Next time I will add more milk and sugar to the cake and make more of the topping so that I can cut a little of it into the batter.

This is a great recipe for Sunday morning when I want something sweet for breakfast. I do not like real sweet cakes so I thought the amount of sugar was perfect.  The cake portion of the recipe is great as is, you could top this with almost anything. Not quite a pound cake and not quite a typical cake. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made this many times with these changes: I always double it and use a 9x13 pan. I use mayonnaise instead of the shortening and it keeps the cake moist and tender. I use 1 cup of sugar in the cake (doubled recipe). A keeper!

I tried this recipe this morning making it gluten free and it was awesome!! I doubled the recipe when I made it, substituting my gluten free flour for the all purpose flour. Other than that I made no changes and it was very moist and delicious! I have saved the recipe because no one had a clue it was gluten free and they all loved it!

This is a good base recipe, a little tweaking and it's great. My cake was very good & moist, but I did make some changes. Instead of shortening I used mayonnaise. I also used 1/3 cup of sugar. In the topping I doubled the cinnamom. I would definately make this again.

Yum! Super fast, easy. Switched brown sugar for white (just because that is what I had) also added about 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the topping. Delicious!

The cake part turned out perfect but the edges burned and so did part of the topping. I think the temp. was to high. I don't think I will use again nobody in my house liked it.

Quick, simple and absolutely amazing!  The cake is moist, the topping is a little crunchy (and crumbly-beware parents), and the whole is all around delicious.  Unlike the other reviewers, I actually cut the sugar (about 2/3 of what is called for) but added about a half teaspoon of cardamom.  It turned out so well that this will be my go-to coffee cake recipe from now on.

This recipe makes a great, easy coffee cake.  I did make a couple of modifications, however.  First, I doubled the sugar, which gives it a nice, sweet flavor.  I also used buttermilk instead of milk.  This makes a moist, sweet cake with a delicious topping.

This recipe is great, I've. Made it many times and it always comes out excellent. Someone said it was like Drakes Coffee cakes and they were right!  I like to add more cinnamon  and more sugar into the cake batter as well. Try this and you will want to keep making it.

This was good but very dry.  I can't blame the recipe entirely though becuase I read the ingredients but not the instructions, and creamed my sugar with butter (I don't use shortening), than added the egg and dry ingredients.  I think this made mine a bit too light, but the taste was still great.  I had to stop my husband from eating the whole pan. Next time, I'll follow the instructions and see if it is a bit more moist.

Aside from increasing the milk to 3/4C I followed the recipe exactly. I do agree that the topping is a bit dry, and would probably add the melted butter to the topping instead of putting it onto the cake. I don't see the problem with adding the flour to the topping as it is such a small amount. I will definitely keep this one around for a quick tasty dessert, and might try some variation like adding coconut or oatmeal to the topping as well.

I followed the tips of doubling the surgar and adding extra milk. Yum, what a great cake. I also, as one review suggested, melted the butter and stirred in the brown sugar and added the flower and drizzled it on top that way and then with a knife cut the topping into the cake a bit. I also added chopped pecans an skor pieces to the top. Served warm with ice cream or on its own, it's so good.

I've made this recipe several times.  My husband, my 15-month old daughter, and I LOVE this coffee cake.  The first time I made it I followed the original recipe.  It was a bit on the dry side.  The next couple times I added 1/2 a cup of apple sauce.  This gave it all the moisture that was lacking in the original recipe.  Definitely a keeper!

texture is a little tough despite proper cutting in of shortening and not over mixing . Flavor of dough is more like a pancake-- speaking of which, was disappointed that it was rather flat-- only rose to about 1 1/2 inches. I had to make extra streusel just to make it interesting

Delicious, versatile and everyone loved it. Can't ask for more! Next time I will pour half the batter into the pan, then sprinkle the topping mix (which I doubled) then repeat layers and swirl with a knife.

I came home from work and suddenly I was hit with urge to bake something. Well, I was hoping for a quick recipe that didn't require alot of exotic ingredients and I think this recipe was just what I needed. I already had everything I needed, it doesn't take a long time and the reviews from others were very helpful.I took the advice of adding extra vanilla (no such thing as too much as far as I'm concerned)and extra milk, but I think I put too much because it was a bit moister than I had intended. Will make again and add only 1/4 cup extra milk. Try it when in a pinch, I think you'll like it.

Really nice basic, fast coffee cake.  I used whole wheat flour, real butter, and coconut sugar in the dough, sucanat for the topping (and just made a crumble rather than melt the butter, extra cinnamon of course!)  The dough wasn't sweet, but this made a LOT of topping, too much topping, really so I didn't even notice the dough.  Next time I'd sweeten the dough slightly more but reduce the topping (and I like a lot of topping).  What I like best about this is it went from mixing bowl to oven to table in about thirty minutes, and with my passel o' hungry men waiting, speed is of the essence!  Oh, last thing, this really did take a lot of extra milk.  I'd guess I went with closer to a cup of milk.

Came out pretty good.  I took some advice from other reviewers and added a bit more milk and sugar, not much though.  Cake was still a little dry but good.  If I make it again I'll add more flavor by mixing additional sugar and cinnamon into the batter itself.

I made a few modifications to this recipe because without them I thought it tasted like a box cake mix , so I added 2 tbsp rum, doubled the vanilla, added 6 tblsp brown sugar and a little more milk and an additional egg, fantastic and great for last minute company because it is so fast to make!!!!!

The perfect QUICK coffee cake!!! Very tasty and moist. I added a bit of cinnamon to the batter, doubled the recipe and the cake was perfect. Be generous with you streusel topping.

Great recipe, easy to modify.  I used almond milk, a smidge more vanilla.  I doubled the sugar , I dont know how it will taste without the extra sugar because it is perfect doubled.  I made the recipe with whole milk once but prefer almond.  I also add 2tbs butter to the batter in addition to the butter on the top.Overall really good...made it three times in the last month!

This is a great coffee cake recipe.  I make it up for my kids in the morning and often they take an extra piece to school with them.  I did double the sugar and at least add 1/4 cup of milk extra to the batter.  I tend to add milk until the batter is the right thickness but this is from experience.  I did double the vanilla too and added craisins and slivered almonds but I had these on hand.

Wow!!! This is a very tasty  coffee cake! I couldn't find my trusty old coffee cake recipe so i thought I'd try this one and I'm glad I did. I made exact except doubling the recipe and adding scant teaspoon backing soda and buttermilk instead of milk. Also I mixed butter with cinnamon sugar mixture and sprinkled on top. It baked up very quickly so be sure to watch time or it may burn like I almost did! Thankfully it turned out beautifully!!! Hope this helps.

I made this two weeks ago and it was perfect. Used white whole wheat flour, and butter instead of shortening. Otherwise followed amounts and it was plenty sweet for my donut loving kids. Plan to make again tomorrow morning.

I did not enjoy the coffee cake, the recipe seemed off to me in the first place, this was my first time making a coffee cake in a long time. Its too bland, and who I never heard of putting flour in the crumbly top mix. also the Directions seem to have a mistake also.

Make sure to read reviews before making!  I made the mistake of not doing so and while I was making it, I thought the mixture seemed dry (many added 1/4 cup milk) and after it came out of the oven, I thought the cake could be sweeter (most doubled the sugar!)  I also liked the idea of dragging a knife through the mixture so that the butter and topping goes to the bottom in some spots.  It was good but it needs the above adjustments and I'm looking forward to making it again (the RIGHT way).

Great recipe! Very moist cake. I read through the reviews, and decide to do the following:
-increase the granulated sugar by about 70%
-drizzle the melted butter not on top of the batter, but on the topping once it was placed on top of the batter.
-added 2tbsp granulated sugar and doubled the cinnamon in the topping

I am someone who ALWAYS reduces the sugar, usually by about 50%, but I nearly doubled the sugar for this coffee cake- the amount in the actual recipe is strangely low. I would definitely recommend increasing the sugar by at least 50%, double it if you like your cake sweet!
Also, next time I make this I will definitely double the topping.

Thanks to all the excellent review(ers), this was a terrific recipe!!! Definitely needed that extra 1/4 c milk (I used almond milk for all the milk) I added almost double the sugar in the cake (almost 3/4 c) and poured the melted butter on top of the strusle topping. Using a butter knifre to swirl it in. I don't recommend salt at all it you are using salted butter. 20 minutes was perfect in my oven.  I used white whole wheat flour for great fiber without compromising taste! (you gotta check that out. : ) Thank you for the recipe, it will be used many many times to come!

Wow. This turned out great! I subbed in 1/4c whole wheat flour to make it a bit "healthier". I may even try a little more next time. 

Anyway, I also took the reviewers suggestions and did 2/3c of sugar instead of 6 T. It was good. I wasn't sure if those reviewers did 2/3c + 6 T. If they did, that's A LOT of sugar. I might cut back to 1/2c next time.

Topping? A lot of reviewers said to double the topping. I did maybe 3/4 c brown sugar and didn't use all of it. I'll just do the 1/2c in the recipe next time. Put topping on first, then drizzled the butter. This is so yum!

I made this coffee cake using some user's advice. I added an extra 3 tbsp sugar and about a quarter cup more of milk. Other than that I stayed true to the recipe. It was really good, very moist and not too sweet however there was a greasy feel to the cake so next time I might add either 1/4 cup or less of butter favored shortening. OH! I also added more butter. I added 2 tbsp to the brown sugar mix but also drizzled 2 tbsp onto the batter before addding brownsugar mix. It was delish! Very buttery! I won't do that next time since I'll be adding the butter flavored shortening. Thank you for a very quick and delicious coffee cake.

Great cake! I did not change any of the ingredients but what I did was what another reviewer said and added pecans and dessicated coconut powder.  I just roasted both of it and then sprinkled it on top of the sugar mixture. The recipe as such  has jus tthe right sweetness. I guess if you want it reallly sweet you might have to increase the amount of sugar.

This was great!  I took other reviewers' advice, and added an additional 1/4 cup milk and doubled the sugar.  I also added one apple, cut up.  We like the apple, but I think for next time I'll back off on the sugar a bit (closer to the original recipe), and add walnuts with the apple.  A great recipe when you're in a hurry!

Great easy recipe made with everything I keep on hand.  I did read the reviews first so the only changes I made were to add enough sugar to equal a half cup and added about 1/4 cup more milk.  Thanks for sharing, a perfect Sunday morning sweet.

Followed the recipe to a "T" and the kids loved it!  I didn't have time to make any modifications.  I think I'll put the butter with the brown sugar mix next time though.  And I didn't get to even taste it, so I cannot tell you if it was dry or not. It was a very quick and easy recipe.

I woke up this morning wanting to make a coffee cake with just what I had on hand. This recipe was awsome and so easy as I am not the baker.  I scanned the reveiws and did what they did which was double the sugar and 1/4 cup more milk.  So moist and I also mixed melted butter with dry ingred. and drizzled on top then used a knife to cut through it.  Definitely a keeper.  Husband is in kitchen cutting a second piece right now!

This cake is simply amazing. Have made it thrice now and it has never failed me. the first time I made it word for word as given in recipie, and it turned out just great. the crunchy top complements beautifully the softness of the overall cake. next time i omitted the crunchy top, and instead added a very thin layer of cocoa-milk-butter in the middle of batter while pouring in pan...and the result was yummm. this cake just vanishes from the table super fast!! love it!!

This coffee cake took twice as long in my oven and was a really dense odd texture. My family wasn't impressed and I wouldn't make it again.

This is a good coffee cake. I had made more topping as someone else suggested and I'm glad I did. Next time I will put some batter on the bottom, put a layer of topping and then more batter and more topping. I had to bake mine almost 25 minutes and then let it set about 10 mins. Try this one if you need a quick coffee cake, the whole thing is made and ready to eat in less than an hour! *almost forgot: I made with 2/3 cup sugar and a bit extra milk. Also, instead of melted butter, I just cut in more shortening to the topping, REALLY good!

It really is quick and also delicious.  In taking other viewer's advice, I drizzled the melted butter over the topping.  Will definitely make again and again.

This was not a great recipe for Coffee Cake. The cake was not flavorful and the topping was dry and powdery.

I really liked this recipe- it was quick and easy.  I had limited sugar on hand, so it was a perfect recipe for what I was looking for.  My Husband and daughter didnt care for it...maybe not sweet enough? 
The one complaint I'd have is that it was really messy- fell apart easily, compared to some others I've made. I'd make it again, at least for myself!

This had a nice flavor, but the batter was too thick for it to rise; I think next time I'll add some milk and see if that doesn't help.

I read the reviews before I made this recipe so I knew that I would be altering it some.  I like sweet, so I doubled the sugar and the and added chocolate.  I think it came out great.  It was quick and moist the topping was just some of the dry mix and bron sugar and almonds, but it was very tasty.

Recipe used all the ingredients I had and turned out very good. I took others suggestions and increased the amount of milk to 3/4 cup and sugar to 2/3 cup. I added tossed sweet cherries under the topping which definitely helped add flavor. I thought the baking temp was high and had to decrease to 350 and bake longer.

This was good...not fantastic, but good.  I was worried because I thought the batter would be more the pourable consistency of cake batter, but it was really thick and hard to spread into the pan, but it baked up well.  The topping was good...maybe if I make this again I'll put some oatmeal in for a little oomph.  I'll probably try a couple other recipes, too.  Thanks!

I wanted a quick coffee cake recipe that tastes like mom used to make.  This is it.  Even with several substitutions/changes it turned out great.  
I used butter instead of shortening, heavy cream instead of milk (yikes on fat but it was all I had), and 2 eggs since they were small.

I found this easy and quick for 3 starving children, but on the other hand, was kind of disappointed in the flavor over all as well as the cooking directions.  It calls for 1/2 cup of milk, but I had to use 1 full cup.  Was worried about it not rising and possibly being too runny, but it turned out fine.  I will add more flavor to the batter next time as well as use a different topping.
Over all I will use it for my kids, they seemed to like it and that is all I care about.

This is an awesome recipe!!  I had never made coffee cake from scratch before, and in the middle of making it i thought "oh no what did I do wrong."  But i went ahead and finished it, and it turned out WONDERFUL!  The dish was emptied in minutes!  Thanks alot for a wonderful addition to my recipe box!

this was a very quick and easy cake, but I made some changes as suggested by others.  The batter was extrememly thick, so I did add a little more milk which should have added to the moistness.   Also, I put the melted butter on top of the crumbs, instead of on top of the cake.  This also helped so it wasn't so dry. I would make this again!
