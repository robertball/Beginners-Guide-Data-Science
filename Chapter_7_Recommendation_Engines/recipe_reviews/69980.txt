This was good, it has a very nice flavor, but I like more cinnamon when working with orange. It does need work  to make it better. DEFINATELY follow the last review about switching from 1/2 cup of melted butter to 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/4 cup oil, this is critical to making it better. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon not 1/2 t to the topping along with alittle zest from the orange. And to the batter, I added another 1/4 t and 1/4 t nutmeg, this makes the actual cake much more tasty.

It was pretty good.  The orange and cinnamon did go well together, but the cake was a bit bland.

I doubled the recipe and added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar and added my own favorite cinnamon/oat crumb topping. Instead of a 10" pan, I divided the batter into 12 jumbo muffin pans and the end result were very cute mini cakes. The cake itself was very moist and rose high but it was not sweet enough at all and was a bit too oily. If I had not added the extra sugar it would have tasted like bread. If you make this for breakfast and are not expecting something sweet it is ok but if you are comparing it to a traditional coffee cake it loses big time. I may try again with an additional cup of sugar and less oil and see what happens.

This was so tasty and light!  I was a little worried about the consistency as I put it in the tin but it turned out perfectly.  Definitely making this again!

The cake came out moist and tasted like orange cake. I'm probably going to throw some dried cranberries in next time.

This was really good, a little dry, but not too bad.  I put a thin glaze over the top, which really helped, my boys LOVED it, they ate 1/3 of the cake in one afternoon!

Simple and delicious! I made this as written, only adding a few thinly sliced oranges on top before sprinkling with the brown sugar mixture and a dusting of powdered sugar after it was cool (for presentation only). If you are looking for a sweet coffee cake, this one is probably not for you. It is only slightly sweet, and the orange flavor is very subtle. It is very similar to a recipe that I received from my husband's aunt, who is 100% Italian, called "Torta Orancia". The Italians generally don't like overly sweet desserts, and my husband, who is not a dessert eater, loved this. I used a 10" springform pan, and baked it for exactly 30 minutes, and it was perfect. It resulted in about a 1-1/4" high cake. If you like yours a little thicker, I'd recommend using an 8" or 9" cake pan, and adjust the baking time slightly. Will make this again! Thanks!

The cake was very light but needed "something".  I put a tsp. vanilla in but may try a little more next time.  Needed a little more topping too.  The 10" pan was too big, hardly covered the bottom.  I used an 8" spring form pan for the recommended time and it turned out perfectly cooked.

This was okay.  It was a little dry and not very flavorful.
