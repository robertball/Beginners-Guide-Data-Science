I served this for a baby shower with cinnamon pita chips and it was a huge hit. The smaller you chop up the fruit the better and I drained a little of the juice off before serving just so it was easier to eat. I'll definitely make this again!

Made this yesterday for a family bbq and everyone loved it!  I halved the recipe, but I shouldn't of.  It was gone in a flash! I did add about 1/2 a jalapeno, diced and some chopped cilantro as suggested by another reviewer.  Fantastic summer recipe, I will definitely make this again.

This was super! I added one less teaspoon of the 2 tablespoons of vinegar and also added kiwi since we didnt have enough strawberries.

So yummy!  I served it with cinnamon/sugar pita chips and it was devoured!  I had a little bit leftover the next day and threw it in my blender with some vanilla yogurt and ice to make one of the best smoothies I've ever tasted!

This is myth shattering inasmuch that something this healthy can taste this  good.  We're at the height of strawberry season here in West Tennessee, so this recipe is right on time.  Bearing in mind previous reviews, I was cautious with the Balsamic vinegar.  One tablespoon was  plenty for me.  And if you know as little about mangoes as I did, I suggest you search the net for tips on how to buy and how to chop.  Thank you, Sarah.  Just how do stay out of this long enough for it to rest??

I made this for a Superbowl party and everyone had at least two helpings. I used the juice of one whole lime and lemon. I was tempted to reduce the balsamic vinegar but used the full suggested 2 tablespoons - glad I did. Served with cinnamon chips but would also pair well with chicken, fish or salad.

Very yummy - made for a potluck and it was a bit hit.  Not as sweet as we expected it would be, but homemade cinnamon/sugar tortilla chips really helped sweeten (per my husband).  Definitely planning on making it again (I made it with some fresh mint).

Refreshing!  Good on ice cream.  It went a little mushy the next day, so it's best fresh.

Refreshing salsa, indeed! I made as-written and ate with chicken in a spinach salad. I might make again to use as a salsa for cinnamon chips--but reduce the juices. There seemed to be too much and it made the salsa super-acidic the next day. Don't be tempted to leave out the vinegar! It enhances the flavors--if anything, start with 1T and add a little more as you want.

Everybody enjoyed this.  The balsamic vinegar balanced nicely with the sweet of the fruit and juices.  This was also nice paired with grilled pork chops.  I'd suggest eating it with cinnamon and sugar chips rather than tortilla chips.

I have made this twice since I found the recipe!  Yummm!  The first time I nixed the orange juice and used a walnut/raspberry vinegrette instead of the balsamic vinegar.  I liked the added sweetness.  The second time I made it exactly like the recipe and didn't care for the extra liquid.  In the future will half the liquid for the recipe.  Great with grahm crackers!

One of the two mangos I used was tart and it made the batch too tart with the lemon juice. Once I added another, sweeter mango and a little sugar it was really good. Would use this over plain grilled chicken too. Great with the suggested cinnamon pita chips.

Yum! I wanted to serve this as a savory salsa, so I added a jalapeno. I used the liquid to marinate chicken breasts and grilled them, then topped with the salsa. Excellent and I'll use this often when mangos are available.

This was pretty good!  The only thing i didn't like was that i felt the orange juice taste was a little strong.  Next time i think i will cut back on that.  Other than that it made a delicious snack!  I ate it with cinnamon sugar chips, which helped to cut out the sourness of the orange juice.  Thanks for the recipe!

I give this a 5 star cause it is delicious.  I used less ingredients than the recipe calls for since I was making a small about.  I used 1t balsamic vinegar, 1/3 orange juice, 1/4 lemon juice, juice from 1 lime, 1 mango and about 5 to 6 large strawberries. Ate this salsa w/nopal & linaza tostadas.  Try them they are really good.

I accidentally switched the limes and lemon measurements so that may be why this was bitter the 1st day.  Even so, by the 2nd day it was good enough to eat by itself

Loved this.  Definitely add the cilantro and jalapenos, to taste.  I served over grilled chicken but saved remaining to serve with tortilla chips later!

I've made this a few times, and really love with a little jalapeno. It's great as a salsa with cinnamon pita chips, but it also tastes great on white rice and broiled tilapia!

It 'needs something' and I think that something is either buttloads of fresh good salt (no iodized), chilli or a green object like spring onion, parsley or coriander (cilantro) or all of the above.  It needs to be 'more'.  I had all the ingredients on hand and added parsley, pink salt, and twice the balsamic it asked for as well as some green onion and that really seemed to bring that flavour together a bit better.  I used it to top pasta because I didn't have anything else and was hungry for this.  It hit the spot, either way.

This was delicious and was a huge hit. When I make it again I will add a bit less vinegar. We ate it with cinnamon pita chips and this was delicious!

I made this with my closest friend...just for fun because we both love to cook. We squeezed all the jucies by hand, and it was AMAZING! We found that apple cinnamon chips (flat earth brand) tasted the best and we perffered it unchilled, left it a little more tangy. So if you want to pucker and smile at the same time, this is what you want! Perfect summer recipe!
