This is a great summer classic.  For the veggies, I use 1 tomato, 1 cucumber, 1 bell pepper and 1 red onion.

Awesome.  Perfect simple pasta salad, just what I was looking for.  Added all the mentioned vegetables, a little less than 8oz. of italian dressing, but it is the mccormick's seasoning that's the ticket!

We took this to a BBQ this weekend and everyone raved about it.  Even the next day, my parents were still talking about this salad.  The secret is the seasoning...it adds the perfect kick.  We used red and green bell peppers, red onions, pepperoni, and fresh balls of mozzarella.  It was fabulous!

Wonderful.... have been making this recipe for years, and am always asked for the recipe.  I use Good Seasons Italian Dressing (mixed from the packet using red wine vinegar).  I also add 2 diced green peppers, 2 diced tomatoes, and small cubes of mozzarella cheese (the fresh is best).   oops, I almost forgot... I use the whole bottle of salad supreme.  Substitute any shape pasta you like.  This salad brings a little bit of summer to the long cold winter.

I like all of the veggies along with the bowtie pasta.  I made the mistake of cutting my veggies too small so they kind of got jumbled instead of a nice blend of flavors.

Tasty!  I used italian dressing, with a bell pepper, grated carrots, tomatoes and scallions.  I also added some crumbled feta cheese.  This would be perfect for a potluck, everyone would like it and it's enough to serve a crowd.

This recipe was some kind of AWWWEEEsome.  I used two small tomatoes, 4 shredded carrots, 1 small diced bell pepper, a handful of frozen peas, and 1/2 of a small onion (minced).  IT WAS PERFECT. Ooops, I almost forgot I used KEN'S ranch style dressing and a couple scoops of Miracle Whip.  Good Luck..Happy Dining

Great!!! I used Greek with Feta and Oregano salad dressing instead, and I also mixed in about 1/4 cup of mayo. Used cucumber, celery, red green and yellow peppers, LOTS of garlic, and some feta cheese.

I love this recipe.  It's so adaptable to whatever we have on hand. If there is any leftover the next day I put a can of tuna fish in it for my lunch.

Basic but a good starting point for adding your own flavors. I didn't use the salad seasoning mix and instead used my own blend of favorite spices.

This was good, but not my favorite. It didn't have the taste I was looking for. I have not made many pasta salads in my time so I'll have to keep on experimenting.

Disappointing.  I really like the seasoning on toasted bread with butter, but it was too bland in this pasta salad.

I always get complimented on this pasta salad
the salad supreme is the key here! I use fat free italian and cubed jalepeno cheese along with various chopped veggies- also good with cheese tortellini!

This was pretty good.  I had to use another salad seasoning.  I could not locate the one needed. I added chunks of mozarrella cheese.  I added red and yellow bell peppers, cut up cherry tomatos, carrots, and cucumbers.  I also used colored spiral pasta which made a very colorful and presentable dish.

I've been searching for a great pasta salad and, although good, it's not great.  I used Newman's Italian dressing with the Salad Seasoning and was disappointed in the reddish color it created.  To be fair, my family liked it better than any other I've made so far, but we all still love my MIL's the best.
NOTE:  I did find out that she used Good Seasonings Zesty Italian dressing packet in hers.  A nice spicy Italian with a nice crisp, clear taste in every bite.

This was a huge hit!  I used grape tomatoes, cucumbers and red onion as my veggies and used tri-color fussili for the pasta.  Definitely a keeper as I got tons of compliments! :)
