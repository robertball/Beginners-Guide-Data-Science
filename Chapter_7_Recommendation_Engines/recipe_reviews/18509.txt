I've made this recipe several times since my initial review two years ago.  As I was printing off the recipe for this Christmas prep, I read some of the more recent comments, and decided to add what I've learned in the past couple years: there's a big difference between doing it the day before vs the same day.  When made the day before, it's stiffer and the sour cream and garlic (if you add that, as I do) are twice as strong.  Much too strong, in my opinion.  And you will need to re-mash with milk and butter to fluff it up, which means you lose half the benefit of doing it ahead of time.

I HIGHLY recommend doing it only a few hours before (3 or 4 has been just right, for me) and then putting it in a slow cooker on low until dinner.  The flavor is prefect and it's still fluffy.

I use a recipe almost identical to this, but I put the potatoes in a crockpot sprayed with Pam and put it in the fridge overnight. The next day, you need to plug it in well ahead of time, but the oven is open for whatever else needs baking.

This recipe was a huge hit at my potluck party! Everyone complimented on the dish, moreso than the entree (that person wasn't too thrilled that I one up-ed him). I used suggestions from others' reviews. Here's my variation on the recipe: I used yukon gold potatoes, onion & chives cream cheese, and garlic salt instead on onion salt. Followed recipe as stated, but prior to baking I used 1/2 cup of whipping cream and butter to moisten the potatoes. Mixed in some bacon bits and cheddard cheese. Topped off with bacon bits and cheddar cheese before baking. The end result...my dish was completely empty and still had people begging for more.

These turned out great!  The only thing I changed was to put them in the crock pot for about 2.5 hours before company came over so I could save space in my oven!

This has been my 'signature' recipe for our mashed potatoes since Thanksgiving 2002!!  I always get raves about them.  My husband won't let me make our mashed potatoes any other way, because he says, 'nothing compares'!  The 'signature' really boils down to the cream cheese, because many mashed potato recipes are made with the other ingredients, but the cream cheese really sets these apart from all others!  However, I do make it slightly different from what the recipe calls for.  I also add a little skim milk to it, as well as use fat-free cream cheese and sour cream, and interchange using onion powder one time and garlic powder the next, just for variety.  And, of course, the measurements of the ingredients are never the same each time, so I put a little in of everything until it's just right, smooth and creamy.  I've never made these potatoes the 'day before', but serve right away.  However, I always make enough for leftovers and they're delicious cold or hot the next day!  Give these a try, you won't be disappointed!  :)  Thank you so much, Erin, for the wonderful recipe!

I know this recipe as twice baked potatoes...and it is WONDERFUL!!!  I have made these potatoes for years and my family always demands it at all occasions.  I do a few things different though.  Instead of baking next day...I put the potatoes into a crock pot and slice a 1/4 stick butter onto the top and refrigerate until Thanksgiving morning...cover and cook on high till heated threw.  Saves on oven space.  I also mix in (to taste) fresh green onions...adds color to the dish and a wonderful taste!

After reviewing most of the comments, I made a couple of changes: Instead of plain cream cheese, I used cream cheese with chives & onion. I also added roasted garlic. These mashed potatoes are wonderful! Creamy & rich, just like at restaurants!

Delicious and creamy. I even used light sour cream and light cream cheese. Also used Yukon Gold potatoes because I think they are better for mashing (not so dry). Such a great way to make mashed potatoes.

I've been making these potatoes for a few years now and they are fantastic! I pat butter all over the top before I refrigerate. Also, prior to baking, I poke holes in the top with a fork and pour a bit of milk over them. I wait until the milk has absorbed before baking. Sometimes I add cheese too. How can you go wrong with cheese? lol

This is awesome! It is similar to other potato recipes I have found on this site BUT STILL EXCELLENT! To make it "different," I used cream cheese with chives. Yum good, easy and can't wait to make for the upcoming holidays.

Excellent...and you don't need to make the day before!  Those of you who said your potatoes weren't creamy probably used big bakers.  I agree that the recipe should specify what kind of potato or the approximate poundage.  I used  9  red potatoes (about 2 lbs.)and the recipe came out very creamy.  Red potatoes have a wonderful texture and mash very easily. They're also about half the size of an  Idaho.  Don't  bother peeling the potatoes--it's unnecessary labor, and the skins provide color and nutrients.   I  increased the amount of salt and pepper a bit, and only used 3 oz. of cream cheese.  Otherwise,  excellent.  My very southern husband loved them.

Delicious!  Freezes well, too.  I froze half the batch before baking, thawed the night before, and baked about one hour.  It was just as delicious as the batch we baked right away.

I made this for work in the crock pot instead of the oven. I warmed it on low for two hours making sure to add enough liquid (a little milk, half-and-half, butter, etc.) to keep the mix creamy, stirring after the first hour. It was a hit! I never saw ten pounds of potatoes move so fast! (I tripled the recipe.) I also added garlic while mashing and garnished with chives.

I like the idea of using cream cheese and sour cream in mashed potatoes.  They give the potatoes great flavor.  However, I had to add a WHOLE LOT of butter and salt.  Also, after refrigerating them overnight, I had to add milk/cream to make them moist again, because were very dry.  I would make them again, but I would probably not make them the night before.

I had to review this twice, because I made it a second time with some variation and it came out even better!  I followed the basic recipe, only I added a cup or so of half and half (I eyeballed it until the potatoes were very creamy and moist) Poured the potatoes in a 9x13, spirnkled sharp cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon and fresh chives on the top. Rerigerated over night and baked as directed. It was a big baked potato heaven.  Thanks for the great idea!!!!

These are a great timesaver.   They tasted good, however a little dry in my opinion . . . in spite of my addition of about 1/2 cup of milk.  I used Idaho potatoes.  Will try again with red or yukon gold tators.  I might try less sour cream and more butter as well.

This recipe has incredible possibilities. It is lacking only MILK. I added enough to make the potatoes very light and fluffy, while beating in my KitchenAid. Out of personal preference I now use about double the sour cream, more or less, and NO CREAM CHEESE (I did not like the twice-baked potato taste it gave. I want a mashed-potato taste). Used half white pepper, half black. More butter. Finally, remove from refrigerator at least an hour before baking. Bake 40 min covered, and 20 minutes uncovered. A light sprinkling of white cheddar or Parmesan (or Trader Joe's shredded Quattro Formaggio- YUM!), a bit of melted butter, and paprika ended in a restaurant-quality dish! 2/15/12

OMG, these were the best ever!! 
Followed advice of some others and boiled garlic cloves with potatos. Cut the cream cheese in half.  Also cut the sour cream down by 1/3. After putting in casserole dish, poked with fork everywhere and drizzled 1/2 and 1/2 over the top, sprinkled with cheddar, fresh grated parmesan and green onions and it was sooo GOOD!! 
My dad commented on the "beatiful dish" when it came out of the oven on Thanksgiving. I had too much for the casserole, and even the "plain" potatoes were yummy. 
Thanks so much!

I have gotten requests to make this for holiday dinners and cookouts. Use the Yukon Golds, they blend up very creamy!  Add a couple tsp. garlic powder or some chopped garlic too! After experimenting, I now always use neufchatel (low-fat) cream cheese and reduced-fat sour cream. You honestly can't tell a difference. You may want to sprinkle a little cheddar and/or green onion on immediately before serving. My dad absolutely loves it; and he doesn't think I can cook at all! :-)

Too salty for me. I ended up having to mash a few extra potatoes to cut the salt. Otherwise I loved them.

It is awesome! I made it for Christmas dinner. It is reach , delicious and  good looking. My all family love it. I am expecting my father from Europe who is a big potato fan; and I am going to make this potato dish. 
I try to watch my weigh. So, instead of regular sour cream,  cream cheese and butter I added fat free sour cream,  reduced fat cream cheese and light margarine. It was very, very tasty! This recipe is big time keeper for my family! Thank you,  Erin!

Fantastic! Really good. Also made equal servings of mashed potatoes from a box and mixed the two - really big crowd. Still turned out incredibly.

YUMMY! I tasted these before putting it in the refrigerator for tomorrow and OH MY GOD... mouthwateringly delicious. I can't wait to try them tomorrow after reheating. I will definitely be making these again.

Update: I added shredded mozzarella cheese to the top of half of the potatoes... and it absolutely made this recipe. I loved how creamy and cheesy it was. If you make this recipe... definitely try it with the cheese... you won't regret it!

These potatoes were great. I doubled the recipe (2) 5 lb bags and followed it exactly. I didn't have a potatoe ricer so I used my hand mixer. I boiled the potatoes (cubed) in a huge pot, until they were soft. I drained them, put them back in the pot and slowly added the rest of the ingredients. I whipped everything together and then put the pot in the refrigerator. The next day I transferred them to a 13x9 pan, stuck a few pats of butter in the potatoes and heated it for about 1/2 hour. The top will get a light golden brown if you do not cover it. They were so fluffy and moist. The flavor was great.

We have been using this recipe for years for our harvest dinners.  Can be made ahead of time.  After mashing we place it in a crockpot lightly buttered.  I put a little dollop of butter on top and let it heat up on low in the am for use later.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner, and they were really great. I made them same-day as others had suggested, and let them heat in the crockpot on 'warm' until dinner. I think that is the way to go,as they were already drying out by the time we packed up the leftovers, but still great reheated the next day. I did make a few changes. I added extra cream cheese, 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup of water from the pot they were boiled in (I read about that in another recipe)during the mashing process. I mashed them in the crockpot, thinking I was saving myself time (I ended up making a big mess, I wouldn't do it that way again). I also added butter on top while they warmed, and stirred it all in at the last minute before serving. I also skipped the onion powder because one reviewer stated that they tasted like sour cream and onion chips, and that didn't seem appropriate for thanksgiving dinner. I will definitely make these again, next time I will make the recipe as is, just not for a big dinner until I know what it tastes like. I will also continue to tweak them for my family's taste, but all in all, a really good recipe and I'm glad that I tried it for my first attempt at Thanksgiving mashed potatoes!

Wow!  What a great recipe.  Saves so much time on a busy cooking day and they are truly delicous.  Our huge family ate every bit and wanted more.  Will ALWAYS make this now instead of regular mashed potatos.

This recipe is EXCELLENT, absolutely THE BEST.  Family and friends beg me to make these potatoes all the time. They are delicious served the day of and even better the day after. I have found that if the taste of sour cream is to overpowering, use plain yogurt. To make them creamy and fluffy use an electric hand mixer after mashing with masher. Don't over mix or they'll get pasty and sticky. To cut the fat use nonfat plain yogurt, fat free cream cheese, lite salt and lowfat butter spread or margarine.Whoever doesn't love this recipe is either crazy or doing something wrong.

This recipe was excellent, and convenient! Only change I made was I boiled 4 cloves of garlic with the potatoes and mashed them in with them. And then I added some paprika and butter to the top before baking for presentation.

I cut the number of potatoes in half (I used pretty big potatoes), but left the cream cheese, sour cream, and butter at the regular amount.  It still fed 6 adults and two children.  I refrigerated it in the glass baking dish so that I could pop the whole thing in the oven.  Also, dot the top with butter to help it stay moist.  It was THE HIT of our Christmas celebration.

Very good. Of course I've added some things to it since I can never leave a recipe alone. I boil garlic cloves with the potatoes and then they are soft enough to get mashed up with the potatoes.  I also usually end up adding a little more butter than the recipe calls for. Not a really calorie friendly recipe but then I only use this one for holidays or special occasions.

We love these. So easy to make several hours ahead,  spray the slow cooker with some non-stick spray and keep warm. I put a paper towel in the crock pot lid to keep the moisture from dripping on my potatoes. Hubby says not to bother doing potatoes any other way!

Yummy! I usually whip potatoes with the hand mixer, but my husband doesn't care for whipped spuds. This year, I wanted to do 'mashed' potatoes for Thanksgiving, and being able to do them the night before made life so much easier. I used 10 red potatoes, and I didn't have onion powder (thought I did, and went to get it after cooking the potatoes... Oops!), so I used garlic powder. The next day, I buttered an 8x8 inch casserole dish, spread in the potatoes, and I followed the advice of the previous reviewer who poked holes in the top (I just poked away madly with a fork) and poured a little milk over, plus I added dabs of butter all over the top (maybe a ½ tablespoon of butter). Baked it for 30 minutes, and these were some great spuds! Next time, I'll try adding some cheddar!Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I made these for Christmas and they were very well-received.  I doubled the recipe and heated them in the crockpot the next day.  I added a little butter and half and half right before serving to thin them a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe!  My guests said they tasted like sour cream and onion potato chips.  Yum!

This recipe is fabulous for Christmas dinner!  All 21 of us loved it!  I tripled the recipe, placing 2/3 in a large crockpot in the fridge 3 days ahead.  I heated it on low, stirring occasionally, for 6 hours.  The other 1/3 went in a glass 9X13 in the freezer. My family wanted to eat it less than a week later!  I heated it a few minutes in the microwave...yum!  I used golden potatoes, left the skins on, this is the best mashed potato recipe we've had!

This was the 3rd year in a row that I've made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  It's the only way to make Thanksgiving potatoes for a crowd. I re-heat in my crockpot.  Just be sure to allow for plenty of time to reheat (2.5 hours).

I love these mashed potatoes! My kids are always asking me to make them! They remind me of the flavor of twiced baked potatoes,sweet, but not too sweet. And so nice that you can make them in advance! To save time I always leave the skins on the potatoes rather than peeling them, it adds to the flavor and nutrition! I also throw it all in a bowl and mix it with the blender instead of mashing by hand.  Great Recipie!!

This recipe was very good and it was nice to be able to make it ahead of time.  I needed to leave the potato mixture in the oven for a longer time, however.

I use a version similar to this that I've used for 15 years, originally from my step-mother's Junior League cookbook.  I make it well in advance (several days) and freeze it.  Then put in the fridge overnight on Wed.  Cook as directed on Thursday morning.  Yukon Gold potatoes are the best, but Russets work too.  I add a pinch of Baking Soda to make them fluff up nicely.  And, I use the entire 8oz package of low-fat cream cheese.  Sprinkle a little seasoned salt on the top.  Super easy.  Always a hit!

Delicious!  I made this the day of and substituted half of the sour cream for whole milk, used 1 tsp garlic powder along w/ the teaspoon of onion powder and boiled the potatoes in beef boullion.  Usually I have to add extra spices because it's too bland but this way was PERFECT!

I modified this a little bit and it has been my favorite Mashed Potatoes recipes for about 2 years now.
MODIFICATIONS: I usually use golden/yellow potatoes - way more smooth and tasty.    I soften the cream cheese & butter in the microwave and mix them with the seasonings in a small bowl, with a few drops of garlic juice and dashes of basil added in.  After mashing the potatoes, I mix in the cream mixture.  I serve right away or the next day - works great either way.
Thank you for a great recipe!

I have used this recipe for years and have always gotten raves!  Today I switched to red potatoes, left the skins on and also added baked garlic "recipe on this site".  I actually used 1 1/2 heads and it is fantastic and mixed in with hand mixer.  We love garlic and I liked this recipe better than the ones called garlic mashed potatoes. Think I will mix the left over garlic with butter to top off grilled steaks. Yum!!!!

For taste alone, these would get a five.  I made them the night before thanksgiving and tasted them and they were sinfully good.  So rich and flavorful.  I felt guilty with each bite, but who cares over the holidays.  However, the overnight thing didn't work. I took a few other reviewers suggestions and heated them in the crockpot, but had to add additional butter and milk quite often to keep them from drying out.  They turned out fine, but all the extra work and calories didn't seem worth it.  I think I'd rather make these the day of and cut time elsewhere.

I followed SHARZ96's review and made this in the slow cooker in the morning.  Perfect potatoes according to everyone at the table.  Great way to free up oven space when cooking for a crowd too.

The onion powder was too strong so I would it omit next time. I also like potatoes with lots of moisture so I only baked them for thirty minutes resulting in perfectly moist, creamy, mashed potatoes.

Absolutely great idea. And simple as potatoes. Few tips. Sour cream and cream cheese can be fat free or Lite or with chive and/or onion flavor.
Skim milk poured over top will absorb into mash. I do this before I refrigerate and also before baking to loosen it up. And I also put some cheese on top before baking, then after baking I stir. While cooking I season to taste. Maybe a little more onion powder. Sometimes I add a LITTLE garlic salt for a LITTLE kick. Feel free to contact me. I make this at least once a month.

I really liked these, but my family preferred that I make my usual mashed potatoes so I can't give this 5 stars.

I've been making these for many years now - not only a timesaver; but they taste better than "regular" just-off-the-stove potatoes.

This is the best recipe ever! We do catering with our B&B, and I always dreaded making the mashed potatoes and keeping them hot. This recipe does a great job. Make them ahead of time and put them in the over to finish...wonderfully hot and smooth! I'm making them for our own family Thanksgiving dinner for 15 people...YUM!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year. I did a trial run the week before Thanksgiving to see how they would turn out. I had read some reviews saying to add milk before baking.  I didn't add any milk for the first batch, and the potatoes were a little dry after baking. So the second time I made them, I added some milk before baking, and the potatoes were perfect after baking. Great recipe.

I have done these for years, put in large 9 x 13 dish & put in fridge day or two before. I use 5 lbs potatoes, add garlic powder and little garlic pieces pushed into the mashed potatoes along with 8 oz cream cheese & 1 cup sour cream.Never any leftovers & they stay hot.

Positively divine! Followed the recipe exactly. The BIG problem was that I couldn't stop eating them! These will be terrific for Thanksgiving, one less dish to make that day. Thanks for the recipe!

These got raves at an extended family dinner, and really made things easy -- no last minute "mash 'em and get the potatoes to the table before they get cold."  I did use a little less sour cream, and half the onion powder, as some reviewers said the taste was overpowering.  After refrigerating, I did whip with some 2% milk to make them light and fluffy before baking.  Yummy!

Easy - especially when you need a big batch for a crowd!  Gets all the mess & trouble out of the way in advance - I have made up to 2 days early and it holds up great.  Reheats in micro well, too!

I think I would enjoy this recipe more without the onion powder.  It made the potatoes taste like a packaged instant mix.  I would make this again without  the onion powder.

I gambled and made this the night before Thanksgiving.  The night before they were moist, and smelled great.  All right, I did steal a little taste and they were wonderful!  However, after sitting overnight and cooking in the oven on Thanksgiving Day they became totally dried out and stiff.  An embarrassment.  It would not have been a time saver to "tweak" these taters at the last minute, either.  It would have just been safer to peel the potatoes ahead of time and make them at the last minute as usual.  And a lot less fattening, too, to do it the old-fashioned way, I might add.

These are good.  I made everything the same night so you do not have to make part of the dish the day before if you don't have the time.  Trust your instincts as all potatoes are not the same size - add milk and/or more butter if they seem dry.

This recipe is just fabulous! It has a great texture. I added about 1/2 cup milk to thin it slightly. I made it in the morning & refrigerated it until dinner time.I baked it for about an hour then dotted it with butter & sprinkled lightly with paprika. Our guests, who are very picky, loved it!!!!

BIG HIT!  Great way to save time on the day of an event.  I made these for Superbowl Sunday.  Prepared them with garlic cloves boiled along with the potatoes.  Also, I used the crock pot idea, worked GREAT!!  I had to double this recipe with huge potatoes, I did not measure the sour cream and cream cheese precisely, but added as much as I felt I needed to make it the consistency I liked.  I did end up adding about a stick of butter and some half and half to make them creamier. Got many, many compliments, will definitely make again!!

These were a little dry, my family didn't like them as much as regular ones.  Probably won't make again, or if I do I'll add more moisture.  I did like the convenience of making them the day before though.

Made for Thanksgiving with much success and ease. I did add a little bit of half-n-half before turning on the crock pot.  I did not add onion powder because I don't think they needed more than salt n pepper when serving topped with gravy. I believe the cream cheese is the key ingredient that keeps them from drying out.

Awesome Potatoes!  I always make these for Thanksgiving and Christmas and get rave reviews.  I do not always bake them as stated in recipe but when I do stick them in the oven it is usually just to keep them warm while other things cook.

These potatoes were SO good!  I made them the night before and then warmed them slowly in a crock pot until serving time Thanksgiving Day.  No one would guess they were made ahead and they were SO rich and delicious I was wishing I'd made a double batch!

I've been making my mashed potatoes this way for years!  They are divine!  The only difference is that I do add some milk (to get to the preferred consistency), and instead of the onion powder, I add 1-2 teaspoons of Lawry's seasoning salt.  I get rave reviews each time!

This is similiar what I make & its always a hit. I only use red potatoes, they have the best flavor. I use 8oz of cream cheese, leave out the added salt, since the cream cheese & sourcream already have salt in them. I add about 1/2 to 1 tsp garlic powder & about 2 TB of chives...add some butter on top & bake, we always have this for all the holidays...

These were wonderful! My mom needed these for a function to feed about 20 people (of course we made more than the recipe calls for) and they got great reviews. She also used the crock pot to reheat these and we needed no extra milk or cream after reheating. They're really stiff when cold, but soften nicely reheated. Added chives and about 6 oz. chive cream cheese along w/ 8 oz plaing cc. Used 10 lbs. red potatoes too. Thanks for the great day before recipe!!

I made these Mashed Potatoes for my Thanksgiving dinner.   Rather then cooking these the day before and reheating I decided to make them early in the day and hold them in my crock pot on low to hold until we were ready to eat.  (advice i read from another review)  THEY were AWESOME!!!  Everyone loved them.  I will defently make these again.

I like to roast 3-4 cloves of garlic in the oven. Drizzle with  olive oil and roast at 350 for about 30 minutes. Then I mix them into the potatoes with other stuff. Very yummy. This recipe is a lifesaver for the make-it-aheaders and those with limited space. Both of which are very important to me. So, thanks!

I've made these for the past 5 Christmas dinners.  I put the mixture the night before into the slow-cooker pot.  Cooking the mashers in the slow cooker keeps them moist and doesn't dry them like the oven.

Awesome, was asked numerous times for the recipe by guests at my first holiday dinner. I placed the mixture in a large crockpot for overnight storage. Added chopped green onions. Used more onion powder, sour cream and cream cheese then was called for, but it worked. 1-1/2 bags of yellow potatos. Perfect!

I used 6 lbs of potatoes for 10 servings.  Before baking, I poked holes with a fork and poured about 1/3 cup milk on the top and a few pats of butter as was suggested.  These were fantastic!

What a great recipe. I made these mashed potatoes the night before Thanksgiving. I stored them in my crockpot inside of my refrigerator overnight. In the morning, when I put in my turkey, I put on the crockpot od potatoes. They warmed through the morning and were moist and ready to eat in perfect time with the turkey. What an easy way to prepare ahead of time and they tasted as if they were made that morning. In fact, most of the potatoes were gone before our Thanksgiving meal from guest sampling the potatoes all morning as they were warming. They all loved the taste. I followed the recipe as stated and added a little butter to moisten as they warmed throughout the morning. They didn't really need to be moistened however...I just love butter. I WILL make these again and save myself the hassle while preparing a meal.

this recipe was good. i used yukon gold potatoes and made the recipe the night before thanksgiving. it DID save a lot of time and cooking space the day of which was nice. on thanksgiving, i pulled them out and used my hand mixer to whip them up again (next time i would warm them up a bit in the microwave before mixing) while adding a TON of butter (1/2 cup) and lots of milk to get them more creamy. the overall taste was very yummy. all things considered, i am definetely glad that i made them the night before, so thanks for the recipe.

DELICIOUS. Made these the night before a big dinner as I had too many appetizers to bake.  I found they did dry out a little, but I placed some waxed paper right on top of the mix, than covered bowl with saran wrap.  I think this helped keep the mix more moist--in fear of dry potatoes, I over compensated and added far too much milk the day after, and turned the potatoes into a 'puree'--delicious none the less...will make them the same day next time

This is the only way to make mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving!  Not only does it save you time on Thanksgiving day, but it tastes great as well.  Even better, I keep mine in a crockpot and reheat on low after adding butter and milk.  Now my oven is free for the turkey and stuffing!

GREAT!! I made these mashed potatoes about 4 hrs before I needed them and they were great.  At the last minute I decided I wanted garlic mashed potatoes so I added 2 teaspoons of garlic powder and Oh My God this was it....My favorite Garlic Mashed Potatoes.

I always make these for Thanksgiving a day in advance.  I use a potatoe ricer instead of mashing.  Makes for a great creamy texture. There are a little dry the next day, so I add a little milk and or sour cream before reheating.  Excellent taste!!  Always get rave reviews!

I was a bit skeptical at first when I saw how thick and dry the mixture seemed the night before, but out of the oven, these mashers are perfectly light and fluffy!  I sprinkled a bit of shredded cheese over them a few minutes before they were out of the oven on a lark and it only added to the dish!

I have made this recipe for years.  When I received this recipe from a friend the title was 5 day potatoes.  I have made them up to five days ahead with no problems.  One time I even froze them.  The texture was a little different but the taste was just as good.

I make a variation of these and they are SO delicious!!   Instead of plain sour cream I use a cup on the pre-made french onion dip (and eliminate the onion salt).  I also add a bit of milk to make them fluffy.   Never tried them the day before but may do so for thanksgiving this year.

These potatos are very good and a time saver BUT they do not taste like mashed potatos.   If you are making gravy these are not what you want.  They over power good gravy from turkey or beef.  My family missed the taste of the potato.

These were a hit for us.  I had to substitute garlic powder for the onion powder because I it was what I had.  I did take one reviewers suggestion of making it the same day.  I followed the recipe but then put it on the crock pot on low.  They were there for about 4 hours and were great.  I like being about to keep the oven free and have one less thing to do at the time the meal is ready.

I had to add a lot of garlic to these potatoes, but they turned out pretty well. It was fabulous to be able to make them the night before, and in the slow cooker, to free up time and space on Thanksgiving Day (oh yeah, instead of oven baking them I just put the in the slow cooker on high for about 3 or 4 hours). I did have to add some milk because they were tough without it. I have definitely had better mashed potatoes, but for time and space considerations, this recipe was a hit.

AMAZING! Not only did this recipe save me tonnes of time and my group of 14 friends love it, but these were the BEST mashed potatoes I've ever had. Never thought of adding mayo to mashed potatoes....GENIUS! THANX :)

I made it for a Christmas party and they were a huge hit (and no one asked for gravy)! 

I made them again a few days ago, and they still turned out great without sour cream (I didn't have any handy).

These were good. Trying to make things easier on myself and my small kitchen, I made these for Thanksgiving this year. The whole family seemed to enjoy them and I liked them as well. The only thing I would mention is that with the sour cream and the cream cheese in them, they didn't seem to go witht he gravy as well. However, these would still be great with steak, meatloaf, chicken, etc.

I read most of the reviews before making dish and saw that people didn't really do the "day before" part and just did it the morning of, so I did the same thing.  It was different from the traditional mashed potatoes that I'm used to.  However, it was a GOOD different and I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I made these potatoes for my Christmas Eve dinner for the family. The only change I made was to use 8 oz of cream cheese and 6 oz of sour cream because my mother isn't wild about sour cream and I thought it would tone it down a little for her. While I intended to make it early, I was not able to, so they were made the same day. Bottom line is that everyone RAVED about the potatoes. They were wonderful. I did have to add a splash of milk to make them a little less stiff, but that may have been because of my cream cheese/sour cream change up. Thank you for sharing this recipe - it's a keeper!

These were so delicious! The night I made them, I tried them and didn't think they were anything special. So I refrigerated them and the next morning I put them in the crock pot with milk and butter, and by the time we were ready to eat(around 2 or 3 in the afternoon) they were great and had a very delicious taste! The only thing I did different was that I added chive and onion cream cheese and a little garlic powder.

Really wanted to try these before Thanksgiving but never had the chance.  Used nine Yukon gold potatoes and made as directed the morning of Thanksgiving.  Five stars from the whole family!!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Can't believe I haven't rated this wonderful recipe before!  I have made these potatoes every Thanksgiving for the last 3 years.  Everyone loves them!  You can be sure they are on the menu again for this year.  As long as we have not had a hard freeze, I like to add fresh chopped chives.  If there is any left over(doesn't happen often) they made great potato pancakes the next morning.  Thanks, Erin, for a wonderful time saver recipe!

This recipe is a staple at Easter & Thanksgiving! I love that I can make it a day or 2 ahead & just stick in the microwave to reheat & it's just as creamy as when it was first made.

I made these EXACTLY as written and they were delicious!  NO leftovers.

UPDATE: made again for Christmas dinner. Just followed 3 suggestions made by reviewers-used Yukon Gold potatoes, used onion and chive cream cheese and added just a bit of butter and cream prior to baking.  Turned out even better and first time was 5 star!  Used 13 medium/large potatoes to serve 12 and there were no leftovers.

Great recipe. Exactly how I make my "eat tonight" potatoes. Not sure what makes this a day before recipe but ok. I usually make extra for the next day when I make mashed potatoes. Sour cream and cream cheese has always been my favorite YUM! I wouldn't put as much garlic powder though because the flavor gets stronger overnight. Myself I prefer my mashed potatoes right after making them, but of course having some the next day is great! I love mashed potatoes and hardly ever make instant. Thanks for reminding me, I'm going to sams club and get a big sack of yukon golds and make them tomorrow night.

This will be the third Thanksgiving I've made these potatoes.  They are delicious, easy and stress-free.  No last minute scrambling in the kitchen to mash. I use the crock pot and make them the night before, heat them the next day.  I also do my stuffing in the crock pot (Slow Cooker Stuffing)recipe on this site.  I usually have 20 for Thanksgiving dinner, both recipes are time and oven space savers. Delicious!

These were some of the best mashed potatoes my family has ever had. I used garlic powder instead of onion. Also, only had 1/2 sour cream. These were great even cooked the same day.

This has been my all time favorite recipe for potatoes since they can be made ahead.   Every time I serve them people want the recipe.   I tend to add a lot of garlic, but that is a matter of taste.  Good to see this recipe in print.

I got this recipe several years ago and have been making it ever since, but I forgot to rate it. My whole family demands that I bring these potatoes to every family dinner and holiday, they are soooo good and streamline my holiday baking since they are assembled the day before. Yum.

Easter lunch was way easier since I was able to peel, cut and boil the night before. As others suggested, I added some milk before baking. Very tasty.

Fantastic!  And a great time saver during the holidays!  Anything that can be made ahead of time is a winner in my book.  I use plain nonfat yogurt or fat free sour cream, and lowfat cream cheese to try to make it healthier.

This recipe is the best. But because it is a new extended family favourute guess what I get to bring every time we have a family get together. Also I use a potatoe ricer to make them extra cream with no lumps. I have served them right after I made them but they do get better with age.

YUMMY!!!!! What a hit this was at my family dinner. I was out of onion powder so I use 2 teaspoons of garlic salt. And added chedder cheese and bacon crumbs on top. Looked as good as it tasted. I'm not a potatoe girl but I am now. Look out Atkins....cause here I come.

I made these for Christmas Dinner... Everyone raved over them... but complained because they disappeared so quickly!  I didn't have any onion powder so I used fresh chives...

The texture of these potatoes was good but a little too sour creamy for me.

This dish was a big hit with my son who is a mashed potato fan. He claims to not like sour cream and cream cheese, but he didn't detect them in the potatoes (and I didn't tell him they were there!)I used a stand mixer to whip up the potatoes but added 1/4 cup milk since they were a little dry for mixing. I also substituted garlic powder for the onion powder and topped the potatoes with grated cheddar cheese before baking. Very easy to make - and great to make the day before Thanksgiving!

These were easy and delicious.  The people who said these were bland must be smokers with dead taste buds because there is nothing bland about these.  I threw them in the crock pot to reheat for 2 hours and by dinner time they were so moist and fluffy you would have thought I had just made them.

Different, not bad, not the best. I guess I just am a fan of old fashioned mashed potatoes made with a lot of butter and milk and sometimes cheddar cheese added in.

I make this all the time.  Try adding, chopped cooked bacon, chedder cheese and chives.  Or even simpler use chive and onion cream cheese and skip the onion powder.   YUM  These are a staple for Sunday night dinner.

These potatoes are delicious!  Very creamy and good.  I made them the same day and they were excellent.  My husband loves cheddar cheese and wanted me to put some on top so I did and it was great.  Will definitely be making these again.

Yikes!! Mom said to never test a recipe on the day of the event, and this Thanksgiving I learned why the hard way. The Sour cream was completely overpowering, and I used half of what the recipe recommended. I saw some of the other reviews stating they were disappointed, but did not believe them. However, I did the mash before method and reheated in my crock pot to free up some oven space, and that worked great. Heated on high in large crock for 2.5 hours.

I made these for Thanksgiving.  I wish I hadn't, they are  not a substitute for the good ole fluffy mashed potatoes.  They are flavorful but very heavy.  I hope my guest knew that they were potatoes of a different kind. Thought that it would save me time and avoid the mess right before dinner. live and learn.

Great recipe!  Just wanted to add that I made them and put them in the crock pot.  In the morning I turned them on high and let them heat until our thanksgiving dinner (stirring a few times so they heated evenly).  Was delicious!

Great way to make potatoes!  The only changes I made was adding about 1 clove of minced garlic and then I sprinkled some shredded parmesan on them before baking.  I used lowfat sour cream.  They were very good and I will definitely be making this one again and again.

Pretty good recipe...I thought the onion flavor was a little strong at first but after they set overnight in the fridge, it blended nicely.  I let the mixture set at room temperature for thirty minutes prior to baking them.  I baked for 30 minutes like the recipe states and the potatoes were still cold.  I stirred, kept in for ten more minutes and it wasn't doing the trick.  I wound up having to finish them in the microwave.  I added some additional pats of butter to make the potatoes less clumpy and stirred in some milk prior to serving to make the potatoes creamier.  Definitely a time saver being able to prepare ahead of time...now I know to either plan for a longer baking time or I will just use the microwave.  I may give the slow cooker a try sometime and see how they turn out using that...this recipe is a keeper though, slight modifications could be made to suit anyone's tastes.

Although these potatoes had a good flavor, the texture was pretty unappealing to me. They came out of the fridge looking dry and cooking them only dried them out even more. I'll try again though since it is very convenient to have potatoes mashed and ready to go the day before you need them.

I made this for my Thanksgiving dinner.  I was not happy with the texture.  It was not creamy like I had expected it came out cakey.  It had good flavor but the texture wasn't how I like mashed potatoes.

First made this for Thanksgiving--one less thing to do at the last minute and one less thing to take up a burner on the stove! Now I make these any time I have a big meal planned so I am not mashing potatoes and trying to finish everything else at the same time. I have used low fat sour cream and cream cheese and they work just fine. However, the real stuff makes it a little creamier and tastier. My family loves this recipe and my husband likes the less-frazzled me at dinnertime!

These were fabulous...even though they aren't very good for you!  Use low fat sour cream, cream cheese and you will reduce half the fat.
I think it's better to cook them the same day you serve them...say 4 hours earlier and then refrigerate and re-heat.

I made this for Christmas and it was so good I'm making it to take to a New Years Eve party.  I omitted the onion powder, added milk and bacon bits.  I made extra, thinking I could have left overs with the turkey and ham but alas all the potatoes were gone!! Thanks for sharing these are really good and will become one of the standards with our holiday meals......

tastes great, but I made the recipe for 17 people and it took way longer than 30 minutes to heat up.  I'd heat it up for at least one hour.  The best thing about it was making it the day before!  I also added one tub of roasted garlic cream cheese!  Yum Yum

I was a bit dubious about using this recipe, but I hate making mashed potatoes at the last minute, so I gave it a try.  They were creamy and delicious, and everyone loved them!  I used Yukon Gold potatoes, which worked very well.  Thanks!

Best mashed potatoes I've ever made...and making ahead is a big advantage.   However, I had to cook mine about double the time (1 hour) to get them really cooked through.

These were very rich and tasty, but had some small lumps. I cooked until still slightly firm but enough to break apart easily when forked thinking they would continue to cook some the next day & didn't want mushy or gluey potatoes. I refrigerated in a glass container overnight then transferred to a non-stick sprayed crockpot to heat for about 2.5 hours on low (then put on 'warm' while serving) to save room in the oven. Worked great & had lots of compliments!

I have made this recipe so many times.  My sons and I absolutely love them.  The only change I make is to not add the onion powder.  So easy to make them the day before our Sunday family dinner or Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I actually heat them up in the microwave.  My oldest son called me for the recipe and I told him to go to Allrecipes.com type in the name and just omit the onion.  I think he has now become hooked on All recipes.  LOVE THESE POTATOES!!!!

a have been making these for many many years.  I use 1 t. garlic salt is the only seasoning.  Along with the cream cheese and sour cream, I don't think they need the butter.  I've experimented through the years with crumbled bacon, chopped green onions and cheddar or mozzarella cheese.  I just like it without any of those.  The problem with this dish is it's not good with gravy.  A holiday meal like Thanksgiving,  just seems like you should have mashed potatoes and gravy with the turkey.  But these are awesome with ham, etc.

LOVED this recipe!  It was a hit at Thanksgiving.  As other reviewers mentioned, it was reminiscent of a twice-baked potato.  The flavor was excellent!   I used yukon gold potatoes, cream cheese with chives and low-fat sour cream.  Added pats of butter and some milk to crock pot and set it to low a couple of hours before dinner.  This one is a keeper!

This is a great crockpot recipe. I made it in the morning. Let it cool a little, transported it to the home we were eating at and cooked them on low for about 2 hours.

This recipe made my Christmas so much easier.  Being able to make anything ahead feels so good when the time comes to get your meal together.  These turned out great and I will probably use this as my standard mashed potato recipe.

Added 1 tsp of garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe!  Didn't have time to bake it the next day, so I heated it in the microwave.  Tasted just as good!

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe. It was delicious. I made on thanksgiving and my family loved it. As another member suggested I used the cream cream with chives. I also used a package of garlic & herb lipton soup mix. Wonderful flavor

These were the hands-down favorite at my thanksgiving dinner.  Someone else mentioned they tasted like sour cream and onion chips, and I agree they do... But they are scrumptious!  I tossed them in the crock pot the night before and heated them up a couple hours before dinner... Turned out super creamy.  They are on the menu again this week!

I took reviewer's suggestion and made these the morning of Thanksgiving and put them in a crockpot on low until mealtime.  They came out PERFECT - creamy, yummy, good! I used whipped cream cheese because that's all I had, and glad I did since it made mixing into the taters even easier. Only other changes: I added a splash of half & half and garlic powder.

I liked these mashed potatoes very much- will definately make again.  I think the sour cream and cream cheese makes this side absolutely perfect- though I did use just a dash of garlic powder instead of the onion powder due to having a picky eater in the house.  I bet these would be great with some fresh chives also.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used onion and chive cream cheese (instead of plain).  I also added a little shredded cheese and bacon bits.  They were a hit!  I have been asked to bring these to Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.

Very good! A like the idea of no-gravy required type of mashed potatoes. I used red potatoes (always have) and thought it wasn't a great choice and a little on the thick side but it was still yummy! Also made a peaked designed with a fork on top of the potato casserole for a cuter presentation.  My daughter would love the addition of bacon and cheddar cheese next time.

Made for work Christmas party.  Whenever I make mashed potatoes ahead of time, I always add more milk because they do tend to be thick when it's time to serve.  I prepared these in the crockpot.  Just make sure to stir occasionally.

Unbelievably yummy! Made EXACTLY as written except made the same day & I used just a dash of the onion powder (youngest daugh hates onions) & I'm happy I did. There was just a hint of onion flavor, enough as not to overpower all that other yummy goodness. Oh, I did use Yukon Golds. Definitely making these again!

So, so, so good I added 8oz of cream cheese and only a splash of the onion powder, more butter and it was nice fluffy white and my family loved it. The onion powder was a wonderful addition. Very surprise at how much we loved it. Made it the same day... Thanksgiving!

The cream cheese and sour cream was too overpowering for me.  It made them taste almost sour.  This was not a big hit at our thanksgiving table.  They were easy to make though and offer a different alternative to typical mashed potatoes.

I have been making these potatoes since first finding the recipe here about 5 years ago, just now getting aorund to rating it. These are our go to mashed potatoes for every holiday, potluck, and get together. There are never any left and I've given out the recipe many times. I make them just as suggested other than adjusting the cream cheese, sour cream and seasonings as the potato size and type make a difference every time. Sometimes I add roasted garlic, but they are wonderful as is. Thanks for the great recipe, these are so good we hate to put gravy on them!

These were almost perfect. I have made them many times though, and my daughters (19 & 23) always complain about them. I really think it's the onion powder. I will make them again Thanksgiving (day before) but at least half the amount of onion powder. Otherwise these are fantastic!

I have used this recipe several times now and it is always a hit.  I like to use this when do large dinners (over 100).  It helps to make the day before so I can spend time doing other things the day of.  Thanks for the great tasting time saver.

I tried this recipe out on my family (husband being the biggest critic) because in a few days me and 3 other ladies have to make mashed potatoes for 225 people. (Really can't see doing instant) It was a big hit with my family. It is going to save us so much time on the day of our event having the potatoes done already.

I tried this recipe for the first time at Christmas after my daughter told me about it.  Having a large crowd for Christmas day, I wanted to do whatever I could to prepare as much as possible the day before so I could relax with my company instead of spending the whole day in the kitchen.  The Day Before Mashed Potatoes were so easy to prepare and were a huge hit with everyone at dinner. Even the little ones loved them. Instead of warming them in the oven, I warmed them in the crockpot.  They are delicious and make life so much easier when cooking for a crowd.

We thought these were very tasty!  I made these the day before and stored them in foil.  When we were getting last minute items together for the big dinner, I popped them into the oven to heat.  What a nice time-saver for a hectic Thanksgiving dinner.  I'll probably always use this for this particular meal!

Theses were not that great.. the cream cheese and sour cream seemed to overwhelm the flavor to me.  My mashed potatoes are much better so I probably won't make these again.

With a full time job, mashed potatoes from scratch were reserved for the weekends.  With the find of this recipe, I can stop buying the instant.  I subbed some of the onion powder for garlic to spice things up a little, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This was great!  Made the day b4 for Thanksgiving & was crowd pleaser. Put potatoes through ricer. For cream cheese used onion & chives flavor. Used only half of onion powder called for and used garlic powder for remaining amount. Put in crockpot and added a pat of butter when I turned it on low for 3 hours. Turned crockpot on high while I got turkey ready. Potatoes were excellent & plan on using recipe again.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they ended up being cold at serving time.  The recipe calls for 9 potatoes but that needs to be a bit more specific.  I used large potatoes and the baking time in the oven must not have been long time to get them warm all the way through.  I did try the chive/onion cream cheese and it made them taste good though.  I also added about 1 cup of heavy cream before baking to help with moisture.  I highly recommend that.  If I hadn't of added cream or milk they would have been too dry.

I thought they were good.  Not sure if I did something wrong but I made mine the day before and they tasted like I made them the day before.  I like the idea of them being ready so I can just throw it all in. 12/26/2010 update: Following other suggestions, I find this to be great if made same day and kept on warm in a crock pot for 3-4 hours. I periodically would add mild and stir. Was perfect for my labor intensive meal...one thing I didn't have to worry about.

Whoa. Now seriously I am a mashed potato snob and can only eat my Mom's potatoes. She recently moved and I had a craving and found this recipe. SO GOOD! I made them only a few hours before I served them and I also cut the recipe in half (used four potatoes). The cream cheese gives it such great tang. If I make these again I might add a little liquid and skip the baking because they were stiff. Thank you so much for the recipe, almost as good as Mom's!
EDIT: I now make these regularly with onion and chive cream cheese, and I leave out the sour cream and add milk or cream. EVEN BETTER!

I have made this recipe NUMBEROUS times but never reviewed it.  The first time I made it was my first T-giving after getting married...have 21 people over.  The potatoes were a HUGE hit.  Now, I have to make and bring them to Easter and Christmas at other family's house. I will be peeling potatoes for the rest of my life :)  It really is great!  I do add milk when I am mashing for extra moisture.

I made this as part of my Valentine's Day Meal this year knowing I wouldn't have time to put anything together that night.  The only complaint is that the finished product was very dense...not like mashed potatos made "day of" at all.  However, the flavor was heavenly...nearly decadent! MMMM!

These are the best potatoes.  They are not a light fluffy type but a heavier mashed potatoe great with gravy.
I usually make a double or triple batch & freeze in gallon size ziplock bags.  They thaw out great & are not loose or watered down when reheated.

This is a wonderful & delicious recipe! But 9 potatoes-come on-how much difference can there be in potato size! I assumed that 9 potatoes equaled 5 lbs of potatoes & that worked out fine. I made 10 lbs of potatoes for Thanksgiving 07 & put it in my crockpot to warm up on Turkey Day. Previous reviews said 2 1/2 hrs (I assumed at low) but it took much longer than this. I had made the potatoes the night before & refrigerated overnight. So if you do them the day before please allow 3 hrs on high to get them warmed up again.

5 stars for convenience, this is a stress saver for big holiday's. just make it the day before and pop it in when you are cutting the meat and setting the table. these couldn't have been any easier. there is nothing worse then breaking out the hand mixer when everyone is gathering in the kitchen to "talk".

This was very good...we added italian herb seasoning, oregano, and then used garlic powder instead of onion powder. We also added cheese to it when baking.

As noted by others, great flavor but much too dry.  I added milk in the recipe and have added more milk every time I've heated it up.

I used 5 lbs yukon gold, 1/4 cup each shredded swiss & monterey jack cheese, green onions and crumbled bacon! put butter pats down into the mixture and stored in butter coated crock pot for 3 days prior. On Low, they were ready in about 2 hours, so I had to lower to Warm. Stired a few times for a few more hours, and added some milk to the mixture to keep it from drying out. This is an awesome recipe and I will make many more times! Guests loved it, but for 8 people, I should have made more (like a 5# bag plus half of another bag). Sprinkled crumbled bacon and more green onion on top before serving. They went fast! THANKS!

I wanted to use this recipe but it does not specify what kind of potatoe or what size or how many pounds to purchase,nine russet to serve eight is too many is it eight Yucon?  Poundage would solve the problem.

I had to add ALOT of milk to even get these to the point where I could really mix them, but the finished product was a hit at the Thanksgiving dinner I brought them too. Added a little fresh grated parmesan on top for the day after baking. Yum.

Small tip I received from a friend - if you are making a big batch, use the meat grinder attachment on your kitchenaid mixer to make these potatoes. They turn out nicely and not a lump in sight! Wonderful recipe, thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe and it was a big hit at our Thanksgiving Dinner with over 20 people. I loved the fact that I didn't have to peel or mash potatoes on the day of our big meal. 

A word of caution though... Make sure you PLAN when and how much you need your oven. It can be tricky with only one oven in the house!

I made one change to the recipe. I added half and half in place of some of the sour cream and some of the cheese. We just don't care for sour cream. You could use milk if you don't want as much fat. But for Thanksgiving... we indulged!

The last few times I made regular mashed potatoes in advance, they really dried out overnight and when reheating.  These potatoes stayed very creamy and moist, even though we microwaved them a few times.  They were good with gravy.

I loooove this recipe and make it all the time. But I'm really bad - I double the sour cream and add extra garlic. When I've spread them in the dish I sprinkle them with chives for color...people just love them. Great with a red wine based beef gravy. A keeper in my books!

I've made this for Christmas dinner for 2 years now and there would be disappointment if I didn't.  The fact that you can make it the day before is a bonus but I've made it minutes before & it was just as good.

The day-before mashed potatoes were really good.  With the onion powder and sour cream, they tasted a lot like a sour cream and chive baked potato.  The rest of my family didn't really care for them, but I'd definitely make them for myself again (when I dare...they're not calorie friendly for sure).  I bet some bacon bits and cheddar cheese would be awesome on top!

Due to the fact that I was having company three days in a row, this recipe was such a huge help to me for our Christmas Day dinner. The thought of having to make the potatoes at the last minute was not appealing. Thank you so much for making my day so much easier!!

Just wonderful! If you want to make them even more sinful, sprinkle shredded cheddar and crumbled bacon over the top before baking. I also put chopped fresh chives in it. I did make it as well with no changes and it's awesome just the way it is too!

Came out excellent and really saved a lot of time on thanksgiving.  The only change I made was adding chives to the mix and just a small amount of milk. Before I baked it I put a few holes in the top and added some butter. Excellent flavor and not dry at all. Will do this one for every holiday.

I have made this dish a few times and have modified from its original ingredients to include finely chopped green onions and herbed cream cheese.  Every time I make it I get compliments. It is a real time saver because it can be made ahead.

The hit of last Thanksgiving!   Very creamy and tasty.  There is no need to use butter or salt on top of these great potatoes.  Very convienent to make the night before...reduced a lot of stress in the rest of the preparations for a big dinner.   Perfect recipe.

I made these for guests a day and a half in advance, because I had a crazy day and knew I wouldn't have much time to prepare a meal.  I thought the taste was good, but they were a bit dry for me.

I love being able to cook some dishes ahead of the big Thanksgiving Day celebration.  These potatoes are a family favorite.  These are my modifications:  I bake them for 50-60 minutes.  I rub the inside of the casserole dish with butter, then spread grated parmesan cheese on the dish.  I top the potatoes with bits of butter and additional parmesan.  Enjoy!

Sorry...just tasted like leftover, warmed up mashed potatoes.  May be better with cheese or more butter.

MMMMM....made our Thanksgiving dinner perfect!  And what a timesaver, too!  I got to enjoy our company, rather than stress over mashing 'taters at the last second!  Thanks!

These are INCREDIBLE potatoes! I couldn't stop eating them! Preparing mashed potatoes is so time consuming on the day of a big meal- so I think this is a SUPER idea. I didn't have onion powder so I added some garlic powder instead. Boy was it good! After reheating the potatoes the next day, I added a dab of butter before serving and stirred it up real well. Next time I will try lower fat versions of the ingredients. I have told all my friends about this recipe. It is a favorite!

This was okay. The sour cream made it taste, wel... sour! Also, it was dry, not creamy like I think mashed potatoes should be.

this recipe is easy and a real time saver but i didn't like the taste. it reminded me alot of instant mashed potatoes. everyone else liked them. my dad absolutly raved and he's very hard to please. everything else was great (texture, consistancy, etc). make sure you stir before serving. i also mixed some melted butter and frehly ground pepper into it before i put it out. that improved it quite a bit. thanks for the recipe.

I made these for Easter dinner for 17 people by doubling the recipe.  Everyone bugged me about how many potatoes there were.  However, at the end of dinner there were no leftovers but many requests for the recipe.  Highly recommended!!!!

This is what we did when 30+ of our relatives came for dinner on Boxing Day. We made the potatoes on Christmas, and the next day we heated them in the slow cooker. They were delicious--very creamy. Usually chilled mashed potatoes become lumpy, but not this time. In fact, these potatoes seemed to taste better with each passing hour!

I was a little skeptical about re-heating cold mashed potatoes, but these were the best mashed potatoes that I've had!  I doubled the recipe and added milk, like suggested, for Christmas dinner and it was a huge success.  My mom took home the leftovers and my recipe because my father liked them so much.

I'm sure Erin's recipe was delicious as it is, but for our dietary needs I made these changes: cut the amount of cream cheese and sour cream in half and even used low-fat versions of each; used 3 cloves of garlic instead of onion.  INCREDIBLE taste and ease.  Thanks, Erin!

Very easy and good. Made Thanksgiving a lot easier. I added a little extra butter, and will probably cut down on the sour cream next time so it's not the prevalent flavor (it's pretty strong).

YUMMY!  I love being able to make foods ahead of time.  This recipe is less tangy then another I have tried.  With 4 children and 1 on the way I have been experimenting with "freezer cooking".  This recipe will replace my other one.  One hint if you are going to freeze.  Freeze at the refrigerator stage.  Make sure you fully thaw (in fridge overnight) before putting in oven.  This helps with the consistency.

These potatoes taste wonderful!  The entire family enjoyed them for Thanksgiving.... few pointers though.  They are a little on the "thin" side, so if you like thick, heavy mashed potatoes, add the sour cream a little bit at a time until they are the consistency you desire.  Also, I din't have any onion powder, so I added a little granulated garlic and onion flakes to the boiling water.  Delicious!

These were okay, but we didn't really care for the taste of the cream cheese in the pototoes.  I guess we just like them better with butter and milk.

Not bad, but not as moist as I expected and I really didn't feel that it saved that much time.  Will probably just make the 'regular' way next time.  Leftovers keep and reheat well with a little milk and sour cream added.

I made these as part of a huge Christmas dinner and it was so nice to have the prep out of the way and just worry about the re-heating.  I used the whole brick of cream cheese (8oz) and topped with cheddar cheese.  I will definitely make these again!  Everyone loved them.

These are THE BEST mashed potatoes ever. It is so easy to make and convenient.  My family absolutely loves them.  I make them for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and for any other meat and potatoes meal. Try this recipe, you won't regret it.

I first made this several years ago, and since then, I am EXPECTED to bring it to every family Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. :)
I use 5 lbs of russets, and the whole 8 oz brick of cream cheese, since that's how it comes from the store. 

Make sure your boiled potatoes are DRY after draining the water,  before mixing in the other ingredients, and that the cream cheese and butter are very soft. Those steps are KEY.

Fantastic! I used garlic salt instead of onion powder, made the night before. Next day I placed them in the mixer to fluff up & added a bit of heavy whipping cream during the mixing process. Potatoes went into the  slow cooker on low with a stick of butter cut up and placed on top. A few hour later they were ready. Bon Appétit! Everyone raved how delicious they were!!

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck.  Everyone loved the flavor, but it was a little too sticky and thick. I read all the comments and even did some of the suggestions for the thickness, but it didn't seem to help? Next time I'll just stay with regular mash potatoes

I am reviewing as is.  Decent recipe, but in my opinion way to much onion powder.  Need to use half of what the recipe calls for.  If you are a big onion fan then go with what the recipe calls for.

These are so good! My potato-loving inlaws who are from Idaho gave these great reviews. I am a big cream cheese fan so i did throw in a little extra, and it was wonderful.

Seriously people, just review the recipe. These mashed potatoes are great just they way they are. Flavor is awesome and are super simple to make. And what a time saver making them the day before.

I've been making these for several years and they're always a hit. No need for gravy...it's kind of gilding the lily! My sister-in-law calls them "Naughty Potatoes" LOL.  I like to use ground white pepper and instead of the garlic powder, I use fresh garlic cloves that I microwave with a little butter until they're soft then mash it well. These are excellent!

I made these a couple nights ago and they turned out great! I followed others' suggestions and used Onion & Chive cream cheese instead of regular. I didn't leave them overnight- I just popped it straight into the oven after mixing and they were still great. Leftovers the next day were good too. I just put them in a microwavable dish and covered them with a damp paper towel for a couple of minutes. Thank you for this recipe!

Simple lots of flavor! I always add some chicken broth before baking just to make the potatoes more creamy.

This is actually the first "Allrecipe" that I did not love. Followed the recipe exactly. I (and all of my dinner guests)thought they were too dry, too thick and just not very good mashed potatoes. Sorry. Although they do make very good potato pancakes for breakfast.

Yum!!! The reviews about the strong taste of garlic are a little confusing as the recipe does not call for garlic. This time around I tossed in bacon bits and chives. Excellent recipe as written! Thank you

Wasn't terrible but a little too rich for my taste. Too much cream cheese I think. I made these and served them without chilling overnight, so maybe that had some thing to do with it. I won't be making them again.

Wonderful! This recipe has been voted even better than Grandma's by the entire family, which is really saying something since we looove our mashed potatoes. Recipe is great as is but I like to make 2 changes: garlic powder instead of onion powder and onion & chive cream cheese instead of regular. Enjoy!

Made these for Thanksgiving this yr. My goal was to do as little cooking on Thurs. as possible, so I made these ahead of time, put into slow cooker with a liner(after step 2). and froze in crock pan (after a few hrs. took pan out of freezer so potatoes were frozen to fit in crock) Thursday morning I put potatoes w/liner in pot and plugged it in, then forgot about it, till serving time. No need to add milk or pam or anything. The family loved them.

I have to say, these were a huge hit!  I did make them the day before and re-heated for Thanksgiving and they were perfect and yummy.  I did use the onion and chive cream cheese as others suggested and I did cook bacon and crumble it in the potatoes as well.  Fabulous!

EVERYONE and I do mean everyone at Thanksgiving loved these potatoes (even my onion hating mother). I was nervous to use a new recipe last minute but I'm so glad I did. I doubled this for 10lbs of potatoes and added an extra tsp. salt (for the doubled) size. Kept them warm in a crock pot on low for a couple of hours. Wonderful!

This is the second year I have made this for Thanksgiving.  This year I made with Yukon Gold potatoes instead of russets and it turned out even better than last year.  I used a 5# bag, a 16oz tub of sour cream, and 8 ounces of cream cheese, and 4 T of butter.  It's delicious!  Didn't have any onion powder either.

I didn't do the "Day Before", I served them right away (same day) and they were wonderful!  I've made similar potatoes before, but I never used the onion powder -- I think that's what made them unique and so flavorful.  They were a huge hit, and we can't wait to have leftovers, especially since they're supposed to taste even better that way!

I made this for our "Thanksgiving in February" feast and it was great! I followed the recipe word for word ingredients-wise and I followed the advice of a reviewer who used a crock pot to keep the potatos warm since I made them the day of the big dinner. That worked out GREAT! It kept the potatos piping hot and moist while I tended to everything else. After a quick mash, I did whip them up a bit in my Kitchenaid to ensure that there were no lumps. It was a huge hit and reminds me of the sour cream & onion chip flavors :o)

I think this is really good. The cream cheese and sour cream give them really good flavor. I use white pepper in my mashed potatoes. I made them in the morning and then baked them in the afternoon. Came out perfect. Perfect consistency etc. I did add a smidget of milk to them before baking though. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe. Reminds me of a twicebaked potato.

I made this for christmas dinner this year for my fiancee's family who are all excellent cooks.   I only made it 4 hrs before the meal and refrigerated for about three hours before cooking - made the recipe almost exactly as stated but added a few dashes of Rosemary to the dish - I cannot tell you how many people kept commenting on how great that was the only dish that had no leftovers and everyone wanted leftovers to eat the next day!!!  Thanks for my new go to mashed potato recipe!!!

Excellent and I used low fat sour cream and low fat cream cheese.  I added a bit of milk to thin it slightly.  Perfect!

They were easy to make but I was sort of disappointed.  I was glad to be able to make them ahead of time 9for Thanksgiving) but I was also glad there were other dishes on the table for people to eat.  Unbelievably, they came out somewhat dry and I ended up adding lots of whole milk to them to make them less dense.

I make these the day of also. First item I put together in the morning. I use the reduced fat cream cheese and the low fat sour cream and the taste and texture are wonderful. I like using Yukon gold in this recipe. The only thing to say about this is it is AWESOME! The advantage is on a holiday popping these in the oven as your roast or turkey rest to reheat. I take the prepared potatoes out of the fridge about an hour before I plan to toss them in to reheat. I also find using a metal pan quickens the process of reheating.

My mother-in-law recommended this recipe. I made this in the crock pot. I prepared it in the morning, and put it in the crock pot for the afternoon. I added quite a bit of shredded cheese. Next time I'm going to add velvetta and milk.

I've made this recipe several times and everyone always loves it. The reason I give it four stars is becuase the texture is better the day its made instead of the day before. So now I just make it the day I want to serve it:)

I loved this recipe. I didn't leave it overnight but it still turned out really well. I added in Romano cheese and topped it with more Romano and Italian breadcrumbs prior to baking. I left it at 350 degrees for a full hour to make sure the garlic didn't taste too raw and it got a really nice crust on top.Really nice and easy!

Did not change one thing.  So if you are reading review after review trying to decide what you should change, trust me and stop reading and follow the recipe. You will not be disappointed.

these were pretty good, nothing special taste wise, but the idea of making the potatoes ahead on Thanksgiving Day and putting them in the crockpot to stay hot was genius!  I will definitely do that again, and maybe add something to the potatoes to "spice" them up a bit.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was EVERYONE's favorite dish!  Incrediable.  So good you don't even need gravy on it.  I took the advice of others and used Yukon Gold Potatoes, onion and chive sour cream (this was key), and put it in the crock pot the night before with 1/4 stick of butter.  It was ready to go the next day and all gone by the time Thanksgiving was over!  Definately a keeper.

turned out very well on Thanksgiving. Even my MIL who turned her nose up when I told her I'd do the potatoes the day before and heat them up in the crockpot, remarked later how good they were. I left them a little long in the crockpot and the bottom got a nice brown crust . That was my MIL favorite. So all were happy.

Everyone loved the flavor of these at Thanksgiving and it was nice to have an item out of the way a day before.  I did notice when reheating to serve the first time, 30 minutes was not quite enough.  I had to give the potatoes a few minutes in the microwave and stir in some milk to "loosen" them a bit.  It still cam out great and I would do this recipe again in the future.  :-)

Need specifics on the size of the 9 potatoes called for in the recipe - and a size specification for the pan you bake it in. Both of these greatly effect the quality of the end product. Mine turned out dry. Not sure what all the raving is about! Sorry!

I did like that you could make them the day before but I thought there was to much cream cheese. But I would make them again but cut down on the cream cheese but over all it is a nice change to org. potatoes. I also made them the night before and used a crock pot they turned out fine

This is one of the best recipes one can use.  I've been making this for a number of years.  It is so convenient to have on hand.  I make half a recipe when we go camping, then just warm it up in the microwave.  I too put mine in a pam sprayed crockpot for holidays to free up the oven.  Takes longer to heat, but that is OK.  Love the recipe!

These were a perfect addition to a "gift of food" for my Mom and Dad's freezer. I followed the recipe exactly and loved the results. I use (and swear by) a ricer to "mash" my potatoes, which I believe adds great fluffiness to any "mashers". I was able to pack and freeze 4 large portions and they reheated perfectly. Thanks for this!

These get made for nearly every holiday now -- they taste great (only kind my DH will eat now) and being able to make them ahead of time is a lifesaver. I do used reduced fat cream cheese/sour cream and it tastes just as good -- however I tried the fat free sour cream/cream cheese one time in it and it tasted unpleasant - so stick with reduced fat.  I also chop fresh chives into mine for added flavor and color.

My dinner guests loved these potatoes..so much that the bowl was cleaned out! I added garlic powder & paprika and cut the cream cheese down to 4 oz. I made this morning,refrigerated until dinner time. These were an excellent addition to the beer butt chicken(off this site). I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I made a few adjustments. First, I used Yukon Gold potatoes (about 4 pounds) and left the peel on. Second, because I used more potatoes, I added 8 oz of cream cheese. Finally, I used garlic powder instead of the onion powder. I will definitely make this recipe again. 
Thanks Erin!

Just made for Easter dinner, and it was wonderful to just have to heat up the potatoes - what a time saver at dinnertime. I added 3 cloves of garlic when boiling the potatoes and used a potato ricer to 'mash' the potatoes. I added 4 ounces of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of light sour cream and 1/2 cup of 2% milk. Instead of the onion powder, I used 1/4 cup of finely chopped green onion. Rave reviews from the guests.

We used these as our Thanksgiving potatoes this year. I made them the day of, but made them early in the day so that the flavors had time to mingle.  They were very dry, but the flavor was PERFECT with the awesome sausage, apple, and cranberry stuffing, Maple roast turkey and gravy from this site.  It topped our layered Thanksgiving leftover Hash wonderfully!

I was surprised at how much I liked these because I'm not the biggest fan of cream cheese.  Being able to make it ahead of time was so useful for Thanksgiving dinner.

UPDATE:  I've made these a few times since then and the one thing I've learned is to throw the potatoes after cubing, cover with water, then heat to boiling and boil for 15 minutes from the point it starts boiling.  The potatoes are much easier to mash since they've been in the hot water a little bit longer.

As for the texture, these are heavier than most mashed potatoes, which is something that I prefer.

I love this recipe! I made it and baked it in the same day. I also added a tsp of garlic powder by mistake(thought I was adding onion powder)And added a cup or so of med. cheddar. I was afraid I had ruined it with the garlic but it was fabulous! I will make these again and Much Thanks for sharing!

I made these for a potluck and they were gobbled up!  I was a little upset that I didn't get to bring any leftovers home.  I did add cheddar cheese and bacon bits before baking as others had suggested.  I will be making this again!

These mashers are never fail. I make them every Thanksgiving, and they are always a hit. Plus, they're a great time saver because you can't make them the day before.

This was a great make ahead! Would use a 7x11 pan next time, it did take some extra time to get hot, but once we mixed it, it was perfect.  Also would add 1/2 onion, 1/2 garlic powder next time.
YUM!

These are the best mashed potatoes that I have ever eaten. This was my first go round at making Thanksgiving Dinner and having the ability to make these before made the day go a lot more smooth. And the tasted great as well, I even got compliments from the best cooks in the family. I also took the advice of some of the other reviews and added a little bit of milk and butter before they were served.

These were very good.  Although they did come out a little dry.  I will make them again and take some of the advice about adding a little milk right before baking.  The flavor was wonderful.  I used the leftovers to make potatoe cakes the following morning...yum!!!

The mashed potatoes turned out fabulous.
I sued the herbs and onion flavor cream cheese instead of the regular cream cheese, topped it with cheddar cheese and bacon bites.
My guests from all ages loved it.
I would aboslutely use this recipe every time I make my potatoes...

I was a little worried about the texture as the cream cheese and sour cream made somewhat of a glue-like texture.  HOWEVER, they were a HIT!  After baking the next day they came out fluffy.  So easy to pop in the oven rather than fumble around minutes before serving the meal.  Thank you!

These are the absolute best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  I served these for Thanksgiving - tripled the recipe because I had a lot of guest and they ate every last bite of them before the night was over!  I will definitely be making this again.  I did add more butter than listed - After I baked it I put dollups of butter on top and served it.  Big hit!

These potatoes were great, and reheated very well. I did do a few things differently...boiled and mashed several garlic cloves with the potatoes, mixed fresh chives in the potatoes instead of onion powder, and because I didn't have sour cream, I added extra butter and milk. They were amazing!

Excellent flavor!!! One of my dinner guest's said they had a taste all their own, and he's right. I think the sour cream is the magic ingredient.  I made these the day of because some people said they came out a little dry the next day. Also, I added some milk because they seemed heavy & I prefer them creamier. These will be made again & again on special occasions. Thanks so much for sharing.

These are good, but soooo thick!  I had to add milk and they were still thick, but good.  Filling, too.  I used neufchatel and light sour cream.  I used garlic salt in place of the salt and onion powder.  Very convenient to make them the day before- then the big day isn't so hectic.

This was awesome the kids i work with in a high school made this for a thanksgiving dinner that they put on for staff, there was nothing left we had about 30 people and they all raved over it. i am also using it for my thanksgiving dinner (thank goodness only 10 people) i did omit the sour cream (cause the kids forgot it buy it at the store ) but added a little milk instead and added a little extra cream cheese, it was awesome adn the kids enjoyed the raves that the staff gave them about the meal.

My husband made this today in advance of Thanksgiving, but he used neufchatel instead of cream cheese. UNBELIEVABLE flavor! I licked everything off the beaters and had to restrain myself from diving into the bowl. Made this way, it seems a crime to serve gravy with the potatoes. The flavor makes the dish stand by itself.

Good! Very fattening though! But if you don't mind, they are wonderful. Easy too!

Halfed the recipe and used 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon onion.  As others suggested, I sprinkled with grated cheese and chopped green onions.  Okay, but a bit bland for our taste.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but these turned out really dry.  When I made them up the night before, they seemed ok, but the next day they needed a lot of gravy on them.  Maybe next time I'll try adding some extra milk or something.  Tasted great, but we just weren't thrilled with the texture.

I had to work the entire week of Thanksgiving and had several guests over that day.  I made these the night before and was pleasantly surprised they turned out as well as they did.  A really great time saver and worth saving for times when you're in a pinch for time.

"Day Before" Mashed Potatoes did not at all sound appetizing to me, but I thought I'd give it a try.  We were going to do the day before thing, but ended up just making it the day of and it was awesome.  Definitely the only recipe I will use for MP from now on.  We had ham, so we didn't have any gravy and decided not to fuss with making any, so we had it without.  I wouldn't even make gravy for it.  It was awesome by itself!  **Next time I may try adding a box of frozen spinach (cooked) for something different.  I tried "Sally's Spinach Mashed Potatoes" on here and loved the concept, but they were somewhat bland.  I think it would be really good with this recipe.  I'd love to try red potatoes also.

I made this on Thanksgiving Day, and interestingly enough, it tasted much better the day after than the day of, so the name of the recipe is fitting! Next year, I'll definitely take advantage of this and make it ahead of time.

I made these potatoes for my family at Thanksgiving and I was a little disappointed.  Like others, I found them to be a little dry and the flavour was a touch bland.  If I made them again, I don't think I would let them sit overnight...I think I would serve them right away since they weren't as dry at that time.

If you are looking for a time saving side then this is it. Although pretty fattening they are worth every bite. I figure if your are watching what you eat then you aren't eating carbs anyway and if you are do it with gusto! My family loves this spin on the average mash. Thanks for the recipe! I always fall back on it when I need to planahead!

I wish I had more than 5 stars.  This recipe was amazing.  I made it for a couple of friends and now I can't wait to make it again.  It is so much more flavorful than the regular potatoes I had as a kid.  Definitely one of my top recipes now.

Erin.. thank you so much.. rave reviews at our Thanksgiving dinner.  Tasted just as if you had just "prepared" them.  I used a ricer too.  Creamy and they "held" very well when I had to transport them.

These were awesome!!! My family and I always go crazy for mashed potatoes during the holiday-so these made me the most popular person at the dinner table! So flavorful! So moist! The only bad news is that I assume it would take about 30 hours of Pilates to burn these off!

My family renamed this recipe to Heavenly Potatoes.  This is our new mashed potatoe recipe. My family loves to use lots of gravy, but the potatoes had so much flavor they didn't need it. We liked them better the night before, without baking them.  So that's the only change I will be making.  Next time, I might experiment with reduced fat ingredients to cut the fat and caleries.

My guests & myself loved this recipe. My Husband thought they were a little too thick & a bit dry. I will make this again for sure, but maybe add a touch of milk & a bit more sour cream.

Delicous and easy!  I mixed in some horseradish the next day and then I put cheddar, green onion, and bacon on top.

This recipe was recommended to me by a friend who had tried it.  My entire family LOVES these potatoes!  They almost melt in your mouth.  I have even baked them the same day I prepared them and they still tasted great.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These were a hit for Easter.  Made the night before, so convenient and carried to a potluck lunch.  I did add shredded cheese and sprinkled green onion on top.

These were terrific! I needed them for dinner right then so I didn't refrigerate or bake. I just whipped them up and served them. I only added a little (less then 1/2 cup) sour cream because I was afraid since I wasn't refrigerating overnight that it might overpower them. We loved the onion flavor too! They turned out creamy and great. My husband loved them! And even my very picky 2 year old and my 10 month old loved them. Next time, I will try the recipe and make overnight just to see because it would be convenient to make ahead.. I just don't always know what I'm making the night before. Thanks!

Made these with a great tenderloin recipe on this site.  They are perfect for entertaining because you just put them in the oven well after they are prepared.  I did not use sour cream but did add about 1/3 cup of half & half to the mixture.  They had a GREAT flavor and reheated well too with a little milk added to thin the mix.  The longer they sit before baking the better the flavor seemed to be.  Thanks!

This was so awesome for Thankgiving! I had 32 people to dinner and wasn't looking forward to peeling and mashing 10lbs of potatoes along with everything else I had to prepare, so this was a life saver! I put it in the crock pot and stuck it in the fridge over night and in the morning when I started my turkey I look these out and started the crock pot, by the time dinner was ready to potatoes were heavenly, a lot of prep but a definate keeper for the holidays! Everyone love them!

These were the best mashed potatoes we have ever had. You don't have to add anything to them to warm them up the next day. I will make these all the time from now on.

This is a very good recipe.  My inlaws are not fond of mashed potatoes but loved these.  So easy to make!  Heated up nicely in the microwave too (ran out of room in the oven as well as the stove!)

Loved the consistency, but a little to much onion powder for my likeing. I will make again and use less onion powder or find a replacement powder like garlic or even fresh chives.

FABULOUS!  FABULOUS!  I used a five pound bag of potatoes and followed the recipe exactly.  The sour cream and cream cheese taste seemed very prevelant right after all my ingredients were mixed in.  Once the potatoes were refrigerated for 8 hours and cooked the flavors all blended seemlessly!  My potatoes required a much longer cooking time than 30 minutes....but worth the wait.  They are even better as leftovers!

I served this for Thanksgiving and I loved the ease of this dish (except I used Yukon Gold potatoes and had to peel a ton of them!).  I tasted it the day before I baked it and I was a little worried because it tasted really sour!  However, after baking, the next day, it tasted really great!  Thanks Erin for making my life easier!

Super good!!  I made these for Thanksgiving and it really cut down on the work I had to do.  And I have to say, they are even better reheated a second or third time!  This was one leftover that got eaten up quick!

WOW!!  This is the best mashed potato recipe that I have found!  I did sub. red potatoes (about 4 lbs) not peeled and added a little more salt than what was called for.  No more last minute stress at turkey time trying to keep the potatoes hot without getting dried out.  Now somebody get me an extra oven to cook with :) !

The only thing I did different was I adjusted it to use a few more potatoes and I prepared in the morning to make for an evening Thanksgiving dinner.  No rave reviews and I thought it was pretty bland tasting.  Maybe I didn't adjust the onion powder enough.  Anyway, think I will stick with my tried and true garlic and herb mashed potatoes in the future.  If I was to make this again I would definately add a touch of garlic along with the onion powder.

I love the flavor of these mashed potatoes HOWEVER they came out very thick and dense.  I made the potatoes for company and it didn't go over very well.  When I reheated them for leftovers I added milk and butter and they were much better.

These potatoes were very good.  I even used lite cream cheese and sour cream in the recipe.  I did add a little milk to the mix to help loosen them up a bit.  One note:  If you double the recipe, do not double the onion powder.  I used three teaspoons and it was plenty for a doubled batch.  I will use this recipe again.

I have to agree with everyone else!  I made these potatoes for Christmas dinner and there wasn't any left.  I don't even like mashed potatoes, but these were delish!  Easy to do also.  All my guests at dinner requested that I make this a standard holiday recipe.  Thanks to Erin.

The best mashed potatoes ever!  They have a good sour cream and onion flavor to them.  These are much better than plain mashed potatoes.  I made these for Thanksgiving 2002 and was so impressed that I’m making them for Christmas too.  I found this recipe easy except for peeling the potatoes, which I hate to do (I think that I will talk my sister into peeling the potatoes for Christmas).  I think that these mashes potatoes could be eaten right away and still be good, but I have not tried them that way.  The whole reason that I went with this recipe was to have something done the day before.

Made this for Thanksgiving - and altho made life easier not doing the potatoes while wrestling with the turkey at the last minute - I thought they were a little dense and not creamy enough.  But the doing ahead option is great if you are doing ALL the cooking!!!

I made these for a family dinner. I thought they were good, but my husband remarked "Who made the potatoes, they are really good!" He fried up the leftovers the next day in butter and ate all of them

These were nice and easy.  I ran out of sour cream so used yogart.  It turned out well and had no left overs.

This was so good.  I made them for Thanksgiving and my husband loved them.  I did add a little more butter and used garlic powder because I was out of onion powder, this worked well.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and followed the recipe exactly and was thrilled with the results.  I also made Slow Cooker Stuffing and Gourmet Sweet Potato Classic from this site.  Being able to make these a day ahead of the big Thanksgiving meal made a world of difference, none of the usual frantic rush.  We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and delicious food very much.  I'd recommend this approach highly.  Thanks for the great recipe Erin!

This recipe was wonderful!  I made it for Thanksgiving.  I doubled the recipe and added 2 tsps of Rosmeary for a little zing.  By the next day, when I reheated the potatoes, the rosemary had nicely permeated the dish.  We have never run out of mashed potatoes, but this year we did!

These potatoes had a really good flavor, but I thought that they were too stiff. I will probably try them again, but will add milk and serve them right away instead of baking them the next day. Thanks  :)

These were fantastic.  I admit I was a little skeptical of preparing these the night before Thanksgiving but they turned out wonderful.  It was so nice to prepare this dish in advance (one less thing to do the day of).  I had many compliments even from people who were not fans of mashed potatoes.  This will become a standard recipe for our family.

Mine didn't turned out creamy although it taste good. I used 11 large russet potatoes boiled a day ahead. Maybe less potatoes or smaller potatoes will do it. Help anyone. How do you make this creamier or what potatoes did you use?

These are marvelous! I made them with Yukon Gold potatoes for our Thanksgiving dinner, and the flavor was incredible.  These are my favorite all-time mashed potatoes, and I will never make them any other way. They reheated beautifully on the big day, and made great potato pancakes the following.  I should also add that I used the reduced fat cream cheese (Neufschatel), and there was no way to tell...rich and creamy.  Thanks for this great recipe.

These mashed potatoes are AWESOME! I won't make them any other way! I've made them several times now, usually for company. I've always gotten rave reviews! I make a "light" version by using Neuchatel cream cheese and light sour cream.

The BEST! I made these for Christmas dinner and used light sour cream and light cream cheese to cut a few fat grams. No one even noticed and almost everyone went back for seconds. 2005 follow-up: since I first made these in 2000 the family expects them for Thanksgiving and Christmas. They love "my" mashed potatoes. Thank goodness they can be prepared the day before and then popped in the oven. When I have time and plan ahead, I've started adding a few cloves of roasted garlic which makes these taste even better.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit! I did make it the day before and then put it in slow cooker with 1/2 c whipping cream and a couple more Tbl of butter. I will definitely make this again and add the bacon bits! Thanks for recipe!

Like other reviewers, I just made this a few hours in advance. This has been a staple recipe for years - I love cream cheese and sour cream in Mashed potatoes. Thanks!

It turned out great.   I actually made this the same day to take to a friends house.   I used cream cheese with onion and chive and it added some more flavor. I also added french fried onion rings to the top before serving.  Everyone loved them!

I wish I had known about this recipe sooner.  It solves the problem of preparing and keeping mashed potatoes hot for your favorite meal. Putting it in a crock pot for a couple hours (no longer) before your meal is served is perfect.

I normally hate making mashed potatoes, and this recipe was no different. However, I hated this one much much less. I’ll probably go lighter on the onion powder next time, since I’m not an onion fan, but the sour cream flavor cake out strongly, which was nice. I used these for meatloaf cupcakes, and they were a really good consistency for the frosting, not runny but still smooth and creamy.

I made only slight changes in the seasonings.  Not sure I don’t prefer my mashed potatoes made the day of the dinner.  However, I will try this recipe and day before method again.  Perhaps I will use Yukon Gold potatoes next time.

These potatoes are Killer!!  I made them the day before & you do not have to worry that they won’t be delish the next day. For Thanksgiving, I opted to not add any cheese to the casserole, though I certainly will for other meals.
I used 10 MED/LG  Russet potatoes, 8 oz. cream cheese, whole milk, and easily 4T of Plugra butter. salt & pepper to taste.   I added 6 cloves of peeled, fresh garlic cloves to the boiling potato water. Do not overlook these boiled potatoes as they will become elastic.    
I drained, mashed (potatoes & garlic),  then added other ingredients, placed all in an 8x8 greased casserole dish (you can use 9x9 or 9x13 ):  let cool COMPLETELY.   I pricked several holes in the top, filled those w a little milk, dabbed on even more butter, covered & refrigerated. Thanksgiving morning I took them out, uncovered, & let come to room temperature.  About 2 1/2 hours before dinner time, I put the potatoes into my crock pot on LOW.  3 hrs is the max or they will get brown at edges of pot. I did add a bit of warmed milk, more butter & salt while they were warming.
You will be HAPPY.  These are delicious & it’s nice to be able to prepare these ahead & not need to tie up oven space.
Enjoy!

This is a great way to finish off leftover mashed potatoes. I skipped the overnight step, and just cooked them immediately. They were great!

Made for Thanksgiving the day before and then refrigerated.  Warmed them up the next day and didn't miss the last minute struggle getting everything ready at the same time.  Will definitely make again.

This did not turn out well. The potatoes were so thick that it blew out the beaters. I don't normally eat sour cream, but decided to use it based on the recipe and reviews. It was a strong taste that I dint care for. However, beyond that taste we had to add a ton of milk, butter, and other stuff for liquid, to thin them out. I won't try this again and don't recommend it.

This is a great option if you are in a time crunch. Get it done the night before and just bake it in the oven for 20 - 30min before you need it. Tastes amazing, every keeps asking when I'm going to make my mashed potatoes.

I adjusted this recipe to feed 1400 people with Rave Reviews! We bought the potatoes already mashed and cold. By starting with everything cold, we didn't have to worry about cooling that much down safely. I am planning to make this for both Thanksgiving and Christmas for my Family.

I give them a 4 on taste and a 5 for convenience.  I think there is too much sour cream and Philadelphia cream cheese in them and where is the butter?  I add a whole stick of butter, and cut back on the cream cheese and sour cream.  Just taste them as you mash them and adjust according to personal preference.  Lots of salt and pepper and top with more butter to keep it moist while cooking.  Keep them covered as you warm them up.

Making this again this year for Thanksgiving. Easiest way to avoid the pile up in the kitchen and really enjoy the day with family & friends. Love this make ahead mentality. I made this last year and the family loved these potatoes, fluffy and tasty.  Putting in the crock pot to warm up just makes this so easy and opens up the oven space.  :)

Made it for Thanksgiving the whole family loved it. I also make regularly and add to upcoming meals for the week. Definitely have to make at least a day ahead of time, not a same day recipe. The only differences is I did not peel the potatoes (the healthiest part of the potato is in the skin), used real onion (diced) rather than powder, and added crushed garlic.

These were OK. I made them the day before, as the recipe suggested and I snuck a little taste test. They were great! The next day I put them in the oven, and they were a little dry. You can definitely taste the sour cream. I will make these again with some tweaks.

So disappointed. I usually make all five star recipes off of all recipes com with great success. Not this time. When it called for 2 teaspoons of onion powder I hesitated on the second teaspoon thinking that sounded like an awful lot. But I'm a firm believer in respecting the recipe as it is written and follow it the first time to a T.  so I went ahead and added the 2 teaspoons. When I got it all together And had my first taste all I could taste with the overpowering taste of the onion powder I didn't even read the reviews like I usually do because I've had so much success with making delicious food off of the five star recipes. That was another mistake I should've read the reviews first.  I also found it very very dry so I'm going to make my good old mashed taters for thanksgiving tomorrow. I also discovered that it wouldn't be good recipe to use for the holidays because I will already have a turkey in the oven or rolls or something else so I need to make them on the stovetop.

I made this today, it was delicious! I didn't do the whole next day step, but I did leave it in the refrigerator before I baked it. I also didn't have any onion powder, so I substituted it with a dash of lemon pepper. It came out great! I cannot wait to use this recipe for my very 1st thanksgiving dinner. Thank you so much for sharing this very tasty recipe.

I agree with another reviewer that it was very dry as written.  I had to add some milk/cream. (Maybe my potatoes were too large for the amounts of the other ingredients.) Also added some fresh chopped chives and topped with a little shredded cheese.  Great idea to have it made ahead, though -- I hate trying to mash potatoes at the last minute!

Easy dish! I made and put immediately in the removable part of the crock pot that was sprayed with cooking spray.  The next day I took it out of the fridge and put it in the other part of the crock pot and turned it on low for 3 hrs.  It worked perfect and kept my oven free for other items.  I wish I owned a ricer to mash the potatoes (I think they would have been creamier) and I did add a little shredded cheese to the ingredients.  Other than that, I made exactly as described.  Everyone loved them!

Mmmmm!!! Great recipe! I just made it for dinner, didn't refrigerate overnight, and it was awesome. Easy to make, and more healthy than some of the other recipes out there while still maintaining a great taste! My husband also loves it.  I'll definitely make this again.

This one got mixed reviews.  At the suggestion of other reviewers I used the chive cream cheese but everything else the same.  Some people loved it, others weren't that impressed and would have preferred it without the cream cheese. Might try it with the plain cream cheese next time. I put it all together the night before but did not bake it.  Again took the suggestion of others and put it all in a crock pot the next day for about 3 hours and then on "warm" till we were ready to sit down.  That worked out great and did not tie up my oven which was needed for other things.

I made these fresh instead of the night before. They came out dry, and were only saved by adding milk! They tasted OK, but could be a bit more flavorful. I'll probably try my luck with other recipes.

This was a huge hit for Thanksgiving dinner. I made a huge amount, and pot was empty at end of the meal!
I altered recipe a bit-I used red-skin potatoes, and didn't remove all the skins, I substituted 1 tsp Garlic Salt for onion powder and salt, and added a little Chives. It turned out great, and nice that I didn't have a pot and beaters to clean up after dinner.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it turned out so good, I'm making them again this year. It's for a large group, so I wanted to make the best!  I use the crock pot method that was mentioned, and it works so good for taking to someone's home.

Thanks soo much for posting!!! It really helped me out! 
Plus tasted great, although i did tweak a bit. If you like a slightly acidic taste, you can add natural yogurt. I also added garlic salt. I also lessened the amounts of creamcheese, butter, and sour cream, by a little bit and added some of the water i used for cooking, and milk. THanks again, Erin!

5stars for less stress making them the day before.  2-stars for taste.  These are way to rich.  My family could hardly eat them.  Never again will i put cream cheese and sour cream in mashed potatoes.  Back to the tradional way and i still will make the day before.

Soooo helpful for me since I have found this.  Just removing one item the day of Thanksgiving buys me so much more time.  I do not detect any difference thatn the potatoes I have been making for the years prior.  (I still add minced garlic and extra sour cream).

Loved these potatoes for Thanksgiving.  I did make them ahead one day, and placed in a crock pot with cream and extra butter  the day of the meal.  Even reheated for leftovers they were great.  Every last bite was gone!

Awesome and EASY! I always mess up timing on my thanksgiving potatoes and this avoids that. Stick them in the over and serve. They hold up really well for days as leftovers.

I was looking for a way to cut down on cooking time on Thanksgiving day.  The only thing I did differently was to heat the tato mixture up in the crock pot, instead of the oven.  They were fantastic!

There are many reasons why this recipe works.  For one, you can totally make this healthy.  Go for fat free sour cream and cream cheese and it's got so little butter that it doesn't matter.  For the basic mashed potatoes its usually a stick of butter and  heavy cream or the boxed stuff that tastes like cardboard with herbs and have more salt than the Pacific ocean...no ty!  Two, we loved the taste of this one.  Not bland, and the cream cheese was a neat twist.  I used a mixer to make it extra creamy (personal preference), added onion flakes instead of powder and pretty much added amounts to taste.  I also ate this same day, so no oven (nothing to cook anyway).  Last, I paired this up with Glazed Meatloaf II...what a meal!  Definitely recommend this one.

I made these for Christmas dinner and they were a HUGE hit with the entire family, including my parents and grandparents.  I'll definitely make them again for the holidays.  They were a big time saver.

I've made these many times and they're ALWAYS a crowd pleaser. Since my time is usually short (two toddlers 18 months apart), I don't even peel the potatoes. Also, I don't bake these. I just serve them right after I mush everything together (in the crock pot). That way they are still moist (and saves time). They taste great reheated with cheese and bacon on top.  Oh, By the way...if any of you are new to cooking, DON"T try to "mash" these in a food processor!!! They end up being a gluey mess. I learned this the hard way as I was trying to cook an impressive meal for my in-laws when I was first married. They certainly made an impression! Just not the one I was going for! :)

This is my go-to receipe for gatherings. Rather than just dump in a entire cup of sour cream go slow, you can always add more. A pinch of garlic powder is nice. Love the onion!

Excellent mashed potatoes!  I made them the day before I needed them and put them in the crock pot for about three hours before serving them.  I added a couple tablespoons of minced garlic and otherwise followed the recipe.  I'd definitely make these again!

A bit dry for my taste so I added 1/3 cup of milk. I used them as a base for the Twice Baked Mashed Potato recipe.

I made these for Thanksgiving early in the day so I wouldn't take up the stove. I followed review's suggestions, and used chive cream cheese and added extra garlic powder and onion powder, and fried a couple of garlic cloves chopped before I mashed the potatoes. They still weren't too garlicy. I kept them warm in the crock pot, they stayed soft and creamy until dinner, and they were a real hit with the crowd! The leftovers warmed up MUCH better than normal mashed potatoes! They are richer than I would make on a regular basis, but they were great for a special occasion.

This was delicious. I was concerned about the cream cheese part, but you couldn't taste it..the flavors worked well together and reminded me of the flavor of the inside of a potato knish.  Loved this!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and was pretty disappointed in the flavor and texture.  The potatoes had a "flat" flavor and were very hard when reheating.  I ended up trying to salvage the dish by adding more butter, milk, salt and fresh chives.  Sorry, but I would not make this recipe again.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving so that I could have the potatoes taken care of and ready to go in the oven. I followed the recipe with my own measurements of the indgredients. Potatoes turned out creamy and tasty on Thanksgiving. I topped with cheddar cheese and they made a pretty presentation as well as tasteful one.

I made these about 4 hours before dinner was served and kept them in the crockpot on low.  I used red potatoes and kept the skins on.  These potatoes were absolutely delicious!  I'll make this recipe again!

It was so awesome to have these made and in the slow cooker ahead of time!  I made these 4 hours before dinner and put PAM in a slower cooker and these mashed potatoes got so creamy and tasty!  This was my first Thanksgiving (that I've hosted) and everything turned out perfect thanks to this site.  Thanks Erin for a wonderful recipe!  It was a big hit in my family.

Mine did not turn out well.  I reduced the recipe, so I suppose I could have missed a calculation.  But they were dry and when I baked them the next day, they did not get crusty on top.

Almost but not quite the same flavor as make that same day taters, but not that different plus I enjoyed having one less thing to stress about on turkey day to make and to enjoy my guest. No complaints from the guests and they were devoured. I did add a bit of cream and butter right before baking based on other suggestions. Were nice and creamy!

I LOVED this recipe. It was a huge hit and disappeared quickly. I followed the instructions pretty much to the "T." I did not fluff them up on Thanksgiving Day. I just stuck them in the oven like it said and they were very very good.

These are great to make ahead for big dinners, or to put directly on the table.  The cream cheese adds a lot. Thanks!

I added more butter because why not? I cooked them right after preparing them so I'm not sure if that changed the flavor but they were so good. I left the skins on the potatoes too - didn't seem to hurt them any. Will definately make again.

Good bye boring mashed potatoes. This recipe is wonderful. I add some feta cheese to give it an extra zing. This recipe is a great year round side dish and a must have during the holidays.

My guests LOVED this!  It was so easy since it was made the day before. I ended up keeping it in my oven for almost an hour, but I think it's because my oven isn't so good.

I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I would use less potato or more liquid.  The end product was a bit too firm.  Also, I was expecting more flavor but they tasted no different than my usual: boil, mash, milk, butter, S&P.

I used 5 pounds of red potatoes, left the skin on, and adjusted everything accordingly. Per other reviewers, I used chive cream cheese and it was a great flavor. Most people enjoyed these. But I found them to be a bit pasty. The consistency was different.

These mashed potatoes are SO good. Even if you just make it and serve it right away, it's EXCELLENT! I added a little bit of garlic powder. I can't believe I never thought to put cream cheese and sour cream to mashed potatoes before! I make these all the time now.

Only change I made was to substitute garlic salt for the regular salt.  I have made this 4-5 times at the holidays and the crowd really likes it.

Everyone loved these except for me. I didn't like the garlic flavor and they seemed too whipped and pastey. However, the crowds polished them off quickly and it was very convenient to have them in the oven as our Turkey rested.

Execution was awesome, glad to have a dish off the stove well before dinner.  All the cream did take flavor away from the potatoes; I will cut back next time.

My mother and I both liked this recipe, which I fixed for Thanksgiving.  However, my hubby and children and grand-children did not!  Think it was the sour cream taste that they didn't like!

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner & they were good, but I don't rememeber thinking they were out of this world.  I think that I need to make them again when I can actually try to enjoy them & make sure they don't stay in the over longer than they should.  I will say they were good the night before when I made them up & they smelled incredible when I was putting them away for the night.  Will be making again for sure to give another try!

WOW!  I dont know who said to add the chives and onion cream cheese but yummy! I also used the yukon gold potatoes as suggested and some extra milk and butter and garlic powder :) This was a great recipe. I made it the same day and kept warm but loved it.  I think this is my new mash pot. recipe.  I want to try it with cheddar cheese and bacon pieces next time :)

Very easy recipe. I used Russet potatoes which turned out great. I agree with other reviews in using an onion/chives cream cheese. I made this the night before & put in my slow cooker for 2 hours on low the next day...added some heavy cream & butter because it gets really stiff overnight. Overall, a great recipe that everyone loved.

I must have used huge potatoes, because this dish was more dry than I would expect (not as creamy as making plain mashed potatoes).

I added garlic powder instead of onion powder because I had it on hand.  Tasted like roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  I made them an hour before serving and they turned out fabulous!  Awesome recipe thanks!

After reading the reviews, I decided to make the day of & put in the crockpot - I made them as is and tasted right away - YUM!  They were soooo good!  I then made the unfortunate mistake of putting them in the crockpot to stay warm - they were in the crock pot on low for about 5 hours before dinner was served - too long!  They began liquifying & lost the wonderful fluffiness.  I will absolutely make this again, but will probably make only about an hour or so ahead and place them in a casserole dish then keep them warm in the oven.

Everyone loved them. I only used a 1/4 stick of butter and a 1/4 cup of whipping cream in the morning but I don't think I even needed to add them because it water them down. But they tasted so good...

These potatoes were VERY good when we first made them.  However, after refrigerating overnight, as many other reviewers have posted, they get very dry and hard and dense.  Before cooking the next day I mixed in some milk and that helped a little, but you lose that freshly made texture by refrigerating for several hours.   Overall they had a nice flavor, but I would recommend getting all the ingredients together and making these right before serving.  I would give that recipe 5 stars.   The texture and consistency just gets lost and that's why I can only give this 3 stars.  No rave reviews from the Thanksgiving guests on this one.

I think this recipe was great - and well received by the Company I had over. After reading the reviews, I added more milk to the potatoes the day I put them in the casserole dish, and I think that helped a lot. I also added a couple pats of butter before i put it in the oven and stirred it all together when it came out so it was combined well. The potatoes are nice and dense and have a really good flavor. Oh, and instead of onion powder I used lipton onion soup mix (b/c I had a pack open already). Will make again for sure.

Truly fantastic potatoes! We made these the morning of Thanksgiving and put them in a crock pot on low until dinner.  Soooo easy!

Went over great with a party of 10 for Thanksgiving.  I followed the recipie, except using low fat sour cream.  Since that's all the store had left.  Followed others advice and beat it with 1/2cup milk the day of...turned out great.  No leftovers!

These were sooo yummy! I took the advice of others and didn't make them the day before. Also i added a layer of shredded cheddar cheese the last 10 minutes of baking. I think these would also be good without baking them because i tasted them before i put them in and i didn't want to stop eating them! I will definitley make these again!

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner this year and they were great. I did not add the onion powder simply because I wasn't sure if everyone would like the onion flavor but will definitely add it to my own family's eats.

Used Yukon Gold potatoes and this barely made it to the table.  My kids were eating it out of the serving bowl with disposable tasting spoons.  Did as others suggested and put into crock pot.  Worked perfectly.  Thank you

This recipe really helped me out on Thanksgiving day when I have so much to do. I actually did this in the morning while the turkey was in the oven. So, I made these and just dumped them into the crock pot hot. If I had chilled them overnight, I would have used others suggestion to poke holes in the potatoes with a fork and then pour milk and butter over the top so they don't dry out. I would also stir every hour. Then I would put on low for at least 2.5 hours before dinner. I boiled 4 garlic cloves with my 8 lbs of potatoes for some flavoring. I have also used chive flavored cream cheese... Sometimes I also use shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon bits for a baked potato resemblance. Or you can top with shredded mozzarella cheese. PS Don't forget to spray the crock pot with pam before adding potatoes, so they don't stick.

The day making the potatos were awesome. The day after putting them in the fridge left a stiff potato starchy dish. Make these the day of, not the day before. They will taste like gourmet potatoes that you will find in fine restaurants.

These were great! I made this recipe with 10 pounds of russet potatoes, 16 ounces of onion and chive cream cheese, 18 ounces of sour cream, 1 1/2 sticks of butter and replaced the onion powder with garlic powder. It made a ton of mashed potatoes - filled up a large crockpot to the very top. I plan on making potato soup with the leftovers. YUM!

Great recipe for Thanksgiving. Cooked the potatoes in chicken broth and left out the onion powder. I lined the crockpot with a cooking bag to make cleanup simpler.  This sure took the pressure off at serving time.  These potatoes were delicious and I will make them again.

These potatoes turned out amazing!  I used chive and onion cream cheese instead of plain.  I also made them about an hour before serving and put them in the crockpot (sprayed with cooking spray) on high to keep warm.

This recipe was just so-so. I made this recipe for my first Thanksgiving. I usually just use butter, whole milk, pepper, and salt to season my mashed potatoes and they come out great. This seemed like just a lot of extra ingredients for naught. I'm also not a big fan of onion or garlic in my mashed potatoes but I guess that's just a personal taste.

These were great!  I was trying to get my turkey dinner prep done ahead of time, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  I added some garlic and chives, and left the peel on the potatoes to give it a more baked potato look.  I made it the night before and it warmed great in a shallow baking pan.  We fried up the leftovers the day after and had them with our eggs for breakfast.

These so good. I've made these several times. They always get raved about. Most of the time I make them with the "Broiled Tilapia Parmesan", which is also a great recipe. Such a great meal with a vegetable.

I took others advice and made this a few hours ahead instead of a day ahead, which kind of defeats the purpose, but I was afraid.  I could not bring myself to add cream cheese (my Irish mother and grandmother's spirit would not let me).  It was creamy and yummy!  I may bring myself to add the cream cheese next time!

This is very good, I've made it many times.  I always use this recipe when I have a lot of family over for dinner.  It's easy to make a day ahead and serve hot with dinner.  I followed another's suggestion and put the potatoes in the crock pot, heated on low for about 2 hours and it was hot and ready to serve with the meal.

I hate, hate, hate to do potatoes, and was disgusted when we got 'assigned' them for our big holiday dinner.... but this recipe (and my daughter!) saved the day!  She made them the night before and everyone raved about them!

I wasn't in love with this recipe.  I made these the day before and warmed them in the oven to serve.  They were dry and stiff.  They needed to have some milk or cream added in my opinion.

Should have used SiSi's suggestions when I made these.  Mine were dry and heavy.  I will try them once more being sure to use the Yucon gold's.

Very good for its intended purpose.  Great flavor. A warning to those who haven't tried day-ahead mashed potatoes; you will lose that light and fluffy consistency of freshly prepared mashed potatoes. For us, it wasn't worth the trade-off, but that has nothing to do with the recipe, just personal preference.

After heating through, just give them a quick stir.  Just like a fresh batch of mashed potatoes.  This is great for company.  I hate using my mixer when guests are at the house.  It's so loud and inhibates conversation.  I will make this whenever we entertain.

This recipe was good, but not the best.  The potatoes were very thick. I made them the same day, a few hours before dinner.  Next time I will not make them ahead of time.  I think it thickens up after it sits for a while.

Loved the 'day before' aspect of this, but I gotta say I think they would have tasted amazing the night I made them, but came out a little dry on Thanksgiving. The family all said they were great though - especially when drizzled with gravy on Thanksgiving.

This was good and I was grateful to have it ready to go in the oven when Thanksgiving morning came around. Our family prefers a big pot full of real mashed spuds, but this would be perfect for a potluck!

These are the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.  Wow!  They are easy to make.  My husband devoured them and he doesn't normally do that. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and made them in the morning a couple of hours before I baked them.  I added some chives to mine.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe for Christmas and will definitely use it again.  I didn't have any onion powder so I added a little T.S. Garlic!Garlic!  I heated mine in my slow cooker on low for about 3 hours and I did stir in a little heavy whipping cream after about an hour.  I don't think it was really necessary though because they were pretty creamy without it.  A great way to simplify my holiday meal.

This has become a staple for all holiday meals.  I like to use Yukon Golds, but that's just me.  This recipe is great as is and very easy to play around with.  I've tried different herbs (thyme, roasted garlic and/or rosemary are my favorites) and different cheeses, all of which were successful.  And the best part, you make them to the day before.  Thanx for posting this recipe!

While the recipe was simple to prepare and very flavorful, I found that even after adding some whipping cream before baking the potatoes were still very dry. I agree with previous reviews that this dish should be made within a few hours of serving and not allowed to refrigerate overnight. Great taste though!

These were fantastic!  I made them the day ahead for thanksgiving.  I only bought 6 gold yukon potatoes, and omitted the sour cream because I don't do a lot of dairy very well.  Regrigerated overnight and added fresh chopped chives and two cloves of bakes garlic which really made them zing.  I put them in a crock pot on high for a couple hours with butter on top and there were raves!

I absolutely love these mashed potatoes. I like to use purple mashed potatoes that I get at the Farmer's Market for some fun color. I also sprinkle in some fresh chives when they come out of the oven. So creamy and moist! I could eat them all by myself!

I personally was not too impressed with these potatoes cuz i like my potatoes roasted style. But i made them for the fam on thanksgiving (my first turkey day hosted at my house) and they ate em all up!! Did not recieve much ranting and raving like some of the other peps got but def a hit and very time saving!!! I changed a few things...added some gouda cheese turkey day morning just before i put em in the crockpot. very nice to not have to worry about them taking up your oven all day . I will make them again cuz my man loves mashed potatoes and these were just too easy!!!!!

Even after following advice from other reviewers to avoid overly dry potatoes, mine were still crumbly dry. I tried extra sour cream, adding cream through poked holes before baking, and adding pats of butter on top before baking. They tasted good, but the recipe was still too dry.

I made these the day before Thanksgiving.  Took them out of the fridge to get to room temp.  They were stiff and had to fluffed up with milk before brought to the table.  I will try them the same day next time.  *as stated by others)

Awesome and easy! I made the day before and put in a crock pot container and threw into the fridge (like another reviewer suggested). I then fired the crock pot up an hour or so before the turkey was ready, threw from butter on top, added a couple of chives, and waited for the goodness to heat up. Everyone loved the potatoes. EVERYONE! They said they tasted like a loaded baked potato. :)

These were good but could have been creamier.  Might have been my fault.  I used 6 pounds golden potatoes, 8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup sour cream and about a stick of butter.  I stored overnight in the fridge and heated in the crockpot the next day for about 3 hours.  I think I'll try again paying better attention to the proportions in the ingredients.

These potatoes were good. I did rewarn them in a crockpot with a half a stick of butter on top during the warming. Everybody loved them.

We didn't let these sit overnight as per instructions, just ate them like regular mashed potatoes.  VERY good, but definately needed more salt.  Could be a personal preference though.

This was delicious.  I made it for Thanksgiving and used the crock pot and it turned out great!  My husband said they were the best mashed potatoes he has ever had.  I added the cheese and crumbled bacon.

My family has declared this method of making mashed potatoes the best in the world. They claim they will never eat"regular" mashed potatoes again. It is a very delicious recipe and very convenient to be able to make it the day before. The only change I had to make was to reheat it a little longer on Thanksgiving Day to get them really hot again. This one is definitely staying in my recipe box

These were incredible!  I used fat free sour cream, regular cream cheese and added just a little fat free half & half because the potatoes were so thick.  They heated up in the oven nicely on the big day and I put them in a chaffing dish to keep warm.  There were the only thing I didn't have left over...:(.  Really, really good.  A keeper for next year, no doubt.

These mashed potatos were awesome! However I gave it 4 stars because I did not like the onion powder, and opted for garlic powder, and 2 crushed cloves of fresh garlic. Otherwise, its amazing!

Eh...they were OK, but not great. The next day I had to run them through my mixer to "break" them up so that they looked and felt like mashed potatoes. I also wasn't too keen on the cream cheese thing. I think they might be better without them. All in all, while the idea is good--the finished dish--not so good. Thanks though.

These potatoes are so delicious.  People always want to know what the secret ingredient is, the cream cheese makes this recipe.  I like making these potatoes at the holidays.  I am able to spend time making these the day before and spend time the next day on other dishes you can't make in advance.  Thanks!

These potatoes were delicious!  Very creamy, and also very easy.  The only problem with the directions was trying to drop the potatoes into the boiling water....be careful of splashing scalding water.  I think next time I'll add them to cold water and bring it all to a boil...

I gave it the best rating because not only was it tasty, it was so easy!  My husband thought it was very good.  I made it and divided it in half before baking it.  I gave one half to a neighbor who had broken his ankle, and we ate the other half. But, I will make it again and freeze half of it for another meal.  Versatile and delicious.  Thanks, Erin!

Nice and creamy, with just a bit of tang from the sour cream (which normally I don't like, but I did in this!)  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it could use a bit more spice. Next time I may try adding garlic powder or paprika? In general, though, great recipe.

Fabulous! These were a hit with everyone at Thanksgiving! My changes were to use garlic salt in place of regular and to add a littel parmesan cheese to the mix.  I also garnished with parsley and paprika. Thanks for the great recipe!

I ended up making these on Thanksgiving, instead of the day before, but it was nice to be able to make them ahead of schedule; and, thanks to previous reviewers' suggestions, put them in the crockpot to stay warm. I didn't use the onion powder, I added extra butter, but I did add milk as I always do to make them creamier. They were also delicious the day after. Good recipe for us, with my adjustments.

Tasted delicious.  I served with my T-giving meal.  They were a little thick and "heavy" to be served with the turkey according to one of my resident food critics, however, I will most likely make again, but, perhaps the same day instead of "day before" to see if it will make a difference.

so nice to prepare them the night before and bake them later, no more cold mashed potatoes! the only thing i tampered with was to cut back the salt and onion powder by half, it wasn't missed. such a great taste.

These were quite good.
I used about 14 potatoes to the recipe so we would have left overs.
They were light and fluffy & would make again.....

We made this for our dinner 1 week before Christmas. We all met early. Anyway, it was wonderful not to have to do mashed potatoes that day!!! And they tasted just as good and fluffy. I was worried about that!! But it turned out wonderful and yummy! 5 stars!!!! AWESOME taste!!!!!

These potatoes definitely require more than the 15 - 20 minutes to boil.  They were too al dente and did not beat well. I tried these as a time- saver for Thanksgiving.  Next year I will just make traditional mashed potatoes on the same day.

Although it was useful to have the potatoes already prepared for the next day, I think they would have been much better simply made fresh.  In addition I think the porportions of sour cream and cream cheese were a little heavy, I'd reduce them a little.

I made this and it was way to heavy for my taste.  I like light and fluffy but this was fattening just to look at!  I really miss the milk.

Great recipe and it's so easy.  I love the tang that the sour cream and cream cheese give to this dish.  These taste so good by themselves that I didn't want to top them with gravy or butter.  The only thing that I did differently was that instead of the seasonings called for in the recipe, I used Montreal Steak Seasoning.

This was very good, needed more salt and butter than it called for, but that could have been the size of the potatoes - I also added some milk and sauted garlic to it. All around very good recipe.

We LOVED these!  I'm testing recipes for the first family Easter at our place, and my search is done.  I did mix in a little milk before throwing these in the microwave to heat through the next day.  Creamy, and tasty.  One less thing for me the worry about 'the day of'.

Being able to make these ahead is a big help.  I thought they were a little bit on the dry side, so I added about a cup of buttermilk.  Also, instead of reheating in the oven, I put them in the microwave with the probe set to 160 degrees and heated at 50% power, stirring occasionally, until hot.  Overall, easy and tasted great.

These potatoes were "ok".  Nothing special.  The kids didn't like them.  They have a sour taste to them because of the sour cream.  They are very creamy, but bland.  I would not make them again.

I just made this dish for Thanksgiving today (11/27/03, and they came out really good.  I made one mistake - I over mixed them, and as we all know, when you over whip potatoes, they get glutinous.  So, to fix the problem, I took another recipe from Allrecipe.com and combined it with this one.  I beat a couple of eggs into the potatoe mixture, snipped a few fresh chives, and baked it at 350 degrees for about 1/2 hour.  They were the fluffiest most wonderful tasting potatoes we have ever had.  Everone was very impressed with them.  Even if I hadn't over-whipped the potatoes, the eggs would have made them better anyway!  I'm telling you - it sounds a little funky, but try it, it is worth it!

I have always hated when making holiday meals, the last minute preparation... you have to bake the rolls, slice the turkey, make the gravy... and mash the potatoes...not only does this recipe take out one last minute step from putting the meal on the table, the taste of these mashed potatoes is better than regular mashed potatoes.  My family has asked me to only make these mashed potatoes from now on.

I have to admit, with all the sour cream, cream cheese, and butter, I was expecting it to be WAY creamier or richer.  I love plain ol'mashed potatoes with butter and milk.  BUT, this is a great time saver to do day before.  I made a dinner for a friend who just had a baby and it was nice to be able to have it made and just tell her to throw it in the over 30 minutes before she was ready to eat with the meatloaf!

We brought this dish to a St. Patrick's Day party at a friend's house, and it was devoured by our Irish hosts. A perfect compliment to Irish Stew or Meatloaf. Will definitely make again.

I would give these potatoes an A+, however some of my guests thought there was too much sour cream.  The day after making them, I covered them and reheated in the microwave and didnt need to add any milk like some reviewers suggested. Just cover them so they do not lose the moisture and you should be fine.

Absolutely terrific!  I added a bit more butter on top before putting it in the oven (after all we weren't counting calories).  It caused the potato to brown very nicely!  Excellent taste!

Very Good. Followed Directions Pretty Closely Day 1. On Day two I put them in the oven for 15 minutes on 350 to warm up a little, and then I added about a cup of warm milk, more salt, and a tablespoon of butter or so. Then placed in 9x13 pan and put in oven another 20 minutes when I was ready. Recommended

Tried these the other night and they were a real hit. Didn't give them the time to sit for a day and very little left over for the next day. Great Mashed potatoes

The taste is good, but not great.  I will make again only if I need to bring to an event or before a big holiday when the kitchen is busy.  Fresh mashed are better, I think.

Great recipe for a potluck, since it can be made ahead.  I added bacon bits, and green onions.  I will use this recipe many times

I served this on Christmas Day and made it the day before.  The potatoes taste GREAT and it makes it so much easier to have them done ahead of time.  I just sprinkled a little paprika on them for color, other than that I didn't change anything.  I'll definitely be making these again!

I wasn't sure if these mashed potatoes would really come out creamy the next day but decided to try them anyway - I'm so glad I did.  They were so creamy & flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly (which I don't often do!) & they were wonderful!  I can't thank you enough for providing such a convenient & tasty way to make potatoes!

My family loves this recipe.  I always send home a copy of it with guests.  Never again will I make mashed potatoes at the last minute.  However, some of my family doesn't like as much sour cream as the recipe calls for, but I do.

These potatoes were SO creamy and SO good!

It's a great dish to bring to someone else's house - they heat up well in the oven!

My whole family loved these potatoes..
My mother said they were the best she's ever tasted, and has already requested them for holiday gatherings.
