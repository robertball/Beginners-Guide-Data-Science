kids enjoyed this with the strawberry jam we just canned.  Thank you for idea, wouldn't have thought to add maple syrup to a wrap, but made for a tasty, quick breakfast on the go.

syrup was a grossly rich ingredient.  I would have been better off making a peanut butter and jelly roll-up.

These were ok.  My kids didn't much care for them.  I tried one with orange marmalade and another with strawberry preserves. Not bad, but not a favorite.

I let these sit for the several hours and they still didn't turn into much other than a tortilla with jam and syrup on it. Not awful but not anything great either even the kids didn't much care for it.
