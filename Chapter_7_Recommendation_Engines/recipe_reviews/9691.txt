These cookies are not overly sweet, which is perfect for my family.  Not one cookie made it to the cookie jar.  I will have to make a double batch next time.  Light, cake-like texture.  The only change I made is that I did not grease the cookie sheet.  I listened to my great-grandmother ("It's a poor cookie that doesn't grease it's own sheet!").  I have never greased a cookie sheet in my life.  The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is that it wasn't "Shockingly Amazing!"  Yes, I will make them again and soon.

Loved this recipe! These cookies were perfect for the after dinner sweet tooth  because they were light enough yet sweet enough to get that craving!
Cheers!

These are my husbands favorite! He dosen't like cookies to sweet. They are very good.When the icing is added it makes them sweeter to satisfy my sweet tooth :-)

These cookies are great!  Absolutely perfect to serve with coffee or tea.  They just have a hint of sweetness and have a nice cakey texture but are still quite sturdy and hold together.  I used light sour cream and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  I think any spice would be really great, next time I'll add more cinnamon or maybe try the nutmeg also.  Great little cookies and super easy recipe!  A recipe I'll definitely make again and again.

These just didn't turn out well. They'll get eaten though...but I don't think I'll make them again - tasteless, formless and the dough was just too much like cake dough - very runny. The dough also discolored between baking batches.

This recipe makes cake-like cookies.  They are similar to sugar cookies in their flavor.  We did not eat them as dessert, but instead enjoyed them as a snack or with tea/coffee.  They have a delicate flavor that I enjoy.  On a few of them I placed a few chocolate chips prior to baking.

Not much flavor and a cake like texture-even with the icing, the cookie did not taste very good.

I don't think everyone would like these but my husband and I do!  They are like fluffy vanilla wafers. If you think that sounds good then you will probably like them too.

My cookies turned out monster size, but they were so good and moist.  I loved them also because they just hit the spot, sweet, but not too sweet!

Exactly what I want in a sugar cookie! I especially like the fact that the butter is melted. Too often I get the urge for a sugar cookie and I just don't want to wait for the butter to soften properly. I've made them several times.

I did not like these at all.  My husband said that they were okay. They were too spongy and had a weird flavor.

I thought it was just okay. My guest made a point of telling me they didn't care for this cookie at all.

This reciepe was very bad.  2 cups of sour cream is way too much and the cookies could not be rolled out.

For those who like a cake-like, soft cookie.  I added a cup of chocolate chips and frosted them with chocolate frosting.  Very good!

Soft, cake-like and moist. Not too sweet and very mild flavor. My kids didn't like them at all.
