Definitely not my favorite potato recipe.  I used red potatoes and yellow onion since that was what I had on hand but followed the spices, oil and vinegar exactly.  The potatoes just didn't have enough flavor so I had to add a lot of salt.  Otherwise it just tasted like bland potatoes.  Maybe a balsamic vinegar reduction would be better?  Regardless, this recipe needs a little "jazz-ing" up to make it work. UPDATE 06/18/12  After the potatoes cooled down about a day, they did seem to have pretty good flavor though the balsamic is still not very prominent.  I still suggest using a balsamic reduction to really glaze the potatoes.

Delicious!  We cooked the potato mixture on the grill, which added a really nice flavor to an already tasty dish.  We will make this again.

Very good!  Will definitely make again.  Used regular button mushrooms and an extra piece of bacon.  I wouldn't call this a "salad" at all, but still- pretty darn good!

I always hate those review were people totally changed the recipe....
I'm sure would be good as written, but I didn't have any regular potatoes, green onions, bacon, or mushrooms.
I made it with sweet potatoes, using the dressing recipe (only omitted the paprika), subbed green peppers for the mushrooms, and omitted the green onions and bacon. Turned out really well..... will try to make according to the recipe next time.

Best potato salad I've ever had.  

For me, it comes off the foil better if the foil is sprayed beforehand with olive oil PAM.

Was a disaster! Put the mixture in the oven for 30 min and they came out burnt and inetable. Will never make this again.
