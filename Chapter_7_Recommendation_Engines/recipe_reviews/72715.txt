NO NEED FOR KETCHUP OR MUSTARD HERE! BURGERS POP WITH FLAVOR! DON'T TRY IT WITHOUT REAL CHOPPED ONION BITS, BECAUSE YOU'RE MISSING OUT!

This recipe tastes absolutely amazing and juicy even with extra lean ground beef, but I suggest some minor modifications. 

1) I recommend using double the amount of ranch suggested in this recipe. Others have noted and I have found as well that it is difficult to taste without adding alot more.

2) Don't use as much crackers, just buy leaner beef. The crackers are just filler and detract from the recipe and tend to dry out the meat. I suggest using about 1/2 to 3/4 of the suggested amount of saltines.

I LOVE good burgers!!!I made these a few weeks ago and we love them! I did change a few things. Just two of us so I used 1 pound of burger and made two BIG burgers! I used a whole pack of Ranch dressing mix and instead of raw onion I used 1/2 pack of onion soup mix. I used Italian bread crumbs in place of cracker crumbs. Very much full of flavor and moist. I made it in the morning and grilled for dinner. The flavor really goes thru.
I made a batch this morning and cant wait for dinner tonight!
This is a keeper for us!

I did not like this recipe at all.  I think one of the previous reviews was correct.  It tasted like meatloaf.  With all of those crackers I did not taste the ranch at all.  Next time I will make them with just the meat and the ranch seasoning.  I am sure that this would be a better combination.

Leave out the crackers and egg and just add onion soup mix with the ranch package.  To die for hamburgers...Used my mother-in-laws homemade barbeque sauce. Smells wonderful while cooking.  Hubby took to work and everyone wanted to sample.

Original review--April 24, 2009: Pretty good. I used the Dry Ranch Dressing mix from this site (minus the salt and adding dill) and crushed Ritz crackers instead of saltines. I served them up with a nice sharp cheddar and slices of tomato. EDITED: These are NOT gross. I make these at least once every couple months in a variety of ways. One of my favorite ways to make it is serve it with a doctored up cream-of-mushroom soup gravy and fluffy mashed potatoes. My family LOVES it. This also works with ground turkey or ground chicken. I highly suggest making your own homemade ranch dressing mix if you can. It makes it SO much better.

I made these for dinner tonight, and my family ended up eating cereal.  These burgers were not good at all and we threw them away.  They tasted liked mushy meatloaf on a bun.   My husband couldn't even finish his, which never happens.  Sorry, but I don't understand the high scores this recipe got.

Great burgers!  After going through the reviews - use 1 oz. dry ranch mix for every pound of ground beef.  I used 1 lb. of 85/15 ground beef and added 1 tsp. of dried minced onion and 1/2 tsp. of onion powder.  There really was no need for the egg or cracker/bread crumbs.  These came out very moist.  Next time I will reserve a little of the dry ranch mix and add it to some mayo for a topping.

One of the best burger recipes I have found to date.  I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines...all I had on hand.  The burgers came out moist and had tons of flavor...you don't even need condiments for this...leave the meat alone.  We added some bacon and the cheese of our choice....and wow.  Will definately make this one again. Thanks for the post.

I usually read reviews & decide whether to add other things but couldn't since I'm first to review this one!  Glad I followed this one exactly.  BEST JUICIEST burger I've EVER had, and I tend to overcook mine on the grill -- STILL juicy!  Will definitely look up other 'DamiansMommy' recipes!

I highly recommend this recipe.  I typically don't like hamburgers but we've made this several times now.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers.  You'll get a moist and juicy hamburger with this recipe.

Even my kids love this burger and they hate burger nights.  I substituted panko bread crumbs for the saltines to cut the sodium content.  Super moist and just right!

I am not a huge burger fan but these were AWESOME! I used the townhouse crackers instead of saltine crackers and i also only used 1lb of ground beef with the entire ranch dressing packet. The inside of the burger was so light and fluffy i loved the texture.

These came out great on a Foreman grill! Followed the recipe exactly, except used like 1/2c of bread crumbs instead of crackers.  Best Valentine's day ever :D

These burgers were delicious! I used 3 pounds of ground beef and used the equivalent of 3 packages of ranch seasoning ( I have a large container of it that I purchased). I added a little worsterchire sauce, 2 eggs, one onion, but no crackers. They came out moist and delicious and did not fall apart. Oh and I used sharp cheddar on top of some and chipotle pepper cheese on the others...yum!

I made these as meatballs instead of burgers, with several changes: Used 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines (don't buy them), and two packages of ranch dressing mix.  Cooked meatballs in the oven, drained fat, combined with jarred spaghetti sauce, and served over pasta with salad and french bread.  Very good!   Update:  I've used this meat mixture for hamburgers, meatballs, and even meatloaf, always using the ranch dressing mix and seasoned bread crumbs.  The meat mixture is delicious, and despite the rude comment from "Flo", I still rate the recipe 5 stars because the flavor of the meat mixture is excellent!

This was a good burger, but the ranch dressing flavor needed to be a little stronger. My son grilled them for 4 minutes on one side, flipped them, and then grilled them another 4 minutes. Perfectly done and moist.

Using ranch mix in burgers is a terrific idea - the flavors are perfectly complementary with whatever ground meat and condiments you're using. Unfortunately the addition of the saltines and egg is a little overkill, so I had to rate this only 4 stars. I've made this multiple times now and usually use one whole packet of ranch mix to 1 1/4 pounds of ground turkey, half of an onion (well-minced), and about a quarter cup of dry bread crumbs. Comes out great every time!

This is absolutely the best burger recipe I've ever tasted and wonder what people did wrong to have such bad experiences.  The only change I make is a few less crackers, and minced onion instead of real onion (to fool my children), but otherwise they are absolutely the best.  Have occasionally substituted onion soup mix, but they're just not the best.  RANCH BURGERS are a regular staple in my family's dinner rotation, and are often requested when we go to cook-outs.

Like other said, it taste more like a meatloaf with the egg and cracker. I did add cracker to hold it together but left out the egg. Added lil montrel steak sauce too. I like the flavor of ranch in it as well.

Just another meatloaf recipe as written. I would try eliminating the egg and crackers; perhaps doubling the ranch dressing? We could barely taste it. May try this again. Thanks.

Great Recipe!  I used "ritz" crackers instead of saltines(the buttery flavor went well with the ranch flavor), and dried minced onion instead of fresh(use less if you do this, the dried is more potent than the fresh).  It's pretty cold here right now, definatly not grill season, so I cooked them under the broiler for 15 minutes on each side.  The burgers were cooked all the way through but still juicy.  Excellent!

These are a keeper! I didn't feel like crushing up crackers, so I used unseasoned bread crumbs instead. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is really good however I did make some changes.  Instead of saltines I used italian style bread crumbs and I added a bit of garlic, pepper and worcesteshire sauce to the meat mixture.  These were fantastic.  Nice and juicy!  We will be making these again!

These were excellent.  I used bread crumbs instead of saltines because I can't get them where I live (I know, right??).  I didn't have nice fresh, soft buns so I decided to make mini burgers and put them on refrigerator biscuits.  I topped them with bacon and gouda cheese.  Awesome! Will definitely make again.

These were good!  I used mixed turkey this time.  Usually I go for only white meat.  Mixed was on sale.  :)  I used a pound of turkey & one package of ranch mixed with two tablespoons plain bread crumbs.  'Made five burgers.  Really good.  Really.  You should try these.  Don't let the simplicity fool you.

These taste good, but more like meatloaf than hamburgers.  I think next time I will forget teh egg and crackers and just add onion and ranch packet.

I am giving this recipe three stars because it is a great starter recipe. Unfortunately, I read the reviews and found out that the burgers fall apart. This is where I started tweeking the recipe. First off, I only used 1 lb. of ground chuck. To that, I added 1 whole package of ranch dressing mix, 1 egg, 3/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs, and 1/2 package of dry onion soup mix. I ended up with 4 small burgers that did not fall apart. We topped them with mayo/miracle whip, lettuce, tomato, and onion, and served them with a side of bacon cheese fries (recipe is from AR). They ended up being a good dinner. I will definitely make these again. Thanks!

These were wonderful!  I did not have to put any toppings on my bun with this burger.  I did follow some other peoples advice, and used 2 packs of ranch dressing instead of one, and refrigerated the burgers for a little bit while the grill was heating up, but other than that followed the recipe exactly! This is my favorite burger recipe now!

These are very tasty and fragrant burgers.  Super easy to make... I would not sub bread crumbs for saltine crackers again.  My bad, but I didn't have any saltines.  I think the saltines would keep them more meaty, and the bread crumbs I had to do made my burgers a little too much like a meat loaf.  ~  My man LOVED these - I made extras so he could take some for his lunches.

Excellent recipe!  However, I agree with many others in doubling the Ranch Dressing otherwise you won't taste it.  Trust me, I've made it both ways, and doubling is the way to go.  Also, cut down on the crackers (maybe 1/2 of what the recipe calls for) or you'll end up with texture like meatloaf.  Use half the crackers and you will get a moist, juicy burger that doesn't taste "mushy".

These are AWESOME!!!  I sauteed the onion with a little minced garlic just until tender.  That added an amazing flavor.  I also took advice of other reviewers and added a little extra Ranch.  A definite repeat!!  Made Sunday for Father's Day and plan on making again tonight or tomorrow for dinner...

This was wonderful. It will be repeated. I do agree that it needs more ranch mix than what is suggested, but that is a matter of personal taste. I used part panko bread crumbs because I was short on saltines, and it added a nice touch.

Was worried that the saltines would give the patties a meat loafy texture, but they didn't at all. With a dribble of Ranch dressing plus the usual lettuce, tomato and onion, these were some dang good burgers. Thanks!

These burgers were good, but as the other reviewers noted, we did not taste the ranch at all.
I used 2 packs of the ranch and only 1/4 cup of the crushed crackers.  We also cooked them in the oven instead of the grill.  They burgers were moist and tasty... but I wouldn't call it a ranch burger.  I believe part of the problem is that using a whole chopped onion is too much.  I loooove onions, but I think the flavor of the onion is partially responsible for us not being able to taste the ranch.  Next time, I plan on using 3 packs of ranch, and only half of a small onion.

Great burgers!  Not mushy at all.  I made exactly as written and loved that there was a good flavor to the burgers but I didn't taste the processed flavor of the ranch packet.  I, personally, think that messing with that ingredient and adding more would mess up the balance of the burger.  I got what I was looking for....flavor enhancement but not overpowering ranch taste.  Thanks!

Made good, juicy burgers on the BBQ.  I sprinkled the patties with Montreal Steak Spice.  Served on buns with lettuce, tomato, and fried onions. Spread some ranch dressing on the buns as well.  Next time I am going to splurge and add a strip of bacon to each burger!

Sorry, but I made this tonight and my hubby (who eats anything and everything) even commented on how blah they were.  The ranch dressing was virtually undetectable.  This was disappointing.  The crackers were just added filler and calories and did nothing to enhance this at all.

This was a great hit at our weekly bbq!! It stayed juicy even though my husband tends to overcook meat. I left out the onion and sauteed it instead. We had it with avodaco, lettuce, tomato, sauteed onion, sauteed mushroom with cheddar or swiss cheese. I will absolutely make this again!

Loved it.Only used half an onion since I'm not a huge fan. Used Italian bread crumbs in the place of crackers & tossed in some real bacon crumbles. Patties were so full of flavor & juicy.

My husband is nothing if not a cheese burger man.  He eats them several times a week and I am always looking for new ways to prepare them.  This recipe gets 5 stars from my husband and 5 stars for me for finding the recipe!  He LOVED them.  Told me they were by FAR the best burgers he has EVER tasted!  He told me to NEVER loose this recipe!  I had enough for two that I froze so that he can have them some night when I have MY favorite...anything chicken!  :)

We really liked this.  The edges did burn on the grill but I think that was my fault for not blending the ingredients enough.  Mix well!

As a Man (LOL) I decided to throw these on the grill... HUGE SUCCESS... made me think of it more like a grilled meatloaf than a burger... Spread some ketchup over it and it was gone...

Most of my family did not care for this at all, including me.  We took advice of others and left out the bread and egg as several people said it reminded them of meatloaf.  It was WAY TOO SALTY!!!

Loved these.  My son, who is 4 and lives off of chicken nuggets and ketchup, ate this up as if his life depended on it; and then asked for a second one.  I made only 4 burgers, so 1 lb. of ground chuck (this has more flavor than the lean) one egg, one whole packet of ranch dressing mix and only 4 saltines crushed.  The Burgers were juicy, and you could definitly taste the ranch, but it wasn't overpowering.  Finished them off with some sharp cheddar and they were delicious.  I will definitely make these again.

More stars for sure! My husband snuck back into the kitchen to get a peice of the third burger and did not want to get caught.  Haha.  Very nice recipe.  I did not use the cracker crumbs as well and kept everything else the same.  I broiled in the oven and loved 5 minutes each side at 400 degrees.  Cooked another 4 minutes for him and he says they were equaly great.  Wanted to freeze a few but they will be gone tomorrow :)

As I was cooking this recipe I was getting irritated, as the burgers were just falling apart.  They didn't look good.  However when  I tasted tem the appearance didn't matter!!!  SOOO good!!!  I have to say it tho.....if you don't like meat loaf......you won't like these burgers.

I am in agreement with a number of the other reviewers; this recipe needs modification.  I found the burgers to be a bit bland.  Once realized I did crust with some Montreal seasoning.  I also thought the ranch taste was too light with just one pack.  I did go cheap and use the generic vs. hidden valley.  I did two batches, one with saltines and one with seasoned bread crumbs.  The breading taste and texture was too much.

These are our new burgers of choice. When we make home burgers, we always make a variation of Ranch Burgers. Here is what we like: Ground Turkey instead of beef, Bread crumbs instead of crackers, Eggs to help them hold together and some worsteshire sauce to taste. These make the moistest turkey burger you won't believe that they are turkey.

These were awesome! I made these last minute when I found out my in-laws were coming over for dinner. They all raved about it! I think I even forgot to add the crackers and they still turned out great!

Wow! This was a good recipe. I changed it a little bit. I used 3 lbs beef, 2 pkgs of Ranch Mix and combined saltines and cheese crackers to make 1 cup. My husband said it's great when you have a burger that doesn't require any condiments, it's great on it's own. I will definitely be making this one again!

Excellent. My new favorite burger ingredient is a packet of ranch! I only had 1 lb. of burger though, so I used a whole packet with it, omitted the egg, and added some garlic powder, pepper, and liquid smoke. I didn't even have cheese on miy burger (I'm dieting) and it was awesome! Will make again!

These burgers are,  BY FAR, the easiest and most juicy burgers I've ever had!  I've added different things to the mix depending on what I'm in the mood for (minced garlic, crumbled bacon, red pepper flakes) and every time, they have come out perfectly!  The great thing about these is that you can make 3 lbs. worth, form them into patties and freeze them.  Just make sure you freeze them on a cookie sheet and then bag them up.  If they're frozen individually, all you have to do is take one out and fry it up for lunch or dinner.  Great for those folks who only need to cook for one or two.

Hubby didn't care for these as much as I thought he would.  I did use two ounces of the Ranch dressing mix, two eggs,  seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines, dried onion & two teaspoons of Worchestire.  He said they were falling apart on the grill.

I was making this recipe for 4 people, so I scaled the meat back to 1.3 lbs, but still used an entire package of ranch mix, and next time I will use even more ranch mix.  To this recipe I omitted the saltine crackers, and I added ½ cup cheddar cheese, ½ cup bacon bits, Lawry’s seasoning, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Tabasco sauce. We also added extra cheese on top. They were delicious!

Great!  I took the advice of others and used twice as much Ranch mix.  I made one pound of meat and used the entire package of the Ranch mix.  I also mixed up the egg in a bowl and just put about half of that in the mix.  No saltines so I used Panko bread crumbs.  Made them on my Cusinart indoor grill and put bacon on top of my husbands before lowering grill - he loved the burger and it was a hit with myself and 12 year old son as well. Thanks

Very good! 
I did change two things though: 1) I coated the outside of the burger in peppercorn seasoning and 2) I used twice the amount of ranch that was called for in the recipe.

I've made these two times already and I'm making them again today.  They're perfect, just as the recipe is written.  The 2nd time I made them I didn't have enough dry ranch, so I substituted dry onion soup mix and it worked well. I've also sauteed the onions before hand, which just gives it a different flavor.  REALLY GREAT recipe - thanks!

We used this recipe for a picnic. Everyone loved them. I took a leftover burger with me for lunch the next day, and everyone there wanted to know what I was heating that smelled so great...(and I NEVER eat reheated hamburgers). These were excellent.

This was simply AWFUL!! The burger completely fell apart and it had no real ranch taste. My husband ate his but asked me to go back to buying frozen patties (he eats everything so I would take that as a huge thumbs down from him if he would rather have frozen)What a disappointment.

I followed the recipe's measurements for 4 people.  We couldn't really taste the ranch dressing mix, though the burgers were very moist and tasty.  If I make it again I'll use the entire packet of dressing mix.

This recipe was very good, though after reading through several comments I did make some adjustments before trying it out, such as: 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, 1/4 cup plain bread crumbs, 1/2 small/medium onion. Thankfully it came out very delicious and moist with those changes. Thank you for such a yummy recipe and thank you to those who left such helpful comments :).

These were suprisingly good.  My kids even commented about what a great burger it was.  I served them on fresh baked hamburger buns from Publix bakery, sauteed mushrooms and onions, muenster cheese and fresh tomato slices.  My family called them "gourmet burgers."

Did have a bit of a meatloafy texture, but that was a  bonus for us.  Have also made it without the crackers, and then its just like a well-spiced burger.  I always add extra ranch seasoning, since we like ranch, and we like our burgers seasoned well.

Good flavor, but if you have kids they might not enjoy the obvious chunks of onion in the meat.  The ranch flavor didn't come out that well but you cover it with ketchup and mustard anyway, right?

Great burger! Pretty much followed the recipe except I cut down the crushed crackers to 1/2 cup.  Very tasty.  Oh and I used a spicy ranch dressing mix.  Gave it a nice subtle kick to the burgers.  Very easy to make.

Good burger. I added a little garlic powder and black pepper and it was the business after that. Many people asked about the burgers and wondered what I had used.

This is one of the few things my husband cooks and it's because it's so easy and so flavorful! We sometimes use ground turkey instead of ground beef and it turns out just as fabulous! Oh yeah, and he dumps the entire bottle of Hormel Real Bacon Bits into the mix!

A simple & great recipe.  The ranch taste isn't overbearing and adding a packet of onion soup mix enhances all the flavors. Makes for a great weeknight meal.  I cooked mine stovetop, but I can't wait to try these on grill!!

Well I didn't make these burgers like the recipe said, I made them from reading reviews and someone suggested that all you needed was a packet of ranch seasoning and a packet of onion soup mix. They were so salty I couldn't even finish one. Maybe if I had made them like the recipe said they would be better but I'm not taking the chance.

Pretty good.Not the best ever.It does taste a little like meat loaf as others stated(no disrespect to meat loaf but I wanted a burger. )Everyone ate it without a complaint(or compliment).I probably won't make this again.The ranch mix made these a little salty as well.

I was concerned these would come out like mini-meatloaves, but they didn't and we were very happy with these burgers.  We doubled the recipe and froze the leftovers.  Good stuff.

used Ritz instead of saltines and added a little addn'l Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper, but other than that followed as stated. was very good and very moist, though I agree with others- might be a little more of a meatloaf... regardless- very good, and will make again!

Yesterday was Memorial Day and whats Memorial Day without burgers, steaks, you know the deal.  Well, I'd seen a recipe on the back of a Hidden Valley Ranch pkg for quite some time but never tried it. I did, however, find this on my favorite recipe--and the only 1 I use by the way--site, All-recipes.  Well gang, its WONDERFUL!!! I've no clue why there are 1 & 2-stars ratings..THIS IS A 5* without a doubt!  Everyone here for TWO DAYS of cooking out LOVED IT!  I didn't have saltines but all else went in.  IT WAS AWESOME and frankly, there will never be a "regular" burger ever again that hits my grill or frying pan!  Try it y'all; you WILL NOT be disappointed!  Thanks for sharing hun

I have been wanting to make this for a while. I could not figure out at first which ranch packet to get because there were different kinds (season, dip, buttermilk ranch,etc) so I chose seasoning. Normally I eat turkey burgers but this sounded good and the reviewers had all made positive comments on it. I used 1.7 lbs beef ground chuck and let all the ingredients marry for a while. It did not take too long to grill. I put tomato and lettuce, no other dressing. This was sooo yummy, tasty, juicy and full of enough flavor. I made oven seasoned potato wedges. this was a delish meal. worth making again and again (maybe with turkey burger)!!

These burgers were very tasty, and I am not a huge fan of burgers in general. As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the amount of ranch, but that was the only change that I made.

These were very flavorful.  I had a slight issue with a few of them falling apart when I flipped them.  That could be because I didn't oil the grill (always follow the directions).  However, as flavorful as they were as hamburgers, I think they would be even better as a meatloaf.  That is the texture and consistency they reminded me of.  Overall, good flavor.

Substituted the ground beef for ground turkey, it came out very moist.  Everyone enjoyed these turkey ranch burgers.  Will definitely make again.

yummy. My husband and I loved these. They have such a great flavor and really juicy. I didn't follow the recipe. I just mixed 1 pound of beef with 1 packet of hidden vally ranch. Very good. Will probably make once a week.

Again another stellar recipe.  You have a choice when using fresh extra lean ground beef or spend a bit more and use fresh ground bison.  The bun is what finishes this burger off.  I personally do not use the regular buns.  I prefer a bagette cut diagonally.  I will use a Monteray Jack Cheese  or swiss to give it a kick.    The Hidden Valley Ranch packaged dressing worked well.   We had 20 people over for the BBQ and everybody loved this recipe.  DO NOT OVER COOK the burger.  Keep it moist.

I changed out the ground beef for turkey and couldn't tell a difference in taste.  I did have a problem with the patties falling apart on the grill.  Serve with avocado slices.

"WOW YUMMM!" exact words of my 11 yr old boy.  I made this with ground veal due to what I had on hand. I also only had  just over one pound but I still used the full pack of ranch dressing mix. I followed the rest exactly except for adding a bit of flavour with a dash of worcestorshire sauce. Served on kaiser rolls with mayo, ketchup lettuce and tomato. YUmmm!! Sooo goood! thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

We substituted saltines for breadcrumbs and that helped, but the ranch packet makes it waaaay salty! Not the authors fault, it's just to much salt in the seasoning packet. Otherwise the ranch flavor was yummy.

Use 2 packages dressing mix make sure onion is very finely chopped add 1 tablespoom worcestershire and these will turn out very good, I also used ground chuck more flavor, I usually don't like to redo a recipe but this one was not worth fixing again.

These were pretty good burgers.  I would suggest using less crackers if you get lean ground beef or like myself have a 50/50 mix of ground beef and venison.  You really have to try and taste the ranch so maybe adding more could help or I think with less crackers it may pop a little more.    Whenever I make burgers I usually saute onion in butter for them so when I saw this recipe I wanted to make one change.  After I put them on the grill, I put a little dab or butter on each patty and it really brought out the flavor in the onion.  All in all good but I think depending on your meat and methods, some minor changes could be in order.  For some of you saying there was way too many crackers, do note this recipe is for 2lbs. or burger and not one.  Just thought it may have slipped by ya.

I did not like these burgers. They were mushy and lacked flavor. I didnt read some of the previous reviews before, but I think if I had added more ranch and crumbs, it would have tasted just like meatloaf. I will not be making again.

I followed the recipe exactly but wouldn't go to the trouble of making again.  They didn't taste bad, but it really was like having meatloaf patties.  I think I might even try baking it in a loaf.  The ranch is a tasty addition.

Wow!  So good.  I was looking for a different taste for our burgers and came across this recipe.  I followed other suggestions and left out the crackers & egg.  I used a pound of ground beef, one packet of ranch mix and a chopped onion.  It's just unbelieveable that just two ingredients can make wonderful tasting bugers!

Flavor is great.   The proportion of crackers (or bread crumbs, whichever you have no hand to use) led to a texture more reflective of meatloaf than a burger.  Will leave breadcrumbs/egg out going forward and leave it as a true traditional burger.  Overall enjoyable.  As you can see in attached photo, made it a Bacon Ranch Avocado burger, using mayo on one bun and thousand island dressing on the other.

Yummy, juicy burgers!  I split this recipe in half because I only had 1 pound of ground beef.  Prepared with plain breadcrumbs instead of saltine crackers.  Would recommend sauteing onions before mixing into the meat.  Cooked on my stove top.

Had a cookout for six yesterday and wanted something different to do with burgers. This was awesome and very well received. I used 2 1/2 pounds of Extra lean Ground Beef, a pkg of the Ranch Dressing Mix, 2 eggs, Italian Bread Crumbs and dried minced onion. I made the patty's and let them sit in the fridge a few hours. We had cheese, spinach, sauted onion and peppers and tomatoes for those that wanted it for garnish. I did the cheese and spinch and it just added the extra little something.   I will definitely make this again whether just for us or for company.

My friend fixed these for us and we loved them! The first time I tried this recipe on my own, I used the entire ranch packet and it was way too salty. The next time, I used 1/2 packet of the dry ranch, and 1/3 of the onions and about 8 crackers--and these are the best burgers ever! My husband wants these weekly. Great moisture, great flavor, delicious!

This was a very good burger. My Fiancé LOVED IT!!! I made it two nights in a row and I didn't grill them I just cooked them on the stovetop. Like some of the other review's you can't really taste the ranch so I doubled it and instead of crackers I used  Italian Style bread crumbs. It was juicy and full of flavor. So I think I will make my burgers like this for now on....until I'll find another way to do them. : )

these were excellent. The crakers made them sorta light and airy. I do think I may cut the crackers in half next time or better yet use ranch doritos. I mixed everything in the night before, the flavors absorbed really nicely. Next time I will add another package of ranch mix and see what that does for it.

Used two packs of Ranch on 2 1/2 lbs ground chunk and omitted the crackers.  Another reviewer was right...these were good without crackers.  Will be using Ranch in burgers from now on. Lastly...cooked inside on stove as it was raining hard outside...still great!

I don't know what I did, but this turned into hamburger flop. The meat didn't stay together so I just cut it up with my spatula like I was browning the hamburger. I gave it two stars cause hubby thought it was good. I did not care for it.

Thes are impressive burgers for sure. I wasn't expecting that much from this and thought what the heck, there's always leftover pizza if I mess up... I just put ketchup, lettuce, and a slice of american cheese on mine and these are so good they don't really need the condiments and toppings. I was out of saltines so I used Ritz crackers and dried onion 2 T plus 1/2 tsp onion powder to compensate for not using fresh. I just didn't feel like chopping. The smoky flavor from the grill was perfect too! I can't imagine trying these on a george foreman though or stovetop as they would lose that flame broiled taste. Hubby agreed these are definitely a keeper!

This recipe as-is makes great burgers.  If I want to add a little something extra to an already delicious burger, I'll throw in some shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled up cooked bacon...YUMMMMM!!  We usually put prepared ranch dressing and bacon on the buns, too.  These burgers always get gobbled up.

These were pretty good.  I think maybe it could have used a bit more ranch seasoning and I only used 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef.  Mine were a bit dry but I am certain it was because I left out the onions since I can't stand them.  For those whose were mushy like meatloaf, you are probably overmixing them.  I mixed the saltines with the ranch to help the mixing go a little faster.  The burgers held up well on the grill, they didn't fall apart, and they weren't charred becuase of all the grease dripping from them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Meatloaf burger.  Even after following suggestions by doubling ranch, omitting egg, halfing bread crumbs... still meatloaf.  Very sad - I had high hopes for this one.

Very easy and pretty tasty. I used 1.25 lbs ground beef, 1 whole packet of ranch, 1 envelope onion soup,skipped the crackers and egg, and Cooked on the George Foreman grill. Tasty burgers! Quick and easy to prepare after work. Next I will try them barbecued.

I didn't like these very much. they weren't horrible but i think the crackers make it like a meat loaf instead of a burger. I didn't use a outside grill, but instead used a grill top for my stove (apartment living). Im not sure if that had anything to do with it...

Very good burger!!  I used plain breadcrumbs and skipped the onions since my hubby doesn't like them.  I think it would have been great with them!!  Very moist burger and refreshing change from just a plain burger.

These were pretty good, but I almost wonder if they would have been better w/out the egg and saltines (I actually used breadcrumbs instead). I might try it just sprinkling some ranch in with the ground beef before making the patties. The egg gave it more of a meatloaf texture than I liked. Good flavor though, nice idea!

These are absolutely the best burgers I have ever made. They are perfectly juicy and need no topping whatsoever. I did as others suggested and added seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crackers I also added  2 tsp worcestershire sauce. To DIE for.

Definitely an awesome burger.  Very juicy and I didn't even put them on the grill. I cooked on the stovetop. I did take one reveiewers suggestions and used the bread crumbs instead of crackers.  Thanks for sharing it is truly a good burger.  I will have to try the other burger recipe for Juiciest Burger ever and see how it compares.

These smelled great while cooking on the grill, but the flavor wasnt as good as I expected.  The burger seemed too dry.  May try again, but add a little ground pork with the beef.

Tried this recipe for a BBQ with 12 members of my family and only one person commented on how good the burger was...everyone else just ate it and  went on with their conversations...sorry tto inform you but it was not a hit at my BBQ party.  I did it as per the recipe and as others have said in their review, it was too dry...will not make it again :-(.

Couldn't agree that these were good.  They tasted like meatloafs on a hamburger roll.  Burgers should not have egg and bread crumbs in them.
Will delete this one from the recipe box

Awsome burgers!!  Made this the other day when it was warm out, and it was great, they didn't fall apart, and they were juicy!  My husband and son really enjoyed them.  They are certainly better than the frozen patties anytime.
This will become part of our summer menu!  (And anytime during the year when we want a great tasting burger!)
Thanks so much for the recipe!

It was very juicy and tasty.  I cooked in on my George Foreman and used Ritz instead of saltines.  The problem I had was that I really couldn't taste the ranch very well.  I like my burgers very seasoned.  But, still quite good.  I will make it again.

I halved this recipe except for the ranch packet and egg. I used the entire packet for 1 pound of meat, about 1/4 cup finely crushed crackers and chose not to use the onions. My husband and children loved the ranch flavor and the burgers were very juicy. Will definitely use this recipe again and again.

Since we first tried this Ranch burger recipe, my family requests it by name!! We are having company for dinner tomorrow and I promised the best burgers they have ever eaten in their lives. I am planning on cutting up small pieces of mild cheddar cheese and mixing it with the meat to give it a twist. Thanks for a great simple recipe.

very tasty.  If you are not an onion fanatic, maybe saute the onion ahead of time before adding to meat.  My meat was very lean and there wasn't a lot of grease flowing to help soften the onion and they were a little raw for me.  Very good all around. (although high in sodium)

The best burguers EVER!!! My husband is not much of a burguer lover, but he loved this ones, he asked for doubles, and my kids (ages 3 and 2), just loved them, and asked me if they could have them again tomorrow. Thank you very much for this recipe, and it sure is a keeper!

I love these burgers! They’re awesome exactly as written but I do prefer to double the ranch dip for a little more flavor. That’s simply personal preference. Thank you for a great recipe!!

We tried this today and thought it was very good.  As others suggested, I used 2 envelopes of Ranch dressing seasoning, and kept the egg and onion, but reduced the crackers to a little over 1/4 cup. I made this in a grill pan and it was flavorful and moist. I will make again!

I modified this recipe a bit. I substituted the saltines for original bread crumbs. I added shredded cheese into the mix and added 2 tbs of Worcestershire sauce. Next time I will use 1 1/2 ranch packets instead of one.

Honestly the best burger I have ever eaten. I used plain bread crumbs rather than saltines and made it less than 3/4 cup, maybe 1/2 cup or a little less. Sooo juicy and flavorful right on the stovetop. Added some applewood smoked bacon, jalapeno Havarti, romaine lettuce, ketchup and mayo. The chopped onion is essential to the flavor and texture of this amazing burger. For about 2lb ground beef I used 1 and 1/2 pack of ranch seasoning as it punches up the flavor quite a bit. Also, I made these burgers large as I had large buns, 4 giant ones as you can see in the pic. All you can say is WOAH........

One of the best burgers I've ever had and so easy to make!  My husband loves them, too, so I'll soon be making them again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I might use Panko crumbs next time instead of the Saltine crackers for a finer filling, but in any event these burgers are delicious!

I used the recommendations and left out the eggs and crackers as well as used one package of Ranch dressing per pound of meat-2 in this case  because my husband likes a ground beef/ground sirloin mix. I added 2tsp of Worcestershire and 1 capful of Dale's seasoning sauce and this was a huge hit!!!

This was a great burger, nothing about it reminded me of meatloaf.  I did add an extra package of the Ranch seasoning as someone had suggested.  However, I used Town House crackers and I didn't use an egg.  I cooked them 2 different ways:  on my George Foreman grill and pan fried.  Could not determine a difference, they both were very moist and full of flavor.  Cheese was not even necessary for these!  And tomorrow they will be even better!

I think this was the first time my mother-in-law ever complemented my cooking, lol.  I did use dried Italian bread crumbs in place of the crackers (which is probably why they weren't salty like some mentioned).  I'm not a fan of hamburgers, but these were great and everyone loved them.

I've used a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch and an egg in my burgers for years. I usually throw in a little bit of this and a little bit of that, depending on my mood (usually some cayenne pepper, minced garlic, or jarred jalapeno juice). I was once told that adding an egg to the meat helps to keep it together and from drying out. I've always received compliments on my burgers. I've never tried it with crackers, but I imagine it would dry the burgers out and dull the flavor.

Love this recipe!!!! We have made it both as burgers and meatloaf.  Personally I think it tastes better as burgers with some cheese on top.  Either way it was a hit with my family, even my picky 2-year old who rarely eats meat at her whole serving.

This is my new family favorite.  My kids will no longer allow me to grill frozen patties.  This receipe turns out burgers so juicy and flavorful you won't get anything better.

My only suggestion woudl be to freeze the burgers for a few minutes before griling to help keep them from falling apart on the grill.

Upon cursory glance, this recipe is deceptively elementary. For your inner gourmet, you may pass it over- as I was inclined. However, I am SO glad I made it! I did sliders and they are perfect for a party because these burgers NEED NOTHING MORE to enhance flavor. No catsup,mustard, pickle: nothing. I did put cheese on a few and left a few naked. Wonderfully simple & delightful recipe!

loved this burger recipe!  i halved it but kept it with one egg, used ground turkey instead of beef, and used dried minced onion instead of the fresh chopped onions.  these were very flavorful burgers, and stayed together very well.  all of us enjoyed them thoroughly!  my only recommendation for people is to crush the saltines very finely, as if they're kept in larger pieces they become soggy chunks in with your burger (yuk!)  thanks for a great burger recipe!

It does taste a bit like meatloaf, but in my opinion, that's a good thing.  I don't know what has happened to hamburger meat at the stores, but it just has almost no flavor anymore, so we have to add some flavor to it.

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I don't like saltine crackers, so I used 1/4 cup dry old fashioned oatmeal.  I also wanted to up the flavor a bit, but cut back on the salt, so I only used half of a packet of ranch dressing mix, and to it I added 1/2 teaspoon dry curry powder (salt free), 1/2 teaspoon of Mrs. Dash seasoning (salt free), 1/4 teaspoon onion powder (salt free), 1/4 teaspoon ground celery seed (salt free), 1/4 teaspoon ground cayanne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper.   I also added one heaping teaspoon of the finely minced garlic that comes in the little jars at the store (it's the garlic they use at most Chinese food restaurants).   Wow!  That was flavorful!

Mix it all together with the finely chopped onion (I only used a small onion), oats and hamburger so that the seasoning is well distributed throughout.

You have to be very careful when you turn these, or they will fall apart.  Let them cook slowly on one side until they are done on that side and then just flip them once to other side to cook that side all the way through.

A great variation for hamburgers! If you don't like MSG be careful of some ranch mixes as they have it- go for the organic or natural one to avoid it.

The burgers were moist and very good but I found they could have used a bit more flavour with the onion taking over a bit.  Very tasty though and definately will try again!

This is my husband's favorite burger.  It tastes awesome with some guacamole (I used the guacamole recipe by Bob Cody from this website ---I killed two birds with one stone: Doubled the guacamole recipe and set aside some for the burgers) with two cooked strips of bacon on top (One strip cut in half per burger).  Next time, we will try crumbled blue cheese on top, cover it with a saucepan lid for a couple of seconds so the blue cheese can melt a bit and finish it off with bacon or mushroom, yum!
Tip:  Make sure the saltine crackers are crushed fine otherwise the burger might brake apart.

tons of flavor and my kids loved it and thats saying something because 3 of the 7 dont like burgers at all.  I used 2.5lbs of 80/20 beef with 1 medium sized onion , the egg, 1.5 packages of ranch mix, and i didn't bother with the crackers. I tossed them on the grill and threw some bacon and cheese on them. This recipe is a keeper.

Used 1.3 lbs turkey and only half an onion. It was good, but not great. My husband couldn't taste the ranch even though I even spread a little bit of ranch dressing on the bun instead of other condiments. Anyway, I'm not sure that I'll be making this one again.

I halved this recipe. It made 3 good size burgers. I used a full packet of Uncle Dan's ranch. This ended up being too salty. Also I would mince the onion. The chopped onion I think contributed to the burger not staying together. I cooked on GForeman. My husband loved these.

Good burger.  Not the best thus requiring a 5 star rating.  I had to make them in a pan indoors rather than the grill so next time I'll try on the grill.

These were fabulous!  I only used about 1.5 pounds of meat (93/7) and cut back on the crackers to about 1/4 cup.  I used Penzeys Buttermilk Ranch and they came out fabulous!  I served them with the Ranch Hamburger Buns recipe from this site and caramelized onions.  Out of this world burgers!

I loved these burgers. If made right, it's a blast full of flavor. Can I has a cheeseburgur?  If you use a guacamole spread, and perhaps some tortilla chips, you can turn this bad boy into a southwest burger which taste even better!

My hubby really liked these which is why I gave them 5 stars.  I'm not much of a burger fan myself, but thought they were pretty flavorful.  I did cut the recipe in half and only made 4 burgers but I did add the full packet of dressing mix.

ok, so I have made these burgers two times in less than a week; big hit with the hubby, he just loves them! The first time I only used 1 1/2 packets of ranch and you really couldnt taste it, but today, I used 2 packets and and they were fabulous!! No need to season your meat with anything except the ranch packets. I also deleted the egg and saltine crackers and saved my onions for my condiments! I can see that this will be a part of my dinner menu for a long while!

I've been doing this for years...only I leave out the bread crumbs, add my homemade BBQ sauce, and some spicey mustard into the mix.  They are great and stay very moist.

Delicious and Juicy burgers!!!  Only giving it 4 stars because I think it could do with a bit of "oomf".  Maybe some chilli and some more salt.

Really good. These were a nice change for the usual burgers. The family really enjoyed them. I did not measure the crackers, just threw some in a bag and crumbled.

These had good flavor, but I thought the texture was a bit off.  It was almost too soft and I prefer a firmer burger.  I did use ground turkey instead of hamburger.

I made these burgers for my husband last night and he LOVED them.  I'm not a big burger fan but he told me that I had to take a bite and omg....it was SOOOO good.  I saved this in my recipe box and will only make these burgers from now on.  I'll even eat one.  I used half an onion rather than a whole one but other than that, I didn't change a thing.  Delicious!!!!!

This Burger looked like a good idea... The Ranch paket was wasted on this recipe. The Burger fell apart like crazy and the end result tasted like meatloaf. A better name for the recipe would be 'meatloaf sandwich'.

Very good! I used 1.3 lb. ground turkey meat, 1 pkg. ranch dressing, 1/2 onion, 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs. Texture not like a real meaty hamburger but the flavor made up for that.

Everyone loved these burgers.  I was looking for something a little different and saw this recipe, I unfortunately did not have the ranch so I did everything but that and they were still fantastic.  We will have these again soon and next time we will try it with the ranch.

Fabulous recipe!  Used 3 pounds of lean burger, 2 packets of ranch mix, one whole onion minced, one egg and 1/3 cup of cracker crumbs.  The burgers were delicious and moist.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks for posting!

Wow! We loved these. My kids loved them too. I didn't add the eggs or the saltines. Just chopped onion and a package of ranch to 2 lbs beef. They were perfectly moist and delicious! I think the moist part depends on what kind of ground beef you use.

These Ranch Burgers are so flavorful and delicious.  I did not have saltine crackers so I used Quaker Oats instead.  I didn't have the ranch dressing package so I made mine from scratch.  Just so good and will make them again.

This is very delishious. stayed juicy and my family loved it. I didnt think it tasted like meatloaf on a bun at all.  I would recommend using extra lean hamburger and no crackers. I also put in a handful of shredded cheese and a packet of onion soup in replace of real onions as I didnt have real ones. We used Havarti cheese for the top and it was a very good choice. The hamburger had so much flavor, we will be making this many more times.

these are fairly decent i did what alot of others did and omitted the egg and crackers...but did add 2 tsp water for moisture and slow cooked also added more ranch...also i think that modification is key...not everyone has the same desires in taste and when you modify you make it your own which makes the cook feel good that they could change up a recipe and it tastes wonderful!

I followed the recipe pretty closely (subbed dried onion, and used oats instead of saltines for health benefits). They are nice and juicy. I think you have to really like Ranch seasoning to be excited by this. Me, I was more excited by the onions, but it was still tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS! Didn't change any of the ingredients, however, I did sautee my onions in olive oil to soften them up a bit.  Topped the burgers with Creamy Havarti cheese, lettuce and tomato and they were fabulous!

I dont personally eat meat but my boyfriend does, and he raved about these burgers! He said they had the best consistancy, almost like mini meat loaves. I only used 1 pd of grd. beef and then used 1/2 the pkg of ranch mix. I used the remaining to make the actual dressing and topped out burgers with that! Thanks :)

Delicious burgers!  I use Extra Lean Meat and they came out so moist and delicious.  I was only using 1 lb. of beef, so I added 1/2 a pack of onion soup mix in place of the onions, I omitted the egg and used 10 Ritz in place of the saltines.  We added a few dashes of worschestshire.  We did use 1 full ranch seasoning pack but felt it was too salty with the other ingredients so I would only use 1/2 pack next time.  Again, I prepared 1 lb. compared to the 2 lbs. the recipe calls for.  We are going to make these again this weekend when my husband's family visits.  They will be impressed!

These were a little too mushy for me.  I used a whole package of ranch dressing mix, I think if I do ever decide to make again I will leave out the egg.

absolutely great burger here! My family thought they were delicious and couldn't keep their hands off them :P I tried wrapping some in bacon, which turned out to be a big hit. I would suggest adding some more ranch as previous reviews stated. I couldn't really taste the ranch, but nonetheless a real treat!!!

These are absolutely delicious.  I've made them a few times now and they always get rave reviews.  Only substitution is seasoned bread crumbs instead of the saltines as I usually don't have saltines on hand.  Definitely the favorite burgers in our house!

These were very flavor full. I am rating it a 4 because I used more ranch than asked. Just a suggestion, don't make them too big. I made some of mine too big and then didn't want to stay together.

I added more Ranch flavoring and a few extra seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion salt) but they were still bland.  They weren't bad but not great.

These were SO good and SO juicy.  We made them using Buttermilk Ranch dressing mix and 80/20 burger meat and grilled them.  No other changes.  We also used that same mix for meatloaf and it was equally awesome!

We thought they were good. Used dried minced onion instead of fresh, but I didn't put crackers in it. I did use the egg. Very lightly flavored.

I followed the recommendation of others and doubled the amount of ranch dressing mix.  It made it a bit salty for our taste but very flavorful.  I will try this again per the recipe.

This recipe is awesome! I did omit the onion because my boyfriend doesn't like it. It still turned out great! Next time, I will add the onion without telling him, and I'm sure it will taste even better. To the person who rated it 1 star, I'm not sure what you did wrong.

My husband and daughter both thought these were great. The only change I made was to use onion powder instead of chopped onion (1 tsp for the whole recipe) because they don't like bits of onion in their burgers. Thanks!

These burgers were really good.  I was a little skeptical about using the cracker crumbs as I have never used any fillers when making hamburgers.  I used them and I’m glad I did.  I followed the recipe exactly but I didn’t measure anything.  I had a 3.2 ounce bag of ranch dressing mix so I wasn’t sure how to measure 1 ounce but think I got too much.  They were well seasoned and juicy.

Excellent flavors.  I like ranch, not love it, and was hesitant thinking it would be overpowering.  But it is not at all.  This is a great recipe.  Kids & spouse loved it.  Will definitely make this again!

I used prepared ranch dressing because that's what I had on hand. I also added a little bit of onion soup mix. We grilled them on the BBQ and added cheese. My husband added BBQ sauce to burger, and I put coleslaw on mine. That was good!

Thought it was a good burger...my husband really liked them, my kids ate them pretty well.  Cut the recipe to 1 lb. of ground bison, but used an entire egg (how do you cut that in half anyway?), full envelope of ranch dip mix, 1 tbsp of tastefully simple onion onion instead of fresh (trying to hide it from the kids), and a mixture of wheat germ and bread crumbs.  They held together fine and cooked on the foreman were plenty juicy.

used a pacakage of onion soup mix in addition to the ranch mix. i also omitted the bread crumbs. this burger was better than any burger that you would get at a restaurant. it needs no mustard or ketchup cause it's just sooo moist and flavorful. it's really good topped with american white cheese, garlic mayo, carmelized onions, bacon, and pickled japalenos. yuummmmmm...

These burgers were very moist, juicy and flavorful!  I left out the onion and replaced the crackers with some italian bread crumbs.  These are best if made ahead and refrigerated for at least a few hours to let the flavors come together.

Yum!  Great burger...  I used 1 pound 90% lean beef and adjusted the recipe accordingly with about 2/3 of a pack of Hidden Valley Ranch Dip mix because that's what I had. It's pretty much the same as their dressing mix. Because of the 90 % lean I expected them come come out a little dry as your supposed to use 85% for a juicier burger but the were nice and moist.  Lots of great flavor too.  Also, as another reviewer did I used Ritz crackers b/c I didn't have any saltines.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  Will make again!  Love it.

These were good.  I didn't taste the ranch flavoring so much, but they were moist, which was a huge hit w/my extended family that came over for a barbeque.  They thought the burgers were outstanding; I guess I was expecting a bit more of the ranch flavor to come through.

Yummy! This is my recipe for burgers from now on. I ended up having to pan fry them because we ran out of propane... and they were still delicious... not too meaty tasting at all. I know if this recipe tastes delicious pan fried it will be knock out on the grill!

Tasty and simple if you are looking for something different from your traditional burger.  Kind of like a meatloaf sandwich though.

Thank you SO::: much for this recipe!  I made these delicious babies for the 4th of July and they were sensational!!  I only had 1.25 pounds of beef and I think that that works better than using 2 pounds so that the flavors are more intense, in a good way.  Just about everybody had 2 burgers each and, I agree with some others, that condiments aren't really needed on these burgers!

Wow! These burgers were AMAZING! Thanks for sharing.  I made a few changes to items I had on hand but they still turned out very tasty. I slathered A1 on the burgers b/4 my husband put them on the grill & oh my god, good.

Great flavor- they smelled so good when I was mixing them, I had this carnivorous urge to eat some raw- but I restrained. I will come back to this recipe again! I flattened my mixture and then cut the patties into squares. That made sure they cooked evenly.

I really enjoyed these burgers and so did my mom. I left out the onions and substituted crackers for plain bread crumbs. I didn't have 2 pounds of ground beef I only had 1 and a quarter pounds and the one packet was plenty. You really dont need any condiments. I just used lettuce and tomatoes and topped them with mozzarilla cheese. Yummooo!!!

While I did alter this recipe a quite a bit I followed the general idea and it turned out great! I didnt have a ranch packet but I had onion soup mix, so I used this minus the onion. Also Italian bread crumbs in place of crackers. I think the egg and bread made the texture so unique and the soup mix was amazing flavor though i look forward to using the Ranch seasoning. Thanks a bunch!

I have made this for 2 different events and got lots of compliments.  I would recomend doubling the amount of ranch to give it more flavor.  It was very jucy, held together on the grill -- it was fabulous.  It is now a favorite.

Maybe it was the dressing mix we used, but the burgers were extremely salty- we almost couldn't taste anything else.

My hubby grills the most moist and juicy burgers...this is what I recommend for these (after following the recipe): egg, ranch pkt, no bread crumbs...but maybe brush on some barbque sauce on them at the end of grilling. The flavor would be much better. These were just so-so in my opinion (taste-wise) ...hubby always still manages a juicy burger no matter what the ingredients.

I was looking for a different type burger, this is certainly different but didn't suit our taste buds.  Will stick with my liquid smoke and Cavender's Greek Seasoning.

I made these with turkey, which was great but fell apart more easily- should use a little more egg or water to hold together, but they had a GREAT taste

This recipe was easy and really good.  The eggs and crumbs kept the burgers from falling apart on the grill which was a great help!!!  I will fix it again.

We liked these burgers for a change.  I did make a few changes.  I used onion powder instead of onions because my fam doesn't eat onions if they aren't cooked.  I left out the crackers and halfed the amount of meat (ground turkey).  They stayed together better than plain turkey burgers do but they burned a lot faster.  Still, a nice way to change a summer staple.

These were good hamburgers.  As I mixed them up, they smelled great.  They did remind me a little of meatloaf (which I hate) but that is probably because they were quite over-cooked.  Although the burgers were crunchy and black in places, they remained surprisingly moist on the inside.  I forgot to add the onion, though I'm not sure I missed it.  The ranch flavor came through quite nicely.  I will be keeping a packet of ranch dressing on hand from now on to make these burgers.  The only change I will make, is next time I will do the grilling!!

Very flavorful, I didn't have an onion so I added some dried minced onions to the beaten egg and let it sit for 30 mins. before adding to the hamburger.  Great burgers, Thanks.

Yumm, good burgers.  I've never made burgers before, so this is my first time.  But it turned out pretty well, even tho I had really fat burgers.  Haha, and I used the George Foreman grill, which worked out great.  People loved it, :)

This is my go to recipe for burgers in my house.  It is asked for as birthday meal, basically a favorite in our house! Followed directions as written.  (I have also used gluten free ingredients for my gluten free kid)

Whenever I find a recipe to check out I first read the positive reviews and see how people changed it to make it better. Like my great cook mother, who has always improved on a recipe, I try to do the same thing.   The cracker crumbs did not sound good to me so I changed it to panko. I think bread crumbs could work too. I put fresh ground pepper in it and was generous with the ranch dressing too. We grilled them on our charcoal grill which gave it more flavor and I used my meat thermometer to be sure not too cook to death.   I feel sorry for you people who feel you have to follow a recipe to the letter, you are missing out! Read the positive ratings!

I've made these a couple of times now and they make a nice juicy burger, but I find a couple of quick changes could make this a five star recipe. For those that find this too meatloafy - I made these the second time with Worcestershire sauce replacing the egg with great results. I have also added finely diced bacon and garlic into the patty for a lovely flavour boost. Bound to make these again with the few changes to the original recipe next time the family wants burgers.

Very yummy! I am not a fan of putting saltines in my recipes, so I used bread crumbs instead. The burgers were very tender and flavorful, and were a big hit with the family. Would love to make again!

Shocked how moist these are! The saltine crackers really hold in the moisture & the onions/ranch make them incredibly flavorful. Top with some bacon & avo - perfect burger!

It had the consistency of meatloaf. It was okay since I like meatloaf, but not exactly what I was expecting. I've made this twice now, and I'm just not that impressed with how they turned out. Not bad, just not amazing.

This was okay for us, couldn't really taste the ranch, really needs some more seasoning like garlic and pepper. The meat mixture was quite dry as well had to add milk to form the patties properly. I used Club House dry ranch mix as I live in Canada and it was the only one I could find, don't know if that makes a difference.

Truly tasty burger.  I did not have Ranch Drsg. mix so used California dill dressing mix instead.  Everything else was as stated in the recipe and it turned out great.  This is my new standard burger!!

If I could give these less than 1 star I would. I threw mine out and hubby managed to eat one only because he was really hungry. Didn't change anything from the original directions. These were just plain awful.  Will not repeat.

This was sooooo delicious and I will definitely be making it again!  I'd be lying if I said it didn't taste Better the day after.  I listened to others advice about avoiding the egg & bread crumbs.  I added a packet of ranch for every lb of meat and for every 2 lbs of meat I added one packet of onion soup.  I marinated it with 1 tbls of worchestenier sce for every lb of meat and after 4 hours added another 1.5 tablespoons.  I sprayed my pan with Pam and cooked each side for 6-7 minutes. It came out perfect and made the house smell so amazing!!

I only used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 the amount of cracker crumbs, but used a full packet of ranch mix and an egg.  The onion I left out accidentally, oops!  The burgers were quite good, though, and the ranch flavor was not at all overwhelming.  I grilled them and my husband said they were the second best burgers I've made, but a lot of that probably was because they were grilled instead of cooked on the stove.  Regardless, I will make these again!

I give these about 4.5 stars. At first bite they were kind of a mix between a hamburger and meatloaf. However, they tasted much more like a burger once on a hamburger bun with condiments. They were just very moist, but that is not bad. I made 1/2 recipe and got 6 burgers. Chopping the onion and saltines was very quick, as I just did them each in my Vitamix blender. My egg was kind of small, so I ended up adding a spoon of olive oil to help with the binding. I bought the hamburger at Trader Joes and typically I get their leanest which is 96/4. They only had 90/10 and it worked fine. Probably helped with them not being too dry. I lined a large baking sheet with foil and sprayed it with PAM and just broiled the burgers. They took about 15 minutes in the middle of the oven on high. As I thought they were going to only taste like meatloaf, I ended up brushing the tops with chili sauce when they were done. I used toasted whole wheat seeded hamburger buns, I usually use for turkey burger and that worked good too. I was short on vegetables except for leafy lettuce, so we used a variety of condiments mayo, ketchup, Dijon, and relish. I liked that I finally stretched a 1 lb pack of meat from 4 burgers to 6!

This is our FAVE burger recipe. I'd rather make it at home than go buy a burger if I could be eating this one. I substitute the fresh chopped onion for 1 T dried minced onion since I don't like too much onion in my food. Just enough to give it flavor.

These came out really well.

I followed the recipe, the only change I made was doubling the amount of ranch mix I used (I had read other reviews saying to do so, but I mainly did it because I love ranch and wanted a super ranchy burger)

I cooked mine on the stovetop over medium heat, 8 minutes per side and they cooked up perfectly.  I will agree with other reviews that the addition of breadcrumbs does give these burgers a bit of a "meatloaf" texture, but I didn't mind that.

The ranch flavor, even doubled, was not quite what I was expecting.  I think next time I might add even more powder, or drizzle some ranch dressing on the top of my burger.  However, I think that's just a personal taste preference because I love a good strong ranch flavor.  As is the burgers are still good and have an understated ranch flavor that works well with the meat.

Added minced garlic, traded the crackers for bread crumbs and omitted the egg altogether. With those changes, these were pretty good.  Put red onion, tomato, provolone cheese, and bbq sauce on our burgers and it only added to the ranch flavor.  Froze these raw ranch patties so we could have them in a flash on the next burger night!

I did not like these at all. Despite all the reviews saying it reminded them of meatloaf, I went ahead and made them.

This recipe is wonderful. I was looking for a burger recipe that used some sort of breading to hold in the moisture since I would be cooiking them on my George Forman grill due to the winter weather. The burgers were very tastey and moist. This will definately be one of my burger recipes during the winter months!

I, too, have tried this recipe many times.  The burgers are delicious, however I do add to it.  I also add in 1/3 cup of Dale's Low Sodium steak seasoning.  This keeps the burgers moist and juicy, regardless of how you prefer to eat your burgers; rare, medium rare, etc.

Definitely add more ranch than recipe calls for...maybe double. Next time I might try "spicy ranch instead"! Went light on crackers or else gets a little dry even with chuck.

What amazing burgers.  My husband is very fussy when it comes to eating a burger and he could not get over how great this one tasted. 

He likes the fact that it tastes like burgers from his childhood.  Sometimes nowadays people put so many ingredients in their burgers it is overwhelming and does not harmonize with the rest of the meal.  

Yours however were really great.  I will defiantly be making these again.

I mix the ranch dressing mix and about 1/2c.(+/-) of prepared bacon pieces into the meat and form the burgers.  We don't like them pressed out and formed perfectly, but we do make an indentation in the center of each, so the burger will be a more uniform thickness when done. Usually top with cheddar or cheddar/jack cheese. Really good flavor.

This is a great recipe!  Instead of saltines I used bread crumbs in the box.  The second time I changed to turkey and used only 1 pound of ground turkey with the same amount of ranch dressing and egg. I used green pepper instead onion and cut back on the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup. Tasted great!  Every version of this recipe has been a hit with family and friends!

I know this will make people mad, but I am giving five stars including the changes I made. I only really took others suggestions. I used no egg or saltines, but I added worcestershire sauce and cracked pepper. They were awesome. I will always make them this way from now on.

These are excellent with a wonderful flavor!  I took the advice of others and used one package Ranch mix to one pound of meat. I added one clove minced garlic, omitted the egg and breadcrumbs. Put them in the frig for 30 minutes before grilling.

made this for my son and me and we weren't very impressed.  It was like eating meatloaf on a bun.  I had also frozen 4 as I had made 8 burgers.  I cooked the remaining 4 in the oven and served as I would meatloaf.  Much better this way.  I think these would've been much better just adding the ranch and nothing else.

These were very flavorful and moist...I used the whole Ranch package for 1 lb. of beef and used 1/2 package of dry onion mix...it was very salty though so next time I think I'd just use 1/4 package or use fresh onion like the recipe states.  I also added some shredded cheddar cheese to the mix.  I caramelized some onions to top them off with...very good!

FANTASTIC. I used a combo onion, garlic, shallot mix for the onions, added an extra packet of ranch dressing and less breadcrumbs (1/2 cup). Moist and amazing.

I don't have a grill so I had to use the stove top to make these, but I found them falling apart on me! The crackers were supposed to be enough to hold the meat together, but it did NOT work for me. Once I added bread crumbs to make them 'stick', I found that they did not cook well at all. I will not make this again

No stars for this recipe....I agree with several other comments. The crackers are to OTT (over the top)...I made these with ground round, the dressing mix, and some extra garlic and onion. Added a tablespoon of soy sauce and 2 cups of shredded cheddar jack cheese. LUSCIOUS!

These burgers were moist, but they were lacking in flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, without substitutions.  The only thing I did differently was to grate the onion on the fine side of a box grater.  I won't be making these again.

My husband's favorite food is burgers. He adored this one! We each used different toppings and both of our burgers were delicious!

These burgers where not juicy or tasty.  My family was not that impressed.  I grilled them on the George Foreman so they should have been very juicy.  I think the crackers absorb the juices.  It taste almost like meatloaf.

Delicious. I didn't put any saltines in mine though. These came out very moist, and the flavor of the meat was not lost. I usually use a little less than the full packet of ranch dressing, can be a little too salty.

This recipe is GREAT!  I made several changes(according to other reviews), using 1/4 cup plain bread crumbs instead of  saltines.  I also used the ranch Dips package because I had it on hand. Did not have to add any onion either because of the strong onion flavor in the dips mix.  After giving my husband and son a pinch to try, their response was WOW!  Enough said!!

I really enjoyed these burgers as they had a lot of flavor.  I omitted the crackers because I didn't want the extra carbs.  Chopped onions really added a lot, too.  Will definitely make a gain.

Mmmm! I took some advice of others and left out the egg, but did include a few Saltines. I only used 1lb of meat, a whole packet of ranch, and about 1/3 pack of crackers. It was very tasty - actually, I took off the bun completely and just ate it plain with a fork! A nice, quick, and easy twist on a class burger.

This recipe looked fabulous so I went to the store and bought the Hidden Ranch dry dressing mix. They have a recipe on the back for a similar burger. I combined the two...I used the chopped onions from this recipe with some shredded cheddar and the powder from the other recipe and the end result was great! I didn't use the egg or the crackers for the burgers. Great burger, will be making it again!

Left the crackers and egg out and used less onion. The hamburger mix, with all the chopped onion, looks like it would fall apart on the grill, but the patties stayed together nicely.  I used ground sirloin.  The flavor is fantastic!  Definitely will make again!

Very moist and tasty. I would suggest using a little less than the whole 1 oz. of ranch dressing mix though. I will make this again! Nice variation of an American favorite.

This is better than a lot of other burger recipes I have tried but not "the best."  Don't get me wrong--it is very good and was very moist and great on the grill.  I made it for my two kids, husband and my parents and everyone thought it was really good.

I loved this burger. Flavor is great. I needed a quick recipe and this was definitely it. With that said, I liked tasting the meat more than I liked the burger, I think i will make it as meatballs where the taste of this meat can shine more...or something in another recipe or on it's own. Haven't quite put my finger on it. But if i need a quick burger recipe, I will make this but if I have more time, I'd probably use another one & save this recipe to make as a separate dish, not a burger. I also doubled the ranch & decreased the crackers because I was using very lean ground beef.

Wow!!! I just finished eating this burger, and I literally scarfed it down because it was so good! I nearly doubled up on the ranch and just added the onions. After it came off the grill, we brushed the burgers with buffalo sauce so we had buffalo ranch burgers. My boyfriend said it tasted like a piece of tender meatloaf on a bun, in a VERY good way! Can't wait to make it again!

It was really good. I only needed to use 1 lb. of gound beef so I used a whole pack of ranch, a half an onion, only 5 Ritz crackers (instead of saltines) & the egg. In keeping with the ranch theme I spread fat free ranch dressing on the whole wheat hamburger bun. Really good. Enjoy!

These burgers were pretty darn good.  If I make them again I won't add as much onion... I guess it depends on the size of onion you buy.

Good and Juicy burgers. I followed the suggestion of others and substituted the onions for onion soup powder and added some garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to the mix. I used only a half sleeve of butter crackers and added a 1/2 tsp of olive oil to the mixture. Yummy burgers that were really moist.

My family loves these burgers.  I usually triple the recipes and prep the burgers for the freezer so its a fast end of the day meal with a salad.  These burgers are juicy and BBQ really well.  So much flavour.

My family and I loved these burgers.  I usually leave the burger making to someone else, but decided to try these with the helpful tips of others.  Due to the whole meatloaf taste thing, I omitted the eggs and crackers/breadcrumbs.  I did, however, add 1 pkg dry onion soup mix, the ranch dressing mix, a dash or two of worcestershire sauce, minced dry onions, and a bit of Lawry's seasoning salt.   Simple.  They were a huge hit.  Everyone was complmentng me on the burgers that were grilled on our green egg. Guest asked for the recipe and I had to hide the last 2 burgers so my husband would have leftovers the next day and reluctantly gave one up after realizing a guest had not eaten one yet.  To the others- as many brats and hot dogs as they could eat.  :

These were ok - I think the ranch mix did make the burgers a bit salty. My husband loved these - I'll try making them again but play around with the ingredients a bit more.

We really enjoyed these.  I used very lean ground beef and they came out moist and delicious.  Next time I will reduce or eliminate the onion.

I used 2 lbs hamburger and two packets of ranch seasoning.  A little too salty, but still the best burger I've made on my grill.  I did not add the rest of the ingredients to the mix.  We topped with the onion, lettuce, tomato and ranch dressing.  My 8 year old daughter hates burgers, she's a hot dog girl.  I convinced her to taste the burger and she ate a whole one without the bun, amazing!

After forming these patties, they were so soft that I had to put them on foil to keep them from falling through the grill to the fire. Also, with the egg and cracker crumbs, they tasted like meatloaf.

I made this last night for something quick and easy.  My family loved it!  It's a good recipe when you need something different on the grill.  I followed the recipe and the only change I made was substituting bread crumbs instead of crackers.  Will be making this again!

This was very tasty. Omitted the eggs & crackers because they do not belong in a hamburger!!! Flavor was great without them. Also substituted 1tbsp. onion powder for the small onion b/c my husband doesn't like the pieces of onion, but still tasted great!

I made these tonight and took some of the other cooks ideas, however I could not fathom just ranch dressing and onion soup mix to hold it together: a) it was salty enough with the ranch dressing, B) the burgers did not hold up well with out the eggs and crackers/bread crumbs. I will try again with ranch packet and eggs! Is tasty just saltly too.

These burgers were the best. One thing I would add was just make sure you chopped the onions in fine pieces.

Used 1 lb hamburger instead of 2 and used breadcrumbs since that's what I had on hand. I forgot to add an egg but it didn't really matter because it still came out great!  I thought it still needed more flavor but after adding the condiments and veggies it was wonderful.

My friends at the barbecue were really impressed that I did something other than just throwing together meat and onion and egg. I had to use a bunch of breadcrumbs though, because i tripled the recipe but only had 2 packets of ranch seasoning, so I fudged it a little with actual ranch dressing squirted in. Naturally that made them a little too goopy, so I had to compensate with breadcrumbs. Makes a great burger though!

These were great.  Used 95% lean beef and about 8 reduced fat Keebler club crackers and a whole package of the Ranch mix with a whole diced onion.  They stayed together for grilling and had a great flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband absolutely loved these burgers and asked that I make them for his parents! I found them a bit meatloafy, but that's probably only because one of the reviews suggested it. Delicious! A keeper in our family!

Man, fantastics! I haven't even tasted yet, they smell great! Hold on a sec.....Great recipe! All I did was omit the onions since my wife doesn't like them. Used 1.5lbs of burger and got four nice sized patties out of them. So good I had to write my first review!!

Great flavor on these, I love 'meatloaf burgers' anyway and this is a nice twist on them.  Next time, though, I will probably use (rehydrated) dried minced onion instead for better texture; the chopped fresh onion seemed to break up the meat too much.

I left out the ones (per guest requests), and I used between 1.5 and 1.75lb ground beef.  I believe that made the ranch flavor more noticeable (which ws good!)  I also used plain bread crumbs instead of crackers.  They got rave reviews.  Everyone wants the recipe!

These hamburgers are awesome! The only thing that I changed is I only used about 1 1/2 lbs hamburger since that is what I had. The flavor was a real nice change from just a plain burger.

I will make this every time we have burgers! However you need 2-3 times the ranch dressing mix to give it any flavor.  I also let it sit for a good hour in the frig before I made the patties and grilled them. I would not change anything else just add more ranch mix. Very juicy burgers!!!!

I was so excited to try this recipe and followed it to a T.  I, like a few others on the review boards, was left with something wanting.  It did taste like meatloaf on a bun.  We could hardly taste the Ranch flavor at all.  Plus, once on the grill, the patties completely fell apart when we tried to flip them over.  What did I do wrong??

These were pretty dense burgers. I don't like the meatloaf texture for my burgers. The taste of these were a bit bland and dry. I grilled them on the George Foreman.

Wow....so tasty! Used beefy onion soup mix with the ranch packet. I also added some shredded cheddar cheese to the mix. These burgers grilled perfectly, were juicy, and had a great flavor. These burgers were excellent served with bacon, sauteed onions, cheese and Secret Burger Sauce from this site. Thanks!

AWESOME burgers!  I made these last night and my husband and kids LOVED them.  The only change I made was I used crushed garlicy croutons in place of the saltines.  The burgers were so juicy and full of flavor.  My husband had 3!  I will definitely be making these again!

Delicious!  I made the following changes/additions:  Ritz instead of saltines, low-fat ranch packet, dash of cayenne pepper, dash of garlic salt, few sprinklings of worsteshire sauce.  Absolutely wonderful and will make again and again!

I didn't like the texture of these burgers. I felt like I was eating a meatloaf sandwich. I added extra ranch, and I am glad that I did because they would have been really bland. The taste was good, but too much like meatloaf. My family and friends like hearty burgers. Next time I would leave out the crackers and egg and still double the ranch.

I needed to get dinner ready quick so I used the ranch and as someone else suggested I used onion soup mix. I also added some BBQ sauce. I used a foreman gril to cook them for 5 minutes and they were perfectly cooked. They were nice and moist though I did not think the ranch flavour was very strong I do think it added to the over all taste.

Very good burger. They taste different than the norm which is a nice alternative once in a while but I think I will stick with what we are used to.

I now only make these burgers, adding big slice of red onion and slice of tomato on top.  These spoiled me for any other burger......

This recipe was great. I mixed 2 lbs of ground beef with 1 package of ranch dressing mix, 1 package of Beefy Onion mix and 1 egg. They were easy, held together well, and tasted great!

This is a 5 star recipe. My wife and I just finished cooking for 7 people and every person, including us, loved the burgers. We did make some changes to the recipes as recommended by others. For 8 servings, instead of 2 lbs. we used 2.5 lbs. We substituted the saltines for plain breadcrumbs and also doubled the amount of ranch. Even with the added amount of meet, the taste was great. We love onions and put in the entire, near pound of onions. The burgers did fall apart a little bit, but with some maneuvering, we only had one completely fall apart, which worked out since one of our guests didn't want a bun. We made exactly 8 burgers. Overall, this recipe turned out fantastic and will 100% make it again. Thanks!

I enjoyed the extra zip that the ranch dressing gave these burgers.  I must say that I used turkey and left out the egg and crackers (I never see the need for binders), but, from now on, will always use ranch dressing in my burgers (and meat loaf for that matter)!

This is the absolute best burger I have ever tasted! I followed all of the instructions, and grilled it on a fresh platter.

This burger is TO DIE FOR!

Thank you so much for sharing this *DELICIOUS* recipe!

I did not care for these. I made them on the stovetop, and I think they would have  been better on the grill, but probably even then only three stars. I like a well-seasoned burger, but this seasoning just didn't work for me with burgers. My husband didn't like it either.

This was just ok. I was expecting a burger and what came out was basically meatloaf on a bun. That said, it was fairly tasty, it was just not anything that I would consider a hamburger, and thus I was disappointed.

Very tasty burgers. The first time I made them for a family cookout, I got rave reviews. Had to share the recipe with them.

I made them this weekend and used cheese crackers instead of saltines. Very good.

This is my standard burger recipe now.

These tasted amazing, after reading the reviews I decided to add another packet of the ranch dressing mix...the only problem i had with these was they all fell apart while cooking.

I leave out the egg/cracker binder, but they still work.

My family loves this recipe & actually request these burgers. It is the only way I will make a burger now. Even the kids like these.

I felt that this recipe for burgers was average. The flavor didn't stand out from the beef as much as I would have liked it. I would suggest doubling the amount of ranch dressing packets added to help this out. The texture of the overall burger was very nice and it held together well. I'll stick to my old burger recipe, but it was nice to try this one.

I have done these burgers twice and they are very good. The first time I did these I gave my sister the recipe and she was surprised that it had egg in the meat. My husband's sister and her boyfriend enjoyed the burgers and asked when we were going to grill again.

Great burger. I halved the recipe, still used the full package of ranch mix, and substituted oats for the crushed crackers (for a healthier spin). Turned out great.

I followed other reviews and used two packs of the dressing. As a result, the ranch taste overwhelmed the charcoal grill flavor. One suggestion I didn't follow was using onion soup mix instead of diced onions; these were salty enough. They weren't bad, but I wouldn't make it again.

I followed the advice of most reviewes and skipped the egg/crackers... I would agree with other reviewers and double the ranch next time - I used 1 & 1/2 packet and it could have used more. Chopped onions and bacon bits were a great addition. These burgers were very moist and were liked by everyone ! Thank you for posting!

All I can say is WOW! I saw these on the front page and thought it was a good way to spice up boring hamburgers. I made them for dinner tonight and they were AWESOME. I love the flavors and the way they blend together. We dressed them like we would normal burgers and the flavor was intense! We will definitely be putting these babies into circulation here at our house! They're too good not to! ***UPDATE*** I made these for when my mom came down. Everyone LOVED them! The raw onions bring out an a certain flavor with the ranch dressing packets. Also, I use the eggs because it keeps the meat moist. That's what everyone loved about these burgers is that off the grill, they were still moist for being so THICK! Wonderful Recipe!!!!

Pretty good burgers! I used 1.12 lbs of 20% hamburger, a package of Lipton onion soup mix, a package of ranch dressing and approximately 3/4 cup shredded cheddar. I cooked them 5 minutes per side. They came out real juicy. They were a tad on salty side, though (my fault). Old habits die hard; next time I'll skip the salt on this receipe.

UPDATE: My friend called to say that her mom and dad LOVED these and that she HAD to have the recipe. Now that's a compliment! A pretty good burger, however, not my "favorite" (but I'm VERY picky when it comes to burgers...). Made these for my friend and I (I halved the recipe for the two of us). She LOVED them and is taking the leftovers to her mom and dad b/c I didn't want to keep them. Don't get me wrong... these were good, just now wow! Here's the modifications I made based on other's reviews / suggestions: a) used an entire 1 oz. pkg. of Ranch seasoning instead of 1/2  of it as called for and b) broiled burgers for 4-5 minutes per side (made these around 9 PM - too late to get out the grill). I purchased some real bacon bits to add to the burger mixture, but forgot to add them! I'm sure that would have been a nice touch. Topped my burger with cheddar cheese and peppercorn ranch dressing. Would like to try adding shredded cheddar cheese  and / or crushed sour cream & onion potato chips to the meat mixture and coating with peppercorn seasoning as per another's suggestion. Maybe that would make it a keeper for me (?). Maybe top with bacon too? Thanks for sharing. : )

Very good. made and froze raw for a camping trip.  thawed in the cooler and cooked over open flame.  I also used the onion soup mix and only the stated amount of ranch mix. It didn't taste like ranch, but it was very flavorful.

These are excllent burgers.  You know during your first bite that you are in for something special.  They are quick and easy to make too.  The only alteration I made was to double the ranch dressing as some others had suggested.

Ok, we loved the texture of these burgers, but we weren't as crazy about the taste. We took the suggestions of others and added 2 ranch packets, which was too much for our taste. I also used a huge onion, which didn't help. This would have probably been perfect with the onion soup mix and one ranch packet. I gave it 5 stars because the original recipe would have been perfect=) We will try it that way. Thank you so much=)

This was SO good. I did make some changes. I used 1 lb of meat instead of two. I added a whole packet of Ranch mix to that 1 lb instead of only half a packet. Instead of saltine crackers i ground up some croutons. and because my family doesn't care for onions i used 2T of dried minced onions. These burgers were wonderful. the only problem i had was that they fell apart on the grill but i think that was my fault because i forgot the egg. Next time i'll try to remember the egg. These were so flavorful and moist. a keeper!

This recipe is great. I did change a few things though. The first time I made these they fell apart so the 2nd time I made them I left out the crackers and doubled the ranch. THEY ARE WONDERFUL!!! Next time I will try it with just ranch mix and onion soup mix as suggested by others. Thank you so much for this recipe. We don't eat plain burgers anymore.

This burger was so good! I changed the recipe a bit. I fried four slices of bacon and crumbled peices into the ground beef. I also sauteed the onions in the bacon oil, added worcestershire sauce and a teaspoon of mustard and mixed it into the raw meat. It was so good and everyone enjoyed the burgers. 
I topped my burger with chedder cheese, avocado, lettuce and a red onion. I also used onion kaiser rolls, lightly toasted. :)

Just what I was looking for!  I need to go shopping so I was out of a few things.  I didn't have an egg so I also skipped the crackers, and I didn't have and onion, so I used minced. Still loved it and will try the way it was originally posted soon!

WOW!  These are incredible! I am typically not much of a homemade burger girl, but I ate two of these!  I used minced onions instead of fresh onion, Ritz instead of saltines and made them in a skillet (which normally I despise, but it was raining out so didn't want to use the grill).  I was surpised how good these were.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was an excellent recipe.  I agree with someone else that statet more ranch mix was better and I did the same. I am a ranch FINATIC though.  

A great change for just the plain old cheese burger with a lot of flavor!!

I only had a pound of beef so I used half the ranch dressing, added bread crumbs instead of crackers and it tasted good. It's also very filling. Would make again.

These were tasty, but way too salty. I doubled the recipe for a BBQ we had, cooked a couple of the burgers, and ended up adding more beef to mellow the salt out. Next time I would use less seasoning, and maybe try onion soup mix with the ranch. Worth playing around with.

I was expecting more ranch flavor because I doubled the amount.  All in all a good juicy burger grilled to perfection by my DH.  I did not have any problems with burgers falling apart as mentioned in earlier reviews.  Will make these again.  Thank you for sharing

The first time I made these the onion was overpowering.  The second time I made them I used less onion and they were much better, but still the ranch dressing flavor did not come through very well.  The next time i make them I will double the ranch dressing mix.

These burgers were alright.  I had a few compliments but I don't think they were the best I have made.  I am not sure why others stated that their burgers fell apart.  My burgers remained firm.  I made the burger mixture about an hour before cooking and left them covered in the frig.  Maybe that is what is needed to help keep them together.

Very juicy/tasty hamburgers. My family loved these -we are having a large bbq this next week and I'm making them again! Tip: the more expensive/leaner beef the better tasting burger!

well, I thought this was only okay.  I did change 2 things I only used 1 lb beef, and 1/2 c. crackers. everything else was the same. The burgers fell apart on the grill.  There was a lack of flavor.

I've made these twice in the past week.  A big hit with DH.  I followed some of the other suggestions, and used dry bread crumbs instead of saltines, and left out the egg.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I probably should not rate this one as I made quite a few changes.  I just really wanted to try the ranch part of the recipe so I puchased pre-made patties and justed rubbed with olive oil and dry ranch dressing.  They were pretty flavorful this way.  My family like them - so I'm sure I'll do it this way again.

Like other people have said this tasted more like meatloaf on a bun. Which I like it any way, but mine fell apart for some reason. I also added an extra pack of dry ranch seasoning. I will make again but I will leave out the egg and the crackers. My kids loved them!

Wonderful, flavorful, easy.  Hamburgers turn out tender and juicy!  Have made it more than three times and will continue to make it and I rarely repeat recipes.

It sure does remind me of meatloaf mix, as another reviewer suggested. I might cut down on the onions next time as well, but other than that, they do have a nice flavor. My husband is not as talented on the grill as some, or they may have turned out as a 5 star. I will try these again though, again, less onion and better grilling will probably make this a five star recipe.

I usually make plain beef burgers and serve with lots of condiments to add flavor, but my family requested burgers "with stuff in them." I had everything I needed for this recipe except saltines so I substituted panko crumbs. I broiled them and ground a little pepper on top. No one asked for condiments. They all said this recipe is a keeper... and I agree.

It was hard to taste the burger over all my mayo, mustard, ketchup and everything else on my burger.  Plus I pat them out pretty thin, since they seem to shrink up on the grill.  Next time I won't make them so thin.

Great recipe but I do think there is a little too much onion. I would suggest adding a little less onion.

These were okay.  They reminded me of meatloaf instead of a juicy, greasy burger.  I used breadcrumbs instead of saltines, but I didn't feel like the ranch flavor really came through.  They were definitely moist, but any burger is as long as you don't overcook it.

These have a really good flavor. I really enjoyed these. Only thing is that a couple of the bites were a bit mushy. I may try to crush the crackers finer next time. I will make these again!

Ok - I would just love to know what I did wrong here!  I followed the recipe to the "t" but the burgers completely fell apart.  What I could salvage was more like "loose meat burgers"?  The taste was just ok.  Sorry
