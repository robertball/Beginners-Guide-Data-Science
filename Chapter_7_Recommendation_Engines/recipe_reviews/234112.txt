I saw this in the allrecipies magazine and I just knew I had to try it! The first time I made it I thought it was pretty awesome but it had too much of a floury taste for my liking. Thankfully I have a coworker who is like a human version of Ratatouille and immediately made suggestions that made this soup super brilliant! So here is what I do: 

1) stir zucchini, onion, water, salt, basil, 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 3 tsp of chicken bouillon together in a pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until zucchini is tender
2)puree mixture
3)pour mixture back into pot, add 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and bring to a boil. 
thats it. super simple and it was a big hit at our potluck :D I hope someone finds this modified version helpful. cheers!

This is pretty yummy!  I doubled everything, and instead of mixing the flour and milk, I sauteed the onions in butter, added the flour to make a roux, then added the milk and a pinch of nutmeg to that and heated until the milk was thickened.  Then I added the milk/onion mixture to the zucchini and brought back to a boil.  It thickened nicely, but isn't too thick and doesn't have a floury taste.  I also hit the zucchini with my stick blender after it was soft rather than putting it into the blender  Great way to use up some of my many zucchinis!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, when made with reviewers suggestions.  I upped the zucchini to 6c., and lowered the flour to 2T.  Added a small amont of seasoned salt and garnished with cooked bacon pieces.

Saw this in the mag and had zucchini in the fridge. Excellent for its simplicity. These are really all the spices you need. But I would add more zucchini as it cooks down quite a bit and I even used more than the 4cups. And definitely go less on the flour. 3tbsp almost ruins it. 2 med/small zucchini made about 6cups so I will try with at least 8cups next time and no more than 2tbsp flour max. Flavor is delicate so don't overspice. Flavor will develop after sitting a bit. I ended up adding a dash more basil along with the pepper in the end. Perfect recipe size for 1 person. You will not get sick of it before it is gone.yum.

This recipe was easy and healthier than most "creamy" soups. I made the following changes: I doubled the recipe and used chicken broth instead of water and cut the salt by half. I also made a roux with butter, onion powder (didn't have fresh on hand) then added almond milk instead of regular. Once it was thickened, I added it to the zucchini mixture and seasoned with nutmeg and black pepper. My immersion blender worked great to pur√©e the soup...no mess or transferring hot liquids!

I followed the recipe as written, and I found the end product extremely bland. I think with addition of some garlic and extra basil and salt, this could be ok. I tried to fix the soup after it was finished by adding those ingredients in and overdid it (my own fault) and ended up just dumping the whole thing, it was that bad. I have plenty more zucchini to try again! I'll update this review if I decide to try this recipe again, but I think I will try some of the other recipes on this site first.

This was really good. Only change was more zucchini. I thought this soup would be boring, but I really liked the zucchini and basil combo

It didn't state whether or not to peel the zukes. I peeled them. I used an emulsifier instead of the blender. It worked well. I passed the recipe on.

Very mild flavor. If I make it again, I will amp up the seasonings to give it more taste.

I made up a zucchini soup recipe almost like this one.  Mine was based on veggies growing in my garden.  Instead of basil I use about 1/2 cup chopped cilantro plus I add a couple of cloves of garlic and omit the flour.  Then I blend all in the pot with an immersion blender.  I make tons of this in the summer and freeze it in freezer bags to eat all year.  It is low  calorie, low carb, and quite satisfying.

Once the zucchini is grated, the rest is easy.  Made it at the end of the season and froze it to eat on a cold winter's day.

I made it straight from the recipe and it was fabulous!  I was worried it would not be enough water, but it turned out perfectly.  the second time I made it I didn't have any basil, but did have fresh sage so I used that.  It was awesome as well! The third time I made it (yes, I liked it that much) I added some mushrooms to it just for a new spin.  I didn't use a blender, but instead used my immersible blender stick, which worked out perfectly. This is so yummy and light (if you use the milk, not the cream as other have suggested...)

Thank you KelseyJo.  Love it just as is - but tried it with 1 cup heavy whipping cream in place of 1 cup of milk.   YUMMMM!  Next time I think I'll try replacing both cups of milk with the cream.
