Fantastic!!! These were absolutely delicious, fancy looking cookies, but easy to make.  Wonderful with a cup of tea! After you mix the dough, you need to roll it into little 1 inch balls, and then press them down.  It wasn't mentioned in recipe.  Great for a special occasion!

These had a wonderful flavor, but they didn't turn out like I had imagined.  I didn't notice the review about pressing down the little dough balls so I just left them round and baked them (thinking they would spread out) but they didn't.  What I had were a bunch of little cookie balls.  

There was no way I could make a sandwich out of them since they were so puffy, so I got a little creative...I put the filling in a pastry decorating bag and piped little designs on the top of my cookie balls. They looked so cute, like little white truffles.  I will definetly make these again, and maybe change the food coloring color and decorate these with the filling on top since they looked and tasted so perfect.  I bet you could also keep them puffy and drizzle some melted white chocolate over them also.   

For the actual recipe my only minor changes were to use 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract instead of the 1 tsp of lemon (didn't have any on hand) and I also put about 1/2 tsp of lemon zest in the cookie dough (not just the "filling" - topping).  They were soooo tasty! 

I'm only giving 4 stars because the recipe did not mention shaping and flattening the dough balls.

These were really delicious. I brought them to work to share and everyone loved them. The next time I make them though, I think I'll roll them into 3/4" or 1/2" balls to make a smaller cookie that you just pop in your mouth. They were a little messy to take several bites of because of the confectioners sugar. Another note to those trying the recipe.. mine didn't spread at all in the oven (which is alright) Just to keep in mind .. the shape & size they are going in the oven will be the same coming out. Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed making these. Thanks to the reviewers who pointed out that you need to flatten the dough once rolled into balls. I didn't use the food colouring but the lemon juice made the frosting a nice colour anyway. I couldn't believe how good these looked when finished. Taste good too. Thanks

The cook recipes was bland, not nearly enough lemon flavor. I recommend chilling the dough before baking for better shaping.  Filling was like a goo, but flavorful. Confectioners sugar didn't hold to the sandwich.

The flavor and idea of these are great, but the recipe really needs to be more specific about the size. I made one inch balls which I flattened but they still came out thick. However I don't know if it's worth it to make them smaller because they were kind of messy to fill. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised at how the filling gelled and did not drip out when I took a bite. They hold up nicely so far, though I can't imagine trying to transport them.

Too labor intensive. Filling isn't thick and shoots out the side when you take a bite. Definitely not lemony enough and won't make again.

These are divine.  I shaped them into bite size pieces and flattened them out prior to baking.  This was my first attempted at a sandwich cookie so wasn't sure on how much filling to use per cookie (thought it might ooze out or something) so I didn't use very much.  Next time I will cram as much of the filling in as humanly possible because it was soooo good.  I also didn't worry about the icing powder on the top, they still looked lovely.  I will be making these again......very soon.

To be clear, I give the actual recipe 5 stars...the accompanying directions...not so much.  I followed the ingredients to a 'T' but was careful about the directions.  As others have said, whatever shape you put the cookies in to bake is the same they'll come out of the oven- they're not like chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies that you drop onto the sheet and they melt into circles as they bake.  
   I mixed up the cookie ingredients, then rolled the dough into a log about an inch and a half wide and about 15 inches long, wrapped that in plastic wrap, and stuck it in the freezer for about half an hour.  Once it came out, I sliced it somewhere between 1/4 and 1/8 inch thick then arranged those circles on the cookie sheet to bake.  I haven't tried it yet, but the dough seemed like it would be soft enough for a cookie press as an alternative.
   Also, if you're looking for softer cookies (as in, not cracker crumbs) don't be worried.  I took my cookies out of the oven as soon as I saw the first hint of browning (about 9 minutes)and was a little worried once they cooled that they were going to be crumbly and crunchy.  Once I added the filling, rolled them in powdered sugar, and boxed them up for the night, they really softened into wonderful yummy little sandwiches.  Definitely better after they had sat for a day.

These are just delightful! A little on the labor intensive side, BUT I made them as a birthday gift for a lemon lover, who I know will really apprciate them. My husband and I tasted the spoils before we shipped them off and were very impressed.   The first batch I made had a few of the cookies thin and crumbly around the outside edge, which makes them harder to work with. With the second batch I rolled very small balls, layed them on the sheet, then used my thumb to put a small valley in each one. This made them small enough to be able to pop them into your in one bite, keeping the confectioners sugar off your shirt and in your mouth, LOL.   The cookie dough itself is a little crumbly at first, but it warms in your hand as you roll it, so it holds together quite well.  For the filling, I juiced 3 lemons and replaced some of the water with it. I also added 3 large pieces of rind to the mix, which added wonderful depth of flavor, fishing them out after the mixture thickened. I also added a bit of California Lemon Peel, and a touch more corn starch than called for, as I like my filling fairly thick. I omitted the food coloring, as you can't see the filling once you roll them in confectioner's sugar.  We are having a summer party this year, and these will definitely be on the menu! Served with finger sandwiches, cold salads, lemonade and ice cream, they will not only look very pretty on the table, but will also round out the blend of flavors nicely!

i used a cookie scooper and a measuring cup to shape these, which saved time and gave me just 14 little sandwiches, and filling to spare. the cookies were not soft, and the filling was a strange texture, like thick transparent goop, nothing like a store sandwich cookie. the flavor was not bad, but not good enough to cover the texture conflict between the crunch and goo. it was really too much butter fat for me to enjoy the lemon. I prefer a light fluffy pairing with lemon, like the lemon blueberry scones on this site, which was SO much better than these.

I did what another commenter said and used fresh lemon juice and an extra tsp. of zest then rolled 1/4 inch balls and pressed in the center with my thumb. I also used an extra tblsp. of corn starch. The best lemon cookie I have ever had in my life!!!

These cookies wound up tasting delicious but I had to add quite a bit of water to the dough because it was very dry and crumbly.  I only used them as a single cookie which I topped with confectioners sugar and lemon zest.

Cookies were delicious and easy to make(only five ingredients). The only changes I made was adding 1 cup of confectioners' sugar (we like more sweet cookies) and 2 teaspoons of lemon flavor(I want more lemony flavor). I roll them into 1 inch ball and press them down in the cookie sheet( not completely flatten). I don't make sandwiches, I just dust them with sifted confectioners' sugar, and were simply delicious!!!

These were really easy and fun to make.  We used an ice cream scoop and the cookies came out way to big.  After putting them together they looked like baseballs. Next time I will use a smaller spoon. They still tasted really good though!!

I just made these for our family's 4th of July party, and they were a hit! My grandmother has already made note of it, and my Mom is hoping my grandmother will make them soon. LOL!

I made them a bit bigger than what was suggested in the recipe, so I got about 18 "sandwiches" out of it, with a lot of the filling left over. 
Next time, I suggest using unsalted butter (it didn't mention salted or unsalted in the recipe). I used salted butter and it was definitely noticeable. I also added about 1/4 tsp. of peppermint extract into the cookie dough. It gave it a mellow lemon-mint flavor which was a nice "cool" change to the hot weather.

Wonderful recipe, will definitely use it again!

Nice and lemony and light!  I liked how easy this one was and how quickly the cookies baked up but that early feeling was really decieving.  It was pretty time consuming after all was said and done but they are very cute and dainty.  One thing I would recommend is to make the cookies pretty small and be sure to flatten them enough.  Otherwise they'll end up like thick biscuits with lemon filling.

These are very tasty. The dough is like a shortbread recipe and quick to make. I followed the previous reviewers' advice and pressed the dough down after rolling into equal-sized balls. My only problem was that the filling did not thicken. I put it in the fridge even; but still only had a runny fluid. Because of this, I don't think my final product was how it should have been. I will make these again, but try to make the filling thicker. I also think they would be delicious with a raspberry filling!

These cookies are basically a lemon flavored shortbread with lemon meringue pie filling sandwiched in between. 

I don't know that the recipe submitter intended for them to be "sandwiches": they're snowdrops.  So if you want them round little balls, don't flatten them. That way they roll really nicely in powdered sugar, kind of like wedding cookies.

If you do flatten them, though, I'd suggest just dusting them with sifted powdered sugar--prettier that way and less of a mess.

They were absolutely delicious.... perfection!  Only thing I would say is to pat down the batter when you put it on the cookie sheet b/c the way you put them in the oven is the way they turn out and if the cookies are too big, it is hard to make a sandwich out of them.  My second batch turned out a lot better than my first!

Wow! These cookies are awesome. Keeping them small is a good idea, they're great to just pop in your mouth! I'd really recommend using the lemon extract, though. I tried just lemon juice & they weren't lemony enough, but they were still fantastic, will definitely make again!

I made this recipe for a group of my co-workers and they loved it.  A nice change from the standard cookies I usually make.
