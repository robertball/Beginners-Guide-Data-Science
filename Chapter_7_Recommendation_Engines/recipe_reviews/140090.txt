These turned out pretty dry. I think next time I will use 2-2 1/2C flour and use the rest for rolling and cutting out the dough. I think using 1/2 C butter and adding 1 tsp. vanilla might be better as well :)

these scones were amazing!  i followed the previous poster's advice and used 1/2 cup butter and 1 tsp vanilla.  i used dried blueberries instead of dates, and added 3/4 cup walnuts, as well as the chocolate chips.  by accident i doubled the cinnamon but it turned out perfect!  super soft and hearty but sweet.  more like a breakfast cookie.  we will definitely make these again!

not bad... a little on the bland side but that could have been me.....  added a little extra butter and fresh out of the oven right now.... pretty moist... i did add also a touch more milk, figuring since you need to kneed it on a floured surface it could get dry.....  i will save this for sure and be making it.... pictures to follow....

Hearty and wholesome. I did not have dates, but instead substituted with what I did have: blueberries (1/4 cup), cranberries (probably two tablespoons!) and chocolate chips (1/2 cup). They taste great, not too sweet, had them with homemade whipped cream sweetened with honey. Delicious!

Delicious! I did added some more butter and milk and they were just moist enough! I like that they were not overboard sugary too.
