This is a very good basic/starter recipe, however you do need to alter it a bit. Due to having to alter it, I would have given it 4 ½ stars if it was an option but it’s not. It was a must to read others reviews for they gave very good insight as how to turn this into a 5 star recipes. I did add a few of my own ideals though.

2 cans of soup is a must (I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cheese soup).
4 slices of bread is also a must.
I stirred fried my chicken with garlic and pepper instead of using the microwave and no garlic.
I added 1 cup of chopped onion, 2 cups of frozen broccoli and increased the cheese to 3 cups, using ½ in the mixture and the other half on top of the bread cubes. I also poured melted butter on top of the bread topping.

This was a big hit with my husband. This is a great Sunday dish for you can pre-mix it and place it in the fridge until you get home from church, and then all you have to do is bake it and fix a side salad. It is also very good for a potluck dinner.

Reading the reviews is a must. I make this and it is really tasty - but I use one can of cream of chicken and one can of southwestern pepperjack cheese soup (campbell's). I also mix in a 4 oz can of diced green chile peppers, a little bit of milk  and plenty of shredded cheddar and an additional cup of shredded pepper jack cheese. Oh I also increase the rice amount and use the amount of 2 cups of rice precooked. I top the dish with crumbled ritz crackers. My boyfriend (who turns up his nose at all casseroles) asks for seconds and looks forward to having the leftovers for dinner the next night.

I can't say I would've enjoyed this as published, but I can't leave ANY recipe as is.  However, this is definitely a keeper.  BEGINNING COOKS: Save this in your favorites!  This is a perfect base - some meat, some rice, a can of soup and a generous sprinkle of cheese.  Adjustments and additions are to be made according to taste (IE: herbs, spices, veggies, type of meat, flavor of soup, etc...). Viola!  Dinner is served.  My changes: I was out of almost all my cheeses so I combined them - five in all; seasoned the rice water with chicken boullion; seasoned the chicken with boullion, chives, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder; buttered both sides of 2 slices of bread, cubed it and placed on top.  Oh, and the reviewer who strongly suggested using your Pyrex for this - absolutely.  Cheese and metal are not the best of friends.

It's great! After reading other reviews, I made these adjustments: added 1 extra can of soup, 3/4 c. milk, and 1 c. broccoli to the mix (I also added 1 c. of the cheese into the mix, and topped with the other half). I topped with a sprinkling of butter on the breadcrumbs. My husband said this was absolutely the best and most simple recipe we've tried yet. As-is the recipe is 4-star, but make some adjustments and it's 5-star all the way!

I added 1/2 cup sour cream with the Cream of Chicken Soup and mixed more cheese into the casserole too.  Topped w/ a box of seasoned croutons I had on hand (instead of the bread cubes) for more crunch.  DELICIOUS comfort food that's fast & easy to prepare!!

I recommend that you read all the reviews before making this recipe.  As this was my first time on this site/using a recipe I didn’t and I lived to regret it.   If I had read them I would have seen that there are many suggestions on how to save this recipe.   This dish is very bland – I even thought so as I was making it but thought there was almost 5 stars applied to this dish so it must be good.  Unfortunately it was not, at least for my family and my tastes…  I can say it was a good lesson on how to use this site… read reviews… all of them!

I used a little more rice than the recipe called for so I added an extra can of soup.  I used Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup along with 98% fat free Cream of Chicken.  Also used sharp cheddar cheese, skipped the bread cubes and used crushed crackers on top. I followed the suggestion of adding a can of diced green chilis to the rice, chicken and soup mixture.  I think that is what made this recipe so flavorable otherwise it might have been to bland for us. It had just enough kick for my hubby and me, but was mild enough for our 9 year old who went back for seconds! My picky hubby who is not a casserole fan said this was a keeper.

Made this as is, and as is, it's OK but not too exciting really.  Though it was easy.  Bliss makes a very good point -- people see all those stars and assume the recipe is good, because people give stars for CHANGES they've made.  (There's a lot of five's around this place for salvaged recipes.) I didn't see the point of the breadcrumbs at all -- they added nothing and just created more work.

I made this tonight with canned chicken (all we had) 4 cups of rice and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  It was good.  It was a recipe that served it's purpose.  To make a fast meal with the ingrediants on hand.  Don't make if you want something that tastes fancy.  But if you came from simple homes as a kid and you ate alot of "throw together, what ever is in the cabinet foods" this is for you.  It tasted better than I expected.  In fact it tasted like chicken ala king that you get from school when it is all mixed together. (I liked school lunches).  And the toasted bread on top is great, just drizzle some melted butter on the top before cooking.  Thank you for this easy and makeable meal we all enjoyed it alot.

This is good with all the changes made. After reading reviews I changed the following: -cooked the chicken in skillet adding little garlic salt and pepper for flavoring -Use 2 cans of soup, one cream of chicken and one cheese soup -Use 4 slices of bread and butter both sides before cubing -Add 1-2 cups of broccoli (cooked or frozen not raw) -Increase cheese to 3 cups with 1/2 in the mixture and other half on top of the bread cubes.

I added 1 cup of onions, 2 cups broccoli, 1 can cheese soup, doubled the Cheddar cheese (using half in the recipe and half on top)and didn't use the bread at all.  I had to leave it in the over for about 10 minutes longer, then turn on the broiler to brown the cheese a little.  This is the best casserole I've ever had, with those modifications!

This is a great basic recipe.  I used two cans of soup (cream of chicken and cheddar cheese) and increased the rice to 3 cups.  I cooked the chicken with garlic salt, onion powder and pepper.  I also used crushed Ritz crackers with melted butter for the topping.  Everyone loved it!!

This is a nice, simple casserole dish.  I am so glad I read the comments from the other viewers!  I added/changed things up a bit as recommended.  I sautéed my chicken with 2 garlic cloves and added 1/4 teaspoon chkn bouillon seasoning.  I used 2 cans of crm of chkn, used the full amnt of the cooked rice, not only 2 cups.  Used 3 cups of cheese to add to the soup, rice and chkn mixture.  Added 1 lb of frozen broccoli.  After putting the mixture in a casserole dish, I topped with more shredded cheese, added a light layer of garlic powder, topped with the cubed bread, and drizzled with butter.  My husband and 1 1/2 year old liked it :)

Excellent! I made this for my boyfriend and myself. He normally turns his nose up at casseroles but he went back for seconds and he can't wait for me to make this recipe again! I did make a few changes though. Because it was just for the two of us I only used 1 cup of rice, to which I added a chicken bouillon cube for flavor. I only used 1 can of soup- but I added 1/2 a can of water to the mixture. The second time I made it I added some frozen broccoli which really gave it an extra layer of flavor.

WHOA, this recipe was EXCLLENT after adding in some extras of my own!  I took and added garlic powder w/ parsley flakes, chopped onion,and diced carrot.  I thought this made it more a a "Meal". I made up 3 c. of rice, added cut up 2 chicken breast that I had leftover whole chicken that I boiled and deboned the day before. It was plenty of chicken! I made up rice in my rice cooker.   Since I only used 2 cups of rice, I kept the rest as leftover for adding later to another recipe.

I'm rating this a 4 star only because of the additions I made.  I sauted the chicken in onion, garlic & butter.  I also added an extra can of soup, 1/2 a package of broccoli, an extra cup of cheese (we're big on cheese) and toped it w/Italian flavored bread crumbs instaed of plain bread.  Very yummy!  My husband loved it and my picky 4yo son asked for seconds!  Will definately make again.

This was delicious! We just finished eating and liked it a lot. My husband says we should add this one to the rotation. I followed other advice and added some green bell pepper, 2 tbsps milk, and dashed in some garlic. Turned out excellent. I like how it's pretty basic and leaves a lot of room for add-ons and variations. Glad I tried it!

Excellent comfort food!  My 11-year-olds request this now.  I find that using extra-sharp white cheddar helps give it a bit more flavor.  Also needs 2 cans of soup instead of one.  One of these days I'll probably try adding some frozen broccoli or green beans to it for color and veggies.

Ok, this is an edited review!  I have been making this for YEARS but never make it exactly the way the recipe states as I did once and it turned out pretty bland.  But, this is a great base recipe to expand on!  I always add a can of cheese soup - sometimes cheddar cheese & sometimes pepper jack cheese.  I also use crushed ritz crackers mixed with some melted butter to top it with.  I make Charlies Mexican Style Meat, also on this site, and use chicken instead of beef & double the recipe for all sorts of dishes - and this chicken & rice casserole is one of my favorite things to use the meat in.

I have made this several times, once as the recipe says and then once with a few additions.  I also added an extra can of chicken broth--and used more bread for the top (the best part!).  Fantastic recipe, thanks for a keeper!

This was so good. I had 2 helpings and that rarely happens. My husband even approved. My 3 year old liked it well she will eat anything with cheese in it. I made it the night before. Wow what an easy dinner. Thank you for sharing with us.

THis was not so great. This seem like it would be just as good as cooking the rice and chicken seperately on top of the stove. THen eatting them together.

I took some of the reviews and tweaked this accordingly. I used brown rice, cream of broccoli soup, and a cup of sour cream. Even my 5 year old son (who was afraid to try it)liked this. It was simple and easy to make.

This recipe was great.  My family loved it!  I did alter it a little as well, though.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup along with the cream of chicken.  I also mixed in some minced onion with the soup mix and also drizzled some melted butter on the bread cubes.  But we all thoroughly enjoyed it.

This was Really Good! I took it to a fellowship and they all commented on this dish. I loved it and my hubby said it was a keeper. I just did as someone else did and sauted the chicken with minced garlic and onion and slat and pepper. I also added one more can of cream of mushroom soup and added more cheese. I also used Italian Bread crumbs instead. I also added Broccoli. Thanks for the Recipe and Great Ideas.

I cooked this casserole for my husband's whole family, mom & dad, grandma and sisters. Everyone was ranting and raving about how good this was. My opinion was exactly the same. I loved it! And I couldn't believe how easy it was to make and yet so tasty. It was a huge hit with my family. It's highly suggested!

I've made this time and time again for several years ago, and it's been my comfort food a choice. My best friend begs me to make this every time I see him! But I did make changes. I add a good half a cup of chopped onion, sauteed until translucent, low-sodium chicken broth to cook the rice, and I sprinkle cheddar cheese on top rather than bread crumbs.

My family enjoyed this but as reviewed by others I also added a few additions. I did microwave the chicken w/S&P and Garlic. Then used 1 can cream of chicken and added 1/2 cup sour cream and 2 tablespoons of mayo and 1/2 cup of milk and some garlic and more pepper. Next time I will add broccoli and some more garlic powder to the mix to give it more punch.  I also used aldi brand ceasar croutons which are the cheapest and the best croutons for any ceasar salad vs. any name brand we have ever tried.  We will be adding this to our monthly calendar. Especially in these midwest winter months ahead it definetly was comfort food for a house full of Foodies!

This was a good, easy recipe.  I took others advice and added a can of cheese soup---I happened to have southwest pepper jack cheese soup so I added that, 1/2 can of milk, a can of black beans, some frozen corn and some Emeril's southwest essence and it was tasty.  I put the bread on top, but next time if I make it southwestern  I would put crushed tortilla chips on top.  Even the kids liked it!

Very quick and easy! Don't forget to cut the chicken before you cook it or it will take longer! Or else begin with defrosted chicken! I added 3 celery stalks slivered/diced, and about 2/3 cup of almonds and mixed those in before I added the cheese/bread. Sometimes I mix in some extra shredded cheese too and then put the 2 c. on top to melt! :)

This was really good.  I added used a can of cheddar cheese soup and a can of cream of mushroom.  I also added 2 cups of chopped broccoli and a cup of chopped onion.  It turned out well.  I crumbed ritz crackers over the top instead of using the bread and sprinkled them with cheese 10 minutes before taking it out for the oven.

I poached the chicken in chicken broth with lots of spices and garlic.  This was really easy.

I made this for my picky boys and it was delicious!  I just made some adjustments.  I used cream of garlic roasted mushroom soup and also added one can of milk.  I used an already store bought roasted chicken that had its own seasonings in it and used four pieces of cubed bread instead of three - on top of the cubed bread I drizzled melted butter and sprinkled garlic on top!  Awesome!!!! very tasty!!!

I have made this numerous times, and I would have given it five stars, but I did make some of the changes other reviews suggested.  Two cans of soup is a must.  Also, I used crushed up crackers (Ritz-type) with a little melted butter mixed in for the topping instead of the bread.  I added about 3/4 of the cheese in the mix, along with about 1 tsp of garlic powder.  I have made it with cream of mushroom soup, too, and it is just as good.  My whole family enjoys this, including my picky five year old.  Overall, a good dish for a quick weeknight supper, especially if you have cooked rice and chicken on hand!

Next time I think I'll take out the chicken, add in veggies and make this a vegetarian dish.  Very cheesy and tummy-warming! I halfed this recipe because I'm cooking for one and have enough leftovers for tomorrow's lunch!

The variations on this dish seem numerous - I pan fried/browned the chicken breasts and used a Mexican rice mix (which has corn, peppers, etc. in it)  Couldn't be easier - my picky toddler loved it.

Reading the reviews is a must for this recipe.  I almost didn’t and I know I would have regretted it. I got lots of great ideas from reading the reviews and my casserole turned out great. Using two cans of cream of chicken is a must. I added a half cup of milk. I also cooked the chicken up in a skillet instead of the microwave. I added garlic powder, frozen broccoli, carrots, and corn to the mixture. I used cheese in the mixture as well as on top. Using 4-5 pieces of bread is a must. I also used butter on the bread which I think made it taste better. This recipe would be a five star recipe if the changes weren’t needed, but they most definitely are.

This pleased everyone so well I made it twice in one week.  I followed others advice and used 2 cans of soup and I used some milk also.  I love broccoli so I added some to the mix and I used plenty of cheese.  It was a great suggestion to butter the bread so they came out crunchy and flavorful.  I would highly recommend this casserole because it pleased my super-picky vegetarian daughter!!  Bon appetit: )

Good basic recipe, a bit bland. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, added onions, some frozen veggies to make a more complete meal, also I added some garlic and rosemary. I omitted the bread, the whole bread on top I'm not crazy about I prefer just cheese. My family enjoyed it and it was no leftovers, its a good recipe with a few additions to take the taste level up.

This is a great recipe, with a little tweaking to make it one's own. My family never eats white rice, so I used brown rice instead, seasoned. I also used cream of mushroom soup instead and seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt instead of salt and pepper. It was a huge hit!

I enjoyed this recipe very much. I did make a few changes as well. I used 1 1/2 cans for Cream of Chicken/Mushroom, diced onions. 

Instead of just having a shredded cheese i made a Roux with Sharp Cheddar/Monterey Jack/Pepper Jack. It adds a little bit more creamy chesseyness. 

If anyone else does this let me know how you like it.

I use this when I need something fast and easy to cook, and don't have much in the fridge.  I almost always have chicken in the freezer and cheese.  I keep a can of soup for this recipe at all times.  Rice is a staple in this house, and there are always a few crusts of bread around!  My picky kids LOVE it!  I do season the chicken with chicken seasoning and stir every 3 minutes, for a total of 8 or 9.

quick and easy to make.  We used cheddar soup instead of chicken soup, but next time we will use chicken soup because it was way too salty using the other.  We also used more rice, which we liked.

I tweaked this recipe a bit and it turned out great.  Instead of microwaving the chicken I cooked in on the stove and seasoned with paprika and poultry seasoning.  Then used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of chicken & mushroom soup.  I put 1/4 of the cheese in the mixture and the rest on top.  Then tossed the bread cubes in a little butter before cooking.

This recipe is pretty bland as-is, but it's definitely quick and easy, and good for a beginning cook like myself. I added crumbled bacon on top and that gave it some nice flavor. Next time I will definitely follow suggestions from other reviews such as more cheese and spices.

This was really good - I made it on a snow day and it was great comfort food!  I did make a few adjustments.  I only had 3 chicken breasts so that's what I used, and I simmered them in chicken broth with lots of different seasonings.  A lot of people were saying to use two cans of soup, but I only had one so once I poured the soup in I filled the can halfway with milk and added it, along with some extra cheese to the mixture as well.  I also crumbled some butter crackers under the bread cubes, and poured a little melted butter over the top of the bread.  Delicious!

With a few changes this is definitely a five star recipe. Save it to your favorites for sure. I cooked the chicken on the stove with salt, pepper, and paprika. I cooked the rice in chicken broth and also added chopped onion and frozen broccoli to the mixture. I used two cans of soup and 1/4 cup milk as many others suggested. Lastly I used more cheese and mixed half of it in the casserole and the other half on top. For the bread crumbs I mixed them with 2 Tbsp melted butter. Great meal!

I too added shredded Cheddar cheese, but I found that if I add celery salt, it makes it amazing and using day old hamburger buns and drizzling them with extra virgin olive oil, they toasted up even better and added even more flavor!

OK, this is a great beginning. To "kick it up a notch" try adding some sliced water chestnuts, extra sharp Cheddar (3 cups instead of 2), an additional can of soup (Cheddar cheese soup or cream of celery), some milk or mayonnaise to make it more creamy, cooked broccoli, and some curry powder. Also, saute the chicken in strips with onions and chopped celery in oil or butter first, sprinkled with a little curry powder. Then mix it all together well with the broccoli and rice.  Put it into a glass casserole dish.  Top it with crushed Ritz crackers  which have been coated with melted butter.  Bake until bubbly.

I took the advice of previous reviews. I used 1 can Cream of Mushroom, 1 Can Cheddar Cheese Soup. Added 1 can of sliced mushrooms, used brown rice instead of white. 1 cup of Cheddar cheese mixed in, sliced muenster (needed to use it up) on top, then topped with Ritz cracker crumbs. I thought it was way too cheesy, but my husband loved it.

I'm giving this three stars simply because this recipe is a good starting point, but needs more. I added a medium onion (chopped), two cloves of garlic (minced), some parsely, a 8 oz. container of sour cream, a bag of frozen mixed veggies, and a shake of Mrs. Dash. I also omitted the bread crumbs. I still think next time I'd like to add something else for a bit more kick (my husband and I are thinking some mustard to give it a bit of tang), but it was still pretty good the way we made it. I also baked it for 20 minutes at 375 instead of 350, which worked out well. If nothing else, it's a good starting point for making a casserole to your liking.

I loved this recipe! It was so easy to prepare and my family loved it! Instead of microwaving the the chicken I sauted it in butter and seasoned the chicken with garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper.  Then I cut it up into bite size pieces.

My proven standby. It's quick, easy and delicious. Instead of using bread cubes, I crush Wheat Thins on top of the cheese topping. It adds an good crunch to the meal.

My husband and I found this too heavy and a bit bland for our taste.  Not bad, but not our style.  We wouldn't make again, and this was with following previous suggestions to use one can cream of chicken and one can cheddar cheese.

This was delicious.  I also did as other reviewers, I used a can of cream of ckn. soup 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and 1 cup milk, and added broccoli and garlic powder.  I didn't cook my ckn. beforehand. I put my ckn. brsts. on top of rice mix, sprinkled w/bread crumbs and baked at 375 for 45 min.  I will definitely have again.

I did two cans of cream of chicken soup and 3/4 cup of milk.  I also put butter on top of the bread crumbs...but this is where we really went wacko - we put some salsa on the top after we dished it up and then I crumbled tortilla chips and added a dollup of sour cream.  WOWSER!  There must be another recipe for something like that.  My kids were happy with the "basic" recipe and my husband and I really LOVED the additions we added.  Yum

I followed the recipe exactly and I should have known when the only spices were salt and pepper. This was incredibly bland and even though my husband and I tried to desperately save this dish by adding garlic powder, parsley and other spices, it had already sunk. This dish was completely unsaveable. That is saying a lot because my husband is known for being a human garbage disposal. 
I don't even think it's worth the other reviewers advice in adding this or that - it's -that- bad.

I followed the advice of others and added brocolli and milk.  I added one can of milk and used 4 slices of bread for the topping.  I also added 12 of the cheese into the soup mixture and put the other 12 on top.  My suggestions?  Use atleast 4 pieces of bread for the top.  Add atleast 1 can of milk (use the can from the soup).  Also... I suggest that you mix your soup mixture OUTSIDE of the main dish before combining with the rice and chicken.  That way you soup, milk and cheese mixture is thoroughly mixed before mixing with the rice and chicken (trust me... that 9x13 pan gets filled).

I love this recipe!  It's fast, easy, and delicious!  Everyone that I make it for loves it.  My variations to the recipe: I use two cans of cream of chicken soup instead of just one. And I also added some frozen broccoli.  Yummy Yummy!  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  Highly recommended!!

This was terrific!  I was skeptical about the bread cubes - my husband wanted to use crumbs instead - but they added a nice texture and taste to the dish.  This is now on my list of comfort food!  The only drawback was having to cook the chicken and rice first, adding to prep time, but the taste was delicious!

This being my first review after 2 years of using this site, let me say WOW! I never thought a casserole could be so delicious,  but this was a huge hit at my house! Now for my additions, I substituted the bread for a mixture of butter and bread crumbs to give it a crunchy crust, and added a half cup of habenero cheddar to the existing cheese for a cheesier kick that was...well, simply astounding. I highly recommend this for family sinners, celebrations, or even middle of the week dinners!

After reading the reviews I altered recipe as well.  I used chicken from rotisserie chicken, added garlic and onion powder and added 1 cup of light sour cream.  I also used short grain brown rice instead of white rice as well as reduced fat cheddar and healthy request chicken soup.  I do weight watchers and a 1 cup serving was 12 points with the substitutions.

This was pretty basic and nothing real special.  I think adding extra flavor would enhance it greatly.

I used 2 bags of the boil-in-a bag rice and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  I also used a little more cheese.  With my adjustments I would give it more than 4 stars. My 2yr old and husband leave no leftovers!

Good Recipe!! This was good and a variety to our usual meals! I did not alter the recipe this time, but next time I plan on adding more seasoning and probably peppers and onions, and sour cream for extra creaminess.

Like other reviewers, I, as well, made a few changes.  I used 2 pkgs of chicked-flavored prepared rice, one can of condensed cream of mushroom, one can of condensed chedder soup.  I also omitted the bread cubes and shredded cheese.  I topped with French's dried onions for added flavor and crunch (added halfway through baking).  I added about 2 cups of frozen brocolli as well.  Big success!  Thank You!

My husband is a rather picky eater and he loved this dish!  It was simple to make and my almost 3 year-old enjoyed helping too.  I could even feed bits of the rice to our 9 month-old.  A great choice!   We used torn up plain bagels on top instead of white bread for a different twist, and low fat cheese.

This is a good base to use, and you can customize it to what you have on hand.  Written as is, needs a bit more seasoning at the very least.  Nice quick meal.

A sure fire kid pleaser! Do add an extra can of soup. I make this about twice a month. The 19 yo even suggested it for supper tonight! I have thrown it together with multiple variations and made it straight from the recipe. All good, and never any leftovers. For twist on the basic version change cheeses or use stuffing. I am thinking about substituting potatoes for the rice any one tried that yet?

This recipe was pretty good... but I had not checked the others comments first, which would've helped I believe.  I had to use a can of chicken gravy instead of the cream of chicken and I added a small can of mushrooms... also I sprinkled onion powder over the entire casserole before adding the cheese and bread crumbs which really helped the flavor.  I think putting half the cheese mixture into the casserole and only half on top would've been better.

This was a great dish! I thought it was pretty easy to make. I did make a few changes after reading the reviews. I sauted the chicken with a little butter a minced garlic. I also cooked my rice in chicken broth instead of water to give it more flavor. I used a can of cream of chicken soup and cheddar soup. I added that to the chicken mixture to heat it a little. This made it easier to mix in the rice. I also used plain bread crumbs instead of the cubed white bread. It was a great hit at my house and my boyfriend wants me to make it again!

As others have said, this is a good base recipe that you can adjust to your own taste.  I cooked the chicken in a pan, instead of the microwave, and seasoned with a pasta/pizza spice mix I have.  Then, I sauteed garlic and spinach in the brownings from the chicken pan.  I used brown rice instead of white, and cream of mushroom instead of the cream of chicken.  When I mixed everything together, I sprinkled a little more of the pasta/pizza spices and some garlic salt in the pan.  Finally, I used a nice soft rye bread from Great Harvest for the cubed bread, and drizzled olive oil on top.  As the recipe goes, I gave it a 4, but with my modifications, for us, was a 5.

I rated it a 5 star because the way I made it, came out excellent!!! I used 2 cans of soup: 1 chicken soup and 1 mushroom soup. Instead of cooking the chicken in the microwave I cooked it in a skillet, used 2 tbs of veggie oil and cooked it until white on both sides then added: salt, black pepper, minced garlic, garlic salt, and onion powder. The chicken came out excellent with so much flavor. I also used not only sharp chedder but 4 cheeses. I did use the bread crumbs but sprinkled it with butter and I put italian bread crumbs too. My whole family loved it and my fiance ate all of my left overs ;-)

Excellent!  After reading the reviews, I added an extra can of soup (Cheddar cheese), some onion powder, seasoned salt, & garlic powder to the chicken. I also added extra shredded Cheddar cheese to the top with the bread chunks, which were some homemade Italian bread that I had made the night before. Family says we're keeping this one!

This has become a new favorite for me and my husband.  It's quick and easy.  I stir-fry the chicken with a little garlic salt and pepper and drizzle butter over the bread.  Also, it definitely does either need more soup or less rice- I usually just decrease the rice to 1 1/2 cups since it's just the two of us.  Otherwise- really delicious...and simple.

This recipe has become one of my family's favorite comfort food dishes. Out of necessity once we made it with cream of mushroom instead of chicken, and it was so good we've made it that way ever since! I also like to add some lightly sauteed garlic from time to time. Overall, a great family dish even the kids will eat.

Even with fairly major adjustments, most of which were already mentioned by other reviewers, this recipe was just not exciting or unique and was not even as good as some boxed (yes, gasp, boxed) dinners we have made.  It definitely needed 2 cans of soup and double the cheese too (we love cheese).  I also added onions and green chili.  This helped, but again, not what I was looking for.

This recipe is so easy to make and delicious.  I substituted 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream and fat free cream of chicken for the can of full fat cream of chicken.  I also used low fat cheedar.  It was still very rich and filling!  I don't recommend fat free as it will not melt well and can be quite rubbery.

I added chopped carrot, celery, onion and garlic, browned in a little butter.  Also 1/2 cup sour cream to the chicken soup mix.  The recipe is a good base but needed more flavors.

This was okay, but very bland. It was a bit too thick and heavy. Next time I'll trying adding a few things to it.

Easy and quick, but pretty bland. Definitely needs something more... maybe some sliced mushrooms, garlic, a little diced onion. I will have to try that next time. I think with some changes it would've been better.

I thought this was pretty good, I added cream of mushroom soup with the cream of chicken and also added some cooked broccoli.  And I also topped mine with crushed ritz crackers on top of the cheese.  My husband LOVED it!

This was okay for chicken and rice.  I might try the salsa and chips idea next time.  Try adding more soup if you don't like plain rice spots!

I liked this recipe alot!!! I used bagged frozen already prepared chicken breasts, and even though it took a little longer to cook the chicken than I thought, it turned out great. I also seasoned the chicken with soul seasoning and added milk to the chicken and rice mixture. I let the casserole cook for about 15 mins. and then added a little more cheese to the topping. Thanx Lee, my family loved this recipe, and we will definately have it again!!!!!

This recipe was a little bland. The second time I made it and added more bread to the top and a can of cheddar cheese soup to the rice and it added a little more flavor. Although I must say I really enjoyed the bread topping. Very different and very good.

Pretty tasty with a little tweaking. I added some seasonings and like other reviewers suggested, I added another can of soup (cheddar cheese soup). I also added another slice of bread.

This was very good.  I used 2 cans of soup (and still felt it could of used more...).  I think next time I will stir in a cup or so of cheese in the soup and rice mixture, then also top with cheese.  The bread cubes were OK... but maybe try regular bread crumbs that you can buy in the can at the store.  My husband loved this dish.  Thanks Lee!

Everyone in my family really liked this recipe.  I just browned the chicken in my big skillet, added the rice, soup (with a little milk), and sprinkled the cheese and bread on top.  I can put my skillet in the oven so I popped it in the oven and ta da!  Great recipe!

It was plain, not a lot of flavor.  Once we added some salsa, my husband liked it much better.  I thought it was ok, but it was bland.  and the bread cubes, I didn't care for that.

This recipe was so easy to whip together plus having all the ingredients on hand was a plus.  I was a bit disappointed on the taste though.  Dry and unflavorful.  The next day I turned the dish into a cheesey flavorored chicken and rice soup by adding chicken broth.  I can't leave it alone now.  Very good!

This is a quick and easy recipe to make.  My husband and I love it!  I think just about any cream soup would work.  Also, I used a comination of Colby and Monterey Jack cheese instead of Cheddar and it was even better!

I used two cans of soup and a tad more cheese, plus some garlic powder for flavor. (and more than 3 slices of bread because I cubed up a couple hoagie rolls that were gonna go stale.) I split the recipe into two 8x8 dishes and baked for 35 min but the cheese never got bubbly. It was bland, as many other reviewers also pointed out, but not hopeless so I might tinker with it in the future.

Definitely read other alterations....everyone has altered this recipe a little differently. I personally liked the one that uses 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cheddar soup.  I also dried my bread a little before putting butter on it. I laid the pieces of the buttered bread on top then sprinkled cheddar cheese over it. I did not add any cheese in the mix. I personally don't think it needed any more cheese than the can of cheddar soup mixed in. Preparing this recipe was a little time consuming but I should be able to prepare this in 30 minutes now that I have made once. I will make this again...

I do like this recipe. I have used it for years. I use 2 cans of soup though to make it nice and creamy. Extra cheese, some mixed in is always tasty as well.

I have a little experience with recipes like this one...basic but great ingredients to build on. I used 2 cans of diced chicken, about a cup of sour cream (or plain yogurt),  the can of cream of chicken soup, rice (about 2.5 cups)...I then used some celery seed, Beau Monde seasoning,  garlic salt w/parsley, and diced onion or dried onion.  I mixed these all together and put them in the 9x13 pan.   The 2 cups of cheese were spread over the chicken mixture, but for a topping I used 1 cup of breadcrumbs mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted butter.    Same cooking time, 350 for 20 minutes and voila a yummy dish to call your own. :)

Read all reviews and changed the recipe up a bit. Cooked the chicken in a TBs of butter with added garlic and onion powder then added to rice 1 can of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of extra water with 1 bouillon cube added and 1/2 can of nacho cheese spread. This came out wonderful.  Thank you for a basic recipe to follow!

I also used bouillon to flavor the rice water as well as other spices on the chicken when frying it. Added more cheese and diced green chiles too. Skipped the bread topping and it was a hit in my house. 4 stars as is... 5 with the modifications.

Just made this for the first time tonight. Following the posted recipe, I can only give it 3 stars.  It's hearty, and filling, just not much flavor.  And 1 can of soup really isn't enough.

I will make this again because it has the potential to be a very good dish.  Next time though I'm going to search through the other reviews to find ways to give it some flavor that it is missing as is.

This was great for my kids (3 & 4 year olds) who eat only bland dishes.  If they ate it up, then it was a huge success.  If cooking for only my husband and I, I would spice it up a bit.

The recipe would have been too bland as is.  I added a packet of onion soup mix and one cup of water.  Also, the chicken I used was leftover and had mushrooms and other spices that helped make this recipe good.

Great basic recipe. My changes were to add a can of cream of mushroom soup, a half can of milk, a cup of chopped broccoli, reduced the cheese to one cup and left out the bread cubes. My family salt and peppered to taste at the table and loved it. Hmm.. wonder if these changes just make it a different recipe after all :)

Just love this one! I replaced the cr. of chicken soup with mushroom because this is what is usually in my pantry and then i used ground chicken as it was also handy and then i added steamed broccoli and sauteed mushrooms and onions to the mix. and lastly we don't use white bread and so i cubed up a few slices of sourdough bread to put on top. this gets nice and crunchy and gives it a more unique taste. this is a new favorite in our family. never have to worry about any going to waste!

This recipe is pretty good, as long as you follow many of the other suggestions that have been provided by other reviewers.  I cook the meat in a saucepan with garlic, pepper and salt.  I also use a bit more topping.

Pretty good recipe!  I used what we had on hand, which was only 2 breasts of boneless chicken, and a can of soup that wasn't condensed.  I took others' recommendations and spiced the chicken with garlic salt and parsley - cooked it in the microwave and it turned out fine.  We also had to use some water crackers we had on hand instead of bread cubes.  A quick and easy yummy hot meal!

Just ok.  I wasn't a big fan but my husband and his friend were.  They ate the entire pan.  I may make again if I make some major adjustments.  Possibly omitting the Cream of Chicken entirely and replacing it with something else.

I gave this one 3 stars because I took all the other suggestions. But it's a good starter casserole. I added half a cup of sour cream and used monterry jack and colby cheese ( all I had), added fresh minced garlic, onion flakes and instant rice. I was worried about "microwaving chicken", but it came out surprisingly great. So easy and was a hit with my picky hubby and 2 yr old! Defintley a keeper

This is a good basic recipe. My fiance added salsa and he liked it better; I added onions and garlic and lked it better. It just seems to need a kick of some sort...

My family must not be casserole types, nobody but me liked it. Followed recipe exact and turned out as it should, just wasn't a hit. Won't be making this again - unless for myself. I ate the leftovers and still thought it was good.

Not great, but not bad, I found it a little bland, although my husband loved it. Added a tin of sweetcorn to the rice.

My husband and I and our 2 year old son loved this!  I prepared everything in the casserole dish the night before, and then just put it in the oven, making it quick and easy!  The toasty bread chunks on top gave it a great texture.  This will definitely become a regular for our family!

I followed the recipe exactly, before reading the reviews. I think it could have been a four-star recipe if I'd added a can of cheese soup along with the cream of chicken. Also, more bread in the topping and a little garlic powder to season the chicken would make this better. I will try it again, but with those changes.

This was great! Fast easy and really really good. I took the advice of others and added a can of milk and some frozen peas. I also split the cheese in half as well. I will be making this again on those busy nights.

This great recipe takes no time at all -- unless, like me, you don't follow directions sometimes and you mix in uncooked rice instead of cooked rice. It turned out ok in the end though -- I just added a little water to the mixture and baked the casserole a little longer.

Soooo easy already and I made it even easier by using minute rice and buying a precooked roasted chicken.  I added milk,broccoli and mushrooms and drizzled butter on the bread cubes. Yum.

Wow, what an easy recipe.  It was very tasty. I did not have any chicken on hand so I used a can of tuna.  I accidentally mixed the cheese into rice and soup instead of on top and it turned out great.  I did have add a little milk because it was so thick.

Just made this tonight.  It was awesome.  I did add about 3/4 can of milk with the soup, and used a Monteray Jack/Cheddar blend of cheese.  The bread cubes on top turned out golden brown, and were nice and crisp.  My kids loved it.  Will make this one often.

Whole family loved it! I personally added about 3/4 cup of milk to the soup, as it was very thick and the milk made it creamier. Great recipe!

I made this dinner last night for a couple that we are friends with.  It was the first time they had ever eaten over here, and I was very pleased that everyone enjoyed dinner.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of onion.  I don't think it made much of a difference.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thank you to the lady who shared this wonderful recipe!

My husband is not a big fan of recipes using cream soup but he really enjoyed this.  He especially liked the toasted bread on top of it.  I thought it was very good and am planning on making it again.  I made half a recipe and used an 8" baking dish for just the two of us.  I froze the other half of the soup for the next time I make it.  I also did as the poster suggested and made it ahead with instant rice...worked great!

This was good with extra slices of cheese on top of the bread crumbs.
