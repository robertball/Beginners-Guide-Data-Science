Absolutely delicious! I used button mushrooms because I had some that needed to be used and I omitted the white wine because I don't ever have it. I doubled the heavy cream and cooked until it reached a soft boil. I then added the chicken-mushroom mixture back into the pot and cooked until thoroughly warmed. Hubby came into the kitchen, tasted it and proceeded to serve himself before I had a chance to bake it! So we ate it that way and it was delicious!

As written, this recipe has the problem of too much liquid -- closer to a soup than a casserole. However, the flavor is excellent, so don't be too quick to write this one off. I think it could be a big success with the following changes: First, reduce the amount of chicken stock to just 1 cup, which would be plenty. While it's simmering, sprinkle in a little more flour until the sauce thickens. While it's in the oven, remove the foil for the last 10 minutes or so. Finally, consider serving it over something. We had it over egg noodles, and that was really delicious.

I love everything about it. It was easy and didn't take that long to make. I used small Portabella mushrooms, and a Merlot wine instead of white.  It was delicious! I will definitely make it again!

This was tasty but somewhat bland.  I sauteed the chicken with red pepper flakes, then added sliced onion along with the mushrooms and garlic.  Also added herbs de provence.  The finished dish had much more liquid in the dish than the picture, but we served it over rice so it worked out.

Fairly decent flavor. I was trying to use up some leftover grilled chicken. Feels like it's halfway to being a chicken & mushroom soup, just needs more broth/stock. I used more flour than called for to thicken to consistency that felt more like a casserole to me, otherwise a little too watery. Topped with butter fried sage leaves instead of parsley--a complementary flavor and nice textural add. Served over rice with a side of rainbow carrots. If I didn't have leftover chicken, I don't know that I'd go to this recipe again. But, I'll certainly consider again if I find myself with purposeless chicken!
