I made this last night and cut back on the amounts.  The chicken was very moist and did not seem sweet to me at all.  All in all a good recipe if you are in a pinch for making something for dinner and you have the ingredients on hand.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I added a bit of onion and garlic powder with a pinch of salt to the Jiffy mix.  I also brushed with a bit of butter and baked on a rack so the bottom would be crispy.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  My family loved the flavor.  I will make it again.

This has become a go-to recipe in my house. First time I made it as directed and it needed a bit of savory slicing to balance out the sweetness of the corn muffin. Added extra garlic powder and onion powder and a little more salt and pepper and balanced it out perfectly.

Delicious and simple. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and seasoned with a bit of garlic salt and onion salt for some extra flavor. I was skeptical, but it came out great!

Everyone loved this chicken I used  legs and thighs with skin and bone. I only used one box of Jiffy corn bread mix. I added 1 tablespoon of garlic powder and 1 tablespoon of onion powder +2 tablespoons of Private Selection Memphis inspired seasoning rub

I made this but only need one package of mix for about 8 thighs. I also added panko bread crumbs, plain cornmeal, onion & garlic powders & some salt because of other reviews. I baked it on a wire rack above a foil lined pan, which helped with the crispiness. I also drizzled with some olive oil. 
In the end, I was disappointed although my sweet tooth kids liked them. I agree that it's too sweet, and I'd probably just prefer seasoned breadcrumbs. 
If you're making specifically for bbq sauce, maybe it's a better match.

I had high hopes but this recipe was disappointing. Followed recipe exactly. I didn't care for the texture of the cornbread coating. No-one in my family of 6 enjoyed this. It was worth a try. Thanks anyway.

Loved it! (Like scrape the crumbs from the pan good). I didn’t change much to the recipe except add some Cajon seasoning salt, onion powder and garlic powder. It was baked in the oven per instructions but on a wire rack. Also I make sure to always rest chicken after coating until coating is slightly moist so it adheres to the chicken better. I did overnight but works after an hour or two.

I must admit I love Jiffy’s cornbread so I may be slightly biased.

I agree it was way too sweet.  It needed more spices in the mix to cut sweetness.

I am not a cook. I like to find easy and yummy recipes. This recipe was easy and amazing. The chicken isn't too sweet , and the corn muffin mix isn't as crunchy as I thought it would be. The kids haven't tasted it yet , but it's soooo good . I purchased the chicken breast from walmart & they came with tons of fat. Next time i'll get them from a different store. I definitely recommended this recipe for something quick and good . THUMBS UPPP ????????????????
