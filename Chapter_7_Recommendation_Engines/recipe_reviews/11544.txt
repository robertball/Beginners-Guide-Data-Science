Schweineohren is a typical German pastry. To get the authentic flavour, you need to brush the dough with melted butter, then sprinkle it with sugar. Without the butter the cookie is too dry!!

very simple and delicious. i drizzled with some icing. make sure to get these off the baking sheet as soon as they come out of the oven or else they will become permanently 'glued' to your baking sheet. i bet they would be good with cinnamon and sugar too.

I make these often. We call them "palmeritas" or "manitas" in PR and in Panama they are called "orejas". After I bake them I like to brush a glaze (honey w/ butter {1:1 or to taste}) on one side and sprinkle tiny nonpareils (grajeas)on them.

These are ridiculously easy and amazingly good!  I did borrow from other reviewers though.  I brushed the pastry sheets with butter and then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  After they came out of the oven, I brushed them with a 1-1 mix of butter and honey.  I was making them for our church coffee hour when my husband snagged one and then proceeded to sneak more!  Then my 9-year-old son got into the act and I ended up running back to the store for more pastry puff sheets!!!!!  A real keeper.  Thanks!!

VERY simple to make and very tasty. Not over the top. Simple flavor, just pastry and sugar, so if you are looking something with grand flavor, try a different recipe. I did however like this very much and so did my husband.

This is a 5 star recipe as is, but I gave it 4 because I made a few changes. I omitted the sugar and used strawberry preserves instead. Yummy. I have also brushed melted butter on pastry, then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, and another variation is I made with red pepper jelly as a savory appetizer.

Well, I would have included a picture but they were gone faster than 1..2..3..  Love these.  Fast easy, The only difference, I spread some melted butter before the sprinkle of some cinnamon & sugar. They were gone before the coffee in the cup. If you have a chance to make these, please do, you wont be disappointed. If you are worried about the amount of sugar, you really do not need to use alot, I barely used 1/4 cup and it was sufficient.

I used a knife and spread butter on the whole sheet, then cinnamon sugar. You can not really be "liberal" with the cinnamon sugar because it does not roll well. Using parchment paper leads to less sticking. When I took them out I drizzled honey-melted butter. 1-1 ratio.

Simple, light sweetness and the kids love it!  Tried it both ways- sugar, and cinnamon sugar to compare.  Both are great!  Thanks for posting.  :)

Brushed with butter before sprinkling with cinnamon and  sugar and they were delicious.  They are not fancy, but we needed something easy to delight a house full of kidoes and satisfy a craving for puff pastry.   We will make them again..

YUM! I have wanted to make these for so long, but for some reason never did...until today, and they were delicious! Very easy to make, smelled great while baking and super yummy! I sprayed the puff pastry w/ butter flavored cooking spray before adding the sugar, just to insure that it would stay in place. I will def be making these often! Thanks for sharing. :)

These cookies were okay.  They remind me of store-bought cookies that look a lot better than they taste.  Maybe I'm just not a fan of puff pastry though.  They were, however, extremely easy to make--I used coarse crystal sugar on mine.
