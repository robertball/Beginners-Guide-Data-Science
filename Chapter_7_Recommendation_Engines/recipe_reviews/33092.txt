This recipe had a very fun flavor that my husband and I enjoyed very much.  I did change it a little, instead of making it like a sandwhich I used Texas Toast, sliced a pocket into it and filled it using a sandwhich baggie with the corner cut off.  Just perfect!

Unfortunately, I only had white bread the morning I made this.  It was good, but I would rather have used oat nut or whole grain bread.  I also substituted strawberry jam for the raspberry jam.  Next time I would like to try substituting mascarpone for the cream cheese and trying different extracts, maybe adding a little more than called for.  Also, if you use fat free cream cheese, it will harden up a bit and almost seem curdled.

Oh Elisa.....how wonderful are these? I've never been a french toast fan, but when I saw this on the site, I just had to try it and we loved it. Reminds me of eating cream cheese and jelly sandwiches as a kid, but about a million times better. Total comfort food. Thanks!

This was a decent recipe and a great idea.  I made it this morning for Christmas breakfast for just my Husband and myself.  I used only three eggs insted of 5.  I made the usual adjustments to make it more nutritious and it came out very good.  We enjoyed it.

We loved it!  We added 2 Tbs. or so of white sugar to the cream cheese (whipped it up) then spread it on the bread slices.  We also used regular wheat bread and it was still good!

All I can say is "yummy"!  My husband even liked it and I was afraid it would be too sweet for him.  I used Raspberry Simply Fruit and it was delicious.

I thought there was too much almond extract! It gave me a strange aftertaste. I then used blueberry jam and added about 3 T. fresh lemon juice and about 1 tsp lemon zest to the cream cheese. Omitted the almond extract. It was amazing! The lemon offset the sweetness of the jam perfectly! I did need more egg/milk mixture!

Very tasty! I'll definetly be making this again, although I think next time I'll mix the cream chesse and the jam together and add some sliced fruit. This was so rich it didn't need any syrup, I just served it with a dusting of powdered sugar and some fresh berries.

I used real blueberries instead of jam and when they warm up in that cream cheese they are soo delicious!  Can't wait to try it with the raspberry and the strawberries.  MMMmmmm worth making again and again!  I did add some cinnamon and powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

I made a lot of changes to this.  First, I had white bread that needed to be used up so I used that instead.  Wheat would have been better but the white did the job.  I didn't measure anything (never do with french toast) and used fresh plum jam instead of raspberry.  It's what we had on hand.  I also always add a little salt, cinnamon and vanilla.  Also, I use oil instead of butter to cook french toast.  Dusted with powdered sugar and voila!  Very good!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was so, so good!! I used thin slices of french bread instead of normal bread. The only thing I would do differently is use vanilla instead of almond extract since my 4 yr old didn't care for the smell.

I REALLY tweaked this... I used thick slices of French bread, cut slits in them and stuffed them with strawberry cream cheese. They were excellent! Also, if you plan to make them with thick bread, it works better if you brush the egg mixture on each side of the bread instead of dunking it- it cooks better.

This was delicious!  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used grape jelly (it's what we had), 3 eggs (I only used 6 slices of bread), potato bread (again, it's what we had and it worked GREAT), vanilla extract instead of almond, and also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the milk/egg mixture.  Oh and I used 2 Tbs butter.  I know I made a lot of changes, but this recipe gave me a great start and I loved how mine turned out!  The cinnamon and nutmeg were a GREAT addition.  My husband said it tasted like something you would get at a fancy Bed and Breakfast :-)

Followed the recipe except used Texas toast. I thought this was okay but my husband seemed to like it very well. I thought the filling had a tart flavor that was a little overpowering for the toast. I would make this again with strawberry jam.

This was quite yummy and easy.  My family isn't big on raspberry so I had to use something else.  I tried peach and strawberry preserves.  Both were good, but I think the stronger flavor of strawberry (and I'm sure raspberry) worked better.  I would definitely make this again.

My husband enjoyed this, said he wouldn't mind it once or twice a year - it's too sweet to have often.  If I make it again, I'll reduce both the cream cheese and the jam. It's quite a lot of goo. I also won't use almond extract again - I found it far too strong and that's after cutting the amount by a third as it was! I'll use vanilla if I use any flavoring.    having read the review, I tried banana in one of the sandwiches - it was good but I don't think I'll do it again.

AMAZING! super easy and so good!  Next time I'll reduce the almond extract to 1tsp.  I only had plain old whole wheat sandwich bread, and it was still wonderful!

Delicious!  This was  just the recipe I was looking for.  I substituted the cream cheese with Mascarpone, an italian sweet cream cheese. and used homemade rhubarb jam and sprinkled it with confectioners sugar - yum!

I used leftover french bread to make this for the kids this morning.  They all ate it and said that it was good, but preferred just plain french toast.  The middle part, where the cream cheese is, was a little gooey, but had great flavor.  One of them topped it with peanut butter and said that it tasted like a PB&J sandwich.  The others didn't even add syrup because they said it was sweet enough without.  Still really good, and more than likely, something I will try again with other flavors of jam.

I made this as breakfast for dinner. I used whole wheat bread and grape jelly - that's the only kind i had on hand. I think it would be much better with a different kind of jelly. The kids only took one bite and wouldn't eat the rest. I enjoyed it. I used vanilla in place of the almond extract.

This was a delicious version of French Toast. I used Smuckers 100% All Fruit Blackberry. Also, I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla. Topped it with a touch of maple syrup. I usually use the Overnight Blueberry French Toast recipe from this site, but wasn't looking forward to that much work after a 17 hour shift yeswterday. This was much easier, and I think better. Next time I will try PBJ for my PB lovin' DH. Thanks ElisaW!

Very good. I added powdered sugar to the cream cheese which gave it a smoother sweeter consistancy. These freeze well too so you can make a big batch all at once and not worry about wasting them.

Very impressive recipe. My guests are always wowed! So easy to make too. I like to use fresh oat/grain bread from my local bakery. I let the sandwiches soak a minute or so in the egg mixture, otherwise they turn out too dry for my tastes if I do a quick dip. I'm not a big fan of sweet breakfasts, so this is right up my alley. Not very sweet at all! The almond extract is a nice touch! The last time I made this, I topped the french toast with strawberries that were macerated with a bit of brown sugar and amaretto. SO GOOD!!!

To be honest, I couldnt even try these because Im on the diet from hell. BUT, I made this for my son with the ingredients that I had on hand; Whole wheat bread and rasberry keylime jelly, and I also did some with sugar free stawberry jelly. I also added a touch of orange extract and sugar to the cream cheese mixture. We didnt use any syrup but I think whipped cream and powdered sugar would be perfect. He told me they were great and reminded him of filled donuts. Next time we might try them with lemon curd and see how that goes....Never used it before, but it sounds like a good idea..:))

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. 
I used to make regular french toast all the time but now I make this.
It's a really easy recipe and it turns out really well.

I made this for Mothers Day breakfast in bed and my mom loved it! I mixed the cream cheese with seedless boysenberry jam instead of doing cream cheese on one slice and jam on the other. The result was amazing. I had a lot of mixture left over so in the future I will make a smaller batch. I cut the crust off before cooking it and added a little powdered sugar with a dollop of whip cream on top. My Mom said she felt like she was eating gourmet. I will probably add more jam next time for a more fruity flavor. Loved it!

So good. I made it to the recipe, and it tasted a little like a cheesecake filling. The kids and the hubby loved it. Just a tip, serve with items that are not sweet.

I made this for the first time on Easter Sunday for brunch at my grandma's house. We have a huge family I used a entire loaf of regular white bread because the store didn't have much else for some reason. I also used strawberry cream cheese just to make it a bit faster. I also put banana's on the inside of the sandwich of some of them. I put a bit of cinnamon in the egg mixture because that is how I always make french toast. This was the first thing gone and everyone loved it that got some. I was already asked to make it again. Thanks!!

YUM! I wasn't sure how it would taste with the cream cheese, but I was pleasantly surprised! I only had apple jelly, so that's what I used. It tasted like a combination of a strudel and apple pie!! I didn't follow the recipe exactly for the batter, I just did what I normally do which is 4 eggs, a splash of milk, and a dash each of cinnamon and vanilla extract. I also didn't have any bread sturdier than white, so I used that. I would recommend something a little heartier, just because the white bread didn't hold up very well during the spreading and dipping, but it was still the best french toast I've ever eaten!!

I used cinnamon swirl toast for the bread and mixed softed cream cheese, sugar, cinnamon, and a little bit of vanilla extract together and smoothed it inside both sides.  Came out great!  Like a mini cheesecake french toast!

I'm not sure why some had trouble with fat free cream cheese.  If it's softened, it works exactly the same as regular for a recipe like this.  It spread & cooked wonderfully -- I had no problems with it.  For a bit of "fancy," I used a french baguette sliced into 1 inch pieces, rather than oatnut bread.  It cooked to a beautiful golden.  I added cinnamon to the egg mixture, & had to use vanilla extract as I was out of almond -- this recipe is delicious but almond would add an even more scrumptious layer!  This was an easy way to impress house guests -- A KEEPER!!

This was very good. I made it for my family during a recent visit. Everyone liked it except my neice, who is 15. She tried it but in the end wanted her usual plain jane french toast. I did use mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese, and it was very, very good.

So yummy!  I really like the almond flavor, it goes well with raspberry jam.  I used 100% whole fruit black raspberry jam and low-fat spradable cream cheese.  I just used regular whole-wheat bread too.  Very easy to make.

Very good. Went together quickly and cooked easily. I served it for a special breakfast with bacon, scrambled eggs and pure maple syrup. Delicious! I used the strawberry jam as suggested. Loved the oat nut bread. Did not get soggy at all.

Made this but did not have cream cheese. I got the bright idea to use ice-cream instead and I was surprised by how good it tasted and the fact that the ice-cream did not melt completely! Amazing, love, love, love it

Awesome base recipe, especially using the oatnut bread: perfect amount of crunch and substance for an otherwise decadent breakfast!  I substituted fatfree sour cream with lemon zest, cinnamon, stevia, and nutmeg for the filling and opted for fresh fruit on the side rather than the jam.  I also left out the almond extract, but only bc my husband isn't a fan.
I've tried a few different toast "stuffing" techniques that all turned out kind of ugly and messy... this one is the SIMPLEST and most successful solution! SANDWICH! DUH! Why didn't I think of that?!

I loved it!  I used thick slices of stone oven white bread, and I added a mixture of vanilla, cinnamon and sugar to the batter as well as the almond extract.  I used fresh raspberries in place of jam and drizzled them with golden syrup.  Super delicious, I am going to be trying this with lots of different flavor combinations.  I think I will try lingonberry jam with some grand marnier mixed into the cream cheese!

I bought Philadelphia's white chocolate cream cheese spread at the store yesterday, so when I saw this recipe I thought I'd try it with a switch.  I spread the wc cream cheese onto both slices of bread.  To keep from being to sweet, I used frozen raspberries I had on hand instead of the jam.  I then double-dipped into the egg batter; delicious!

This was a huge hit. I followed the recipe exact, only using homemade strawberry freezer jam instead of raspberry. My husband and kids ate every bite. Great way for couponers to use cheap cream cheese and day old bread and excellent weekend breakfast treat. I made cheezy eggs and turkey bacon to go with.

I used Texas Toast, light cream cheese and Simply Strawberry Jam.  Made the french toast and then put just a little of Smuckers Strawberry Syrup on top.  Perfect for Valentines Day.  It was simple and quick to put together (another plus)!

Very good. I really enjoyed this. I didn't have almond extract so for two servings, I used 3/4 tsp. vanilla extract and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon for something extra =) Will definitely use again. Thanks!

This was so easy and delicious!  Both my hubby and I loved it!  I used what I had on hand - tuscan bread, strawberry preserves, and vanilla extract (instead of oatnut bread, raspberry preserves and almond extract), and it turned out great.  Can't wait to try other varieties!

I didn't have oatnut bread, raspberry jam, or almond extract. I did have white bread, vanilla extract, and strawberry jam so I improvised, it still turned out amazing. I also dipped the sandwich in some crushed corn flakes after the egg mixture(you could pretty much try any cereal). I let it get really brown and crunchy on both sides and served with whipped cream, sliced bananas, and fresh strawberries. Soooooo Gooood

WOW...so very yummy. I used Texas Toast and made both stuffed french toast and some plain slices of french toast. The stuffed was the first to go. If I could make one suggestion though....I did as the recipe said, spread cream cheese on one slice and the jam of your choice on the other. Next time I make this (which I was immediately informed would be in a couple days again) I will mix the jam & cream cheese together first & then spread in between the bread slices. I was blessed to have fresh strawberry jam from a friend so the flavor was delicious. I served it with the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup from this site. I've had this at a fancy breakfast cafe near our house and always have cravings for it but can't afford it very often. Now I can make it at home and have seconds without paying for a second plate. YES. It really is that good.

This was great, and so easy too! I didn't change anything but we didn't meaure the cream cheese/preserves in the sandwiches. Just put the amount that looked right. We put strawberry freezer jelly on top of ours and a dusting of powdered sugar, and I don't think a restaurant could beat it :) Prep goes very fast too if you can get someone else to help with the sandwich making part!

Very delicious and easy to make. Definately a good sunday morning breakfast. I made this in July so I had some fresh raspberries on hand which I added to the perserves. I think Next time I may use a little less cream cheese. But I will definately be adding this to me breakfast rotation.

Yummy!  I made this tonight for dinner and my family liked it.  I used the same amount of cream cheese that this recipe calls for to make 10 servings.  I also used vanilla extract instead of almond.  This is a make-again!

Easy to fix, very sweet.  I used thick bread and cut pockets in the slices. Honey liked the recipe but one was enough due to the sweetness.

I used coconut extract instead of almond extract, and blackberry spread instead of the raspberry. I loved the middle! I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to the egg mixture.

I didn’t follow the recipe to the T but it was so delicious! I done 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract and a little cinnamon and sugar.  I mixed the cream cheese with strawberry blackberry jam then spread it on the bread and put bananas on top of it. I melted down the jam also for syrup. A little tart at times but I found it super delicious.

Good idea that can be modified many ways. To make it a little healthier, I used 1/2 egg whites and 1/2 eggs, low fat milk, and multi-grain bread. Greek yogurt/cream cheese blend instead of regular cream cheese. Fruit jelly and added sliced strawberries. No one noticed that it was lower in fat and calories, it was great.

Loved it! I made it with white Italian instead of honey oat, mascarpone and sliced raspberries (no jam), used vanilla in egg mixture and added cinnamon. Topped with confectionery sugar and raspberries....... My family loved it!  Thank you!

I LOVED how easy and fast this was! I got up to make french toast and decided to see how hard it would be to make stuffed. It saved me like 30 minutes in front of the griddle for my family of 7! I made this with wheat bread and only had about a third a cup of cream chz left in the refrigerator, so I made do and cut each finished sandwich in half. To my pleasant surprise, my kids were full off of one half each, and they loved it! Very good birthday meal without the pricetag at a breakfast place to get it. Next time I think I am going to fluff up the filling with more cream cheese than it calls for and chop up some fresh strawberries to put inside. Or maybe even copy the lemon blueberry from Cracker Barrel. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I used challah bread cut into thick slices. I filled some with cream cheese and fresh blueberries, some with cream cheese and raspberry jam, and some with Nutella. My family loved it!

This was great! I used thick slices of French bread, vanilla extract & whipped cream cheese as substitutes. I also dusted it with powdered sugar & it was delicious!!

Super yummy french toast and also super sweet! This is almost more like a dessert than a breakfast.  But it was very good.  I used what I had on hand and used strawberry jelly.  I also used Pepperidge farm strawberry swirl bread.  It was so sweet on its own that no syrup was even needed.

Super easy and feels fancy.  I haven't tried this, but I bet pumpkin butter would be an excellent jam replacement.  It's about as rich as you'd imagine a cream cheese sandwich dipped in eggs and fried in butter could be, so plan to move sluggishly for a few hours.

Good and very easy. . . we always have different Jellies and Jams on hand so doing a few different kinds wasn't a problem. If your looking for an easy different approach to french toast try this! ( or another good one is Blueberry french toast casserole listed on this site)!

Very good, I substituted strawberry jam since that was what we had on hand. it was great and probably would work good with any berry type of jam.

Yummy!!  Made a different egg batter from an handed down french toast recipe.  Replaced the vanilla with the almond as in this recipe and added a dash of cinnamon! Made with Apple Butter as well as Red Rasberry Jam! Also, used olive oil instead of butter in the pan!  Made heart shaped!  Was a hit!

This actually wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  It's not bad, but French toast is already heavy and filling enough that the jam and cream cheese inside was just too much.  The actual French toast itself was very good though.  I ended up using Oatmeal bread instead of Oatnut, strawberry jam instead of raspberry (what I had on hand), and vanilla extract instead of almond (boyfriend is allergic to all nuts).  I also added powdered sugar.

Very yummy!  I used French bread and still turned out good.  I didn't have almond extract so I just used vanilla.  I will try the almond next time.  Will make again.

I wish I could give this more than five stars!!! It's fantastic! The second (and subsequent times) I made it, I mixed the cream cheese and jam together in a bowl with some sugar (to make it a sweeter cream cheesy taste) and spread that on the bread, then continued as normal. I've made this for guests and they absolutely loved it! It's one of my favorite meals!

This is a simple recipe and tasty as well.  I don't like rasberries so I used Guava jam which is what my family prefers.  Everyone enjoyed this breakfast but I think I need to put more jam the next time I make it.  The almond extract gave it a nice flavor!

My boys loved this.  BUT, I used whole wheat bread & it almost became soggy as I cooked it--I don't know if it was the type of bread or maybe my heat wasn't high enough.  Either way, they both gobbled this up & I will make it again.

This was great but I made some modifications. I made two batches. I made one my mixing the cream cheese mixture, vanilla and pumpkin butter with a little honey and spread inside very thin sandwich bread and then dipped in the egg mixture. The other was for a peanut butter lover and I added crunchy peanut butter, vanilla, honey and cinnamon and a little milk to the cream cheese mixture. Both were big bits but the pumpkin butter was one of best breakfasts we have had.
Thanks for the recipe

Much more moist than regular french toast. We loved it, and it was so easy to make!
