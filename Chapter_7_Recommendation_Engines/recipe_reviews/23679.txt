Quick, easy, tasty recipe. The one thing I will change next time is to use a large bowl because the sugar has a tendency to splatter a bit until it is incorporated. Blends well, not too grainy, just a little.

This is a great icing for pound & bundt cakes.  Use only 1 teaspoon of water or milk to get a creamy frosting.  Takes great on graham crackers too!

I beat it forever & it was still not fluffy enough for cupcakes.  It was more syrupy.  Very sweet & I could feel the confectioner's sugar in my teeth.  The kids liked it of course, they like anything with sugar, but I will not make it again.

I cut the recipe in half. It really came out great. It is not the creamy kind of frosting that you get in ready made tubs, but it was delicious w/ the Eclair Cake on this website.

A great chocolate flavor, but a bit too sweet.

This is a great recipe all around.  I really like that it doesn't use very much
butter but is very rich and creamy.  It's also incredibly quick and easy to make!

Very Sweet. The confectioner's sugar always kills it for me. But everyone enjoyed it.

This is just what I was looking for, a great tasting frosting that takes little time to make.  I will definitely use this to ice cakes, brownies, etc.

I don't know what I did wrong but I have to disagree with most everyone- all I could taste was vanilla and powdered sugar. I didn't even taste the cocoa. I won't be using this again any time soon, my kids didn't even like it.

This is a really yummy icing.  I had to add about two extra tablespoons of liquid (milk and water), but once I put it on the cake and it "set up", it was just fine.  The taste was great.

Great icing, kept it's consistency despite a warm day and waiting in a car parked in the shade until the "cake moment" at a big outdoors birthday party this weekend. I used this icing on the Crazy Chocolate Cake, and everyone LOVED the combination. I left the icing out to soften quite a bit and applied it to a cold cake, then put the cake back in the fridge. It was the easiest icing to apply that I've ever worked with! Definitely a new favourite in this house! I think just about everyone came back for seconds (good thing I had bake two cakes, since we have twin girls!).
