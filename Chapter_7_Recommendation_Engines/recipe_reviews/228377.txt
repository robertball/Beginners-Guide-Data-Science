Amazing.  Needed a solution for a side dish that wasn't potatoes or noodles.  This fit the bill.  I used a 10oz can of petite diced tomatoes (drained) in place of the sundried tomatoes and added a clove of garlic.  Paired with baked lemon pepper cod and steamed broccoli, it went beautifully!

Thanks for the recipe Jenni, we paired it with Sweet Chili Lime Chicken.  I used chicken broth with quick cooking farro from Trader Joes. I used two yellow squash and about six whole mushrooms, that seemed to be enough for us.  My family loved it!!! Very easy recipe to follow.  I will definitely add it to my recipe box.

I am the only vegan in my home, and I'm always looking for new tasty dished to tempt my family with.  I switched out the chicken bouillon for veggie and it was still fantastic.  This has become my go-to recipe for "pot luck" gatherings and it's always a hit.  Even my meat and potatoes husband loves it.

This was my first time using farro, which I bought on impulse at Costco a couple weeks ago.  I made this recipe with a little less mushrooms (a mixed 4oz of oyster, shiitake, and cimini) and this was a good amount for us, although I don't think more would hurt.  Next time I make this I might add a little of the cooking liquid from the farro to my veggie mixture.  I had some issues with it starting to stick to the pan and had to decrease my cooking time to avoid trouble.  I think a little liquid would allow me to get my vegetables as tender as I would prefer.  Next time I may try adding chicken to this.

Made it as written but added rotisserie chicken and fresh basil at the very end rather than dried.  It was delicious!

This is an exceptional dish!!!  Made as directed except used quick-cooking farro because that's all my local grocery store had, but it turned out wonderful!!!!  We had never tried farro before and were  eager to try taste it. My family ate it up quickly! Thanks so much for posting!

First time using Farro, this was delicious, I had to add my own garlic (3 cloves) because my sun dried tomatoes in olive oil did not have garlic, I used the crookneck squash and zucinni squash, and a bit of coarse ground pepper. I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe Jenni

What a great recipe.  it was the first time I have cooked Farro.  Everyone at the table had never eaten it before but we all loved it.  i'll definitely make it again.  The only change I made was that I used the sundried tomatoes that are not packed in oil so I sauted the vegetables in a table spoon of olive oil.
