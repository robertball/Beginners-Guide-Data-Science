I'm a baker and have been making this bar for years. Here's how we make it: Don't melt the butter. Pecans instead of walnuts, use a 14 oz. bag of caramels. Put 2/3 of the batter in the pan and bake about 6-8 min.(not 3) until the top is no longer dark and shiney. Pour caramel over then sprinkle the chips on top. Spoon small mounds of remaining batter over the top. Return to oven 6-8 min. You may have to adjust baking time the second time depending on your oven. It's also best to let it sit for several hours or overnight for before cutting.

Oh my!  I made these for the holidays and people loved them, even if most thought these were brownies.  I used Swiss chocolate cake mix because I could not find German.  Also, I used caramel spread (like kids put on toast) instead of the melted caramels.  This was easy and tasted great.  I was sure that I did not have enough "dough" to cover for the top layer but the cake batter spead nicely while baking and they turned out perfect.

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm good!  I messed up the dough and only added 1/3 cup of evap milk.  I baked the dough for about 10 minutes- until the top was no longer shiny.  When I melted the caramels in the microwave, I added 2/3 cup evap milk (to make up for what I didn't put in the batter originally), poured that over the baked dough, sprinkled the choc. chips on the caramel, sprinkled the nuts over that (used walnuts) and then plopped 'piles' of remaining batter over the toppings- didn't try to spread it out at all.  I ended up cooking this for much longer than the recipe states- started with 15 minutes and checked it 5-10 min. intervals until it wasn't 'jiggly' anymore- I think I ended up cooking it for about 35 minutes.  Keep an eye on it as it's cooking and you'll be ok.  These are DECADENT and delicious!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for a great dessert!!

This is such a cool recipe. I asked myself about a hundred times though, "really, no eggs, no oil?" I followed the suggestion by the baker-reviewer and when I was spreading the first part in the pan I thought for sure I was making it wrong, but then it came out looking ok. I was kind of confused because there wasnt much dough left over for the top, but I found that through cooking it spread out and in the end this is a great looking dessert!

This is very similar to a recipe that I've been making for years (Turtle Brownies) with the cooking times being just a bit different:  the first half of the cake batter is baked for 6 minutes (then the caramels & stuff are layered on) and then final assembled pan is baked for an additional 20 minutes.  It's delicious & decadent...and meant to be chewy & soft.  Try it!

I have sent this to my husband's workplace and taken it to my own company holiday party.  People LOVE IT!  I used pecans instead of walnuts because my husband loves pecans.  I have also substituted caramel chips/melting pellets (bought by the bag that usually come with a pack of sticks inside the bag since they're sold to melt for caramel apples) instead of unwrapping all those caramels.  When I'm a little short on caramel chips, I've also substituted a bit of caramel ice cream topping to make up the difference & there is no difference in the end product.  I did follow several reviewer's advice to pour 2/3 of the mix (not 1/2) in the pan to bake the first time (bake 6 - 8 minutes or until top no longer shiny), then at the end I add the remaining 1/3 of the mix (not 1/2) on top of the caramel, nuts & chips & bake an additional 6 - 8 minutes to finish it off!

I do not believe the baking time was correctly submitted. Is it possible to have that checked into? The taste was excellent, I am just concerned, again, about the actual cook time.

This is a keeper.  So easy to make.  Used a chocolate fudge mix and used jarred caramel instead of wrapped pieces.  Came out like the best brownies I've every made and ever tasted.

These won me a cookie-contest at work! I followed the review from the baker, too, and it came out fine, but I had to spread the mounds of cake mix out with a spatula during that second round of baking. The caramel gives it a distinct "oomph" that distinguishes it from other brownies/bars. Thank you!

I just made these and although they were runny, they were excellent.  I found out the next day it was much easier to cut and serve as "bars".  These are the best bars and everyone thought they were brownies.  Great to make ahead of time for a function in the next day or two.

These dessert bars are very delicious, but dangerous! As named, they have too many calories to eat them as much as tempted! Beware:) The recipe is very simple to follow and I recommend following the caramel directions(bag of 50 caramels) One piece of advice would be to try to avoid large amounts of caramel around the edges of baking dish, as the caramel was very difficult to get off of my dish. I added about 8 oz of chocolate chips(milk chocolate) for a decadent, but not overbearing chocolate flavor! Delicious, delicious!!

Took the advice of "baker" and did not melt the butter and that did not work out well for me!  The 2nd time I cut the butter back and that ALSO didn't work out so well.  Found that if I followed the recipe exactly as written it was fantastic.  I did use pecans instead of walnuts, and had to bake the bottom layer 6 min. instead of 3 but that's just my oven.  This recipe is to die for and requested over and over.

This has been a favorite at our house for over 20 years and is now a favorite for the next generation of our family.  I bake the bottom layer 10 minutes.  You can use a toothpick to help spread the globs of the second cake layer on top of the caramel.

I have been making this recipe for years (since I was in high school).  Somewhere along the way I got tired of unwrapping all the carmels and deciede to try a carmel topping in a jar instead....it works great!  It bake the first layer, then I pour on the carmel (I think I usually use Mrs. Richardson's), sprinkle the chips and add the top layer of cake batter mixure.  They are a little stickier, but less work!

I followed recipe exactly and baked the times as suggested 6-8 min split.  I took to a party and only 3 people ate.  It was not good at all!  Way too much carmel (which I didn't know I could say).  It was just a total embarrassment and I'll never make again.

I made this recipe according to the directions yesterday and loved it.  It was easy to make.  I think I overbaked it a little because the top did not look done to me. It just seemed too soft on top. I baked it an additional 6 minutes. That was too long. My brownies came out very chewy but still very good.  So, next time I will follow the baking time exactly.

I've been making these for years and everybody loves them.  The only change I make is to add unsweetened coconot shreds to the caramel/nut layer.   I always refer to them as German Chocolate Caramel Brownies.

I used to make these before my youngest son developed a nut allergy.  They ARE heavenly!  However I would switch up my nuts with almonds and/or pecans if walnuts were not available.

I've been making this recipe for years, calling it Snicker Brownies. The first time I made it, the original recipe called for 3/4C melted butter and 1/3C evap milk for the cake part. I felt it was too greasy for my taste, so I cut the butter to 1/2C and add 1 egg. It also makes the cake a tad fluffier, which I like.
I also use chopped peanuts instead of walnuts, and put them in the cake part. I bake about 8 minutes the first time, then 15-20 the next. Definitely let them set for several hours before cutting, or you'll have a mess on your hands.

I personally did not care for these bars.  They taste to much like the German Chocolate cake and the caramels are a pain.  Not worth the time.

What can I say? There are reasons recipes like this, 7 layer bars,Bacardi rum cake,Honey Bun cake and the like are still around. What is that reason? People LOVE them!!! They are some  of the few recipes that not only produce consistent  raves but they are EASY!!!

I hate to poo poo these after all the good ratings but they weren't as good as I wanted them to be. The german cake mix ended up being sort of an odd element to the dish. It has a subtle flavor that got lost and seemed almost flavorless compared to the very strong and very sweet caramel and chocolate. I wasn't crazy about the texture of the cake layer either. I brought these to a friend's house and one person absolutely loved them and the other person felt the same way as me, that they were just OK.

Delicious!!  I used Mrs. Richardson's Caramel topping instead of melting caramels and the bars were so tasty!!  I made mine without nuts though as I'm not a nut fan.  Two thumbs way up!! :)

Oh good GOD!!  This is a sweet tooth's dream!  The only difficulty I had was patting the second half of the batter on top of all the middle ingredients.  So I spooned it over and spead it out as best as I could.  Made no difference in the end though.  Thanks!

These are delicious and can be made with regular Devil's Food cake mix, if you don't have German chocolate handy.

These are delicious!  The recipe is very similar to "caramel brownies" which I make and is always a hit.  My husband thought this was a little rich, but not too rich for me.

These were really great.  I have to admit I did switch around the toppings as I had a coworker who loves German Chocolate cake, so I added coconut - but everyone said it was the best "brownie" they had ever had.

These are amazing, and have become my new go-to for bake sales/dessert potlucks.  I follow the advice given here to extend the baking times-- first baking takes ~8min, second one ~20min.  I also add a chocolate drizzle across the top for decoration.  Delicious!

These were good but you have to be a SERIOUS sweet-tooth to appreciate them.  They were a hit with others.  Hubbie says they were too rich but managed to eat at least 4.

This was the biggest hit of the night.  Everyone kept raving about them!  I did use pecans instead of walnuts because they are the better nut!!  So, so easy to make up.  I melted my carmels with the milk, in the microwave.  I did it the first couple of times for one minute each, stirring after each one.  When I could see it melting more, I only put it in for 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each one.

I have made several slices in the last couple of days and this one rates as my husbands favorite. How can you go wrong with chocolate chips, caramel and nuts? I did bake it the extra 5 minutes as was suggested in several reviews. It will be a repeat here many times I am sure!

I didn't change a thing. Absolutely delicious! These are so rich and addicting I don't make them very often. As the name tells you, they are incredibly fattening.  But worth every calorie.

Delicious!  Very very rich and great for satisfying chocolate and caramel cravings.  4 stars though as they just don't hold together well and therefore I couldn't make this for company or to take somewhere as they aren't solid/firm enough to hold and eat even after sitting for many hours.  However, I will make them again . . . it will be awesome spooned when warm from the oven into bowls and topped with vanilla ice cream.  That I could definitely serve to guests!

These were WONDERFUL!  I agree with most readers, that the cooking time should be increased.  Also, next time I bake it I plan on decreasing the butter by 1/4C as I always feel guilty baking such a decadent treat.

OOOMMMMGGGG THIS IS THE BEST CAKE EVER!!!!!  My husband is a HUGE german chocolate and caramel fan so he LOVES this!!  I bought the german chocolate frosting and put it on top, VERY GOOD!!!  I did cook it 6 min the first time then 20 minutes and it got slightly burnt on the top, maybe 6 min and 15 min would work better.

this had fantastic flavor. Very Rich, very delicious but yes, the cooking time isnt right. I think next time I need to add 10 minutes next time - mine came out too gooey and had to dish it out with a spoon instead of cut into bars (but we still ate it!) ;)
