This was very good and healthy. We did it exactly as written but agree that the ten minutes in the end only served to cook the spinach more.

Delicious! This recipe is as  good as any I've had at local Mediterranean restaurants. The only thing I switched up was leaving out the peppers and adding extra garlic. Will be making this again.

This was excellent! The only thing I would change next time is the last step of letting it steam for 10 minutes. Once you toss the drained pasta in there isn't enough heat left for it to "steam". I thought that step would soften the feta but it didn't. All it really did was start to overcook the spinach and you don't want to lose that bright green. Excellent recipe and it is has a lovely presentation which is always a plus.

I did this a little differently but the result was so tasty. At 375 for 30 min, I baked 1 lb chicken tenderloins covered in about three minced cloves of garlic; one can (drained) artichokes, chopped; one box of organic diced tomatoes; about 1/4 cup chopped kalamata olives. 

While that was baking, I cooked penne, drained it and tossed it with 2 cups spinach. When chicken was done, I mixed everything in a big pasta bowl, adding feta cheese.

Amazing!
