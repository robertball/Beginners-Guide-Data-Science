This sorbet is so, so good.  To make simple syrup, I boiled a cup of water and then stirred in a cup of sugar until the sugar was dissolved.  To give it more fruit flavor, I added the lime zest from two limes to the water before I boiled it.  Once the simple syrup was made, I added the lime juice from both limes.  Once it cooled a bit, I put in in the fridge for a while.  I ended up with more than a cup of simple syrup, so I just used a cup of it and am saving the rest to make the recipe again.  Very yummy!  It tastes very fresh.

I saw a comment on here about how to make ice cream without the ice cream maker and since I have the exact same problem, I found this on the internet:

Make sure you have a bowl that’s quite wide to use for the churning/freezing process that comes next. 

Take your ice cream recipe mixture and carefully pour it into the bowl, then chill in the fridge for up to 2 hours, checking on it after 1 hour. The reason it can take longer than an hour is when a recipe mixture has had cooked ingredients added, therefore thorough chilling will take longer. 

Take the bowl out of the fridge and transfer to the freezer for about half an hour. Then check just how much the mixture has frozen - ideally, it should have started to freeze at the edges but not fully through to the centre. 

Take the bowl out of the freezer and  beat the ice cream mixture until it’s creamy once again (to dislodge and break up the ice crystals that have formed).

Put it back in the freezer for another half hour, then remove and once again beat with a whisk.

Do this again so that you have beaten the mixture a total of 3 times whilst freezing in between.

Put the mixture back into the freezer for a final time until it’s ready to eat. This can take anything from 30 minutes upwards, depending upon the quantity and type of ice cream you’re making and also how you like the consistency of your ice cream (some people like it softer, some harder).

What a yummy treat! I do have a few comments that may be helpful to others. I used 4 VERY ripe mangos which I thought may be a problem, but it actually helped! Thanks to the extreme ripeness, there was no need for peeling much - just cut it in half and pull out the "meat." I combined all of the ingredients in a blender for easier pouring. I have a 4-qt. ice cream maker, and this recipe filled less than one-fourth of its container. So, it actually required less time then the machine alotted for, so check yours every once and a while. Once the sorbet was done, it was almost like a "soft serve" consistency; which we all liked a lot, but if you like your pretty frozen and a bit harder, I suggest letting it freeze in the freezer for quite a while. Finally, I believe this recipe says that it can serve 12, well it definitely cannot. I only ended up with 4 servings, which is perfect for the 4 of us, but if you want more you will need to increase the ingredients. (I guess it is one mango per person :D ). Oh, and one more thing, I used bottled lime juice, not fresh and it was fine. Very tasty, you should definitely give it a shot.

Mangoes and limes are a match made in heaven.  I've been making a recipe like this for years.  The texture of the sorbet is sublime!  If you can find the jarred mangoes in light syrup (in the refrigerated section of the product dept, usually), you can even skip the simple syrup.  I do usually add a bit of vanilla, too, but this sorbet is my absolute favorite!

Just delicious!  Creamy and velvety smooth - no hint of graininess or iciness, with a beautiful and vibrant color. Delightful and easily identifiable mango flavor simply enhanced with the lime juice - wouldn't have known it was in there had I not made this myself. And because I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen mango chunks (and a half recipe) this was unbelievably fast! I pureed the frozen mango, then added the lime juice and syrup which I had chilled in the freezer and continued to puree until smooth. Because the mixture was pretty much frozen (and spoonable!) before it even hit the ice cream maker, I don't think I even churned it ten minutes before it was done and nearly ready to eat. As for the lime juice and simple syrup, I used the amounts called for in the recipe, scaled down to half the recipe, and found both to be perfect. Definitely a "make again" recipe!

This turned out perfect!  It was the first recipe I made with my new ice cream maker.  I viewed tons of recipes and choose this one because of the natural ingredients.  I am cutting back on sugar so I made the simple sugar syrup with 3/4 Cup instead of 1 Cup and 1 Cup water.  I used frozen Mango chunks because the store here was out of fresh.  I thawed them and they pureed perfectly.  I have a new favorite!!!  This is so light and delicious.  The lime really adds the perfect little kick to it.  Not too much, but just a hint.  Next time I am going to cut the sugar back to 1/2 Cup and shoot for using really ripe mangos for natural sweetness.  Definately a great recipe!

This was SOOOO GOOD!!
It took about 4 hours to freeze but once it was frozen it as gone. Didn't make any changes. Just be sure to use ripe to very ripe mangos so you get that sweet mango flavour. Will make again over any other recipe!

Outstanding!  I used two large mangoes, 3 Tbs symple syrup and 2 Tbsp honey.  Juice of whole lime.  Very easy to make.  Excellent texture.  Made just enough for a simple indulgence.  Try it with a piece of dark chocolate candy.

This is an outstanding recipe. I used about 3/4c simple syrup rather than the full cup due to personal preference. Thank you, this is going to become a family favorite!

After reading all of the reviews, I think I can offer some help. To keep the lime flavor from being too prominant, use tiny Key limes (sometimes called Mexican limes) They lack the astringency of regualr Persian limes and should really be used in all recipes. 

You can also use the small, yellow Manilla mangoes, which are not stringy and fibrous like the common red/green mango. Either way, you should process the puree for a long time to reduce the fibers.

The sorbet will be creamier if you add, as one reviewer suggested, a few T of cream. But all sorbets, gelatos and ice creams should rest overnight in the fridge before processing in the ice cream maker. This step gives them the silken quality that is lost if you don't let the texture meld.

If you use the cream, it would be best to add the lime juice to the simple syrup and let it cook for a minute. This will prevent it from curdling the cream.

Can we say PERFECT! This recipe is so simple and easy that I was inspired to try other flavors as well. Strawberry (from frozen), Peaches (have to VERY Ripe) Pineapple/Banana(Strain puree) Kiwi! Made so many flavors we wound up having a sorbet party for the neighborhood. Folks it just doesn't get any easier than this. For those with sugar issues you can use Splenda or Truvia just as easily as sugar. Having a Share Our Strength bake sale once a month this spring and summer and have decided to sell these as well in one pint containers. I expect this to be a huge hit!

A wonderful refreshing summer treat.   I added a bit of citrus vodka to keep the sorbet texture after freezing.

This is the smoothest sorbet I have ever had. I used canned mango drained off the syrup as I didn't have any fresh when I found this recipe.Everyone who has had a taste was impressed...Thanks for sharing!!!

Very enjoyable.  Wonderful when you need to use up mangos that are getting over ripe.  These give the absolute best flavor.  I have made this several times now in my ice cream maker for the kitchenaid stand mixer.  It turns out great.  I had the same problem as others with quantities - so here's what I did: 1) 2 cups mango flesh, 1/2 cup simple syrup, 2 tbsp sugar, 3 tbsp fresh lime juice, 1/2 tsp lime zest, 1/3 cup heavy cream or yogurt, salt to taste; 2) use a spoon to scrape mango flesh from the skin; 3) puree all, but the sugar in the blender at a high speed for at least 5 minutes; 4) refridgerate batter overnight, puree again with the addition of the sugar before freezing in your machine.  Following this procedure really cuts down on the stringiness of the mangos.

Awesome! I used frozen pre-chopped and peeled mango - easier and quicker. For the simple syrup I used white corn syrup, 3/4 cup. Perfect texture and taste my guests were very impressed! I will use this recipe again.

Excellent Sorbet!! Easy to put together with minimal effort, and very satisfying in flavor and overall taste. I would reccomend to others when choosing mangos to pick only the RIPEST mangos to get the most of the flavors. The skin should be more red than green, give when you squeeze it and have a mango scent.  I peeled, diced the mangos, placed them in the fridge to get cold. I used the simple syrup recipe on this website as well, then chilled it. I cut the recipe in half since I am really the only one who will really eat mango sorbet. I used 1 1/2 T fresh lime juice. I chilled everything for at least couple of hours before making the sorbet. I really think having everything chilled before hand really helped in the freezing process. The puree took me a couple of minutes. I left a few small tiny chunks in there, personal preference. I had my sorbet done in 25 minutes in my cuisinart ice cream maker. I noticed the sorbet had some firmness but still soft to the touch with a spoon, perfect for me! I like my consistency no too firm and not too soft. Everything turned out perfectly. It was nicely chilled and I can see little bits of fresh mangos throughout the sorbet. I can taste the fresh mangos and smell its' fragrant aroma. I did not even notice the lime juice even thou I know it is in there. Great no-fail recipe and no adjustments needed. A keeper for me and will use again. I am saving the other half of the simple syrup for my next sorbet recipe.

I made this as a light dessert after a dinner party this weekend past and it was a hit! We have some left over still, though only because I put it in the back of the freezer and forgot about it. I will definitely make this sorbet again!

I agree with others in that a whole cup of simple syrup is to much. I added some strawberries. I think another fruit would be better. The little seeds from the strawberries didn't chop up. Next time, I'm sticking to straight mangos.

This is really good sorbet. I added about a tsp of grated lime peel to the simple syrup while it cooked. I also added a little more (about 1/4 c.) sugar.  Made this the 2nd time with 1 cup of strawberries. Wonderful!

This is a great recipe. I make the syrup by boiling 1-1/2 cups water with 8 tbsp sugar,letting it boil for about 15 mins to about 1 cup and leaving it in the fridge overnight. I use 700gm of mango puree and 4 tbsp of lime juice. The next time when I make this sorbet I'm gonna add 1 or 2 tbsp of lime juice, because after freezing, I can't really taste the lime. The texture of this sorbet is just right.  Not too mushy or too hard. It is good. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very refreshing!  This came out very, very smooth and creamy.  It was not icy at all.  I think that was in part to cutting only where the mango was easy to cut.  I did not try to get as much as I could from the stringier section by the core.  Also, I processed it a LOT.  I added 3-4 tbs of whole milk (was out of cream) and 2 tbs of triple sec.  This was delicious.  I would make again.  I think I would even add a tad more milk/cream.  Also I would love to try other flavors.  I did use an ice cream machine.  Truly cool and refreshing.  What I especially like is that it is all natural.  I know what's in it.

Soooo yummy and so simple to make, even for those that do not have an ice cream maker.  It is a pain to have to keep tabs on it every 30 minutes to whisk it between bouts of freezing, but in a couple hours - voila! mango sorbet! Thanks for the recipe! AND - my mango was seriously over-ripe and it was just the perfect consistency!

I was looking for a mango icecream like I use to buy on the Arabian sea in Pakistan.  So I added 1.5 c half-n-half to this recipe and it was awesome creamy and refreshing!

What I would do is put in a 1/2 cup mango nectar and a 1/2 cup simple syrup.  I like to use juice and simple syrup.  I find out the juice enhances the fruit favor!!!!

Made this with very ripe mangoes - halved the recipe and followed directions to a T: really nice colour, nice taste, although a bit too sweet to be really refreshing.  However, the reason for only 3 stars, is the sorbet was solid ice block.  In order to serve I have set the dish out on the counter for it to thaw out some.  Next time I will cut down on the syrup and add some cream

Delicious!  Like summer in a bowl.  Great mango flavor and beautiful color.  I doubled the recipe and added a little extra lime juice.  Would be fabulous with a sprig of mint and lime wedge.

Delicious in our new Cuisinart ice cream maker ... tied for one of the top two recipes we have made in it. I need to double the recipe next time as it makes a very small amount (for 6 of us).

This is so delicious!!! It took only a couple of minutes to get the ingredients together and blend them! I used around 16 oz of frozen mango as another user suggested, then poured the HOT syrup on top of it, which made the temperature perfect for easy blending. Then I squeezed in the juice of one lime. The ingredients are so simple, I'll definitely be making this again!

this recipe was great! And it was very easy. The ending result of the sorbet was quite soft so I chilled it overnight and it came out fantastic! I only had one mango so I added 2 bananas to replace the other two mangoes. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Used a sauce maker to puree the mango in and added the lime juice and some zest. Also added a bit of grated ginger to the simple syrup while heating. Poured all of the ingredients in a ziplock freezer bag. (I don't own an ice cream maker yet.) Mixture is currently in the freezer. taking it out ever 15-30 minutes and squishing it around to break up the crystals. Got caught Sneaking a taste and so far wonderfully. I am sure it will be even better completly frozen. Trying the same with some peach puree.

Thanks for posting, Marylandgirl. Now before I try the recipe, I need to know how many cups of mango I need. Where I live they vary in size quite a bit, so "4" will not help a whole lot! After reading the reviews I'm anxious to try it. Thanks!

This is really yummy.  I didn't have four mangoes, so I used three kiwi, too.  It made it a weird green color, but the flavor was really good.  I also added some fresh lime zest & cut the simple syrup to 3/4 of a cup b/c the mangoes were pretty sweet.  Very refreshing for summer.

Great recipe! I was making 3 different recipes at once and forgot the lime juice in the sorbet.  It was really good anyway.  Next time, I will cut the simple syrup to 3/4 cup as the mangos were quite sweet on their own.

I wanted to cut the sugar so I used very ripe mangos and for the simple syrup used only 1/2 cup water, with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda (packets - not granules) it came out perfect.  All you taste is the fabulous mango flavor.  I also took the suggestion of another review and put in the zest of the lime while boiling the water, but just one lime not 2.  This is a great, simple recipe - thanks for sharing.

This is really good.  I only gave it four stars because I thought it was too sweet.  I added strawberries to dilute the sweetness and it was a great combo!  I also added a pinch of salt.

This was good.  I halved the recipe (I only had 2 mangoes, and they were cut up & ready for something).  I also changed the configuration of sugar for the simple syrup.  I used about 2/3 sugar and 1/3 Splenda.  (Next time I'll try half of each.)

It was very good, really refreshing for summer.  My only complaint, and it isn't the fault of the recipe, is the stringiness of the mangoes.  Some bites were so stringy, and somehow in the freezing process, they lose their juice, so we ended up with clumps of flavorless string stuff in our mouths.  It only happened a few times, but I'm going to have to figure out how to fix that.  I maybe just need to puree longer than I did.

The flavor and simplicity of the recipe, though, get an A from me.  Thanks for sharing!

Reward is far greater than effort put into this quick and simple dessert.  I would add simple syrup little by little to taste though because the mangoes I used turned out to be sweeter than expected and didn't require as much syrup.

What a lovely summer dessert!  My girlfriends and I really enjoyed it - it had a nice, light limey flavor.  I made the simple syrup with a teaspoon of lime zest and I don't have an ice cream maker, so I did the wisking-refrigerating-freezing method and it came out so nice.  Let it thaw a good 15-20 minutes on the counter before serving or just use the "soften" feature on your microwave.  Served in 4 martini glasses with whipped cream and a raspberry for garnish.  Yum!

Made as is, except per other reviews, I cut down the simple syrup to about 3/4 cup. It was definitely sweet enough with the reduced syrup and I may be tempted to reduce the syrup a tad bit more. I liked it, it is simple and very mango flavored. My husband didn't like it, only b/c he doesn't like mango flavored stuff, he would prefer if I mixed another fruit with it.

This is a great way to A. Use mangos & B. eat something that is a healthy alternative to ice cream. I made this for my wife and I and it received big thumbs up. For those of you watching what you eat this can be an excellent end to a great meal.

this was an okay recipe. after reading the reviews i got excited that i had finally found a good recipe for a mango sorbet, but it wasn't as good as i had hoped. my brother refused to finish it because he said he tasted the lime more than the mango (he hates limes..), even though i did what the recipe suggested(only 2 tsps actually). next time i will try a different fruit and see what happens, or put lemon juice to 'zest it up' instead of lime. thnx for the recipe anyways! :)

This is very easy to make and a very tasty frozen mango treat. I accidentally left out one of the mangoes, and it still tasted great. To flair it up, I added sliced fresh strawberries with each serving and it really kicked it up a notch. Fresh blueberries, or even grated fresh (emphasize fresh) coconut would be excellent with this. Very cool and refreshing and would be good on a hot summer day!!

This is a great basic recipe. Like others, I modified it by reducing the simple syrup to just 1/2 cup, since my fruit was very ripe and sweet. Also, I used one mango, one papaya, one kiwi (minus seeds) and strawberries. It turned out great, only next time I will try canned pineapple instead of the syrup + kiwi (the kiwi made the sorbet taste a little furry though I did skin the fruit first). Make sure you read your ice cream maker instruction before starting this recipe!

This was great, and very easy to make. I used less sugar in the simple syrup as that is my preference.

I made this but had to make some alterations because I only had 1 mango, no simple syrup and not enough lime juice. I used 2 bananas to make up for some of the missing mango, as another member suggested...and I used 3/4 cup light corn syrup, as suggested by another member, instead of simple syrup because I didn't have enough sugar to make simple syrup. And I only had 2 tablespoons of fresh lime juice. But it still worked fine because this was delicious! I can't wait to experiment with other fruits!

Great recipe - first one I made on my ice cream maker (which I've had for several years!) and was motivated due to the simple ingredients and great reviews.  If you don't have super ripe mangoes (as in my case), cube the mangoes ahead of time and let them macerate in their juices to increase the sweetness and flavour.  Served it to guests to rave reviews!

This was very refreshing!  I used 3 very ripe mangoes.  I didn't use all of the simple syrup, but I don't think I needed it.  Another reviewer suggested adding some half-n-half; I think I may try that next time.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Great recipe!! My family raved about it. I used the Piri mangoes found here in Hawaii. These mangoes are very sweet and have intense flavors. I might cut down the simple sugar by a 1/4 cup next time though.

I love this recipe for its elegant simplicity and potential versatility.  Every once in awhile I see one of those Italian ice cream makers in Goodwill and finally decided to invest $35 in one that appeared never to have been used.  As much as I love mangoes, I hate prepping them and also finding four or five dead ripe fruit at the same time.  I recently tried this with canned mandarin oranges. I included the light syrup of one can and drained it off the another two.  It was great!  I like to serve it topped with freshly grated nutmeg.

Hmm.  I liked this.  But I don't have an ice cream maker, so perhaps that is my problem.  It kind of just tasted like sweetened frozen mango.  LOL.  Bf didn't like it but I was ok with it.  Maybe kinda like a fruit bar . . .I don't know.  I'll have to experiment.  Thanks!

I threw a seeded jalapeno pepper into the blender with the mangoes. It added a tiny bit of heat and an interesting kick. I reduced simple syrup to 1/2 cup. The recipe as listed makes about 1.25 quarts of sorbet which only serves about four.

Awesome and super simple recipe...just what I was looking for! We have a mango tree and copious amounts of them coming down every day, so I'm compiling recipes for them. This is a keeper! 

I made some adjustments due to the fact that I didn't have fresh limes, so I substituted an equal amount of bottled key lime juice. I also am trying to get away from refined sugar,  so I substituted the simple syrup with 1/3 cup of agave nectar. It only took about 45 minutes to freeze to a nice firm,  but smooth consistency. And it's super yummy!!!

Fabulous! Filled a blender with frozen organic mango, added simple syrup made from 1 cup water, 3/4 cup organic sugar cane sugar, and the juice of 4 key limes. I might use even less sugar next time, but this is my new favorite frozen treat. Thank you so much for the recipe!

SUGAR FREE Recipe. Loved this recipe! I used Nu-Stevia for the sweetener. I don't have an ice-cream maker so after pureeing it, I took a 8 x 12 inch baking pan, sprayed it with Pam, and spread out the puree. After it was frozen, I broke it up into squares, and blended it up with a hand blender. Creamy and delicious and sugar free too.

This turned out great. I used a food processor on accident when I meant to do the blender but oh well. It turned out great and I served it to my parents at dinner with lotus cookies. It was a lot of work cutting the mangos but soooooo worth it. I made it by myself and it was very easy.

Great recipe however the simple syrup I put a little lime zest and 1/2 of a lime juice.  Whenever you make sorbet add 1 Tbs of liqueur any flavor you wish and it will prevent sorbet from turning into a hard block of ice!

This recipe was very easy and really good, although I think it has too much sugar. Ripe mangoes are already really sweet. I added the zest of 2 limes to the boiling water along with the sugar. I only used 3/4 Cup of the syrup and will reduce it to 1/2 cup next time. I left 1/4 of the mango chunky and put the mango, syrup and lime juice in my ice cream maker for 30 mins and then in the freezer. It's really about 4 servings, although there were only 3 of us and we ate it all.
