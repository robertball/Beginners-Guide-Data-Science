The "Ready In" time of 17 minutes seems totally unrealistic. I timed the whole process, and from start to finish it took me an hour and half, mostly because it simply takes a very long time for "most the milk" to evaporate. Still, patience paid off, and the recipe was delicious. It didn't seem as sickeningly sweet to me as some other Indian desserts I've tried, although it certainly is sweet. I used golden raisins, which tasted great, but I think regular raisins would serve as a better garnish because they would provide greater contrast against the cashews and carrots. Although making this dessert took a long time, it was extremely easy and except for the cardamom (which I had to buy for this recipe, but will use in other Indian dishes), the ingredients are all very simple and straightforward. We'll be enjoying this dish in my daughter's 5th grade class tomorrow as part of an early Diwali festival celebration, so thanks to the poster for sharing the recipe.

This is a nice recipe and a simple easy and nutritious dessert to make. I found adding a little bit of condensed milk gives it a nice taste too along with the sugar. you can adjust the quantities according to how sweet you want it to be.

My entire family fell in love with this recipe, even my father who hates carrots. It is sweet and easy. I whipped it up in a few minutes and it was great cold the next afternoon.

This recipe surprised me. I enjoyed it, but no one else in my family did (hence the 4 stars). I substituted part of the milk with sweetened condensed milk (I ran out of reg.) and reduced the sugar. I also added some cinnamon. It added a little warmth to the dish. Please note that the mixture does thicken as it cools.

Instead of regular milk & sugar, I used a 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk. Cooking off the liquid still took 45 min. Everyone liked it though.

I Loved this. I served for breakfast. My picky texture family didn't like it but they made up there minds before they even tasted it. I am giving 5 stars because I thought it was amazing. I made 1/2 the recipe because I didn't have enough carrots. I also substituted Vanilla Almond Milk because of milk allergies in my family. I also used a combination of cashews and almonds. I cut the butter in 1/2 and didn't add any sugar at all. The vanilla almond milk made it sweet enough. I added a little of the carrot milk out of the pan to the pan with the nuts. Instead of cardamon I used a pinch of pumpkin pie spice. SOOO Yummy.

This recipe is delicious!  I’ve tried it with a whole cup and a half cup of sugar and the half cup lets you taste the carrots more but the full cup makes a good desert.  The cardamom is a must to get the full experience of this dish.   Not counting shredding the carrots, I can make this in about 20-30 minutes if I brown the cashews at the same time as I’m cooking the carrots.  For the carrots I cook them on the highest setting my big burner will go and stir constantly so they don’t burn.  This cuts the time down but you have to stir continuously.

This tasted great, but it took me a couple HOURS for the liquid to evaporate.  Even then, it was still a little "wet".

I followed other reviewers' suggestion and started with sweetened condensed milk.  I used 1 pound of carrots, grated, one 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk, and 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon.  From start to finish was about 20 minutes (including peeling & grating the carrots).  Very tasty and sweet enough to be dessert.

very simple to make, but time consuming. It is a bitt too sweet for our taste, even for my kids who are addicted to sugar! Otherwise, delicious and flavourful. Almost addictive! I would add all kinds of nuts to it next time, it would lighten up the sweetness.

I changed this recipe up a bit but LOVED it.  I used coconut milk instead of milk and eliminated all of the sugar.  I think carrots are sweet plus the raisins make for plenty of sugar already.  I added 1-2 teaspoons of cardamom to the coconut milk/carrot mixture so the flavor would infuse.  DELICIOUS!!!  It took far longer than 10 minutes for the liquid to boil off.

i love making this as a dessert or side when we do an indian food night. i do replace the sugar with honey, and the milk always takes longer than the recipe says it should to evaporate for me, but i might just not be cooking it hot enough? either way eventually it all works out and i love the flavors and textures.

I was not thrilled with the texture. It may have been my own impatience; so the way the recipe turned out might be my fault. I would do this recipe again; I think it could be done much like a rice pudding. 

It does store up well in small batches in the frig, but the re-heating gets it back to the soupy texture that I did not like.

I like this very much, but it took nearly an hour for the milk to absorb. There must be an easier way. Who has time on Thanksgiving to stir for an hour?

Delicious!!  1 cup sugar makes this maple syrup sweet; reduce the sugar for more carrot / vegetable flavor.  As with another reviewer, this took much longer than "17 minutes" to cook.  I used 2 cups of 2% milk and 4 cups (32 oz.) of shredded carrots.  It took approximately 90 minutes to boil it down to the point of "most of the milk evaporates" - on medium high, uncovered.  Added cinnamon and ground cloves based on personal preference.  Also toasted some pecans first, before the rest of the topping.  Wonderful!!!

Made the just the way it writhen, including sprinkling with cardamom. Was very good although a bit too sweet, next time will cut the sugar to ¾ of a cup versus a whole cup. My husband said with about half as much sugar he would like it as a breakfast food.

We loved this dish for breakfast!  I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and will go even less next time.  No need to mash or dry - we like it swimming in milky sauce.  I sprinkled it with cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg.  Yum!

My husband's favorite desert is payasam, so when I found this recipe I knew I had to try it.  In addition to tons of carrots I have more pineapple than I can get through, so I pureed, and strained a pineapple into the carrots and milk.  I also toasted some cumin and coriander seeds before crushing them and adding to the cooking carrots. Finally, I didn't have any white sugar, so I used Demerra.  The result is awesome!  Highly recommend this recipe as a jumping off point though I can't speak for the recipe as written which is why  gave it only 4 stars.

I enjoyed making it :)and it taste wonderful with the nuts and carrots. I followed suggestions and upped the heat on the carrots to high - and the milk evaporated quickly. Milk was a mix of 1 cup 2%, 1/2 c heavy cream and 1/2 condensed. I also added pecans and used a mix of Golden and regular raisins. I’ve never been a big fan of carrots but I do love this as a dessert.

Absolutely delicious.  Used one can condensed milk the balance almond milk.  Zero sugar.  More than sweet enough.  Took about 12 minutes for milk to reduce down. Toasted raisins and sliced almonds (husband doesn't like cashews) while stirring carrots.  Quick, easy, will definitely make again.  Cardamom nice touch.

I heated the milk in the microwave for about a minute to speed up the recipe.  After boiling the milk with carrots for 10 minutes then adding sugar, it took another 15 minutes on a slightly higher than medium heat to thicken the mixture.

The flavor was sweet with a texture similar to oatmeal, which the cashews complemented well.  I was pleasantly surprised with the cardamom spice flavor as our household only uses it for chai tea.  We will be making this recipe again soon.

Time's unrealistic, I thought she put her mixture at high on the stove, turned out it was like about 40 to 50 minutes. Add only cardamom and make sure your carrots are mashed when done cooking. Keep moving so they're cooked evenly.

Delicious the way I made it using this as a general idea: I grated four cups of carrots, and in a frying pan (not a saucepan - wanted to keep the boil time low) added the carrots and a can of sweetened condensed milk and on high boiled for about 10 minutes constantly stirring. I did add a  little bit of milk near the end because I wanted the carrots to be soft. After all that had  boiled out (for the most part) I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar. In a seperate pan I melted some butter and added slivered almonds (waht I had on hand) and raisins. I even added some dates I had....after sauteing them for a few minutes I sprinkled some cloves and cinnamon on top of the carrots and put the nut raisin mixture on top and served. All of my very picky children enjoyed this "Indian dessert" and said it tasted like pumpkin pie. Really nice change of pace. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I thought this was great! It helps to have a mixer with a grating blade to get the carrots all cut. I kept the stovetop on high to medium for the whole time and it turned out great, plus the milk evaporated faster. I didn't have cashews on hand, but I chopped up walnuts and toasted them. I also added cinnamon instead of cardamum. It was kind of like hot carrot cake in a bowl.
