The icing was too runny. I tried adding more sugar but it was still not thickened. The taste is fantastic!

For the scone, I used at least 1 1/4 cup flour. 
 Keep adding until the dough sticks together.  For the glaze, I used only 2 Tbl. granular sugar, 1 Tbl. orange juice, and 3/4 tsp. orange zest.  Rolled it into a circle about 8 inches and cut into 8 wedges.  I made it for my pastor & think he will love it!

Great taste! Proportions for the glaze are definitely off. Stated amount of sugar and juice comes out super super runny. Updated recipe would get 5 stars.

I'm an experienced baker but have never made scones! I love citrus so I decided to give this recipe a try. The dough was extremely sticky and the scones were difficult to transfer to the baking sheet but they turned out incredibly light with a little crust on the bottom. The only thing I added was a pinch of salt to the glaze and extra zest throughout. Delish!
