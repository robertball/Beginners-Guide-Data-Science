EXCELLENT!  The sauce is amazing, spot on.  The batter consistency and performance is wonderful.  There's something missing with the shrimp, though.  Not enough to ruin the recipe by a long-shot, but noticeable.  I used Yuengling beer- maybe a stronger tasting beer would have helped?  I think I would also have seasoned the shrimp itself before dipping in the batter.  But seriously...my complaints are minor, this stuff is great!

This was delicious. The only change I made to the recipe - I didn't have peach jam, so I used frozen peach and blended.

Deep fried the shrimp about 3 minutes at 375. Peach sauce was really nice and I'm going to save the batter recipe  for other goodies.
Yup this was quite good and I will make this again.
