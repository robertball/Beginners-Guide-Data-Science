EXCELLENT version of a favorite.  Hubby wouldn't let me use stuffing, so I eliminated the sauted onion and added french fried onions on top.  This will be the recipe I use every year from now on.  Thanks for sharing this.

Have made this a few times and has received rave reviews.  I know a chef who works at an expensive restuarant and he even thinks it is wonderful.  I make it the easy way, using Stove Top Stuffing.  Make sure you don't cover this or else stuffing will get 'mushy'.  Enjoy

This recipe was a huge hit at Christmas dinner and worked very well to make ahead.  I simply prepared the sauce & stuffing topping then assembled and refrigerated until cooking time.  Might try with brocolli & cauliflower next time.

This was wonderful!  My husband ate it cold the next day and loved it!  I used fresh green beans in this recipe rather than the frozen.  Just make sure to cook them a little in boiling water first to soften them up.  I loved it as a main dish!

TRUST ME ON THIS!!! instead of milk use sour cream. it makes this casserole soo much better.Use about 6-8 oz. Milk waters it down and sour cream adds thickness. My family has always made it this way and everyone loves it. You will thank me.

This recipes is amazing! It tastes a lot better than the usual cream of mushroom soup. I did use mild cheddar the first time because sharp can be bitter but next time will try with sharp. Also was a touch sweet - I would use a little less sugar. I'm thinking of adding mushrooms next time for even more pizazz.

This dish was very tasty, made it for Thanksgiving. Much better than the usual green bean casserole. My whole family enjoyed it, including kids.  I used fresh green beans instead of frozen.  Will definitely make again.

Thanks for a great recipe.  SOOO much better than the creamed mushroom version.  The cheese sauce is very tasty and rich.  The small sweetness added from the sugar compliments the green beans.  I added bread crumbs and french-fried onions to the top.  Also added 1 teas. mustard.

I was looking for a green bean casserole recipe that didn't use "cream of whatever" soup, so I was happy to find this one! I really like the topping of prepared stuffing - it makes for a different and unique flavour. I will be making this for years to come. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good!  I made this for Thanksgiving today for just the 2 1/2 of us and it's almost gone! I added 2 cloves of garlic to the onion butter mix, bacon sprinkled over the beans at my husband's request, and topped the stuffing with slivered almonds.  I was hesitant about the stuffing instead of crunchy onions to be honest but it turned out excellent.  My 3 year old even gobbled up his greens with no complaints.  Thanks for a real keeper!

Very good. Made it last night and everyone loved it (a group of 8 people, ranging in age from 15 to 92!) The only change I made was to use three cans of  green beans instead of using frozen green beans. I drained them and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. (Well, I added freshly ground black pepper, but that's it.) It was a good side dish.

I prepared this for a gathering at my house. Everyone really enjoyed it and went back for seconds. I did alter a little bit because in the rush of getting the dinner ready for everyone I forgot to prepare the stuffing. I added another layer of shredded cheese to the top of the green bean mixture in the casserole pan. Then topped it with a mixture of 1 tbs melted butter and crushed ritz crackers. It was fabulous!
Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving instead of the usual "back of the can" green bean casserole. My husband honestly didn't know the difference. There may not be a place in my pantry for cream of mushroom soup any longer. Here are my changes: I used chopped onions and mushrooms as well. Omitted the sugar, used canned beans (cause thats what we like), used velveeta instead of cheddar, and used the crunchy onions instead of stuffing. I love the way it turned out!

Has the potential to be very good, but much too sweet for my taste.  I'll try it again, this time without sugar.

OUTSTANDING. A nicer, lighter, less processed way to go. Have made this twice with fresh green beans and it was well worth the effort.

Served this on Thanksgiving.  Verrrry good.  I used fresh beans, though, steamed them first.  Good re-heated, too.  Nice way to use extra stuffing.

We were blown away by how awesome this dish is. I substituted french fried onions for the stuffing since we love those. This recipe is so delish that we never have next day leftovers (and that's just two people). So much better than the campbell's soup recipe!!!!!!

This blows the canned soup version of GBC out of the water.  My sister and mom insist on that version every year at Thanksgiving, and I am going to change thier minds with this version.  It's just so much better!  I omitted the sugar and topped the casserole with Town House cracker crumbs mixed with a tablespoon of melted butter.  Sinful, but delicious.  I'll make this again for sure.

This was my first time making a green bean casserole but it wont be my last! I did everything as the recipe said but used a whole box of Stove Top and I used fresh green beans as well as a can of green beans. It was good but the fresh ones weren't as soft but it was all very excellent and my husband actually raved about it all night and the following day so I will be definitely making this recipe again. Best part is how easy it is! Might just use canned green beans next time. Thanks a lot!

Yum. This was really good. A bit different than I've had before. But still a classic taste that was delicious. Super easy too. I think the onion is what really makes it.

Beans were a little crunchie after baking.  Next time I will boil them for 5 minutes before adding sauce.  Added 1 minced garlic clove during saute.  Topped with Ritz crackers instead of dressing.

Just okay - A lot more work than the traditional recipe and I didn't think it tasted much better.

I used fresh green beans, cooked first. It was very good - I'm going to make it again for the second week in a row. I will use another 1/2 cup of stuffing this time, though.

The best version of GBC that I have ever made. Everyone loved it. It wasnt too sweet like some comments. Everything blended together just perfect. I would not change anything about this, especially the stuffing. Thanks for sharing.

I really love this recipe after a few changes. I used 30 ounces of frozen green beans, not thawed. I doubled the sauce recipe except for the onions and sugar. I also doubled the stuffing. It fills out the 9x13 perfectly!

I have made this every year for several years now.  The only change I make is doubling the sauce and adding the French Fried Onions instead of the stuffing!  It is my family's favorite dish!

This is a great recipe. My sweet 88 year old Mom does not like the "Green Bean Casserole" that has those "Greasy onions on top" (her words)! So I searched for another version. I have used a lot of different toppings, seasoned bread crumbs, veggie crackers, etc. I took a large casserole to the church pot luck, and it was all gone, and compliments were flying!

Made according to recipe except substituted crispy onions on top instead of stuffing, but I bet stuffing would be great. Next time, I will completely omit the sugar and add a lot of black pepper. Way to sweet for me and my guests.

I don't eat green beans but I made this for Thanksgiving for a medium sized group and there was only about 1 serving left in the dish. I didn't think there would be enough liquid to cook the green beans (used bagged frozen) but I got no complaints. Everyone was grateful for a new twist on a classic dinner staple! I will absolutely make this again.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving this year!  Thanks for the recipe!    I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because to me, it would have been better without the sugar, but still a good recipe.

Wanting to find a green bean casserole recipe that was quick and easy, and didn't require cream of something soup, I came across this page. I tweaked the recipe a bit, using margarine instead of butter as that's all I have, and added parmesan cheese to the mix as well. I also used a bag of frozen Green Giant green beans and carrots. From what I tasted in the sauce (it's still baking!), I think this recipe will fast become a favorite in this house... can't wait for supper time :)

I loved this!! I was looking for a g.b. casserole that didn't require the fried onions (ran out). I thought the stuffing on top was interesting so I gave it a try. It was a hit at Christmas dinner with absolutely no leftovers. I will definitely be making this time and time again.

Excellent, more sophisticated version of the standard Mushroom Soup  recipe. Prepared exactly as written.....used Pepperidge Farm  brand Turkey dressing. I had prepared another off-brand herb-flavored, but didn't use it because it was too salty, so my recommendation is to be choosy about which stuffing you use for the topping. You don't want the topping to overpower the delicious beans!

Great alternative to the cream of mushroom version-especially because my husband hates mushrooms.  Used ritz crackers for a topping because I didn't have stuffing, awesome dish.

Fabulous, this recipe was a hit! I made it for Mother's Day yesterday and everyone loved it including my 4 yr. old nephew...I wasn't sure about all the onions but it turned out well...I will definitely be making this again!!! The only change I made is seasoning the green beans before I added the mix on top of them....

I was so tired of the "cream of mushroom" version, so I'm glad that I came across this recipe.  My husband, however, is watching his calories.  I used a light sour cream and cheese, as well as topping with crushed corn flakes instead of stuffing.  It was still great!  Can't say that my kids liked it, though.  I guess some things just aren't easy to disguise!  Thanks for sharing.

This was very yummy, the only way i had cooked green beans before was heated up from a can or from the garden with potatoes. So this was real treat. My children loved it and my hubby loved it too. Im a happy camper when I can cook for my family and see them devour it :)

Fantastic! Much better than the generic, cream of mushroom, green bean casserole in my opinion!

Update to review: Forgot to mention that I did alter the recipe a little to cut down on calories in fat and carbohydrates by substituting 2% milk for the regular milk and Light sour cream for the regular sour cream. Also omitted the sugar and salt. There is enough sweetness and saltiness from the other ingredients. Nobody noticed the difference! Still delicious!

This has been a favorite for years! I am surprised I haven't reviewed it before now. It is very easy to make and truly delicious. It was full of flavor but not too rich for my stomach after I had been sick and couldn't eat for 3 days. In fact, I had made a double batch over the weekend and today was my first day back to work where I ate a serving of this. My stomach had no problems with it. Had all of the nutrients to gain back some strength too!

Found this recipe in 2011 and have been making it every year for thanksgiving since, always a hit, never any leftovers!!
If you are going to use a 9x13 dish, it is best to double the recipe, otherwise use a smaller dish to make as is.

I have never tried green bean casserole because I absolutely hate mushrooms, decided I'd go through Allrecipes and find a recipe that was more 'from scratch' and didn't have any mushrooms. I followed this recipe as written (I use fresh green beans and boil them instead of using frozen). The cheese sauce is amazing and goes well with the green beans and topped stuffing (other reviewers replaced the stuffing with the traditional 'French fried onions', I'm sure it's just as good). Easy to make, highly recommend!

I think that when the onions are sautéed, minced garlic should be thrown in as well. I don't know why I didn't think of that when I started!!

Tasty, and healthy too. Based on other reviewers saying it was too sweet with 1 tbsp of sugar, I used 1 tsp of sugar instead. I made it with turkey stuffing on top.

Has wonderful flavor. The only thing to change is use canned green beans frozen ones are way to hard.

I've made this twice. First for Thanksgiving and yesterday for Christmas.

For Thanksgiving, I didn't have a full cup of Onion so I used about half a cup or half a small onion. Also, I had two types of stuffing, one with cranberries and one with celery. I chose to the use the Cranberry Stuffing and it turned out amazing. I craved this dish until yesterday when I made it again. 

This time, I had enough onion so I used a full cup and all I had was regular celery stuffing. Eh. It's still good, but not as crave-worthy this time around. 

Next time, (and there will be a next time) I will add some cranberries if the stuffing doesn't already have them in it and I'll halve the onion again.

I was assigned Green Bean casserole last year for our family Thanksgiving. I've never eaten it since I don't like mushrooms and was excited in finding a recipe where I didn't need mushrooms or cream or mushroom soup.  I was even more excited at how wonderfully delicious this is.  I now make this any chance I get!  Great recipe and not too difficult!  I don't use the stuffing though, I just add fried onions to the top, and still leave them in the sauce, but I like onion so it's good to me.  I've also made it with no onion to accomodate a family member and it was still delicious!!  Wish I could give this many more than 5 stars!!

This was pretty bland.  I thought the cheese in the sour cream would help, but I've definately had much better green bean casseroles.
