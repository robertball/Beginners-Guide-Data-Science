Hubs made dinner for us tonight and these potatoes were part of it. They were excellent.  He used a slightly smaller pan than called for and sliced, rather than cubed the potatoes, but beyond that he strictly stuck to the recipe. We both were really impressed and cleaned these up like nobody's business.  So much better, in my view, than the au gratin potatoes with the cheese mixed in with the sauce (the very popular "Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes," also from this site, comes to mind). He didn't measure the cheese, just sprinkled it over the top till it looked just right.  The cheese melts and forms a delicious crust over the rich, creamy potatoes.  The garlic was just enough to add a little flavor dimension and interest.  The fact that it wasn't necessary to cook the sauce on the stove-top first was an added bonus. He served these with a perfectly prepared prime rib roast, steamed broccoli and "Brussels Sprouts with Green Peppers," also from this site.  It couldn't have been a better dinner.

These are very tasty.  Try boiling the potatoes for about 10 minutes at first, then put together and bake.

This was a good dish, but it didn't "wow" my taste buds. The sauce was creamy, had lots of garlic flavour and the potato just melted in my mouth. I had no problem with the baking time. Served it with Garlic Cheddar Chicken from this site. Thanks for Sharing.

Some said this is boring, but I found the cheddar that you use makes or breaks it.  For an amazing dish, use a really sharp or old cheddar, really kicks up the taste!

This was good but not so sure if its worth all those calories! I probably baked it to long cause it wasnt creamy at all. The flavor was good though (i love garlic)If i make this again, i will try using whole milk instead of heavy cream. I think it will work just fine.

This was very good! The cooking time for me was a bit shorter probably because I cut the potatoes into fork friendly pieces. I also omitted the milk and used an extra bit of heavy cream. I increased the cheese and used sharp I am planning on adding this recipe to my holiday dinners!

Cheesy, creamy potatoes....this dish is delectable! I made a large batch to serve to family and friends and they turned out perfect! The only change I made was to add a little more salt and pepper as well as to add about 1/4 c. finely chopped sweet onions to the cubed potatoes before covering with the sauce. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

I needed this recipe to use as a starting point.  I wanted to fill my large slow cooker so, I sliced thin 10 potatoes, 1 stick of butter,  1 pint of heavy cream, 1/2 cup of milk, 1 cup cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of parmasan cheese, a pinch of nutmeg, 1 tsp thyme, and a few heavy shakes of garlic powder.  I didn't have flour so, I sprinkled the potatoes with 3 tsp of Bisquick then heated the cream, butter, milk, cheeses and pour it over the potatoes. Set the slow cooker to HIgh for 4.5 hours. Crazy Yummy!!!

In case people are looking for a heavy cream substitute, I found this.  
    3/4 cup milk
    1/3 cup butter
1. Melt the butter.  2. Pour it into the milk, and stir. 3. Use in place of one cup of heavy cream. Note: This substitute  while not whip. Tip: If you use low-fat milk, add a tablespoon of flour to the mixture to thicken.

This is a nice easy dish with great flavor.  I used red potatoes and they came out creamy and delicious.   I added extra cheese â€“ but I always add extra cheese; used 1 1/2 C of light cream, and I  baked it an extra 30 minutes because I feel the baking time was inaccurate in the recipe.  This is a tasty dish that I'll be making again.

I sliced these instead of cutting into pieces.  I baked them for about 30 minutes with the foil on, then stirred them gently.  They looked a little dry, so I added about 1/2 cup more each of cream and milk.  I baked them another 35 minutes and added the cheese.  I didn't measure, just sprinkled over until it looked good.  I baked about 5 minutes more to melt the cheese.  We loved them. They were so creamy and good!  I will be making these more often!

There was nothing really special about this dish.  I am going to try again adding a four cheese mix from my deli to the milk mixture; think this will boost the taste where we would like it better.

I am giving this recipe a 3 purely based on taste...it tasted great! I followed many of the suggestions (used the mandoline and soaked in cold salt water, layered with cheese, added spices, etc), and after 60 minutes it was still undercooked!  I used a 9x13 lasagna pan, and felt like I only had enough sauce for 3 layeres (I changed the recipe size to 8, since I got potato happy on the mandolin), and the potatos were curling and wouldn't lay straight.  There was definitely too much liquid, even after resting.  Can anyone suggest what I may have done wrong? Smaller pan maybe?

Very good! I wanted to serve au gratin potatoes w/ Easter dinner. Not wanting to make my usual recipe (which calls for canned items), I was on the lookout for something w/ a little homemade pizzaz. B/c my ham had to cook at 350 deg. for 2.5 hrs., I needed a recipe that also cooked at the same temp., so I decided to give Ingalyn's recipe a try. The thought of 2 cups of melted cheese on top of my potatoes didn't appeal to me, so I added finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese (fine shreds melt better) to my cream/milk/flour mixture & heated on med-low heat, whisking constantly until melted. I dbl. everything to accommodate the 6 adults & child I was serving (who all wanted seconds!). To speed prep, I used a food processor to thinly slice my potatoes. I then put them in a lg. pot of ice H2O & set in the fridge until I was ready to assemble (just be sure to drain WELL!). I sliced my potatoes quite thin, so I only had to cook them for 40 min. (covered the entire time). I then added an add'l. 1/2 c. of cheese on top (IN ADDITON to the 2 c. add. to my sauce) &  broiled on low for at least 3-4 min. to brown & crisp the top. After resting for 10 minutes, my sauce thickened nicely. Other than my fiance commenting that these were too garlicky (he's SOOO picky!), everyone had nothing but positive comments about them. I still like my good 'ol standby recipe (yes, canned items CAN be good!), but I'm glad I gave this a try. It sure impressed everyone! Thanks for sharing, Debbie! :)

I thought these were excellent.  Theya re very mild but this is how I remember Au Gratin potatoes being when I was younger.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used a substitute recipe.  I put down a layer of potatoes then sprinkled with some cheese before topping withthe second layer of potatoes and cream.  This way there was more cheese throughout - yum!

UPDATE:  I had to come back and upgrade to a 5 after my husband & I (just the 2 of us) darn near ate the entire batch.  Highly recommend adding cayenne and probably scaling down garlic to 3 cloves.  Regardless, a new favorite - we love.  ORIGINAL NOTES:  Using a mandoline, I sliced potatoes at apx 1/6".  Also added a dash of parsley & cayenne, then proceeded as written.  Flavor was outstanding - love the way the garlic came through.  Mine were done at exactly 60", and beginning to burn as all the liquid had either burned off or been soaked up.  Next time, need to either cut thicker or use a smaller pan (try 9x9).  Aside from that, simply outstanding.

This is our all time favorite  - actually a classic as far as I know.   Sometimes I add fresh rosemary depending on what I am serving.   Difficult to judge exactly how long they take to bake because it depends on what type of potato I use but do prefer not to precook.

Wonderful. I had never made Au Gratin potatoes before and following the recipe almost exactly (skim milk, eyeballed the cheese to generously cover the top) no one would have guessed. I did use good quality, fresh grated sharp cheddar: I routinely cook with shredded bagged lowfat cheese but in a simple recipe like this, cheese is the star and can make or break the dish. Thanks for submitting!

I love this recipe, but it does take longer to bake then it says.  I use sharp cheddar and mince some onion in with the garlic. Otherwise I follow the basic directions. I found this recipe a few months ago and have made it four times and already! I save it in my favorites!

Great recipe! I actually forgot the flour (which, of course, makes it thick) - so my dish was a little loose - but still good!  I will use flour next time!  Also, what I did was: salt pepper and paprika the potatoes - and did layers of potatoes, sauce and then cheese (to be sure all was even).  Also, when I took the tin foil off, I sprinkled Italian Bread Crumbs on top and let it cook uncovered for another 20 minutes.  AWESOME! It's going into our menu rotation for sure!

These took much longer to cook than the recipe stated. In addition, it cried out for salt - among other seasonings. Meh.

This is a good base recipe - now I just need to get the seasoning right.  I used an 8 x 10 casserole dish and sliced four medium-large russet baking potatoes.  I had three layers of potatoes with fresh broccoli florets in between.  I ended up adding 1 1/2 cups half n half, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and four tablespoons flour, and the consistency of the sauce was perfect.  I seasoned the potato layers as another suggested, but it was still a bit bland.  Next time I will also add salt and pepper to the sauce mixture.  I also added some onion powder and next time I think I will add a little heat, maybe some chipotle powder.  I didn't want the cheese to stick to the foil, so once the potatoes were soft, I removed the foil, added the cheese, and baked until the cheese was bubbly.  And of course we used sharp cheddar - I never buy anything less than sharp.  I would love to try this with some other cheeses as well, maybe add some Manchego.  This could easily be customized to pair with the seasonings in your main dish.

I really liked this recipe because you didn't have to start with the butter flour mixture in the saucepan. This was very easy and tasted pretty good too. I used all whole milk and I think it worked out fine. Will make again, thanks.

2.11.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/173941/steak-house-au-gratin-potatoes/ ... Everyone liked these!  Wow, wow!  I doubled in a 9x13, using 2T butter in dish, 6 medium or a bit smaller potatoes, 3/4c milk, 3T flour, 1 1/2c heavy cream, garlic powder (shh! ;D)  I combined the some of the milk & flour then added remaining milk & other ingredients.  Mine took longer to bake, as expected.  I placed cut up Polish sausage on top for the last half hour.  No cheddar, but a little Parmesan & parsley.  I'd much rather cut cubes than slices & not cook sauce!  Woooo!  :)  Thanks, BF!

I cubed potatoes really small, placed in a 9x13 pan, then microwaved on high for 8 min before doing the rest of the recipe.  I mixed most of the cheddar in with the potatoes before microwaving.  It was well received!  I also used about 50% fat free half and half and 50% skim milk for the milk and cream mixture

These were pretty good, my family gobbled them up.  However, I think I might try increasing the cream sauce next some next time so they will be creamier. Maybe it's because my potatoes were bigger than the recipe, but it only stated 3 russets and not the size so I tried to stay in the medium to medium large size.  They did take longer to bake and I cut mine in small cubes. I'm going to take the advice of another reviewer and try boiling them for about 10 minutes before baking to cut down on the time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

OK. Love the ease of prep.Sliced the potatoes instead of cubing them. Will try a higher quality cheddar next time. Make sure you season to your liking.

Omg! This dish was delicious! I've made au gratin potato recipes before and I have always felt they came out just a little too cheesy and overpowered the main dish. This was absolutely perfect. I did not have heavy cream, so I used someone's tip of using milk and adding melted butter to it. I also added just about a half cup of freshly shaved Parmesan cheese to the potato mixture and baked for about 45 minutes before adding the cheddar to the top. Another 20 minutes and it was just perfect. Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely make again.

I made these primarily to use up some  heavy cream, judging by my family's reaction I will be making these for special occasions in future. My garlic cloves were huge so I only used 2. Thankyou Ingalyn for a great recipe that my family loved.

Yummy!  I used some small brown potatoes because that's all I had in the house.  Used whole milk instead of reduced fat and also boiled potatoes for 10 minutes to speed cooking time after reading someone another review.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I thought this was pretty good but it seemed to be missing a little something in my opinion.  Perhaps it was spice or maybe I didn't use a high enough quality cheese.  I will try out some modifications for next time.

Delicious! I reduced the garlic to 1 tbsp minced but added 1 tbsp minced onion. I only had skim milk so I used that. The cooking times were exactly right for me but I thinly sliced my potatoes like traditional au gratin. I did turn on the broiler for an extra 5 minutes to get that nice browned top. Stirring the grated cheddar into the top just a little helps prevent one solid sheet of cheese. Have already added this one to my recipe box and even called my mom to come over and taste it! Wonderful!

Best au gratin potatoe recipe I have found and I've been cooking for over 20 years.  I have added cooked chopped bacon and green onion to the potatoe before I add the cream, gives it a loaded baked potato taste....yummy!!!

This is OK! It was creamy, and  I took someone else's advise, and boiled my cubed potatoes for 10 minutes.  The flavor is lacking, maybe instead of the 2% milk use chicken stock.

These sounded amazing, so I tried them.  They were very good.  I did cube my potatoes and boiled for 10 min to lessen the bake time so they wouldn't dry out.  I used half the garlic called for, and they were still very flavorful.  I also used very sharp cheddar and also added some onion salt.

Loved the flavor. I didn't have heavy cream so tried to substitute with whole milk and butter but it came out kind of clumpy. Will try again with the cream and maybe add some Dijon mustard to kick it up a little. Did take a little longer to cook than listed. Overall I really liked it, but didn't love it. Close!

I sliced the potatoes instead of cubing them, and it came out so delicious and I am a professional chef so I know what I am talking about. I served the potatoes to my family with steak and some string beans and it came out so so so so good. They raved about it and said to write in my review that whoever posted this is a good cook. I am making it for New years eve and I cannot wait for more of my family's reactions to the best potatoes recipe ever!!!!

I made this for dinner tonight exactly as written;I am rating it a three b/c I will make it again but with some changes. Next time I will use 5 potatoes and double the sauce (we are a family of 6) and use the same size pan.  I thought the pan was too big for the recipe as written.  I will cut down on the garlic and like another reviewer suggested, use sharp cheddar cheese.  I would add hot sauce but not everyone in the family likes that. A great base but needs some tweaking.

I didn't have cream so I used sour cream plus I added an extra T of butter, 1/2 t seasoned salt, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t coarse black pepper and 1 T chives. I also added an additional 1/2 cup of cheese before I added the sauce. It was delicious!!!

I thought these lacked a little bit in flavor. Maybe some herbs or something else? Great texture and creaminess.

The only change I meant to make was not peeling the potatoes and adding some mustard powder (ended up not being able to taste it) but I somehow left out the garlic. It was a little lacking in flavor but I can't say that's not due to that error with the garlic. They were nice and creamy though and my cheese melted through without returning to the oven. I wold probably try mixing the cheese into the sauce next time just because I think we would prefer it that way. The baking time may be a little long though because I barely fit it all into a 9x9 rather than a 9x13(don't have one) and it was still perfectly done in the 60 min specified.

This recipie is a good base recipe. Kinda bland as is, but very creamy. the only changes i made was by adding dry mustard seasoning, some thyme, and layered half the potatoe then addedd half of the cheese mixture. then added the rest of the potatoe and topped with remaining cheese sauce. good overall though.

Very good but I just felt like it was lacking something. I would make again but I think I want to add something else to it though. Thanks for sharing!

This sounded perfect for my prime rib buffet dinner party.  It was a mess.  It boiled over which resulted in a burnt smell just as guest were arriving.  The potatoes took forever to cook.  I'd recommend precooking the potatoes, which also may make the whole mix better tasting.  It was like chunks of potatoes with a cheese sauce.  I guess I expected a nice smooth sauce with softer potatoe.  Overall the flavor was good, but I expected greatness for this party and was very disappointed.  Probably just the cook!  I'll try it again with my recommendations

These were just so delicious.  I loved them and will certainly make them again and again.  I pretty much  followed the recipe as written but I did slice the potatoes rather than dice them, also added plenty of salt and pepper to the cream mixture.  Baked for an extra 10 minutes, then put them under the grill for 5 minutes just to crisp slightly.

Yup - these are good!  Nice and garlicky with a good cheddar flavour.  I used red potatoes because that's all I had and the end result was good....but I bet it would be better with Velveeta instead of real cheddar.

I messed up & put the cheese in with the flour (didn't read ahead) but came out anyway. Will make again, but probably make extra sauce. I didn't have the heavy cream, but used 1/2 & 1/2 that I had & I thought they were creamy & didn't need the extra fat.

Made this last night.  Followed recipe.  Used what I had on hand so I used whole milk for 2 percent and pepper jack cheese since it was the only cheese I had in the house.  Came out perfect.  My husband and I say it's a keeper!  Cook time was on target, I made sure the potatoes were cubed uniformly so that there was an even cook.  I look forward to trying other versions with this recipe.

This made a delicious side to some broiled salmon for dinner tonight. I tried to make it healthier by using only 1% milk  for all the liquids called for. Also I needed 2 lb of potatoes. 5 medium pieces ( sliced instead of cubes) to fill the 9x13 pan. I would use a smaller pan, and less potatoes next time.

I substituted the low fat milk with a small amount of half and half.  Came out less runny and had a much more savory flavor.

Really bad recipe. Made this about a week ago and followed the recipe EXACTLY and when it was done we had a casserole dish with under cooked potatoes and the cheese sauce had separated from the potatoes in gelatinous globs. Won't be making this again.

I prepared this as written and it was very good. Now, I add some cooked, crumbled bacon and onion that I cooked in the bacon grease. I also add some cheese to the  potatoes before cooking.

These were so good I made them 2 nights in a row! Great recipe that you can adapt to your own taste and so easy to make. I used the same dish that I baked them in to add and mix the ingredients so clean up was a breeze.

Made these as a side to an inhome date night steak dinner! Total hit! They were delicious! The only think I did different was slice the potatoes and we decided we wanted to add onion. So I thinly sliced onions and added them. These are a definitely going to be made again! Thanks

Good recipe but I found the time off.   It took at least 30 minutes longer than the recipe stated.   I did double the recipe, but I also used a bigger pan, so the potatoes should have been about the same thickness as the original.   I will probably make again.

These are really good and so easy!  I'm not sure why anyone would ever make a boxed version after making these.  I looked thru a lot of recipes and many are either just like mac & cheese but with potatoes and I wasn't looking for anything that heavy.  Others were just like flour, butter and milk w/no cheese at all.  These were a perfect mix - creamy and good w/out being a gooey, cheesy dish.

Divine! However, I used all heavy cream for liquid and I sliced potatoes thin and boiled them for 5 mins first. I added lightly sauteed chopped onion between my two layers of potato and sauce and also added a pinch of chicken boulion granules to the cream mixture just because I always do (adds that restaurant flavor to cream sauces). I cut the garlic to one tsp of jar minced. We each devoured an ungodly amount lol. Sooo good!

I was really impressed with this dish. I made it to go with pork chops and fresh green beans. I made a couple of changes, nothing major. I sliced the potatoes and used cheddar and Colby jack cheeses. I kept everything else the same. Cooking time was the same for me also. When I make this again I think I will layer the potatoes and cheese then top with cheese. Notice I said "when" because this was a keeper for my family.

I sliced the potatoes and added some chives to the cream mixture. I also added a layer of cheese between the layers of potatoes as others had recommended. Cooked according to the instructions but found some potatoes were a bit underdone. So a little longer cook time will be noted in my mind for next time. All in all, it's a great side dish to my cubed steak and roasted green beans!

Used Scott's "Au Gratin Ruth's Chris" which is almost identical for Christmas 2015.  Sliced on mandolin and halved the slices.  Par baked (20 mins covered, 20 uncovered), put it fridge overnight, then finished cooking 20 mins +cheese just before serving.

Yum, used sliced rather than cubed potatoes and slighter more potatoes- five instead of three . Would be good if the recipe said the weight of potatoes to use.  My potatoes may have been smaller. Loved the garlic, loved the creamy indulgent taste. Served with roast chicken and carrots - will definitely make again.

I loved not having to cook the sauce on the stove!!  The taste could use some work.  I even added a lot of onion powder to them.  Will definitely keep using the recipe, but will try to work on the flavor.  Might try with chicken broth instead of the 1/2 cup milk or maybe more garlic. Thank you for an Au Gratin recipe that I didn't have to cook the sauce!!  My mother-in-law doesn't make a sauce and she sprinkles her flour between layers of potatoes, then pours milk over it.  You get hunks of flour in your potatoes (YUCK).  Soooooo glad I found this recipe (without hunks of flour) and no cooking the sauce!!

Didn't have any heavy cream, so I used all FF half-and-half which worked out fine.  I put in a layer of sliced potatoes (used the food processor), then added some sliced onion (added good flavor), and layered the rest of the potatoes on top.  Certainly was easy to make, timing was spot on, just not as creamy as I would have liked, but we still enjoyed it.

Delicious!!! Halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pan.  Followed the recipe exactly...but I didn't measure the cheese.  Just shredded some extra sharp cheddar and colby jack as that's what I had on hand and threw it on top.  Very easy and much less salty than the boxed variety.  Will definitely make these again.  Thank you for a simple and tasty recipe!!

Made this for Easter lunch, and followed the directions exactly except for the cheese...I used a mix of extra sharp cheddar and colby jack. It was a huge hit, even with my 93 year old great grandma!

These were great! Now I had to make changes, out of necessity, not improvement. I did not have the garlic avaiable so I substituted 1/2 of a teaspoon of garlic powder for the minced garlic. I also sliced instead of cubed but I think that is everyone's own preference. My family loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

These were very delicious and easy to make. Instead of all the heavy cream, I used 1/4 cup of Half and Half and 1/2 cup of 1% milk. I also used low fat shredded cheese--a colby jack mix. They still tasted very creamy and cheesy!

Wonderful! I left the skins on and sliced them, rather than peeling and cubing. So glad I did. I might try extra garlic next time, as they were lacking a tad bit of something. But, they were fantastic and SO easy!

This was gppd but was missing something to set it off. I followed one persons advice and added onions in with the potatoes which was good, but next time I think I'll play around with a few different spices and try to give it a little more flavor

It was yummy! Not sure if it is worth all the calories though.  I used too much cheese instead of following the directions.  The cheese was so overwhelming I couldn't taste the creamy stuff so be sure to stick to the recipe. I will make again when feeling decadent.

This recipe is a great start to au gratin potatoes though I didn't get exactly the texture of potato I was hoping for. I do like how the potatoes held up for leftovers and will likely use this recipe again as a base to explore more ideas in the future.
