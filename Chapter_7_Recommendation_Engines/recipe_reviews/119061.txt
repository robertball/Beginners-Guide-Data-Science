My wife chose this salad recipe for us tonight, and I happily prepared it and happily ate it.  Only three people have reviewed this? And not since 2010?   You all don't know what you're missing! Everything about this is perfect, from the salad dressing to the selection of ingredients.  Good quality ingredients help - we used a nice, aged balsamic vinegar and olive oil packed Italian tuna filets.  We cleaned our plates to the last leaf of lettuce.

This was a very simple salad, it looked nice and tasted good but nothing spectacular.

This was delicious! I halved the recipe (but used a bit extra lettuce). The tomatoes, onion and the eggs did make a lot of difference in taste. The cheese not so much, so if you want to cut on fat you can omit the cheese. Nice way to get your omega-3 for dinner or lunch! Thanks for the recipe!
