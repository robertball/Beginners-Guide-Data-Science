This was pretty tasty! Be sure to season your salmon with salt at the minimum, because it came out a little bland.  I don't know about grating (?) tomato, but I just chopped mine into a very small dice and that worked out well.  I wouldn't recommend putting the salmon in for the full 10 mins to simmer. Since it's already cooked, it was starting to fall apart after only 4-5 mins and I didn't want to overcook it. I served it over brown jasmine which definitely completed the dish. Yum!
