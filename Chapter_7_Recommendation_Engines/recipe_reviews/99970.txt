Did not have any cotija cheese, so substituted a hard dry cheese that I had on hand. Forgot to put the shredded monterey jack on and it was still very good. Will keep in my favorites file!

4.5 Stars:  This was different and very good.  I served with the broken pasta found in the Hispanic section.  My husband suggested a rice/pasta mix for a little more texture.  All in all, a surprisingly good (and easy) dish.

Made this the other night for my husband and one of his friends...all I can say is completely clean plates! :) All they could talk about was how good the cotija cheese was in this dish. I'm so glad I took the time to seach it out in the grocery store. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Easy to put together and really delicious!  Chicken was moist and flavorful.  Used reduced sodium taco seasoning.  Served with Spanish Rice recipe from this site.

I liked it.   Something different to do with chicken.  I also added a few dashes of hot sauce (Tapitio) to the tomato sauce for a bit more flavor.  Also added garlic powder to the chicken while browning on top of the stove.  Fast and easy.

So easy.  This doesn't mean it isn't tasty tho!!!  I have made this multiple times and find it divine.  Just don't go overboard with cheese.  Also I love this with Mexican Rice :)

4.8 stars.  This recipe is so simple to make, yet the flavors are just so strong and quite satisfying.  I saved the sauce to make quesadillas later.  This is restaurant quality.

I came from California with the best Mexican authentic restaurants, to Louisiana where they are a hit or miss.  So rather than be disappointed, I cook at my Mexican food at home and Allrecipes has a lot of great recipes (Chile Rellanos, yum).  This dish does not disappoint.  I've made this several times and its always a winner.  I use the Jalape√±o  El Pato sauce in place of tomato sauce to give it a kick.  This dish served with spanish rice and refried beans, its a restaurant meal of five stars.

Everyone loved it.  Real simple.  Served over spanish rice with tomatillo soup.  Did use more jack than the spanish cheese to tame the salt everyone reported.

The cheese makes this SO salty. The rest is just OK, a little boring. It was quick and easy. I love cheese, and this was on the edge of being too cheesy and with that much Cotija Cheese, it was way too salty for me.

Hi Jen,  Thanks for a great recipe.  I used a low sodium taco seasoning.  This is moist and flavorful for all at the table.  Served with homemade refried beans, rice and salad.

Made this as written....it was just a tad salty and definetly could have used some heat. I served it with mexican rice and a green salad. The next time I make this I am going to add some hot sauce and use my own spices instead of the packet to cut down on the salt....thinking about trying it out in the crockpot as well.
