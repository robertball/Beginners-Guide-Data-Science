I made this for a Christmas gathering.  My family loved it.  It was the first bowl to empty.  Quick and easy recipe.  I used microwave popcorn.  Delicious!

excellent. I subbed honey roasted peanuts for the pecans, and I added m&ms to the mix once it was cooled. I also doubled the recipe so I could share with friends. This is really great, not really like caramel corn, more of a crunchy toffee-like coating on the mix- very addicting.

Very addictive!  I used dry roasted peanuts since I have a friend that's allergic to pecans, and accidentally baked it an extra 15 minutes (reading way too many recipes = getting a bit confused!) but I think that helped cut down on the sticky factor.  I drizzled melted milk chocolate on it and it tasted just like Poppycock.  I did forget to put in the rice cereal (oops!)  Oh well, I guess that means I'll have to make this again!

Awesome! I used 1/2 cup pecans, 1/2 cup peunuts and 4 cups honey nut chex squares.  They were awesome.  I will be making this every Christmas! This was so easy.

Very delicious & easy to make!! I made this for a family party. Everyone loved it & asked for the recipe. I switched dry roasted peanuts for pecans. Also, it makes a bit too much to fit in one bowl.  I actually had to use my 2 biggest bowls & still put the rest in glass baking pan.  Served in cupcake cups for the party.

SOOOO good! It's true... you can't stop eating it. The rice Chex cereal adds such a nice crunch to the mix. I've made this a few times now and it's great as-is. However, if you want to play with the recipe a bit I've found that Reese's peanut butter baking chips are an awesome addition!! YUM!

Yummy snack mix and very hard to stop eating once you start! Fairly simple to put together, which is great when looking for something to bring to a party or put out for a impromptu gathering. I did use microwave light butter popcorn rather than air popped, we had it in the pantry and weren't using it. I also substituted cashews for the pecans.

This stuff is so good you will not believe it!  And so very easy to make.  I used Crispix cereal and soy nuts because my son is allergic to tree nuts.  It came out awesome.  I highly recommend this as a standard snack at any party...or even just for a weekend treat.

This was so easy and turned out wonderful.  I baked it in two 9x13 glass pyrex dishes.  I am going to try it with peanuts next time in place of the pecans.

This is now the favorite of my family, friends and co-workers. I like the versatility as you can up the pocorn or pretzels and the coating. Wonderful recipe!

This was a quick and easy snack mix to make.  I didn't have enough pecans so used a mixture of dry roasted peanuts and almonds.  I baked it in a 275* oven for 30 minutes, stirring as indicated on teh recipe.  Will definitely make this again.

This is super-duper delicious! Just be sure to work quickly to mix all ingredients together because it firms up very quickly! I made this for a family hike and packed into individual snack bags. Everyone loved it--ages 5-75!!!! Will make again and again!!!

Most excellent!  I did follow other suggestion to add peanut M & M's after the baking and used a huge stainless steel mixing bowl to bake instead of a cookie sheet.  It worked very well!

So easy and so yummy!!! I can't get enough of this recipe.  I baked the popcorn mix for only 20 minutes otherwise it was a little too crispy for me and tasted burnt.  I brought it to a party alongside someone else's no bakes and my dish was empty by the end of the night while the no bakes were still there!  I can't believe how easy this was!  It's going to definitely be a favorite from now on :)!!!

Loved this! I baked it between 250-275 for 1/2 hour, stirring every 10 minutes like someone recommended. I also added M & M's.

I use different types of nuts like roasted peanuts or cashews (whatever I can afford at the time) along with any Chex type cereals.  It's a hit for the fall and winter holidays.

Easy to make, great tasting! As others have posted, it is important to let the mix cool on a pan lined with wax paper to ensure that the mix does not clump. I will continue to make this recipe as my children gulped it up within minutes! Children and adults will love this!

Super!  I used dry roasted peanuts, Crispix and added some cherrios also.  A good recipe that you can add and subtract to.  It is a great snack mix for a card group.  As long as I had the ingredients - I made 2 recipes which makes a lot.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I had to leave the pecans out because I was taking it to a school function and there is a "no nut" policy, but I had several people come up and ask for the recipe.

I made this last night to keep the children entertained while I babysat them. They had just as much fun making this as they did eating it!! =) I like to lengthen the time (entertainment) by popping my own corn. I found a place that has good kernals (pop well) I use their mushroom popcorn- it is a sturdier ppcorn than microwave, so it doesnt crumble to bits when the kids mix it up.

Turned out perfectly! I followed the recipe to a tee except I baked it at 285 degrees. Everything is coated and crisp, not sticky at all. Love it. I'm going to make a new batch tomorrow to give as Christmas gifts.

Made this for the first time the other day to bring to a party and everyone loved it!  It was so good that I made another batch the next day for myself.  I baked it in a pot and then spread the mixture out to cool.  Very easy and no mess!!  I will be making this all the time.

The second batch turned out very tasty.  Followed the directions for 300 and 30 min the first time and it came out burnt.  2nd time I put it at 250-275, still for 30 minutes, but checked and stirred in 10 minute intervals.  Turned out much better.  Also lined the 9x13 pans I had it in with parchment paper and I think that helped as well.  Would make this again.  Giving it as treats for family at Christmas.  We'll see what they think about it!

This recipe is so easy & so good. My biggest problem was finding a bowl big enough for 15 cups of the dry ingredients - I used a large paper grocery bag - easy to shake & stir in the caramel - easy clean up too!  One batch made 6 treat bags

this is delicious and very addicting!!  I used wheat checks, and butter pretzels.  I did add a bit of salt to the brown sugar mixture.  Opted for peanuts instead of pecans.  It doesn't matter what add-ins you opt for, it is the buttery toffee goodness of the brown sugar caramel sauce that is spectacular.  I made a double batch.  No one could stay out of it.  thanks so much!

Easy peasy! I made this for my brothers birthday and i didnt have pretzels but i added pecan, cinnamon and pumpkin seed. Id say definitely pick out all un popped kernels for sure and dont skip the chex mix as that rice crisp is what makes it!

Everything I wanted...Easy, Fun, absolutely delicious! I have made this 3 times now, once with the middle school granddaughters who really enjoyed the process AND the snacking! I subbed honey roasted peanuts for pecans and threw in some dry Asian noodles...the kind you use for haystacks cookies. Just put in a bit less of the rice chex cereal to accommodate it .  Have at it...smiley face.

This is a really good start. Personally, I cut the recipe in half, because there is only two of us, and there was still a lot. Next time, I'd use half the popcorn, and maybe add another kind of cereal for variety, or add more chex. My mixture didn't clump into chunks, it was all pretty loose. But I did follow the instructions to a T. I'd also add more camel sauce for it as well.

I made this for the first time back in 2006-yes, 9 years ago...it was so good. However, I was new to cooking and I didn't know what crispy rice cereal was, I searched the grocery shelves and all I could come up with was Rice Krispies Treats Cereal to put in. Even though now I know what rice cereal squares are, I'd rather use the Krispies Treats cereal, it is sooooo good!!!! This mix may or may have not got me out of the hot seat with my boss a few years back, it's that good!

This stuf is possitively SINFUL it's so good!!! I couldn't stop eating it even before I put it in the oven. I found that putting the mix and the sauce a huge tuperware container with a lid and shaking it was the easiest way to mix it evenly. Enjoy!!!

Made this to take to the game and it worked great!  I used peanuts because I had them and we all loved it.  I will need to buy a bigger bowl because my biggest bowl could not hold all the ingredients and I certainly wouldn't have been able to mix the sauce in so I had to use 2 big bowls which worked out fine.

Thanks for posting the recipe!
