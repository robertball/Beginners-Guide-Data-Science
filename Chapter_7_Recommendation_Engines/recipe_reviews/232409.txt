I made this recipe just as instructed and it came out pretty good, but I'm going to make a few changes next time.  I will mix the pineapple juice and with the rest of the seasonings first, then pour the whole thing over the chicken.  I got little "pockets" of ginger seasoning on the pineapple chunks from sprinkling it on top last time, and it was overwhelming.  I will also cook it a little less; I did my slow cooker on high for 1 hour and then low for 6 hours, but I could have done and hour or two less.

Ok, I have made this recipe twice; once as written and second with my changes.  This is a great recipe.  I prefer my substitutions: frozen pineapple and agave nectar (sub for canned pineapple), chicken thighs (I personally prefer thighs), molasses (sub for brown sugar), fresh sliced ginger (plus ground ginger as per recipe) and a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  I also added sweet mini peppers and red onions to the slow cooker; both items caramelize in the delicious broth, plus add wonderful flavor to the chicken.  Try this recipe!  The original recipe as-is is a solid 4 star recipe, but my additions make it 5 star (IMO).  Bon appetit!

So excited to be the first to review this!  I loved how easy this recipe is.  The sauce was really good and the pineapple come out so yummy.  I used two large full bone-in chicken breasts to serve three of us.  The only thing I found is that the chicken was dry.  I would suspect my crockpot runs hot.  It didn't matter to me though, because of the lucious juice that I soaked my chicken in.  I did not thicken the sauce, but I suppose some might want to.  I served with a 5-grain rice blend and no leftovers.  Chicken was all gone.  Thanks nanny. Next time I will just be aware my slow cooker is a tad warm and cook less time.

I ended up cooking this on the stove top instead and used skinless boneless chicken thighs. I love the blend of sweetness coupled with a tinge of saltiness and the ginger was just right. Great tasting but easy dish indeed.

Made this tonight for dinner with a couple of minor changes. I added about half an onion cut into big chunks and 1/2 a red bell pepper cut into strips. I used 6 chicken breasts. I also cooked brown rice and when it was almost done stirred it into the crock pot about 2 hours before I was going to serve it. I always find that brown rice needs to cook a little longer than the directions state, but I didn't want it too mushy. Overall it was good, but next time I'll add more red bell pepper and a green bell pepper (I didn't have one in the house today and was too busy to run to the store). I'll also cut back on the Brown Sugar and/or honey. This was a little too sweet. I'll either add a little more soy sauce or some chicken broth. All in all it was very easy and a good meal.

Another delicious use for the slow cooker.  I started the crockpot before leaving for school, within one hour you could smell the mixture – yummy.  As soon as I got home my DH said “Wow, don’t know what you have in the crockpot, but the whole house smells wonderful”.  Nanny this dinner was a hit with all 4 of us.  I used two breast halves and two thigh quarters.  The dark meat was moister (as expected) than the white meat, although the white meat was still wonderful.  I served this over white rice and served ‘Ken Shoe Green Beans’ on the side.  I strained the juice to get out the little pieces of bone that came off the chicken while cooking, and we poured the juice over the chicken and rice.  This is a winner, nanny.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Good flavors, but could use some more spices.  I did add about twice the soy sauce because we use low sodium soy sauce.  I used boneless chicken thighs, which kept the meat moist.  Does not need to cook as long as the recipe says.  Next time I'll add some garlic & salt & pepper, and cook on the low setting for only 2-3 hrs.

Very good but it was just a little too sweet.  Next time I'll but half the amount of brown sugar.

I made this recipe today. I did read most of the reviews and added onions, bell peppers, garlic, and a little extra ginger. My husband does not care for chicken so I have to disguise it. I did brown my chicken first also. It is a great recipe with these changes. I served mine with mashed potatoes and some simple sautéed sugar snap peas. I did cooked it only 5 hours and I probably should have only cooked it 4 possibly 4 and 1/2.

Per another review I mixed the ingredients together before pouring over the chicken and it turned out really well!  I used boneless chicken breasts so I reduced the time of cooking, I didn't want themn to get dry. I'll add something to thicken up the sauce next time just so its not runny!  All in all we enjoyed the dish.  I will be making this again!

Saw this recipe and thought I would give it a try.  *My review is not for the recipe as written.* I had to make an extra meal so I used 7 pieces of chicken, a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks(in juice, not syrup), the 3tbs of honey, and 1/2 cup of Light brown sugar- didn't have dark.  We have a soy allergy so I didn't use soy.  I also used about a tablespoon or more of fresh minced ginger because I happen to have it on hand. Served with jasmin rice and broccoli.  Tastes good!  :)  Will make again.

i only gave it 4 stars because I altered the cooking method. I used a stovetop and cubed and dredged my chicken in addition to letting the sauce reduce and added cornstarch and apple cider vinegar for that extra kick. after that its 5 stars to me.

This is delicious! Instead of grinding the ginger, I left it whole and just took it out after it was done cooking. No overwhelming bites of ginger.

I made this last night and really liked it.  It could have been a bit more moist, so I'd recommend reducing the cooking time by an hour.  I do the Paleo diet (ie no added sugar) so I skipped the brown sugar and it still turned out sweet enough.  I would also recommend adding a 1/4 cup of stock with some flour or cornstarch to thicken up the sauce, but otherwise, it was fantastic.  Great little meal I will cook again!

I really think this recipe needs the slow cooker instead of the oven.  I used the oven and the wonderful flavor of the sauce just didn't have time to soak into the chicken. I ended up shredding the cooked chicken and then soaking it in the sauce which I thickened and then serving that over rice.  That worked out well.  Thanks nanny129 for sharing your recipe :)

A very good, basic slow cooker meal.  If you are using boneless, skinless breasts, watch your cooking time, particularly with newer slow cookers.  The combination of the BSCB and new, faster, hotter cooking slow cookers could lead to a dry dish.

This was really, really good and so easy to put together.  The only changes that I made were to decrease the brown sugar to two tablespoons, the ginger to 1 teaspoon and I added one cup of chicken broth. I cooked the chicken from frozen for four hours on high and it was perfect. Thanks so much for sharing Nanny and I will be making this one again.

Really good dish. Next time I would cut back on the sugar. I used boneless chicken breast. 4 hours on low. Turned out really well. I also added a little Asian sesame salad dressing, teriyaki marinade, Caribbean jerk marinade, and red pepper flakes. I also used a little flour to thicken the sauce. Will def be having this dish again.

This was super easy and is now my "don't know what to cook tonight" go to dish.  I use a larger can of pineapple so there is more juice to soak the rice in and I always use fresh ginger because its so much less expensive than ground ginger and gives a much stronger flavor.  I also cut back on the brown sugar and I have a real sweet tooth so recipe is probably too sweet for most people as written.  Basically, I now toss chicken, a large can of pineapple, lots of fresh ginger and some amount of the other stuff in the crock pot now and it comes out great.

I love being able to take the afternoon off!  We had a lot of yard work to do, so this recipe really came in handy.  The house smelled wonderful each time I came in.  It was a little sweet for our tastes so next time I would cut down on the sugar.  I loved the pineapples so I would increase them.  There's never too many pineapple chunks.  This is my preference.  Thank you Judy for sharing and the day off!!!

My family loved this!  I looked at past reviews and I mixed the ingredients first and then poured it on top of the chicken. I also cooked this on high for 1 hour and then on low for a total of 5 hours. After 4 hours on low, I shredded the chicken with 2 forks and then cooked it for the final hour. I served the chicken on Hawaiian rolls and it was delicious! Will definitely make it again!

For some reason, my chicken came out dry.  Maybe I left it in too long? There was plenty of juice in the pot (doubled the recipe for sauce). But flavor wise it was excellent!

I followed the recipe to the t ingredients wise. I couldn't find bone in chicken breast the first time I made it. So I used chicken thighs that are bone in. Now I'm making it again but I used a bigger can of pineapple cause personally I wanted more pineapple the first time. Using chicken thighs again with bone in. They stayed tender. The chicken thighs were so tender last time they fell off the bone. Its good with white rice.

Delicious!!! Can't wait to make this again. I used boneless chicken breasts, cut back on time in slow cooker as I felt chicken was a little dry. Will try baking in the oven next time. Marinated chicken for 30 min. in mixture of 3 tbsp. each of Caribbean jerk seasoning and canola oil plus 2 tbsp. of soy sauce (low sodium) and 1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar. I used fresh pineapple and added some pineapple juice. Didn't have ground ginger, but added 1/4 tsp. of red pepper seeds to give it some zip. Going to try chopped fresh red pepper next time. Served with jasmine rice and broccoli.

I used boneless chicken breast and omitted the minced garlic, cooked it on high for 2 1/2 - 3 hours tasted great! Maybe next time add a little salt.

Cooked this 1 hour less than recipe called for. Used chicken breasts and added frozen peas at the last 45 minutes  garlic salt and curry to taste. Put over basmati rice with cashews. Amazing!
Could also thicken sauce with cornstarch.

It was good but a little bland for our spicy tastes.  After we ate as written, I took the rest of the chicken out of the crockpot and added a slurry to make a sauce (6 tbs cornstarch, 6 tbs water).  It improved it a lot for the next meal.

Very good.  I used boneless breasts.  They need to cook less time or they will dry out.  Very tasty served over rice.

Lush midweek dinner! I spatchcocked a whole small chicken, added 2 cans of pineapple (only used one can of the juice), plenty of fresh ginger matchsticks and a few cloves of garlic. I let it marinade for a few hours in the fridge then cooked it in the oven, uncovered for about an hour (I don't have a slow cooker). Served with roasted broccoli with garlic and chilli and white rice.

I have made this for years now. We absolutely love it. The only thing I do differently is that I combine and whisk together all of the ingredients except for the chicken and pineapple chunks and pour the "sauce" over the chicken and pineapple chunks. It's great just as is or instead of the ground ginger, substitute Chinese 5 Spice.  Extra pineapple chunks is also a plus....

This turned out well and nothing was wrong, but it was very mild/almost bland. I shredded the chicken and added onion, garlic, bell pepper, and more pineapple in the last two hours of cooking. If I made it again, I'd want to add more spices and more pineapple as well. Again - good recipe, just not that exciting for our tastes.

This was just ok. I used fresh pineapple. The cook time was much too long and the chicken was a bit dry, but that was probably more due to the variance in slow cookers than the recipe itself.

I didn't add honey, used chicken breasts without bone, and put the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. The chicken by itself is very dry, so I shredded it, and mixed it with some of the liquid from the slow cooker along with some pineapple. This made a huge difference and turned what I thought was an okay dish to an awesome one.

Outstanding recipe. I made it as written the first time and it was delicious. The second time I added a large can of pineapple chunks and cut the sugar back to  1/3 cup. Either way it is an easy and scrumptious recipe.

Good foundation for Sweet N Sour Chicken. Frozen chicken breasts high for 2 hours then low for couple hours, do not overcook.  Added bell peppers to cooking. Did not use honey, used half brown sugar amount.

Did this by recipe with some additions, only thing I left out was the sugar. This is a good recipe, but I think needs stronger flavor, unless you're cooking for a family where some prefer milder flavors. I added peas (toward the end), Red bell pepper, fresh coin-cut carrots, and a bit of red pepper flakes. the pineapple is a great element,  but I didn't think was prominent enough, next time I'll double, and reduce the liquid at the end. Think garlic would help, too.
Could hardly taste the ginger, next time will use fresh grated, and plenty of it. I used 2.5 lbs thighs, I should say, were done in about 2.5 hrs on high. All that said, it seems a bit unfair to take off a star (plus I used the high setting, might have been different on low) this is supposed to be a quick, simple recipe, which it certainly is, and definitely not untasty, but if you have a couple more minutes, additions make a world of difference, and I suggest increasing the seasonings unless you really need a mild dish.

We used chicken thighs and baked it in the oven at 375 for just under an hour. It was really easy to prepare, using ingredients that we keep in the  house, and the result  was so good it was hard to keep to regular portions; we wanted more! Some might not want a recipe with the amount of sugar in this, but the calorie and the salt counts are low.. I need recipies which  are low in sodium, so it was a nice treat for me. We paired it with white rice. Delicious!

It was not bad, but a little bland - and this was after I added extra soy sauce and ginger towards the end too. I did leave out the brown sugar because I thought the pineapple and honey were enough sugar. It mostly just tasted like pineapple chicken. Nice and moist though. The chicken was done after 1 hour on high and then 3 more on low. I shredded and served it over rice. Next time I will try adding more seasonings.

Love the ingredients and ease of this recipe but the chicken was dry. Maybe it doesn't need to be cooked on high for an hour? I used two breast and two thighs, and we had to pick the small bones out.

We liked it and will make it again. Could use a little more uumph so we added onions and bell peppers. Could use more taste so will add more spices next go around.

It was okay. I followed advice to cut down on the sugar, which I'm glad  I did. I routinely use low sodium soy sauce, so saltiness wasn't a problem. It was pretty good, the family liked it but didn't love it.

I took advice and mixed sugar. Soy sauce etc together instead of adding each ingredient separately . Husband loved this and he is not a fan of crockpot meals.

I was a little disappointed w/ this recipe. Needed more seasoning; maybe more soy sauce, not sure. I may try again in the future. Cooking time was definitely less than posted in recipe but that could just be due to size, brand or temps of crock pot.

This is my first Slow Cooker recipe so it was a little over done.  I think our slow cooker cooks faster than what it calls for on the recipe so next time I cook using the slow cooker I'll try cooking for an hour less on Low and half an hour less on High.  Also, I'll stir the chicken from time to time  to make it cook more evenly.

Easy and delicous. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and a 19 0z tin of pineapple and juice, adjusted the spices to allow for extra liquid and thickened  the sauce with cornstarch at the finish... I will definitely make it again.

I used pork chops instead of chicken as it was what I had, two of my three boys liked it as did I; my husband didn't like the sauce either.  I browned the chops before I put them in the crock pot and let it cook on low for about 3 -4 hours. I think that was too long for the size of the pork chops. I enjoyed it. I did add a little chili powder to give it more flavor and fresh pineapple as I had it on hand.

Even my husband who is not a fruit with his meat kinda guy liked it. I added 1/2 teaspoon of Allspice and served it with brown rice/quinoa combo, the kind you heat up in a bag. Very quick and easy.

Like others said, I mixed the sauce first and taste to see if it's too sweet then I adjusted to my liking. I also added bell peppers and onion on top of pineapple. Chicken turned out very tender and everyone likes the dish. It's very easy to make and I add this to my list of recipes to rotate around...

Very good. Add red onion, bell pepper, sliced ginger. Double the soy sauce. Add 1/2 cup water to increase the sauce.  Pound the chicken to tenderize.

Made this the other day. Had two frozen chicken breasts so made half the sauce and mixed it all because it made more sense. The meat fell off the bone and it was delish. Served it with rice and asparagus. Next time more sauce for the rice.

Yum! Made this today and it's gorgeous - the wife loved it! 

The only slight tweaks I made were to add in a red onion and 4 cloves of smoked garlic. 

Definite winner and will be made again very soon!

After seeing the reviews I was so excited for this dinner... It was so bland and boring with a thin sauce... I fixed the liquid with corn starch, extra soy sauce, onion, and extra ginger. It was a better flavor after my fixing but chicken was over done and not a present texture. :(

Made mostly as written except I used chicken thighs, & chopped up a small piece of red onion & 2 cloves of garlic that I had to use up. I found this recipe to be very bland. I reduced the sauce & added cornstarch to thicken as it  was the consistency of water, & added some Sirracha to try to bump it up. I’m giving it 3 stars because it wasn’t bad, just bland. I won’t make this again without some major revamping.

Somewhat bland so I added green peppers and onion to the leftovers. Makes an enormous amount. I ended up shredding this because it fell off the bones. Would be good as a chicken barbecue sandwich.

It turned out alright but next time I won't use two teaspoons of ginger. Instead maybe just one.

Like another reviewer, I coupled it with brown rice, but with a chilled broccoli salad with soy vinaigrette.

Honestly, the chicken recipe was bland...needed either more sweetness, or punch with spices/chilis.

Super disappointed. Usually I can throw chicken in the crockpot, leave it on low up to 8 hours and come home to a delicious meal. This was overcooked and really flavorless, despite the pineapple, soy sauce, honey and ginger, all which should have provided lots of flavor. I ended up throwing it out :(

Hardly had any flavor.  Also mine was cooked in a third the time, so after 6 hours it was completely falling off the bone
