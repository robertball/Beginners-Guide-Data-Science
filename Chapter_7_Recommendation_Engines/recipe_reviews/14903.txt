This stuff was amazing! THE BEST! I made it as an appetizer for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and paired it with French bread for dipping. He loved it so much- I think I've won his heart through his stomach. I actually used hickory smoked gouda cheese that you can get in a little wheel at almost every grocery store and added a little ground pepper. I was thinking about using this for a scalloped potatoes recipe as well. THANKS for this recipe!

I was pretty disappointed with this dip. I made it with good brandy and good gouda cheese. It was pretty bland. The next day I added some cooked sausage to see if it would pep it up. Unfortunately it was still pretty blah.  I wouldn't recommend this dip.

Followed the recipe, just on the fence with it, although gouda is one of my favorite cheeses. From reading the reviews thought I'd make it for the big Super Bowl party.  With nearly 50 people attending, this recipe really didn't score a touch down.

This was really good!  I substituted a smoked gouda because strangely enough I couldn't find any regular gouda, and it was still gobbled down by everyone.  I will make this again with regular and report back on how people liked it.

I made this for a Christmas party and everyone loved it. About 4 people asked for the recipe.  I did use smoked gouda when i made it, dont know if it changes the taste any because this was the first time i had this dip, it was also the only gouda i found at the store that I was at.  Will make this again for sure!!!!
