Just made the roast for dinner tonight. Everything that the recipe said was so true. I remembered this recipe from a past girlfriend years and years ago. Her father used rock salt and it was the best prime rib I had ever eaten. The salt completely crusts over and does not make the roast the least bit salty. The mustard disipates and the meat is the juciest of any prime rib I have ever had!. If you like your prime rib juicy, you MUST try doing it with rock salt. You do need to follow the directions, and use plenty of salt. I used about 5 pounds worth. However, like I mentioned, it crusts on the top, bottom and sides. The top crust just lifted off and the bottom stayed in the foil. The salt on the sides just flaked off during the cooking process. This was by far the best recipe for prime rib I have ever tried. You won't be disappointed.

I made the mistake of not following the recipe exactly and did not use the full cup of mustard.  My salt did not form a true crust and was difficult to get off making the meat salty.  It was however very tender and juicy so I think the crust will work if you use the whole cup of mustard.

This make a beautiful, delicious roast, and the salt shell makes for a dramatic presentation if you chip it away at the table before carving.
I did it for Christmas 2001 and it immediatly became the dish we will be making for Christmas dinner from then on.

The horeseradish sauce adds zip and is good for those who don't like full strength horseradish

This was only my second attempt at Prime Rib.  This recipe is a keeper.  I couldn't find prepared hot mustard, so I used sweet hot mustard.  It was a little runny so the salt didn't stay on the sides very well.  I also altered the baking time, 1 hour at 450, then I turned down the temp to 350 till the core temp was 120.  After resting for a few minutes, the rost was a perfect medium rare.  So, our Christmas dinner prime rib was tender and flavorful.  Great recipe, thanks!

There are so many good reviews for this recipe, I had very high hopes.  However,  mine turned out very poorly.  The salt/mustard never formed any type of crust.  I actually had to hold my prime rib under the faucet to wash the salt off.  The meat tasted fine, but just as it would have if I had roasted it without doing anything special.  Doubtful I will try it.

I did this incorrectly (bigger roast without increasing the mustard), the crust didn't form and fall away as was intended.  So some servings had to have the salt carved away.  It was still delicious  and I will try it again.

Cooked buffet in a truck stop years ago when cooking was still really cooking instead of opening preportioned trays pf precooked, frozen entrees.  This was the way I cooked 4 primes every friday night.  People drove from miles around to eat this.  It is still the best way to cook Prime Rib although I've tried several other methods since then.

Where do you find the proper rick salt.  I ended up using course Kosher Salt.  The roast was good but I didn't get the results I thought I should get if I had been able to use Rock Salt.  The Kosher salt just wouldn't stay on.

Excellent...meat was juicy and flavorful. I didn't have rock salt but used coarse sea salt and it was delicious.

We followed the receipe to a t but, I think you might get the same results just by roasting it in the oven per directions without the salt. I am going to try it that way next time. It was a BIG hit!

hubby loved it- cooked perfectly and was very tender....crust formed on top but not bottom.....even when I took the crust off...I just felt myself retaining water!!! It was very salty.  I think it might be great with less salt and maybe some garlic though

Our family loved this!  I moistened the salt with red wine before sticking on.  The salt crust wacked right off and the end result was a fantastic crust.  Served with mashed potatoes and peas~yum!

A prime rib roast provided you didn't overcook it is generally a very juicy roast naturally.  This recipe was ok, but I did feel it was a waste of so much mustard, and rock salt.  The creamy horseradish sauce I wasn't fond of at all.  But thanks for giving me something new to try!

My husband and I had this for our low key New Year's Eve dinner. It was fantastic and we both agreed it was the best we've ever had! It was better than any prime rib I've ever had in a restaurant. I really liked the high heat method, as opposed to the low and slow recipes. I smeared some dijon mustard all over the roast before I pressed the salt onto it. I also ended up using kosher salt instead of the rock salt, but it didn't affect the flavor at all. Since we made it, we've been talking about this recipe to everyone we know.

My family loved the flavor of this roast although I found that it came out a bit dry (but perhaps I cooked a bit too long).  We usually have a pot roast that I cook on the top of the stove so this was a nice change.  My husband said that it tasted even better the next day and everyone lightly brushed the mustard/salt concoction over their meat although I found it a bit too salty for my taste.  Definitely a keeper for holidays.

Excellent, easy to do recipe for this old time favorite. I always wondered how they made such perfect prime rib at places like the Nugget in Reno. This is the closest I have gotten to that fine fare. Remember to add time for larger roasts. I used water softener coarse rock salt and it formed a perfect shell that kept all of the juicy goodness inside. The meat wasn't salty at all. I believe that the secret is in using coarse rock salt, nothing finer. For my 6lb roast with the bones in, 90 minute was the perfect amount of time. Be sure your oven is actually reaching 450 deg. Many aren't accurate at that temp. Measure with an accurate oven thermometer for perfect results.

Great taste, melts in your mouth. I have cooked prime rib before this way but without mustard.  I will now use the mustard.  Delicious indeed !
