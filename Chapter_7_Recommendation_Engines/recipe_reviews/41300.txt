Yummy! The first taste reminded me of my mom's scalloped potatoes, but this is much easier! I didn't have cream of celery soup, so substituted cream of chicken. And, my family isn't big on onions, so I sprinkled a couple tablespoons of dried minced onion over the potatoes instead of using the chopped onion. The leftovers were just as good today as the originals were last night!

These were "good." I didn't add any salt b/c the soup has enough in it already and reduced the cheese to about 6-8oz. Not bad by any means, but I think I should have used a different soup or perhaps the addition of some bread crumbs. Good enough that I would consider playing around with this again. Thanks.

Yum!  Really good comfort food.  I like the skins so I didn't peel the potatoes and I had to make some substitutions -- cream of mushroom soup instead of celery and mozarella cheese.  The leftovers were just as good the next day.  I will definately make these again.

This recipe far surpassed my expectations--in fact, I picked it because it had ingredients I had (except I substituted cream of chicken for celery).  I also reduced the cheese by half to cut down on fat and it didn't hurt the cheesy flavor one bit.  So creamy, with soft, melt-in-your-mouth baked potato sticks.  This one's a definite keeper!

This dish is so yummy!  I made it the other night with hamburgers.  Sort of like easy scalloped potatoes.  I didn't add onion (don't like it) and it still turned out great.

This was pretty good.  I seasoned the potatoes a little with a salt-free seasoning before I poured the sauce over them.

This ended up tasting a lot like scalloped potatoes.  I used mushroom soup instead of cream of celery because that's what I had, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I found it a little strange with the potatoes cut like French fries but with excellent flavor.  Will certainly make again but will probably slice the potatoes like scalloped.

We all enjoyed this, including the kids.  60 minutes was perhaps a bit too long to bake, as the top got a little crisp.

This recipe was okay.  It tasted like a good attempt to make something other than "funeral potatoes" but it was a little bland. The second time I made it, I doubled the batch, but sliced the potatoes (like chips), added 1/2 c cooked chopped bacon, replaced 1/2 the soup with cream of mushroom and the other 1/2 with sour cream, and added quite a bit of salt and pepper.  I topped it off with some sliced green onions.  It was much better that way, but I'm sure that's my personal taste buds speaking.
