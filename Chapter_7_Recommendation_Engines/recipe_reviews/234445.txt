A classic.  Quick and Easy are the key words here!  Perfect for a throw together quick appy.  It may not be 'fancy' but there is never any left.

This is way better if you add shredded cheddar cheese to the mix and top with green onions. This recipe is kind of bland..needs some jazzing up.

I add shredded cheese to mine and serve with tortilla chips.
