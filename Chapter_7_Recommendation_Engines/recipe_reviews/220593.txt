I have made this dish a couple of times already. I use all the same ingredients, but I don't follow the directions exactly, because I thought it was a bit complicated with too many bowls, extra time for marinading and an oven. Instead I threw the mushrooms and onion (I use fresh onion) into a deep skillet with the marinade sauce. I sauteed that until it is soft, about 5 minutes, then I add the sour cream sauce and toss for 1-2 minutes like it says. Then I toss in pasta. So much easier like this and it tastes great. I can't say how it compares to the original recipe, but I like the way mine turned out and it is a lot easier for me. The only ingredient I omitted is the wine because I don't have it. My hubby also really likes this and compliments it everytime I make it.

WOW - this was really very good!  I made it for a meat-loving dad and brother and they went back not just for seconds, but until it was all gone!  I'll admit, I did cheat a little and not make it vegan, I added a little cream cheese to finish it off.  I also sauteed some onions in butter.  I know, I know, not the exact recipe, but OH so GOOD!  This is going to be a regular recipe for me and I will do it vegan.  Btw - also  did some Shitake mushrooms with it and as others suggested, added the marinade into the cream sauce (yes, all of it).  Absolutely delicious!

This was a pretty good recipe. If I make it again, I will omit the dried minced onion and use fresh instead. The texture and taste was off putting. Also, I would decrease the wine a bit. I think I would change the way I prepared the dish. Start out with the oil, fresh onion, and mushrooms. cook until softened and lightly browned. Then, add the garlic and wine. Reduce. Next add the rest of the ingredients, and cook until thickened. Much easier and takes less time.

My vegan son loved this!  I added about 3 tablespoons of the liquid from the mushrooms into the sauce and it made a huge difference.

This is/was a delicious Sunday Dinner today. I used what ingredients were available at my home, so substitutions were made.

Instead of 8 ounces vegan sour cream, I used 3/4 container of Daiya Plain Cream Cheese Style Spread.

Instead of 2 teaspoons vegan no-beef bouillon, I used 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.

Instead of 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, I used 1 tablespoon cider vinegar.

I used the preparation method that hw3023 suggested in which that I threw the mushrooms and onion into a deep skillet with the marinade sauce. I sauteed that until it is soft, about 5 minutes, then I add the sour cream sauce and toss for 1-2 minutes like it says. Then I toss in pasta. 

This is an easy, delicious comforting dinner.

My husband suggested that we should have this recipe once a week---and he is not even a vegetarian, much less a vegan.  I loved it, too.  I have to confess that I used regular dairy sour cream because I had some on hand, so our version was vegetarian but not vegan.  
         I would like to see the recipe adjusted to actually serve four people.  The two of us ate every bite, and we are not big eaters.  Honestly, if I had tried to serve this to four people, it would not have been enough.  I suggest using four portobello mushrooms and increasing the sauce and the marinade by 50%.  Whatever--it's great!

Very good! Definitely fulfilled the creamy, meaty pasta craving! Next time I will perhaps not add "all" of the marinade to the cream sauce. And I will follow the other reviewer's recommendation to add the fresh, minced onions to the marinade or saute first. Overall excellent!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic ! On a scale of 1-10 my husband gives it a 10. My husband and I both agreed we could eat this every day! 
I do some modifications because I am gluten sensitive and also need low sodium. 
I use gluten free fusilli pasta, instead of flour I use 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, instead of soy sauce I use coconut aminos. I also double the olive oil and balsamic vinegar when cooking the mushrooms because I don't add wine. I use 1/2 of a not-beef natural bouillon cube in the vegan sour cream again to keep sodium down. I also add 1/2 tablespoon of basil for flavor. I use white pepper instead of black pepper ,( personal preference). Instead of store bought vegan sour cream I use the recipe online called "the best  vegan sour cream" from glutenfreeveganpantry.com . I copied the recipe and pasted it below. It works fantastic in this recipe and no need to buy vegan sour cream . I omit the salt out of this recipe to keep the sodium down , again personal preference. 

The best  Vegan Sour Cream 

1 cup cashews soaked over night 
¼ cup + 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
¼ tsp sea salt
1 tsp nutritional yeast
½ cup water

INSTRUCTIONS
Place all ingredients into your blender (I used my Vitamix)
Blend on high for 5-7 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed, until very smooth and creamy.
Transfer to a mason jar or other airtight container.

NOTES
The best  vegan sour cream can be stored in your fridge for 1-2 weeks.

Loved it so much, I made it twice in two weeks with the following changes:
1) I accidentally bought vegan cream cheese (8 oz.) instead of sour cream the first time; made correction the second time and preferred the cream cheese variation (*to blend cream sauce, I mixed the cream cheese and the other necessary ingredients in my food processor, since cream cheese is pretty stiff stuff),
2) I doubled the mushrooms (using sliced cremini) and used fresh onion instead of the dried onion, which I marinated together in a ziplock bag while I prepared the cream sauce and heated the pasta water and cast iron pot for the mushrooms,
3) Like other reviewers, I decided to saute the mushrooms and onions together on the stove top; since the mushrooms release so much liquid, I drained off the excess marinade after about 5 minutes, reserving it to add back in with the cream sauce,
4) I cut the salt (soy sauce?) by half.

I can imagine that going through the process of making mushroom strips from portobellos and baking them recreates the meaty aspect of beef stroganoff, but the quick method is a delicious alternative.

I forgot the flour but it was still AMAZING. My meat loving family said it was hit! A definite repeat. I highly recommend this dish over tri-colored quinoa.

Really tasty and very easy! We had all the ingredients in our non-vegan home aside from Vegan Sour Cream and No-Beef Bouillon. Will definitely make it again!

This recipe was very tasty. Although I really didn't like the dried onions in it (and I only used half of what was asked). I will definitely try it again using cooked chopped onions. I added a few tablespoons of the marinade to the mixture (as other reviewers mentioned), but I found it way too salty (this wasn't in the original recipe though)... next time I'll try it with 1 tablespoon max!

Followed the recipe, except I put all the marinade in the pan after chopping up the mushrooms.  Added sour cream mixture to it.  Serve with BIG red wine.

Rich, delicious recipe. I used regular, low-fat sour cream because I didn’t have time to find vegan sour cream.  I also used real beef bouillon because I had it on hand. This is quick, easy, and hardy.

After reading the reviews, I only used 1/3 cup of wine (instead of 1/2) and 1/2 cup fresh chopped onion (instead of 3 tablespoons dried). I also mistakenly bought vegan cream cheese instead of sour cream -- a mistake that was terrific. The flavor of the marinaded portobello's really was like flavorful meat -- fantastic. Husband has already requested it again, even after bringing leftovers for lunch.

I made a few changes so that this would be oil free. I used veggie stock instead of olive oil and as other reviewers suggested I used fresh onion. I made my own vegan sour cream using tofu. I really didn't get to eat much of this because my husband loved it. I am making it again today using a different vegan sour cream recipe that uses cashew instead of tofu. My husband's comment was this is good enough to serve to anybody

Threw it out. Disgusting. The sauce lacked depth. It was like just plain white sauce even though it had soy sauce, etc. in it.

This took as long (if not longer) than mentioned in the recipe, but it was indeed worth the wait! Thick, rich and as creamy as I can remember before going dairy-free. Instead of adding water to the thickened sauce, I added the marinade from the baking dish that the mushrooms were baked in. Yum!

I put a little more wine - and marinated it just in that.  It was super tasty as is.  Next time I would use garlic powder instead of minced because the texture of the minced garlic was weird to me.  But flavor wise it was great.

great recipe. I sauteed onion,  garlic,  mushrooms on the stove ( left out the oven part.)  then added the marinade concoction.  then added the sour cream concoction.  the vegan sour cream is not my favorite thing...  but the recipe still turned out good.

Definitely saved the some of the marinating fluid to add to the sauce. Made this 3 times now, as per the recipe and then with real dairy. My partner has Chron's and normally uses goat dairy, so we opted for fresh goat cheese and soy cream since we couldn't get the vegan sour cream that day. This is now a favorite, thanks for the share.

The nearest place I could find the no-beef bouillon cubes was about 20 miles from my town, so I substituted with some vegetable bouillon cubes.  Delicious.

Made this for my family of mostly meat lovers and they’re all as crazy for it as I am! The mushrooms are absolutely delightful and perfectly compliments the sauce. This is definitely going to become a regular dinner.

Everyone enjoyed the meal, although my personal expectations were a bit higher.  Yes, give it a try!  Only tip, eat on time, the kids arrived 30 minutes late and the meal of course tends to thicken with time.

I am a meat person so when I made this for my vegan husband I made another entree for me. Turns out I didn’t need my dish. This Stroganoff recipe was excellent!

This is a recipe to get an idea, but the method is madness!  it's like this recipe is written by someone that knows nothing about cooking and wants to do things the long and hard way!  Just a couple notes, first, you don't need to soak the mushrooms in the stuff and bake, then chop and cook again, just chop them up, mix the stuff and saute, so much faster and works better ( i did it both ways).  Also, don't get rid of the gills, why would you?  they don't taste bad and they add a nice darker color.   Second, use fresh onion.  Finally, add just a little fresh nutmeg, it is very much needed.  Most Stroganoff recipes have it, it adds depth to the flavor....a little parsley helps too.

Great recipe.  I agree with other reviews that you don’t need to bake the portobello first just cook it in the pot when done add sour cream and then noodles.  I often add spinach with mushrooms to sneak extra greens in for the kids.

This recipe is delicious and rich! I’ve tried a few vegan stroganoff recipes that fell really flat, I had given up on stroganoff but came across this and thought I’d give it a shot—so glad that I did! It’s become and instant favorite at my house.

This was very good... per most helpful hint I did not marinade the mushrooms I cooked it in a pan with the fresh onions  once soft I added other ingredients leaving the flour to be added last in the pan.

I put off making this because I thought the pictures looked unappetizing, but my boyfriend really wanted to try it. I'm so glad we did! Like a lot of other people, I skipped over all the crazy steps with the mushroom. I added 1/2 chopped onion into a baggie with the mushroom and red wine marinade and let it sit for an hour. I then cooked them for about ten minutes (left it on low and covered for about five minutes of the ten). I also used vegan cream cheese instead of sour cream and added that to the mushrooms WITH the red wine marinade. SO GOOD. Next time I plan on using more mushroom!

I made the recipe just as described and it was great! Next time I’m adding a second package of mushroom, 8 in all. Otherwise it will be made the exact same way again. A hit with the family!

As with another reviewer, I simplified the recipe by cutting out the marinating and roasting process of the portobello's by cutting them up in small pieces and sautéing them with fresh onion, then adding the wine mixture to continue cooking. I also used fresh garlic;   real organic sour cream; broth rather than water and bouillon; oat flour for thickening worked great for gluten free. It was delicious, and my mother, who loves meat, loved it!

This recipe was very good.  Only thing is, it's pictured served on pasta but no mention of it in the recipe at all.  I can't see how you would eat this without it.  This seems to happen a lot on Allrecipies - missing ingredients.  I served it with spiral pasta.
Very flavorful!

I added spinach but I have to say the tofu sour cream with the seasoning makes for a great dip so I'm definitely saving the first part of the instructions for a chip or veggie dip! Overall the whole recipe was really tasty thank you so much!

Okay, this is simply excellent.  Followed this recipe exactly and will be making it again and again.  Portobello mushrooms are usually a bit on the pricey side but I'm not even thinking of substitutes as that is never really reliable given the truly unique flavor.

It takes some quality prep and cooking time, but this dish is AMAZING! I fell in love with the flavour on the first bite.

This is sooooo good!!! Only changed a few things - lots of fresh basil, some fresh parsley, lots of fresh garlic, added some liquid smoke, added super extra firm tofu, and served it with some chipotle powder and the McCormick Bac'n Pieces.

Add a little more water!  Besides that, my wife loved it.  Also, for the wine go for a nice Zinfandel.  Definitely a 5 from my audience :)

a little complicated. I think I will just saute the mushrooms (no baking) next time. Really yummy!

This was a good pasta for being vegan. I will make this again, but maybe with more mushrooms.

Wow. Great recipe. I followed it exactly except switched the vegan not-beef bouillon to regular vegetable bouillon because that's what I had in the kitchen. Everyone loved this recipe!!

This recipe is so tasty. We did not care for the onions in the recipe, so next time we will leave those out.  Otherwise, we will for sure be making this again!!

This is a great recipe! Did as the other reviews said and added in some of the marinate. We will make this again soon.
