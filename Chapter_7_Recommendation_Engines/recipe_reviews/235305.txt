I did try this recipe as written and while the flavor was very good, it turned into a giant lump of very firm sticky chewy caramel--not brittle at all. I looked up other peanut brittle recipes and found what I think is an error in this one.  This needs to be heated to 300 degrees rather than 250 degrees.  I also upped the amount of baking soda to 1 1/4 teaspoons to make it a bit lighter.  I made this recipe again with my changes and it turned out great!!! Bacon makes everything better!!!!

Delicious! Make sure your bacon is crispy and all soft fatty parts are discarded. I broke mine into small pieces and added at the very end so  the bacon would not have time to soften.

This recipe was delicious. I found it slightly difficult, but it was also my first time making any type of brittle.
