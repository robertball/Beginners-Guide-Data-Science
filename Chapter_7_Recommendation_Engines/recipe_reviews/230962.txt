Love this recipe!  We've made it several times.

Things I've ended up doing different:
-Add chicken after a few hours - we feel it gets to dry when it's in from the beginning.
-Use shrimp instead of ham - which we don't add until the last hour or 2 of cooking.
-Add 1.5c white rice at the last hour or two - this is scary to do, but if you give it enough time, eventually the rice cooks perfect and absorbs the extra liquid.
-No file powder - what is that anyway??

Great recipe for slow cooker! Didn't use file powder, but turned up to high last 30 minutes and added rice to entire mix.  Can use instant rice or long grain, but might take longer with long grain. Good for all of our family as we have shrimp haters among us!  Boo! Doubled recipe easily and froze half for another night! Thanks!

This was a fun recipe to try for Fat Tuesday!  This makes a lot of jambalaya, for sure.  I used the published amounts of chicken and sausage, but halved the ham and added about 6 oz shrimp at the end of cooking.  I used the spices exactly as published including the file powder, delicious, I would call this a medium spicy hot finished.  You may want to half or omit the cayanne if you don't like spicy, but it was perfect for us.  This is a breeze to put together and great for weeknights.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

Love this. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I shredded the chicken instead & I also crumbled the sausage instead of cutting into slices. I didn't use ham. I also used dice tomatoes w/ green chiles. I then put it all in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. About an hour before I was ready to eat I made 1.5 cups of white rice & added that to the crock pot, then left that in there on warm for another hour. The only thing I would change is the cayenne pepper. My tongue LOVES spicy, but my stomach hates it. I would only put 1/2 TSP next time, 1 TSP really gives it a kick. I also didn't use file powder. It was freaking delicious though. Especially adding the rice & letting that soak all the flavors for an hour. Yum.

Seriously good jambalaya!!! But okay, I did make a few changes just to suit our tastes. I skipped the cayenne and the cajun seasoning and just threw in 1 1/2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning. I also omitted the thyme and file powder and threw in basil instead. At the end, I stirred in 1 1/4 cup of brown rice and some shrimp (in place of the ham). Oh so very, very good!!!

Excellent. Threw in a small can of low sodium V8 cause I wanted to get rid of it. Also tossed in 2 , 14 oz. Cans of tomato, okra & corn cause that's what was handy. The best jambalaya ever.

so easy to make and flavorful.  Followed recipe except used a red bell pepper instead of green and it turned out amazing.  very spicy just the way we like it.  would recommend cutting back on spice for anyone that can't handle hotness.  thanks for sharing will do again!

This has a wonderful array of flavors.  I wouldn't add the sausage and chicken until the last 2 hours, because it will dry out the meat if you add as stated.  We substituted fresh shrimp in place of the ham, added the last 30 minutes of cook time.  I added rice the last hour and half and in order to get it to actually cook I had to add a cup or 2 of chicken broth and then the rice became mushy but it was still worth it.  I would recommend making this without the rice and just serve it over cooked rice.  We really enjoyed this.  I will make it again.  Not really spicy for our taste though next time we will up the Cajun spices. Thanks!

This recipe is great!  My first time to ever make jambalaya (I'm on a cajun kick lately--recently made etouffe from a recipe found here).  The only changes I made was:   used crushed tomatoes instead of diced and diced green chilis instead of bell pepper.  I mixed everything together in the crock pot the night before and the meat marinated in the tomatoes and season all night and it was magic.  So good!!  I'm having more for lunch today.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is deeeelicious. The andouille really makes it amazing. I used dark meat chicken instead of breasts. The chicken really should go in about halfway through so it is still tender and flavorful. I didn't have file powder and I didn't want to spend $11 to buy a tiny jar of Sassafras salt so I just left it out. I also didn't have any thyme. I added some ground coriander. I cooked some rice in a pot and served it under the jambalaya. I don't like mixing rice with anything soupy because it doesn't save as well. This recipe is wonderful.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I omitted the ham and used shrimp, rice and okra as other suggested. I reduced the Cayenne Pepper to 1/4 tsp.  We aren't into anything too spicy.  This was perfect, it made lots and froze some for another day. Didn't use file powder.  File powder is ground sassafras leaves used as a thickener.  Will definitely make this again.

This was easy to prepare the night before and throw in the crock pot in the morning.  It certainly packs a spicy punch!  It was great served over rice.  Lots for leftovers, too.

Pretty much followed the directions, didn't have the celery till later but it still turned out great. I added about half can of tomato paste and a little sugar. It was a little too spicy for my kids but overall taste was great and especially coming from a slow cooker recipe. I threw in frozen bell peppers stir fry veggies and also frozen chicken breasts. I cut the chicken up after cooked and I also used canned Rotel tomatoes which spiced it up a little more. Overall one of the best slow cooker recipes ever for me.

This was AWESOME!!! I made this for a potluck get together; I started it at home and then we got to our destination I turned the slow cooker back on high and waited about an hour and then added rice and shrimp.  It was a hit with everyone!!!

For the sausage I used hot Italian sausage, took it out of the casing and browned it at high heat in a skillet before adding to the crock pot. I drained most of the grease and browned the chicken (dashed some garlic, black pepper on the chicken) in the same skillet. Didn't cook either for long, just browned the edges. At the 5 hour mark I turned the crock pot up to high, added one 12 oz. package of quinoa (instead of rice) and a pound of pre-cooked shrimp cut up into small pieces. Quinoa soaks up most of the liquid in about 45 minutes, at which point I served it up. Went easy on the cayenne but nearly doubled the cajun spices as well. Got great reviews from the crowd!

Great spice flavor to this dish.  Fast, easy, and great for leftovers since I make the whole batch just for my boyfriend!  He searched until he found file powder at a local grocer.  Served over brown or white rice this recipe is great.  Highly recommend.

9-12-17  ~Because I have been strictly limiting carbs I did not serve this over rice (even tho’ it would have been better with it!).  I added more tomatoes and chicken broth to make this more a “jambalaya soup.”  It was delicious and satisfying, however, unfortunately the chicken was a tad dry – I’d add it further along into the cooking process were I to make this again.  I do not care for overly “hot” foods – unless it’s over the top, heat generally doesn’t bother me, but I believe too much heat masks flavors rather than enhance them.  Therefore, I reduced the cayenne by half and it still had a little too much “flavor masking kick” for my taste.  Given that the Cajun seasoning has its own heat, next time I may just omit the cayenne altogether.

Nope...Pass on this very  poor second cousin of jambalaya. Lacks flavor and texture needs a lot of work/additions/changes to be called Jambalaya. Semi spicy  ham soup is a better description.

Made this three times now and each time it was awesome. We like shrimp so I add some the last 30 mins and rice to the crock pot it is addictive and yummy. The flavor and spices are great.  It has become a family favorite.  Thanks for sharing.

Yum, Yum, Yum!!! Followed all the important stuff exactly as written! Took an-others advice and waited a few hours before adding the chicken so it didn't dry out as much. Used precooked-shrimp instead of ham(personal preference)and added it the last half hour on high along with 2 cups instant rice(my hubby and I both love rice), may try raw shrimp next time since it cooks so quickly. Not sure exactly what file powder is/does, but found it and used it. Would not change any of the flavoring or heat in this recipe, it was perfect as written! Thanks for the recipe! Can't wait till Fat Tuesday!!

Jambalaya is a dish whose main component is rice. I do not see any rice in the recipe or photo. What's in the photo looks like a soup. Could the creator of this recipe have confused Jambalaya with Gumbo, which is soup like except that it is made with a thicker gravy, or more specifically, a roux? Gumbo also has rice in it so, I am a little confused by this recipe.

I haven't tried it, but I'm from New Orleans, and that looks more like gumbo than Jambalaya, which is a rice based dish.

Although this recipe sounds delicious, it is not jambalaya!  Jambalaya is a rice dish...where the rice is cooked in all these other ingredients.

I don't  know what this is, but it isn't  jambalaya.   Ask any native of Louisiana and they will say this is stew or soup, but nit jambalaya.

I substituted the Black Forest ham with shrimp and added a little chili sauce for an extra kick and it is delicious. Great for making to take for meals at work during the week. Very flavorful.

I followed this recipe with all the ingredients except: I used fresh shrimp (adding the last 30 minutes) instead of ham, and I used Old Bay Seasoning in places of the file. WOW!!! Perfect heat with the andouille and cayenne pepper! Served over rice (or without), it's just delicious!

This was fantastic!     I added cooked shrimp the last hour And did not use ham.   
I stirred in brown rice the last hour which  absorbed the excess liquid.  
I didn't have file powder either.  
I used two cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes.  
I did everything else as directed in recipe.  
The jambalaya turned  out very yummy.  Husband and I liked the spice.  Just right for us.  This is a keeper.

So so good!!! I make two batches of this at our family cabin trip up north for a crowd. One with the cayenne and one without. People look forward to it! I make it as is and add shrimp at the end.

I omitted the parsley, file powder and ham. I also added double the cayenne pepper accidentally but it was still delicious! We love spicy so this was perfect. I would definitely make again. Oh and I served it with brown rice.

I used red kidney beans instead of the ham that I added in the last hour, drained. I also added two cups of rice in the last hour making it less runny and more hearty.  This was a big hit!

Very good overall - bf actually requested me to make it again.  I used some Italian seasoned chicken breasts from Perdue, it made the dish a little salty despite using low sodium chicken broth and no salt added tomatoes. I did brown the onions celery and bell peppers before adding to the pot. Since it was a little soupy at the end of cooking, I added about 1 1/2 cups of Minute Rice and that soaked most of it up. I froze the leftovers and we'll see how it does.

Couldn't find the file powder in my local grocery so left it out. I did what another reviewer said and added Minute rice with 30 min. left and turned it to high. I will cut back the cayenne pepper next time, as it was a little too spicy for me personally, but just right for my husband. It was really good and I will definitely make it again!!

Without a doubt the best jambalaya I have ever had, home or restaurant!  I accidentally put double the green pepper I was supposed to and loved it that way. Cut the recipe down to just four serving for our small family and it was still perfect.

We love shrimp, so we switched it for the ham. I threw small cooked shrimp in the crockpot for the last 30 minutes. Couldn't find file powder, so I omitted it. Served over brown rice. Very good!

I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I used ground sweet Italian sausage instead of the chicken, I used a full 14.5 ounce can of chicken broth, I did not have nor could I find  file powder so didn't use that, and I cut the Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper seasoning in half. Still had a bit of a bite but my son still really liked it.  Everyone enjoyed it, there were no leftovers. I will definitely make it again.

I've made several different recipes...this is one of the easiest.  Didn't have ham so increased the chicken and smoked sausage.  We really don't use peppers because of dietary issues so the holy trinity is less one ingredient and still extremely flavorful.  I used a seasoning I brought back home from NOLA called "Joes Stuff" in place of Cajun seasoning.   I substituted yellow rice and the very first servings topped with the Jambalaya is fantastic!

My children love this recipe. My oldest often requests it. I forgo the cayenne powder for them but other than that it is exactly as it says. It has been a favorite in our family for a couple of years now. The chicken seems to dry out easily in the crockpot though so sometimes i'll make it separately and just throw it in when serving. and always with rice.

This really was very good as written.  Of course, I didn't have Andouille Sausage so I had to use a Kielbasa and I used a ham steak from the meat section but it was very good and very easy.  Good flavor.  We put it over "Bow Tie" Pasta for a little change.  I will make it again - next time with the Andouille.

An absolute favourite!  I use shrimp instead of ham, red pepper instead of green pepper, and I leave out the celery and the file powder.  About an hour before it's finished cooking, I syphon off most of the liquid and use the liquid to cook a pot full of brown rice separately on the stove.  This ensures the flavour of the jambalaya cooks right into the rice.   and you can make sure the rice cooks properly.  Once the rice has finished cooking, I mix the it back into the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients and serve.   I get requests for this dish constantly from friends and family.

Delicious. Followed the recipe exactly except for the ham. Bought a 14 oz. bag of small frozen shrimp cooked, peeled, deveined, and tails removed and put that in instead. Cooked for 7 hours and was ready. Will definitely make again.

Very good and spicy without being too hot. Followed the recipe, left out the file. Served with corn bread. I think this is more like eight servings. Will definitely make again.

I made this for the wife and me. I glad she got the chance to eat it. The only sample I had was "the chef's privilege" while I was cooking it. I'm glad I purchased twice the recipe. She loved it.

It was excellent. You added a pound of shrimp and used only 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper.

This is a great recipe that has a lot of  Cajun kick!  We did cook the shrimp separately in Old Bay and then added to the crock pot for the last 15 minutes.  I think next time we will also add okra .  My husband was very insistent that I save this recipe !

Easy! I did not use the file powder, as I read the reviews and didn't have it so I omitted it. My family loved it and so did I! Super for a working person to put in crockpot and come home to a house smelling good and food ready to eat. I served it with rice to my daughter and cornbread to my hubby. I will be making this again.

I left out the red pepper as I don't like HOT and it was tasty. I used the shrimp instead of ham as I had some from the coast that I had frozen.   Next time I will add thenshrimp nearer the end of cooking. Shrimp should not be over cooked. I did four hours on high.

A very simple recipe with room for experimentation.  I added a pound of shrimp.  I also doubled the chicken broth in anticipation of adding rice for the final 2 hours.  The result was a big hit.  The recipe makes plenty for dinner and leftovers.

Very good rexipe. Substituted venison jalapeño cheese sausage for andouille sausage and used shrimp instead of ham. Browned suasage and chicken before adding to slow cooker. Added shrimp to slow cooker one hour before complete. Results were delicious.

Easy recipe. Coupled it with Zatarain's Cilantro Lime Rice, and added additional chopped cilantro and fresh lime juice. And a few Old Fashioned cocktails. Even better the next day.

Humm, Humm, Good. I followed the directions with only two exceptions: I used shrimp instead of ham and I put white rice in the Jambalaya. 

Like my Southern brothers and sisters have stated, a true Jambalaya has rice in it. The rice uses the excess juices of the Jambalaya to cook to make it so perfect. I also had a serving of fresh, hot cornbread to go along with it. "Can't be beat."

The only problem I had in making this is that my wife had ate the shrimp the night before and I had to go to the store to get some more. I hate having to devain shrimp after I had already did so the night before. 

I cooked the Jambalaya on high in the crock pot for 7 hours. After supper, I split half of the Jambalaya for the refrigerator and half for the freezer. Now I can eat something that I like when the mood hits me instead of roughing it on my wife's various diets fads that she seems to go through every other month. Hahaha

If you don't like it too hot, (Spicy), then cut back on the cayenne pepper.

I used Boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast's, Had some frozen honey ham chunks that went in along with the Andouille , half way through I added a handful of frozen sliced Okra, Followed the the spices and amounts according to the recipe. Added a pound of frozen shrimp thawed about 20 minutes before turning it off. Served over brown rice. Tasty and just the right amount of bite. My slow cooker seems to cook on low a lot faster then many of the cooking times recommended in many slow cooker recipes and knowing this I checked at 6 hours and it was done ! I am not so sure that this should be called Jambalaya without the rice in it  it's more like a Gumbo

I am on a low carb diet and this jambalaya fits the bill! I would have preferred it with rice but because of the carbs, it could not be done. We did add shrimp. This was an easy recipe and it turns out very well. We plan on keeping this recipe even when I come off the low carb diet.

I have made this dish several times last year and this year. Most of my coworkers love this dish also. I make it the exact same way the recipe says I might add extra Cajun seasoning and Cayenne seasoning,  because I like it spicy. I usually put all the ingredients in the slow cooker before I go to bed that night or before I leave for work that morning. That way it's done when I get home.

Followed the directions exactly, and it turned out PERFECT.  So good.

One tip--don't make the chicken chunks too big.  The bigger ones will taste dried out.  But even still, really really good.

I've made this several times and this recipe is excellent as is (except I've never added file powder - don't have that).  For personal preference I swap out either the ham or the chicken for 1lb - 1.5lbs of (uncooked but peeled & deveined) large shrimp thrown in for the last few minutes.   I season the shrimp with cumin before adding but this dish is so tasty you don't even have to do that!  Warning though: My family, including the kids, LOVE spicy.  If you don't, you can just dial down the cayenne to suit your spice level.  I serve this over Zataran's Jambalya rice.  I've also used plain brown rice in a healthier version/twist on this.  It is all good because this recipe is packed with delicious flavors!  Thanks so much for sharing this!!!

Love this recipe, the only thing I changed was I used ham off the bone and I also suggest not adding rice to it like many suggested, the flavor and spices really comes through nicely, was a huge hit at company potluck, definitely making it again.

I've made this several times and it's always a hit with the wife. It's spicy, but not too spicy. The only thing I change with the recipe is adding 1 lb of frozen, cooked shrimp in the last 30 minutes of cooking. Gotta get more animals in there!

Not a fan of the ham. Will make it with shrimp from now on. Other than the ham I would change nothing as it is wonderful.

Made this yesterday for family movie night.  It was a huge hit...there were 6 of us, 4 adults and two 11 year old boys.  The recipe makes 12 servings but it was such a success I only had one serving left.  Served it over rice (cooked separately) with corn bread on the side and rainbow and orange sherbets for dessert.  Changes: I used skinless boneless thighs, cut the cayenne down to 1/8th tsp. (Husband is a spice wimp...will build up slowly...) also cut the Cajun spice in half because it seemed soooo salty.  I did use filé powder (will use again & again for sure) Also used shrimp instead of ham. The guests came late, while the crock pot was on warm, so we waited till they came & used some of the sauce from the pot to cook the shrimp separately then added to the jambalaya.  Love this recipe!  Thanks sooooo much!

Delicious, easy to make. I made white rice separately and added it afterwards.

I absolutely loved it. Same with my husband and the kiddos! I didn't add file powder and instead of ham I used shrimp with no tails.  I also added rice to the mix in last 2 hours.  Turned out perfect. I will definitely  make it again! And again!

Love this recipe I usually make a double batch and use ham, kielbasa and chicken. I add 1 and a half to 2 cups of rice also. It's great for bringing to work or enjoying for dinners. So easy!

Meaty Slow Cooker Jambalaya Haiku: "Should be served with rice, otherwise it's 'Cajun Soup', taste was still spot-on." My husband and I really liked this - I made it as directed only lopping it in half for just us (and some leftovers), although I'm pretty sure the zippy pouch of John Morel-brand ham cubes aren't Black Forest, but that's all that I had to use. Oh and skipped the optional file powder, b/c from what I'm told by more wiser and elder Southern gal relatives, it turns all stringy if simmered, and is meant to be sprinkled at the table. So yeah, this tasted really good, but it was very liquid-ey, so I wish I'd have prepared either rice, or had a nice baguette, to absorb some of that flavor juice.

Awesome recipe! I followed the instructions and cooked rice separately and added at the end!  Turned out amazing!  I didn't add the file seasoning but all else was the same. Well actually I used diced tomatoes with green chili's and omitted the cayenne... but super awesome!  Will make again!

Wow!  This is without a doubt the best recipe I have ever gotten from the Internet.  The only change I made was to add 1 1/2 cup of white rice in the last hour.  The rice really soaks up the broth, so I added about 2 cups of water after it thickened from adding the rice.  Love, Love, Love it!

This is very close to my recipe. I use Hot Links instead of the andouille and fire roasted tomatoes. Then at the last hour I add rice. So fast and very good.

Turned out well, but will use 1/2 of the cayenne pepper called for in the recipe next time.

This recipe makes a lot of food! Especially since I added 3 cups of instant rice towards the end of cooking because there was a lot of excess liquid. I also added my chicken about half way through the cooking process. Yummy!!

This is my go to cold weather dish.  It is absolutely delicious,  and my whole family eats it up!  I do use the traditional shrimp instead of ham.

I followed the recipe fairly closely. A few changes including adding extra sausage in place of the shrimp, used a red bell pepper instead of a green, no filing powder and cut the cayenne pepper by half. I added the chicken and 1.5 cups of long grain brown rice at the last 2 hours and turned heat up to high. Everything turned out fantastic! Had a ton of leftovers for the week! One question though, the rice was still very moist by the end and I am unsure as to why for I am still learning the trades of cooking! Anyone have any advice as to why the rice was so moist? Over cooked perhaps? Thanks! Great recipe and I can't wait to make it again!

Wonderful substitute for my mothers chicken and sausage gumbo. She's not with us anymore but I know she would've loved it. And it's so easy to make.  Thanks so much.

First ever meal made in a slow cooker, had to add hot sauce when I was eating it. Did not use the file powder because I live in a small town and no body knew what it was. Found it really wet, don't know if that's normal for Jambalaya but next time I'm gonna try adding tomato paste to thicken it up (didn't have any this time)

I didn't have andouille sausage so used what I had on-hand.  This is a keeper!
