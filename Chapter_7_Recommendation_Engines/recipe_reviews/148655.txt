We all enjoyed this dish.  I made the mistake of using a dark 60% chocolate that was not bittersweet.  Then I had to "doctor" the sauce by adding more balsalmic and salt.  In the end it was good but you could taste the chocolate too much.  Also, I made this for 8 people so I quadrupled the sauce when 2X the sauce would have been plenty.

Incredible!!!!  I had something similar in Canada, and the restaurant added blue cheese on the top, so I added blue cheese and the two flavors were wonderful together.

This was in fact, Excelent! I did make a few alterations to the original recipe.  First, I used a bonless rib eye roast insted of tenderloin.  I had no shallots so I substituted onion, garlic and ginger.  The ginger flavor was subtle but added complexity.  I used boulion insted of beef stock.  I added some chopped bacon to add some smookey meat flavor. I thought it could use a thickener, so I added a teaspoon of flour/water.  Next time, I think I would chop the onions and garlic a little larger to keep the sauce more chunky.  

I trippled the recipe (6 servings) for the sauce because it looked so good.  Now I have leftovers.

The sauce was simply to die for!  I made the recipe exactly as written except I used choice petite sirloin and grilled it outside.  The sauce may sound strange, but it it is superb!  You must try it to believe it!  Makes a romantic entre for you and your special someone.

This sauce was amazing ! I carmelized the shallots and sprinkled them over the top instead of mincing them and putting them in the sauce. I set the steak over roasted red potato rounds (cooked in olive oil until crispy). The flavors and textures were awesome. I also accompanied the fillet with a sea scallop. I think the sauce mixed even better with the scallop ! There's a local restaurant that does a simila sauce that everyone raves about, but this sauce is superior. Thanks !

fantastic recipe. The fresh rosemary does the trick and blends wonderfully with the port, balsamic and chocolate. 
I just added a pinch of corn flower to thicken the sauce just a bit more. Also added pepper corns and a bit of salt  in the sauce. It combined wonderfully with mashed potatoes (cooked with grated cheese and nutmeg) and asparagus. 
Be sure to try this recipe and you wont regret it !!

This dish was delicious.  We didn't have port in my house, so I substituted Cream of Sherry for it instead--it was still yummy.  We also didn't have shallots so I minced garlic and red onion together.  I cooked this for my parents and they were both extremely impressed.  I plan on cooking this for my boyfriend soon! I definatly recommend this recipe.

Very Good! Loved the sauce.  Easy to make, yet tasted gourmet. I served this with mashed potatoes and carmelized butternut squash.

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT RECIPE. SEARING THE STEAKS IN A HOT PAN INSTEAD OF GRILLING THEM GIVES THEM A NICE STEAK-HOUSE LIKE RESULT. I ADDED JUST A BIT LESS CHOCOLATE AND A BIT LESS VINEGAR, AND THE SAUCE WAS ABSOLUTLY PERFECT WITH JUST A HINT OF CHOCOLATE. MY FILLETS WERE FROM COSTCO, SO THEY WERE VERY THICK. I COOKED THEM ABOUT 5 MINUTES A SIDE, OR TO 123 DEGREES ON MY MEAT THERMOMETER FOR MED. RARE. I THEN WRAPPED THEM IN FOIL FOR A FEW MINUTES FOR THE JUICES TO RISE. YUM!!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!

Easy to prepare, sauce is very good. I would use about half the chocolate next time; it had slightly too strong of a chocolate taste for my liking.

I was very excited about this recipe, but was very unhappy with the way it turned out. For some reason, the sauce tasted very salty and bitter. I used red wine instead of port though, which may have had something to do with it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

I am not really much of a beef eater. This recipe makes me want to change my mind. It is easy to cook but is still fancy. Perfect for a busy family that wants something different.I served it with a bake potato and asparagus.

I wanted a decadent sauce for steaks that wasn't cream-based.  This was exactly it.  I used the full one ounce of bittersweet chocolate (60% cacoa) called for and thought it was just right.  It's a deep and rich flavor that complimented my filet mignon steaks perfectly.  After drizzling sauce over meat I topped with bits of fresh bacon.  I can't wait to make this again and again.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe! Make sure to take the shallots out or the sauce is chunky. Pay attention that the chocolate doesn't get too thick, an A-1 consistency seems right but not what I ended up with.

you would never believe the sauce would be this good looking at the ingredients but they blend so nicely. I thought the sauce tasted too chocolatelyat first until I added salt and pepper to taste and a splash more port. Then, it was as good as any restaurant would serve. We had people over and this was served on the plate with a filet mignon in the center of it and it was oh soo good. I recommend this dish for entertaining and you would swear you served a 300.00 dollar meal for way less.

I prepared this with ribeye steak, and while the sauce was interesting, most of us thought it was a little too rich.  I may try this again with half the chocolate as others have recommended.

Love this! It is not too sweet and my only complaint is that the balsamic vinegar is a bit strong. I would use 2 teaspoons instead of a tablespoon.

Have reviewed over 100 recipes on AR and can say this is now a favorite.  The cooking time for each filet was considerably longer for me (in part, because my filets were larger).  I used regular bittersweet chocolate chips which I had on hand, along with dried rosemary (cutting back on the amount).  Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Will make again, and again...

The sauce was good, not sweet with a ruby port and 72% cacao chocolate. Be sure to use a quality balsamic vinegar. Taking the extra time to caramelize the shallot is worth it.

Added a little garlic and horseradish to the sauce with the shallots - put it with prime rib instead of tenderloin.  Amazing!!!!  We couldn't get enough of this and had a dark chocolate rimmed glass with port wine for dessert.  The perfect meal!!!

The sauce was terrible, we wouldn't eat it.  I don't know if that is because of my cooking or my flavor preferences, but the rosemary was overwhelming, and the sauce was bitter.  Adding more chocolate to try and salvage it didn't work either.

We tried this last night with great success. I reduced the beef cooking time a minute per side, to only three minutes, which gave a perfect medium rare. The sauce was incredible! My boyfriend is still raving about the unique flavours. Highly recommended.

I tried this recipe for valentines day and we both absolutely loved it! We are not really red meat people but we both found this really delicious. Rather than fry the steaks first, i cooked the shallots and garlic in the oil first then added the steaks to this to pick up more flavour. I also added a little stock to the sauce to make it gob a bit further. Will definately be doing this again.

Made this for a dinner party & though the steaks turned out great, I thought the sauce masked the flavor of the steaks. Luckily, I served the sauce on the side, which would be my suggestion to others. Funny we all agreed that the sauce tasted good w/the mashed potatoes, but really was to strong for the steaks. Don't think I'd make this again.

Yummy! My husband made this for my birthday, knowing that I love fillet and chocolate. He did reduce the chocolate to about 1.5 oz, which was perfect. We don't have peppercorns or coarse salt on hand, so he used the basic kitchen variety of salt and pepper and still resulted with a bit of a pepper crust. Good enough if that's all you have on hand, but I am sure the fresh crushed peppercorns would have really crusted up nicely.

It was an interesting concept, chocolate and port and I looked forward to doing it. Personally I didn't like the peppercorns as too many fell of while I was cooking the steaks. Also I found 4 minutes a side was not enough to cook the beef to the correct temperature. Thankfully I had the oven on for a separate reason and found that by sticking the beef in the oven while I made the sauce, it was enough to finish cooking it.

That said, the sauce is really simple to make. It provides an interesting and different flavor. Makes me consider combining beef and chocolate in the future.

I loved this, my only complaint is that I would have liked more sauce.  I'll double the sauce next time, and I think it will be great.

UPDATE: Doubled the sauce and it is by far the best beef tenderloin I have ever made.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you!

I made this tonight for my husband paired with french onion soup. We loved it! I was very skeptical about the chocolate part but it made it oh sooo good! I didn't make any substitutions at all.
