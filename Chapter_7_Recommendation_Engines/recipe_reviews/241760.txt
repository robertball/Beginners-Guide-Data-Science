Easy Energy Balls Haiku: "Cinch & fun to make. (Wet your hands when rolling balls, cause it's so sticky!)" My daughter and I enjoyed making these together, and other than using 1/4 c. ground flax and 1/4 c. chia seeds instead of the full half cup of flax seeds, kept everything the same. Couldn't bring myself to roll them as large as golf balls b/c they pack a punch - energy, and crazy-filling. Ate one b4 jumping rope and added 10 min. onto my jam. Not to mention that they taste crazy delicious. I also used mini chocolate chips rather than regular size b/c I don't think the balls would've held together quite as well w/ the bigger chunks. Recipe doesn't specify to refrigerate or freeze which is my only complaint - wondering where and how long they keep ...

Good recipe and addicting. Changed a few things, used chunky natural peanut butter, mini dark chocolate chips and 1/3 cup of ground flax seeds ( that's what i had). Ate two while making them. WOW!! I can see this with other chips and seeds. Thanks for the after workout or midday at work pick me up.

Made with ingredients on hand like regular oats, and amaranth instead of flax seed.  Still came out great! Yielded 12 balls.

I make these often.  Instead of balls I press them into a brownie pan and cut into squares.  Much easier in my opinion.

I make these energy balls about every other week.  I stick to the main ingredients, oatmeal, peanut butter, honey & mini dark chocolate chips.  I change it up,  sometimes substituting cut up apples in place of the bananas, I put in raisins, and/or dates, ground flax seed, chia seeds, coconut.  In other words, whatever I have on hand at the time!  I LOVE them, and very often keep a few in a baggie in my car if I should get stuck somewhere.

Could one possibly forget to add the chocolate chips in this? Yup - that was me. Ugh! Didn't realize it until I was done rolling these little buggers up so I decided to roll them in more coconut. Who doesn't love coconut? These were a breeze to throw together. Don't think I'll make again - even adding chocolate. They just weren't for me.

I substituted Splenda with Xylitol and used egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs and added a few carob chips at the 10 minute mark. They are a nice little sweet treat! I will make these again.

Added 1/2 up pecan meal.  Yum!!!!!  I'm addicted.

2017 Update:  Changed to unsweetened coconut flakes and stevia sweetened dark chocolate chips.  Added small amount of stevia sugar.  Healthier!

2018 Update:   I flattened one out and heated in microwave for 10 seconds.  OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Pretty good. I put them in my husband's lunch. I think it could be rather expensive to make all the time though. I use a rounded measuring tablespoon to make equal sized balls, works really well. Helps to wash hands if too sticky mid-prep. Or refrigerate and it sticks to your hands less as well.

I appreciate this recipe - honestly, you can play with it.  I used regular oats and ground them, also added wheat germ, dried cherries cut up, some walnuts, almonds and when it looked a little dry, I added a few teaspoons of real maple syrup.  Don't be afraid to experiment with this recipe - put in what you like!

You can add/subtract different items to this recipe.  We used cashew butter, dates, walnuts, and just invented as we made them.  Mix and match what you want.  It's fun to experiment.  Good stuff.  The whole family enjoys them.

I LOVE THESE! Totally addicted to them! I seem to always have to have them in my fridge to have one or two a day! I like making them with half maple syrup and half honey to the measurements in the recipe and I add sunflower and pumpkin seeds. I also like to add vanilla and almond extract.

Yummy! Added chopped walnuts and added a little extra honey. Didn't have flax seed or coconut, so didn't use them. Used 5 minute oatmeal. Super sticky - someone had a good idea to wet your hands when rolling.

Tried the recipe for long distance endurance bike races.   Good energy source and tasty.  Next batch I'm going to substitute coconut flakes for coconut spread for more flavor and better ball consistency.

I love these!  At first I was skeptical because the nutrition facts appear as though each ball is 508 cals, however, when I made this recipe it yielded 25 golf-ball sized balls which comes out to 100 cals per ball.  They are very filling and delicious!

I double the recipe and do half flax seed and half chia seed (both ground). I also find that it is easier to mix the dry ingredients first and then add the honey and peanut butter to mix it all together. Put 'em in the fridge and eat them the next day.  I have made a big double batch for the last three Sundays and eat them throughout the week.  I have started to buy these items in bulk because I know I will be making these every week for a long time. They are that good.

I was surprised at how much I liked these. I don't do much with flax seed, and when I got to the store I found that I could get ground flax seed or whole seed. Since I was just trying this out, I bought a little packet of ground flax seed that was just shy of the measured amount. It worked out well. I didn't change anything else in the recipe and I did not find it to be dry or sticky. Overall, none of the ingredients are overwhelming. They blend nicely. They are better after chilled, in my opinion. 

I am surprised at how many reviewers rave about the nutrition of these balls. At over 500 cal per serving, lots of fat and carbs, I just don't know where everyone else gets the idea that these are so healthy. The flax seed can't make up for fat and honey has calories and carbs. I got 28 small balls per recipe when I used my melon baller for portioning and checked the nutrition stats. The listed nutrition is pretty close to what I calculated. 

All in all, they are pretty good and I'll make them again.

I just finished making my second batch of these, which my family loves! I'm always looking for a quick and healthy snack that we can take on the go and this definitely fits the bill. I did have to substitute for the flax seed. I can't eat them so I used 1/2 cup hulled hemp hearts and also added 1/4 cup chia seeds. I mixed everything together, threw it in the fridge for a half-hour then rolled into balls about gumball size. I freeze some to send with my husband for lunch, they are perfect for him after a few hours in his lunchbox. If you're looking for an easy, healthy snack, look no further! These taste like cookie dough but without all the sugar and calories. Thank you Meghan!

These were a hit with my kids!  I wish I could give it four and a half  stars.  The only thing that didn't work for me was the flax seeds.  They get stuck in our teeth and braces.  I changed it to ground flax seed as some have suggested and it was perfect.  I do like the mini chocolate morsels since they are easier to roll in.   These are now a staple at our house.  A great way to get my little athletes to eat more protein.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made one change. I subbed sunflower seeds for flaxseed. Did not have any flaxseed and wanted to make this. These are really good. I was very surprised at all the flavor. I think next time I will add more honey and peanut butter because as I got to the end of making the balls the mixture was too dry to form balls. I also chopped up my chocolate chips. Next time I will buy the minis. Be sure you chill these before and after making.

These are a nice treat and easy to make. Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the size. Made mine smaller than golf balls for a bite size snack. I used all natural peanut butter and I think that might have made them a little on the dry side. They still tasted good. Thanks for sharing Meghan Fulop
