I used this recipe for dinner tonight.  I followed the general recipe but tweaked many things.  Instead of using a slow cooker I used my pressure cooker.  It has the same effect, but cooks it in literally a fraction of the time.  My total prep time (including cooking) was no more than 30 minutes.  My husband and I both LOVED this recipe!!  

- Instead of using 2 cooks of water I used 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup water.  
- Instead of using refrigerated squash I peeled and cube a small fresh butternut. 
- Added 1 small onion 
- Used kale instead of spinach. 

If you decide to use a pressure cooker you must add your pasta and kale at the end.

I make this on a semi-regular basis. My husband limits his carbs and loves squash, so I leave the pasta out and typically use a lot more squash than it calls for (I buy a whole one and put it all in). The squash cooks to mush and acts as the base of the soup, so it turns out more like a stew than a soup, but we love it. It makes great leftovers and with the exception of cutting up the squash, it's super-easy to make!

Because of not adding the pasta, I reduce the time on the final step where that and the spinach are added; I stir in the spinach, then leave the pot on just long enough for the spinach to wilt.

What a wonderful recipe!  I use PAM all the time, but never thought to spray it inside my crock pot.  Terrific idea that'll be repeated.  This soup was good even a few days later.  The squash held its shape but was soft as butter.  What'd I do different?  Just added an onion to the mix.  Definitely a repeat in this house.  Thanks!!

This was really good and simple, I did add onions in the beginning but I think it would be great without too. Thanks for the recipe PAM!

Amazing! Very simple to prepare. I used fresh butternut squash. Easier to peel and cube than I thought it would be. Used about 2/3 of a small squash. Realized I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a full 28 oz can of peeled Italian tomatoes and added the spices including fresh oregano and garlic and dried basil.  I used chicken stock instead of water. I think this would also be good without meat.  Sprinkle a little parm on top! Very delicious and satisfying.

This was delicious!  I had kale to use up so used that instead of spinach. I liked the extra texture it gave to the soup.  I also substituted turkey sausage and added a bit more pasta.  I cut up my own squash into 1/2"cubes which held up great. I froze half the batch and all the textures and flavors held well after freezing.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was very nice! I used mini shells because thats what I had on hand. What a great idea to put Pam Cooking Spray in the slow cooker. I use it every time now and my clean up time is cut in half!

Easy and delicious. What more could you ask for? I used Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage links. I just cut each one in half vertically and then cut small pieces. I didn't remove the casing. Seems easier than using the bulk sausage and forming it in fingers. I loved the hot spicy flavor this sausage gave the soup. I used the entire carton of squash and all the sausage, both more than what was called for in the recipe. Definitely will make this again!

I love to find a flavorful slow cooker meal.  We thought this was very good, a nice change of flavor from our usual sausage stews.  I used fresh butternut squash and frozen leaf spinach.  It worked out fine.

I had homemade Italian sausage from my local Amish Market.  This recipe came out fantastic.  I made the recipe as listed and I will certainly make it again.

This is a great recipe, one that I will make again & again!  Substituted frozen green beans for the spinach, used all of my squash and only had Italian hot sausage, which gave it an  extra kick that I like.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

On weekends I will make 1 or 2 soups in my crockpot and portion and freeze them for quick weeknight meals. This was quick and easy, I might seer the sausage next time to hold in some of the flavor. The squash disintegrated on reheating. Not sure if that was supposed to happen, doesn't matter. Made the soup thicker was all.

This was the best meal I have ever made!  I cooked it the first time following the recipe exactly.  It was fantastic but I'm a huge fan of spices, so the second time,  I added basil, oregano and Italian seasoning as well. I doubled the amount of garlic powder, as well as all the other seasonings.  All the veggies were fresh from my garden and I will be making this for many years to come!

This is soup that eats like a hearty meal!!  I've made it before and it's currently in the crock pot again for some guys doing construction on the house.  Only difference I make is to take out the Italian sausage and sub it for chopped andouille sausage.

I read the reviews and pulled out what made sense from several cooks with more ability than me.
It was a major hit (even with my in laws).
Am just retired, wife working, and thus, am propelled into the kitchen. Just finding my way and enjoying it , Seems like prep
takes me longer than it should , but hey, I have the time and
having fun.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this, and the ease of using the slow cooker. I will definitely make this again, I think it is 5 stars exactly as written!
