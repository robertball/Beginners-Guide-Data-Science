I really liked this recipe...the SECOND time I made it.  The recipe says to pour the mixture over the top of the hashbrowns and although I cooked for the required time, the soups never combined with the potatoes, resulting in crispy, stuck-to-the-pan potatoes on the bottom and cooked soup on the top.  HOWEVER...feeling that this recipe deserved a second chance, I mixed the hasbrowns together and then baxed.  YUMMY.  In addition, since my first disaster, when I have left over ham, I dice it up and throw that in too.  This is a much quicker version of the "au gratin" potatoes my mom used to make when they peeled, boiled and cubed potatoes. Now, I just throw in the ingrediants, MIX, cook and serve. Kudos Jennifer.

I just loved this recipe....I only did 2 things differently; after I baked the potatoes for 1 hour, I stirred the mixture and then added 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese; then baked the normal 30 additional minutes......if you are in a big hurry, the Ore-Ida potatoes O'Brian have onion and green pepper already included....saves a little chopping time....Wonderful recipe!

I have had a version of this recipe for many years.  Mine calls for cream of chicken soup and cream of mushroom and NO green peppers.  Also mix all ingrediants together, spread in 9x13 pan and then dot with 1/4 cup of margarine.  The margarine helps to take away some the the dryness. Yummy...

I made the following changes:  used 2 cans cream of onion soup and drizzled 1/4 cup melted butter over the top.  Covered with foil, baked at 350 for 1 hour.  Uncovered and stirred in 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup milk. Then I baked it an additional 15-20 minutes.  YUM!!!

This is good with a few modifications.  I've been making something similar for years that I like better: substitute some cream of onion and cream of chicken for the other soups, use sharp chedder, omit the green pepper, and mix everything up before putting into the pan.  I think it's much better this way!  If you use the Simply Potatoes (refrigerated) it takes hardly any time to make this dish.

The first time I made it I thought it was good but a tad dry so I added some milk to the sour cream/soup mixture to make it a little creamier the next time. I like to add half of the cheese to the mixture as well and stir it in with the potatoes. I usually bake this at a higher temp, at leat 350, for 1 hour. Then I take it out, stir it up, top with remaining cheese and let it bake until the cheese bubbles. Yum. When I make it for people that don't like onions, I just add some onion powder. Make sure you add salt and pepper to taste.

SUPER!  I follwed the recipe exactly the first time that i made this and it was WONDERFUL!  The next time though, I used half the recommended bell pepper and then added an extra cup of cheese before placing it back into the oven for the second time.  I even stirred the three cups of cheese into the potatoes so that it was blended nicely and it came out even better!  Thanks for this recipe!  It is a keeper!!

These are very good, I make them alot.  I used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of potato or celery.  This makes them very cheesy.

Awesome!!!  Just made this for tomorrow, for the 4th of July festivities (snuck some as a taster...WOW!!).  I used 1 can cream of chicken, and one can cream of celery (both Campbells healthy choice lowfat), threw in some minced garlic too.  Can't wait til tomorrow for another serving...I bet it's even better the next day!

The potatoes were good, but I changed the recipe slightly, as did others.  First, I took everyone's advise to saute the onion (in about 1 tablespoon of butter)before adding them to the soups, and they weren't crunchy as others had noted.  I omitted the green pepper and added instead 1 large minced clove of garlic.  I used the "grated" style of loose hashbrowns rather than the diced style, and the cream of potato soup used diced style potatoes so it looked odd in the dish.  After mixing the soups and sour cream, I thought the "sauce" looked way too thick and I had to resist thinning it with milk.  It turned out great: baking in the oven did the thinning of the sauce.  I also mixed some of the cheese in with the sauce and then topped off the potatoes with the last bit of cheese during the final cooking.  I would recommend keeping the oven temp at 300 rather than increasing it to 350 as I did.  My potatoes were a bit "hard" on the bottom of the dish.  I suppose a compromise of 325 might work well.  As stated earlier, don't forget the salt & pepper!!

I did not layer the ingredients as the recipe suggests.  Instead, I mixed the potatoes with the sour cream/soup mixture before baking them.  Delicious!

Excellent! I agree that this recipe should be mixed together before baking rather than layering. I added more cheese and topped it with crispy fried onions.

Quick and easy!  Very nice with meatloaf. I've tried other potato casseroles and they are usually very heavy...this wasn't....it was just perfect.

My kids loved these, and they are very picky!  Instead of hashbrowns, I used sliced potatoes boiled in water.  It was still EASY!

This recipe works with any type of creamed soup.  I prefer Cream of Potato, but have also used celery, chicken and mushroom.  The onions add a lot of flavor.  I didn't care for the peppers, thought they were too over powering, but we aren't pepper fans at our house.

Fantastic side dish! This made quite a bit, which was great because we had it for a couple of nights. I took the advice of others and added a bit more cheese, 2 cups. I also used bacon flavored cheddar cheese, which was terrific. This side dish is so versatile- we had it one night with slow cooked bbq chicken, once with scrambled eggs, and once with feta chicken breasts. That last one I got from this website as well and it goes wonderfully with the au gratin recipe! Thanks Jennifer!

I took the advice of the other reviews and mixed all the ingredients instead of layering them.  It was very moist and very good.  I took this to my luncheon at school, and everyone wanted the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

I changed this quite a bit and it we like it better now. I pushed the temp up to 350 and baked for 75 minutes so the top got nice and brown.  I added 2 cans of mushrrom soup, 2 cups of sour cream, left out the green peppers added more onion and a little bit more then a 1/4 cup of melted butter.  I also added 3 cups of grated extra old cheddar cheese.

My family absolutely loves these potatoes.  I'm not sure I should rate this recipe since I do a few things differently.  I only use one can of cream of mushroom or celery soup, 2 cups of sour cream, 2 c of cheddar, onion and mix it all together before placing in pan.  Topping: combine 2 c crushed crackers and 1/2 c melted margarine.  I serve this for company often and everyone loves it.  (If you thaw your hash browns in the fridge, you can cook it 50-60 minutes at 350.)

Fantastic! Following advice from other reviewers, I used cream of celery and mushroom soups, along with Ore-Ida O'Brien potatoes. Then mixed all together before baking. Had company over and they sure enjoyed them! Will be making these again!

Good and easy, but a little bland.  I'm going to make it again but I think that I'll add some salsa along with some black beans or ground soy.  Excellent potluck dish as it makes so much, but it reheats well if you are making it for fewer people.

Not a bad recipe but I wasn't that impressed.  I would suggest sauting the onions before adding them to the soup mixture. Some reviewers mentioned that it was dry but this didn't happen to me.

I made this recipe for our family & friends Sunday dinner and decided to use freshly grated russet potatoes and prepped it the night before.  The dish itself was extremely tasty; however, I made a rookie mistake when the first person dove into the pan, the potatoes were BLACK!!  I shredded them, threw them in a pan, covered them with the cheese sauce mixture and threw press-n-seal over them and put the pan in the fridge.  I left out the green pepper, used scallions and added cooked-crip-chopped bacon.  Aside from the bizarre and somewhat unappealing blackness to the potatoes, I surprisingly had NO leftovers and people went back for seconds.  Now, I know if I'm going to use fresh potatoes, I need to cook the dish immediately, immerse them in water or add a citric acid (lemon, lime juice) to them to keep them from oxidating.  All in all, good recipe, will try it again.

This is a simple, tasty recipe.  I skipped the green pepper and used dried chopped onion.  I added an 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.  We'll have this again.

I have made this with Cream of Mushroom(instead of cream of potato) and cream of broccoli soup (instead of cream of celery) and sometimes added ham to make this a main course and skipped the green peppers.

The texture was very nice, and like some others I did saute the onions first, and mixed all the ingredients together.  However, neither I nor my family like the taste of the celery soup in it.  It added a weird vegetable taste that did not belong.  Next time I will definitely either use all cream of mushroom, or sub in cream of chicken.

I have made a recipe like this many times for weddings too with great success except with cream of chicken soup instead and use crushed cornflakes browned in butter to sprinkle all over the top. The cornflakes make it even more tasty as long as they are golden browned in your skillet before topping with them.

Great recipe.  I use 2 c. of cheese - mix one in and top w/rest.  Also, OreIda makes potatoes O'Brien, which is small cubed potatoes w/gr pepper and onion already in the bag.  Good time saver.

Very tasty I also topped it the last 5 minutes with durkee french fried onions.

The dish definately needs mixed before baking.  Our family found it a little on the bland side as written.  Next time I will try some of the suggestions for sicing it up.  The dish is easy to make and would be very good for the church covered-dish dinner.

Easy dish when you're in a hurry.  Reasonably good.  I left out the green pepper, used a little extra onion and, in doubling the recipe (that turned out to be unnecessary--as written the recipe served 12 people comfortably) used 2 cans cream of celery, 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of potato.

Always a crowd pleaser!  BIG and better difference is made when adding a can of Golden Mushroom soup instead of Cream of anything else....also gives it a nice golden color ;)

Made this for Thanksgiving yesterday. After reading many of the reviews, I decided to make some modifications before trying the recipe as it was written.  - substituted condensed broccoli cheddar soup for the cream of celery.   - substituted the Simply Potatoes Shredded Hash Browns for frozen potatoes (used 1.5 x 20 oz packages) - sauteed the diced onion before adding to the mixture.  - put a single layer of potatoes on the bottom of pan  - mixed the remaining potatoes with all the other ingredients   - added salt, pepper and southwest chipotle seasoning to the mixture  It came out great. The only thing I would have done differently was mix the shredded cheese in with everything else instead of melting it on the top.   Everyone was happy and it was a simple recipe to put together, even if the baking time is long.

Always comes out great. I've made this countless times and never have any issues with it. Makes great leftovers and really hits the spot. I love how easy it is and that it can either be a side dish or a meal depending on what's going on.

This dish really did not have as much flavor as I expected.  I had high hopes with the other ratings, but it did not at all meet my hopes as a faster substitute for the potatoes au gratin craving.

I followed the recipe, but it was so bland. Definitely needed some salt and cheese mixed in with the potatoes, rather than just on top.

I want to note that I rated this the way I made it, NOT how the recipe instructs!
I wanted to make a low-fat version of this, so here's what I did:
Hash browns, cream of potato soup, 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, 8oz light sour cream, diced onion, shredded cheddar made with 2% and then splashed some milk and fat free butter on top (the only thing I omitted was the green peppers and I'm glad I did).
It turned out as good as a low-fat version of the recipe could be! I want to make it again, but next time add a little kosher salt, a dash of pepper and maybe a little more onion.
I'll also bake it for longer because the hash browns were cooked, but could have been a little more done (but that, I'm sure, has everything to do with the fact that my ingredients had less in them).
Overall, great recipe to change up and into something a little lighter!

I used a can of cream of potato, a can of cream of chicken, a splash of milk, about a cup of sharp cheddar and the shredded type of hashbrowns. As recommended, I sauted an onion - but ommitted the pepper.I baked with my ham for an hour at 300.  Then I toppped with french fried onions and baked an addition 15-20 minutes. They were unbeleivable! A new staple in our house! So perfect with ham!

Good. I got lazy so instead of buying fresh veggies I bought the frozen hash browns that come with green pepper and onion. I halved the recipe  and used only one can of low fat cream of celery instead of the two cans the recipe calls for. I also subbed fat free sour cream instead of regular.

Once again, this site has come through! This is a great dish, I did make a couple of modifications... I substituted the cream of celery soup with cream of mushroom soup, added appx 2 Tsp of fresh minced garlic and generous amounts of black pepper & seasoned salt. VERY GOOD!

I made this dish to take to my In-Laws along with a recipe for cream corn that also comes from this web-site,for a birthday dinner..... There was none left on both dishes. 
I had to e-mail both to my Mother-in-Law when we got home & she in turn sent them to everyone she knows (I haven't told her about this web-site
and not going to either) Wonderful easy recipe

Great and easy! I used lowfat soups and fat-free sour cream. I also sauteed the onions and bell peppers beforehand, and didn't add cheese. Was just fine! Definitely mix everything together first. I baked on 350 for about 70 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!!

I mixed the potatoes with all the ingredients (even the cheese) and used condensed celery soup and condensed cream of mushroom soup with added fresh chopped celery.  It came out great and the crowd loved it.  I adjusted the quantity to 35 and the preparing and cooking in bulk with this recipe was a breeze.

Had with ham this past Easter - everyone loved it. My son who was home from school for the weekend has already made it for his buddies - big hit all around. I tried a second time and mixed the soups, cream cheese, etc with the potatoes before cooking. Actually liked it better with the hash browns on the bottom layer. I swapped cream of mushroom for the potato soup - liked this swap.

Very creamy and cheesy.  Simple enough to make.  I probably added closer to 2 cups of cheddar (extra sharp), but I'm from Wisconsin so that is to be expected.  Good stuff!

These were ok I used simply hashbrowns cubed, I think sliced or shredded would taste better with at least a tsp of salt and pepper. I LOVE peppers but with this dish I wouldn't add any maybe a red pepper would taste better. Also next time I will add  a 1/2 C fresh shredded parmesan cheese  and target then layer I will mix all together and then top with more parmesan cheese at the last 15-20 min till lightly golden and crusted. - will update when I make it again

Made this for a big family group and everyone loved it. I followed the suggestions to mix everything together and it worked out quite well. I left out the peppers and onions and seasoned with garlic pepper.  I'm making it for the second time and I'm adding some of the cheese with the first mix and will put the remaining cheese on top.

Not bad, a bit much on the sauce factor. But decent. I used the Ore Ida Brand Potato O'Brian verison hash browns that have the onions and bell peppers in them, so I omited the onion and peppers in the recipe so that I didn't have overly to much. But I certainly could have used a but more of the hash browns in this recipe to due to the amounts of soups and sour cream. But again a decent recipe.

Very good.  I also used the O'Brien potatoes.  I also mixed the cheeses up a bit and used cheddar, parmessan and pepperjack.  I also mixed the soups and potatoes together before baking.

Awesome recipe and so easy.  I did add a couple pats of butter to the top and I added some milk to the recipe to make it moister.  It was a big hit with everyone.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  It was different, easy to make, and had that sweet, salty taste which goes good with asian dishes.  I will definitly make this again.

Made this again this weekend. Fast and easy. Any cream soups could be used and it would still taste great. Tip: Thawing the potatoes reduces cooking time.

I had a pound of Yukon Golds and a ton of cheddar cheese left over from Thanksgiving, so I thought I'd give this recipe a try to use some of it up.  I only used 1 can cream of mushroom soup (it was all I had, I think it would have been even better with cream of celery!) and no sour cream (used milk instead).  I used 1/2 T onion powder instead of a fresh onion, and omitted the bell pepper.  Even though I halved the potatoes, I still used the full 1 1/2 cups of cheese.  These were pretty good...although I have to admit, way more work, way more waiting, and way more fat than just opening up a box of the "instant" au gratin potatoes....the potatoes obviously tasted a little fresher, but for the ease of things, I think I will probably only use the recipe when I've got extra potatoes and cheese lying around!!  If I do make these again, I will probably try cheddar cheese soup and/or cream of celery.  **Please keep in mind...I drastically changed the recipe by not adding sour cream, so don't let my review affect your decision unless you weren't planning on using it either!!**  By the way, I upped the oven temp to 375 degrees, and although I was using raw potatoes, I was still able to shave 20 minutes off of the cooking time (45 min before adding the cheese, 25 after).

This is a good recipe, but I felt that some milk could have been added.  It seemed to be a tad to thick.  Next time I make it I will add some milk.

A delicious recipe as a dinner side dish, and very easy. Here are a few tips and/or modifications that I made that I feel enhanced this recipe. First and foremost, I do not add green peppers. The taste is a bit overpowering, and it becomes more potatoes O'Brian than au gratin. Secondly, I add whatever 2 "cream of" soups I have available. Chicken, celery, mushroom, you get the drift... Third, I add the 1/4 c. of milk that everyone is talking about to the mix. It really does make it less dry. Fourth, I cook it with a foil covering for the 1st hour.

A couple of tips that I've found:
To grease the pan- Take a cold stick of butter and run it along the inside of the pan, into the corners especially, and all over the bottom of the pan. Coat the entire inside of the pan with your butter stick before adding ingredients. My potatoes have never stuck, and it's because of this old trick my Nana showed me.
Cut peeled fresh potatoes in the food processor (or by hand if you must) into 1/4" rounds. In my opinion, this is what really makes the dish.

Easy and unique dish. I followed someone's feedback in that I mixed it all together in the pan before throwing it into the oven - made preparation even simpler. GREAT way to offer a potato dish a different way.

I didn't have cream of celery soup (all out at the store) so I substituted cream of mushroom soup.  It was really good.  My picky toddler even ate her entire serving.  I will definitely make this again.

I had to make a potato dish on the spur of the moment and tried this one.  What a hit!  Had to leave the leftovers so our breast feeding friend could eat it the next day and all wanted the recipe.  I would certainly make it again - and again!

The best Au Gratin potatoes ever. I kept the onions in the recipe because it adds flavor to the potato/cheese sauce combination. The house smelled delicious for hours afterwards!  Thanks so much. I've tried other Au Gratin recipes but none compare to this one. This is a keeper.

This was so easy to make, it took so little time and it was yummy.  I think next time I may try to make it with low fat /fat free soups and Sour Cream and add a bit of heat to it.

This was very good.  This was great side dish for breakfast.  I acutally used the cream of potato and cream of mushroom soups and used assorted shredded cheeses to top it with.  For a little extra flavor you can add bacon crumbles, diced ham or even sausage.

Based on other reviews I mixed all the ingredients except approx a cup of the cheese together and baked that way (for an hour).  Then put on the rest of the cheese and baked for another half hour.  I didn't have potatoe soup so I used cream of chicken per other reviews.  We really liked it.  Will make this a regular recipe.

I made this recipe the other night with a few modifications.  I used cream of chicken soup because that is what I had.  Instead of pouring the mixture on top I combined all the ingredients together and then added a little cheese in with the mixture.  I also sauteed my onions for a few minutes before adding in.  I also added black pepper, a little salt and a couple of drops of tabasco.  I did attempt to speed up the cooking but as stated by another reviewer, it caused the dish to brown too much on the bottom.  I will try again on 325.  I also used light sour cream and a splash of fat free half and half.  Yummy dish.  I am making it again for a potluck on Friday.

I would actually give this recipe 3 1/2 stars.  I made it exactly as written.  We found that the potatoes were pretty mushy.  Also, I think I would sautee the onions and green peppers first, as they were still crunchy in the finished dish.  These were much better the second day, the flavors seemed to meld together.  I might make this again.  It was easy for sure.

This was good and simple.  I used frozen potatoes O'Bryan because I had run out of onions and green peppers.  I also didn't have cream of potato soup so I used cream of mushroom soup and cream of celery  soup, and I used fat free sour cream.  So, you see, it's pretty flexible.

Very tasty, but the lengthy cooking time means that the oven is tied up for one hour and thirty minutes for a sidedish.

I followed the other advice about 350 for 1 hour w/foil, then uncover for 20 mins after  stirring in cheese. I think next time I would omit the bell pepper- it was too crunchy . This probably would be excellent the next day, fried as patties as someone else suggested. This is a very easy recipe indeed. Thank you!

Yummmmm! I made a few changes only because I was forced to. I used green onions because that's what I had and I just mixed the cheese right in and baked it at 350 for about an hour because that is all the time I had. My husband and I loved it and I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!

Terrific recipe! Very easy and user friendly.  I substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of potato soup and left out the onions and peppers because no one here likes them, and it turned out great.  Thank you for the great recipe.

This was very good.  I did however think that it needed more spice, which I added to the serving on my plate.  I will make this again and add some garlic salt and cayenne, and then top with crumbled bacon and additional cheese.  Thanks Ms. Bopp!

A big, sloppy mess.  This made a ton, and it filled up my trash can nicely.  It tasted very "factory" made and not at all like au gratin potatoes.  Kids(17, 14 and 10) wouldn't touch it either.

This was very good and easy.  I let the hashbrowns almost defrost; used low fat celery soup; low fat sour cream; 3/4 c. soy ched. and 3/4 c. reg. ched.  Still a good amount of flavor using healthier alternatives.  I'll make this again.  Even my picky husband liked it.

I added ham to this recipe to make it a main dish.  Was a little bland for a main dish.  Next time I will try adding green chilies and using monteray jack w/jalapenos for the cheese.

I made this for a work function.  It was delicious!  Very flavorful.  I added a bit more cheese and a dash of fresh black pepper.  I've had many people ask for the recipe!  My goal was to make a hearty side dish that my vegetarian work friend could eat at our party.  She had 3 helpings and still talks about it.

I made these potatoes for my daughter's birthday party.  I doubled the recipe to feed 20 people and I could have made more!  Everyone loved it and it disappeared!  It was also extremely easy to make.  It has been added to my permanent recipe box in the kitchen!

Give it 4.5 stars.  I dont' think it needs the green pepper, might be good to put chives on top at the end.  I used reduced fat sour cream,  It was still, very creamy.  I did mix the potatoes with the soup mixture after it baked for 60 min, then added the cheese.  Needed salt and pepper.

Good, but was disappointed at the lack of browning. I had read other reviews, and decided to mix everything before putting it into the dish. Baked as directed. Since it was pale, I added 1/2 cup milk over the top (to keep it moist) and put it into the oven at 350 for 15-20 mins. Much better. Good recipe - no changes except for at the end - more time in the oven. Thank you for sharing this EASY recipe!

I made this dish for a funeral and I was happy with the results, I will make again.  I sauteed the onion in a little butter and combined all ingredients before putting in the dish to bake.  Some reviews said this dish needed seasoning. I disagree.  I used a cooking onion, not a sweet onion, about the size of a clementine and the dish was flavorful, just needs fresh ground pepper.

Meh... it was okay.  It's lacking something zingy that would make it better.  I'd look for a different potato recipe next time.

VERY good. I usually don't like 'shortcut' type recipes, but decided to try this one and was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  My entire family enjoyed it and I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I will likely leave out the bell pepper as we just felt like it overwhelmed the dish -  just personal preference.  Also, I did mix all ingredients together (except cheese) instead of layering to make sure they were well blended.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I mixed all the ingredients together except the hash browns. After everything was well mixed, I added the hash browns. I  also added a little bit of Mrs.Dash and some black pepper. I stirred everything all together, making sure all the hash browns where well coated then placed everything in a baking dish to bake. These where better than mashed potatoes.

I heart this recipe so simple and easy. All ways a hit for potluck dinners. I did make some changes as I've gotten more comfortable w/this dish. Like others I mix cream of celery or mushroom and chicken, half stick of butter, an egg a little chicken seasoning, mix in a bag of Colby/Monterey Jack and and a cook on the stove top for maybe 10 mins to tenderize the frozen potatoes and melt butter while mixing all the ingredients. Adding the sour cream to mix before transferring to the Pyrex. For me this cuts the baking time which aids in reducing dryness. Cover w/foil bake on 350 for an hour. Stir, add sharp cheddar and motzerlla cheese and bake uncovered for an additional 20 mins. Enjoy!

I thought it turned out good but needs something, mabe bacon.  I went out and got a new glass pan that seem a little too big.  I would also add salt and pepper to the mix.

I made this for Christmas dinner, thinking it would save me some time. And it did, but the dish was not as good as I expected from the reviews. I did make it as the recipe said to, so perhaps I'll give it another chance sometime, incorporating ideas others have shared. In the meantime, I'll keep looking.

This was a great recipe and my first time making au gratin potatoes from scratch. The only difference is I used real potatoes and baked at 400 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. My fiancee really enjoyed the green pepper addition. Definitely a great potato side dish that I will be making for a long time. Whether you're using hashbrowns or real potatoes make sure to mix them with the other ingredients, don't just pour over it otherwise it won't come out right. I also added salt and pepper for a bit of seasoning.

Cant say I would call this au gratin potatoes, but I didn't think it would be made with hash browns. It also is not the best hash brown casserole I have ever had. We found it very bland and I added 4 times to amount of cheese plus salt and pepper. Will not make it again, easy isn't always best.

It was good.  Oddly enough, my husband and I thought it actually tasted better the second day on re-heat.

I would make it again because it was so easy.

I did change the recipe after reading lots of reviews:
 - Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom
 - Obrien potatos with diced green bellpeppers and onions already in the mix.
 - Sharp cheddar cheese - mixed 1 cup of cheese with the mix and sprinkled more cheese on top at the end with French Fried Onions

This took quite a while to cook.  The directions said to pour the mixture over the potatoes, but did not say to mix.  However, after cooking for 60 minutes, I realized that I needed to mix the potatoe and mixture together.

My wife and I really like this recipe. I use this instead if mashed potatoes as a topper to my Shepard's pie VI (from this site). I cut the recipe in half and use cream of celery soup and cream of mushroom soup ( save leftover soups in a Ball mason jar in fridge). I leave out the green peppers and onions because I put onions in my Shepard's pie. Using this recipe is much easier than the mashed potato topping called for in the Shepard's pie recipe and very Tasty!

I tried what some reviews suggested and mixed the sauce with the potatoes.  The taste was fine, but the sauce spread out on the plate.  This could be due to using potatoes that weren't fully thawed.,,not sure.

It was good, though I made some changes. Per the other reviews and my own experience, I opted to mix everything together, then bake rather than just pour the 'sauce' over top. I also omitted the peppers just from personal preference.

I made the following modifications: (a) I pan fried red onions, green peppers, and red peppers, (b) added black pepper powder and some curry powder, (c) mixed everything together before baking.  Very nice recipe.

OK basic recipe. The cooking time is way over - only needs an hour. I put a little smoked chicken in which went a long way for more flavor.

I also love this recipe, but I make a few modifications. I use 2 cans of cream of celery and leave out the cream of potato. Haven't tried the green peppers but will next time. I also add a package of Eckrich polish kielbasa, cut in bite-sized pieces. And about 5 minutes before it's done, I add french fried onions to the top to brown.

Perfectly easy. These didn't taste like traditional au gratin potatoes but for a side dish they were just fine. I left out the green pepper and will have to make this again. Great recipe!

Sorry but we didn't care for this recipe. It had an odd taste to me. Maybe it was the cream of celery soup as I have never used that before. I gave this 3 stars because my oldest son and hubby ate it but my youngest and myself didn't like it at all.

I'm not sure what I did wrong but I did not care for this recipe. The taste was marginal. I possibly just don't like cream of celery soup and should have used mushroom as recommended. Who Knows!

This recipe was ok...I think it was better as a left over.  I like to make one dish meals, so I put a layer of ground beef on top of the potatoes, and then topped it with the soup mixture.  It tasted a lot like Hamburger Helper Cheesy Hash Brown; at least with that it only takes 20 minutes...I was expecting a lot better results with this recipe for almost two hours of cooking!

I was visiting family in another state and needed a good recipe to take to a family dinner. They loved this. The green pepper gives it a uniquely delicious taste.

This is a great starting place, but I usually add different kinds of soups depending on mood (cream of chicken, cream of mushroom). I also add more onion, mix the soup and veggies up in a bowl first and add a little milk. Pour this mix over the layer of hash browns and bake for twenty minutes longer. This makes the whole dish more tender. Overall, a great basic "comfort food!"
