I give this soup a round of applause!!! Okay, I may sound like a total idiot, but I just loved this! I was expecting it to be similar to Cream of Mushroom Soup, but it was more of a flavorful soup than a creamy, rich one. True, it was rich even though we used Skim Milk and Light Sour Cream. But it was fabulous nonethless! I can understand why some previous reviewers opted to lessen the lemon juice and dill. However, I think they all added to the flavor in a wonderful, round-about way. The only change I made is to use fresh basil instead of parsley because our parsley plant is, um, dead, but it was still excellent! With some bread and a salad, this soup is a complete meal. This might sound weird, but next time, I would consider adding some bacon. I think that would kick up the flavor another notch! (Quoting Emeril now :o) Some potatoes or chicken added might be good as well. Then it would be almost like chicken stroganoff soup? Yummy. This is one of my favorite soups!!! Oh, by the way, it was so easy to make! I am 15 years old and have only been cooking for about a year or so and found it SO easy! In fact, I did it while doing my homework. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Hubs and I found this soup excellent, exquisite and extravagant, but unfortunately we also both agree it falls short of perfection just for the fact that it calls for about twice the parsley it should. I used an "exotic mushroom medley," (package description, not mine) which gave this great texture, different shapes, and bold flavor.  The dill and lemon both play their parts and have important contributions. I used a good, sweet Hungarian paprika which really makes a difference in the final result.  Just delicious, but you kind of have to wade through the parsley!

This soup is absolutely delicious, and SO easy to make. My husband (who happens to be Hungarian) really liked it. Even though I used lowfat low sodium chicken broth, fat free sour cream, 2 tbsp dried parsley instead of fresh, lite soy sauce and 2% milk, it still had a very rich and flavorful taste. Here's a tip for slicing your mushrooms....use your eggslicer. Works like a dream!

Best mushroom soup I've ever had!  Very similar to the yummy Panera mushroom soups.  I've prepared this following the recipe exactly as written, as well as with some tweaks of my own -- it's all good!  I've settled into a recipe of using a variety of mushrooms (button, crimini, portobello, shitakii), fat-free half-and-half instead of milk, reduced fat sour cream, and a splash of sherry (in addition to the other original ingredients).  At the end, I use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup right in the pan, creating a smooth, creamy texture with chunks of mushrooms.  Wonderful!

This was one of the best soups I have found on this site, even though I omitted the butter and sour cream. I ate this right up and so did my partner, even though he is not a big mushroom fan. And it smelt fantastic whilst it was cooking! Thanks for a great recipe.
*UPDATE* I used this recipe in a soup competition and won first prize!

I love this soup.  I read the other reviews, and I didn't think there was too much dill or lemon,  it could have used a little more.  If you enjoy eastern european food (german, austrian, hungarian) you'll love this soup.  I did modify by adding 2 cups of diced potatoes at the stage that I added the broth.  I thought there would be plenty for leftovers, but that wasn't the case.  Three people ate the entire batch.  I will make double next time.

This recipe was easy and very, very good.  If all you have is salted butter to saute the onions and mushrooms with than eliminate the teaspoon of salt the recipe calls for at the end.  I didn't do this and found it to be much too salty.  The added soy sauce and chicken broth will also be salty so you might want to eliminate that extra teaspoon altogether if that's something you're concerned about.  However!  I will definitely be making this scrumpdillyicious recipe again! Thanks for sharing, Cathy. :)

This was fabulous - deserving of its high rating. Made a few changes - I put the onions through the food processor before saute-ing and after saute-ing the mushrooms with the onions - I put half the mixture through the food processor - then followed the recipe as indicated. It made a very elegant soup.

This is one of my most favorite soup recipes ever, but credit should be given where due.  This is from the Moosewood Cookbook and was first published about 30 years ago.    One suggestion is to vary the types of mushrooms in the soup - porcini, button, portabello, etc.

Delicious and very authentic!!!  My wife is from Hungary and I made this as a suprise for her on our anniversary.  She said it was the best mushroom soup she had ever eaten!  I did add a couple of crushed cloves of garlic to the onions, and when I served the soup I added a teaspoon of sour cream right to the top of the soup(they usually do this in Hungary)

The best mushroom soup I have ever eaten!!! I am not sure I could ever go back to canned.  I made this for a serving of 9 so it called for 1 l/2 cups of milk - I just changed that to 1 cup of milk and l/2 cup of heavy cream as others did.  Other than than, I followed the recipe exactly. This is a keeper!

I used reduced-sodium broth and soy sauce...that helped not make it too salty.  Also used fat free milk and non fat sour cream..the soup was still nice and rich.  However, next time I'd use half the dill, half the paprika, and half the parsley..then add the rest to taste.  Can be a bit overpowering.

This soup is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. My only modification was adding a splash of dry white wine, and using half the amount of butter. We really liked how rich it was, despite using fat-free milk and light sour cream. High-quality Hungarian sweet paprika is a must!

Exceptional soup for us mushroom lovers and it can also present as very company worthy.  Instead of adding the sour cream to the entire batch (we wanted to freeze some leftovers for later on), I served the soup in pretty bowls and then added a dollop of sour cream in the middle and a sprinkling of fresh, finely chopped parsley (didn't add lemon juice because I forgot).  I was afraid that upon freezing and then reheating with the sour cream already in the soup, it would seperate or curdle and look unappetizing.  DH, a very open minded man about eating meatless meals once a week, loved it.  We had Cheddar Bay Biscuits with it as well as a Cucumber Salad with vinegar, dill, sugar, and sour cream.  Very hearty meal.  Thanks for sharing!

I have added this recipe to my soup recipe collection and will be sharing it with my company this holiday season. The only changes I made were using ½ the amount of dill and I used sliced baby Portabella mushrooms as I prefer their taste to button mushrooms. The next time I make the recipe I may use thyme instead of the dill.

If I could rate this 100 stars, I would.  This soup was the most amazing I've ever tasted.  I didn't deviate from the recipe at all and ended up eating 2 bowls myself while my husband ate the rest.  Superb! Amazing!  Get over the fact that it isn't the color of most soups and enjoy! Will definitely be making this more often!

Have made this twice, the second time with cremini mushrooms (baby portobello mushrooms), reduced fat margarine and sour cream, fat free chicken broth (Kitchen Basics, the best), and skim milk.  The lighter ingredients did not affect the richness of this soup.   This recipe is as good as any mushroom soup I've ever had, including some served at fine restaurants.  The dill and the lemon definitely dominate, and next time, I'm going to start by reducing both by half, then taste, and add back if necessary.  REALLY good soup!

I thought it was very flavor, especially the next day, but hubby wasn't too crazy about it.  Said it was too mushroomy.

SO tasty! I added red potatoes and chicken... it made for a delicious, hearty, stew. I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I will definitely make this one again. Great with garlic bread!

Elegant, delicious and easy to follow recipe!  It takes a bit of time to prepare, closer to 1/2 hour than the 15 minutes listed, and it does take some tending, but it is worth the effort.  It is dinner party worthy, wonderful and fulling!  I have made it before on the stove than put it into a crockpot to maintain, everyone ate every little bit and wished for more!  Thank you , thank you thank you for this yummy soup!  Makes me almost like those cold winter days.

I LOVE this soup. I've had the recipe in my box forever, and kept hearing about it on the exchange, but I honestly thought it was a 'no big deal' recipe - so I kept putting off making it. I ended up with a lot of mushrooms, so I decided to try it. I used a little less onion and a lot more mushrooms, just because it was what I had. The rest of the recipe was followed exactly, except I garnished the soup with sour cream instead of mixing it in the pot so I can freeze this without any weird sour cream incidents when I thaw it. Loved the dill, paprika, and parsley - yum. Very different and good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good and fairly easy to make. The only change I made was to sub 2T olive oil for 4T butter. Oh, and I used habanero soy sauce (from the annual Fiery Foods Show), so it had a little kick. I actually thought this tasted better at room temperature rather than piping hot; it seemed to bring out the flavors.

Terrific soup! I used chanterelles and 2 Tbsp. fresh dill instead of 2 tsp. dried. I sautéed the onions and mushrooms in 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and removed them with a slotted spoon. I added one more Tbsp olive oil to the mushroom juices in the pan, and stirred in the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cooked it for a minute or two, and whisked in 4 c chicken broth (I like a brothy soup) rather than the broth and milk. Added the mushrooms/onions back to the pot, the soy sauce (I used tamari), the fresh parsley, and dill. Before serving, I stirred in about ¼ cup heavy cream, for richness. I served lemon wedges and sour cream on the side. I'm definitely making this again. With an extra cup of broth, this made four good main-dish servings…but I wish I'd doubled it! Oh, and I think it would be flavorful with any mushrooms, but the chanterelles were a real treat.

Excellent Soup!! I made this in stages. Made step 1 and then refrigerated it overnight. If you have the time I think it helps the flavors to blend, and lets you skim the fat off the top. Next day I continued by re-heating, the soup on low, then proceeding with step 2 and 3. I chose to add a dollop of sour cream to individual bowls at serving time instead of adding all at once. I will be making this on a regular basis, it's that good!

Love this soup.  I made a mistake and added too much Paprika.  I could taste the paprika, but it wasn't inedibile.  I can't wait to make this soup again correctly.  This will definitely be a regular in my rotation.  Next time may add some diced carrots or other vegetables.  Thank you for a delicious mushroom soup recipe!

Absolutely delicious, even with lite dairy ingredients and cheaper mushrooms. A nice touch is to add a splash of red wine to the sauteed mushrooms, then reduce. Really adds a richness to the flavor. I 100% recommend using this recipe!

We made this at a dinner party for friends and it was maybe the favorite dish of the night. Delicious, easy, quick. We doubled it and used oyster, button, portabella and baby bella mushrooms, all in nice big pieces. Really awesome. We had it ready up to the last step, and let it sit on the stove on very low heat. At the last minute, we added the final ingredients and heated through. Worked great.

Yowza, this is a great recipe!  It is both creamy and flavorful, and the mushrooms (I used portobello and crimini) make it a hearty meal on its own.  Vegetarians take note: I subbed vegetable stock for the chicken broth, and soy milk for the milk (I did use the sour cream as directed, however).   Needless to say, I ended up with a delicious soup that, when paired with sweet rolls (recipe available on this site) and a crisp white wine, proved to be a tasty meal.  Enjoy.

honestly? I LOVE Mushrooms.. and so does my family. I had to make a double batch because I wanted to get some (like most soups) and I terribly glad I did! Very flavor filled (I modified it and used varying mushrooms, like portabello, shitaki, and just regular mushrooms) and look forward to making it again and again. Thanks for posting this!!!!

We both really enjoyed this soup.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I just used 2tsps of dried.  I loved all the mushrooms but next time I might use an emulsion blender just for a sec or two to blend up some of the mushrooms.

I reduced the butter by half, used 2% milk and reduced fat sour cream and found this to be a very satisfying and delicious soup!  I served it with toasted rustic whole wheat bread.

I made this soup last night and it was delicious. Only three of us but no leftovers! I confess I tweaked it a bit. I added the flour to the pan after sauteeing the onions and mushrooms and cooked it in a roux...I think flour always tastes better if it's cooked. Then I added the spices, broth and milk. At that point it seemed a little thick to me (we prefer thin soups) so I added a third cup of chicken broth. I only had about 1/2 a cup of mushrooms, but I did have some leftover store rotisserie chicken, so I threw that in too. The whole family enjoyed it, will definitely make again.

DELICIOUS! I added a bit more chicken stock with corn starch at the end to make it a tad bit thicker and I used italian seasoning instead of dill because i didnt have any and i didnt add the sour cream.... I will try with dill even though it is my least favourite herb, just to see how it tastes. I would most def. double the recipe. Cannot wait to have it for left overs tomorrow. Served with fresh bread and salad for a nice light but filling meal!

Had been trying to find this recipe and was thrilled when I did.  Made it this weekend and we loved it!  Although the recipe says 6 servings--this would not be enough for a main course.  I made a couple of changes-used chicken stock instead of broth, 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk and only 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.  Instead of adding the flour with the milk I made a roux and added that.  This is a definate keeper and will be served frequeently.

This is an excellent soup.  I found it easy to put together with little mess and the results are just delicious.  It heated up beautifully the next day in the microwave.  I didn't have sour cream so used cream cheese thinned with milk.  Delicious!

I rarely review recipes but this was a must write. I am still blown away at how delicious this came out. I went along to a T on this recipe and highly enjoyed this. I do a lot of cooking, everything from scratch and this is the best surprise I've come upon in years. I will be sharing this to other family members, and I may make it with beef broth next time to enhance that meaty flavor. This could be sold at fine dining restaurants easily. I'm just so lucky to have found this and to live in the Mushroom Capital of the World. AKA, Morgan HIll. Thanks Hamm for sharing!

This soup was fabulous! When I make it again, I will probably use a bit more broth and a bit less sour cream. I also might add sausage or bacon and potatoes.

Yum! I've never had anything called Hungarian Mushroom soup so nothing to compare it to, but we really liked the flavor. I thought it might be too much paprika but it wasn't at all. Followed the recipe as is.

This is a delicious soup! It is very flavorful- even the onions hold their flavor in the end product! I wasn't expecting the dill to be a nice touch, as I normally don't like it, but it provided a very unique flavor. This is really a great, heart warming dish.  The ultimate test will be when  I try making it for my soup-hating boyfriend! :) Beware, though: if you are looking for a mushroom soup that is light, creamy, and the consistency of a canned soup that you mix with water, this is not it- it is almost like eating a sauce.

I disagree with the other reviews;  my husband - who will eat anything - and I both disliked this so much that we threw most of it away.  I think it's just very different from soups we're used to in the US, with the very strong paprika and an almost sour flavor - and no, my sour cream wasn't bad :)  Some people may like it, but just be aware that it's extremely strong.

Oh, by the way your recipe knocked my recipe of Best Italian Sausage soup out of the the top ten!! But thats ok, because I know as "Soup Season" is about to start I will be back, but this recipe is truly a TOP TEN!!!!

This was very yummy! I wanted to make something European because my husband is from Romania, and this soup really hits the spot.  It's actually classified a sauce over there, but it was yummy all the same.  I also added about a pound of boiled, chopped chicken right after adding the broth, and it worked out very well.  I also added just a little authentic spicy paprika to give it a little spicy-hot zing.  But the recipe works well as it is-there were just some additions of my own.  I recommend it.  Children may need to acquire a taste for it, however.

Really enjoyed this. FYI ..The recipe doesn't make enough for 6 unless they are small portions.UPDATE and TIP: I put the onions in the food chopper and sauteed for longer than 5 minutes. Making them really soft helps with the texture.

Follow the directions as stated except I used canned mixed gourmet mushrooms...and dumped some black eyed peas in.  Should have left the peas out.  My rating is for how it would have been without the peas.

This was very tasty!  I didn't really do anything different with this recipe except used only 8 oz. mushrooms and not nearly 2 c. onions.  Also, there is another recipe for Hungarian Mushroom soup on this site that says to add 1/2 a ripe tomato to the soup after you add the cream (then you discard it before serving).  I did this, I don't know if it added any flavor or not.  This soup was tasty and I will be making it again.  I didn't find that it was too thick at all.  Next time I will use only 1 t. dill as I thought 2 t. was waaaay too much.  Also, next time I will use dried parsley and use only 1 or 2 T.  Some people in my family aren't big sour cream fans so I didn't mix the sour cream into the whole pot of soup, but rather mixed a spoonful into the individual bowls for those who wanted it.  This one is a keeper!

I like it. I don't love it. A little too salty for me and I'd have really liked more dill. Still, it does make a decent bowl of soup and I'm pretty sure with some minor tweaking it'll be even better.

This was so, so, so good! I used shallots instead of onion. After reading reviews, I saw that some people didn't like the lemon and sour cream, so I added just a touch to a small serving before I added it to the whole batch. I'm glad I did, because I very much preferred it without them. I'm not sure if I messed with the authenticity, but if I'd made it with the lemon and sour cream, I'd never make it again, so that's a good thing! I'm craving it right now...

I thought this was quite good, but my husband didn't really like it.  He couldn't put his finger on what it was, just "something was too overpowering".  I followed the recipe exactly except subbed dried parsley for fresh(it was all I had).  I will make this again, but maybe for a day he wont be home for lunch!

Oh my...this is absolutely fabulous.  Just like the Panerra Mushroom Soup, as someone else noted.  Very easy to make, and great as main dish served with French Bread.  Based on everyone's feedback, here is what I can add:
*Used skim milk and light sour cream, low fat chick broth, and it was still velvety rich.  You don't need those extra calories at all.*Used Baby Portabellas. *Cut dill and lemon juice in half.  My 10 year old daugher even loved...just had the rich broth without the mushrooms.

A great recipe but it really needs a side of bread, being so rich.  It tastes a bit like liquified stroganoff.

Make this soup!!!! Terrific. Pure and simple. I was looking for a mushroom soup to make for dinner tonight and was intriqued by the ingredients. Simple to make and the results were outstanding. I followed the recipe to the letter and didn't make any changes. Very filling. Served with French bread.

It's been about ten years since I made this recipe, and when I remembered it I decided to make it again to see if it held up to my fond memories. The soup was as delicious as I remembered; very complex flavors and simple enough to make. The only modification I made this time around was partially pureeing the soup with a handheld blender, as another reviewer suggests. I prefer the smoother texture and would probably do the same next time...which hopefully won't be so long as ten years!

This soup is delicious in a very strange way.  I never would have thought to combine dill and mushrooms, but the results are great.  My whole family liked it, too, which is always so nice.

EXCELLENT SOUP! I added a half chopped green bell pepper when sauteing the onions/mushrooms and when I added the broth, I added some cubed deli turkey as previous reviewers suggested. Although very good and easy to make, next time, I'm going to just use mushrooms (and more of them)as directed by the recipe. The mushrooms are what make this meal...not any sort of meat! I am also going to reduce the dill to 1 tsp (just my personal preference).  My boyfriend and daughter didn't have any of this...they like mushrooms but not as the main part of the meal but I will make this again for my mom and I. It was a wonderful and unique soup! Thank you Cathy!!

This delightful soup will warm you from within. I have tried it several times now and it will always have a starring role in my soup repertoire. I agree with those who suggest the lighter sour cream, and I once made it with yoghurt instead. Awesome!

We loved it. Had 1/4 cup heavy cream to use up so i topped the rest with milk to get the cup needed. Also added 1 chicken breast chopped small but even without it , the soup would have tasted devine.

Incredible flavor.  I'm surprised that I was able to whip something so delicious up for a lunch on the fly!  Because I hadn't planned on making this, I had to make do with the following substitutions/omissions:  i only had a half pound of baby Bella mushrooms, in place of dill I used herbes de provance and in lieu of parsley I chopped up some mixed herb salad.   Even with these changes the result was delicious.  Served with some country bread.  I will certainly make this again, although most likely in the colder months... It's hearty!  HAMM, you're a genius

I used about half the onions called for, used 2 tbsp salted butter and 2 tbsp smart balance oil and didn't need to add any other salt.  Added 2 diced cooked chicken breasts to make it more of a meal.  Used dried parsley.  Used whole wheat flour.  It was sooo good, I'd like to give it 4.5 stars (based om 5 stars being the best thing I've ever tasted) but there's no option for that.  I will ABSOLUTELY be making this more in the future!

We loved this soup and I made almost no changes to it except for veggie broth instead of chicken and plain yogurt instead of sour cream and like others suggested I used less parsley but I really love parsley so the other way would have probably been fine with me but my husband is not that crazy about it.  Oh and the tip from one reviewer to use egg slicer to slice the mushrooms was a genius idea, it really did work like a dream.  I will never slice mushrooms with a knife again. Thanks BETTIJOAN.

This recipe is fabulous! I have made this soup at least 5 times, and I cannot believe I haven't commented upon this recipe before now, as it is absolutely excellent! Please read further for some small alterations I made. Firstly, I substituted fresh dill weed - I used 2 tablespoons, at least. (General rule of thumb, when substituting dried herbs for fresh: 1 teaspoon dried herbs = 1 tablespoon fresh.) Secondly, I used homemade chicken stock. For those of you (in the comments section) that were using canned broth, that's alright, but you might want to jazz it up a bit by adding some bouillon for added depth. (I recommend Knorr.) I also added 1 tablespoon of dried turmeric to the broth - everyone liked this addition, and it adds a nice color and more flavor to the final result. I also topped off each bowl of soup with a dollop of sour cream, and garnished with additional chopped fresh dill and fresh parsley. All in all, hats off the author of this recipe! Extremely good - well done!

This is a very earthy soup.  It is so not cream of mushroom soup which I don't care for and why I liked this soup.  I made the recipe as is although putting in that much paprika really was uncomfortable for me.  I don't think it added much except color.  I couldn't taste the dill either and I may add more next time.  I think I'd prefer the mushrooms chopped in little bits instead of sliced.  Overall my husband and I were pleased with the soup and I will make it again.

WOW!  I halved the recipe and ate it all before my husband even made it home... Used regular mushrooms & low fat half and half instead of milk.  Put the sour cream on top & mixed into each bowl.  Little bit too much paprika - decrease by 1/3 & try with different mushrooms.

Excellent!! I used crimini mushrooms, adding 1/4 cup of white wine while sautéing. Not having any fresh parsley, I added dried to the mix for the last 5 minutes of the simmering to make sure it had hydrated. My milk was sour, so I used heavy cream. Otherwise (ha ha) I followed the recipe. Regardless, it was wonderful. I'll be making this a lot. Thanks HAMM!

Very yummy. I am eating the soup as I write this. I did make a few changes however; I did not have any dill weed so used dill seed instead, had no parsley but did have cilantro so used that. One of the reviews suggested usinf half and half which I did. All in all a wonderful recipe. Thanks so much for it.

Very good soup.  I followed recipe exactly, except I substituted vegetable broth instead of the chicken broth (my husband only eats kosher and can't mix meat and dairy).  Soup was rich and delicious and even my 2 year old son ate it with relish.

Fabulous soup! I made this as directed (but with low-sodium chicken broth and low-fat sour cream) and it came out very tasty with a very nuanced flavor. This is the type of dish I would serve guests.

I used both baby bella and shiitake mushrooms, but I think next time I'll just use baby bella.

I was disappointed by this soup. I followed the recipe exactly except I threw in some shredded cooked chicken in the end to make it a full meal.  I think the soy sauce and lemon is what gave it a weird flavor.

Beautiful Soup and tastes delicious.  Only minor changes.  I used 1.5 tsp of dill.  And instead of milk, I used low fat evaporated milk.  My sour cream was fat free or low fat, not sure which.  I also only had dried parsley.  It did take a bit of time, but nothing difficult.  The end result was well worth it.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!!  I left out the dill because we don't have any (and I hate it anyway) and used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.   It was absolutely DELICIOUS!   I'll make this again and again and again.   I used baby portobello mushrooms, in case anybody's trying to decide which kind to use. :)

Husband said this was the best soup I've ever made! Super simple, but flavorful ingredients. Used fat free half-and-half in lieu of milk, mushroom broth in lieu of chicken stock, and dolloped Greek yogurt on the servings rather than stir sour cram in the whole batch. Also, did a quick pulse with my immersion blender to break up some of the mushrooms. Superb.

This soup was amazing! I have been looking for a great mushroom soup for my husband. He's been in love with this wild mushroom soup he had in carbondale years ago and the restaurant had been closed down the last time we visited. Since then I had been on the hunt for not only one that matched but one that wouldn't stop your heart with all the cream. This one was perfect!! HE loves it!! I only made had two changes.... I didn't have any dill so used some fresh thyme instead and I used two cloves of fresh garlic when the mushrooms went in. THe lemon and soy sauce really gave it that extra dimension.  Next time I am definitely using the dill!! 
 Thank you for the recipe!!!

I really enjoyed this soup.  The only thing I changed was to add some garlic and red wine, as for some reason, it was a bit bland.  Also found it a bit too thick, but that's minor.

When you want to bribe somebody cook them this soup ;) you will get what you want when you make them a pot of this, its like a secret weapon in the kitchen! Use cream not milk and they will melt at your feet;) Even mushroom haters will gobble it up!  *Tip if you are cooking for a mushroom hater chop the mushrooms small. Amazing flavors!

Delicious!  Only thing I did different was used Fat Free Half & half and light sour cream. Hubby loved it and I did too!  I think next time I make this I'll add a bit of fresh garlic when the onions are sweating and I might cut back a wee bit on the dill, although it was not overpowering.

Delicious! Didn't change a thing. We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this soup. Very rich & creamy, great mushroom flavor, and all the ingredients blend wonderfully -- savory, sweet, & tangy. Do not leave anything out. Thank you SO much for this recipe! It is a keeper & a definite repeater! :)

This was easily the best soup I have ever made. I forgot to pick up fresh parsley so I used dried instead.  It still tasted great and I will definitely be making it again.

Not like this recipe needs another glowing review, but here it is anyway. This soup is OUTSTANDING! I even goofed up and dumped in a can of beef broth instead of chicken and it is still excellent. (Look forward to trying it the right way). My idiocy aside, I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. Thank you for sharing this with us!

I halved this recipe as I only had 8 oz of mushrooms.  I thought it was kind of thick, until after eating it, I realized I didn't add the lemon juice, parsley, or sour cream.  Soup had good flavor.

I have to admit, I had my worries about this recipe as I'm not a huge soy sauce fan. I was very pleased with how this turned out; it was delicious! To make it a little more hearty, I boiled and shredded 2 chicken breasts and added them during the broth step. I also omitted the onions (we aren't fans), added a chopped clove of garlic, and omitted the teaspoon of salt. I think the parsley really *made* this soup, so don't skip it! :) Thank you very much!

SO GOOD!!!  I had to change it up a bit due to what i had in the house. I didn't have any sour cream so i followed all the other directions and subsituted a little evaporated milk and a drop of sherry for the sour cream, it turned out great. This soup really does give the warmth and heartiness of eastern european cooking...delish! I can't wait to make this again, i'm thinking subbing creme fraiche for the sour cream will give it an even more authentic euro flavor.

Delicious!  I used whole milk but I think it might actually taste better with 1%.  I do NOT recommend adding any extra salt and maybe a bit less dill, just a bit less.  It tastes hearty and sinful but is very healthy and is great for a stand-alone soup.  Though if you happen to throw a fillet mignon under this soup, you won't be disappointed!

Sorry, I really thought I would enjoy this, but all I could taste was parsley. It was also a very strange muddy color, not very tempting. I followed the recipe, did not substitute any ingredients, so I'm not sure how so many others rated it five stars when it came out like it did.

Divine.  Followed the recipe to a "T".  It says six servings, but those are one-cup, appetizer-sized servings.  If you want bigger bowl-fuls, you'll need to double the recipe.

This is a wonderful soup. I ate it just by its self, put it ovew noodles and also turned it into Beef Stroganoff by adding beef and 1 cup of sour cream and cooked it with the beef in the crock pot. I added the cup of sour cream just before serving. It was a big hit at my house.

The rich, unique flavor makes this soup one of my very favorites.  I buy pre-sliced shitake, oyster, portabello and button mushrooms at the grocer.  Rather than waste some, I end up putting in about 2 cups more mushroom than is called for.  I also run about 1/3  of the finished soup through the blender.  Between these two changes, I end up with a thicker soup which is generally how I prefer soup.  I have people add their preferred amount of sour cream directly to their bowl so that they can personalize the soup to taste.  Unlike some cream of mushroom soups, this soup's primary flavor is mushroom!  I could rave for days but I'd better save some writing space for the next folks...

This recipe is a winner - it even made it on the "Favorites" list (which is a hard thing to do!!). What a weird combination of flavors, but somehow it works just great together. I also recommend slicing the mushrooms pretty thin and sauteeing them a bit longer. Otherwise, it was perfect!!

Excellent!  I am Hungarian, and I think even my Dad would have loved this.  I added extra mushrooms (I used baby bellas). I also used half spicy and half mild paprika, because I like a little heat.  Otherwise I followed as is.

This is an amazing soup.  I doubled the mushrooms and added more broth.  I kept adding paprika, lemon juice and dill as I like a more robust soup.  Very, very good.  The true test is when I take some to my mom later today.

OMG. I just died and went to heaven. That is all I can say about this recipe. I followed it to a tee except I put in just a tad less of the dill weed. I just wasn't sure about it and knew I could add more later. I didn't. What prompted this was a visit to a deli in town this week. They had mushroom soup as the soup of the day. I saw a man eating it and it looked yummy. I got some and this recipe is very close to it. VERY CLOSE. Try it, you will not be disappointed.

This soup rivals any mushroom soup I have ever tried.  I added cooked long-grain & wild rice.  If you do this you may want to bump up the chicken broth a bit.

Very good soup.  Much like a rich cream of mushroom.  I used various types of mushrooms to add variety and it turned out great.

My family (including my 6 year old) really enjoyed this soup, in spite of the fact that I got to the end of the recipe and realized that I didn't have any sour cream, but it still was amazing!!! I also took the advise of others and  only used half of what the recipe called for of the dill and paprika.  Great comfort food. Thanx!!

If you love mushrooms and you love soup, this recipe is for you.  It is truly superb!! The most time consuming part is slicing the mushrooms and onions.  It will certainly be one that I will make frequently

This soup is AMAZING!! I've made it quite a few times since finding the recipe earlier this year. A lot of people are saying that they used less dill, less lemon, or less parsley, but I think that this is perfect without taking anything away. But, when I first tried this recipe, I was experimenting with vegetarianism and needed something filling so I added potatoes and it was so good, I've done so ever since. I'm making this again tonight and I can't wait! This is my favorite recipe so far!!

Amazing mushroom soup.  I used real Hungarian hot paprika - it gave it a bit of kick and reminded me of the flavors I so much enjoyed while living in Budapest.

This is an incredible recipe. I took previous advice and cut the parsley back to 1/8 cup and it was perfect; additionally I added 5 slices of cooked, chopped bacon and 1/2 tsp of red chili flakes.  I cooked up the soup and treated it more like a curry by putting it over white rice & a piece of tilapia pan fried in oil, more onion, parsley, garlic & lemon. It was fantastic & my fish-disliking husband loved it too! I attribute that to the wonderful soup base.  Fantastic soup!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and my husband and I loved it- except for one thing. The parsley. Maybe I didn't chop it well enough but you'd get a bit of the parsley and it wasn't good. Next time we make this I'll either leave out the parsley altogether or chop it extremely fine. All in all though this recipe was very delicious and we will be making it again!

Since I am a vegetarian, I used vegetable broth in lieu of chicken broth (meat broths are over-rated). I  have made this two times already, following the recipe to the "T", but using all organic ingredients.  It is so satisfying, and excellent as a meal in itself with crusty bread, especially on rainy days, or cold winter days. I slice up vegan polish sausage in for protein.  I have saved this recipe and will make it often for work lunch, or light dinners.

I don't know why I'm just now getting around to reviewing this recipe---I've made this soup many times over the years with great success.  Chocked full of fresh mushrooms, this soup has extremely well-balanced flavors and is very satisfying.  The only thing I do differently is to add one small carrot, minced, to the chopped onions while they're sautéing (I had the soup this way once at an upscale restaurant).  Doing this seems to add a little sweetness.  I will continue to make this very authentic recipe for years to come.

This was a great soup.  I added some white wine after the chicken broth simmered, before I added the milk. It was a great find!

This soup was fantastic!!!  This recipe was very easy and very good.  It's the best mushroom soup I've ever had!!! After reading several of the reviews, I used 1 tablespoon of fresh dill, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of dried parsley and used half and half in place of the milk.  I also used a "medley" of mushrooms: baby bella, shitaki, and the button mushrooms.  My husband also said it was the best that he ever had!  This is a keeper, I will definitely be making this again!!!

I just finished making this soup.I made it identical to the recipe.It is excellent.I used fresh dill instead which made it a little more dilly but it is still good.Let soup cool a bit before adding the sour cream or it will curdle a little.I dont even think it needed the sour cream.Very simple to make being you made it in steps as you go.No rushing around.This recipe gets to go on a recipe card in my box.Good job!!  Be careful on the dill folks! I used a little too much my first time making it and it just about overpowered the other ingredients. Still excellent though.

This soup is delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used FRESH dill, and I added it with the parsley and sour cream.  I implore everyone to do the same!  Dried dill tastes like grass and not like dill at all.  Fresh dill absolutely makes this soup! For Pete's sake, instead of buying a bottle of dried dill, just buy a bunch of fresh, and freeze the rest for when you need it next.  Then just chop it up while still frozen, and add to your dish.  No need to defrost!

EXCELLENT!  I have never tasted anything quite like it.  It worked well with these substitutions:  Almond milk (for Dairy milk) and vegetable broth (for chicken broth)and Labne (for sour creme).  I put the almond milk, lemon juice, and labne in the blender and added about 2 ladles of soup to the mix and blended to give the broth more body.  I will make this again and again!

Although not very quick, this was a fairly simple recipe.  Other than the mushrooms, I had everything on hand and was able to throw it all together.  I did not have unsalted butter so I just used salted butter and omitted the extra salt.  I also added in some garlic, but I tend to do that with pretty much all of my recipes.  My husband and I enjoyed this soup with some chicken salad sandwiches.

I love mushroom soup and I was hoping to be floored by this recipe based on the reviews. It was not bad but it was not great either. I was hoping for a bolder flavor. It also puzzled me that some were afraid that using salted (vs unsalted) butter + soy sauce + salt will make this soup salty. If you're watching your salt intake for health reasons, then yes, I understand the concern. I myself need to be concerned about my salt consumption but using those 3 ingredients I mentioned was not enough for my taste buds. In fact, I doubled my soy sauce, added more salt while cooking and even more salt in my bowl. I think the the lemon, the sour cream and the parsley pretty much evened it out. That being said, I still suggest following the recipe as close as possible and just tweak it as you go to suit your taste. I believe too little salt is better than too much of it. If it's too little, you can always add more on the table.

Made this as written, and it’s a very flavorful and healthy soup. Yes, you could alter a few ingredients to make it a bit healthier but you may give up on flavor. I agree with other reviewers that this is an excellent base, and can be easily customized for individual taste preferences. We will make this again.

This was fabulous! Rich and creamy and very flavorful. It's amazing with fresh mushrooms, but if you're in a pinch, as I was, canned mushrooms can also work. I added an additional cup of broth and half a cup of milk to stretch it and it was still plenty rich. No need for salt with the soy sauce and chicken broth. Thanks for a winner.

DE. LISH.  Wow, what a classy, elegant soup (if you can call soup those things...).  I made the recipe as instructed EXCEPT I only had salted butter, beef broth, and dried parsley (used 2 tsp) on hand.  I should have left that tsp of salt out at the end, but it was still wonderful, just a tad bit on the salty side.  I can't wait to make this again with chicken broth and a less salt.  I think that all of the ingredients worked together well; the amount of dill and lemon was fine for me.  Next time, I may add a little garlic to the onions and use different mushrooms.  Honestly, I could have eaten the whole thing by myself, but I held back.  I have some left for tomorrow.  I am anxious to see how it tastes the next day.  I am glad that no one in my house is a fan on mushrooms!

This will be my go to soup when I want mushroom soup for any reason. I over did the paprika and my soup was redder then most the pictures I looked at even still it was so good. Easy to make taking very little time to complete.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I eyeballed the parsley and probably ended up doubling it. I still didn't find it overwhelming, though, as other reviewers did. I also thought the amount of paprika was fine. I used "regular" paprika (it wasn't labeled as "sweet" or "hot" or "Hungarian" or anything else), and I thought it was fine, but I could see how good Hungarian paprika would make this dish even more amazing. I might go out of my way to get some next time, just for this recipe. The only thing I would do differently is to dice the mushrooms. I guess my mushrooms were on the large side, and the slices were so big they were hard to eat with a spoon.

Definitely not your standard cream of mushroom soup... all the spices and flavors work really good together to give you a delicious soup like no other mushroom soup I have had...

Very tasty, and one of the easiest soup recipes I have ever followed. The only changes I made were sauteing the onions and mushrooms in olive oil instead of butter, substituting vegetable broth for chicken broth, and leaving out the fresh parsley, using two generous shakes of dried parsley shortly after I added the broth instead. I also decided that I wanted a slight tomato flavor to it, so I added about a tablespoon of tomato paste. I recommend at the end that you add the sour cream and one tsp of lemon first, then taste it and decide whether you want the second tsp of lemon, and how much salt and pepper you want to add. Edited to add: The type of mushroom you use makes a difference. I have made this several times now, with different types of mushrooms, and my favorites are shiitake, oyster, and baby bella mushrooms. I didn't really care for it the time I had to use plain white mushrooms.

I was looking for a nice easy and quick lunch.  This was SO good and did the trick!  I used the dried dill, but also used some fresh that I threw in last second.  I was out of fresh parsley, so I used dried.  Yummy soup!

I used different types of mushrooms for interest.  I served this with a dollop of Greek yogurt in the center.  It was delicious and well worth the effort.

I loved this and would have given it 5 stars, but the Parsley really overwhelmed everything else in here. I would say maybe cut it down to a tablespoon, but it's probably better just to take it out altogether.  Otherwise, this was a GREAT soup.

Man, this stuff is good! Just little changes due to availabilities such as half milk and half whipping cream & no parsley. I don't think I miss the parsley at all and since I used whipping cream to it, I omitted the flour. I also used hungarian paprika because it needed to be used.

This soup just rocks!  I didnt have any sour cream and it was still awesome!  I chopped my onions in the food processor so they were more like "ground". I also used Hungarian paprika then added an extra tsp of hot Hungarian paprika to give it some kick. Can't wait to make it again!

I used one can of chicken broth and just one tsp of lemon juice.  This soup was soooo good! I even used skim and fat free sour cream and it was still rich.  I might try vegetable broth next time so its vegetarian, but this was the best mushroom soup I've made!

I made this recipe twice before writing my review. The first time I made with the exact ingredients on the list. I found this a little bland. The second time I made it I added white wine to the sauted the onions, and let that reduce to half. Then I added garlic powder with the other dry ingredient. In the last step, I added hot sauce to the soup for a little kick. There was still something missing so I will continue to work with this recipe because it is such a great mushroom soup base. Thanks!

A wonderful complex flavor! I won a mushroom-themed cookoff at work with this recipe, thanks HAMM! Make sure you are using a pretty large pot, because the 1 lb of mushrooms makes over 8 cups when sliced. As many others, I used a combination of white, crimini, porcini and oyster mushrooms. I left the parsley and sour cream (subbed greek yogurt) on the side for people to garnish their own.

Verry yummy, but could maybe use just a bit more flavoring...maybe beef broth instead of chicken.

Fantastic soup! Very delicate flavors balance out nicely. I was looking for a soup that featured mushrooms and this was perfect. I made a few minor changes. I added 1/2 cup of half & half to the 1 cup of milk since I was using 1% milk, and I added a bit of dry white wine... maybe 1/2 cup or so. I also used 3 types of mushrooms, oyster, shiitake, and crimini, but since the recipe does not specify, that may not be considered a change. I can't wait to have the leftover soup tonight as a starter for grilled ribeye! Yummmm!

Quite possibly the most delicious soup I've ever made! I didn't have sour cream on hand, so I used heavy cream instead of milk to help with the creaminess. It came out great and I bet its even better with sour cream. If you love mushrooms, you'll love this soup.

This is popular with all my friends.  My sister alerted me to the recipe.  I finely chop most of the mushrooms in the food processor as I like it to have a thicker texture.

I do believe this is our favorite soup ever (excepting the handed-down family recipe for Tomato Soup)! It is rich in flavor, yet takes under an hour to make. I follow the recipe with minimal changes (use only 1 tsp dill, add 1 tsp minced garlic, and use half and half in place of the milk). This recipe is the closest we've ever found to our all-time favorite Hungarian Mushroom soup at the Moose's Tooth Restaurant in Anchorage, Alaska. Thanks, HAMM, for a fantastic addition to our soup collection.

This soup was fabulous! We followed everything except; we did not use parsely and we used 1 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of paprika (fresh out of of paprika). Splendid flavors, nice spicey kick, delicious!!

Love this recipe!! I serve this over egg noodles and it's delicious, super easy too! I use 2% milk, low fat sour cream and low sodium broth and it still tastes great!! I also love throwing in shiitake and portobello mushrooms for variety.

We really liked this.  Followed recipe as written, though next time (and there will be a next time) I might throw in some white wine or sherry - I think that would take it from very very good to sublime.  I used a mix of portabella, crimeanni (sp?) and shitake.

Interestingly, I first had this soup at the Hanepepe Cafe in Hanepepe, Kauai Hawaii.  I loved it so much, I tried to find out what was in it as I had never heard of it before.  The lady told me paprika and dill.  I thought I could figure it out and make it and lo and behold - here it is on allrecipes.  Fantastic.  I veganized it by using Earth Balance, tofutti sour cream and soy milk.  It's amazing.  It would be hard to make this recipe anything but fabulous.  Loved it.

Yummy and very satisfying.  Lots of wiggle room with this one.  I like a variety of mushrooms.  I add white wine, 1/2 tsp dried cayenne pepper, a tsp lemon juice, a tbsp soy sauce, used 1 1/2 tbsp fresh dill, and reduced the flour to 2 tbsps.  I departed from the procedure in parts.  I don't like that uncooked flour flavor, so I did make a bechamel with the roux and milk while the veggies and broth were simmering and added that to the pot.  For the exact procedure I used, please see my custom recipe.  For me, sour cream is really optional with this dish.  Sometimes I put a dollop in and heat through.  Sometimes I serve it with a spoonful of sour cream in the bowl.  Other times I just plain leave it out.

Easy and so delicious!! Changes: Didn't use dill-don't like it.  Used 1% milk. Used dried parsley and had to throw out my sour cream as it was expired.  Like others suggested, I purchased a mushroom "medley". Soup was awesome!  My only complaint is how little this makes. Was hoping to have leftovers for lunch and to freeze.

This recipe was a surprise!   Very flavorful, so different from the average mushroom soup.   We had some who loved it, and some who did not.   I will keep it on hand for those times when I want something unique.   It is one to be remembered.

This soup was sooooo good! Hubby loved it!  Because I am a 'strong' taster, I cut back a bit on the spices but I'm sure using the full amount of spices will satisfy most people.  Love this soup.

This is really delicious!  I provided the recipe and my husband did the work - it turned out great!  We used button and portabella mushrooms...
Thanks for the great recipe!

This soup is DELICIOUS!! I used two 8 oz. bags of thick cut baby bellas which made the recipe just that easier. What wonderful flavor and texture. I wonder... Do you think you could put some shredded chicken in it for a more hearty soup? I think so! Great recipe.

I liked it well enough, and will make it again.  But I didn't consider it worthy of 4+ stars.   I followed the recipe to the letter, so the recipe I am reviewing is the actual recipe as published.   The basic recipe appealed to me, so after serving, tasting and some experimenting over several batches, I found it better to add the salt and pepper with the onions, and let the onions caramelize slightly, with the salt leeching some of the moisture out.  Using beef broth instead of chicken broth was more to my liking.  I also added 2 Tbsp of dry white wine with the milk and flour, or sometimes deleting the lemon juice and replacing with a 1/4 cup of  white wine.   With my modest revisions, I give the recipe 5 stars.   I'm going to try adding a little tarragon next time.  I think that would complement the recipe's flavor profile nicely.  And maybe a diced tomato?

AMAZING. This is the best soup. The only substitution that I made was using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it! Thanks for sharing the great recipe :)

All I can say is...FABULOUS! Don't be afraid to put in your favorite mushrooms in here. The recipe does NOT specify. Many people have made the mistake in thinking they can only put "button mushrooms in here." BORING! I put in chanterelles and oyster mushrooms and it made a fantastically rich and delicious soup. Also, the chanterelles I had were dried, so I reconstituted them in water before, and they gave the soup a great texture. Keep in mind: The paprika is KEY to making it Hungarian and beautifully colored. I had a great time making and eating this soup, as it was super simple in the end. The only thing that would make it better is instead of adding raw flower, a roux was made for the thickening agent. Try it out for yourself!

This is a great soup.  I did some very minor modifications, but the core of the soup was still predominate.  I will make this again. The dill, soy (used Tamari) and lemon played very well together.

If you are looking for a traditional creamy soup this isn't for you.  I find that kind of soup boring and bland this is earthy and delicious.  So much better than any mushroom soup I have ever had.  I don't mix the flour separately with milk I add it to the mushrooms and onions and then add broth.  I add milk in at the end and don't boil it long it can separate.

Absolutely delicious.  I lightened it up for 
Weight Watchers by substituting yogurt for the sour cream and skim milk for the whole milk.  Hubby not a fan of the parsley.  I would add it after the fact next time.

Very good soup! I used portobello mushrooms and mushroom bouillon (Better Than Bouillon) instead of chicken broth and it turned out great! I think I might try adding a little garlic next time.

Had a great taste but disappointed that all my onions were still hard. I followed the cooking times exact so not sure why they came out hard still. 
I didn't add the lemon juice and used dry parsley.
Maybe I'll add more sour cream next time to make it a bit thicker.

This is the best mushroom soup I've ever had but my boyfriend and I agreed that it was just OK and I probably wouldn't make it again.  The only thing I strayed from on the original recipe was to use reduced fat sour cream and 2% milk.  This soup definitely needed to be creamier.

This was restaurant caliber soup!  I made it exactly as stated except I only had salted butter on hand so I omitted the soy sauce and only used half a teaspoon of salt.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was delicious and so very easy to make!  I used salted butter, and I used coconut milk in place of dairy, and the coconut flavor is a definite plus.  I didn't use fresh parsley, and I didn't use 1/4 of a cup of it; I used greek yogurt in place of sour cream, but I wouldn't recommend that (it turned out great, but sour cream would have blended better); I didn't really measure the onions - just eyeballed it and added as little as I liked; and I omitted the dill weed, flour, and lemon juice.  Even with all of these changes (the most significant being the coconut milk), the recipe is still awesome.

I gave this 5 stars, because I normally hate mushrooms but really enjoyed this soup. I bought "sliced" white mushrooms and "sliced" baby portabellas, but they were thick slices, so I tried to slice them thinner. I also didn't add the lemon juice (didn't have any), cut the parsley in half (may omit it entirely next time, as I didn't like the parsley taste with everything else), and used skim milk, no-fat sour cream, low sodium soy sauce and low sodium low fat chicken broth. Very yummy!

Great soup! Never fails and can have tonnes of additions. I added a few extra veggies: broccoli and asparagus. And also a fair bit of chilli powder to add that extra zing and fresh dill instead of dried.

I made the recipe with couple of minor tweaks and everyone really enjoyed it. Being an Orthodox Jew, I couldn't use chicken broth along with milk so I've used no-chicken broth instead. I also used 1/2 cup of heavy cream along with 1/2 of milk to add more flavor. In addition, I've used lemon pepper spice instead of plain black pepper. All in all, it was very easy to make and I would highly recommend it.

Wow, this soup is legit! My european parents went nuts over it.. it's just like the kind my oma used to make. My only changes were using 12oz of mushrooms (white, baby bella, and crimini), half the butter, and fat free h&h instead of milk. Somehow adding the sour cream at the end takes the soup to a whole new level. Yum

I waited until my mushroom hating hubby was out of town to try this and boy was I glad I did.  I didn't want to share it!  I did double the sour cream just to taste and It was perfect!  Scrumptous!  Delish!!  Will pass on to friends and make often!

I have made this several, several times, and I never get to have leftovers, that's how fast it gets eaten.  I'm not a fan of the dill, so I cut the amount in half.  I actually puree half of the soup before I add in the sour cream.  Fully pureed makes you long for something to chew, and not pureed at all makes the soup seem a tad thin.  I *highly* recommend this.

This recipe is Awesome!  I have made it twice now in the past two weeks.  I used 2 cans of vegetable broth one time.  The next time I used two cans of beef broth.  I love mushrooms and onions so I add extra amounts.  Baby portabellas gave this soup a great texture.

My husband and I simply loved this recipe! He usually doesn't consider soup or stew a meal but he was definitely holding his tummy after this one! Served with blueberry, spinach, walnut and chevre salad and fresh French bread :-)

For changes, I used 2tbs unsalted butter with 2 tbs olive oil for sauteing; I caramelized the onions before adding mushrooms; I used a mixture of white-capped button mushrooms, baby portabella mushrooms, and Asian straw mushrooms for texture and flavor; I added Balsamic vinegar with the low-sodium soy sauce to deglaze the pan a bit and complement the mushrooms and onions; I used veggie broth instead of chicken (1 cup unsalted, 1 cup salted); I added 1 chopped medium-sized russet potato when I added the broth; used skim-milk and a tbs of the new Philadelphia cooking cream; left out the lemon juice (the vinegar added enough acidity) and salt (had enough from other sources); and then served sour cream and yogurt on the side for each to add to their own taste (my husband used the yogurt, I only used a tiny dollop of sour cream).

Also served the following night. Didn't have enough for entire bowls so I served the soup over brown basmati rice and roasted skinned eggplant with a little garlic salt.

Both nights were a hit! The soup was rich, textured and was a bit reminiscent of stroganoff.  I will be making this again very soon. :-9

Oh my gosh!  As if this recipe needs anymore great reviews, but nevertheless, I still feel inclined to add my thoughts...my roommate and I love it!  She said "just the right creaminess", and I used fat free milk!  Also, I did not have fresh basil, so I used dried thyme instead..try it!!!

This is no ordinary mushroom soup.  The unique flavor won over my whole family.  I followed the recipe exactly except I had to sub dried parsley for the fresh.  This is a winner!!

Delicious!  I'll definitely make again.  I love the combination of all the spices; I used low fat sour cream & 1% milk with olive oil instead of butter, & it was delicious.  I also put in a package of reconstituted shitake with the water I used to reconstitute it. I accidently doubled the sour cream, but it was still delicious! The more onions & mushrooms, the better!

Great soup just as is....I put more chicken broth in after everyone had gotten a bowl so adding about 1/2 to 3/4 cups more chicken broth doesnt detract from the flavor in the least. Thank you soooo much for this recipe

This is one of my favorite soups now.  It's nearly perfect as is but I do up the amount of lemon since I like the tangyness it adds.  I use at least the juice of half a lemon if not more and also cut the parsley amount in half.  Love it!

This soup is bursting with flavor. I make a non-dairy version with earth balance in place of the butter, soy milk and no sour cream. I also use whole wheat flour.

This soup is one of the best that I have ever made. I made a few changes to suit my husband's and my taste. I added 3 cloves of crushed garlic in with the onions and I caramalized the onions for a richer and sweeter taste. I also added about 1/3 lb of cooked bacon, I didn't put the salt in as it didn't need it with the bacon and I didn't put any parsley in.

Was absolutely delicious! Followed the directions almost exactly except I didn't have any dill so I used a herb mix and I used 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup water. Was thick and creamy; one of the best soups I've ever had, will definitely make again!

So delicious.  Thank you for sharing this recipe. I made a few changes according to the suggestons of reviewers. They were to use a variety of mushrooms, including reconstituted porcini (including the liquid) I used 1/2 and 1/2 .  Added minced garlic when onions were finished and then added a splash or two of sherry.  I also substituted worcestshire for the soy.  I also doubled the recipe and am glad I did, lol

This is one of my go-to winter soups. It's flavorful, complex, and comforting. I usually add a few red potatoes (and celery and carrots if I have to get rid of them) and this only enhances the flavor. For those who are having problems with the milk/sour cream/lemon curdling once it hits the soup, the soup has to be at a low heat before you add these ingredients. 

Enjoy!

This recipe is great as is.  I've made it with no tweaks and it was one of the best soups I've ever had.    However, as with most recipes I've tweaked it as well.  One time I was craving it and didn't have any soy sauce, so I subbed worchestire instead and it gave it an even richer taste.  I've also used a variety of mushrooms (a combo of crimini, shitaki, baby bella and white) and I've added a splash of red cooking wine and cooking sherry (separate batches) and they also added a richer flavor.  This recipe is a fall staple for me and this year will be trying some other additions like beef chunks or chicken to make it a bit heartier for my picky men who feel if meat isn't part of it it's not a suitable dinner.  Personally with a big hunk of bread this is perfect for me as is.

Don't know why I haven't rated/reviewed this before. Have made it numerous times and really love it. Only changes I've made was to cut down on soy sauce plus use low sodium and use a mix of different fresh & dried mushrooms(when we can afford to buy some of them).

so easy and tasty. I had this soup at a local restaurant, and have been craving it on a regular basis ever since. had some green onions i needed to use up, so shopped those up and added them. used yogurt instead of sour cream to make it a bit healthier. also didn't have unsalted butter, so used regular and jut the additional salt by half.

I tried this recipe since someone said it was better than the russian potato mushroom recipe. Not so. This was more like a mushroom gravy than a soup, and way too salty. I will not make this again. And the russian potato mushroom is my all time favorite soup. Must be personal taste.

This soup was wonderful!  I used 8oz of low fat cream cheese instead of the milk and flour.  No need to thicken and it gave it a rich creamy taste.  We will definitely have this again.

Didn't have sour cream, nor parsley. I added a small dash of dried mint instead. It was very delicious!

This is a very good soup.  I used half and half instead of milk and fat free yogurt instead of sour cream because that is what I had.  I also omitted the salt.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this soup several times.  I follow the recipe as is, except I don't often have sourcream, so I usually use plain yogurt.

Excellent-the only change I made was using only 1 tsp dill, and that seemed to be enough-I also added some pearl barley for fibre - thanks for the recipe-will definately make again

I've made this soup at least half a dozen times and have passed the recipe along to my friends.  There just isn't any other soup like it and the dill makes it special.  I use lowfat milk and skip the sour cream because it is just as delicious without it.  It is also key to use fresh parsely.  The parsely gives it a fresh flavor.

Fabulous, soul-warming soup!  Love it!  It's very filling and is beautiful for the LONG, DARK days of winter!  (and for all other days, too!!)  In my opinion, this does not need any tweeking; make as directed.  Try it!!  You won't be disappointed!!

I just finished the last bowl of this unique soup. I used crimini mushrooms and followed the directions as written. Such simple basic ingredients are used to produce a very delicious dish. There is a pronounced dill flavour which I think is common in Hungarian style cuisine and therefore right in this recipe. I particularly liked the broth thickness. It was not too thick or too thin. This is a soup has a lovely appearance and with its gourmet flavour would be brilliant as a first course at a dinner party for discerning guests. Or do what I did and make it soley for your own enjoyment.

I really liked this soup.  It was tangy, creamy and savory.  I was a bit skeptical when I mixed in all the spices but it all came together.  I used dried mushrooms since I didn't have fresh ones and it certainly made it a meal.  When I make it again I might only use a few, mixed with an assortment of fresh mushrooms.

I don't hand out five-star ratings for everything but this recipe deserves it, hands down. One of the best soups I ever made. I didn't think it had too much dill at all, just the right amount in fact. I floated a thin slice of lemon on top before serving. This soup got rave reviews all the way around the dinner table. I'll definitely make it again.

This was a big hit, but I only gave it 4 because we had to tweak it a bit.  I added some sherry to give the flavor some depth, and a bit more paprika as well.  I would definitely recommend this one, and I will be making it for my eastern European Mother in law who loved it, again.  Thanks for sharing!

Soooo good!!  I had my sister over for lunch, and I served this.  She was very impressed!  This soup is very easy to make and honestly one of the best soups I have ever made.  This is saying something because I love to make and eat soup.  My only substition was I used dried parsley and low fat sour cream. Next time I will double the recipe.  My 18 month old ate half of a bowl (this was after a whole pb&j sandwich!).

This is absolutely one of the most delicious soups I've ever had.  I added a little extra paprika and might use a bit less butter next time, but the combination of flavors is just right.   It reminds me of the Slovak food I grew up on!  
Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Wow!! This was a wonderful soup...creamy and scrumptious!  However, when I make it next time, I will cut the amount of onions in half and double the amount of mushrooms...there were a LOT of onions, and I really like the flavor of mushrooms.  OH, and I used Portabello mushrooms instead of crimini mushrooms...WAY better!! Don't scrimp on your mushrooms, the rich flavor will be y our reward.

Wow!  This rivals the Hungarian Mushroom Soup we used to buy at Three Lions Bakery here in Portland.  The only change I made was to increase the quantity.  I didn't think that three cups of liquid would feed four of us (including two teenage boys), and I was right.  I upped it to about 5 cups, and have just a small bowl left for lunch for tomorrow.  Served with the Ricotta Bread from this website, this made a very good meal for a cool fall evening.  Update:  made this for a soup sale fundraiser, and of the 6 or 8 varieties for sale, this was the only one that sold out.  Not only that, but when we decided to do a second fundraiser, lots of folks asked whether I'd make this one again!  It's easy to make it vegan for those who prefer that, too.

what was wonderful about this recipe was there was hardly anything that wasn't already in my kitchen.  Instead of chicken stock, I used veggie. As well as Soy milk instead of regular. I just ran back to the stove, it's absolutely delicious. :) And I haven't even put in any lemon juice, dill or sour cream.

Wonderful soup!  I hate mushroom soup (canned COM is only used as gravy for pork chops!), but this was just delicious.  I used a mixture of white and baby bellas, but all white would be good too.  Reheated well too.

This is the best soup.  I have made it lowcal by using non-stick cooking spray instead of butter, non-fat milk and omitting the sourcream and it is still fantastic and very weight watcher friendly.  I also vary the types of mushrooms if I want.  I live on this soup!!!

This is by far my favorite mushroom soup recipe.  The blend of complimenting flavors makes this a true favorite amongst family and friends.

Being a bachelor northern Wisconsin woodsman I use use dried morels picked in the spring and canned honey mushrooms gathered in the fall.  If you don't have access to wild honey mushrooms a great substitute is commercially available dried oyster shrooms.

The only things I've changed off the posted recipe is that I use no fat milk, reduced fat sour cream and add 1/2 cup of a heavy sweet red wine.

This soup is wonderful accompanied with brazed venison, whole berry cranberry sauce and spatzle.

Delicious.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, margarine instead of butter, 1/2 cremini mushrooms 1/2 button mushrooms and italian seasoning instead of dill (I didn't have any dill).  It was easy to prepare and came out perfectly.  I didn't have any problems with consistency. Update: I've made this several times with the changes and my husband always asks me to make it again.

I love this soup, have made it many times.  It's as good as any mushroom soup I've had in Hungary.  I use vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and add some additional extra-flavourful Hungarian paprika.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was good, but not great.  I decreased dill to 1.5 teaspoons, but I think I'll cut back further if I make it again as we found the dill taste quite strong.  I also left the mushrooms in slices and I think in the future I'd finely chop at least half of the mushrooms.  Overall, it was good but nothing to brag about.  Let's put it this way:  my husband and I aren't fighting over who gets to eat the leftovers.  But, it was certainly a recipe worth trying and I think it'd be pretty good with less dill.  Thanks!

This soup was fantastic!!!  I used country crock butter and whole milk.  When I make it again, I will cut the dill down a bit (too overpowering for my wife).  Overall it was great, I have already passed it along to other family members to try.  Great Job!!!

Excellent! It's nothing like the regular cream of mushroom soups you buy at the supermarket. Unless you don't like mushrooms, you should try this.

Wow! This soup is delicious. I scaled it down to make just two servings and it was great. I followed the recipe, but added two cloves of garlic with the mushrooms, I can't get enough garlic. I had to skip the parsley because I didn't have any fresh and I didn't want to add dried at the end. It didn't seem to matter. The soup was very flavorful. I might try mixing a few different kinds of mushrooms next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It is a keeper.

Awesome!  I did make a few changes, but I believe that the soup would be fantastic prepared as the recipe states.  I used 1/2 pound of white button mushrooms, 6 dried shiitake mushrooms and 1 ounce of dried porcini mushrooms.  I soaked the dried mushrooms before chopping and I added the liquid from reconstituting the dried mushrooms at the same time as the broth was added.  I also used margarine instead of butter, and I used plain lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream.  Delicious!  Will definitely make this again as the cold weather sets in!

I love mushrooms and I love this soup! I pureed it after the final step and did an excellent job melding the flavors and made for consistent flavor and consistency in every bite.

My husband and I love this recipe!!!! We have made it several times since trying it the first time since it is so delicious!  It reminds me of those delicious stewed mushrooms I have sometimes gotten at fairs, with a more creamy base.  We followed the directions except adding more mushrooms - 1 package button mushroom and 1 package cremini mushrooms.  Also used vegetable broth and guar gum instead of flour for a thickener.  It is a definite keeper!!

This is the best mushroom soup ever! The only change I make is to use vegetable broth instead of chicken as I am a vegetarian. I made this for a soup supper at church once, and was inundated by requests for the recipe. I am always asked to make this for the soup suppers, and people actually show up just to get some. I finally put the recipe in our newsletter for all those who asked ( referring it to allrecipes, of course)!

This was excellent! I actually used 2 pounds of mushrooms as I like a chunky soup. I used 2 portabellos and the rest button mushrooms. I'm on South Beach so used skim milk and no fat sour cream and it turned out great!!
For those who don't like to slice mushrooms you can use an egg slicer and cut the mushrooms once vertically then once horizontally and it is really fast.

This was a surprisingly good soup.  I wasn't sure about the dill, but it and the paprika combine to make a unique taste.  I sliced the mushrooms extra-thick to make it a little chunkier, and they could have used a little longer cooking time, but that's my fault for not testing them before I served the soup.

A local diner serves Hungarian Mushroom Soup as their "featured" soup.  Everyone loves it and raves about the recipe.  This recipe is as good if not better.  (I used button and cremini mushrooms).  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a fabulously delicious recipe!  Definitely gourmet quality but easy to make.  I used a white onion in mine, along with a combination of white button and brown cremini button mushrooms (plus one portobellow).  Instead of mixing in the sour cream, I serve the soup with a dollop of it on top.  The soup was very spicy (perhaps because I had Hungarian paprika) and the sour cream complemented it well.   Yum!  No more canned mushroom soup for me!  Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome soup! Didn't have any fresh lemon or fresh parsley. Doubled the recipe but did not  double the paprika or dill. Added tablespoon and a 1/2 of paprika and two rounded teaspoons of dill and seems to be just right for our taste buds.I also used heavy cream instead of milk for pure creaminess. This is not your typical white cream of mushroom soup but sure is a great twist for something different. The color may throw you off from what you are use to cream of mushroom soup looking like but is definitely delicious! Give it a try!!

My husband loved this recipe. He had Hungarian Mushroom soup while out, and requested I make him some.  I found the recipe here and he said it sounded right, so I went to the market that day and bought the ingredients. It was pretty simple to make (utilizing my food processor- otherwise the chopping would have been time consuming) and it even smelled good to me, even though I don't care for mushrooms at all.  I substituted oil for the butter and made it a little healthier, otherwise it is perfect. I shared the recipe with some friends and they all thought it was wonderful as well.

This soup turned out wonderful, I did add some leftover chicken, maybe 1/2 cup cubed to the stock and it tasted great. Will be making this recipe again. Also I used the required amount of dill and it tasted just fine. Thanks Cathy

All of us loved it... even our mushroom-hating eight year old boy!  It is rich and filling; I'll make it again.  Next time I'll add more flour to the roux, simmer uncovered part of the time, and coat some very lucky penne pasta with it.

Good heavens!! I LOVE THIS SOUP!! My sister use to make this soup from a recipe from a cookbook on bed and breakfast inns but it used too much flour and there would be huge chunks of it in the soup. This recipe is PERFECT!!! My family loves it too. Great job, Cathy T. EVERYONE TRY THIS SOUP!!!

This is not a rating as much as a rant.  As I look through the ratings on this Hungarian Mushroom Soup, I see a rating for 3 stars where the cook changed many of the ingredients or amounts.  Please don't alter the recipe and then give it a lesser review.  That's not helpful to those of us who want to know how the recipe came out when made according to the recipe!

The flavors are so solid, from the moment it hits your mouth to the last swallow.  The paprika adds just enough kick to feel but will not scare anyone away.  I have to double it next time, we have no leftovers - so sad!

Great blend of flavors in this rich, thick soup. You could almost use it for a mushroom/onion  gravy, and make a bread and gravy snack out of it. Followed directions exactly, but halved the recipe, yielding enough for the twp of us to enjoy a nice noon meal on a very cold day. Served it with French rolls cut into sliceds and buttered.

Similar to mine, but I make a roux by sprinkling the flour over the mushrooms while cooking, then add the broth. Hard to mix flour and milk without lumps. I never thought of the dill. Not sure I like the lemon.

Excellent soup.  I used vegtable broth and skim milk instead of chicken broth and whole milk.   Will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

A lot of flavor is  in this soup.  I used 1% milk, no parsley, or sour cream.  It was delicious.  Tastes better than the picture.

This soup is superb.  Changes I made after the first time following the recipe, exactly:  First, I doubled the recipe.  Second, I used half and half instead of milk.  Lastly, in addition to doubling the recipe, as mentioned first, I tripled the amount of mushrooms  used and actually placed an entire pound of mushrooms into the blender with the chicken broth.  These changes made the soup incredibly hearty and extra delicious.  I serve it with pumpernickel rolls.

My new go-to recipe for mushroom soup; the unique flavors are just what I didn't know I was searching for! The only substitutions I made -- because I didn't have what the recipe called for and didn't want to go to the store on thanksgiving eve/day -- I used vegan chicken like broth, crema Mexican, shallots (I needed to get rid of them) and dried parsley, I only used 1T after reading some reviews. All I had on hand were king trumpet and oyster mushrooms. The end result --sheer DELICIOUSNESS!!!! Thank you for sharing; I love my mushrooms and now, thanks to you, I can enjoy my mushrooms a whole new way. Yaaaaaaayyy!!!

I had to modify a bit but overall a pretty good recipe. First and foremost COOK THE MUSHROOMS LONGER! Against my better judgement I followed the directions  to start sautéing the onions first. Start with the mushrooms and cook for a good 10-15 minutes THEN add the onion. If you don't you'll end up with chewy mushrooms that haven't had a chance to release their juicy magic. I also used French onion soup mix in place of broth (only cause I had no broth on hand) However, it was an amazing substitute!even if you don't use this, I would recommend using beef broth opposed to chicken  (much more hearty and pairs well with mushrooms). I also added about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce with the soy sauce, used cilantro in place of parsley, and used half of a lemon squeezed (at least double what it calls for) and it turned out perfect ?

Every time I make it, I have to increase the quantity. This is a great favorite as is. However, it can be made gluten free by substituting the flour for half the amount of corn starch, and using a gluten free soy sauce. Tastes just as good!

I received a bag of multi variety mushrooms and debated what to make. I made the perfect choice. The family loved it! My husband thought it was good enough to be served in a restaurant and all night kept telling me how good it was and when was I going to make it again? And he's not a big mushroom fan! A loaf of crusty bread and this hearty soup was the way to go on a cold winter night.

This was so good!  I followed the recipe exact and there were even heated debates that night about who got the rest of the leftover soup to pack for lunch the next day! (I was the one who packed lunches the night before, so yes, I packed it in my lunch box) :)

This was really good.  An outstanding soup for my winter rotation! (Although I like soup at any time of the year). Next time I will double the recipe. As I was eating this I couldn't help noticing that it tastes like a really great base for beef stroganoff.  So, of course, that's what I made the next day I just thickened it up a bit, added some beef, (I just used ground sirloin), some more black pepper and sour cream and served over egg noodles. Next time I make this I'll save half PRIOR to adding the dill and lemon juice to make beef stroganoff.

I have a very strong positive association with this recipe from my childhood. It is so delicious. Today, I decided to add something to satisfy the meat lovers in my house. I started by cooking 3 strips of bacon and a chicken breast in my soup pot. I removed the chicken when it was cooked, shredded it and drained and chopped the bacon. In the drippings, I then sautéed the onions and mushrooms. I added 2 chopped and peeled potatoes. Because of the extra ingredients, I added extra broth. 
The dill and paprika with the mushrooms smell so good. I served the soup with a fresh loaf of crusty sourdough bread. I really liked this version, but the original recipe is always awesome too.

I wasn't really sure what to expect. I love mushrooms & there aren't very many mushroom soup recipes on this app. The sour cream was a little weird. The soup had a sourish taste to it, not sure if it's the sour cream or lemon juice I'm tasting. I only used 1/2 a teaspoon of salt & pepper. I'll probably make it again & adjust it.

Great! I cooked it for dinner. I wanted to have some protein too and ended with a real fusion dish. I looked for "chinese meatballs" here in allrecipes.com and found a delicious recipe with pork meat (I used beef), ginger and sesame oil. I cooked the meatballs into the soup and had a very complete dish for supper. Hungarian-chinese fusion... great marriage!

I bought some nice mini Portobello mushrooms at the farmers market today and made this delightful soup.  I halved the recipe as I had 1/2 lb of mushrooms and it turned out great!.  I did not have any parsley so added some celery leaves and inner stalks  along with the milk and flour.  Also I used smoked paprika which added a nice dimension to the soup flavor.  I would definitely make this again.

Absolutely a 5 star dish!!!   I only added some dry sherry near the end for a little extra depth of flavor.  3x in the past month.  Costco had chanterelles and that made the best version.  Other times a combo of white and shiitake shrooms.

This recipe was outstanding! I wish now I had doubled the recipe! I was not about to spend over $5 for dill at the grocery store (I am not a huge fan of the flavor of dill and do not use it often anyway) so I tweaked the recipe a bit and used dried basil instead--it was absolutely divine! Adding to my recipe box and will be making again. :)

Love this soup!  I'm made is several times now and have been making the following mods.  My soup always came out thicker then I liked so I increase the chicken broth to 3 cups.  Eliminated the extra salt since it's usually already plenty salty, and also substituted all that parsley with just a tsp of dried parsley.  I think with the increase broth it balances out the lemon juice and dill.

OMG…I’ve made and had some pretty terrific soups before…but this one is simply out of this world!  I made it a week ago and I still can’t get it out of my mind.  The recipe says it makes six servings, I wouldn’t know about that; I had it the night I made it and finished it off the next night.  So by my calculations this recipe only makes two servings, ha-ha!  Can’t wait to make it again, and often!

Absolutely amazing. The only change I made was that I added 3tsp dried parsley flakes because some of the reviewers said there was too much parsley. This worked out well. Otherwise I kept everything the same and it turned out great. One last tip is that it's a good idea in the last step to whisk everything together so it combines completely. Will definitely make again. :)

I chose this recipe because I needed to use up some fresh mushrooms but I didn't have cream or half & half that most cream of mushroom soups call for.
Well, I am so glad I found  this because it is an excellent recipe. The spices and flavorings are spot on. So tasty!
This could be thickened a little more and used as a delicious sauce for steaks, roasts, hamburger steaks, or chicken...or even baked with pork chops.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious.  Very flavorful...Slightly creamy, but not heavy.  The dill and lemon are definitely the stand-out flavors but we didn't think either was too much.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!   I did not have fresh parsley so I added finely chopped kale before adding the milk & flour mixture.  Also, I used smoked paprika for added flavor.

I absolutely think this soup is FABULOUS.  I am NOT a fan of mushrooms...but love this. I do dice the mushroom up to be smaller than other's may.  And I may not even use a whole LB of them.  I love the dill and lemon in this...and the finish with sour cream (or just skip that and add a bit of whole cream).  Superb.

This soup is amazingly good!! For texture, don't think of this as a cream of mushroom soup...it's more of a thai coconut soup texture which I personally love. I lacked some ingredients so I was not able to add the dill weed or the lemon juice and it still came out great! Substitutions I did (again cuz lack of ingredients) instead of paprika, I used Cayenne pepper but only 1/2 of what it called for as it alot spicier. I also did not have parsley so added just a pinch of fresh cilantro. For those who want to make this a main course, I would also sauté thinly sliced cubed chicken breast before adding the chicken broth.  This pairs well with jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth or regular white rice. I will definitely be making this over and over again!

If you love mushrooms you will really love this soup.  Even the children love it.  The only change I have made is to add an entire chicken broth rather than  2 cups.  So yummy.

Yummy.  We all liked it.  I followed the recipe, but did not add the salt and I added some cooked chicked breast to make it more of a meal.  It tastes a lot like the Maggi packet for Jaeger Schnitzel.  It's a dry seasoning packet that you add milk to and serve as sauce for pork or chicken.  I bought some of the packets when I was in Germany and I've found them in a few stores where I live.  Now I can make it from scratch.

I loved this soup!I cut back on the parsley a bit and next time I might try cutting back on the dill just a smidge too. The main reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the servings are off. There is no way this makes 6 servings. I would say 3 to 4 servings tops. I am craving it now!

I made half a batch to try this & it was SUPERB!  I would say this recipe is only 4 servings (as we got 2 from half batch), but perhaps we like big servings.  Used whole milk, butter w/canola and light sour cream and only 6 WW points per serving; another plus for me.  I'm passing this on to friends also.  THANK YOU for such a delicious soup!

This soup has wonderful flavor, the one I made was a bit thick so I had to add more water to it and I think next time I will add cooked barley to it to give it more bite. Otherwise I followed eh recipe to the T using fresh dill. Will be making this again for sure.

I normally HATE mushroom soup (the canned junk ruined me forever), but needed a recipe for a staff soup lunch and found this.

It's super easy, it's customisable (I used vegetable broth instead of chicken for the vegetarians on staff), and pretty well un-screw-up-able. I'm adding this to my Food Studies curriculum!

One thing: I didn't use parsley because I didn't have any. It wasn't missed by anyone.

I love this soup.  I searched for something to make with mushrooms one night as I had several packages that needed to be used.  I started cooking only to find I didn't have all the ingredients lol.  I do that a lot.  Anyways, I didn't have dill weed or lemon juice and only had smoked paprika.  I used the smoked paprika, some of my dill pickles juice (creative, right??), and I had lime juice.  I thought it was excellent as did my guests!  The second time I made sure I had all of the ingredients and still thought it was excellent.  Love this soup and will be making it again and again.

Best new soup recipe added to my collection in a long time.  I have made it both with original full fat and sodium version and with lower fat and sodium.  I like them both but DH just adds more soy and sour cream.  Trying to make soup at least once a week and this helps to add only a veggie soup to our rotation.

I fell in love with the mushroom soup at Panera and searched high and low for a more affordable but still flavorful soup that I could make at home.  This is it!  I have made this soup twice now and I LOVE it!  I made the following changes only because I had to use what I had on hand:  I omitted dill because I didn't have any,used shallots instead of onions, added a 1/3 cup of red wine, and used brown rice flour.  Very good soup that will be a staple for years to come!!

This was fairly simple and and quite good.  I felt the parsley was a bit too much but that may be because I used dehydrated and maybe added too much.  My husband thought something was missing - may add garlic next time.  And there will be a next time.  We love soup and this is a great addition to the rotation.  thanks!

This soup is fantastic for anyone who loves dill! I did have just a few alterations; I only had 12 oz of chicken broth and I added two slices of cooked bacon(crumbled). It was so easy to make and tasted amazing!

To add another voice to the positive reviews, this was absolutely fabulous. Made with veggie broth, but no other change of ingredients. Rather than stirring the  sour cream into the soup, like others I spooned it onto the finished soup at serving, thus eliminating the worry about curdling when reheating. I also sprinkled the minced parsley onto the soup at serving. The only thing I would try next time is to add some dry sherry,  which is wonderful with mushrooms. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Love this recipe written as is.  Third time I mixed it up a bit - cornstarch rather than flour, sherry rather than lemon juice and Greek yogurt rather than sour cream.  Great with Baby Bella's!!

This is one Easy, Flavorful soup. We always double it. Have given two neighbors some and they want the recipe. AWESOME!
I eat Atkins most of the time, Very low carb. (I use heavy cream instead of milk) Soo good!

This was good; we didn't think it was awesome, and we're mushroom lovers. I think the texture would have been better if I chopped the mushrooms, not just sliced them. Ate with bread--yum! Oh, and I'll reduce the dill a little, too.

This soup is fantastic! Minor tweaks, sautéed the onions and mushrooms a little longer and blended some of the soup prior to adding the sour cream.

Fantastic recipe. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of flavour in this soup. It tasted hearty and rich, even with some low sodium, low fat options swapped in. I followed this -almost- to a "T". The ingredients were essentially the same, but I swapped in the following due to my own dietary restrictions:

* soy sauce replaced with low sodium soy sauce
* chicken broth of choice was an organic, low sodium broth (Imagine Organics)
* milk choice was skim milk
* all-purpose white flour was traded out for whole wheat flour
* I only used a pinch of salt, during the mushroom sauteing process to help them release some of their liquid
* I used 2 Tbsp of dried parsley as I had no fresh parsley around
* and finally, I used fat free sour cream

After all that, the nutritional values for 1 cup of soup worked out to about:

183 calories, 19g carbs, 11g fat, 5g protein, 343mg sodium, 6g sugars

(Values figured out via MyFitnessPal.com)

The only thing I found 'off' with it is that this recipe says it makes 6 servings, but to me, a serving is a cup of soup, so I actually only got 5 cups out of it.

All told, I LOVE this recipe and will be adding it to my regular repertoire. The dill was stronger than expected, but very pleasant.  I served 1 cup of the soup over 1/4 cup of cooked whole wheat no yolk egg noodles to round out the meal. Next time, I might also pair it with a side salad to fill out the meal a bit more completely. Thanks to the original poster for it!

OMG! This is the Best Soup! I used a mixture of crimini and white mushrooms- the texture with the bits of mushroom are wonderful. I've made this a couple of times once as specified and then I've used my immersion blender (because my husband hates mushrooms- and he loved it, I enjoyed it with the texture thought better.  I added a bit more Dill as I love Dill (I actually use Pampered Chef dill mix with has garlic too)! Such a devine comfort food- I enjoy making this and sharing some to my extended family- reheats well. Great with some sourdough bread YUmmy... Thanks for sharing!

Amazing that such a disparate cast of flavors could come together to produce such a delicious soup.  Terrific!  Bumped up the paprika and lemon juice and used only 1 T of fresh dill and it came out just wonderfully!  This is going into the permanent rotation.  Feel free to serve the sour cream as a dollop on the top of each bowl as opposed to incorporating it into the soup pot.  Served it with crusty bread.

Excellent!   Made this last night and what a hit!  it was slightly thicker than we like so I simply added an extra 1/2 cup of waater and 1/2 cup of milk just before serving.  I also didn't have any sour cream, but It was delicious anyway.  I will certainly make it again.

Yum!  Yum!  Followed precisely as written except did not add the tsp. of salt.  Thought the soy sauce covered that well enough.  Has a surprisingly rich flavor.

Great recipe! I skipped the salt and the sour cream, used veggie stock, and forgot to buy dillweed, so I wasn't 100% faithful, but it still turned out pretty well.

Super easy in a pinch and very good.  I did add some Marsala Wine to it, maybe a 1/2 cup and used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream & put in about half the parsley it called for.  My husband loved it.

This is one of the best mushroom soups I've ever had. I did use my home made vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Followed the directions to a tee except I added in the fresh parsley with the milk and let is simmer with that instead of at the end. This soup has such a wonderful flavor and was great for a late night dinner, so easy to prepare. I used low fat milk and light Daisy sour cream, and low sodium soy. A nice healthy soup. Perfect amount for the three of us, and not one drop left. Will be making this one again.

i made this mostly as written -- added extra mushrooms and a couple large grated carrots for a little color, and skipped the parsley because i didn't have any (tho i thought i did).  used veggie broth.  processed 2 cups into chunky bits.  this tastes like mushroom soup, but has much better texture/consistency.  for those complaining about the dill/lemon juice -- this is very reminiscent of my time in eastern europe... adding sour cream on top at the end is a MUST.

I've made this recipe soooo many times.  It's become one of those 'Gotta make dinner after work..don't wanna try anything new...I know everyone loves this' type of meals in my home.  And my friends that I shared the recipe with agree.  It is just right.  And this is coming from a woman who was raised on Polish soups.  It's easy to adjust the sodium in it.  I've made it with beef, chicken, and veggie broth and also with bouillon.  I've used greek yogurt to substitute the sour cream.  I've used dried parsley.  Always great.  The one thing I will recommend is that you at least double the recipe because you're going to want to bring it to work for lunch the next day!

The soup was fantastic! I cut the mushrooms into quarters since they were a bit smaller than usual so that their taste and crisp can be distinct. I also added an extra dash of milk of what's on the recipe and used only fresh chopped dill instead of parsley. I substituted the sour cream with strained yoghurt (a Greek twist as I am from Cyprus) and also used vegetable stock, which made the soup vegetarian! Totally worth trying, will definitely do it again!

Fabulous flavor! My husband just rolled his eyes with pleasure.  This soup brought back memories of a delicious cream of mushroom soup we had on the Rhine Falls in Lucerne, Switzerland during our college days.  I have been searching for a recipe close to that glorious soup for 30 years.  This is it!  ~  I only put in 1/2 t. of salt instead of 1 t. and it was just right. I also used the darker mushroom package offered at Costco, rather than the regular white button mushrooms for more intense mushroom flavor.  Delicious!!

Tasty soup! I chopped the mushrooms up like what some reviewers mentioned which I think made it thicker which is what I prefer. Filling soup though - don't need much to get full on.

this is a wonderful recipe--restaurant quality.  added a splash of sherry after tasting it.  otherwise no ingredient changes.  used a stick blender to make it a chunky texture.  my husband and mother loved it--the kids enjoyed helping to prepare it but wouldn't eat it.

I've never tasted anything similar to this before but I love mushrooms and onions and the thought of them with all the other ingredients sounded delicious so I gave it a go. I'm one of those who thought the dill was too much, like it over-powered the whole soup. I will make it again but only use 1 tsp of the dried dill weed; I'm hoping I like it much better that way!

My first review! This soup was great! I made it Vegan by skipping butter (slowly cook onions) and using Vegetarian broth. Replaced dairy milk with almond milk (not sweetened). I didn't have sour cream, but this was fabulous without it. I used white and cremini mushrooms! My husband and I ate the whole thing in one meal with salad. Definitely good enough to serve guests!

Definitely and "acquired" taste.  After a few spoonfuls, it was easier to eat and more fulfilling.

This soup is so hearty and flavorful. Even my boyfriend who doesn't like mushrooms LOVE'S this soup. I did add more mushrooms than the recipe called for but not necessary. It's fun to try different types of mushrooms for different favors.

Delicious!! The only addition I made was to add some wine, as I do with many of the soups I prepare. I did not think that there was too much parsley, as a poster stated; this is a personal preference issue. We (family) have soups often, as a main entree. Because of this, we had just enough for three servings. If you are planning the same, double the recipe. This is the best mushroom soup recipe I have ever tried!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I didn't add the sour cream, it was great without it!  I might try cutting out a little bit of butter next time, to save on fat.  It seemed like an odd combination at first, but man does it come together well.

My husband and I thought this recipe was wonderful.  I cooked the onions and mushrooms in coconut oil (trying to avoid butter and cook healthier), which seemed to make it a little sweet.  I also doubled the amount of mushrooms since I love them.  I used about a tbsp of dried parsley because I didn't have fresh and I thought it was perfect.  Thanks so much.  I'll be making this again.

Very Good.  Added a little extra broth.  Cooked all day, but added sour cream near the end.  Took a while for sour cream to mix in.  Next time add some of the soup to the sour cream, mix and then add to pot.

Good, but very rich - I used 1 Tbsp dried Italian parsley, which was enough, & homemade turkey soup stock instead of chicken broth.  2nd day was better than the 1st.

VERY tasty soup. It's on the heavy side (in keeping with traditional Hungarian soup) so we cut down with lowfat sour cream, fat free broth, and skimmed milk. For our tastes, we could probably cut down a bit on the butter as well. Again, this is just a personal taste thing, rather than an issue with the recipe. We used a mix of maitake, oyster and beech mushrooms, which was absolutely spectacular.  Highly recommend, as the mix of flavor is brilliant and it is a very doable recipe.

This soup was amazing.  I used fat free evaporated milk (the entire can, added a little extra flour) and fat free sour cream.  The result was rich beyond expectations.  A delightful soup that I will make again.

I just got done making this and it was really easy and the flavor was wonderful.  I did heed the warning about the parsley so only used enough to lightly dust the top of the soup.  I used a hot hungarian paprika, so I didn't use the pepper or the salt.  It came out perfect.

This soup is so good!  I only made one small change, doubling the mushrooms. Texture wise, I didn't like having the big pieces of mushroom to chew. I think next time I would like to chop the mushrooms into really small bits.

This soup was delicious and simple to make. I followed the recipe as it is seeing this was my first try, but honestly it doesn't need much else. For my own personal taste I would use a little less parsley and a little more dill (because I love dill). Again, that is my personal preference. My boyfriend really enjoyed it. He had seconds and I will definitely be making it again!

Very nice soup. Personally, I was wishing it had some kind of protein in it, but that's just me. Otherwise, the flavors were great, and was a great way to get rid of the pound of mushrooms in the fridge you're not sure what to do with. It also freezes well.

Very tasty! I made this soup as-is, and it was very good; I wouldn't change a thing! Actually, I did end up having to use dry parsley instead of fresh, because that's all we had, but it still turned out great. This one's definitely a keeper.

I made this according to the recipe except I used about 1.75 cups onion instead of 2 since I’m not a big onion person. I actually do wish I had used the full amount as I think it balances the spices. This is not your usual "American" soup you may be used to. In fact when it was cooking and smelling it, I was not sure I would like it. But then I tasted it and really enjoyed it. In fact I could not stop eating it. Layers of flavor.  I would agree with other reviews that describe this as rich and almost sour. However, at times there was something about it I didn’t like that I couldn’t put my finger on. Too much…parsley? Too much…dill? Overall I liked it, but don’t think I will make it again.

I thought this soup was good, but my husband wasn't crazy about it. It wasn't good enough that I would make it again. The flavors didn't seem to mold together as well as I expected. I also think I put in TOO many mushrooms! :) overall, tasty but not worth the time and expense to make it.

Phenomenal!  We bought two pounds of mushrooms on sale and I was looking for a recipe to feature mushrooms.  I also had some sour cream to use up and this was perfect.  Like other reviewers, we only drink skim or 1% milk and use fat free or low fat sour cream.  It was so rich, I can't imagine using whole milk and regular sour cream.  I used parsley flakes because I didn't have fresh, but I think the fresh would be even better.  The hit of lemon at the end is the secret to brightening up the entire soup and next time, I might even increase it a bit.  The acid really helps to balance the rest.  Restaurant quality without a doubt.

Excellent and of course much better after a day in the fridge. I added a pound of ham and a bit more milk and it's delish!

delish! i wanted to add protein to this recipe, so I cooked up a chicken breast (bone-in) and simmered it when the broth was added. I also added potatoes here. I took the chicken out and cut it up into pieces before I added the milk/flour mixture.
absolutely tasty!

Excellent soup. Hearty and filling. Only changes made were adding 2 tbsp of fresh dill instead of dried along with the parsley and halving the sour cream. Because i used bouillion instead of homemade chicken broth, I omitted the salt. Definitely will make again.

I thought this soup was delicious and I don't even like mushrooms! My kids who are more daring with tasting new things liked it as well. Didn't have any dill so added a bit of oregano and also some rosemary garlic. for any who thought this tasted bland, key is probably the broth- I used a homemade chicken broth for this recipe and that added a lot of flavor as it always does to most recipes.

The only changes I made were to only use 2T of butter and to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth so it was vegetarian.  Also had everyone put a dollip of sour cream on top of their individual soup instead of mixing it in because I had fat free sour cream on hand and was afraid of it breaking up in the soup.  We really liked it and will make it again.

Following a visit to our local mushroom farm, I chose this recipe for my purchase of mixed mushrooms. After reading previous reviews, I made a roux of the butter and flour, substituted fat-free half & half for the milk and sauteed diced carrots, celery and potatoes with the onions and mushroom mixture. I make my own chicken stock. This soup recipe is outstanding!! There are not enough stars to describe it.

This soup was very yummy.  I switched it up a little and used portabella mushrooms and 2 cups of low sodium vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth.  Then to make a little more than 6 servings I added two cups of water and 1 tablespoon of Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base.   My only suggestion is it you don't absolutely LOVE mushrooms you may want to only use 8 ounces instead of 1 pound.  I love mushrooms but it is a bit overwhelming.  If I make this soup again which I am sure I will I would am going to use only 8 ounces mushroom and try adding 1 small potato finely cubed or my boyfriend suggested mini potato & onion pierogis would be a yummy addition.

We had this last night and followed the recipe exactly as written except we forgot to add the lemon before eating. It was delicious even with out the last squirt of lemon. Very rich - we served it with fresh sourdough bread.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out good. I will make it again. The only thing i will change is the amount of salt. 1 tsp was a bit too much since the soy sauce and  the chicken broth are already salty. Good recipe for a cold day!!

I Love this soup! One of my favorites! I made it several times already!. Everyone that tried it loved it, including the people that are not big on mushrooms. This is going in my recipe book for sure. Very easy and Super tasty!!!! Thanks for a delicious recipe!
The only thing I did differently is used much less parsley and i used dry parsley.

As a soup, 3 stars. As a sauce for noodles (think beef stroganoff) it would be 4.5 stars. Mine was quite thick and a full pound of mushrooms is too much. I would say halve the flour and only 10 ounces of mushrooms.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe. I followed it pretty close, used a half cup cream and 1 cup milk as I wanted a little more broth, 2 tbsp dried parsely in lieu of fresh, and mixed up the mushrooms using regular white, portabella, and shitaki. Was the best mushroom soup I've ever had, and it will for sure become a regular in this household.

Very good! I used a little extra flour and 4 tsp dried parsley based on other reviews, but stuck to the recipe otherwise.  Will definitely make again.

I love this soup!  The only changes I made to the soup was to add a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce.  The first time I made the soup it was more stewy.  I really loved the taste of the broth, so the next time I doubled all of the ingredients except the mushrooms.  Also, the first time I made it I had extra large mushrooms, and I should of chopped them into smaller pieces.  Just a couple of minor tweaks!  Thanks!

SO GOOD!! I absolutely loved everything about this soup. I'm still pretty new at cooking, so I followed the recipe exactly and have no complaints. I may use a tiny bit less dill next time but that's personal preference.

didnt have enough parsley to meet the 1/4 cup requirement and still tasted like there was too much. Agree with the other comment about always having a mouthful of parsley.

Otherwise, I used 1 red onion, 2 lbs of mushrooms, and hungarian paprika and it was very tasty!

This ended up tasting like a soup version of beef stroganoff.   Good, but I'd rather make it thicker and put it over noodles.

I have made this wonderful soup twice now, I doubled the mushrooms and used my hand blender at the end to thicken the soup a little more. I thought dill would be hard to find here in winter, but I found those minced herbs in a tube in produce and they work great. I love the flavour of the dill and sour cream. Just heavenly!

If you are like me, looking for an easy, flavorful mushroom soup to take the place of the ones I won't buy in the store anymore due to MSG and high fructose corn syrup, look at this one!  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of using a stick blender as one cook did to break up the mushrooms a little.  I will be putting this in my freezer to make my green bean casserole with come Thanksgiving.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this twice.  The first time I made it as shown and thought it was "OK"...but not great.  However, I made it a second time but used a higher grade paprika.  A true Hungarian paprika and also heated the paprika with the onion on medium high heat for 5 minutes to release the oils in the spice.  This made a WORLD of difference.  I also cut back on the dill by half.  I was reading some Hungarian cookbooks and while they use dill occasionally, it is sparingly.  So I think the dill factor is a bit high for a true Hungarian dish.   It was much better after the changes and more true to Hungarian cooking that I have experienced.

Yum!  Super easy to make, with the exception of chopping up the onions, that's always my least favorite part, especially since I doubled the recipe.  I made quite a few changes, and it still tasted delicious! I took the advice of other posters and lowered the lemon juice by 1 tbsp, so instead of 4 i put in 3.  I also didnt have enough sour cream, so i used what little i had left, then topped it off with some half and half cream.  I  thought that the salt in the chicken broth, the butter, and the cream would be over powering so i declined to put in any extra salt, and instead of chicken broth, I used Epicure's low sodium vegetable broth with a splash of vegetta for taste. I also happened to have Hungarian paprika on hand, and I really think that was key to the great flavor, Hungarian paprika has a completely different taste than regular paprika and I think its just right for this recipe, after all it is Hungarian mushroom soup! Turned out rich and flavorful!

I made this for my vegetarian daughter to take in her lunch.  It was so good, she didn't get to take it in her lunch for long.  I helped eat it all up!  I just replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth.  It was fabulous and we loved it!

This was outstanding with a few minor tweeks. I used over 1.5 pounds of mushrooms, portabella, crimini, a few shitake and regular white mushrooms. Instead of regualr paprika, I used smokey hot paprika (unbelievable flavor from the paprika), I used fresh dill and I added 1/3 of a cup of Harvey's Bristol cream Sherry!  Oh my God! It was delicious! Thanks so much for this fabulous addition to my repetoire

We enjoyed this soup.  I made a few additions - but nothing that would alter the taste of the original recipe too much.  I added 4 small potatoes and some precooked chicken.  I did add a healthy splash of Marsala wine (this must have changed the taste just a little :) I did puree a 1/4 of the soup and add it back in.  SO creamy and delicious!! Thank you!!!  I will so make this again!

Delicious! We do agree that the recipe calls for too much parsley, but it's great otherwise. I used a mix of brown cremini and white button mushrooms, and that was fine, but next time I think I'll stick with the brown mushrooms. And there will definitely be a next time!

This is fabulous.  I made this exactly as described with the exception of the parsley because I didn't have any, and it was extraordinary.  After being raised on the pasty white mushroom soup from a can, this was a rich, delicious bowlful of yummy!  I will make this again and again!

This was okay. I might have given it four stars, but I've made the other (phenomenal) recipe for mushroom soup on this site (Golden State Mushroom Soup), and with the comparison this one ends up suffering. I didn't really care for the lemon end note and thought it would have been vastly better without it. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very easy to make and I was able prepared it up to the last step before adding the sour cream; leaving it on the stove while we left for Christmas Eve service.  It worked out beautifully and tasted really good.  Don't skip any of the ingredients they are all key to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again.

Good. Not overwhelming. Light soup that can probably be thickened up with a little cornstarch. I would go as far as to add potatoes to give it a little weight. Flavors are nice.

Loved this! I made it as written except I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic when I was sauteing the mushrooms. I also added the parsley when I added the milk to make sure it cooked enough and didnt taste too raw. A great soup that I will make again! Thanks for the recipe! :)

Oh my...this is absolutely the best mushroom soup ever!!!  I have made it a couple of times now.  The first time as written, the second I used beef broth instead (that's what I had on hand at the time)and both are wonderful.  I also used white button and crimini mushrooms which made it more "meatier".  This pairs well with cheese and garlic drop biscuits.

Excellent soup.  I think I added a bit too much parsley because it was slightly overpowering so I'll cut it back a little next time.  I used skim milk and low fat sour cream and was concerned it might be too thin but it was thick and rich.  Next time I'll also make sure the mushrooms are browned along with the onions for extra flavour.  Oh, and I only had a half pound of mushrooms on hand and found that it was plenty.  Good cold weather soup.

I love mushrooms so I gave this a try and to my surprise, I didn't care for it.  After all the rave I was sure it was going to be excellent but the color was very unappealing and the taste was mediocre.  Won't be making this again!

Made this using skim milk, no salt chicken broth, low sodium soy sauce, half the dill, and about half of the low fat sour cream and no lemon juice (out of lemons).  Was still rich and thick and plenty flavorful but we still had way to much dill and not really to our tastes.  We prefer Mushroom Soup without Cream or Golden State Mushroom Soup.  Will not make again.

This soup is like a little piece of heaven!  I doubled the recipe and added 3 garlic cloves. Otherwise I made exactly as stated. I WILL be making this again. Thank you so much for sharing!

All I can say is "OH. MY. GOODNESS!!!". I made it exactly as written. Absolutely perfect. No need to alter it in any way. I served it with a side of garlic bread. It was the most satisfying lunch I've had in ages. This will be a new staple recipe for me.

This was excellent! A flavorful, hearty and beautiful soup. I modified mine a bit due to food allergies by using beef broth in place of the chicken broth. This gave the soup a darker, richer color. I also added cooked brown and wild rice at the end. Tastes great the next day, too. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Made this according to directions and the whole pot was eaten.  My family loved this.  Had never had this kind of soup before but I'm definitely going to have it again and again!  Went great with some warm sliced pumpernickel bread.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!!!

I loved the flavor of the soup before I put in the sour cream and lemon, once I added those ingredients the flavor changed and I really wasn't thrilled with the outcome. I will probably make it again but will omit the sour cream and lemon.

Loved this recipe - too spicy for my clan and we ended up using quite a bit of sour cream to back of the burn, but the flavor was fantastic - I'd just cut down the spicey stuff next time around.
Update:  This is my go to soup when I want something delicious and a little bit special.

This soup was alright. It's probably just a personal taste preference that I didn't think it was amazing like everyone else. I thought the flavor was still good though. I used portobello mushrooms and crimini, but if I ever make this again, I will probably stick to the white  buttons or maybe shitake.

Amazing color, but the soup had to much sour cream so suggestion is to cut the sour cream down. Besides that it was ok.

the parsley is wonderful... a very tangy traditional hungarian flavor. a refreshing alternative to the "cream of" soups. ***I subbed 2Tbs vinegar for the soy sauce and it turned out great! Might add a dash of white wine next time. I'm allergic to flour- so it could be thickened with a pinch of cornstarch instead. Didn't have any milk on hand- so i just used the sour cream for creamy-ness. AMAZING!!! Thank you for the recipe:)

I stumbled on this recipe since I had 1 1/2 pounds of mushrooms sitting in my fridge. My hubby doesn't like them so thought I'd put them in a soup and enjoy them myself. I sliced them with a mandoline and then chopped them up into chunks.  I used the whole 1.5 pounds, italian parsley, nonfat milk and less sour cream and the result was completely awesome. A rich, elegant, simple soup, very suitable for a dinner party or just a great meal accompanied by a crusty bread for dipping. Even hubby thought it was amazing (remember, he doesn't like mushrooms). I think chopping them up smaller changes the texture and also makes the soup more interesting than the slices floating around. Thanks HAMM for a terrific recipe!!!

I just shared this with my homeschooling Mom's "Soup Exchange" where it got rave reviews.  My only change was to mix up the mushrooms by adding some baby bellas as well as chopping some and keeping some sliced.  Even my husband and children - who don't like mushrooms as I do - loved the broth.

Very tasty indeed... but more like a delicious, rich gravy packed with mushrooms. Truth is, I'd rather ladle this on top of boiled new potatoes or noodles  than eat it like soup.

For being such a simple recipe, this was a great soup (despite the fact that I didn't have paprika or parsley on hand and used skim milk and light sour cream). I added some cooked wild rice to make it heartier.  Next time, I plan to add a splash of dry sherry after cooking the onions--should bring some depth of flavor.

This is a very good mushroom soup. The golden colour in the photo was sort of turning me off since I am used to a paler mushroom soup, but please try this recipe and you won't be let down. I made it exactly as written except forgot to add the lemon juice (didn't miss it) and I served it topped with huge crunchy garlic croutons. Yum!

This recipe was fantastic and very filling.  Rounded out with a spinach salad and club crackers, it made a perfect lunch. One half recipe makes two bowls worth of soup.

This was just ok for us.  A pleasant change of pace from *typical* soups, yet not a *do-over*.  I followed the recipe to a tee, using a mix of baby bellas, crimini, and oyster mushrooms.   It was simple to make and I really enjoyed the dill/paprika combo.  Thank you for posting!

Wow. I think I found a new favorite Mushroom Soup recipe. I love the dill flavor and the tartness of the sour cream in this soup. I wouldn't change a thing but I think that if you didn't like the addition of sour cream it would also taste great without it. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us. I just made this again and it is still a favourite. The only thing I would add is the serving size. If I wanted 6 servings I would have to double it.

I've made this several times now - it's my absolute favorite mushroom soup recipe.  It's so flavorful and rich, even with using some lighter ingredients - skim milk, some fat-free half and half, reduced fat sour cream .  The only things I've adjusted over time is I now rough chop the sliced mushrooms before sauteing, cut back on the amount of onion, and I usually leave out most, if not all, of the salt as it just doesn't need it. I've also tried it with some nice and meaty cremini mushrooms. This soup has such an interesting combination of flavors but is so delicious.

This was good but I've had better at restaurants.  I think 2 cups of onion is excessive, I would recommend 1 cup.  I also thought there was too much dill.  I would start with one tsp and add more later if you don't think it's enough.  I used all low fat ingredients and it didn’t take away from the flavor but I think half and half instead of milk would be excellent.

I made this and really enjoyed it over rice (it became pretty thick at the end of cooking).  The fragrance was wonderful, and perfectly spiced, and tasted fantastic.

I've made this soup several times and luv it.  I've upped the sliced mushrooms to 24oz and once the soup is finished I refrigerate it for a day before eating. The difference between eating it as soon as it is finshed and waitng a day is remarkable.  The flavor is much more complex after waiting a day.

This would be a great first course. For a main meal I found the mushrooms hard to eat toward the end. The broth is delicious the whole way through though!

Delicious! Such a simple recipe, yet really tasty. I omitted the dil (didn't have any) but added basil and dried parsley (no fresh parsley). It was great. I added a small dash of hot sauce for a kick. Didn't have sour cream so used a small amount of whipping cream. Tastes even better the next day. I poured it over mashed potato. Also tried it adding carrots and fresh spinach. Another time I added chick peas for extra protein. Great every time!

I eat a lot of soup, at home and restaurants, so I have a lot of experience where soup is concerned. The flavor of this soup is somewhat sophisticated, close to "Soup of the Day" level. I have prepared and eaten many great soups at allrecipes, some of which are better than Hungarian Mushroom Soup. Still, this recipe would easily be in the top tier of soup recipes at allrecipes that I have prepared. To boot, it's easy to prepare.

When I was a little girl (ok, well I'm only 21, but you get it) I can remember one of the best dining experiences of my young life with a simple bowl of "Hungarian Mushroom Stew." Since I started cooking I have been searching all over for that flavor and texture and warmth. This recipe brought me back to that magical moment!

Simply the best soup I have ever had. I like to top off with some shredded green onions or shallots. Serve with warm corn bread and a tiny pat of butter. 

Thank you so much!

a perfect recipe yielding delicious results!  I used FF chicken broth, skim milk, and LF sour cream and it is still perfectly creamy and thick.  this makes a perfect first course soup and while its good as is, I don't love the texture of mushrooms on their own so I made some brown rice separately and have added it to taste to individual servings, making a perfect meal!  I might try a wild rice blend next time for some extra heartiness for this really great soup.  try this!  thanks for sharing!

Good mushroom stew. This is the standard recipe from Mollie Katzen's Moosewood cookbook. I always omit the soy sauce - it doesn't need it. Instead, I add a nice dry but slightly sweet sherry (not cooking sherry! - make it something you'd actually drink, ok?). Add it during the roux-mushroom saute step. This addition really makes the recipe - trust me! Before serving, throw some nice fresh, chopped chives along with a sprinkling of dill seed on top of the soup after you've added the sour cream. A key to this recipe is also the paprika. If you cheap-out on it, you'll notice. Instead of smokey-sweet you'll have bitter. I like the Hungarian brand paprika, personally. It costs more, but it's worth it.

Excellent mushroom soup! We used shiitake and baby bella mushrooms and reduced the salt to 1/4 teaspoon using low sodium soy suace and low sodium organic beef broth.
We will be having this often.

This soup was absolutely "DELISH".  My husband is very picky & he loved it as well...my 6-year old, not so much, but more for us!  The only change I made was substituting beef broth for the chicken broth.  I wish I'd doubled the recipe!

This was a great recipe! Both my husband and I loved it, I made a couple of changes by adding carrots and celery to the onions and mushrooms and towards the end I threw in some noodles and chicken to make it a little more of a complete meal.

I usually add some flank steak and potatoes to this soup.  I cook the steak and then add about a cup of water and let it simmer to make a quick broth.  My Russian husband loves this authentic gribovnitsa with a huge dollop of sour cream!

Bravo!  It is rare that I don't "tinker" with a recipe, but with this one, it was definitely unnecessary!  My fiance requested that I make this dish.  I had not ever sampled this kind of soup, but I was blown away by the results!  As mentioned, I made no changes.  It is truly rich, scrumptious and wonderful as written!  Take it from a true "foodie" ~ this one is worth giving a try!  Thank you HAMM for a fantastic recipe!

I looked at this recipe and couldn't imagine if it would actually taste good with all that combined.  It is heavenly.  I modified the recipe and added a little more salt, and three cloves of finely minced garlic, which I sauted with the onions and mushrooms.  I also added a little onion powder.  This recipe even makes great leftovers... if it lasts that long.

Wow, this was the BEST mushroom soup I've ever had.  Added slightly less dill based on other reviews and used FF sour cream.  It turned out incredibly rich and creamy and was super easy to make.  My better half and I agree that this will be a staple in our soup rotation.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful dish!

Edit to say that after discussing this soup, we came to the conclusion that it's very similar to Goulash/Stroganoff type dishes ... we think that it would be awesome with some beef in it and served over noodles.

This was very good and easy to make. My husband loves chunky soup, so I added more mushrooms (cremini and white button mushrooms). I had boiled a whole chicken, shredded some pieces of it and used the broth; I added that in as well. I always cook with garlic so I also added a minced clove of fresh garlic when I sauteed the onions and mushrooms. Salt and sour cream were added to taste. I put a little Worchestershire sauce in as well. Next time I will experiement and add more vegetables like potatoes or celery and increase the broth. Great recipe.

Wonderful satisfying soup!!!  So rich and delicious, but not fattening.  I used leeks instead of onions and added 2 Tab. paprika instead of 1 and tweeked it with a dash of sherry and omited the sour cream.  This will be on our favorite soup list.  Thank you for submitting it.

A new favorite!  I love mushrooms, and this was so hearty and creamy.  Like others have suggested, I used low sodium soy sauce (my family still said it was a bit too salty), skim milk, and light sour cream, as well as freshly-squeezed lemon juice.  At first I thought the amount of dill weed was a little overpowering, but after a few spoonfuls I really liked it the way it was.  This one's going in my home recipe book.

Now, THIS is a great soup! I made this for a New Year’s Eve party where most of the guests were dedicated carnivores, but one  can’t eat meat products beyond chicken broth in the evening. I had a crowd hovering within sniffing range! The only changes I made were to double the recipe, add a few cloves of garlic with the onions, and two medium, coarsely shredded red potatoes along with the mushrooms, as I only had a pound and a half of mushrooms. Worked great, and the soup held up very nicely in the crock pot on warm for my buffet presentation.

Followed all of the measurements because I wanted to taste how it was intended to taste. Really didn't care for it. I hated the dill flavor in a soup! If it wasn't for the mushrooms I would've thrown it all away.

I have been looking for a Hungarian Soup recipe for years. I was so excited to find it.  It is soooo delicious. I doubled the soup (My husband and I, and six of our kids were home for supper last night)we had one bowl each, and we definitely could have  had more. To the chicken broth I added four  tablespoons of beef base, I added an extra tablespoon of Hungarian paprika ( I could have added more), I also doubled the dill weed.I did not add the fresh parsley, instead I added a half cup of Classico Basil Pesto.
Yum, yum, yum. I personally think that the recipe doesn't serve 6, it only serves 3. Thank you for this recipe, I think I am going to make it for our Bible  study Christmas party next week.

I'm not a big fan of mushroom soups, but had a big container of mushrooms left over after Thanksgiving to use.  I found this recipe and gave it a try.  I made a few modications - added carrots along with the onions.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic.  I didn't have any sour cream in house, so I used some taziki sauce that I had (I thought since it's a yogurt sauce with garlic and dill it would make a good substitute).  I was delighted with how this soup came out.  I used about 1/8 cup of fresh parsley and that was just about right, much more might start to overpower the flavor.  Finally at the end I added a slice of swiss cheese broken up in small pieces, just a touch of extra flavor.

Excellent recipe. Its been always a hit with guests whenever I served it. However I changed some ingredients. Instead of sour cream I use a packet of Mushroom soup powder and I add also a few drops of Worcetershire sauce.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I was the only one who liked this in my family.  I thought it was really good (although not the healthiest) but I just can't figure out why my family didn't.  Perhaps the dill?

The closest I had come to mushroom soup was used in recipes and came in a can.  I made this at the request of a friend, and I must admit it was not only easy, but delicious!  I will be making this soup again and so will my friend since they asked for the recipe.

Delicious. Reminiscent of a stroganoff sauce. I used half button mushrooms and half shiitake mushrooms. I did not think the amounts of dill and lemon were too much. Actually, I added more lemon than was called for. This might be good on pasta.

Excellent!  I pureed the mushrooms and onion in food processor before I sauted them.  Otherwise I followed the recipe. It has a wonderful flavor.  I could not imagine the paprika and dill but it sure made this recipe.  Very Good!

Expected this soup to be a little thicker, so next time I will add a little of the Golden's Soup & Sauce flour...but the flavor was out of this world!!  VERY YUMMY and would pass for gourmet soup!  Easy too.

Delicious!!! I made just a few modifications because of items I had on hand. The only change I made is I added leftover chicken that I had (made with the marinade recipe for Grecian Pork Tenderloin on this site). Since the chicken had marinated in lime and oregano, I skipped the dill and added just a teaspoon of lemon juice instead of what the recipe called for. I also made this a little thicker with extra flour and we ate it with some brown rice. This is a new favorite and even my husband who is not a huge mushroom fan LOVED it! I will make the soup as is for my recipe exchange group this month.
Thanks for sharing a fantastic comforting soup.

Love the recipe. I did use the immersion blender as my husband just had some extensive dental work. This is how good it is. My granddaughter hates mushrooms. I didn't tell her what was in it and she loved it. She'll be asking for Hungarian soup again. I did double the recipe and there is enough for leftovers.

Great winter warmer soup. I've made it several times and occasionally for a bit of variety I put  in some diced red and yellow peppers just to add another layer to the flavour.

Serve this with garlic mashed potatoes.  Better yet, put a scope of garlic mashed potatoes at the bottom of each bowl before spooning the soup in.  It's delicious!!

Really fantastic mushroom soup.  I would've preferred mine a bit creamier but it reminded us all of stroganoff.  I used half portabello and half button mushrooms which probably helped the flavor.  Although I was really hesitant with the soy sauce, it did not taste like soy sauce at all.  Great soup, I also liked that the recipe did not make a ton, just enough for some leftovers, no one will be eating mushroom soup two weeks from now.

This soup was great and very easy to make.  At the last minute I noticed I had no lemon juice so I used lime juice instead and it was still great.  This soup was similar to ones my Hungarian grandparents used to make!

I made a 6 X batch for a soup fundraiser at my nursing school. I receive a lot of compliments on it and, hopefully, steered a lot of people to allrecipes.com! I look forward to trying this in the future by adding a little wine and some more exotic mushrooms. Thanks

This soup is exquisite!  I didn't have any flour, so I just left it out and used 1 cup of half and half instead of the milk.  I also used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.  Absolutely to die for.  If you're having problems with the consistency, just omit the flour or use only a little bit.  Seriously, this is better than mushroom soup I've had in really nice restaurants.

Great! Didn't change anything (used a mix of portabella and the regular white variety). This time was just for myself, served with focaccia bread from the grocery store bakery. But, I could definitely see this as a starter for a more formal dinner!

this is the best.  I added more mushrooms and used a combo of button and cremini.  I was looking for something different than the usual cream of mushroom soup and boy did I find it!  My husband said he wants this all winter long and this is one I'll be craving too.  This is a must for anyone who loves mushrooms.

I can see why this recipe is in the cookbook!  By far the best soup I have EVER made.  I used all baby portabella mushrooms and added a green and orange bell pepper just because I didn't want them to go bad.  I agree with others in that this does resemble the mushroom soup served up at Panera.  Delicious - thank you for the recipe.

My girlfriend called me and asked me if I could make dinner for her, instantly I think of all the dishes I do the best(totals to about 3) I asked her what she would like and she says.. there's some meat I put out, why dont you make a soup. I say, ok. and hang up.  Problem is, I have never made soup other than 'add water'.  I've mastered a few pasta dishes, but I'm certainly no cook.  I surfed over to this recipe, bought the ingrediants. and began my test run.  It was extremely easy to make, and it tastes VERY good. She was extremely impressed. I first served the soup in a bowl, then for a main dish, I cooked rice, grilled chicken(with lime), and poured the soup(u can add a little xtra sour-cream to make it more sauce like) over the chicken & rice to make an excellent main dish.
VERY SATISFIED

Great!  This is very close to St. Louis Bread Company's (Panera to the rest of the US) Forest Mushroom Soup, with which I am obsessed.

I think next time I will add a little brandy and sub beef broth for the chicken broth to make it a little richer.

Made this tonight for dinner and can't wait to have it again for lunch tomorrow!  I followed the recipe except for a couple of things- I took a couple of reviewers suggestions and cut down on the dill (a little over 1 tsp, not quite 1 1/2, and it didn't overpower the soup at all), I used a 1/2 cup half and half plus 1/2 cup milk (just happened to have some on hand, from another recipe I tried this week), and I used homemade chicken stock for the broth (also leftover from a recipe).  I also used crimini and white mushrooms mixed, but used the same total amount called for in the recipe.  I think the consistency of the soup was perfect, not too gravy-ish as some of the reviews had said...it was just thick enough (though it probably would have been great over rice!)  This will become a regular, especially during the winter months.  Great recipe!!

I also thought this soup was of a gravy consistency--I had to add more milk to thin it out a bit and dilute the spices.  Use half as much dill and paprika and then increase to taste.  You can always put more in but you can't take it out.

Absolutely fantastic!  Made this recipe with fresh dill instead of dried and a mixture of mushrooms (cremini, shitake, oyster and portobello)  As we were making this dish for dinner with a vegetarian friend, we also subbed mushroom broth for the chicken broth called for.  Served over brown rice with a green salad on the side, it was a great meatless main dish.
I found the leftovers were even tastier, though it was very tempting to finish the whole thing off on the first night. :)

The flavor of this soup is good, but the consistency is somewhat like a gravy, and the herbs gave it a strange feel on the tongue.  Perhaps if the flour was decreased and all the herbs were fresh, we might have liked it better.

This recipe is nice and rich- i tend to double the amount of mushrooms in it because we love mushrooms- i use low fat sour cream and more dill than called for-- really interesting flavors and don't skip the lemon and parsley at the end-- they really serve as a great flavor balancer-- love the layers of flavor in this one.

This recipe puzzles me.  First of all, I thought it was just so-so.  My guests said it was wonderful.  The onion adds a really sweet taste, and the soy sauce puts a salty spin on it.  Honestly, it reminded me of Beef Stroganoff minus the beef.  It was really thick, so I ended up adding about 1/2 cup more of milk at the end.  Also, make sure you understand that this only makes 6 servings.  It's not enough for a family of four, especially if served as a main item for dinner.  I guess I was looking for a more creamy soup, and this just wasn't what I expected.  I'll definitely use it as a base recipe, though.

Forget any cream of mushroom soup you have tasted. This is anything but bland. A local restaurant has this as thier signature dish and people will drive 30+ miles for it. I was glad to find a recipe so I can make it at home.

Wow, this was really, really good.  I made the following changes:  I used portobello mushrooms, after the onions and mushrooms cooked I stirred the flour in, then added the water and simmered for 15 minutes.  I added the milk and simmered a few more minutes and then added the sour ream and salt.  It was very yummy and next time I think I will add a little sherry.

Good! I used f/f 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk and added some caraway seed and 4 roasted garlic cloves, just because. I did not add sour cream - it was good enough as is without the added calories. I used an immersion blender once it was all said and done, maintaining some chunkiness. A keeper.

Unreal flavor.  I had a dinner party for 8 so made enough for 9 and ran out because everyone wanted seconds!  I blended 2/3 of the soup to make it creamier but wanted to leave some texture. Used button, crimini and enoki mushrooms. It also did well in a crock pot to stay warm because I made it well in advance.  I mixed dill, parsley and sherry with sourcream and piped designs on the soup before serving with a sprig of parsley and a few enoki's as garnish.  very elegant.

This is by far the best mushroom soup I have ever tasted. I was a little apprehensive when I saw all the different ingredients but if I learned one thing from years of cooking it is to never judge a recipe until you've tried it. This is a keeper and also a great way to use leftover mushrooms.

Yummy and certainly company-worthy.  We used twice as much butter (a full stick) and maybe more onions (1.5 large ones, chopped).  Scant 1/4 c. dried parsley, because that's what we had.  Good presentation and reminded us of restaurant soup.  Might be niced paired with simple baked chicken or maybe just a salad.

Great recipe! This soup is really tasty with portabella mushrooms. It tastes just as good with half (2 Tbsp)the butter and reduced fat sour cream if you're concerned about fat. Great served over wild rice.

This is an absolutely delicious soup.  I used half and half for extra creaminess, though even skim milk works well.  I've made this soup with standard button mushrooms as well as with a mixture of shitake and portabella 'shrooms.  The latter I felt made for a more interesting flavor.  Everyone I've made this for has just raved about it.  Not for the dieter, but who cares? *G*  Sometimes you've just got to live a little!

fantastic recipe! next time I will cook the mushrooms a bit longer to release more of the liquid. the consistency is lovely - very creamy. watch your heat though because there is not much liquid and mine started to burn (thanks goodness I caught it in time!

This was exquisite.  I used half regular mushrooms and half portobello.  I also used half the amount of butter and substitued olive oil for the other half.  It was scrumptious!  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks Cathy!

OHMIGOSH, this was one of the BEST soups I've ever fixed! Plus it was easy, always a plus in my book. I added some roast garlic & put my immersion blender in it to puree some of it for a creamier soup. It's a recipe I fix again & again, and pass on to anyone I know that likes mushrooms. It's as good as ANY I've had in restaurants.

This is the best mushroom soup recipe I have ever found.
I was going to make Chicken soup for my husband who has a bad cold. I didn't want to make plain old chicken soup.I found this recipes and decided to give it a try.  
I cooked the shredded chicken with portabella mushroom, onions and added garlic.  I didn't have chicken stock. I had to use beef instead. I also didn't have sour cream on hand.  It is the best chicken and mushroom soup I have ever tasted.
Thank you for sharing your recipe.  My sister-in-law is Hungarian. I am forwarding the recipe to her. Excellent!

I had never had Hungarian Mushroom Soup before, but I needed to get rid of some chicken broth, sour cream, and mushrooms, so I decided to make it.  It was very filling and rich, with an interesting combination of flavors.  I did not have dill and I left out the lemon, so perhaps it would have been better if I had added those ingredients.  All in all a satisfying recipe.

The soup was looking and smelling great, until I added the lemon juice and sour cream which immediately curdled together.  The taste was okay, but looked terrible!

My husband and I both enjoy this soup very much.  Kids dont like mushrooms. I only add a pinch of dill weed (2 tsp's is a little over powering for us).  Tastes just like the soup from a local resturant.

This soup is excellent. It's very flavorful and anyone who likes mushrooms would like this. The dill and lemon with the sour cream give it a wonderful taste. I will make this over and over again. Yummy.

This is good.  Really good.  It's thick enough to use for a sauce; thinned with a little more water, it's good in a bowl.  I love the seasonings, which I'm not used to.  I'll try more recipes with these herbs because I liked this so well.  Next time I'll try some of the suggestions others have made.  Really, really good soup.

This soup is one of my favorite mushroom soups.  Tangy undertones give it a distinct flavor.  For those who prefer healthy recipes, omitting the butter will make it taste just as good and easier to digest.

Fantastic! The only problem with this recipe is that it doesn't make enough for leftovers ... you will want to double the recipe to have more of this delicious soup, though I don't know yet if reheating will make the creamy part of the soup clump.

This is the first soup I've ever made.  It was super easy.  I used half the dill weed and half the mushrooms.  Next time I will use even less dill weed and half the paprika.  Even though I really liked it and rated it 5 stars, I guess I'm not used to such a flavorful soup.

My husband says "It's a keeper."  I asked if he would like it for dinner tonight.  He said "Only if you make a double batch.  I want more leftovers."  We have a restaurant in town that makes this soup and it is quite popular.  This is as good if not better.  Thank you!

A huge hit for the kids! I did add more mushrooms, not because you have to but because we love mushrooms. I had an idea to try, make this a little thicker to use as a gravy over mashed taters and grilled venison, I believe that will work nicely

So often soups taste better on day 2 (or 3).  This soup is among those numbers.  I found the residual of  the flour milk mixture took time to cook out.  Next time I would create  roux  instead of a mixture.  Vary the paprika till you find you "best" flavoring.  I like paprika so a little extra never hurts.

Loved this dish! Even my children liked it.  Goes great with a small side salad and Garlic Bread.  Did make one change the SECOND time I made it.  Used 1 1/2 pounds of mushrooms instead of 1 pound.

I'll probably make it again, it made a lot (it's just me here), so I froze 1/2.  Not a good result.  I thought it might not work, to freeze it, and I was right.  It was yummy.  Remember, don't crown the mushrooms when you sauté them, and saute them well, to almost crispy!  That way they have a better mouth feel in the soup. The dill made all the difference.

Incredible! I do not keep dill in the house because I don't like it, so it's the only thing I left out. I doubled the recipe and shared some with my boss. She AND her teenage daughter went nuts over it!! A definite keeper!!

The only change I made was to use gluten-free flour. It was absolutely lovely. I will make it again. It can be difficult to find foods that excite my husband... last night he  couldn’t stop raving about it. His comments were, “is there any left? “

I will definitely make this again. It’s a great recipe that offers lots of opportunity to make adaptations based on your audience. I added garlic and split the 2 cups of broth 1/2 vegetable about half beef. It added some depth to the flavor profile. I have had several requests for the recipe.

Wow! What a treat for the senses! I must have been living under a rock for the last 46 years, as I’ve never seen a soup recipe with dill! YUM YUM!! I didn’t have unsalted butter, so I used regular. I did use low sodium chicken broth. I added more mushrooms, and some shredded left over rotisserie chicken. Boom!!! So so good! What a beautiful melody of flavors! When I told my fiancé about the soup, he said “I’ll try it.” I could tell he was skeptical. Guess who LOVED the soup? My guy!! Can’t wait to make it again. This will definitely be bragged about tomorrow at work! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Used beef bouillon instead of chicken. Decreased sour cream to 1/3 cup (wanted a less sour taste) and decreased paprika to 1/2 T.  It was outstanding.  Doesn't make a ton of soup but hubs and I ate every bit for supper!

If you love mushrooms this recipe is a must. I made it according to the recipe but I added 3 diced potatoes when I added the mushrooms. This made it a little more hearty.

My family absolutely loves it!!!! I make this a couple times a month. I like a little less onion so I reduced it to 3/4 of the recommended. I serve with grilled cheese sandwich and it makes a full homey meal.

I made the recipe as is and thought it was great.  I did not change/modify anything until after it was complete and I did a taste test.  So my 5 stars are based on the recipe as is.  As someone that loves mushrooms, I did end up adding some dry sherry.  Next time I'll add 1/3 cup of dry sherry during the saute process.

I absolutely love this recipe! I personally doubled the recipe and used hot Hungarian paprika. I also never measure my spices but rather add them to taste. In my household, we LOVE our seasoning so I added lots of the dill and paprika. I served this with a homemade french baguette. Will definitely make again.

I used 4 different mushrooms: regular, portabella, oyster and shitake. Wonderful, rich flavor. Glad I made a double batch so I could send some home with our guests and also have some for us tomorrow!

Menu for 12/29/20 Brunch:
- Fruit Salad
- Croissant Sandwiches with Avocado, Smoked Salmon, Lettuce, sliced Cucumber, Tomatoes, sour cream with capers
- this Hungarian Mushroom Soup

My teenage daughter who doesn't like cooked mushrooms had a second helping!  Followed the recipe except used dill essential oil for the dill which worked out beautifully, no dill specks.  Out of parsley so I skipped that but it had plenty of flavor.  At the end I scooped out some of the mushrooms, used my stick blender then added them back in.  Next time we might slow cook a roast and then add some to this soup.  We'll see!

I got this recipe from the print magazine, and I make it at least twice a month. It's delicious. I use smoked paprika, and coconut milk so it's vegan, and I blend with the immersion blender. Easy and super delicious!

Good hearty mushroom soup, I do believe it could use some potatoes or hamburger next time I try this recipe. I don't believe the parsley was necessary and I'd love to try different kinds of mushrooms.

For many a summer vacation, my father and I looked forward to our annual trip to Longwood Gardens, Kennett Square, PA, to enjoy the Cream of Mushroom Soup. I've tried duplicating it, even following a recipe found online (supposedly) from LG restaurant, with no success. 
I have made this recipe, twice, AND substituted healthful alternatives to the ingredients  (whole fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream, a whole can of coconut milk as opposed to dairy) as well as trying a mixture of different types of mushrooms ..... there's just no way of ruining this recipe. I've even added meatballs to the leftover soup and put it over egg noodles. Absolutely fantastic!
 ... oh, both times I used an immersion blender to make it a "cream of ..." soup. Phenomenal!

Used low sodium broth, so didn't worry about salt.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Very good!

I followed the recipe exactly plus the addition of garlic when I sautéed the onions and added some cayenne at the end for a little kick. Delicious! I will make it again.

This was really good and easy to make. Will make it again. Used soy milk instead of regular, because that’s what I had, but it probably would have been richer with regular milk or  some heavy whipping cream. Very good!

Made it with half shiitakes and half buttons.  On first taste it was subtle, but with each spoonful I liked it more.  Impossible not to have a second bowl.

This came as one of the daily emails, and it sounded good, so I kept the recipe to try.  It was delicious, and I am going to keep it as a cold weather go-to.

Try it with baby bella mushrooms!

Changed nothing. Made this soup a week before Thanksgiving. And popular demand had me make it again as the starter for our Thanksgiving dinner. Winner, winner.
Will make it again but will try it with a wild mushroom mix.

This is a delicious winter soup. I made some minor changes, only to reduce salt and ease prep. as I made it on a weeknight. Used 1 large onion, pre- sliced bag of mushrooms, 1 tsp of dill, 2 tsp of soy sauce, low sod. chicken broth, 1% milk, 1 tsp of lemon juice, and 1/4 c sour cream, with a tablespoon chopped parsley.  Still it was awesome. Thank you for a great tasting soup!

I made this for our first course on Thanksgiving. We all love mushrooms, so this was perfect!! I did add extra sour cream, milk and cheese to make it more of a creamier soup, rather than a thin and brothy soup.  My family LOVED it!! It will definitely be a comeback recipe!! Thank you

Super delicious. Quick and pretty simple. I did a poor job prepping the parsley so it did not represent well in the soup. I will definitely be making it again.

Absolutely delicious! Only few changes I have made- i used fresh chopped dill, and i have added thinly sliced potatoes ( about the same size as sliced mushrooms) just after adding the broth and simmering for first 15 min.

Most excellent soup.  Easy to make and healthy.  I followed the directions exactly, only added roasted pine nuts to sprinkle in your bowl.  Served with a salad and some great bread and this was an amazing meal.  It’s a keeper. Thanks!

How delicious and creamy!

This recipe is easy to follow and doesn't take too long to make. The only chances that I made was adding spinach and a pinch of oregano. 

I will definitely make this soup again!

Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great base for a mushroom soup. Love the flavors with some minor tweaks. I used organic baby bellas which worked out nicely. I would suggest letting the mushrooms soften a bit more next time, maybe first cook time 20 minutes before adding milk. Also, I didn’t like the tartness added by the sour cream so the second time I made this, I substituted heavy cream and it was much better. Also first time I used a combo of crushed fennel seed and celery seed in place of the dill since I was out and preferred that over the dill I used on the second time. Overall great flavors as is but improved with the tweaks for my tastes!

I loved this soup also. I did not have any lemon juice so I left it out and instead of using just milk I used half cream and half milk and I added no salt or pepper because I used salted butter.

I made this as instructed but with a spoon of dried parsley rather than fresh. It's amazing! I ended up making it twice in one week. Great as instructed but I'll probably try a lower fat version and maybe some smoked paprika in the future.

Used some smoke paprika (it's what I had in the cupboard). I also added a bit of garlic.  I had leftovers and it reheated well in the microwave. Would love to make this with hot paprika and Portobello or Cremini mushrooms. Will definitely make again.

I have made this a few times now and it been permanently added to the Rolodex. I highly recommend swapping the milk for heavy cream and blending about 80% of the finished soup for better consistency.

Delicious!  Probably helped by the richness of my subbing half and half, as I was out of milk, but flavor was great, made as written except no parsley- and I didn’t miss it.

I only had one onion, so probably about one cup of chopped onions, and I didn’t have any parsley, but this was delicious. I ate one serving and I was going to cook up some venison in my Instant Pot. So i decided to put the remainder of the soup over the steaks. We’ll see how it comes out.

I will make this again and I will watch the pot more carefully since I almost burned it. It's very thick. Perfect for a dinner party course keeping the portion size small and serving with a fresh baguette and chilled white wine.

I followed the recipe except for adding more mushrooms and using heavy cream that needed to be used. Best mushroom soup I’ve ever had. The men in the house agreed. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this very easy and delicious soup, but made some adjustments, as I try very hard to eat gluten free and dairy free.  I used almond milk, almond flour and dairy free sour cream.  I also added about a fourth  of a cup of red wine. I will definitely make this again!

Just made this soup for dinner! Love it! I used an 8 oz container of cremini mushrooms and an 8 oz container of a mixed mushrooms that had white, shiitake and cremini, I used 3 cups of broth by accident , but I don’t think that mattered, just gave me a bit more soup. I added cayenne pepper because my daughter likes a bit of heat. Used dried parsley because I didn’t have fresh. Will be making this soup all the time now!  Thanks for sharing!

I did read the reviews and I ended up using the amount of lemon juice and parsley, as written.
My adult kids are vegan and this recipe lends itself well for vegan substitutions!
Thank you for sharing!

This was very good with a rich flavor. The only change that i personally would make would be to double up on the ingredients. I only used a couple of sprigs of the parsley.

Absolutely delicious!  Made as original recipe except halved the salt and used light sour cream and 1% milk. Rich and flavorful! Husband loved it too and offered to print the recipe so we could definitely have it again.

This soup was excellent! Which says something as I absolutely hated mushrooms until way into my adult years.  I did make a few adjustments. Used 1/2 and milk mixture and used the food processor to grind up about 2/3 of the onion and mushrooms before adding stock. Oh. Also added a little ground Italian sausage which I browned first.

Will  definitely make it again.  It's delicious.  The only thing I would do differently is to add a little more chicken broth so it's not quite as thick.

Very easy to make. Flavor was a nice change from traditional mushroom soup. Definitely will make again.

I added chopped up grilled steak. I didn’t like the dill flavor in it.  I would leave that out next time.

My husband and I loved this mushroom soup.  I made several substitutions, using what I had on hand (buttermilk, tarragon to replace dill, tamari sauce) and I will make it again and again.

I made this for dinner tonight. I made it exactly per the recipe, except I didn’t use the dill. I didn’t have any. Husband and kids liked it. I loved it. I served it with a green salad and garlic bread. I will be making this again. Quick and easy weeknight recipe. Thank you

The soup’s good.  As with any soup there’s room for variability and change.  I used several type of mushrooms in the mix.  Next time I might try a few others.

Started making this in the morning, thinking I would have it for lunch, but it smelled so good that I had it for breakfast instead!  I really enjoy the flavor of this.  I made according to recipe with a few very minor changes:  (1)  I used gluten-free flour--no  noticeable effect  (2) I had a cup of  chicken broth left over from something else, so I added it to the 14-oz. can of broth I had bought for this, making it 22 oz. instead of 16, but  it wasn't too watery  (3)  I forgot to get parsley .  I used Tamari-type soy sauce, but I  often cook with dark Chinese soy sauce, and I think this might add a nice flavor to it as well.

Really excellent! I tried to follow the recipe closely and only changed it a little. I added the flour earlier, to the butter, onions & mushroom mixture.  Then cooked it until bubbly before adding the broth. Vegetable broth makes it a vegetarian meal. I did add more broth and a splash of white wine. I forgot to get fresh parsley, so had to use dried. It tasted like a gourmet restaurant’s specialty! I just added French bread and a hearty salad of spinach, apples, cheddar cheese & walnuts with a light honey mustard vinaigrette. I will make this often! Thank you so much for the recipe!

I did add little potatoes, garlic (well because I am a garlic freak), Great Lakes Collagen for some extra protein, used stock and doubled it, doubled the milk and added some extra sour cream because I'm going to let it simmer longer than recipe says. Used organic pretty much everything I could, I didn't have parsley but still good without. Very good and easy to make!!

I used sherry in the final sauce.  I didn’t add salt until final tasting. I did not combine the sour cream but gave a spoonful after putting in the bowl.

Got this recipe in my email inbox and had to make it that very night!  Absolutely delicious; I did not have to add the sour cream as my batch was already adequately thickened since I used whole milk.  I sprinkled paprika on  top and voila - highly recommend this one!

I loved this very creamy soup!  I added more salt, 1/2 the paprika and dill...and only used 1 tsp of dried parsley since I didn't have fresh.  I might try adding fresh garlic with the onion sauté for a different flavor next time.  I recommend!

Excellent!  However, made it with beef broth, 1/2 the salt, 1/2 milk & 1/2 heavy cream and 2 kinds of mushrooms.  Liked it so much this way, may not try it with chicken stock.  Will double the recipe next time - I want more leftovers.  Don't leave out the lemon juice.  The twang from the lemon juice and sour cream are wonderful.

I have made this soup numerous times. My hubby and I love it.  I do add a few dashes of soy sauce to the mushrooms.  Other than that, it's the best mushroom soup we have ever eaten.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

Fantastic! I only had dried parsley and I added a orange bell pepper cut into large chunks, when the broth was nearly done about 5 minutes before adding the roux. Amazing flavor! Very subtle and savory.

This was wonderful!  I was looking for a mushroom soup recipe that wasn't super creamy nor too broth based. I used Hungarian paprika and half the sour cream.  As a note:  I was feeding five people. So doubled the recipe. I used a five quart Dutch oven and that size worked well. (Used half baby Bella and half white mushrooms)

I was a little disappointed in the flavor.   I was looking for a fresh and robust experience.    The soup came together very nice and looked beautiful in the bowl.   Just didn’t have any zing.    Next time I would try adding either red pepper flacks and maybe ground thyme and roast the spices before adding to the soup.

Loved this soup, didn't have dill weed so used dill seed which I ground up, used little less than 1 teaspoon, also did  not have lemon so used half a lime, delicious.  My roommate ate 2 helpings!

This was such an amazing soup!  It was a tad too salty but I still ate it all.  The only thing I would change would be to add 1/2 the salt next time.

I doubted the broth and all of the herbs except for the flour and salt. It was rich and thick.  Delicious.

I have made this recipe MANY times, and have enjoyed it EVERY time!  I make it exactly how the recipe is posted, and I love that can be made low fat, without compromising taste.  Just using low fat milk and sour cream.  The only changes I make are doubling the recipe!

This is the Moosewood recipe - with the addition of soy sauce (which many reviews seem to suggest makes it too salty), a load of parsley and the substitution of chicken broth with water (if you prefer a vegetarian version - use water, like the original). I found the tanginess of the soup a  bit odd with mushrooms, but recognize this is just a personal thing. It wasn’t bad - thick, creamy and flavourful - but not something I’m likely to make with regularity.

we love this soup all year round.  The best time is fall of course.  This is good on the diabetic diet as well.  We use a variety of mushrooms as well as 1/2 buttermilk and 1/2 milk.

The first time I had Hungarian Mushroom Soup was at a gourmet restaurant/deli -- and it was so good, I immediately began looking for the recipe online when I got home.  As good fortune would have it,  I found this recipe and it tasted exactly the same.  Yay!  I've made it many times since, and it never fails to disappoint guests.  For added mushroom flavor, I add in a handful of dried porcini mushrooms which I soak for half an hour before adding to the pot.  To serve, I puree the soup,  then add slices of sauteed mushroom slices that I've browned in a bit of butter .  Finally, a sprinkling of fresh dill or parsley.

Really good.  Use low sodium ingredients (chicken broth, soy sauce).  You can add salt later if you like.  Loved the use of mushrooms and parsley from my garden.  Fresh and just lovely.

I had 8 ozs. of mushrooms left-over from pizza night so I halved the recipe.  This soups was amazing!  Will definitely be my go-to recipe when I have extra mushrooms. Only changes were a dash of sherry and half-half instead of milk.

Outstanding.  I didn't have any soy sauce (weird, I know).  I substituted 1 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce and 1 1/2 tsp fish sauce.  Came out beautifully.  Outstandingly balanced.

This is very delicious.  I made as written with the exception of using dried parsley as my plants are ready yet.  I think I may cut the salt in half next time.

I very much enjoyed this recipe.  Rich and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly (cheated with a bit of fresh garlic) and it was good.  Unlike some other reviews, I think the salt is absolutely called for.  My son suggested adding some protein to it, which I think might make it a meal.  Some store-bought roasted chicken shredded in there might be something I'll try the next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for my church’s community dinner for 100 people. I did the recipe x12. I made triple the recipe 4 times.  I used the immersion blender a little, still leaving some chunks of mushroom.  I did not add the sour cream, but at the final reheating I mixed 2 cups half’n’half with 2 cups sour cream. It was fabulous and received rave reviews.  I made it vegetarian by using veg. Broth.  My favorite comment, “it tastes like your eating a steak!”

Made just as written (with Hungarian paprika!) and it's fantastic with a loaf of crusty bread to go with it.  I've also used yogurt instead of sour cream before and the only thing is you have to really make sure it doesn't boil or it curdles.

This is a really solid recipe, it has a lot of great flavor and you can adjust the fat/salt/acid to personal tastes quite easily.

The only thing I'd leave for others making this is to make sure you pick a mushroom that has some flavor.  Your average white mushrooms won't do it justice.  I've made this with shiitake, oyster and portabella  mushrooms and each time it tasted almost like a different soup.

I used this recipe as a guide and made a vegan version, which turned out really good!
I used Earth Balance vegan butter, soy milk, no-chicken chicken bouillon for the broth, and hummus instead of sour cream! Yep, you read that right. The hummus gave it some tang and creaminess, as well as some protein. I kept everything else the same. I used baby bella mushrooms and chopped them up small.
 I don't know what the original version should taste like, but my vegan version is really tasty!

I made this soup for a potluck gathering. I tripled the recipe and it was a hit, it was gone before I knew it and people were looking for more. everyone was asking for the recipe. It was just like my Hungarian grandmother made for her holiday dinners. The only thing I changed I didn't put any lemon in it & it was still terrific!

Terrific soup!  Made it as directed and it was great.  Loved the flavor the dill adds.  It is definitely better the next day after the flavors meld.  Next time I make it I think I’ll add a splash of sherry before serving.

Fantastic recipe, similar tasting to a signature soup at a popular restaurant in my city.  I mostly followed recipe, but did change a couple of things:  combined onion, mushrooms and added a red bell pepper and finely pulsed in Cuisinart, then sautéed all in soup pan.  For flavor, I also added Better Than Bouillon (chicken).  I added half and half and the sour cream.  After completion, I puréed the soup in my Vita Mix and served it with crusty French bread and a light salad--rave reviews!  (The soup had great flavor without the heavy, earthy, mushroom essence).  This recipe is an elegant winter comfort food.

This was excellent.   I made it as written using a combination of shallots, leeks and sweet white for the onions.  Very rich.  The volume was perfect enough for 1 day of leftover which was just as good.   I agree with other reviewers , this is a soup you would be happy to be served at a restaurant!

It was good but nothing that really stuck out to me.  I used hot Hungarian paprika but would probably use half hot and half regular next time because it was too spicy for some people.

Per other reviews, replaced 4 TB butter with 2 TB olive oil, which cut about 30 calories per serving. Will definitely make this again!

I made it as described.  I did use leftover half and half instead of milk.  The flavor is amazing. The suggestion by one person to use the egg slicer on the mushrooms was wonderful.  Thank you.

Soups stands on its own, but perfect with homemade croutons.  Mix 2-4 cups bread pieces, 1/4-1/3 cup olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp onion powder.  Bake 10 min at 375.

Good flavor, very stroganoff-y, but this carnivore is screaming for meat. I’m sure it’d be amazing with beef or even chicken. Doesn’t make a lot. Double it if you’re feeding a family.

This soup was delicious. The only change I made was adding 2 cloves of minced garlic and sauteed with the onion. The next time, I will try it with smoked paprika. Definitely a keeper!

Made it mostly as stated but didn’t have unsalted butter so used salted butter. I waited till the end to add additional salt as called for  in recipe because I thought it might not need it, but it definitely did even with using salted butter. I also used fresh dill instead of dried. Everyone loved it!

This was delicious even without the parsley that wasn't available to me at the time.  I did have some reservation about the amount of dill weed called for, but decided to use the full amount and was happy with the result.  Will make this again as I made it this time - as written, except for the parsley!

This is tasty but it 1) seemed to need a bit more liquid to make the stated amount of servings, and 2) reminded me of a mushroom stroganoff without the noodles. I might just prefer the stroganoff next time.

We LOVE this soup!!  Basically made it as directed and didn't find there was too much lemon (I used fresh squeezed) or dill, but I LOVE dill.  Used 8oz white mushrooms, 8oz Baby Bellas, and 4 oz mixed blend of shitake, oyster and Crimini.  The only other addition was fresh minced garlic, because what recipe with onions and mushrooms doesn't have garlic?!  Great for a chilly night, or anytime!

This soup was really delicious!  I made it fir my husband and I to test out before making it fir company over the holidays.  It was easy to make and tasted rich and delicious even though it contains milk instead of cream.  The combination of pap rica, dill, soy sauce and lemon juice give s it a nice mild tang.

This wasn't too bad to make. I made some alternations--I've used Durkee's paprika, since I couldn't find either Hungarian paprika variety at any store. I've used regular mushroom instead of button and sliced the tops in thirds.  I've added the optional parsley at the end with croutons. I would make it again.

Delicious! I made this exactly as written- it reminds me of a vegetarian chicken poperkosh. We used our leftover soup over pasta, using the soup as a sauce! It was amazing- our new favorite way to enjoy this recipe!

Made this for dinner today, and me and my family loved it! We found the dill and lemon amounts to be perfect, but we're from Scandinavia and are used to/love a lot of dill flavor.

I used a bag of frozen mixed mushrooms in addition to the pound of fresh mushrooms (used button mushrooms) to make it extra mushroom-y, and used 2 cups of water and 2 bullion cubes instead of chicken broth, dropping the salt entirely (bc of the salt from the extra bullion cube).

I’ve made this a few times - a thick, hearty soup. The only change I make is substituting plain yogurt for the sour cream.

This is a staple in our house for years. It is an easy flavorful soup and easy to change based on what you have on hand. I have added broccoli and black beans and even spinach. It is always a hit in this house. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I’ve made this twice now. I double up on the paprika and soy. I add 2 good fistfuls of dried mushrooms in addition to the sliced white mushrooms. Instead of 2 cups chicken broth I do one cup chicken stock and one cup mushroom soaking liquid.  I also go a little extra on the sour cream.  The last time I made this I hit it with an immersion blender before the sour cream and laced it with a bit of sherry.  Perfect.

This was delicious! Only thing we did differently was use dried parsley flakes as opposed to fresh parsley. Perfect meal for a cold, cloudy day. 

Only thing I would note, however, is that the recipe seemed to make four servings as opposed to six.

I made this soup today! I did not make any changes and give it five stars because it is so tasty!! My son says it is the best soup he has ever had.  When I make this again, I will probably use less parsley but that is just a personal preference.  The recipe is delicious as is!

I simply love this soup. it is rich and creamy and the lemon and parsley added the perfect acidic touch. I modified it a little since I used vegetable broth instead of chicken since I am Vegetarian. I also used fat free milk and light sour cream, but the texture and flavor where perfect! we served this soup over brown basmati rice and it was simply a whole meal. Perfect for a cold day. I highly recommend this recipe.

WOW!  This is delicious. I will definitely make this more for Soup days! The flavors are amazing and work together perfectly. I used Shitake, Crimini and button mushrooms, and followed the recipe to the tee, just adding a bit more salt at the end, and about 1/4tsp black pepper.

This was very good! I did add extra seasoning including red pepper flakes, just to spice it up a tad, but would be very good without it too. It is a mushroom soup, so it is a lighter soup without a real strong flavor. We suggest serving with croutons or a flaky pastry instead of crackers.

My husband doesn't like soup, but always comments how he loves Hungarian Mushroom Soup.  I made one once before (with a different recipe) and he wasn't impressed.  THIS recipe, however, had him say "Mmmmm..." out loud.  It's delicious!

Easy prep.  Yummy flavor.  Not too creamy.  Some zing in the flavor!

I used baby Bella mushrooms and used chopped up garlic crostinis for croutons.

Excellent recipe.  Added a bit more Hungarian sweet paprika, fresh dill and chopped parsley.  For mushrooms, used fresh chanterelles,  giant oyster and creminis.  Authentic Hungarian taste.

For me,  this is a keeper.   The only change I made was I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream.  I did this because I did not have any sour cream but did have plain yogurt on hand.   I was looking for a recipe that was not "creamy."  Also, the ingredients in this recipe appealed to me.  This is definitely not  the traditional American cream of mushroom soup but has nice different flavors and not so calorie laden.

Really tasty! I made it for my husband and then to my family. They all loved it. It’s very easy to prepare and doesn’t take long to cook. ??

Best mushroom soup recipe I’ve tried! I blended most of it up once finished as husband isn’t keen on mushroom pieces, but he loved the flavours!

I made it 5 times so far. I love it, everyone loves it. I use hot paprika instead of regular one because spicy is better. It's now my favorite soup.

I followed the recipe except that before serving I stirred in about 2 -3 tablespoons of brandy.  I wanted to use sherry but didn't have any on hand.  I used 1 lb of Baby Bella mushrooms & 1/2 lb of button mushrooms.  I used the egg slicer as noted in a previous review.  It made quick work of slicing the mushrooms.  The flavors of all the ingredients made an incredibly tasty soup.  My husband LOVED it and commented that I did a fantastic job for my first time.   Thanks for the sharing this recipe.

this is really, REALLY good soup, especially if you're a mushroom lover. I've made it twice and will definitely make again and again.  only thing I didn't have was fresh parsley so used dry.  but otherwise this is mostly stuff I keep stocked in the house anyway.  bravo for this one.

Excellent mushroom soup. I made half a recipe which turn out beautifully. 2 tablespoons of white wine was used to thin  the soup. I poached cod in the soup and served with rice. The cod was a perfect addition to the very flavorful soup.

Amazing. It's also (nearly to the ingredient) the recipie i use for making jagerschnitzel gravy, which makes me feel even more fat. It's a soup! It's a gravy! It's really good on salisbury steaks, lol

hit the spot. so this original recipe is probably sooo delicious. but me and my husband are trying to eat 'clean'  for a month. so I changed some stuff. (I can't wait to just eat a cinnamon roll after this month is over though.) any way.  I used evoo instead of butter. and coconut cream instead of milk and tapioca starch instead of flour. still came out really good. and Google said sour cream is clean. so i put that too. soooooooo goooood!!

Double everything...so good! I didn't double the onion or mushrooms. Used 4 times the lemon juice.  Before adding the milk flour mixture I immersion blended the onion mushroom broth mixture.   Other reviewers suggested a little white wine, potatoes and or chicken. Maybe next time.Served it with multigrain bread with mashed avocado and TJ's Everything
Bagel seasoning.

This recipe was unbelievable! I was more than pleasantly surprised. I have to admit, I only purchased 8 oz. mushrooms (I was in a hurry and didn't pay attention). I honestly think that was enough mushrooms for the recipe. This will be a repeat recipe in our home.

I will add less parsley or none at all. Love the mushroom flavor.  I used a variety of mushrooms that Safeway had, no white or creminis were used in my soup. It was fantastic.

I made this, and I'm not a cook!  I did everything BUT the parsley, because I didn't have any and forgot to order it... still, came out wonderful!  I was surprised I could make something that delicious!  It was rich in body and texture.  Seriously, top restaurant food here!

I made this for a soup competition at work and needed a double batch.  Doubling the recipe worked perfect and remember, mushrooms cook down so do not be afraid!  Investing in a good paprika is a pro as others have recommended.  I found a hot Hungarian paprika that worked VERY well.  Slight notice of heat but great flavor.  Numerous compliments on the recipe, why not? it's a classic.  I really want to throw some homemade meatballs in this soup and let them simmer...

This is just delicious.  I've used a mix of mushrooms, no fat milk, no fat sour cream and it is rich and comforting.  I've recommended it to the guy I buy mushrooms from at our local farmers' markets.

I’ve had this recipe in my recipe box for years and finally tried it a couple of months ago.  I made it exactly as written, and it was exceptional.  Give it a try—you won’t be disappointed.

that was great! mushrooms weren't mushy, but tasted cooked and flavorful, flavor was great! the only alterations I made were adding a 1/4cup of real bacon bits half way through the first summer, then a generous pinch of the parsley to the second simmer stage to try and get more flavor mixing.

This was amazing. My partner and I just made it two days in a row because we liked it so much. However, I would say that this serving size of six makes more like three bowls.

I love this recipe!!! Holy moly. I wasn't expecting to love it so much. My goal was to make this soup a full meal with leftovers, so I doubled the recipe and added shredded chicken that i picked from a rotisserie. I also added garlic (and wasn't shy with it). I'm considering even making some rice to add another element of tummy filling  goodness. thank you for this recipe! I will be making it many times again!

Excellent. I enjoyed the original. Then I modified it. It's great both ways. I skipped the cream and used extra milk. I added cut green beans and a can of white kidney beans. I left out the parsley because I don't care for that myself.

I substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream (because I was out of it).  Followed recipe exactly except for that.  Fabulous!
Oh yes, I always taste before I add salt- -a pinch of sea salt worked for me.

This soup was easy and fast, but as a soup I can’t say it was my favorite. It wasn’t bad, but I wasn’t going back for seconds either. Might try the leftovers over some noodles to see how that goes.

What a great soup!  For the first time i always follow the recipe almost exactly. It's a really great tasting soup! I think next time I might use half and half or cream to make it a little thicker (just because I like thicker soup).  I'll be making this again & again! I've read people add potatoes or chicken.. so I might do that next.  :)

This was SO flavorful! Made as directed and used half crimini mushrooms and half "gourmet blend".  The only thing I changed was pureed at the end (since there was a weird texture from a rogue "gourmet" mushroom I hadn't experienced before). The savory dill was insanely good! Impressive enough for guests, quick and easy enough for a weeknight meal! 10/10 will make again!

The soup was so delicious and lovely.  I used vegetable broth and crimini mushrooms with tasty success.  Will serve it at family Thanksgiving for omnivores and vegetarians.

yes, this is the real thing. I followed the recipe to the T, except that I had 3 different kinds of mushrooms: Normal, Girolles, and Cepes. It was absolutely out of this world! Yum. Don't change anything else....

It was easy to make and delicious!  Omitted the onion due to diet restrictions and it was still great.  It really only does make 4 servings.  Will definitely make again.  Next time I will double it so I have more to eat later and will probably omit the lemon juice.  I could taste the lemon and did not care for it, I think that it will be just fine without it.

This is wonderful and worth the time. It's like a soup you would get in a good restaurant.

I used sliced baby bellas. They give an awesome flavor to recipes.

I made this soup exactly as the recipe says. It turned out wonderful! Flavorful, rich, and perfect for this Fall weather right now. Personally, I've discovered I'm not a huge fan of parsley in soup, so you'd maybe want to leave that out if you also aren't a fan. Going forward I think I will use some fresh dill instead, and leave out the dried dill. That is the only thing I would change for my personal tastes. This soup is wonderful just as it's written!

Super simple and I did what others suggested with the low sodium and low fat options. I would cut the amount of spices in half.

OMG, I made this soup today without changing one thing.  It was fabulous.  At first I was hesitant to add the dill but I am so glad that I did.  I have nothing to compare it too as I am not Hungarian or of any eastern European descent but I do NOT ever eat canned mushroom soup. This was more like what I have had only in the restaurants.  I did not simmer mine the entire time as it had reduced enough, nor did I add any salt, simply did not need it.  FIVE STARS (more if I could)

I added garlic and half a cup of white wine as well as fresh basil and thyme from the garden. I also used a collection of different mushrooms. It was excellent. And (in case this is of interest to you) this is full of anti-cancer superfoods (mushrooms and onions), especially if you use olive oil instead of butter.

Great soup, but I think what would have made it eye-popping is if I added some light cream cheese, maybe instead of sour cream, or at least half of each. I also think throwing a potato in and then blending partially could have made the roux unnecessary and be a healthier version.

4.5 stars actually. Just wasn't keen on the amount of parsley. I did half the recipe as I was using for tuna casserole instead of that canned stuff. I thought it incorporated into that dish well but because I'm on LCHF lifestyle, I used lecithin to thicken and instead of milk, heavy cream. Although I did use an immersion blender as someone in this household has a weird aversion to chewing on mushrooms unless they are teeny tiny bits. Good grief. Oh, I used fresh dill and smoked paprika. Thanks for the recipe, I think it's quite good even if you don't use flour or regular milk. I could eat it as a 'soup'  if I didn't have to cater to anybody else. : )

Made this twice , first with white button mushrooms and following the recipient exactly.  The second time I used a mix of white & portabella mushrooms, upped the quantity of mushrooms to about a pound and a half and used about three cups of onions. Also doubled the paprika using 50/50 regular and smoked. Awesome soup both times!

Used baby Portobellos and large ones, and skipped the milk and flour as not on my eating plan.  It was salty enough without the teaspoon of salt, and I added 1/4 C. of quick-cooking faro during the 15-minute simmer.  Reduced the parsley by 50%.  Delicious, and the house smelled wonderful!   Next time I'll double the recipe.

This is a tasty change to the regular cream of mushroom soup.  I made it exactly as written and rated it three stars because I found the dill overwhelming and way too much parsley.  I really liked the addition of the lemon - it really brightens up the flavour.  I wasn't sure about the taste until I added the lemon and the sour cream - nice and tangy!  I enjoyed it but wouldn't be able to eat more than a bowl because of the unique flavour - it's a little too much after awhile.

This is good but it seemed to take me a bit longer than expected.  If you want it to look nice, put a dollop of sour cream sprinkled with fresh dill or parsley and a lemon slice in each bowl.  I think it needed a little something extra, but couldn't put my finger on it.  Also, I wanted mine to have that golden yellow color that some of the photos have, but it was more brown.  Still good...thanks for the recipe!

This is a fire house favorite. To make it the best ever add a pound of hot Italian sausage to brown with the onions. Also we double the amount of paprika and dill.

I rarely review recipes, but I must for this one. I did adjust the broth to 4 cups and added a tad more of the dill and paprika, plus some chicken so my husband wouldn't gripe. The mix of flavors is wonderful though! I really want to try it with Hungarian paprika as somebody else suggested. Perhaps also cream instead of milk. Regardless of all the possibilities, it's definitely a must try for anyone who enjoys mushrooms!

Very good soup for us mushroom lovers! I did have to make a couple of changes though. So onions and I have a strange love/hate relationship. I love the flavor they produce but don't like the texture of them so what I did was use a packet of dried onion soup mix instead of fresh onions. Worked perfectly for me! Then mid way through the recipe I realized I didn't have any dill so I had to find a substitute there. Even with the changes it turned out delicious!

This is a wonderful soup!  I have made it several times, perfecting the recipe.  These are my three changes.  1) Use salted butter and do not add any additional salt. 2) Substitute portobella mushrooms for some or all of the mushrooms. 3) Substitute "Better Than Bouillon" brand mushroom base for the chicken broth.  4) Sometimes I use half smoked paprika and half regular paprika.  It keeps well and always receives raves.

This is a wonderful recipe. I make it as is except sometimes I throw in a touch of sherry or white wine when the shrooms are cooking. Sherry as an especially tasty sweetness to the soup. it's lovely without it ad well though.

I followed the recipe exactly as described. It was good; however, I felt there was too much dill. I think the mushrooms would be better chopped a little more finely rather than sliced. Overall, it was a good recipe and I enjoyed it but I didn't love it and wouldn't make it again.

This was really good! We don't care much for dill, so I swapped in rosemary instead, but otherwise no complaints. Delicious and fast dinner with a salad and some bread. Thanks!

Delicious, albeit -
1 heaping teaspoon dill (instead of 2 level)
1/2 the flour
1/2 the sour cream
The rest of the recipe was followed to the tee.
Oh wait. Small diced half the mushrooms. 
Medium thick sliced the rest. 
Still almost a mushroom stew. Nothing wrong with that.

Used crimini mushrooms and texture was a little "rubbery."  Would like soup thicker and next time will add more flour and maybe try white button mushrooms.  Definitely will make again--wonderful aroma,  just delicious, and so healthy!

This was a good soup recipe, simple and didn't take too long to make.  It tastes very earthy.  It does just taste like cream of mushroom soup but maybe that's because of the changes I made due to lack of ingredients.  I didn't have dill so I used herbs de provence.  The whole recipe makes about 6 cups of soup.  Good for maybe 2 or 3 people unless you are using this as an appetizer.  This was a good recipe for 1.

I made no changes, and served it up with a hot loaf of bread. I don't usually cook with dill, so this was a great, tasty recipe that I will be making again. I might try adding rabbit the next time I make this, but it does not *need* any changes!

Love it! Made it twice this week. My observation is that you can control how thick the soup is on the final 15 minute simmer session. The fist time I made it I only made a half batch since I was short on mushrooms. It was much thicker that time. For my third attempt I will simmer a full batch longer than 15 minutes as I enjoy thick rich soups. Also as you may have gathered from the other reviews, the amount of parsley the recipe calls for is perfect for someone who REALLY loves parsley. I used about 3/4 of the required amount and it was plenty for me. (I often add more than a recipe calls for as I like a lot.)

I did make slight changes, used garlic soy butter, fresh garlic and missed the paprika (thought I had some) but it turned out amazing and is on the do again soon list! It's thick and for a slight change add a bit more fluid? All in all, soooo good!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was wonderful! Even my son, who doesn't like mushrooms, ate it and enjoyed it. The soup was served with dinner rolls as the first course for our family New Years Eve dinner. It was the perfect start to our beef tenderloin and lobster feast, accompanied by au gratin potatoes and a simple Caesar salad.

I made this recipe to the T.  

No changes  (why do people do that?) If you're going to modify someone's recipe, then post it as your own.
 
My brother in law is 100% Polish, I sent him some of this Golomb Levese  (Mushroom soup -in Hungarian). He called me the same day to tell me this is the best mushroom soup he's had in all his 70 years, even better than the soup from his favorite Polish Deli.

Enough said.

I ate this soup at a friends dinner party and fell in love, although not with the actual soup but the possibilities I had in mind to soup it up (pun not intended).  She gave me the recipe she had hand written. (I just found it here on AllRecipes) I could hardly wait to make it, but waited for a dinner party at our  house. The name of the soup is kind of misleading. It isn't really Hungarian, just hints of Hungarian. Anyway, I made the soup this past Saturday, changing only a couple of things. I used 2/3 button mushrooms and 1/3 brown mushrooms (6 cups total) since that's all the grocery store had. Half the mushrooms I slices, the other half I chopped quite fine, for an interesting texture. I sauteed the onions, then added the mushrooms over high heat to saute and reduce the water that they sweated out.Once the water was mostly gone, I added the flour.  I added all the rest of the liquid at once. I omitted the parsley (because I forgot) and the soy sauce (it isn't Hungarian at all).  To serve I added a dollop of sour cream with a sprig of dill. Beautiful presentation and totally delicious soup. I'm making it again on Sunday for different guests.

I used a food processor to slice the onions and mushrooms. I prepped the two separate additions ahead of time while the onions and mushrooms were cooking.  I added the sour cream just 5 minutes before serving.  My wife loved it. We both had it for lunch the following day.  She liked it cold!

I've made this soup twice now, and it just gets better. It's quickly becoming one of my favourites. 

I didn't have any milk, so I used cream. And since the household is gluten free I omitted the flour. The cream helped to thicken the soup a bit.

10 stars!  Excellent!  First, make a double batch, you will thank me later!  I used white button, baby bella and a mix of crimini, shitake and other mushrooms.  Added in some diced potatoes at simmer - smelled amazing and our family and friends loved this!  Also ran some of the cooked mushroom/onion mix in the food processer to get a thicker texture.  Definitely going to make again and share this recipe!

I have had this in my favorites for a while and have been really looking forward to making this. I am SO glad I did. I am ridiculously picky and this was seriously the best soup I have ever had. I will surely double (maybe even triple?) the recipe next time because I just can't get enough. I used crimini mushrooms and went a little bit lighter on the lemon juice. I also didn't have sour cream so I used plain whole milk yogurt. Will definitely be making this again very soon. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very rich soup, filling, and a different, interesting flavor profile.  In the future, I recommend cutting back on the butter and sour cream.  Use half the butter called for, and mix a little EVOO in for a healthier alternative.  I also would use half the sour cream called for.  Delicious!

I really liked this soup but the pictures make it look even better. I didn't have parsley so I used oregano. And I added sherry. In the future, I think I'll try using lime instead of lemon.

Oh, really good, rich, full of flavor showcasing the mushrooms.  I made half a recipe and used dried parsley (2 tsp), no other changes. Half a recipe was only two servings for me. Will make again soon, whole recipe next time and fresh parsley. Thanks!

Fantastic.  I made slight changes: used homemade beef stock in lieu of chicken; added a bit more salt likely because my stock did not have salt in it; I used 3/4 C skim milk plus a generous 1/4 C heavy whipping cream b/c that's what I had; and I upped the sour cream a bit.  I used baby bella mushrooms.  End result was a delicious, rich soup.  Next time I will add a splash of sherry to it and back off on the amount of parsley.  (I used fresh parsley from my herb garden so it may be "stronger" than store bought.) Hubby loved it. But he's easy ; )

This turned out very good. It ended up just making me feel like I was eating Hungarian Goulash that was missing something though, lol. So I boiled some egg noodles and added them. That made it more hearty and hit the spot. I will definitely be making this again.

Loved the soup. A few modifications made it for me; beef stock instead of chix, smoked paprika for a third of the total paprika. Next time I'll be adding chopped kale or spinach also.

My boyfriend made this for me. This soup was… Incredible. I have no words! Rich, earthy, complex. I am pretty sure he accidentally used smoked paprika, and skipped parsley (I don't think parsley is necessary)...but followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was RIDICULOUS! I will say that the serving amount seems skewed. This was enough for probably three dinner servings.

Followed recipe as written.  I did substitute low fat yogurt for the sour cream at the end.  Great use for abundance of mushrooms, made a nice vegetarian meal too.
I will be adding this to my rotation of delicious soups for the winter.

Big hit with vegetarian guest (veg stock) and my 11 yr old daughter! Loved the flavors. I only added some grated carrot and wild rice because it was the main dish. I didn't have paprika so had to use a bit of cayenne and a bit of smoked paprika but only 1/2 t. each so cannot vouch for paprika amount.

Only change is that I doubled it and cooked the mushrooms and onions for about 30-35 minutes, not just 15.  Served with sour cream and fresh dill on top.  Edit: Made the 2nd time, as we CRAVE this soup.  Added about 1 tsp dried thyme (again, I doubled the recipe), as thyme and mushrooms are a divine combo.

I've now made this soup twice. The second time around, I used half the butter and probably somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 cup of sour cream.  The soup came out every bit as rich after cutting back on some of the fattening ingredients. I am vegetarian, and enjoy a hearty soups.   I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth.  At the end, I used a hand blender to purée about one third of the soup, adding more texture. 

This is one of my favorites; decadent and professional flavor, without much fuss. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

Use an imersion belnder.

First time I made this I liked it but my wife wasn't a big fan because of the texture of the mushrooms. Next time around I used an immersion blender at the end to smooth it and we both thought it was way better.

I made this last night.   I used salted butter but omitted adding additional salt.   I felt like my mushrooms were still a little too crunchy so I would cook them longer the next time, even though I simmered the soup twice as long as it said.   The flavor was good.   It was more filling than I would have expected.   It makes about 6 servings--not a lot.

So much better than predictable cream of mushroom soup. I made a 1-1/2 x recipe, following instructions except that I also added one can (with juice) of Rotel diced tomatoes. I really like the bold flavor. Next time, I would make a bit more of the liquids and spice according to the increase and would cut the sliced mushrooms in half, lengthwise. Update: I've made this 3-4 times now and like it to be a tad less creamy so I add more stock. Also, I find a tablespoon or so of good sherry wine vinegar as a good addition at the end.

My whole family loved it!! 

I made it vegetarian friendly by substituting vegetarian broth for the chicken broth & I used almond milk instead of regular milk.

It was a really delicious blend of flavors. Plus, the soup thickens if you keep it on low and it becomes so creamy!

I made this soup today & loved it!  I did not have dill, I do not like it, I used oregano instead.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh.  I cannot wait to make this again!

Many years ago I had a Forest Mushroom soup at Panera bread.  I liked it so much but it seemed they stopped making this. 

I was so happy to find this recipe.  It might even be better than Paneras. 

I often mix varieties of mushrooms with this recipe and always have been pleased with the results.

This is a beautiful, creamy and ever so rich mushroom soup that tastes even better on day two (if it lasts that long).  I have experimented with a variety of mushroom types and love blending more exotic mushrooms along with the white to enhance the flavor.

I made this using fresh wild chanterelle mushrooms and followed the recipe exactly.  I've never been a soup fan but I absolutely LOVE this soup!!  It makes just enough that you're still loving it by the time it's all gone.

So yummy!!!  I followed some of the advice in the reviews.  I used an assortment of mushrooms and chopped them smaller before adding them.  Also, before serving, used an immersion blender a little bit to chop them further, leaving an assortment of sizes.   Added the sour cream on top when serving, rather than mixed in.  
Definitely make a double batch!

Delicious! I used dried chanterelle mushrooms, and added a pinch of hot pepper flakes. I also thickened the leftovers into a gravy and served over noodles the following day. Will definitely try again.

My husband and I loved this soup. Didn't have parsley, only had hot paprika which made this soup a sinus opener!! This is very comforting, yummy soup. Easy to make.

This is the third time I’ve made this and I love its versatility.  Using both shiitake and portobello, I afforded some thicker slices.  This time, about 5 chopped cloves of garlic after adding the mushrooms.  At the time of adding the broth, I also chose to add 1/4 cup each of sweet and dry vermouth.  Also used full fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  My family has lived this recipe in the past and loves this version also.  Use vegetable broth and you have a true vegetarian version!

This soup is so good!!! The paprika is wonderful! I used 1 tsp of dill and squirted one small wedge of lemon. Added 2 cloves garlic. I used 1 and 1/2 med onions. It was delicious. I will have to make a double batch next time. The broth is so good. We sat and ate a loaf of bread and butter with that broth. So good.

I've made this soup a few times now and I love it! I use vegetable broth instead of chicken because I'm a vegetarian. I also use less mushrooms than the recipe calls for because I prefer my soups less chunky. Fresh dill instead of dried, and I skip the lemon because I don't think the flavour blends well in this soup. Highly recommend!

I scaled this down to 4 servings, and skipped the salt (wasn't needed, as the chicken broth I used was salty enough).  I really enjoyed this, served with toasted garlic-parmesan bread for a light dinner tonight. This soup is very rich, and a little bit goes a long way. Elegant enough for a first course for a dinner party.  The kids were not too crazy about it, but what do they know!

The flavors in this soup are savory and takes minimal ingredients to make! Reccomendations: If you don't have sour cream you can use plain yogurt at the end, and use about 1/2 tsp less flour than it calls for; I had some flour clumps in my soup.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written. No substitutes or extras. The soup was just ok in my opinion. Definitely not the best soup I've ever had as some folks claim. Would I make it again? Maybe, but would definitely cut down on the parsley next time.

Such an amazing soup.  I am from Czech heritage and my mother made paprika chicken all the time.  I add chicken to this recipe and it is paprika chicken.  So good.  I didn't change anything else.  Just bought chicken, boiled in salted water - used that for the chicken broth and cut up the chicken and added it to the soup.  Love this.  Have it at least once a month.

Omg! Wonderful soup!! Other than a splash of cooking sherry, I followed the recipe. I used combo of different mushrooms. Highly recommend to all mushroom fans. Definitely a keeper. It is a small batch so u may want to double if cooking for many

We thought it was lacking mushroom flavor. To us it just tasted like a bland creamy soup.

I used half and half instead of milk, for a bit more richness, and cayenne pepper instead of black pepper for a bit more zing, personal preference. It is a fantastic soup, and a quick and easy one.

It was delicious, but perhaps a bit too buttery. I think next time I will use half butter and half olive oil. Also, I only happened to have fat free milk at home, but I think this soup would benefit from using milk with a bit more fat. I also added a little bit of chopped fresh garlic when I sautéed the onions.

I made a few changes--doubled broth, added 2 cloves garlic, used 1/2 amount of dill,  1T dried parsley.   Definitely make again because it's quick, easy and filling.  Some quinoa added would be good too I think,  but nice as is. Tasty!  Thank you!

Made it twice LOVE IT...so tasty...used reg salted butter and greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Used sweet smoky hungarian paprika. Next time I will double and freeze half, will add yogurt when I heat to serve. Very impressive dish. My grandson even loved it.

For me, the taste was weird, and I tend to have a rather wide taste palate. Perhaps I'm just not as familiar with Hungarian cooking, though:).

Tastes like what I'd tend to think of as an authentic Hungarian bowl of soup ;-)

It's simply not my personal preference. I've got to give it a full five stars after reading the reviews here because it definitely deserves to be propagated out there yonder.

Not fully my style, but it was pretty good and I would definitely make it again if I were short on mushroom soup recipes, because the cream of mushroom soups, though I like them, tend to get dull and boring sometimes. Which was why I picked this uh, rarity.

I'm seriously wondering how this recipe would fare with turnips/potatoes and clams, mushrooms or no, because there was something about that flavor combo :-)

I used 2 cans of chicken broth rather than 2 cups, so then I increased most of the other ingredients by a little bit.  I also used 1% milk and low-fat sour cream.   I was a little worried about how the dill would taste but it was great!  My husband and I thought this was excellent and I will definitely make it again.

Yes, I made changes.  I used all the full amounts of ingredients (ignore  people complaining about the parsley). I used smoked paprika, changed the milk to unsweetened almond milk, and used gluten free flour.
It was delicious.

Making a new recipe, I usually follow it exactly. I only had Progresso Tuscany Broth in my pantry, not chicken. I don't think I will even give it a try with plain chicken broth.  This is so good, I could eat it every week!

Wowzers! I used a mixture of wild mushrooms and store bought shitakes. I approximately doubled the amount of mushrooms. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of cayenne. This soup was heavenly. I highly recommend it.

I've made this soup every week since I first made it a few months ago. It is so soothing and delicious. I omit the sour cream - I used it the first time but I didn't think it added much and wanted to reduce the calories. I *highly* recommend this soup for anyone who likes mushrooms. It is easy to make and has a lot of flavor. Yum Yum!

I liked it, my wife loved it, my daughter detested it. My wife has requested that it become a monthly dinner. I was faithful to the directions as I try to be the first time otherwise you end up rating a different recipe. I would agree with other posters that the taste will be nothing like a typical cream of mushroom soup. It has  a cleaner taste, maybe from the lemon juice. I made it with grilled cheese sandwiches and it was perfect for a really cold February night. The three of us ate all but 1 cup, so larger families may want to double up when making this dish.

This made a yummy and comforting  soup on a cold, rainy day.. I followed exactly, except by omitting the salt (my broth wasn't the low sodium kind)  and it delivered a thick and chunky soup, with a rich mushroom flavor. But, the con.., it only makes 4 medium servings..

This soup is awesome! At least that's what co-workers told me when I shared the leftovers with them the other day. I really have to agree. So much so that I am making it four days later. I wouldn't change a thing about this soup! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I already had the onions and mushrooms cooking in a stick of butter when I went in search of a recipe, so I didn't follow it to a T, but pretty closely and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I'm thinking next week I'm going to cook some chicken breasts in it to serve over rice.

Living in Hungary I've never known a Hungarian recipe to have soy sauce, but there's a first for everything! Tried it anyway and although I couldn't detect it this soup turned out fabulous! The real test is to make it for the mother-in-law. If she'll like it then This will be a staple in my magyar konyha!

Excellent flavourful soup.  I used crimini and white mushrooms/ buttermilk in place of milk and 2 Tbsp dried parsley instead of fresh.  Next time I will add a bit of Tarragon, which goes wonderfully with mushrooms, helping to bring out their earthy flavour.

This soup is absolutely delicious!  It is one of my favorite soup recipes.  The only modifications I make are to cut back on the salt and add a little more chicken broth so it is not quite so thick.  I also use low fat ingredients and it is still very creamy and rich tasting.  Highly recommended.

Exceptional.  I used half the parsley as others had suggested and added it with the milk to cook down a bit.  Added 1/2 tsp of Maggi Seasoning.

I will definetly make it again.
I made my own chicken stock on my because I had ingredients on hand.
I am lactose intolerant so I used silk milk .
I also did not add the sour cream.  In its place I put 2 extra tablespoons of flour.
Still delicious.

So good that I wanted to eat the whole pot in one sitting!! Haha...but no, too filling! I followed this as close to a T as I could...only a slight tweak that no one would even notice. I never have milk in the fridge, so I just made my own using a hand full of raw cashews and water blended till smooth in a blender. I used all organic ingredients and organic grass fed butter...not unsalted. One more thing, I suggest slicing the mushrooms on the slightly thicker side. You can't go wrong with this soup as long as you love mushrooms!! ENJOY!

No changes.  Exquisite.  I was worried there was too much paprika in this, but it was perfect.  The only thing is maybe next time add a touch more of soy sauce.  But not really needed. Loved it.

Yummy! I added celery, green onion, extra parsley, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, cornstarch instead of flour, using what I had available: lamb broth, vegetable broth, 2 beef bouillon cubes. I think those are the only changes... Increased soy with low sodium soy sauce.. That's about it I think. A very yummy low calorie, gluten free soup :)

Made this soup for lunch yesterday and my husband, my 21 month old daughter and I all loved it! I followed the recipe to a tee and it was delicious and a great change up from the normal soups we turn to on cold days. I'll be saving this one.

The base recipe is outstanding.  I wanted a meal in a bowl, so added celery, carrots, potatoes, and mixed greens (kale, spinach), along with some sweet Italian sausage.  It was awesome before I added the extra stuff and equally as good after.  My kids devoured it.

Superb! I did not have dill weed so I substituted with tarragon. Did not have sour cream so I left it out and I think it was for the better.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe and will definitely make it again, although, I did make some changes. I cut the mushrooms in smaller pieces and sautéed them separately before adding to the onions. I added 3 tablespoons butter instead of 4. As well, we did not add the sour cream.  Thanks for sharing.

Super good. Used two onions and a mix of white and baby bella mushrooms. Added a few splashes of sherry while cooking the mushrooms. Used almond milk, light sour cream, and 10 shakes of dried parsley otherwise followed everything else exactly.

I'm not a big fan of Dill but I loved this soup. I did cut the Dill in half but you really can't substitute with any other herb and expect it to taste the way it's intended. The flavors are well rounded and this robust soup will definitely be on the rotation.

Excellent and is easy to put together. I went with half portabello and half white mushrooms. I'm thinking a little sherry would work well in this. Very rich and comforting soup on a cold winter day! UPDATE 10/8/19: Used evaporated milk and omitted the sour cream. Still delicious and creamy. Had fresh parsley on hand, but just used a small amount, not 1/4 cup.

This was great! Very flavourful. Makes for a nice change from regular cream of mushroom soup. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. It was really good but very spicy, almost overbearingly so. The second time around I cut the dill down to 1.5 tsp and cut the parsley in half. (If you're using dry that would be 2 Tbsp). I also omitted the sour cream all together. It was really good this way & everyone liked it better. I think it's one of those recipes that every time you make it it tastes a teeny bit different as you play around with it and see what you like best. Either way it's a great recipe and I will definitely be making it again & again.

this was very rich and decadent.. i made some slight modifications but i think i stayed true to the intent of this recipe.. i halved the dill, used my homemade chicken stock for the broth, subbed almond milk for regular milk, cornstarch (1/3) for the flour, kosher salt for the table salt, greek yogurt for the sour cream, dried parsley for the fresh and halved the amount.. i was almost completely out of lemon juice so i had to do half lemon/half white vinegar.. i think if i had used canned chicken broth and table salt i'd agree with other reviewers about it being salty.. me and bf agreed that this would be great with some rice or egg noodles.. ty for the recipe

I used Cremini mushrooms. Although I did add the sour cream I thought it was rich enough and may not use in future. Used Hungarian paprika we bought in Budapest ... 3/4 sweet, 1/4 hot. This was so delicious definitely will make again & again. I did not have parsley so none of that and used orange juice instead of lemon since that was a lemon juice substitution according to Uncle Google. Highly recommend:)

Great recipe - and yes - very easy.  I used fat free greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and it's delicious!  Next time I think I'll add garlic to saute with the onions and try tarragon in place of dill.  I'm not a big dill fan but still love the soup.  I also added additional lemon juice to taste and shredded chicken from a store bought roaster.  Complete meal and full of healthy proteins!

I personally classify this as my favorite soup. I made it once and tried to get my husband to try it. He hates mushrooms so he wouldn't try it. Second time I made a double. Took it to work with great response.  Even had two people say they weren't that crazy about mushrooms but they loved this. Hubby doesn't know what he is missing but that means more for me

This was waaaay too salty and I didn't even add any salt. I guess it was the soy sauce, I will be careful next time.

A fabulous, elegant soup!  Made it for the first time today and LOVED it.   Based on other reviews I used fresh dill instead of dried for a milder flavor and it was just perfect.

This is our family’s absolute favorite soup! I pretty much stick to the original recipe but I do use baby Bella mushrooms...we just like them more...more flavorful! I use my own homemade chicken broth and I do add more sour cream and lemon juice than the recipe calls for. I use fresh parsley in the summer when I have it available in my garden but I use dry parsley in the winter months and no one ever noticed the difference.. I definitely use the amount of dill the recipe calls for...I think the dill is the secret ingredient..plus the lemon juice! A wonderful recipe!

I made this as written but doubled in quantity.  I used a mix of baby bellas and shiitake mushrooms.  This came together easily and was well received.  Next time I will try a different mix of mushrooms and see how it goes.

So, i made a lot of changes to it.
First, i did not have a lot of ingredients, like Dill weed, parsley, paprika and sour cream.
so, i put some mini bacon cubes to the first saute along with garlic, and i added potatoes to the chicken broth.
I used fresh shiitake as mushroom. 
i loved it, it's an easy recipe and it's pretty good, will cook this again anytime...

This is one of my favorite recipes on here, if not THE favorite. The only changes I did was add sautéed cubed chicken breasts for a meat and spinach for extra vegetables. It is amazing.

After eating a bowl of Hungarian Mushroom Soup in a local restaurant, I did a  search for a similar recipe online. This one fit the bill and delivered the same great taste. The soup is velvety rich and has a lovely flavor.  If you are not a dill lover, this may not be for you but it is an elegant dish and suitable for entertaining. It tastes much better if you make it one day ahead and allow the flavors to mingle overnight.  Just wait to add the sour cream before serving.  This will be a standard in my kitchen from now on.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made! I doubled the recipe and used half regular mushrooms and half baby portabello mushrooms.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making this soup again and again and again!

This makes enough to fill 2 cereal bowls, so double or triple the amounts if this is a main dish for a large group. Great tasting and easy soup though!

I would recommend mincing the parsley (or blending); the texture did nothing for the soup (I'd've rather had a consistent creaminess w/ nice plump mushrooms).

Maybe go easy on the lemon as well?

Overall, really nice/simple recipe.

Just made for lunch and we both loved it.  I added 2 medium Yukon gold potatoes with the broth.  Found it needed about 1t. kosher salt and 1/2 t. pepper at the end.  Will make again often when mushrooms are on sale.  I used
baby belles, I find the have more flavor and hold up better in soups and stews.

This recipe was great. I used Hungarian spicy Paprika which gave it a nice kick. I also used low sodium chicken stock and soy sauce. Next time I will taste the soup before adding salt. A little too salty for my taste but the husband loved it!  Thanks!

Flavor of the soup was very good. However, I did think there was too much onion in it. I like onions but there was almost the same amount of onions as there was mushrooms.

This was AWESOME tonight for dinner.  Served simply with crackers, I don't think I've ever had a better soup.  Followed instructions exactly except I used half/half cream instead of milk but next time, I think I'll just use the milk.  What a great soup!! Will be repeating this one often so thanks for posting.

This is awesome. Easy. Inexpensive even using shiitake and criminis. Doesn't suffer from simmering a bit longer than the directions state, making it super forgiving if you're multi-tasking.  Make it.

I don't even like mushrooms much, but my father is obsessed—we both LOVED this recipe.  I substituted beef stock for chicken and because my father is trying to put on weight, heavy cream for the milk. 

We tried it as is, and we tried half of it blended in the vitamix—great both ways. I diced up a few raw shiitakes super tiny for a bacon-bits style garnish. 

We can't wait to warm up the leftovers over toast for brunch tomorrow.

I don't usually review the recipes I try but this one was extremely good.  It has just started to turn cold, and this being the first day of fall, I decided to  make a soup.  This one really hit the spot.  It was easy to prepare and flavorful.  The only thing I changed was the paprika.  The recipe didn't specify sweet or hot, so I used 2 teaspoons of Penzeys Spices' half sharp Hungarian Paprika, and that was perfect.  I will be making this one again for sure.

This  is a very good soup, you can actually forego the dairy  and blend to make it vegan.

Most excellent!  I added just a bit of grated aged horseradish cheddar cheese on top of the bowls just before serving that   I happened to have and this was absolutely delicious!

I made this for my mom's birthday.  She is Hungarian and I was trying to make her an Hungarian themed dinner.  This was a big hit.  Everybody loved it, including my kids.  I'm always trying new recipes and don't make the same things very often, but my husband and kids all said they hope to see this soup on the dinner table again.  Besides "delicious", my mom's only comment on the soup was that it is fancier than the mushroom soup her mom used to make.  -- Changes I made.  I only have skim milk in my house and I thought this recipe should use whole milk.  So I combined 1/2 cup of skim with 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  I also combined 8oz of baby bella mushrooms and 8oz of mixed gourmet blend mushrooms.

This is delicious!  If you like french onion soup, you'll like this.  It tastes like french onion soup with chunks of mushroom and a bit of dill flavor. 

I made it according to the directions using baby portabello mushrooms.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I subbed with half the amount of dried. 

My husband and I loved it, but the kids wouldn't eat it.

I am sure it would have been better if I splurged on expensive paprika, but with regular paprika and made the recipe as written, we were underwhelmed.

This was absolutely the best mushroom soup ever.  Made the recipe exactly as written except used the salted butter and didn't add the other salt.  My family loved it!  Will definitely make this over and over again.

Excellent! I only had hot paprika on hand and used two tsp. it gave it a little kick which was really very tasty. Will buy regular and try again and see which we prefer. I'm sure either way will be a winner!

Seemed bland to me.  I measured everything exactly, including weighing the mushrooms (baby bellas).  When I put in the milk/flour mixture, it became so thick that it was no longer like soup, even though I used the right amount of flour.  I had to add more chicken stock just so it would not be a glob of goo.  If I make it again, I will omit or decrease the flour b/c the soup is plenty thick without it.  I also had to bump up the soy a little (before adding the additional stock, but I left out the tsp of salt).  It seemed rather flavorless before I put in the extra soy, lacking the umami we all crave.  If I make it again, I may try putting just a tad of beef stock in it or some fish sauce to amp up the umami.  1/4 C parsley is enough & it should be chopped very finely.  

This soup is okay, but I just don't think it has that great a melding of flavors.  Now that I read one review that it's originally a Moosewood Cookbook recipe, that may explain the initial blandness.  So many of their recipes must be altered to provide any flavor.  Maybe it will be better after it sits for a day & I'll change my tune or maybe it's my taste buds.  In fact, as I finish the bowl while writing this, I have to admit it is growing on me, which could mean that it needs to be served less than piping hot.  UPDATE 07-18-15:  After letting this soup sit for a day or two in the refrigerator it takes on more flavor.  A combo of mushroom varieties helps too and letting it cool down before eating.

I've made this recipe many times and it's definitely one of our very favorite soups!! I always follow the recipe exactly although I let every individual add their own lemon, sour cream & pepper to taste after serving and I must say those three components make a WORLD of a difference in flavor!! Can't stress that enough. I made this soup for my mother in law before, who I will add is a mushroom fanatic, and at first she didn't like it because she didn't add those three items then after I stressed to her to add them & try it again she did and her head spun, eyes lit up and was amazed at how drastically different it tasted. Try it! You won't regret it. Allrecipes is simply the best!!!!

Awesome simple soup. We love it. I used beef broth instead as that's what I had and wasn't sorry, will keep it that  way with baby bellas gave a nice full meaty flavor. It's a monthly meal now and can even be made on a week night!

This is the best Mushroom soup I have ever had! It is creamy, rich in flavor, the parsley, lemon and sour cream as the finishing touch......Amazing! I wouldn't change a thing, except if I could have found this recipe years ago I would have been making it all the time. Regret is such a sad thing. Thank you! Love this recipe. Everyone needs to try this one. Follow exactly and you won't be disappointed.

My husband, who doesn't like mushrooms, was willing to taste it, and loved it! My 4 and 6 year olds also both really liked it. I thought I'd have leftovers for the week, but we ate it all! I used shiitake and cremini mushrooms, cut the salt in half, and added garlic and a splash of wine (because garlic and wine make everything better). I will definitely make this again!

I've made this recipe twice now, exactly as written, and it is a HUGE hit! The perfect menu is serving this with a tossed salad with a light dressing to balance the richness of the soup, and crusty French bread. My 87 year old mother has a favorite restaurant she goes to just for their Hungarian mushroom soup, and she proclaimed this every bit as good or better!

I was a bit reluctant to try this (or any other) mushroom soup because I absolutely despise canned Cream of Mushroom soup. However, I can't tell you how much I LOVED this Hungarian style soup!
This recipe, UP TO Step #3, can be made a few days ahead and refrigerated. I think this allows the flavours to meld more successfully. Whenever you're ready to serve it, warm it up then add the five ingredients listed in Step #3 and you're good to go.
The only changes I made were to use only 1/8 cup of fresh parsley and reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I chose to use full-fat sour cream to give it a creamy richness.
This soup is easy enough for a family weeknight meal but special enough to serve at a fancy dinner party.

I added 4 slices of bacon, chopped, fried to a crisp. Saute vidalia and 4 garlic cloves in the bacon fat. Used heavy cream instead of milk. Omitted the sour cream. Added chopped green onions before serving instead of parsley. Yummy!

This is a really nice mushroom soup, very hearty and comforting on a cold snowy night. The only modifications I made included dicing the onions and mushrooms and using about a 1/4 cup of neufchatel cheese instead of the sour cream.

I made the recipe last week and shared the soup with my neighbors.  We loved it! The kicker was that one of my neighbors dislikes mushrooms intensely (which I did not know),  but called right away for this recipe after she reluctantly tried the soup. Her husband is still chuckling over her reaction. 

I made it as directed and we wouldn't change a thing. I included cooked Jasmine rice leftovers in  the leftover mushroom soup and it was a heartier version of the original. A perfect lunch.

I made this soup exactly as the recipe states, except that I substituted 1/2 pound mushrooms for 1/2 pound ground beef.  I know that's a significant change, but I don't think that the flavor of the soup changed greatly because the seasoning were the same.  That said, the soup was okay; it didn't excite me.  It has a strong paprika and sour cream flavor.  In fact, it reminded me a lot of stroganoff, but not as good.  Also, it was more of a stew than a soup.

Yum! Made to a T, and we really enjoyed this on a cold snowy day in Ohio.  I didn't have fresh Parsley, so used 1 tsp dried.  Everything else remained the same, and it turned out beautifully.  Served this with some herb italian bread with olive oil, balsamic, and roaster garlic to sop it up with and hubby was singing my praises.  We will be making this again just as it is written.  No changes needed in my book.  Thanks for a great recipe! Update: We have needed to make some dietary changes.  I have started using 2 Tblsp Olive oil in place of the butter, Almond milk for the milk, backed down the salt and sour cream to 1/4 a cup.  It's still very good!!!

This Mushroom Soup was great!!  I always try new recipes exactly as written with the exception of the salt.  I figure that you can always add more salt but can't take it out.  I accidentally used 1 tbsp of lemon juice instead of the 2 tsps that it called for.  It still turned out delicious.  Will definitely make this again but I will double the recipe for leftovers.

Delicious!  Few minor tweaks: I only added 1/2 tsp of lemon juice because I'm not a lemon fan and also I only had on hand 1 1/4 tsp of dill but I love it and will definitely will make this soup again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We really enjoyed this soup. I added leftover turkey and a handful of baby spinach since this was our main dish. I served it with some homemade whole wheat French bread.

what this soup was really lacking was flavor. by that i mean the base was bland. but on the upside the vegetables came out great with the seasonings in the recipe. i recommend using fresh dill and don't hesitate to add sour cream during the process of cooking as the recipe stated. it makes a huge improvement.

This is a wonderful soup.  I too used an immersion blender to help thicken it and omitted the dill. I will make this again.
Update: I froze portions of this and it was just as good the second time around.  maybe better, I am upping this to 5 stars.

This is hands-down the BEST soup I have ever eaten. I have made it 5+ times and it turns out AMAZING every time. It has become my go-to soup when friends/coworkers need meals delivered and I've gotten nothing but RAVE reviews. I do use more mushrooms just because I have had great luck finding them on sale. I've used a variety of kinds though usually I use 1.5lb of baby bellas and 4-8 oz of the "exotic blend". Amazing with homemade onion bread!

I made this and it was delicious! It was at par with something I would order in a high end restaurant! Even my picky boyfriend, who doesn't even like mushroom soup, loved it. The flavor was really different, the lemon was surprisingly good. I substituted thyme for dill, as I didn't have any. I didn't use parsley because I don't like it. I will be making this again, without a doubt. Be sure to double or triple the recipe, as it doesn't make very much.

MAKE IT VEGAN!  I modified this recipe, using unsweetened almond milk, vegan sour cream and butter instead of dairy, and the taste is INCREDIBLE!  Not only is it ridiculously easy to make, it is fairly low in calories ( i can only speak for the vegan version but combined, the ingredients I used came up to under 1100 calories or 183 per serving). Try this one...you won't regret it!

This was by far the tastiest soup I've made! I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was perfect. The only difference is I probably added more freshly ground pepper because I like it! It was creamy and full of mushroom flavor. It was even better the next day for leftovers. The amount made following this recipe gave me about two large bowl size servings plus a small serving leftover. If you are serving this as a dinner meal and are serving more than 1 cup portions, I'd double or triple the recipe. Next time I make it, I'll be doing this so that my husband and I can eat more leftover! Was super easy to prepare and didn't take much time for the amount of deliciousness it served up!

So delicious!  This is the second time I made this. The only change I made was using 1 cup of broth instead of 2. I like my soups thick!  Next time, I'll use a few different types of mushrooms.

I made this today for a soup cook-off and it was a HUGE hit!  Very flavorful and easy to make.  I subbed a half cup of heavy whipping cream with a half cup of water for the milk.  I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is so perfect. The only thing I changed was the cook time; DBF was an hour later than I had planned, so I simmered the broth part for way longer before adding the milk part. Just had to save a little for my lunch today, can't wait, thanks so much for the recipe!

Tasty soup.  But you definitely do not need to add the 1 tsp. of salt!  I didn't include it and still found it too be rather salty.

Delicious soup! Used mix of shitake, oyster and baby portabellas. Improvised with lime juice as forgot to buy lemons. Easy and yummy! Will definitely make it again and again... My husband loved it too.

I add some thyme, sage, and dried parsley with the mushrooms. I love this recipe and make it often during our long winters.

I find it a little bit sour. Next time I would omit the lemon juice or maybe put a little less sour cream but other than that the soup was a hit. I will definitely make it again.

Fabulous and Easy! I had a container of mushrooms to use up in the fridge so I thought I would give this a try - the only different I did was used dried parsley flakes as I did not have fresh. This is simple to make and so delicious! I brought to work and my co-worker asked for the recipe after the first bite so I gave her half my bowl of soup and the recipe. Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe that uses staple ingredients in my house.

This is the best mushroom soup we've ever had. The onion and dill weed really make a good combination with the mushrooms. It is not as heavy as other creamed soups. It is also easy and quick to make. The hardest part is slicing the onions and mushrooms.

Excellent flavor!  The flavors remind me very much of my hungarian goulash.  My suggestions are to skip the salt at the end, use hungarian paprika, skip the flour (doesn't need it with the milk and sour cream)  and possibly add ground beef, tiny meatballs, stewing beef or chicken plus a handful or two of cooked rice for a complete meal.  We like our protein.  A salad and bread wouldn't cut it, and we're gluten free.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't have broth so I used water and chicken bouillon. I also used corn starch instead of the flour.  Used 4 packages (2 lbs) of regular white mushrooms based on other reviews and added a tablespoon of sherry.  Otherwise as written.  Hearty even without meat.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe caught my eye because it had very few ingredients... it shows in the final product; although it is basic, it is not bad (very tasty, my boyfriend devoured it, I like it with a bit of extra sour cream).
I made the mistake of making this soup as a meal... this soup does NOT eat like a meal and will leave you extremely unsatisfied... give it a fighting chance and make it as a side/to compliment a main dish.

Great soup; hubby likes it better than French Onion.  The dill is what sets it apart from anything else.  Made it a couple of times now.  I barely sauté mushrooms so they stay a little crisper.

Don't need as much butter, add some chicken bouillon too.
Used thyme as had no parsley. Excellent! Used canned mushrooms, so next time cut them,  large slices didn't "chew" right.

Ab-so-lute-ly loved this! I used half and half mixed with water instead of milk and Greek yogurt in place of sour cream. I also added some chili paste (I like spicy), and this just might be my new favorite soup. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I INHALED this soup; it was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I changed was to cut down on the salt, omit the lemon because I didn't happen to have it on hand, and add a little more milk at the end so it wasn't quite so thick.  And the thickness may have been me; I eyeballed the 2 tbsp. of flour and might have used a little more than that.  This will definitely be a favorite recipe!

This soup was DELICIOUS!! I only had dill seed instead of dill weed, but it was still good. I also added shredded rotisserie chicken to make it more hearty.  Added more lemon juice too, but I loved it!! Thanks for posting! !

This soup is fantastic. I didn't have paprika when making it because I'm in the middle of moving and haven't fully unpacked yet. Needed to use mushrooms anyway, so I went ahead and made it. It was so good I can't imagine how it could be any better! I add a few tsps. of cayenne pepper to all my soup recipes, so that was slightly different as well. I used regular chicken broth, unsalted butter, and didn't add any salt. I used the juice of a whole lemon, which was probably more like a few tbsps., and it was awesome.

The combination of mushrooms, dill, fresh parsley, lemon juice, and sour cream is RIDICULOUS good. Mine was missing the paprika so didn't have the pretty color (more of a tan/brown) but two big bowls for dinner didn't seem like enough! You won't regret this one. I'm looking forward to making it again with some Hungarian Paprika! :)

I am a wannabe soup connoisseur and this was deeeelish!!!  I make a lot of soup and this sure passed the test!  The chicken stock was made in the crockpot this morning using a Costco Rotisserie chicken carcass I had simmered down in low sodium chicken broth.   After picking the carcass the broth probably ended up with 1.5 cu of chicken meat in it.  I didn't have any unsalted butter so I cut back on the salt added in the final steps.  Also... I only keep smoked paprika on hand so that threw a little different twist on the flavor, but excellent nonetheless.  I keep home squeezed lemon juice in the freezer, and I used light sour cream. Those were my only changes.   As the other cook suggested.. I will FOR SURE try this using fresh basil! I wouldn't hesitate to put steamed shelled shrimp in it too!

I served it with sourdough toasted and buttered French bread.  Yummmmmmmmmmmyyyyyy!!

I had just made this soup for a family gathering... The lemon juice, soy sauce & paprika adds additional flavours to the mushroom soup... A very nice twist to normal plain mushroom, salt & pepper soup!
I did a small variation by using 3/4 of the mushrooms in the first boil, then blended it down to a smooth creamy soup. The remaining 1/4 mushrooms is coarsely chopped & added to a second boil just before serving my family. It's wonderful!

This is, hands down, the best cream-based soup I've eaten.   It is hearty enough to work as a main dish with a side salad but light enough that one doesn't leave the table feeling bloated and in need of angioplasty (as happens with so many other heavy, salty, gloppy cream soups).   The lemon and dill work wonders to lighten the dish while still allowing the creamy texture and earthy mushroom flavor to shine.   I've made this twice now and it will continue to be in my regular recipe rotation.   Bravo!

We both loved this! I had white button mushrooms and shitake mushrooms. So yummy and warming on bitter cold winter day. Making more again this weekend .  Only thing I could not find was Hungarian paprika.  I had some regular paprika I used.

This is an excellent recipe. We sauté a banana pepper with the onion, add a few cloves of garlic and a teaspoon of tomato paste. We eat it over thin hungarian egg noodles. Delicious and so comforting.

Oh wow, this is really delicious.  I used baby bella mushrooms because that's what I had, and I think they were really good in this soup (we like the extra meaty texture).  Only change I made was more sour cream on top when it was served, which we liked.  Next time I will try a little less dill, not because we didn't like it but because the soup is so full of rich yet subtle flavors we thought the dill was a little too prominent.  I used no fat sour cream (once again, it was on hand) and don't think it made any difference.  Since I didn't have no salt broth I skipped adding salt, and was glad I did cause it was plenty salty. I recommend low salt broth, that way you can add salt as you like.  The reviews that complained about the parsley may have used dried instead of fresh - that amount of dried parsley would be overwhelming, but the fresh was a night light addition.

This reminds me of a basque style mushroom soup I once had yet way better. I used sodelicious unsweetened coconut milk in place of regular milk and didn't add sour cream either since I'm allergic to dairy. Kept the other ingredients all the same, those should definitely be kept as is since they balance each other out. The second time I made this I just reduced the liquids to make a thick sauce and put it over pasta. Even my hubby who hates mushrooms had several helpings. So so so good.

I read the other reviews and cut down on the lemon and dill and the flavors were still overpowering to me. This was too rich and the flavors didn't work well together.

This soup was not bad. It was easy because all I had to do was chop the onions and wash the pre-chopped mushrooms. Next time I would use some red wine if I had some around. Some carrots might also be nice.
I liked the color but after I put the sour cream into the soup it didn't really mix well. I'm not sure if the soup was too hot or cold or what? No one else appears to have had this problem. I don't typically have sour cream in the fridge so next time I probably won't even bother with it. It isn't essential.

Is very good. I added more liquid and chicken... also since I'm from Louisiana I added some Cajun seasoning, soup isn't soup without a little cayanne and such.. also added pasta. But is amazing! Also should blacken or grill chicken.

Spectacular flavor! I made this soup for the first time last night and it won't be the last. The dill, paprika and lemon made for a completely different mushroom soup flavor. I didn't have good paprika, but plan on picking some up for more intense flavor for the next time I make this. I used fresh basil because I didn't have fresh parsley and used my immersion blender to make it more of a purée. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. A winner for sure! My husband loved it, too. He thought it would also be good over a steak, unblended.

I just made this soup and it was delicious.  The only thing different that I added was a few red pepper flakes - which didn't alter the taste at all.  This was a quick way to use up leftover mushrooms. I'll make again for sure!

This was sooooo good. I added 2 cups of milk to make more like a soup and reduced the quantity of butter. Really this is the best mushroom soup. Will definitely make this many many times since my 1.5 year old ate it too. Thanks for the recipe.

This is one of the best mushroom soup I have never had. I didn't have any source cream but was truly very tasty. I made sure not to over cook the mushroom so they had a nice bit to them. I will definitely make this one again!!

Made this not long ago. This year we have had an abundance of all kinds of mushrooms here in the Northwest--chantarelles, shitakes and more! I like to oven roast them in a bit of olive oil and fresh rosemary before I use them in soups. And this versatile and easy recipe showcases them beautifully. Delicious!

I added lean ground turkey, used portobellos and skipped the parsley.  I used skim milk and light margarine as well as bragg's aminos instead of soy sauce.  Flavor was delicious.  I couldn't believe paprika and dill would be so good together.

The only real change I made to this is that I left out the dill because I was afraid my husband wouldn't like it.  Other than that, I probably used a little over a pound of mushrooms just because I had them and needed to use them up.  Couldn't believe how easy this was and the leftovers are quite tasty, too.  The lemon added a nice touch, so thanks for that (never woulda thought of it!)  I used my immersion blender to break up some of the chunks and make it thicker, but left enough for texture. Lovely recipe - thanks!

We used what we had - olive oil instead of butter, dried parsley (about 2 tbsp), fresh dill (about 1.5 tbsp), and lime instead of lemon juice.
IT WAS FANTASTIC. Two of us finished it all in one night!

The dill really brightened the creaminess of the soup. Next time we might even add more!

We love soups and this was delicious.  Loaded with flavor and very filling.  Served with hot bread, salad and fruit for dessert.

I love mushrooms so I tried this recipe. I'm on a health kick so I also substituted the milk for soy milk, plain greek yogurt for sour cream, and used smoked paprika and reduced parsley to 1-2T chopped fresh. I liked it. I wondered why there wasn't any garlic! Very flavorful (though I will use garlic next time) and rich! The fresh parsley is nice to brighten up the flavor.

This is a wonderful mushroom soup. I use about twice the lemon juice to make it extra tangy (but don't use more than that, because then it'll be really sour!), and I also used 1.5 times the amount of paprika. I add a couple dashes of red pepper flakes when I add the paprika, for some extra kick. Overall, really delicious, and I make this soup regularly.

I liked this recipe. The only thing I changed was that I used low-sodium chicken broth instead of regular (I have high blood pressure) and just used a pinch of sea salt at the end instead of a teaspoon of table salt. It was very good, although I wish I could have put a tsp. of salt in at the end. It tastes like a good soup for fall and winter. I used a few shakes of paprika, the recommended amount of fresh parsley which I did not find overpowering at all, and a small squeeze from a fresh lemon. I also used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream because it is fat free and tastes just like sour cream. I'm really happy with this soup, it was very good.

It was PERFECT exactly as written. Delicious flavours. The only thing I will do next time I make it is chop the mushrooms a bit more finely than I did. My small kids didn't care for big pieces of mushroom, but all agreed that it tasted really good! Thank you!

Very nice, and easyish too. Different flavour than what I would typically have in soup. I'll be doing this often through the winter for sure.

Okay a couple of things. Firstly this recipe was not bad, however it was not delicious either.  The flavour of the soup was tasty, but it felt as if it was missing something that would bring it to the next level.  I think this is a good starting point. I am going to continuing to search for a soup that has the WOW factor that I am looking for.

The soup had a good taste if you could deal with the mouthful of onions in every bite. 2 cups of onions is way too much.

I made this for a dinner party with the works --soup, salad and entree.  I used a mix of mushrooms (about one lb of crimini and maybe 1/2 lb of shitake).  Increased the milk and broth slightly to compensate.  It was FANTASTIC!  Guests raved and thought I should figure out a way to sell it.  It was just enough for 6 guests with 1 bowl each.  If you want leftovers or more than one bowl (or LARGE bowls for each person) then increase the ingredients accordingly.  Soy sauce is not exactly authentic Hungarian --however, the rest of the ingredients are rather typical eastern European.  I'm not sure what everyone is talking about with being "too salty".  I didn't find that at all.  Perhaps it depends on what kind of chicken broth you are using?  I used Trader Joe's Organic Free range chicken broth. Followed the recipe as given.  No comoplaints about salt.

Great recipe. Next time I would cut the dill weed in half. I ended up adding a little more sour cream at the end to cut the dill weed. Little over powering but other than that definitely make again. Also thinking of tweaking this by ay adding pork and cutting the mushrooms in half to make this a full meal.

This soup was delicious, I think it would be a good side dish with a Steak.  However, if you're making this soup as the MEAL-- double it!! This soup only made two large bowls.  Definitely not enough for more than 2 or 3 people as a meal.  You won't have leftovers!!

Wasn't real happy with the outcome, the sour cream separated due to the lemon, had it on warm, but it may have been still too hot. Little disappointed but will eat it anyway. Will look for another recipe. First out of five that I will change out.

Made this recipe today exactly as it was written and it is delicious. It will be my go to mushroom soup recipe from now on. It has a unique blend of flavors that is very effective, and it tastes as though it was made in a high-end restaurant.

I love anything with mushrooms, and will add a combo of any fresh mushrooms I can find in the supermarket. Haven't yet learned to pick my own yet. I keep coming back to this recipe time and time again. Absolutely, delicious. A definite winner.

Lovely recipe: I subbed with cornstarch in place of flour and cilantro for dill, and sweet curry for paprika- and ended up with a really nice mushroom bisque. The flavor I ended up with was almost Thai.

Wow - this one got some serious rave reviews at my house!  I didn't have parsley so chopped up a couple of handfuls of swiss chard, added aabout half again as much paprika, didn't have soy sauce so I used worcestershire sauce instead and loved it.  No lemon - oh well.  I did add sautéed garlic (about  5 cloves  because we're all garlic crazy over here).  This soup has a wonderful layer of flavors without being heavy or (gasp) fattening.  My grandson announced anchovies would go great in this soup and I think he's absolutely right - next time we will add a tin of finely chopped anchovies  along with some garlicky croutons - oh yum!

This was a pretty good tasting mushroom soup. My only complaints were that the broth was very thin and the mushrooms for some reason wanted to stay on the bottom. I would also like to know how some cooks were able to get that wonderful yellow color to their broth. Andrea

I absolutely love this soup, and have now made it a kazillion times. I like to try different combinations of mushrooms. A favorite adaptation is to use half butter, half bacon fat, which adds a ton of flavor. I have also used whipped cream cheese when I was out of sour cream! We drink soy milk instead of cow milk in my house and I tried making it with soy milk once, but that didn't work out as well as I had hoped. Otherwise, recipe as written is just great.

Really good!  I added some garlic with the onion and sauteed in olive oil, not butter.  Then added minced clams for protein.  Yummy!!!

This recipe was wonderful and filling. The only thing was after my taste testing, it lacked a little something. I added a 1/4 cup of white cooking wine to it at and that completed this savory soup!

My husband and I really enjoyed the rich flavor of this soup.  This might be nice to serve for company sometime.  I did make a number of changes based on our preference and what I had on hand and the soup still turned out well.  

I used button mushrooms, and added a 1/2 head of cauliflower (chopped), 1 c red/green peppers (diced), and a couple heads of garlic diced in with the onions (diced).  I used concentrated chicken stock and added 4 c of water total (2 at the beginning and 2 more later on) because the soup was more of a stew.  I didn't have parsley so it was omitted. I used 1/5 tbl sweet hungarian paprika. I only used 1 tbl of butter - next time no need for butter at all, use oil.  Note: do not add salt at the end and be sparing with the black pepper because it really stands out.  I think that most any veg would work well in this soup.

There are so many things that could be done with this recipe - cooked thicker and served over potatoes, meat, steamed veggies, rice, noodles, bulgur.  Or use a blender to make it creamy.  Overall a very nicely flavored soup, and pretty easy to make, that hubby and I both loved!

What a great rich flavor in such a short amount of time!  Next time I will try adding some leafy greens like spinach or kale.

I thought this recipe was really good.  I used salt free chicken stock, salted butter, dried parsley, and about half of the amount of dill that was called for.  Served sour cream separately.  This would be good also reduced by half and thickened up more for a sauce over any type of meat.  I probably won't make again as a soup though.

Super easy to make! I raided my fridge & freezer for additional ingredients & added chicken (sauteed with mushrooms) & chopped olives stuffed with garlic. Served with rice and family enjoyed every bit of it, no leftovers. Next time, will double the recipe, this was just enough for two adults & two children. Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe!!

Fantastic recipe.  So easy and yummy...and used skim milk, low fat sour cream, and margarine instead of butter.  Reduced the salt slightly due to margarine instead of unsalted butter and it was great!  Husband even praised me with  a 'jolly good' (he's English).  Wieght  Watchers points - 5 per serviing.

Wow, this was really good!!  I did add reconstituted crimini and shitake mushrooms and the liquid they soaked in & smoked paprika as another reviewer suggested.  I also did not want all the extra calories of the sr. crm and didn't have yogurt on hand so I used 1 Tbs of sherry, 1 tsp of caldo de pollo and a tsp of both garlic and onion powder.  Yummy:-)

Love, love, love this soup! I make this at least once a week. It's flavorful and hearty. A perfect soup for a go to winter dish. I have to double the recipe because it goes fast. Just for future reference, if you run out of dill weed or don't have any, don't substitute with dill seed. I did this once and it totally changed the flavor. Thanks for sharing!

I won 1st place in a soup contest with this recipe.  I've used it for a couple of years & loved it.  My family gets together every Christmas and we always have a cooking contest.  This year it was soup and the Hungarian Mushroom won.  I follow the recipe exactly. This is a rich very flavorful soup.  Is great on a cold snowy day.

This is the absolute best soup I've ever tasted!  I'm a huge fan of mushroom soup and hope that it's the 'soup of the day' when I'm out at a restaurant.  

I followed this recipe exactly as its listed, and its perfect! 

The only thing that I would change is doubling the recipe because I could eat it all in one sitting!

Thank you!

Made this today as written using button and crimini mushrooms. I will definitely make it again. Delicious! This is an earthy and very filling soup that is quite eye-appealing as well. Served with a chewy, artisan bread.

YUMMMM!!!! I used the ingredients as the recipe said but not the amounts .  I also used 1/2 regular mushrooms and 1/2 portobello mushrooms.  I added more butter  and onions.  I also added a super super hot sauce as my husband and I love hot foods.   This is a OMG wonderful mushroom soup.  I will be making it again and again.  Thank you so very much!!

Perfect for a light lunch!  Just enough for 2 and one helping of leftovers for the next days lunch.  Glad I read the reviews about the parsley.  I only had dry parsley on hand and used 2 tablespoons and it was the perfect amount.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly the way it was written and it was a huge hit with my husband and I.

I would use half of the recommended onions and up the mushrooms next time but this is just a personal taste thing and I found the original recipe amazing.

I made this for "Movie Night" with the gals and it was a huge success.  So easy to make.  I did change the recipe to accommodate my vegan friends so instead of using butter, I used olive oil.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock and I used almond milk instead of cow's milk.  I doubled the recipe but only used the flour and milk for a single recipe and it turned out thick enough without doubling that part of the recipe.  Delicious!!!

This a great recipe and very easy to make. I used portabella and button mushrooms. Worked very well. Thanks for sharing.

This was the BEST mushroom soup I have ever eaten!  The only thing I changed was omitting the soy sauce and lemon juice because I was all out.  I also added about 1 cup of roasted red peppers and some diced chicken (which was cooked to make my broth).  My 4 year old can't get enough and keeps commenting on how she LOVES my cooking today! Absolutely delicious, and will definately make it agian.

Love it! My boyfriend and I enjoy trying new recipes at least weekly and this is now added in our cookbook. I did change one thing which was using plain Greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream just to add some nutrition and protein and it was still delicious!

This soup was amazing. I added half of the smoked sweet paprika, dill, and parsley like others had recommended. I added about 3/4 cups chopped, reconstituted shitake mushrooms soaked in about a cup of boiling water. I think the juice of the dried mushrooms adds extra flavor. To make it vegetarian, I used vegetable broth.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!  Made this using crimini, portabello and shitake mushrooms for added flavor and it turned out great!  I am picky about good flavor and this recipe did not disappoint.  I also used half and half instead of just milk and put it in a food processor to make it a bit smoother.  Great for family or company!

Delicious!! Family loved it! I doubled the chicken stock, but left the 1 cup of milk (used light cream) - loved it! Also added a little over a pound of mushrooms - white and bellas.  Will definitely be in the rotation!!!

Second time making this recipe and love it just as much as the first time.  Hubby mentioned that this would be excellent as a pasta sauce...agree with him.  The only change I made was to  use smoky paprika only because I didn't have the plain paprika on hand.  Even with that change, it is an outstanding soup!

This recipe is great. I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand: one cup chopped celery for one of the cups of onion, beef broth instead of chicken and no soy sauce. I was skeptical about the milk addition, but it was perfect. Next time I might add some white wine for even more flavor -- but there will definitely be a next time!

I have three words for you. TO DIE FOR!  I have never had mushroom soup made from scratch, but this is what my mouth and brain said it should be like.  I left out the dill b/c I didn't have any and used less lemon juice and less parsley like previous reviews suggested.  I like onion, but 2 cups seemed a little too much for me so I used 1 cup.  This was very good and any future mushrooms that cross my path will become THIS soup not salad decorations.

This really is a 5 star soup. I made this for my Russian family (Russians are mushroom lovers) and the mother said this was the best soup she ever had. Keep in mind this woman used to pick wild mushrooms in a Russian forest! 

I used fresh baby bellas, regular paprika, and was very liberal with the dill inside the soup as well as garnish. It turns out to be thick, rich and heavy on the mushrooms. 

I followed one woman's suggestion and added a brick of cream cheese, chuck roast, and poured over noodles. This combination lasted 2 people for 3 days and was soul filling. 

This soup is something I save for a special occasion or If I feel I really deserve a treat. I'd say this soup is time consuming, and requires a little forethought to be organized throughout the cooking process.

This is very good! I was hesitant to use so much dill but it blends with everything else very nicely, especially with the sour cream.  I thought the spice combo seemed odd but I went for it anyway and I'm very glad I did!  I planned to give ths 4 stars until I reheated it the next day.  It's much better after sitting overnight.  I will definately make this again.  The only change I was made was to add 2 cups of diced potatoes (another reviewer's idea, not mine) which I will also do next time I make it.

Exchanged shallots for onions. Came out terrific, almost like a bisque. Much more refined than I expected based on the simple ingredients, a nice soup to start off a meal for company or a special occasion.

This recipe has quickly become my fav soup!  I found it needed more dill, but then again I LOVE dill.  I used low fat sour cream the second time I made it and found little difference.  I have also made it with beef broth as I ran out of chicken and now I make it with whichever I happened to have at home.  I followed another reviewers suggestion of putting some of it in a blender for a more "refined" looking soup and found I enjoyed the less chunky version.  I also garnish the soup with a dollop of sour cream on top.  I often serve it over egg noodles on a cold winter day.

I made this exactly as the recipes states with the exception of using cornstarch to thicken instead of flour. I feel it's lacking something, although I can't pinpoint what. It tastes exactly as one would think - like dill & paprika. I think I might just not be a huge fan of paprika in this quantity, but that's not the fault of the recipe. The boyfriend likes it. We thought we'd have to argue with the kids & force them to eat dinner, but they both gave it 100 thumbs up; the 7 yr. old had 2 bowls. Talk about the opposite reaction I'd anticipated. Even before they ate it, they both said they didn't like onions or mushrooms (even though they eat them often without knowing it in my cooking). I'm told it's really good (by the boyfriend & both kids) with crusty bread or rolls. I'm thinking about making something along the lines of Salisbury steak & using this as the gravy - I think it'd be pretty good used as a gravy over the meat or mashed potatoes.

Absolutely delicious! Although I felt that it had too much onions. Also, I would vary the type of mushrooms used in it next time.

My new favorite soup.  I have made about 6 pots in the past month, each time trying a slight variation.   It was best using f/f milk, f/f sour cream, and fresh dill.  I also used smoked Hungarian paprika.  I like to add dried exotic mushrooms to give it a little extra flavor (rehydrate the mushrooms first in a separate pot for about 20 minutes, drain, chop & then add to the soup).  I bought the dried mushrooms at Shaws, they come in a small packet right near the fresh ones.

This soup is so delicious! My boyfriend says it's the best homemade soup he has ever had! That in itself is a tremendous compliment. Needless to say, start making this soup immediately. We adjusted this soup by omitting the milk (just didn't have any), used extra fat free sour cream. I doubled the recipe just because we loved it so much. Also used shitake mushrooms. Also, we tossed the soup in the blender until it was a thicker and creamer consistency. It's really the best soup ever and I highly suggest blending it.

This soup was amazing! I added about 1/4 cup red wine but otherwise exactly like recipe. It was almost too rich so next time I'll replace the butter with olive oil.

Excellent soup! Lots going on in the brew.  We really enjoyed it.  We may cut the salt in half next time.  I think the bullion provides quite a bit of salt already.

WOW!!...Just WOW.  I had been craving a good winter soup for a while. This was exactly what I wanted.  I stuck to the recipe almost exactly, but tossed in 1/2tsp of garlic powder.  It was a subtle change but I think it made an improvement.  I will be making this wonderful soup often and recommending it to friends and family.

I like this dish, but I thought it could have been thinker. My boyfriend on the other hand LOVED it. He ate all of it within two days! The only thing i changed was i used vegetable broth instead of chicken because i'm a vegetarian and i left out the dill weed.

What a fabulous soup!!!  Rich and hearty.  I used olive oil instead of butter and only 1 tbsp of it.  I cut the dill to 1 tsp as I didn't want it overpowering.  I used a whole quart of vegatable stock because I didn't think I would like it as thick as it was looking with only 2 cups.  Creamy enough without the sour cream.  Thank you so much -  I will be making this often.

Fabulous! I love to cook and get a lot of compliments but my husband is the hardest to please. If he likes something he usually will just say it is ok but this soup got a great review from him. He loved it. Said it was "GREAT" and asked for a second bowl! My kids loved it to. I am so excited to have found a simple recipe that everyone in the house is excited about. I can't wait to host our next dinner party. I plan to serve this as our starter soup and I am sure it will please everyones taste buds :) Thank you so much for sharing this fabulous recipe.

I made this this weekend for a family "soup party", where the goal was to try a bunch of different soup and swap recipes.  It was the hit of the party!  It was the first one everyone wanted to try and the recipe was requested by everyone!  

As it was the first time I made it I went pretty much by the recipe but I will make a few changes next time.  I added a little minced garlic after sauteing the onions for a couple of minutes and halved the amount of onion.  I left out the parsley all together because parsley has no taste.  And next time I will cut back the paprika because it was a little much!

The only complaint I had was it was not thick enough so I'm either going to use a emulsion blender to break up some of the mushrooms or make it creamy by adding more sour cream and flour/milk mix.

I can't say enough about this wonderful recipe.
It has become a standard around our house.  I use portabella mushrooms.  In my lightened version, I replace the butter with Smart Balance and use skim milk. Doesn't hurt it a bit. Sometimes I have even replaced the sour cream with plain yogurt(to which I add a little flour for thickening); it's still good, but I can tell the difference.  On occasion I've used half sour cream and half plain yogurt.   I serve this with home-made french bread and it makes a tasty and simple meal.

This is the first time I have felt the need to rate and review a recipe on the site.  My husband and I both just love this soup.  The only change I made was to add two cloves of minced garlic to the onions, and I used cilantro instead of parsley.  Loved it!!!  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

Tasty soup, fairly easy to prepare, I needed to cook the mushrooms longer at higher heat.  Still needed a flavor "kick," maybe a little Worchestershire sauce and nutmeg would help.

Being vegetarian, I substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and it comes out beautifully every time. I follow the recipe almost exactly and I love it. I just made it for my Dad, and he loved it too! The only changes I usually make are to add 1 Tbs chives and use parsley flakes instead of fresh chopped.

Very good. I love the flavor all of the ingredients bring.  WHAD DID I DO DIFFERENT?  I added 1 potato (diced).  Next time, I will leave the potato unpeeled to give the soup that home-made touch.  I let the onions brown for a while.  I also added 1 clove of garlic.  I used nonfat milk and low fat skim milk.  Next time, I will try to use olive oil instead of butter.   Verry verry good!!

Found this receipe a few years ago and I make it regularly, always very popular.  Even shared it in a church cookbook.  I love the rich, savory flavor of the broth.  I like to use half portobello mushrooms.

I have made this recipe twice within 3 weeks!  It is the best soup I've ever had.  Everyone who tried it went gaga.  I am a vegetarian, so I used Vegetable stock instead:)  Thanks for the recipe!  I will probably make this forever. xoxo

Delightful soup!  It wasn't as thick as I'd hoped, but it was good just the same.  I think it needed an additional dash of paprika.  After reading reviews, I think next time I'll try beef broth instead of chicken to make it a little "heartier".

This soup is wonderful! I used Portabella, Maitake, and Brown Button mushrooms.  Oops,  I didn't add sour cream since I didn't write it on my shopping list, but I am sure it would be wonderful with a dollop as well.

This soup is great. The only thing I changed in the recipe is whole milk to Fat Free milk and regular sour cream to lite sour cream and chicken broth to Fat free reduced sodium! The soup is still rich in flavor . a great  and lit alternative to the regular cream of mushroom soup!! Thanks for the recipe!

So delicious, I made one batch as the instructions stated. Ate the whole thing myself before anyone else got home; and then made a second batch for supper. In the second batch, I added 2 tablespoons of red wine to the onion/mushroom/butter mixture. Fantastic recipe!! will keep making forever. Thanks so much

Fantastic soup! I use cooking spray to coat the pot before sauteing to cut the fat. I used low sodium broth and have used veggie broth with this recipe also . Wonderful with both. I run the onions and half of the mushrooms through the processor. the seasoning is perfect. I am growing dill weed in my garden this year and can't wait to try it with fresh instead of dried! Thank you for a great recipe!

This was EXCELLENT.  I made just one serving since my husband doesn't like mushrooms, and it easily accomodates such a small "batch."  I added one half link of italian sausage (for my one serving), doubled the lemon juice, and omitted the parsley since I didn't have any.  This is a fantastic recipe and even though it's perfect as written, it does accomodate personalized changes very well. Oh, I also used soy milk instead of regular milk, and vegan "butter" in place of the unsalted butter, with no noticeable difference.

I thought this dish was amazing! I have to agree that the amount of dill weed suggested made the flavour too strong, so I will probably reduce it to 1.5 teaspoons. I threw in some brown rice and I have to say it was even better than eating the soup straight. I also halved the amount of salt and used low-sodium salt. No more salt is needed! Or, if you like salty foods, you can always add some at the end, which is safer than over-salting the soup. I already have a request to this again!

The first Day I made this, I wasn't to impressed w/the flavor and figured I wouldn't make again.  But on day 3, I reheated it for lunch and was surprised how much better it was than the first day!  I guess it's just one of those soups that taste better a day or 2 after it's made. and as far as mushroom soups go, it has alot of flavor and it's really very good.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe at all.

I use half the dill and omit the lemon juice.  I also use a mixture of portabello, oyster, and white mushrooms.  I use scallions or leeks to give it a different twist depending on what is on sale.  I use heavy whipping cream instead of milk and use potato flakes instead of flour for a thickener.  Yeah, I know I changed like half the recipe but it is so decadent with the changes!

A super-declicious soup!  I love mushroom soup and these flavors are great.  My fault - I had only 1/2 of the mushrooms called for and with the full amount this would be even better.

Wonderful recipe! I wouldn't change anything except use fresh dill because it makes the flavor that much better. I did 8 servings worth, and made this for my boyfriend's family for dinner. They loved it!

Amazing!  I have been looking all over for a great Hungarian Mushroom Soup recipe.  I love it just the way it is. And I can't believe how easy it is, especially using the food processor to chop onions and slice muchrooms.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this soup for my wife on our first date.  After we were married, she told me that she went home that night and told her roommate that she was going to marry me! :D  This soup has magical powers, and is one of the most delicious soups I have ever had.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would!

There's a little homemade soup and bread shop in my hometown that was sort of famous for what they called 'Hungarian Mushroom Soup'.  I always ordered it whenever I went, and figured I'd never find a recipe to rival it, but this is it!  I never would have guessed it, based on the ingredients.  THANK YOU for this recipe!  Pretty budget friendly too.  This is going to be a staple at our house.

Well, I don't know what to say.  I enjoyed this soup, but my husband really disliked it.  He couldn't tell me exactly what it was that he didn't like, but I think it may have been that I used sweet paprika instead of the hot Hungarian.  He said it tasted almost "dusty", which I've noticed sometimes happens when you use too much sweet paprika.  And while I really enjoyed this soup, I probably won't be making it again.

This soup is incredible, it was just as good (and much better, in many cases) as soup you might get in a fine restaurant.  I did not have soy sauce or paprika on hand the last time I made it, so I substituted teriyaki sauce and a mix of ground cayenne pepper, cumin, and a caribbean jerk seasoning, and gave this soup a real kick.  I give this recipe a solid 5 stars and would highly recommend it, one of my favorites!

This was a wonderful soup. I doubled the recipe as I had a little over two pounds of mushrooms. I used fresh dill and parsley from the garden. At the very end, I used the emersion blender just a little. Next time, i might add a little bit of thyme. I think that would go well with this soup. I didn't use it this time so that I could rate the recipe as is. Superb taste and quick soup to make.

OMG! This is the most amazing and hearty soup I've ever made.  I followed almost exactly but increased a few quantities (I wanted more!).  I used 5 different kinds of muchrooms for a more 'wild' flavor. I didn't have chicken broth, used beef broth.  I didn't have dill, just left it out.  I let it simmer a little longer at the end. You have to try this - so GOOD!!

This recipe is perfect as it is. I usually do not enjoy the flavor of mushrooms, but this soup had a lot of other flavors going on.  My husband and I polished it off in no time.  Will definitely make this again!

Fantastic! This is as close as you can get to a beef stroganoff I make but much less expensive. I didnt have to add the heavy cream and wine yet I got the same flavors. This is so creamy and hearty. I did not have dill but it was wonderful even without it. THANK YOU!

I thought that this soup was great! It appears to be a really heavy soup but it really isn't. Wish I would have had a little cooking sherry to put in. I think that would have made it out of this world. The parsley at the end is a must (fresh) and refreshing too. A great change from your ordinary cream of Mushroom soup.No real need for extra salt if you use salted butter.

Fantastic. The only thing I did differently was change the quantity to feed 18 and it was fabulous. Next time, though, I would definitely temper the sour cream before adding it to the soup. You must try this!

So delicious and easy! I followed the recipe exactly except to use a medium potato to thicken the soup instead of flour. Adding flour in the way that the recipe calls for would give the soup a raw flour taste. To make the dish more elegant looking, I pureed it with an immersion blender

This is the best mushroom soup I have ever had.  The only change I made was because I didn't have any lemon or lemon juice, so I used some lemon pepper instead.

It wasn't what I expected, but it was really good. The comparisons that were made to Campbell's soup in other reviews were, thankfully, way off. Yes, it's thick and yes, it's mushroom, but there the similarities end. It was very rich and I wouldn't make it on a regular basis, but it was great as a treat. I had a guest who I didn't know wasn't crazy about mushrooms, and even she loved it - and went back for seconds!  I used the recipe as it was submitted and used a combination of button and portobella mushrooms.  If you put it over egg noodles or rice it would be a great substitution for beef stroganoff!

I had to snicker at the other soup recipe reviews that touted how the soup tasted just like Campbells Cream of Mushroom soup. OK, seriously, who wants that? THIS soup is so  much more. I used generous slices of both baby ports and criminis. I followed it pretty much to the letter and like the subtle flavor of the dill. I didn't find it overpowering at all. I like the other reviewers ideas re: how to make it a bit more calorie-conscious and may try that next time.

Fabulous soup for so little work.  I'm a beef and mushroom lover so tried with beef broth and it was amazing.  A wonderful aroma while it is cooking is as good as the flavors when you take your first sip.  Great anytime.  My new comfort food.

So yummy! I'm very proud of the final results. I omitted the sour cream as I didn't have any. I did one tsp of dried parsley. Pureed half an onion and 3 cloves of garlic. Besides that I stuck exactly to the recipe. It was a wonderful Sunday dinner, I look forward to making it for family.

This was excellent. I used only 1 tsp. dill weed and 2 tsp. paprika, added 2 minced cloves of garlic with the onions and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. I don't normally vary from the original recipe unless there are a lot of changes from reviewers, but in this case I did and was pleased with the outcome.

This was really good.  I pureed the soup to make it thicker because I used it as a main course.  I'm sure I will make this again, but I might add some meat to it, just for a bit more flavor and a bit more filling.

This soup is the BEST mushroom soup I've ever eaten!  I love its creaminess. I'm not so sure if there's a point in adding the sour cream. It had a really nice consistency before I added it...I think its just adding extra calories. Anyway, this was great. I will defiantly be making this soup again and again and again. Also, I was thinking it may be really good with tender pieces of beef. Cook soup on low for a couple of hours to tenderize the meat. Im going to try that next time.

Thought this was really good. My husband is Hungarian, and he loved it. My changes: used vegetable broth and just a sprinkling of salt--it seemed salty enough to me. Also, just realized, by accident, I put in less sour cream--but still tasted good. It is a little on the thick side; might want to add extra broth. I think next time I might add the mushrooms in with the onions and cook them all for 10 minutes.

This is amazing, amazing, amazing!!    When my daughter had all four wisdom teeth removed recently this was her main choice for food.  I've tweaked it a bit for our use.  Use vegetable broth (we're vegetarians).  Use olive oil in place of butter.  Use smoked paprika.  Half portabella, half white, mushrooms.  Reduce dill by half.  Use light or fat-free sour cream depending on what's in the frig.  And use my immersion blender to blend into a creamy, hearty soup.  (daughter loves mushrooms, but has a "texture" issue)  I'm so glad to have found this recipe!!!

Excessively fating. My husband actually got sick afterward.  Would maybe make it with fat-free sour cream & fat-free milk next time.

Rave reviews.  I made it for my husband and he told EVERYONE.  I had to have a dinner party just for the soup last weekend.  It's got a nice, well rounded flavor that's really enjoyable.

This was a very tasty and easy soup.  I did add more paprika and some dried pepper flakes (from Penzey's).  The family really liked it.

When I was a teenager I worked for a man, who each year, cooked this soup for Kinship Partner's soup cook-off.  He would make it in the restaurant, never devulging the century old family recipe, for fear that he would loose the contest due to an imatation.  This soup is almost as good as his (I think that he had a couple secret Hungarian ingredients)!  I wish I could eat this every day and keep my figure, the addition of bacon was really good, we served this soup for the first course at a dinner party and it was a hit!!  Thanks contributer!

This soup is so comforting and tasty.  I usually "tweak" receipes but this one was perfect!  Definately make a double batch if you want to have it more than once.  Great with crusty hot baguette.  If you love mushrooms and you love soup, this is the recipe for you.

Nice comfort food for winter!  Very easy too.  I used basil in lieu of parsley and some thick cream in place of the sour cream.  Just enough for 2-3 hungry people.  I would recommend this as a starter for a classy dinner party as well.

Wonderful!! Very easy to make and it tastes absolutely amazing! It is very simple and elegant, perfect for company, yet it is hearty enough for a family meal. My two year old even gobbled this up! I served it with a tossed salad and cheese bread. Used Portobello mushrooms, but made no changes to the recipe except I didn't have soy sauce so I used Teriyaki sauce instead. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will certainly make this again!!

This was so easy and soooo flavorful!  My daughter didn't think she would like it and she had seconds.  I will put a little less paprika next time, it was a little on the hot side.  Wonderful recipe, will definetely use again and again and again...

This was absolutely fantastic!!  I used baby bella mushrooms (pre-sliced), one medium onion, fat free milk, low fat sour cream, and low sodium chicken broth.  I made it exactly as written.  This was so rich and creamy and "gourmet" tasting.  My husband and oldest son loved it.  It's definitely a keeper!!

This was very easy to make and I love mushrooms, but I think I was expecting this to be a little thicker and creamier.  The parsley was also a little overpowering for me.  But all in all, it was pretty good.

A very good soup recipe!  I had to add some garlic salt to give it a little moe flavor, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I will start to include this one in the regular soup rotation!

Had this soup at a dinner party recently.  It was prepared by a friend who is an excellent cook.  She said she used half milk and half 1/2 & 1/2.  Other than that the recipe was followed faithfully.  It was really outstanding.  I thought it could benefit from a dash or two of sherry.

This is hands down the best mushroom soup I have EVER put in my mouth! I LOVE mushrooms and this is the perfect mushroom lover dish. It has a very strong flavor so don't try it if you're looking for something plain and bland and if you only "kinda" like mushrooms. I used baby bellas and pureed the soup before adding the sour cream. My family didn't enjoy it at all, but I was happy! More for me! :)

One of our favorite recipes. Actually it's my girfriend's favorite and she's asked for it so many times I'm almost getting sick of it. But it's a great combination of flavors. I would reccomend though making sure that the mushrooms reach your desired level of firmness before adding the broth as it can make a difference. Also know that some paprikas can be quite spicy so adjust accordingly.

I thought this made a fairly decent bowl of soup but my husband absolutely LOVES this recipe. Needless to say, I've made it a few times now! The first time I made it as directed, and it was pretty good, with room for improvement. The second and third time I made it, I added baby portabellas (sliced) in addition to the button mushrooms. I also added a splash of cider vinegar, which I felt complemented the dill, and at the very end I stirred in some sliced green onions and crispy bacon, just to give it a little more "oomph." I know I will be making this again, as hubby is crazy about it. Thank you SO much for sharing!!!

I made this after eating a version of it via my Hungarian in-laws.  When they tasted this one, they were extremely pleased.  It's delectable, and has done wonders in bridging a cultural gap here.

Very nice home made soup!  Even without the paprika (thought I had but didn't) it still was excellent.  Both of my sisters requested the recipe.  Next time I will add the paprika.

One of my favorite soups! I add a bit more dill to it since I like a stronger dill flavor. I've made this time and time again. Its wonderful!

Terrific!  Made it last night for the first time and my family loved it, I wouldn't change a thing.  Great on a cold winter night served with crusty bread and a glass of wine.  Thanks for sharing, I will make it again!

Overall a good soup, but the soysauce was overpowering. I used an authentic soysauce, next time I'll use lighter sodium soysauce.

Outstanding, and so quick & easy too. I cut up a left over chicken breast & my family loved it too. Next time I would double the recipe & freeze the leftovers.

I used salted butter instead of unsalted, so I did not add the extra salt. also, to make this recipe even more low cal, I made a sour cream substitution using 1/2 cup of lowfat cottage cheese, 1 tablespoon of lowfat milk, and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice blended until creamy. i also substituted the chicken broth using veggie broth (I'm a vegitarian)..overall excellent and easy recipe!

Fantastic! Takes a few minutes to make, but other than that, wonderful.  Low-Cal Sour Cream was substitued, maybe add non-fat yogurt next time.  Also used 1/2 the butter.

This was really good. I used cayenne pepper instead of paprika and it was SO spicy! Good thing we like spicy food in this house. But this was making our eyes water! I used the leftovers as kind of a stroganoff, over rice. Yum!

This soup is fantastic!  I've never been very good at throwing ingredients together to form tasty soups, so I always rely on recipes and this one is so easy and fun!  I cut the recipe in half and ate some the evening I made it and finished the rest off for lunch the next day.  It was even better a day later.  Highly recommended!  Thank you!

This is an awesome soup. I used only 1/2 the recommended dill because of a previous review I read but I believe it would have be fine with the full amount. I'm warming some leftover in the microwave as I type this.  It taste just as good the next day.

Tasty.  I think it's a little heavy on the dill - next time I'll use just a little less.

I am 100% Hungarian and this is the BEST Mushroom Soup I've ever had and it was SO easy to make.  Luckily I was able to use the fresh dill and parsley I have growing in my garden.  Awesome Recipe!  Didn't substitute a thing.

left out the dill and paprika, and purreed the suop with an immersion blender before adding the sour cream.  wonderful1!  do not try this with canned mushrooms if you're out of fresh- the flavour just isn't there.

Wonderful recipe.  I used baby bella mushrooms.  Skipped the sour cream.  Great flavor and easy to put together.  I was not expecting this soup to taste as good as it did.  I've already divided up the leftovers into lunch portions for next week.  This is a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly as printed.  My husband said it was o.k.  I thought the dill was too strong and I really didn't care for it.  It was edible but not outstanding.

This is as good as everyone says, Rich creamy great for a cold autumn night. It is good just thew recipe says but next time I will cut the onions in half to maybe 1/2 cup of onions and also on the dill maybe 1 tsp(dill is strong) and maybe let folks add their own sour cream. But all in all this was absolutely wonderful. It's a keeper.. Thanks for sharing.

Really loved the color, and the dill and parsley give a  great taste.  I added a bit more lemon juice, and will probably add even more next time.  Had it for dinner last night for guests with just some good bread and salad.  I used 2% milk and it came out totally fine.  If you want to make it healthier, I'm sure it's fine without the sour cream.  As a main dish, I didn't think it was quite enough for 6 people.

Yum.  The only thing I did was to use 1 tsp of dill.  It was good and not overpowerful. The soup wasn't gravy-ish for me.  I served rice and diced chicken on the side.  But I think I liked it plain, with just the soup.

My husband and I really loved this soup! I followed the recipe as given with a couple very minor exceptions.  I used more mushrooms and I varied the type - 8 oz. white button, 8 oz. shitake, and 8 oz. portabello.  I also increased the salt for our tastes.  As extra assurance that I didn't have any lumps in my milk and flour mixture, I threw it in the blender for 30 seconds. This soup is chunky, creamy, and has a wonderful flavor.  I would serve this to company in a heartbeat.

I really like this.  I omited the lemon juice and added a bit more sour cream.  I'd make this again.  I used the leftovers the next day.  I sauted some chicken then added the leftover soup and simmered it.  Very good.

I am happy with this recipe overall, but I'm going to tweak it next time I make it.  Will replace lemon juice with 1 oz. of vermouth, increase paprika a bit and decrease parsley by 1 tablespoon.  Used a mix of portabello mushrooms and white, used the food processor to cut finely.  Elegant taste.  Next time I will puree before adding sour cream and parsley.  Lovely rich hearty flavor - well done!

This soup was very good.  I think 2 tsp of dill is WAY too much, though...I wanted to absolutely love this dish, but the dill just kept getting in the way.  I think herbs should enhance a dish, not overpower it.  1 tsp would be more than enough...If I make this again I might even go with 1/2 tsp....
Overall, though...it was great!

I can only say that this soup is absolutely *DELICIOUS*!  I can't begin to imagine how anyone would not like this soup, but can only guess thea are not familiar with the spices used -- hungarian paprika and dill.  For someone who grew up in an Eastern European household, this soup is wonderful.  I use 1 1/2 lbs mushrooms (mix of Portobella, Baby Bella, and button -- a mix of flavorful mushrooms is important as I've found plain white button to be a bit bland).  I also use three onions (the more the merrier) and up the amound of paprika as well.  The soup turns out delicious with a spicy kick as well.  I can't give this enough stars!!

Really good mushroom soup, but WAY too many onions. I would suggest only adding about 1 cup.

A very tastey and comforting soup!  I did add extra mushrooms (1.5 lbs) as others suggested.  I didn't use dill or the parsley, but added some cooking sherry during the first and second simmer (about 3 Tbsp total) which was wonderful.  A must try - I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

This soup was good but not great. I was hoping it would be like The Old Wives Tales (in Portland, Or) as one of the other reviews suggested, but it was too thin and missing something. I put in more Hungarian paprika, used mushroom stock and added some cornstarch but still not quite the same. I’ll probably make it again for the bf.

This is now one of my family's favorite recipes! I use vegetable broth in place of chicken broth and omit the salt because it is just a little too salty for our tastes with it.

Wonderful! Very rich and a great flavor. It is pretty heavy, so just having a side salad along with it makes a perfect dinner. Thanks for sharing.

Amazing soup Cathy! I used evoo to saute my vegies and then used the butter to make a roux to thicken the soup instead of the milk/flour combination. Lite sour cream worked wonderfully in this recipe. I even added a bit of sherry to the soup. The dill and paprika were truly a very flavorable addition and my whole family said that this was now one of their favorite soups! Thanks so much!

We LOVE this recipe!  It's rich and unique. I make it often, for family and guests and it's always a big hit! I think the only changes I make are that I use margarine instead of butter and dried parsley instead of fresh.

Excellent quality, just not my taste. 
Edited 12/9/05 I tried it again, leaving out the paprika and it was fantastic! I'm glad I tied again. This is sure to become a staple in my house.

I really loved this!  It is a great comfort food, but also could be nice for guests.  I didn't use dill because I don't care for it.  I also just used dried parsley.  I used light sour cream, you don't boil the soup after you add the sour cream, so it worked great!  This is very filling for not having any meat.  Thank you Cathy, I will make this again!

Fabulous!! Husband ate 3 bowls for dinner! I used white button and baby bella mushrooms. I also used 4 c. of chicken broth instead of 2, used 1 c. of fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, and used lite sour cream. I loved the flavor of the dill! This was a very different and tasty soup. Will make again!

We don't like spicy hot, so I reduced the paprika to one teaspoon, thinking that would be enought to leave the soup with a little kick. Was I wrong. Hot, hot, hot! So after making the soup, I started again from scratch, this time leaving out the paprika altogether. Very good. For a nice presentation, I put a generous dab of sour cream on the soup once it was in each bowl and then sprinkled the chopped parsley on top, rather than stirring the two into the cooking pot.

I was excited to try this based on the reviews...but was a little disappointed.  I found the soup only average.  Maybe it was my mushroom choice- I used white and oyster mushrooms.

This is a hearty soup.  I like it with less dill.  It is less rich, but equally as good,  without the sour cream.  I add it or not depending on what else I am serving.

I tried this recipe when I happened to have an abundance of mushrooms. Several different types and my husband and I ate almost the entire pot that night. I've made it quite often since then and thinking about it now makes me want some.

Followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and used half butter, half olive oil.  Also instead of milk, I used 1/2 c regular and 1/2 c fat-free half-and-half.  I did not have broth so substituted 3 Knorr chicken boullion cubes and omitted the teaspoon of salt.  Very good!

I made this soup for a soup fundraiser at work and I can't believe how many people have asked me for the recipe.  He was delicious.  I did cut the amount of onion in half.

This soup is really good. The second time I made it I used half the dill weed, and it was better. Surely, I will make this many times over!

I enjoyed this soup very much!  I will cut the dill in half next time; that was a little strong for me.  This is a keeper!

Very flavorful - almost on the spicy side, perhaps because of the paprika. Overall a terrific soup!

Easy  to make if you have a foor processer.  It would be a pain to do all that chopping.  Was a quick dinner and family seemed to enjoy it.  I hated it but I hate mushrooms.  Didn't enjoy the broth of it too much either.  Would make it again if Family asked.

Fantastic recipe, especially for mushroom lovers! And you can really cut the fat by using skim milk and light sour cream - the soup may have been a touch thinner, but the flavor didn't suffer at all. We just added a little extra flour and more mushrooms.

Thank you Cathy! This was as wonderful as every review I read before trying it. The only slight change I made was adding a bit of minced garlic to the onion before sauteeing it, guess it's my old Italian habit. I also used 1 percent milk and "lite" sour cream to cut down a few calories. The soup was absolutely tasty anyway! I served it as my entree, with a fresh baked, sun-dried tomato bread. Mmm, Mmm, Good! Thanks for the great recipe!

This soup was fantastic, very rich and delicious, but extremely easy to make.  Much more interesting than the usual cream of mushroom soup.  I will absolutely be making this again.

So good!  I've been looking for a wonderful Hungarian Mushroom Soup recipe since having it in my favorite restaurant.  I think this is better than their since I can season it to my taste.  Thank you so much!

My wife and I really liked the flavor of this soup.  However, even though I used 2% milk and lite sour cream, I still found it to be too creamy in texture.  Next time I'll try adding more broth and milk and hope it doesn't dillute the awesome flavor.
