I used to work at Baby Doe's and have searched for years to find a soup like theirs.  This is wonderful and brings back some great memories.  I like it best with a lighter beer.  My husband bought a dark ale one time and it was a bit overpowering, but still a great soup.  Thanks for sharing!

Baby Doe's Matchless Mine in Dallas has long been a family tradition and the "Beer Cheese Soup" has been a lifelong favorite of mine (I would always ask for an extra cup).  This recipie is very authentic.  I, too have reduced the amount of W'sauce as the first batch was a little "fishy". Wife loved it, kids liked it as well.  I have found a new "Soup and Sandwich Lunch" staple at the Hawke house.  Just a note:  they originally used Coors beer (in the 70's anyway) not dark beer.  I made it with both and the results, while completely different, are both delicious!  Thanks for bringing back wonderful childhood memories!!!

Made some slight modifications to the original recipe per other reviewers suggestions - less Worcestershire sauce, more cornstarch.  My grocery store doesn't carry Cheese-Whiz so I used a 16 oz bar of Velveeta instead.  Coors was my beer of choice.  The soup was easy and fast to put together and absolutely delicious.  Two friends have already asked for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I've had the original and this is pretty good. I used Newcastle beer which gave it great flavor. The tablespoon of Hot sauce gave it alot of kick, so next time I'll maybe use half. Added the extra cornstarch and still wasn't as thick as I would have liked. I paired it with some Sourdough Rye bread and it was fabulous!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I have tasted the soup in Baby Jane Doe's restaurant and this does not taste anything like the soup I remember....It was VERY beer tasting and if I ever made it again I would definitely use less beer.

I've never eaten at Baby Doe's so I can't compare to the original, but it was a really good cheese soup.  I reduced the worchestershire sauce and hot sauce because I'm a little bit of a wimp.  I used concentrated chicken stock instead of bullion, so I added a touch more salt.  And I added a package of sharp cheddar cheese because the cheese flavor wasn't too strong.  It added a nice texture, thickened the soup up a bit and it was just the flavor I was missing.  Overall I'd make it again - next time I'll have bacon on hand though.  The garlic croutons I added helped it out too - I might use garlic salt instead of plain salt next time I think that would be a nice flavor add.

Not bad. The beer cheese soup I've had in the past was very thick and I thought it was very thin so I added more corn starch and doubled the cheese. I also added bacon and I used Guinness. The beer is pretty strong so make sure you use a flavorful beer. After I doctored it up it was quite tasty.

This soup looked and smelled really good but when it came to tasting there was way too much of a beer flavor for me. If I make it again I will cut the amount of beer at least by half.

The flavor was a little strong to me - the processed cheese sauce I used had anchovies in it (Cheese Whiz), and witht he Worcestershire sauce, that was a little too much anchovy.  Next time, I will add less W. sauce.  Also, I had to add some extra corn starch.  My husband loved it.

Yum! This is great! We loved it! I used a Busch's light beer, and I added a container of Kraft Old English sharp cheddar spread. Lovely flavor and wonderful consistency!

Warning, the beer/alcohol taste in this recipe is very strong.  I am not a beer drinker, but I usually like beer flavoring (beer brats, beer burgers, etc.).  The beer flavor in this soup was just too strong for me.  Perhaps cutting the beer down to 6 oz. would help.

Whenever we go to the Renaissance Festival in our area we have cheddar ale soup.  Recently my husband asked if I could make it at home.  I chose this recipe because it looked like the simplest one available.  It was a huge hit!  I knew it was a success when my husband called home from a business trip asking for the recipe so that he could make it for friends.  Did I mention my husband doesn't cook?  Even he could make the soup a success.

Worth time and effort to make this soup. If two only are to partake of this soup recipe,then its contents should be somehow reduced, unless one 
wants to enjoy this soup daily for a few days. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it so much that I easily grant this soup a four star plus rating.
