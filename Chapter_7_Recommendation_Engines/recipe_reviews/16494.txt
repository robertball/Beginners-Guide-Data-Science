WOW! This salad is FANTASTIC! I don't normally get so excited about a salad, but this was just amazing! I did add 2t minced garlic and made this salad a little more on the "wet" side by using 3T of both lemon juice and olive oil.  I also used garlic-and-herb feta. What an amazing combination of flavors! What a nice twist to the everyday typical salads we're all used to.  This is my NEW favorite salad! This is a flavor sensation! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This recipe took a little longer than the 20 minutes stated.  It took me 40 minutes to make.  I love the mix of fresh ingredients together and that is is a very healthy and easy side dish.  I doubled this recipe to take to a party and made 4 times the amount of lemon juice and olive oil dressing.  Very delicious!  This is going to be my new summer picnic recipe when I am asked to bring a side dish.

So my sister wound up with a $12 block of feta cheese (it's a long story) and we wanted to use it up before it went bad.  A simple ingredient search and this popped up.  And it was awesome.  We served this at Thanksgiving and wound up doubling the recipe (made 4-5 times dressing, also.)  I added just a bit of red vinegar because we were running short of lemon juice, and it tastes amazing.  I even took some of my sister's feta (shhh!) so I can make it again once we're out of the leftovers.  A nice light salad for whatever type of dinner!  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

I doubled the recipe but instead of using 2 cans of kidney beans, I used one can of kidney beans and one can of garbanzo beans (chickpeas).  Next time I'll use fresh cilantro instead of parsley. Tomato-basil feta is great in this!!

This is FANTASTIC and EASY!! My husband and I ate it as a main dish tonight. I added ground pepper and extra fresh garlic. I may even try artichoke hearts next time, but it is perfect as is. pkincaid

This is a favorite of mine! The cabbage makes it a good salad for picnics and BBQ's, as it doesn't wilt easily. I have tried making it several different ways by
using a combination of garbonzo and kidney beans, added a clove of minced garlic, and used cilantro instad of parsley with awesome results everytime. Enjoy!

WOW!!!  Fantastic!  I added the dressing the night before and then added another dose of it before serving.  I tell you what, this was easy and it was a huge hit at our bbq for the 4th.

This was a great salad.  I only change I made was to use cilantro in place of parsley and it was much better the third day.

Not everyone will eat this, but I found it a great salad. Had to sub cilantro for parsley; pigeon peas for kidney beans; white onions for green. And tripled the dressing.

Love the fact you can make this salad up to 3 days ahead!  I added the Feta just before serving though.  Also, used 1 can Cannellini beans (white kidney beans) & 1 can garbanzo beans with the dark red kidney beans.  Couldn't find fresh parsley & don't like the dried, so I left it out.  Thought the dressing was too light, so tossed in a splash or two of bottle Garlic Italian dressing.  Also, added a yellow bell pepper & used a red onion instead of green onions.  Oh!  Used Tomato basil crumbled feta cheese.

Yum! This is a really good salad, and I'm not a kidney bean fan to begin with. The only single change I made was using dried parsley instead of fresh (it is what I had on hand). I let this one sit over night, and it tasted great. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely fantastic! I have made this for my steak & potatoes husband and also for a backyard BBQ & it was a HUGE HIT both times! The only thing I did was used garbanzo beans, the tomato & basil feta and I also added a little balsamic vinegar. This is my new default potluck dish, especially in the summer. THANK YOU!

I had to modify based on what I had on hand (don't be mad!) but this was the perfect lunch.  I used napa cabbage (which I have in abundance), orange bells (my fave!) and pinto beans.  Also for the vinaigrette I had to use lime.  BUT....it was delicious :)  I think garbanzo beans would be delicious in this, perhaps with cilantro as some others have mentioned.  This was a filling, satisfying lunch that did not make me drowsy at the end of my workday!

Excellent recipe.  Good by itself, or added to a green salad or chef salad (with a little ranch dressing).  Added 1 cup of corn kernels and 1/2 cup chopped celery.

The best recipe that I have yet to try from the site.  Super quick and very fresh tasting. Also huge portions and low points values makes it an excellent Weight Watchers recipes.

This is fabulous!  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used fresh cilantro instead - my favorite.  I used Atheno's Feta with Basil and Tomato and it gave it just the right kick. As someone else suggested I also used a little chopped red onion and I added a tablespoon red wine vinegar to the olive oil, garlic and lemon juice mix which I doubled from the original.  I used extra cabbage so threw in both the kidney and the garbanzo beans.  Will definitely make this again.

A very tasty salad. I have made it a few times and the only changes I made were to add 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and I used a small spanish/red onion instead of 2 green onions. And I also used "Olive and Oregano" Feta cheese.
But the original recipe is still really amazing.

This has a great mix of flavors that gets better the longer it sits. I recommend trying it with a garlic and herb feta, that really takes it to another level. So simple and yet so delish, thanks for sharing!

Great salad!I was a little bit nervous to bring to my mom's birthday party.Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I used black beans instead and other colors of bell peppers.Also,I used a little less of feta cheese!

I like the combination of flavors, except for the cabbage. It was too strong and too crunchy. I would probably make it again using a cole-slaw mix you buy in the store because my cabbage didn't break apart well. Or I would cook the shredded cabbage in a pan for about 5 minutes just to take some of the stiffness out.

This recipe is pretty much identical to one from Anne Lindsay's Lighthearted Everyday Cooking.. I made a few changes to the recipe seen here- I used a 19oz can of white kidney beans because I prefer them to the red kind, used 1 cup chopped cabbage and 1 cup shredded carrot, feta cheese that was marinated in red peppers and olive oil, and I added a bit of sugar to the mix too as I thought the dressing was a little sharp. My best advice for this recipe: make it the day before!! I mixed all the ingredients together and chilled for 3 hours before eating, which definitely was not long enough, the flavours were all much too aggressive. I tried it again today and it was SO much better, everything blended together perfectly. This is a great recipe :)

I used yellow bell peppers and added a little spinach and the colors were BEAUTIFUL.  I  put in garlic and herb feta so I left the fresh garlic out.  Definitely add more lemon juice and olive oil and let the salad sit for a while.  I've tried this without cabbage (because I dislike it so much) and it still works.

Just like Kimar, I doubled the recipe and used 1 can of garbanzos and 1 of kidney beans.  I made it 2 days before I served it, and put in half the cabbage the first day and the other half on the second.  This added new textures to the salad, since the 1st batch wilted somewhat.  I also quadrupled (or more) the amount of oil and lemon juice.  I made it without feta, and found that I needed to add some salt.  My 10 guest 'guinea pigs' all had positive comments about how unusual, tasty, and visually appealing they found the salad.  It's a keeper!

Tasty and easy to prepare. The cabbage gives the salad a nice crunch and the feta has the right amount of sharpness. All in all, a very satisfying and light salad that went perfect with our barbecue.

I thought the mixture of kidney beans, chopped cabbage & feta was an interesting combination.  My husband liked it better than I did though.  I thought it needed something, even with the feta.  Maybe adding some Italian dressing would make it less dry & a little more flavorful.

This is pretty good.  My husband said it was okay, but he isn't a big fan of feta.  It's a nice change from coleslaw.

I like it. The tart lemony taste suits me.  The rest of the household says it is too bitter.  It is in the fridge now marinating in its own juices.  After awhile, I will tweak it to make it more palatable to the non-lemon lovers.

Impressive salad!  The ingredients are cheap and delicious at the same time.  I didn't use the parsley (because I didn't have it ) but next time I will.  I will definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe for an everyday meal.   I will probably make again when I need to use up some cabbage.   I would serve this only to family; I would not serve to guests.   OK, but boring.

Delicious as is but also good with blue cheese instead of feta if you like the creamy tang of that. This recipe doubles easily (and uses up more of the head of cabbage) so I always double it and have leftovers the next day.

Great salad and very adaptable to what you have on hand!  I didn't use cabbage as I didn't have it.  Used both a red and yellow bell pepper and used a balsamic dressing instead of the lemon (just because I didn't have any lemons and had to improvise).  The best part is the feta which I put on top of the salad-it's what makes the salad perfect.  I served it over a bed of chopped romaine lettuce and it was fantastic-absolutely delicious; can't wait for lunch tomorrow!!

Very tasty and easy! The only changes I made based on what I had on hand was to use white onion instead of green onions, green pepper instead of red, and I used only 4 oz. of feta. I would use the recommended amount of feta next time because I love the tanginess of the feta and lemon juice.  I also didn't have any parsley, but it was fine without it.

This was a very good, easy one-dish meal. I used half white kidney beans (the market was out of red) and half garbanzos, but next time I'll do all garbanzos. The feta and lemon combine for just the right amount of tanginess, and the beans smooth out any bite. This might be good with tomatoes, too.

- I forgot the cabbage but it was still good
- very easy
- added corn and shredded carrots which made it way better
- maybe ad greek olives next time
- sub garlic powder for garlic

This is a wonderful recipe for a mixed (vegetarian and no-vegetarian) crowd. With some crusty bread, it is a main course in itself, but it also goes well with any grilled meat. The feta and cabbage make it different than other bean salads. A great shortcut is to use prechopped coleslaw mix insted of chopping your own cabbage. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was really good! I used romaine instead of cabbage, and added fresh basil. Next time I'll add some cherry tomatoes, but it was a really nice filling salad!!

I have modified this since the first time and still LOVE it!!  I use Tomato Basil Feta, Italian Flat Leaf Parsley, and Red onion in place of the listed ingredients.  I also add 1 can of white kidney beans and grape tomatoes (whole). If I have it around, I will add some chopped fresh Basil. I do not use the cabbage, but will serve it over lettuce in a wrap or pita. Everybody I have served this to have absolutely loved it.  Simple, fast, colorful, and healthy!

This was very flavorful.  I used tomato-basil feta instead of the regular feta which gave it the missing flavor other reviewers mentioned.  I look forward to sharing this with others.

This is wonderful - way better than the usually musty-tasting and boring bean salads.  I used red onion instead of green and didn't have cabbage, it tasted fine.  Lots of lemon juice and some ground pepper make it more flavorful.

Very nice, a change from the traditional bean salad.  I used a couple different kinds of beans.  Good right away and later, too... depends if you like your cabbage crunchy or wilted.  I used napa cabbage (that's what I had).

This was a great salad. I skipped the lemon juice and used balsamic vinegar instead. The salad got rave reviews. The only thing I would do differently is use less onion. I think the onions I had were particularly strong and it was a bit overpowering. With less onion, it will be perfect. I also used the tomato basil feta which was great!!!

this was totally delicious.  i doubled it and used a can each of chickpeas and kidney beans, a yellow pepper, and a red onion.  and both parsley and cilantro (it would have been better if they had been fresh, but my dried spices were fine).  very filling!

This salad was absolutely delicious!  I do not like regular cabbage that much, so I bought something called and asian cabbage, which doesn't have that strong of a taste and is more on the lettuce side.  I added some celery for extra crunch and to make it more refreshing.  I also used the garlic and herb feta cheese, instead of regular.  Even though I forgot to buy parsley for it, it turned out great.  I also added a pinch of salt and a little black pepper. I will probably be making this salad once a week for a long time.  I ate a whole bowl of it.  I think next time I will eat it with grilled chicken or fish for a more complete dinner. This is my new favorite dish.

I used garbanzo beans, doubled the lemon juice and olive oil, and added ground black pepper. This salad is cool, crunchy and so tasty! I'll definitely make it again. I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow.

I really like this recipe. It has two of my favorite ingredients, kidney beans and feta cheese. I substituted a small sweet onion for the green onions because I didn't want to wait for a grocery run before trying the recipe.

We liked this salad a lot.  I didn't have any red beans on hand, so substituted garbanzos, as someone else suggested.  My feta was pre-seasoned with herbs, and that worked well.  Fresh scallions from the garden (no parsley yet, so didn't add any).

Family LOVES this Salad!!!

The only things I did different was: I used the Prepackaged Shredded Cole Slaw Salad & I used the Garlic & Herb Crumbled Feta Cheese. Have made it quite a few times & the Family REALLY LOOOOVES this! Thank you.

This one is a little heavy on the lemon juice for my man's taste.  I like it though.
I made this again using tequila instead of lemon juice and the man liked it a lot more.

This is the easiest salad to throw together! Very colourful and a nice alternative to the usual. The first time I made it I found it a bit to garlicky and not enough dressing. The second time I doubled the lemon & olive oil and reduced the garlic to 1/2 tsp and it was great! I didn't have a red pepper the second time and it was just as good without it.

Pretty salad but really lacked in flavor.  Added Annie's Goodness dressing, romaine and tomato to it the next day  and that helped it.

I love this recipe. I have made it many times. I like to use purple cabbage if serving immediately because it looks quite nice. Purple cabbage will color the feta cheese purple if it sits overnight (but still tastes great)

I was excited to try this salad as I like all of the ingredients it calls for. Not quite as great as I thought it would be. Yes, it is a healthy salad and it is quite filling. I like cabbage but not sure if this would have been better with a romaine lettuce or another more mild green. All of the other flavors work well together, but in my opinion, the cabbage is too overpowering in this salad.

Who'd have thought (especially with a meat lovin' man)?  THIS SALAD IS FABULOUS AS A MAIN DISH IN PITA OR FLAT BREAD WITH GREEK SALAD.... ummmmm! It was sort of an accident that happened when my meat lovin' husband was hungrier than usual, so when the meat ran out, he folded this lovely salad inside bread rounds. With our favorite Greek Salad on the side, he was happy as a kid - going on and on about it! He's been so please with this salad as a meatless meal ever since! - - - When we have time, we like to make flat bread rounds using the italian whole wheat rolls from this site (just leave out the yeast). The flavor and texture of those bread rounds is excellent with this cabbage/bean salad.  Thanks, Daylene!

I have made this salad two times.  Once with garbanzo beans, and the other time with kidney beans.  Either way, this salad is amazing!!  Followed the recipe to a T, and wouldn't change a thing!

I really enjoyed this hearty salad. I do recommend doubling the garlic, lemon juice and olive oil. I finely minced about 2 tablespoons of regular vidalia onion because I didn't have green onions, but this turned out very yummy.

I made this without the cabbage and added diced tomatoes.  LOVED IT! You could easily server it over lettuce, which I will do next time.  I didn't have it on hand.  I also used regular yellow onion and dried parsley.  Lemon juice, olive oil, and feta cheese are one of my favorite flavors!!!  The kidney beans, and pepper give it great texture and good for you to boot!

Wow! This salad is so amazing!! I didn't even think I liked cabbage. I made it exactly as written and it was fantastic, but I might try as others have mentioned doubling it but using a kidney bean/garbanzo bean mix.

I LOVE this salad, have made it many times. It has a lot of feta, so if you don't like it this is not the salad for you. It's just very flavorful, crunchy, and delicious. It is also good as leftovers.

Love it!  If you're looking to boost your fiber intake without resorting to eating crunchy sticks and twigs, make this as a side for your next dinner.  I do tend to punch up the dressing with a few herbs, but that's me.  It is just fine as is.  Wonderful addition to the picnic basket as there is it is not mayo based and generally will not spoil.  This is in my picnic file as well as a frequest "ok, I grilled some chicken, now what should I make with it" file... and generally my lunch the next day with some sliced grilled chicken on top!

I will have to admit...I was worried if I would enjoy this salad and even more worried if my picky eater boyfriend would enjoy it.  I added a bit more garlic to the recipe only because I love garlic.  Otherwise I followed the directions as is.  We LOVED this salad.  We've been having a difficult time convincing ourselves to wait a few days before making another batch!  Wonderful!  Thank you!

3 stars as written for us.  It improved to a 5 star on day two when we added some Italian dressing...made all the difference.  Will use 1/2 the feta and Italian dressing(in lieu of oil and lemon) the next time around.

Everyone has loved this one! I usually triple so will use 1 can kidney beans, 1 can garbanzo, 1 can pigeon peas.  Also use the cole slaw mix and the most colorful peppers I can find -- yellow, orange and red if available.  A very forgiving recipe I find, as I mix ingredients for color and interest.

Yummy....I used cole slaw mix instead of the cabbage, red onion instead of the green, and added some cumin,smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper for more flavor. I loved this salad, I also omitted the cheese for calorie reasons. Loved the beans and the crisp red peppers with the fresh lemon juice. Will make again!

Love kidney beans, love red bell pepper, love cabbage, love feta...  did not love the combination.  I think a different cheese or a different dressing might help.

Good bean salad recipe. Would be good served with tzatziki.

A couple alterations: tomato and red onion instead of peppers and green onions, no cabbage, added chopped olives, artichoke hearts and a little dried thyme.

This was very good.  I used reduced fat feta and fat free Italian dressing instead of the oil and lemon juice.  I agree that it was better the 2nd day.

I used two cans of beans and forgot the red pepper and it was still very good.  My garlic clove was super potent so next time I think I'll use garlic powder instead.  Very yummy and healthful.  I also used the tomato basil feta as suggested.

I have to apologize Daylene for totally mangling her recipe. I almost always alter things, but I got really carried away.....I had left over lentils so I threw those in. The feta really thru me for a loop as I always have tomato & cucumber with my feta(so yep I added it). I didn't have parsley, but not sure I needed it anyways, I also did not add the garlic(just didn't feel like chopping it up). The lemon & oil just wasn't doing it for me soooo i added some Kraft sundried tomato & oregano dressing. Anyways it was good & I got my vegies & beans in! I will try this recipe properly next time!??

Very good.  I had to find something to serve my vegetarian daughter over the 4th, and she loved this!  She said she would add another can of beans to hers just because she likes beans.  I thought it tasted pretty good, too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  I don't like cabbage, so I substituted canned corn, which was pretty good.  I also used orange and yellow pepper instead of a red pepper, and added ground pepper and balsamic vinegar.  Very fresh tasting!

I used a mixture of orange and yellow peppers, which added nice color to the salad.  I also used the basil and tomato feta as suggested by some other reviewers, which added a good dose of flavor.  It could have used a bit more bite, in my opinion, but it was really good.  Good and crunchy, can be made ahead, and the amount of the recipe is just right.

Great recipe!  I made this for a potluck and it was a huge hit!  I used red onion instead of green, and it was outstanding!  Next time, I am going to add artichoke hearts.  Very versatile and a keeper!

Love the ingredients, but felt this salad needed different cheese (maybe Blue or Gorgonzola) and different dressing (maybe red wine or balsamic vinegar based variety).

A perfect salad for a spring evening. Plus, it's so healthy! My husband hates veggies and salads. I made this and he thought it was great! I love that there aren't very many calories in it either. I made a fruit salad and rolls to go along with it and it was a perfect meal. I didn't have the parsley, but it still tasted great! You'll surely enjoy it!

Don't make this without having enough red peppers.  Through some fluke I didn't have enough, and so just got by without having enough (I made the recipie for about 35 girls) and substituting in Roma tomatoes.  The tomatoes were good in the recipie, but it really needs the red peppers.  Otherwise the recipie goes over fairly well.
