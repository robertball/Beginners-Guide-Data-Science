Made this using a barbecue sauce that I made instead of bought.  Loved the addition of baked beans, makes this recipe unique!  Will definitely be making this again!

This is an easy weeknight meal! We loved it! I couldnt find turkey thighs so I used chicken breasts. I will definately make this again.

Awesome recipe! I substituted chicken thighs for the turkey, and it turned out great. Most importantly, I love the fact that I can dump everything into the crockpot the night before and have it ready by lunch time. Perfect recipe for family get-togethers...when you'd rather socialize than cook!

This was very very good. I would definitely make this again. I didn't even have mustard and it came out delicious.

This was just OK.  With the baked beans in there, I thought it pretty much tasted like baked beans on a bun.  The turkey got lost.  Maybe omitting the beans and adding more BBQ sauce would be better.

Excellent and easy recipe.  We used vegetarian baked beans because we don't eat pork.  The turkey fell off the bone.  Next time I will make a bigger batch.  It was a hit around here and easy to make.  The house smelled heavenly all day.

I am allergic to pork, so I am always looking for BBQ recipes that pork lovers and I will all love. We enjoyed this quite a bit. I thought that the beans made it a little starchy, but the flavor was good. Next time I will perhaps add a touch of ketchup or a splash of vinegar to tart it up a little bit.

Made this for the first time tonight and it was delicious! I've never bought turkey thighs before, but this is the right kind of meat for this recipe. I was worried about deboning/skinning the meat when I got home, but it was actually very easy! Will definitely make this again!

I took some of the other suggestions and used half of the beans, still way too much.  My family typically loves beans, but not in the turkey.  The good turkey and seasoning flavors were overpowered by the beans.

Use 3 drumsticks, and one can of beans. It was very soupy otherwise.

Very simple dinner to make. I used chicken breasts instead of turkey. I was weary of the combo with baked beans, but couldn't believe how similar it was to a pulled pork sandwich. Kids loved it too! I felt it was a bit too sweet for my taste, but that could just be from the BBQ sauce I used.

Sized it down for 4 people.  Used left over turkey from Thanksgiving.  Turned out great.  Put on nice kaiser rolls.  Will definitely make it again.  A+

We liked this sandwich a lot! The only thing I would do to change it would be to eliminate the cumin (I thought I'd try it but personally just don't  care for cumin at all). Anyway,  I used Smokehouse flavor  beans and barbecue sauce from the Roasterie in Kansas, City Kansas. You could use any flavor of beans to change up the taste for fun. ??
