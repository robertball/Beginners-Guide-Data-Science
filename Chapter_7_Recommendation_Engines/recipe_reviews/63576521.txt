I usually make my own bbq sauce for chicken, pork & the lil cocktail weiners that usually call for grape jelly & bottled bbq sauce in their recipe.  Decided to try this recipe as it has the ingredients I use in my own recipe, plus, a couple more. This bbq sauce definitely has a nice flavor & I’m thinking it must be from the horseradish which gave it that “lil something extra” that my sauce was missing.  The flavors meld together nicely & the taste just explodes in your mouth!   I’m so glad I ran across this recipe while browsing appetizers for my party
