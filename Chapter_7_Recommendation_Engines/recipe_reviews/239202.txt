I suggest adding some cinnamon and extra flour to the recipe but other just a minor adjustment they baked out well!

Taste delicious, but next time I will add a little more flour. I made 1" balls, did not flatten before baking, and they spread quite thin, almost like a lace cookie. (Baked 7-8 min) Be sure to cool in the pan 3-5 min before moving to racks.
