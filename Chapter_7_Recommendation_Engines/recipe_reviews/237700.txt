This is hands-down my new favorite recipe from the site. I love that the salmon flavor doesn't get masked by all the other ingredients. To make this a teensy bit healthier, I added sautéed spinach and cut-up cherry tomatoes. Perfect.

This came out really nice. I only used 5 eggs and half & half instead of milk. I thought it was a little salty (and I LOVE salt).... so watch out. I will make this again.

This was really yummy!  I have never made quiche with mozzarella cheese before and was a bit skeptical.  I replaced one cup of mozzarella with cheddar for my own level of comfort, and it was delicious!! Will definitely make this again, and again.

Excellent texture and flavor.  You have to be ready for the salmon flavor however because it is not hidden at all by other ingredients.

Fantastic and simple. I had just harvested some oyster mushrooms so i sauteed them with half an onion and roasted garlic. Left out the dill and 2 eggs because of the added volume of ingredients. Simply superb!

It is an excellent quiche and the only reason that I don't give 5 stars is because the number of eggs should be reduced to 5 as well as an appropriate reduction in half and half

Made this exactly to recipe. This makes too much egg/cheese mixture, even tho a deep dish pie crust was used - it overflowed,  and there was still 1+ cups left. Yes, it was tasty, but it got 4 stars because of the waste.

It was good, I added a tiny bit of milk and 2 eggs and made 2 quiches, just because the frozen pie shells come 2 in a box. Sprinkling cheese on top made the topping a bit dry and hard to slice through. Next time I will mix the cheese with the egg mixture.

Jaded....thank you so much for an "Egg-cellent" recipe!  :)  I didn't have all the ingredients called for in the recipe so I made up the combination of diced ham, chopped broccoli (steamed), 1/2 and 1/2, 4-Cheese Mexican blend and, of course, the cream cheese, 8 eggs, a little salt and pepper.....no dill.  I love the idea of the smoked salmon (though would cut down the salmon to 4 oz.) so want to make it to recipe next time.  It is so good that my husband and I are looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

I wish I had read the reviews. There is way too much filling for a 9” pie crust. Cut the ingredients in half or make 2 pies.

used pre-made pie crust;  we like crab with (3) chopped zucchinis, old bay seasoning.  eye-balled the filling - kids like more and less eggy-ness.  
very cheesy with the sour cream and mozzarella - kids approved.

Really delicious Brunch Quiche. I used lite cream in place of the milk for added richness in the egg mixture. I also add a generous amount of Old Bay seasoning to the egg mixture. There was a lot of egg mixture left over using 6 jumbo eggs, but it is better to have too much than not enough. I used 2 pan fried salmon fillets which were on sale instead of smoked salmon. Besides being cost effective this also cut down on the over all saltiness. Next time I would also try sprinkling a few capers and sliced cherry tomatoes for a flavor pop on top of the cream cheese layer as well as mixing in some of the cheese in the egg mixture.  A great garnish next time could be a little more Old Bay and some lemon zest.  Will definitely make again.

Melt in your mouth delicious!  I used salmon that I had smoked with a recipe that called for Yoshida sauce (Teriyaki-like) so my quiche had a special flavor that you would not normally have with every day smoked salmon.  
We reheated the leftovers and enjoyed it all over again.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good.  Cut eggs to 5, cream cheese to 5 ounces, salmon to 4 ounces.  Added mushrooms sauteed with onion and steamed broccoli.  Used 1/2 n 1/2...a little over 1/2 cup.  No salt...but kept cheese the same.

Absolutely delicious! I split it into two pans and froze one of them. It did not reheat well.

Followed the recipe. Egg mixture didn't all fit in the regular pie pan.... maybe use a deep dish??  Did not add any salt but was very salty.... maybe from the salmon?  Seemed like too much mozzarella cheese but I put it in. My husband likes salmon a lot and ate a decent size slice. I didn't care for it and will not make it again.

Love to make quiche. There’s almost  nothing you can’t add as long as you get the milk/egg proportion right...been doing them for years... Thanks for another idea w the salmon!

It was a little rich for me. The cream cheese didn't spread out as I thought it would so I'd recommend smaller square cuts spread everywhere.
