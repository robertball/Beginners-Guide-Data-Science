This recipe had the right balance of lemon and basil. It looks impressive and I was able to utilize common ingredients from my pantry.  Hardly any prep time, too! Just some things to watch; Be careful not to burn the butter or scald the half and half. Once you add the flour and lemon juice, WHISK, WHISK, WHISK.

The lemon basil cream sauce is a perfect compliment to the rich salmon.  It would be tasty over other types of fish too - - even chicken!  I baked my salmon at 400 degrees for 17 minutes.  While that cooked, I made the sauce on the stovetop.  What a simple yet restaurant-quality dish!  Mmm Mmm!

Very good.  Creamy, lemony, and light.  Very refreshing and tasty.  I served it with steamed green beans and potatoes.  Next, I am going to try it with chicken.  
I HIGHLY recommend it.

Although functional, this recipe is not worth its ingredients. The basil is overwhelmed by the lemon and the sauce, despite good fresh ingredients, ends up tasting like it came from a mix. Many of the times are off, too.

This salmon was very very good - the sauce was creamy and easy to make, very good with the fresh basil.  Try it over whole wheat pasta.

Delicious!  This was truly a delight for our tastebuds.  I love how the flavors of basil, lemon and salmon came together.  I ended up adding the whole can of chicken broth (a 14 or 15 oz. can) and 1/4 cup more half-and-half.  Served with whole wheat angel hair pasta, steamed broccoli, and Caprese salad.  Didn't put nearly that much salt in, as the chicken broth (I even used reduced-sodium) is plenty salty already.

Recipe was excellent, but I DID NOT grill the fish.  I baked a 1.75 lb piece of fish in the oven at 350 with lemon juice squeezed all over it for 20 minutes.  Also, I doubled all the ingredients, left out the flour and used a tsp of cornstarch (I do not like the taste of flour as a thickener) and served it over linguini.  Was requested to make again

Gotta tell ya, this one rocked the house. I tend to avoid dishes that require cream, due to the high fat content, but the basil cream sauce was outstanding. Really. And, I followed the reviewers receommendations to make the red onion rice (which was so fast and easy) and it was a wonderful combo. You guys really know what you are doing. I will dine here again : )

Delicious!  Like others, I baked the salmon at 400 for 20 minutes.  I rubbed with salt and pepper, then drizzled with lemon juice and olive oil.  It was incredibly tender and went with the wonderful sauce so well.  The sauce is definately top notch.  This is a dish that seems impressive, but really is very easy to throw together.

This was a very good recipe!  Instead, I used half and half and low fat milk to ease the calories.  I think I added a little too much flour so I thinned it out with broth and a bit of water.  After tasting, the lemon was a little strong, so I added pinches of sugar until it tasted better.  I finally added the basil and it really made a difference!  I will make this again.

This was REAL good. The only changes I made was I added a little more garlic to the sauce, and I also added a pinch of dried dill. I don't have a grill right now, so I coated the salmon with a little olive oil, and sprinkled some chili powder and a little garlic powder on both sides, and broiled it for about 4 minutes per side. Served it with rice and steamed brocolli. The sauce is perfect to put over brocolli. This was a quick and delicious weeknight meal.

This recipe was almost perfect - we thought it needed a little extra flavor, like maybe some extra basil or pepper.  Otherwise, it was great. I baked the salmon at 400 for 17 minutes, and served it with rice.  We definitely recommend it.

My boyfriend and I just finished eating our salmon and I couldn't wait to sit down and give it a full 5 stars! We both loved this recipe. It was more than just a nice change of pace for our twice-weekly salmon meals. I baked my salmon in the oven, since I have no grill. I served the salmon over the Onion Rice recipe (made with red onions) found on this site. The sauce mixed in so tastily with the rice. I can't wait to try the sauce over chicken, and might even try it over beef. Thanks for another great recipe.

This was great! It appealed to my 4 year old because she didn't have to use the sauce and to my 14 yr old and husband because they loved the sauce! I cooked the salmon longer than stated, though.

I loved this easy yet special cream sauce!  It made salmon special with very little effort.  I followed the recipe exactly except I baked the salmon.  The sauce was just a little thick; next time I will tweak the lemon/flour ratio just a little.  The sauce works better when I commit the two minutes whisking time to doing nothing but stirring - no making vegetables, helping with homework, answering the phone, nothing!  If I give it my full attention the texture comes out creamy.  My husband brought home 90 pounds of fish from an Alaska fishing trip last summer, so I will be making this often! Too bad the basil in the garden already froze :-(

Delicious and easy.  My husband and I both loved it.  I served it with whole wheat pasta which went great with the sauce.  My 2 year old also loved the pasta with the cream sauce.  Will definitely make this again.

Delicious is all I can say!  I've made this twice already. The first time I did it on the Foreman grill and the second time I baked it in the oven.  The only modification I made was that I used salmon fillets instead of salmon steaks.  I made it with brown rice and poured the extra sauce all over the rice.  It was a big hit at my house!

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!!!  Awesome, scrumptious, easy.  I baked this for 20 minutes but it's probably even better grilled.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it's perfect.  Everybody (even my picky kids) agreed this is a keeper.

It is a wonderful recipe, no matter how you choose to cook the salmon.  To a previous reviewer who said: My husband absolutely loved this; according to him, it only proves that "we should eat out less, since we can make food just as good or better ourselves."  I fell into that trap early in our marriage.  When my husband said something very similiar, he genuinely meant it as a compliment.  But, it later turned out that I was the ONLY wife in our neighborhood who seldom got to eat out!  NOT cool!

Awesome!  I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half and rub the salmon with olive oil, seasoning salt and paprika.  It's fantastic with rice or pasta as the sauce works for both

What a fabulous recipe-I served it with plain rice, and my family ate all of the salmon I prepared as well as all the rice, just to finish this sauce.  I made the sauce according to the directions and thought it had a lot of flavor.

This sauce was a great compliment to the fish.  I coated a salmon filet with a little olive oil and baked at 400 degrees.  The second time around, I substituted lobster stock for the chicken stock, which gave it a sweeter taste.

Very nice flavor, served over angel hair pasta with salmon on top.  I baked it in the oven, then added the sauce afterwards.

Excellent.  The sauce is to die for!  I too baked my salmon, and as I had some fresh crab, I served this on top of the salmon and then covered the two in the sauce.  With a rice pilaf, steamed asparagus and a glass of white wine, we really has a feast!

Five stars, hands down! This sauce is one of the best things that I have found on this site. Rich and creamy and the lemon-basil flavour is just the perfect combination for fish. Makes quite a lot too so there's no need to double the sauce. Served it with plain boiled potatoes so as not to overwhelm the flavours. If I ever need to impress someone, I'm making this!

I've made this several times for not only my husband, but also for other family and friends.  It's always such a huge hit.  I bake the salmon in the oven, but other than that, I make the recipe just as it says.  It's superb.  We make extra sauce so that we can put it over angel hair pasta.  Great!!

Picked up fresh basil from Farmer's Market and decided to make this sauce. I saved some grated lemon rind and made the sauce with fat free half & half. I was amazed at how thick the sauce was. Inspired by it's luscious creaminess, I cooked & added basil pasta that I picked up on my last trip to Italy. Served this as a side dish with chiffon basil and lemon zest on top, then grilled, sliced, and fanned a rib-eye steak. I give it 5 stars because the sauce was incredible with fat free half&half. Next, I'm going to poach & chill salmon, flake it on top a crostini and rather than basil, add dill to the sauce. Can't wait!!

I live in Alaska and I made this for FRESH ocean king steaks tonight for dinner. OMG!!! No restaurant could touch this meal for less than $30 a plate.  Five stars just isn't enough for this one.  To die for!!! I only had one lemon so I didn't have quite 1/4 cup of juice but was still very lemony.  I also used fresh lemon basil from my greenhouse and a few more cloves of garlic.  My husband thought he died and went to heaven.

My husband and I loved it. We are both fisherman and are always looking for a simple and quick recipe to use with the catch. We will definitely be using this recipe again. I used the "George Foreman grill" and the salmon was perfect.

Sauce is great - don't overcook the salmon - it needs the delicate sauce on
a lightly sauteed or lightly grilled fish.

The lemon sauce was thick and creamy!  Great addition to the Salmon.  I grilled the salmon on low on the bbq for about 15 minutes or so wrapped in foil with the sauce on top on the salmon.  It turned out great and tasted wonderful!

This is a really tasty recipe. The only change we made to the sauce was to use 3 parts cream to 1 part milk (instead of "half and half"). We only sauteed the salmon, and it turned out wonderfully. My husband absolutely loved this; according to him, it only proves that "we should eat out less, since we can make food just as good or better ourselves." We had some leftover sauce, so the next night I heated it up with chicken stock and chopped portobello mushrooms, and spread it over chicken breasts. I didn't think it was as good this way, but my husband did. We will definitely make this again.

This recipe was AWESOME! I had some frozen salmon that had to be used so I pan-fried it and flaked it into the sauce and served it over a four cheese ravioli. I didn't have any half n half so I substituted more chicken broth (2 cups) and added 3 tbsp of butter.

Okay, anyone can cook salmon so the sauce is the real recipe here...and it was delicious! I didn't have any lemon so I replaced it with more chicken broth. I used condensed chicken broth without diluting it. I was worried because it is LEMON basil cream but it turned out so well. We had it with grilled salmon one night and pan fried shrimp the next. Excellent!

The sauce is fabulous to use on pasta with shrimp or chicken. Add grated lemon zest to the sauce for even more flavor.

Add me as anoher person who doesn't have a grill. I am glad others baked this before with success. I followed their examples and baked the salmon first rubbed with a little olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper. The cream sauce I wasn't that thrilled with. It probably had a lot to do with the fact that I had to substitute evaporated skim milk, but I didn't taste very much seasoning in it. Next time I'll try this with the half and half and some more seasoning.

Wow!  This is tasty!  I also baked the salmon rather than grilling and I used evaporated skim milk in place of the half and half to cut down on fat.  It worked great.  Will definitely make again.
