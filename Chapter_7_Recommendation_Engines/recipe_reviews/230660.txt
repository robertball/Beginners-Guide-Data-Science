I made this pretty much as is, using 1/2 cup orange juice, 1 tsp ground ginger and 1 T. minced garlic (instead of pastes). I served it over parboiled white rice. I was concerned about the sweet-and-sour-sounding combination of ingreds, because my husband hates too much sweet-and-sour, but he raved over this and declared it a do-over. I served peas and carrots on the side, but next time might try adding in snow peas or frozen broccoli in the last few minutes of cooking. A definite keeper!

What a wonderful recipe!  Made it for the first time this evening, and everyone really enjoyed it. The only modification that I made was to add 8oz of snow peas that I had on hand.  Excellent meal for a weeknight, when you want something special!

Very quick and tasty recipe. I amended by adding rough chopped onions and a teaspoon of cornstarch to dust the cubed chicken. Plus salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste. Note: Added cornstarch makes sauce thicken quicker and creates crisped edges on stir-fried chicken cubes.

This was very tasty. I think it could have used some veggies and a shake of red pepper flakes. I'll make this again

A really good and easy recipe. I didn't have ginger or garlic paste; however, finely chopped fresh ginger and garlic worked just fine. I sauteed red bell peppers, onion, and carrots and then set those aside while I cooked the chicken and the sauce. When the chicken was done, I added in the veggies and mixed it all together. A definite make again!

Super quick and super delicious. I can tell you the sauce as written will reduce into a perfect sticky glaze, but you need to have the pan hot enough. Be advised all the honey will go from glaze to burnt very quickly, once it begins to thicken I don't take my eyes off it. For our tastes we like a bit of sesame oil and hot pepper flakes for extra flavor, but as written this is wonderful. Thanks so much for sharing!

We love this as an alternative to Panda Express's Orange chicken. We also use chili powder or red pepper flake to give it kick. I use concentrated orange juice when in bind. I also just use garlic powder and ginger powder and adjust until it tastes like we like. It is super easy if I can do it. We also double the sauce and add broccoli/frozen vegies to help it go further. Also good if you bread up chicken in cornstarch and fry then put sauce on but love it without too. we then just put over white rice and eat!

This recipe was awesome! My husband and I LOVED it and we will be adding it to our regular meals. I used 1 Big orange squeezed by hand . It came out to be about half cup and then I filled up to one cup with minute maid. I used kikimoko soya sauce , a teaspoon of minced garlic ( I had no paste) , two minimal shakes of ginger from the spice rack ( we're not big fans of ginger) and the honey I have for my tea in the cupboard. I diced up the chicken and put it in a bowl with some corn starch and paprika for color coated the chicken and fried it up a bit before I added the liquid ingredients and added a dash of red pepper flakes - it turned out PERFECT ! Absolutely loved it

Was easy to make, I added fresh garlic and ginger as that is what I had on hand. Tossed some red pepper, onion, and asparagus in to complete it as a meal. I didn't think it was going to thicken up for a while but it did! :)

Great recipe! I used minced garlic instead of garlic paste, and added red pepper flakes after reading suggestions. Because comments varied from people using anywhere from 1/2 cup to 1.5 cups of orange juice, I used one cup and thought it was delicious. If you wanted a less strong orange taste, 1/2 cup would work great. Like other reviews, I thought the sauce was not ever going to thicken but right around 20 minutes it came together wonderfully! I also added shredded broccoli, onions, red bell pepper, and matchstick carrots. I sautéed them first, and then added them to the chicken mixture right as sauce was thickening up. Served over white rice. Will definitely make again!

After reading all of the great reviews, I’m beginning to think I did something wrong.  I could not get the sauce thick or sticky in the recommended cook time.  I removed the chicken because it was cooked beyond dry and let the sauce continue simmering.  The sauce was o.k., but I couldn’t taste any orange flavor at all.   It might have been better if the chicken wasn’t so overcooked

Easiest orange chicken dish I've ever made. And the whole family liked it - even my pickiest 8year old!  I doubled the recipe and wondered if sauce would ever thicken, so I used a little cornstarch and it worked great.  Next time I'll try adding it to the chicken before cooking.  I also added just a pinch of brown sugar to ensure the kiddos would eat it.  Husband added red pepper flakes at the table.  Served with broccoli and brown rice.

What a great, quick dinner! I added the zest of one orange and some chopped carrots and broccoli. I didn't have the pastes, so I used minced garlic cloves and ground ginger. Delicious! Even my picky toddlers ate it up!

I think this recipe was Delish!  Gives you something else to do with chicken breast than the usual boring recipes.  I read other reviews and used suggestions. I used minced garlic and grated fresh ginger also tossed my chicken cubes in cornstarch. Put over brown rice with green beans on the side sprinkled with scallion.  Wonderful Dish!!

I loved the flavor but found that the chicken was overdone by the time the sauce thickened. Next time I think I'll cook the sauce about 10 minutes before adding the chicken. Will definitely make again though!

Great simple recipe! I didn't have time to wait for it to thicken (and I was suspect that it would at all), so I added a tablespoon of cornstarch (in a little cold water) as it boiled and it thickened up wonderfully :)

We loved this recipe!  We actually used Gluten free soy sauce.  It was delicious.  I did have to remove the chicken after it was thoroughly cooked and let the sauce simmer longer so it would reduce and thicken without overcooking the chicken.  I also added some orange zest from the oranges too. It really gave it a lot more flavor. I will be making this one again.

I used fresh clementine oranges from my Aunt's tree, and grated the garlic and ginger. I did use some corn starch to thicken it a bit. Also added frozen sugar snap peas. Served with white rice. Whole family went nuts it was sooo good!

The recipe called for too much ginger for my taste. I used breaded chicken, so I doubled the sauce ingredients. Next time, I will use half the ginger.

Pretty good. I added snow peas, carrots and broccoli. Stir fried those first, removed them, then added the chicken and sauce ingredients. I realized the chicken was going to be cooked way before the sauce would cook down, so I had to remove that, finishing cooking down the sauce, then add meat and veggies back in. The flavor was good, just be sure to cook the meat first and remove before cooking down the sauce, or you will end up with way over cooked chicken. Maybe remove a little of the sauce ingredients to marinate the meat with before you cook it...?  Good flavor, though.

Really good.  I used fresh garlic and ginger because I wasn't sure where to find paste.  I did use less ginger to suit our tastes.  Served over rice.  I liked that there was extra sauce to pour over the rice.

This was delicious! I added red pepper flakes and almonds to give it a little more flavor.

I made this with some variations and it was very good. coated chicken with corn starch and browned in sesame oil, then added other ingredients and brought to a boil, added sliced peppers and mushrooms and simmered until sauce began to thicken and peppers were crisp/tender.

Delicious! I followed another review and used 1tsp ground ginger and 1tbsp minced garlic that I had on hand. I also switched out the soy for for coconut aminos and used agave syrup instead of honey due to allergies in my family. It worked great! I let the chicken and sauce cook until the sauce reduced and was sticky.

I finely chopped two cloves of garlic and finely chopped approximately a tablespoon of fresh ginger.   I used a half cup of orange juice but wished I had only used a third of a cup.  I took Linda T's recommendation and added a few pepper flakes.  I also added sugar snap peas and served over noodles.   It was delicious.

I’ve made this recipe 3 times now, always following the recipe ingredients exactly. The only change I made was simmering the sauce for 10-12 minutes first, then adding the chicken to the pan after for another 10 minutes. Otherwise, you will definitely over cook the chicken. The sauce will thicken it just takes about 22-25 min to do so. Next time I’ll try a little orange zest for more orange flavor. NOTE: you can find ginger paste and garlic paste in the chilled produce section near the fresh herbs. They come in squeeze tubes. I found a brand called Gourmet Garden.

This was great!  I did dust the chicken with some cornstarch and got it started in some oil before adding the sauce.  I added some red pepper flakes to the sauce and used fresh garlic and ginger (what is ginger paste?!)  I also added onions, broccoli and diced red pepper to the chicken toward the end of cooking.  Will make again!

Tasted like the restaurant made it. I used a pound of precooked shrimp instead, mixed the sauce in a bowl, added to the pan before the shrimp, I added a yellow onion and half of a bell pepper, I doubled the sauce, I think some heat wouldn’t hurt,  when the sauce started to cook down I added cornstarch to thicken it. I also cooked some veggies and some rice to go with it.

Easy, simple, quick and wonderful. I made the garlic paste and ginger paste with a hand blender because the local stores did not carry these items. Just combine equal amounts of fresh garlic and fresh ginger and grind fine to add to ingredients.

this was a great base for what i ended up making.. i marinated a 1 lb cut of salmon with great results.. i used the juice of 1 1/2 oranges, 1/3 c soy sauce, the equivalent of fresh garlic and ginger, and left out the honey.. i also added about 1 T of sambal oelek for some heat.. the end product was out of this world.. instead of discarding the marinde i heated it up and used it as a dipping sauce.. i also added some of it to my salad like a dressing.. SO GOOD.. thank you for the inspiration!

Like another reviewer said, the sauce never got thick.  I ended up adding cornstarch and then it was great.  If I had waited until the sauce thickened on its own, the chicken would have been touch as nails.  But with the cornstarch, it was wonderful.  I think this would be just as good with beef strips.  I also will make it again and add other vegetables to the recipe.  The fresh orange flavor was great and I also added orange zest which boosted the orange flavor.

This is super delish! The only change I made was to coat chicken pieces in cornstarch and marinate with sauce for a few hours before cooking. Also, I cooked for only 10 mins to completely cook.

The sauce was fantastic but cooking little pieces of chicken for 20 minutes,  while the sauce reduced to the correct consistency, really dried out the meat.  I will make the recipe again but will start the sauce first and add the chicken about 10 minutes in.

This was delicious and easy to make!  I substituted crushed garlic and grated ginger root, since that was what I had on hand. I also added 1 1/2 Tb of orange zest to up the orange taste.  After cooking the chicken I stir fried broccoli, carrots and thin sliced kohlrabi in the sauce as well. I ended up adding about a tsp of cornstarch mixed in a little water to thicken the sauce more quickly and it turned out perfectly.  Served over brown rice and it was a big hit!

I battered and deep fried the chicken first because I wanted it crispy.  I mixed the remaining ingredients in a pan and heated, then tossed the chicken in just long enough to coat it.  Added a little Serrano pepper just to add a little heat.  Tasted great!

We will make it again with the addition of onions, peppers and mangetout or mushrooms, also marinade the chicken overnight to improve the flavour and  add a shake of chilli flakes for an added zing!
Also wondered about baking it rather than frying which may help to intensify flavour. Enjoyed it but could be so much better!

This was very good! I used minced garlic and ground ginger in the sauce in place of the paste. I also coated the chicken with corn starch and cooked it through, then added the sauce for 5 minutes or so to allow to thicken. Will definitely be making it again!

The recipe turned out great. I seasoned and grilled the chicken, diced it and added it to the sauce. I doubled the sauce by adding Triplesec and served over brown/wild rice combo.

I think it was too much juice. One reviewer said to use 1/2 cup of juice but it was so much fluid that it didn't boil down into a glaze at all, even after 20 minutes. The flavors were good though. I'd make it again, with maybe 1/4 cup juice or less.  Now (far too late) I have checked on the equivalent juice for one orange, and it is 4 tablespoons/ 2 oz. It did taste really good though. I made jasmine rice and sauteed bok choy to accompany it. Good dinner, and pretty quick too.

10 10 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/230660/orange-honey-and-soy-chicken/ ... Disclaimer:  I have never had orange chicken anywhere.  The person who was my inspiration to try it, KK, 18, gave it thumbs down with these comments:  Didn't taste like Orange Chicken or Asian.  
For me, it was like mall food - not bad, but nothing you'd want to replicate at home.    The orange sauce tasted good, but after cooking, lost most of its flavor.

My advice is to use small oranges for this recipe, I used larger oranges and the sauce took forever to thicken, even with high heat.

So delicious! I added a little bit of flour to make the sauce a bit thick faster so that i wouldn't need to boil it much and lose taste. Everyone loved it and recommended it again!

this was great, thank you for sharing.  like many reviewers i added red peppers, broccoli & way more garlic.  all ingredients were organic, including oyster sauce, chill paste, rice wine vinegar & sesame oil. i marinated the chicken in yogurt, fresh pressed garlic, ginger, honey, chill paste  & orange zest for a couple hours. wiped the chicken,sprinkled 5 spices over it, cut it put in a ziplock with cornstarch, five spices, shook until covered, & sautéed it in oyster sauce & sesame oil & orange zest, removed & kept warm. then to the pan added heaps of garlic, heaps of ginger, tamari, maple syrup, red pepper, red pepper flakes, broccoli, rice wine, green beans, once the veggies were slightly warmed added the  orange juice, maple syrup in a cornstarch slurry, the chicken. let it thicken.  was major yummy.  DH didn't notice it was low cal.

My husband really liked it but I wouldn't personally make it again. The sauce was lacking a distinct orange flavor and was too thick for covering the rice and vegetables.

Very good!  I too used 1/2 cup of orange juice, 1 T. minced garlic, 1 tsp of ginger and used part honey part brown sugar, as I didn't have enough honey.  Dusted chicken in cornstarch which helped thicken the sauce.  Sprinkled with red pepper flakes and added snow peas at the end.  Definitely will make again.

I give it 3 stars for how quick and easy the recipe process was. I recalculated it for 6 servings to feed us all and went according to the changes the app gave for that. the orange flavor was extremely overwhelming. To the point we could hardly eat it. You could taste the honey and soy, but the orange was way too much. it also didn't thicken or get "sticky" and I had to add cornstarch so it wasn't soupy.

Very tasty,  I used crushed garlic rather than garlic paste and a little bit of sesame oil. I dredged the chicken in corn starch before cooking and added cooked green peppers. Simple, easy recipe for a week night.

I doubled the ingredients for the sauce as we enjoy rice with dishes like this. I followed the recipe closely except I added about 1/3 cup of brown sugar as it tasted a little bitter to me as I simmered it.  Added frozen stir fry veggies, water chestnuts, and cashews for extra crunch.  It will be put in our rotation.

We didn't care for this. The orange flavor didn't come through at all despite juicing fresh oranges, nor did the honey seem very significant in the flavor. FWIW I didn't follow the recipe to the letter; the idea of cooking everything together seemed risky (was worried about overcooking the chicken) so I reduced the sauce in a separate pan for a while before sauteeing the chicken, then put everything together. I also added some broccoli. It was okay, but doesn't seem worth making again.

Lovely, tasty meal with hassle free preparation.
I used less than half soy sauce suggested in the recipe and thought it was perfect! I believe it would have come out too salty if I used the suggested amount.
Plantains on the side made the meal our new favourite :-)

Easy and tasted wonderful.   I also doubled the sauce, and dusted the chicken in corn starch.  I added onions, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots and snow peas, which I sauteed first and set aside until sauce was thick and then added to sauce and chicken.  I also added red pepper for a kick.  Husband loved will def make again.

Great flavour but I made a few simple changes. I cooked the chicken first so it was nicely browned. Then I added a clove of garlic, some red onion, red peppers and snow peas.  So the sauce would thicken I used only one orange and I added a 1/2 tsp of cornstarch - be sure to let it boil.  I served it with noodles and garnished it with green onions and sliced almonds.

My picky family loved this. One of my sons said even though he hates Orange chicken, it was good. I made broccoli, frozen peas and carrots over rice to go with it

Really good, quick and simple. Added Normandy mix in last five minutes (after cooking in microwave). Served over par cooked rice with bullion.

Would really score this a 4.5.  Didn't add the black pepper and added about a teaspoon of orange zest.  Next time would probably cut back on the honey a little, it was just a tad too sweet. Otherwise very easy to make and tastes great.

Here's a tip: double this recipe if you expect to serve yourself! I speak from experience. My family devoured it so fast I almost didn't get to eat dinner. Served with brown rice and steamed veggies. It was perfect-o.

yummy! My older kid liked it, but my little one picked at it, but she is soooo picky. If my little one had liked it, I would give it 5 stars. I will still make it again. I didn't have paste and used dried garlic and ginger seasoning, it was still super good with veggies and rice noodles.

Very easy recipe. Really enjoyed it. this is my first review so here it goes. Didn't have honey so I used some rhubarb jelly I had in the frig. Also used a little corn starch to help thicken. Substituted tenderized pork for chicken and served over rice. Loved it. Wife did not like at all.

Very nice basic recipe.  Do NOT take the cook time nor the temperature literally!  Your chicken could be over cooked  and the sauce could burn.  Just watch your time, and use a med low heat to prevent burning the sauce.

I added some caramelized onions and diced carrots for more variety. I'm going to add something green next time to switch it up. Yummy and easy.

Amazing recipe, my entire family devoured it. Quick and easy! I made a slight modification and did about 2oz of orange juice and orange zest in place of juicing an orange. Highly recommend this dish!

This was very tasty. I added a little salt to it which was a mistake so then added regular OJ to counter it. Also added a little corn starch to thicken it. Even without the additional OJ, it still needed a little corn starch.

This is fantastic!! Would be great done with either real or soy chicken. Cooking it until it starts to get a little crispy adds to the flavor. Thanks April Leigh.

Omgeeee!!! So good!!! Instead of using "pastes" I ground up the ginger and garlic in a food processor. And I wanted more texture to my chicken, so I shook it in a bowl of flour and cooked it through first. Then added the everything else. The end result was Awesome! Thank you! I'm obsessed!

This was good,  although it seemed to be missing something. I'm going to try it again, though. The kids ate veggies with this, so that's a win to me. I did use cornstarch to coat the chicken,  and added onion powder. This is worth making.  It should be easy to adjust ingredients to your liking. Maybe some 5 spice powder would round this out, if you have it. Thanks to April for the recipe!.

This was a big hit with my family, even my pickiest eaters!  I used leftover meat from a roast chicken and fresh garlic and it still turned out great.  Definitely needed a side of veggies to make it a complete meal.  This was quick and easy and will be a regular at our house!

My family did not care for this, although I loved the sauce.  Chicken was cooked way too long and was fairly dried out, despite all the sauce.

I did try this tonight, and it was delicious! I doubled the sauce and added a bit of crushed red pepper to give it a kick. Served with brown rice and added some green beans I had on hand. Probably will add other veggies next time. Will make again!

This wasn't bad but WAY too salty. I added some rough-chopped carrot, onion and red bell pepper, along with about 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes and canned pineapple chunks. I will try it again but be a bit more prepared with fresh veggies like mushrooms and pea pods and especially low-sodium soy sauce.

Okay but not as special as I was expecting from the reviews.
