This is an excellent recipe for Roca! I read a review that stated hers turned out chewy and it is most likely because it wasn't heated long enough to the crackle stage which is 300 degrees. Here is a tip if you are unsure or even if you may have a candy thermometer that is not accurate. Set a glass of ice cold water next to your work station. When you think it is done dip out a small bit (1/2 tsp is enough) and quickly drop it in the water. Wait almost a full minute then take out. Throw it into you sink. If it shatters or cracks, it is done. Also when making candy it is not recommended to ever double the batch but to make them individually, otherwise it may not turn out right. Also, you may run into trouble if you try making this or any candy for that matter on a humid or rainy day. Sugar is hygroscopic which just means that it pulls moisture from the air making your candy more on the chewy side or harder to set up. I let mine finish up in the fridge because it was in fact raining here and I didn't have a problem. I do think that this recipe was written very well in an way that helps avoid some major roca blunders. Thank you, I have already added to my recipe box!

I made this recipe this week and found it needed a few changes.  Instead of pouring the hot caramel on top of the almonds, I mixed the almonds into the caramel and mixed it in.  This way the almonds were well distributed into the caramel.  I also use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet and crushed some extra almonds on top of the melted chocolate.

This is the best recipe for almond roca I have ever found.  I do use a smaller pan because I can't get it to spread all over a 15x10 pan.  Also I cut the chocolate covered toffee with a pizza cutter before it totally hardens for more even pieces.

This is a much better way to fix this candy.  By putting the almonds under the toffee rather than sprinkling on top of the melted chocolate keeps all of the almonds in the candy.  Great idea!

I used to make candy with my grandma, so I was quite excited to find this recipe. It turned out great( just finished making two batches). I followed the recipe exactly, but I changed one step. Instead of toasting the almonds on a greased sheet, I did them on a foil lined sheet, then I spread the cooled almonds on a greased cookie sheet. they stick to the butter, and didnt skate around on me when I spread the caramel. overall a great recipe find!

This is an awesome recipe.  I followed the directions right to a tee and it was divine! The only thing I did differently was use all semi-sweet chocolate chips because I didn't have any vanilla on hand.  So good!

I made it the next night but used whole pecans and milk chocolate chips.  If was fabulous.  Definitely worth all 5 stars.  Be sure to use butter though, it makes it really taste great!  A keeper for sure!

I called this my "delicious disaster".  I substituted milk chocolate chips for semi sweet and they did not melt onto the candy.  Next time...and there will be a next time, I will melt the chocolate then pour it over the cooled candy.  Also, I have seen this recipe with chopped almonds on top of the chocolate layer.  Either way, a fabulous treat!

My friend always made almond roca but refused to share the recipe, so I had to suffer without. Now I can make it myself! This is amazing and so easy. I halved the butter like someone else suggested and it is just as good.

I've made this with salted butter and unsalted butter and I prefer to use salted with this recipe.  It is a wonderful recipe that does indeed taste just like the roca you buy in the pink tins.  After having made it a few times, I have learned that a thin layer of semisweet chocolate is the way to go- the vanilla chips make it a little cloyingly sweet in my opinion.  Terrific recipe- thanks for sharing it, Niki.

So very easy and yummy!!!  I followed directions to a T.  Tonight I am going to make again and add some crushed almonds to the frosting.   You could do this w/out the vanilla chips, but it looks pretty with them.  THANK YOU!!!

he taste of this is sooooo good.  The recipe calls for a 15x10 pan, I could not get mine to spread that thin at all - so I ended up with almonds that didn't have any thing on them.  So, I tried to scoop them up on get them into the mix before it was too late!  I didn't get a very pretty marbled effect either - I will try to make it pretty next time.  I also had to cook it for a good 20-25 minutes on medium heat (stirring quite often) to get to 300 degrees (also tested with the ice water test).  Next time I will start on a smaller pan and I think I will be happier.  I am going to have to give it away ASAP so I don't eat it all!

Wow! I decided to make half a batch because I had some sliced almonds left over from Halloween and wanted to give my mom a little something extra for Christmas. I don't like nuts, so didn't think I'd really like it (never had Roca before), but I tried it and it is sooo good. So good that I had to make another, full batch!! I think it's excellent with the sliced almonds (vs. slivered). Just know that the mixture will start to brown before it reaches the correct temp. In order to make the chocolate look swirly, I put the chocolate chips on first and spread them around and then put the white chips on top of that and let them sit for a little bit and then spread those around. I also used a pizza cutter to basically score the break lines on, let it harden in the fridge and then broke it into nice, square pieces. I'm giving this and the Irish Cream II from this site as gifts. People will love me!

This was a very easy recipe!  I didn't have a candy thermometer that worked, so I boiled it until it almost felt burnt.  It turned out perfect.  I took it to the office and they loved it!  Still talking about it days later!  Thanks so much for posting!

This tastes like the real deal.Very easy and very good. Instead of using 1/2 of almonds, I toasted a cup and then put  1/2 or more of that on the bottom of pan and then sprinkled the rest over the spread chocolate.

I like just about anything with almonds.  This turned out great although my marbling was not as the picture(I was a little slow getting the chips swirled cause I got a phone call).  The taste was so good though!  Doesn't have to look perfect to taste perfect!!

I didn't think this tasted that good at all.  I also think if you do make it, it needs to be kept refrigerated or else it gets really gooey and runny.

Just finished making this and waiting for it to set. Didn't have corn syrup, so used 1-1/2 tbsp agave syrup. 
Things I will do differently next time:
1. Have the oven waiting at 300F. When I poured onto my pan it didn't cover more than half, but when I popped it into the oven (already hot from baking dinner) it spread out to cover most of the sheet. 
2. Have the chocolate melted in bowls (sitting on top of the oven should melt them enough while preparing the candy). The chocolate chips didn't melt enough when just thrown on (the real reason that I threw the sheet in the oven) and was harder to make pretty. 
3. I'm considering getting a candy thermometer...

Can't wait to taste it! - Update : awesome!

I see that some people are saying that their recipe is coming out chewy. This may sound like a weird one, but if you make this on a humid day (rain/snow) or you live near a large body of water, it may come out that way. Try keeping the stove fan on while your solution is boiling, or if you have a dehumidifier, even better.

These are absolutely delicious. The only change I made was adding way more slivered almonds so the entire bottom was covered (the 1/2 C didn't allow the whole bottom to be covered in almonds). Super yummy.

This recipe was a hit.  Its not kidding when it says stir constantly.  I used the cold water test method as well as the thermometer.  But the end result was worth it.  It was the first thing to go on the platter of goodies.

Super easy and tasty. I just used semi-sweet chocolate chips and sprinkled extra chopped almond on top too.

Yum. Not quite the perfect toffee though. Whole almonds are better. The toffee was a bit off....would try again though.

This is the best. The only thing I did differently is chopped the almonds and then threw them in the pot at the last second before pouring out onto pan. This is delicious!! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this recipe twice today.  This first time, I followed the directions exactly, cooking it over medium heat and stirring occasionally after add the water and corn syrup.  Sadly, it scorched and didn't taste very good.  The next batch, I tried it over medium low heat, stirring slowly and continuously, stopping only to check the temperature.  Success!  Delicious!   So the 4 stars is for faulty directions, not for flavor.  The scorched stuff isn't as awful as it could be.  My neighbor said it wasn't stopping her from eating the first batch.  But the not burned batch was incredible, and very easy to make!  I'll definitely make this one again!

absolutely amazing!! I was surprised to see only one recipe for almond roca - but after making this I can say that this is the only recipe you'll need!  I followed the recipe exactly (added whole almonds instead and just chopped them chunky)except I omitted the vanilla chips. I took one reviewers advice about the hard-crack candy stage since I don't have a candy thermometer.  I snuck a taste while it was still warm and was disappointed that it was chewy. But after it cooled completely in the fridge it was perfect!!  I'll for sure be adding this to my christmas baking list!

Yum! I made a bunch for Christmas and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly except I used about 3/4 cup of each type of chip, simply because I love chocolate. I found that sometimes not all the chips would melt enough to spread so I laid a towel or some plastic wrap over the pan for a few minutes.

This is the best recipe I have found for Almond Roca.  I used Bittersweet 60% Chocolate chips on top because I like mine dark with a bite to it.  I also used a 13x9 pan, because I like the Roca to be thicker for more bite.  This recipe is crunchy like it should be.  Store in an air tight container in the fridge.

As a variation, instead of using semi-sweet choc try Andes Mints!  The mint isn't overpowering at all and adds a nice twist!  I also found that adding the almonds before pouring out the toffee let me mix them in more evenly.  A great and easy recipe!

This is an excellent recipe! I lined my baking sheet with foil to help get the candy out easier when it cooled. I used crumbled peanuts and pecans and it turned out wonderful. I will be making more this week! So easy!!

Delicious!  I didn't have any white chocolate chips, so I used all semi-sweet.  I sprinkled more chopped almonds on top as well.

Although delicious, I rated this a 4 star rating b/c I think the toffee portion of the roca needs vanilla or something else to give it a little more oomph. Next time I will add a 1/4 tsp vanilla and see what happens!

This candy is super easy to make but I think it could use another half cup of chocolate.  Mine did not marble- once the vanilla chips and chocolate chips started melting they just mixed together.  I think next time will just skip the vanilla chips...they really don't seem to add much to the taste.

This is so addictive!  I doubled the recipe to make enough for a larger cookie sheet.  I stirred the nuts into the caramel before pouring in the pan and used all semisweet chocolate chips instead, then sprinked sea salt on top.  FABULOUS!  Another variation that my husband and friends love is using white chocolate and crushed candy canes... so YUM!

Wonderful! I don't have a candy thermometer, but found it pretty easy to check for the hard crack stage by dripping some into a glass of cold water occasionally until it formed brittle threads. Took about fifteen minutes from when it started to boil.   I just used regular chocolate chips alone and poured it into a 8 x 10 pan (all I had -- turned out great), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Butter is definitely the way to go -- makes a lovely butter toffee taste to the candy. Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the BEST Almond Roca recipe ever! The only thing I've done differently is spreading the toasted almonds over the caramel and then drizzling it with melting chocolates. I've had six people ask me for the recipe this year!

This is the best !!!! It is really easy. One of my favorite candies is almond roca. This is exactly the taste and texture but better. It is so easy with the candy thermo. I bought canned almonds and chopped them because I wanted them chopped not sliced. Make sure you keep stirring and keep the thermo in the middle. I measured everything before hand and while the almonds were in the oven I started my candy.  Double the almonds though. I used dark and milk chocolate instead of white. I was making a lot of candy, cookies, and cakes for Christmas. I will share and always use this recipe. I live in the state of WA and I tried to wait for no rain it doesn't happen, it didn't matter with the peanut brittle. It does not make it chewy or otherwise it is just just where you have the thermo. I will share this to everyone!! LOVE IT!!

Never worked with sugar and did not have a candy thermometer but was able to do this easily. I did the water test that another poster talked about and it worked out great. I never had almond roca before but I plan on adding it to my permanent christmas list. I think I will add a little more chocolate next time so the layers are a little more even.

My coworkers loved it, but some said that it tasted more like peanut brittle rather than almond roca.  They think more almond is needed for this.

Fabulous and sooo easy!  I was a bit nervous at having to use a candy thermometer for the first time and I was sure I would burn the sugar mix, but it was actually very easy.  I'm going to make a ton of this as Christmas gifts and hopefully some will make it out my front door!

I almost wish I hadn't found this recipe...almost.  I've made more batches of it than I care to admit this holiday season...it just keeps disappearing before it gets into my gift baskets.  Needless to say, this has made it into my Christmas file where it will stay for many years to come.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Be careful not to burn the sugar like I did my first time. Still came out tasty even if a little stronger flavor than I wanted. It's come out very well each time I've made it.

I make this recipe every holiday season and give it away. Everyone waits for me to make it every year. It is so easy to make. I only use semi-sweet chips and I don't bake the almonds and it is perfect. Love this recipe!!!

This is so easy and tastes much better that the store bought almond roca, which I find always tastes stale. Also, when cooking the candy, I go by colour not tempurature, I find it more consistent.

Loved this recipe for Almond Roca! I made a few changes to the recipe as well. Instead of using slivered almonds, I used chopped up whole almonds. For the chocolate, I used a large milk chocolate bar and chopped that up as well. I mixed together the nuts and the chocolate and sprinkled half of it over the bottom of my pan, reserving the other half to sprinkle on top. Once the sugar mix was ready, I just poured it in my pan, making sure to cover all of the nut mix and then sprinkled the remaining mix on top. Delicious!!

I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect.  I would definately recommend a digital themometer so you can set it to go off when the candy is at 300 degrees.

Oh man, this is good.  A step above regular toffee, for sure.  Took me about 10 minutes to get to the hard ball stage.

Made this recipe this morning. Does not make enough to cover the 15x10 pan.  What's wrong?

I made this and something was not right! After it cooled, it was a weird peanut butter texture. I followed the recipe step by step and still ended up strange.

This was wonderful! The only thing I changed was the chocolate chips. I used 1/2 cup milk chocolate and 1/2 cup white chocolate. Great recipe!
