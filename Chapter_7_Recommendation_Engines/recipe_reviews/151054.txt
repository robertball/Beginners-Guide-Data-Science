Very simple, fast and delicious!  My picky fiance even helped himself to seconds.  I didn't have any Chipotle seasoning around, so I substituted chili powder instead.  I also added a little more lime than usual, and served it with a side of pico de gallo.

I had never made fish before this recipe, and it turned out DELISH! We invited the in-laws over and everyone was impressed.

I'm sorry no one in our family liked it. it was like a layer of stuff over bland fish. None of the flavors even went into the fish at all.

My husband doesn't normally like fish because it can be bland.  But he loved tilapia with this rub. Plus it was so quick to make!
