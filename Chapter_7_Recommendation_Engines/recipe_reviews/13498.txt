This dish tasted a lot like flan, and the pumpkin added a real nice touch. It took a little longer to bake and set than the recipe called for. I recommend taking off the pumpkin lid, my custard didn't set until I did.

Gorgeous! Finished cooking in microwave as pumpkin was cooked but custard not set! It was however gorgeous, the custard did not look grey as I grated my nutmeg myself instead of using ready grinded one which may be responsible for the grey custard some had. Pumpkin started to slpit as it had to cook so much more for custard to set so I presented it with a pretty sash tied round it an no one noticed the problem. I will in future start cooking the custard in a pan and put semi-set in pumpkin. Also I recommand cooking the lid separately, upside down on the baking sheet as it seems partly responsible for custard taking so long to set. On the whole I strongly recommand this recipe, it was a hit here in France and dinners ate the whole lot!

I had a lot of trouble with this recipe. Although I followed the directions to the letter, the custard never solidified at all. As a matter of fact, I even cooked the pumpkin as long as possible (without it disentegrating) and still the custard did not form! The pumpkin seemed to make an excellent insulator against the heat of the oven.
I had to end up pouring the custard mixture into a saucepan, and cooking it that way. Then I returned it to the pumpkin. 
It did make a lovely centerpiece on the dinner table, and I enjoyed it very much. However, some friends were turned off when I scooped some of the pumpkin onto their plate and they would only eat the actual pumpkin. All the kids loved it though! 
Overall: Yummy but too much work. I will try thinning the pumpkin more next time, in hopes of improving the cooking time. Yes, I will try it again! If still no luck, I will stick to pumpkin pie.

It LOOKED impressive, but that's all you can say about this recipe.  It took an hour longer to bake than recipe calls for and custard was an unappetizing gray.  Find a better use for your pumpkin!

Be careful to lift the top off from the flesh, not the stem; it's easy to break it off and it's so pretty served with that stem on!  Friends fought to take home the leftovers.  I baked it an extra 20  minutes; leave yourself ample time!  Very egg-y but we loved it as dessert!!

This was very good.  I actually give it 4-4.5 stars for taste, but the presentation is so nice that I had to give it 5 stars.  The custard looked a just little greyish to me, and it took longer to cook than expected. I wonder if anyone has used 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream?  I'll make it again, it's too pretty not to.

We preferred it served over a pumpkin bread.  If you really like custard then you would like this.

If you leave the lid off the custard will set. Placing the lid on keeps the custard from evaporating as it should. My mom has a recipe similar to this and we love it. I didnt make this recipe exactly but will be using it as a base to start from as I lost my original recipe.

The flavor is great.  The custard did not set properly.  I'll try with a flatter pumpkin for Thanksgiving.

I've tried this several times--the custard just won't set.  The color is unappetizing.  Never again!  Pecan pie is much less trouble.
