My school cafeteria made something like this a few weeks back and I had been craving it again since. This came out so good, my husband approved it and asked I keep the recipe to make again in the future! The lime and seasonings are really what puts the flavor over the edge. My only pitfall making it the first time were the sweet potatoes needed more time in the oven to cook through, and I couldn’t find shelled pumpkin seeds at my regular grocery store so I’ll keep an eye out for those next time I’m at one of the fancier stores.

Very tasty. I made it as a side dish, Sweet Potatoes and black beans with most of the seasoning. I could see that it would make interesting tacos.

Made these last night and my partner who does not like Mexican food let alone tacos licked his plate.  I tole him he had not met the right taco until he had these! I also added salsa and jalapeños to ours. Deliciousness!
