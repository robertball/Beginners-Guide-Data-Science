I increased the bacon to two pieces and I used butter instead of vegetable oil. My oldest son and I split this (my youngest took one look at it and refused to try it). His comment was "Mom--it's a scrambled egg with gravy!" Next time, I want to try this on an english muffin with the hollandaise sauce spooned over the top. I bet that would really be good.

Wow - this definitely is meant for two people and since I've never had a "Colorado Omelet" I really have nothing to compare this to but just as the submitter states it's a "delicious change of pace from traditional omelets".  Since my husband is a huge fan of bacon I did add a little more and I didn't cook this in oil but with just a little butter as I always do.  I also de-seeded my tomato to avoid things getting watery.  The addition of deli turkey was different and next time I might sub ham. I left the hollandaise sauce on the side and I'm kinda glad I did... I served this with a side of toast and OJ - very filling!
