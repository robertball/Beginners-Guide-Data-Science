I hate to be the first rater because I wasn't able it follow the recipe as written. I just didn't have all the ingredients. But this recipe served as a fabulous base for a wonderful sweet/tart bread pudding.  The lemon zest added great flavor to the pudding- don't leave it out.  Here are the changes that I made: 3 1/2 cup milk, 1 cup sour cream instead of whipping cream, brown sugar instead of white, vanilla extract instead of bean,  sliced almonds instead of raisins, 2 cups cranberries- and could have had more really, leftover sliced potato and whole wheat breads instead of baguettes. I baked the whole shebang in a 13 x 9 inch glass pan- I am not sure if it all would gave fit in a pie plate.

I made this recipe with some leftover banana bread.  I cubed it and ended up with about 4-5 cups.  I used vanilla extract in place of the bean, dates in place of raisins, brown sugar vs the white, and I used about half more cinnamon and 2 cups total cranberries. Put it all in a 9x13 pan. I also lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees and cooked it about 5-10 minutes longer.  The 350 just seemed a bit too extreme for a custardy type dish and didn't want to fry the cranberries since they float to the top.  Turned out great!  The cranberries add a festiveness in color, plus were a nice tart to offset the sweet bread.

Wonderful recipe! Made to take to a day after Thanksgiving dinner. Only changes I made were used vanilla extract(did not have a vanilla bean) and only used cranberries(no raisins on hand). Also made a warm, vanilla/lemon sauce to go over it (an old family recipe that goes with a blueberry cake). Delicious! Will definitely make again for fall/holiday get togethers!

Really nice flavors!  I replaced the lemon zest with orange zest (because I like cranberry & orange together).  I didn't have any vanilla bean so I substituted  real vanilla (liquid).  I wish I had added a few chopped pecans.  I will definitely make this again!

I was looking for a bread pudding recipe that called for cranberries. I made this with a couple of substitutions. It is in the oven right now and I will serve this as dessert for Sunday dinner. I have a feeling it is going to be very good.
  I will let all of you know how it turns out.

Great pudding and very colorful.  A warm sauce would make it even better.  Will definitely make it again.  I followed recipe exactly.

I substituted orange zest for the lemon, then included the juice of that orange in the amount of dairy portion, going with all Half and Half for the milk/cream amounts.  I'm going to  stick with that.
12" deep dish pan?  Don't have that, so I used a 9x9 and loaf pans.
Made creme anglaise for topping.
Took it to a small potluck - it was a hit!  Nice to have the small pan portion the next day.

Delicious! I made it two days in a row because my family loved it! The second time I used 6 teaspoons imitation vanilla extract and a half cup of raisins and a half cup of craisins -awesome - my house was super aromatic and the  aroma of vanilla enhanced it even more.

I have a question--in the photo it looks like there are walnuts.  Is that ingredient missing, or are they optional?  (Or have I mistaken something else for a walnut?)

Have made this recipe a couple of times now but used vanilla extract (real stuff not imitation) instead of vanilla bean - wonderful dessert for a hubby that loves bread pudding! Have used half and half instead of heavy cream and substituted rice milk once as well to cut done on cals. Last time used only a half cup of sugar but 1/4  white sugar 1/4 brown and it just added a bit of a different flavor. This is my go to recipe for bread pudding now.
