The good news is: our fire extinguisher works. I put the mushrooms on the top rack by the broiler, set the timer for four minutes and at three heard a *poof* from the oven. I opened the door to flames shooting out and licking the cabinets above. After our fire extinguisher put out the flames and I'd cleaned up, I finished up the sandwich, and thought it was pretty good. Then my daughter pointed out that the mushrooms I'd just eaten had been sprayed with a fire extinguisher. The poison control center assured me that the f.e. has mostly baking soda inside and that I shouldn't feel any ill effects.  But the man laughed at me, so I have to add the caveat to the recipe: leave off the extra baking soda by not letting your 'shrooms catch fire in the first place. Other than the fire marshall warning, these were pretty yummy sammies.

I love portobello mushroom sandwiches and this homemade one rivals the best I have had in my favorite diner. I tweeked the recipe a bit to try and duplicate others I've eaten. I added grilled sweet onions, grilled peeled red peppers, and a slice of provolone. Plus I brushed the bread (NOT hamburger buns) with olive oil and grilled both sides. 
Very, very good!

These are the best burgers!  I have stopped eating hamburgers because I love this recipe so much. My only suggestions is chopping the capers instead of leaving them whole, adding grilled red onions and Provolone cheese.

Very yummy.  I reduced the vinegar by one tablespoon and added red cooking wine. We cook this on the grill, about 1 1/2 to 2 min each side. Delicious even without the caper mayo! My 10 year old loved it, and he doesn't like mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe.

Stop eating hamburgers! Why would you, anyway, with delicious portabello mushrooms that are so much quicker and healthier? This recipe is the best I've tried.

Best summed up by my husband, "This is a mushroom?!?"  These were delicious and we will have these again and again, I'm sure.  Used fresh thyme and poured almost the entire marinade into the caps so all the flavor could be absorbed.  Cooked them on the grill and added provolone and sauteed red onions.  They were fantastic!  And the clincher:  it all came together, including a salad, in less than 30 minutes.

Wow--these were terrific!  I will definitely be making a lot of these sandwiches in the future!  A note to those of you who, like me, are a bit short on time:  Hellmann's makes an herbed mayonnaise that I used in place of the homemade mayo listed in the recipe.  It tasted great and saved a few minutes.

GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO BEEF. NEXT TIME I WILL USE SOME TYPE OF CHEESE AND ONIONS AND MAYBE LAY OFF THE VINEGAR A BIT.

very good.  i made it for my vegan sister.  i just added capers (and grilled red onions) on top and put a layer of chopped parsley in too.  to solve the soggy-ness, i grilled the mushroom in a george forman grill, reserving the juice for soup.  right before putting the mushroom on the bun (which i had sprayed with pam and lightly grilled) i let it drip a little and it resulted in a perfectly juicy burger, but dry bun.  and i used rosemary instead of thyme.

I was a little suspicious and hesitant of a "burgerless" burger, but given my intense love of mushrooms I decided to at least try this recipe out.  Wow was I glad I did!  I loved it so much I gorged myself on 2 burgers and, although stuffed beyond belief, found myself plotting when I could have this tasty treat again!  Two thumbs up!!

Yum.  Nothing wrong with this recipe!  One hint:  My broiler has 2 settings, High & Low.... if yours does too then do these on Low.... I did the first side on Low with no problems ... I flipped and changed it to High and viola...BIG FIRE.  I shut it off and restarted with Low ... no problem.  Very delicious and easy to make.

My first time on this site. I was looking to eat less meat, and eat a little healthier. this was the first recipe that i came across, and it sounded good. I went out and bought all the ingredients, started cooking and hoped for the best. all i can say is WOW! This was sooooooo good! My brother loved it as well, and hes a huge food critic(in our family). Definitely need to make sure u have the right bun, and will make these again today, but will start playing with different ingredients. I LOVE this Sandwich! I am ok with eating these instead of beef burgers any day!

Broiling turned out to be a quick and easy way to prepare the portobellos.  Wasn't a huge fan of the caper mayo which I thought I would have loved.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe, thank you!  I agree the focaccia bread (with garlic) is a MUST, plus the provalone cheese, and sliced red onions.  I cooked everything on a large griddle so that made it easier, I added the mushrooms to the marinade and mixed it up so that it was very well coated.  I also added fresh minced rosemary from my garden to the marinade.  I did coat the red onions in the same marinade and broiled them with a dab of butter...and I also coated the bread with the marinade before toasting on the griddle.  I didn't have any peppers on hand in the 3x in the last 3 weeks that I've made this, but sounds like another great addition to this already delicious meal.  Last night I just placed everything on shreaded romaine lettuce because I try not to eat bread too often.  Wow, what an infusion of flavors!  Thanks again for such a great recipe and everyone's great comments!

This recipe was fantastic!  My only substitution was basil for the thyme and I melted fresh mozzarella on top.  It was easy and my husband loved the caper mayo, what an awesome topper!  I put the portobellos on Portugiese rolls, just to make it a little more exciting.  Definately a weekly staple! Thanks Nicolle!

The Balsamic vinegar is a little strong.
I found putting the marinade in a large bowl and then putting the mushrooms in the bowl to cover them quickly worked well

Awesome!!  Personally, I added some grilled onion...and perhaps a bit more capers. Rinsed, salt cured capers are way better than brined!  Sometimes, when I'm feeling it, I grill up some onion....brilliant!

This is an awesome recipe. Great alternative to burgers. I added sliced tomato and red onion. I also have made them grilled and broiled them. They turn out great either way. I agree with other reviewers to make sure to purchase fresh hamburger buns (makes all the difference in the overall taste of the sandwich).

Try replacing the mayo with goat cheese - unbelievable!  You can also add a sliced vidalia and a whole red pepper to broil with the portabello - make sure to peel your red pepper after.  I use potato rolls.  Very addictive.

I add 1/4 t of lemon juice to the mayo mixture but otherwise follow the recipe exactly, and they are absolutely incredible.  Everybody who I've fed them to devours them. I prefer these over meat any day. I make them all of the time, sometimes on the grill, sometmes
 in the toaster oven. In my opinion, they go well with a good merlot.

Great idea to run with. I made a few changes... I added balsmic soaked and broiled onion slices and used a basil mayonaisse. Served with spinach leaves on a toasted bun. Sooo delicious.

Yummy! Followed the recipe except I didn't have any capers on hand and I'm not a huge fan of them anyway. Served on yummy whole wheat sandwich buns that I toasted. Thanks :)

loved them...make sure the buns are really toasted because they will get soggy.  I melted cheese on top of the mushroom seemed to help keep the juices from leaking on the bun..DELICOUS

Wow!!! This was really, really delicious...and I am NOT a mushroom lover!  I let my mushrooms sit in the marinade for a couple of hours and then grilled them to avoid the smoke-in-the-house problem others had.  I only had cheapy little hamburger buns in the house, so I was a little worried about the soggy problem others had, but I place my mushrooms with the gill side up on my buns and didn't have any soggy issue at all!  Topped with provolone cheese, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and the caper mayo and I was in heaven.  Can't wait to make this for my husband, who really does not like mushrooms at all...I know he will shocked to taste how yummy these are!

Very good. I added some feta cheese on top as well. The toasted bun with the mayo (I used low fat and still tasted great) was a nice touch but did get a little soggy halfway through.

The flavor was great. I grilled them on a HOT grill pan instead as to avoid the possibility of burning them. They turned out great. I don't like capers so I didn't use them. I use some slices of fontina cheese and rubbed some garlic on my toasted kaiser rolls and it was yummers!

These are significantly better if marinated for at least 1 hour. I felt the marinade should be a little more spicy; added 1T soy sauce and decreased oil to 3T. Delicious!

Did it up with store brand italian dressing mix that I always make with balsamic garlic vinegar, soaked the gills & underside face up for 20 minutes before turning over - it was already absorbed, then brushed onto the top of caps.  Grilled gill side down for 3 minutes then flipped and after 3 minutes added feta (I had the basil & red pepper variety on hand) & thin strips of regular havarti cheese for the gills.  YUM!  I couldn't believe how easy it was for such a tasty result. I used Hellman's regular mayo with the capers.  Adds a subtle flavor & I would not skip it when I make these in the future.  Also grilled red peppers which were marinated in the same dressing for 15 min.  My husband had them on the burger and I had them on the side.  I will be making this regularly - it's so easy, quick, & minimal cleanup.

Very good.  Even my husband who has to have meat for ever meal raved about these.  I only had bread so I lightly toasted it, spread light mayo on each side, sprinkled some bleu cheese on the bottom, put the mushroom on top and topped mine with mozzeralla and his with hot pepper cheese and then tomatoes and fresh spinach.  Excellent!

These are the BEST! My husband was hesitant to try these. Afraid of a beefless burger. But after marinating them for a few hours, he cooked them up on the grill and we both loved them! Now we eat them regularly! Thanks so much!

Absolutely delicious! I've already made this multiple times. I like to melt cheese on the mushrooms during the last couple minutes of broiling. I also double the amount of capers, and add lots of fresh basil into the mayonnaise too. I find that the juiciness is not too much of a problem if you use a substantial bun.

Oh wow!!! This was SO GOOD!  I followed the recipe exactly, but did add a little basil, and melted provolone cheese over the grilled mushrooms.  (Ideas taken from another portobello burger recipe on this site).  This was even better than a beef hamburger.  We will definitely make it again and again and again and....

These are delicious.  Due to certain circumstances we weren't able to cook these right away.  So, for over an hour, I kept brushing the dressing on the mushrooms.  By the time we put them on the grill they were saturated with flavor!  I recommend marinating these for a good hour.  And grilling them was a great idea too.  I used the Hawaiian bread sandwich buns sprayed with pam and grilled them as well.  Put fresh parsley in the caper mayo.  I was glad I had an extra for lunch the next day!  Thanks for the recipe Nicholle!!

My 3 y/o loves everything but she spit this out and made a face!  My husband loves mushrooms but was turned off by the vinegar.  I was a bit turned off by the texture.  They are easy but I think I'll have to tweak this before I make it for my family again.

These were very yummy, they were inexpensive to make which is always a plus. They took up very little time and are really good for you too. It's nice to have variations for us non-meat eaters, or even those who just want a change of pace! Thanks for allowing us all to take advantage of your recipe!

Didn't have capers (don't like capers much anyway) and added avocado to the burgers and they were delicious! Use vegan mayo for a totally animal product-free burger!

Really tasty. I did not broil at the top of the oven as was suggested, due to other reviewers' references to fire, so it took a little longer. I also added fresh basil to the herb mix. Yum!

I made this for the first time and my husband and roommate loved it. I'm not a great cook but this is rather easy.  I added grilled onions and Mozzarella cheese (that's what I had in the fridge) and it turned out great.   I like the balsamic vinegar so I followed the recipe and used 2 tablespoons.   The only thing is this is not very filling so we each had 2 Portobellow Sandwiches.  This is definitely something I will make again and for my mother in law since she is vegetarian. Yum!

HUGE hit with my husband ... and we just finished grilling them for the neighbors who "just couldn't tell you how good it is" between bites.  No cravings for real steak after this!

YUMMY, this deserves over 5 stars in my opinion!  It is a simple recipe, but sooo delicious!  I followed the recipe except I ommitted the capers out of personal preference and the lettuce because I didn't have any.  I topped the caps with swiss cheese and roasted red peppers (jarred) in addition to the tomato and mayo, magnificent!  I served them with baked sweet potato fries for a healthy version of a burger and fry meal.  The other reviewers are right in that it takes a hearty bun to hold this juicy "burger"!  I will be making these again and again!

I was expecting a 3-4 star recipe review based upon previous reviews BUT, if you take the mushroom and pour the pepper, thyme, balamic vinegar, oil, etc. on the gills and marinate overnight, you will definitely have a 5 star recipe that doesn't need a bun or mayo to make it better.

FANTASTIC!  I only had sliced mushrooms on hand so I put them in a shallow pan with all of the listed ingredients and broiled for a few minutes.  (You could also saute the mushrooms and sauce in a skillet)  I didn't want to use a bun so I took 2 slices of wheat bread and brushed both sides with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic powder. I put the slices on my griddle until brown on both sides.  Spread the grilled bread with mayo, add the mushrooms, and a slice of provolone, and enjoy.  It remined me of a panini and the juices did not soak through the bread.  I can't wait to make it again!

These were fantastic!  A great use for some olive oil infused with thyme and rosemary that I brought back from Greece.  The capers and mayo were a nice little trick- gotta remember that one for other sandwiches and toppings.  I had this for dinner tonight and I'm already planning on having it again tomorrow!  Thanks for a great recipe!

SUPERB! My boyfriend is very picky with food, especially with westerns, since we are Indonesians, and he digs super savory and herby foods, while I can tolerate nearly all kinds of International flavor. I followed the recipe as it is. The only tweaking I did was that I brushed the buns with the dressing before toasting them. I was very surprised and contented that this actually met his taste! He also hates vast kinds of veggies and didn't complained at all for those I stuffed in this sandwich, even complimented me on this. If only he knew! Oh, not to forget every "Mmmmm. This is super delish!" on every bite he took!
I'll try on the cheese and grilled onion suggestion next time I have this, and it'll be super soon.

These were great, especially with the caper mayonnaise which really made this recipe.  I think I'll look for a better balsamic vinegar since what I have on hand is a cheap version and I found it didn't lend itself very well to this recipe.  I also want to experiment with other options - maybe a little soy sauce instead.  Thank you for posting!

This was really good and easy. I followed the marinade recipe exactly, except I used fresh thyme. I set the burgers up a bit differently, though: I didn't have capers, so I used a balsamic mustard that has a similar tangy flavor; I used sprouted-grain buns; and I used alfalfa sprouts instead of lettuce. Definitely a keeper!

Made it exactly as the recipe said.  Delicious, though I do agree with other readers when they say it needs to be served on something heartier than a hamburger bun or the bun will get soggy.  Thanks  for the great recipe!

Man this is an awesome recipe!!!!  You just have to try it!  ...and it didn't even take that long to prepare!  The only thing I could suggest as a variation is that you could consider adding Swiss Cheese (or your preference) and maybe even avacado (or whatever your fav condiment might be).  Cudos to the Chef... Well done!

Awesome!  Thank you Nicholle!   I usually cook these on a grill pan because I just love those grill marks!  You can play around with the marinade and the toppings and make this all your own.  I happen to love guacamole or aoli on mine.  Sometimes I add roasted peppers, cheese, red onions and fresh spinach to my "burger".  They are always good no matter how I tweak the recipe.   Try these and you will love them.  They are also good on artisan bread as a healthy sandwich.

We loved these!  I had to substitute cider vinegar because I didn't have balsamic and I left out the capers.  We also grilled the caps.  These were sooo good and so filling!

Excellent!  That's all I can say.  If you're a big fan of these meaty mushrooms, this is a great way to eat them.  I added swiss cheese and let it melt under a broiler.

We only used the marinade in the recipe since we wanted to eat them as was.  It was delicious!  It was a little tangy and imparted a nice flavor without being overwhelming.  We didn't, and wouldn't, change a thing.

I have had many different types of portobello sandwiches, this was one of my favorite!  The spices made it very tasty! Broiling was a breeze and allowed the flavor to soak in the portobellos quickly.  Munster cheese made it even better!

This was absolutely wonderful! Being that I was busy with other things in the kitchen at the time, I marinated the mushrooms in the sauce and they came out very juicy.

This was a delicious recipe!  I did not add lettuce and tomato to the top of the portobello and I modified the mayonnaise mixture.  I made a bruschetta mixture and added some chopped onion.  I drained the olive oil and balsamic vinegar that I used in the bruschetta mixture and added this mixture to the mayo and capers.  I used very little mayonnaise.  I found this concoction really brought this recipe to the next level.  I also used Kaiser rolls instead of hamburger rolls.  This recipe far exceeded my expectations!  I will definitely make this again!

These were delicious.  My only complaint is that they are slippery and tricky to keep in the bun.  I did add grilled red peppers and onions, as well as provolone.  Definitely will make again.

My burger-loving family was skeptical about this and it took Mom being away for the night for them to finally give in and give it a try.  Needless to say, they absolutely loved them and constantly ask me to make them again!!  O ya, I substituted green olives for the capers...yummy!

I have never had much luck fixing these mushrooms.  This is the best recipe ever!  I even saved a couple for another night to put on top of burgers.  The only thing I did different was put swiss cheese on the bottom after I cooked the tops.  I just flipped them over and put them back under the broiler to melt and brown the cheese.  They were wonderful.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

For someone on a diet who hasn't had a "real" burger in a looong time, this was HEAVEN!! It is definitely on my top 10 recipes of all time list. Quick, easy, cheap and healthy!! (using lite mayo and less of it helps a bit more) The only change I made was adding a slice of provolone cheese on top and added red wine instead of the vinegar since I didn't have any. Delicious!! Thanks so much!

This is the simplest, quickest, most delicious meal ever!  Did I forget to mention healthy too?  Strangely it exceeded my expectations.  My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I did make more sauce for the mushrooms and did not use thyme but that is about all I changed.

5 stars!  I could see how these would catch on fire in the broiler, so I moved the pan down a notch and it cooked up in the same amount of time.  I carmalized some onions for the top, but be ready to spend almost an hour on those.  I put provolone cheese on the mushroom and broiled it for 30 seconds.  I topped it with provolone, tomatoes, lettuce and onions.  I homemade Tasty Buns from allrecipes.com.   I topped it with mayo mixed with fresh parsley...since I couldn't find capers.  AWESOME.

This was the only recipe to ever cause a fight between my fiance and I. After the mushrooms caught fire (after only a couple of mins) he read the recipe because he didn't believe me that the recipe really did say to put the shrooms close to the heat after covering them in oil. After all of that, they didn't even taste good. We ended up taking the mushrooms off the sandwiches and just eating the tomato and lettuce. I feel bad for giving a recipe a 1 star, but I really can't give this one anymore than that.

Absolutely wonderful! Made this for my carnivore boyfriend who didn't miss the meat at all as well as for my veggie family and got rave reviews from both parties. The only changes I made were using fresh instead of dried thyme, adding provolone cheese to the portobellos once they were removed from the oven and not using any lettuce. For the buns I used a whole wheat dinner roll I found at Super Target. Once I buttered and toasted them they were the perfect pairing with the broiled mushrooms. Next time I think I'll rinse the capers a little before chopping and incorporating them into the mayo as this will help cut back on the sodium content. I might also marinate the mushrooms overnight rather then for just a couple of hours like I did this time.

I love this recipe, it's so quick and so good.  It really is a lot better with stiffer type of bun or it gets soggy and messy quickly.

I really enjoyed these. My husband did not. They were a bit too moist, making the bun soggy, but if I play with the cooking time a bit, or perhaps fry them prior to putting them in the oven, that may provide a solution.

I followed the recipe pretty carefully, and served these on homemade potato/wheat buns, and they turned out really good! Even with the caper mayo (can't really taste the capers) this is a pretty basic, tasty, fast way to eat Portobellos. They end up with a really meaty flavor and juicy texture. I'll be making these again for sure.

Excellent! I cooked these as I had a vegetarian friend over for dinner. Everyone loved these. I usually like portabellas cut up as they have a strong flavor, but cooking them this way made them have a milder flavor. Even for a house full of meat lovers, I will definitely make again.

Wow does oil smoke!  Make sure to have the windows open for this recipe.  Really good, first time doing a portabello "burger" and it was "meaty".  May increase the capers next time, wasn't a big flavour hit I was hoping for. Topped with Provolone too (can't go wrong with cheese).  A definite make again recipe.

Really amazing---I've been wanting to eat portabello mushrooms but didn't know how to cook them.  I spread goat cheese on a kaiser roll like the previous post---really good!  Was out of thyme and used basil instead---still tasted like a restaurant.

I made a modified recipe for my friends birthday last night and everyone loved them.  Instead of the capers and mayo (which probably was delicious), I made a Mayo, garlic and lime juice spread.  It's like an aioli without the horseradish.  I layered one side of the buns with goat cheese, the other with the spread.  Put the portobello on top of the goat cheese, some baked sliced beets on top, baby leaf spinach and put the other bun on top.  yum!

I grilled the mushrooms and they turned out great. As others have commented, they were very juicy... which is good, except the bottom of the bun turned quite soggy. Next time, I will try to press or drain out some of the excess moisture.

I have made these multiple times, and love them everytime!  I kept the recipipe the same except for the bread (I like whole grain rolls) and I double the mayo sauce.  These are fabulous!  I agree with another reviewer on one thing.  Be careful with your stove, mine too caught on fire.  I laughed when I read their review warning about this, and it happened to me.  Please stay in the area when you make these just in case!

these were pretty darn good...I ran into the "wet" problem too, but the taste was great.  I think that can be remedied by grilling instead of broiling.  I'll do that next time.  I broiled marinated onion rings too and put them on top with the tomato and lettuce, plus the caper mayo and a hearty whole wheat bun...good stuff!!!

Very good! I marinated them in the frig for about an hour. I added onions cut into rings and marinated them as well. I put the onions in the oven sooner because they take longer. I also added a little bit of rosemary. My only complaint is they are quite greasy. Excellent flavor. I will make again with less oil. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and really easy!!  I just prepared the portabellos in my toaster's broiler.  I used 2/3 the amount of oil suggested (2 tbsp instead of 3 tbsp for 2 caps) and the mushrooms came out just fine.  I liked the mayo + capers combo.

Haven't tried this yet but it sounds great. I think the following remoulade sauce would be awesome with it! I'm gonna try mine with the remoulade instead of the mayo/capers combo. I've had this remoulade on Salmon croquettes before and it's great!!!!!!!

Remoulade Dressing:
1/3 cup plain yogurt
1 tsp capers
1 1/2 tbsp mayo
2 tsp parsley
2 tsp green onions
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1/4 tarragon
1/8 pepper
Dash hot sauce

Yummy!These were great.I could only find three medium size mushrooms ,but it woked ,just shortened broiling time.I poured some of sause on the underside of the cap and let it sit for about 5 min. then broiled as directed. I didn,t make the caper mayo ,because I don,t care for then that much. But I had left over marinate and brushed on bun and toasted. then add small amount of mayo to bread with tomato and cheese.W0W could have eaten all of then by myself

Delicious.  I only had 2 portobellos but, I mixed up the full recipe of marinate.  Then I poured all but a little of the marinate in the gill side of the mushrooms and let them marinate about 5-6 hrs (I got busy and forgot about them).  I put them in my cast iron grill pan gill side down and poured the rest of the marinate over the tops.  Broiled for a few minutes and then turned them gill side up to finish cooking.  I did not have any bread---not one single slice in the house and did not feel like running to the store so served over a bag of heat & eat Adolphus Basmati rice.  Served with a side salad.  So good!!  Wish I had saved just a tad of the marinate to pour on the rice.  Loved the balsamic flavor of the mushrooms. Can't wait to make again, loved the way it turned out---may try in sandwich form next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These turned out so well! The caps I had were humongous so I only need two and cut them in quarters to fit on the buns better. The caper may was delicious and the sandwich as a whole tasted amazing. I will definitely be re-making this and often.

Oh, that was good. And easy. And fast. 

Portobello mushrooms are surprisingly expensive, so I used Porteenies instead and stacked two to three caps per sandwich. I tried them with a mix of Dijon and roasted-garlic mayo, and this was delicious. 

It may have been my oven, it may have been my roasting pan, but the roasting after having flipped them produced a LOT of smoke in my house. Anyone have any explanation and way to prevent this?

This is definitely in the make-again recipe box.

These were absolutely wonderful!  I had to use fresh basil instead of thyme.  Didn't have capers so I used a basil/mayo combination.  I grilled them outside- can't wait to have one again!!

This was great....although I made a couple changes. I only had 3 caps, so I took an onion and cut it in 1/2 and broiled it as well with the extra sauce I had. I toasted bread with mozzerella cheese and garlic salt on it. I used one piece of the cheese toast bread on one side and one piece of plain toasted bread for the other side and spread miracle whip on it after toasting. I didn't have any capers and it was still great. I used the broiled onions to spread over the sandwich instead of lettuce and tomato. I thought the combination of grilled onions and melted cheese on toasted bread, made this perfect. Great recipe, thanks so much for posting.

Very tasty.  I would let the mushrooms sit out a few minutes after cooking before putting them on the buns.  It was a bit messy, but VERY tasty.

These were good but I did change them so I don't know what the actual recipe tastes like exactly. I didn't have capers so I used garlic mayonnaise instead. I added a little chili pepper to the marinade and marinaded for two hours. I loved them, they were sooo yummy and my husband liked them too and he does not like mushrooms. I will definitely make these again, and would love to try them with the caper mayo.

I do not like Mushrooms, so I did not like this very much, but my husband loves Potobello, and he likes this sandwich. He didn't love it because it needed little more spice, was a little bland. Capers defenitely add that much needed "Oomph"!! I saturated portobello with marinate for almost an hour, which was good. They became crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Took the hint from other reviewers and put the shelf one down in oven.

The write-up for this recipe was right - - it is juicy!  My grocery store did not have focaccia bread when I got there after work so I used onion flatbread.  The focaccia probably would have soaked up some of the juices.  But don't get me wrong, this was very, very good.  Very satisfying sandwich!

I had been wanting to make something with portobellos for a while, but did not know what to season them with. . . . I didn't want them to taste like nothing but vinegar. I did start a small fire in the oven, though. I think that next time I will move the rack down a little bit. Despite the fact that the outsides were black the inside was still juicy. They were very good. . . . would probably be even better without the fire.

We have been making these sandwiches for a long time and we love them.  They are easy to make and delicious.  We like to pair them up with strawberry and spinach salad.  That combo is one of our favorite summer dinners.

I have to admit, this was a bit better than I anticipated. My husband (who is a vegetarian) didnt care for it, I sliced the cap in half to thin is out and he felt it was too much mushroom. I myself am not a mushroom fan, but felt this is excellent for those who were. I cant give this a bad rating if its because Im not a fan of mushrooms!

These were pretty good. I think I should have added a tad bit more salt and pepper and I think I needed a bigger dish to broil the mushrooms in. Overall, though, well done. I'd make it again.

These were fantastic.  I made them exactly as is and they were so good, and fast to make as well.  I'm not a fan of mayonaisse in general, but I made the caper mayonaisse and I wouldn't skip it.  It adds a real nice subtle flavor.  I will definitely be making these again.

Heavenly.  I added some fresh basil and champagne vinegar to the mayo mixture.  I LOVE THIS.  I read some other viewers who had a problem with dripping, let the mushrooms cool a little then put a slice of tomato on each side of the bun this will help it not be soggy and the extra mayo makes the sandwich even better.  I also like to shred my lettuce instead of leaving whole.  I wouldn't mind having this over a regular cheeseburger.

So Good!  I added rosemary and italian seasonings to the marinade.  I also used a lowfat dill dip rather than mayo and it was excellent.

This was a great recipe.  My husband was having hamburgers so I just put these out on the grill with his.  Turned out perfect.  They are a little drippy and make the bun soggy but I'm not so sure how to correct that without drying them out since mushrooms are primarily made of water.  I will definitely have again.

Great basic recipe! I used focaccia bread, substituted italian seasoning for the thyme, left out the capers and since we don't like mayo or nayo just left it out. Thanks for this submission that makes a terrific substitute for burgers and keeps us from having to eat meat!

This recipe was great, I really enjoyed it.  I even mixed up the maranade so it'll be easy to make again.  I used potato buns for this, which was great.

We didn't think this marinade had enough "zip". I have used my favorite bottled dressing with better results. We did enjoy having them on grilled Italian bread with grilled onions as suggested by a previous reviewer. We also melted provolone on at the last minute.

Unbelievably good! Capers are wonderful with it! Mom thought it was mild and could have onion rings in it. I thought it would be good to cut down the oil and use a tiny bit to mix, and then just spray some on each side of the roasting cap. But we all loved it.

The best thing about this was it was a snap to make!!  I substituted tarragon vinegar and added basil too, but still would have liked more of a burst of flavor.  Perhaps the balsamic vinegar the recipe calls for would have been better, but I didn't have it on hand.  I used 2 portobellos and put them on whole wheat hamburger buns.  I think they would have been better on crusty bread, but not as healthy.

Made these on a whim because I had the mushrooms and needed a quick recipe to use them up.  This recipe is great and so easy!  I served them on wheat buns and the capers really make it interesting.  When we ran out of tomatoes, my husband substituted salsa, which was nearly as good.

I did not make any changes and my husband said he could eat these every day.  I think I could, too.  I do not have 2 setting on my gas broiler so next time I will maybe flip them twice instead of once and then check for doneness.  I will also buy some better balsamic vinegar.  Thanks so much.

This was a very flavorful sandwich. I have a personal aversion to the taste of vinegar so I replaced the balsamic with  1 tbs lemon juice and 1 tbs blackstrap molasses. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.

This recipe is easy and delicious .  I did not have capers for the mayo and did without it.  The buns got a little butter spread and finely grated parmesan prior to toasting on a cast iron skillet.

These were delish! I put mine on dark rye bread which I lightly toasted in the oven with shredded mozza/cheddar cheese on it. My condiments were a spinach, kale and Bok choy mixture, green onion, crushed red chili flakes, a slice of tomato and light mayo. Super yummy!

So good! I read nitrojen's review before making these so I kept an eye on the mushrooms during the second half of cooking. Sure enough I saw tiny flames start to erupt with 1 min left in cooking time. I tried rearranging but that didn't do anything so I just took them out. Luckily they were perfectly cooked! The dressing is really delicious and combined with the caper mayo, magnificent!

I love portobello mushrooms so I was excited to try this. I used what I had on hand so modified the recipe a little and it was delicious. Healthy & yummy are always welcome. :-)

These were really tasty! Two things, first, DO NOT put the mushrooms on the very top rack or you will have a fire on your hands as another reviewer pointed out. Thankfully, I opened my oven just in time to see a tiny flame go out on one of the shrooms. Turned off my smoke alarm, moved them down a level and they were fine. Second, I thought the amount of thyme was a bit overpowering. Next time, I will add just a dash of thyme. This may be a personal preference thing, overall, very tasty and satisfied two adults, a teen and a three year old.

These were great! Healthier than a burger and just as filling in my opinion. I added sautéed red bell pepper and mozzarella cheese omitting the tomato. Didn't do the caper mayo cause we're not into them, used Dijon instead. I agree with other reviewers that these need an upgrade to the hamburger bun suggested, we used a ciabatta roll. We love balsamic so it wasn't too much for us.

I used this basic recipe but omitted the vinegar. It was delicious! I had a large cap so I should have broiled it 1 minute longer but I will know that for next time!

These are fabulous! Great alternative to ground beef! We followed the recipe but added provolone cheese to our "burgers" and served them with spicy sweet potato fries! I can't wait to make this again!

I'm a portabello mushroom sandwhich fanatic and I LOVED this recipe. My husband made it for me for our aniversary and it was amazing. He substituted olive oil with basil olive oil which was just what it needed.  I also made a basil aoli as the spread and added some muenster cheese. Mmmm...

Very good.  Only trouble is that the juicy mushroom soaked the bun and made it fall apart.

This was great! I was using up leftovers in the fridge and was out of capers and bread. Instead of the capers, so I used roasted red peppers instead, but it was delicious!  I'm adding this to my list of quick lunches.

The sandwiches were good but not great.  They did not come out as tasty as the ones I've had in restaurants.  Very messy, dripping all over the place.  If I try again, I'll go down one shelf before broiling.

This is an awesome recipe.  I don't eat mayonnaise, so I just put the capers on top and it tasted great!

Although I am a big fan of portobello mushrooms, and have had great P-burgers in the past, but these, I just didn't like.  Sorry!

My family really liked these burgers a lot.  We grilled them on an indoor grill, instead of broiling as suggested.  I would strongly suggest using a fancier type of bun than your average hamburger bun.
