This is excellent! I did not use the beef stock but it was still excellent! Served it with Bulgogi as suggested and this compliments it perfectly. The paste can be found in an Asian market. It starts out looking too thick but thins perfectly in this. This recipe is 5 stars all the way!

This is an excellent recipe!  I've made this twice now and it's quite addictive.   I did not use the beef stock, as I didn't have any, but I don't think the flavor suffered at all.  Served alongside grilled burgers that I basted in bulgogi sauce.  Turned out great and even the teenage daughter liked it.  Thanks!
