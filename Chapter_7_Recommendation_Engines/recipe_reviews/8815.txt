Excellent...I changed a few things,I used montery cheese/ garlic & herb soup mix and I added broccoli. Everyone loved it, had enough to make two deep dish pies. Very easy to make, next will be spinach and chicken quiche.

The quiche looked pretty when I took it out of the oven but the onion soup taste was overwhelming.  Maybe it would be better with half or a third of a package of the dry onion soup mix.

Recipe was great. I'm on low carb diet so I made it crustless and substituted heavy cream for skim milk.  It was still great!  My husband even liked it.  I will definitely make this one again!

Since finding this recipe, I've made this quiche several times and it never fails to impress! We never have tried the guyere cheese and instead just use cheddar and mozzarella, but its still incredibly delicioius. 5 stars!

Since I think I pretty much have the hang of making quiche, I almost never follow instructions exactly.  But I wanted to say that the addition of dry onion soup mix made the quiche phenomenal. I used 6 oz of chopped cooked chicken breast, about a cup of lightly steamed chopped broccoli, only 1 cup of cheese (cheddar), 3 eggs, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup heavy cream. I only used half the package of onion soup mix, which was perfect.  I also seasoned it with a dash each of: sea salt, black pepper, nutmeg, mustard powder, paprika and cayenne pepper. It was really awesome.  Oh, yeah, I didn't use a crust because I'm doing low-carb.

I altered it a bit by adding a sauted onion instead of the soup mix.  The chicken couldn't really be tasted but the cheese and the onion flavor was wonderful.  Will make again.  Even my boyfriend loved it!!

good stuff.  Never made quiche before and now I've made it twice in a week.  Also tried it with turkey ham.  Works out great when you wanna have breakfast for dinner and no one else does.

I thought this recipe was horrible.  I made this for my parents & they didn't even like it.  I ended up throwing all but 1 piece (the one that we all tried) out.

Very Good. I used only half the package of onion soup mix after reading other reviews, thank goodness! It would have been way too onion-y otherwise. But overall, a tasty quiche, very easy to prepare. I substituted Colby/Jack for the Gruyere and it was still good!

As quiche lovers, especially for easy dinners, I had high hopes for this one BUT they were dashed quickly with the first bite.  The texture is awful...  The parmesan made it grainy.  Use either fresh or shredded parmesan, that will melt.  NOt the cheap kind in the canister (the only kind I had).  That may help the texture out.  I just found it bland with a heavy dose of onion...  May work with some adjustments, but I don't think it is worth the effort.

I liked this recipe. I followed others' suggestions and only used 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix, but I think we would've liked it better with the whole packet. Also, this was pretty "liquidy", even after letting it set, so I'll probably cut down the milk some next time. I used swiss cheese in place of grueyre, since that's what I had on hand, and I used one large can of chicken. We are looking forward to the leftovers today!

My husband and I loved this. After reading some of the reviews I only put half of the onion mix and it was fine. Next time I might use even less but this is a great, easy recipe!

This was yummy! I, too, added spinach and used jalepeno Navarro cheese and cheddar cheese, as well as used half of the onion mix. I will definitely make this again!

My husband loved this, but I did not, so I gave it a rating somewhere in the middle.  I found the onion soup mix to be over-powering both in smell and taste.  I will make this again, with a few tweaks, since my husband liked it so much!

What a perfect dinner in no time.  I prefer to shred instead of cube the chicken, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

Very tasty.  A little salty from the onion soup mix.  I used cheddar cheese instead of gruyere.  My boys ate if up right away!  I would use a little less milk because there was a little too much liquid for the crust.

This was one of the worst recipes I've ever tried.  The appearance was very unappealing and the taste was unpleasant.    It was one of the few things I've made that was inedible.

this was very tasty! my husband and daughter loved it! the only reason I gave it four stars was it that it was a little sloppier than the quiche I usually make with 6 eggs and 1 cup of milk, so it didn't make for a very nice presentation. I would probably make that slight adjustment..otherwise delicious!

This was really fast and easy. I used dry savory herb seasoning mix (about 3/4 of the package) and cheddar/jack cheese in place of the gruyere, just because that is what we had on hand. It was delicious and even my kids ate it.

Onion flakes (dehyrated) would be better than onion soup mix.  Fresh, sauteed a little, would be better than that. The beef broth flavor addition isn't so good with eggs.  I used half envelope, which is 1 1/2T btw.  I prebaked my crust, too.

This recipe was the basis for a "clear out the leftovers" quiche.  I used bits of gouda, Swiss, and cheddar (mostly) cheese; seasoned,  cooked chicken breast mixed with onions and a few mushrooms sauteed in olive oil; NO onion soup mix; 4 eggs and heavy whipping cream; dried chives sprinkled on top (I didn't have paprika which would have been good). This made a deep-dish pie that rose beautifully.   Verdict:  fabulous!  I''ll do it again.

Great, easy recipe. I used Lipton onion mushroom soup mix and whole milk. The paprika on top gave it a nice look. Totally yummy. Thanks!
