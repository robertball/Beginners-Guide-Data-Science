Sorry, but poor instructions.  I've been making Eggs and chorizo for about 45 years now.  First off... you CAN'T say "three sausage links" as chorizo links come in different sizes.  There is NO STANDARD.  A chorizo sausage link from the supermarket is nearly a foot long.  A link from the butchers can be 3 to five inches long, AND one of the local markets deosn't even use links.  They leave the raw Meat free like hanburger chubs.  Second, you didn't specify, Beef, Pork, soy or Beef/pork mix.  Other than that, the directions were OK, but if you mess up the beginning, or, the FOUNDATION, if you will, you're gonna end up with BLECH.

By the way, SPANISH chorizo is already cooked.  These recipes/recomendations are for MEXICAN chorizo, which is RAW MEAT.

  Also, How many people know what how to tell when corn tortillas are cooked through?  Somneone is liable to end up with tortilla chips!  lol  Corn tortillas should be warmed up till they are soft... pliable.

I give FIVE STARS for the dish, but take away one for the instructions.  ;)

I make mine by taking 2 medium potatoes and dicing them. Cook these first. Then I add the  sausage. Cook until it’s done and add eggs. I use 3 eggs because of the added potatoes. Comes out amazing.

This is a tasty breakfast but I learned from my mistakes. I chose to use a tube of Cacique pork chorizo, which was a nice choice. I should have had my non-stick pan a little hotter than medium for cooking both the sausage and after adding the eggs. It turned into a muddled messy looking mixture but still tastes great. My other poor choice was to use standup taco shells because I wanted a hard shell instead of soft. I wish I had used a flat tostado hard shell instead, or else stuck with the recipe and used soft corn tortillas. Nevertheless, I topped with pepper jack cheese and some sour cream and enjoyed it. It wasn’t pretty or easy to eat, but it tasted good!

It meat free, I used SoyRizo instead of chorizo.  The flavor is incredible and it has much less fat

I have scrambled chorizo and eggs a few times, but prefer chorizo and potatoes. So good! Or you can do all three, very yummy with corn tortillas, cheese and salsa or peppers.

I have been cooking this for years and it's very simple to make. You can add fresh vegetables or just add cheese. My family loves it breakfast but it can be eaten as a lunch or dinner dish.

It looks to me from the picture, that you've added some shredded cheddar cheese.  Is that correct?
I'm rating this as 5 stars before I try it, only because it looks great and sounds delicious!

I'm not a big fan of chorizo  but this is a nice occasional change on breakfast tacos. If you like breakfast tacos and chorizo you will  probably like this. If you do not like chorizo, not so much.
