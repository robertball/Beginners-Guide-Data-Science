My daughter suffers severe allergies to many products including dairy, egg, nut and soy.  I prepare this recipe excluding the chocolate chips and end up with a lovely, moist cake which doesn't need frosting and keeps for a couple of days (if it gets the chance).  I've cooked the batter in every shaped pan imaginable, including a shaped birthday cake for my daughter, without any problems.  Obviously the cooking times varies slightly depending on the pan.  It even works well in muffin tins or patty pans - these are great to keep in the freezer!  Our favorite way to serve it is to cook it in a fluted ring tin, when cool fill the centre hole with with berries or cherries and dust with icing sugar.  It lookes as luscious as it tastes.  Most family and friends who know about my daughter's allergies cannot believe this cake is allergy friendly, and many use the recipe themselves.  In addition, while it may not be fat free, it is easily made cholesterol free by using the right kind of oil.  A thousand "thank you's" to the person who submitted this recipe - you've ensured that we have an option for a delicious cake for a little girl whose diet is restricted in so many ways.

My first go at this cake was not good at all - it broke up to bits....Then I decided to add what is called No Egg replacement by Norgran...which helps bind the cake a bit more....The cake was a huge success. Thank you for this recipe! I have a son that is Allergic to eggs & dairy and it was nice to be able to make a cake that tastes so wonderful. I have passed this recipe on to other mothers in the same boat as me who also wish to say thank you. Best Regards from Sydney Australia.

This is some tasty stuff! Vinegar is an interesting surprise ingredient in this, but you can't taste it at all in this recipe. I have tried this cake recipe without the chocolate chips, but instead of 1 cup of water, I used 1 cup of Chocolate Soy Milk. This makes an incredibly moist cake!

This is a ridiculously good chocolate cake recipe.  I didn't tell my family this had no eggs or dairy, and they all said it was amazing.  For my personal taste it needs a bit of frosting, the sweetness will accentuate the chocolate perfectly.  To everyone who had trouble with gritty cake, I would tell you that you didn't mix it enough.  I whisked mine for at least 3 minutes.  If it doesn't look just like normal cake batter you need to mix more, if it looks oily on top with bits of crumbs inside keep mixing.  This is a new keeper recipe for me!

Awesome recipe.  I made this for my daughter's 1st birthday party as she has a cow's milk allergy.  It was a hit!  I did think there was too much oil so instead of 5 TBSP of oil, I substituted 3 TBSP of oil and 3 TBSP of applesauce.   When I make this again, I will leave out the (non-dairy) chocolate chips as they really didn't add to the cake.

Tried this for my boyfriends 22nd birthday. He's allergic to everything including dairy, egg, nut, and soy. Did not expect it to turn out half as good as it did. Surprised me when it tasted just as good, if not better then a normal chocolate cake! Was a big hit, and would definately make it again.

I was, like everyone else, skeptical.  But this recipe is perfect!  My daughter's class has a student allergic to eggs and nuts and I have no experience with this at all.  Her teacher recommended this recipe to me and it worked great!  I didn't use the choco chips, but the cake was beautiful.  It works great for cupcakes too.  The only problem I found was that no one really said how much it made.  This will make the 8X8 pan listed, but that is only about 12-14 good sized cupcakes.  I ended up having to go back and make a whole new batch for the 24 I needed.  Well worth the effort.  Perfect!

This cake was soooo yummy! I used Pillsbury Milk Chocolate Flavor icing (contains no dairy) and my family loved it! My daugher is highly allergic to milk, eggs & nuts. Now I have a cake to make her when she goes to birthday parties. She can have her chocolate cake and soy ice cream and be "one of the regular kids" without feeling left out. It was very easy to make and economical too. Thanks so much to Bridget for sending this in!

I made this as a snack for my friend whose daughters have egg allergies.  I couldn't believe how quick, easy and tasty this was!!  Both girls seemed to like it, and we adults really liked it.  It was very light and nice and chocolatey (I did use Ghiradelli choc chips).  The center did puff up, and it was well done at the minimum cook time in my oven, so I would suggest checking the cake maybe after 25 minutes so you don't over do it.

All my boyfriends friends are vegan and any cakes they have tried to bake have been complete failures and tasted awful. With it being my boyfriend's 18th birthday I thought I'd give it a go myself. I tried this cake, expecting it not to work, then when we tasted it, it was amazing...too good to be true. He couldn't believe it was vegan and didn't have any dairy products. Highly recommended to everyone! It was totally easy to make!

I found this recipe the day after I found out my beautiful daughter was egg and dairy allergic. I was overwhelmed with the situation, and needed to put something together quickly for a birthday party that night (as I am now one of "those" moms).  This recipe was actually very good. I did it as written. I did not find it to be too chewy, or brownie like.  I made 10 cupcakes and cooked them for 25 mins on 350.  Probably could have been less, but I like a nice size cupcake.  In a strange way, this recipe was so good- it gave me the confidence to know I can still feed my daughter great-tasting foods, while not worrying about her allergies.

This cake was absolutely fantastic.  We made it for my son's first birthday.  He has no allergies, but two of the little ones who were attending did, and I was at my wit's end trying to find something good online.  I made this into 30 mini cupcakes (325 degrees F at 18 mins was perfect) and nobody could believe they were eggless.  I also left out the chocolate chips, but added another tablespoon of sifted cocoa.  The secret is very much in the mixing - it's almost impossible to overmix this batter, which is great for mini-cupcakes when the batter gets handled and scooped a lot.   For reference, I made another set of cupcakes today using an egg-and-dairy recipe, and they were totally inferior to this recipe here.  I'll be using this one from now on... and it's so cheap to make!  Very much a WWII-ration-friendly cake, and one that is going to be a permanent staple of our household.  We look forward to concocting other flavours!  Thanks again!

A MAJOR FLOP!  Don't waste your time or your ingredients (even though they're inexpensive ingredients).  Save time and bake an apple pie or something like that, which can also be egg-free, dairy-free, and nut-free.  This cake was rediculous.  The preparation was easy, the batter didn't look bad but the cooking took forever and after over 40-45 minutes of just plain baking!!, I ASSUMED it was done (which it should have been) and it was all gooey and gummy on the inside and bottom.  I followed the directions perfectly and it turned out horrible!  A WASTE OF TIME!  The only person who would like this cake is a person who is utterly starving or out of their senses.  Sorry, but I must be honest...this cake just SUCKED!  On a happier note, Happy Holidays!

Can be gluten free too!  I used Bob's All Purpose Gluten Free flour, added 3/4 tsp xanthan gum... and it's the BEST dairy free gluten free cake I've ever tried.  And we've tried a lot in the last 5 years - including many from bakeries.  This is far better!  Also - I experimented with a "cut out" cake for my son's birthday and found that if you refridgerate or freeze this cake, you can cut it into shapes rather well.

Use soy milk instead of water - add vinegar to soy milk and set aside to curdle while mixing dry ingredients. The reaction of the acid in the sour milk and the alkali of the baking soda makes for perfect leavening, no eggs required. This should help those who thought it was too dense.

I was amazed at how good this cake was. I read some of the other reviews and followed the advice of using almond milk instead of water and beating the mix for at least 3 minutes and it turned out perfectly. The best part was our 4 year old friend who attended our birthday party could partake in eating the cake as she is allergic to eggs and dairy. Thanks!

I am blown away by this cake!  I used Bob's Red Mill gluten-free flour blend so that all of the daycare kids would be able to eat this.  My daughter is turning one tomorrow and she is allergic to dairy.  I am so pleased with the way this cake turned out!  (I omitted the chocolate chips and I substituted coconut milk for the water.)

This was awful. It came out like a rubbery Frisbee, and was completely inedible. The vinegar was overpowering.

Oh my goodness!  Such a moist cake yet very chocolatey too! You wouldnt notice dairy and eggs missing from this cake.  I didnt even add the chocolate chips!  The cake does not rise so whatever depth your mixtures fills the pan - that the depth of the cake your cake will be.  I made two to sandwich together!

This cake is soooo delicious.  I made it and no one missed the eggs!  It's the only eggless cake I've seen that doesn't call for some egg substitute.  It was a huge hit!

This is the best egg free cake I have ever made. I added Via instant coffee to the water and omitted the chips, but other then that stuck strictly to the recipe. Made 12 perfect cupcakes, with better crowns then any cake I have ever made. I absolutely adore the Victory Chocolate Cake on this site, but my daughter's allergies make it a no go for our house desserts. With the addition of the coffee to this there is no flavor difference, just a slightly more moist/dense crumb This is a great base recipe that can be tweaked for individual tastes, a sign of a great baking recipe!
***Update*** Needed a change of pace, so I adapted to make a yellow cake with these changes: Used 5 Tbls. melted butter in place of oil, increased vanilla to 1 Tbls., and of course omitted the chocolate powder and chips. This came out so light and airy, and the flavor is out of this world!(If butter is off your menu you could probably keep the oil or try another butter flavor substitute).

I've baked different kinds of vegan cakes for our son.  He's allergic to eggs, dairy, and nuts.  I have to agree w/ some of the other users on how it falls apart. The key is to let it sit for an hour before trying them.  It will stay firm and hold together.  As for the chocolate chips, I did w/out considering the sugar intake as well as my son having allergies to the chocolate chips.  I baked both kinds just to taste the difference and there wasn't any.  I crumbled up some oreo cookies and placed them on top of Pilsbury vanilla frosting which is made w/ soy, (useful info for those w/ dairy allergies) and it was delish.

I love it! My son, who is allergic to eggs, has not had a decent cookie/cake/cupcake in his life.  Other (chocolate) cakes always had a strange aftertaste or were gummy. This is the best egg-free bakery item he (and I) have ever tasted.  I made the recipe into 12 cupcakes, instead of a cake. Baked them at 350ºF for 23 minutes and they came out perfect.  I used chopped up semi-sweet bakers chocolate instead of the chips. It gives the recipe a rich, decadent taste.  This is one to remember.  Thank you!

EXCELLENT!  I am a nursing mom who's son has a milk, egg and soy intolerance, which means some major diet changes for me.  I love my sweets, so this has been tough, esp. over the holidays.  This was a GREAT find and really helped meet my chocolate craving.  Moist and delicious.  Even my 3 year old and husband love it!  THANK YOU for sharing and making my day!

This cake is very moist and very chocolatey! No one ever believes that it is dairy free and egg free!!! - I make it for every one of my sons birthday parties as many children are allergic to dairy and eggs.  Some of the parents with children allergic have also asked for this recipe they love it so much!  My 'TIP' is that since I can never find the diary free chocolate chips, I blend up a dairy free chocolate bar (most dark chocolate bars are dairy free!)-(Green&Blacks for lushness!) until its almost a powder and measure it out that way!  I think it probably makes it even more chocolatey!!!  YUM!

I made this cake for my boyfriend who is allergic to nuts and eggs, but okay with dairy. I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips, and the cake was FANTASTIC!! I frosted it with store-bought dark chocolate frosting and topped it with sprinkles. The cake was a hit with my whole family. Great recipe - perfect for people with allergies. Thanks!

These turned out fine when I only used 1/4 teaspoon salt and increased the chocolate by one heaping teaspoon as someone had mentioned. I tried varying the recipe for vanilla flavor, but it always turned out too dense. My husband doesn´t like it as much as when I make it with milk for him. But for me who can´t have the milk, it´s fine. I found making it into cupcakes was best.

This cake is amazing - I did make a few changes: I used whole wheat pastry flour (it's the only flour I keep in the house), doubled the amount of cocoa (I also used Dutch processed, don't know if it made a difference), chocolate soy milk instead of water, 3 tablespoons canola oil and 3 tablespoons apple/prune baby food, and I added an egg white (so it's not vegan, but still dairy free).  I made this for my sister's birthday - she LOVES chocolate, but is allergic to dairy.  She actually had to "take a break" because it was so rich and chocolatey, but she LOVED it!  The whole family did - in fact, they said I could sell it at our local coffee shop, it was so good.  It really was amazingly rich, chocolatey, and moist with the changes I made.  Try it - you'll love it!

This is the first food-allergy-friendly treat I've ever tried to make.  My son will be celebrating his first birthday next month so I tried this recipe out so I can bake him a cake he can actually eat, or make a mess out of. =D    I followed the recipe to the T for this first try and I am extremely happy with the result.  I reduced the cooking time to 25 minutes since I made cupcakes out of them instead of a sheet cake.  I also sifted all my dry ingredients just to help with the density.    The result is a light and fluffy cupcake that tastes chocolaty, not too sweet and you won't miss the egg.   I am extremely happy with the result.  Happy cooking!  Happy eating!

I made this cake today and it is a flat gewy piece of something.. but not cake.   When Is tarted mixing it it was so clumpy that I used a handmixer to get it smooth. I am not sure if that messed it up?  I am sad, after all these rave reviews I was excited to finally make a cake for my allergic son that he can enjoy.    If anyone knows why it turned out this way, let me know

I have a friend whose two year old has 30+ food allergies, including nuts, eggs and dairy foods. I first made this cake for my daughter's birthday party so that he could eat the same as the other kids - what an easy recipe, and tastes like just about any other chocolate cake. I do add a splash of Wilton's fake butter flavor to make it a little richer (when I remember). Using oil instead of butter even makes it easier to stir (no 'creaming'!) so my preschoolers can more easily participate in making the cake also. I now make either cupcakes or cake with this recipe every time we are at an event at their house or vice versa. The mom thinks it's such a big deal that I make a 'special' cake just so her son can eat with the other kids, she just won't believe me when I tell her it's REALLY no big deal with this recipe!! lol. There's a 'meet the baby' party at their house for a new arrival in a couple of weeks, and we've already RSVP'd "plus cake" :)

JUST LOVE this .... for a mother of a child with a peanut allergy this is PERFECT.  Tastes great.  Since I'm more aware of children with allergies and some that don't know they have allergies this is a GREAT safe guard.

Delicious, easy recipe.  The only thing I omitted was the chocolate chips, but they taste moist and chocolatey without them.

I make these as cupcakes (350 degrees for 20 minutes), frost them with Pillsbury frosting (dairy and egg-free), and freeze them.  That way I can easily bring a few to birthday parties so my son doesn't feel left out by not having all the treats at the party.

Wow, I was skeptical, but with my son's egg allergy I thought I would give it a try.  The batter was super runny and I ALMOST threw it out.  I decided to just see how it would turn out and I am glad I did.  It was the best chocolate cake I have ever had.  Way better than a box mix.  The chocolate chips all sank to the bottom of the pan and somehow managed to not melt into the batter, that is the only reason I didn't give it a 5.

The preparation and mixing of the batter was easy,  I baked for the recommended amount of time and when i opened the oven door.  The cake had exploded all over my oven.  The outer cake was cooked but the center was a gooey mess.  I have never had this happen to me.  I am going to use traditional recipes in the future.

I just recently found this recipe and I am glad I did. My 2yr old daughter also suffers from severe allergies including but not limited to wheat, egg, dairy, peanut, etc. I made this cake for her 2nd birthday and it was fabulous. No one at her party even knew! I just frosted it with a reg. can of pilsbury confetti frosting and it was perfect!! The only problem I had was that the chocolate chips stuck to the bottom of the pan so I am not really sure what I did wrong. Other than that it was really fantastic. I will eventually try it with a gluten free flour but she tolerated the amount of flour in this pretty good. This is definately a recipe staple in my household. Thank you so much. This enables my tiny tot to have something sweet when she is limited by so much.

These were great! To keep it completely dairy free I used chocolate soy morsels and they were really yummy (and I added 1 cup instead of 1/2). For baking cupcakes, you only need to bake them for about 18 minutes.
I also made a different version that was still egg free but not completely dairy free because I used white chocolate chips. Several of the little kids didn't like the chocolate version, so instead of the cocoa and chocolate chips, I added 1.5 tsp of lemon extract (along with the vanilla extract) and white chocolate chips. The kids loved them=)

Amazing!! This cake is moist and delicious. I chose it not because of allergies but because I had no dairy ingredients and wanted cake! lol Instead of 1 cup cold water I brewed a few cups strong coffee and chilled one cup. I also added crushed walnuts (since I usually LOVE them in brownies). This is a keeper!

I have made this cake several times and it always goes over amazingly! It turns out moist, fluffy and SO DELICIOUS! I found, though, that mixing the chocolate chips in the batter made the cake flat and heavy, so I just put them between the two layers of cake instead.

I  made this cake for our family Christmas so that my nephew with egg allergy could have cake.  It was delicious and moist.  More like a brownie but oh so much better than trying to doctor a box mix to go egg-less.  I will definitely make this cake again. First time I  made it everything went great, 2nd time I made it I forgot the chocolate chips; they do help with making it a richer flavor but it was still good without them.

I made this cake last week. It was amazingly delicious. I had/used Special Dark Cocoa and Special Dark Chips. I find sifting the cocoa makes it easier to incorporate. Also used 3/4 c. chips. Kids ate it all in one night.

This recipe was awesome! I used chocolate soy milk instead of water and added the vingear to the milk and set it aside while mixing dry ingredients.  I also took out the chocolate chips and you can't even tell its egg and dairy free!! Very moist and chocolatey!!

I came across this recipe while doing some research for a wedding cake I was making for a friend who is allergic to dairy and eggs.  I've made a test recipe and let him and his fiance try it.  They loved it.  In fact they called a few days later and begged for the recipe  to satisfy a "safe chocolate" craving.  Not only that, but my family enjoyed it too.  Nice to add this one to the cake repetoire!!

I am surprised at the rating for this recipe. It tasted like bad fudge. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Eggs and dairy definitely make a huge difference in my book. I just wanted to try this because I lacked the main two delicious ingredients.

this was really average.  perhaps for someone who is used to vegan baked goods, it would taste good.  but compared to more rich classic baked good, this really pales.  the chocolate flavor is bland and very mild, and the cake was rather gummy.  i tried this bc i had run out of eggs (not bc we were allergic or vegan.)  very mediocre.

I am so glad I found this recipe! My daughter has multiple food allergies. She is allergic to cow's milk, nuts & eggs. This cake turned just as good as the regualr cakes I've made or eaten. I can't believe how good it is! It is so moist! I am just glad to finally find something that she can enjoy other the usual stuff that she's allowed to have. I look forward to continuing looking for more recipes of this type. Thanks!

SO good.  My little one noted that it does have a bit of a reddish hue to it - sort of like red velvet, but no where near as red (guessing that's from the vinegar and baking soda) ;)  Just gave up cows' dairy - but am about 7 months pregnant - and not about to give up snacks!  This recipe totally saves the day.  Thanks!!

Super moist and really yummy, you totally don't miss the dairy at ALL in this cake.  However, while the chocolate chunks taste good (I used ghiradelli - no need to visit a health food store like the description says, buy an up brand and it likely doesn't have the added dairy the cheapy brands like Nestle and Hershey have) they are not very conducive to cutting and shaping your cake!  I had such a hard time because the chips would be in the way and I'd end up losing them chips and leaving a little hole.  Grrr.  But for a plain sheet or round cake without having to cut and shape - great.

Thanks for this great recipe! I looked up recipes for eggless cakes for my toddler's birthday party since he's allergic to eggs and nuts. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but hoped for the best.  It was a hit! I highly recommend this recipe.  I'm glad my son can enjoy cake from time to time and have realized that eggs are not necessary to have a delicious dessert.  : )

Delicious recipe! I made them into cupcakes for my son's school since one of his classmates is allergic to eggs. Unfortunately I didn't realize until after I baked them that Tollhouse Chocolate Chips are processed in a plant that also processes peanuts (and its a nut-free school), so I need to make a second batch without those. I guess there's more for us to eat at home!

This recipe is FANTASTIC and by far the BEST egg/nut/dairy free cake recipe I have tried (and I've tries MANY). The only change I made was I substituted Chocolate Soy Milk for the water. The chocolate chips made a nice addition and made the cupcakes seem more "authentic", like a real cupcake! My son (who is allergic to dairy, eggs & nuts) and all 50 of our birthday guests, LOVED them. A definite keeper!

This is the first egg free cake I have made that wasn't flat and didn't crumble and it was great! You wouldn't know it was 'free' of so much!

A marvellous recipe for allergy sufferers!  My 'dairy and egg allergic' 3 year old son has at last tried his first, second, third and fourth slice of chocolate cake today. The only changes I made to the recipe were to use chocolate flavoured soya milk rather than water and I omitted the choc chips.  Also I baked it for 40 minutes in a fluted ring. I noted some of the previous recommendations and made sure I whisked the milk into the dry mixture for a good 3 minutes to avoid grittiness. I've baked many chocolate cakes in the past, which have included egg and dairy and the only difference I would say is that this cake is 'very slightly' more like a brownie, but only slightly.  Even so, it was DELICIOUS.  I really can't understand how some people have failed with this easy recipe. I plan to use this recipe for my son's 4th birthday cake using a character shaped tin. I was tempted to use the 'No Egg' by Orgran but decided to try without first and see how I got on. I don't think it would have made any difference but I may at some point test that theory! I will definitely be using this recipe for many years to come, even if my son grows out of his allergies! Enjoy!

BEST chocolate cake recipe ever! I am a vegan and was really happy to make a cake which my non-vegan family could enjoy without thinking of it as a vegan cake (which, in the past, haven't gotten such high remarks by my family!).  I made a few adjustments, however.  I am kind of a health freak, so I used evaporated cane juice as sugar, whole wheat flour, unsweetened cocoa powder, and changed the oil to 3tbsp natural applesauce & 2tbsp veg oil.  I also used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips because I read reviews saying the chips didn't melt enough.  The minis melted just perfectly, and gave the sense that there was icing intricately placed inside my cake! As for icing, the cake would have done fine without it, but I dusted the top with powdered sugar and it was perfect! I will DEFINITELY make this cake again and again and again! Thank you!! :)

My son was diagnosed with allergy to milk and egg (among other things) 6 years ago. We've tried all the recipes and settled on this one several years ago -- we never use the other recipes. This one is hard to beat for ease and taste -- non-allergic tasters usually can't tell the difference.

We use whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose (Daughter is allergic to barley in the all-purpose) but it's a good way to increase whole grain intake.

We also use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Watch out for chocolate chip ingredients if you use (we often make without) -- if you're trying to make this dairy-free you'll need to get either soy chocolate chips (from a health food store) or double dark chocolate chips that have no milk added. Watch the ingredients!

We sometimes top with skittles or hot cinammon candies.

These are delicious.  You would never know that they are egg free.  My daughter has allergies to eggs and this was the first eggless recipe I tried.  It is super easy to prepare.  My finicky eater, pie-snob husband even raved.  Awesome recipe!

OMG this cake ROCKS!
Fixed it for my non-dairy guests and they couldn't believe it.  I used the soy milk instead  of the water and YUM.  I am going to try to use cold coffee and see how that works.
Not only is this the best ever dairy-free cake but it's the best ever chocolate cake!
THANKS!

Made this recipe for a  coworker who couldn't normally enjoy corporate birthday cakes. It was a hit! Everyone else who tried it couldn't believe was made without eggs.

This cake recipe is A-one! Fabulous texture and flavor, light and lucious!! It saved my birthday - I've been dieting and had no butter in the house... didn't need it here at all! My frosting was a simple glaze of melted chocolate chips with some SoySilk hazelnut coffee creamer and it was the perfect touch. My one tip: use an excellent quality veg oil as you are sure to taste it if you don't.

As I am a Christian it is nice to have this when I am fasting from dairy. I tried it with finely chopped dried dates instead of the chocolate chips and it was delicious.

YUM! This recipe made 12 beautiful cupcakes for a cupcake walk at school. I wanted my daughter to have a choice if she won, since she's allergic to dairy.I frosted with Tianne's Chocolate Frosting 1 (substituting soy milk and using d-f margarine). I didn't tell anyone they were dairy free, and they were the first ones gone. Super good,super easy and allergy friendly. We'll use this one again and again. Thanks for a great recipe, Bridget!

I'm lactose intolerant, so I thought I'd give this a go since I had some semi-sweet chocolate chips in the house (which are dairy-free, at least the variety I bought.) Overall, I thought this was pretty tasty, but would benefit from frosting, which I didn't have the ingredients for. It's a little crumbly, but other than that, it's great. I cooked it in a 7x11 dish and 35 minutes was perfect timing.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday b/c she is can't have dairy and made it again as cupcakes for work.  No one could believe there was no dairy or eggs in it.  Omitted the chocolate chips and didn't miss them at all. This was awesome.

My neice is allergic to dairy and eggs, and has never had a proper birthday cake or been able to eat anyone elses ( and we have a huge family, so that is a lot of disappointment) till I tried this cake.  It is now our standard birthday cake, so my little neice can always have a piece of cake, and the delight on her face is wonderful to see.  i have now made it half a dozen times, and everytime, it has come out moist and delicious.  Thanks, bridget!

Wow! This cake is truly amazing and easy to prepare.  Absolutely delicious.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and I used Pillsbury Frosting (dairy-free) to ice the cake.  I will definitely be making this cake often! Thanks for such an easy and tasty recipe.

Just amazing!  Our daughter may have an egg allergy, so while we wait to find out for sure, we have to avoid eggs.

I came across this recipe and we made 10 cup cakes out of it!  I also used an eggless frosting that I hope to post soon.  This cake was very moist and it didn't last long!

We made this for our daughter's First Birthday Party and kids and parents just raved.  Thank you Bridget!

This is a great recipe! I have made it many times now. My only issue is that the cake seems to implode on itself and create a crater in the middle once I take it out of the oven. I think this has something to do with the vinegar inside, as this has happened to my red velvet cakes too. Any suggestions on how to fix this problem? I greatly appreciate it!

This is a really good cake for those with egg and dairy allergies. Baked up just like a regular cake would and was SUPER easy to make. I think the key is to follow the instructions about mixing all ingredients well and then adding water. I could see how this would be hard to mix smooth unless you did this step well. I am making this for my baby's first birthday and she has a milk, egg and soy allergy. Thank you for this great option!

This is the only Chocolate Cupcake I use and it turns out moist and delicious every time! You can't even tell that there is no eggs or milk in it! I love the addition of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter, it makes the cupcake even more decadent! 5 stars all the way!

This was great! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I made 2 modifications based on comments and my own needs. I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil because I need to be soy-free, and used coconut milk instead of water. Like others, I did not add chips to the batter but I did sprinkle them on top of the frosting. I also made cupcakes, but will definitely try this as a cake soon. I made sure to mix really well using a whisk. It was such an easy, quick recipe. No one would ever know it's dairy free!!!

Like others, I was skeptical, but this cake worked out surprisingly well and got good reviews by my taste tasters. I also made this cake gluten-free and so I substituted all-purpose GF mix using the same quantities. I doubled this recipe to make a decent size cake and baked it in a bundt pan (bake it a bit more than it says in the recipe if you do this), just to make it look nicer really, as I knew I wasn't going to frost it, then dusted it with icing sugar. I also served it with chocolate-covered strawberries - yum! I left out the chocolate chips. The only thing I think would improve this is if it was served with a chocolate glaze of some sort. And like others have commented on already, I mixed the batter well (3 minutes with my KitchenAid stand mixer).

I used to be a huge baker before I discovered I was gluten-intolerant and GF goods have always turned me off, but this recipe restores my faith in baking!

On my 3rd try (I was determined to make this work!)  I made a few changes - and with those changes I would give this a solid 5 star rating.  #1 - DO NOT add chocolate chips - they sink to the bottom and make a hard, stuck on mess of a crust, #2 - Use cold, strong coffee instead water, this makes up for the lack of chocolate chips and adds depth to the chocolate without tasting any hint of coffee flavor, and #3 - grease, dust with cocoa powder AND line with parchment paper, both the bottoms & sides and then grease/dust, those as well.  You end up with a deliciously fudgy, dense chocolate cake that will not stick to the freaking pan!

This was super delish - my sister-in-law made it too after trying mine!  All my friends are asking me for more and guess what - I actually prefer it  and made it with carob chips and carob powder and never missed the actual chocolate!  I love it, it's super moist and has a great presentation...very surprising...I have made this  times already!

Yum!  I just made a pan of 24 mini-cupcakes and they turned out really good.  I have a 2 year old grandson that is allergic to eggs and another that does not like chocolate, so I omitted the chocolate and added cinnamon.  This is going into my recipe database.  Thanks Bridget for sharing this recipe.

I didn't have any chocolate chips so made it without--  it was still a delicious chocolatey moist cake! I just found out I am allergic to eggs, so I made this for my birthday cake, and it was  wonderful-- thanks for the recipe!

Used lemon juice instead of vinegar, eye-balled the salt, cocoa, baking soda and vanilla, used a little extra oil and a little less water, used whole wheat flour, skipped the choco chips...AND IT WORKED VERY WELL!

These were really good!  My daughter has an egg allergy, so I made these for her 3-year-old soccer team party.  The kids ate them up and many of the parents were surprised they were dairy and egg free.  I doubled the recipe and it made 22 regular-sized cupcakes.  I also followed the advice of a previous reviewer and used 6 TBSP applesauce and 6 TBSP oil (for a double batch) to cut down on the oil.  I also used whole wheat flour and it worked out fine.  They took about 20 minutes in the oven and were perfectly done.  Will definitely make again!

Better than the chocolate cake recipe on the Hershey's cocoa box!  I make cakes for family and friends, had a special request for a dairy free chocolate cake so I went with this one.  So very good and moist!  Stood up to me carving it into a fish shape as well.

Great cupcakes!!  They actually rose and didn't crumble apart when eating!  Both my kids loved them.  I generously scooped the heaping measure of cocoa and added 1 tsp of Pane Riso egg replacer to make sure they didn't come out crumbly which I really don't think I needed. I baked for 20 minutes to make 12 great looking cupcakes that you could easily frost without damaging the cake.

Another adaptation of this great cake is to use 100grams Diary Free White Chocolate (I use the Sweet William brand) instead of the cocoa and the texture is more like a white chocolate mud cake but still quite light, moist and fluffy when eaten.  Fantastic cake!!! A huge thank you to the person that posted this recipe. My dairy intolerant baby boy can finally have a cake for his b'day that wont upset his stomach.

I have been making this cake for years! The only difference is that my recipe does not use chocolate chips.  The version that I know is called Crazy Cake and I learned how to make it in Home-Ec way back in the mid-seventies!!!  It is my 78 year old mother's favorite chocolate cake.

This has been my go-to recipe for chocolate cakes, cupcakes - anything, since my oldest's 1 yrs old bday party... in 2009. I chose it because not all her "friends" were 1 yet and I wanted something safe for everyone to eat, but geez, this recipe is SO GOOD, I just kept using it since. And it's a quickie to make too. Can whip it up i. A jiffy, using only one mixing bowl, one fork and a spoon to spoon it at the end, and a few measuring cups. Hardly any dishes. Easy to double too. My family loves it and usually asks me to bake the cake/cupcakes with this recipe, and it's a hit at potlucks too. Try it - you'll never go back either ;)

I've been making this non-stop for all my egg-free cake needs. Last time replaced the water with milk, I think it tasted better. Really good with cream cheese frosting. Good egg-free cake recipe. Want to find more.

Excellent recipe. I made in a muffin pan for my daughter's class (one child is allergic to dairy), and it turned out moist and tasty. I replaced the water with Chocolate Soy Milk and left out the chocolate chips. Will keep this recipe!

This recipe was awesome.  My daughter has multiple food allergies and this cake tasted soooo good!  I also made my cake wheat free by using rice flour.  Like many others I left out the chocolate chips. THANK YOU THANK YOU for this yummy allergy free (at least for my daughter) cake :-)

No More Crumbly Cakes for us!!!! My son is allergic to eggs and we have tried many, many egg replacements and egg-free recipes for cakes.  All of the them came out crumbly (you had to freeze the cake to be able to ice it and then when you cut it,the cake feel apart).  This recipe, i am happy to say, did not do that.  It cut like a "normal" cake and tasted great too.  The only change i made was using milk instead of water (since we dont have a milk allergy issue).   It was wonderful in its texture and its flavor - we will be using this all the time!!

Wow.  My son has severe food allergies and this recipe fit the birthday bill perfectly.  Amazing thing is, no one could tell it was allergen-free because it was so moist and delicious.  It kept well stored for days.  Thanks.

Hubby and I had much higher expectations from the reviews.   We made it exactly as stated except we used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil.   It also took us about 40 minutes until the tookpick came out clean.  Hubby's comments:  It's missing something, it didn't taste like cake but like a mix between a cookie and a brownie.

I too was skeptical with this recipe.  The batter did not taste too good, but the cake was AWESOME!  It is so moist and held together just fine!   I did make it WHEAT FREE too.  I used Bob's Gluten Free Red Mill Flour, added 3/4 tsp. of xanthan gum.  I used canola oil and cane sugar instead of the white refined sugar.  I also used dairy free semi-sweet chocolate chips and they melted just fine!  I wouldn't leave them out in my opinion!  I'll be making this again and again for my grandson!  He loved it and everyone else did too!  Now we can all eat the same dessert!  THANK YOU!

LOVE THIS CAKE.  Recipe is great as is.  However, I love my chocolate so I increase chips to 3/4 cup... I like to make this cake for dinner guests.  Pop it into the oven and let cake cook while we're eating dinner.  When served while still warm from the oven, you'll find melty pockets of chocolate heaven...   
NOTE: the chips do harden when cooled so adjust accordingly.  In our case, an 8x8 pan doesn't have time to cool--  it's gobbled up too fast!

I'm breastfeeding a child who is showing an allergic reaction to something in my diet, so I have had to cut out eggs/dairy out of my diet (goodbye sweets!) But this cake was really awesome!  I added a layer of chocolate icing, by using cocoa powder, soy milk, vanilla extract, semi-sweet chocolate chips and margarine (melt together in a double boiler and let cool before adding to cake) and it turned out great!

Very moist and good flavor but was a bit crumbly. I wasn't a fan of the chocolate chip texture either - they don't completely melt so kind of odd to be biting into hunks of chocolate but some might find that OK. Also hard to get out of the pan if you just grease it - I would use flour too. The temp and bake times were right for my oven. Those that had problems likely have ovens that are off. Mine is new and digital so is spot on with the temp. Get an oven thermometer! Great investment.

I love it, specially my husband and my daughter. I used carob in powder instead of cocoa powder. And it was great. Turn out to be egg-free dairy-free nut-free and chocolate-free.
Thanks

I thought this was good but a little plain. Not sure if I did something wrong, because I expected better after all the rave reviews. I used vanilla soy milk instead of water, and added 1 egg. I also used half whole wheat flour, so maybe that made the difference. I topped with canned buttercream frosting, so all in all it tasted pretty good.

This was better than the cake I bought for the guests!  You don't miss the eggs or dairy.

Awesome cake recipe! After dicovering an allergy to eggs, I didn't think I'd get to eat truly great cake again. I've tried dozens of recipes and this is the first that has tasted 'normal'... in the best (and tastiest) sense possible!

Yes, it's true!  This is the BEST BEST BEST cake or brownies I've made!  One secret:  I used Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips (they are lactose-free).  This was soooo good!

The cake came out tasty, but fell apart. It took 40 minutes in my oven. I will try to add a banana next time. Maybe it will bind.

Our boy goes to a pre-school where almost all the kids have one allergy or another. So an allergen-free recipe is what has saved our bacon since jr was 1yo. We didn't use the choc-chips as decoration but instead used lollipops. As for those who poo-pooed this recipe, it might be worth checking your own methods or short-cuts!

Really good for egg and dairy free!  I did have to cook it 10 minutes longer, but also subed almond milk for water and 2 tbsp. oil for 2 applesauce.   Very fluffy and great for allergies!

Everyone has basically said all the good things about this recipe. Very delicious, moist etc. Only swaps I made were brown sugar instead of white (that's all I had, use a little under 1 cup unpacked) and half milk/half water (no dairy allergy just egg). My only advice is do not over fill your cupcake tin/liners if you're making cupcakes. I got a little over-zealous and oh boy, did this puff up and over flow. Delicious still! But messy and not very pretty haha. I was at about 3/4 full. Woops.

I made these yesterday since we have a girl coming to my daughters bday who is allergic to eggs. I actually had zero hope that they would work out but they were sooo good!! I followed the recipe exactly and they were great. I made cupcakes out of them and they rose perfectly. Yummy! Thanks again for the great recipe!!

My son is allergic to egg, nuts and dairy, so I tried this recipe to see if it was as good as everyone said.  THIS is the BEST cake I have ever tasted!  Everyone loved it and they were  shocked that it was dairy free!  I followed some reviewer's advice and made my own little changes:  2 tbsp of oil and 3 tbsp of apple sauce.  I also used rice milk instead of water. The longer you mix the batter, the better the cake!   This will now be a staple in our household!

Made these today in cupcake form for my daughter's birthday, she's allergic to egg's and dairy.  They turned out fabulous! Baked up in perfect dome shape, I was amazed.  Only change was to omit choc chips and dissolve (1)T instant coffee granules in (2)T hot water, then add enough cold water to make the (1)C called for in recipe to deepen the chocolate flavor. Sorry I did'nt take a picture, because they really were picture perfect.  Baked @ 350 for 18 min's, got 11 standard size cupcakes (filled batter 3/4 full). Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

My 6 year old daughter is allergic to milk, eggs, soy, and peanut.  She LOVES chocolate, so it is always a challenge to find something she can eat.  I made this cake for a bday party that I knew would have a regular chocolate cake so she would have something...it was terrific, easy to make, and everyone who tried it said they didn't know it was an allergy free cake!  Three of the kids actually ended up eating more of this cake than of the typical cake!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I doubled the Cocoa powder as someone else did and also added 2 more T's of oil (canola, due to allergies) and it came out great! Didn't use chocolate chips. It stuck to the pan a little so next time I will grease AND flour the pan.

Lovely! I was making the cupcakes for a friend's birthday, and one of the guests is allergic to eggs. I made this recipe and a regular chocolate cake recipe and everyone liked these better! They rose nicely, though it took a couple tries. I tried substituting cake flour, but it doesn't have the protein to hold the batter together. AP flour is important.

I just made some cupcakes using this as a base recipe. I didn't have semi sweet chocolates and enough flour so I improvised. I only put 1 cup of flour since that's all the flour I had left. And I also used powdered mocha drink instead of semi sweet chocolates. I also reduced the water to half a cup since it was turning very liquid-y already while I was adding the water. The result turned out good! Topped it with a mocha cream cheese frosting. Yum! 

When I have all the ingredients on hand, I'll try it again sticking to the recipe.

I rarely leave reviews on recipes, but this one was SOOO good it deserves a positive review.  I wanted to bring cupcakes to my daughter's preschool class for her birthday, but one of the kids is allergic to peanuts and one is allergic to eggs.  When I found this recipe, I knew I had to at least try it.  I made the 8x8 cake last night (to try before I attempt cupcakes tomorrow), and it was the BEST homemade cake I have EVER had.  Not only do I NOT like homemade cake, but chocolate homemade cake is my least favorite.  WOW!  This one is the exception to every rule!  It was moist and dense, which is exactly the things I love about cake.  It will make the perfect cupcakes!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Truvia instead of sugar (since this one was for us), as we tend to eat mostly sugar free in my house. It was so good it didn't even need the frosting (could have put a little whipping cream or powdered sugar on it), although I did use a small amount of my favorite homemade frosting. 

I will probably ALWAYS use this recipe when I make cakes from now on.  Why mess with perfection??

I just made this tonight and it turned out excellent! My husband was shocked when he tasted it. We both love how dense and moist the cake turned out. It is a perfect mix between brownie and cake. :)! If you have a pretty big sweet tooth, you can add extra semi-sweet chocolate chips (or some dairy free frosting). I did follow some other reviews that said to mix the batter until smooth to prevent problems. I mixed until there were absolutely no lumps, and scraped the sides of the bowl multiple times to ensure even mixing. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for the wonderful allergy free cake.  My son will have a delicious cake for his 3rd birthday.  The cake was flavorful with the substitution of chocolate soy milk, and minus the chocolate chips (couldn't find any without milk).  I accidently mixed all the wet ingredients together, but the cake still came out perfect. By far, the best allergy free cake I have tasted.

After reading one of the other reviewer's comments, I went and bought some egg substitute to add to the recipe. The equivalent of one egg was added on top of the other ingredients, and this cake was moist and delicious. I combined it with an organic icing mix from my local food co-op and put the icing on while the cake was still warm, as my mom used to do. Everyone at the thesis defense celebration I attended loved it! I was even told I should make it again for my own defense. :-)  I should mention, however, that though the recipe calls for the oil, vinegar, etc to be added and mixed until everything is moistened, this proved impossible because everything clumped too quickly and too thickly to mix until I added the water. (I just used a wire whisk to mix with, though I doubt an electric mixer would've been able to do much better.)

Amazing this is the best egg free chocolate cake i have ever had that includes pre made from the store. I used melted dairy free butter because I didnt have oil and blended the batter till completely smooth. I made frosting but honestly didn't need it. Thanks for this!

I needed an egg free/dairy free recipe for my daughter's daycare since one of the students has milk/egg allergies. I did use soy milk instead of water, and I did not put in chocolate chips because I wanted less sugar for the toddlers. The batter was super easy to make, I made sure to mix it really well and I created a double batch which made 24 cupcakes. They did rise some but not too much. The taste is quite yummy although I can tell a difference from 'regular' chocolate cake, this kind of tastes like a mild or slightly bland chocolate cake (maybe that's why it called for chocolate chips). But for what it is, they were amazing and the toddlers in her class will love them! We decorated with Pillsbury vanilla frosting. Also, the texture of the cake is just like 'real' cake I had no issues with that at all. Next time I will use chocolate soy milk instead of regular and hopefully that will help make them a bit richer. Thanks for this amazing and super easy recipe! The daycare teachers were very appreciative of me making these allergy free treats for all of the kids to enjoy!

Very tasty! So moist and you would never know there was vinegar in it. I omitted the chocolate chips because it was chocolately enough :)

Thanks so much to Bridget for sharing a delicious cake recipe:) I looked up the recipe because I had a guest with alergies to egg and milk so I thought this would work and it did! Furthermore, cake mixes here in Spain are usually pricey so knowing how to make this cake from scratch helps even more! The truth is it is really easy to make. Thanks again!

As the resident baker in the family I was really nervous about finding an egg free dairy free soy free cupcake recipe for my cousins sons birthday.  This was one of the first ones I found and I was at ease after reading the rave rhey did all the reviews!  They did all the things a good cupcake should and taste great!!!!

Fantastic!  I took note of other reviewers' comments and substituted the water for chocolate soy milk and used 3 tbl applesauce/2 tbl oil instead of 5 tbl oil.  It turned out moist, fluffy and delicious without a hint of bland or aftertaste.  It's definitely a keeper for those with dairy, egg and nut allergies.  I made this for my DS's 1st grade class that has a lot of kids with allergies.  Just be sure to buy cocoa powder that takes care to avoid crossover of allergens.

This was GREAT.  Made it for my daughter's 2nd birthday.  Lots of picky folks and no one could believe it was "free" and so good.  We even froze some and they tasted just as great a few weeks later.

I was very pleased with how this turned out. I served it to guests & they thought it tasted like "normal" cake.  I wanted to cut down on the oil, so I used 3T applesauce & 2T oil.  I also used soy milk instead of water.  I left out the chocolate chips since I didn't have any. I will probably add more cocoa powder next time. I will definitely continue to use this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I first made this recipe just under a year ago, but have made it so many times since then!  It's a big hit for our son & nephew with allergies, and is enjoyed by all.  Those without allergies like the fudginess of it.  I use plain soymilk instead of water.  For birthday parties where I don't get to make an allergy-friendly cake, I make half this recipe for a batch of 8 cupcakes (bake 20-22 min) so my son can still enjoy a treat with the rest of the kids.  I top with Pillsbury vanilla frosting & sprinkles when in a pinch.  (Read labels carefully, as not all their flavors are dairy-free). I've also made 2 batches of this for a two-layer round cake with an excellent chocolate icing recipe from the "What's to Eat?...Food Allergy Cookbook" by Linda Marienhoff Coss.  (Who, by the way, has this identical cake recipe in her book, but double the amount).

This chocolate cake definitely deserves a better name, because it was amazingly moist, chocolately, and delicious.  Allergy-sufferer or not, you will love this recipe.  I only made two changes, one by accident and one on purpose: I substituted Hershey's Cocoa Powder Special Dark for the regular cocoa powder (that was on purpose), and omitted the chocolate chips (by accident).  We didn't miss the chocolate chips at all (maybe because of the dark cocoa?).  I made the batter into cupcakes, which took about 20-22 minutes to bake.  So-o-o-o good with coconut pecan frosting!

For what this cake is (dairy free) it s 5 stars.  It is very moist and surprisingly good, but there is that little bit of "off" taste which must come from the lack of dairy.  But don't get me wrong, this is still a tasty cake and a great alternative for people that need to avoid dairy and/or eggs.  I was able to get 1 dozen cupcakes from this recipe and just sprinkled some powdered sugar since I couldn't find a good dairy free frosting recipe.

I am actually quite surprised that I am giving this 5 stars, but it was well worth it.  I have a neighbour who is allergic to eggs, and can never have b-day cake, I made this for her birthday and she just loved it.  I use this recipe all the time for my kids school bake sales and parties.  You cover quite a few allergies with this recipe!  They work great as cupcakes too!!  Thanks

Who ever thought an egg-free dairy-free nut-free cake would taste so good? It is moist and soft too. I added some frosting and it was perfect.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe ever! Every time we had a piece, by husband and I just kept saying "I can't believe how good this cake is!" It might be the best chocolate cake I've ever had - this is one to be kept at the front of the recipe box!

This cake was fantastic I am so pleased with the result! Very chocolatey and super moist, had it warm from the oven so had a nice slightly gooey centre YUM! I made this cake because it seemed by far to be the most 'healthy' chocolate cake recipe I have seen, not because of any allergies or anything and this will definitely be my new chocolate cake recipe from now on. I sprinkled a little icing sugar on top which was very nice as it added a little more sweetness (I cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup and used half brown and half white). Next time I think I would make a very small amount of icing with icing sugar and water. I also left out the choc chips and it was fine without them, I also only used 3 tablespoons of canola oil as well as one tablespoon skim milk (as no allergies here) and am inclined to next time try 1-2 tablespoons oil and maybe 1-2 egg whites to make this even more low fat. FANTASTIC cake thanks!

Than you for posting this recipe!  I'm on a VERY restricted diet, so finding a treat is awesome!!
I used 1/2 cup applesauce & 1/4 + 2 tbsp of honey instead of sugar.  The cake was quite dense, but really tasty.  When I made it the second time, I omitted the cocoa powder and replaced it with the same amount of flour, then replaced the chocolate chips with raisins and added cinnamon. (I used the same honey/applesuace combo, too).  It made a nice spicy cake!!!

No changes.  Tastes like regular cake if not better.  Very moist and delicious.  My daughter's friends asked how she was able to eat such a delicious cake with her allergies. Haha!  They couldn't believe it!

Did not use the chocolate chips (really doesn’t need them),  I recommend heavily greasing the pan line with parchment paper, grease the paper and then flour the pan. My first attempt I had to freeze the cakes to get them out of the pan.

I have 2 grandchildren (1 and 3 years old) who have egg and peanut allergies.  As a grandparent, it breaks my heart when they can't always partake in the treats that their friends are eating especially since they're so young and don't understand why.  This recipe has changed all that.  Now when there is a birthday celebration at daycare or in the neighborhood, my daughter just brings a slice of this cake or cupcake decorated with frosting and sprinkles and all is well.  It helps that this recipe is really good (we've tried a number of not so good recipes) and so easy to make.  I've baked this recipe just as printed and it always turns out perfect.  I could see where you could leave out the chocolate chips because the recipe is very chocolatety but for chocolate lovers leaving the chocolate chips in is the right decision.  The secret to making this cake perfect is making sure to stir in all the liquids well.  I stirred for 3 minutes when adding the oil, vinegar, and extract and again when I stirred in the water.  It needs to be well blended.  Thanks to whoever first submitted this recipe .  It has made 2 little ones and their grandmother very happy.

Turned out great! I omitted the chocolate chips and doubled this in order to make a double-layer cake. I frosted it with the Hershey cocoa recipe on the package (substituting coconut oil for the butter and rice milk for the milk). The cake was excellent texture and flavor, and as good as any other cake I've made from scratch, despite the lack of egg or dairy. Everyone liked it and we were able to enjoy dessert together even with food intolerances among the group.

Tastes like cake to me! and a real good one at that! Followed the recipe exactly. I used a bundt pan so I doubled the recipe and the amount was perfect. The reviewer who said you cannot overmix this cake is correct! I used my stand mixer and after mixing all of the dry ingredients slowly added the liquids while the beater ran. I mixed a total of 7 minutes after all of the ingredients were incorporated. That's usually a no-no for a cake but not this one.  I used vegetable shortening to grease the pan and cooked the cake a total of 57 minutes at 350 degrees. When I inverted the cake, a thin layer remained in the bundt pan, causing no harm to the overall appearance of my bunt cake. I wonder if I used spray oil instead of shortening or possibly floured the pan if that would've eliminated this. Awesome recipe which I am making for a children's function at Church and uncertain of potential allergies, I found this cake recipe. It's a great cake to make if you're out of milk and eggs. A real keeper and not just for those with allergies. Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

If I could give it more stars I would!!!!! We used this recipe for my sons first birthday smash cake and it was sooooo good. My 3 year old and husband loved it too! The best part was it literally took me under 2 minutes to mix everything and throw it in the oven.

This cake is moist and delicious! It was a huge hit by both vegans and non-vegans alike.  I only had sweetened cocoa, so I cut down on the sugar somewhere between 1/2 & 3/4 and it came out awesome! I am making it today for another function!

The cake was very dense, and needed some frosting. I tried a second time with cake flour and it was a lot lighter

Wow! I'm impressed by this recipe! I made 24 cupcakes for my son to share at school for his birthday. A few students had egg and nut allergies, but thanks to this recipe everyone was in included in the celebration. The only "change" I made was that for 24 servings it called for 3 cups of water. I only put in 2 1/2 cups because the batter began to look very watery. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

We loved this recipe!  We made a couple of modifications for additional allergies.  We subbed the flour for gluten free flour (1 cup sweet rice flour, 1/3 cup Potato starch, and 3 TB tapioca starch).  We also subbed out the sugar for date paste (1 cup whole pitted dates blended in the food processor; add 1/2 cup hot water slowly till smooth and thick then add to batter).  We left out the chocolate chips and subbed the oil for coconut oil since my son doesn't have an allergy to coconuts. They baked up beautifully.  We topped them with fresh cut strawberries and drizzled them with honey.  Perfect!

Very thick and gooey, not light at all. Not very cake-like. Maybe this is just what egg-free has to be, but I didn't think it was very good.

I've made this recipe a bunch of times - the first time, because I wanted chocolate chip muffins but didn't have any eggs or milk; thereafter, because my husband and I freaking love it. 

I didn't even actually follow the instructions all that carefully, and it still came out fine.

Most often, I substitute granulated Splenda (well, the store-brand version) or stevia for the sugar to pare down the added-sugar impact. I've had no trouble with texture or flavor; if anything, I like the Splenda version a little better than the real-sugar version. 

We're not actually vegan, so I also substitute ordinary semi-sweet or high-percentage cacao dark-chocolate chips.

Generally, I divide the batter into 6 - 10 greased muffin tins and bake for 20 - 25 minutes. My oven is a little, um, capricious -- your mileage may vary in terms of ideal cooking time and temperature.

Alternatively, if you need to make hockey pucks, just leave out the baking soda. Ask Me How I know. (Otherwise, this recipe is basically fail-safe.)

My daughter is lactose intolerant with painful side effects and I have a son with other allergies so this was worth trying.   
Just made it for the first time, only ate some bits and it tasted great!
I wish I had read some older reviews and either not used choc. chips or lined my pans with parchment.   I made 2 batches and both stuck to the pan even with very good greasing and testers coming out clean.   That was the only negative - would have given it 5 stars.   Will try again and experiment a bit more.

I made it without chocolate chips because I didn't have any on hand. Since my son is allergic to egg and milk only, I used real butter instead of vegetable oil, and I spilled about half of the melted butter, so I only added what I have left into the batter. It came out a little dry because of the missing fat and it's not sweet enough without the chocolate chips.  Next time I will follow the recipe 100%, I'm sure it will come out great. I used a loaf pan instead of a 8x8.

I made a few changes to adjust for altitude but mostly stuck to the recipe and they turned out amazing. I've been playing with recipes for years because my daughter is allergic to dairy and egg and this is the best I've found yet by far. I was even told it was better than a lot of regular cakes by one of our guests. Highly recommend this one!

It is OK taste wise, and really simple to make. Texture felt a bit chewy, not fluffy - as if was a bit raw.

I made this to share with a couple kids who have egg, dairy & nut allergies, and it turned out amazing. The only recipe change I made was to leave out the chocolate chips. Taking advice from other reviewers, I made sure to mix the batter for 3 whole minutes before spooning it into my cupcake pan. The recipe makes an even dozen cupcakes. I baked them for 20 minutes. They rose beautifully and held together very well.

This chocolate cake is amazing!  My very picky husband can stop raving about it.  It's moist, rich and you would never know that it's "anything-free" by the taste.  I frosted it with Pillsbury chocolate fudge frosting, which is egg, nut and dairy free.

I used this recipe because I ran out both eggs and milk. I didn't feel like a trip to the market on a Sunday evening. Initially it was simply okay...but this morning it was delicious! This is a wonderful recipe that makes a cake where no one will believe it's missing anything.

This is a great recipe when you substitute the water for chocolate soy milk. Just a note for dairy allergies: the chocolate chips have milk in them. If you're not allergic to nuts, you may want to look at using those instead. Otherwise, I think this recipe would be great without it.

Wanted to test out this recipe after reading many of the positive reviews. I made some of the changes people had suggested - I used 1 C soya milk and added the vinegar so it kind of curdled like buttermilk.) I also used about half a cup of cocoa powder. Baked in a 20cm round cake tin. The cake I have to say was awesome!! Very impressed as were my kids. I sprinkled about half a cup of chocolate bits on top and thought these really added a nice texture to the cake to come across the morsels of chocolate. The cake rose beautifully, was dense and chocolatey and as we didn't eat it all in one sitting I put the rest in a cake tin and forgot about it. A few days later it still tasted moist and just as good.  Will absolutely, definitely keep this recipe to make for any allergy friends I bake for. I bake alot of cakes and this one is a winner for sure.

This was great!  After reading some of the other reviews, I tried this with gluten-free flour and made cupcakes out of it.  I also bought parchment muffin cups and greased them; they separated quite easily from the cupcakes and didn't stick at all.  Also, I used Splenda instead of sugar though I did throw in the semi-sweet chocolate chips too (which have sugar) and added green sugar sprinkles on top, as this was the St. Patrick's Day dessert for our family get-together (we have dairy-free, gluten-free and reduced-sugar dietary needs between us all).  Everyone LOVED this!  A note to anyone who has never tried this with all the "free's" in it - they come out a little chewy but that's to be expected with so many substitutions for these dietary restrictions.  The family are all used to that aspect of it and found these to be so delicious, they ate 3 cupcakes each (and the kids had to be told "that's enough for you, no more" after that)!  Thanks for a great recipe that I will be sure to use again!

This cake was amazing!!! I cannot eat eggs right now due to sensitivity and have tried many many other recipes and this one turned out the best. I accidentally added a teaspoon of baking powder (along with baking soda as well) and it still turned out great. I made cupcakes and only baked for 20 min rather than 30.

I have made this cake dozens of times over the last 9 years, as well as passed it on to friends, and not one time has it been imperfect.  And I have got to be the worst baker EVER.

Ever since I discovered this recipe, I've been making this every year for my dairy and egg allergy 4 yr old son for his bday. He absolutely LOVES it! It was his first cake ever and he has no complaints. The only thing I can say is that it comes out a little more denser than most cakes, kinda like a brownie, but still tastes great for an allergy friendly chocolate cake.

my first attempt at this cake was horrible. The second time was amazing! It is a great tasting cake. I don't think I mixed enough the first time. My daughter is allergic to milk so this was a great find, for her birthday!

This is a very good recipe. My son is allergic to egg soy and nuts. And he doesn't like chocolate so I made some changes to the recipe. I use 2 1/4 cup yellow cake mix. 1cup whole milk. 1tsp baking powder. Its turns out pretty good. I made many different shapes and size. thank you for this recipe

I fixed this cake and I thought it was just ok. I made it with applesauce and oil. I don't know if I did something wrong, but the chocolate chips did not melt.

I gave this four stars since the taste was great and my daughter was able to have her first 'treat' at two.  Unfortunately my first attempt at making this resulted in it falling.  The only thing I changed was to exclude the chocolate chips.  I am going to give it another try for a party we are having when her grandparents arrive.  

If anyone has some advice on what to look out for so that it doesn't fall again, it would be great.

Thanks!

I gave this 3 stars but it was probably something I did wrong that ended in the result I got.  If anyone out there can give me some advice that would be great.  I plan on making this for my daughter's birthday party on Saturday and I did a practice run yesterday.  The changes I made were that I replaced some of the oil with applesauce, used soy milk instead of water and cooked in a convection oven.  The cake came out quite heavy (dense).  Perhaps I will try with all oil instead of applesauce and bake in regular mode instead of convection.  Any other thoughts out there?

This cake came out great. Made a couple of changes. Used unrefined sugar instead of white. Also i added hazelnut butter and crushed hazelnuts instead of the chocolate chips. 
Great consistancy. Some of the oil cakes i have made before have been too greasy. This one wasnt. Thanx for the recipe.

This recipe is awesome.  I used this recipe to make cupcakes for my son's preschool class because one of his classmates is allergic to eggs and nuts.  All the kids loved them.  They didn't even realize that they were "special".  And his classmate got to enjoy a treat with the rest of the class.  Thanks Bridget!!

I am so happy that I found this recipe!  It's fantastic!  I had to go on a restricted diet because I'm a nursing mom of a dairy-allergic child.  I was able to have a birthday cake thanks to this recipe!  It's even good without the chocolate chips.  I have had it both frosted with a dairy free canned frosting, and also served it for company with dairy-free whipped topping and strawberries.  Everyone was impressed.  I did bake it a bit longer (40min).

I followed this recipe exactly as it's printed and it turned out to be FANTASTIC!!!  It was very moist and tasted just like cake out of the box, except every one in our family could eat it.  I frosted it with chocotale frosting and my two boys topped that with sprinkles.  It didn't last long! Thank you so much for this new birthday party staple!

I made this for my niece and nephew who are allergic to dairy, egg, and nuts.  I omitted the chocolate chips.  I iced it with the Pillsbury Milk Chocolate Flavored Icing.  My niece and nephew loved it.  I agree that you'll never miss the dairy products in this cake.  I will try it again with nondairy chocolate chips.  I am thrilled to have this for my files.  Thanks, Bridget!
