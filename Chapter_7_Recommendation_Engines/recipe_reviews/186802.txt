I added a 1/2 tsp. of salt and a tsp. of vanilla. I also added about a cup of fresh blueberries. I suggest letting the batter sit for a couple minutes to soak up some of the wet. Oatmeal, corn meal and wheat flour will do that if you let it rest after mixing. These turned out fluffy and tasted great. I'd make these again. I might add another 1/2 c. of oatmeal next time, the batter was just a little thin, even after letting it sit for 15 minutes.

These were very fluffy, and we loved the combination of grains. The cornmeal adds a fun crunch.  After reading tat2wttrsh's comment about the thin batter, I put together the batter last night, and let it sit in the fridge until this morning.  It was thin when I first mixed it together, but the flours and oats did soak up all the extra liquid overnight, and the batter was just right this morning.

The kids said these were the best pancakes, and I agree.  The cornmeal adds a great crunch, and they have great flavor and sweetness, in spite of the low amount of sugar.  This is definitely a keeper.  I had to add more whole wheat flour (1/3-1/2 c.) to make the consistently thicker.  I used old-fashioned rolled oats vs. quick.  I used powdered buttermilk mixed with 1 cup water, 1 cup milk.  I also added a couple teaspoons of vanilla and few dashes salt.  I love that it's such a healthy recipe, so easy, and so delicious!  It made 16 - 4" pancakes, enough for freezing.

We have made these pancakes several times, often tweaking it a bit but they always turn out great. These modifications have worked well for us: adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt, reducing the buttermilk to 1 3/4 cup (using sour milk is alright, but not quite as amazing), and adding 1/4 cup oil. Replacing brown sugar with white sugar is fine. We find that adding vanilla can distract from the flavor of the grains. Even though we think this recipe is better with our modifications, it still gets 5 stars because it's a flexible recipe and a terrific food concept.

Really good!  I didn't have cornmeal, so I substituted wheat bran for the amount of cornmeal.  I also didn't have buttermilk and was running low on milk as well, but I did have a cup of cottage cheese in my fridge that I wanted to use up.  So I mashed up the cottage cheese and substituted 1 cup of the buttermilk with that, and the other cup of buttermilk I substituted with 1 cup of milk that I soured with lemon juice.  I also added some vanilla and cinnamon for a little extra flavor.  Because I used the cottage cheese, I had no problem with the batter being thin, it ended up being pretty thick.  I had to use a little water to thin it down.  The pancakes cooked up beautifully.  I topped them with the "Cinnamon Apple Syrup" recipe found on this website.  Delicious!  I'm excited to buy cornmeal and try this recipe again.

These were so good. I halved the recipe, but then messed up & only halved the ww flour. I even added in Wheat Germ. So I played around with the buttermilk til it looked right. My husband is a diabetic so I only added 2 t of my homemade brown sugar splenda blend. We ate it with sugar free syrup, walnuts & blueberries. Good for you & delish!

Healthy AND tasty - a winning combination. Just remember to let the batter sit for a few minutes. It will thicken and cook up beautifully!

These were fabulous!  I was very skeptical about the corn meal, but it added just a touch of sweetness and great texture.  Even our pickiest kids, who only like the light n fluffy pancakes, devoured these.  We did add a touch of vanilla to the mix and added more liquid to make the batter a little thinner.  We used the powdered buttermilk stuff, and will hopefully have the real deal on-hand next time.   Also ground the oatmeal in a mini processor, which helped hide the whole grains from the kids.  Love these!

Everyone liked these, even the kids and I feel good that they are so healthy.  I added some vanilla and let them sit to thicken like reviews suggested.  In the second batch, I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water and they turned out the same.

These pancakes are excellent.  I changed the recipe by omitting the cornmeal (my kids don't like the grittiness) and instead of whole wheat flour, I used a combination of barley flour, whole wheat pastry flour, amaranth flour, spelt flour and brown rice flour.  My mix is equal portions of each of the flours.  Thanks for sharing!

I usually don't write reviews but I had to on this one. With slight modifications - this was fantastic! I skipped the cornmeal and increased rolled oats to 1 cup (was a bit too thick so I might do 3/4 cup next time). I also substituted 5 tbsp of honey for br sugar (I might do 4 next time, although 5 was good too). These were fantastic. So filling and sooo good for you!

I usually like whole grain pancakes, but did not care for these.  They were flat and bland.  I made as instructed and after trying one, we tried adding blueberries to add some flavor, but they still weren't great.

These pancakes are light and fluffy, very unexpexted texture for a whole grain pancake. Followed others advise and let the batter sit for a short time to let the whole grains expand and make it less runny. Very tasty!

These had a really nice flavor. I found them a little difficult to cook, though. I had to grease my pan more than I'm used to because they tended to stick, even to my amazing, expensive, non-stick pan! They also got brown really fast and didn't set up as quickly in the middle, so I had to turn the temperature down quite a bit and cook them much longer. I made a few changes to the original recipe. I didn't have any cornmeal, so I substituted wheat germ. I also didn't have any buttermilk, so I used lemon juice and milk. I added some cinnamon and vanilla for a little extra flavor. I think next time I will leave some of the sugar out of it, because the pancake was pretty sweet. All in all this is a very nice base recipe. I think with a little more tweaking it could be close to perfect.

As a parent of two very picky eaters I have been searching high and low for a HEALTHY pancake recipe. I've tried 3 other recipes with no luck. I served these for Valentines Day breakfast and held my breath. They BOTH LIKE IT! One of them ate FOUR!  I doubled the recipe and added another 1/2 cup oats to the batter. I allowed it to sit for 20 minutes while I cleaned the kitchen and made a cake. It wasn't a thick batter like I was used to but it cooked up nicely. Next time I plan to add some vanilla and I want to try making it the night before and putting it in the fridge to soak overnight. We also topped it with apple butter and syrup for something different and it was yummy!

These have a wonderful healthy but delicious flavor.  I didn't have any flaxseed meal but I did sub in 3 Tbs. wheat germ.  Batter is a bit thin, even after I let it sit for over 5 minutes, but I tend to like SUPER thick pancakes, so next time I can just adjust some things.  Next time might add in a splash of vanilla as well.  Great, tasty recipe!!

This is just the hearty, healthy recipe I was looking for. With the substitution of stevia in place of sugar, you have all natural ingredients that are all good for you. I have mixed the dry ingedients and put them in a container to use as my pancake mix --- no more store bought. Let the batter sit 10 minutes to thicken up and cook on a hot griddle for light, fluffy, wholesome pancakes.

Absolutely the best I've had!!! I havn't really read any of the comments below but I don't see a reason to customize this recipe. It's wonderful finding a whole wheat pancake recipe that actually tastes good. On top of the whole wheat goodness you don't have to feed your family w/all the junk that goes along w/store bought pancake mix such as aluminum ect.!!! Excellent! Healthier and tasty! It doesn't get better than this!

'Not sure if I can add anything to what's already been written, but I agree that this is a very good pancake--even if you don't add flaxseed.

Delicious!  I added a little salt and we didn't have buttermilk and I was too lazy to make any so I used 1 1/2 cup of milk and a 4 oz vanilla yogurt container.  These were fantastic - even my health-averse husband loved them.

This is my first review, but I had to write it because these are great pancakes!  I have tried oodles of pancake recipes, but this one is so perfect because it tastes great AND is healthier.  It was so easy to make the batter and I love that it uses whole wheat flour, flaxseed, and NO butter.   I made it exactly as the recipe states.  Next time I will try it with the cinnamon apple syrup recipe.

Really good! I scaled down the ingredients for one portion (I'm a student and I live by myself :P) and improvised a little with what I had:  1/4 cup whole wheat flour 1/4 cup rolled oats 1/4 tsp baking powder 1/8 tsp baking soda 1/4 egg, beaten 1/2 cup chocolate soy milk  I had those with bananas, apples and (shh!) a little bit of chocolate syrup. Mmmm! :)

Excellent pancakes and especially fluffy if the batter rests for 10 min before cooking. I only put 1 TB brown sugar and added 1/4 C apple sauce and they still tasted very sweet to me.  I also threw in a scoop of vanilla flavored protein powder.

Mmmmm... these were so good! Delicious and healthier than normal pancakes. I used .5 of skim (didn't have buttermilk), added a cup of applesauce, and left out the flax (mine was too old to use). I also added some cinnamon and vanilla and topped it with honey! Very good!

These were the best "healthy" pancakes I've made. I added 1/2 tsp salt and used "sour milk" instead of buttermilk. I let the batter sit for a few minutes before starting-they cooked well and had a great taste and texture. Thanks!

I did these for breakfast this morning. I must have done something wrong as the batter was like water. I changed nothing, after cooking about half the batter and having problems flipping them, I added more flour, they then of course thickened and cook up very nicely. Even the "I don't like healthy food" crowd ate them and up and liked them. I like the idea of having pancakes with some healthy ideas but if I do these again I will double the flour.

YUMMMMMMY. Let me start by saying I made these twice in one week. Wow. Soo good. I love that there is only whole wheat flour in this recipe and no white flour. Love the cornmeal and oats. The first time I made this, I planned on topping my pancakes with syrup and lots of toppings (berries, nuts, etc.), but I just ate it with syrup (sugar free) and completely forgot about the toppings because they were that good. I didn't change a thing to the existing ingredients (except to triple it because I wanted to make more and have it last for 2 days), but I did add a few things to mine: a few tablespoons of applesauce (there is no oil in this recipe which I liked, but there needs to be some oil substitute), and 3 tsp of vanilla, a dash of salt, and some cinnamon (to taste). Loved loved loved it. Cannot say enough good things about it. A very healthy, filling, and tasty breakfast! Oh and I agree with other reviewers that letting the batter sit after mixing is key. After stirring I let it rest for approx 15 minutes and it was perfect! Thanks for the recipe! It is now our favorite pancake recipe!

These were pretty good.  I started off making the recipe exactly as written, but coated the bottom of my cast iron skillet with bacon grease (instead of nonstick spray)before cooking to add some extra flavor.  The batter will thicken up nicely if you let it set for a few minutes before cooking, as others have stated.  I cooked a couple and then tasted, and decided to add 1/4 tsp. of salt, even though I'm not usually much of a salt person.  I also tossed in about 1/4 c. of roughly chopped pecans. The pancakes were beautifully brown and, served with butter and syrup, tasted great too.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the cornmeal - the texture of it does come through when eating, but I still enjoyed my meal.

These were just okay. I didn't have a problem with the batter being too thin, but they didn't have a lot of flavor. I added 3 tbsp of wheat germ, 1 tbsp of vanilla (my daughters like very vanilla pancakes), and 1 cup of blueberries. I think that I'll keep looking for the perfect whole grain pancake recipe.... especially since I don't love the corn meal in this one.

Left out the sugar, used 1 cup light cream and 1 cup water with a dose of vinegar (buttermilk substitute), had no soy so used extra corn meal - still came out tasty!

Whole grain pancakes are difficult to get right.  I've tried many.  This recipe really works!  Although, I did take into account the many reviews that said the amount of buttermilk makes the batter too wet, so I started with 1 & 1/4 cup and just added a little bit at a time until I reached a good consistency.  Other than that I kept to the recipe. Worked wonderful. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to measure the batter for the hot pan; Worked well.  I served these with toasted walnuts and a rhubarb compote I winged using frozen rhubarb, a bit of cinnamon and stevia for sweetening.  This was a rockin' good combination.  If you want whole grain pancakes this is a great recipe.

This is a good base for a healthier pancake.  Due to dietary restrictions, I omitted the brown sugar altogether as well as the corn meal and added an extra 1/4 C. whole wheat flour instead.  I thought the rolled oats needed to soak up some batter as it was very runny, but even with soaking half the day it was still super runny.  Next time I will use 1 1/2 C. buttermilk instead.  I was still able to use the batter it just made for thinner pancakes, but the taste was fine.

These were horrible! I dont know what happened but I have attempted these twice now anticipating wonderful pancakes and they never cooked through and never bubbled much like normal cakes. When they were completely browned and completely flat I took them off (since they just couldnt sit and cook any longer) and there was still batter seeping through the blueberry cracks and when I cut into them, the insides were still raw and gooey. The only thing I did differently is that I added 3 tablespoons of applesauce instead of the brown sugar and I sprinkled on some blueberries after about a minute of cooking. Why this happened? I dont know! I make pancakes all the time. Any ideas on why this would be? I am bummed they didnt turn out twice now-kids waiting at table hungry and no breakfast resorting in cereal or oatmeal.

This recipy is amazing. I've tried other recepies before and I never had such delicious pancakes. I did some minor modifications, instead of butter milk I used 2% reduced fat milk and added a bit of vanilla extract and they turnedout great.

I give these 5 stars because they're healthy and my husband will eat them.  The first time I made them I didn't have flaxseed meal and they came out liquidy and super flat even with a little extra flour, but I liked the flavor and my little 10 year old cousin said they were good.  This time I found that adding flaxseed meal made it the perfect consistency for me and they were less flat.  I still wouldn't call them "fluffy" (maybe I mixed them too much?), but my dad said that with wheat pancakes whipping the egg whites until they're stiff and then folding them in helps so I'll try that next time.  Oh, salt and vanilla are a must, and I used lemon and milk instead of butter milk.

I love this recipe because I had all the items already in my cupboard.  Second because it was easy.  And third, it has replaced my beloved arrowhead mills multigrain pancake recipe from whole foods that I enjoyed but was $10 a bag!  Thank you.  And I put some cinnamon, vanilla extract and blueberries and instead of using buttermilk, I use almond milk. Love it!!

Our whole family loves this recipe... even our picky kids. It's easier (quicker) to make than other whole grain recipes we've tried and has a nice mild flavor, which the kids appreciate. I typically add a bit of cinnamon, but otherwise, keep the recipe as is (substituting buttermilk for skim with a bit of lemon juice). Also, I've never made it ahead of time, and we enjoy the texture as is.

These are great.  The mix of grains is very good.  I tweeked a little bit - added 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, but only because I really like cinnamon.  Plus, I let the batter sit for about 5 minutes so the oats could absorb some liquid.

These are good as is, but I couldn't help coming up with some variations I will try next time.  A handful of chopped walnuts or pecans and agave instead of brown sugar for instance.  I will also add some chia seeds.

These were ok, not great, multi grain anything is hard to get my family to like, I was hoping this would be a way to slip in some healthy grains and fiber, no such luck.

These are fantastic! My daughter is allergic to dairy, so we always replace the buttermilk with almond milk or coconut milk. They are delectable every time! We usually make homemade fruit "syrup" to go on top, with apples or strawberries.

Fluffy, healthy, delicious! I added my own twist - about 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I also substituted: instead of buttermilk, 1 3/4 cups almond milk and 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar; instead of flaxseeds, wheat bran. As per reviewers’ suggestions, I let the batter sit for a few minutes before cooking. They turned out very good! And I love how healthy they are. I will definitely be making these again.

Great basic recipe that doesn't require white flour. Nice and filling. Makes about six eight-inch pancakes. Easily tweaked as necessary. I.e.  use almond milk and tablespoon vinegar in place of milk; add vanilla extract or honey; etc.

I never have liked pancakes much. These changed my mind! I did have to change it a little to what I had on hand. Usually I make a recipe as is but, got hungry  :) . I used chia seeds instead of flaxseed meal, a little less brown sugar, and almond milk instead of buttermilk. Let it sit for about 5 minutes before cooking. Had them with real maple syrup and fried eggs. So good and full of flavor!

These are my absolute favorite pancakes. I've made them dozens of times and every time they come out perfectly. I don't keep cornmeal on hand so I usually just add an extra 1/4 cup of oats and a cup of berries. Delicious!

No changes. This is my 6 year old son's favorite pancake! We make a big batch and store leftovers in the fridge. They warm up nicely in the toaster.

Surprised how thin the batter was.  Thank goodness for the other reviews to help me along.  I let it sit a while and added some pancake mix I had on hand to help thicken it up. Next time will use less buttermilk (which I made with milk and vinegar). Topped with some blueberries, strawberries and maple syrup.  Delish!

I liked this recipe with tweaks, but without and as the recipe is written, the batter would have been too thin and bland.  After finding the batter too thin (even after letting sit for a while, which is not what the recipe calls for), I added more oatmeal and flour.  I also tasted the batter, then made a pancake as a tester, and realized it also needed salt to bring out the flavors.  Therefore, as written, the recipe is a three, but if you add extra dry ingredients, salt, and let sit for a bit, it would be a five.  Easy changes, but misleading to say it's a five star recipe.

What an amazing recipe! They are healthful but still delicious! Half of the buttermilk that we used was evaporated and I used whole flax seeds instead of meal, but everything else was followed to the letter! My kids loved them too. We topped our with frozen blueberries and strawberries that we heated in a saucepan (without adding sugar).

I cut this recipe in half: i used a 1/2 cup of wheat flour. 1/4 tsp of baking soda, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, about a tbsp of ground (use a coffee grinder for seeds) flax seed, a 1/4 cup of old fashion rolled oats, 1 tbsp of red wheat bran, 1 tsp olive oil, 1 egg, and enough milk to make a thin pancake batter. let batter sit for about 10 minutes. add more milk if necessary and fry pancakes on medium heat until browned on both sides. make 3 large pancakes.

I never followed the recipe exactly based on other reviews. I decreased milk, added some coconut oil, cinnamon and vanilla. I really liked the pancakes with those changes. I think with the addition of oil the texture was better than other reviewers described. I also didn't have a problem with them cooking in the middle.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled it (and actually got 16 pancakes--so many times I don't get how many the recipes states) and I used butter to fry the pancakes. They are delicious and the kids loved them. I really enjoy the flavor and the crunch from the corn meal.

I am single so I recalc this recipe for 2 and still have plenty to freeze.  I use 1/4 c applesauce instead of the sugar and add wheat bran, but use the recipe as written otherwise.  Feel the vanilla would take away from the cornmeal (I use old fashioned cornmeal so it is coarser).  I am sorry but I don't find this recipe runny at all, maybe because I add the wheat bran.  I found a recipe today on FB for Pumpkin Butter and will try that in the morning.  Love this recipe, it is addictive.

This is my favorite healthy pancake recipe.  I always use sour milk (1 c. milk to 1 T lemon juice) instead of buttermilk.  Since I don't have flaxseed meal, I either grind up flaxseeds in a blender or I substitute wheat germ.

These were very yummy! I was looking for something healthy and the 4 year old and even the 10 month baby gobbled these up. I did add a dash of salt and used regular milk that I soured with 2 tblsp of white vinegar(let it set a few minutes). I also added a dash of vanilla. These cooked up great to my surprise even with no oil in the recipe. Made plenty to freeze for quick breakfast for school. Oh and I did throw some blueberries in half the mix and that was great too!
